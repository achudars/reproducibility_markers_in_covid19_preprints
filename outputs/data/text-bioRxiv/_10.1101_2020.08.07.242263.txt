Abstract
Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2

32

is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we

33

analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences,

34

along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the

35

distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and

36

intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at

37

35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some

38

protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and

39

the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune

40

recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-

41

human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous

42

mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L;

43

ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over

44

time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness

45

advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine

46

development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call

47

researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.

48

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019

49

(COVID-19). This disease has spread worldwide, and as of June 26, 2020, has

50

infected more than nine million humans1. The whole-genome sequence of SARS-

51

CoV-2 is 96.2% similar to that of a bat SARS-related coronavirus (RaTG13) and is 79%

52

similar to human SARS-CoV2. Recent studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is

53

more easily transmitted from person to person than SARS-CoV3,4. SARS-CoV-2 has

54

also gradually accumulated new mutations that may make it more suitable to the

55

human host5,6.

56

With the development of next-generation sequencing, it has become possible to

57

conduct large-scale studies to detect inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms

58

(inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) for infectious

59

diseases, such as Ebola virus that can uncover essential information concerning their

60

transmission and evolution7,8. Thus, tracing inter-host SNPs and iSNVs, and revealing

61

the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is a priority.

62

To trace mutations in SARS-CoV-2, we first identified similarities and

63

differences in SNPs from assembled genome sequences and publicly available raw

64

reads. We collected 15,818 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the

65

publicly accessible GISAID, CNGBdb, GenBank, GWH9 and NMDC databases on

66

May 27, 2020. All of these sequences were aligned against the reference genome

67

(Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank NC_045512.2)10 using MUSCLE11, revealing 7,700 inter-

68

host SNP sites (4,672 nonsynonymous, 2,570 synonymous, 98 stop gain, 7 stop loss,

69

and 433 noncoding) (Extended Data Table 1). Publicly available raw reads were

70

extracted from 1,364 clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples from Australia, 109 samples from

71

India, 400 samples from the United Kingdom, 112 samples from China12, and 365

72

samples from the United States that were collected between January and May 2020

73

(Extended Data Table 2). After quality control steps, 5,705 iSNVs (3,796

74

nonsynonymous, 1,572 synonymous, 261 stop gain, 4 stop loss and 134 noncoding)

75

(Extended Data Table 3) were identified from these samples, with only 48.3%

76

(2,756/5,705) of them shared with the SNPs from the inter-host SNP data (Extended

77

Data Fig.1). Combining these two SNPs dataset revealed that 35.6% (10,649/29,903)

78

of the bases in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence had been mutated at least once

79

Extended Data Fig.1). Because only 2,350 samples with raw reads have been

80

analyzed, the number of iSNV is much underestimated.

81

We then investigated the distribution of inter-host SNPs and iSNVs in each open

82

reading frame (ORF) and found similar trends in the SNP numbers and SNP numbers

83

normalized by the length between inter-host SNPs and iSNVs (Fig. 1, a-d). We then

84

focused on the S-protein receptor binding domain (RBD) as it is being used for

85

monoclonal antibody isolation and vaccine design13,14. Several mutations were found

86

in this region, including 68 inter-host nonsynonymous and 65 intra-host

87

nonsynonymous mutations (Fig. 1, a and c). An excess of C-to-T, A-to-G and T-to-C

88

mutations were observed in both the inter-host SNPs and iSNVs, which may be the

89

result of the RNA editing signature of APOBEC deaminases and ADAR enzymes

90

(Fig. 1e). Furthermore, we analyzed the distributions of the numbers of

91

nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations (Fig. 1f). Some regions of the SARS-

92

CoV-2 genome have greater numbers of nonsynonymous mutations than the average

93

level (Fig. 1f). The high numbers of nonsynonymous mutations found at the ends of

94

the SARS-CoV-2 genome might stem from errors of genome assembly. The higher

95

numbers of nonsynonymous mutations for some regions might be due to higher

96

substitution rates and increased recombination. To address this, we estimated the

97

substitution rates using BEAST15 a set of assembled genomes obtained from patients

98

from Shanghai. A substitution rate of 1.20×10-3 mutations per site per year (95%

99

highest posterior density interval, 6.14×10-4 to 1.87×10-3 mutations per site per year)

100

for these SARS-CoV-2 genomes was estimated (Extended Data Table 4), which is

101

similar to the previous estimate of 9.7×10-4 mutations per site per year16. However,

102

higher substitution rates were found for some protein-coding regions (such as genome

103

positions 21,563-22,700 and 24,300-25,384 in the S protein), of approximately

104

2.95×10-3 to 3.94×10-3 mutations per site per year (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Table 4).

105

When the sequences were tested for evidence of recombination using the

106

Recombination Detection Program (RDP)17, none was detected in the genomes from

107

the Shanghai patients. These results suggest that some regions of the SARS-CoV-2

108

genome are experiencing faster rates of evolution.

109

To determine whether diversifying selection was occurring in SARS-CoV-2, we

110

first calculated π, the nucleotide diversity of the viral populations using pairwise

111

comparisons for each gene from the inter-host sequences. We can evaluate the level of

112

natural selection acting upon the sequences by comparing the frequencies of the

113

synonymous (πS) and nonsynonymous (πN) polymorphisms18. πS>πN is indicative of

114

purifying selection removing deleterious mutations, πS<πN indicates diversifying

115

selection, and πS=πN suggests neutrality. For most genes, the inter-host sequence data

116

shows that πN is less than πS, implying that purifying selection plays a central role in

117

the evolution of these SARS-CoV-2 genes (Extended Data Table 5). For ORF3a and

118

ORF8, πN was greater than πS, although the standard error of the πN values is high

119

(Extended Data Table 5), which prevents us from concluding that diversifying

120

selection is occurring in those two genes. Previous studies have indicated that

121

evolution of the mucin-like domain of the Ebola virus glycoprotein might have been

122

driven by diversifying selection imposed by antibodies7. To further investigate

123

regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome whose evolution might have been driven by

124

diversifying selection, we calculated πN and πS using a sliding window of 30 codons

125

and a step size of 3 codons18. Using this sliding window analysis, we found signals for

126

diversifying selection in small regions of the ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, and ORF8 genes

127

(Fig. 2a). πN is greater than πS in one region (Genome position: 23,318-23,488, S

128

protein: 584-641) in the SD2 domain of the S protein (27 nonsynonymous and 16

129

synonymous within this region) (Fig. 2a). This region, including the fitness advantage

130

pandemic mutation D614G5, is in the surface-exposed viral protein of the SARS-CoV

131

virus and might be a primary target for antibodies. Thus, antibodies might be the

132

driving force for the diversifying selection seen in this region. Further studies are

133

needed to test the enrichment of mutations within the B cell epitopes within this

134

region.

135

The frequency of iSNVs can also be used to reveal selection signals8,19. We

136

analyzed the mutated allele frequency (MuAF) using the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a

137

reference. We performed the MuAF analysis using a sliding window of 30 codons and

138

a step size of 3 codons. A small region (Genome position: 23,066-23,191, S protein:

139

502-543) of the RBD and SD1 domains of the S protein has a nonsynonymous

140

frequency that is significantly higher than the synonymous frequency (there are 13

141

nonsynonymous and 7 synonymous mutations in this region) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov

142

test, P<0.05) (Fig. 2b). Another region (Genome position: 24,218-24,316, S protein:

143

886-918) in the S protein CR and HR1 domains also has a significantly higher

144

nonsynonymous frequency than the synonymous frequency (there are 9

145

nonsynonymous and 4 synonymous mutations in this region) (Fig. 2b) and is

146

overlapping with substitution mutation rate region (block 5 in Extended Data Table 4;

147

genome position: 24,300-27,800). Diversifying selection on these two regions might

148

also be driven by an intra-host escape from antibody recognition.

149

To study the mechanisms for the generation and transmission of fitness

150

advantage mutations, we first investigated the number of iSNVs over time and noticed

151

that the numbers of iSNVs was generally steady with few fluctuations (Fig. 3a). Thus,

152

we concluded that there was no increase in diversity within intra-host genomes over

153

time. iSNVs provide valuable information about human-to-human transmission and

154

are useful for characterizing human-to-human transmission chains. In the 2,187

155

worldwide cases, which spanned 5 months of the COVID-19 epidemic, 1,988 samples

156

shared at least one iSNVs (Fig. 3b). The shared iSNVs can be explained by

157

superinfection, recurring mutation or human-to-human transmission7. We can rule out

158

superinfection, as 2,949 shared iSNVs were detected only in raw reads and were not

159

identified in the assembled sequences. Additionally, the fitness advantage mutation (G

160

to A change) at position 23,403 (spike protein, D614G, Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank

161

NC_045512.2)5 is at an intermediate frequency (~60% in four samples) in the

162

Australia population, and belong to G clade (Extended Data Fig.2). If superinfection

163

were common in COVID-19 patients, we would expect to see near equal distributions

164

of iSNVs containing individuals in both the A and G clades. From the above results,

165

we conclude that superinfection is not an important reason for the existence of iSNVs.

166

Another possible reason for shared iSNVs is recurring mutation and human-to-human

167

transmission. We can see the shared iSNVs at low frequencies in different countries

168

or regions and at different times. Thus, we cannot exclude the influence of recurring

169

mutation. Importantly, all of the shared iSNVs are unlikely to be the result of only

170

recurring mutations as 23,403 variants were found at >90% frequency in 34 different

171

samples from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. The high

172

frequency of the shared iSNVs might arise from human-to-human transmission and/or

173

adaption. In summary, we can conclude that recurrent mutations and human-to-

174

human transmission could lead to the observed iSNV pattern seen in COVID-19

175

patients.

176

Population genetics theory points out that an allele with a fitness advantage will

177

increase in frequency faster than alleles without a fitness advantage. Thus, if a

178

mutation has a selective advantage, then the frequency of this mutation will gradually

179

increase over time in a transmission chain (Fig. 4a). To detect possible fitness

180

advantage mutations in SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed 343 iSNVs in genomes from

181

Shanghai, China, requiring that the iSNVs existed for at least three days and from two

182

samples for each day. Furthermore, we constructed a median-joining haplotype

183

network (Fig. 4b) using PopART (http://popart.otago.ac.nz) and a phylogenetic tree

184

(Extended Data Fig.3) using IQ-TREE for the Shanghai samples20. We then

185

calculated the allele frequency and plotted the population-level frequency dynamic

186

with isolate sampling times for the above iSNVs for each lineage. We found two

187

shared iSNVs (mutation type) in the red cluster and two shared iSNVs in the black

188

cluster that had gradual frequency increases over time (Fig. 4c and Extended Data

189

Fig.4a). The T to C mutation (position 22,760, S protein) causing the F400L amino

190

acid substitution might be a fitness advantage mutation for SARS-CoV-2 in these

191

patients, while another synonymous mutation (T to C, position 22,762) in the same

192

codon is likely hitchhiking. Another pair of mutations (C to T, position 25,883,

193

ORF3a protein, T164I and A to T, position 19413, ORF1a protein, Q6383H) might

194

also provide a fitness advantage within these SARS-CoV-2 patients. Genetic drift

195

could also lead to increases in iSNV frequency. Whereas genetic drift may affect the

196

whole genome, some iSNVs may not follow similar patterns and thus, likely were

197

driven by purifying or neutral selection (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig.4b). However,

198

we cannot completely rule out the influence of genetic drift. These mutations, to date,

199

are not yet highly prevalent in COVID-19 patients. We urged researchers to focus on

200

these types of mutations and upload raw data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to public

201

databases for the monitoring of iSNV frequencies.

202

In summary, we found that to May 27, at least 35.6% of the bases of the SARS-

203

CoV-2 genome harbor one or more mutation and that evolution of mutations in the

204

spike protein gene might have been driven by diversifying selection to increase

205

diversity to escape immune system recognition. Furthermore, we found that recurring

206

mutations and human-to-human transmission are the reasons for the prevalence of the

207

fitness advantage mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Through an analysis of shared iSNVs in

208

SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients from Shanghai, we found three alleles that

209

might be fitness advantage mutations for SARS-CoV-2. This study provides

210

theoretical support for vaccine development and optimizing treatment. We also

211

strongly recommend that researchers submit raw sequence data and epidemiological

detection of fitness advantage mutations of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

323
324
325

SARS-CoV-2 data
15,818 high-quality assembled SARS-CoV-2 sequences were acquired from the

326

GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/), CNGBdb (https://db.cngb.org/), GenBank

327

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), GWH (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/), and

328

NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/nCoV) databases (on May 27, 2020). These sequences were

329

sampled from December 2019 to May 2020 and distributed across 77 countries.

330

We downloaded raw sequence datasets for SARS-CoV-2 that included 1,160

331

samples from Australia (SRA accession number PRJNA613958), 400 from United

332

Kingdom (SRA accession number PRJEB37886), 281 from United States (SRA

333

accession number PRJNA614995), and 112 from China (SRA accession number

334

PRJNA627662). All data used in this study are acknowledged and listed in Extended

335

Data Table 2.

336

Assembled sequence analysis

337

All 15,817 assembled sequences were aligned against the SARS-CoV-2

338

reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank NC_045512.2) using MUSCLE version

339

3.8.3111. Subsequently, SNPs were called from the aligned sequences. SNPs were

340

annotated to protein-coding genes and intergenic regions using ANNOVAR21.

341

Assembled sequences from Shanghai and Australia were downloaded from the

342

GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/), which have corresponding raw sequence

343

data in the SRA database (accession number PRJNA627662 and PRJNA613958),

344

were aligned using MUSCLE version 3.8.3111. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic

345

trees were constructed using IQ-TREE version 2.0.520. Median-joining haplotype

346

networks were built using PopART version 1.7 (http://popart.otago.ac.nz/).

347

Phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks were used for further analyses.

348

iSNVs analysis

349

To obtain high-confidence iSNVs, we first trimmed low-quality bases from the

350

raw reads using Trimmomatic 0.39 with default parameters22. The passed reads were

351

mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome using BWA mem version 0.7.17 with

352

default parameters23. GATK MarkDuplicates version 4.1.3.0 was used to mark

353

duplicate reads24,25. The iSNVs were detected using bcftools mpileup version 1.10.2

354

with : mapping quality ＞20, base quality ＞20, mapping quality ＞5026. iSNVs were

355

then filtered using bcftools filter version 1.10.2 with ‘QUAL<10 || DP<15’ parameters

356

for data from India, United Kingdom, and China, and ‘QUAL<10 || DP<30’ for data

357

from the United States and Australia26. We used different parameters due to their

358

differences in sequencing depth. To remove errors from the sequencing and mapping

359

data, only iSNVs that were covered by at least five reads were used for further

360

analyses.

361

Substitution rates

362

Substitution rates for the Shanghai samples were assessed using the Bayesian

363

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in BEAST v1.8.415. We performed

364

the analysis for 100 million generations, sampling every 10,000 steps as done in a

365

previous study27.

366

Natural selection analysis

367

We calculated the nonsynonymous (πN) and synonymous (πS) nucleotide

368

diversity using SNPGeine with a script using the aligned sequences18. To intuitively

369

display the potential natural selection regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we further

370

carried out sliding window analyses (window size, 30 codons; step size, 3 codons) of

371

the πN and πS.

372

Mutated allele frequency (MuAF) of the iSNVs were calculated using a sliding

373

window (window size, 30 codons; step size, 3 codons) with a sequencing error rate of

374

0.001 and minor allele frequency of 0.001, and other parameters as used in a previous

375

study19.

376

iSNVs dynamics analysis

377

To prevent a mapping bias caused by polymorphisms, the iSNVs in the SARS-

378

CoV-2 reference genome were replaced with ‘N’ for each sample. We used BWA

379

mem 0.7.17 with default parameters to re-map the reads23.

380

Following the haplotype network and phylogenetic tree in the Shanghai samples,

381

we calculated the allele frequency and plotted the frequency with collection time for

382

each lineage.
