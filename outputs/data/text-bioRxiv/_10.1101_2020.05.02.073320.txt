Summary Paragraph
The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
There are currently no therapeutic options for mitigating this disease due to lack of a
vaccine and limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology. As a result, there is an urgent
need to create new disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and to screen for
therapeutics using human disease-relevant tissues. COVID-19 patients typically present
with respiratory symptoms including cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, but
nearly 25% of patients have gastrointestinal indications including anorexia, diarrhea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, these symptoms are associated with worse
COVID-19 outcomes1. Here, we report using human pluripotent stem cell-derived
colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the permissiveness of colonic cell types to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell RNA-seq and immunostaining showed that the
putative viral entry receptor ACE2 is expressed in multiple hESC-derived colonic cell
types, but highly enriched in enterocytes. Multiple cell types in the COs can be infected
by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, which was further validated in vivo using a
humanized mouse model. We used hPSC-derived COs in a high throughput platform to
screen 1280 FDA-approved drugs against viral infection. Mycophenolic acid and
quinacrine dihydrochloride were found to block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoentry virus in COs both in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed to block infection of SARSCoV-2 virus. This study established both in vitro and in vivo organoid models to
investigate infection of SARS-CoV-2 disease-relevant human colonic cell types and
identified drugs that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection, suitable for rapid clinical testing.

Previously, we reported a chemically-defined protocol to derive COs from hPSCs2,
which we modified slightly based on published studies3. In brief, HUES8 hESCs were
induced with CHIR99021 (CHIR) and Activin A to generate definitive endoderm (DE)
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). After 4 days of culture with CHIR +FGF4 to induce hindgut
endoderm (HE), cells were treated with BMP2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and
CHIR for 3 days to promote specification of colon progenitors (CPs). Starting on day 11,
CPs were treated with a colonic medium containing CHIR, LDN193189 (LDN), and EGF.
After embedding these organoids in Matrigel, spheroids became pseudostratified and
progressively cavitated into fully convoluted organoids (Fig. 1a). The organoids
expressed

CDX2,

Villin

and

SATB2,

confirming

identity

(Fig.

1b).

Immunocytochemistry confirmed that COs contain cell types found in normal colon,
including keratin 20 (KRT20)+ epithelial cells, mucin 2 (MUC2)+ goblet cells, EPH
receptor B2 (EPHB2)+ transit-amplifying (TA) cells, and chromogranin A (CHGA)+
neuroendocrine (NE) cells (Fig. 1c).

Single cell RNA-seq was used to examine global transcript profiles at single cell
resolution (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Consistent with the immunostaining results, most
cells express CDX2 and VIL1 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Five cell clusters were
identified including KRT20+ epithelial cells, MUC2+ goblet cells, EPHB2+ TA cells,
CHGA+ NE cells, and LGR5+ or BMI1+ stem cells (Fig. 1d-e, Extended Data Fig. 1d).
We examined the expression of two factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, the
putative receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS24. Both are expressed in all five cell
clusters, but highly enriched in KRT20+ enterocytes (Fig. 1f-g). Two-dimensional

correlation confirmed the co-expression relationship for ACE2 and KRT20, as well as
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1h). Immunohistochemistry further validated the coexpression of KRT20 and ACE2 in hPSC-COs (Fig. 1i).

To model infection of hPSC-COs with SARS-CoV-2, we used a vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV) based SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, with the backbone provided by a VSV-G
pseudo-typed

ΔG-luciferase virus and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein incorporated into

the surface of the viral particle (See Methods for details)5,6. COs were fragmentized and
innoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus. 24 or 48 hr post-infection (hpi),
the cells were lysed and monitored for luciferase activity (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The
organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus at MOI=0.01 showed a strong
signal at 24 hpi (Fig. 2a). Single cell RNA-seq was performed to examine the hPSCderived COs at 24 hpi. The same five cell populations were identified in the COs postinfection (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b-d). Compared to uninfected samples, the
KRT20+ enterocyte population decreased significantly (Fig. 2c). Immunostaining
confirmed increased cellular apoptosis, suggesting toxicity for these cells (Extended
Data Fig. 2e). In addition, the ACE2+ population was significantly depleted (Fig. 2e).
The mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus, including VSV-NS, VSV-N, and VSVM, were detected in all five cell populations (Fig. 2f), but not in the uninfected COs
(Extended Data Fig. 2f). Immunostaining further validated the expression of luciferase
in ACE2+, VIL1+, CDX2+, KRT20+, and MUC2+ cells (Fig. 2g).

Humanized mice carrying hPSC-COs in vivo provide a unique platform for modeling
COVID-19. In brief, hPSC-COs were transplanted under the kidney capsule of NODscid IL2Rgnull mice. Two weeks after transplantation, the organoid xenograft was
removed and examined for cellular identities (Fig. 2h). Consistent with in vitro culture,
ACE2 can be detected in hPSC-derived KRT20+ enterocytes (Fig. 2i). SARS-CoV-2
pseudo-entry virus was inoculated locally. At 24 hpi, the xenografts were removed and
analyzed by immuno-histochemistry. Luciferase was detected in the xenografts
inoculated with virus, but not in MOCK-infected controls (Fig. 2j). Immunohistochemistry
detected luciferase in ACE2+ and Villin+ cells, suggesting these are permissive to
SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus infection in vivo (Fig. 2k).

Next, we adapted hPSC-COs to a high throughput screening platform and probed the
Prestwick FDA-approved drug library to identify drug candidates capable of blocking
SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus infection. In brief, hPSC-COs were cultured in 384-well
plates. After overnight incubation, organoids were treated with drugs from the library at
10

μM.

One hour post-exposure with drugs, the organoids were innoculated with the

SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus. 24 hpi, the organoids were analyzed for luciferase
activity (Fig. 3a). Drugs that decreased the luciferase activity by at least 75% were
chosen as primary hit drugs (Fig. 3b). Eight drugs (Extended Data Table 1) were
identified as lead hits and further tested for their capacities to decrease the luciferase
signal in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 3). These drugs could
potentially function through blocking virus entry, by decreased cell survival, or even by
directly inhibiting luciferase activity. To distinguish these possibilities, the lead hit drugs

were tested in comparison to hPSC-COs infected with a control VSVG-luciferase
reporter virus. Four of the lead hit drugs showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoentry virus, including mycophenolic acid (MPA, Fig. 3c) (SARS-CoV-2: IC50=0.54 μM;
VSVG: IC50=6.4

quinacrine dihydrochloride (QNHC, Fig. 3d) (SARS-CoV-2:

chloroquine (SARS-CoV-2: IC50=6.8

IC50=19.1 μM), and resveratrol (SARS-CoV-2: IC50=5.7 μM; VSVG: IC50=39.3 μM) (Fig.
3e-g, and Extended Data Fig. 3). The IC50 of MPA is 10 times lower and the IC50 of
QNHC is 5 times lower than that of chloroquine, a drug recently authorized by the FDA
for emergency use to treat COVID-19 patients7. Immunostaining confirmed few
luciferase positive cells in hPSC-COs treated with 3 μM MPA or 4.5 μM QNHC at 24 hpi
(Fig. 3h). CO-explanted humanized mice were treated with 50 mg/kg MPA by IP
injection, followed by local inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus. At 24 hpi, the
mice were euthanized, and xenografts were analyzed by immunostaining. Luc+ cells in
the xenografts of MPA-treated mice were significantly lower than those of vehicletreated mice (Fig. 3i-k).

Finally, hPSC-COs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at MOI=0.1 or 0.01. At 24 hpi,
immunostaining detected the expression of SARS-CoV membrane protein in the
infected hPSC-COs, which partially co-localized with CDX2 and KRT20 (Fig. 4a). Bulk
RNA sequencing confirmed viral transcripts in the SARS-CoV-2 infected hPSC-COs
(MOI=0.1, Fig. 4b). The MOCK and infected hPSC-COs separated clearly into two
distinct clusters in a PCA plot (Fig. 4c). Differential gene expression analysis showed
striking induction of chemokine gene expression, including for IL1A, CXCL8, CXCL6,

CXCL11, and IL1B, yet with no detectable levels of IFN-I or IFN-III, which is consistent
with recent reports8-10 (Fig. 4d). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the differential gene
expression list highlighted the production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species,
oxidative phosphorylation, as well as IL-15 production (Fig. 4e). The hPSC-COs were
pre-treated with MPA or QNHC and infected with a relatively high titer of SARS-CoV-2
virus (MOI=0.1). Immunostaining confirmed the decrease of SARS-CoV-2+ cells in MPA
or QNHC-treated hPSC-COs (Fig. 4f). Finally, western blotting assays confirmed the
ability of MPA and QNHC to block SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells (Extended Data
Fig. 4).

In summary, we report that hPSC-derived COs express ACE2 and TMPRS2S2 and are
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is currently a lack of physiologically relevant
models for COVID-19 disease that enable drug screens. Previous studies were based
on clinical data or transgenic animals, for example mice that express human ACE2.
However, such transgenic animals fail to fully recapitulate the cellular phenotype and
host response of human cells11,12. We adapted a hPSC-derived CO platform for high
throughput drug screening. Using disease-relevant normal colonic human cells, we
screened 1280 FDA-approved compounds and identified MPA and QNHC, two drugs
that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. Strikingly, in this assay, the
efficacies of MPA and QNHC for blocking viral entry are more than 5 times higher than
chloroquine, a drug recently authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID19 patients. Moreover, the MPA concentrations effective in blocking viral entry and
replication are below that which is routinely used in clinical therapy13. MPA is a

reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase and is
used widely and safely as an immunosuppressive drug (mycophenolate mofetil;
CellCept) to prevent organ rejection after transplantation and for the treatment of
autoimmune diseases14. MPA has been reported to block replication of human
immunodeficiency virus15, dengue16, as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV)17. Several studies on MERS-CoV suggest that MPA may
noncompetitively inhibit the viral papain-like protease while also altering host interferon
response17,18. A recent study also predicts MPA would modulate the interaction between
host protein inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) and SARS-CoV-2
protein nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14)19. Furthermore, a clinical study of MERS-CoV
suggested that the patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil has 0% mortality rate,
which is significantly lower than the overall mortality rate as 37%20. QNHC (Acriquine®,
Atabrine®, Atebrin®, Mepacrine®) is an FDA-approved antimalarial drug used more
recently as an anthelmintic, antiprotozoal, antineoplastic agent, and antirheumatic21.
Recent studies have shown that quinacrine protects mice against Ebola virus infection in
vivo 22. Both MPA and QNHC can be considered candidates for clinical trials of COVID19 therapy.

Methods
hESC maintenance and colonic lineage differentiation
hESCs were grown and maintained on 1% Matrigel (Corning)-coated six-well plates in
StemFlex medium (Gibco) at 37°C with 5% CO2. For definitive endoderm (DE)
differentiation, hESCs were cultured to achieve 80-90% confluency, and treated with 3

μM

CHIR99021 (CHIR, Stem-RD) and 100 ng/ml Activin A (R&D systems) in basal

medium RPMI1640 (Cellgro) supplemented with 1X Pen-Strep (Gibco) for 1 day, and
changed to the basal medium containing only 100 ng/ml Activin A the next day. To
induce CDX2+ hindgut endoderm, DE were treated with 3

μM

CHIR99021 and 500

ng/ml FGF4 (Peprotech) in RPMI1640 supplemented with 1X B27 supplement (Gibco)
and 1X Pen-Strep (Gibco) for 4 days with daily changing of fresh media. Organoids
began to bud out from the 2D culture during the hindgut differentiation process. The
hindgut endoderm was then subjected to colonic lineage induction by treatment with
100 ng/ml BMP2 (Peprotech), 3 μM CHIR99021 and 100 ng/ml hEGF (Peprotech) in
Advance DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 1X B27 supplement (Gibco), 1X
GlutaMax (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco) and 1X Pen-Strep (Gibco) for 3 days with
daily changing of fresh medium. After colonic fate induction, the colon progenitor
organoids were collected from the initial 2D cultures and embedded in a 100% Matrigel

to achieve full colonic differentiation. The colon organoids were passaged and
expanded every 10 – 14 days at 1:6 density. To passage the organoids, the Matrigel
domes containing the organoids were scrapped off the plate and resuspended in cold
splitting media (Advance DMEM F12 medium supplemented with 1X GlutaMax, 10 mM
HEPES and 1X Pen-Strep). The organoids were mechanically dislodged from the
Matrigel dome and fragmented by pipetting in cold splitting media. The old Matrigel and
splitting media were removed after pelleting cells and the organoids were resuspended
in 100% Matrigel. 50 µL Matrigel containing fragmentized colon organoids were plated
in one well of a pre-warmed 24-well plate.

supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 100 I.U./mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin was added to the infected cells and they were cultured overnight as
described above. The next day, the supernatant was harvested and clarified
by centrifugation at 300g for 10 min and aliquots stored at −80°C.

SARS-CoV-2 Viruses
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), isolate USAWA1/2020 (NR-52281) was deposited by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in
Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM Lglutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM
HEPES. Infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay in Vero E6
cells in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 2% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.2%
BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 0.12% NaHCO3 and 0.7% agar. All work involving live SARSCoV-2 was performed in the CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility of the Global Health
and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in
accordance with institutional biosafety requirements.

To assay pseudo-typed virus infection on colon organoids, COs were seeded in 24 well
plates. Pseudo-typed virus was added at MOI=0.01 plus polybrene at a final
concentration of 8 μg/mL, and the plate centrifuged for 1 hr at 1200g. At 3hpi, the
infection medium was replaced with fresh medium. At 24hpi, colon organoids were
harvested for luciferase assays or immunostaining analysis. For chemical screening
analysis, colon organoids were digested by TrypLE and seeded in 384 well plates at
1x104 cells per well. After chemical treatment, pseudo-typed virus was added at
MOI=0.01 and the plate centrifuged for 1 hr at 1200g. At 24hpi, hPSC-COs were
harvested for luciferase assays according to the Luciferase Assay System protocol
(Promega).

SARS-CoV-2 virus infections
hPSC-COs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the CO media at an MOI of 0.1, 0.05 or
0.01 as indicated and incubated at 37°C. At 24 hpi, cells were washed three times with
PBS and harvested for either RNA analysis or immunofluorescence staining.

Approximately 2.5 × 105 Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with the indicated compounds
for 1 h prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 in DMEM supplemented
with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids,
1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. At 24 hpi, cells were washed three times
with PBS before harvesting for immunofluorescence staining or RNA or protein analysis.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer for protein analysis or fixed in 5% formaldehyde for 24 h
for immunofluorescent staining, prior to safe removal from the BSL-3 facility.

Colon organoid processing and immunostaining
The colon organoids were released from Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning)
on ice for 1 hr, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 hr at 4°C, washed
twice with 1X PBS and allowed to sediment in 30% sucrose overnight. The organoids
were then embedded in OCT (TissueTek) and cryo-sectioned at 10 μm thickness. For
indirect immunofluorescence staining, sections were rehydrated in 1X PBS for 5 min,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton in 1X PBS for 10 min, and blocked with blocking buffer
containing 5% normal donkey serum in 1X PBS for 1 hr. The sections were then
incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C
overnight. The following day, sections were washed three times with 1X PBS before
incubating with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for one hr at RT. The
sections were washed three times with 1X PBS and mounted with Prolong Gold
Antifade mounting media with DAPI (Life technologies). Images were acquired using an
LSM880 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Zeiss) and processed with Zen or Imaris
(Bitplane) software.

Immunofluorescent staining
Organoids and tissues were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at RT, blocked in Mg2+/Ca2+
free PBS plus 5% horse serum and 0.3% Triton-X for 1 hr at RT, and then incubated

The colon organoids cultured in Matrigel domes were dissociated into single cells using
0.25% Trypsin (Gibco) at 37°C for 10 min, and the trypsin was then neutralized with
DMEM F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. The dissociated organoids were pelleted and
resuspended with L15 Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, and 10
ng/ml DNaseI (Sigma). The resuspended organoids were then placed through a 40 µm
filter to obtain a single cell suspension, and stained with DAPI followed by sorting of live
cells using an ARIA II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The live colonic single cell
suspension was transferred to the Genomics Resources Core Facility at Weill Cornell
Medicine to proceed with the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v3 (10x Genomics,
product code # 1000075) using 10X Genomics Chromium Controller. A total of 10,000
cells were loaded into each channel of the Single-Cell A Chip to target 8000 cells.
Briefly, according to manufacturer’s instruction, the sorted cells were washed with 1x
PBS + 0.04% BSA, counted by a Bio-Rad TC20 Cell Counter, and cell viability was
assessed and visualized. A total of 10,000 cells and Master Mixes were loaded into
each channel of the cartridge to generate the droplets on Chromium Controller. Beadsin-Emulsion (GEMs) were transferred and GEMs-RT was undertaken in droplets by
PCR incubation. GEMs were then broken and pooled fractions recovered. After
purification of the first-strand cDNA from the post GEM-RT reaction mixture, barcoded,
full-length cDNA was amplified via PCR to generate sufficient mass for library
construction. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection were used to optimize the
cDNA amplicon size. TruSeq Read 1 (read 1 primer sequence) was added to the
molecules during GEM incubation. P5, P7, a sample index, and TruSeq Read 2 (read 2
primer sequence) were added via End Repair, A-tailing, Adaptor Ligation, and PCR.

The final libraries were assessed by Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer and
sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq sequencer with pair-end 100 cycle kit (28+8+91).

Sequencing and gene expression UMI counts matrix generation
T FASTQ files were imported to a 10x Cell Ranger - data analysis pipeline (v3.0.2) to
align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices and perform clustering and gene
expression analysis. In a first step, cellranger mkfastq demultiplexed samples and
generated fastq files; and in the second step, cellranger count aligned fastq files to the
reference genome and extracted gene expression UMI counts matrix. In order to
measure viral gene expression, we built a custom reference genome by integrating the
four virus genes and luciferase into the 10X pre-built human reference (GRCh38 v3.0.0)
using cellranger mkref. The sequences of four viral genes (VSV-N VSV-NS, VSV-M and
VSV-L) were retrieved from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/335873), and
the sequence of the luciferase was retrieved from HIV-Luc.

Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis
We filtered cells with less than 300 or more than 8000 genes detected as well as cells
with mitochondria gene content greater than 30%, and used the remaining cells (6175
cells for the uninfected sample and 2962 cells for the infected sample) for downstream
analysis. We normalized the gene expression UMI counts for each sample separately
using a deconvolution strategy24 implemented by the R scran package (v.1.14.1). In
particular, we pre-clustered cells in each sample using the quickCluster function; we

computed size factor per cell within each cluster and rescaled the size factors by
normalization between clusters using the computeSumFactors function; and we
normalized the UMI counts per cell by the size factors and took a logarithm transform
using the normalize function. We further normalized the UMI counts across samples
using the multiBatchNorm function in the R batchelor package (v1.2.1). We identified
highly variable genes using the FindVariableFeatures function in the R Seurat (v3.1.0)25,
and selected the top 3000 variable genes after excluding mitochondria genes, ribosomal
genes and dissociation-related genes. The list of dissociation-related genes was
originally built on mouse data26, we converted them to human ortholog genes using
Ensembl BioMart. We aligned the two samples based on their mutual nearest neighbors
(MNNs) using the fastMNN function in the R batchelor package, this was done by
performing a principal component analysis (PCA) on the highly variable genes and then
correcting the principal components (PCs) according to their MNNs. We selected the
corrected top 50 PCs for downstream visualization and clustering analysis. We ran the
uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction using the
RunUMAP function in the R Seurat25 package with training epochs setting to 2000. We
clustered cells into eight clusters by constructing a shared nearest neighbor graph and
then grouping cells of similar transcriptome profiles using the FindNeighbors function
and FindClusters function (resolution set to 0.2) in the R Seurat package. We identified
marker genes for each cluster by performing differential expression analysis between
cells inside and outside that cluster using the FindMarkers function in the R Seurat
package. After reviewing the clusters, we merged four clusters that were likely from
stem cell population into a single cluster (LGR5+ or BMI1+ stem cells) and kept the other

four clusters (KRT20+ epithelial cells, MUC2+ goblet cells, EPHB2+ TA cells, and CHGA+
NE cells) for further analysis. We re-identified marker genes for the merged five clusters
and selected the top 10 positive marker genes per cluster for heatmap plot using the
DoHeatmap function in the R Seurat package25.

In vivo transplantation and drug evaluation
hPSC-COs were harvested by cell scraper, mixed with 20 µl Matrigel (Corning) and
transplanted under the kidney capsule of 7-9 weeks old male NSG mice. Two weeks
post-transplantation, SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-entry virus was inoculated locally at 1x103
FFU. At 24 hpi, the mice were euthanized and used for immunohistochemistry analysis.

To determine the MPA’s activity in vivo, the mice were treated with 50 mg/kg MPA in
(10%DMSO/90% corn oil) by IP injection. Two hours after drug administration, SARSCoV-2 pseudo-entry virus was inoculated locally at 1x103 FFU. At 24 hpi, the mice were
euthanized and used for immunohistochemistry analysis.
All animal work was conducted in agreement with NIH guidelines and approved by the
WCM Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Institutional
Biosafety Committee (IBC).

To perform the high throughput small molecule screen, hPSC-COs were dissociated

℃ waterbath and replated into 10% Matrigel-coated 384-

using TrypLE for 20 min in a 37

well plates at 20,000 cells/40 µl medium/well. After 6 hr, cells were treated with
compounds from an in-house library of ~1280 FDA-approved drugs (Prestwick) at 10
µM. DMSO treatment was used as a negative control. One hour late, cells will be
infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudo virus (MOI=0.01). After 24 hpi, hPSC-COs were
harvested for luciferase assay following the Luciferase Assay System protocol
(Promega).

RNA-Seq following viral infections
Organoid infections were performed at an MOI of 0.1 and harvested at 24 hpi in DMEM
supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine and 1 μg/ml TPCKtrypsin. Total RNA was extracted in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and DNase I treated using
Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA-seq libraries of polyadenylated RNA were prepared using the TruSeq
RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) or TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA libraries were sequenced using an
Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Raw reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19)
using the RNA-Seq Aligment App on Basespace (Illumina, CA), following differential
expression analysis using DESeq227. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were
characterized for each sample (p adjusted-value < 0.05). Volcano plots were
constructed using custom scripts in R.
