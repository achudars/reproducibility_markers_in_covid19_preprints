Abstract
A recent estimate suggests that one in five deaths globally are associated with sepsis​1​. To date, no targeted
treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity​2,3 and our lack of insight
into sepsis immunopathology​4​. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein
many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis​5–8​. We previously
reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical
illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data​9​.
Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and
association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this
monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of
the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with
severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe
disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the
cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to
monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our
findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in
inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Main Text
Sepsis is associated with profound alterations in the peripheral immune compartment, including marked
reduction in lymphocyte counts​10–12 and phenotypic alteration of myeloid cells​13–15​. Monocytes from sepsis
patients have decreased responsiveness to stimuli​15–17 and have lower expression of HLA-DR​18–23
characteristic of monocytic MDSCs. In line with these findings, we recently reported an expanded CD14+
monocyte state in sepsis patients, MS1, reminiscent of monocytic MDSCs​9​. Previous studies have reported
opposing effects of MDSCs on sepsis outcomes​24–27​, warranting further investigation into their function and
association with patient prognosis. Signatures similar to MS1 have also been described recently in severe
SARS-CoV-2 infections​28,29​, but have not been systematically analyzed across multiple cohorts. Here, we
identify the gene expression programs associated with the MS1 cell state and determine their relationship with
disease severity in both bacterial sepsis and COVID-19. We identify circulating host factors that result in the
induction of the MS1 gene module, and characterize the response of MS1 cells to stimulation and their effects
on other cell types.
To characterize the gene expression program associated with the MS1 cell state, we analyzed existing
monocyte scRNA-seq data from sepsis patients and controls​9 using consensus non-negative matrix
factorization​30 (cNMF; ​Figure 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a-d​). We found a gene expression program that
includes the MS1 marker genes ​RETN,​ ​ALOX5AP​, and ​IL1R2 among the top 20 genes with highest loadings
(​Supplementary Fig. 1d​), has higher usage in sepsis patients (​Supplementary Fig. 1e, ​FDR < 0.001), and
correlates with the fractional abundance of MS1 cells in each patient (​Supplementary Fig. 1f​, r = 0.73, p <
0.001). This module negatively correlates with the usage of a class II major histocompatibility complex module
(MHC-II module, ​Supplementary Fig. 1g​), consistent with our observation that MS1 cells have lower surface
expression of HLA-DR​9​. Co-expression analysis within the MS1 module reveals that most genes are highly
correlated with ​S100A8 ​(​Figure 1b​), suggesting its role as a core driver of the MS1 gene expression program.
This gene and its partner ​S100A9 have been implicated in the development of MDSCs in cancer​31 and
sepsis​24,32​, indicating a similarity between monocytic MDSCs and the MS1 cell state.
Given its marked expansion, we hypothesized that expression of the MS1 program may be associated with
worse outcome in bacterial sepsis. Using the transcriptional data from our earlier study​9​, the usage of the MS1
program correlates with sepsis severity in ICU patients but not in patients presenting to the emergency
department with milder disease (​Supplementary Fig. 1h​)​. ​Using gene expression deconvolution, we
estimated the usage of the monocyte gene expression modules ​in 15 datasets included in a recent
meta-analysis examining sepsis mortality​33 (​Methods​, ​Supplementary Figure 1c, Supplementary Table 1​).
We found that expression of the MS1 program is negatively associated with patient survival (effect size = -0.32,
FDR < 0.01), whereas MHC-II module usage has the opposite effect (effect size = 0.53, FDR < 0.01; ​Figure
1c​). These results show that expansion of MS1 cells is associated with worse infection outcomes, suggesting
its prognostic value for sepsis patients.
To determine whether MS1 cells are similarly expanded in severe COVID-19, we analyzed four COVID-19
scRNA-seq datasets​7,28,34,35 independently and identified gene expression modules in CD14+ monocytes from
each dataset using an unbiased cNMF method (​Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure 2​). In each of the four
studies, we found gene expression modules corresponding to the MS1 and MHC-II modules, as evidenced by
their strong correlation (Pearson ​r >
​ 0.8) with modules from our sepsis data (​Figure 1d​). Similar to the trends
we observed in bacterial sepsis, CD14+ monocytes from patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A
infections have significantly higher and lower usage of the MS1 and MHC-II modules, respectively (FDR <
0.05; ​Figure 1e​), and have increased MS1 scores compared with controls (p < 0.01; Supplementary Figure

2​). ​These findings show that the MS1 cell state is expanded in both bacterial and viral sepsis syndromes,
suggesting its utility as a signature for infection severity regardless of etiology.
We previously demonstrated that MS1-like cells can be derived from immature progenitors through stimulation
of total bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) with LPS or Pam3CSK4​9​. Because BMMCs contain a
heterogeneous mix of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mature immune cells, potential
paracrine interactions among the cell types confound identification of the precise factors that cause MS1
induction. Given this limitation, we sought a method for inducing the MS1 program directly from CD34+ HSPCs
purified from bone marrow. We hypothesized that cytokines circulating in the blood of sepsis patients might
induce the differentiation of MS1 cells directly from HSPCs. Upon culturing HSPCs isolated from healthy
human bone marrow with plasma from urosepsis (URO) patients or healthy controls (Control) (​Figure 2a​), we
found that sepsis plasma significantly stimulated the production of monocytes and neutrophils compared with
healthy plasma (​Figure 2b​; p = 0.025 and 0.004 for CD34-CD11b+CD14+ and CD34-CD11b+CD15+ cells,
respectively). Single cell analysis of the differentiated cell populations showed clear trajectories of myeloid
differentiation (​Figure 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3a-b, Methods​); importantly, we observed that incubation of
HSPCs in plasma from URO patients resulted in the emergence of CD14+ cells with high MS1 scores
compared with Control (​Figure 2d; ​p < 0.01). cNMF analysis of the scRNA-seq data identified modules similar
to the MS1 and MHC-II modules derived from patient PBMC data, as evidenced by strong correlations
between their gene loadings (Pearson ​r = 0.73 and 0.78, respectively; ​Figure 2f, Supplementary Fig. 3c​).
The MS1 and MHC-II modules are also significantly up- or down-regulated (p < 0.01), respectively, in CD14+
cells derived from HSPCs incubated with sepsis plasma (​Figure 2f​). These data support our hypothesis that
cytokines circulating in the blood of sepsis patients can induce the differentiation of MS1 cells.
Due to the expansion of MS1 in severe COVID-19, we hypothesized that similar effects may be observed when
incubating HSPCs with plasma from severe COVID-19 patients. We performed the same experiments with
heat-inactivated plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with varied disease severity (C1-C4) and
uninfected controls (CN; ​Methods, Supplementary Fig. 3e-f, Supplementary Table 2​). Indeed, plasma from
patients who eventually died of COVID-19 (C4) stimulated the production of monocytes more strongly than
non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients (C1, FDR = 0.02; ​Figure 2c​). Compared with C1 plasma, C4 plasma
induced the production of CD14+ cells with higher MS1 scores (FDR < 0.01; ​Figure 2e​) and caused increased
and decreased usage of the MS1 and MHC-II modules, respectively (p < 0.01; ​Supplementary Fig. 3g-h​).
These findings further highlight the similarities between bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19, and support
our hypothesis that circulating factors from patients with severe disease stimulate the induction of MS1 cells.
Interestingly, upon incubation of HSPCs with URO plasma, we observed cells with high MS1 scores and a
module of genes similar to MS1 in the emerging neutrophil population (​Figure 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3c​).
Moreover, neutrophils sorted from critically-ill patients (ICU) and bacteremic (BAC) patients express a module
which includes ​S100A8 a
​ mong the genes with highest loadings (​Supplementary Fig. 4a-c​) and correlates with
the MS1-like module in neutrophils generated from incubating HSPCs with URO plasma (Pearson ​r = 0.58,
Supplementary Fig. 4d​). MS1 marker genes are also among the top differentially expressed genes in
neutrophils between healthy control subjects and ICU or BAC patients (​Supplementary Fig. 4e​). These
findings are consistent with previous reports of MDSCs having both granulocytic and monocytic subtypes​36​,
and further highlight the similarity between the MS1 cell state and MDSCs.
Analysis of the monocyte differentiation trajectory shows different pseudo-temporal dynamics of the MS1
genes (​Figure 2g​). Of note, a number of genes, including ​S100A8, VCAN, ​and ​MNDA​, are expressed early
and remain up-regulated during the differentiation trajectory (​Figure 2h)​. Short term stimulation (24 h) of
CD34+ HSPCs with sepsis plasma results in the up-regulation of these genes (​Figure 2i​, ​Supplementary

Table 3​) and an increase in the fraction of S100A8+ cells in the CD34+ population (​Figure 2j​). These genes
are among the core genes in the MS1 module (​Figure 1b​), and their up-regulation early is in line with our
hypothesis that ​S100A8 is an important factor driving the induction and differentiation of MS1 cells from
HSPCs.
To determine which circulating factors induce the increased production of myeloid cells from HSPCs, we
analyzed the levels of inflammatory cytokines implicated in cytokine storms​37 in the plasma of COVID-19
patients (​Supplementary Figure 5​). We found that IL-6 strongly correlated with higher production of CD14+
cells from HSPCs (​Figure 3a​), suggesting its involvement in the induction of emergency myelopoiesis. To test
this hypothesis, we added plasma from urosepsis or COVID-19 patients, or corresponding controls, to
IL6R-knockout or control CD34+ HSPCs and observed a marked reduction in CD14+ cell production across all
conditions for IL6R-knockout CD34+ HSPCs (​Figure 3b​). We also observed a reduction, albeit weaker,
specifically for URO and C4 plasma when wild-type HSPCs are differentiated in the presence of IL-6
neutralizing antibodies (​Figure 3c​). ​These findings highlight the role of circulating IL-6 in inducing emergency
myelopoiesis during severe infections.
To determine the specific cytokines that induce the differentiation of MS1 cells from HSPCs, we measured the
levels of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of sepsis patients and controls from a previous study​9​. Whereas
several cytokines displayed increased concentration in the plasma of sepsis patients (​Supplementary Fig. 6​),
we found that both IL-6 and IL-10 levels specifically correlated with the usage of the MS1 module in monocytes
(​Figure 3d​), suggesting their specific involvement in its induction, and consistent with the role of both cytokines
in MDSC expansion in cancer​38,39​. We found that short-term incubation of HSPCs with URO plasma, but not
Control plasma, resulted in phosphorylation of STAT3 (​Figure 3e​), the transcription factor downstream of both
cytokines​40,41​. In addition, short term treatment of HSPCs with recombinant IL-6 and/or IL-10 show a
dose-dependent up-regulation of the early MS1 genes ​S100A8​, ​VCAN​, and ​MNDA ​(​Supplementary Fig. 7a​)
and an increase in S100A8+ progenitor cells (​Supplementary Fig 7b​), similar to the effects observed with
sepsis plasma. To further test this dependence, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out the surface receptors for
IL-6 (​IL6RA ​and ​IL6ST​) and IL-10 (​IL10RA ​and ​IL10RB​) in CD34+ HSPCs before incubation in URO plasma
(​Methods, Supplementary Fig. 7c-d​). Knockout of either receptor resulted in the production of CD14+ cells
with lower MS1 scores (​Figure 3g​) and reduced expression of several, but not all, MS1 genes (​Figure 3h​). In
addition, in these experiments, the CD14+ cells displayed increased surface expression of HLA-DR, consistent
with the absence of the MS1 phenotype (​Supplementary Fig. 7e​)​. ​Altogether​, ​these results demonstrate that
the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 are necessary for the induction of the MS1 program from HSPCs with sepsis
plasma.
To test whether these cytokines are sufficient to induce the MS1 program, we differentiated CD34+ HSPCs
with IL-6, IL-10, or both, with and without GM-CSF and M-CSF, which are known growth factors that support
the differentiation of HSPCs into monocytes​42 (​Supplementary Fig 8​). We found that addition of GM-CSF and
M-CSF, and to a lesser extent, IL-6 or IL-10, increased the fraction of CD14+ cells produced by HSPCs, but
IL-10 decreased the absolute number of cells that are produced (​Supplementary Fig 8g​). Importantly, we
found increased expression of several MS1 genes in CD14+ cells generated from HSPCs treated with IL-6 and
IL-10 in the presence of GM-CSF and M-CSF (​Figure 3h, Supplementary Fig 8b​). cNMF analysis reveals
modules resembling the MS1 and MHC-II modules, both of which correlate significantly with the modules
derived from patient PBMC data (Pearson ​r = 0.57 and 0.66, p < 0.01; ​Figure 3i, Supplementary Fig 8e-f​).
The usage of these modules have opposite trends with cytokine treatment (​Figure 3j​), consistent with their
anti-correlation in the PBMC dataset (​Supplementary Fig. 1g​). These results suggest that MS1-like cells can
be induced by incubation of HSPCs with the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in the presence of GM-CSF and M-CSF,
enabling generation of large numbers of these cells for functional studies.

Given their similarity to MDSCs, we hypothesized that MS1 cells suppress the activation of T cells​43​. We
generated monocytes from CD34+ HSPCs either with GM-CSF and M-CSF alone (iMono), or with IL-6 and
IL-10 (iMS1), and co-incubated the cells with PBMCs activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We found that
incubation with iMS1 cells suppressed the proliferation of T cells, as evidenced by a reduction in the number of
cell divisions undergone by CD4 T cells after 4 days (​Figure 4a​). The suppression of T cell proliferation by
iMS1 also depended on the ratio of monocytes added to culture (​Figure 4b​)​. ​Consistent with this phenomenon,
we found that usage of the MS1 module in monocytes correlated negatively with the fraction of CD4+ T cells
among total PBMCs in sepsis patients and controls (Pearson ​r = -0.59, p < 0.01; ​Figure 4c​). A similar
suppressive effect was observed ​in vitro for CD8 T cells, but CD8 T cell levels were not correlated with MS1
module usage (​Supplementary Fig. 9a-c​). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that
MDSCs in sepsis patients have immunosuppressive effects on T cells​22,44​.
Sepsis is a systemic disease; thus, we tested the effects of co-incubating iMS1 cells with cell types from other
organs that are commonly dysfunctional in sepsis​45 (​Methods, Figure 4d​). We found that co-incubation of
iMS1 cells with TNF​α-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) ​resulted in lower expression
of cytokines and chemokines (​CXCL2​, ​CXCL8, IL6​) and down-regulation of the ​TNF​α signalling pathway
compared with iMono (​Figure 4e​, ​Supplementary Fig. 9d-e​, ​Supplementary Table 4​). iMS1 cells exerted a
similar albeit weaker effect on human renal epithelial cells (HRE), as evidenced by the down-regulation of a
number of ​TNF​α signalling pathway genes (​NFKBIA, ​CCL2​, ​TNIP2, RELB;​ ​Figure 4f, Supplementary Table
6​). Co-incubation with iMS1 also resulted in decreased expression of ​IL6,​ ​CSF1, ​and ​CSF2 in HREs (​Figure
4g​), suggesting a systemic negative feedback loop wherein MS1 suppresses its own induction. These effects
were not observed in HUVECs or in HREs incubated in conditioned media from iMS1 or iMono cells,
suggesting a cell-contact dependent effect (​Supplementary Fig. 9f​). ​Of note, co-incubation of HREs with iMS1
cells resulted in the up-regulation of ​MMP1,​ an important regulator of tissue remodeling and extracellular
matrix homeostasis that has been previously shown to be up-regulated during the development of sepsis​46​.
Similarly, ​PROS1,​ the gene encoding protein S, an important regulator of the clotting cascade, was also
upregulated in HREs co-incubated with iMS1, suggesting a possible involvement of MS1 cells in sepsis-related
coagulopathy​47,48​. These findings demonstrate broad anti-inflammatory effects of MS1 cells and, importantly,
highlight other potential functions of monocytes in sepsis beyond their response to pathogens and interaction
with other immune cells.
To examine the potential role of MS1 cells in COVID-19, we generated CD14+ cells from HSPCs using plasma
from mild (C1) or severe (C4) COVID-19 patients. As expected, the core MS1 gene ​S100A8 ​was the most
significantly up-regulated gene in CD14+ cells generated with severe COVID-19 plasma (​Figure 4h,
Supplementary Table 5​). Among the positively up-regulated genes, we found enriched pathways related to
inflammation and coagulation (​Figure 4i​), ​both of which contribute to the pathogenesis of severe
COVID-19​49,50​. Next, we stimulated C1- and C4-treated populations with high molecular weight (HMW)
poly-(I:C), a synthetic RNA analogue, or IFN-β, an important mediator of antiviral responses, and observed
weaker induction of various cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes in cells generated with C4 plasma in
response to poly-(I:C) (​Figure 4j​), whereas no such effect was observed in response to IFN-β. These results
reflect our findings in bacterial sepsis​9​, wherein MS1 cells showed a diminished response to
pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and are consistent with a recent report demonstrating functional
impairment of myeloid cells in COVID-19 patients​7​. Altogether, these findings suggest that the expansion of
MS1 cells in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is detrimental to the antiviral response and may play a role in the
pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.

In this study, we show that expression of the MS1 program is associated with poor outcome in both bacterial
and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, we show that systemic cytokines induce emergency myelopoiesis and
differentiation of HSPCs into myeloid cells that express the MS1 program, providing a potential explanation for
their expansion in bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19, and a model system through which these cells can
be generated and studied in greater detail. Importantly, our study reveals that induction of myelopoiesis and
the MS1 program depends on systemic IL-6, a current therapeutic candidate in COVID-19 infection​51​. Our
results suggest that the role of IL-6 in infection is complex and more extensive than just the induction of an
acute phase response​52​. Given the similarity between MS1 and monocytic MDSCs, we propose that the MS1
gene expression program provides a precise definition for monocytic MDSCs in peripheral blood. In fact, ~50%
genes expressed specifically in monocytic MDSCs vs monocytes, as found in a recent study​5​, overlap with
MS1-specific marker genes (​Supplementary Fig. 10​), though our MS1 signature contains many additional
genes, suggesting that we have identified a more pure MDSC-like population; however, analysis of additional
contexts in which MDSCs are found is warranted​43,54–56​. We also demonstrate that MS1 cells have an
anti-inflammatory effect on endothelial and epithelial cells, raising the possibility that MS1 contributes to the
pathology of these cell types during bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19. Whereas these findings suggest
several potential roles for MS1 during infections, whether it plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of bacterial
sepsis or severe COVID-19 must still be tested. Our study highlights the importance of hematopoietic
reprogramming in bacterial sepsis and severe COVID-19 and supports the hypothesis that the interaction of
MS1 cells with other cells and tissues impacts pathogenesis of severe infections.

METHODS
Bone marrow CD34+ progenitor isolation and culture
Purified CD34+ bone marrow cells from healthy individuals were either purchased directly from StemCell
Technologies or isolated from fresh human bone marrow. Bone marrow aspirates anticoagulated with EDTA
were purchased from StemExpress and processed within 24 h of isolation. To remove red blood cells (RBC)
from the bone marrow, 1X RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) was added directly at a 10:1 ratio to the sample.
After 5 min, the cells were centrifuged at 400g for 5 min and resuspended in 1X RBC lysis buffer to further
clear the sample of RBCs. The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in FACS buffer (1X PBS, 2.5% FBS,
2 mM EDTA, Invitrogen), and purified using human CD34 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated CD34+ cells
were validated using flow cytometry (CD34-BV650, clone 561; BioLegend) to be of >90% purity. Cells were
cryopreserved in Cryostor CS10 (Stemcell Technologies) in aliquots of 200,000 cells each. The tubes were
kept at −80 °C overnight, then transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.
For each experiment, CD34+ cells were first thawed and rested for 48 h in SFEM II (StemCell Technologies)
with 75 nM StemRegenin 1 (StemCell Technologies), 3.5 nM UM171 (StemCell Technologies), 40 ng/mL SCF,
TPO, Flt3L (PeproTech), and 1X penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were subsequently cultured in the same
medium supplemented with either 20% plasma sterilized through a 0.2 μm filter (Millipore) or 100 ng/mL of the
cytokines IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, and M-CSF (PeproTech). iMS1 and iMono cells were isolated after 7 d of
culture using human CD14 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated CD14+ cells were validated using flow
cytometry (CD14-FITC, clone M5E2; BioLegend) to be of >90% purity.
Flow cytometry for assessing myeloid output
To assess the number of myeloid cells from plasma incubation experiments, cells were stained with the
following panel: CD3-APC (clone HIT3a), CD19-APC (clone HIB19), CD56-APC (clone 5.1H11), CD14-FITC
(clone M5E2), CD15-AF700 (clone HI98), CD11b-PE-Cy7 (clone ICRF44), CD34-BV650 (clone 561), and
CD38-PE/Cy5 (clone HIT2) (BioLegend). After staining, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer with 2%
CountBright beads (Invitrogen) to allow determination of absolute counts during analysis. Flow cytometry data
were acquired on a Cytoflex LX (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo v10.1.
Single-cell RNA sequencing and data analysis
Single cell RNA-seq combined with cell hashing​57 was performed as previously described​9​. Briefly, cells from
multiple culture conditions were labeled with HTO antibodies (BioLegend) and loaded on the Chromium
platform using the 3’ v3 profiling chemistry (10X Genomics). Libraries were sequenced to a depth of ~25,000
reads per cell on a Nextseq 550 (Illumina). The data were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome using
cellranger v3.1 (10X Genomics). Due to their technical incompatibility with droplet-based platforms, scRNA-seq
of neutrophils was performed using plate-based Smart-seq2 as previously described​58​.
Single cell data analysis was performed using scanpy​59 with the same pre-processing and filtering parameters
described in a prior publication​9​. To identify the major cell types in the differentiation experiments, we assessed
the expression of the following marker genes: HSPCs: ​CD34 and ​CD38,​ monocytes: ​CD14 and ​LYZ,​
neutrophils: ​ELANE and ​MPO,​ megakaryocytes: ​PPBP a
​ nd ​PF4.​ MS1 scores were calculated for the top 30
genes from the MS1 module derived from the sepsis dataset using the ‘score_genes’ in scanpy (ctrl_size = 50,
n_bins = 25). RNA velocity analysis was performed using the scVelo package​60​ using the default parameters.
Consensus non-negative matrix factorization analysis was performed as detailed in a previous publication​30​.
Briefly, the top 3,000 variable genes for each dataset was first selected to filter the gene expression matrix.
NMF was then performed with k=5 to 25 (10 iterations for each k). The number of modules (k) for downstream
analysis was selected based on biological interpretability of the modules and stability of the cNMF solution. To
ensure that no modules from technical artifacts were analyzed, only gene programs with mean usage >10

across all cells were included for further analysis.
Bulk data deconvolution and meta-analysis
The gene loading matrix from cNMF analysis of monocytes was used to construct a reference matrix for gene
expression deconvolution. To reduce the number of genes in the reference matrix, only the top 1,000 variable
genes within the monocyte data were included. Sepsis datasets with survival annotation were obtained from a
previously published meta-analysis​33​. Gene expression deconvolution was performed using CIBERSORT​61
with a no-sum-to-one constraint and absolute scoring. The resulting score matrix was then used as an input to
MetaIntegrator​62​, where the effect size of each gene module was visualized using forest plots.
Sepsis plasma samples
Plasma samples from sepsis patients and controls were obtained from an existing cohort of patients described
in a prior publication​9​. Plasma samples were isolated ​by obtaining the top layer from Ficoll gradient separation
of whole blood (diluted 1:1 with 1X PBS) and were centrifuged again at 1000g for 10 min to remove cell debris.
Samples were immediately stored at −80 °C.
COVID-19 plasma samples
COVID-19 plasma samples were obtained from patients entering the Massachusetts General Hospital
Emergency department. This study was approved by the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board under
protocol 2017P001681. ​Patients presenting to the MGH ED from March through May 2020 with respiratory
distress suspected or known to be due to COVID-19 were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or
older, clinical concern for COVID-19 upon Emergency Department presentation, and acute respiratory distress
with at least one of the following: 1) tachypnea ≥ 22 breaths per minute, 2) oxygen saturation ≤ 92% on room
air, 3) a requirement for supplemental oxygen, or 4) positive-pressure ventilation. Patients were categorized
based on disease outcomes as follows: C1: non-hospitalized, C2: hospitalized without intensive care, C3:
hospitalized and admitted to intensive care, C4: hospitalized and eventually died, and CN: SARS-CoV-2
negative patients. Blood samples were collected upon hospital presentation. Plasma was obtained as
described above, but using whole blood diluted 1:2 in RPMI-1640. Prior to use in experiments, plasma samples
were quickly thawed at 37°C and incubated for 1 h at 53°C to inactivate viral particles. For the knockout and
scRNA-seq experiments, plasma samples were pooled across each patient category.
Blood samples for neutrophil sorting and scRNA-seq
Samples for neutrophil scRNA-seq were from patients enrolled in the Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s (BWH);
the criteria for patient recruitment for this cohort are described elsewhere​63,64​. Control samples consisted of
blood samples from age, gender, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls obtained from Research Blood
Components (MA, USA).
To maintain viability of neutrophils for scRNA-seq, fresh blood was collected in EDTA Vacutainer tubes (BD
Biosciences) and processed within 4 h. To remove red blood cells (RBC) from the sample, 1X RBC lysis buffer
(eBioscience) was added directly at a 10:1 ratio to the sample. After 5 min, the cells were centrifuged at 400g
for 5 min and resuspended in 1X RBC lysis buffer to further clear the sample of RBCs. The remaining cells
were stained with a general panel: DAPI, CD3-APC (clone HIT3a), CD19-APC (clone HIB19), CD56-APC
(clone 5.1H11), CD14-FITC (clone M5E2), CD15-AF700 (clone HI98), CD11b-PE-Cy7 (clone ICRF44)
(BioLegend). Single neutrophils were sorted using an SH800 cell sorter (Sony) into 10 μL TCL buffer (Qiagen)
with 1% β-mercaptoethanol (BME, Sigma) in individual wells of a 96-well plate.
Bulk RNA-seq processing and data analysis
Bulk RNA-seq was performed using Smart-Seq2​65 with minor modifications, as described previously​66​, using

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.280180; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

1,000 cells as input. All RNA-seq libraries were sequenced with 38 x 38 paired-end reads using a NextSeq
(Illumina). RNA-seq libraries were sequenced to a depth of >2 million reads per sample. STAR was used to
align sequencing reads to the UCSC hg19 transcriptome and RSEM was used to generate an expression
matrix for all samples. Both raw count and transcripts per million data were analyzed using edgeR and custom
python scripts.
Intracellular protein staining
Intracellular staining with S100A8-PE (clone REA917, Miltenyi Biotec) was performed using the
Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For staining of phosphorylated
STAT3 (Y705), cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 15 min at
room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with 1X PBS and resuspended in 95% ice-cold methanol
and left at -20°C overnight. The permeabilized cells were then stained with a pSTAT3-Y705 antibody (clone
13A3-1, BioLegend) for 30 mins on ice. Flow cytometry data were acquired on a Cytoflex LX (Beckman
Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo v10.1.
CRISPR-Cas9 editing of CD34+ HSPCs
Cas9 protein, pre-designed guide RNAs targeting ​IL6ST, IL6R, IL10RA, and ​IL10RB and non-targeting guide
RNAs (from GeCKO v2 library) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. RNP complexes were
assembled by combining 2.1 μL 1X PBS, 1.2 μL 100 μM gRNA, and 1.7 μL 10 μg/mL Cas9 protein and
incubating at room temperature for 15 min. The complexes were added to 50,000 - 100,000 CD34+ HSPCs
resuspended in 20 μL P3 (Lonza) and electroporated (program code DZ-100) using the 4D-Nucleofector
system (Lonza). After electroporation, the cells were immediately transferred to 500 μL of HSPC media and
rested for 48 h. Knockout efficiency in CD34+ HSPCs was assessed after 48 h via flow cytometry using the
following panel: CD34-BV650 (clone 561), CD38-PE/Cy5 (clone HIT2), CD126-APC (clone UV4),
CD210-PECy7 (clone 3F9) (BioLegend).
Plasma protein measurements
Samples from sepsis patients and controls were thawed and analyzed in parallel using the Legendplex Human
Inflammation for IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα and IL-18, and Human Hematopoietic Stem Cell
Panels for M-CSF and GM-CSF (BioLegend). Flow cytometry data were acquired on a Cytoflex LX (Beckman
Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo v10.1.
Samples from COVID-19 patients and controls were analyzed using a commercially available multiplexed
proximity extension assay (Olink Proteomics).
T cell co-culture and proliferation assay
T cell co-culture was performed as previously described​67 with minor modifications. Briefly, tissue-culture plates
were coated with 5 μg/mL purified anti-CD3 (clone HIT3a, Biolegend) at 4°C overnight and subsequently
washed twice with 1X PBS. PBMCs from a healthy donor (Research Blood Components) were labelled with
CFSE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. PBMCs were resuspended in SFEM II (StemCell
Technologies) with 5 μg/mL purified anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, BioLegend) and plated at a density of 1M
cells/mL. Isolated iMS1 or iMono cells were added at different ratios as indicated. The cells were left in culture
for 3-4 days, with media replenished after 2 days. At the end of incubation, the cells were stained with
CD3-AF700 (clone OKT3), CD4-APC (clone OKT4), and CD8a-PE (clone RPA-T8) (BioLegend) to determine
the amount of CFSE dilution within the T cells.
HUVEC and HRE co-culture and flow sorting
Primary HUVECs and HREs were purchased from Lonza and cultured in EGM-2 and REGM, respectively. To

improve cell viability, HUVECs were cultured in tissue culture plates pre-coated with Matrigel (Corning) diluted
1:100 in EBM-2 (Lonza) . Cells were used for experiments within 3-5 passages. Prior to co-culture, HUVECs
and HREs were treated with 10 ng/mL TNF​α (PeproTech) for 24 h. For the co-culture experiments,
CFSE-labelled iMono or iMS1 cells were added at a 1:1 ratio to a confluent monolayer of HUVECs or HREs
and incubated for 2 h. The cells were washed 3x with 1X PBS and detached by adding 1X Accutase
(Innovative Cell Technologies). The cells were transferred to FACS buffer after 15 mins, and 1,000
CFSE-negative cells were sorted into 10 μL TCL buffer (Qiagen) with 1% BME (Sigma) for bulk RNA-seq.
Conditioned media was prepared by incubating iMS1 or iMono cells at 0.5 M cells/mL in EGM-2 or REGM for
24 h overnight.
Stimulation of CD14+ cells generated from COVID-19 plasma
C1 and C4-plasma generated cells were isolated after 7 d of culture using human CD14 Microbeads (Miltenyi
Biotec). Isolated CD14+ cells were validated using flow cytometry (CD14-FITC, clone M5E2; BioLegend) to be
of >90% purity. Cells were stimulated for 4h with 100 ng/mL IFN-β (PeproTech) or 1 μg/mL HMW poly-I:C
(Invivogen). After stimulation, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and resuspended in 20 μL TCL buffer
(Qiagen) with 1% BME (Sigma) for bulk RNA-seq.
