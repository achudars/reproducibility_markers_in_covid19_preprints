Abstract

10

In December 2019 rising pneumonia cases caused by a novel β-coronavirus

11

(SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, which has rapidly spread worldwide causing

12

thousands of deaths. The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health

13

emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the

14

study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly

15

expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for

16

replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the

17

tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their

18

molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we

19

analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted

20

of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A/T bias in viral genes could

21

propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host

22

cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein

23

M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A/T in the third codon

24

position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce

25

collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery

26

due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of

27

candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2,

28

SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic

29

population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by

30

these viruses.The results presented here, settle the basis for further research in the field

31

of human genetics associated with the new viral infection, COVID-19, caused by

32

SARS-CoV-2 and for the development of antiviral preventive methods.

1. Introduction

36

Since its initial outbreak at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in late

37

2019, COVID-19 has affected more than 4 million people and caused more than 300

38

thousand deaths all around the world. Thereafter, scientists are focused not only on

39

studying the biology and dissemination of COVID-19 to control the transmission and

40

design proper diagnostic tools and treatments, but also theyare racing to design a

41

vaccine that could prevent the infection caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.This

42

virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus(β-coronavirus) of the Coronaviridaefamily, which

43

is

44

Alphacoronavirus(αCoV),Gammacoronavirus(γCoV)

45

(Chen et al., 2020a). Viruses from this family possess a single-stranded, positive-sense

46

RNA and thegenome ranges from 26 to 32 kb (Su et al., 2016).

47

Coronaviruses have been identified in several host species including humans, bats,

48

civets, mice, dogs, cats, cows and camels (Cavanagh, 2007; Clark, 1993; Wang et al.,

49

2006; Zhou et al., 2018). Since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by

50

the coronavirus SARS-CoV, emerged in southern China in 2002(Peiris et al., 2004),

51

several studies tracing the transmission and possible reservoirs for viruses have been

52

performed. In early 2007, it had already been warned that bats were a natural reservoir

53

for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic virusesas well as for a large number of

54

viruses that have a close genetic relationship with the coronavirusesthat causethe severe

55

acute respiratory syndrome. Furthermore, it was warned that these viruses possess more

56

risk than other pathogens for disease emergence in human and domestic mammals

57

because of their higher mutation rates(Wang et al., 2006).Moreover, legal and illegal

58

trading of wildlife animals propitiates the environment for cross-species virus

59

transmission contributing to the rapid spread of the viral infections around the

60

world(Wang et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2019) as already occurred with SARS and the

61

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Zaki et al., 2012). Both viruses have likely

62

originated in bats and are genetically diverse coronaviruses (Cui et al., 2019). Currently,

63

the outbreak of an atypical pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2

64

appears to have also startedfrom a zoonotic and a cross-species virus transmission at a

market in Wuhan including bats and pangolins,where animals were kept together and

66

the meat was sold(Chan et al., 2020).

67

Due to viruses replicate exclusively inside of living cells and depend exclusively

68

on the protein synthesis and chaperones machinery of their host, we speculated that the

69

primary structure of viral genes might be determined by the same forces that shape the

70

codon usage in the hosts’ genes. Thereby, viral molecular patterns and codon usage

71

preferences would be a reflection of the host machinery. Codon pair bias and

72

dinucleotide preferences of viruses have been suggestedas the main factors that reflect

73

the codon usage of their hosts. Indeed, virus attenuation by codon pair deoptimization is

74

used as an efficacious attenuation method of various small RNA viruses and has

75

resulted in the generation of superior experimental live virus vaccines (Coleman et al.,

76

2008; Mueller et al., 2010; Nouën et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015;

77

Yang et al., 2013).

78

In order to contribute to solving the sanitary emergence, here we provide a thorough and

79

comprehensive analysis that could help to understand the viability of the virus as well as

80

the susceptibility of the human host to the viral infection based on the molecular

81

patterns of their genes. Therefore, the main goals of ourwork wereto study the

82

molecular and evolutionary aspects of the human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2,SARS

83

and MERS andto determine the level of similarity of the codon usage and molecular

84

features betweenthe genes of human coronaviruses and the human genesin order to

85

identify the factors that are responsible for the codons selection in the viruses.Moreover,

86

we proposed to identify the essential viral genes for viral replication andhumangenes

87

whosetranslation machinery is involved in propitiating the system for viral replicationin

88

orderto determine whether the genetic population variability could be involved in

89

modelling the gene features andtherefore contributing to the human susceptibility to

90

viral infections.

2. Methods

92

Up to late April, a total of500 SARS-CoV-2 β-coronavirus genome became available.

93

The total available sequences of β-coronavirus were downloaded from the NCBI

94

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) including the reference genomes of

95

MERS (NC_019843), SARS (NC_004718) and SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) and were

96

classified according to their host. Different SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different

97

countries were pre-analysed but only reference genomes were retaineddue to the low

98

variability of the data.The genomes qualitywas assessed and the genomes containing

99

more than 10 gaps were discarded. CDS of representative viruses fromthe previous

100

classification were selected and analysed. Since human viruses have codon usage biases

101

(CUB) that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect (Miller et al.,

102

2017) we selected 463 highly expressed human genes in lungs tissues according to the

103

fold-change between the expression level in lung and the tissue with second-highest

104

expression

105

(https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue/lung). We considered valid CDS

106

when they started with an ATG codon, ended with an in-frame stop codon, and had no

107

undetermined nucleotides nor internal stop codons. The accession numbers of the

108

sequences that were used here can be found in Supplementary file 1.

109

The

110

http://codonw.sourceforge.net/). The total GC content of the CDS as well as the GC

111

content of the first (P1), second (P2), and third (P3) codon positions were calculated

112

using custom PERL scripts. To correct the inequality composition at the third codon

113

position (Sueoka, 1988), the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) were excluded

114

in the calculation of P3, and the two single codons for methionine (AUG) and

115

tryptophan (UGG) were excluded from P1, P2, and P3.

2.1. Codon usage indices

117

The following codon indices were calculated: relative synonymous codon usage

118

(RSCU) (Sharp and Li, 1987), the effective number of codons (ENc) (Wright, 1990),

119

codon adaptation index (CAI) (Lee et al., 2010; Sharp and Li, 1987), codon bias index

120

(CBI) (Bennetzen and Hall, 1982), the optimal frequency of codons (Fop) (Ikemura,

121

1981), General Average Hydropathicity (GRAVY) (Sharp and Li, 1987), aromaticity

122

(Aromo) (Lobry and Gautier, 1994) and GC-content at the first, second and third codon

123

positions (GC1, GC2 and GC3), frequency of either a G or C at the third codon position

124

of synonymous codons (GC3s), the average of GC1 and GC2 (GC12)and Translational

125

selection (TrS2).

126

ENc indicates the degree of codon bias for individual genes. Over a range of

127

values from 20 to 61, lower values indicate higher codon bias, while ENc equal to 61

128

means that all codons are used with equal probability (Novembre, 2002; Wright, 1990).

129

CAI values measure the extent of bias toward preferred codons in highly

130

expressed genes. CAI values range between 0 and 1.0, with higher CAI values

131

indicating higher expression and higher CUB (Lee et al., 2010; Sharp and Li, 1987)

132

under the assumption that translational selection would optimize gene sequences

133

according to their expression levels.

134

CBI is another measure of directional codon bias, based on the degree of

135

preferred codons used in a gene, like to the frequency of optimal codons. It measures

136

the extent to which a gene uses a subset of optimal codons. In genes with extreme codon

137

bias, CBI will be equal to 1, whereas in genes with random codon usage the CBI values

138

will be equal to 0 (Bennetzen and Hall, 1982).

139

Fop is a species-specific measure of bias towards particular codons that appear

140

to be translationally optimal in particular species. It can be calculated as the ratio

141

between the frequency of optimal codons and the total number of synonymous codons.

142

Its values range from 0 if a gene contains no optimal codons to 1 if a gene is entirely

143

composed of optimal codons (Ikemura, 1981). The determination of optimal codons was

144

carried out based on the axis 1 ordination, the top and bottom 5% of genes were

145

regarded as the high and low bias datasets, respectively. Codon usage in the two data

146

sets was compared using chi-square tests, with the sequential Bonferroni correction to

147

assess significance according to Peden(Peden, 1999). Optimal codons were defined as

148

those that are used at significantly higher frequencies (p-value < 0.01) in highly

149

expressed genes compared with the frequencies in genes expressed at low levels.

150

GRAVY values were calculated as a sum of the hydropathy values of all the

151

amino acids encoded by the codons in the gene product divided by the total number of

152

residues in the sequence of the protein. The more negative the GRAVY value, the more

153

hydrophilic the protein is, whereas while the more positive the GRAVY value, the more

154

hydrophobic the protein (Sharp and Li, 1987).

155
156

Aromo values denote the frequency of aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp)
encoded by the codons in the gene product. (Lobry and Gautier, 1994).

157

TrS2 estimates the codon-anticodon interaction efficiency revealing bias in

158

favour of optimal codon-anticodon energy and represents the translational efficiency of

159

a gene. TrS2 value > 0.5 shows bias in favour of translational selection according to

160

Gouy and Gautier (Gouy and Gautier, 1982; Uddin et al., 2017; Uddin and Chakraborty,

161

2018).

164

using CPBias (https://rdrr.io/github/alex-sbu/CPBias/) developed in R. as described by

165

Coleman et al.(Coleman et al., 2008). The CPS is defined as the natural logarithm of the

166

ratio of the observed over the expected number of occurrences of a particular codon pair

167

in all protein-coding sequences of a species. The CPB was used as an index and also to

168

determine the bias in CPS among the virus and host genes. The expected number of

169

codon pair occurrences estimates the number of codon pairs to be present if there is no

170

association between the codons that form the codon pair. It is also calculated to be

171

independent of codon bias and amino acid frequency (Coleman et al., 2008). A negative

172

CPS value means that a particular codon pair is underrepresented, whereas a positive

173

CPS value indicates that a particular codon pair is overrepresented in the analysed

174

protein-coding sequences. Codon pairs that are equally under- or overrepresented have a

175

CPS equidistant from 0. We calculated CPS for each of the 3,721 possible codon pairs

176

(61 x 61 codons).

177

2.3. ENc-plots

178

The ENc-plot was used to analyse the influence of base the composition on the

179

codon usage in a genome (Hartl et al., 1994). The ENc values were plotted against

180

GC3s values and a standard curve was generated to show the functional relationship

181

between ENc and GC3s values under mutational bias rather than selection pressure. In

182

genes where codon choice is constrained only by a G+C mutational bias, the predicted

183

ENc values will lie on or close to the GC3s standard curve. However, the presence of

184

other factors, such as selection effects, causes the values to deviate considerably from

185

the expected GC3s curve. The values of ENc range from 20 (when only one codon is

186

used per amino acid) to 61 (when all codons are used with equal probability). The

187

predicted values of ENc were calculated according to Hartlet al.(Hartl et al., 1994).

188

2.4. Clustering analysis

189

A total of 91variables of codon usage of viruses and human genes, including the

190

gene composition, RSCU frequencies and the indices described in M&M section,were

191

integrated into an input matrix to feed the clustering algorithm. The analysed variables

192

can be found in supplementary file 1. Hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distances

193

was performed. clValid package clustering algorithm was used to choose and validate

194

the best clustering method. Flexible Procedures for Clustering (fpc:https://cran.r-

195

project.org/web/packages/fpc/index.html) was used for bootstrapping (n=100) and

evaluate the cluster stability. Clustering method was used to establish genes groups

197

from codon usage similarities among virus and human genes.

2.5. Principal component analysis (PCA)

198
199

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the codon usage

200

variation among genes as the multivariate statistical method. The axes represent and

201

allow to identify the most prominent factors contributing to the variation among the

202

genes. Since there are a total of 59 synonymous codons (including 61 sense codons,

203

minus the unique Met and Trpand stop codons), the degrees of freedom were reduced to

204

40 at removing variations caused by the unequal usage of amino acids during the

205

correspondence analysis of RSCU (Greenacre, 1984). The data were normalized

206

according to Sharp and Li (Sharp and Li, 1987) in order to define the relative

207

adaptiveness of each codon (Peden, 1999; Suzuki et al., 2005), codon usage indices

208

described above were also included as variables. PCA analyses were performed using

227

content analyses, we performed phylogenetic analyses by implementing the GTR + G

228

model according to partition finder results. Firstly, a phylogenetic tree was constructed

229

(data not shown) using the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 reported in

230

humans from Spain, USA, Italy, South America, China, Korea Japan and Australia,the

231

references genomes of MERS and SARSand the viruses genomes isolated from bats,

232

pangolins, civets, hedgehogs, Bos taurus, and canids (Supplementary file 1). Since all

233

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences remained together in the same cluster we selected

234

representative viruses genomes randomly from each country and from each host and

235

constructed a final phylogenetic tree (Supplementary file 2). The topology of this tree

236

showed that SARS-CoV-2 samples diverge from a commonnode close to the bat virus

237

(Accession MN996532) and that all of them diverge from a common node very close to

238

pangolin viruses (Accessions MT040333, MT040334, MT040335, MT040336,

239

MT072864). From a distant node that contained the node of SARS-CoV-2 and also

240

clustereda set of bat viruses, SARS virus diverges and grouped within a node together

241

with Civets viruses, but also adjacent and very close to other bats viruses (Accession

242

KY417146, KT444582 and KY417150). MERS viruses grouped in a different node also

243

very close to other cluster containingbat viruses (Accession MF593268 and KC869678).

244

Furthermore, adjacent to this node we found hedgehogs viruses (Accession KC545383,

245

KC545386, MK679660, MK907286, MK907287 and NC_039207).

246

For further analyses of molecular features and codon usage properties of viral

247

genes, we selected the viruses according to the phylogenetic tree described above. First,

248

we identified the 3 nodes containing the human viruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS and

249

MERS. Then we selected the closest viruses to each human virus within the nodes and

250

classified them according to their hosts (bats, civets, hedgehogs and pangolins). From

251

the human viruses only the references MERS (NC_019843), SARS (NC_004718) and

252

SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512)were used. The total selected CDSs comprised104 viral

253

CDS.

3.2. Viral gene codon usage patterns

255

PCA of codon usage and molecular features of viral genesof SARS, MERS,

256

SARS-CoV-2 and related viral genes of the non-human host (bats, civets, hedgehogs

257

and pangolins) were performed in order to characterise the genes and distinguish

258

important gene features among the viral gene families and species. PCA showed that the

259

genes dispersed differentially according to the kind of gene rather than tothe host that

260

the viruses infect. The genesdistribution depending on the host was observedfor only

261

some genes(Figure 1 A and B).Most of the genes belonging to the same gene family

262

overlapped or positioned in a very short ratio from each other. The position for

263

nucleocapsid protein N is shared for all virusesexcept for SARS-CoV-2 that is the most

264

distant from the group followed by the ones of SARS and MERS. Regarding the

265

envelope protein E, the gene of civetsSARS and human SARSoccupied the same

266

positionwhile the gene of human SARS-CoV-2 and MERS distributed distantly from

267

the group and alsofrom each other. The genes that encode for the membrane

268

glycoprotein M also showed a distribution along positive axis 1. However,for thehuman

269

SARS-CoV-2 and hedgehog and bat MERSthese genes distributed away from the genes

270

of pangolin and bat SARS-CoV-2, human MERS and bat,civet and humanSARS toward

271

the inferior left quadrant.The main factors that contributedto the dispersion ofthese 3

272

genes (nucleocapsid protein N, envelope protein E and membrane glycoprotein M) were

273

CBI, Fop, TrS2, C3, C3s, CpG and GC.In addition, the membrane glycoprotein M

274

seems to be more influenced by the codon frequency of the codon TAC for Tyrosine

275

and CTG for Lysine. Whereas for hedgehogs MERS and human SARS-CoV-2 the

276

codons TAT for Tyrosine and TTA for Lysine as well as the GC bias, among others

277

contributed most. All of them are strongly influenced by the A/T composition in the

278

third codon position.On the other hand, the spike proteins S of all viruses distributed

279

toward positive values of PC2and were also highly influenced by the A/T compositionin

280

the third codon position. All these genes groupedvery closelyexcept for the gene of bats

281

and human MERS. Several ORF proteins occupied the same area overlapping or

282

positioning very close to each other.Other ORF genes such as ORF6, ORF8 and

283

ORF3of the human virus SARS-CoV-2 distributed distantly.

284

The CUBwas estimated based on ENc values. The values of ENc range from 20

285

(when only one codon is used per amino acid) to 61 (when all codons are used with

286

equal probability).Genes whose ENc values are lower than 50 are considered to have

287

skewed codon usage. All viruses presented a wide range of ENc values (26 <ENc< 58)

that varied mainly depending on the type of genes. The highest ENc median was

289

observed for the human MERS (ENc~50.40), followed by bats MERS (ENc ~49.64).

290

The hedgehogs MERS showed an ENc median of 47.70, being closer to the values that

291

SARS and SARS-CoV-2 presented. Civets SARS showed an ENc median of 47.76. For

292

bats SARS the ENc median was 47.80 and the ENc median for the human SARS was

293

47.66. The lowest ENc valueswere observed for the genes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

294

Bats SARS-CoV-2 showed a median ENc of 46.39. For pangolins SARS-CoV-2, the

295

ENc median was 44.80 and for the human SARS-CoV-2, the ENc median was 44.34

296

(Figure 1 C).

297

Codon bias of viral genes classified bythe type of gene or the gene

familyshowed that the envelope protein E presented ENc values that ranged from 42 to

299

61, being the genes of the human SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-CoV-2 the ones that

300

presented the lowest valuesof all the genes.Membrane glycoprotein M genes presented

301

ENc values that ranged from 43.32 to 61.00,andthe gene of hedgehogs MERS,the one

302

with the lowest value. The membrane glycoprotein M of Human MERS, Civets,bats and

303

human SARS showed virtually non-biased codon usage. The nucleocapsid protein N

304

showed ENc values that ranged from 49.08 to 55.30 being the human MERS gene,

305

followed by the bats MERSgene, the viral genes that presented the lowest values.

306

The genes that encode for the spike protein S presented ENc values that ranged

307

from 44.16 to 47.68. The gene of the humanSARS-CoV-2 showed the lowest ENc value

308

followed by the genes of bat and pangolin SARS-CoV-2. ORF genes presented ENc

309

values that ranged from 26.60 to 57.89, being the human SARS-CoV-2 the virus that

310

presented the lowest and the highest ENc value for ORF7 and ORF10 respectively.

311

3.3. CPB analysis between viruses and lung tissue highly expressed genes

312

Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed

313

proteins in the tissues they infect (Miller et al., 2017) we selected the highly expressed

314

genes in lungs tissue to compare the gene molecular features, CUB and CPB of SARS,

315

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS viruses in relation with human genes. Since viruses replicate

316

exclusively inside living cells, many viruses are influenced by host codon pair

317

preferences,being thereflectionof the CPB or CPS of their hosts. Therefore, CPSof viral

318

genes was evaluated and compared with the CPS of human genesin order todetermine

319

whether viruses that infect humans have similar codon pair preferences to their

320

host.Viral genes showed lower CPS frequencies than human genes. The median CPS for

321

the viral genes was 0.053 for civet SARS, 0.051 for bat SARS, and 0.053 for human

322

SARS. The median CPS that presented the MERS genes was 0.048 for hedgehogMERS,

323

0.046 for bat MERS and 0.037 for human MERS. SARS-CoV-2 showed median CPS

324

values of 0.064 for bat SARS-CoV-2, 0.065 for pangolins SARS-CoV-2 and 0.061 for

325

human SARS-CoV-2. The median CPS for highly expressed human genes in lungs was

326

0.11 (Figure 2A). We also calculated the median CPS of viral genes for each gene

family. The genes that encode for ORF7b and spike protein S were the genes with the

328

highest median of CPB values (0.081 and 0.061 respectively), followed by ORF3a and

329

nucleocapsid protein N (0.058 and 0.057) indicating that particular codon pairs are

330

overrepresented in these genes. Envelope protein E and the membrane glycoprotein M

331

showed values of 0.048 and 0.044 respectively (Figure 2B).

332

Furthermore, different CPB among the viral genes families of different

333

virusesspecies that infect different hostswere also observed (Figure 2C). Bat SARS

334

showed the highest CPB for ORF7b (~0.1) and ORF7a (~0.048). The human SARS-

335

CoV-2 showed the highest CPB values for ORF1a (0.089), ORF1ab (0.051),

336

nucleocapsid protein N (0.048) and spike protein S (0.042). Envelope protein E and

337

membrane glycoprotein M presented CPB values of 0.0005 and 0.02 respectively. In

338

pangolin SARS-CoV-2 the highest CPB value was for the spike protein S (0.060)

339

followed by ORF3a (0.037) and ORF8 (0.033) while inbat SARS-CoV-2 the highest

340

CPB

341

spike protein S (0.076) followed by ORF1ab (0.050).The highest CPB values for human

342

MERS genes were observedfor a non-structural protein (0.032) followed by the

343

spike protein S (0.021) and the nucleocapsid protein N (0.008). In bat MERS the highest

344

CPB value was for spike protein S(0.062) followed by ORF1a (0.022)and by the

345

membrane glycoprotein M (0.022).In hedgehog MERS the highest CPB value was for

346

ORF3a (0.049), followed by ORF1a/b (0.042)and the membrane glycoprotein M

347

(0.029).In orderto evaluate the fitness and specialization of the viruses in theirhosts, we

348

compared the CPS of the viral genes derived from the different hosts against the CPS of

349

highly expressed genes in human lungs tissue by performing CPS correlation analysis.

350

The 3721 codon pairs of all viruses were compared with the 3721 codon pairs of human

351

genes. Correlation analyses showed low R values with a not clear dependence on the

352

human host codon pairs (Supplementaryfile3).

360

Envelope protein E genes grouped in different clusters. Thethree SARS viruses

361

(civets, bats and human hosts) grouped with the bat and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 and

362

showed high and similar CPB values.Whereas the human SARS-CoV-2 grouped better

363

with the human and bat MERS, both showinghigh CPB values. Hedgehog envelope

364

protein E gene grouped distantly with ORF and hypothetical proteins.These genes

365

presented a high preference for the codon GCG for Alanine. Furthermore, the codons

366

GGT and CCT were preferable for Glycine and Proline respectively. The

367

hydrophobicity, CAI and Fop values are higher for SARS and SARS-CoV-2 genes.

368

The membrane glycoprotein M genes also appeared in different clusters. The

369

humanSARS-CoV-2 gene grouped with the human and bat MERS gene.Only the human

370

SARS-CoV-2 gene showed a preference for the codon GCA for Alanine and AGG for

371

Arginine. A preference for the codons CCA, ACT and GTT for Proline, Threonine and

372

Tyrosinewas also observed. However, this was the gene that presented the lowest CPB

373

value. The pangolin and bat SARS-CoV-2 gene grouped with the threeSARS genes in a

374

different clusterand showed a higher CPB. The hedgehogs MERS grouped distantly.The

375

codon CAC was observed more frequently for Histidine in the three SARS viruses.

376

Pangolin SARS-CoV-2 showed a preference for GAC for Aspartate and CCA for

377

Proline whereas the bat SARS-CoV-2 showed a preference for GGA for Glycine and

378

GTA for Valine.

379

The genes encoding for the spike protein S appeared in different clusters. For the

380

human SARS-CoV-2,this gene grouped alone with the genes that encode for

381

hypothetical and ORF proteins and showed high bias only for the codon TTG for Lysine

382

and GAA for Glutamate. The genes for the rest of the viruses clustered together with

383

other ORF genesand with the membrane glycoprotein M of hedgehogs, although

384

distantly.This analysis also showed that CPB is highly related to the dinucleotide bias.

385

In this cluster the genes that encode for the ORF genes showed low values of CPB,

386

being the lowest of all the clusters. Conversely, the genes that encode for the spike

387

protein S presented high CPB values.

393

SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS(Supplementary file 1). From a total of 463 human

394

genes, 70 genes (15.1%)grouped in clusters together with viral genes. These genes were

395

selectedand extracted to make an illustrating heatmap including both, human and all

396

viral genes (Figure 3).Furthermore, in order to figure out whether the viral genes that

397

composed particular clusters present codon pair frequencies that correlate with the

398

human genes of the same clusters, we evaluated the CPS of both, viral and human genes

399

for each block and the correlation between each other.

400

For SARS-CoV-2, 8 out of 12 genesgrouped with 40 human genes distributed in

401

4 clusters. The first cluster comprised3 viral genes: the nucleocapsid protein N, ORF1a

402

and ORF1ab together with 19 human genes: COL6A5 (3), OVCH1 (2), DNAH12 (2),

403

ROS1 (3), SCN7A, RP1, ABCA13 (4) and LRRK2 (3) and the CPS correlation was

404

R0.11 (p-val7.1x10-8). The CPB values for the human and viral genes were -0.04

405

and 0.15 respectively. The second cluster contained 2 viral genes: the spike protein S

406

and ORF7b together with 9 human genes: AGTR2, TMEM212, CALCRL, FMO2 (2),

407

FAM216B, CXCL10, MMP13 and SLC6A14. For this group, the CPS correlation

408

between viral and human genes was R0.21 (p-val0.0027) and the CPB values for the

409

human and viral genes were 0.05 and 0.12 respectively. The third cluster grouped only 1

410

viral gene, the envelope protein E, with 10 human genes: IFNG, ST8SIA6 (2),

411

SLC39A8 (2), CDC20B (3) and DCSTAMP (2), and the CPS correlation between viral

412

and human genes wereR0.29 (p-val0.0052) and the CPB values for the human and

413

the viral genes were 0.25 and 0.16 respectively. In the fourth cluster 2 human genes,

414

TSPAN19 (2)grouped with the viral genes ORF6 and ORF7a and showed a CPS

415

correlation of R0.5 (p-val0,0016). The CPB values for the human and viral genes

416

were 0.13 and 0.14 respectively.

417

For SARS virus (Supplementary file 5), 12 out of 14 genes grouped with 39

418

human genes distributed in 5 clusters. The first cluster contained 11 human genes:

419

AGTR2, TMEM212, CALCRL, FMO2 (2), FAM216B, CXCL10, MMP13, SLC6A14,

420

and BCL2A1 (2) and 7 viral genes: envelope protein E, hypothetical proteins (5) and

421

membrane glycoprotein M.The CPS correlation for human and viral genes was

422

R0.28 (p-val2x10-16). The second cluster was composed of 7 human genes:

423

C7orf77, SNTN (2), MUC1 (2) and WIF1 (2).The CPS correlation between human and

424

viral genes was R0.77 (p-val0.00078). The third cluster consisted of 19 human

LRRK2 (3) and 2 viral genes: ORF1a and ORF1ab. The CPS correlation between

428

human and viral genes was R0.31 (p-val2.2x10-16). The fourth cluster was

429

composed of 2 TSPAN19 human genes and one viral hypothetical protein. CPS

430

correlation for this cluster was statistically not significant.

431

For MERS virus (Supplementary file 6), the 10 genes grouped into 6 clusters

432

together with 65 human genes. The first cluster comprised 19 human genes: COL6A5

433

(3), OVCH1 (2), DNAH12 (2), ROS1 (3), SCN7A, RP1, ABCA13 (4) and LRRK2 (3)

434

and 2 viral genes: ORF1a and ORF1b. CPS correlation for human and viral genes was

435

R0.29 (p-val0.021). The second cluster was composed of 8 human genes: AGTR2,

436

TMEM212, CALCRL, FMO2 (2), CXCL10, MMP13 and SLC6A14 and 1 viral gene

437

that encodes for the spike protein S.The third cluster contained 6 human genes:

438

CLEC12A (3), FAM216B, DNAAF6 and PIH1D3 and 3 viral genes: non-structural

439

protein (2) and the nucleocapsid protein N. The fourth cluster consisted of 7 human

440

genes:

441

SNTN(2), MUC1 (2) and WIF1 (2) and 1 viral gene encoding for a non-structural

442

protein. The fifth cluster was composed of 9 human genes: ST8SIA6 (2), SLC39A8 (2),

443

CDC20B (3) and DCSTAMP (2) and 2 viral genes: non-structural protein and

444

membrane glycoprotein M. The sixth cluster comprised 16 human genes: CLEC6A,

445

IL1RL1 (2), VNN2 (4), RTKN2 (2), SDR16C5 (3), IL18R1 (2), ACADL, and

Furthermore, we observed that 28 out of 70 human genes comprised a core of

448

genes that appeared into the clusters together with the viral genes for the three human

449

viruses (Figure 4 and Table 1). Between MERS and SARS-CoV-2 only 9 human

450

geneswere shared, 7 genes were shared between onlyMERS and SARS and 2 genes

451

were shared between only SARS-CoV-2 and SARS. The 28 human genes that appeared

452

in the clusters together with the genes of the 3 human viruses were retrieved against

(https://www.disgenet.org/) in order to classify the human diseases associated with the

455

malfunction of the identified genes as an approach for possible human diseases or

456

collateral effects caused by the viral infections (Supplementary file 1). According to

457

PheGenI and DisGeNET,14 out of the 28 genes were associated with 27 diseases. All

458

the diseases appeared in nearly equal proportions. A slightly higher frequency was

4. Discussion

464

In humans, coronaviruses cause mainly respiratory tract infections.Previously,
theβ-

465

six

466

coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, responsible for severe and potentially fatal

467

respiratory tract infections (Yin and Wunderink, 2018). In December 2019 rising

468

pneumonia cases caused by a novel β-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan,

469

China. The disease was officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was

470

found that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to the bat

471

coronavirus RaTG13, whereas it shares 79.5% of identity to SARS-CoV. It has been

472

proposed that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats or unknown intermediate

473

hosts that could involve pangolins, crossing the species barrier into humans. (Guo et al.,

474

2020). Rather, bats are the natural reservoir of a wide variety of coronaviruses,

475

including SARS-CoV-like and MERS-CoV-like viruses (Banerjee et al., 2019;

476

Hampton, 2005; Li et al., 2005).

coronaviruseswere

identified

as

human-susceptible

viruses,

being

477

Up to late April, a total of  500 SARS-CoV-2 β-coronavirus genomes became

478

available and this number is continuously increasing at an unprecedented rate. In our

479

studies, we analysed the coronaviruses from different host species and retrieved the

480

phylogeny in order to select the best candidate genomes for further analysis of codon

481

usage and molecular relationship with the human host. As previously reported, we

482

found that for SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS, bats seem to be a common natural host

483

or reservoir.

484

Because viruses do not have tRNAs and rely on host cell machinery for

485

replication, co-evolution between RNA viruses and their hosts' codon usages have been

486

observed (Franzo et al., 2017; Rahman et al., 2018; Simón et al., 2017). Furthermore,

487

the adaptation of viruses that replicates in multiple hosts should involve a trade-off

488

between precise and functional matching to fit the diverse tRNA pools of multiple hosts

489

(Tian et al., 2018). Conversely, single host viruses are expected to have specialised to

490

match the host tRNA repertoire.

491

Since human viruses have CUB that matches highly expressed proteins in the

492

tissues they infect (Miller et al., 2017) we selected the highly expressed genes in lung

493

tissues to compare gene molecular features of SARS-CoV-2,SARS and MERS in

494

relation with human genes. In general, in our studies for all the analysed viruseswe

495

found that the total gene repertoire had a similar ENc average that differs only 1 unit

496

with respect to their non-human host they come from, reflecting the molecular features

497

of their original host. Furthermore, as demonstrated in our clustering analysis, codon

498

pair usage seems to be dependent on the dinucleotide bias and the human CPB was

499

higher for human genes than for viruses genes as previously reported (Kames et al.,

500

2020; Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016).

501

Moreover, our analyses allowed us to distinguish not only the main factors that

502

contribute to the distribution of the genes along the axes in PCA, but also to determine

503

some particular different features among human and non-human viruses in specific

504

genes that could be important for explaining the virus infection evolution. In contrast to

505

SARS-CoV-2 of bats and pangolins, human SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a differential

506

distribution in particular genes that depended mostly on the A/T content in the third

507

codon position, which is in accordance with human SARS-CoV-2 gene composition

508

reports (Alnazawi et al., 2017; Alonso and Diambra, 2020; Kames et al., 2020; Tort et

509

al., 2020).

510

Important viral genes such as the membrane glycoprotein M, that is involved in

511

the membrane transport of nutrients, the bud release, the formation of the envelope, the

512

virus assembly and in the biosynthesis of new virus particles (Guo et al., 2020),

513

distributed differentially from the non-human viruses indicating that it is highly

514

influenced by A/T content. Surprisingly, this gene was positionednear of the hedgehog’s

515

MERS gene, suggesting similar molecular patterns between two distant viruses.

516

The envelope protein E, that functions as an ion channel and regulates virion

517

assembly and the immune system of the host (Guo et al., 2020; Yin and Wunderink,

518

2018), showed the same tendency toward A/T ending codons for the human viruses

519

SARS-CoV-2 and MERS. Human genes using A/T ending codons is also a common

520

feature in several human genes since they present a wide rate of GC content (27-97%)

521

(Bernardi, 2015; D’Onofrio et al., 1991). Both, membrane glycoprotein M and envelope

522

protein E genes have a higher CUB in comparison with human MERS and SARS which

523

is not in accordance with the trade-off theory that postulates that cross-species virus

524

transmission demands relaxing the codon usage pattern (Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016).

525

However, this phenomenon could be explainedby a selection pressure in favour of the

526

virus replication in the new host or due to the recent cross-species virus transmission as

527

we know it occurred. If this is the case, the analysis of newisolates from infectedhumans

528

should tend to show incremented ENc values for the envelope protein E and membrane

529

glycoprotein M genes.

530

Nevertheless, only the envelope protein E clustered together with human genes,

531

demonstrating similar molecular patterns that could mean an advantage for virus

532

replication in humans facilitating the virion assembly and the regulation of the immune

533

system of the host. Furthermore, positive CPB and an incremented CPS correlation for

534

the cluster that grouped the envelope protein E with human genes supports the

535

hypothesis of a facilitated translation depending on codon usage and codon pairs.

536

Similar patterns were observed for ORF6 and ORF8genes, which are involved in the

537

viral pathogenesis, apoptosis induction and inflammatory responses in the host (Chen et

538

al., 2020b; Diemer et al., 2010). These genes grouped with human genes in different

539

clusters and showed also and incremented CPS correlation.

540

Studies in different viruses species have reported high conservation of the genes

541

that encode for the nucleocapsid protein N among virus families (HORNE, 2013; Kunec

542

and Osterrieder, 2016; Masters, 2019; Nathan and Scobell, 2012; Parker and Masters,

543

1990). Therefore, it is expected that codon usage and molecular patterns present similar

544

features as observed in our studies. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene

545

tends to distribute slightly far from the rest of viruses’ capsids genes and toward a

546

higher A/T content in PCA. Both, the human SARS and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid

547

protein N present high CPB suggesting a specialization acquirement in the human host.

548

Two viral genes that also present high CPB are ORF1a/b, that encodes for the

549

replicase complex (polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab) and the Spike protein S that

550

participates in the early viral infection by attaching to the host receptor ACE2 and

551

mediating the internalization of the virus (Guo et al., 2020). In our studies, ORF1a/b

552

grouped with the gene that encodes for the nucleocapsid protein N, indicating that their

553

molecular features are highly conserved and are also presentin several human genes.

554

This result is in concordance with previous works that proposed these genes as

555

candidates for deoptimization for the design of attenuated vaccines due to their high

556

positive CPB values (Kames et al., 2020). Instead, the gene that encodes for the spike

557

protein S, grouped with ORF7 (involved in viral pathogenesis and apoptosis induction)

558

that also presents high and similar positive CPB values. For all of them, a higher rate of

559

A/T composition in the third codon position was observed. Changes in the third position

560

produce synonymous substitutions that could have conducted to a codon optimization in

561

human cells using the host machinery that translates only genes whose molecular

562

features match the viral needs. Some viral genes seem to have been favoured for an

563

increased viral replication in humans and optimized by using or mimicking some

564

particular molecular patterns of human genes. But only some genes, such as the

565

envelope E, the ORF 6 and 8, could be the key for an exacerbated viral pathogenesis.

566

Furthermore, because of these molecular and codon usage similarities between some

567

highly expressed human genes and viral genes that occupy the same clusters, the

568

translation machinery of the host could propitiate the translation of viral genes to the

569

detriment of human gene expression in lung tissues.Indeed, mistranslation or de-

570

regulation of protein synthesis has been reported as a consequence of tRNA miss-

571

modification and imbalanced tRNA expression, causing diseases(Lant et al., 2019).

572

Recent studies have also proposed that an unbalance in the tRNAs pools of the infected

573

cells could occur and would explain the collateral effects observed in some viral

574

infections (Alonso and Diambra, 2020). Since COVID-19 outbreak, several studies

575

associated with different pathologies have been performed in orderto find out how

576

damaging this new virus is for the human being. Hereby, in our studies we provided a

577

list of human genes that could be particularly affected as a consequence oftheir

578

molecular similarities with viral genes, not only belonging to SARS-CoV-2 but also to

579

SARS andMERS. The malfunction of these genes has been associated with different

580

human pathologies and is in continuous increase. Patients infected with COVID-19

581

typically present fever and respiratory symptoms.Nevertheless, it has been reported an

582

increased risk for complications of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and

583

atherosclerosis conducting to anincreased presence of cardiovascular comorbidities

584

(Clerkin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020).Also, some patients have

585

experimented

586

complications (Bridwell et al., 2020; Dugue et al., 2020), and complications associated

587

with the endocrine and urogenital systems,among others (Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al.,

588

2020). Diseases and collateral effects caused by COVID-19 infections could be a

589

consequence of the malfunction of the genes listed in our work. Therefore,they should

590

be considered to be incorporated into susceptibility population studies for respiratory

591

viral infections.Hereby, these results lay the groundwork for further research in the field

592

of human genetics associated with the new viral infection, COVID-19, caused by

593

SARS-CoV-2 and for the development of antiviral preventive methods.

In our study, we described the main factors that shape CUB in SARS-CoV-2,

596

SARS and MERS in comparison with highly expressed genes in human lung tissue and

597

revealed matching features with human genes that could have favoured the virus for an

598

incremented pathogenesis. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes

599

that could be involved in the viral infection and had not been described yet which could

600

be the key for explaining collateral effects and the human susceptibility to viral

infectionsandshould be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies.
