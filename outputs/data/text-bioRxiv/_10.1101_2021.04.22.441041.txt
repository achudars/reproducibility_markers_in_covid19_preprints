ABSTRACT
A new coronavirus epidemic COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses serious threat across continents, leading to the World Health
Organization declaration of a Public Health Emergence of International Concern. In order to
stop the entry of the virus into human host cell, major therapeutic and vaccine design efforts
are now targeting interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the human
cellular membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme, hACE2. By analysing cryo-EM
structures of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, we report here that the homotrimer SARS-CoV2 S receptor-binding domain (RBD) that bind with hACE2 has expanded in size with a large
conformational change of its AA residues relative to SARS-CoV-1 S protein. Protomer with
the up-conformational form RBD that only can bind with hACE2 showed higher intermolecular
interactions at the interface, with differential distributions and the inclusion of two specific Hbonds in the CoV-2 complex. However, these interactions are resulted in significant reductions
in structural rigidity, favouring proteolytic processing of S protein for the fusion of the viral
and cellular membrane. Further conformational dynamics analysis of the RBD motions of
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 point to the role in modification in the RBD conformational
dynamics and their likely impact on infectivity.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with the current
disease outbreak COVID-19 that spread over more than 200 countries and infected several
millions of people worldwide. The first coronavirus outbreak of SARS-CoV-1occurred in 2002
and the second outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was
in 2012. Rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the continents has leaded
the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of Public Health Emergence of
International Concern on January 30th, 2020. Although there is large heterogeneity in disease
transmission, SARS-CoV-2 spread is much faster relative to the other two previous outbreaks
[1,2]. Here we identify essential structural differences that contribute to higher transmissibility
of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV-1.
Coronavirus (CoV) entry into human host cell is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S)
glycoprotein protruding from the viral surface. With the use of this S protein, which is a trimeric
class I fusion protein, CoV-1hijack the human receptor membrane protein angiotensinconverting enzyme 2(hACE2) highly expressed in lungs, heart, kidneys and intestine cells [3].
The S protein protomer is made of two subunits, S1 and S2, which are responsible for receptor
recognition and membrane fusion. The S1 unit comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
that bound with the peptidase domain (PD) of hACE2 and it contributes to stabilization of the
prefusion conformation state. Receptor-binding destabilizes the prefusion state, resulting in
shedding of S1 unit and priming of S2 for membrane fusion. S-protein is then cleaved further
by the host proteases at S2’ site located immediately upstream of the fusion peptide, triggering
the protein for membrane fusion with stable conformational modification [4]. This essential
entry process is an important target for antibody mediated neutralization.
SARS-CoV-2 S protein holds 98% sequence similarity with the bat coronavirus RaTG13. A
most critical variation observed in CoV-2 due to an insertion “RRAR” furin recognition site at
S1/S2 junction, while SARS-CoV-1has single arginine at that site. Besides this insertion, ~60%
residual substitutions are noted at the RBD domains [5]. Revealing how such differences
contribute to higher recognition capability of hACE2 receptor is important to underpin the
therapeutic target that can prevent virus entry. Here, we have analysed respective protomers of
four S-protein cryo-EM structures: SARS-CoV-1 (pdb id: 6CRZ) [6], SARS-COV-2 (pdb id:
6VYB) [4] (Fig.1), SARS-CoV-RBD-hACE2 complex (pdb id: 2AJF) [7], and SARS-CoV-2RBD-hACE2 complex (pdb id: 6M17) [8]. These analyses revealed that SARS-COV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1with the RBD of up-conformational form can only bind with hACE2. Relative to
this up-form CoV-RBD, CoV-2-RBD has expanded its net surface area, with large local
conformational changes of AA resides, higher RMSD of C atoms and relatively large
amplitude anti-phase-like RBD motion in the slow-motion second normal mode. It has further
been shown that much closer interactions between CoV-2-RBD and hACE2 are resulted in
significant loss of structural rigidity, triggering proteolytic processing of S protein for
membrane fusion.

Fig.1 Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-1 and 2; It is a trimer (represented with three different colours)
protruded from virion surface and responsible for the receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Here, both the
spike proteins have retained one of the monomers with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of up-conformational
form (cyan colour) which can only bind with the human receptor hACE2.

Results
High variability of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
Coronavirus (CoV) spike glycoprotein (S protein) protruded from virion surface is responsible
for the receptor recognition and membrane fusion, which are essential steps for viral entry into
the host cell [9]. The S1 unit of S protein contributes to receptor recognition and priming of S2
unit for membrane fusion. In order to recognize host receptor, the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational motions. In a recently reported structure of
SARS-CoV-2, it has observed that human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(hACE2) can only
bind with the RBD (residues 336-518) having up-conformational state. Peptidase domain (PD)
of hACE2 clashes when all the RBD domains of the homotrimer SARS-CoV-2 S are in down
conformational state. To identify characteristic differences between the up-RBD of SARSCoV-1and CoV-2, we superimpose both the structures with and without the binding of hACE2
(Fig.1A). Despite a number of sequence variations, structural alignments show overall
similarities (Fig.2A) in most portions. However, RBD AA residues showed ~2 fold higher root
mean squared deviation (RMSD) from the average level of ~2.0 Å. In contrast, bound RBD
have a very high RMSD variation (Fig.2B) and shows lower than the average value for many
residues. Moreover, we have plotted Ramachandran plot for bound-RBD in both the complex.
It displays large changes in phi and psi dihedral angles for most of the RBD residues in
favourable and allowed regions of the plot (Fig.4B). All together, these results indicate
characteristic conformational differences in hACE2-bound and non-bound RBD between
SARS-CoV-1and SARS-CoV-2.

dissimilarities by producing residue pairing with the inputs of AA sequences and secondary structural elements.
After superposition, it uses the usual Euclidian distance formula for calculating RMSD in angstrom unit. (B) Left

high deviations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Differential RBD motions between CoVs
Significant conformational changes are commonly reflected in the differential domain motions.
To capture such differences, we have conducted normal mode analysis using combine
approaches of Gaussian network model (GNM) and anisotropic-network model (ANM) in
DynOmics webserver and in iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org). This hybrid model has
efficiently captured the dynamic differences between SARS-CoV-1and SARS-CoV-2 with and
without hACE2 bound. With the trimeric CoV-1and CoV-2 macromolecular structure, we have
calculated covariance matrix in the iMODS webserver which is computed using the 𝐶𝛼
Cartesian coordinates and the Karplus equation of collective motion in protein. This covariance
matrix signifies coupling between pairs of residues (Fig.3A,B). Overall, covariance patterns
are very similar for CoV-1and CoV-2; however, there are few sharp differences in few spots
of the covariance matrices.

Fig.3. Coupling between pairs of residues-a covariance matrix with positively correlated (red), uncorrelated
(white) or anti-correlated (blue) motions (prepared in iMODS webserver http://imods.chaconlab.org)

As usual, such differences are prominent in the low-frequency normal modes. To examine
the internal residual coupling and its effects, we have studied low-frequency normal modes for
RBD-up monomer of both the structures and noted that the second normal mode capable to
effectively capturing these differences. It shows that RBD has relatively high amplitude
motions for both the CoVs without hACE2 binding, while the S2-unit holds lower-amplitude
motions (Fig. 4A). When we compare this prefusion up-form RBD local motion along the
residues of CoV-1and CoV-2, it shows that the extended RBD region follows anti-phase like
dynamics; CoV-2-RBD has positive eigenvectors in oppose to negative eigenvectors of CoV1-RBD (Fig.4D). In contrast, these anti-phase dynamics are mostly vanished due to hACE2
binding. hACE2 binding makes the RBD relatively stable, with little faster movements of CoV2-RBD (Fig.4A, C).

to differentiate between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with and without hACE binding. (A) Its RBD-up
conformation region in the S1-unit has higher mobility relative to other parts of the S-protein. In contrast, hACE2

dots represent CoV-2-RBD AA residue phi-psi position, while black is for CoV-1complex. It shows significant
conformational changes in the RBD. (C) Residue-wise eigenvectors of bound RBD AA residues is representing
low-frequency motions. There are no significant differences in bound RBD motions between both the SARSCoV-1complexes. (D) Without hACE binding, RBD up-conformation protomer is showing significant differences
in the domain motion in the RBD regions. It is like anti-phase-type dynamics between the two CoVs structures.

Two representative conformational states for each SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 were
considered for the analysis of dynamical features: the whole spike protein with one RBD in the
open state and the single RBD domain bound to the ACE2. The Figure S1 and the Figure 5
illustrate initial conformations of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with one RBD
in the up state. The Figure S1 shows the side and top views of both spike proteins, with RBD
up in front, with RBD-up are the most at the bottom. In these figures different colored domains
represent different chains. The domain in green represent chain A, the domain in cyan chain B

and in magenta chain C. For the SARS-CoV-1 case, RBD in the up state belongs to the chain
A, whereas the SARS-CoV-2 the up state is in the chain B.
Figure 5A, B represent the ensemble of superimposed snapshots produced by FRODAN
for both spike proteins at energy cut-off -1.0 kcal/mol. This representation qualitatively gives
impression about the sampled conformational space by individual protein domains. Various
fluctuation scales are present in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The largest
fluctuations in both exhibit the RBD that is in the up state. While comparing both spike
proteins, stronger fluctuations exhibit SARS-CoV-1. Fluctuation magnitude in each domain
can be explicitly measured by the RMSF of the respective backbone atoms. The Figure 5A, B
reveals RMSF fluctuations in both spike proteins at different energy cut-offs (temperatures).
Consistently with normal mode analysis it is evident that for both spike proteins the RBD in
the up conformation has higher fluctuation magnitude if compared to other domains including
RBDs in the down state at all considered cut-off values. Overall the changes in the RMSF
profile with the change of the temperature are more pronounced for the SARS-CoV-1 rather
than for the SARS-CoV-2 (Table S3, S4). For the SARS-CoV-1 the reduction of energy cutoff from 0.0 to -2.0 kcal/mol results in increase of average RMSF across all domains from
4.2±2.2Å to 9.2±6.6Å. Whereas for SARS-CoV-2 the energy cut-off reduction leads to
relatively small increase from 5.1±4.3Å to 6.1±4.3Å. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-1 spike
protein's RBD in the up state at lower energy cut-offs: -0.0 and -0.1 kcal/mol exhibit lower
fluctuation magnitude compared to the one in SARS-CoV-2: 7.8±2.8Å vs 17.8±8.0Å at -0.0
kcal/mol and 11.9±4.1Å vs 19.5±8.8Å at -0.1 kcal/mol respectively. Contrary to that at higher
energy cut-offs: -1.0 and -2.0 kcal/mol fluctuation magnitude of the RBD in the up state is
higher in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1rather than in the case of SARS-CoV-2: 25.1±9.0Å
vs 18.0±7.9Å and 27.9±9.9Å vs 16.4±6.8Å. These observations are in partial agreement with
[11], where SARS-CoV-1 exhibited stronger fluctuations than SARS-CoV-2 at the room
temperature. Overall it seems that temperature increase affects the SARS-CoV-1spike protein
in the more pronounced way than the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This may point out on the
higher stability of ACE2 binding competent state of the SARS-CoV-2. This finding confirms
also general trend of higher sensitivity to meteorological conditions of SARS-CoV-1 in
comparison to SARS-CoV-2 [12-13].
Figure 5C,D compare the ensemble of snapshots for SARS-CoV-1and SARS-CoV-2
complexed with RBD at energy cut-off -1 kcal/mol. Overall ACE2 bound with SARS-CoV1fluctuates in the similar manner to the ACE2 bound with SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, RBD
domain of SARS-CoV-1 bound to ACE2 seems to have larger fluctuation amplitude comparing
to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in the bound state. These features are reflected in the
corresponding RMSF profiles of ACE2 and RBD in each complex at different energy cut-offs,
summarized in the Figure 5C, D and Table S4. Consistently with visual observations with the
energy cut-off reduction ACE2 fluctuation magnitude increases in similar manner in both
complexes, no substantial differences are observed. The change of energy cut-off from 0.0 to 2.0 kcal/mol leads to the change of average RMSF of ACE2 complexed with SARS-CoV1from 2.9±1.0Å to 4.4±1.4Å and for ACE2 complexed with SARS-CoV-2 from 3.0±1.0Å to
4.3±1.4. Whereas RBD domain dynamics in the complex overall is less mobile for the SARSCoV-2 case rather than for the SARS-CoV-1. Average RMSF of the former one is lower at all
considered cut-offs. With energy cut-off reduction average RMSF of SARS-CoV-1RBD
complexed with ACE2 changes from 4.3±1.9Å to 7.0±2.9Å, whereas in case of SARS-CoV-2
the change is from 4.0±1.7Å to 5.5±2.3Å. Which points out on the stronger contacts in the
complex between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2. This result correlates with higher binding affinity
as well as infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 if compared to SARS-CoV-1[12-14].

Uneven distribution of interface molecular interactions between the RBD and hACE2
Interface interactions certainly play crucial role for binding and that of dynamic domain
separation shown in normal mode analysis. Here, we use Prodigy webserver to predict these
interactions [15]. Interface between CoV-2-RBD and hACE2 is relatively higher than the
SARS-CoV-1complex, with higher potential for large intermolecular interactions. Although
both the complexes hold almost similar binding affinity for the hACE2, there are slight
observable differences in dissociation coefficient (i.e. 7.3 nM for CoV-RBD-hACE2 complex
and 12 nM for CoV-2-RBD-hACE2) (Table 1). This noted difference may arise due to
differential interface molecular interactions (Table S1 and S2). In both the complexes, almost
all interface molecular interactions involve loops and small parts of beta-sheets secondary
structures of RBD and a single alpha helical structure of hACE2, indicating interface instability
(Fig.4). We find uneven distribution of interface interactions along this single hACE2 alphahelix. While two end portions and the middle part of the helix hold most interactions, there are
lot more differences of interacting residues between CoV-1and CoV-2 complex (Table S1). In
particular, we note that hACE2.GLU35[OE2]–RBD.GLN493[NE2] and hACE2.THR27[O] –
RBD.TYR489[OH] come closer (~2.6 Å) and form H-bonds in the CoV-2-RBD-hACE2
complex (Fig.6). Inclusion of these two additional polar interactions may affect subsequent
proteolytic processing of S protein and membrane fusion with the S2-unit.

of beta-sheets secondary structures of RBD and a single alpha helical structure of hACE2. We note that
hACE2.GLU35–RBD.GLN493 and hACE2.THR27 – RBD.TYR489 (~2.6 Å) forms H-bond interactions in the
CoV2-RBD-hACE2 complex.

In order to check reliability of predicted interface interactions, we have calculated 13C
chemical shifts () using structural coordinates of both the CoV-1and CoV-2 hACE2 bound
complex. This calculation is carried out using SHIFTX2 that combines ensemble machine
learning approaches with the sequence alignment-based methods and that has carefully been
trained with 197 high-resolution protein structures. We note that there is no overall significant
differences in  (ppm) between the hACE2 bound CoV-1and CoV-2 complex (Fig.7A).
However, relative absolute differences in  () are prominent at the interface between hACE2
and RBD (Fig.7A middle). Detected uneven distribution and changes of interface interactions
are shown to be strongly correlated to deviation in the chemical shifts (). In particular, the
hACE2 interface helix and the interacting RBD domain of the CoV-2 RBD shows significant
difference in  (Fig.7B). As expected, very high  values are noted at and nearby H-bond
forming residues GLU 35, THR 27 on the hACE2 helices and GLN 493 and TYR 489 on the
RBD interface (Fig.7B). A large  pick of 14.86 ppm on the RBD-interface and 2.50 ppm on
the hACE2 helix are noted, with significant changes in the middle and end parts of the
interacting interface helix. Furthermore, large picks in  corresponds to AA substitutions. For
example,  pick of 14.86 and 8.90 ppm correspond to the substitution THR433GLY446 and
THR487ASN501 on the interacting RBD domain.

hACE2 binding induces changes in structural flexibilities
How hACE2 binding promote membrane fusion is critical to understand virus entry into host
cell. As mentioned above that hACE2 binding triggers local conformational changes and how
such changes alter structural flexibilities underpin effective membrane fusion. To address this
question, we have carried out rigidity analysis using Floppy Inclusion and Rigid Substructure
Topography (FIRST) program [16] which is based on pebble game algorithm and techniques
in rigidity theory. FIRST decomposes the protein structure into multiple rigid clusters with the
input of H-bond energy cutoff (H-cut-off). With H-cut-off of 0.00, -0.5, -0.1 and -1.5, both the
complexes have been decomposed into several rigid clusters. As H-cut-off increases, number
of rigid cluster is elevated with decreasing size. Given all the H-cut-off, no significant
differences are observed for CoV-1and CoV-2 up-form RBD. However, hACE2 bound
complexes show differences in number, size and distribution of rigid clusters between CoV1and CoV2-RBD-hACE2 complex (Fig.8 and Table 2). Upon hACE2 binding, it shows that
CoV-2 complex becomes highly flexible which favours proteolytic processing for membrane
fusions.

structures have been decomposed into several rigid clusters. Coloured region shows rigid cluster. Although there
is no significant differences between SARS-CoV-1and SARS-CoV-2, hACE2 binding in the SARS-CoV-2-RBD
makes the structure more flexible with less number and smaller size of rigid clusters.

Interfacial water promotes and stabilizes the formation of CoV-2/hACE2 complex
Previous studies [17,18] have indicated that water-mediated interactions can play an essential
role in stabilization of CoV/hACE2 complex. It can be shown [18] that a gap between the
RBD/hACE2 protein-protein complex includes several hundred interfacial water molecules
which can form bridges between amino acids of the RBD and hACE2 subunits. Using the threedimensional reference interaction model (3D-RISM) approach (see details in Methods) we
have evaluated this phenomenon and calculated a distribution of interfacial water and its
probable influence on the complex formation. Figure 9a demonstrates a water distribution in
the interfacial region for CoV-2/hACE2 complex. Water molecules are depicted only in the
most probable positions. As it is seen, the interfacial water interacts strongly with the RBD as
well as with the hACE2 subunits, the latter confirms the previous molecular dynamic
simulations [18]. However, our calculations yield the water-mediated interactions to be
stronger for the CoV-2/hACE2 complex than those for the CoV/hACE2. See for example Fig.
9b demonstrating a relative difference in distributions of water oxygens (blue) and hydrogens
(red) between the two complexes. Moreover, the water interacts more strongly for CoV2/hACE2 rather than for pure coronavirus. This effect is also confirmed by the calculations of
water-complex interaction energies (Table 1). The data on interaction energies between the
complexes and interfacial water proves this fact. Although the Lennard-Jones energy between
the CoV/hACE2 and water is stronger than that for the CoV-2/hACE2 complex, the total
interaction energy has a more profit for the latter complex due to a strong decrease in the
electrostatic energy. This observed effect can be explained by a polarization of interfacial water
which is stronger for the CoV-2/hACE2 complex.
Apart from it, the latter complex forms water bridges whose number is larger by 2 than in
the case of CoV/hACE2. At the same time the water bridges is more stronger in the CoV2/hACE2 aggregate. For example, we have calculated the potential of mean force (pmf)
between atoms of corona virus and hACE2 receptor (Fig. 10). It is clearly seen that bridging
water molecule forms simultaneously hydrogen bonds with CoV-2 (Gln493) and hACE2
(Glu35) amino acids in the case of CoV-2 (Figs. 10a and 10c). However, the similar hydrogen
bond with bridging water is very weak and diffusive for the CoV/hACE2 complex (Figs. 10b
and 10d). Therefore, we conclude that bridge water molecules play a significant and, perhaps,
crucial role in stabilizing CoV-2/hACE2 complex.

Conclusions
Viral entry into host cell, subsequent replication and transmibility are essentially dependent on
receptor recognition, binding, and membrane fusion mechanisms. SARS-coronavirus use
ectodomain trimer, spike glycoprotein (S-protein), to mediate this viral entry [19]. Both SARSCoV-1and SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the human membrane receptor protein hACE2 through its
receptor-binding domain (RBD) positioned within the flexible S1 unit of S-protein protomer.
S-protomer with the RBD up-conformational forms can only recognize hACE2. With down
RBD conformations in all the three protomers of S-protein prevent hACE2 binding. Prefusion
RBD conformation is, therefore, very important to determine receptor binding and thereby its
differences between CoV-1and CoV2 underpin the higher success of human-to-human
transmission of SARS-CoV2. Understanding prefusion conformation and receptor binding and
its differences among closely related species are critical for designing vaccine and inhibitors to
strop viral entry. For example, one recent structural study has tested multiple SARS-CoV1RBD specific monoclonal antibodies and found that none of them have notable binding to
CoV-2 RBD [5]. Recent major therapeutic efforts are targeting the interactions between the
SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the human cellular receptor angiotensin-converting
enzyme, hACE2 [20-22]. It has recently been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-1S murine
polyclonal antibodies can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV2 S mediated viral entry. However, its
underlying inhibition mechanism is poorly understood [4].
Using recently reported cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-1and CoV-2 S protein we find
effective conformational differences in the RBDs at prefusion state. With higher surface area
of CoV-2 RBD and large local conformational changes in the AA residues, it establishes higher
interactions with the human receptor hACE2. These underlying conformational differences are
illustrated with the higher RMSD of C atoms, changes in phi and psi dihedral angles and
relatively large amplitude anti-phase-like RBD motion. In particular, we note that
hACE2.GLU35–RBD.GLN493 and hACE2.THR27 – RBD.TYR489 come closer in the
CoV2-RBD-hACE2 complex and forms important H-bonds. However, it remains to be
explored how efficiently CoV-2 regulate and open-up RBD for hACE2-binding. The RBD of
CoV-2 forms more number and more stronger water bridges with the hACE2, and the letter
play a significant role in the total stabilization of the CoV-2/hACE2 complex. Inclusion of the
two noted additional polar interactions affects structural flexibilities. We find such interaction
changes critically affect structural flexibility. In particular, hACE2 binding makes the CoV-2
structure more flexible relative to CoV-1complex. This h-ACE2-induced structural flexibility
favours subsequent proteolytic processing which is essential for membrane fusion. This
understanding certainly provides a clue for designing novel vaccine and antiviral drugs.

Methods
Root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of C atoms
We used MatchMaker in UCSF-Chimera to superimpose structures. It performs a best fit after
automatically identifying pair of residues. It considers similar structures to be superimposed
while there are large sequence dissimilarities by producing residue pairing uses with the inputs
of AA sequences and secondary structural elements. After superposition, it uses the usual
Euclidian distance formula for calculating RMSD in angstrom unit with the use of PDB atomic
coordinates files.
Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)
DynOmics ENM Server [23] was used to perform normal mode analysis (NMA). NMA is a
well-explored technique for exploring functional motions of proteins. It combines two elastic
network models (ENMs) — the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and the Anisotropic Network
Model (ANM) to evaluate the dynamics of structurally resolved systems, from individual
molecules to large complexes and assemblies, in the context of their physiological
environment. In the GNM model, network nodes are the C-alpha atoms and the elastic springs
represented the interactions. We used GNM with interaction cut-off distance of 7.3 Å and
spring constant scaling factor cut-off of 1 Å for the calculation of the elastic network model.
We calculated the first twenty slowest modes for all the CoVs structures. The eigenvectors of
these modes represent the global motions and the constrained residues help in identifying
critical regions such as hinge-bending regions and thereby giving an idea of domain motions
around these regions. We plotted the second slowest mode in different conditions which
showed a significant difference in motions.
Constrained geometric simulations for conformational sampling
To study dynamics of the considered structures, we employed a low computational complexity
alternative to MD geometric molecular simulation package FRODAN v1.0.1 [10]. We run
FRODAN in the non-targeted mode, generating 30,000 candidate structures for each case. The
temperature impact was evaluated by running simulations at different hydrogen bond energy
cut-offs. The considered range of the energy cut-offs was from 0.0 to -2.0 kcal/mol, with that
of the more negative cut-off values correspond to higher temperature. During each individual
run the cut-off value was kept constant. Before running simulations, hydrogen bonds to each
considered structure were added using MolProbity server:
(http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/).
Rigidity analysis
We use the program Floppy Inclusion and Rigid Substructure Topography (FIRST) [16] that
generates a constraints network from the coordinates of the protein structure in terms of nodes
(atoms) and edges (covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions). Hydrogen
bonds were ranked according to their energy strength using Mayo potential, whereas the value
of energy strength was selected in such way that the bonds strength below this cut off were
ignored. First then applies the rigorous mathematical theory of rigid and flexible molecular
structure and pebble game algorithm calculates the degree of freedom of motion to rapidly
decompose a protein into rigid clusters and flexible region.

3D RISM calculations
The 3D- RISM method [24-25] with the 3D-Kovalenko-Hirata closure was used to describe
hydration of CoV-2/hACE2 and CoV/hACE2 complexes. These calculations describe
hydration on a molecular-atom level and has proven their power in many successful studies of
ion / molecule hydration, including various biocompounds [26-36]. In the framework of 3DRISM theory molecule-atom spatial distribution functions are obtained. These functions are
the 3D-site distribution functions of water atoms around the complex. The RISM-calculations
were carried out for the studied complexes hydrated in water at ambient conditions. For water
the modified version of the SPC/E model (MSPC/E) was used [37]. The corresponding LJ
parameters of the solute atoms were taken from the ff14SB force fields [38]. The 3D-RISM
calculations were performed using the rism3d.snglpnt codes from the AmberTools 16 package
[39]. The 3D-RISM equations were solved on a 3D-grid of 350 × 320 × 350 points with a
spacing of 0.025 nm. A residual tolerance of 10–6 was chosen. These parameters are enough to
accommodate the complex together with sufficient solvation space around it so that the
obtained results are without significant numerical errors.
