Abstract (181 words)

22

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with

23

a wide variety of neurological complications. Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in

24

the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-

25

CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-

26

2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell

27

tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of

28

neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2

29

was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-

30

2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and

31

spread, despite ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NPR1 expression in all cultures. However, this sparse

32

infection did result in the production of type-III-interferons and IL-8. In contrast, H5N1 virus

33

replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our

34

findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune

35

responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the

36

CNS.

Introduction

39
40

Neurological manifestations are present in a substantial proportion of patients suffering from

41

the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Symptoms comprise loss of smell

42

(anosmia), loss of taste (hypogeusia), headache, fatigue, nausea and vomiting1–3.

43

Additionally, more severe neurological complications such as seizures, confusion,

44

cerebrovascular injury, stroke, encephalitis, encephalopathies and altered mental status are

45

being increasingly reported in hospitalized patients4–6.

46
47

It remains to be established whether the reported neurological manifestations are a direct

48

consequence of local invasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-

49

CoV-2) into the central nervous system (CNS), an indirect consequence of the associated

50

systemic immune responses, or a combination of both. In human and animal models, it has

51

been shown that SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate in the olfactory mucosa7,8, suggesting that

52

the olfactory nerve could function as an important route of entry into the CNS9, as observed

53

previously for other respiratory viruses10. Post-mortem brain tissue analyses of fatal COVID-

54

19 cases has revealed mild neuropathological changes which might be related to hypoxia-and

55

pronounced neuroinflammation in different regions of the brain11. In the majority of cases,

56

neither SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, nor virus antigen, could be detected in the CNS5,12. In line

57

with this, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has rarely been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of

58

COVID-19-patients with neurological symptoms13–15. Together, this suggests that SARS-CoV-

59

2 might enter the CNS but unable to replicate there efficiently.

60
61

In the brain, viruses encounter a variety of different cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and

62

microglia. Investigations of CNS cell-type specific infection of SARS-CoV-2 have been

63

inconsistent16–23. Most of studies have investigated virus replication by detection of viral RNA,

64

but have not reported whether infectious progeny viruses are produced. Therefore, in order to

65

investigate replication and infection efficiency, cell tropism and associated immune responses

66

of SARS-CoV-2, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) along a

67

variety of different neural lineage specifications, which afforded a unique and flexible platform

68

to study the neurotropism of viruses in vitro. Specifically, we directed hiPSC-colonies towards

69

embryoid bodies with differentiation into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and subsequently

70

mature neural networks24. In addition, we also utilized a rapid neuronal differentiation protocol

71

based on forced overexpression of the transcription factor Ngn2 in hiPSCs (Figure 1A) 25,26 to

72

generate pure populations of neurons that we co-cultured with hiPSC-derived astrocytes.

73

Using these specified CNS cell types, we directly compared the characteristics of SARS-CoV-

74

2 with the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus, a virus with zoonotic potential which is

75

known to efficiently replicate in neural cells in vivo27–32 and in vitro33–36.

Results

78

SARS-CoV-2 does not replicate efficiently in hiPSC neural cell types, despite the

79

presence of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1

80

To investigate the replication efficiency of SARS-CoV-2, we utilized hiPSC-derived NPCs and

81

differentiated these to mature neural cultures (Figure 1A). NPCs and fully differentiated neural

82

cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of

83

0.1 and 0.5. At 2, 6, 24 48 and 72 hours post infection (hpi), infectious virus titers in the

84

supernatants were determined by endpoint titration. In contrast to H5N1 virus, no productive

85

infection in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated NPC and mature neural cultures was detected (Figure 1B

86

and Figure 1C). As an alternative to the laborious and time-consuming differentiation of mature

87

neural networks through embryoid bodies and NPC stages, we also employed a rapid

88

differentiation protocol that yields a pure culture of iPSC-derived glutamatergic cortical

89

neurons by overexpressing the transcription factor neurogenin-2 (Ngn2)25. We further

90

supplemented the Ngn2-induced neurons with hiPSC-derived astrocytes to support their

91

survival and maturation (Figure 1A). SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate efficiently in the Ngn2 co-

92

cultures, in contrast to H5N1 virus (Figure 1D). As a positive control for virus replication, Vero-

93

E6 and MDCK cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 virus, respectively (Figure 1E

94

and 1F).

95
96

Next, we evaluated the presence of important SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, such as angiotensin-

97

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and neuropilin-

98

1 (NRP1). In all cultures, there was clear evidence for ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1

99

expression, suggesting cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (Figure 1G,

100

Supplement Figure 1).

expression

120

To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect individual cells, we stained for virus

121

antigen 72 hpi after infection with a MOI of 0.5. SARS-CoV-2 sparsely infected cells in neural

122

cultures at 72 hpi. Infection was observed in single scattered MAP2-positive neurons (Figure

123

2A and 2B). In one experiment, we identified a cluster of MAP2-positive cells that stained

124

positively for SARS-CoV-2 nuclear protein (NP) at 72 hpi (Supplement Figure 2A). In the Ngn2

125

co-cultures, we were only able to detect MAP2/NEUN+ neurons positive for SARS-CoV-2 NP,

126

suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infects only mature neurons and does so only sparsely

127

(Supplement Figure 2B). We found no convincing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 NP-positive cells

128

among SOX2+ NPCs or GFAP+ astrocytes (Figure 2A-2C). H5N1 virus abundantly infected

129

SOX2+ NPCs, GFAP+ astrocytes and MAP2+ neurons (Figure 2A-C).

130
131

Next, we wanted to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection induced neuronal apoptosis.

132

Therefore, we infected Ngn2 co-cultures with SARS-CoV-2 and stained for the apoptosis

133

marker caspase-3. We again observed that SARS-CoV-2 infected only MAP2+ neurons.

134

Neurons expressing SARS-CoV-2 NP did not exhibit caspase-3 expression (Figure 3A and

135

3B and Supplement Figure 2C).

Discussion

180

SARS-CoV-2 replicated poorly in all three hiPSC-derived neural cultures used in our

181

experiments, which contrasts largely to H5N1 virus, which replicated efficiently to high titers.

182

Even though important entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 are expressed in all of the cultures used,

183

SARS-CoV-2 infected a very small proportion of cells without evidence of subsequent spread

184

or cellular apoptosis. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection did induce type-III-IFN and IL-8

185

production.

186
187

Evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS via the olfactory nerve7–9, a

188

pathway that is also used by influenza A viruses to enter the CNS in many mammals including

189

humans10,37. H5N1 virus spreads efficiently to the CNS via the olfactory nerve in

190

experimentally inoculated ferrets and subsequently replicates very efficiently in the CNS27,29,38.

191

Unlike H5N1 virus infection, SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the CNS of fatal COVID-19

192

patients or experimentally inoculated animals11–15. In addition, only a handful of case reports

193

of SARS-CoV-2 induced encephalitis have been reported39,40.. Altogether, these observations

194

are consistent with our findings of poor SARS-CoV-2 replication in hiPSC-derived NPCs,

195

neurons and astrocytes, and supports a pathophysiological model whereby SARS-CoV-2

196

invades the CNS, but does not replicate efficiently in CNS cell types. However, one caveat of

197

our study is that other cells such as microglia, oligodendrocytes and vascular cells (pericytes,

198

endothelial cells) are not present. Therefore, we cannot exclude that SARS-CoV-2 can infect

199

and possibly replicate efficiently in other cells of the CNS or neuronal cell types such as cortical

200

PV interneurons, midbrain or hindbrain cell types.

201
202

Despite the low proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and the fact that infection seemed to

203

be abortive in the hiPSC derived neural cultures, we found evidence for cellular immune

204

activation. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 infection of the neural cultures resulted in the induction

205

of type-III-IFN and IFNl2/3, but not type-I-IFN or type-II-IFN. This result is in accordance with

206

earlier reports suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 triggers only very mild type-I and type-II-IFN

207

responses, but does trigger a robust type-III-IFN response in cell culture, human airway

208

epithelial cells, ferrets and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals41,42. In addition, IL-8—a

209

chemotactic factor that attracts leukocytes—was induced in all hiPSC-derived cultures. In lung

210

tissue and peripheral venous blood serum of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, elevated levels

211

of IL-8 are associated with severe COVID-1943–45. Furthermore, IL-8 has been detected in the

212

CSF of SARS-CoV-2 patients who developed encephalitis, which might be induced by the

213

SARS-CoV-2 associated brain immune response, since SARS-CoV-2 RNA could not be

214

detected in the CSF46. However, how exactly these cytokines contribute to the in vivo

215

neuroinflammatory process, and if they are directly triggered by SARS-CoV-2 entry into the

216

CNS needs further investigations

217
218

Highly pathogenic H5N1 virus replication has been reported in vivo27,29,31,32,47 and in vitro

219

across several different types of human and mouse neural cell cultures34–36, including the

220

human neuroblastoma line SK-N-SH26, suggesting this virus is neurotropic. This fits with our

221

observation that H5N1 virus replicates productively and spreads throughout hiPSC-derived

222

neural cultures, infecting NPCs as well as mature neurons and astrocytes. H5N1 virus

223

infection also results in the upregulation of type-III-IFN, IFNl1 and IFNl2/3, as well as the

224

antiviral cytokines IL-8 and IP-10. IP-10 has been detected in the CSF of influenza A virus

225

infected patients and was found to be elevated in the brains of mice experimentally infected

226

with H5N1 virus48. However, the mechanism by which H5N1 virus achieves abundant virus

227

replication and robust induction of pro-neuroinflammatory cytokines remains poorly

228

understood.

229
230

Altogether, our findings reveal that replication of SARS-CoV-2 in CNS cell types is very limited,

231

which is in contrast to the efficient replication and spread of H5N1 virus. Although the

232

mechanistic pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 associated CNS disease remains poorly

Differentiation of iPSCs to NPCs and mature neural cultures

250

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [WTC-11 Coriell #GM25256, obtained from the

251

Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, USA] were differentiated to NPCs as previously described2

252

with slight modifications. After passage 3, NPC cultures were purified using fluorescence-

253

activated cell sorting (FACS) as described previously49. Briefly, NPCs were detached from the

254

culture plate and resuspended into a single cell solution. CD184+/CD44-/CD271-/CD24+ cells

255

were collected using a FACSaria III (BD bioscience) and expanded in NPC medium (Table 2).

256

NPCs were used for experiments between passage 3 and 7 after sorting or differentiated to

257

neural networks. For differentiation towards mature neural cultures, NPCs were grown in

258

neural differentiation medium (Table 2) for 6-8 weeks to achieve mature neural networks

259

and subsequently used for experiments, after week 4 only half of the medium was refreshed.

260

Cultures were kept at 37 °C/5%CO2 throughout the entire differentiation process.

Differentiation of iPSCs to Ngn2 co-cultures

263

iPSCs were directly differentiated into excitatory cortical layer 2/3 neurons by forcibly

264

overexpressing the neuronal determinant Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2)25,50. To support neuronal

265

maturation, hiPSC-derived astrocytes were added to the culture in a 1:1 ratio. At day 3, the

266

medium was changed to Ngn2-medium (Table 2). Cytosine b-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C)

267

(2 µM; Sigma, C1768) was added once to remove proliferating cells from the culture and

268

ensure long-term recordings of the cultures. From day 6 onwards, half of the medium was

269

refreshed three times per week. Cultures were kept at 37 °C/5%CO2 throughout the entire

270

differentiation process.

271
272

Viruses

273

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate (isolate BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020; European Virus Archive

274

Global #026V-03883; kindly provided by Dr. C. Drosten) was previously described by Lamers

275

et al.51,52 The zoonotic HPAI H5N1 virus (A/Indonesia/5/2005) was isolated from a human

276

patient and the virus was propagated once in embryonated chicken eggs and twice in MDCK

277

cells.

278
279

Virus Titrations

280

The SARS-CoV-2 titers were determined by endpoint dilution on VeroE6 cells, calculated

281

according to the method of Spearman & Kärber and expressed as 50% tissue culture

282

infectious dose/ml (TCID50/ml). SARS-CoV-2 virus titers were determined by preparing 10-fold

283

serial dilutions in triplicates of supernatants in Opti-MEM containing GlutaMAX. Dilutions

284

supernatants were added to a monolayer of 40.000 VeroE6 cells/ well in a 96-well plateand

285

incubate at 37°C. After 5 days the plates were examined for the presence of cytopathic effect

286

(CPE). Virus titers of HPAI H5N1 were determined by endpoint dilution on MDCK as described

287

previously53. In short, 10-fold serial dilutions of cell supernatant in triplicates were prepared in

288

Influenza infection medium which consists of EMEM supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin,

289

100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, 10 mM HEPES, 1×

290

(0.1 mM) nonessential amino acids, and 1 μg/μl TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior

291

to adding the virus dilutions to the MDCK cells, the cells were washed once with plain EMEM-

292

medium to remove residual FCS. 100 µl of the diluted supernatants was used to inoculate

293

30.000 MDCK cells/well in a 96-well plate. After one hour, the inoculum was removed and

294

200µl fresh influenza infection medium was added. Four days after infection, supernatants of

295

the infected MDCK cells were tested for agglutination. 25µl of the supernatant were mixed

296

with 75µl 0.33% turkey red blood cells and incubated for one hour at 4°C. The titers of

297

infectious virus were calculated according to the method of Spearman & Kärber and

298

expressed as TCID50/ml. All experiment with infectious SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 virus were

299

performed in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions at the Erasmus Medical

300

Center. The initial 1:10 dilution of cell supernatant resulted in a detection limit of

301

101.5 TCID50/ml.

302
303

Replication Kinetic

304

Before infection of neural progenitors, network neurons and NGN2 neurons, supernatant was

305

removed and cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 virus at the indicated multiplicity

306

of infection (MOI). As control for active virus replication, VeroE6 and MDCK cells were infected

307

with SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 virus, respectively. Before virus infection, the VeroE6 cells were

308

washed with SARS-CoV-2 infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 100

309

IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and MDCK cells were washed with influenza infection

310

medium. After 1 hours of incubation at 37°C, the inoculum was removed and replaced with

311

fresh medium and old medium in a 1:1 ratio. After removing the inoculum from VeroE6 and

312

MDCK cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection medium and influenza infection medium, respectively,

313

were added to the cells. At the indicated timepoints an aliquot of the supernatant was collected

314

for subsequent virus titration. All experiments were performed in biological triplicates and

315

either in technical duplicates or triplicates.

318

RNA was isolated from the neural cultures and VeroE6 cells using the High Pure RNA Isolation

319

Kit (Roche). The concentration of RNA was determined using Nanodrop. 2.5µg of RNA was

320

reverse transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)

321

according to the manufacturers’ protocol. cDNA of bronchus-bronchiol organoids were kindly

322

provided by Anna Z. Mykytyn. Presence of ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1 and ACT was evaluated

323

by amplified these genes with gene specific primers (Table 1) by PCR. Gene products were

324

visualized on a 2% agarose gel which was stained with SYBR Safe. PCR products of the

325

genes were sequenced to validate that the right product was amplified.

Multiplexed bead-assay for Cytokine Profiling

330

Cytokines were measured using the LEGENDplex™ Human Anti-Virus Response

331

Panel (BioLegend). The kit was used according to manufacturer’s manual with an additional

332

fixing step. After adding the SA-PE and performing the washing steps, the supernatant and

333

the beads were fixed with formalin for 15 minutes at room temperature and washed twice with

334

the provided wash buffer. This ensures that all pathogens are not infectious.

335
336

Immunofluorescent labeling

337

Cells were fixed using 4% formalin in PBS and labeled using immunocytochemistry. Primary

338

antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibody incubation was

339

performed for 2 hours at room temperature. Both primary and secondary antibody incubation

340

was performed in staining buffer [0.05 M Tris, 0.9% NaCl, 0.25% gelatin, and 0.5% Triton X-

341

100 (Sigma, T8787) in PBS (pH 7.4)]. Primary antibodies and their dilutions can be found in

342

Table 2. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488, Alexa-647 or Cy3 were used at a

343

dilution of 1:400 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were visualised using DAPI

344

(ThermoFisher Scientific, D1306). Samples were embedded in Mowiol 4-88 (Sigma-Aldrich,

345

81381) and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope (Oberkochen, Germany).
