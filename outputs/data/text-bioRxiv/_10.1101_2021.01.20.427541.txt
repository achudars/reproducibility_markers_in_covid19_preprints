Abstract
Cell lines are the mainstay in understanding the biology of COVID-19 infection, but do
not recapitulate many of the complexities of human infection. The use of human lung tissue is
one solution for the study of such novel respiratory pathogens. We hypothesized that a
cryopreserved bank of human lung tissue allows for the in vitro study of the inter-individual
heterogeneity of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus providing a bridge between
studies with cell lines and studies in animal models. We generated a cryobank of tissues from
16 donors, most of whom had risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19. Cryopreserved
tissues preserved 90% of cell viability and contained heterogeneous populations of
metabolically active epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell subsets of the human lung.
Samples were readily infectible with HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, and
demonstrated comparable susceptibility to infection. In contrast, we observed a marked donordependent heterogeneity in the expression of IL-6, CXCL8 and IFNβ in response to SARS-CoV2 infection. Treatment of tissues with dexamethasone and the experimental drug, Nhydroxycytidine, suppressed viral growth in all samples, whereas chloroquine and remdesivir
had no detectable effect. Metformin and sirolimus, molecules with predicted antiviral activity,
suppressed viral replication in tissues from a subset of donors. In summary, we developed a
novel system for the in vitro study of human SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human lung
tissue from a library of donor tissues. This model may be useful for drug screening and for
understanding basic mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Importance
The current biological systems for the study of COVID-19 are in vitro systems that differ
from the human lung in many respects, and animal hosts to which the virus is not adapted. We
developed another alternative for studying pathogenesis and drug susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2
in a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissues. We consider the importance of this work to

relate to the practical use of this culture system as a repeatable and scalable approach that
allows for the study of an important infection in relevant tissues.
The tissue bank highlights the heterogeneous response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
treatment, which allows researchers to investigate why treatments work in some donors but not
others.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for improved models of infection to
study host-pathogen interactions, rapidly screen potential therapeutic interventions, and study
fundamental pathogenic mechanisms. Cell lines have served as the mainstay in understanding
the biology of the infection, but do not capture the cellular heterogeneity, cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions, or between-host variability encountered in human infection.
The use of human lung tissue is one solution for the study of biology of novel respiratory
pathogens. Lung tissue explants capture the cellular heterogeneity within the human lung and
the use of tissues from multiple donors can allow the study of the genetic diversity found within
the human population. To this end, human lung organoids (1, 2) and lung-on-a-chip organs (3)
are readily infected with SARS-CoV-2. The use of these models is limited by two considerations:
first, there are practical difficulties of repeating experiments with the same donor or performing
experiments on multiple donors in parallel. Second, these are simplified systems that do not
recapitulate the intrinsic complexities of lung tissue. The optimal solution to these problems is a
repeatable and scalable in vitro system that captures the intricacies of the human lung while
allowing

high-throughput parallel drug screens from multiple donors and sequential

experiments using tissue from the same donor.
Polyampholytes are polymeric hydrogels composed of poly-L lysine or other amphiphilic
chemicals that can serve as a less toxic alternative to dimethylsulfoxide for the cryopreservation
of cells. Similar to antifreeze proteins first discovered in arctic fish (4), these amphiphilic proteins
interact with both the hydrophobic cell membrane and hydrophilic ice crystals, mitigating
damage associated with the formation of crystals during freezing (5–7). Polyampholyte medias
have been used to cryopreserve many cell lines and primary cells with high viability (8). Recent
work has demonstrated that they can also be used to cryopreserve 3D cell structures (9). We
therefore tested the hypothesis that a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissue allows for the in

vitro study of the inter-individual heterogeneity of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus
providing a bridge between studies with cell lines and studies in animal models.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, under a
protocol approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (IRB202000920) after
written informed consent from participants.

Recruitment, sample collection, and processing
Lung tissues were obtained from participants undergoing lung resection surgery or from
allografts that underwent volume reduction before transplantation. In cases of lung resection for
nodules, samples far from the site of pathology were utilized. Pleural tissue and staple lines
were dissected away, and the lung tissue was then sectioned into approximately 0.5g pieces.
The tissue was then minced with surgical scissors into samples with a mean diameter of 0.91
mm (range 0.40-1.5 mm), and equally distributed into a 24-well plate. Tissues in each well were
resuspended in 1.2 mL of a commercial DMSO-free cryopreservation medium (CryoSOfree™,
C9249; Sigma-Aldrich), divided into 200 µL aliquots, and then transferred to cryotubes each
containing 800 µL of additional cryopreservation media. Samples were frozen at -80˚C
overnight, then transferred to vapor-phase liquid nitrogen storage.

Viral cultures
HCoV-OC43 (strain HCoV-OC43-JAL-1) and SARS-CoV-2 (strain UF-1) viruses were
propagated in Vero-E6 cell line (ATCC® CRL-1586™) in advanced DMEM (Gibco™, 12491015;
Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% HyClone™ Defined low antibody, heat-inactivated,

gamma-irradiated fetal bovine serum (SH30070.03IR2540; Cytiva), 1% L-alanine and Lglutamine supplement (GlutaMAX™, 35050061; Gibco™), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
mixture (17-602E; Lonza™ BioWhittaker™), at 37˚C in 5% CO2 in 75 cm2 flasks. All SARS-CoV2 work was performed in a BSL3 facility using approved protocols.
To inoculate the virus, media was aspirated from flasks with >80% confluent cell monolayers
and replaced with 3 mL of fresh media. 1 mL of viral stock (containing 106 PFU) was added to
each flask, and the flask was incubated at 37˚C (33˚C for hCoV-OC43) in 5% CO2 for 1 h, with
manual rocking every 15 min. A "mock-infected" negative control cell culture was inoculated
with 4 mL of media without virus and handled in parallel. The flasks were observed daily for
development of virus-induced cytopathogenic effects (CPE) and harvested after 48–96 h of
incubation, at which point the cells displayed ≥95% CPE and about 25% of the cells had
detached from the growing surface.
H-CoV-OC43 viral stocks: The flasks were frozen once at -80˚C, thawed to room temperature,
scraped to lift off cellular debris and contents centrifuged at 2000 xg for 10 min at 4˚C in a
centrifuge bucket sealed with a safety cap. A sterile filtered solution of 60% w/v D(+)-Trehalose
dihydrate (AC182550250; ACROS Organics™) dissolved in aDMEM was added to the
supernatant to a final concentration of 10% w/v. Viral stocks were stored at -80˚C overnight in 1
mL aliquots, and then transferred to vapor-phase liquid nitrogen storage. The infectious virus
titer of each batch was determined via plaque assay.
SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks: Vero cells were inoculated in a BSL3 lab as described above and
incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 72 hours, at which point the supernatant was removed from the
cell culture flask and transferred into a 50 mL tube. The tube was centrifuged at 2000g for 10
min at room temperature in a swinging-bucket centrifuge with a safety cap. The clarified
supernatant was then frozen in 1 mL aliquots in externally threaded screw-cap tubes. All
transfers of tubes in and out of the centrifuge bucket were done inside a BSC in a BSL3 facility.
Virus titer was determined by plaque assay.

Tissue culture, infection, and drug treatments
Lung samples: Tissue samples were thawed for 5 min at 37˚C then transferred to a 15 mL tube
containing 10 mL PBS using 1000 µL wide-bore pipette tips, centrifuged at 200 xg for 1 min,
supernatant aspirated, and samples were resuspended in 1 mL PneumaCult media
(PneumaCult-Ex, 05008; Stemcell Technologies) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixture (17602E; Lonza™ BioWhittaker™), 50 ng/ml gentamycin sulfate (345815; Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.25
µg/ml ertapenem sodium (SML1238; Sigma-Aldrich). The concentration of tissue samples was
measured by counting the number in 20 µL on a microscope slide, and 20-40 samples in 100 µL
were added to individual wells of a 96 well plate. For studies of lung microtissues, ultra-low cellbinding flat-bottom 96-well cell culture microplates containing hydrogel (3474; Corning™) were
hydrated with PBS for 30 min at 37˚C. PBS was aspirated prior to addition of lung microtissues.
One vial of cryopreserved lung tissue provided enough samples for approximately 10 wells at
this concentration.
Infection and treatment of lung tissue: Lung samples were prepared in a BSL2 facility. In cases
where drugs were added to the media, these drugs were added prior to the addition of virus.
Prepared plates were transported to the BSL3 lab in a sealed secondary container inside a
foam cooler. In the BSL3 lab, virus stocks were thawed and diluted to the desired concentration
(ranging from 102-104 PFU/mL) in complete PneumaCult media in a BSC. Tissues were infected
in a total of 150 uL of media for 24 hours. The inoculated plate was incubated at 37˚C (33˚C for
hCoV-OC43 infections) in 5% CO2. In cases where the culture was longer than 24 hours, 120
uL of media was aspirated from each well and deposited in bleach to sterilize any infectious
agents. An additional 120 uL of media containing the appropriate concentration of specified
drugs was added to each well and cultured for an additional 24 hours. At the end of the
experiment media was aspirated from each well and samples were washed 3X in PBS by
adding 150 uL to each well and then removing as much of the liquid as possible prior to placing
samples in 500 uL Trizol LS Reagent (10296-028; Thermo Fisher). A maximum of 100 uL of

liquid + tissue samples was placed in each tube. For experiments taking place in the BSL3 lab,
Trizol was transported in externally-threaded screw-cap tubes and disinfected prior to removal
from the BSC. All samples were transported out of the BSL3 lab in disinfected sealed secondary
containers containing absorbent material.
To study the effect of drugs on viral replication, the following drugs were used: β-d-N4hydroxycytidine (9002958; Cayman Chemical), chloroquine (C6628; Sigma), water-soluble
dexamethasone (D2915; Sigma), metformin (A10573; Adooq Bioscience), remdesivir (329511;
Medkoo), and sirolimus (A10782; Adooq Bioscience). To calculate percent inhibition for
remdesivir and sirolimus, which are soluble in DMSO, samples infected and treated with an
equal volume of DMSO in the absence of drug to determine the maximum signal. All other drugs
were water soluble and were compared to the infected but untreated control.
Vero-E6 cells used to test inhibition of viral growth were cultured to an estimated 90%
confluence in 96 well plates prior to testing and then infected with 104 PFU (approximating an
MOI of 1) in viral growth media containing the specified drugs as described above. 104 PFU was
used for infection to enable a direct comparison between Vero cell cultures and lung
microtissues infected with SARS-CoV-2. Media containing virus was removed after 24 hours
and replaced with fresh media containing the specified drugs. After an additional 24 hours of
culture, the media was aspirated and 100 uL of Trizol LS was added to each well to lyse the
cells and capture the RNA. Trizol was then transferred into externally threaded screw-cap tubes
containing an addition 400 uL of Trizol LS. Tubes were
Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry was only performed on uninfected cells. Biopsies were resuspended in
RPMI-1640 (12-167F; Lonza™ BioWhittaker™) with 125 ng/mL Liberase (LIBTM-RO,
5401119001; Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 units/mL DNase I (D5025; Sigma-Aldrich), agitated for 1 h
at 37˚C, then titurated approximately 30x using a 1 mL syringe through an 18G needle to further
disintegrate tissues forming a single-cell suspension. Cells were then centrifuged at 400 xg for 5

min at room temperature, washed twice in RPMI-1640, resuspended in flow cytometry buffer (1
ml PBS with 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA), and filtered through 100 µm Nitex nylon mesh (57-103;
Genesee Scientific). Concentration and viability were determined using a hemocytometer and
Trypan Blue exclusion (1691049; MP Biomedicals).
The lung cells were washed and resuspended in 100 µL PBS and stained with a fixable
viability dye (Zombie Aqua™, 423101; BioLegend) for 10 min at room temperature protected
from light. Cells were washed, resuspended in 100 µL buffer, and then stained with antibodies
against various surface cell markers (Table 1). During staining, serum from humans with AB
blood group (HP1022; Valley Biomedical) was added to the samples to block non-specific
binding. Surface marker antibodies were added at a concentration of 0.5 µL per 100 µL and
then the samples were incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature on the orbital
shaker. After staining, samples were washed 2x in flow cytometry buffer, centrifuged, and then
fixed for 10 min in normal buffered formalin. The samples were again centrifuged at 400 xg for
5 min. The formalin was then

aspirated, and the samples were washed 2x with PBS.

Resuspended samples were analyzed on a BD Symphony instrument (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA). Unstained cell samples from each donor and compensation beads from the
Invitrogen™ AbC™ Total Antibody Compensation Bead Kit (A10497; Thermo Fisher) were used
to set voltages and create single stain controls. Flow cytometry data was then analyzed using
FlowJo X (BD biosciences).
Quantification of virus titers and cytokine responses
RNA was isolated from washed tissue samples using Zymo Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep
kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (11-330MB; Genesee Scientific). RNA
concentration was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher), and 30 ng
of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit
(1708891; Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed using Applied Biosystems™ TaqMan™
Gene Expression Master Mix (4369016; Thermo Fisher) with pre-developed primer/probe

Hs00174131_m1). Delta-delta CQ was calculated using the 18S ribosomal RNA primer/probe
set (4331182; Thermo Fisher). Virus RNA (vRNA) levels corresponding to those encoding
nucleocapsid proteins 1 and 2 were assessed using primer/probe mixes from IDT (2019-nCoV
RUO Kit, 10006713) and a standard curve was prepared using the 2019-nCoV_N_Positive
Control (10006625; Integrated DNA Technologies). For DMSO-soluble drugs (remdesivir and
sirolimus) the inhibition of viral growth was calculated using infected samples treated with an
equivalent amount of DMSO.
Immunofluorescence staining
Samples were fixed in neutral buffered formalin (HT501128; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at
4˚C in an externally-threaded screw-cap tube prior to removal from the BSL3. Samples were
then removed from the BSL3, and stored in PBS for 12-16 h at 4°C. Prior to staining samples
were washed 2x in PBS, and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1h. Samples were
then permeabilized in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 (BP151-500; Fisher BioReagents) for 2 h,
washed 2x in PBS, and blocked with 3.0% bovine serum albumin (A8806-5G; Sigma-Aldrich) in
PBS for 3 h at room temperature. Samples were then incubated overnight with conjugated
antibodies in sealed tubes at 4ºC. The antibodies used in this study include E-cadherin,
polyclonal nuclear capsid and spike SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and HCoV-OC43 antibodies (see
table 1). When staining for ZO-1, samples were incubated with primary rabbit anti-ZO-1
antibody overnight at 4ºC, followed by washing and incubating with conjugated secondary
antibodies (A-21433; Invitrogen) against the appropriate species for 3h at room temperature.
Antibodies to viral proteins were directly conjugated using antibody labeling kits (ThermoFisher).
For viability staining, a live/dead kit (R37601; Invitrogen) with Calcein AM and BOBO-3 Iodide
was utilized following manufacturer protocol, and Hoechst 33342 (H3570; Invitrogen) was added
to visualize nuclei. Lung tissue samples were then imaged using a Nikon A1R HD25 confocal
microscope with high-definition galvano scanner.

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Prism software (version 9.0 for Mac, GraphPad, San Diego,
CA, USA). Descriptive data were summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR). Two
sample groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Comparisons of multiple
groups over a range of virus inocula was performed using two-way ANOVA with Sidak multiple
comparison test when all groups were of equal size, or mixed-effects analysis when groups
differed in size. In multiple comparison tests, multiplicity-adjusted p values (Dunnett test) are
reported. Linear correlations between variables were assessed using Pearson coefficient.
Probability value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
We recruited 16 subjects, most of whom had at least one risk factor for severe COVID19 infection, including old age and comorbidities (Table 2).

Composition of cryopreserved lung tissue
We began by assessing the viability and integrity of cryopreserved lung tissue after 48
hours of culture. We found a comparable viability to fresh tissue when cultured for 48 h as
measured by flow cytometry (Fig 1A-B). All major subsets of cells were present in
cryopreserved tissue, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells and leukocytes (Figure 1C-D). T
cells, defined by CD3+ staining, comprised 6.3% of the total cell population, whereas alveolar
macrophages composed 1.8% and other monocytic phagocytes made up approximately 0.3%.
Each leukocyte population is consistent with previous results in which a collagenase-based
method is used to digest lung tissue (10), but flow cytometric analysis showed type 1 epithelial
cells to constitute an estimated 4% of total viable cells within the samples, lower than
approximately 8% of lung tissue reported in literature (11, 12). We attribute this to the loss of
fragile cells during processing for flow cytometry (13). To obtain a more accurate measurement
of epithelial cell viability, we imaged the samples using confocal microscopy after staining with

Calcein AM, a cell-permeable viability dye that only fluoresces in metabolically active cells, and
found an abundant population of viable cells with type I epithelial morphology within the samples
(Figure 1E). We confirmed this finding by staining the cryopreserved samples with zona
occludens-1 (ZO-1), which identifies intact tight junctions between lung epithelial cells (14), and
the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin (Figure 1F-G).

In vitro infection of lung tissue with coronaviruses
We began by infecting lung samples from two donors with each of two human
coronaviruses: HCoV-OC43, an endemic cause of the common cold (15, 16) that infects cells
via cell membrane sialyl acid groups (17, 18), and SARS-CoV-2. Both HCoV-OC43 and SARSCoV-2 could infect cryopreserved tissues in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A-B) and both
viruses were detectable within the tissues by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 protein was also detectable outside the tissue, consistent with viral
shedding. Surprisingly, we found a marked disparity in the IL6 transcriptional response to both
coronaviruses between the two donors, with a 100 fold increase in one and no change in the
other (Figure 2D).
We next sought to better assess this variance in the host response to SARS-CoV-2
infection within our tissue bank. As expected, we found an inoculum-dependent increase in viral
protein transcription (Figure 3A-B). We selected expression of IFNB1, IL6, and CXCL8 as
markers of host response, representative of overlapping transcriptional responses to viral
infection. We found highly heterogeneous responses among donors in response to the same
viral inoculum, with a range of 0 to 34-fold induction in CXCL8, 0 to 85-fold induction in IL6, and
0 to 214-fold induction in IFNB1 (Figure 3C-E). We found no correlation between the host
response and age, sex, blood type, or presence of comorbidities in this cohort (data not shown).
Comparison of cytokine induction within each donor showed that most donors displayed greater
induction of cytokine transcription with higher viral inocula (Figure 3F). Within each donor, there

was a strong correlation between the induction of IL6 and CXCL8 in response to both low and
high viral inocula (r2 >0.92), albeit with marked inter-individual variability, but no correlation
between the expression of IFNB1 with either IL6 or CXCL8 (r2 <0.1; Figure 3F and supplemental
figure).

Antiviral therapy in lung tissue culture
We reasoned that drug testing for COVID-19 relies on in vitro infection of cell lines,
which may not accurately represent the response of human tissue to infection. To assess this,
we next tested the effect of six drugs on SARS-CoV-2 viral titer in lung tissue from five different
donors and VeroE6 cells. We found that dexamethasone, a drug found to improve outcomes in
COVID-19 infection (19), reduced viral titers in all donor tissues, but not in VeroE6 cells (Figure
4A). In contrast, chloroquine reduced viral titer in VeroE6 cells but not in the lung tissue donors
(Figure 4B), consistent with prior research demonstrating that chloroquine does not inhibit viral
titer in lung epithelial cells (20, 21). Remdesivir, which has been variably effective in COVID-19
in clinical trials (22–24), did not significantly affect viral titer in any of the in vitro infections
(Figure 4C).
Finally, we tested three investigational therapies previously predicted as potentially
effective in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including sirolimus (25, 26), metformin (27–29), and Nhydroxycytidine (30). We found that sirolimus was highly effective in reducing viral titer in
tissues from three donors, but did not significantly affect titer in two donors or Vero cells (Figure
4D). A similar heterogeneity was observed with metformin (Figure 4E). N-hydroxycytidine, an
experimental drug that inhibits viral transcription (30), resulted in a significant reduction in viral
titer in all tested samples (Figure 4F). These results highlight the considerable heterogeneity of
antiviral host response and medication effectiveness in human tissues.

Discussion
The in vitro study of human lung tissues has been hampered by difficulties in growing
and maintaining 3-Dimensional tissue in culture. The current technologies to achieve this,
namely lung-on-a-chip, lung organoids, and precision-cut lung slices, have provided invaluable
insights to our understanding of the human lung. While each of these technologies has its
strengths and limitations, all are limited by the need for fresh tissues. Our study demonstrates
that polyampholyte-based cryopreservation media can be used to preserve normal and
diseased lung tissues in large batches. After cryopreservation, thawed microtissues displayed
excellent viability, were metabolically active, and contained the major cell populations of the
human lung. Our data is in agreement with previous studies demonstrating the advantages of
using polyampholyte-based media as a cryopreservative (8, 9).
A notable finding in our study was that the human tissues tested displayed similar
infectability after inoculation with a given SARS-CoV-2 dose, as measured by expression of viral
nucleocapsid proteins, suggesting that inter-individual variability in infection is not attributable to
the susceptibility of host respiratory tissues to infection (Figures 3A-B). In contrast, infection with
a given virus inoculum resulted in dramatic inter-individual heterogeneity in the cytokine
responses of the infected tissues (Figures 3C-E). In this context, multiple studies have
described the variability in host susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, using clinical outcomes,
cytokine responses, and duration and extent of viral shedding as readouts, leading to the
identification of acquired polymorphisms as risk factors for severe disease (31–37). Our data
adds to this literature by assessing the effect of a uniform viral inoculum between hosts,
allowing us to distinguish between tissue susceptibility to infection as opposed to antiviral and
inflammatory host responses.
Another important component of our work was the demonstration of antiviral drug testing
using primary human lung tissues, which represents an advance over the study of drugs in the

context of non-physiologic cell lines. In this context, we confirmed the in vivo efficacy of
dexamethasone and the ineffectiveness of chloroquine in suppressing viral growth in human
tissues. An unexpected finding in our work was the lack of effect of remdesivir in both VeroE6
cells and human tissues, in contrast to prior studies in several cell lines (38–40). One potential
explanation for this discrepancy is that these studies used a much lower MOI (of 0.05 to 0.2),
whereas we used an MOI of one in Vero cell cultures in order to inoculate with a virus titer equal
to that used in our lung culture system. In this context, one study demonstrated that remdesivir
exhibited potent antiviral activity in primary airway epithelial cells cultured using an air-liquid
interface but was not effective in reducing viral titer in Vero cells, similar to our findings (38).
Overall, the difference in experimental conditions likely explain the variance in the published
literature regarding the effectiveness of remdesivir in vitro.
Our in vitro lung tissue assay allowed us to test the predictions of a biophysical model for
the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle (41). This model predicted that targeting of transcription and
translation are especially sensitive processes that could allow effective antiviral targeting of
SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with the model predictions the transcription inhibitor N-hydroxycytidine
and the translation inhibitors metformin (41,42) and sirolimus were effective in inhibiting viral
replication for at least some of the patients. Also consistent with the model predictions, the viral
entry inhibitor, chloroquine, was not effective. The model failed to predict the lack of
effectiveness of remdesivir, which may be due to the specific properties of the drug binding in
the cells (41). The model did not make any specific prediction about dexamethasone, which
targets immunomodulators. Overall, the biophysical model points to the potential effectiveness
of targeting protein synthesis, motivating clinical testing of sirolimus and metformin, in particular.
We recognize a number of limitations in our study. First, lung tissue is currently only
viable for up to 96 hours in our culture system, thereby limiting the observations regarding
pathogenesis of infection to this short time frame. Second, like all in vitro systems, this culture
system includes non-physiologic features that may impact the biology of infection, such as non-

physiologic culture media and the absence of air. Third, the system does not capture the biology
of recruited leukocytes, which undoubtedly play an important role in the development of lung
injury in COVID-19. Fourth, the number of tissue donors in our study was limited to only 16, and
serves only as a proof-of-principle. Our study was limited in its ability to detect host factors that
may predispose to tissue infectability, aberrant host response, or effectiveness of antiviral
drugs.
The current work suggests a number of avenues for further research. First, the ability to
infect human tissues with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro allows for a systematic study of early events in
different cell types in the lung, and comparisons between different hosts, potentially leading to
new insights into disease pathogenesis and heterogeneity of disease phenotype in patients.
Second, the current system provides a platform for the study of the effectiveness of other
antiviral drugs in human tissues, in effect prioritizing drugs for in vivo testing or clinical trials.
Third, in vitro infection of human lung tissue allows for studies to define mechanisms of action
for medications. For example, the mechanisms that lead to inhibition of viral titer in response to
sirolimus, metformin, or dexamethasone are unknown. While several studies have proposed
mechanisms for metformin and sirolimus (25–27), dexamethasone is thought only to inhibit the
host response. Our data indicate that early viral replication in lung tissue may be linked to a
corticosteroid-sensitive mechanism that involves the host response to infection.
In summary, we provide evidence that human lung tissue can be utilized in vitro for the
short-term study of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A lung tissue bank may also serve as a tool for the
study of lung biology and drug screening beyond COVID-19, and facilitates the screening of
multiple donors in parallel for purposes of toxicity and efficacy in primary human tissues. We
envision that screening therapeutic agents in primary human tissue will take place after
screening in cell lines, and in parallel with testing in animal models.
