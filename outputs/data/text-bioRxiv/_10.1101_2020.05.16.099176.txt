Abstract
The severity of the new COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is strikingly
variable in different global populations. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor, TMPRSS2
protease, and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome
sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore
natural variations in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN genes. We identified two activating variants
(K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle
Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate ACE2 and
facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances TMPRSS2 cutting and, ultimately, viral
entry. We also detected deleterious variants in FURIN that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but
not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in
the ACE2 and FURIN genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed
structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2
aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between ACE2 variants
identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the
variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.

Introduction
The global pandemic COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is life-threatening and has
become a significant concern to humanity. Notably, the severity of this disease is highly variable
in different populations across the world 1. Since the outbreak, several studies have reported
specific factors including age, gender, and pre-existing health conditions that could have
contributed to the increased severity of the disease

2–4

. The genetic susceptibility to COVID-19

has also been explored by scrutinizing Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) genetic variations
in different populations. ACE2 is the functional receptor mediating entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the
host cells 5, which is facilitated by FURIN cleavage

6–8

. Transmembrane serine protease 2

(TMPRSS2) is another candidate gene that has been linked to COVID-19 disease 8–10. TMPRSS2
expression enhances ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion by operating as a co-receptor 10.
The increased cleavage activity of this protease was suggested to diminish viral recognition by
neutralizing antibodies and by activating SARS spike (S) protein for virus-cell fusion

11

and

facilitates the active binding of SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2 receptor, which is a risk factor for a
more serious COVID-19 presentation 8–10.
The hallmark of the novel SARS-CoV-2, as compared to other SARS viruses, is the
presence of a polybasic FURIN cleavage site. FURIN has been reported to facilitate the transport
of SARS-CoV-2 into or from the host cell 6–8. Notably, a recent study has highlighted the presence
of a unique functional polybasic FURIN cleavage consensus site between the two spike subunits
S1 and S2 by the insertion of 12 nucleotides encoding PRRA in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2
virus 12. The FURIN-like cleavage-site is cleaved during virus egress, which primes the S-protein
providing a gain-of-function for the efficient spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 among humans 13,14.
It is, therefore, likely that the presence of a deleterious ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN gene variants
may modulate viral infectivity among humans, making some people less vulnerable than others.
Recent studies, assessed the genetic variations and eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus)
expression profiles in the candidate genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN to demonstrate the sex
and population-wise differences that may influence the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 9,15–19. It is
to be noted that these studies focused only on the European and East Asian populations. Given the
extremely high prevalence of obesity (80%), hypertension (28%) and diabetes (20%) of the
population in the Gulf states 20–22 which are considered as risk factors for mortality from COVID-

, the witnessed low infectivity and mortality rates registered in this area of the world are

intriguing. Even though this could be due to various factors that are not well accounted for yet
such as testing, hot weather or extreme measures taken early on by some countries, it could also
be due to ethnic genetic variations in the ACE2-TMPRSS2-FURIN genes that are key regulators
for orchestrating SARS-CoV-2 cellular access.
As a result, it is crucial to study the variation of these candidate genes ACE2, TMPRSS2
and FURIN in Middle Eastern populations to better understand possible natural genetic
components that can be responsible for these differences. Here, we present a comprehensive
comparative assessment of deleterious or gain of function mutations of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and
FURIN that may have influenced disease progression in the Middle Eastern populations compared
to European, African and East Asian populations. While these findings are preliminary and based
on our genetic data and worldwide public datasets, they present a compelling perception into the
role of naturally occurring genetic variants in ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in different
populations. They can shed light on the reported variations in susceptibility or resistance to SARSCoV-2 infection in different populations and can be available for other scientists to utilize them in
precision medicine.

Results
ACE2 receptor variations in the Middle East
We first examined ACE2 gene variation frequencies in Kuwait, Qatar, East Asia, and
Africa where the impact of SARS-CoV-2 has been modest and compared it to Iran, which is
moderately affected and then to Europe, the continent with the most deaths per population. Overall,
we found human ACE2 gene variations and the probability of loss of function mutations
(pLOF=0.1, C.I. 0.04-0.25) to be low in comparison to ACE (pLOF=0.87, C.I. 0.71-1.08), which
is a gene of similar size, indicating that the ACE2 gene is highly intolerant to loss of function
mutations. Additionally, we identified 19 missense variants in the ACE2 gene from Kuwait, Qatar
and Iran (Table 1). All were rare variants defined by minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than
1%. The genetic variants included four novel variants from Kuwait, and six from Iran.

We identified four deleterious variants (rs776995986, rs769062069, rs765152220, and
rs750145841), causing R708W, R708Q, D494V, Y199C missense amino acid substitutions in the
ACE2 gene using risk prediction tools as described in the methods section (Table 1). All the ACE2
gene deleterious variants were absent from the African, East Asian and Qatari data and were very
rare in Europeans but were present at MAF of 0.063-0.5% in the Iranian population (Table 1). This
suggests a more protective effect and a significant decrease in the disease burden in Iran compared
to Europe (p<0.05; Table 2). The positions of the ACE2 receptor polymorphisms on the linearized
ACE2 protein model are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, and 3D-models for the same are shown
in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3. It is noteworthy that none of the ACE2
polymorphisms identified in this study involved the three ACE2 regions known to directly bind
the SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), namely amino acids 30-41, 82-84,
and 353-357 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Next, we examined whether natural ACE2 gene variations that increase the affinity of
ACE2 to the S-protein or facilitate viral entry/viral load exist more frequently in high-burden
compared to low-burden populations. Two such genetic variants existed in our data (Table 1). The
first, rs4646116, is a missense variant that changes a lysine amino acid at position 26 to arginine
(K26R) (Table 1). The K26, which is just proximal to the first region of the ACE2 receptor
involved in S-protein binding, has been shown previously to bind the sterically hindering first
mannose in the glycan that is linked to N90 and thus stabilizes the glycan moiety hindering the
binding of S-protein RBD to ACE2 24 (Fig. 1a). The missense variant R26 creates a new hydrogen
bond with D30, which is then poised to build a salt-bridge with the S-protein RBD K417 that
increases the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor 18 (Fig. 1b). Indeed, the ACE2 K26R
activating variant was extremely rare in East Asian (MAF=0.007%), Africans (MAF=0.095%),
but the second most common variant in Europeans with MAF of 0.587% (shown in green fonts in
Table 1). The MAF of this variant in the Kuwaiti population was nearly half that of Europeans
(MAF=0.29%), and it was absent from the Qatari and Iranian exome data (Table 1). Our structural
modeling supports the notion that K26R is an ACE2 receptor activating variant (Fig. 1a, b).
Consistent with these findings, using a synthetic human ACE2 mutant library, a recent study
reported that the R26 variant increased S-protein binding and susceptibility to the virus
significantly 25.

We also subjected novel and known ACE2 variants to structural predictions that may
impact the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells. These changes (A372G, Y199C, D225G,
F452V and V485L) were located proximal to the protein residues that mediate its activity. A
previous study indicated that the three amino acid (aa) regions 30-41, especially the residue near
lysine 31 and tyrosine 41, 82-84 and 353-357 in ACE2 were essential for the binding of S-protein
in coronavirus 26. Our structural estimation based on the 19 ACE2 missense variants identified in
Kuwaitis, Qataris and Iranians (Table 1), revealed the location of K26R variant near the aa residues
30-41 and the novel variants, S331F and T334M, adjacent to tyrosine at 353-357. The A372G is
adjacent to the zinc-binding domain (HEMGH 374-378) critical for ACE2 enzymatic activity 27.
While Y199C, D225G, F452V, and V485L all fall within the metallocarboxypeptidase domain (aa
18-617) 28 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
ACE2 N720D receptor variation and structural modeling
The second activating, and by far the most common ACE2 gene variant in Europeans
(MAF=2.52%) and Italians (MAF=1.6%; detected in 105 of 6984 exomes)

17

was rs41303171,

which replaces the amino acid asparagine at position 720 to aspartic acid (N720D) (Green font in
Table 1). This ACE2 variant was absent from the East Asian population (13,784 exomes) and was
significantly rarer in the Middle East and Africa (Table 1). This particular variant has been reported
before, but its clinical relevance was persistently dismissed because the codon 720, being far from
ACE2-Spike protein interface, does not appear to be an obvious candidate for ACE2 receptor
binding to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 18,29. However, we noted that N720D is located 4 amino
acids proximal to the TMPRSS2 cleavage site (aa 697-716) as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Recent studies demonstrated that TMPRSS2 cleavage of the ACE2 receptor increases SARS-CoV2 cellular entry 30,31. It is not unreasonable to suggest that this activating variant may play a similar
role in SARS-CoV-2, rendering people who harbor it more prone to severe infection and higher
viral load.
ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 enhances the S-protein viral entry 5. TMPRSS2 cleaves ACE2
between residues 697 and 716, which is the third and fourth helices in the C-terminal collectrin
neck domain of the dimer interface of ACE2 30. To further dissect the mechanisms underlying the
enhanced ACE2-TMPRSS2 accessibility, we performed structural analysis of the recently

published ACE2 domain bound to B0AT1 (PDB ID:6M18) 5 and showed that N720 is located on
the same interface of the loop region in close vicinity to the TMPRSS2 cleavage site (Fig. 2a).
Since loop region of protein are unordered and display conformational dynamics, a mutation close
to the cleavage site can affect the binding affinity of TMPRSS2. Therefore, we used DynaMut web
server to predict the effect of mutation N720D on the stability and flexibility of ACE2

32,33

.

Whereby, the predicted stability change was (ΔΔG): -0.470 Kcal/mol, which indicated the
destabilization of ACE2 receptor after the introduction of D720 (Fig. 2b). The N720D mutation
has resulted in an increase in entropy in the loop region (ΔΔSVib: 0.070 kcal.mol-1.K-1)

33

(Fig.

2b), depicting a more unstable state, which makes ACE2 more readily cleavable by TMPRSS2.
In addition, we modelled in the various non-covalent interactions for both N720 and mutant
D720 and other amino acids in the loop region (Fig. 2c, d). In Fig. 2c, N720 formed a backbone
hydrogen-bond with N718, this conformation also resulted in an NH-NH between E723 and S721.
Whereas, with the activating variant D720 (Fig. 2d) the back-bone hydrogen bond with N718 is
still established, however, the conformational change has resulted in a polar interaction between
the backbone D720 COO- group and backbone NH of L722, forming a weak polar interaction
(through water-mediated hydrogen bond). As such, the D720 variant altered the conformation of
the loop, and the NH-NH bond between E723 and S721 cannot be formed. Whereby, such
intermolecular amide interactions are significant for protein stability

34

. Such a change in

interatomic interactions between amino acids near the cleavage region can decrease the stability
and increase the flexibility of the loop 35, which makes it easier for TMPRSS2 to cleave.
To gain insights that are pathologically and clinically relevant, we then asked whether a
correlation exists between the N720D MAF data and mortality rates reported in corresponding
regions. We identified a significant correlation between N720D MAF and deaths per 1 million
reported from different regions (Fig. 3) with Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 99.4% (p<0.0001;
C.I. 0.945-0.99).
Next, we examined ACE2 eQTL variants in the Middle Eastern populations
(Supplementary Table 1). There were few variants in the Kuwaiti and Iranian populations that
influenced ACE2 expression. In the Qatari population the variants modifying ACE2 gene
expression were similar in frequencies to Europeans (Supplementary Table 1) with most

upregulating ACE2 expression in the brain and tibial nerve tissues (https://gtexportal.org/home/).
Notably, the tibial nerves were affected in diabetic conditions 36, which inflicts a high number of
patients in the Middle East. The most downregulating eQTL variant, rs112171234, was present in
20% and 6% of the African and Qatari populations respectively. Overall, the eQTL data pertaining
to ACE2 expression were not significantly predictive nor informative.
TMPRSS2 Variation
Five rare and one common deleterious variants were identified in the TMPRSS2 gene in
the Middle Eastern population (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary
Table 3). Overall, there was no significant conclusion that may be withdrawn from the TMPRSS2
genetic variation data. On the expression level, we discerned four TMPRSS2 eQTL variants, which
were detected only in Qataris among the Middle Eastern populations (Supplementary Table 4).
One of these variants, rs6517673 is intronic and downregulates the expression of TMPRSS2 in the
prostate. Two of the eQTL variants, rs79391937 and rs79566442, decrease the expression of the
TMPRSS2 gene in the thyroid and ovary tissues, respectively. While the variant rs11701542
upregulates the TMPRSS2 gene expression in the testis (https://gtexportal.org/home/). It is worth
noting that two-third of the mortality due to COVID-19 disease affects males 15,37.
FURIN Variation
Genetic variation analysis of the FURIN gene resulted in the identification of 13 known
missense variants (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 5). Like ACE2, all the identified variants were rare
in the Middle Eastern populations. However, unlike the ACE2 gene, no novel variants were
observed in FURIN in the Middle Eastern population (Table 3). Among the 13, we detected seven
deleterious variants suggesting a possible decrease in FURIN protease function, which can
potentially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in the studied populations. In this context, deleterious
FURIN gene variations were observed least in East Asians, Africans, followed by Europeans then
Iranians (Table 4). Interestingly, both in Qatar and Kuwait the deleterious FURIN genetic
variations were more common, suggesting a possible protective effect against the SARS-CoV-2
(p<0.05; Table 4). For example, the MAF of R37C, and R81C in Kuwait and Qatar were
0.4%/0.7% and 2.4%/3.4% respectively compared to significantly lower MAF in corresponding
variants in Europeans (p<0.05; Table 4). Together, these data support the premise that FURIN gene

variants may play important roles in protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East. It is worth
noting, however, that in Africa FURIN gene variants may not be a contributing factor in viral
protection (Table 4). We next sought to determine the extent of FURIN expression in the Middle
East. We detected 16 FURIN eQTL variants in the Middle Eastern populations, most of which
were reported in the Qatar population (Supplementary Table 5). We observed a high frequency of
the FURIN upregulating variants, rs6226 (93%) and rs8039305 (81%) in the African populations
compared to the Middle Eastern, European and East Asian populations (p<0.05) (Supplementary
Table 5). In the GeneATLAS PheWAS database

38

, these frequent variants were significantly

related to hypertension (rs6226: P=1.3569e-09, OR=1.03; rs8039305: P= 1.7643e-38, OR=1.05),
which was one of the common comorbid conditions associated with the increased risk of SARSCoV-2 infection in Chinese 2,3 and American 39 populations.

Discussion
At the time of writing this study, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 4,271,689 people worldwide,
with over 1,665,097 cases in Europe, and 1,385,834 cases in the United States, approximately
82,919 cases in China, 109,286 cases in Iran, 23,623 cases in Qatar and 9286 cases in Kuwait 1.
Mortality rates varied significantly around the world, with the highest reported deaths per 1 million
people reported in Belgium, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, and France reaching 756, 572, 508,
472, and 408 deaths/1 million respectively 1. Deaths per 1 million people in China, Japan, Qatar,
Kuwait, and South Africa were significantly lower at 3, 5, 5, 15, and 3 respectively and moderately
higher in Iran that reported the highest deaths per 1 million people in Asia at 80 deaths/1 million
people 1. The lower infection and fatality rates in developing countries obviously cannot be
attributed to increased number of tests or better medical services than what is already provided in
Europe. Moreover, prior knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome revealed by whole genome
sequencing of the virus, performed by us and others, has shown remarkable genetic similarities
among the virus

40

circulating between Qatar, Kuwait and Europe, which was attributed to

traveling and repatriation between these countries (Manuscript in preparation; GISAID

40

). For

these reasons, we argued that the most likely explanation for the differences observed in mortality
rate among countries may be attributed to genetic variation in human genes involved in SARSCoV-2 processing and cellular entry or exit. Therefore, we screened the genetic variations and
eQTL expression of the SARS-CoV-2 candidate genes, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN in three

Middle Eastern populations: Kuwaiti, Iranian, and Qatari and compared them to available MAF
data in the gnomAD database 41.
In this study we showed that amongst the nine known ACE2 missense variants, N720D
(rs41303171) and K26R (rs4646116) were the most frequent in the global datasets 18. In agreement
with our analysis, structural predictions by Stawiski and colleagues revealed that the K26R
missense variant enhanced the affinity of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 whereas N720D had little
involvement in the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction 18. Our data suggest that the ACE2 receptor
N720D variant may enhance TMPRSS2 activation and subsequent viral entry. Interestingly, the
prevalence of the most ACE2 activating variant N720D (rs41303171) was highest among
Europeans (2.5%), Iranians (0.6%) when compared to Kuwaitis (0.3%), Qataris (0.2%) and other
global populations (0.4%) and MAF of these variants significantly correlated with mortality rates
in the corresponding countries and lower infection rates in Kuwait (Fig. 3). However, further
functional assessments are required to confirm our predictions.
Additionally, we showed high prevalence of frequent deleterious FURIN variants in the
Middle Eastern populations, especially Kuwait and Qatar, which indicated decreased FURIN
protease activity that further reduces the risk of viral infection. As such, our results suggest a
possible protective role of FURIN gene variants against the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the studied
Middle Eastern populations. However, the data presented here add another variable that needs to
be urgently addressed. It is not unreasonable to suggest that European human genetic variation
presents optimal access for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas Iranian genetic background presents
sub-optimal opportunities for the infection, and finally, Kuwaitis and Qataris have the least natural
inducive genetic background in the ACE2 and FURIN proteins combined for viral entry.
While the MAF of ACE2 variant, R708W in Kuwait is 0.105%, which may indicate again
a protective role in the Kuwaiti population, the absence of this and the other four deleterious
variants from Africa, East-Asia

41

, Qatar

42

does not explain the lower disease burden in these

countries. Similarly, we did not observe a significant difference in the burden of novel deleterious
variants comparing the Kuwaiti population with Europeans (Table 2), although they may play a
protective role against COVID-19 locally. The functional roles of the two Kuwait-specific and the
two Iran-specific ACE2 deleterious novel variants Q661P (MAF=0.1%), A372G (MAF=0.2%) and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.16.099176; this version posted May 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

11

V485L (MAF=0.18%), F452V (MAF=0.08%) respectively are yet to be experimentally
determined.
Notably, the ACE2 novel variant Q661P is close to the aa region 652-659, which is
important for cleavage by the metalloprotease ADAM17. R716H and the two deleterious variants
R708W and R708Q are located within residues 697-716 essential for cleavage by TMPRSS11D
and TMPRSS2. In fact, the mutation of arginine -such as R708- and lysine residues within aa
residues 697-716 markedly reduced ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2

43

. However, it should be

mentioned that sequentially distant aa residues in the ACE2 receptor can be seen brought
structurally proximal to each other to create active sites for catalysis

28

. We illustrated this in

Supplementary Fig. 6 to show that the novel aa changes (colored green) are proximal to the protein
residues that mediate its activity (colored blue and red). Further studies are needed to directly
assess the functional aspects of the reported missense variants. We urge the international
community to assess ACE2 variation differences among people with mild/asymptomatic disease
versus patients presenting with severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Interestingly, there was not a single individual in the Middle East with ACE2 receptor
variations in amino acids known to be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding (K31, E35, D38,
M82, K353) 44. This may indicate that natural immunity conferred by the ACE2 receptor variations
is lacking or extremely rare. The rareness is evident from a recent comprehensive study that
scrutinized ACE2 gene variations in more than 290,000 individuals from 400 different worldwide
population groups and in which only eight rare ACE2 gene missense variants (K31R, E35K, E37K,
D38V, N33I, H34R, Y83H, and Q388L) with reduced binding to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2
were reported 18. Notably, this study has disproved the claim of Cao and colleagues on the absence
of such protective ACE2 variants in human populations 15.
Finally, according to the Human Protein Atlas portal, the mRNA and protein expression of
the ACE2 gene is predominant in the human testis, cardiovascular and type II pneumocytes
(https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130234-ACE2/tissue). Further, a recent study that
profiled scRNA-seq from the human testicles revealed the presence of this receptor in
Spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli Cells

45

. These findings may indicate that human testis is a

potential target for coronavirus conforming to male prevalence in infected cases. Notably, in our

12

data, Kuwaiti individuals carrying ACE2 missense variants were all males. Also, a Chinese
population study observed a higher hemizygous mutation rate in males than females 15. It is also
possible that the high hemizygosity seen in males can be responsible for male prevalence in
infected cases. This hypothesis can be further supported by the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2
virus in the semen of infected people 46,47.
In summary, we report the differential occurrence of gene variants in the Middle Eastern
populations that enrich the knowledge on the genetic susceptibility of different global populations
to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Especially that in the context of a pandemic, rare variants that
increase or decrease disease susceptibility become quantitatively important since millions of
people may be infected. The decreased burden of rare deleterious variants and the increased MAF
in variants that activate the ACE2 receptor in the European population suggest an inherent
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vice versa in the Middle Eastern population. We
understand that other confounding factors like SARS-CoV-2 testing, socioeconomical status, the
availability of proper medical services and the higher burden of other diseases may be important
contributors to the disparities seen in mortality rates around the world. It is imperative that more
comprehensive studies should be conducted as more patient data emerges from different parts of
the world. Our data are preliminary and highlight the urgent need to correlate patients’
medical/infection history to their genetic variants in order to predict in a more accurate and
personalized way how human genetic variations may influence this pandemic.

Methods
Genetic data
The whole-exome sequences data of 473 Kuwaitis 48, 800 Iranians 49 and 100 Qataris 42 published
previously were used in this analysis. The genetic data of non-Finnish European, East Asian and
African American populations were obtained from the gnomAD repository 41, which contain data
on a total of 125,748 exomes and 71,702 genomes (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/).
Gene expression data
The expression data for ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN were obtained from the genotype-tissue
expression (GTEx) database (https://gtexportal.org/home/). The same database portal was used to
extract quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the three genes.
Statistical analysis
The missense variants were defined as deleterious when predicted to be damaging, probably
damaging, disease causing and deleterious by the five algorithms applied, SIFT

50

, PolyPhen-2

HumVar, PolyPhen-2 HumDiv 51, MutationTaster 52 and LRT score 53 and/or CADD (Combined
Annotation-Dependent Depletion) score of more than 20

54

. We considered only deleterious

variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 1% in the burden analysis. The significance
of the differences in MAFs between different populations was calculated using Chi-Square test,
using the R software (https://www.r-project.org/). All the p-values presented in the tables are not
corrected for multiple testing. P values ≤0.05 were considered significant.
Structural Analysis
All the identified ACE2 missense exon variants were mapped, modeled, and analyzed using Pymol
modeling software (https://pymol.org/2/). DynaMut web server was used to predict the effect of
genetic variants on the stability and flexibility of ACE2 receptor 32,33.

Variant ID

The missense variants were defined as deleterious when predicted to be damaging, probably damaging, disease causing and deleterious by the five
algorithms applied (SIFT, PolyPhen-2 HumVar, PolyPhen-2 HumDiv, MutationTaster and LRT score) and/or CADD score of more than 20. We
considered only deleterious variants with minor allele frequency less than 1% in the burden analysis. P values are calculated using Chi-square test.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. K26R polymorphism in ACE2 mapped to the structure of ACE2, green; in complex with
S protein RBD, yellow (PDB ID: 6VW1). (a) In native ACE2, K26, magenta, forms two H-bonds
with the mannose moiety, cyan, of ACE2 N90 which may stabilize the glycan-ACE2 complex. (b)
The mutant R26, magenta, forms one H-bond with mannose. A process that could provoke the
moiety-ACE2 stability and increases the affinity of the ACE2 a-helix to S protein RBD binding,
where, R26 functions as a backbone and interacts with D30 which in turn dignified to build a saltbridge with the S protein RBD K417, yellow stick.
Figure 2. (a) ACE2 dimer complex (promoter 1 Blue), (promoter 2 white). The peptidase domain
(PD) is the site where the SARS-CoV-2 S protein ribosomal domain (RBD) binds. The C-terminal
collectrin-like domain (CLD) is the region where the TMPRSS2 cleaves ACE2. (b) Single domain
of the ACE2 mutation N720D, the red region of the protein depicted the more flexible region of
the protein due to the N720D mutation with a (ΔΔG): -0.470 Kcal/mol and ΔΔS: 0.070 kcal.mol1

.K-1 (increase of molecule flexibility). (c) Depicts N720 backbone NH forming a H-bond with

N718 and E723 forming an NH-NH bond with S721. (d) D720 backbone NH forming a H-bond
with N718 and COO- group of D720 forming a weak polar interaction with L722 backbone.
Figure 3. The plot shows the significant correlation between N720D minor allele frequency
(MAF) and deaths per 1 million reported from different regions with Pearson’s correlation
coefficient of 99.4% (p<0.0001; C.I. 0.945-0.99).
