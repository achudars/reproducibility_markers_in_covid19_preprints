Abstract

30

Objectives: Intracellular entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

31

(SARS-CoV-2) depends on the interaction between its spike protein to a cellular

32

receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and depends on

33

Furin-mediated spike 23 protein cleavage and spike protein priming by host cell

34

proteases including 24 transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Tmprss1,

35

Tmprss3, and Tmprss5 are expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons and the organ of

36

Corti in the inner ear; however, Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression profiles in the

37

middle ear remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze Ace2, Tmprss2, and

38

Furin expression in the middle and inner ear of mice.

39

Study Design: Animal research.

40

Setting: Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, University of

41

Tokyo.

42

Methods: We performed immunohistochemical analysis to examine the distribution of

43

Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in the eustachian tube, middle ear space, and cochlea of mice.

44

Results: Ace2 was expressed in the cytoplasm in the middle ear epithelium, eustachian

45

tube epithelium, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion. Tmprss2 and Furin were widely

46

expressed in the middle ear spaces and the cochlea.

47

Conclusion: Co-expression of Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in the middle ear indicates that

48

the middle ear is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections, thus warranting the use of

49

personal protective equipment during mastoidectomy for coronavirus disease

(COVID-19) patients.

Introduction

55

The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute

56

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious health concerns.

57

SARS-CoV-2 generally infects the upper respiratory tract and then spreads to various

58

organs. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, sore throat,

59

fatigue, and loss or decline of smell (anosmia or hyposmia).1-4 The Eustachian tube is

60

the conduit between the middle ear space and upper respiratory tract through which,

3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.164335; this version posted June 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

61

SARS-CoV-2 can spread into the middle ear spaces. Moreover, other human

62

coronaviruses have been identified in middle ear fluid in cases of acute otitis media or

63

otitis media with effusion.5-7 Two studies have reported the occurrence of acute otitis

64

media8 and sensorineural hearing loss9 among COVID-19 patients. Another study

65

carried out pure tone audiometry and transitory evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE)

66

analysis for 20 asymptomatic patients aged 20–50 years positive for COVID-19 on

67

reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing and reported that high-frequency pure-tone

68

thresholds and TEOAE amplitudes were significantly worse among the COVID-19

69

patients than among 20 healthy controls.10

70

Intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the interaction between viral spike

71

proteins and a cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2)11-13,

72

Furin-mediated Spike cleavage13-15, and Spike protein priming by host cell proteases

73

including transmembrane protease serine 2 (Tmprss2).13,16 Thus, Ace2, Tmprss2, and

74

Furin upregulation enhances intracellular SARS-CoV-2 entry, thus resulting in clinical

75

symptoms. Previous studies have reported 8 Tmprss genes including Tmprss2 in the

76

inner ear through RT-PCR analysis, although immunohistochemical analysis revealed

77

the expression of only Tmprss1/3/5 in the inner ear, indicating that Tmprss1/3/5 are

78

expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons and Tmprss3 is also expressed in the organ of

79

Corti.17 To our knowledge, Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression in the middle ear

80

spaces and Ace2 and Furin expression in the inner ear have not been reported.

81

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying middle ear infection and

82

sensorineural hearing loss in COVID-19, by assessing Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin

83

expression in the middle and inner ear tissues of mice.

Experimental samples

88

Tissue samples were obtained from the mice used in our previous studies because

89

the purchase of new animals has been prohibited in our facility owing to the COVID-19

90

pandemic. Tissue samples were obtained from normal 11-week-old male ICR mice, and

91

paraffin-embedded tissue samples including the middle ear spaces, Eustachian tube area,

92

and cochlea were used (Figure 1, 2). Normal tissue morphology in these regions was

Results

113

Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin were detected in the mucosal epithelium of the

114

Eustachian tube and middle ear spaces and in the cochlea, although their expression

115

pattern varied among tissues. Furthermore, Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin were

116

co-expressed in the mucosal epithelium of the Eustachian tube and the middle ear

117

spaces, the stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion cells.

118

Tmprss2 and Furin were expressed in the mucosal epithelial cells in the

119

middle ear spaces; however, Ace2 was only slightly expressed in the cytoplasm of the

120

epithelial cells (Fig.1A). Furthermore, Ace2 and Tmprss2 were expressed in the nuclei

121

of epithelial cells. Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression profiles in the Eustachian tube

122

were almost identical to those in the middle ear spaces (Fig.1B).

123

In the cochlea, Ace2 was expressed in the nuclei of the hair cells and supporting

124

cells in the organ of Corti, marginal, intermediate, and basal cells in the stria vascularis,

125

fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, and spiral ganglion cells. Furthermore, Ace2 was

126

slightly expressed in the cytoplasm of strial cells and spiral ganglion cells. Tmprss2

127

was diffusely strongly expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm in the organ of Corti,

128

stria vascularis, spiral ligament, and spiral ganglion cells, being greater in the nucleus

129

than in the cytoplasm. Furin was diffusely expressed in the cytoplasm, but not in the

130

nucleus, in the organ of Corti, stria vascularis, spiral ligament, and spiral ganglion cells

131

(Fig.2).

132
133

Discussion

134
135

This immunohistochemical study shows that Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin are

136

co-expressed in the mucosal epithelium of the Eustachian tube and middle ear spaces

137

and the organ of Corti, lateral wall, and spiral ganglion cells in the cochlea. In both

138

middle ear tissues and the cochlea, Ace2 is primarily expressed in the nucleus, while

139

Tmprss2 is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and Furin was expressed primarily

140

in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that middle ear spaces are highly susceptible to

141

SARS-CoV-2 infections spreading from the upper respiratory tract through the

142

Eustachian tube, indicating the possibility of severe sensorineural hearing loss upon

143

intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the cochlea.

144

Herein, we used ICR mice to determine the distribution of Ace2, Tmprss2, and

145

Furin in the ear tissues. We could not obtain human ear tissue samples for

146

immunostaining; hence, the expression patterns of these proteins in human ear tissues

147

might differ from those of the present mouse ear tissues. However, we previously

148

compared the Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression patterns between human and mouse

149

nasal tissues and found that their expression patterns were identical.18

150

Mastoidectomy is required during major ear surgeries including cochlear

151

implantation and middle ear surgery for extensive cholesteatoma. Mastoidectomy with a

152

high-speed drill generates massive aerosols.19 Previously, cadaveric simulation of

153

otological procedures during mastoidectomy revealed gross contamination 3 to 6 feet

154

away in all cardinal directions and more significantly on the left side, corresponding to

155

the direction of drill rotation.20 SARS-CoV-2 would substantially infect the middle ear

156

spaces because of the co-expression of Aces, Tmprss2, and Furin. Therefore, high levels

157

of personal protective equipment are strongly recommended during mastoidectomy for

158

COVID-19 patients or all mastoidectomies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

159

The cochlea is isolated and thus is generally resistant to the infection. A recent

160

systemic review on the audio-vestibular symptoms of coronavirus infections found no

161

records of audio-vestibular symptoms reported during previous coronaviral diseases

162

including SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome.21 However, Ace2, Tmprss2, and

163

Furin were co-expressed in the organ of Corti, lateral wall, and spiral ganglion cells in the

164

cochlea. Thus, similar to other viral infections including mumps, when SARS-CoV-2

165

enters the cochlea, it can cause severe labyrinthitis, resulting in marked hearing loss.

166
167

Conclusions

168

Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin are co-expressed in the mucosal epithelium of the

169

Eustachian tube and middle ear spaces and the organ of Corti, lateral wall, and spiral

170

ganglion cells in the cochlea in mice. ACE2 is primarily expressed in the nucleus,

171

Tmprss2 is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and Furin is primarily expressed in

172

the cytoplasm. These results indicate that middle ear spaces are highly susceptible to the

SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus warranting the extensive use of personal protective

equipment during mastoidectomy for COVID-19 patients.
