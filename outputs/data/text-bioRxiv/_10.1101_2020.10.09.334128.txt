HIGHLIGHTS
TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for both autophagy and flavivirus infection, however,
autophagy is not required for flavivirus infection.

TMEM41B associates with viral proteins and likely facilitates membrane remodeling to
establish viral RNA replication complexes.

TMEM41B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in
East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection.

TMEM41B-deficient cells display an exaggerated innate immune response upon high
multiplicity flavivirus infection.

SUMMARY
Flaviviruses pose a constant threat to human health. These RNA viruses are
transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks and regularly cause outbreaks.
To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection we performed full-genome loss of
function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results we focused our efforts on
characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle.
Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae
family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and
found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection.
Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent

in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies
we hypothesize that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to
facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome
replication.

INTRODUCTION
Virus outbreaks are a regular, yet unpredictable feature of an interconnected world.
Viruses of the Flaviviridae family are known to cause outbreaks worldwide and are
transmitted primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks.
Flaviviruses, members of the Flaviviridae family, are positive sense single-stranded
RNA viruses that have caused several notable outbreaks in recent history. For example,
West Nile virus (WNV) emerged in New York City in 1999, spread across the continent,
and is now endemic in the United States (Kramer et al., 2019; Roehrig et al., 2002).
Also noteworthy are the recurring yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreaks that occur in subSaharan Africa and South America despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine
(Ahmed and Memish, 2017). Most recently, the 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic swept
through South and Central America wreaking havoc on a generation of unborn children
by causing microcephaly in utero (Hills et al., 2017; Lee and Ng, 2018). In addition to
these outbreaks, Aedes albopictus, the natural vector for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV)

and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has been found consistently in recent years in Central
Europe (Muller et al., 2020), and the prevalence of tick-borne diseases is at a record
high. These alarming trends correlate with warming temperatures due to climate
change, which expand the range of mosquitoes and ticks (Brady and Hay, 2020;
Brugueras et al., 2020; Dobler, 2010; McPherson et al., 2017; Medlock et al., 2013).
These recent flavivirus outbreaks underscore the devastating impacts viral outbreaks
have on human health and the constant need for preparedness.
For many viruses with the potential to cause outbreaks there are no specific treatments.
In instances where antiviral therapies do exist, they are often virus specific. One
strategy to prepare for and respond to viral outbreaks is to develop drugs that target
host factors viruses require to complete their replication cycles. CRISPR-Cas9 gene
disruption has been used to identify host factors required for virus infection and
nominate candidate drug targets. We, like others, set out to identify factors required for
Zika virus as well as other flaviviruses. Here we present our screen results and detailed
studies focused on two autophagy related genes, transmembrane protein 41B
(TMEM41B) and vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), that were enriched in our
screens.
Autophagy, or “self-eating”, is a conserved multistep process in which cytoplasmic and
intracellular components are engulfed in double membrane structures called
autophagosomes. Following a series of maturation steps, autophagosomes ultimately
fuse with lysosomes where their contents are degraded and recycled (Dikic and Elazar,
2018). We found that the full autophagy pathway is not required for flavivirus infection;
however, TMEM41B and VMP1 are essential. In comparison to VMP1, little is known

about the cellular role of TMEM41B, and no data have been reported about the role of
TMEM41B in flavivirus infection. Here we show that TMEM41B is a pan-flavivirus host
factor that is required for all flaviviruses we tested which included both mosquito-borne
and tick-borne flaviviruses. Beyond the classical flaviviruses, we also found that
TMEM41B is required by additional members within the Flaviviridae including hepatitis
C virus (HCV) from the hepacivirus genus and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) from
the pestivirus genus. We further tested a broad panel of viruses representing 12 virus
families including negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, retroviruses and DNA
viruses, and found that of these, the only other virus that required TMEM41B was
SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae. Indeed, we recently identified TMEM41B as a top
scoring hit in multiple coronavirus genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screens,
including screens with SARS-CoV-2 (see accompanying manuscript (Schneider et al.,
2020)). It is possible that coronaviruses and flaviviruses require TMEM41B for a similar
step in their replication cycles. The mechanistic studies we present here demonstrates
that TMEM41B relocalizes upon flavivirus infection and associates with viral proteins,
nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) and NS4B, which are known to form membrane-bound
viral RNA replication complexes (Neufeldt et al., 2018; Paul and Bartenschlager, 2015).
These and other data we present suggest that TMEM41B is likely hijacked during the
flavivirus replication cycle to facilitate the membrane remodeling necessary for
replication of viral RNA.
RESULTS
Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens for Zika and yellow fever viruses identify
TMEM41B and VMP1 as required host factors.

To identify host factors required for ZIKV and YFV, we performed pooled genome-wide
CRISPR knockout (KO) screens in B3GALT6-deficient human haploid (HAP1) cells. We
used B3GALT6 KO cells to potentially decrease cellular heparan sulfate (HS) protein
glycosylation which has been shown to nonspecifically facilitate virus binding and
subsequent entry (Cagno et al., 2019). We hypothesized that this alteration in surface
protein glycosylation would decrease the enrichment and overabundance of hits related
to HS protein glycosylation and nonspecific virus binding. Nevertheless, consistent with
a wide range of virus-selected genome-wide loss of function screens (Hoffmann et al.,
2017; Jae et al., 2014; Realegeno et al., 2017; Riblett et al., 2016), we identified host
factors involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis.
Like other flavivirus host factor screens, we identified genes that are involved in
oligosaccharide transfer, and genes involved in protein translocation and folding into the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 1A) (Marceau et al., 2016; Savidis et al., 2016;
Zhang et al., 2016). Outside of these categories, TMEM41B was among the top scoring
genes. Little is known about the cellular function of TMEM41B; however, three
independent genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screens identified TMEM41B
as a gene that plays an important role in autophagy (Moretti et al., 2018; Morita et al.,
2019; Shoemaker et al., 2019). These groups went on to show that TMEM41B is
functionally similar to VMP1, which is known to have a role in lipid mobilization and
autophagy (Morishita et al., 2019; Ropolo et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2017).
There are numerous, sometimes conflicting reports, which indicate that autophagyrelated genes can promote or restrict Flaviviridae infection. This literature has been
recently reviewed by Po-Yuan Ke (Ke, 2018). Our identification of TMEM41B prompted

us to interrogate our screen data further for genes involved in autophagy. Of a list of
genes with an established role in autophagy, only TMEM41B and VMP1, which act at
the early stage of autophagy, scored positively (Figure 1B). This list, however, is not
comprehensive, and therefore we next compared our ZIKV screen results to those from
a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen that was designed to identify novel genes
required for autophagy (Moretti et al., 2018). As shown in Figure 1C, these two screens
showed no overlap with the exception of two genes: TMEM41B and VMP1.

The VTT domain proteins TMEM41B and VMP1 are required for flavivirus
infection
TMEM41B and VMP1 are multipass transmembrane proteins that share a stretch of
amino acids recently named the VTT domain based on homology among VMP1,
TMEM41A/B, and TMEM64 (Morita et al., 2019). Given this homology and the fact that
both TMEM41B and VMP1 were top scoring hits in our flavivirus screens, we sought to
test all four members of the VTT domain family for their requirement in flavivirus
infection. Further, in addition to ZIKV and YFV (strain: Asibi) used in our screens, we
expanded our collection of flaviviruses for these experiments to include three additional
flaviviruses: the YFV 17D (vaccine strain), DENV-2, and WNV.
To test which of the four VTT domain-containing proteins are required for flavivirus
infection, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption to generate clonal HAP1 cell lines
individually lacking VMP1, TMEM41A, TMEM41B, and TMEM64 (Figure S1A). We then
infected three to five independent knockout (KO) clones for each of these candidate

host factors with each of the five flaviviruses listed above or with human parainfluenza
virus 3 (hPIV-3) as a non-flavivirus control. Consistent with our screening results, we
found that of these four VTT domain-containing proteins, only TMEM41B and VMP1 are
required for flavivirus infection as cells deficient for these two proteins do not support
virus replication (Figure 1D, H and S1B, D, F). While TMEM41B was not required for
hPIV-3 infection (Figure S1H), decreased growth of hPIV-3 was observed in the VMP1
KO clones. VMP1 KO clones appear less viable and grow slower compared to WT cells,
which likely accounts for the slight decrease in replication seen for the control virus,
hPIV-3 (Figure S1H).
We next expressed each of the four VTT domain-containing proteins individually in
TMEM41B KO and VMP1 KO cells to test their ability to restore virus infection. As
expected, TMEM41B overexpression completely restored infection in TMEM41B KO
cells. Interestingly, we found that VMP1 and TMEM41A overexpression could also
partially compensate for the lack of TMEM41B during flavivirus infection; however
TMEM41A was less efficient at restoring infection compared to VMP1. In contrast, only
VMP1 was able to rescue infection in VMP1 KO cells (Figure 1E, F, I, J). Furthermore,
VMP1 expression restored the aforementioned observed decrease in cell viability in
VMP1 KO cells and also rescued hPIV-3 replication (Figure S1J, K). The capacity of
VMP1 to rescue a TMEM41B defect but not vice versa is consistent with what has been
shown for TMEM41B and VMP1 in the context of autophagy (Morita et al., 2019).

Classical autophagy proteins BECN1, ATG5, and ATG7 are not required for
flavivirus infection in HAP1 cells
Since both TMEM41B and VMP1 have been shown to be involved in autophagy, we
hypothesized that other canonical autophagy related genes could be essential for
flavivirus infection (Moretti et al., 2018; Morita et al., 2019; Ropolo et al., 2007;
Shoemaker et al., 2019). To test this hypothesis, we generated clones lacking BECN1,
ATG5, and ATG7, which are known to play a critical role in autophagy (Kang et al.,
2011; Mizushima et al., 1998; Tanida et al., 1999). We confirmed KO in these clones by
genome sequencing as well as by western blot (for ATG5 and ATG7) (Figure S1L).
While ATG5 and ATG7 KO clones already lack lipidated LC3 II at baseline levels
(indicative of defective autophagy (Tanida et al., 2008; Tanida and Waguri, 2010)), we
sought to test ATG7 KO clones in addition for their ability to respond to classical
autophagy stimuli (e.g., starvation and treatment with Torin 1 in the presence of
chloroquine). As expected, ATG7-deficient cells are unable to mount an autophagy
response. This is shown by western blot in Figure S1M, where autophagy results in
LC3 I lipidation and conversion to LC3 II in WT cells but not in ATG7 KO HAP1 clones
(Tanida et al., 2008; Tanida and Waguri, 2010). We then tested these autophagydeficient cells for their ability to support flavivirus infection and found that cells lacking
BECN1, ATG5, or ATG7 retained their ability to support flavivirus infection (Figure 1G,
K and S1C, E, G, I). These data suggest that autophagy alone is not necessarily
required for flavivirus infection. This does not, however, rule out the possibility that noncanonical autophagy mechanisms are required for flavivirus infection nor does it
suggest TMEM41B and VMP1 are the only autophagy factors required for flavivirus

infection. In fact, two other non-classical autophagy genes were highly enriched in our
YFV screen (TBC1D5 and TBC1D20) and in our ZIKV screen (TBC1D20) underscoring
the complex interplay between flavivirus replication and the autophagy pathway
(Popovic et al., 2012; Popovic and Dikic, 2014; Sidjanin et al., 2016; Sklan et al., 2007)
(Figure 1A, B).
TMEM41B is a pan-flavivirus host factor
We have shown that mosquito-borne flaviviruses require TMEM41B for infection. To
gain additional insight into the requirement of this host factor for viral infection, we
extended our studies to include tick-borne flaviviruses, viruses from additional genera
within the Flaviviridae family, and a diverse panel of unrelated viruses.
The tick-borne flaviviruses we tested include Powassan virus (POWV), a BSL3
pathogen currently expanding in North America in Ixodes ticks (Dennis et al., 1998;
Ebel, 2010; Eisen et al., 2016), and five BSL4 pathogens: two strains of tick-borne
encephalitis virus (TBEV) representing the European and Far Eastern clade, and three
hemorrhagic fever viruses, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur forest
disease virus (KFDV), and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV). In addition, we
generated TMEM41B KO clones in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7.5) and bovine
MBDK cells to test additional members in the Flaviviridae: HCV in the hepacivirus genus
and BVDV in pestivirus genus. As shown in Figure 2A-D, all of these viruses require
TMEM41B for infection. This demonstrates that TMEM41B is a pan-flavivirus host
factor.

Flaviviruses replicate in a variety of tissue types. Therefore, we generated TMEM41B
KO and reconstituted cell clones in additional mammalian cell lines representing
different tissue types including lung carcinoma (A549) and placenta carcinoma (JEG3)
epithelial cells. In addition, we knocked out and reconstituted the mosquito TMEM41B
homologue in C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus) and Aag2 cells (Aedes aegypti) to
determine if TMEM41B was necessary for flavivirus infection in the mosquito vector. We
found that TMEM41B was required in nearly all virus-cell combinations (Figure 2E and
S2A-L). However, we observed several virus-cell combinations where TMEM41B
appears to be less critical. For example, whereas TMEM41B is critical for YFV infection
in HAP1, JEG3, and A549 cells, it is not required in Huh-7.5 cells. Notably we even
observed differences in the requirement for TMEM41B among two strains of the same
virus: the wildtype Asibi strain of YFV and the 17D vaccine strain that differ by only 31
amino acids (Figure 1H, S1B and S2A, D, F) (dos Santos et al., 1995). Given that
VMP1 can compensate for TMEM41B deficiency, we hypothesized that differences in
TMEM41B and VMP1 expression among cell types could potentially explain this
variability. We therefore performed western blots on HAP1, JEG3, A549, and Huh-7.5
cell lysates to compare VMP1 and TMEM41B abundance. We found that full-length
TMEM41B is highly expressed in HAP1 and JEG3 cells, but present at much lower
abundance in A549 and Huh-7.5 cells. Further, the TMEM41B antibody detects several
abundant lower molecular weight bands in A549 cells that may or may not be
TMEM41B isoforms. VMP1, in contrast, is expressed at much lower levels in HAP1 cells
compared to JEG3, A549, and Huh-7.5 cells (Figure S2M). While speculative, we posit
that the differential requirement for TMEM41B that we observe in some virus-cell

combinations is due to differences in TMEM41B and VMP1 abundance among cell
types and the extent to which VMP1 can compensate for TMEM41B deficiency.
Given that TMEM41B is broadly required among members of the Flaviviridae, we
posited that other more distantly related viruses or unrelated viruses may share a
similar requirement for TMEM41B. Using the TMEM41B KO and reconstituted HAP1
cells, we queried the TMEM41B requirement for a diverse panel of viruses including
negative- and positive-sense RNA viruses, retroviruses and DNA viruses. Interestingly,
we found that Coxsackievirus 3B (CVB3) infection is enhanced in the absence of
TMEM41B, whereas infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the Coronaviridae, is
impaired similar to the viruses in the Flaviviridae, suggesting that it also requires
TMEM41B for infection. Aside from these two viruses, none of the other viruses tested
were affected by the lack of TMEM41B (Figure 2F-I). Our observation that SARS-CoV2 requires TMEM41B for infection is supported by our recent coronavirus genome-wide
CRISPR screening and validation results (see accompanying manuscript: (Schneider et
al., 2020)).
Functional TMEM41B is conserved across mammalian and vector species
There are four reported TMEM41B isoforms in humans, however, only isoform 1
encodes a fully intact VTT domain. To determine if any of the other three isoforms can
support flavivirus infection, we cloned and expressed each isoform in TMEM41B KO
cells. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the first ~47 amino acids of
TMEM41B are unstructured (Kelley et al., 2015). Therefore, we also generated a
deletion mutant of isoform 1 lacking the first 47 amino acids. A diagram of these

TMEM41B constructs is shown in Figure 3A. We found that only the full length and N
terminal truncated isoform 1 proteins were able to fully support YFV and ZIKV infection
in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells; however, isoform 4, which contains half of the VTT
domain, partially supported YFV infection (Figure 3B). From this we conclude that the
TMEM41B VTT domain is required to support flavivirus infection whereas the N
terminus is dispensable.
It was previously reported that TMEM41B physically interacts with VMP1, raising the
possibility that this interaction may be important for membrane remodeling in the early
stages of autophagy (Morita et al., 2019). Based on this observation we hypothesized
that evolutionarily divergent TMEM41B homologues may not support flavivirus infection
in mammalian cells, given that there are extensive amino acid differences among the
mosquito, tick, and human TMEM41B homologues that may prohibit their interaction
with human VMP1 (Ishii and Akira, 2005) (Figure 3D). To test if mosquito or tick
TMEM41B homologues could support flavivirus infection, we expressed TMEM41B
homologues from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and Ixodes
scapularis ticks in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells and challenged them with YFV and ZIKV.
To our surprise, we found that all three TMEM41B homologues supported virus infection
in mammalian cells (Figure 3C). This suggests that despite amino acid differences,
evolutionarily divergent TMEM41B homologues can either functionally interact with
human VMP1, or that a direct protein-protein interaction between TMEM41B and VMP1
is not required to support flavivirus infection. As expected, neither TMEM41B KO nor
expression of any of these TMEM41B constructs affected hPIV-3 infection (Figure S3A,
B).

Naturally occurring TMEM41B SNPs negatively impact flavivirus infection
Viruses and other pathogens have shaped human genetics over millennia. In the face of
strong evolutionary pressure, naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) can be enriched or purged from human populations. We investigated if any
missense variants existed in human TMEM41B and found a SNP (rs78813996) at
amino acid position 266 that results in an Ile266Val/Leu substitution with Val being the
most prevalent variant. This SNP is nearly absent in European and African populations
but is present at ~3.5% frequency in the Latin American population and at a striking

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs78813996) (Figure 4A).
We engineered these amino acid variants into a TMEM41B expression construct with a
red fluorescent protein (tagRFP) fused to the N terminus. Western blot confirmed that
both the tagRFP-TMEM41B wildtype and SNP I266L and I266V variants were
expressed to similar levels in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells (Figure S4A, B). We then
challenged these cells with YFV and found that at 48 h post infection, the percent
infection in cells expressing the I266L and I266V variants was reduced by 50% and that
these cells produced 10-fold less virus as compared to cells expressing wild type
TMEM41B (Figure 4B). Consistent with these results, we then tested ZIKV, DENV, and
WNV and found similar results to that of YFV, whereas the hPIV-3 control was
unaffected (Figure 4C). These results suggest that naturally occurring variants in
TMEM41B reduce infection in cell culture and could potentially affect flavivirus
pathogenesis in human populations.

TMEM41B SNP constructs are able to maintain normal lipid distribution in cells
While culturing TMEM41B KO Huh-7.5 cells, we observed a striking visual accumulation
of lipids. To confirm these were indeed lipid droplets, we stained wildtype and six
independent TMEM41B KO Huh-7.5 clones with Nile red and found that in all clones
lipid droplets are considerably larger as compared to wildtype cells (Figure 4D). We
then quantified this observation by measuring the area of individual droplets from a
single imaging plane in at least 23 cells per clone and found that the average size of
individual lipid droplets was up to 10 times larger among TMEM41B KO clones relative
to wildtype cells (Figure 4E). Moretti et al. reported a similar observation in TMEM41B
KO H4 neuroglioma cells and it was later shown that these droplets contain neutral and
sterol lipids (Kang et al., 2020; Moretti et al., 2018).
Having found that two naturally occurring TMEM41B variants, I266L and I266V, have a
reduced capacity to support flavivirus infection, we next tested if these variants were
able to rescue the enlarged lipid droplet phenotype. In addition to the two human
variants, we also included the Aedes aegypti TMEM41B homologue. As shown in
Figure 4F, we found that expression of wildtype human and mosquito TMEM41B as
well as the two human TMEM41B SNP variants all reduced lipid droplets back to
baseline. These results suggest that while these two SNPs negatively impact flavivirus
infection, they appear to be fully functional in their ability to maintain normal lipid
distribution as measured in this assay.

Next, we assayed whether the cellular localization of TMEM41B changed upon virus
infection. We utilized the tagRFP-TMEM41B expression construct to monitor TMEM41B
cellular localization prior to and during flavivirus infection. Previous imaging and
proteomics experiments have shown that TMEM41B localizes to ER membranes
(Moretti et al., 2018; Morita et al., 2019). Our observations in TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells
expressing tagRFP-TMEM41B are consistent with ER localization. Interestingly,
however, upon infection with either YFV or ZIKV, we observed a striking re-localization
of tagRFP-TMEM41B from a diffuse reticular-like pattern to a large cytosolic aggregate
that co-localizes with viral nonstructural proteins, NS4A (ZIKV) and NS4B (YFV) (Figure
5A). NS4A and NS4B are multipass transmembrane proteins known to induce
membrane curvature, which, together with additional nonstructural viral and likely host
proteins, form the viral RNA replication complex.
To further confirm that TMEM41B co-localizes with NS4A and NS4B, we next performed

these results suggest that TMEM41B is likely recruited to sites of viral RNA replication
either indirectly or potentially by direct interaction with NS4A and/or NS4B.
Adaptive mutations in NS4A and NS4B restore flavivirus infectivity in TMEM41B
KO cells
Viruses exist as diverse populations of variants and can readily adapt to new
environments. These genetic adaptations can highlight viral proteins or viral RNA
structures that are under selective pressure in a given context. Throughout our
experiments, we often observed rare YFV and ZIKV antigen positive cells after infecting
clonal TMEM41B KO populations. To gain potential insight into which stage of the virus
replication cycle was affected by the absence of TMEM41B, we sought to capitalize on
these rare infection events to select for adaptive mutations within the viral genome. We
did this by serial passaging of ZIKV-infected cells and culture supernatants to select
viral variants capable of replicating in TMEM41B-deficient cells. We performed virus
supernatant passaging experiments in human TMEM41B KO A549 and HAP1 cells, and
in parallel, we passaged ZIKV-infected TMEM41B KO mosquito Aag2 cells. Serial
passages were performed in multiple independent lineages for each cell type, and we
similarly passaged virus in wildtype cells to control for cell culture adaptive mutations
that arise which are unrelated to TMEM41B KO. Figure 6A shows a graphical outline of
these experiments.
After 15-20 rounds of passaging, we deep-sequenced viral cDNA from cell supernatants
to identify viral variants that were enriched in virus populations passaged in TMEM41B
KO cells relative to virus populations passaged in wildtype cells. To qualify as a

potential adaptive mutation, we applied a stringency filter that required mutations to be
present in at least three independent passages (regardless of cell type) and not present
in virus that had been passaged in wildtype cells. Remarkably, all mutations that met
these criteria were located in NS4A and NS4B. Further, NS4B mutations at positions
Ile42 and Ser236 were selected in both mosquito and mammalian cells (Figure 6B).
To confirm that these mutations we selected enable ZIKV to infect TMEM41B-deficient
cells, we chose to introduce two mutations in NS4B, Ile42Thr and Phe91Tyr, into the
infectious cDNA clone of the Cambodian ZIKV strain FSS13025 (Shan et al., 2016), and
we generated viral stocks. Figure 6C and D demonstrates that these individual point
mutations in NS4B render ZIKV infectious in both mosquito (Aag2) and mammalian
(A549) TMEM41B KO cells.
Wild and vaccine strain chimeras overcome TMEM41B deficiency
As shown in Figure 2E and S2A, we observed that two highly similar strains of YFV—
the parental Asibi strain and the 17D vaccine strain—were differentially sensitive to
TMEM41B deficiency in A549 cells. The live-attenuated YFV 17D strain differs from the
Asibi strain by only 31 amino acids, three of which are located within NS4A (V107I) and
NS4B (M95I and Y232H) (dos Santos et al., 1995). Given the strain-specific differences
we observed in TMEM41B KO A549 cells, together with the observation that single
amino acid changes in NS4A and NS4B could allow flavivirus replication in TMEM41B
KO cells, we next generated 17D:Asibi chimeric viruses by swapping NS4A and NS4B
individually, or by swapping the region containing both NS4A and NS4B which includes
the 2K protein. Remarkably, we found that in the 17D viral background, NS4B from the

Asibi strain significantly increased infection in TMEM41B KO A549 cells, whereas the
NS4B from the 17D strain slightly decreased the infectivity of the Asibi strain in
TMEM41B KO cells. In contrast, the NS4A changes had no impact on infection.
Importantly, parallel infections in wildtype A549 cells show that the results observed in
the KO cells are not due to an overall increase or decrease in viral replication, but rather
were likely due to a differential requirement for TMEM41B in this cellular context
(Figure 6E, F).
TMEM41B KO cells mount an exaggerated innate immune response to flavivirus
inoculum
During the process of studying infection of TMEM41B KO cells, we observed an
apparent cytotoxicity with high virus inocula (MOI > 5 PFU/cell) that was not seen with
similar inocula to wildtype cells. We hypothesized that this cytotoxicity may have
resulted from an exaggerated innate immune response due to increased exposure of
viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in TMEM41B-deficient cells. This hypothesis is
based on recent evidence supporting a role for TMEM41B in mobilizing lipids and
inducing membrane curvature (Moretti et al., 2018; Morita et al., 2019), and our own
data which indicates that TMEM41B is likely recruited to flavivirus replication
complexes. Flavivirus replication complexes are sites at which viral RNA replication
machinery assembles within invaginations into the ER lumen utilizing host curvaturestabilizing proteins (Aktepe and Mackenzie, 2018; Neufeldt et al., 2018; Rajah et al.,
2020). Within these structures, dsRNA intermediates that form during viral RNA
replication are protected from host innate immune sensors that survey the cytosol for
pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the absence of TMEM41B, viral

RNA replication may initiate in aberrant replication complexes that are exposed to the
cytosol.
To test if the observed cytotoxicity was due to innate immune activation, we inoculated
wildtype and TMEM41B KO HAP1 cells with a high YFV 17D virus inoculum (MOI = 0.4
PFU/cell), then quantified viral RNA and mRNA encoding 2’-5’-oligoadenylate
synthetase 1 (OAS1) by qPCR at 24 h post infection. OAS1 is a classic interferon (IFN)
stimulated gene (ISG) induced by type I and III IFNs. As shown in Figure 7A, we found
that YFV 17D RNA levels were 100-fold lower in TMEM41B KO cells compared to
wildtype cells, consistent with an inability to replicate. Supporting our hypothesis, OAS1
was highly induced in the KO cells but not induced in wildtype cells. To determine if
OAS1 induction was due to the virus itself or functional viral RNA, we inoculated both
wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells with viral particles inactivated by UV light. UVinactivated virus failed to induce OAS1 expression in both cell lines suggesting that viral
protein production and perhaps initiation of viral RNA replication was required to induce
innate immunity (Figure 7B). To control for the possibility that TMEM41B KO cells are
hypersensitive to PAMPs in general, we infected both wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells
with a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) lacking a critical innate immune antagonist
protein, NS1 (IAV ΔNS1). This virus is well known for its defect in antagonizing IFN
production and ISG expression (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2000). We
found that both wildtype and TMEM41B KO responded to IAV ΔNS1 as expected, with
wildtype cells expressing even slightly higher amounts of OAS1 mRNA than TMEM41B
KO cells (Figure 7B).

Upon detection of viral PAMPs, cells secrete IFN to protect neighboring cells from
infection then subsequently initiate apoptosis (Drappier and Michiels, 2015; Gusho et
al., 2020; Schwartz and Conn, 2019). To assay if the cytotoxicity we observed in
TMEM41B KO cells after inoculation with high viral loads was in fact apoptosis, we
inoculated wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells with a high YFV 17D inoculum (MOI = 4
PFU/cell) and quantified the number of apoptotic cells at 24 h post inoculation. As
shown in Figure 7C, we observed an approximate three-fold increase in the percentage
of apoptotic cells in TMEM41B KO cells compared to wildtype cells. Importantly, at this
early time point, there was almost no increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in the
infected wildtype cell population as compared to mock-infected cultures. Further, the
positive control, staurosporine (STS), induced apoptosis in approximately 70% of the
cells, with no notable difference between wildtype and TMEM41B KO cells (Figure
7C).

DISCUSSION
Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 gene disruption screens are a powerful method of
discovery. We applied this method to discover cellular host factors that flaviviruses
require to replicate in human cells. As a testament to the robustness of this approach,
our results along with CRISPR-Cas9 screens performed by research groups using
different flaviviruses, different cell types, and different sgRNA libraries identified many
shared genes and biological pathways. Screens, however, are often only the first step
towards understanding new virus-host biology.

From our loss-of-function screens using a ZIKV isolate from Puerto Rico (PRVABC59)
and the Asibi strain of YFV, we noted a strong dependence on an obscure host factor
with a generic name: TMEM41B. During the course of our studies, TMEM41B was
independently identified by several groups that performed CRISPR-Cas9 loss-offunction screens designed to uncover novel regulators of autophagy. As a result, a
cellular role for TMEM41B began to emerge.
In our validation studies we found that all flaviviruses we tested, including both
mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses, required TMEM41B for infection and
replication. Further, we found that TMEM41B was required in the mosquito vector as
well, supporting a conserved role for TMEM41B in flavivirus infection in distantly related
species. Given that TMEM41B is required for flavivirus infection and that TMEM41B is
also required for autophagy, the question arose: is autophagy required for flavivirus
infection? To address this question, we generated CRISPR KO cell lines lacking
BECN1, ATG5, and ATG7 since these genes are known to have critical roles in cellular
autophagy. Our results suggest that under the conditions we tested the full autophagy
pathway is not essential for flavivirus infection. This is also indirectly supported by the
fact that VMP1 and TMEM41B are the only hits shared among our ZIKV CRISPR-Cas9
screen and a CRISPR-Cas9 autophagy screen. This led us to hypothesize that
flaviviruses may hijack TMEM41B and VMP1 for their ability to remodel host cell
membranes–a feature required both for autophagy and for the formation of viral
replication complexes.
Although every flavivirus we tested required TMEM41B in most cell types, there were
several virus-cell combinations we tested where TMEM41B was either not required or

played a less essential role in virus infection. This conundrum may be explained by cell
type-specific differences in the abundance of structurally or functionally related cellular
host proteins such as VMP1 and TMEM41A, which we found can partially support
flavivirus infection in the absence of TMEM41B. These findings suggest that TMEM41B
may be an important cellular determinant that defines flavivirus tissue tropism and
pathogenesis. Along these lines, it is notable that a SNP in TMEM41B present in
approximately 20% of East and South East Asian and 3.5% of Latin American
populations has a reduced capacity to support flavivirus infection. While it is nearly
impossible to know for sure what drove selection of this SNP in these populations, it is
conceivable that a pathogenic flavivirus may have been involved.
While variations in the host environment can influence virus tropism, so too can
variations in the virus. Our studies uncovered that two highly related yellow fever
viruses, the virulent Asibi strain and the live attenuated 17D vaccine strain, displayed a
differential ability to infect JEG3 and A549 cells lacking TMEM41B. The fact that the
YFV Asibi and 17D strains differ by only 31 amino acids provided us with an opportunity
to potentially isolate the flavivirus TMEM41B dependency down to the level of an
individual viral protein. Concurrently, we made additional observations that suggested
amino acid differences in NS4A and NS4B between these two strains may be
responsible for their differential TMEM41B requirement. These observations included
our findings that (i) TMEM41B relocalizes upon flavivirus infection and colocalizes with
NS4A and NS4B, (ii) TMEM41B co-immunoprecipitated with NS4A and NS4B in
flavivirus-infected cells, and (iii) mutations within ZIKV NS4A and NS4B can
compensate for the lack of TMEM41B. Based on these data, we made 17D:Asibi

chimeric viruses and found that two amino acid differences within NS4B were sufficient
to confer or bypass TMEM41B dependence. Future studies are needed to better
understand how only one or a few amino acids changes in NS4A and NS4B are able to
bypass the strong TMEM41B requirement during flavivirus infection. Together these
results highlight remarkable plasticity even among "essential" host factors and
demonstrate that loss of a critical host factor can be overcome by relatively few genetic
changes in the viral genome. This contrasts the notion that resistance barriers may be
higher when targeting host factors with antiviral therapeutics as opposed to targeting the
virus. When dealing with highly diverse viral populations, multi-target drug cocktails are
still likely to be important regardless of whether therapies target host or viral factors.
Our final observation where we demonstrate that TMEM41B cells initiate a strong innate
immune response when exposed to a large number of virus particles provides
mechanistic insights into the role of TMEM41B in the flavivirus replication cycle. Based
on our collective results together with what is known about the role of TMEM41B in lipid
mobilization and inducing membrane curvature, we propose a model, shown in Figure
7D, where upon flavivirus infection and translation of the viral polyprotein, TMEM41B is
recruited to sites on the ER membrane together with NS4A and NS4B where replication
complexes are forming (Neufeldt et al., 2018; Paul and Bartenschlager, 2015). This
recruitment may be through direct protein:protein interaction or through passive
diffusion, where, by mobilizing neutral and sterol lipids, TMEM41B helps lower the local
free energy imposed by NS4A- and NS4B-induced membrane curvature. We propose
that TMEM41B’s role in facilitating membrane curvature is dependent upon a functional
interaction between TMEM41B and VMP1, the latter of which is highly mobile and

associates with cell organelles, vesicles and lipid droplets (Tabara and Escalante, 2016;
Zhao et al., 2017). In the absence of TMEM41B, flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins
assemble and viral RNA replication initiates, but because replication complexes are
improperly formed, dsRNA intermediates are exposed to pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs). At this point, the infectious replication cycle is aborted, either due to an innate
immune response or simply because the RNA genome cannot be efficiently copied.
Future work is needed to thoroughly test this model and understand how TMEM41B
works together with viral proteins and other host factors during assembly of flavivirus
replication complexes.
Lastly, during our studies, we uncovered a role for TMEM41B in the coronavirus
replication cycle. Recently, we and others also identified TMEM41B as a top scoring hit
in genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function screens designed to identify coronavirus
host dependency factors ((Baggen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) and accompanying
manuscript: (Schneider et al., 2020)). It will be fascinating to learn if TMEM41B is also
required to assemble coronavirus replication complexes. In conclusion, TMEM41B may
be a candidate target to inhibit the replication of a broad range of emerging and reemerging flavivirus and coronavirus pathogens.

METHODS
Screen
HAP1 B3GALT6 KO-Cas9 cells were generated by lentiviral transduction of lentiCas9Blast, a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene: #52962; http://n2t.net/addgene: 52962; RRID:
Addgene_52962), followed by selection and expansion in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml
blasticidin. The human GeCKO library (A and B) (Shalem et al., 2014) was a gift from
Feng Zhang and obtained through Addgene (cat. #1000000049). The plasmid was
expanded and lentivirus was produced as previously described (Shalem et al., 2014).
To deliver the GeCKO (A and B) sgRNA library to cells, 2.03 x 108 HAP1-Cas9 cells
were transduced at MOI = 0.4 to achieve ~1,600-fold overrepresentation of each
sgRNA. Two days later, media was replaced with fresh media containing 1.5 μg/ml
puromycin and cells were expanded for six additional days prior to seeding for ZIKV or
YFV infection.
We seeded cells at 3.5 x 106 cells per T175 flask and we seeded 15 flasks per replicate
(in triplicate) for each virus infection as well as Mock. The following day, the media was
removed and viruses diluted in 10 ml/flask OptiMEM were added to cells. ZIKV was
added at MOI = 0.025 PFU/cell and YFV Asibi was added at MOI = 0.5 PFU/cell. After
three hours on a plate rocker at 37 °C, plates were moved to 5% CO2 incubators set to
37 °C. Media was changed three days later. Media was changed every 3-4 days to
remove dead cells. Mock cells were passaged every 3-4 days and re-seeded at 3.5 x
106 cells/flask to maintain library complexity. Cells were harvested approximately twenty
days post infection.

Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated via DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen: 69504) per
the manufacturer’s instructions. The library was amplified from gDNA as previously
described (Yau and Rana, 2018). PCR products were agarose gel purified pooled, and
sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at the MSKCC Integrated Genomics Operation
using standard Nextera sequencing primers and 50 cycles.
Analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen data
FASTQ files were processed and trimmed to retrieve sgRNA target sequences followed
by enumeration of sgRNAs in the reference sgRNA library file using MAGeCK (Li et al.,
2014). Z-scores were computed using the following approach: for each condition, the
log2 fold change with respect to the initial condition was computed. A natural cubic
spline with 4 degrees of freedom was fit to each pair of infected and control cells and
residuals were extracted. To obtain gene-wise data, the mean residuals for each group
of sgRNAs was calculated, a z-score was computed, and a p-value was determined
using a 2-sided normal distribution test. P-values were combined across screens using
Fisher’s sumlog approach and corrected for multiple testing using the method of
Benjamini & Hochberg.
Cell Culture

Lentivirus Production and Transduction
All ORFs were cloned into a modified pTRIPZ vector for lentivirus delivery to cells. All
plasmid sequences are available upon request. Lentivirus stocks were generated in
Lenti-X™ 293T cells by co-transfection of plasmids expressing (1) the ORF of interest
(2), HIV gag-pol, and (3) the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) in a ratio of
0.55:0.35:0.1 using LipofectamineTM 2000 at a ratio of 2.5 µl reagent to 1 µg DNA. One
day prior to transfection, cells were seeded at 4 x 10 5 cells per well of poly-L-lysine
coated 6-well plates. Cells were transfected the following day and six hours post
transfection media was removed and lentivirus was collected overnight in 2 ml per well.
Supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h, filtered using 0.45-micron syringe filters,
and stored at -80 °C
For lentiviral transduction, 3 x 105 cells were transferred to 12-well plates in suspension
and transduced with several lentivirus dilutions by spinoculation at 1,000 x g for 60 min
at 37 °C in medium containing 3% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 4 µg/ml polybrene. The
following day cells were trypsinized and moved to duplicate wells of 6-well plates. At
approximately 48 h post transduction one well of each duplicate was selected with 2

were counted to determine approximate MOI and we proceeded to expand cells that
were transduced at MOI < 0.3 to ensure that most cells in the population contained a
single integrant.
Generation and Validation of CRISPR KO clones
Mammalian cells. Small guide RNAs (sgRNA) for CRISPR editing were designed using
crispor.tefor.net (Haeussler et al., 2016) and cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid
CRISPR KO clones were generated by transfection with the relevant guides, selected
with 2 µg/ml puromycin for four days prior to single-cell seeding into 96-well plates in the
absence of puromycin at a dilution of 0.7 cells/well to obtain single-cell clonal
populations. Clones were expanded and screened for protein knockout by western blot
analysis or sequencing analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and used as a template for amplification of an
approximately 500-1,000 bp region flanking the PAM site. Discrete bands were gelextracted and gene disruption was confirmed by submitting samples to the CCIB DNA
Core Facility, Massachusetts General Hospital (Cambridge, MA, USA) for high
throughput amplicon sequencing.

FSS13025, generously provided by Pei-Yong Shi) were generated from infectious
clones as described below. Experiments with YFV (strain: Asibi), WNV-GFP, CHIKVGFP and SARS-CoV-2 were carried out in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment in
compliance with institutional and federal guidelines. The tick-borne viruses POWV
(strain: Byers, VSPB 812027), TBEV (strain: Hypr, VSPB 812222 and Sofjin, VSPB
812223), OHFV (strain: Bogoluvovska, VSPB 812005), KFDV (strain: P9605, VSPB

and experiments were carried out in BSL4 containment in compliance with institutional
and federal guidelines (Flint et al., 2014; Zaki, 1997).

Generation of recombinant YFV and ZIKV

Recombinant viruses for the Cambodian ZIKV (strain: FSS13025), the YFV vaccine
strain 17D and wildtype Asibi strain, as well as the YF chimeric 17D and Asibi viruses
were generated using plasmids encoding the infectious clones. To generate mutant and
chimeric viruses, overlapping oligos were created to either introduce point mutations or
to allow the amplification of specific coding sequences. PCR reactions were run under
standard conditions using KOD Hot Start Master Mix (Sigma-Aldrich: 71842). After
subsequent ligation with T4 ligase (NEB: M0202), the plasmid DNA was amplified in
competent DH5-ɑ E.coli cells. All plasmids encoding WT and mutant/chimeric viruses
were sequenced for the absence of unwanted mutations within the viral coding region.
For in vitro transcription, 2 µg linearized plasmid DNA was used in a 30 µl reaction with
the mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen: AM1340). RNA integrity
was examined on a 1% agarose gel. Huh-7.5 cells were subsequently electroporated

with 4 µg of YFV RNA mixed into 6 x 106 cells, while C6/36 cells were used for
electroporating ZIKV RNA under similar conditions. Electroporated cells were incubated
for 48-72 h before collecting and titrating supernatants by standard plaque assay in
Huh-7.5 cells.

All virus infections and quantification were performed using the doses and timepoints
reported in the figure legends for quantification by flow cytometry or microscopy. For
infections, cells were seeded at a density of 1 x 10 4 cells/well into black, glass-bottom
96-well plates (PerkinElmer: 6055302) and at 2.5 x 10 4 - 5 x 104 cells/well into regular
tissue culture 24-well plates. The next day, cells were washed 1x with Opti-MEM
(Gibco) and adsorbed with virus inoculum (50 µl for 96-well and 200 µl for 24-well
plates) prepared in Opti-MEM at 37 °C. After 1-2 h inoculum was removed, cells were
washed with Opti-MEM, fresh media was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C. At
the final time point dependent on viral replication kinetics, cells in 24-well plates were
lifted with Accumax cell dissociation medium (Sigma: A7089) and fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Cells infected with GFP/RFP reporter viruses were pelleted at
930 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
containing 3% FBS and stored at 4°C until analysis using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). FlowJo software v10 (Treestar) was used to obtain the percentage of
GFP/RFP-expressing cells, which were graphed using Prism8 (Graphpad).
For non-fluorescent reporter viruses, cells were washed 1x in PBS (+ 2% FBS),
permeabilized in 1x BD perm (BD Biosciences: 554723) for 1 h at RT followed by
overnight incubation with primary antibody. Cells were then washed three times with BD

perm, incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at RT, washed an additional three
times with BD perm, and once with PBS (+ 2% FBS) before being transferred to FACS
tubes for flow-cytometry analysis similar as for aforementioned reporter viruses.
Cells infected in 96-well plates were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT, washed in PBS with
0.01% Tween20 (PBS-T) and incubated with primary antibody (pan-flavivirus HMAF)
overnight. The secondary antibody was used at RT for 1 h together with NucBlue
(ThermoFisher) to stain for nuclei. Plates were subsequently read using the Perkin
Elmer Operetta confocal high content imager with a 10x objective. Images were
analyzed with a cell segmentation workflow using Harmony software v4.1 Perkin Elmer,
Waltham, MA.

Immunofluorescence
Unless otherwise described, cells were fixed in 2% PFA prepared in PBS at RT for 10
min. Cells were then directly stained for intracellular lipid droplets or were processed for
antigen staining by blocking with PBTG (PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% Triton-X100) at RT for 1-2 h. Cells were then
incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBTG (concentrations above) at 4 °C
overnight. Following four washes with PBS-T, cells were stained with AlexaFluorconjugated secondary antibodies in PBTG at RT for 1 h.

Following one wash with

PBS-T, cells were incubated with Hoechst nuclear stain diluted in PBS at RT for 15
min, followed by three additional washes with PBS-T and a final wash with PBS. Images

Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 0.5% SDC, 1% NP-40 with addition of cOmplete
Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet [Roche]) and incubated on ice for 30 min with
frequent vortexing and then clarified at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein
concentration was determined by bicinchoninic (BCA) protein assay (ThermoFisher
Scientific) and samples were resolved on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and 4-20%
Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membrane (EMD Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS-T and
incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight in 5% milk PBST. Membranes were
washed 3x with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies. For chemiluminescent
readout, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and

Figure 5. TMEM41B colocalizes with flavivirus NS4A and NS4B proteins. (A) TMEM41B KO HAP1
cells expressing RFP-TMEM41B visualized in uninfected cells (mock) and YFV- and ZIKV-infected cells for
24 h at MOI = 1 and 2.5 PFU/cell, respectively). Anti-NS4A (ZIKV) and anti-NS4B antibodies detect viral
antigens. Yellow-orange color in the merged column shows the colocalization of TMEM41B with viral
antigens. DAPI stains cell nuclei. (B) Western blot shows that an anti-RFP antibody which recognizes RFPTMEM41B (but not an IgG antibody control) co-immunoprecipitates ZIKV NS4A in HAP1 cells (MOI = 2.5
PFU/cell for 24 h). (C) Same as (B) but with YFV infection (MOI = 1 PFU/cell for 24 h) and visualized with
an antibody that detects YFV NS4B. WCL = whole cell lysate. Of note, the heavy chain of the capture
antibodies is detected by the secondary antibody protein A-HRP as indicated ~ 52 kDa. See also Figure

Figure 6. NS4A and NS4B mutations bypass TMEM41B deficiency. (A) Graphical schematic of virus
adaptation experiment. Top, WT Aag2 and two TMEM41B KO clones were infected with ZIKV (MOI = 0.5
PFU/cell) in triplicate. Cells were passaged every 2-3 days for 15 passages after which supernatants were
collected and viral RNA was reverse transcribed and sequenced with next generation sequencing (NGS).

Bottom, A549 WT cells together with two TMEM41B KO clones, and HAP1 WT cells together with one
TMEM41B KO clone, were infected with ZIKV (MOI = 5 PFU/cell) in triplicate. Supernatants were diluted
1:2 and used to inoculate naïve cells every 3-4 days for 20 passages after which supernatants were
collected and viral RNA was reverse transcribed and sequenced with next generation sequencing (NGS).
(B) Summary of ZIKV adaptive mutations. Top, graphical representation of the ZIKV genome with mature
(proteolytically processed) viral proteins shown as arrows and nucleotide positions listed below. NS4A and
NS4B, are labeled and colored in light blue. Bottom, table of the amino acids where missense mutations
were identified after passaging. Only mutations that were present in at least three independent passages
(irrespective of cell type) and that did not appear in virus populations passaged in WT cells are shown.
Boxes show the number of replicates a given mutation was identified over the total number of replicates
analyzed for that cell type. Of note, out of six initial replicates for the A549 TMEM41B KO clones, only five
were able to be carried over the course of 20 passages. (C) Missense mutations I42T and F91Y were
independently engineered in a ZIKV infectious clone and used to generate virus stocks to infect WT (left)
or TMEM41B KO (right) Aag2 cells (MOI = 0.001 PFU/cell for 72 h). The virus stocks used for infection are
listed below the bars. (D) Same experiment as in (C) in WT and TMEM41B KO A549 cells (MOI = 0.05
PFU/cell for 48 h). (E-F) YFV 17D and Asibi chimeric viruses were generated and used to infect WT and
TMEM41B KO A549 cells. (E) 17D backbone with Asibi NS4A and NS4B proteins (MOI = 0.1 PFU/cell for
48 h). (F) Asibi backbone with 17D NS4A and NS4B proteins (MOI = 0.1 PFU/cell for 48 h). Cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry and plotted as a percentage of viral antigen positive cells. Error bars depict SD
for three replicates.

indicated by labels on the right. β-actin is shown as loading control. The anti-ATG5 antibody also recognizes
the ATG5/ATG12 conjugate with a higher molecular weight band. Also shown is the differently lipidated
LC3 protein (LC3 I/II), indicative of functional autophagy. (M) ATG7 KO HAP1 clones untreated (left),
treated with Torin 1 (inducer of autophagy) and chloroquine (CQ – block of autophagosome/lysosome
fusion and LC3 II turnover) (middle), and serum-starved (induction of autophagy) in Earle’s balanced salt
solution (EBSS and treated with CQ) (right) (treatment for 6 h). β-actin is shown as loading control.
Functional autophagy and autophagy induction is observed by the appearance of LC3 II, which is absent
at baseline in ATG5 and ATG7 KO clones and also upon induction in ATG7 KO clones.

96 h; WNV-GFP, MOI = 10 PFU/cell for 72 h. (K-L) Same as H-J but without TMEM41B reconstitution. YFV
17D, MOI = 10 PFU/cell for 72 h; YFV Asibi, MOI = 0.5 PFU/cell for 72 h; CHIKV, MOI = 0.1 PFU/cell for
72 h (Aag2) and 0.05 PFU/cell for 48 h (C6/36). (M) Western blot to detect TMEM41B and VMP1 in lysates
from indicated cell lines. β-actin is included as a loading control. Panels A, C and D-G, individual dots are
the average of n=3 replicates from independent cell clones. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and
plotted as a percentage of viral antigen positive cells or GFP/RFP positive cells for reporter viruses
expressing a fluorescent protein. Individual dot are independent cell clones. Panels A-L, error bars depict
SD for three replicates or the indicated number of clones.

Figure S5. Related to Figure 5. (A) Shown are western blots from Figure 5 from ZIKV-infected lysates.
Left panel was probed with β-actin to show that similar amounts of whole cell lysate were used as input.
Right panel was probed with anti-RFP to show that similar amounts of RFP-TMEM41B were
immunoprecipitated from mock and infected lysates but not when using an IgG control antibody. (B) Same
as (A) with YFV-infected cells. Of note, the β-actin signal detected in the anti-RFP IgG immunopreciptated
fraction is likely an unspecific interaction with the RFP or with TMEM41B as it has been shown that the
cytoskeleton (e.g., actins) can interact with organelles (e.g., ER).
