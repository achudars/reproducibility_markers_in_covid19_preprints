Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an adverse effect on the progression of multiple
cancers, including prostate cancer, due to the ensuing cytokine storm and associated oncogenic
signaling. Epidemiological data showing increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in men
suggests a potential role for androgen in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present evidence for
the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2
by androgen in mouse tissues and human prostate and lung cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate
the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a
TMPRSS2 substrate. In an overexpression model, and the prostate and lung cells, Camostat – a
TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without
disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of
TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, required for viral fusion to the host cell.
Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens such as enzalutamide/AR-PROTAC, or
Camostat treatment attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry in lung and prostate cells.
Together, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of the TMPRSS2
inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy and androgen receptor antagonists alone or in
combination with anti-viral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent inflammation driven
COVID-19 progression.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is global health crisis (Morens and
Fauci, 2020; Wang et al., 2020). As of September 2020, more than 35 million cases of COVID-19
and one million deaths have been recorded (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). Epidemiological data
have shown that males are disproportionally affected, being slightly more likely to be infected than
females and accounting for most severely ill cases and higher fatality. This is compounded by
older age and comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, hypertension and
cancer (Williamson et al., 2020). This sex disparity with respect to increased morbidity and
mortality in men suggests a potential role for the male hormone androgen in SARS-CoV-2
infection and host response (Stopsack et al., 2020; Wadman, 2020). The host immune response to
SARS-CoV-2 potentiates a hyper-inflammatory cytokine storm involving the upregulation of
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α), interleukin 1β (IL-1 β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP1α), which is
associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality(Mehta et al., 2020; Moore and June, 2020;
Vabret et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Tumor cell-intrinsic and microenvironment associated
immune cell response to inflammation promote the development and progression of several types
of solid cancer, including prostate cancer (de Bono et al., 2020). Therefore, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that the inflammatory signaling accompanying severe COVID-19 disease could cause
cancer progression. Therefore, early intervention of COVID-19 management should be considered
in cancer patients who are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their
immunosuppressive state.
SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell is mediated by trimers of the transmembrane spike (S)
glycoprotein. The S trimer binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
on the surface of target cells and mediates subsequent viral uptake and fusion dependent on
processing by host proteases (Hoffmann et al., 2020c).

Several host proteases, including

TMPRSS2, cathepsin B and L, and furin have been suggested to promote the entry of SARS-CoV2; how they process the Spike protein remains to be determined (Coutard et al., 2020; Shang et al.,

2020; Walls et al., 2020). In relevant target cells, the cleavage of S by TMPRSS2 activates the
protein for membrane fusion via extensive, irreversible conformational changes (Millet and
Whittaker, 2015; Walls et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2017). As a result, SARS-CoV-2 entry into
susceptible cells is a complex process that requires the concerted action of ACE2 receptor-binding
and TMPRSS2 proteolytic processing of the S protein to promote virus-cell fusion. Despite their
well-documented role in SARS-CoV-2 entry, the nature of endogenous ACE2 and TMRPSS2
interactions in host cells is lacking.
TMRPSS2 is a widely studied androgen-regulated gene associated with prostate cancer (Afar et
al., 2001). It contributes to prostate cancer pathogenesis by way of aberrantly driving oncogenic
transcription. More than half of all prostate cancers in men of European ancestry harbor a gene
fusion that juxtaposes the androgen receptor (AR) regulatory promoter/enhancer elements of
Tmprss2 in front of the ETS family transcription factors, most commonly Erg(Tomlins et al.,
2005). Although ERG is not normally regulated by androgen, this somatic gene rearrangement
results in oncogenic ERG expression under androgen receptor signaling. Further, TMRPSS2 is
known to promote metastatic spread of prostate cancer through HGF activation (Lucas et al.,
2014). ACE2 is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease and is expressed at high levels in the heart, testis,
and kidney and at lower levels in various tissue (Gheblawi et al., 2020). Therefore, identifying
molecular mechanisms governing the expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 could potentially
explain the observed disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated morbidity and mortality in
men.
In this study, we provide evidence for the AR-mediated transcriptional regulation of TMPRSS2
and ACE2 in mice and human prostate and lung cells. Specifically, androgen deprivation in mice
by castration, or anti-androgen treatment in vitro led to a reduction in TMPRSS2 and ACE2
transcript and protein levels. Furthermore, TMPRSS2 and ACE2 were found to interact in cis in
prostate and lung cells, and the inhibition of TMPRSS2 protease activity by Camostat blocked
Spike priming. Finally, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens, or Camostat treatment attenuated
the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype entry in lung and prostate cells, suggesting that these drug
combinations could be effective in attenuating COVID-19 disease progression in men with or
without prostate cancer.

Results
Systemic androgen deprivation affects TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in mice
The poor clinical outcome of COVID-19 in men suggests a potential underlying androgen-related
cause. The role of male sex hormone androgen in regulating the SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor
ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2 has been speculated (La Vignera et al., 2020; Stopsack et al.,
2020; Wadman, 2020). To evaluate the effect of androgen deprivation on TMPRSS2 and ACE2
expression in major tissues that are the primary sites for SARS-CoV-2 infection(Ziegler et al.,
2020), we performed surgical castration in adult male mice (n=3). One week post-castration, we
harvested the lung, small intestine, heart and kidney for qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and
immunohistochemistry analysis. Seminal vesicles and prostate were used as positive controls for
systemic androgen deprivation. Tissues from the corresponding mock castrated male (n=3) and
female (n=3) served as controls (Fig.1A). First, we determined the expression of Tmprss2, Ace2
and Ar in the control tissues. Each was expressed at varying degrees, with Ar and Tmprss2 being
the highest in seminal vesicles, and ACE2 in the small intestine (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
Interestingly, a survey of adult human male tissue mRNA expression via bulk RNA-seq from the
GTEx consortium(Consortium et al., 2017) demonstrated a similar expression pattern in prostate
and small intestine for AR, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1B), suggesting a potentially
identical mechanism of regulation in man and mice. Next, as expected, the Tmprss2 expression
was highly androgen-responsive in the seminal vesicles of the castrated males compared to the
control males. (Fig. 1B). Except for the small intestine and the lung which showed a slight
downward trend, levels of Tmprss2 in the heart (with very low basal expression), and the kidney
did not display any change upon castration. However, Ace2 expression displayed a significant
downregulation in the lung and the small intestine, which was similar to the levels found in female
mice, and upregulation in the kidney tissues in the castrated male compared to controls.
Remarkably, Ace2 expression was also reduced in the hormone-sensitive seminal vesicles upon
castration (Fig. 1B), suggesting a potential role for androgen in regulating Ace2 expression in these
tissues. In concordance with the transcripts, the immunoblot analysis using total protein extracts
from tissues demonstrated a reduced TMRPSS2 and ACE2 protein levels in the lung and the small
intestine. The reduction in protein levels was much more dramatic than the transcript levels. In
contrast, the kidney tissue displayed an increase in the ACE2 protein, but not TMPRSS2,
corroborating the transcript data (Fig. 1C). Next, we performed immunohistochemistry to identify

the specific cell types in these tissues that display altered expression for TMPRSS2 and ACE2
proteins upon androgen deprivation. In these experiments, DU145 and VCaP prostate cancer
xenograft tissues served as a negative control for AR, TMPRSS2, and ACE2 respectively, which
showed a clear lack of staining (Supplementary Fig. S1C). As expected, the hormone-responsive
prostate luminal epithelial cells showed reduced staining for AR and TMPRSS2 in response to
castration (Fig. 1D). We also observed a small minority population of epithelial cells <5% staining
for ACE2 on the apical surface of the prostate epithelium, which was absent in the castrated group.
The identical minimal co-expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was also identified in human
prostate tissues, where club cells that constitute a mere 0.07% of total prostate epithelial cells and
resemble club cells in the lung were double-positive(Henry et al., 2018; Montoro et al., 2018; Song
et al., 2020). We observed no morphological changes in response to castration in lung, small
intestine and kidney tissue through H&E staining. Similar to transcripts, the AR, ACE2, and
TMPRSS2 proteins were detected in all of the tested tissue types at varying degrees (Fig. 1E). A
strong staining for TMPRSS2 was detected exclusively in the lung respiratory bronchiole
epithelium, with minimal staining of type II alveolar cells, which is consistent with the expression
pattern observed in human tissue (Stopsack et al., 2020). The staining intensity, especially in type
II alveolar cells, was reduced in the castrated group. The ACE2 staining could be observed in the
lung parenchyma, both type I and type II alveolar cells and the bronchiole epithelium apical surface
of the castrated males showed relatively lower expression. Next, the small intestine mucosa from
the control group showed positive cytoplasmic and nuclear AR staining, which were reduced in
the castrated group. TMPRSS2 displayed high staining in the crypt and lower portion of the villi
with the exception in the goblet cells, and the staining gradually diminished on the top of the villi.
ACE2 was mainly present on the apical surface of the enterocytes on the top part of the villi. These
expression patterns mirror data from human small intestinal tissue, especially ileum and jejunum
(Hamming et al., 2004; Ziegler et al., 2020). The abundance of double-positive cells was largely
reduced in the castrated male tissue due to the reduction in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels.
Concerning the kidney, the AR staining was detected in the tubular cells, which was reduced upon
castration. TMPRSS2 showed positivity mainly in the proximal tubules compared to other cells,
which was reduced in the castrated group (Muus et al., 2020). Finally, a homogenous ACE2
expression was detected across kidney tissue on the apical surface of the tubular cells. In line with
the kidney’s role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the ACE2 intensity was strongly

elevated in the castrated males responding to reduced blood pressure brought out by androgen
deprivation (Dubey et al., 2002). Together, these analyses clearly demonstrate that the androgen
deprivation has an effect on the expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2, particularly in the lung, small
intestine, and kidney. Though there was a discrepancy concerning transcript and protein levels of
TMPRSS2 in the tested tissues -particularly in the kidney, post-transcriptional regulation of
TMPRSS2 by androgen regulated microRNA could not be ruled out (Nersisyan et al., 2020).

AR regulates TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human prostate and lung cells
The observation that systemic androgen deprivation affects the expression of TMPRSS2 and
ACE2 in hormone-sensitive tissues such as prostate and seminal vesicles, but also in major organs
such as the lungs, small intestine, and kidney led us to investigate the direct role of AR in the
transcriptional regulation of these two critical genes beyond the prostate. Although the upstream
enhancer of Tmprss2 is a well-known target for AR (Asangani et al., 2014), we sought to identify
whether regulatory elements of Ace2 are also occupied by AR. We analyzed publicly available AR
ChIP-seq data for AR-binding sites within 50 kb of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the
Tmprss2 and Ace2 genes in mouse prostate, comparing castration and castration followed by
testosterone injection for 3 days (Pihlajamaa et al., 2014). As expected, multiple AR peaks were
observed in the upstream of the Tmprss22 TSS in the testosterone-treated prostate, which was also
present in DHT (dihydrotestosterone) treated VCaP and LNCaP human prostate cell lines (Fig.
2a). Interestingly, the upstream region of ACE2 also showed AR binding in mouse as well as in
human prostate cells (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig.2). Motif analysis of the AR occupied
regions revealed the presence of androgen response elements (ARE), as well as binding sites for
other steroid receptors such as GR (Glucocorticoid Receptor) and PR (Progesterone Receptor),
and pioneering factor such as FOXA1 (Supplementary Fig.2), suggesting potential regulation of
ACE2 by other steroid hormones. Next, we wanted to investigate whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2
expression in human cells responds to androgen deprivation or anti-androgen treatment. We
cultured LNCaP cells in steroid-deprived conditions for 2, 4, and 6 days and assessed the
expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 compared to cells grown in steroid-proficient condition. As
one of the most androgen-responsive gene, TMPRSS2 transcript and protein levels showed
downregulation in the steroid-deprived cells compared to their steroid-proficient controls (Fig.
2B). This was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the levels of phosphoSer81-AR (pAR),

an active chromatin-bound form of AR (Rasool et al., 2019). More importantly, the ACE2
transcript and the protein levels were also downregulated in the steroid-deprived cells. Treatment
with the second-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide or AR degrader ARD-69(Han et al., 2019)
led to a time-dependent reduction in the TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression that was accompanied
by reduced pAR levels in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2C). Since lung is one of the primary site of SARSCoV-2 infection causing severe disease, we tested whether lung cells respond to androgendeprivation and anti-androgen treatment with respect to the expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2.
First, we screened a panel of lung cancer cell lines and found H460 cells positive for AR,
TMPRSS2 and ACE2 (Fig. 2D). Similar to that observed in LNCaP cells, H460 displayed a
marked downregulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 accompanied by reduced pAR levels upon
androgen-deprivation, or AR targeted therapy (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, androgen induced AR
dependent upregulation of TMPRSS2 has been demonstrated in other lung cancer cell lines
(Mikkonen et al., 2010). These data clearly demonstrate a potential role of AR in regulating SARSCoV-2 receptor and co-receptor in prostate and lung cells.

TMPRSS2 interacts with ACE2 in prostate and lung cells
Having identified the androgen dependency of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expressions in vivo in mice
and in vitro in human cell lines, we turned our attention to their function concerning SARS-CoV2 Spike (SARS-2-S) priming. Though TMPRSS2 is implicated in priming of SARS-2-S protein
(Hoffmann et al., 2020c), it is unclear whether this occurs in association with ACE2. Further,
TMPRSS2-mediated enhancement of SARS virus entry has been shown to accompany ACE2
cleavage (Shulla et al., 2011). Therefore, we studied whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 physically
associate in an endogenous setting and examined the effect of TMPRSS2 protease inhibition on
their interaction and cleavage of ACE2. TMPRSS2 is composed of a cytoplasmic region (aa 1-84),
a transmembrane region (aa 85-105), and an extracellular region (aa 106-492). The latter is
composed of three domains: the LDLRA (LDL receptor class A) domain (residues 112-149) – that
forms a binding site for calcium, the SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain (aa 149242) - involved in the binding to other cell surface or extracellular proteins, and the Peptidase S1
domain (aa 256-489), which contains the protease active site: residues H296, D345, and S441 (Fig.
3a). An auto-cleavage site at aa 255-256 has been shown to allow shedding of the extracellular
region of TMPRSS2 (Afar et al., 2001). The ACE2 protein is 805 aa long and is composed of a

short cytoplasmic region, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular N-terminal region that
contain zinc metallopeptidase domain (Fig. 3A). TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of ACE2 at its Nterminus (residues 697 to 716) was shown to be required for ACE2 to interact with SARS-S protein
in 293T overexpression system (Heurich et al., 2014; Shulla et al., 2011). Our experiments show
that overexpression of TMPRSS2 in HEK293-T cells that stably express ACE2 led to ACE2
cleavage, resulting in reduced levels of the ∼120 kDa full-length form and increased levels of a
∼20 kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig. 3B), as previously documented (Shulla et al., 2011).
Importantly, the treatment of cells with Camostat – a TMPRSS2 serine protease inhibitor (Kawase
et al., 2012) (Fig. 3C), entirely blocked ACE2 cleavage, suggesting ACE2 as a bona fide substrate
of TMPRSS2(Shulla et al., 2011). Intriguingly, Camostat treatment did not result in any change in
ACE2 full-length levels in LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). This observation led us to address
the existence of TMPRSS2-ACE2 complex in the endogenous setting. Towards that, we
determined the physical interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 protein using N- and Cterminal specific antibodies (Fig. 3A). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments showed an
endogenous association between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in LNCaP prostate cells (Fig. 3D).
Likewise, Calu-3 lung cells demonstrated a physical interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2
(Fig. 3E). Along with the full-length 50 kDa TMPRSS2, a smaller approximately 38 kDa variant
was found to interact with ACE2 prominently in both the cell lines. Notably, the treatment of cells
with Camostat did not reduce the amount of ACE2 being pulled down by TMPRSS2 and viceversa, suggesting the endogenous TMPRSS2-ACE2 complex to be stable and is not dependent on
proteolytic cleavage. These data demonstrate for the first time an endogenous association between
TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in prostate and lung cells.

TMPRSS2 inhibition blocks S priming without affecting its interaction with ACE2
Next, we addressed the role of TMPRSS2 on priming of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (SARS-2-S) – a
heavily glycosylated transmembrane protein (Cai et al., 2020; Ke et al., 2020) (Fig. 4A). The
unprocessed Spike S0 protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome is 1,273 amino acid long. It
is incorporated into the viral membrane and facilitates viral entry into target cells. Similar to SARS
CoV and MERS CoV Spike proteins, SARS-CoV-2 Spike consists of a proprotein convertase
(PPC) motif at the S1/S2 boundary cleaved by furin protease and TMPRSS2 into two fragments –
the receptor-binding fragment S1 and the membrane fusion fragment S2(Hoffmann et al., 2020b;

Hoffmann et al., 2020c; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Shang et al., 2020; Shulla et al., 2011; Zhou
et al., 2015). Though the role of TMPRSS2 in SARS-2-S priming has been suggested (Hoffmann
et al., 2020c), direct evidence demonstrating the cleaving of SARS-2-S by endogenous TMPRSS2
is lacking. Therefore, we performed experiments to specifically address the role of ectopically
expressed or endogenous TMPRSS2 in SARS-2-S activation. Transfection of codon optimized
plasmid encoding SARS-2-S protein and 2xStrep.tag (Gordon et al., 2020) in HEK293-T showed
a distinct ∼180 kDa, and a ∼280 kDa band which is likely the differentially glycosylated S0
protein. The two other bands at ∼120 kDa and a ∼60 kDa could be the non-glycosylated fragments
(Fig. 4B). The S1 fragment could not detected in the immunoblots as the streptavidin-tag is located
at the C-terminal end of the constructs. The co-transfection with TMPRSS2 plasmid led to
cleavage of S0 into distinct bands corresponding to S2, and S2’ (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the ∼280
kDa band and ∼120 kDa was fully processed by TMPRSS2, suggesting the S1/S2 site on
glycosylated and non-glycosylated S0 protein could be equally targeted by TMPRSS2 for
cleavage. The smaller fragments observed is most likely the TMPRSS2 cleaved S2 and S2’ from
the non-glycosylated S0. To further demonstrate the action of TMPRSS2 on S activation, we
performed spinoculation with pseudotype virus that contain replication deficient human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) particles bearing SARS-2-S proteins in TMPRSS2 negative
HEK293-T ACE2 cells. First, the Mass spectrometry-based sequencing of pseudotype
incorporated SARS-2-S identified the prominent ∼180 kDa and ∼120 kDa fragments as full-length
S0 proteins, suggesting the presence of uncleaved Spike on the pseudotype (Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Fig. 4). In agreement with a recent study that demonstrated the existence of S
mostly in the closed uncleaved pre-fusion confirmation on the authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Turonova
et al., 2020), the purified pseudotype SARS-2-S virus spinoculation followed by immunoblotting
displayed both glycosylated ∼180 kDa and non-glycosylated ∼120 kDa full-length S0 protein
(Fig. 4D). Next, the cells transfected with TMPPSS2 plasmid showed clear processing of
pseudotype full-length S0 into S2, and S2’. As expected, pretreatment with Camostat prevented
the TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of pseudotype S0. Since we had observed proteolytic cleavage
of ACE2 by TMPRSS2 in the overexpression model (Fig. 3B), we sought to observe whether the
TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of SARS-2-S is taking place in the presence of ACE2. Toward this,
we performed immunoprecipitation of TMPRSS2 on pseudotype SARS-2-S spinoculation in the
presence or absence of Camostat. Increased pulldown of uncleaved full-length S0 was observed in

the Camostat treated cells compared to control, due to the inhibition of TMPRSS2 protease activity
and resulting lack of S priming (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, the amount of ACE2 pulled down by
TMPRSS2 was not affected by Camostat, suggesting the SARS-2-S cleavage by TMPRSS2 is
mediated in the presence of ACE2 in the complex. Noticeably, the cleaved S0 fragments were
completely absent in the TMPRSS2 pulldown, suggesting that once processed, the S2 and S2’
fragments are released from the TMPRSS2-ACE2 complex. Similar observations of pseudotype
SARS-2-S cleavage by endogenous TMPRSS2 in the presence of endogenous ACE2 were made
with LNCaP and Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4F and 4G). These data clearly demonstrate the crucial role
played by TMPRSS2 in SARS-CoV-2 viral fusion to the host cell by Spike protein priming (Fig.
4H).

Camostat alone or in combination with AR directed therapies reduces SARS-2-S
pseudovirus entry into prostate and lung cells
After identifying the role of androgen in regulating TMRPSS2 and ACE2 expression, and
TMPRSS2 mediated SARS-2-S priming, we asked whether therapeutic intervention targeting AR
and TMPRSS2 protease function could affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in prostate and lung cells.
Replication-defective virus particles bearing SARS-2-S proteins faithfully reflect critical aspects
of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020c). Therefore, we employed HIV
pseudotypes bearing SARS-2-S and nano-luciferase reporter to test the efficacy of Camostat and
AR directed therapies in blocking cell entry (Fig. 5A). We first asked whether androgen
deprivation could affect pseudotype virus entry by reducing TMRPSS2 and ACE2 (Fig.2). LNCaP
cells grown in the androgen proficient condition were readily susceptible to the entry driven by
SARS-2-S (Fig. 5B). However, cells grown under steroid-deprived condition (CSS- charcoal
stripped serum) demonstrated a significant reduction in the entry of pseudotype virus.
Interestingly, Camostat treatment efficiently blocked the SARS-2-S mediated entry only in the
androgen proficient condition, suggesting the presence of TMPRSS2 as a requirement for its
potency. Next, we treated LNCaP cells grown in normal growth condition with anti-androgen
enzalutamide, AR degrader ARD-69, or Camostat and observed a significant reduction in SARS2-S driven entry compared to the DMSO control. Notably, the combination of Camostat with
enzalutamide or ARD-69 was more efficacious in blocking the entry than single drug (Fig. 5C).
Since lungs are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, we tested whether androgen deprivation,

enzalutamide, ARD-69 and Camostat could block SARS-2-S mediated entry in AR positive H460
cells. Similar to LNCaP cells, pseudovirus entry was significantly reduced in the H460 cells grown
in the steroid-deprived condition, enzalutamide, and ARD-69 alone or in combination with
Camostat compared to the control (Fig. 5D and 5E). As expected, compared to Camostat, the
enzalutamide or AR degrader treatment in AR-negative Calu-3 cells did not block the SARS-2-S
mediated entry (Fig. 5F). Importantly, unlike SARS-2-S, HIV pseudotypes bearing VSV-G did
not display any significant difference in cell entry under these condition in all three tested cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 5). These results indicate that the treatment of AR-positive prostate and lung
cells with AR directed therapies in combination with TMPRSS2 inhibitor efficiently block SARS2-S mediated viral entry.
Discussion
Early intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection could prevent cytokine storm mediated progression
to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients (Mehta et al., 2020). Although
the source of the cytokine storm that causes multi-organ dysfunction is not yet clear, uncontrolled
viral replication may contribute to COVID-19 severity and death. The present study provides
evidence that the expression of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and co-receptor TMPRSS2
is regulated in part by the male sex hormone androgen. Further, our data provide evidence that the
cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudovirus can be blocked by androgen deprivation, antiandrogens, or clinically proven inhibitors of TMPRSS2. Although other studies have demonstrated
the role of TMRPSS2 in SARS-CoV-2 Spike priming(Hoffmann et al., 2020c), we provide the
first direct evidence for the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells,
and endogenous TMPRSS2 mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike, which could be blocked by
Camostat. This finding is consistent with work demonstrating the role of TMRPSS2 in activating
Spike glycoproteins of closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019;
Zhou et al., 2015). Our observation through immunoprecipitation experiments that TMPRSS2ACE2 exists in complex and potentially required for Spike cleavage has implications for
developing novel therapeutics targeting the TMPRSS2-ACE2 interface to block Spike activation.
Collectively, our results indicate that androgen regulated TMPRSS2 promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry
by two separate mechanisms: ACE2 interaction/cleavage, which might promote viral uptake; and
SARS-2-S cleavage, which activates the S protein for membrane fusion (Hoffmann et al., 2020a;

Hoffmann et al., 2020c). These results have important implications for our understanding of male
bias in COVID-19 severity and mortality, and provide a strong rationale for androgen deprivation
or anti-androgen therapy in men with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The evidence provided by our data and previous studies (Mikkonen et al., 2010) suggests androgen
receptor mediated regulation of TMPRSS2 expression in non-prostatic tissues, including lung,
may explain the increased susceptibility of men to COVID-19 severity and mortality. Additionally,
ACE2 expression has been associated with androgen levels in men, where a lower ACE2 level was
associated with older men as a consequence of lower androgen (Chen et al., 2020).
Mechanistically,

besides

androgen,

other

steroid

hormones

(estrogen,

progesterone,

glucocorticoids) may also enhance TMRPSS2 and ACE2 expression in multiple tissues through
binding of their respective nuclear receptors to responsive cis elements (ERE, PRE, GRE), which
are similar to the ARE present in the gene promoter/enhancer. In addition to the regulation of
TMRPSS2 and ACE2 expression, androgen could also increase the SARS-CoV-2 severity in men
by modulating the immune response. Androgen is known to increase circulating neutrophils,
increase secretion of IL-10, IL-2, IL-8 and TGF-𝛽 by immune cells, and decrease the antibody
response to viral infections(Klein and Flanagan, 2016). It is worth noting that severe cases of
COVID-19 exhibit increased neutrophils and IL-8(Barnes et al., 2020; Takahashi et al., 2020).
Except for dexamethasone, which reduces mortality (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation)
in ICU patients by reducing inflammation (Tomazini et al., 2020), and Remdesivir, which reduces
disease duration by inhibiting viral replication (Goldman et al., 2020), there are currently no drugs
for COVID-19. There is an urgent need for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for patients
with existing comorbidities such as cancer as they are at high risk for severe disease due to a weak
immune system. Due to an apparent male bias and assumed role of androgen in COVID-19,
multiple studies have advocated androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and anti-androgens – a
mainstay of prostate cancer treatment, as potential therapeutic options in COVID-19, which could
potentially provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or at least reduce viral amplification
(Bhowmick et al., 2020; Mjaess et al., 2020; Montopoli et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020; Stopsack et
al., 2020). Following these assumptions, various clinical trials testing ADT and anti-androgen have
begun: Degarelix (GnRH antagonist) NCT04397718, Dutasteride (ADT) NCT04446429,
Bicalutamide (first generation anti-androgen) NCT04374279, and Enzalutamide (second-

generation anti-androgen) NCT04475601. However, a direct link for androgen regulation of
TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in tissues, including the lung, was not established until now. Additionally,
Camostat mesilate – the TMPRSS2 inhibitor which is approved for pancreatitis in Japan (Ohshio
et al., 1989), is currently being investigated as a treatment for COVID-19 in several active clinical
trials in USA (NCT04353284, NCT04470544, NCT04374019), Israel (NCT04355052), and
Denmark (NCT04321096). Our data showing complete block of TMRPSS2 mediated Spike
activation by Camostat in multiple cell line models provide further credentials for these clinical
trials.
Growing evidence suggests cancer patients are susceptible to severe form of COVID-19 mainly
due to their immunosuppressive state and co-existing medical conditions (Dai et al., 2020; Lee et
al., 2020; Tang and Hu, 2020). In general, patients with metastatic cancers infected with SARSCoV-2 have had poorer outcomes including death, admission to the intensive care unit, requiring
mechanical ventilation, and severe symptoms (Dai et al., 2020). As the development of vaccines
and anti-viral drugs against the pandemic causing SARS-CoV-2 are proceeding rapidly, Camostat
mesilate along with androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2, as a means to inhibit SARSCoV-2 cell entry (Fig. 5G), and thus, the infection represents a potential strategy in treating
COVID-19 in these high-risk population.
