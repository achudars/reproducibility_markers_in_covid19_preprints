Abstract
2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused large-scale pandemic COVID-19
all over the world. It’s essential to find out which parts of the 2019-nCoV sequence are
recognized by human immune system for vaccine development. And for the prevention
of the potential outbreak of similar coronaviruses in the future, vaccines against
immunogenic epitopes shared by different human coronaviruses are essential. Here we
predict all the potential B/T-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV and
RaTG13-CoV based on the protein sequences. We found YFKYWDQTY in ORF1ab
protein, VYDPLQPEL and TVYDPLQPEL in spike (S) protein might be pancoronavirus targets for vaccine development. All the predicted results are stored in a
database COVIEdb (http://biopharm.zju.edu.cn/coviedb/).

Introduction
Two coronaviruses—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused two
large-scale pandemics in the past two decades [1,2]. Now, the third coronavirus caused
pandemic (COVID-19) is ongoing [3,4]. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, from patients with
pneumonia is the very coronavirus [5]. Analysis of the viral genome has revealed that
2019-nCoV is phylogenetically close to SARS-CoV [6], as was named SARS-CoV-2.
As of April 27, 2020, 2,980,053 people have been confirmed COVID-19, including
206,569 deaths (∼6.9% fatality rate) all over the world.
Because of the less cost-effective than treatment, and reduce morbidity and
mortality without long-lasting effects, vaccines are the most effective strategy for
preventing infectious diseases [7]. However, there is still no approved vaccines for
human coronaviruses (hCoV). There are several types of vaccines are under pre-clinical
testing or clinical trials including inactivated vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine,
recombinant vector vaccine, and nucleic acid vaccine. In general, modern vaccines,

such as recombinant subunit, peptide, and nucleic acid vaccines, are advantageous over
other types of vaccines because of higher safety and less side effect, by inducing the
immune system without introducing whole infectious viruses [8]. Nucleic acid vaccines
such as DNA vaccines and mRNA vaccines represent an innovative approach by direct
injection of plasmids or mRNAs encoding the antigens, accompanied with a wide range
of immune responses [9,10]. These advantages are applied with prophylactic vaccines
and therapeutic vaccines to treat infectious diseases and cancers. For the development
of modern vaccines, it is of critical importance to identify potential immune epitopes
of 2019-nCoV, as well as other infectious pathogens.
Considering the seriousness of the recent outbreaks of zoonotic coronaviruses,
therapeutic agents and vaccines for pan-coronaviruses should be developed to cope with
the hCoV outbreaks in the present and in the future. Here we predict all the potential
B/T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV to provide potential
targets for pan-coronaviruses vaccine development. The prediction are based on their
proteins sequences. RaTG13-CoV is added because of its high homology with 2019nCoV (96% whole genome identity [11]). All the predicted results are stored in a
database named COVIEdb (http://biopharm.zju.edu.cn/coviedb/).

Database content and usage
Data Source
The protein sequences of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV, and RaTG13-CoV
are downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The genome sequences
of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 encode 13, 10, 11 and 10 proteins,
respectively. Among these protein sequences, ORF1ab is not divided. And the N protein
of SARS-CoV is divided into ORF9a and ORF9b.
The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles used for T-cell epitopes prediction
are derived from Zhou et.al. which analyzed the HLA distribution of 20,635 individuals
of Han Chinese ancestry [12]. The top 20 HLA I alleles of A, B, C subtypes and HLA
II alleles with frequency more than 5% are the final HLA datasets (Table S1).
B-cell epitopes prediction

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.096164; this version posted May 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is
made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

The B-cell epitopes were predicted by the seven tools embedded in the Immune
Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) [13]. More specifically, BepiPred-1.0
[14], BepiPred-2.0 [15], Chou and Fasman beta turn prediction [16], Emini surface
accessibility scale [17], Karplus and Schulz flexibility scale [18], Kolaskar and
Tongaonkar antigenicity scale [19] and Parker hydrophilicity prediction [20] are used
for predicting amino acid sites belonging to B-cell epitopes. The parameters are all set
as default. The sites confirmed by at least five tools would be labeled in red. The
thresholds of each tool are in Table S2a. In this study, only amino acids that be
confirmed by at least five tools are considered as B-cell epitopes.
T-cell epitopes prediction
The T-cell epitopes prediction were divided into two parts. One of them are
presented by HLA I allele and would induce the activation of CD8+ T cells. This type
of T-cell epitopes were predicted by NetMHCpan 4.0 [21], MHCflurry [22] and
DeepHLApan [23]. Another type of T-cell epitopes presented by HLA II alleles were
predicted by MixMHC2pred [24] and NetMHCIIpan [25], which would induce the
activation of CD4+ T cells. The thresholds to defined potential T-cell epitopes of each
tool are listed in Table S2b.
In the prediction of T-cell epitopes presented by HLA I alleles, all peptides with
length range from 8 to 11 were selected and combined with previous HLA I alleles to
create HLA-peptide pairs. It’s similar to predict that presented by HLA II alleles, with
the difference that peptide length range from 15 to 28. Only HLA-peptide pairs satisfied
with all thresholds of used tools would be potential T-cell epitopes in this study.
Web interface
The web interface of COVIEdb is made up of five parts, “Home”, “B-epitope”, “Tepitope”, “Peptide”, and “Help”.
A statistical table about the predicted B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes are
embedded in the “Home” page. The table shows the coronavirus, gene, protein length,
the number of amino acids that predicted to be potential B-cell epitopes and T-cell
epitopes (Table 1). The number of the predicted epitopes are different but similar among
four coronaviruses. The N protein of SARS-CoV is represented as ORF9a and ORF9b

as previous state. We can find that many peptides have the potential to be B-cell
epitopes or T-cell epitopes, but the prefer targets should be shared by different
coronaviruses and we will discuss in the next section.
The predicted results of B-cell epitopes could be searched in “B-epitope” page.
With the virus and gene selected, the corresponding predicted B-cell epitopes would
appear (Figure 1a is the example result when the selected coronavirus and protein are
2019-nCoV and S, respectively). The first to fourth columns are the basic information
of the amino acids in coronavirus. The following seven columns are the results that
different tools predicted if it’s the amino acid in B-cell epitopes. Once click the blue
number, the corresponding score and threshold would show (Figure 1b). The last
column is the number of tools that the amino acid is predicted as potential B-cell
epitopes. On click the number, the corresponding tools would show (Figure 1c).
The predicted results of T-cell epitopes could be searched in “T-epitope” page.
Similar with that in “B-epitope” page, coronavirus and protein are necessary. Besides,
the type of T-cell epitopes should also be selected. Because of the numerous pairs of
HLA-peptide, we don’t show predicted score of all pairs. Only the peptide-HLA pairs
which satisfied all thresholds would be showed in this page. Figure 2a and Figure 2b
show the searching results when selecting “2019-nCoV, S and HLA I allele”, “2019nCoV, S and HLA II allele”, respectively.
The searchable data in the “Peptide” page is the combined result of previous
predicted B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes. In this page, the only selectable parameter
is the protein. On click the search button with protein S selected, a table will show
(Figure 3a). The first column is the protein name. The second column is the peptide that
either be predicted T-cell epitopes presented by HLA I alleles (with green background)
or HLA II alleles (with yellow background). Amino acids that have been predicted as
B cell epitopes by at least five tools are labeled in red. The third is an adjustment score
to evaluate the possibility of this peptide to be B cell epitopes. The formulation is as
follows:
𝐵_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =

Where L is the length of the peptide, a is the amino acid that belongs to the peptide, 𝑛𝑎
is the number of tools convinced that amino acid is part of B-cell epitopes. The
fourth/fifth columns are the frequency of HLA I/II alleles that could present the peptide.
On click the number would show the detailed HLA alleles (Figure 3b). The last column
is the number of coronavirus that encodes the peptide. The detailed coronavirus and the
peptide location in this coronavirus would show on click the number (Figure 3c). The
table displays in descent according to the frequency of HLA I alleles by default.
However, other columns could also be sortable.
Shared B/T-cell epitopes
Though the evolution rate of human coronavirus is fast, we try to find out B/T cell
epitopes conserved and shared in different coronaviruses for the pan-coronavirus
vaccine development. Based on the predicted B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes, we
found 77 peptides that exist in all coronaviruses have the potential to induce T-cell
activation and 10 of them with B_score larger than 4 (Table S3, Table 2). In particular,
the peptide YFKYWDQTY from ORF1ab could be presented by 7.33% people, which
might be a good candidate for vaccine design.
All the T-cell epitopes shared in four coronaviruses are located in ORF1ab.
However, the S protein of the coronavirus is the most important protein where the
receptor binding domain (RBD) located. So we further investigated the shared epitopes
that located in S protein. There are 265 potential epitopes in S protein shared by three
coronaviruses and 35 of them with B_score larger than 5 (Table S4). The peptides
VYDPLQPEL and TVYDPLQPEL even have B_score larger than 6, and they can be
presented by 8.26% and 2.44% people, respectively, which indicates their feasibility to
be pan-coronavirus vaccine targets.
The shared B/T-cell epitopes could be found in the “Peptide” page in COVIEdb
and we believe that these results could benefit the vaccine development currently on
2019-nCoV and also the potential coronavirus outbreak in the future.

Discussion

Research groups all over the world are trying to find the way to control 2019-nCoV.
Several studies focus on the B/T-cell epitopes for accelerating vaccine development.
The group who maintain the database IEDB identified potential targets for immune
responses to the 2019-nCoV by sequence homology with closely related SARS-CoV
and by a priori epitope prediction using bioinformatics approaches [26]. A recent
accepted work executed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-HLA I allele
binding affinity across 145 HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all 2019-nCoV peptides
to discover the HLA susceptibility map for 2019-nCoV [27].
However, the vaccine development can't react immediately to control a novel
coronavirus epidemic. The better choice is to prepare candidate vaccines before the
outbreak coming. For this purpose, we predicted all the potential B/T-cell epitopes of
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13-CoV and want to find out the
shared B/T-cell epitopes among them, which may be potential pan-coronavirus vaccine
targets. Based on the predicted results by different tools, we find several peptides that
could be vaccine candidates for hCoVs such as YFKYWDQTY in ORF1ab,
VYDPLQPEL and TVYDPLQPEL in S protein. We believe that these results and the
developed database could benefit not only the vaccine (especially the polyvalent
vaccine which could protect from various coronavirus) development but also provide
the targets for drug design such as neutralizing antibody on 2019-nCoV and the possible
coronavirus outbreak in the future.
