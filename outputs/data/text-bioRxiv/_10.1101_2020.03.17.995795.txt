Abstract
COVID-19 is the most rapidly expanding coronavirus outbreak in the
past two decades. To provide a swift response to a novel outbreak, prior
knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential. Here, we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks, specifically SARS and MERS, relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing
over 35 million papers from the last 20 years. Our results demonstrate
that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared to
other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and drops drastically upon
the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and
limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus
management and prevention. Independent of the outcome of the current
COVID-19 outbreak, we believe that measures should be taken to encourage sustained research in the field.

Introduction

Infectious diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
in developed countries and particularly in the developing world [1]. According to
the World Health Organization, out of the top-10 causes of death globally, three
are infectious diseases [1]. In light of the continuous emergence of infections,

the burden of infectious diseases is expected to become even greater in the near
future [2, 3]. Many emerging pathogens are RNA viruses, and notable examples
over the last two decades include the SARS coronavirus in 2002-2003 in China,
pandemic influenza (swine flu) A/H1N1 in 2009, the MERS coronavirus in 2012
in the Middle East, and Ebola virus disease in 2013-2014 in Africa.
Currently, the world is struggling with a novel strain of coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) that emerged in China during late 2019 and by the time of this writing
has infected more than 4,400,000 people and killed more than 302,000 [4, 5].
COVID-19 is the latest and third serious human coronavirus outbreak in the
past 20 years. Additionally, of course, there are several more typical circulating
seasonal human coronaviruses causing respiratory infections. It is still too early
to predict the epidemic course of COVID-19, but it is already a pandemic that
appears more difficult to contain than its close relative SARS-CoV [6, 7].
Much can be learned from past infectious disease outbreaks to improve preparedness and response to future public health threats. Three key questions
arise in light of the COVID-19 outbreak: To what extent were the previous
human coronaviruse (SARS and MERS) outbreaks studied?
Is research on
emerging viruses being sustained, aiming to understand and prevent future epidemics? Are there lessons from academic publications on previous emerging
viruses that could be applied to the current COVID-19 epidemic?
In this study, we answer these vital questions by utilizing state-of-the-art
data science tools to perform a large-scale analysis of 35 million papers, of which
1,908,211 concern the field of virology. We explore nearly two decades of infectious disease research published from 2002 up to today. We particularly focus
on public health crises, such as SARS, influenza (including seasonal, pandemic
H1N1, and avian influenza), MERS, and Ebola virus disease, and compare them
to HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis B and C, three bloodborne viruses that are
associated with a significant global health burden for more than two decades.
A crucial aspect of being prepared for future epidemics is sustained ongoing research of emerging infectious diseases even at ‘times of peace’ when such
viruses do not pose an active threat. Our results demonstrate that research on
previous coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, was conducted by a relatively
small number of researchers centered in a small number of countries, suggesting
that such research could be better encouraged. We propose that regardless of
the fate of COVID-19 in the near future, sustained research efforts should be
encouraged to be better prepared for the next outbreak.

Background

This research is a large-scale scientometric study in the field of infectious diseases. We focus on the quantitative features and characteristics of infectious
disease research over the past two decades. In this section, we present studies
that analyze and survey real-world trends in the field of infectious diseases (see
the Infectious Disease Trends subsection) and studies that relate to bibliometric
trends in general and public health in particular (see the Bibliometric Trends

subsection).

2.1

Infectious Disease Trends

There is great promise in utilizing big data to study epidemiology [8]. One approach is to gather data using different surveillance systems. For example, one
such system is ProMED. ProMED was launched 25 years ago as an email service
to identify unusual worldwide health events related to emerging and reemerging
infectious diseases [9]. It is used daily around the globe by public health policy makers, physicians, veterinarians, and other healthcare workers, researchers,
private companies, journalists, and the general public. Reports are produced
and commentary is provided by a global team of subject-matter experts in a
variety of fields. ProMED has over 80,000 subscribers and over 60,000 cumulative event reports from almost every country in the world. Additionally, there
are many different systems used by different countries and health organizations
worldwide.
In 2006, Cowen et al. [10] evaluated the ProMED dataset from the years 1996
to 2004. They discovered that there are diseases that received more extensive
coverage than others; “86 disease subjects had thread lengths of at least 10
reports, and 24 had 20 or more.” They note that the pattern of occurrence
is hard to explain even by an expert in epidemiology. Also, with the level of
granularity of ProMED data, it is very challenging to predict the frequency
that diseases are going to accrue. In 2008, Jones et al. [2] analyzed the global
temporal and spatial patterns of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). They
analyzed 305 EIDs between 1940 and 2004 and demonstrated that the threat of
EIDs to global health is increasing. The same year, Freifeld et al. [11] developed
HealthMap, an interactive surveillance system that integrates disease outbreak
reports from various sources.
Data about infectious diseases can also come from web- and social-based
sources. For instance, in 2009, Ginsberg et al. [12] used Google search queries to
monitor the spread of influenza epidemics. They used the fact that many people
search online before going to doctors, and they found that during a pandemic,
the volume of searches differs from normal. They then created a mathematical
model to forecast the spread of flu. This research was later converted into a
tool called Google Flu Trends, and at its peak, Google Flu Trends was deployed
in 29 countries worldwide. However, not everything worked well for Google Flu
Trends; in 2009, it underestimated the flu volume, and in 2013, it predicted
more than double the number of cases than the true volume [13]. As a result
of such discrepancies, Google shut down the Google Flu Trends website in 2015
and transferred its data to academic researchers [14]. Also in 2009, Carneiro
and Mylonakis [15] used large amounts of data to predict flu outbreaks a week
earlier than prevention surveillance systems.
In 2010, Lampos and Cristianini [16] extended the idea of Carneiro and
Mylonakis [15] to use temporal data to monitor outbreaks. Instead of using
Google Trends, they used Twitter as their data source. They collected 160,000
tweets from the UK, and as ground truth, they used HPA weekly reports about

the H1N1 epidemic. Using textual markers to measure flu on Twitter, they
demonstrated that Twitter can be used to study disease outbreaks, similar to
Google Trends. Also the same year, Salathé and Khandelwal [17] analyzed
Twitter and demonstrated that it is possible to use social networks to study
not only the spread of infectious disease but also vaccinations. They found a
correlation between the sentiment in tweets toward an influenza vaccine and the
vaccination rate.
In 2014, Generous et al. [18] used Wikipedia to monitor and forecast infectious disease outbreaks. They examined Wikipedia access logs to forecast outbreak volumes for 14 combinations of diseases and locations. The model worked
successfully for only 8 out of the 14 cases. Also, the authors suggested that it
was even possible to transfer a model between locations without retraining it.
In contrast to most of the web-based disease monitoring methods, Wikipediabased monitoring presents a fully open forecasting system that can be easily
reproducible. Generally, in the past couple of years, Wikipedia has become a
widely used data source for medical studies [19, 20]. Moreover, a recent report
[21] shows that Wikipedia has successfully kept itself clean from the misinformation spread during the COVID-19 outbreak. In 2015, Santillana et al. [22]
took the influenza surveillance one step further by fusing multiple data sources.
They used five datasets: Twitter, Google Trends, near real-time hospital visit
records, FluNearYou, and Google Flu Trends. They used all these data sources
with a machine-learning algorithm to predict influenza outbreaks. In 2017, McGough et al. [23] dealt with the problem of significant delays in the publication
of official government reports about Zika cases. To solve this problem, they used
the combined data of Google Trends, Twitter, and the HealthMap surveillance
system to predict estimates of Zika cases in Latin America.
In 2018, Breugelmans et al. [24] explored the effects of publishing in open
access journals and collaboration between European and sub-Saharan African
researchers in the study of poverty-related disease. To this end they used the
PubMed dataset but discovered it is not suited to performing full bibliometric
analysis; to deal with this issue they also utilized Web Of Science as a data
source. They discovered that there is an advantage for open access publications
in terms of citations. In 2020, Head et al. [25] studied infectious disease funding.
They discovered that HIV/AIDS is the most funded disease. Additionally, they
discovered a pattern where Ebola, Zika, influenza, and coronavirus funding were
highest after an outbreak.
There is substantial controversy surrounding the use of web-based data to
predict the volume of outbreaks. The limitations of Google Flu Trends, mentioned above, raised the question of reliability of social data for assessing disease spread. Lazer [26] noted that these types of methods are problematic since
companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter are constantly changing their
products. Studies based on such data sources may be valid today but not be
valid tomorrow, and may even be unreproducible.

2.2

Bibliometric Trends

In 2005, Vergidis et al. [27] used PubMed and JCR (Journal Citation Reports)
to study trends in microbiology publications. They discovered that microbiology research in the US had the highest average impact factor, but in terms of
research production, Western Europe was first. In 2008, Uthman [28] analyzed
trends in paper publications about HIV in Nigeria. He found growth (from 1 to
33) of the number of publications about HIV in Nigeria and that papers with
international collaborations were published in journals with a higher impact
factor. In 2009, Ramos et al. [29] used Web of Science to study publications
about infectious diseases in European countries. They found that more papers
in total were published about infectious diseases in Europe than in the US.
In 2012, Takahashi-Omoe and Omoe [30] surveyed publications of 100 journals about infectious diseases. They discovered that the US and the UK had
the highest number of publications, and relative to the country’s socioeconomic
status, the Netherlands, India, and China had relatively high productivity. In
2014, similar to Wislar et al. [31], Kennedy et al. [32] studied ghost authorship
in nursing journals instead of biomedical journals. They found that there were
27.6% and 42% of ghost and honorary authorships, respectively.
In 2015, Wiethoelter et al. [33] explored worldwide infectious disease trends
at the wildlife-livestock interface. They found that 7 out of the top 10 most
popular diseases were zoonoses. In 2017, Dong et al. [34] studied the evolution
of scientific publications by analyzing 89 million papers from the Microsoft Academic dataset. Similar to the increase found by Aboukhalil [35], they also found
a drastic increase in the number of authors per paper. In 2019, Fire and Guestrin
[36] studied the over-optimization in academic publications. They found that
the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric for academic success
as a result of longer author lists, shorter papers, and surging publication numbers. Citation-based metrics, such as citation number and h-index, are likewise
affected by the flood of papers, self-citations, and lengthy reference lists.

Data Description

In this study, we fused four data sources to extract insights about research on
emerging viruses. In the rest of this subsection we describe these data sources.
1. MAG - Microsoft Academic Graph is a dataset containing “scientific publication records, citation relationships between those publications, as well
as authors, institutions, journals, conferences, and fields of study” [37].
The MAG dataset we used was from 22 March 2019 and contains data on
over 210 million papers [38]. This dataset was used as the main dataset
of the study. Similar to Fire and Guestrin [36], we only used papers that
had at least 5 references in order to filter non peer-reviewed publications,
such as news columns which are published in journals.
2. PubMed - PubMed is a dataset based on the PubMed search engine of
academic publications on the topics of medicine, nursing, dentistry, vet5

erinary medicine, health care systems, and preclinical sciences [39]. One
of the major advantages of using the PubMed dataset is that it contains
only medical-related publications. The data on each PubMed paper contains information about its venue, authors, and affiliations, but it does
not contain citation data. In this study, we used the 2018 annual baseline
PubMed dataset containing 29,138,919 records[40]. We mainly utilized
the PubMed dataset to analyze journal publications (see Paper Trends
Section).
3. SJR - Scientific Journal Rankings is a dataset containing the information
and ranking of over 34,100 journals from 1999 to 2018 [41], including their
SJR indicator,1 the best quartile of the journal,2 and more. We utilized
the SJR dataset to compare the rankings of different journals to assess the
level of their prestige.
4. Wikidata - Wikidata is a dataset holding a vast knowledge about the
world, containing data on over 78,252,808 items [44]. Wikidata stores
metadata about items, and each item has an identifier and can be associated with other items. We utilized the Wikidata dataset to extract
geographic information for academic institutions in order to match a paper
with its authors’ geographic locations.

Analyses
Infectious Disease Analysis

To study the research of emerging viruses over time, we analyzed the datasets
described in the Data Description section. In pursuing this goal, we used the
code framework recently published by Fire and Guestrin [36], which enables
the easy extraction of the structured data of papers from the MAG dataset.
The MAG and PubMed datasets were filtered according to a predefined list of
keywords. The keyword search was performed in the following way: given a set
of diseases D and a set of papers P , from each paper title pt , where p ∈ P ,
we created a set of word-grams. Word-grams are defined as n-grams of words,
i.e., all the combinations of a set of words in a phrase, without disrupting the
order of the words. For example, the word-grams of the string “Information on
Swine Flu,” word-grams(Information on Swine Flu), will return the following
set: {Information, on, Swine, Flu, Information on, on Swine, Swine Flu, Information on Swine, on Swine Flu, Information on Swine Flu}. Next, for each
p, we calculated word-gram(pt ) ∩ D, which was considered as the diseases with
which the paper was associated.

takes into account the number of citations and the prestige of the source of the citing paper

and the total number of journals in the category (Y), so that (X / Y) = Percentile Rank Z”

In the current study, we focused on the past emerging coronaviruses (SARS
and MERS). There are many other strains of the human coronavirus, and four of
them are known for causing seasonal respiratory infections [45]. We focused on
SARS and MERS since they are closer to SARS-CoV-2 and both have zoonotic
origins and raised international public health concern. Additionally, we also
analyzed Ebola virus disease, influenza (seasonal, avian influenza, swine flu),
HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C as comparators that represent other
important emerging infectious diseases from the past two decades. For these nine
diseases, we collected all their aliases, which were added to the set of diseases
D and were used as keywords to filter the datasets. To reduce the false-positive
rate, we analyzed only papers that, according to the MAG dataset, were in the
categories of medicine or biology, and following Fire and Guestrin [36] had at
least five references. Additionally, to explore the trend in the core categories
of infectious disease research, we performed the same analysis on the virology
category. In the rest of this section, we describe the specific calculations and
analyses we performed.
4.1.1

Paper Trends

To explore the volume of studies on emerging viruses, we examined the publication of papers about infectious diseases. First, we defined several notions
that we used to define publication and citation rates. Let D be a set of disease
names and P a set of papers. Namely, for a paper p ∈ P , pDisease is defined as
the disease that matches the paper’s keywords, pyear as the paper’s publication
year, and pcitations as the set of papers citing p. Using these notions, we defined
the following features:
• Number of Citations - the total number of citations for a specific infectious
disease.
• Number of Papers - the total number of published papers for a specific
infectious disease.
• Normalized Citation Rate (N CRy ) - the ratio between the Number of Citations on a specific infectious disease d and the total number of citations
about medicine or biology in year y.3

Using these metrics, we inspected how the coronavirus publication and citation rates differed from other examined EIDs. We analyzed how trends of
citations and publications have changed over time. Additionally, to inspect
the similarities between the trends of different diseases we calculated the DTW
(Dynamic time warping) distance [46] between all the disease pairs. Finally, we
clustered the time-series using TimeSeriesKMeans [47]
4.1.2

Journal Trends

To investigate the relationship between journals and their publication of papers about emerging viruses, we combined the Semantic Scholar and PubMed
datasets with the SJR dataset using ISSN, and selected all the journals from SJR
categories related to infectious diseases (immunology, epidemiology, infectious
diseases, virology, and microbiology). First, we inspected whether coronavirus
papers are published in the top journals. We selected the top-10 journals by
SJR and calculated the number of papers they had published for each disease
over time. Next, we inspected how published papers about coronavirus are regarded relative to other EIDs in terms of ranking. To this end, we defined a new
metric, JScoret . JScoret is defined as the average SJR score of all published
papers on a specific topic t. We used JScoret to observe how the prominence of
each disease in the publication world has changed over time. Lastly, we explored
publications by looking at the quartile ranking of the journal over time.
4.1.3

Author Trends

To study how scientific authorship has changed in the field of infectious diseases,
we explored what characterizes the authors of papers on different diseases. We
inspected the number of new authors over time to check how attractive emerging viruses are to new researchers. Additionally, we analyzed the number of
experienced authors, where author experience is defined as the time that has
passed from his or her first publication. The authors were identified by the
identification number provided in the MAG dataset. Author disambiguation
is a challenging task; Microsoft combined multiple methods to generate their
author identifications [48]. We also analyzed the number of authors who wrote
multiple papers about each disease.
4.1.4

Collaboration Trends

To inspect the state of international collaborations in emerging virus research,
we mapped academic institutions to geolocation. However, it is not a trivial
task to match institution names. Institution names are sometimes written differently; for example, Aalborg University Hospital and Aalborg University are
affiliated. However, there are cases where two similar names refer to different
institutions; for example, the University of Washington and Washington University are entirely different institutions. To deal with this problem, we used
the affiliation table in the MAG dataset. To determine the country and city of
each author, we applied a five-step process:

1. For each institution, we looked for the institution’s page on Wikidata.
From each Wikidata page, we extracted all geography-related fields.4
2. To first merge all the Wikidata location fields, we used the “coordinate
location” with reverse geocoding to determine the city and country of the
institution.
3. For all the institutions that did not have a “coordinate location” field, we
extracted the location data from the other available fields. We crossed the
data against city and country lists from GeonamesCache Python library
[49] to determine whether the data in the field described a city or a country.
4. To acquire country data for an institution that had only city data on
Wikidata, we used GeonamesCache city-to-country mapping lists.
5. To get city and country data for institutions that did not have the relevant
fields on Wikidata, we extracted geographic coordinates from Wikipedia.org.5
Even though Wikidata and Wikipedia.org are both operated by the Wikimedia Foundation, they are independent projects which have different
data. Similar to Wikidata coordinates, we used reverse geocoding to determine the city and country of the institution.
Using the extracted geodata, we explored how international collaborations change
over time in coronavirus research. Finally, we explored which countries have the
highest number of papers about coronavirus and which countries have the highest number of international collaborations over time.
4 The fields used were “coordinate location (P625),” “country (P17),” “located at street
address (P6375),” “located in the administrative territorial entity (P131),” “headquarters
location (P159),” and “location (P276).”

Results

In the following subsections, we present all the results of the experiments which
were described in the Analyses section.

5.1

Results of Paper Trends

In recent years, there has been a surge in academic publications, yielding more
than 1 million new papers related to medicine and biology each year (see Figure
1a). In contrast to the overall growth in the number of infectious disease papers,
there has been a relative decline in the number of papers about the coronaviruses
SARS and MERS (see Figure 1b). Also, we found that 0.4% of virology studies
in our corpus from the past 20 years involved human SARS and MERS, while
HIV/AIDS accounts for 7.9 % of all virology studies. We observed that, unlike
the research in the domain of HIV/AIDS and avian influenza that has been

published at a high and steady pace over the last 20 years, SARS was studied
at an overwhelming rate after the 2002-2004 outbreak and then sharply dropped
after 2005 (Figure 2). In terms of Normalized Paper Rate (see Figure 2), after
the first SARS outbreak, there was a peak in publishing SARS-related papers
with NPR twice as high as Ebola’s. However, the trend dropped very quickly,
and a similar phenomenon can be observed for the swine flu pandemic. The
MERS outbreak achieved a much lower NPR than SARS, specifically more than
16 times lower when comparing the peaks in SARS and MERS trends. In terms
of Normalized Citation Rate (Figure 3), we observed the same phenomenon
as we did with NPR. Observing Figures 9 and 10, we can see that there are
diseases with very similar trends. More precisely, NPR and NCR trends are
in two clusters, where the first cluster contains avian influenza, Ebola, MERS,
SARS, and swine flu, and the second cluster contains HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, and influenza.

have a drastic increase in their normalized number of citations mostly represent
an outbreak.

5.2

Results of Journal Trends

From analyzing the trends in journal publications, we discovered the numbers of
papers published by journal quartile are very similar to Normalized Paper Rate
and Normalized Citation Rate (see Figure 4). We observed that for most of
the diseases, the trends are quite similar: a growth in the study rate is coupled
with a growth in the number of published papers in Q1 journals. We discovered
that for SARS, MERS, the swine flu, and Ebola, Q1 publication trends were
almost parallel to their NPR trends (see Figures 2 and 4). Also, we noticed that
HIV, avian influenza, influenza, and hepatitis B and C have steady publication
numbers in Q1 journals. Looking at papers in highly ranked journals (Figure
5), we observed that the diseases which are being continuously published in top10 ranked journals are mainly persisting diseases, such as HIV and influenza.
Additionally, we inspected how the average journal ranking of publications by
disease has changed over time (Figure 6). We found that only MERS had a
decline of JScore. We also noticed that current papers about SARS had the
highest JScore.

emerging infectious diseases, avian influenza did not demonstrate a decline in

Results of Author Trends

By studying the authorship trends in the research of emerging viruses, we discovered that there is a difference in the average experience of authors among
diseases. SARS researchers had the lowest experience in years, and hepatitis C
had the most experienced researchers (see Table 1). We noticed that the SARS
research community had a smaller percentage of relatively prolific researchers
than other diseases. Moreover, researchers with multiple papers related to SARS
and MERS published on average 3.8 papers, while hepatitis C researchers published on average 5.2 papers during the same period. Additionally, from analyzing authors who published multiple papers on a specific disease, we found that
on average there was a 2.5 paper difference between HIV and SARS authors.
Furthermore, swine flu, SARS, and MERS were the diseases on which authors
published the lowest number of multiple papers.

Results of Collaboration Trends

By inspecting global collaboration and research efforts, we found that the geolocation of researchers correlated with publication trends. For instance, most
SARS, MERS, hepatitis B, and avian influenza research was done by investigators based in the US and China (Figure 7). In the case of SARS and MERS,
most of the research stemmed from China and the US (Figure 8) with only
about 17% of SARS papers’ first authors being located in Europe. Overall, researchers from 57 and 67 countries have studied MERS and SARS, respectively.
However, the vast majority of SARS papers (73%) were written by researchers
in only 6 countries (Figure 7). While the US was dominant in the research of
all inspected diseases, China showed an increased output in only these three
diseases. Also, MERS and SARS were studied in the least number of countries,
and HIV was studied in the highest number of countries (Figure 7). Moreover,
SARS and MERS were the diseases least studied in Europe, with only 17% and
19% of SARS and MERS studies, respectively, as opposed to Ebola studies, 29%

Discussion

In this study, we analyzed trends in the research of emerging viruses over the
past two decades with emphasis on emerging coronaviruses (SARS and MERS).
We compared the research of these two coronavirus epidemics to seven other
emerging viral infectious diseases as comparators. To this end, we used multiple
bibliometric datasets, fusing them to get additional insights. Using this data, we
explored the research of epidemiology from the perspectives of papers, journals,
authors, and international collaborations.
By analyzing the results presented in the Results section, the following can be
noted: First, the surge in infectious disease publications (Figure 1) supports the
results of Fire and Guestrin [36] that found there has been a general escalation
of scientific publications. We found that the growth in the number of infectious

disease publications is very similar to other fields. Hence, Goodhart’s Law6
did not skip the world of virology research. However, alongside the general
growth in the number of papers, we observed that there was a decline in the
relative number of papers on the specific infectious diseases we inspected. The
most evident drastic drop in the publication rate happened after an epidemic
ended. It appears that, for a short while, many researchers study an outbreak,
but later their efforts are reduced. This is strengthened by considering the
average number of multiple papers per author for each disease (see Table 2).
Additionally, similar patterns were found in the funding of MERS and SARS
research [25], which indicates that there is a possibility that the research rate
has decreased due to lack of funding.
Second, when looking at journal publications, we noted very similar patterns
occurred for citations and publications. This result emphasizes that fewer publications, and hence fewer citations, translate into fewer papers in Q1 journals
(Figure 4). Also, we observed the same patterns as Fire and Guestrin [36], with
most of the papers being published in Q1 journals and the minority published
in Q2-Q4 journals. This trend started to change when zooming in and analyzing publications in top-10 ranked journals (Figure 5). While we can see some
correlation to outbreaks in Ebola, swine flu, and SARS, it is harder to interpret
the curve of HIV since there were no focused epidemics in the past 20 years
but a global burden, and we did not observe similar patterns in publications
and citations. Observing the JScore (Journal Trends Section) results (Figure
6), most diseases showed a steady increase, but two diseases behaved rather
anomalously. MERS had a decline since 2013, which is reasonable to expect after the initial outbreak, but we did not see the same trend in the other diseases
and there is a general trend of increasing average SJR [36]. The second anomaly
is that SARS had an increase in JScore alongside a decrease in citations and
publication numbers. Inspecting the data, we discovered that in 2017 there were
three published papers in Lancet Infectious Diseases and in 2015 two papers in
Journal of Experimental Medicine about SARS, and both journals have a very
high SJR. These publications increased the JScore drastically. This anomaly is
a result of outliers in the data that biased the results. We can observe in Figure 4 that in the last decade the number of SARS papers published in ranked
journals dropped drastically. It dropped low enough that two outliers created
a bias on the JScore. Generally, the less data we have, the greater chance for
outliers to cause bias in the data.
Third, we observed that on average authors write a fewer number of multiple
papers on diseases that are characterized by large epidemics, such as the swine
flu and SARS. On the other side of the scale are hepatitis C and HIV, which are
persistent viral diseases with high global burdens. These diseases involve more
prolific authors. Regarding Ebola and MERS, it is too early to predict if they
will behave similarly to SARS since they are relatively new and require further
follow up.
Fourth, looking at international collaboration, we observed the US to be

very dominant in all the disease studies (Figure 7). Looking at China, we found
it to be mainly dominant in diseases that were epidemiologically relevant to
public health in China, such as SARS, avian influenza, and hepatitis B. When
looking at Ebola, which has not been a threat to China for the last two decades,
we observed a relatively low investment in its research in China. We observed
that regarding MERS, we found similar results to Sa’ed [50]. In both studies
the top-3 biggest contributors in MERS studies were the US, China, and Saudi
Arabia.
Many of the trends we observed are related to the pattern of the diseases.
We observed two main types of infectious diseases with distinct trends. The
first type was emerging viral infections like SARS and Ebola. Their academic
outputs tend to peak after an epidemic and then subside. The second type were
viral infections with high burdens such hepatitis B and HIV, for which there is
a more or less constant trend. These trends were most evident in publication
and citation numbers, as well as journal metrics. The collaboration and author
distributions were more affected by where the outbreak occurred or where there
was a high burden. This was also strengthened in the clusters we found where
they were divided in the same way.
In terms of practical implications, we see several options. First, notwithstanding the importance of pathogen discovery, as evident in projects like the
Global Virome Project [51] that is trying to discover unknown zoonotic viruses
to stop future outbreaks, it is still important to monitor the status of current
research that concerns known pathogens. It can be observed from Figures 2
and 3 that there are diseases with declining interest from the scientific community. These trends are harder to spot when looking at the total number of
publications since the total number of papers generally keeps growing (Figure
1a). Using NPR and NCR can help decision makers investigate if additional
resources should be invested in the study of these diseases. For instance, while
SARS and MERS were in WHO’s R&D Blueprint as priority diseases, they still
exhibited a decline in their research rate. Second, using collaboration data, it
is possible to find which countries have potential for growth in the number of
researchers on specific diseases and also which bilateral grants have potential.
Currently, there is no doubt that we have to be better prepared for the next
pandemic and the emergence of “Disease X.” We observed that currently there
is a non-sustained investment in EIDs such as SARS and MERS, which is a
key issue. Another crucial issue is the sharing of research material such as data
and code. Data and code allow scientists to make more accurate discoveries
faster by continuing knowledge from previous studies. Using the MAG dataset
Paper Resources table, we inspected how many papers from the nine diseases we
analyzed had code or data. We found that there were 30 and 75 papers that had
data and code, respectively. These numbers are very low, and we suspect that
there are a lot of missing data in this table. We firmly believe that publishing
code and data should be mandatory when possible.
This study may have several limitations. To analyze the data, we relied
on titles to associate papers with diseases. While a title is very important in
classifying the topic of a paper, some papers may discuss a disease without

mentioning its name in the title. Additionally, there may be false positives;
for instance, an acronym might have several meanings that are not related to
an infectious disease term. An additional limitation is our focus on a limited
number of distinct diseases. There are other emerging infections not evaluated
here in which could have followed other trends. To deal with some of these
limitations, we only analyzed papers that were categorized as medicine and
biology papers as a means to reduce false positives. Furthermore, we show that
the same trends appeared even when we filtered all the papers by the category of
virology (see Figures 11 and 12). Finally, we compared papers that were tagged
with a MeSH term on PubMed to the papers we retrieved using our keyword
search of the title. We found that we matched MeSH terms with 73% recall,
which is in the range described by Breugelmans et al. [24].
In the future, we would like to perform extended collaboration analysis by
improving the institution country mapping. Currently, we were able to identify
94.2% of the countries of origin for the institutions in the MAG affiliation table.
We intend to improve the institution country mapping by using additional data
sources. Additionally, we are planning to extend our study into other diseases
and look for correlations with real-world data such as global disease burden.

Conclusions

The COVID-19 outbreak has emphasized the insufficient knowledge available on
emerging coronaviruses. Here, we explored how previous coronavirus outbreaks
and other emerging viral epidemics have been studied over the last two decades.
From inspecting the research outputs in this field from several different angles,
we demonstrate that the interest of the research community in an emerging infection is temporarily associated with the dynamics of the incident and that a
drastic drop of interest is evident after the initial epidemic subsides. This translates into limited collaborations and a non-sustained investment in research on
coronaviruses. Such a short-lived investment also involves reduced funding as
presented by Head et al. [25] and may slow down important developments such
as new drugs, vaccines, or preventive strategies. There has been an unprecedented explosion of publications on COVID-19 since January 2020 and also a
significant allocation of research funding. We believe the lessons learned from
the scientometrics of previous epidemics argue that regardless of the outcome
of COVID-19, efforts to sustain research in this field should be made. More
specifically, in 2017 [52] and 2018 [53], SARS and MERS were considered to be
priority diseases in WHO’s R&D Blueprint, but their research rate did not grow
relative to other diseases. Therefore, the translation of international policy and
public health priorities into a research agenda should be continuously monitored
and enhanced.
