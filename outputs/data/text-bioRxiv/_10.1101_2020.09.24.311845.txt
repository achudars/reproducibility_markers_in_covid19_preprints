Abstract

2

We report the likely most recent common ancestor of SARS‐CoV‐2 – the coronavirus that causes COVID‐

3

19. This progenitor SARS‐CoV‐2 genome was recovered through a novel application and advancement of

4

computational methods initially developed to reconstruct the mutational history of tumor cells in a

5

patient. The progenitor differs from the earliest coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants,

6

implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise to all the human

7

infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and the USA harbored the progenitor

8

genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting that the progenitor was spreading worldwide as

9

soon as weeks after the first reported cases of COVID‐19. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots

10

have produced many dominant coronavirus strains, which have spread episodically over time.

11

Fingerprinting based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated

12

North America for most of the pandemic. There have been multiple replacements of predominant

13

coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia and the continued presence of multiple high‐frequency strains in

14

Asia and North America. We provide a continually updating dashboard of global evolution and

15

spatiotemporal trends of SARS‐CoV‐2 spread (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).

Main

18

Despite an unprecedented scope of global genome sequencing of Severe acute respiratory syndrome

19

coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and a multitude of phylogenetic analyses1–5, the early evolutionary history

20

of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains unclear. Sophisticated investigations have found that traditional molecular

21

phylogenetic analyses do not produce reliable evolutionary inferences about the early history of SARS‐

22

CoV‐2 due to low sequence divergence, a limited number of phylogenetically informative sites, and the

23

ubiquity of sequencing errors6–8. In particular, the root of the SARS‐CoV‐2 phylogeny remains elusive9,10

24

because the closely‐related non‐human coronavirus (outgroups) more than 1,100 base differences

25

from human SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes, as compared to fewer than 30 differences between human SARS‐

26

CoV‐2 genomes’ sequenced early on (December 2019 and January 2020)7,9–15. Without a reliable root

27

of the SARS‐CoV‐2 phylogeny, one cannot accurately reconstruct the most recent ancestor sequence.

28

Consequently, we cannot determine if any of the coronaviruses isolated to date carried the genome of

29

the most recent common ancestor (progenitor) of all human SARS‐CoV‐2 infections. Knowing the

30

progenitor genome will help us determine how close the earliest patients sampled in China represent

31

are to “patient zero,” i.e., the first case of human transmission.

32

The orientation and order of early mutations giving rise to common coronavirus variants will be misled

33

if the earliest coronavirus isolates are incorrectly used to root the SARS‐CoV‐2 phylogenies3,16–18. The

34

earliest investigations of COVID‐19 patients and their coronaviruses' genomes already reported the

35

presence of multiple variants19,20, and genomes of viral samples from December 2019 had as many as

36

five differences from each other. These observations require an explicit test of the assumption that one

37

of the early sampled coronavirus genomes was the most recent common ancestor (progenitor) of all

38

the strains infecting humans. Traditionally, the ancestral sequence of organisms is estimated by using

39

a rooted phylogeny21,22. This ancestral sequence can then be compared with sequenced genomes to

40

find the one that is most similar to that of the inferred progenitor and/or placed closest to the root in

41

the phylogeny. However, as noted above, attempts using ad hoc and traditional methods are fraught

42

with difficulties and have produced contradictory results9,10. Some methods also incorporate sampling

43

times in phylogenetic inference, but they favor placing the earliest sampled genomes at or near the

44

root of the tree10. This practice introduces a degree of circularity in testing the hypothesis that the

45

earliest sampled genomes were ancestral because sampling time is used in the inference procedure.

46

Results and Discussion

47

A mutational order approach for SARS‐CoV‐2

48

We applied a mutation order approach (MOA) that directly reconstructs the ancestral sequence and

49

the mutational history of genomes23–25 without inferring a phylogeny as an intermediate step. MOA is

50

often used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of tumor cells that evolve clonally and without

51

recombination. This approach is well‐suited for analyzing SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes because of their quasi‐

52

species evolutionary behavior (clonal) and because of the lack of evidence of significant recombination

53

within human outbreaks, both of which preserve the collinearity of variants in genomes. This feature

54

permits effective use of shared co‐occurrence of variants in genomes, as well as the frequencies of

55

individual variants, to infer mutational history, notwithstanding the presence of sequencing errors and

56

other artifacts23,26 (see Methods). We advanced MOA for application in the analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2

57

genomes because the normal cell sequence in tumors provides a direct way to establish the ancestral

58

(non‐cancerous) genome. Such a direct ancestor is not available for coronaviruses in which the closest

59

outgroup sequences are over 30‐times more different than any two human strains. We also devised a

60

bootstrap approach to place confidence limits on the inferred mutation order in which bootstrap

61

replicate datasets are generated by sampling genomes with replacement (see Methods).

62

We analyzed two snapshots of the fast‐growing collection of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes to make inferences

63

and assess the robustness of the inferred mutational histories to the growing genome collection,

64

expanding at an unprecedented rate. The first snapshot was retrieved from GISAID27 on July 7, 2020,

65

and consisted of 60,332 genomes. Of these, 29,681 were selected because they were longer than the

66

28,000 bases threshold imposed (29KG dataset) and did not include an excessive number of unresolved

67

bases in any genomic regions. This second snapshot was acquired on October 12, 2020, from GISAID

68

and contained 133,741 genomes, of which 68,057 genomes met the inclusion criteria (68KG dataset).

69

In the following, we first present results from the 29KG dataset and then evaluate the concordance of

70

the mutational history inferred by using an expanded 68KG dataset, which establishes that the

71

conclusions are robust to the sampling of genomes. We then applied mutational fingerprints inferred

72

using the 68KG dataset to an expanded dataset of 172,480 genomes (sampled on December 30, 2020;

73

172KG) to track global spatiotemporal dynamics SARS‐CoV‐2. We have also set up a live dashboard

74

showing regularly updated results because the processes of data analysis, manuscript preparation, and

75

peer‐review of scientific articles are much slower than the pace of expansion of SARS‐CoV‐2 genome

76

collection. Also, we provide a simple “in‐the‐browser” tool to classify any SARS‐CoV‐2 genome based

77

on key mutations derived by the MOA analysis (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).

78

Mutational history and progenitor of SARS‐COV‐2

79

We used MOA to reconstruct the history of mutations that gave rise to 49 common single nucleotide

80

variants (SNVs) in the 29KG dataset (Fig. 1). These variants occur with greater than 1% variant frequency

81

(vf > 1%; Fig. 2a). For ease of reference, we used the inferred mutation history to denote key groups of

82

mutations by assigning Greek symbols (μ, ν, α, β, γ, δ, and ε) to them. Individual mutations were

83

assigned numbers and letters based on the reconstructed order and their parent‐offspring relationships

84

(Extended Data Table 1). We estimated the timing of mutation for each mutation based on the

85

timestamp of the viral samples' genome sequences in which it first appeared (Extended Data Table 1,

86

see Methods). The inferred mutation order generally agreed with the temporal pattern of the first

87

appearance of variants in the 29KG dataset. The sampling time of 47 out of 49 mutations was greater

88

than or equal to the first appearance of the corresponding preceding mutation in mutational history.

89

The exceptions were seen only for two low‐frequency offshoot mutations (3b and 3c; see Methods).

90

This concordance provides independent validation of the reconstructed mutation graph because

91

neither sampling dates nor locations were used in MOA analysis.

92

We found that new variants occurred in the genomic background of the variants preceding them in the

93

reconstructed mutation history with a very high propensity (co‐occurrence index, COI > 96.7%; Fig. 1).

94

This suggests a strong signal to infer a sequential mutational history. Indeed, a bootstrap analysis

95

involving genome resampling to assess the robustness of the mutation history produced high bootstrap

96

confidence levels (BCLs) for key groups of mutations as well as many offshoots (Fig. 1; BCL > 95%).

97

However, the order of some mutations was not established with a high BCL, e.g., the relative order of

98

ε1, ε2, and ε3 mutations. This is because the three ε variants almost always occur together (7,624

99

genomes), and the intermediate combinations of ε variants occurred in only 42 genomes. Similarly, the

100

count of genomes harboring all three β variants (22,739 genomes) far exceeded those with two or

101

fewer β variants (201 genomes). There is a strong temporal tendency of variants to be sampled together

102

(e.g., ε1 ‐ ε3 and α1a‐α1d), suggesting an episodic spread of variants (P << 0.01; see Methods). This

103

episodic spreading of variants, which do not allow for determining the precise order of mutation

104

appearance, may be caused by founder effects, positive selection, or both (e.g., ref.28). It may

105

sometimes be an artifact of highly uneven regional and temporal genome sequencing that will produce

106

a biased representative sample of the actual worldwide population (Fig. 2b).

107

The progenitor genome

108

The root of the mutation tree is the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all the genomes analyzed,

109

which gave rise to two early coronavirus lineages (ν and α; Fig. 1). The MRCA genome was the

110

progenitor of all SARS‐CoV‐2 infections globally, henceforth proCoV2, and was likely carried by the first

111

case of human transmission in the COVID‐19 pandemic (index case)20. It existed on or before December

112

24, 2019, a date for which we have the sequence of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in Wuhan, China (Wuhan‐1;

113

EPI_ISL 402123). A comparison of proCoV2 with Wuhan‐1 genomes revealed three differences in the

114

49 positions, which was also true for other reference genomes (Fig. 2c). This suggests that the Wuhan‐

115

1 and the other earliest sampled genomes are derived coronavirus strains that arose from proCoV2

116

after the divergence of ν and α lineages (Fig. 1). The Wuhan‐1 strain evolved by three successive α

117

mutations in the progenitor (α1, α2, and α3), a progression that is statistically supported (BCL = 100%).

118

This high resolution is made possible by 896 intermediate genomes containing one or two α variants in

119

the 29KG dataset. Importantly, three closely‐related non‐human coronavirus genomes (bats and

120

pangolin) all have the same base at these positions as does the proCoV2 genome, suggesting that the

121

ancestral genome did not contain α variants. Furthermore, genomes with ν variants of proCoV2 do not

122

contain the other 47 variants, all of which occurred on the genomes containing α1‐α3 that supports the

123

inference that coronaviruses lacking α variants were the ancestors of Wuhan‐1 and other genomes

124

sampled in December 2019 in China (Fig. 2c). Therefore, we conclude that Wuhan‐1 was not the direct

125

ancestor of all the coronavirus infections globally.

126

Did proCoV2 propagate in the human population in 2020? A comparison of the proCoV2 genetic

127

fingerprint (49 positions) in the 29KG collection revealed three matches in China (Fujian, Guangdong,

128

and Hangzhou) and three in the US (Washington) in January 2020 (Fig. 2c). One more match was found

129

in New York in March 2020, and the ν mutant of proCoV2 was first sampled 59 days after the Wuhan‐

130

1 strain. This means that the progenitor coronavirus spread and mutated in the human population for

131

weeks and months after the first reported COVID‐19 cases.

132

Because proCoV2 is three bases different from the Wuhan‐1 genome sampled on December 24, 2019,

133

we estimate that the divergence of earliest variants of proCoV2 occurred 5.8 ‐ 8.1 weeks prior based

134

on the range of possible mutation rates of coronavirus genomes20. This timeline puts the presence of

135

proCoV2 late‐October to mid‐November 2019 that is consistent with some other reports, including the

136

report of a fragment of spike protein identical to Wuhan‐1 in early December in Italy18,20,29–31. The

137

sequenced segment of the spike protein is short (409 bases). It does not span positions in which 49

138

major early variants were observed, which means that the Italian Spike protein fragment can only

139

confirm the existence of proCoV2 before the first coronavirus detection in China.

140

Comparisons of the protein sequences encoded by the proCoV2 genome revealed 131 other genomic

141

matches, which contained only synonymous differences from proCoV2. A majority (89 genomes) of

142

these matches were from coronaviruses sampled in China and other Asian countries (Fig. 2d). The first

143

sequence was sampled 12 days after the earliest sampled virus, whose genome became available on

144

December 24, 2019. Multiple matches were found in all sampled continents and detected as late as

145

April 2020 in Europe. These spatiotemporal patterns suggest that proCoV2 already possessed the

146

repertoire of protein sequences needed to infect, spread, and persist in the global human population

147

(see also ref.28). Notably, none of these coronavirus genomes contained widely‐studied Spike protein

148

mutant (D614G), a β mutation that occurred in the genomes carrying all three α variants and was first

149

seen in late January 2020.

150

We then analyzed a later snapshot of SARS‐CoV‐2 genome collection, consisting of genomes obtained

151

from GISAID, acquired three months after the 29KG dataset. This dataset expanded the collection of

152

coronavirus genomes from viral isolates collected after July 7, 2020 (16,739 genomes) and added

153

20,004 genome sequences from viral isolates dated before July 7, 2020. In the expanded MOA analysis,

154

we retained 49 variants found with frequency > 1% in the 29KG dataset and added variants found with

155

a frequency > 1% in the 68KG dataset (84 total variants; see Extended Data Table 2). MOA analysis of

156

the 68KG dataset produced the proCoV2 genome identical to that inferred using the 29KG dataset (see

157

Methods). We found one additional genome with a proCoV2 fingerprint sampled in Hubei, China, four

158

weeks after the Wuhan‐1 strain was reported.

159

The inferred mutation history from the 68KG dataset was well‐supported with high COI and BCLs

160

concordance with the mutation history produced using the 29KG dataset (Fig. 3b). Therefore, all the

161

inferences reported for the 29KG dataset were robust to the expanded sampling of genomes. In the

162

expanded mutation history, two new groups of variants were identified (ζ and η), which originated in

163

mid‐March 2020 and are found in relatively high frequency in the 68KG dataset (~4.4% and 8.0%,

164

respectively; Extended Data Table 2). Variants in ζ and η groups also showed episodic accumulation of

165

mutations, e.g., the count of genomes containing three ζ mutations (ζ1‐ζ3; 2,955 genomes) was much

166

larger than those with a subset of these variants (148 genomes). The episodic nature of mutational

167

spread for 84 variants in the 68KG is statistically significant (P < 10‐8), i.e., clusters of mutations together

168

have become common variants (see Methods).

169

Coronavirus fingerprints and spatiotemporal tracking

170

The progression of mutations in the mutation history directly transforms into a collection of genetic

171

fingerprints or signatures. Each fingerprint represents a genome type containing all the variants on the

172

path from that node up to the progenitor proCoV2. These fingerprints can classify genomes and track

173

spatiotemporal patterns of dominant lineages genomes (see Methods). We use a shorthand to refer to

174

each barcode in which only the major variant type is used. For example, α fingerprint refers to genomes

175

that one or more of the α variants and no other major variants, and αβ fingerprint refers to genomes

176

that contain at least one α, at least one β variant, and no other major variants. This nomenclature is

177

intuitive and provides a way to glean evolutionary information from the coronavirus lineage's name. In

178

the 68KG dataset (October 12, 2020 GISAID snapshot), global frequencies of major proCoV2 fingerprints

179

were αβε (32.1%), αβδ (17.7%), αβ (16.7%), αβεη (9.9%), αβ (9.8%), αβ (6.8%), αβζ (4.5%), and ν

180

(2.4%).

181

Figure 4 shows the evolving spatiotemporal of all major fingerprints in Asia, Europe, and North America

182

inferred for an expanded dataset of 172,480 genomes (December 30, 2020 snapshot). Spatiotemporal

183

patterns in cities, countries, and other regions are available online at http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/.

184

We observe the spread and replacement of prevailing strains in Europe (αβε with αβζ) and Asia (α with

185

αβε), the preponderance of the same strain for most of the pandemic in North America (αβδ), and the

186

continued presence of multiple high‐frequency strains in Asia and North America. Spatiotemporal

187

patterns of strain spread converged for Europe and Asia by July‐August 2020 to αβε genetic fingerprints.

188

These patterns diverged from North America, where αβ along with its mutant (αβδ) were common.

189

After that, Europe saw ζ variants of αβ grow (αβζ), replacing αβε genomes and its new η offshoot (αβεη)

190

(e.g., ref.32). The ζ mutations were first detected three weeks after the sampling of the first ε variants.

191

Remarkably, αβδ has remained the dominant lineage in North America since April 2020, in contrast to

192

the turn‐over seen in Europe and Asia. More recently, novel fast‐spreading variants have been reported

193

(e.g., ref33). In particular, an S protein variant (N501Y) from South Africa and London has rapidly

194

increased33. Coronaviruses with N501Y variant in South Africa carry the αβγδ genetic fingerprint,

195

whereas those in London carry the αβε genetic fingerprint. This means that the N501Y mutation arose

196

independently in two coronavirus lineages that show convergent patterns of increased spread. At

197

present, αβζ dominates the UK, and the number of genomes publicly available from South Africa is

198

relatively small to make reliable inferences at present (see http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org for future

199

updates). Overall, our mutational fingerprinting and nomenclature provides a simple way to glean the

200

ancestry of new variants in contrast to phylogenetic designations (e.g., B.1.350 and B.1.1.733).

201

Conclusions

202

Through innovative analyses of two large collections of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes, we have consistently

203

reconstructed the same progenitor coronavirus genome and identified its presence worldwide for

204

many months after the pandemic began. The progenitor genome is a better reference for rooting

205

phylogenies, orienting mutations, and estimating sequence divergences. The reconstructed mutational

206

history of SARS‐CoV‐2 revealed major mutational fingerprints to identify and track the novel

207

coronavirus's spatiotemporal evolution, revealing convergences and divergences of dominant strains

208

among geographical regions from an analysis of more than 174 thousand genomes.

209

Furthermore, the approach taken here to reconstruct the progenitor genome and discover key

210

mutational events will generally be applicable for analyzing pathogens during the early stages of

211

outbreaks. The approach is scalable for even bigger datasets because it does not require more

212

phylogenetically informative variants with an increasing number of samples. In fact, it benefits from

213

bigger datasets as they afford more accurate estimates of individual and co‐occurrence frequencies of

214

variants and enable more reliable detection of lower frequency variants. Its continued application to

215

SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes and other pathogen outbreaks will produce their ancestral genomes and their

Methods

219

Genome data acquisition and processing

220

We first downloaded 60,332 SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes from the GISAID27 database, along with information

221

on sample collection dates and locations (until July 7, 2020). Of all the genomes downloaded, we only

222

retained those with greater than 28,000 bases and were marked as originating from human hosts and

223

passing controls detailed below. Similarly, the second dataset, the 68KG dataset, was assembled from

224

133,741 genomes and downloaded on October 12, 2020. Again, we retained only those with greater

225

than 28,000 bases and marked as originating from human hosts.

226

Each genome was subjected to codon‐aware alignment with the NCBI reference genome (accession

227

number NC_045512) and then subdivided into ten regions based on CDS features: ORF1a (including

228

nsp10), ORF1b (starting with nsp12), S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, N, and ORF10. Gene ORF7b

229

was removed because it was too short for alignment and comparisons. For each region, we scanned

230

and discarded sequences containing too many ambiguous nucleotides to remove data with too many

231

sequencing errors. Thresholds were 0.5% for the S gene, 0.1% for ORF1a and ORF1b genes, and 1% for

232

all other genes. We mapped individual sequences to the NCBI reference genome (NC_045512) using a

233

codon‐aware

234

(https://github.com/veg/hyphy‐analyses/tree/master/codon‐msa), translated mapped sequence to

235

amino‐acids, and performed multiple protein sequence alignment with the auto settings function of

236

MAFFT (version 7.453)35. Codon sequences were next mapped onto the amino‐acid alignment. The

237

multiple sequence alignment of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes was aligned with the sequence of three closest

238

outgroups, including the coronavirus genomes of the Rhinolophus affinis bat (RaTG13), R. malayanus

239

bat (RmYN02), and Manis javanica pangolin (MT121216.1)36,37. The alignment was visually inspected

240

and adjusted in Geneious Prime 2020.2.2 (https://www.geneious.com). The final alignment contained

241

all genomic regions except ORF7b and non‐coding regions (5' and 3' UTRs, and intergenic spacers). After

242

these filtering and alignment steps, the multiple sequence alignment contained 29,115 sites and 29,681

243

SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes for the July 7, 2020 snapshot, which we refer to as the 29KG dataset. For the

244

October 12 snapshot, there were 68,057 sequences, which we refer to as the 68KG dataset. We also

245

conducted a spatiotemporal analysis on an expanded dataset containing 172,480 genomes (172KG)

246

acquired on December 30, 2020.

247

Reference genomes and collection dates

248

We used the dates of viral collections provided by the GISAID database27 in all our analyses if they were

were excluded from the spatiotemporal analyses and derived interpretations. We noted that the

252

earliest sample included in GISAID (ID: EPI_ISL_402123) was collected on December 24, 2019, although

253

the NCBI website lists its collection date as December 23, 2019 (GenBank ID: MT019529). Therefore,

254

we used the GISAID collection date for the sake of consistency. Regarding the NCBI reference genome

255

(GenBank ID: NC_045512; GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_402125)38, this sample was collected on December 26,

256

201939. We also used the GIS reference genome in our analysis (ID: EPI_ISL_402124), collected on

257

December 30, 201940.

258

Mutation order analyses (MOA)

259

First, we analyzed the 29KG dataset. We used a maximum likelihood method, SCITE 23, and variant co‐

260

occurrence analyses for reconstructing the order of mutations corresponding to 49 common variants

261

(frequency > 1%) observed in this dataset. MOA has demonstrated high accuracy for analyzing tumor

262

cell genomes that reproduce clonally, have frequent sequencing errors, and exhibit limited sequence

263

divergence23,24. In MOA, higher frequency variants are expected to have arisen earlier than low‐

264

frequency variants in clonally reproducing populations23,26. We used the highest frequency variants to

265

anchor the analysis and the shared co‐occurrence of variants among genomes to order mutations while

266

allowing probabilistically for sequencing errors and pooled sequencing of genomes23. MOA is different

267

from traditional phylogenetic approaches where positions are treated independently, i.e., the shared

268

co‐occurrence of variants is not directly utilized in the inference procedure. Notably, both traditional

269

phylogenetic and mutation order analyses are expected to produce concordant patterns when

270

sequencing errors and other artifacts are minimized. However, sequencing errors and limited

271

mutational input during the coronavirus history adversely impact traditional methods, as does the fact

272

that the closest coronaviruses useable as outgroups have more than a thousand base differences from

273

SARS‐CoV‐2 genomes that only differ in a handful of bases from each other7,9,10.

274

MOA requires a binary matrix of presence/absence (1/0) of mutants, which is straightforward in

275

analyzing cell sequences from tumors because they arise from normal cells that supply the definitive

276

ancestral state. To designate mutation orientations for applying MOA in SARS‐CoV‐2 analysis, we

277

devised a simple approach in which we began by comparing nucleotides at the 49 genomic positions

278

among three closely‐related genomes (bat RaTG13, bat RmYN02, and pangolin MT121216.1)41. We

279

chose the consensus base to be the initial reference base, such that SARS‐CoV‐2 genome bases were

280

coded to be “0” whenever they were the same as the consensus base at their respective positions. All

281

other bases were assigned a “1.” There were 39 positions in which all three outgroup genomes were

282

identical to each other and 9 in which two of the outgroups showed the same base. In the remaining

283

position (28657), all three outgroups differed, so we selected the base found in the gene with the

284

highest sequence similarity to the human SARS‐CoV‐2 NCBI reference genome (NC_045512) because

285

SARS‐CoV‐2’s ancestor likely experienced genomic recombination before its zoonotic transfer into

286

humans28,42,43. At one position, both major and minor bases in humans were different from the

9

287

consensus base in the outgroups, so we assigned the mutant status to the minority base (U; vf = 29.8%).

288

All missing and ambiguous bases were coded to be ignored (missing data) in all the analyses.

289

These initially assigned mutation orientations were tested in a subsequent investigation of variants' co‐

290

occurrence index (COI). COI for a given variant (y) is the number of genomes that contain y and its

291

directly preceding mutation (x) in the mutation history, divided by the number of genomes that contain

292

y. When COI was lower than 70%, we reversed each position's mutation orientation individually and

293

selected the mutation orientation that produced mutation histories with the highest COI.

294

In the SCITE analysis of 49 variants and 29,861 genomes, we started with default parameter settings of

295

false‐negative rate (FNR = 0.21545) and false‐positive rate (FPR = 0.0000604) of mutation detection.

296

We carried out five independent runs to ensure stability and convergence to obtain 29KG collection‐

297

specific estimates of FNR and FPR by comparing the observed and predicted sequences based on this

298

mutation graph. The estimated FNR (0.00488) and FPR (0.00800) were very different from the SCITE

299

default parameters, where the estimated FNR was much lower. This difference in error rates is

300

unsurprising because we used only common variants (vf > 1%), and the 29KG dataset was not obtained

301

from single‐cell sequencing in which dropout during single‐cell tumor sequencing elevates FNR, i.e.,

302

mutant alleles are not sequenced.

303

As noted above, the initial mutation orientations were simply the starting designations for our analysis,

304

which are subsequently investigated by evaluating the COI of each variant in the reconstructed

305

mutation history. In this process, we reverse ancestor/mutant coding for variants that received low COI

306

to examine if a mutation history with higher COI can be generated. Two positions (3037 and 28854)

307

received low COI (<70%). At position 3037, the reversed encoding (C→U) received significantly higher

308

COI (100%) than the starting encoding (U→C; 60%), so the position was recoded. At position 28854,

309

the ordering and direction of mutation remained ambiguous despite extensive analyses, but it did not

310

impact the predicted MRCA sequence. Therefore, we only recoded the column for position 3037 and

311

generated a new 49 × 29861 (SNVs × genomes) matrix to conduct a SCITE analysis.

312

At one position (28657), all three outgroup sequences had different bases, so we initially selected the

313

base found in the gene with the highest sequence similarity to the human SARS‐CoV‐2 NCBI reference

314

genome. We next tested if reversed encoding produced a better mutation graph. The reversed

315

encoding produced a mutation graph with a much higher log‐likelihood (−32355.58 and −30289.92, for

316

the initial and reversed encoding, respectively; P ൏൏ 0.01 using the AIC protocol in ref.44). Therefore,

317

we recoded position 28657 and generated a new 49 × 29861 (SNVs × genomes) matrix.

318

It was subjected to SCITE analysis and produced a mutation graph for 49 variants in the 29KG dataset.

319

This graph predicts an FNR of 0.00418 and FPR of 0.00295 per base. Using these new FNR and FPR, we

320

again performed SCITE analysis and produced the final mutation history graph. Starting from the top of

321

a mutation graph, a distinct Greek symbol was assigned to a group of mutations that were occurred

322

sequentially, and variants with similar frequency were assigned the same Greek symbol (μ, ν, α, β, γ, δ,

323

and ε). The high‐frequency variants with the same Greek symbol were distinguished by numbers to
10

324

represent the sequential relationship, e.g., α1 and α2. When an offshoot of a high‐frequency mutation

325

had low variant frequency, we assigned it the same Greek symbol and number to represent the parent‐

326

offspring relationship and further distinguished descendants by adding a small letter, e.g., α1a and α1b.

327

In this mutation graph, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) corresponds to the progenitor that

328

gave rise to ν and α lineages. MRCA is the progenitor of all human SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (proCoV2),

329

which descended from the parental lineage that divergence form and its closest relatives, including bats

330

and pangolins. We estimate that proCoV2 existed 5.8 to 8.1 weeks before December 24, 2019, on which

331

the Wuhan‐1 was sampled, by using SARS‐CoV‐2 HPD mutation rate range of 6.64×10‐4 – 9.27×10‐4

332

substitutions per site per year20. We have made available the proCoV2 genome sequence in FastA

333

format at http://igem.temple.edu/COVID‐19, which is the same as the NCBI reference genome with

334

base differences corresponding to α1 – α3 mutations at positions 18060, 8782, and 28144, as discussed

335

in the main text. In this mutation graph, COI for each variant is shown next to the arrow.

336

Bootstrap analysis

337

We assessed the robustness of the mutation history inference to genome sampling by bootstrap

338

analysis. We generated 100 bootstrap replicate datasets, each built by randomly selecting 29,861

339

genomes with replacement. Then, SCITE was used to infer the mutation graph for each replicate

340

dataset. Bootstrap confidence level, scored for each variant pair, was the number of replicates in which

341

the given pair of variants were directly connected in the mutation history in the same way as shown in

342

figure 1. BCLs were often lower for major variants within groups (e.g., ε1 – ε3) because they occur with

343

very similar frequencies. This feature adversely affected the BCL values of mutation orders between

344

groups, e.g., β and ε. In this case, we considered each group as a single entity. We computed BCL to be

345

the proportion of replicates in which pairs of groups were directly connected in the mutation history in

346

the same way as shown in figure 1. Groups used were β1‐β3, ε1‐ε3, and α1a‐α1d. All of these BCL values

347

are shown with an underline.

348

Temporal concordance

349

Because mutation ordering analysis analyses did not use spatial or temporal information for genomes

350

or mutations, it can be validated by evaluating the concordance of the inferred order of mutations with

351

the timing of their first appearance (tf). Using the genomes for which virus sampling day, month, and

352

year were available, we determined tf for every variant in the 29KG dataset. For a mutation i, we

353

compared its tf(i) with tf(j) such that j is the nearest preceding mutation in the mutation graph. We

354

found that tf(j) ≥ tf (i) for 47 of 49 mutations, except for 3b and 3c pairs. These two offshoot mutants

355

of 3 were sampled 35 days (3b) and 12 days (3c) earlier than their predecessors, which could be due

356

to their low frequency or sequencing error. COI of one variant (3b) was low (54%), but the other variant

357

(3c) had a very high COI (97%).

358

Mutational fingerprints

359

Each node in the mutational history graph predicts an intermediate (ancestral) or a tip sequence,

360

containing all the mutations from that node to the mutation graph's root. The mutational fingerprint is

361

then produced directly from the mutation history graph drawn as a directional graph anchored on the

362

root node. We compared our mutational fingerprints of the genomes in the 29KG dataset with a

363

phylogeny‐based classification1 obtained using the Pangolin service (v2.0.3; https://pangolin.cog‐

364

uk.io/). We assigned each of the 29K genomes to a fingerprint based on the highest sequence similarity

365

at positions containing 49 common variants. Mismatches were allowed, as sequencing errors could

366

create them. A small fraction of genomes (1.8%) could not be assigned unambiguously to one

367

fingerprint, so they were excluded and investigated in the future. The number of genomes assigned to

368

each fingerprint is shown in Extended Data Table 1. We submitted genome sequences to the Pangolin

369

website for classification one‐by‐one, and a clade designation was received. The results are summarized

370

in Extended Data Figure 1. In this table, all phylogenetic‐groups with fewer than 20 genomes were

371

excluded.

372

Of the 80 phylogenetic groups shown, 74 are defined primarily by a single mutation‐based fingerprint,

373

as more than 90% of the genomes in those phylogenetic groups share the same fingerprint. This

374

includes all small and medium‐sized phylogenetic groups (up to 488 genomes) and two large groups

375

(A.1 with 1,377 genomes and B.1.2 with 749 genomes). One large group, B.1.1, predominately connects

376

with ε3 node (79%, 4,832 genomes), but some of its members belong to ε3 offshoots because they

377

contain respective diagnostic mutations. For group B.1.1.1, two other ε3 offshoots are mixed up almost

378

equally. Three other large differences between mutational fingerprint‐based classification and

379

phylogeny‐based grouping are seen for A, B, B1.1, and B.2 groups. These differences are likely because

380

the location of the root and the earliest branching order of coronavirus lineages are problematic in

381

phylogeny‐based classifications7,9,10,14. Overall, our mutational fingerprints are immediately informative

382

about the mutational ancestry of genomes.

383

Analysis of 68KG dataset

384

We repeated the above MOA procedure on the 68KG dataset (68,057 genomes). This 68KG data

385

contained 72 common variants (>1% frequency). For direct comparison purposes, we added 12 variants

386

that were common variants on 29KG data, but their frequency had become less than 1% in the 68KG

387

data. Therefore, we used 84 variants in total and constructed a matrix of 84 × 68,057 (SNVs × genomes)

388

for the SCITE analysis to determine the mutational order. We also conducted the bootstrap analysis

389

and assigned mutational fingerprints using the procedure mentioned above. The number of genomes

390

mapped to each fingerprint is listed in Extended Data Table 2.

391

Spatiotemporal analysis of 172KG dataset

392

We developed a sequence classification protocol that first calls variants in a viral genome using proCoV2

393

as the reference sequence using minimap245. Then, it assigns the sequence to a path in the mutation

394

graph with the highest concordance (Jaccard index). It is implemented in a simple browser‐based tool,

395

which shows the example output for ENA accession number MT675945 (Extended Data Figure 2;

396

http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org). The classification is conducted on the client‐side such that the

397

researcher’s data never leaves their personal computer.

398

Testing episodic spread of variants

399

We performed non‐parametric Wald–Wolfowitz runs‐tests46,47 of the null hypothesis that the first

400

sampling of variants is randomly distributed over time (i.e., evenly spaced). The null hypothesis was

401

rejected for both 29KG and 64KG analysis at P << 0.01, suggesting significant temporally clustering in

402

both 29KG dataset and 64KG datasets. Because many mutations were first sampled on December 24,

403

2019, we only included one mutation for that day to avoid biasing the test.

Fig. 1. Mutational history graph of SARS-CoV-2 from the 29KG dataset. Thick arrows mark the pathway of
widespread variants (frequency, vf ≥ 3%), and thin arrows show paths leading to other common mutations (3% >
vf > 1%). The pie-charts' size is proportional to variant frequency in the 29KG dataset, with pie-charts shown for
variants with vf > 3% and pie color based on the world's region where that mutation was first observed. A circle is
used for all other variants, with the filled color corresponding to the earliest sampling region. The co-occurrence
index (COI, black font) and the bootstrap confidence level (BCL, blue font) of each mutation and its predecessor
mutation are shown next to the arrow connecting them. Underlined BCL values mark variant pairs for which BCLs
were estimated for groups of variants (see Methods) because of the episodic nature of variant accumulation within
groups resulting in lower BCLs (<80%; dashed arrows). Base changes (n.) are shown for synonymous mutations,
and amino acid changes (p.) are shown for nonsynonymous mutations along with the gene/protein names ("ORF"
is omitted from gene name abbreviations given in Extended Data Table 1). More details on each mutation are
presented in Extended Data Table 1.

Fig. 2. Counts of single nucleotide variants (SNVS) and genomes in the 29KG dataset. (a) Cumulative count
of SNVs presented in the 29KG genome dataset at different frequencies. (b) The number of genomes in the 29KG
collection that were isolated weekly during the pandemic. (c) The number of base differences from proCoV2 for
genomes that were sampled in December 2019 and January 2020. The 18 genomes sampled in December 2019
in China (red) have three common SNVs different from proCoV2. In contrast, six genomes sampled in January
2020 in China (Asia, red) and the US (North America, blue) show no base differences. Multiple genomes (2 and
15) were sampled on two different days. (d) Temporal and spatial distribution of strains identical to proCoV2 at the
protein sequence level, i.e., they have only μ mutations. The color scheme used to mark sampling locations is
shown in panel b.

Fig. 3. The backbone of SARS-CoV-2 mutational history. The mutational history inferred was from (a) 29KG
and (b) 68KG datasets. Major variants and their mutational pathways are shown in black, and minor variants and
their mutational pathways are gray. Circle color marks the region where variants were sampled first. The 68KG
dataset contains 12 additional variants and more than two times the genomes than the 29KG dataset.

Fig. 4. Spatiotemporal dynamics of 172,480 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (December 2019-2020). Spatiotemporal
patterns of genomes mapped to lineages containing different combinations of major variants in (a) Asia, (b) Europe,
and (c) North America. The number of genomes mapped to major variant lineages contains all of its offshoots, e.g.,
α lineage contains all the genomes with α1 – α3, α1a – α1d, and α3a – α3j variants only. The stacked graph area is
the proportion of genomes mapped to the corresponding lineage. The solid black line shows the count of total
genome samples. Spatiotemporal patterns in cities, countries, and other regions are available online at

Extended Data Figure 1. A comparison of mutation‐based and phylogeny‐based classifications of 29KG
genomes. Phylogeny‐based classification is obtained by using the Pangolin service (v2.0.3;
https://pangolin.cog‐uk.io/). Only the terminal variants are shown in mutation‐based fingerprints for
convenience. Each cell's value is the number of genomes that belong to the corresponding mutation‐
based and phylogeny‐based groups. All phylogenetic‐based groups with fewer than 20 genomes are
excluded. Cells with fewer than five genomes matching have been left empty to make the comparison
more straightforward and allow for sequencing and estimation errors.

Extended Data Figure 2. An example of sequence classification (ENA Accession MT675945) based on the
84 signature mutations (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/; “Classify your Sequence” option). (a) Input
window to provide identifiers of sequences to be classified (e.g., MT675945). (b) The input sequence is
classified into a mutational fingerprint. A list of mutations that are appeared in the input sequence is
shown in the output window. (c) A waterfall phylogeny shows the input sequence's location in the
phylogeny, which appears after clicking the closet signature matched mutation in panel b.
