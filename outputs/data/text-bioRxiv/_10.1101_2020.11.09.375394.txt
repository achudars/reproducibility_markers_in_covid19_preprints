COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly become a global
health crisis since the first report of infection in December of
2019. However, the infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and its
comprehensive protein-level interactions with hosts remain unclear. There is a massive amount of under-utilized data and
knowledge about RNA viruses highly relevant to SARS-CoV-2
and their hosts’ proteins. More in-depth and more comprehensive analyses of that knowledge and data can shed new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19
pandemic and reveal potential risks. In this work, we constructed a multi-layer virus-host interaction network to incorporate these data and knowledge. A machine learning-based
method, termed Infection Mechanism and Spectrum Prediction
(IMSP), was developed to predict virus-host interactions at both
protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2, which deserved public health attention, and eight highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins. Given a new
virus, IMSP can utilize existing knowledge and data about other
highly relevant viruses to predict multi-scale interactions between the new virus and potential hosts.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), a novel virus causing the COVID-19 disease, was
first reported in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. Since
then, it has quickly become a global health crisis (1) with
over 50 million people infected and 1,250,000 death over
200 countries as of November of 2020 (2). The impact
of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly surpassed previous outbreakings of coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
in 2012. Besides humans, SARS-CoV-2 has also been confirmed to infect several other mammals closely related to human activities, including dogs (3), cats (4), tigers (5), and
golden Syrian hamsters (6). It is important to identify a comprehensive set of such mammals because they can potentially
serve as covert means to exacerbate the spread of COVID-19.
Moreover, identifying interactions between SARS-CoV-2
proteins and host proteins can deepen our understanding of
the viral invasion processes and may help design treatments
and vaccines. In general, we want to promptly achieve the

above two goals for new zoonotic viruses, which we believe
can be done by leveraging the knowledge and data about
known viruses highly relevant to the new ones.
The research community has accumulated a great deal
of knowledge about several other human coronaviruses
(including SARS-CoV (7–15), HCoV-HKU1 (15), HCoVOC43 (16, 17), HCoV-NL63 (18), MERS-CoV (19–23)) and
has collected a large amount of data about them. For example, it was shown that human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the primary host receptor used by the
S protein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 for the virus to gain
entry into human cells (24) (Figure S1). ACE2 is also the
host receptor used by SARS-CoV (14) and HCoV-NL63 (18).
The S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds significantly tighter to
ACE2 than its counterpart in SARS-CoV (25). After the virus
enters host cells, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are essential for a host to defend against viral infection (Figure S2).
This knowledge and data can be utilized to investigate the
infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with
hosts at the protein level. Finally, we built a Virus-Host Interaction Network (VHIN) of seven viruses and seventeen hosts
that summarizes the existing protein-protein interaction (PPI)
and infection relationships among them (Figure 1A, more details in Figures S3, S4 and S5).
We have developed a network-based multi-level virus-host
interaction modeling and prediction, termed Infection Mechanism and Spectrum Prediction (IMSP) (Figure 1B, details
in the Method section), which uses machine learning technique to learn from the constructed VHIN and then predict
novel virus-host interactions at both the protein (i.e., Mechanism) and organism (i.e., Spectrum) levels. IMSP predicts
that the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein can bind well with ACE2
receptors in seven mammalian hosts, which have not been
reported. Among those hosts, five of them are predicted to
have high risks of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, IMSP identifies eight new interactions between SARSCoV-2 proteins and human proteins. To our best knowledge,
our work is the first to apply machine learning techniques for
predicting virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Previous works (26, 27) on predicting virus-host
interactions focus on the relationships between SARS-CoV-2
proteins and human proteins, which ignore other hosts that
might be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

BLAST algorithm provided by NCBI. PPIs and infection relationships are gathered from academic publications (7–23).

its organism. The thickness of a similarity relationship indicates its level of similarity.
For the full network, refer to the viral entry graph (Figure S3), interferon signaling

features of an interaction. The content embedding captures the attributes that reveal biological aspects of an interaction. The representation of each interaction is
derived by concatenating its structural and content embeddings, where S stands for
a structural embedding element, and C stands for a content embedding element.
A Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is trained to classify the relationship between two
nodes into PPI, infection, or no interaction. See the Methods section for calculating the structural and content embeddings. (C) Exemplar predicted interactions are

Results
Here, we explain the construction of our virus-host interaction network in detail, highlight the predicted interactions by
SARS-CoV-2, and present the overall performance evaluation of our interaction prediction model IMSP.
The Virus–Host Interaction Network

The Virus-Host Interaction Network consists of two layers (an organism layer and a protein layer). The organism layer contains a set of viruses (including SARS-CoV-2,
SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43,
HCoV-NL63, and MERS-CoV) and a set of hosts (including
human, mouse, rat, dog, cat, camel, squirrel, cattle, chimpanzee, red junglefowl, rabbit, horse, monkey, rat, sheep,
pig, and golden Syrian hamster). At the protein layer, we
focus on proteins that are known to be involved in viral invasion as well as immune system response and suppression.
The network contains 17 host protein homolog groups obtained from NCBI: ACE2, Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4),
IRF3, IRF7, IRF9, Mitochondrial Anti-Viral-signaling protein (MAVS), Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein

We applied IMSP on SARS-CoV-2 and other six human
coronaviruses to get high-confidence predictions of PPIs and
infections. Figure S1 shows the interactions between S proteins and ACE2. Figure S2 shows the interactions between
virus proteins and IFN proteins in hosts. Figure S3 shows the
network between the host group and the virus group in the
organism layer. The virus-host network’s complete information, built with two layers of data containing 246 nodes and
1,766 interactions, is displayed in Node Table S4 and Interaction Table S5. All 65 infections and 457 PPIs predictions
are shown in Table S6 and S7.
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein Binding Predictions

The ability of SARS-CoV-2’s S-protein to bind to the host
ACE2 receptors is a key factor deciding the infection capability of SARS-CoV-2. IMSP predicts that the S-protein
of SARS-CoV-2 has a high probability of binding well with
the ACE2 receptors in mice, rats, sheep, chimpanzees, cattle,
squirrels, and horses (Figure 2a). Mice and rats have been
recognized to be susceptible to several other human coronaviruses, such as, SARS-CoV (7), MERS-CoV (28), HCoVOC43 (17) and HCoV-HKU1 (29, 30). The chimpanzee has
the ACE2 with 99.38% similarity with human ACE2, which
has a high possibility to bind with the same S-protein. The
overall similarity of ACE2 for the horse, squirrel, sheep, and
cattle is 93.45%, 91.82%, 90.81%, and 90.56% compared to
human ACE2, respectively. These predictions still require
more practical research is required to determine the binding affinity of these mammals’ ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2’s
S-protein. It has been shown that ACE2 can tolerate up to
seven amino acids changes out of 20 critical ones that contact
with the S-protein, without losing the functionality as SARSCoV-2’s receptor (31). This means that similarity might not
be the only factor that influences the binding affinity between
ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2’s S-protein.
SARS-CoV-2 and human interferon pathway interactome
prediction

The Interferon (IFN) pathway plays a critical role in the human immune response. After the virus infection is detected,
the innate immune system will induce the IFN signaling, and

the expression of IFN genes will increase the cellular resistance to viral invasion. Viruses have developed various strategies to inhibit IFN signaling to facilitate a successful viral
invasion (32). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been studied quite comprehensively in counteracting the IFN signaling
responses compared with SARS-CoV-2. From IMSP, eight
interactions between three SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human
proteins in the innate immune pathway have been identified,
shown in Figure 2(b)-(d). These interactions have a high
probability of playing crucial roles in the SARS-CoV-2’s suppression of the host’s innate immune system.
PLpro was predicted to interact with the nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NF-κB) in humans, shown in Figure 2(b). In SARS-CoV (33) and MERSCoV (34), PLpro have been identified as being capable of
reducing the NF-κB reporter activity and further suppressing
IRF3. From our prediction, it might also be highly possible
for SARS-CoV-2’s PLpro to have similar functions.
ORF6 and nsp15 in SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered as
crucial viral interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV-2. These
two proteins inhibit the localization of IRF3 by interacting
with RIG-I (35), as a similar function is found for SARS-CoV
ORF6 (36), shown in Figure 2(c)&(d). ORF6 in SARS-CoV
has also been shown to interact with STAT1 and STAT2 (37).
From IMSP’s prediction, ORF6 and nsp15 in SARS-CoV2 were suggested to have potential interactions with MDA5
and MAVS. Since MAVS works as the adaptor molecule for
MDA5 (38), it is possible that a viral protein interacts with either one of these two would also have the interaction with the
other. Besides, MAVS and MDA5, ORF6 was also predicted
to interact with STAT1 and STAT2, the same function as in
the SARS-CoV. As nsp15 and ORF6 both function in nuclear
transport machinery after the viral entry (26), it is reasonable
that, for these two proteins, similar interactions with innate
immune pathways are predicted. Careful experiments should
be conducted to identify nsp15 and ORF6’s impact on the
innate immune system.
SARS-CoV-2 infection prediction

Based on the protein-level interaction prediction, we concluded five predicted infections for SARS-CoV-2 that is
highly possible, as these mammals are not only predicted to
be infected but also to have a successful SARS-CoV-2 virus
binding with the host receptors. As shown in Figure 3, these

animals include mice, rats, sheep, cattle, and squirrels.
Mice and rats are similar in every protein that we took
into consideration in IMSP: all of the proteins have above
85% similarity, and the receptor ACE2 even has 94% similarity. Mouse has been identified as a host for all betacoronaviruses: SASR-CoV (7), MERS-CoV (28), HCoVOC43 (17) and HCoV-HKU1 (29, 30). SARS-CoV-2 also
falls into the category of beta-coronavirus (39), which has a
high possibility to infect mice and rats.
Cattle are hosts for both MERS-CoV (21) and a bovine
coronavirus which is exceptionally similar to HCoV-OC43
(over 94% similarity) (16). This means that cattle can be the
host for other coronaviruses. Cattle, along with sheep and
squirrels, are closely related to the human living environment
or daily diet. They could be potential mammalian hosts that
again transmit the virus back to human society. The investigation of these highly possible infections could help identify
the virus’s path and further control the transmission SARSCoV-2 from mammalian hosts. Further research on these potential hosts might be crucial to social health and safety.

Fig. 4. Performance on PPI and Infection Predictions. This figure demonstrates IMSP’s performance on PPI and infection predictions in comparison with five other models.
The ocean-blue columns represent the performance of our IMSP model derived from the average of 30 independent runs. As a result, the IMSP model achieved 0.808 for
the Infection F1-score and 0.910 for the PPI F1-score. Compared to other models, our model outperformed other models in all the evaluation metrics. Specifically, in terms
of infection F1-score, our model outperformed the second-best model SDNE (44) by 14.9%. In terms of PPI F1-score. Our model also surpassed the second-best model

conducted 30 runs in total for the experiment. The baseline models include two famous random-walk based models
(Deepwalk (41) and Node2vec (43)), two neural-networkbased models (Large-scale Information Network Embedding (LINE) (42) and Structural Deep Network Embedding
(SDNE) (44)), and a classical matrix-based model, Graph
Factorization (GF) (40). In each cross-validation run, we reserved 20% of each interaction type as the positive test set
while ensuring the remaining network to be a connected one.
To ensure input balance, we collected negative interactions
(unconnected node pairs) to match the number of positive interactions in both training and testing sets. Firstly, we extracted known negative interactions as true negatives, which
consisted of spike-receptor interactions that were demonstrated as not existed, such as between SARS-CoV-2’s Sprotein and the host receptor DPP4 (the target host receptor of MERS-CoV). We split known negative interactions by
a ratio of 8:2 to add to the training and testing sets. Then,
since we still lack some number of negative interactions in
both sets, we randomly selected unconnected node pairs as
negative interactions to add to the training and testing sets.
In this way, we confirmed that the training set’s composition was the same as the test set’s composition in terms of
interaction type. We then applied IMSP and other models
on the training set to perform network learning on the same

training set and measure the test set’s interaction prediction
performances. We repeated the entire measurement process
for 30 runs to minimize the measurement randomness. Finally, we performed two-sample heteroscedastic T-test at the
0.01 significance level to test the significance of our model’s
performance improvement compared to other models.
Table 1 shows the performance comparison, measured in
several commonly used evaluation metrics, between IMSP
and other existing tools. IMSP achieved an overall interaction prediction accuracy of 94.9% with a standard deviation
of 0.004, which demonstrated a 6.0% gain compared to the
second-best model. Our model also excelled in its weighted
F1-score, achieving 0.944 with a standard deviation of 0.008,
which transcended the second-best model by 7.3%. The pvalues for these two metrics were all smaller than 0.01, which
indicated significant improvement for our model. In terms
of the performance on specific types of interactions, i.e., infection and PPI predictions (See Fig. 4), IMSP achieved an
F1-score of 0.808 with 0.119 standard deviation for infection
predictions, a 14.9% increase compared to the second-best
model. The p-value was also smaller than 0.01, indicating a
significant improvement in our model. For PPI predictions,
our model achieved an F1-score of 0.909 with 0.029 standard deviation, a 6.6% increment compared to the secondbest tool. The p-value also demonstrated a significant im-

performance measurement, we generated two independent sets, training and testing sets, from the network. We set the ratio between the training and the test set to be

(unconnected node pairs) to correspondingly match the number of positive interactions in both training and testing sets. Part of negative samples was extracted from known
negative interactions (true negatives), which consisted of spike-receptor interactions that were demonstrated as not existed. The remaining part of negative samples was
randomly selected from other unconnected node pairs which were assumed as not existed. To eliminate performance randomness, we executed the comparison algorithm by
30 runs and recorded each run’s performance. We generated new training and test sets during each run and evaluated all models on the same test set. Then, we performed
two-sample heteroscedastic T-tests for these six overall performance evaluation metrics to test the significance of IMSP’s improvement. Lastly, we reported the average with

provement for IMSP. In conclusion, our model showed statistically significant improvements compared to all existing
models in all 12 evaluation metrics.
IMSP’s high performance might result from its ability
to take full advantage of well-studied knowledge and data
from previous biology research with protein-level variations
being considered. Thanks to our virus-host interaction network’s novel design, such cross-organism information and
multi-class linkage information can be well-preserved. Another reason behind IMSP’s performance improvement is that
it factors essential biological metadata as textualized features for nodes. In this way, two connected nodes’ vectorized content substantially helps the classifier output a correct predicted class when formulating interaction representations. However, around 10% PPI predictions were unlikely
by our definition, such as PPIs between S-protein and nonreceptor proteins. To minimize unlikely predictions, we incorporated the node’s function and existing biological metadata as part of the node feature. This change significantly
reduced unlikely PPI predictions to around 2%. We further
pushed the boundaries by utilizing known negative interactions in the protein layer to constitute part of the training and
testing sets—this finally reduced the unlikely PPI predictions
to less than 1%.
In conclusion, IMSP exhibited robust and stable performance in both top-level and detailed evaluation metrics,
which is substantially improved compared to existing tools.
When analyzing newly emerged viruses with limited available information, namely SARS-CoV-2, IMSP can provide
reasonable and reliable predictions.

Discussion
This study assembled 246 nodes (viruses, virus proteins,
hosts, and host proteins) and 1,766 known interactions among
these nodes, including four types of interactions: similarities,
infections, interactions, and belongings. Two main parts for
virus-host protein-level interactions were taken into consideration: viral entry and innate immune pathway interactions.
Accompanied by these two parts, we predicted the potential host for viruses and undiscovered novel PPIs. Among
seven human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
were well studied about their binding with the receptors and
interacting with the innate immune pathway, whereas HCoVOC43, HCoV-NL63, HCov-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and newly
emerged SARS-CoV-2 remained relatively unknown. Based
on protein similarity and known interactions, 322 PPIs were
predicted with this model. The actual PPIs need to be investigated further based on the prediction result.
Established discoveries about SARS-CoV-2’s viral interaction with host proteins are scarce. SARS-CoV-2 has been
highly suspected of suppressing the innate immune response
and reducing the production of IFN. In this way, IMSP’s findings could help discover the relations between virus invasion
and host response and therefore provide clues to developing
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.
More broadly, IMSP could be applied to any other analysis
of the virus-host interaction network predictions. This netH. Du & F. Chen et al.

work would be built based on the information of the proteinprotein relations, protein-host relations, and host-host relations. Based on these attributes in the network and currently
known relationships between some of the proteins, IMSP
could predict the high-possibility interactions. We hope to
use this pipeline as a tool to build a guideline for investigating various similar viruses and their mechanisms with hosts.

Methods
Infection Mechanism and Spectrum Prediction

Our IMSP model requests three different inputs, including
pairwise similarity matrices for all host proteins and virus
proteins, a set of known PPIs and infection relationships, and
proteins’ biological metadata. For instance, appropriate protein metadata can include a protein’s name, layer, host, and
function. Given these three inputs, the model constructs a
virus-host interaction network. Then, in the network learning
phase, IMSP learns and combines the structural information
and the content information of interactions to represent the
heterogeneous network comprehensively. Lastly, in the prediction phase, IMSP trains a neural-network-based classifier,
Multi-layer Perceptron classifier, along with strict filtering
procedures, to output high-possibility undiscovered interactions. Specifically, our model generated PPI and infection
predictions with each prediction’s likelihood. In the following, we elaborated on the details of our IMSP model’s two
main steps in terms of network construction and learning, and
interaction prediction with result validation.
Virus-host interaction network construction and
learning

We utilized layers and groups to mark and separate different nodes during virus-host interaction network construction, and used interactions to represent
PPI/infection/similarity/belonging relationship between
nodes. For modeling the network, we constructed a weighted
and undirected heterogeneous network using NetworkX (45).
The network contained four groups of nodes: host, host
proteins, virus proteins, and virus. We organize the virus
group and the host group into the same layer, i.e., the
organism layer, and we put two groups of proteins into the
protein layer. By nature, the network contained four types
of interactions: PPI (between virus proteins groups and
host proteins groups), infection (between viruses group and
hosts group), similarity (between homologs of proteins) and

belonging (between organism layer and protein layer). Similarity and belonging relationships were innately connected.
Other types of interactions were connected based on proven
molecular level knowledge from existing research (7–23).
The virus-host interaction network comprised of 246 nodes
and 1,766 interactions. After the network structure was built,
we used Wi,j to represent the biological closeness between
Vi and Vj . Specifically, if Ii,j denoted the relationship
between two protein homologs, we used the full-sequence
similarity between Vi and Vj from pairwise similarity
matrices to represent Wi,j . For other types of relationship,
we obtained the embeddings of node content, denoted as RiC
for Vi by passing textualized node content to the Word2vec
model (46), a famous and powerful neural-network-based
word embedding model. Then, we utilized the TS-SS similarity metric (47), a robust and reliable similarity measurement
in the field of textual mining, to calculate the similarity
between RiC and RjC to assign to Wi,j . Precisely, for
interactions other than similarity relations, we calculated the
T S-SSi,j for all i and j if Ii,j ⊂ E as the following:
T S-SSi,j = (|RiC | · |RjC | · sin(θ0 ) · θ0 · π·
(ED(RiC , RjC ) + M D(RiC , RjC ))2 /720,

where M D(RiC , RjC ) (47) is defined as the magnitude difference between RiC and RjC , which is calculated as:

For network learning, we captured the network’s heterogeneity by adding the network’s heterogeneous content information to its structural information. Specifically, we performed network structural embedding assuming the network
is homogeneous. Then, we added the content embedding on
top of structural embedding to model its heterogeneity.
Firstly, for network structural embedding, we used a powerful network feature learning model, Node2vec (43), to learn
the structural embedding for nodes. Node2vec is a stateof-the-art model for homogeneous network embedding. We
took full advantage of Node2vec’s biased searching algorithm during our application. Precisely, the Node2vec model
performed a fixed-length random walk for sampling, which
takes weight into account. Let cm denote the m-th node in

where dVt ,Vi denotes the shortest path between Vi and Vj ,
assuming that we have just traversed from Vt to Vi and are
now evaluating the transition probability leaving Vi .
In Eq. (6), p and q are Node2vec’s hyperparameters that
can be adjusted to influence the probability to go back to Vi
after visiting Vj and the probability to explore undiscovered
components of the network. In this way, we were able to finetune the structural embedding model, Node2vec, to generate
a conclusive embedding for our network.
Secondly, to create content representations, CEi,j for all
Ii,j in the network, we combined the textualized node content of Vi and Vj along with expected interaction type such
as interacts/infects/similar/belongs, and input them into the
Word2vec model (46) to generate vectorized interaction representations. Then, the full interaction representations for interaction Ii,j are formulated as follows:

IEj,i = [RjS , RiS , CEj,i ].

Note that θ0 is increased by 10 degrees to overcome the problem of overlapping vectors. Then, Wi,j is calculated as:
Wi,j = σ(T S-SSi,j /T S-SS),

where m > 1, Z is the normalizing constant, and πVj ,Vi
is the unnormalized transition probability between Vi and
Vj , which is calculated as πVj ,Vi = αpq (Vt , Vi ) · Wi,j .
αpq (Vt , Vi ), termed as search bias, is calculated as:

1/p if dVt ,Vi = 0

if dVt ,Vi = 1 ,
αpq (Vt , Vi )) =


1/q if dVt ,Vi = 2

IEi,j = [RiS , RjS , CEi,j ],

and θ0 is defined as:
θ0 = cos−1 (cos(RiC , RjC )) + 10.

walk with c0 denoting the starting node of the current random
walk. Nodes cm are generated by the following distribution:

πVj ,Vi /Z if Ii,j ⊂ E
P (cm = Vi | cm−1 = Vj ) =
, (5)
0
otherwise

(7)

Note that by Word2vec’s nature, the input documents’ order
does not affect its output, meaning that CEi,j is the same
as CEj,i . By finishing this step, we obtained all interaction
representations, IEi,j , for all Vi and Vj ⊂ V and i 6= j.
Virus-host interaction prediction

In the interaction prediction phase, we utilized a classifier to perform a multi-class classification task on the interaction representations to learn from the existing network
and suggest potential undiscovered interactions. Specifically,
for all Ii,j 6⊂ E, we classified IEi,j into three classes, i.e.
PPI/infections/no-interaction. Scikit-learn’s Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classification model (48) was used for this
multi-class interaction classification.
We conducted cross-validation experiments to fine-tune the
model, where 20% of each interaction type was reserved as a
positive test set. In this process, we also balanced the test set
by inserting an equal number of negative interactions containing both known negatives and unknown negatives. Specifically, known negative interactions (true negatives) were generated from proven unconnected node pairs, such as the interaction between MERS-CoV’s S-protein and mammalian
hosts’ ACE2 receptors. Unknown negative interactions were
randomly sampled from the network, which was assumed as

not existing. Then, by using the fine-tuned hyperparameters
from cross-validation experiments, all positive interactions
with an equal number of negative interactions were used for
training the classifier. IMSP later took all other unused unconnected node pairs as input data and classified them into
the class of PPI/infection/no interaction.
During prediction result correction, we defined rules from
both computational and biological perspectives to mark and
remove unlikely predictions. Computationally, because there
exist two representations for Ii,j , i.e., IEi,j and IEj,i , we
defined the prediction for Ii,j as a strong one if and only if
IEi,j and IEj,i were all classified into the same type of interaction other than the no-interaction. Biologically, we assumed that each virus’s S-protein only interacts/binds with
its target receptor. Thus, all other interactions with S-protein
are considered unlikely. For example, the predicted interaction, if any, between SARS-CoV-2’s S-protein and DPP4 (the
target receptor for MERS-CoV’s S-protein) would be eliminated. Thirdly, we also defined that an infection interaction
was likely only when the corresponding interaction between
the virus’ S-protein and an appropriate host receptor was predicted. In this way, we ensured that all the remaining predictions are both computationally and biologically meaningful
and practically useful to guide further research.
