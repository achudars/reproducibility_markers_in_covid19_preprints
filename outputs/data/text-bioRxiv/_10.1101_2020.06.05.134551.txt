Abstract
COVID-19 is an ongoing global crisis in which the development of effective vaccines and
therapeutics will depend critically on understanding the natural immunity to the virus, including
the role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. We have conducted a study of 42 patients following
recovery from COVID-19, including 28 mild and 14 severe cases, comparing their T cell
responses to those of 16 control donors. We assessed the immune memory of T cell
responses using IFNγ based assays with overlapping peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 apart
from ORF1. We found the breadth, magnitude and frequency of memory T cell responses from
COVID-19 were significantly higher in severe compared to mild COVID-19 cases, and this
effect was most marked in response to spike, membrane, and ORF3a proteins. Total and
spike-specific T cell responses correlated with the anti-Spike, anti-Receptor Binding Domain
(RBD) as well as anti-Nucleoprotein (NP) endpoint antibody titre (p<0.001, <0.001 and
=0.002). We identified 39 separate peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ epitopes, which
strikingly included six immunodominant epitope clusters targeted by T cells in many donors,
including 3 clusters in spike (recognised by 29%, 24%, 18% donors), two in the membrane
protein (M, 32%, 47%) and one in the nucleoprotein (Np, 35%). CD8+ responses were further
defined for their HLA restriction, including B*4001-restricted T cells showing central memory
and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher frequencies of multi-cytokine producing
M- and NP-specific CD8+ T cells than spike-specific CD8+ T cells were observed. They
furthermore showed a higher ratio of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ to CD4+ T cell responses.
Immunodominant epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this
study will provide critical tools to study the role of virus-specific T cells in control and resolution
of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of T cell specificity and functionality associated
with milder disease, highlights the potential importance of including non-spike proteins within
future COVID-19 vaccine design.

Introduction
COVID-19 is caused by a recently emerged RNA beta coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whilst the majority of COVID-19 infections are
relatively mild, with recovery typically within two to three weeks

1, 2

, a significant number of

patients develop severe, often fatal illness, which is postulated to be related to both an
overactive immune response and viral induced lung pathology

3, 4

. The role of adaptive T cell

immune responses in disease pathogenesis and longer-term protective immunity is currently
poorly defined but essential to inform potential therapeutic interventions and enhance vaccine
design.
Currently, there are several ongoing vaccine trials, but uncertainties abound and it is unknown
whether they will provide long lasting protective immunity. Most vaccines are aimed to induce
humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but it is not yet known if this will be
sufficient to induce full protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. A recent study assessed the
immune response induced by an adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, encoding
the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and showed protection from SARS-CoV-2-associated
pneumonia in rhesus macaques, but without inducing sterilising immunity 5. A similar
observation was also made by Yu et al when using a DNA vaccine candidate expressing
different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in a rhesus macaque model6. Another
study from China in humans assessed safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a
recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine, which induced both T cell
responses and neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 specifically7. Studying natural
immunity to the virus, especially the role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is critical to fill the
current knowledge gaps for improved vaccine design.
For primary virus infection, it typically takes 7-10 days for adaptive T cell immune responses
to be primed and expanded in order to control the virus8. This coincides with the typical period
of time in which COVID-19 patients to either recover or develop severe illness. There is a
median incubation time of 4-7 days in patients before patients developing symptoms and a
further 7-10 days before a minority cases progress to severe disease requiring intensive care
unit admission and/or mechanical ventilation occurs in a minority of cases 9. Such a pattern of
progression raises the possibility that relative immunosuppression contributes to SARS-CoV2 viral persistence and COVID-19 mortality, whereas adaptive immune responses are usually
protective in the majority of the population.

While T cells are not thought to prevent the establishment of infection, there is good evidence
in mice and humans that T cells provide partial protection against many acute viral infections,
such as influenza, by promoting viral clearance and reducing the severity of symptoms

1, 10

.

Single cell analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients revealed
clonal expansions of CD8+ T cells in mild but not severe patients, suggesting that the presence
of adaptive T cell responses may be protective in SARS-CoV-2 infection 11.
Evidence supporting a role for T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis is currently incomplete and
conflicting. Some reports indicate that an overreaction of T cells with high cytotoxicity that
causes lung injury3 rather than a lack of a T cell response; one post-mortem study suggested
that direct infection of ACE2-expressing macrophages could lead to activation-induced T cell
death (AICD)12. In contrast a lack of functional T cells may also contribute to severe disease
since lymphocytopenia in COVID-19 patients, especially in older and critically ill cases, may
be the cause of functional exhaustion13.
To date there have been few studies analysing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses and
their role in disease progression 14. Using HLA-class I and II predicted “Mega” peptide pools,
Grifoni et al evaluated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in non-hospitalised convalescent
subjects. They found all recovered subjects established CD4+ responses and 70% established
CD8+ memory responses to SARS-CoV-215. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses
were also frequently observed in unexposed subjects in their study, suggesting the possibility
of pre-existing cross-reactive immune memory to seasonal coronaviruses.
In the present study, the overall and immunodominant SARS-CoV-2–specific memory T cell
response in subjects who had recovered from COVID-19 were evaluated ex vivo using
overlapping peptides spanning the full proteome of the SARS-CoV-2, excepting only ORF-1.
Potential epitopes were identified using two-dimensional matrix peptide pools and further
evaluated for CD4+ and CD8+ subset involvement. The function of SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cells specific for dominant T cell responses were evaluated by intracellular cytokine production
profiles, and the HLA restriction of the dominant CD8+ T cell responses was defined using ex
vivo and in vitro cultured short-term T cell lines. Broad, and frequently strong, SARS-CoV-2
specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were seen in the majority of convalescent patients,
with a greater proportion of CD8+ T cell responses in mild cases, together with higher
frequencies of multi-cytokine producing M- and NP-specific CD8+ T cells.

Materials and methods
Patients were recruited from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK, between March and
May 2020 by identification of patients hospitalised during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic and
recruited into the Sepsis Immunomics and ISARIC Clinical Characterisation Protocols.
Patients were sampled at least 28 days from the start of their symptoms. Unexposed healthy
adult donor samples were used from unrelated studies undertaken between 2017-early 2019,
and from sero-negative individuals in 2020. Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients.
Clinical definitions
All patients were confirmed to have a test positive for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from an upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab tested
in accredited laboratories. The degree of severity was identified as mild, severe or
critical infection according to recommendations from the World Health Organisation. Severe
infection was defined as COVID-19 confirmed patients with one of the following conditions:
respiratory distress with RR>30/min; blood oxygen saturation<93%; arterial oxygen partial
pressure (PaO2) / fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) <300mmHg; and critical infection was defined
as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or shock; or other organ failures
requiring admission to ICU. Since the Severe classification could potentially include individuals
spanning a wide spectrum of disease severity spanning patients receiving nasal cannula
through to non-invasive ventilation we also calculated the SaO2/FiO2 ratio at the height of
patient illness as a quantitative marker of lung damage. This was calculated by dividing the
oxygen saturation (as determined using a bedside pulse oximeter) by the fraction of inspired
oxygen (21% for ambient air, 24% for nasal cannulae, 28% for simple face masks and 28, 35,
40 or 60% for Venturi face masks or precise measurements for non-invasive or invasive
ventilation settings).
Synthetic peptides
A total of 423 15- to 18-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acid residues and spanning the
full proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 except ORF-1 (253 spike, 29 M, 9 E, 35 ORF3a, 7ORF6,
15 ORF7a, 16 ORF8, 59 NP) were designed using the Los Alamos National Library webbased software PeptGen (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/PEPTGEN/peptgen.html)
and synthesized (purity >75%; Proimmune).

A set of previously defined 27 SARS epitopes

16

were also synthesised (Table 2), and 19

tetramer and pentamers with those peptides in complex with appropriate Class I and II HLAs
were provided by Proimmune.
Pools of Cytomegalovirus (CMV),Epstein-Barr cirus (EBV) and influenza virus specific
epitope peptides and The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) gag were also used as
positive and negative controls.
2-dimensional peptide matrix system
The overlapping peptides spanning the SARS-CoV-2 were assigned into a 2-dimensional
matrix system in which each peptide was represented in 2 different peptide pools. Each
peptide pool contains no more than 16 individual peptides. The first dimension of the peptide
matrix system was designed so that peptides from different source proteins were separated
into different pools. (Supplemental Table 1).
Ex vivo ELISpot assay
IFN-γ ELISpot assays were performed using either freshly isolated or cryopreserved PBMCs
as described previously. No significant difference was observed between responses
generated by fresh or cryopreserved PBMCs as described previously17, 18.
Overlapping peptides were pooled such that the final concentration of each peptide used was
2 μg/mL and then added to 200,000 PBMCs per test for 16–18 h. To quantify antigen-specific
responses, mean spots of the control wells were subtracted from the positive wells, and the
results expressed as spot forming units (SFU)/106 PBMCs. Responses were considered
positive if results were at least three times the mean of the negative control wells and >25
SFU/106PBMCs. If negative control wells had >30 SFU/106 PBMCs or positive control wells
(PHA stimulation) were negative, the results were excluded from further analysis.
Determination of plasma binding to trimeric spike, RBD and NP by ELISA
MAXISORP immunoplates (442404; NUNC) were coated with 0.125 ug of StrepMAB-Classic
(2-1507-001;iba) , blocked with 2% skimmed milk in PBS for one hour and then incubated with
50 ul of 5 ug/ml soluble trimeric Spike 2 ug/ml or 2% skim milk in PBS. After one hour, 50 μL
of serial two-fold dilutions of plasma, from 1:50 to 1:51200 in PBS containing 2% skimmed
milk were added followed by ALP-conjugated anti-human IgG (A9544; Sigma) at 1:10,000
dilution. The reaction was developed by the addition of PNPP substrate and stopped with
NaOH. The absorbance was measured at 405nm. Endpoint titers (EPTs) were defined as
reciprocal plasma dilutions that corresponded to two times the average OD values obtained
with mock. To determine EPTs to RBD and NP, immunoplates were coated with 0.125ug of

Tetra-His antibody (34670; QIAGEN) followed by 2 ug/ml and 5 ug/ml of soluble RBD and NP,
respectively.
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) based T-Cell Assay
Confirmed epitope-containing peptides and positive peptide pools were characterized
further for their CD4+ and CD8+ subset involvement and cytokine production pattern by
intracellular cytokine staining as described previously19, 20 . Briefly, cryopreserved PBMCs
were thawed and rested overnight in R10 at 37oC. On the second day, the PBMCs were
stimulated with pooled or individual peptides at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL per individual
peptide for 1 h in the presence of 2 μg/mL monoclonal antibodies against human CD28 (BD
Pharmingen) and CD49d (BD Pharmingen) then for an additional 5h with GolgiPlug (brefeldin
A, BD), GolgiStop (monensin, BD) and surface stained with PE-anti-CD107a (BD Biosciences).
For the FACS staining, dead cells were first labelled using LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead
Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen). Finally, surface markers including BUV395-anti-CD3 (BD
Biosciences), BUV737-anti-CD4 (BD Biosciences), PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-CD8 (BD Biosciences),
BV510-anti-CD14

(Biolegend),

BV510-anti-CD16

(Biolegend)

and

BV510-anti-CD19

(Biolegend) were stained. Cells were then washed, fixed with Cytofix/CytopermTM (BD
Biosciences) and stained with PE-Cy7-anti-IFNγ (BD Biosciences), APC-anti-TNFα
(eBioscience), BV421-anti-I-L2 (Biolegend). Negative controls with no peptide stimulation
were run in parallel for each sample. Cytokine responses were background subtracted. All
samples were acquired on BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and analyzed
using FlowJoTM v.10 software for Mac (Becton, Dickinson and Company; 2019). To determine
the frequency of different response patterns based on all possible combinations, Boolean gate
were created using IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2. The frequency of responding cells in the negative
control (anti-CD28/anti-CD49d) were subtracted from that in the stimulated samples for each
response individually prior to further analysis. Those which yielding negative values were set
to 0.
Pentamer phenotyping
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed as described above. A total of 1 × 106 live PBMCs were
labeled with peptide-MHC class I pentamer-PE (Proimmune, UK) and incubated for 15 min at
37°C. Dead cells were first labelled for FACS analysis using LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead
Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) and with CD3-BUV395, CD8-PerCP.Cy5.5 as well as a panel of
antibodies for dumping, cell activation, differentiation and inhibitory markers : CD14-BV510
(Biolegend UK), CD16-BV510 (Biolegend UK), CD19-BV510 (Biolegend UK), CD28-BV711,
CD27-APC-R700, HLA-DR-BB515, CD38-BUV737, CD45RA-APC-H7, PD-1-BV650, CD57BV785 (Biolegend, UK) and NKG2A (R&D). Cells were then permeabilized with Perm/fix (BD,

Oxford, UK) for 15 min and washed twice with 1× perm/washing buffer (BD) before being
stained with Ki-67-BV421 and GranzymeB-PE-Cy7 (Biolegend, UK). Cells were subsequently
washed twice with 1× perm/washing buffer and fixed in BD cellfix (BD Bioscience). All
antibodies were from Becton Dickinson (BD, Oxford, UK) unless otherwise stated. Cell events
were acquired on Fortessa X20 (BD Bioscience) and data files were analyzed using FlowJo
software. Data were analyzed using a forward side scatter single cell gate followed by CD8
gating, then tetramer gating within the CD8+ population. These cells were then analyzed for
percentage expression of a particular marker using unstained and overall CD8+ populations
to determine where to place the gates. Single-color samples were run for compensation, and
fluorescence minus one (FMO) control samples were also applied to determine positive and
negative populations, as well as channel spillover.
Generating short-term T cell lines
Short-term SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell lines were established as previously described
6

18

.

Briefly, 3 × 10 to 5 × 10 PBMCs were pulsed as a pellet for 1 h at 37°C with 10 μM of peptides
containing T cell epitope regions and cultured in R10 at 2 × 106 cells per well in a 24-well
Costar plate. IL-2 was added to a final concentration of 100 U/ml on day 3.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and figures were made with
GraphPad Prism 8. Chi-square tests were used to compare ratio difference between two
groups. After testing for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Independent-samples t test
or Mann-Whitney U test was employed to compare variables between two groups.
Correlations were

performed via Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Statistical

significance was set at P<0.05 and all tests were 2-tailed.

Results:
Study subjects
42 individuals were recruited following recovery from COVID-19, including 28 mild cases and
14 severe cases. In addition, 19 control individuals sampled in the pre-COVID-19 season were
studied in parallel.

Supplementary Figure 1 shows the participant characteristics.

No

significant differences in gender or age were noted between mild and severe groups. The
SaO2/FiO2 ratio in severe cases ranged from 4.3 (where 4.5 would be the estimate for an
individual with mild disease breathing ambient air) to 1.6 with the patients with critical disease
having an estimate of 0.8 (median in severe group 3.8).

Ex vivo assessment of memory T cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-2
PBMCs were tested for responses to a panel of 423 overlapping peptides spanning all SARSCoV-2 proteomes except ORF1 using ex vivo IFN-γ ELISpot assays. All overlapping peptides
were placed into two 2-dimensional peptide matrix systems as described in Supplementary
Table 1.

The majority of the participants exhibited SARS-CoV-2 memory T cell responses to at least
one of the peptides. The overall distribution, magnitude and breadth of the IFN-γ responses
against all SARS-CoV-2 virus protein peptides are shown in Figure 1. There is no correlation
between the T cell responses and days post symptom development when sampled
(Supplementary Figure 2). We did not detect any IFNγ-producing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell
responses in unexposed healthy volunteers, but were able to detect EBV, CMV and influenza
virus specific T cell responses using pools of known T cell epitopes as controls. The breadth
and magnitude of the T cell responses varied considerably between individuals. T cell
responses were detected against epitopes distributed across a wide variety of virus proteins.
A significantly higher magnitude (p=0.002) and broader breadth (p=0.010) overall T cell
responses were observed in severe cases in comparison with mild cases, in particular
responses to spike (magnitude/breadth, p=0.021/0.017), membrane (magnitude/breadth,
p<0.001/p=0.045), ORF3 (magnitude/breadth, p<0.001/0.001) and ORF8 (magnitude/breadth,
p=0.011/0.026) proteins (Figure 2).
Correlation with spike specific antibody responses
We have assessed the relationship between spike-specific, and overall T cell responses in
association with spike-specific, RBD and NP antibody endpoint titres (EPTs). We found

significant correlations between (a) spike-specific antibody titers and both overall T cell
responses (p<0.001/R=0.52) and spike-specific T cell responses (p=0.001/R= 0.51); (b) RBDspecific antibody titers and both overall T cell responses (p<0.001/R=0.52) and spike-specific
T cell responses (p<0.001/R=0.52); and (c) NP-specific antibody titers and both overall T cell
responses (p=0.002/R=0.47) and spike-specific T cell responses (p=0.007/R=0.41). However,
there was no significant association between NP-specific antibody titers and NP-specific T cell
responses (p=0.067/R= 0.29); (Figure 3A-C; and Supplementary Figure 4). Moreover,
significantly higher level of spike, RBD and NP EPTs were observed in severe cases in
comparison with mild cases (Figure 3D).
Distribution of SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell responses
Having identified overall T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, the responses detected
against positive peptide pools were characterized further for involvement of CD4+ or CD8+ T
cell subsets in peptide recognition by evaluating specific intracellular production of IFN-γ
and/or TNF-α and/or IL-2 by T cells upon stimulation (Figure 4A, 4B). A greater proportion of
the T cell responses detected to spike- and M/NP were found to be mediated by CD8+ (rather
than CD4+) T cells in those with mild disease compared to those with severe disease (Figure
4C).
Evaluation of the polyfunctionality of T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 peptides
Multi-cytokine analysis revealed a similar pattern of IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2 production by CD4+
and CD8+ T cells in both mild and severe cases (Figure 5A), For 18 individuals tested, both
CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific-T cells produced least one of these three cytokines and
others in combination. Higher proportions of CD4+T cells were able to produce more than one
cytokine than CD8+ T cells (Figure 5B). There was no difference in the overall number of
multifunctional T cells between the mild group and severe group. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells
targeting different virus proteins showed different cytokine profiles, with the M/NP-specific
CD8+ T cells having wider functionality than T cells targeting spike protein (p=0.0231, Figure
5B and 5C). Furthermore, the M/NP-specific CD8+ T cells were significantly higher than spikespecific T cells in those with mild disease, but not in those with severe disease. In contrast to
observations seen in influenza virus infection21 , we did not observe significant differences in
the cytotoxic potential (as indicated by expression of the degranulation marker CD107a) in
patients with mild and severe disease (Figure 5D); and we observed very few CD107a+ CD4+
T cells overall, suggesting cytotoxic CD4+ T cells might not be a major contributor to virus
clearance.

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell peptides containing epitopes
IFNγ ELISpot assays were performed with candidate peptides identified from the 2dimensional matrix analysis in 34 subjects. A total of 39 peptides containing SARS-CoV-2 T
cell epitope regions were recognized by COVID-19 recovered subjects, 17 from spike, 10 from
NP, 6 from membrane and 7 from ORF proteins.

Strikingly, 6 dominant peptides were

recognised by more than 18% of subjects tested (Table 1). NP-16 was recognised by 12/34
(35%) subjects tested and contained at least two epitopes which were CD8+ or CD4+
dependant.
M-24 was recognised by 16/34 subjects (47%) tested and contained one or more CD4+
epitopes. Peptide M-20 was recognised by 11/34 subjects tested (32%) and contained one or
more CD4+ epitopes. 3 dominant spike peptides were also identified, with S-34 recognised by
10/34 subjects (29%) containing both CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes, and a further two spike
peptides S-151 and S-174 were recognised by 8/34 and 6/34 subjects (24% and 18%), both
containing CD4+ epitopes.
Those dominant responses were further confirmed by both ex-vivo and using cultured shortterm T cell lines. Supplementary Figure 5 illustrates example FACS plots from intracellular
cytokine staining (ICS) when short-term T cell lines were stimulated with single peptides
containing epitopes. CD4+ T cells elicited strong responses against dominant spike peptides
and M peptides, whereas cells targeting two NP dominant peptides were CD8+ T cells. The
optimal epitopes recognised within long peptides to which dominant CD8+ responses were
detected and their HLA restriction were predicted using the optimal epitope prediction run by
IEDB analysis tool

(http://tools.iedb.org/mhci). The best predicted epitope sequences

identified are shown in Table 2.
A set of previously defined SARS epitopes16 with identical sequences to SARS-CoV-2 were
also tested by ELISpot assay (Supplementary table 2), Most of those peptides did not elicit
any positive responses in 42 COVID-19 recovered subjects, apart from two NP epitope
peptides (N-E-3 MEVTPSGTWL and N-E-11 LLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPK) and one spike
epitope peptide (S-E-19 QLIRAAEIRASANLAATK) . The HLA restriction of epitope N-E-3 was
confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of HLA Pentamer complexes of N-E-3 to be HLA-B*4001.
The majority of N-E-3-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited central memory (26.8%) or effector
memory phenotype (54.6%) (Figure 6) and early (CD27+CD28+, 56%) or intermediate
(CD27+CD28-, 43.3%) differentiation phenotype. In addition to this well-defined NP epitope,
N-E-11, which is identical to peptide NP-51, shares the sequence with two other known HLA-

A*0201 restricted SARS epitopes (N-E-1 ILLNKHID and N-E-5 ILLNKHIDA). Interestingly, one
of the responders to this peptide did not carry the HLA-A*0201 allele (Table 1), indicating this
peptide may contain a different SARS-CoV-2 epitope presented by a different HLA molecule.
Whereas these NP epitopes are targeted by CD8+ T cells, we also detected a CD4+ T cell
response targeting SARS spike epitope S-E-19 which spans between the overlapping
peptides of S-203 and S-204. This peptide is known to be presented by HLA-DRB1*0401 in
SARS infection.
Pre-existing cross-reactive T cell responses to common coronaviruses might play a role in
immunity to COVID-1915. However, we found the alignment of all epitopes identified here,
showed little homology with other common coronaviruses (Supplementary Figure 6).

Discussion
This is the first in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in individuals who
have recovered from COVID-19 stratified for disease severity. We found the breadth and
magnitude of the memory T cell responses from convalescent individuals with COVID-19 to
be greater in severe compared to mild cases, and this was most markedly observed to spike,
M, and ORF3 proteins. M/Np-specific CD8+ T cells were significantly higher frequency than
spike-specific CD8+ T cells in those with mild disease. The overall T cell responses as well as
spike-specific T cell responses correlated with spike, RBD and NP-specific antibody end point
titre. We also identified 39 individual peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ epitopes with 6
immunodominant epitope clusters defined. The memory responses we identified were fully
functional and capable of producing IFN-γ TNF-α and IL-2. CD8+ T cells expressed the
degranulation marker CD107a consistent with the killing potential of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.
Furthermore, the ratio of CD8:CD4 SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was greater for those with a
history of mild disease. Our data highlight the potential importance of including non-spike
proteins in future COVID-19 vaccine design.
Overall broader and stronger SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses in patients who recovered
from severe disease may reflect the higher viral loads, or an insufficient response to elicit early
control of virus or that the response was itself deleterious. Consistent with the Grifoni et al
recent report 15, we also observed a particularly high frequency of spike protein-specific CD4+
T cell responses in patients who had recovered from COVID-19. This is very similar to
influenza virus infection, where viral surface hemagglutinin (HA) expressed on the surface of
influenza virus elicited mostly CD4+ responses, whereas the majority of CD8+ responses were
specific to viral internal proteins 17. Understanding the immune protection by different subsets
of T cells in mild cases and their potential roles played in COVID-19 pathogenesis is a crucial
question. The timing and strength of early primed T cell responses, could be critical
determinants of viral control at an early stage of the infection.
Among the total 39 peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this study, strikingly, we
found six immunodominant epitope clusters (peptides) frequently targeted by T cells in many
donors, including 3 clusters in spike (29%, 24%, 18%), two in membrane protein (32%, 47%)
and one in nucleoprotein (35%). The high frequency of immunodominant responses observed
could be due to high level of virus co-receptor ACE2 expression 22 and high binding affinity to
spike of SARS-CoV-2

23

allowing more viral entry and more viral protein available for antigen

presentation. Whether or not these dominant responses play a role in immune protection

merits further investigation in a larger cohort, especially to include those who are symptomatic
with COVID-19.
We observed multiple strong dominant CD8+ T cell responses in study subjects specific to the
NP protein with dominant epitope clusters within NP (NP-16) detected in 35% study subjects.
In addition, a higher frequency of multi-cytokine producing M/Np-specific than spike-specific
CD8+ T cells was observed in subjects who had recovered from mild disease. These findings
suggest Np and M have potential as candidate proteins for inclusion within future vaccine
design.
However, we did not observe frequent IFN-γ producing SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses
in healthy unexposed volunteers which is different from recently published data by Grifoni et
al15 which was also observed by Braun et al

24

.

Our data are supported by a recent

immunogenicity study of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine
human phase I trial (108 volunteers without pre-exposure to COVID-19), where spike-specific
T cell responses before vaccination were not found when using IFN-γ based assays 7. We
believe the differences could be caused by differences in sensitivity of detection method used
between the studies, where Grifoni et al have used Activation Induced Marker assays (AIM)
as their main detection method for antigen-specific T cells. IFN-γ based detection assays
(ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining) are well-established methods to evaluate antigen
specific T cells in different virus infections, with direct functional relevance 17, 25, 26, 27, The AIM
assay is more recently developed assay, capable of detecting responsive T cells
independently of individual cytokines. Alternatively, it is possible that different circulating
coronaviruses have been recently been present in the different populations studied.
The dominant epitopes identified in this study showed little similarity between SARS-CoV-2
and other coronaviruses raising the question of the level and impact of pre-existing crossreactive T cells contributing to the epitopes that we identified. This is very different from what
we observed in influenza virus infection during the H5N1 pandemic where 90% homology was
observed between different strains with a high level of cross-reactivity detected by interferongamma based assays

17

. The presence and functionality of T cells in healthy volunteers

without previous exposure to COVID-19, requires further investigation in different populations
using different approaches.
Taken together, our study has demonstrated strong and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell
responses in the majority of subjects who had recovered from COVID-19. Immunodominant

epitope clusters and peptides containing T cell epitopes identified in this study will provide
critical tools to study the contribution of SARS-CoV-19 specific T cells in protection and
immune pathology. Identification of non-spike dominant CD8+ T cell epitopes suggest the
potential importance of including of non-spike protein such as NP, M and ORFs into future
vaccine designs.
