Abstract:
Receptor recognition is a major determinant of viral host range, as well as infectivity and
pathogenesis. Emergences have been associated with serendipitous events of adaptation upon
encounters with a novel host, and the high mutation rate of RNA viruses has been proposed to
explain their frequent host shifts 1. SARS-CoV-2 extensive circulation in humans has been
associated with the emergence of variants, including variants of concern (VOCs) with diverse
mutations in the spike and increased transmissibility or immune escape 2. Here we show that unlike
the initial virus, VOCs are able to infect common laboratory mice, replicating to high titers in the
lungs. This host range expansion is explained in part by the acquisition of changes at key positions
of the receptor binding domain that enable binding to the mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) cellular receptor, although differences between viral lineages suggest that other factors
are involved in the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs to infect mice. This abrogation of the species
barrier raises the possibility of wild rodent secondary reservoirs and provides new experimental
models to study disease pathophysiology and countermeasures.

Main Text:
Host range expansion or switch to other species has been prevalent in the course of coronaviruses
evolutionary history 3. Understanding the host range and how it is modified as the pathogen evolves
is critical to estimate the emergence risk and determine the reservoirs to monitor. In the case of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the ongoing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, animals such as non-human primates, hamsters,
ferrets, minks and cats were shown to be permissive 4. By contrast, the zoonotic virus was shown
to not replicate in mice and rats due to poor binding of the virus spike on the rodent cellular receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
At the end of 2020, the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) was noted in different parts of
the world. The lineage B.1.1.7 (Pango designation 5, also named 20I/501Y.V1 or VOC202012/01)
was noted for its rapid spread in the UK 6, while lineage B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2) expanded in
multiple regions of South Africa 7 and the P.1 (20J/501Y.V3) lineage emerged in Manaus, Brazil
8
. The global circulation and spread of these variants have led to concerns about increased
transmission and their potential to evade immunity elicited by vaccination or naturally acquired.
All three variants harbor the N501Y change in the spike glycoprotein which belongs to a set of 6
key amino acid residues critical for the tight interaction of the RBD with hACE2 9. Strikingly, this
mutation was also noted, among others, in independently generated mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2
strains 10,11. Here, we assessed the replication potential in cells and in mice of low-passage clinical
SARS-CoV-2 isolates of the main lineages.

The B.1.351 and P.1 variants efficiently replicate in mice airways
We first measured the capacity of a panel of low-passage clinical isolates belonging to the main
lineage and to each of the VOCs lineages (Fig. S1) to infect mouse cells expressing the murine
ACE2 receptor (DBT-mACE2), by comparison with VeroE6 cells. Contrary to the wild type
viruses (B and B.1 lineages) which did not replicate in these cells, all VOCs viruses replicated to
high titers at 48h post infection (Fig. S2).
We next inoculated 8-week-old BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice intranasally (i.n.) with a
representative virus of either the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineage (basal to B.1, carrying the
D614G substitution) or the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 or P.1 lineages and we measured the viral load and
titer in the lungs on day 3 post infection (dpi3). Consistently with what was reported for the
ancestral virus 12, only low amounts of viral RNA and no live B.1 virus was detected (Fig. 1A-B).
In contrast, inoculation with the B.1.351 or the P.1 viruses yielded high titer virus replication in
lung tissues in both mouse strains. The viral load was significantly lower for the B.1.1.7 virus,
with no infectious virus detected in the BALB/c lungs. To capture the time course of the productive
infection with the B.1.351 and P.1 viruses, we also sampled infected mice at day 2 and 4, revealing
an early peak of infection (Fig. S3). None of the mice infected with either viruses developed
symptoms nor lost weight.
Three days after B.1.351 or B.1.1.7 virus inoculation, histological evaluation of the lung ranged
from normal morphology to moderate lesions with multifocal interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes,
plasma cells, macrophages and rarer neutrophils, and degenerating epithelial cells in the bronchial
and bronchiolar spaces. Anti-N immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of infected cells in
bronchiolar epithelium, bronchiolar and alveolar spaces and alveolar walls (Figure 1C).
The ability of viruses of the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages to replicate in common laboratory mice
extends the host range of SARS-CoV-2 at least to this species. It has been proposed that persistence

can select for host range expansion of animal viruses, by selecting for virus variants that recognize
phylogenetic homologues of the receptor 13,14. Interestingly, there is still speculation on the
mechanism of emergence of the VOCs, which are all characterized by an unusually large number
of mutations compared to their last common ancestor, including a number of changes (substitution
and deletions) in the spike protein. While the genomic surveillance could have not captured all the
evolutionary intermediates leading to these lineages, similar patterns of accumulated changes were
noted in some longitudinal studies of immunocompromised individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2
for extended periods of time 15,16, leading to the hypothesis of a role of such long-term infections
in their emergence. As mutations in the positions of interest in the spike RBD (417, 484 and 501),
alone or in combination, have been noted in other lineages during the extensive circulation of
SARS-CoV-2 in human populations 17, and associated in vitro with modification of the affinity for
human ACE2, the observed host range expansion nevertheless likely represents only a
serendipitous by-product of selection for increased transmissibility in its current host.
Mechanistically, while all VOCs appeared to be able to replicate in a mouse cell line expressing
mACE2, we noted differences in vivo, with the B.1.1.7 virus inoculation yielding significantly
lower viral load in the lungs than the B.1.351 and P.1 viruses. Homology modeling of the spike in
contact with mACE2 reveals that the murine version of the receptor presents a strongly negatively
charged central patch composed of residues E35, D37, D38 and Q42. These residues are also
present in hACE2 but associated with several positively charged residues, which are replaced by
more neutral amino acids in mACE2 (Figure 2B). This feature indicates that efficient binding to
mACE2 would require complementary positive charges in the RBD. As expected, the mutation
N501Y makes its local environment in the RBD more neutral and hides negative charges exposed
in the B.1 RBD. The E484K mutation found in the RBD of variants B.1.351 and P.1 is also located
in the ACE2 binding interface, resulting in a more positively charged RBD surface, in turn
contributing to better binding to the negatively charged patch in mACE2, and might explain the
differences observed in vivo. This interpretation is consistent with recent results obtained with
pseudotyped viruses showing that the N501Y, E484K and their combination increase entry in
mACE2 expressing cells 18. However, other changes among the constellations defining the VOC
lineages might also play a role in the resulting in vivo phenotype. Indeed, the mouse-adapted
variants reported by Gu et al 10 and later Sun et al 19 induced pathological and inflammation
features that were not observed here, and were also associated with genetic changes outside of the
spike. Further studies are needed to dissect the combinatory role of the mutations defining the
SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.
The ability of viruses of the B.1.351 or P.1 lineages to replicate in common laboratory mice will
facilitate in vivo studies in this species, to evaluate countermeasures (vaccines or therapeutic
interventions), to assess antibody cross-reactivity and vaccine cross-protection, and for functional
studies using genetically altered mouse strains. Further in-depth studies will be needed to
characterize the pathological consequences of infection with these variants. Notably, unlike what
was described for a mouse adapted strain carrying the N501Y substitution 10, young adult mice
infected with our variants showed no signs of disease nor body weight loss. Whether a more severe
condition could be observed in older mice, in other mouse strains or with other isolates of the same
lineages remains to be determined. In addition, the difference of responses noted between the
BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice for the B.1.1.7 virus suggests a potential role of host factors as the
amino acid sequence of their ACE2 is identical.

Finally, although the infectious dose and the transmissibility between mice remain to be
established for these new variants, as well as the permissiveness of related animal species, these
results raise major questions on the risk of mice or other rodents living in proximity to humans of
becoming secondary reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 in regions where the B.1.351, P.1 or other
specific variants circulate, from where they could evolve separately and potentially spillback to
humans. Indeed, rodents have been hypothesized as the ancestral host of some betacoronaviruses
(lineage A, which includes the seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 20,21). While rodent
densities are highly variable and more difficult to control, similar and actionable concerns were
raised upon the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Mink farms in The Netherlands 22 and in Denmark
23
due to the density of animals housed, and the detection of changes in the virus genome. We posit
that host range should be closely monitored along the continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

the tyrosine side chain lies between the mACE2 residues Y41 and H353, making π-π interactions

carrying this mutation.

experimental work. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built based on the GTR model,
after masking 130 and 50 nucleotides from the 5’ and 3’ ends of the alignment, respectively, as
well as single nucleotides at positions 18529, 29849, 29851, 29853. We checked for temporal
signal using Tempest v1.5.3 3. The temporal phylogenetic analyses were performed with augur
and TreeTime 4, assuming a clock rate of 830.0008±0.0004 (SD) substitutions/site/year 5,
coalescent skyline population growth model and the root set on the branch leading to the
Wuhan/Hu-1/2020 sequence. The time and divergence trees were visualized with FigTree v1.4.4
86 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
In vivo studies
Eight-week-old female BALB/cJRj (BALB/c) and C57BL/6JRj (C57BL/6) mice were purchased
from Janvier Labs (Le Genest St Isle, France). Infection studies were performed in animal
biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities at the Institut Pasteur, in Paris. All animal work was approved

by the Institut Pasteur Ethics Committee (project dap 200008) and authorized by the French
Ministry of Research under project 24613 in compliance with the European and French
regulations.
Anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) mice were infected intranasally with 6 x104 PFU of SARS-CoV2 variants. Clinical signs of disease and weight loss were monitored daily. Mice were euthanized
by ketamine/xylazine overdose at indicated time points (2, 3 or 4 days post infection - dpi) when
samples for titer (right lung lobe) and histopathological analyses (left lung lobe) were collected.
The left lung lobe was fixed by submersion in 10% phosphate buffered formalin for 7 days prior
to removal from the BSL3 for processing. The right lung lobe was placed on a 70µ cell strainer
(Falcon), minced with fine scissors and ground with a syringe plunger using 400 µl of PBS. Lung
homogenates were used for viral quantification.
Histopathological analysis
Histological analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded 4µm-thick sections used for
hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and for the immunohistochemical detection of the virus, using
a rabbit polyclonal primary antibody directed against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein (Novus
Biologicals, cat #NB100-56576; dilution: 1:200). The IHC were carried out based on the
recommendations on the manufacturer's website (https://www.novusbio.com/products/sarsnucleocapsid-protein-antibody_nb100-56576).
Virus quantification.
Tissue homogenates were aliquoted for RNA quantification and titration. Viral RNA was extracted
using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Viral RNA quantification was performed by
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) using the IP4 set of primers and probe as
described on the WHO website (https://www.who.int/docs/default-34source/coronaviruse/realtime-rt-pcr-assays-for-the-detection-of-sars-cov-2-institut-35pasteurparis.pdf?sfvrsn=3662fcb6_2) and the Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB).
For plaque assay, 10-fold serial dilutions of samples in DMEM were added onto VeroE6
monolayers in 24 well plates. After one-hour incubation at 37°C, the inoculum was replaced with
2% FBS DMEM and 1% Carboxymethylcellulose. Three days later, cells were fixed with 4%
formaldehyde, followed by staining with 1% crystal violet to visualize the plaques.
Structural analysis
In order to study the effect on mACE2 binding of mutations in the RBD of the spike protein of the
new SARS-CoV-2 variants, we generated a homology model for mACE2/RBD complex based on
the available X-ray structure of the hACE2/RBD complex and analysed their electrostatic surface
potential at neutral pH. We used this model to analyse the predicted electrostatic potential at the
ACE2/RBD interface. We generated homology models of mACE2/RBD complexes corresponding
to the various SARS-CoV-2 variants using the MODELLER software 6 based on the crystal
structure of hACE2 peptidase domain in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (PBD 6M0J).
The quality of the models was inspected using PROCHECK and MOLPROBITY servers 7,8. The
surface electrostatic potential of the various models was calculated using the APBS/PDB2PQR
server at pH 7.0 using a PARSE forcefield. The cartoon diagrams and surface representations were
generated using PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC)
