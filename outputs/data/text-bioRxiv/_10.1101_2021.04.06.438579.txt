Abstract

20

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that is the causative agent of COVID-19, a sometimes-lethal

21

respiratory infection responsible for a world-wide pandemic. The envelope (E) protein, one of four

22

structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose

23

transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in

24

protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle,

25

including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and

26

dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR

27

spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The

28

chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane

29

helix (residues 8-43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53-60) connected by a complex linker that

30

exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-

31

terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift

32

perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-

33

terminal region (residues 6-18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E

34

protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA ≈ EIPA > DMA >>

35

Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5’ position of the amiloride pyrazine ring

36

play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the

37

production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the

38

inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining

39

the protein conformation near the binding site. These studies provide the foundation for complete

40

structure determination of E protein and for structure-based drug discovery targeting this protein.

Author Summary

42

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the world-wide pandemic of COVID-19,

43

has become one of the greatest threats to human health. While rapid progress has been made in the

44

development of vaccines, drug discovery has lagged, partly due to the lack of atomic-resolution

45

structures of the free and drug-bound forms of the viral proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E)

46

protein, with its multiple activities that contribute to viral replication, is widely regarded as a potential

47

target for COVID-19 treatment. As structural information is essential for drug discovery, we established

48

an efficient sample preparation system for biochemical and structural studies of intact full-length SARS-

49

CoV-2 E protein and characterized its structure and dynamics. We also characterized the interactions

50

of amilorides with specific E protein residues and correlated this with their antiviral activity during viral

51

replication. The binding affinity of the amilorides to E protein correlated with their antiviral potency,

52

suggesting that E protein is indeed the likely target of their antiviral activity. We found that residue

53

asparagine15 plays an important role in maintaining the conformation of the amiloride binding site,

54

providing molecular guidance for the design of inhibitors targeting E protein.

Introduction

57

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has garnered attention as the

58

causative agent of the disease COVID-19. It is an enveloped RNA virus classified as a beta coronavirus

59

[1] similar to the previously studied SARS-CoV [2] and MERS-CoV [3] viruses. While rapid progress

60

has been made in analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genome [4] and the development of protective vaccines

61

[5, 6], the discovery of therapeutics has lagged, largely due to the lack of structures of the viral proteins

62

and information about their specific roles in infection, replication, and propagation. Here we apply NMR

63

spectroscopy to the envelope (E) protein, one of the structural membrane proteins of SARS-CoV-2, in

64

order to characterize its secondary structure, drug binding site, and effects of selected single-site

65

mutations on its structure and binding of amiloride compounds. To accomplish these goals, the results

66

from NMR on E protein are augmented by those from virological experiments on infected cells [7] as

67

well as the measurement of antiviral activities of amiloride compounds.

68

The approximately 30kb RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for 29 proteins

69

(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512). The most abundant are four structural proteins,

70

membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S), of which M, E, and S are integral

71

membrane proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope (Fig1). Each of these proteins

72

exists as a homo-oligomer under some experimental conditions: a dimer or dimer of dimers for M [8], a

73

pentamer for E [9, 10], and a trimer for S [11]. The biological relevance of E protein comes from its

74

involvement in key aspects of the virus lifecycle, including infection, replication, assembly, budding, and

75

pathogenesis [12]. Furthermore, recombinant coronaviruses lacking E protein exhibit significantly

76

reduced viral titers, crippled viral maturation, and yield propagation incompetent progeny [13-15].

77

SARS-CoV-2 E protein is a hydrophobic 75-residue protein with an amino acid sequence nearly

78

identical to that of SARS-CoV E protein (S1 Fig) [12]. Since E protein is a viral membrane-spanning

79

miniprotein [16], a recurring question is whether it is a viroporin. Although ion-channel activity has been

80

detected in a variety of preparations it lacks sequence homology with any of the well-established

81

viroporins, and there is a notable absence of charged sidechains on the interior of a pore formed by

82

pentamers of the protein in membrane environments [9, 10, 17, 18].

83

The importance of E protein for viral replication and maturation is well established, making it an

84

attractive target for antiviral drugs. Drug design requires high-resolution structures of the protein

85

receptor in its bound and free states. Small membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to crystallize in

86

their native states in liquid crystalline membrane bilayers for X-ray crystallography and are too small for

87

cryoEM to be effective. While generally suited for NMR spectroscopy, careful consideration of the

88

membrane-like environment of the samples and the NMR experimental methods are essential [19].

89

Even the earliest NMR studies of membrane proteins showed that caution is called for when using

90

micelle environments [20], because of the potential for aggregation and structural distortions [21, 22].

91

Nonetheless, careful optimization of sample conditions has enabled solution NMR to provide valid

92

structural information about membrane proteins that could be obtained in no other way. Moreover, we

93

have found it essential to prepare samples of membrane proteins in micelles that yield high-resolution

94

solution NMR spectra in order to verify that they integrate into an amphipathic membrane-like

95

environment, are chemically pure, not mis-folded, and not aggregated before initiating significantly

96

more demanding solid-state NMR studies of phospholipid bilayer samples. In order to ensure that solid-

97

state NMR experiments are performed under near-native conditions, both the protein and the bilayers

98

must be fully characterized to ensure that the protein is in its biologically active conformation and stably

99

embedded in liquid crystalline, fully hydrated phospholipid bilayers at high lipid to protein ratios.

100

Here we describe solution NMR studies of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein and several truncated

101

and mutated constructs in highly optimized n-hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC; fos-choline-16) micelles.

102

Because our novel purification scheme starts by using HPC to solubilize the protein-containing

103

inclusion bodies and HPC is present during all subsequent steps, the polypeptides are never exposed

104

to any other detergent or lipid, which would require exchanges, or to any organic solvent, which would

105

require refolding. The success of the HPC-based protein purification and sample preparation scheme

106

results in the well-resolved solution NMR spectra presented in the Figures. Furthermore, this scheme

107

leads directly to the preparation of magnetically aligned bilayer samples that are well-suited for protein

108

structure determination by oriented sample (OS) solid-state NMR [23].

109

Previous structural studies of coronavirus E protein, especially by NMR, have been simplified by

110

using relatively short polypeptides with sequences corresponding to a substantial portion of the N-

111

terminal domain containing the transmembrane helix that forms ion channels through homo-

112

oligomerization as well as residues responsible for drug binding [9, 10, 17, 18]. To date, no structural

113

data have been presented for any full-length coronavirus E protein. Structures of a 31-residue synthetic

114

polypeptide (residues 8-38) [17] and of a longer 58-residue expressed polypeptide (residues 8-65)

115

containing three Cys to Ala mutations and non-native 23-residues in its N-terminus [9, 18] have been

116

described for sequences from the SARS-CoV E protein. They are highly relevant to studies of the

117

SARS-CoV-2 E protein because the amino acid sequences of these two proteins are identical between

118

residues 1 and 68. The partial E protein structures determined for these polypeptides in micelles by

119

solution NMR have been modeled as pentamers [9, 17, 18]. In addition, an expressed 31-residue

120

polypeptide with the same sequence as residues 8-38 of SARS-CoV-2 E protein has been studied by

121

magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR in the presence of phospholipids, and its structure has

122

also been modeled as a pentamer [10]. There are significant differences between the conclusions

123

derived from these earlier studies of relatively small polypeptides missing the N-terminal seven

124

residues and those presented here based on studies of full-length protein (residues 1-75) and two

125

overlapping constructs encompassing the N-terminal domain (residues 1-39) and the C-terminal

126

domain (residues 36-75). Notably, the wild-type N-terminal 39-residues are present in both the full-

127

length and C-terminal truncated proteins.

portions of the membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and spike (S) protein are shown in red, and the extraand intra- cellular portions are shown in blue. Proposed intraviral protein-protein interactions are indicated by the
dashed arrows. RBD: receptor-binding domain; MBD: membrane-binding domain. Nucleocapsid (N) is the fourth
structural protein.

While the transmembrane helix of E protein is thought to be largely responsible for homo-

135

oligomerization and ion-channel activity [17, 18], its highly hydrophobic nature makes modeling a

136

channel similar to those of other miniproteins difficult [16]. Intraviral interactions between E and M

137

proteins have been shown to involve the C-terminal domains of both proteins [24, 25]. The triple

138

cysteine motif (C40, C43, and C44) in E protein has been proposed to associate with the cysteine-rich

139

C-terminal region of S protein by forming intermolecular disulfide bonds [26]. E protein also interacts

140

with host proteins [12]. The C-terminal four residues, DLLV, have been identified as a PDZ-binding

141

motif that interacts with the tight junction-associated PALS1 protein [27]. The C-terminal region of E

142

protein that resembles the bromodomain binding site of histone H3 interacts with bromodomains 2 and

143

4 via acetylated Lys63, which is involved in the regulation of gene transcription [28]. These studies

144

provide strong biological and mechanistic justification for considering coronavirus E protein as a

145

potential drug target. Extending structural studies to samples of the full-length protein that include the

146

complete drug binding site as well as the native N-terminus, C-terminus, and other features is essential

147

for structure-based drug discovery. Equally important is the correlation of structural features of the

148

protein with specific biological activities of the virus as it reproduces in human cells.

149

The channel activity of E protein has been suggested to play a role in viral replication [29] . A well-

150

characterized channel blocker, hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), inhibits ion channel conductance of E

151

proteins from HCoV-229E and MHV as well as virus replication in cultured cells [30]. HMA also inhibits

152

the channel conductance of transmembrane-containing synthetic and expressed polypeptides from the

153

SARS-CoV E protein [17, 18]. Although interactions of HMA with E protein of SARS-CoV have been

154

detected in prior studies, the residues in the HMA binding site identified by NMR chemical shift

155

perturbations varied quite a bit depending upon the specific E protein constructs and experimental

156

conditions [9, 10, 17, 18].

157

Here we characterize the secondary structure of full-length E protein from SARS-CoV-2 in HPC

158

micelles. We also map out the complete binding sites of amiloride and three amiloride derivatives

159

(dimethyl amiloride (DMA), ethyl isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), and HMA) and compare their binding

160

properties. Importantly, the antiviral potency of the amiloride derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 infection

161

of Vero E6 cells correlates well with their strength of binding as observed in the NMR experiments. The

162

N15A and V25F mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein have very different effects on the NMR

163

spectra of the protein; the N15A mutation causes greater chemical shift perturbations over a larger

164

region of the protein than the V25F mutation, which causes only minor changes near the site of the

165

amino acid substitution. These mutations affect production of virus-like particle (VLP) and, in the case

166

of N15A, the binding of HMA.

169

In order to apply NMR spectroscopy to full-length E protein of SARS-CoV-2 it was essential to develop

170

and implement an entirely new sample preparation scheme. We were unable to overcome the

171

difficulties inherent in dealing with hydrophobic membrane proteins in the case of E protein using

172

approaches that we had previously applied successfully to viral, bacterial, and human membrane

173

proteins with between one and seven transmembrane helices [31-36]. These preparative difficulties

174

may be among the reasons that prior NMR studies of E protein have been limited to N- and C- terminal

175

truncated constructs with only 31 or 58 residues, which are notably missing the seven N-terminal

176

residues that our data show to be essential components of the drug-binding site.

The ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) fusion partner facilitated the expression of high levels of three

178

different E protein constructs, including the full-length protein (residues 1-75), as inclusion bodies in E.

179

coli [32, 37]. A ten-residue His-tag followed by a six-residue thrombin cleavage site, LPVRGS, inserted

180

between the KSI and the E protein sequences enabled purification by Ni-affinity chromatography and

181

efficient enzymatic cleavage (Fig 2C). The resulting E protein sequence differs from that of the SARS-

182

CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) only by the presence of two additional residues (GlySer) at

183

the N-terminus that were originally part of the thrombin cleavage site (Fig 2B).

184

Our scheme for the expression and purification of the full-length wild-type and mutated, and

185

truncated constructs of E protein is outlined in Fig 2C. They were all expressed in E. coli as fusion

186

proteins and sequestered in inclusion bodies (Fig 2D). After screening many detergents informed by

187

our extensive experience with solution NMR studies of membrane proteins [20, 31, 38-41] and

188

thorough literature reviews [22], we found that the highest resolution spectra were obtained when E

189

protein was solubilized in hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC, fos-choline-16) micelles. Chemically similar

190

to the commonly used dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) [42], HPC has been previously considered for,

191

but, to our knowledge, not used to study membrane proteins by NMR [43]. HPC is notable for its low

192

critical micelle concentration (CMC, 13 µM) (www.anatrace.com). It is able to solubilize E protein and

193

other hydrophobic membrane proteins, is effective with Ni-affinity chromatography, and at a low

concentration of 0.05% w/v (1.23 mM) does not interfere with specific thrombin cleavage. This

195

approach is highly efficient and, significantly, obviates the need for detergent exchanges or exposure to

196

organic solvents at any stage of the isolation and purification process. Purified full-length E (EF) in HPC

197

micelles runs as a monomer (~ 8.5 kDa) with a narrow band on SDS-PAGE (Fig 2D). By contrast, as

198

observed by others [44], it runs as a broad ill-defined band on PFO (perfluorooctanoic acid)-PAGE that

199

may demonstrate the presence of an oligomeric species (Fig 9D) generally assumed to be a pentamer

200

consistent with its viroporin-like properties [9, 10, 17, 18, 44, 45]. All samples used in the NMR

201

experiments were prepared directly from protein solubilized in HPC from start to finish. The resulting

202

NMR spectra are well-resolved with narrow resonance linewidths. The samples exhibit excellent long-

203

term stability at 50oC (Fig 3).

which suggests an absence of inter-domain interactions and possibly independence of their biological

236

activities, which remains to be demonstrated in vivo.

237

Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange is an effective way to identify residues in transmembrane

238

helices of membrane proteins [46]. When samples of the E protein constructs were prepared in >90%

239

D2O instead of ~ 90% H2O, no amide signals from residues 36-75 in the cytoplasmic domain were

240

observable in the spectra of EF or EC; by contrast, strong signals from residues 19-35 and 19-33 were

241

present in the spectra of EF and ET, respectively (Fig 3 and Fig 4C), demonstrating that these residues

242

contribute to the stable core of its unusually long trans-membrane helix. Truncation at residue 39

243

enhances solvent exchange at residues 34 and 35 of ET, which are 5 and 6 residues distal to its C-

244

terminus, respectively, due to structural changes reflected in chemical shift changes of the resonances

245

from the nine terminal residues (S4C Fig).

253

In previous studies, evidence has been presented that the predominant secondary structure of E

254

protein is a-helix. However, the lengths of the proposed helical segments varied widely, depending

255

upon which residues were included in the polypeptide constructs, the types of samples, and the

256

experimental conditions [9, 10, 17, 18]. Here we describe the secondary structure of full-length E

257

protein in HPC micelles by analyzing the chemical shifts of backbone 13C resonances [47] and amide

258

1

259

manganese titration, and heteronuclear 1H/15N NOE measurements backed up by preliminary solid-

260

state NMR spectra of protein-containing phospholipid bilayers. Complementary results have been

261

obtained from samples of EF, ET, and EC.

262

H/15N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) [48, 49]. Further support comes from H/D exchange,

Both the 13C chemical shift index (CSI) plots (Fig 4C and 4D) and the 1H-15N dipolar wave plot (Fig

263

4B) demonstrate that full-length E protein has a long 36-residue transmembrane helix and a separate

264

short 8-residue cytoplasmic helix. None of these backbone data indicate the presence of regular

265

secondary structure in residues 43-52 located in the region linking the two helices. Although the RDCs

266

have significant amplitudes, as expected for a structured region, the 1H/15N heteronuclear NOE data

267

(Fig 4E) suggests that this well-defined internal region of the protein undergoes modest

268

amplitude/frequency motions that are not present in the helical regions. The 1H/15N heteronuclear NOE

269

data also shows that residues 2-7, before the start of the N-terminal helix, and residues 61-75 following

270

the end of the C-terminal helix exhibit gradients of increasing motion towards the termini, although even

271

the terminal residues do not appear to be highly mobile and unstructured, as is sometimes the case in

272

this class of proteins [32, 50].

273

The sinusoidal waves that fit best to the magnitudes and signs of the measured RDCs as a

274

function of residue number have a periodicity of 3.6 residues per turn, proving with a very high level of

275

confidence that the protein has segments of regular a-helix secondary structure [48, 49, 51]. The

276

addition or subtraction of a single residue at either end of the helical segments significantly degrades

277

the quality of the fit, providing a clear demarcation of the length of the helical segments. The different

278

average amplitudes of the two distinct dipolar waves in Fig 4B show that the two helices have different

279

orientations relative to the direction of molecular alignment. Another notable feature is that the dipolar

280

wave for the core region of the transmembrane helix (residues 19-34) is best fit by a sine wave with a

281

somewhat smaller amplitude than for the rest of the long helical region (residues 8-18 and 35-43),

282

suggesting that the 36-residue helix is not completely uniform throughout its length.

283

To assess the orientation of the C-terminal helix and possible interactions of the cytoplasmic

284

domain with the hydrophilic headgroups of HPC, we examined the effects of adding paramagnetic

285

manganese ions to samples of full-length E protein. Broadening of many 1H/15N HSQC resonances was

286

observed as a function of increasing the concentration of MnCl2. Significantly, the signals from residues

287

1-16, 40-51, and 64-75 were broadened beyond detection at a concentration of 5 mM MnCl2, while the

288

signals from residues 17-39 and 52-63 remained readily observable. These signals correspond almost

289

exactly to the residues in the core of the long hydrophobic helix (Fig 4B, 4C, and 4D) and the short

290

cytoplasmic helix, with the later suggesting that the cytoplasmic helix may interact with the membrane

291

surface.

305

and the red contours in the presence of HMA. For the constructs that include the N-terminal portion of

306

the protein, EF and ET, the chemical shifts of the corresponding residues were perturbed in the same

307

directions and to a similar extent, as illustrated in the plots of the chemical shift changes as a function

308

of residue number in Figs 5D and 5E. By contrast, no significant chemical shift changes were observed

309

in the resonances from the cytoplasmic domain (EC) alone (Fig 5E) or as part of the full-length protein

310

(EF) (Fig 5A). Although there is evidence that residues 2-5 are affected by drug binding, the most

311

strongly perturbed signals are associated with residues 6-18 at the N-terminal end of the long helix and

312

extending to the core portion distinguished by its resistance to H/D exchange and broadening by

313

manganese ions, as well as the reduced amplitude of its dipolar wave. Qualitatively, the data in Fig 5

314

confirm that HMA interacts with the N-terminal domain of E protein.

315

The EF and ET constructs were designed to include all N-terminal residues, and these data show

316

that the binding site definitely includes residues 6, 7, an 8, and likely residues 2, 3, 4 and 5, none of

317

which were present in the previously studied constructs, and extends to residue 18. Nearly all of the

318

residues that constitute the binding site belong to the highly regular helix, until it abruptly changes tilt

319

angles at residue 18, the start of the core region. The residues between Ser6 and Leu18 are perturbed

320

by binding HMA and undergo facile H/D exchange: resistance to H/D exchange starts with residue 18.

321

Notably, signals from four hydrophilic residues (Glu8, Thr9, Thr11, and Asn15) as well as Ile13 are

322

most perturbed by HMA binding. Smaller CSPs observed in the C-terminal region of ET were not

323

present with EF, which may be due to non-specific HMA binding to the unnatural exposed C-terminal

324

region of ET. Titration of ET with HMA results in gradual chemical shift changes (data not shown),

325

demonstrating that binding occurs in fast exchange on the timescales defined by the chemical shift

326

differences.

To compare the binding sites and affinities, we added increasing amounts of amiloride and two

338

amiloride derivatives, dimethyl amiloride (DMA) and ethyl isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), to samples of full-

339

length E protein (EF) and monitored their two-dimensional 1H/15N HSQC spectra (Fig 6). Notably, the

340

same residues of EF were affected by all of the amiloride derivatives albeit with different magnitudes of

341

CSPs, indicating that they all utilize the same binding site but with different binding affinities. No

342

significant changes were observed to the EF spectrum upon addition of amiloride (Fig 6A and 6D),

343

while the largest changes were observed with EIPA (Fig 6C and 6F), DMA induced moderate changes

344

and the magnitudes of its CSPs lie between those of amiloride and HMA (Fig 6B and 6E). The

355

The amiloride derivatives were tested for their ability to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6

356

cells. Mirroring the NMR binding data of E protein in Figs 5 and 6, the compounds with bulkier aliphatic

357

or aromatic substituents at the 5’ pyrazine ring (EIPA and HMA) showed the strongest inhibition, with

358

sub-micromolar IC50 values, while the compounds with smaller substituents were less effective

359

inhibitors (Fig 7). The similarity of the trends for inhibition of replication and of binding to E protein

360

suggests that this protein may very well be a target for the antiviral activity of amiloride compounds. Of

361

note, the most active compound examined here, HMA, shows considerable cytotoxicity (therapeutic

362

index = 21.23), therefore, EIPA may be a better choice for potential therapeutic use (therapeutic index

363

= 84.83) or as a starting point for further drug development.

compounds were added at the indicated concentrations to Vero E6 cells simultaneously with authentic SARSCoV-2 virus (MOI 0.1) and incubated for 48 hours. Inhibition of infection (solid squares and curves in black) was
measured by high-content imaging for intracellular SARS-CoV-2 N protein and is relative to a DMSO-treated
infected control. Cytotoxicity (solid circles and curves in red) was measured similarly using a nuclei stain and
quantifying cell numbers relative to the DMSO-treated infected control. The curves were calculated using the
nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism 9. IC50 and CC50 values for each compound are indicated in the

In order to identify the stage of the viral replication cycle affected by the amiloride compounds, their

375

antiviral activity was reevaluated at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI of 1.0 infectious units per cell)

376

and after a relatively brief incubation (Fig 8, 18 hours). The same ranking of antiviral activity among the

377

compounds was observed, with HMA and EIPA the most active. The observed IC50 values were higher

378

than those measured in the experiments summarized by the data shown in Fig 7. This was not

379

unexpected since the antiviral assay of Fig 8 was done at an MOI ten-fold higher than that of Fig 7, and

380

the time of incubation allowed for only one or two replication cycles (18 hours in Fig 8 compared to 48

381

hours in Fig 7). We observed microscopically that EIPA and HMA decreased the number of cells in

382

each infected focus in the monolayer (Fig 8C and 8D). This effect was especially striking for HMA; most

383

foci contained only one or two cells, suggesting that the spread of infection to adjacent cells in the foci

384

was inhibited. To determine whether the amiloride compounds were inhibiting only this cell-cell spread

385

or were also affecting the infectivity of the inoculum, we enumerated both the number of infected cells

386

and the number of infected-cell-foci (containing one or more cells) and compared the IC50 values

387

obtained with each (Fig 8). The IC50 values obtained using the number of infected cells (Fig 8E-8H)

388

were less than those obtained using the number of infected-cell-foci (Fig 8I-8L). These data suggest

389

that the amiloride compounds act late in the viral replication cycle and affect the spread of virus from

390

cell-to-cell, although they do not exclude the possibility of a modest effect on the establishment of

391

infection by cell-free virus.

Previous studies of E protein of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), a gamma coronavirus, showed

411

that mutations within the transmembrane domain altered the ability of VLPs to assemble [52]. To

412

determine the impact of similar mutations in SARS-CoV-2 E protein, two mutants were generated,

413

N15A and V25F, which are analogous to IBV E protein residues Thr16 and Ala26, respectively (S1 Fig).

414

The N15A and V25F mutations in SARS-CoV-2 E protein increased their expression compared to the

415

wild-type protein in HEK293T cell lysates (Fig 9A). Similar to the T16A mutation in IBV E protein, the

416

N15A mutation in SARS-CoV-2 E protein increased VLP production by approximately 40% compared to

417

the wild-type E protein, while the V25F mutation decreased VLP production by 60% compared to wild-

418

type E protein, similar to the effect of the A26F mutation on the IBV E protein (Fig 9B and 9C).

419
420

The mutations T16A and A26F in the IBV E protein have been shown to affect its oligomeric state
[52]. However, the analogous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 E protein do not appear to affect its

mutant proteins (data not shown), the relatively large and wide spread chemical shift perturbations by

441

the N15A mutation may result from changes in intermolecular hydrogen bonding involving Asn15 side

442

chains [53].

443

Previous mutational studies of polypeptides containing the transmembrane helix of SARS-CoV E

444

protein have shown that a single mutation, e.g., N15A or V25F, can disrupt ion channel activity in lipid

445

bilayers [54, 55]. We found that the N15A mutation of SARS-CoV-2 E protein decreased HMA binding,

446

since no significant chemical shift changes are observed in the presence of HMA, with the exception of

447

Ser6 (Fig 11A and 11C). By contrast, HMA binding was not affected by the V25F mutation, since the

448

chemical shifts of signals from residues near the HMA binding site were unchanged and their CSPs

449

were identical to those observed for wild-type E protein (Fig 11B and 11D). Based on these results, it

450

appears that Asn15 is essential for maintaining the conformation of E protein required for binding HMA.

especially challenging because, as shown in Fig 1, significant portions of these proteins reside within

468

the phospholipid bilayer of the viral envelope. Here we combine the results of solution NMR

469

spectroscopic studies and virologic studies of SARS-CoV-2 E protein to evaluate its potential as a drug

470

target. We focused our studies on the 75-residue full-length E protein and two overlapping truncated

471

constructs corresponding to the N-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1-39), that includes a

472

long hydrophobic helix, and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 36-75), that includes a short

473

helix and three cysteine residues (Fig 2B).

474

Heterologous expression of viral membrane proteins in E. coli, the most convenient system for the

475

preparation of milligram amounts of isotopically labeled proteins, is generally problematic. Hydrophobic

476

membrane proteins are prone to aggregation, likely from non-specific hydrophobic intermolecular

477

interactions or possibly incorrect intra- and/or inter- molecular disulfide linkages, the latter of which is

478

especially pertinent for SARS-CoV-2 E protein because it has three closely spaced cysteine residues in

479

its C-terminal domain. The expression of full-length E protein from SARS-CoV, whose sequence is

480

nearly identical to that of the 75-residue protein from SARS-CoV-2, has been reported [44]; however, a

481

modified b-barrel construct was used as the expression tag along with urea to solubilize the inclusion

482

bodies, followed by chemical cleavage and HPLC purification. The resulting protein in DPC or mixed

483

DPC/SDS micelles did not yield NMR spectra suitable for structural studies. Essentially all previous

484

NMR studies of SARS-CoV-2 E protein [9, 10, 17, 18] were carried out on substantially smaller

485

polypeptides with either 31 or 58 residues. In addition to the smaller number of residues in the

486

polypeptides and the missing N- and C- terminal amino acids, the prior studies differ from those

487

described here in several other substantial ways, including the expression system, choice of fusion

488

protein, method of protein expression and purification, choice of micelle-forming detergent, and other

489

experimental parameters. Not surprisingly, there are many significant differences between the findings

490

of the previous NMR studies and those described here. Moreover, we carried out spectroscopic and

491

virologic studies in parallel, with the results of both serving as controls, suggesting subsequent

492

experiments and guiding the interpretation of the findings.

493

Nothing could be done without the preparation of isotopically labeled E protein samples suitable for

494

NMR spectroscopy. This formidable barrier required the design and implementation of a novel bacterial

495

expression and purification system (Fig 2). There are three notable aspects to our approach: 1) The

496

KSI-E protein fusion protein expression system in C43(DE3) E. coli cells boosts expression levels and

497

circumvents cytotoxicity by sequestering the overexpressed hydrophobic E protein in inclusion bodies;

498

2) Insertion of a 24-residue linker, which includes a ten-His tag and a 6-residue (LVPRGS) thrombin

499

cleavage site, between the sequences of the KSI and E proteins, facilitates affinity chromatography

500

purification and enzymatic cleavage because thrombin retains specificity and activity at low detergent

501

concentrations; 3) A single “mild” detergent, HPC, with low CMC, is used to solubilize the protein

502

throughout all steps of isolation, purification, and sample preparation. This eliminates the need for

503

detergent or lipid exchanges and is applicable to full-length, truncated, and mutated constructs of E

504

protein (Figs 3 and 9). Moreover, this approach to sample preparation may be generally applicable to

505

other membrane proteins. We have already used it to prepare samples of several constructs of the

506

membrane binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Fig 1) that yield high-resolution NMR

507

spectra (data not shown). In addition, this approach provides an expedient starting point for the

508

preparation of samples of E protein and potentially other membrane proteins in liquid crystalline

509

phospholipid bilayers at the high lipid to protein ratios required for solid-state NMR spectroscopy under

510

near-native conditions. Initial comparisons between results obtained in HPC micelles by solution NMR

511

and those obtained in phospholipid bilayers by oriented sample solid-state NMR (S7A Fig) provide

512

assurance that the protein structure is not strongly affected by HPC. This is significant because there

513

have been no previous NMR studies of membrane proteins in HPC micelles. The feasibility of solution

514

NMR studies of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein is demonstrated by the high-resolution and signal-to-

515

noise ratios of resonances from individual amide sites in the two-dimensional 1H/15N NMR spectrum of

516

a uniformly 15N labeled sample (Fig 3A). This includes the assignment of backbone resonances using

517

standard triple-resonance methods [56] on a uniformly 13C- and 15N- double-labeled sample. Following

518

the sequential assignment of all backbone resonances in the spectra of three overlapping E protein

519

constructs, EF (residues 1-75), ET (residues 1-39), and EC (residues 36-75), it was straightforward to

520

characterize the overall organization, secondary structure, and local dynamics of E protein in HPC

521

micelles using the set of experimental data aligned by residue number in Fig 4. The most striking

522

feature to emerge is that E protein has a very long 36-residue a-helix (residues 8-43) in the N-terminal

523

transmembrane domain. There is also a shorter 8-residue a-helix (residues 53-60) in the C-terminal

524

domain that has a different orientation in the protein than the long helix. Since the 1H and 15N chemical

525

shifts of the vast majority of resonances present in the two-dimensional HSQC spectra (Fig 3) of the

526

full-length and truncated constructs overlap nearly exactly, the conformations of the N-terminal and C-

527

terminal domains are the same whether alone or as part of the intact protein. The conservation of

528

domain structures, also observed for the small membrane protein Vpu from HIV-1 [31, 57], suggests

529

that each domain of E protein has separate roles in the virus life cycle, although this remains to be

530

shown in future in vivo experiments.

531

Prior NMR studies have shown E protein to be largely helical. However, the polypeptides used in

532

the experiments and the model membrane environments differ so much that it is premature to provide a

533

comprehensive analysis of why the lengths, locations, and distortions of the helical segments differ so

534

drastically among various reports [9, 10, 17, 18]. As an example, in 2009 Pervushin et al. [17] found by

535

NMR that all 31 residues of a synthetic polypeptide with a sequence corresponding to residues 8-38 of

536

E protein participated in a continuous a-helix in the presence of DPC. By contrast, in a 2020 report

537

Mandala et al. [10] found by NMR a 21- or 25-residue helix, with a substantial local distortion, in the

538

same polypeptide prepared by bacterial expression, in the presence of DMPC instead of DPC.

539

Here we make direct comparisons between our results on the 75-residue full-length E protein and

540

those in the most recent report, cited above, on the widely used 31-residue doubly truncated

541

polypeptide [10]. We find that the 36-residue transmembrane helix is quite long (residues 8-43 of the

542

full-length E protein) compared to the more typical 21- or 25- residue transmembrane helix found by

543

Mandala et al. The results also differ regarding the distortion of this helix. We find it to be continuous

544

and straight, with the exception of the 17-residue core (residues 19-35), identified by resistance to H/D

545

solvent exchange and broadening by the presence of paramagnetic Mn2+ in the solution, and most

546

definitively by the dipolar wave analysis that shows that this segment is also straight albeit with a

547

detectably different tilt angle than the co-linear N- and C-terminal portions of the helix (residues 8-18

548

and 36-43). Instead, Mandala et al. [10] describe a singular 4-residue distortion at residues 20-23.

549

Oriented sample solid-state NMR data (S7A Fig) shows that the membrane-spanning helix has a large

550

tilt angle (approx. 45o) as necessitated by hydrophobic matching of the 36-residue hydrophobic helix

551

with the 14-carbon methylene chains of DMPC bilayers [58] By contrast, Mandala et al. [10] interpret

552

their MAS solid-state NMR data to show that this helix has a very small tilt angle in the presence of

553

DMPC. On the one hand, our solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a uniaxially aligned

554

sample with the bilayer normal perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field (S7A Fig), therefore

555

the protein must be undergoing rapid rotational diffusion at 35oC in order to yield spectra with narrow

556

single-line resonances. On the other hand, Mandala et al. [10] state that the protein does not undergo

557

fast rigid-body uniaxial rotation at high temperatures. The differences between the structural findings in

558

the two studies may arise from a number of possible sources, such as the difference in the lengths of

559

the polypeptides (75 vs. 31 residues), properties of the membrane-like environments produced by HPC

560

and DMPC, and the use of different NMR approaches (primarily solution NMR complemented by a

561

contribution from OS solid-state NMR vs. MAS solid-state NMR). The PISA Wheel-based analysis [59,

562

60] of the solid-state NMR spectrum of uniformly 15N labeled ET in aligned phospholipid bilayers (S7

563

Fig) shows that the transmembrane helix has a large tilt angle (~45o) that is consistent with the finding

564

of a very long (36-residue) trans-membrane helix in HPC micelles. The one-dimensional NMR spectrum

565

in S7 Fig as well as complementary two-dimensional PISEMA spectra (data not shown) foreshadow the

566

structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 E protein in phospholipid bilayers under near-native conditions.

567

Outstanding questions about E protein include whether it has in vivo ion channel activity, and

568

whether this activity is responsible for essential biological functions. Channel activity has been

569

observed for full-length E protein as well as N-terminal constructs containing its principal helix. This has

570

been used as evidence that it forms a pentamer with a central pore characteristic of viroporins. Since it

571

is small viral protein with 75 residues, it is classified as a miniprotein [16]. If its ion channel activity does

572

indeed result from forming a defined oligomer, then it can be categorized as a viroporin. However, its

573

primary and secondary structures differ dramatically from proteins previously described as viroporins.

574

Most notably, the 36-residue helix of the E protein is much longer than the trans-membrane helices

575

identified in archetypical viroporins like Vpu from HIV-1 [32] and M2 from influenza virus [61], whose

576

shorter transmembrane helices have 18- and 25- residues, respectively.

577

A hallmark of viroporins is that they form homo-oligomers in the host membranes and their

578

amphipathic transmembrane domain is essential for ion channel activity. The full-length E protein has a

579

monomeric molecular weight of 8.5 kDa. It migrates as an oligomer with an apparent molecular weight

580

of about 50 kDa with a minor band of monomers in PFO-PAGE (Fig 8D). The protein has three

581

cysteines (C40, C43, and C44) and at least two of them are conserved across a/b coronaviridae (S1

582

Fig). The presence of reducing agents does not affect the PFO-PAGE or the NMR spectra of E protein,

583

suggesting that cysteines are not involved in oligomerization or aggregation. Its existence in pentamers

584

is primarily attributed to results from detergent micelle-based analytical ultracentrifugation and BN-

585

PAGE and PFO-PAGE analysis [18, 44]. IBV E protein has also been shown to exist as both

586

monomers and oligomers during transient expression and infection by sucrose gradient analysis, and

587

its oligomers have been proposed to correlate with stimulation of VLP production [52]. As with most

588

other miniproteins, with the notable exception of M2 from influenza, the definition of E protein as a

589

viroporin remains controversial.

590

Ion-channel activity invites the use of established channel blocking compounds as experimental

591

probes. HMA has exhibited inhibitory activity against E protein ion channels from various

592

coronaviruses, including MHV, HCoV-229E, SCV and FIPV, with a low micromolar range of EC50 [30,

593

62] as well as Vpu from HIV-1 [63] and p7 from HCV [64]. Interactions of HMA with the transmembrane

594

domain of SARS-CoV E protein have been previously examined by NMR [9, 10, 17, 18], and different

595

drug binding sites have been proposed based on the chemical shift perturbations observed for different

596

truncated E protein constructs and experimental conditions. The chemical shift perturbations we

597

observe in spectra of 75-residue full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in Fig 5 provide a more complete

598

picture of its interactions with HMA than is possible with 31- or 58- residue polypeptides. In addition, the

599

comparison of chemical shift perturbations of three SARS-CoV-2 E protein constructs, EF, ET, and EC,

600

in the presence of HMA clearly demonstrates that N-terminal residues 2-18 are affected by binding

601

HMA. In our spectra, signals from hydrophilic residues (S6, E7, E8, T9, T11, and N15) are strongly

602

affected by HMA. Minor perturbations of signals from residues in the C-terminal end of the trans-

603

membrane helix (residues 35-37) were observed in ET but not in EF and EC and are likely due to

604

nonspecific interactions from the truncated site. This contrasts with a prior result obtained on a

605

truncated E protein construct with residues 8-65 that showed large CSPs for V49 and L65 [18]. A

606

dramatic illustration that caution must be used when drug binding sites are mapped using truncated

607

constructs is an early study of M2 [65].

608

A ten-fold molar excess of amiloride and its derivatives DMA, HMA, and EIPA affect resonances

609

from the same set of amino acid residues in SARS-CoV-2 E protein, demonstrating that they utilize the

610

same binding site. With different CSP magnitudes, they display different binding affinities. Amiloride

611

itself did not induce any significant changes, DMA induced modest changes, and HMA and EIPA

612

induced the largest changes. Notably, the order of affinity of the compounds, EIPA ≈ HMA > DMA >>

613

amiloride, correlates well with their partition coefficient (logP) values: EIPA, 1.3; HMA, 1.3; DMA, 0.1,

614

and amiloride, -0.7 (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Therefore, introduction of bulky aliphatic or

615

aromatic moieties in the 5’ position of the amiloride pyrazine ring, which increases the lipophilicity of the

616

compounds, appears to increase their binding affinity for E protein. Most significantly, these findings

617

correlate well with the antiviral activities observed for these compounds in cultures of Vero E6 cells

618

infected with SARS-CoV-2. These data provide additional support for E protein being the likely in vivo

619

target of these compounds, and they suggest that inhibition of the ion channel activity may suppress

620

virus replication. Notably, the activity of EIPA and HMA for the Na+/K+ ATPase is higher than of

621

amiloride [66]. Therefore, structure-based optimization of target-selectivity will be necessary in order to

622

develop an amiloride-based drug aimed at E protein.

623

E protein not only stimulates viral assembly and release but also alters the secretory pathway of

624

the cell in a manner that preserves the function of the Spike protein [67]. Consequently, while

625

attributing the antiviral activity of the amilorides to assembly and release functions is tempting, these

626

compounds might also impair the infectivity of virions by inhibiting the "S-preserving" function of E

627

protein. The activities of the amilorides shown here under the conditions of high-multiplicity infection

628

suggest that much of their antiviral action is at a late-event in the replication cycle, consistent with a

629

block to assembly and release. Nonetheless, we have not fully excluded an effect, albeit modest, on

630

the infectivity of cell-free virus. Such an effect would be consistent with a partial loss of S activity in

631

mediating viral entry into target cells.

632

High-order oligomerization of IBV E protein has been proposed as a requirement for virus

633

assembly [52]. Although we do not observe changes in oligomeric states of N15A or V25F mutant E

634

proteins under our experimental conditions, comparisons of their CSPs suggests that the N15A

635

mutation but not the V25F mutation causes a significant change in the N-terminal region. The N15A

636

mutation affects the entire binding site and abolishes the interaction with HMA, demonstrating that

637

residue N15 plays a key role in maintaining SARS-CoV-2 E protein’s native conformation and its ability

638

to interact with HMA. N15 (or Q15) is highly conserved in alpha and beta coronavirus E proteins.

639

Moreover, a single Gln can mediate helix-helix associations through intermolecular hydrogen bonding

640

within transmembrane domains [68]. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving the sidechain of N15

641

may be essential for maintaining the conformation and orientation of the N-terminal region, a conclusion

642

also suggested by the pentameric model of the E protein oligomer [10]. The small CSPs induced by the

643

V25F mutation are localized near the mutation site indicating that the conformation of the mutant E

644

protein is preserved, which is consistent with its response to HMA being identical to that of the wild-type

645

E protein.

646

Interest in the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 E protein motivated the development of an

647

efficient new approach to the expression and purification of membrane proteins so that the full-length

648

protein could be studied. We demonstrate that HMA and EIPA bind to the N-terminal region of the E

649

protein and exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. We also found that residue N15 plays an

650

important role in maintaining the conformation of the HMA binding site, providing insight that might be

651

helpful in the design of drugs targeting E protein. Changes associated with the N15A and V25F

652

mutations are suggestive of involvement of E protein’s N-terminal domain in virus assembly and/or

653

release. These biological activities can be correlated with the secondary structure of E protein, which

654

consists of a long hydrophobic transmembrane helix with a large tilt angle between residues 8-43

655

separated by a slightly dynamic but still structured linker region to a second shorter helix between

656

residues 53-60 with a significantly different tilt angle. Determination of the three-dimensional structure

657

of E protein in phospholipid bilayers is an essential next step that should provide the structural

658

information required to not only understand the protein’s biological functions more fully, but also

659

optimize interactions with compounds that have the potential to be developed into antiviral drugs.

665

sequence was synthesized using the codons of highly expressed E. coli genes (S2 Fig)

(www.idtdna.com). The codon-optimized gene was inserted into a modified pET-31b(+) vector

was inserted between the KSI and E protein sequences (Fig 2A). The same expression and purification

system was used with two truncated constructs of E protein, the N-terminal transmembrane domain

(ET) (residues 1-39) and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (EC) (residues 36-75) (Fig 2B). Two EF

samples, the minimal medium with unlabeled ammonium sulfate was supplemented with 100–500 mg/L

680

of each of 19 amino acid residues and 100 mg/L of the 15N-labeled amino acid. The isotopically labeled

compounds were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (www.isotope.com). A preculture was

grown overnight in 50 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, then a 1% (v/v) aliquot of the preculture was

added to 500 mL of the minimal medium in a two-liter flask. The culture was maintained at 37oC with

and then 10-bed volumes of HPC washing buffer (0.05% HPC, 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM

703

imidazole, pH 7.8) (Fig 2C lane 4). The KSI-E protein fusion proteins were eluted with two-bed volumes

704

of HPC elution buffer (0.05% HPC, 20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.8).

705

The fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against thrombin

706

cleavage buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8) in a 10 kDa MW cutoff dialysis

707

membrane (www.spectrumchemical.com). Approximately 50 mg of uniformly 15N labeled KSI-E protein

708

fusion protein was obtained from 1L of culture (Fig 2C lane 5). 10 units of high-purity thrombin

709

(www.mpbio.com) per mg of fusion protein were added to the dialyzed solution and incubated overnight

710

at room temperature with gentle rotation (Fig 2C lane 6). Importantly, thrombin retains its specificity and

711

protease activity in the presence of dilute HPC. The mixture of thrombin-cleaved polypeptides was

712

loaded onto a Ni affinity column equilibrated with HPC binding buffer and the flowthrough containing the

713

target E protein was pooled. Typically, a yield of 10 mg of highly pure 15N-uniformly labeled E protein

714

was obtained from one liter of cell culture (Fig 2C lane 7). The TM domain of E (ET), the cytoplasmic

715

domain of E (EC), and the single-site mutants of EF, N15A and V25F, were all prepared following

716

essentially the same protocol and resulted in similar yields.

717

Electrophoresis

718

SDS-PAGE was performed using NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels in 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid

719

(MES) buffer at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie blue staining (Fig

720

2C). PFO (perfluorooctanoic acid)-PAGE was performed as previously described [32, 70] using Novex

721

4-20% Tris-Glycine gels without SDS. The NuPAGE and Novex precast gels were obtained from

722

Invitrogen (www.thermofisher.com). 5 µg protein samples in HPC binding buffer were mixed with the

723

same volume of the PFO sample buffer (100 mM Tris base, 4% (w/v) NaPFO (www.alfa.com), 20%

724

(v/v) glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, pH 8.0), vortex-mixed, centrifuged for five minutes at 12,000 xg

725

and then applied to the gel. PFO-PAGE was performed with a precooled PFO running buffer (25 mM

726

Tris base, 192 mM glycine, 0.5% (w/v) PFO, pH 8.5) at 120 V for 3.5 hours in a cold room at 4oC. The

727

protein bands were visualized by Coomassie blue staining (Fig 8D).

728

Sample preparation and NMR experiments

729

Samples for solution NMR experiments were prepared by concentrating the purified proteins with

730

Amicon Ultra-4 10K centrifugal filters (www.endmillipore.com). Samples of 0.5 mM uniformly 15N-

731

labeled and selectively 15N-Leu and 15N-Val labeled E protein in 5% (w/v) (123 mM) HPC, 20 mM

732

HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) 2H2O, 1 mM DSS, pH 6.5 were used for the two-dimensional 1H/15N

733

HSQC, 1H/15N HSQC-NOESY, 1H/15N heteronuclear NOE, and 1H/15N IPAP-HSQC experiments [71].

734

Samples of 1 mM uniformly 13C,15N-double labeled proteins in 7% (w/v) (172 mM) HPC, 20 mM

735

HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) 2H2O, 1 mM DSS, pH 6.5 were used for the three-dimensional HNCA,

736

HN(CO)CA, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments [56]. TCEP-HCl was added to the EF and EC

737

samples at a final concentration of 10 mM.

738

15

N-1H residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured by comparison of the 1JNH couplings of

739

isotropic and weakly aligned EF samples. Weak alignment was induced and maintained by addition of

740

Y21M fd bacteriophage to the protein-containing micelle solutions at a final concentration of 20 mg/mL

741

[72].

742

The NMR experiments were performed on triple-resonance Bruker Avance 800 and Avance 600

743

spectrometers at 50oC. The two-dimensional 1H/15N HSQC-NOESY data were obtained using 100 ms

744

and 200 ms mix times. 1H/15N heteronuclear NOE data were obtained with a recycle delay of 4 sec. 1H

745

chemical shifts were referenced to 0 ppm for DSS. The NMR data were processed and analyzed using

746

the computer programs Bruker Topspin 4 (www.bruker.com), NMRpipe/NMR Draw [73], and NMR View

747

[74].

748

Drug binding

749

100 mM stock solutions of amiloride, 5'-(N, N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride

750

(EIPA), and 5-(N, N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA) (www.caymanchem.com) were prepared by dissolving

751

the appropriate amount of solid material in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6).

752

To observe the chemical shift perturbations of protein resonances by these compounds, two-

753

dimensional 1H/15N HSQC spectra were obtained from samples containing 0.2 mM uniformly 15N-

754

labeled protein in the absence and presence of 2 mM amiloride, DMA, HMA, or EIPA. 1H/15N HSQC

755

spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled EC in the absence and presence of 2 mM HMA were also obtained.

756

757

present in the solution were obtained in order to track the chemical shift changes as a function of

758

concentration. All samples used in the binding experiments contained 2% (v/v) DMSO-d6 at pH 6.5 to

H/15N HSQC spectra of 0.2 mM uniformly 15N-labeled ET with 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mM HMA

ensure the absence of artifacts. The chemical shift perturbations were calculated using the equation

760

CSP = [(DdH)2+(0.2DdN)2]1/2, where DdH is the change in the backbone amide 1H chemical shift and DdN

761

is the change in backbone amide 15N chemical shift of an individual resolved and assigned resonance.

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral test of amilorides

763

Vero E6 and Caco-2 were obtained from ATCC and grown in DMEM (www.corning.com) with 10%

764

FBS, 10mM HEPES, and Penicillin-Streptomycin (www.thermofisher.com). SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-

765

WA1/2020 (www.beiresources.org) was propagated on Caco-2 cells and infectious units quantified by

766

focus forming assay using Vero E6 (ATCC) cells. Approximately 10e4 Vero E6 cells per well were

767

seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight. Compounds or controls were added at the indicated

768

concentrations with addition of SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) equal to 1 or 0.1 as

769

indicated in Figs 7 and 8. After incubation for 18 hr for MOI 1 or 48 hr for MOI 0.1 at 37°C and 5% CO2,

770

the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes at room

771

temperature. Formaldehyde fixed cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline and permeabilized

772

for immunofluorescence using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction

773

V (www.emdmillipore.com) and stained for SARS-CoV-2 with a primary anti-Nucleocapsid antibody

774

(www.genetex.com GTX135357) labeled with AlexaFluor 594. Cells were washed twice in PBS, and the

775

nuclei were stained with Sytox Green. Four to five images per well were obtained at 10x magnification

776

using an Incucyte S3 (Sartorius). The percent infected cells, nuclei count, and infected foci count were

777

calculated using built-in image analysis tools for the Incucyte S3. Foci were categorized as multi-cell

778

foci or single infected cell by repeating the analysis with area size restrictions in the red (nucleocapsid)

779

channel. IC50 and CC50 were determined using the nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism 9

780

with the bottom and top parameters constrained to 0 and 100, respectively. All work with authentic

781

SARS-CoV-2 was conducted under Biosafety Level-3 conditions at the University of California San

782

Diego. The reagent, SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, NR-52281 was deposited

783

by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH.

VLP assays

785

For SARS-CoV-2 proteins, dsDNA gene fragments (gBlocks) encoding human-codon optimized

786

sequences for M, E, and N-V5, corresponding to those of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate

787

(genbank MN908947.3), were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (www.idtdna.com). The

788

gene fragments were inserted into the pcDNA3.1(-) plasmid backbone between the NotI and EcoRI

789

restriction sites using In-Fusion Cloning (www.takarabio.com). The mutations in the transmembrane

790

region of the E protein were generated from the wild-type E protein construct using the QuikChange

791

site-directed mutagenesis kit (www.agilent.com) and verified by Sanger sequencing

792

(www.genewiz.com). HEK293T cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium

793

containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and penicillin-streptomycin.

794

HEK293T cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 250,000 cells/mL/well in complete

795

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM). The cells were transfected the following day with 500 ng

796

each of plasmids encoding the selected viral proteins and pcDNA2.3 plasmid backbone, using

797

Lipofectamine 2000 (www.thermofisher.com), according to the manufacturer’s protocol (3,200 ng total

798

plasmid/well). Twenty-four hr after transfection, the supernatant from each well was clarified by

799

centrifugation at 1,000 xg for 5 min at 4°C. Clarified supernatants were then pelleted through 20%

800

sucrose for 1 hr at 23,500 xg and 4°C. Pelleted VLPs and cells were lysed in 1X TSDS-PAGE sample

801

buffer containing TCEP 1X Laemmli buffer with 50 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine

802

(www.sigmaaldrich.com) substituted for 2-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates were boiled for 5 min prior to

803

use. Proteins in VLP and cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF

804

membranes, and immunoblotted with the following antibodies (Fig 7A): mouse monoclonal anti-V5 tag

805

(www.thermofisher.com, #R960-25), rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS M (generous gift of C. Machamer

806

H/15N double-resonance probe with a MAGC coli for the 1H channel and a solenoid coil for the 15N channel [78].

Uniformly 15N-labeled ET was embedded in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DMPC) bilayers oriented
with the lipid bilayer normal perpendicular to the applied magnetic field. The molar ratio of DMPC to ET is 395:1
and the DMPC concentration is 30% (w/v). Fast uniaxial rotational diffusion of both proteins about the bilayer
normal yielded motionally averaged single line resonances. The spectra in blue are 15N chemical shift projections
