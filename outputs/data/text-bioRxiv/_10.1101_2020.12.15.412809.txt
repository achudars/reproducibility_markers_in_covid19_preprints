Abstract: In this study, we developed ACE2-specific, peptide-derived

68

Ga-labeled

radiotracers, motivated by the hypotheses that (1) ACE2 is an important determinant of
SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and (2) that modulation of ACE2 in COVID-19 drives severe
organ injury.
Methods: A series of NOTA-conjugated peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor
DX600 were synthesized, with variable linker identity. Since DX600 bears two cystine
residues, both linear and cyclic peptides were studied. An ACE2 inhibition assay was
used to identify lead compounds, which were labeled with

68

Ga to generate peptide

radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP). The aminocaproate-derived radiotracer [68Ga]NOTAPEP4 was subsequently studied in a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic model.
Results: Cyclic DX-600 derived peptides had markedly lower IC50’s than their linear
counterparts. The three cyclic peptides with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene
glycol linkers had calculated IC50’s similar to, or lower than the parent DX600 molecule.
Peptides were readily labeled with

68

Ga, and the biodistribution of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4

was determined in a hACE2 transgenic murine cohort. Pharmacologic concentrations of
co-administered NOTA-PEP (“blocking”) showed significant reduction of [68Ga]NOTAPEP4 signals in the in the heart, liver, lungs, and small intestine. Ex vivo hACE2 activity
in these organs was confirmed as a correlate to in vivo results.
Conclusions: NOTA-conjugated, cyclic peptides derived from the known ACE2 inhibitor
DX600 retain their activity when N-conjugated for

68

Ga chelation. In vivo studies in a

transgenic hACE2 murine model using the lead tracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 showed
specific binding in the heart, liver, lungs and intestine - organs known to be affected in
SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 could be used to
detect organ-specific suppression of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected murine models and
COVID-19 patients.

Keywords: COVID-19, ACE2, SARS-CoV-2, ARDS, positron emission tomography

Introduction:
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has had profound effects on global health,
especially in the United States, the country with the largest number of confirmed COVID19 cases, and associated deaths. Many of these patients progress to Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure with widespread injury of the lungs. The
underlying mechanisms include diffuse alveolar damage, surfactant dysfunction, and
immune cell activation1–3. Of note, many pathologic conditions can cause this convergent
picture, including both bacterial and viral infections. These causes of ARDS likely share
dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system, especially loss of angiotensin converting
enzyme II (ACE2) function4–8. ACE2 is a transmembrane protein that functions as
angiotensin receptor (ATR) chaperone. The roles of ACE2, ACE, and angiotensin II are
highlighted in Figure 1A which describes dual functions of the renin-angiotensin system
with opposing effects on cardiovascular biology9. In this pathway, ACE2 performs an
important regulatory role, converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1,7 which causes
vasodilatation and has anti-inflammatory effect, unlike activation of ATR which will lead
to vasoconstriction, higher blood pressure and inflammation (potentially ARDS)10–13.
Although several recent papers suggest that other mammalian transmembrane
proteins (for example CD147 and CD26) allow SARS-C0V-2 to infect different cell
types14,15, ACE2 is the main point of entry of the virus into host cells (Figure 1B). This
process depends on this receptor as well as on its spike (S) protein, with cryo-EM and Xray crystal structures of the complex recently described, as well as characterization of
the complex via atomic force microscopy (Figure 1C)16–18. This protein has 2 subunitsS1 containing receptor binding domains (RBDs), and S2, which is responsible for
membrane fusion. The RBDs can mimic the ACE2 interaction with ATR (hydrophobic

and strong electrostatic interactions, including pi-pi, and cation-pi) and gain entry via
strong non-covalent attachment to ACE2 in the ATR binding site19. Three recent cryoEM studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly binds to ACE2 and
that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein likely recognizes human ACE2 with even higher
binding affinity than spike from SARS-CoV20–22. This binding was suggested to alter virus
configuration and expose a cleavage site on S2, resulting in host protease cleavage
(mainly by transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 - TMPRSS2), allowing
the virus to enter the cell23. This mechanism was recently supported by a cryo-EM post
fusion analysis that showed structural and conformational rearrangements of the Sprotein compared to its pre-fusion structure24.
To investigate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, and organ-specific suppression of
ACE2 in COVID-19, new ACE2-specific imaging methods would be profoundly helpful.
However, ACE2-specific small molecules and peptides developed following the original
2003 SARS-CoV outbreak (this virus also depends on ACE2 for viral entry) offer clues
as to how active-site targeted, high affinity ligands might be developed. A large number
of ACE2-specific ligands have been reported, generally characterized by their ACE2
IC50’s, and including the peptide DX600 discovered via phage display25–30. The DX600
sequence is shown in Figure 1D. In this manuscript, we report development of ACE2specific PET radiotracers ([68Ga]NOTA-PEP) derived from this sequence. We anticipate
that ACE2-specific PET could help evaluate which systems are most targeted by SARSCoV infection, the timing of disease, and how ACE2 modulation correlates with ARDS
susceptibility and other organ injury. Recent work has highlighted the role of ACE2 in a
large number of organs beyond the lungs, including the heart, kidneys, and
gastrointestinal system31–36. We therefore believe that the information gleaned from

[68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 or some other in vivo ACE2 sensor will potentially be helpful in
COVID-19 treatment, either via exogenous ACE24,37 or some other therapy.

Materials and Methods:
Peptides: The DX600-derived peptides studied were obtained from AnaSpec (Fremont,
CA) as a custom synthesis, fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry. These
peptides were radiolabeled without additional modification.
ACE2 inhibition assay: Six DX600-derived peptides, named NOTA-PEP1-6, (cyclic
versus non-cyclic, with triglycine, aminocaproate, and polyethylene glycol linkers) were
studied using a commercially available ACE2 inhibition assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (SensoLyte® 390 ACE2 Activity Assay Kit *Fluorimetric*, AS72086, AnaSpec, Fremont CA). Each peptide inhibitor was first tested at 4
concentrations. Initial velocities were determined relative to the inhibitor free reaction.
Subsequently, IC50 values were derived from nonlinear fits of saturation curves of a 6point dilution series of peptide inhibitors.
[68Ga] peptide synthesis: Full descriptions of radiochemical syntheses, as well as the
analytical techniques used, are provided in the Supplemental Information. Unless
otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained commercially and used without further
purification. [68Ga]gallium chloride was generated in the UCSF radiopharmaceutical
facility by elution from an ITG germanium-gallium generator. To generator eluted
[68Ga]Cl3 in a 4mL dilute HCl solution was added the indicated NOTA-PEP precursor
(80µg) in pH 5 sodium acetate buffer solution (160µL). The mixture was heated for 15
mins at 90oC. The reaction was monitored by TLC performed on cellulose filter paper
developed in PBS. Free gallium migrates to the solvent front (~90 mm) and bound
gallium remains at the origin (~20 mm).

μPET/CT imaging: All animal procedures were approved by the UCSF Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, and all studies were performed in accordance with
UCSF guidelines regarding animal housing, pain management, and euthanasia.
Humanized ACE2 recombinant mice (B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J, 034860, Jackson
Laboratory) were obtained from Jackson Labs, aged 6-10 weeks38–40. Single time-point
imaging: A tail vein catheter was placed in mice under isoflurane anesthesia.
Approximately 350 μCi of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 were injected via the tail vein catheter. The
animals were placed on a heating pad to minimize shivering. Mice were allowed to
recover, micturate, and at 75 minutes post-injection, placed back under isoflurane
anesthesia. At 90 mins post-injection, the animals were transferred to a Siemens Inveon
micro PET-CT system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), and imaged using a single static
25 min PET acquisition followed by a 10 min micro-CT scan for attenuation correction
and anatomical co-registration.

No adverse events were observed during or after

injection of any compound. Anesthesia was maintained during imaging using
isofluorane. Inhibition (“blocking”) studies: The protocol was identical to that above but
cold NOTA-derived inhibitory cyclic peptide (NOTA-PEP4) (10mg/mL concentration) was
co-administered with [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 in buffered saline. Dynamic imaging: The
protocol was similar to above except tail-vein administration of 350 μCi of [68Ga]NOTAPEP4 was performed simultaneously on a cohort of 4 animals in bed positioning for PET
imaging. PET imaging data was collected beginning at the moment of injection for 90
minutes followed by 10-minute CT.
Ex vivo analyses of mice: Upon completion of imaging, mice were sacrificed and
biodistribution analysis performed. Gamma counting of harvested tissues was performed
using a Hidex Automatic Gamma Counter (Turku, Finland). Organs were also harvested
from a separate cohort of mice for an ACE2 activity assay.

The tissues were

homogenized and aliquots were used for protein concentration using a standard
Bradford assay.

Additional tissue aliquots were used as the source of ACE2 in a

commercially available ACE2 assay (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA). The initial velocities were
normalized relative to muscle tissue. Relative activities are reported as the relative initial
velocity/g of protein.
Data analysis and statistical considerations: For syntheses, radiochemical yields
incorporate decay-correction for

68

Ga (t1/2=68 min). All in vivo PET data were viewed

using open source Amide software (amide.sourceforge.net). Reported static (single timepoint data) reflects gamma counting of harvested tissues. For dynamic data,
quantification of uptake was performed by drawing spherical regions of interest (5-8
mm3) over indicated organs on the CT portion of the exam, and expressed as percent
injected dose per gram. All statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.
Data were analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. All graphs are
depicted with error bars corresponding to the standard error of the mean.
Results:
NOTA-conjugated, cyclic peptides targeting the ACE2 active site retain their
potency relative to the DX600 parent compound. Based on our hypothesis that potent
peptide-derived ACE2 inhibitors, modified with linkers/chelating groups will retain their
activity and specificity, several NOTA-modified peptide-derived ACE2 inhibitors derived
from the DX600 sequence29 (Ki = 2.8 nM, Kd = 10.8 nM) were synthesized and screened
for ACE2 inhibition. These were synthesized via Fmoc-protected linkers and N-capping
NOTA reagents (Figure 2A,B). The general structure pursued was a NOTA-linkerpeptide with three different linkers used, conferring varying degrees of hydrophobicity
and hydrogen bonding: triglycine, PEG, or caproic acid. These were synthesized using
standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis41 (AnaSpec, Fremont CA) with purity and identity

confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Because DX600 contains two cysteine
residues, a cyclized set of peptides were also synthesized via disulfide bridge
formation42. When these compounds were compared to the parent DX600 peptide in a
commercially available fluorometric ACE2 inhibition assay (AnaSpec), all three cyclic
peptides (NOTA-PEP2, NOTA-PEP4, NOTA-PEP6) showed ACE2 inhibition nearly
identical to DX600 (Figure 2C,D,E). In other words, the N-terminal modification caused
no loss of inhibitory activity when compared to the parent peptide, and in fact the cyclic
peptide NOTA-PEP4 was a slightly better ACE2 inhibitor than DX600. In contrast, the
linear derivatives showed much lower activity, which may result from a solution
confirmation for which the NOTA interferes with ACE2 active site binding. To further
evaluate this loss of potency, we studied ACE2 inhibition using a cyclic NOTA-PEP with
and without addition of the reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) which
is expected to reduce the disulfide bridge in the cyclic peptide (producing the linear
NOTA-PEP5) (Figure 2F. Supp. Fig. 1). As anticipated, addition of TCEP markedly
increased the observed ACE2 IC50.
Efficient radiosyntheses of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP peptides. Promising ACE2 inhibition
results for NOTA-conjugated cyclic peptides were followed with radiolabeling of peptides

(Supp. Fig. 2). Crude radiochemical purities of the desired [68Ga]-peptide

chelate were > 90% in all cases. The majority of synthetic efforts focused on optimizing
the radiosynthesis of the lead inhibitor [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4.

[68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was

synthesized in 30mins from generator eluted [68Ga]Cl3 in a 4mL dilute HCl solution. The
precursor (80µg) was added as a pH 5 acetate buffer solution (160µL) and heated for 15
mins at 90oC. Radio TLC (Figure 3A) was performed on cellulose filter paper developed
in PBS. The final radiochemical purity of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was > 95% in all cases with
a decay-adjusted radiochemical yield of 63.2 ± 6.4% (N = 8).

[68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 signals in the lungs, heart, small intestine and liver of hACE2
transgenic mice are attenuated with co-administration of inhibitory cyclic peptide.
Having developed a radiosynthesis of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4, we sought to further validate
the tracer in a transgenic, humanized ACE2 (hACE2) murine model. The K18-hACE2
transgenic mice express human ACE2 under the control of the human keratin 18
promoter, which directs expression to epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where
infections typically begin38. Preliminary studies available from the Jackson Laboratory
website, and recently published studies44 have shown that K18-hACE2 transgenic mice
develop dose-dependent disease phenotypes when infected intranasally with SARSCoV-2 with high doses resulting in ARDS/death analogous to that observed in some
COVID-19 patients. Male Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J hemizygous mice (N = 4, Jackson
Lab) were initially injected with 13.0 MBq (350 µCi) of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 and dynamic
imaging was performed to identify optimum single time-point imaging. Region of interest
(ROI) analysis of dynamic data was focused on organs known to be affected in SARSCoV-2 (Figure 3B, Supp. Fig. 3). ROI analysis of the images demonstrated prompt
clearance from the blood pool with accumulation in the kidneys, as expected for a small
peptide tracer.
Next, we performed an imaging and biodistribution study, to show that
[68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 demonstrates specific uptake in tissues with increased expression of
ACE2. In order to demonstrate specificity of uptake, blocking with excess cyclic NOTAPEP inhibitory peptide was employed. With blocking, significant reductions in cyclic
[68Ga]NOTA-PEP4

were seen in the heart (p = 0.0203), lung (p <0.0001), liver (p

<0.0001) and small intestine (p = 0.0002). ACE2 activity in these organs was
subsequently confirmed via harvested organs in a separate hACE2 cohort (N = 3, Supp.
Fig. 4). Taken together, these data demonstrate that [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 can specifically

bind to tissues with high ACE2 expression.
Discussion:
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly throughout the world with
the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in the United States. Both
biochemical studies and published cryo-EM structures have shown that the spike protein
(S-protein) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
predominantly uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry,
resulting in suppression of this enzyme as seen in SARS-CoV45,46. Additional recent
publications have highlighted the possibility that the lower ACE2 activity seen with
SARS-CoV-2 infection may be responsible for the physiologic effects incurred,
analogous to what was seen with the original SARS-CoV46. These observations support
recombinant ACE2-derived therapies as a way to treat COVID-19, via two mechanisms:
(1) by replenishing “protective” ACE2 function and (2) by serving as a “decoy” receptor
for the virus. These therapeutic effects, the differential susceptibility of individuals (based
on age, co-morbidities) to COVID-19, and the organ-specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 are
all potentially addressed by an ACE2-specific imaging method. We therefore sought a
PET tracer derived from known inhibitor structures, via modification of the known ACE2
inhibitory peptide DX600 with 68Ga.
Inhibitor-derived structures modified for PET do not necessarily recapitulate the
potency of their parent compounds, so our first efforts focused on the “cold” NOTAconjugated DX600 derived peptides, derived from triglycine, caproic acid, and PEG
linkers. Gratifyingly, the DX600-derived cyclic peptides studied all showed ACE2 activity
similar to the parent peptide. In contrast, the linear versions were relatively inactive,
which may reflect conformational effects. Of note, the calculated IC50 of DX600
(standard included in AnaSpec assay kit) was > 1 order of magnitude higher than the Ki

reported by Huang et al.29, likely reflecting numerous experimental differences (enzyme
concentration and activity, etc.). We therefore considered the IC50 of the NOTA-derived
peptides relative to that of DX600 to be the most important determinant of successful
PET probe development. Indeed, our lead cyclic peptide NOTA-PEP4 had an IC50 lower
than that of the DX600 parent, motivating the radiolabeling of NOTA-PEP4 for
subsequent imaging studies.
A high-yield and efficient synthesis of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 was developed with the
tracer applied to a hACE2 transgenic model. Our studies co-injecting a pharmacologic
concentration of NOTA-PEP inhibitor with [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 showed significant
attenuation of PET signals in the lungs, liver, heart, and small intestine- suggesting that
these signals were related to ACE2 expression. Consistent with this observation, ex vivo
tissue-specific ACE2 activity was observed in these organs, which are affected in
COVID-1947,48. Modulation of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 using an ACE2 inhibitor also suggests
that changes in ACE2 expression can be detected non-invasively. Additionally, ex vivo
tissue analysis showed metabolically activity ACE2 expression in the kidneys despite the
absence of strong “blocking.”

The tissue accumulation of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 in the

kidneys suggests a dominant renal excretion pathway, complicating our ability to detect
hACE2 in this tissue49. In other words, high background signal due to the normal
excretion pathway of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 may represent a limitation of this method to
detect ACE2 activity in the kidney.

In the future, hACE2 expression-specific

[68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 signals versus background excretion needs to be further clarified,
perhaps using koACE2 animals50 in addition to the inhibitory studies described in this
manuscript.
The in vivo studies performed also reflect a limitation of most academic centers
in the United States; specifically, few facilities have a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3)
compatible μPET-CT imaging system. Future molecular imaging of live SARS-CoV-2 (a

BSL-3 organism) and its host effects will therefore require collaborative work with those
few centers able to accommodate these studies51. Given the history of ACE2 with
respect to SARS-CoV (the 2003 SARS coronavirus) and ARDS, we expect that new
ACE2-specific PET tools will be relevant beyond the current pandemic. We are partially
motivated by data indicating that zoonotic infections especially coronavirus-related are
on the rise52. The incidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic disease is increasing
in many parts of the world, with animal viruses able to cross species barriers to infect
humans; it appears likely that ACE2 will be relevant in future pandemics. Better
understanding ACE2 suppression, and differential susceptibility to SARS-COV-2 will
help us better treat COVID-19 and other diseases for which ACE2 plays a critical role.
Conclusions:
Our study shows that the ACE2 active site-targeted inhibitor DX600 can be modified for
PET via NOTA/linker modification, without loss of activity for cyclized peptides. All
peptides studied are readily radiolabeled with

68

Ga. In a humanized ACE2 transgenic

murine model, the lead radiotracer [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 shows dominant excretion from
the kidneys, with attenuated uptake in the lungs, liver, heart, and small intestine when an
ACE2 inhibitor is co-administered. These results suggest that modulation of ACE2, as
occurring in SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be detected using [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 or related
approaches. Future studies include application of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 to SARS-CoV-2
infected hACE2 mice.

Figures and Legends:

Figure 1. Role of ACE2 in hypertension and SARS-CoV-2 infection. (a) The reninangiotensin system. The role of ACE2 highlighted on the right; ACE2 generally counters
the “vasoconstrictive” pathway initiated by the formation of angiotensin II. (b) Simplified
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus indicating the spike glycoprotein that interacts with
ACE2 and other host proteins. (c) Structural (cryoEM, X-ray crystallography) and atomic
force microscopy have elucidated the interaction between the spike protein S1 subunit
and ACE2. Of note S1 binds to an ACE2 site remote to its active site, which is targeted
by the inhibitory peptides described in this manuscript. Images adapted from Yang et al.

calculated KD of 10.8 nM, and specificity for ACE2 versus angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) and carboxypeptidase A (CPA).

Figure 2. Discovery of DX600-derived, NOTA-conjugated cyclic peptide inhibitors
of ACE2 from a small library. (a) General [68Ga] peptide structure pursued. Peptides
studied had an N-terminal NOTA chelating group, triglycine/caproic acid/PEG linkers
with varying degrees of hydrophobicity and hydrogen-bonding, and +/- cyclization via the
cysteine residues highlighted in red. (b) Identity of 6 NOTA-conjugated peptides studied.
(c) ACE2 catalytic efficiency in the presence of DX600-derived inhibitors. Cyclic peptides
were markedly more potent than their linear counterparts. (d) Greater potency of the
cyclic peptides are highlighted by the initial ACE2 velocities seen with increasing
inhibitor concentrations. All cyclic peptides (NOTA-PEP2, NOTA-PEP4, NOTA-PEP6)

had similar profiles to the parent peptide DX600, in contrast to linear peptide NOTAPEP1. (e) The effects of cyclization were highlighted in a separate ACE2 assay using
TCEP to reduce the disulfide bridges in NOTA-PEP6. (f) ACE2 IC50’s calculated from
these data. Of note these IC50’s are significantly higher than the Ki’s reported by Huang
et al. for DX600, likely reflecting differences in the assays used. However, most
importantly NOTA-conjugated cyclic derivatives had no loss of potency relative to the
DX600 parent.

Figure 3. Radiosynthesis and in vivo dynamic characterization of [68Ga]NOTAPEP4. Based on IC50 data, NOTA-PEP4 was chosen for subsequent radiolabeling with
68

Ga. (a) Our optimized radiosynthesis yielded the desired [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 in greater

than 95% radiochemical purity. (b) Dynamic μPET-CT in hACE2 transgenic mice was
used to generate an organ-specific time-activity curve, identifying later time points as
generating stable [68Ga] signals.

Figure 4. In vivo biodistribution studies of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4 in hACE2 transgenic
mice, demonstrating modulation of signals with a pharmacologic dose of ACE2
inhibitor. (a) μPET-CT image from a static acquisition highlighting the signal
corresponding to the lungs, which are of exceptional interest in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
(b) Biodistribution studies with and without the presence of an ACE2 inhibitor. The
highest signals were observed in the kidneys, but the observed %ID/g was not
significantly lower in the presence of ACE2 inhibitor. Therefore renal signals are felt to
represent the primary route of excretion. (c) Significant blocking of [68Ga]NOTA-PEP4
was seen in the heart, lungs, liver, and small intestine, organs implicated in COVID-19.
