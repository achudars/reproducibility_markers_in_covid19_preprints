ABSTRACT

21

The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through interaction of its spike protein

22

(SARS2-S)

23

Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We compared the

24

requirements of ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and the sensitivity to inhibitors for

25

SARS2-S-mediated

26

moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while SARS1-S-driven fusion was

27

strongly dependent on activation by TMPRSS2 and less so on ACE2 expression. In contrast to

28

SARS1-S, SARS2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion was efficiently activated by Batimastat-sensitive

29

metalloproteases. Mutation of the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site reduced effector-target-

30

cell

31

fusion more dependent on TMPRSS2. When both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundant, initial

32

target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered compared to wt SARS2-S, but syncytia remained

33

smaller over time. Mutation of the S2’ site specifically abrogated activation by TMPRSS2 for

34

both cell-cell fusion and SARS2-S-driven pseudoparticle entry but still allowed for activation

35

by metalloproteases for cell-cell fusion and by cathepsins for particle entry. Finally, we found

36

that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Bromhexine was unable to reduce TMPRSS2-activated cell-cell

37

fusion

INTRODUCTION

61

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease spectrum is caused by the severe acute

62

respiratory

63

patients with pneumonia of unknown origin in the city of Wuhan, China (1). While first

64

characterized as a pneumonia, COVID-19 probably affects a number of organ systems (2–4).

65

SARS-CoV-2

66

receptor for the closely related SARS-CoV (5), for the infection of human cells (1, 6, 7). For

67

the

68

coronaviruses (reviewed in (8)), the transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2)

69

(7, 9) as well as the related TMPRSS4 (2) were reported to be of critical importance. In

70

addition,

71

therefore may be biologically particularly relevant. Depending on the cell type, SARS-CoV-2

72

spike-driven entry can also occur through endocytotic pathways where virus-cell fusion is

73

most likely activated by cathepsins (7). Another study reported that several members of the

74

TMPRSS

75

proposed mechanisms for spike priming and initiation of fusion therefore require further

76

clarification, e.g. whether serine protease activity is required under all circumstances, or

77

whether fusion can also occur without the action of serine proteases, where these proteases

78

act on the spike, and whether there are differences between cell-cell and cell-particle fusion.

79

It was recently discovered that the polybasic S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 is required

80

for efficient infection of lung-derived cells (12) and promotes the formation of syncytia.

81

Understanding

82

reported to constitute a hallmark of COVID-19-associated pathology (13). Nevertheless, the

83

exact contribution of the two known proteolytic priming sites to cell-cell fusion and their

84

protease usage are not entirely clear. To address these questions, we mutated the S1/S2 site

85

as well as the S2’ site, we assessed the effects of proteolytic activation by using inhibitors of

86

TMPRSS2 and other proteases, and we analyzed the effects of different levels of protease

87

and receptor expression on SARS1-S and SARS2-S fusion activity.

88

TMPRSS2, which is expressed in airway cells (14), may be amenable to specific inhibition by

89

Bromhexine (15), a molecule normally used as an expectorant that thins phlegm and eases

90

coughing and is widely known as a popular over-the-counter medication, which would make

92

Bromhexine is now being tested in at least three clinical trials for efficacy against COVID-19

93

(NCT04355026, NCT04273763, NCT04340349). We therefore tested the effect of the specific

110

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates robust fusion of 293T cells transfected with ACE2 with

111

112

In order to investigate the fusion mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein we generated

113

several

114

mutation of the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS2-S plays a role in infection of airway cells like

115

Calu-3 but is dispensable in other cell types (11, 12). Thus, we generated a mutant called

116

S1/S2 where the furin-recognition motif and the cleavage site were replaced by alanines (Fig

117

1 A). In contrast to already published S1/S2 mutants (24, 25) we did not delete the site as we

118

suspected that this may influence protein conformation and flexibility but we mutated the

119

proposed furin cleavage site (26) to fully abrogate processing at this site. Clearly detectable

120

bands of lower molecular weight, indicative of proteolytic processing, were only observed

121

with wt SARS2-S (Fig. 1 B). As expected, the S1/S2-mutant exhibited no processing at the

122

S1/S2 site indicated by a missing S2 fragment in Western Blot from transfected 293T lysate

123

(Fig. 1 B). This is similar to the SARS-1-spike (SARS1-S) which has no furin cleavage site at this

124

position. We furthermore generated an S2’ site mutant by exchanging the K814 and the

125

R815 to alanine. The S2’ site was shown to be important for proteolytic priming in SARS1-S

126

and is highly conserved among coronavirus spikes (27). We therefore suspected that this site

127

is

135

In order to study spike mediated cell-cell fusion, we established a quantitative reporter gene

assay. We chose 293T cells as effector cells, i.e. the cell expressing the viral glycoproteins,

137

because i) 293T exhibit high transfection efficiency and protein expression and ii) 293T can

138

be lifted without trypsinization. We resorted to a system that is also used for two-hybrid

139

screenings, using a VP16-Gal4 transcription factor in one cell and a Gal4-response element-

140

driven

141

reporter gene expression after cell-cell fusion. We transfected 293T target cells with ACE2

The S1/S2 site is critical for syncytium size.

Our results demonstrated mostly normal fusion activity of the S1/S2 mutant in our system

165

when TMPRSS2 was present. Therefore, we wanted to address how mutation of the S1/S2

166

site

167

demonstrated that the S1/S2 site is important for this process (24, 26). It should be noted

168

that initial cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation may not necessarily be the exact same

169

thing. After the initial fusion event, all factors that were originally present in separate cells,

174

TMPRSS2 the S1/S2 mutant formed small but numerous syncytia, while wt SARS2-S formed

175

larger syncytia (Fig. 1 F). Reporter activity was comparable. Formation of extended syncytia

176

is obviously a quality that our luciferase reporter does not capture, and interestingly, this is

177

not a matter of the timing of the measurement (Fig 1 E), as even at earlier time points, the

178

luciferase activity between wt and the S1/S2 mutant as well as SARS1-S were similar. We

conclude that our luciferase assay measures primarily the initial fusion between effector and

changes in TMPRSS2 levels. The SARS2-S1/S2-mut on the other hand exhibited an interesting

194

behavior in that it exhibited reduced fusion activity when either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were

195

absent but was fully fusion competent in all conditions in between, with probably a slight

196

trend towards highest activity with comparatively low TMPRSS2 levels, similar in that respect

197

to SARS1-S. The respective protein levels as present at the end of the co-culture are shown

198

in Fig. 2 B. We labelled the fully processed S2 fragment with an asterisk, as the exact nature

199

of this fragment can’t be deduced with full confidence from its apparent molecular size,

Differential effect of the TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat, Bromhexine, and the Bromhexine

metabolite Ambroxol on SARS1-S and SARS2-S-mediated fusion.

207

For a comprehensive analysis, we measured fusion with target cells that were co-transfected

208

with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression plasmids, in addition to cells transfected with either

209

ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression plasmid alone. As fusion effectors, SARS1-S, SARS2-S as well as

210

SARS2-S1/S2-mut and SARS2-S2’-AA were included. To test the effects of TMPRSS2 inhibition

211

by small molecules on the activation of wt SARS2-S and the two mutants as well as SARS1-S,

212

we incubated the different target cells with Bromhexine, reportedly a specific inhibitor of

213

TMPRSS2 (15), the chemically related compound

214

inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and many serine proteases in general (29, 30), at 50 µM (Fig. 3 A). We

215

chose this high concentration, which is most likely outside of any therapeutic range except

216

for Ambroxol, as overexpression of TMPRSS2 may shift the EC50 considerably upwards.

217

As observed before (Fig. 1 D), in the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, both SARS1-S and

218

SARS2-S exhibited strong fusion activity, as did the SARS2-S1/S2-mut protein. SARS2-S2’-AA

219

on the other hand was strongly impaired under these conditions.

220

ACE2 expression alone was sufficient for induction of high fusion activity of SARS2-S but

221

induced only moderate activity of SARS1-S. Levels of ACE2 expression were higher in single-

222

transfected cells (Fig.

223

stating

224

Western blot, in addition to potential competition effects between expression plasmids.

225

Nevertheless, SARS2-S-driven fusion was clearly not limited by TMPRSS2 expression, and

226

reached highest activity when only ACE2 was expressed. The S1/S2 cleavage site mutant of

227

SARS-CoV-2 on the other hand exhibited reduced activation in the presence of ACE2 without

228

additional

229

detectable fusion activity when ACE2 was overexpressed. Overexpression of TMPRSS2 did

230

not increase fusion activity of SARS-S2’-AA. Conversely, SARS1-S-driven fusion was clearly

231

more enhanced by overexpression of TMPRSS2 than by overexpression of ACE2, reaching

232

highest activity under conditions where only TMPRSS2 was recombinantly expressed, and

233

was only weakly activated by ACE2 expression in the absence of recombinant TMPRSS2

234

expression (Fig. 2 A and 3 A).

235

We observed that cell-cell fusion by SARS1-S and SARS2-S was not inhibited by Bromhexine,

236

and only SARS1-S activity was slightly inhibited by Ambroxol in the presence of TMPRSS2.

conditions, if generation of the fully processed S2 fragment is analyzed, which we labelled

346

The SARS2-S S2’ site is the TMPRSS2 target site

347

While our results with the SARS2-S2’-AA mutant were already strongly suggestive of S2’

348

being the target site for TMPRSS2, this conclusion remained slightly ambiguous in light of the

349

relatively low surface expression and inefficient proteolytic processing of this mutant (Fig. 1

350

B and C). We therefore set out to generate an S2’ mutant that is still efficiently processed

351

and expressed at the cell surface. We permutated several amino acids to replace the original

352

“KR” (Fig. 1 A) sequence motif and tested fusion activity in the presence of ACE2, TMPRSS2

353

and ACE2/TMPRSS2. We found that SARS2-S2’-GH and HH mutants were active in our fusion

354

assay, whereas EE and ES resulted in abrogation of fusion activity, below the levels achieved

355

with

356

expressed at the cell surface, and exhibited high ACE2 binding capacity (Fig. 6 C). For further

357

experiments, we continued with the SARS2-S2’-GH mutant. Interestingly, when we tested

358

the furin inhibitor CMK for its effects in absence of TMPRSS2, all spike variants were slightly

359

less

360

dependence on pre-priming by furin in absence of the S2’ site (Fig. 6 D).

361

Confirming the results of our prior fusion assays with the AA mutant, also the SARS2-S2’-GH

362

and SARS-S2’-HH fusion activity on 293T cells in the presence of only ACE2 were sensitive to

363

Batimastat (Fig. 6 E, left), and on 293T cells expressing ACE2/TMPRSS2 both SARS2-S2’-GH

364

and SARS-S2’-HH were insensitive to Camostat, but again highly sensitive to Batimastat (Fig.

365

6 E, right). Fusion activity of the S2 mutants was even increased in the presence of Camostat,

366

likely because inhibition of TMPRSS2 increases ACE2 levels, as demonstrated in Fig. 3 B. This

367

unequivocally identifies the S2’ site as the TMPRSS2 target site, and interestingly as the only

TMPRSS2 expression was clearly required for efficient infection of 293T cells by SARS2-S-

considerably less efficiently and barely above the detection limit, which may be owed to our

387
388

Mutation of the S2’ site uncouples infection from TMPRSS2

389

Next, we aimed to corroborate our findings regarding the S2’ site as TMPRSS2 target site for

390

cell-cell-fusion in particle infection. Our SARS2-S2’-GH mutant was efficiently incorporated

391

into lentiviral particles, as was SARS2-S1/S2-mut (Fig. 7 D). Both spike mutants could drive

392

entry into 293T cells expressing ACE2/TMPRSS2, but SARS2-S2’-GH with reduced efficiency

393

and SARS2-S1/S2-mut probably with increased efficiency, although we did not test for the

394

latter. None of the spike variants was inhibited by Batimastat. The wt and S1/S2 mutants

395

were inhibited by Camostat, but not by Batimastat or E64D, indicating proteolytic activation

396

by TMPRSS2. The S2’ mutant on the other hand was exclusively inhibited by E64D, indicating

397

that it was refractory to activation by TMPRSS2 and dependent on activation by Cathepsins.

399

SARS-CoV-2 is weakly inhibited by Ambroxol on Calu-3 lung cells

400

As transfected 293T cells express TMPRSS2 at high and possibly variable levels between cells

401

and allow for at least some entry via endocytosis, weak modulatory effects on ACE2 or

402

TMPRSS2 might be missed in that system. Calu-3 express TMPRSS2 to much higher levels

403

than

404

therefore infected the Calu-3 lung cell line with our lentiviral pseudoparticles (Fig. 8 B).

405

These cells allow for infection by our lentiviral pseudoparticles only at very low levels (not

406

shown). In order to achieve infection at faithfully detectable levels, we used the D614G

407

variant, which exhibited the same sensitivity profile to inhibitors but was about one log

408

more efficient at driving entry (Fig. 7 C). D614G by now has become the dominant variant

409

globally and is therefore probably also more relevant. As expected, SARS2-S-driven entry

410

was practically abrogated by 50µM Camostat. Bromhexine again had no detectable impact

411

on SARS2-S-driven entry. Ambroxol on the other hand exhibited a weakly inhibitory effect on

412

SARS2-S-driven

450

In our system, TMPRSS2 co-expression on ACE2 expressing target cells was not required for

451

SARS2-S-mediated fusion of 293T cells comparable with results of Ou et al. where ACE2

452

expression alone was also sufficient to induce cell-cell fusion without addition of exogenous

453

protease (11), and also corroborated by a very recent report (41). Furthermore, we did not

454

observe

455

target cells by the serine protease inhibitor Camostat. Together, these results imply that

456

proteolytic activation by TMPRSS2 may not be a limiting factor for cell-cell fusion in 293T

457

cells. A recent report demonstrated that upon co-transfection of spike, ACE2, and TMPRSS2,

473

recombinantly expressed TMPRSS2, SARS2-S1/S2-mut was clearly impaired with regard to

474

fusion activity (Fig. 2 A). Conversely, mutation of the S2’ priming site abrogated any effects

described in the literature for SARS-CoV (43). Whatever the reason for this defect, we were

able to overcome it completely by replacing the S2’ motif KR with the amino acids GH, which

489

restored surface expression (Fig. 6 C) and processing into S1 and S2 (Fig. 6 B), and particle

490

incorporation (Fig. 7 D). The reasons for this phenomenon are unclear. Charge reversal of S2’

491

from KR to EE was definitely detrimental to activity, indicating that solubility may not be the

critical point. As histidine may carry a positive charge depending on the local environment,

Our results clearly demonstrate that cleavage at the S1/S2 site alone is not sufficient for

fusion activity in the presence of ACE2 and likely requires additional processing at S2’ or

497

another site (26). This has been established for particle entry (24), but it was not entirely

498

clear for cell-cell fusion, as the pre-cleaved spike was clearly fusogenic also in conditions

511

As SARS2-S did not require TMPRSS2 on target cells for robust cell-cell fusion, our attempts

512

to test the impact of Bromhexine as a specific inhibitor of TMPRSS2 on SARS2-S-mediated

513

fusion activity were somewhat artificial. Nevertheless, SARS1-S-mediated fusion was clearly

516

specifically enhanced fusion of 293T cells in the presence of SARS2-S, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 is

517

something that we cannot explain easily. According to our results the Bromhexine-mediated

518

enhancement was specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and was not seen with VSV-G as

519

fusion effector (Fig. 3 C), nor did we observe significant effects with the SARS2-S mutants

520

and SARS1-S (Fig. 3 A). We observed some inhibition of SARS1-S-mediated fusion in the

521

presence of 50µM Ambroxol (Fig. 3 A) and also with SARS2-S with longer incubation times

522

(Fig. 3 C), which may hint at some activity of this substance against TMPRSS2, which would

523

fit with the observation of an atypical autoproteolytic fragment of TMPRSS2 in the presence

524

of Ambroxol. The observation of the paradoxical effect of Bromhexine in the presence of

525

TMPRSS2 suggests that Bromhexine somehow modulates proteolytic processing. It is at the

526

moment not clear by what mechanism of action Bromhexine modulates TMPRSS2 activity, if

527

it does so, and we therefore cannot exclude that processing of some substrates is actually

535

TMPRSS2 were coexpressed (Figs. 3 A, 5 A).

536

Compared

537

SARS2-S-mediated fusion appearing less dependent on activation by TMPRSS2. This could be

538

due to differences in the protocol. The study by Yamamoto et al. allowed only for very short

539

contact times of 4h and used non-adherent 293T FT cells, whereas we cocultured the cells

540

for a longer time, which allows for extended contact between cells and may enable the

541

action of matrix metalloproteases. Our finding that TMPRSS2 is not required for fusion is in

542

line with several reports making the same observation (11, 24, 26, 41, 42, 46). In general, we

543

observed

544

observed with furin cleavage site mutants in previous studies (12, 26), but we observed this

545

only when TMPRSS2 was recombinantly overexpressed together with ACE2. When only ACE2

548

the

structure, which may result in a less flexible conformation. Nevertheless, our mutational

approach

dependent on additional serine protease activity by recombinantly expressed TMPRSS2. This

552

proteolytic activity was directed towards the S2’ site, as SARS2-S1/S2-mut fusion activity was

dependent

554

presence of TMPRSS2.

555

Taken together, our results actually reconcile several seemingly conflicting observations by

556

other groups. The strong reduction in fusion activity by mutation of the S1/S2 site observed

557

in one study in Vero (12) is reflected in our experimental conditions with only TMPRSS2 and

558

endogenous levels of ACE2 expression, whereas our findings of more or less normal fusion

activity under conditions

560

findings of another group with ACE2 overexpressing cells and addition of Trypsin or HAT

562

Overall,

563

related protease and receptor expression are to a certain degree interdependent, where one

564

factor

565

activation at S2’ can render the spike more fusogenic even with lower receptor levels, which

566

was particularly observed for SARS1-S, and to a lesser degree for SARS2-S (Fig. 2). Similarly,

567

Batimastat-sensitive metalloproteases can activate SARS2-S for cell-cell fusion (Fig. 5 A). This

is

absence of TMPRSS2 but completely independent of the S2’ site, as demonstrated by full

570

fusion activity of the SARS2-S2’-GH spike mutant on ACE2 expressing 293T cells (Fig. 6 A).

571

According to our results the requirements for cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion differ:

572

Additional TMPRSS2 activity drastically enhanced pseudotype entry into transfected 293T

573

(Fig. 7 A) but was not needed for cell-cell fusion with identically transfected 293T cells (Figs.

not in our experimental system. Similar observations were previously made for SARS-CoV

578

(34). The interpretation of these results is complicated by the ability of virus particles to

enter cells through both direct membrane fusion or through an endocytotic pathway, and by

580

592

TMPRSS2. A recent small randomized trial showed promising results for Bromhexine at 3x

593

8 mg per day combined with hydroxychloroquine (48), which should result in Bromhexine

594

plasma concentrations in the range of 0.1 µM (49). We are fairly confident to postulate that

595

these favorable results are unlikely due to inhibition of TMPRSS2, although we can’t fully

596

exclude extremely weak activity. This view is supported by a recent study that found no

597

effect of Bromhexine on TMPRSS2 activity (30). More likely, favorable patient outcomes are

598

attributable to the beneficial effects of Bromhexine or its main metabolite Ambroxol on lung

599

function, general defense mechanisms against airway infections, and inflammatory response

600

(16–19, 50). Another recent study by Olaleye et al (51) specifically analyzed the effects of

601

Bromhexine and Ambroxol on the interaction of ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor

602

binding domain (RBD), and reported a very peculiar behavior of these substances which in

603

part may explain the paradoxic results of our fusion assays and would support a beneficial

604

effect of low-dose Bromhexine, which is converted to Ambroxol in vivo: While Ambroxol

609

shown to moderately impact replication of SARS-CoV-2 in that report (22), albeit on Vero

610

cells and not lung cells. Our results suggest that Ambroxol can weakly inhibit spike-driven

611

entry

612

concentrations (Fig. 8 B), and our experiments with authentic virus on Calu-3 (Fig. 8 D)

613

demonstrated a trend towards inhibition of replication by both Ambroxol and Bromhexine,

614

with Bromhexine possibly being slightly more potent, but also more toxic (Figs. 4 C, 8 E).

615

Thus, the specificity of Bromhexine-mediated inhibition is questionable. In sum, it seems

616

likely that Ambroxol acts weakly on TMPRSS2, which would explain its modest but significant

617

effect on TMPRSS2-mediated activation of SARS1-S-mediated fusion (Fig 3 A). It should be

noted that replication

MATERIAL AND METHODS

630
631

Cell Culture

632

All cell lines in this study were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. 293T (a kind gift from Vladan

633

Rankovic and originally purchased from the ATCC, Göttingen) and Calu-3 cells (a kind gift

634

from Stefan Ludwig) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), high

635

glucose, GlutaMAX, 25mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal

636

calf serum (FCS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 50μg/ml gentamycin (PAN Biotech). For Calu-

637

3 cells 1mM Sodium-Pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added. For seeding and sub-

638

culturing of cells the medium was removed, the cells were washed with PBS (PAN-Biotech)

639

and detached with Trypsin (PAN-Biotech). All transfections were performed using PEI

640

(Polysciences) in a 1:3 Ratio (µg DNA/µg PEI) mixed in OptiMEM. The cell viability assay with

641

Calu-3 (Fig. 8 E) was performed as described previously (7); unlike for the other assays in this

642

series of experiments Bromhexine and Ambroxol were used in the form of commercial

643

cough suppressants (Bromo 12mg/ml, Krewel Meuselbach, and Mucosolvan 30mg/5ml,

644

Sanofi-Aventis).

647

Plasmids

648

Expression plasmids for pQCXIPBL-hTMPRSS2 (55), pCG1-SARS-2-S_humanized (56), pCG1-

649

ACE2 (7) and pCG1-SARS S (57) are described elsewhere. For generation of pVAX1-SARS2-S

650

the codon-optimized sequence encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was amplified by

651

PCR and cloned into the pVAX1 backbone. psPAX2 and pMD2.G were a gift from Didier

652

Trono (Addgene plasmid # 12260, Addgene plasmid # 12259 ) and pLenti CMV GFP Neo (657-

653

2) was a gift from Eric Campeau & Paul Kaufman (Addgene plasmid # 17447). Expression

654

plasmids SARS2-S2’-AA and SARS2-S1/S2-mut were generated from pCG1_SL-Cov_Wuhan-

655

S_humanized SARS2-S by PCR based mutation of the SARS2-S S1/S2 and the S2’ cleavage site

665

(AGCAGCTTCATCGAGGACCTGCTG), SARS2S K814G rev (TCCGCTGGGCTTGCTAGGATCGG).

666

Sequence integrity was verified by sequencing of the coding region. Plasmid pCG1-SARS2-

667

S_S2’mut contains a silent G to T mutation in the codon for leucine 441.

668

Expression plasmids pVAX1-SARS2-S_S2’-GH, pVAX1-SARS2-S1/S2-mut and pVAX1-SARS2-

669

S_D614G were generated from pVAX1-SARS2-S by PCR-based mutation in a similar manner.

670

The Gal4-Luc reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of an activator

671

sequence that binds the Gal4 transcription factor has been described elsewhere (34). The

672

Gal4 DNA binding domain VP16 fusion plasmid corresponds to Genbank identifier X85976.

Production of lentiviral and pseudoparticles and pseudoparticle infection experiments

750

Lentiviral pseudoparticles were produced by transfecting 293T cells with expression

751

plasmids for psPAX2, pLenti-CMV-GFP or pLentiCMV-TurboGFP::Luciferase and either SARS2-

752

Spike variants (pVAX1-SARS2-S_S2’-GH, pVAX1-SARS2-S1/S2-mut and pVAX1-SARS2-

753

S_D614G) or VSV-G (pMD2.G Addgene #12259) wich was a gift fom Didier Trono. The cell

754

culture supernatants were harvested 24-72 h post transfection followed by addition of fresh

755

media and again after 48-72h. The supernatants were passed through a 0.45µm CE-Filter,

756

and the SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles were concentrated via low speed centrifugation at

757

4°C for 16h at 4200xg. For detection of particle incorporation virus supernatant was further

758

concentrated by centrifugation at 4°C for 2h at 21000xg on 5% Optiprep (Merck), the

759

supernatant was removed and pellet was resuspended and addressed to Western Blot

analysis. The SARS-CoV-2 spike and VSV-G lentiviral pseudoparticles were used to transduce

761

293T transfected with TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression plasmids or Calu-3 cells. 48 h after

762

transfection with control or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression plasmids, the pseudoparticles

763

were added to the cells pre-incubated with inhibitors Bromhexine hydrochloride (Merck),

764

770

and after washing with PBS the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Roth) in PBS. The

771

percentages of GFP-positive cells were determined using a LSRII flow cytometer, and at least

772

10000 cells were analyzed. Cells transduced with pLentiCMV-TurboGFP::Luciferase

SARS-CoV-2 infections

778

Primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate ER-PR2 was a kind gift from Klaus Überla, Erlangen, and was

779

originally isolated on Vero cells. The virus stock was then grown on Calu-3 cells in EMEM +

780

2% FCS + Penicillin/Streptomycin. Virus containing supernatant was harvested after CPE was

781

clearly visible, and the supernatant was cleared by low-speed centrifugation at 1200 rpm for

782

10min before passage through a 0.2µm syringe filter (Mini-Sart, Sartorius). Virus stocks were

783

aliquoted in 200µl aliquots and stored at -150°C. Infectivity was determined by the method

784

of Reed and Muench (61) at 10

785

experiment) or two day (other two experiments) before infection and approx. 100000 Calu-3

786

cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 0.002 in a 96-well

787

plate in triplicates. The cells were preincubated with the respective inhibitors in 50µl at

788

twice the concentration for ~1.5h, the virus was then added in 50µl medium. Total RNA from

789

the cells and the culture supernatant was harvested 20h (experiment 3) and 24h

790

(experiments 1&2) post infection.

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR

793

RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo) according to the

794

manufacturer’s instructions. For quantification of viral RNA in infected cultures, the cells and

795

cellular supernatant in a volume of 100µl were lysed and inactivated by addition of 300µl TRI

796

reagent (Zymo). qPCR on viral genomes was performed using the N1 CDC primer set (2019-

TGG TGG ACC-BHQ1, 125nM) and SensiFAST Probe Hi-ROX One-Step Kit (Bioline) according

800

to the manufacturer’s instructions in a 20µl reaction with 5µl sample. All PCR reactions were

801

performed in technical duplicates on a StepOne Plus (Thermo) realtime cycler. PCR

802

conditions were 45°C for 10min, 95°C for 2min, and then 45 cycles 95°C for 5sec followed by

803

55°C for 20sec. To determine the PCR efficiency across the whole dynamic range, a 7-step

804

10-fold dilution series with the H2O-treated SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 sample was

805

performed. These datapoints with the undiluted sample set to 1 was approximated by an

806

exponential function using Microsoft Excel 2020. The measured PCR efficiency was

807

additionally fitted by multiplication with a constant factor to match our RNA standard

808

(Charite, Berlin), which was only available at 50,

809

approach, but was not used for relative quantification. Fit was performed by minimizing the

810

sum of the squared relative deviations from the standard concentrations with an exactness

811

of two digits.

812

For quantification of cellular TMPRSS2 and GAPDH expression cDNA synthesis and qPCR

813

were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the SensiFast cDNA kit

814

and SensiFAST SYBR qPCR kit (both from Bioline). The qPCR was run on a StepOnePlus

815

realtime PCR cycler (Thermo) and analyzed using the StepOne Software, which was also used

816

to calculate ∆∆Ct values and error estimates for TMPRSS2 expression. TMPRSS2 mRNA was

A RT-qPCR analysis of TMPRSS2 expression. Fold TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in Calu-3 cells,

1260

293T cells, and A549 cells was measured by RT-qPCR using the ∆∆Ct method. The -RT control

1261

with Ct 30.33 for the GAPDH mRNA in Calu-3 was considered irrelevant as it was more than

1262

19 cycles over the value in the sample, representing a contamination of less than 0.01%.

1263

B Calu-3 cells were infected with lentiviral particles encoding a TurboGFP-luciferase

1264

reportergene pseudotyped with SARS2-Spike in the presence of 50µM Bromhexine,

1265

Ambroxol or Camostat. 48h after transduction the cells were lysed and luciferase activity

1266

was determined. The data shows values normalized to solvent treatment, which was set to

1267

100, and the error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments,

1268

each performed in triplicates.

1269

C Viral RNA load. Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of Bromhexine,

1270

Ambroxol, Camostat, or Batimastat at the indicated concentrations. Viral RNA was

1271

quantified by RT-qPCR 24h (experiment 1 and 2) and 20h (experiment 3) post infection. The

1272

median Ct values of three experiments (each experiment was performed in biological

1273

triplicates) are plotted (experiment 1: dots, experiment 2: triangles, experiment 3: squares,

1274

and the mean was determined. Significant differences to solvent controls are indicated by

1275

asterisks. Significance was determined using repeated measures one way ANOVA and

1276

Fisher’s LSD without correcting for multiple comparisons. Differences were also significant

1277

using two way ANOVA without correction for multiple comparisons and all available data,

1278

but use of the median from each experiment significantly reduced variance. All samples

1279

were compared to water except for Batimastat, which was compared to DMSO.

1280

D Relative viral RNA expression. Using the median Ct values from each experiment series as

1281

above and the experimentally determined PCR efficiency, the amount of viral RNA was

1282

calculated as percent of solvent control for each inhibitor.

1283

E Cell viability. Cell viability of Calu-3 was determined after culture in the presence of the

1284

indicated compounds in two independent assays, each performed in biological triplicates.

1285

Statistical significance was determined using Two-Way ANOVA, only significant reductions in

1286

viability are shown.
