Abstract
RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and
therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption
are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when
permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus
infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as
SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of
RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust
down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the
various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA
knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of
Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was
demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to
metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse
hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was
also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate
complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated
virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver
successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of
serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is

reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an
effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes. The present work
supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and
regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism
modulation in the liver.

Introduction
Targeted inhibition of a metabolism regulatory gene is often used for
modeling and developing therapies of metabolic diseases (Moller, 2012;
Saviano and Baumert, 2019). In the past decades, many strategies of
metabolic regulations were achieved through using various modulators,
including numerous small molecular compounds, nucleic acids, and
therapeutic polypeptides/proteins targeting individual or multiple defined
molecular products, such as enzymes, circulating proteins, cell-surface
receptors and cellular RNAs (Moller, 2012). Applications of metabolic
modulation have great potential for disease modeling and therapies. However,
developing novel approaches with more specific and more flexible modulation
of metabolic genes in vivo is still challenging, because natural and synthesized
modulators with high targeting specificity are theoretically limited.
In recent years, an increasing number of genetic modification tools has
emerged. Representing one of the greatest breakthroughs, the CRISPR/Cas

system offers sequence-specific DNA editing methods to correct mutant genes
in inherited metabolic diseases, and shows remarkable benefits to the
establishments of metabolic disease animal models, such as inherited
tyrosinemia (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Rossidis et al., 2018; Xue et al.,
2014; Yao et al., 2017). However, permanent modification of DNA is usually
not an optimal strategy for the therapies of acquired metabolic disorders.
Recent breakthroughs with RNA-guided RNA-targeting systems, such as
class 2 type VI CRISPR-Cas effectors, were reported for the remarkable
capability of RNA editing without permanent modification of DNA. Theoretically,
RNA-targeting systems could provide a much safer approach for gene
silencing (Abudayyeh et al., 2017; Cox et al., 2017; Konermann et al., 2018;
Pineda et al., 2019). Among such systems, CasRx was recently found to be
advantageous, mostly because it is more efficient and has more robust
activation during RNA-guided RNA cleavage in mammalian cells in vitro
(Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018). CasRx is a type VI-D effector
(Cas13d) with a small size that can be packaged into AAVs, and thus has great
potential for translational medicine (Konermann et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018;
Zhang et al., 2018). In this study, we set out to explore the feasibility of using
the CasRx system for the targeted silencing of metabolic genes.

As one of the metabolism regulatory genes, Pten was chosen first in our
study to investigate whether CasRx could generally target metabolic genes for
the efficient knockdown. 10 sgRNAs that were designed to target to the coding
sequence of Pten mRNAs were prepared (Fig. S1A). CasRx and each Pten
sgRNA

were

into

mouse

neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (Fig. S2A). After 48 hours, the N2a cells with the
transfected CasRx and each Pten sgRNA were analyzed to evaluate their
levels of Pten mRNA. As expected, all of our designed Pten sgRNAs revealed
successful down-regulation of the level of Pten mRNA (Fig. S2A).
Next, improvement of knockdown efficiency was tested on the strategy to
combine the different Pten sgRNA individuals (Fig. S2B, C, D). After sgPten-5
and sgPten-6 were combined in treatment, the reduction of Pten mRNA levels
successfully reached 16Â±3%, the most efficient of all combinations (Fig. 1A, B
and Fig. S2D). Previously, Pten was known as a metabolic regulator that
suppressed the insulin signaling by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway (Cho et
al., 2001; Stiles et al., 2004). Deletion of Pten promoted AKT phosphorylation
(Stiles et al., 2004). Accordingly, such effects were also shown in our results
after the successful knockdown of Pten through the combination of sgPten-5
and sgPten-6. In the N2a cells that were transfected with CasRx, sgPten-5 and
sgPten-6, the PTEN protein levels were significanty decreased while the AKT
phosphorylation levels were significantly elevated (Fig. 1C).

Unintended wide-spread off-target silencing is one of the major hurdles for
the applications of RNA interference (RNAi) (Jackson et al., 2003; Pecot et al.,
2011). The CasRx system has, however, been reported to be with significantly
reduced off-target events compared to other RNAi approaches (Konermann et
al., 2018). Here, we set out to compare the CasRx system with spacer
sequence-match shRNAs in knockdown of Pten via transient transfection in
N2a cells. Consistent with previous studies, Pten-targeting shRNAs rendered
wide-spread off-target transcript changes (Fig. 1D). In contrast, transfection of
the spacer-matched CasRx system induced significantly reduced transcript
changes (Fig. 1D). Importantly, Pten was the most significantly changed gene
(Fig.

1D).

These

CasRx-mediated transcript interference.
Next, CasRx-mediated knockdown of a targeted gene was broadly studied
among metabolism regulatory genes. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
type 9 (PCSK9) is a crucial protein of serum LDL cholesterol regulation
(Lambert et al., 2012). Here, a total of 11 candidate sgRNAs were designed
and tested, with the goal of targeting the coding region of Pcsk9 (Fig. S1B). As
expected, all Pcsk9 sgRNA candidates showed the effects of robust
knockdown of Pcsk9 mRNAs in the 293T cells transfected with each sgRNA
for Pcsk9 (Fig. S2E). Moreover, CasRx-mediated targeted knockdown could
also be applied for lncLstr, a liver-enriched lncRNA (Fig. S1C and S2F).

Together, the CasRx system was able to efficiently and functionally knock
down the metabolic genes, including the lncRNA gene that could be related to
metabolic function, in the in vitro cultured mammalian cells.
After the successful establishment of a method for CasRx-mediated gene
knockdown in the cultured mammalian cells in vitro, the feasibility of in vivo
metabolic gene targeting was studied. The three metabolic genes Pten, Pcsk9
and lncLstr, were further studied to determine whether gene knockdown was
effective in hepatocytes. At first, the effect of CasRx-mediated Pten gene
knockdown in the liver was studied through the evaluation of Pten mRNA
levels. CasRx, sgPten-5, and sgPten-6 were delivered to the mouse liver by
hydrodynamic

tail-vein

injection

of

indicated

plasmids

(Fig.

S3A).

Hydrodynamic tail-vein injection, a simple yet effective method, can be used to
deliver naked DNA into hepatocytes of mouse liver in vivo (Kim and Ahituv,
2013). After 96 hours of plasmid injection, individual hepatocytes were
dissociated through liver perfusion. Hepatocytes expressing both GFP and
mCherry implied successful vector delivery and were purified through cell
sorting. Though not mathematically significant, results suggested that the Pten
mRNA level in GFP+/mCherry+ hepatocytes had decreased in comparison
with that in GFP-/mCherry- hepatocytes (Fig. S3B).
Second, the in vivo CasRx-mediated Pcsk9 gene knockdown in mouse
liver was studied. After hydrodynamic injection of the CasRx system with

sgPcsk9-5 and sgPcsk9-6, Pcsk9 mRNA levels in

GFP+/mCherry+

hepatocytes were significantly decreased to 28.8Â±10.5% of that in
GFP-/mCherry- hepatocytes (Fig. S3C), which also significantly reduced
PCSK9 protein level in GFP+/mCherry+ hepatocytes (Fig. S3D).
Next, the feasibility of the CasRx system in knockdown of long non-coding
RNAs (lncRNAs) in vivo was investigated. LncLstr is a liver-enriched lncRNA,
which regulates lipid metabolism by inhibition of Cyp8b1 (Li et al., 2015).
Similar with the above methods for in vivo vector deliveries, hydrodynamic
injection of plasmids encoding CasRx and those encoding both sglncLstr-5
and sglncLstr-6 were performed (Fig. S3A). Hepatocytes that received these
two

plasmids

showed

significant

reduction

of

lncLstr

(Fig.

S3E).

CasRx-mediated lncLstr knockdown was sufficient to result in reduced
expression of Cyp8b1 (Fig. S3F). Thus, efficient knockdown of lncRNA was
successfully obtained in hepatocytes using the CasRx system.
In an effort to explore the feasibility of using the CasRx system in
simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes, we cloned a vector encoding
CasRx and GFP together with 6 sgRNAs targeting Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr
(Fig. S3G). Hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of this plasmid into the liver
simultaneously decreased all three targeted genes, providing a powerful
platform for simultaneous knockdown of multiple metabolic genes (Fig. S3G).
To evaluate the functional modulation of metabolic genes by CasRx, we

first employed the piggyBac transposon system to transfer CasRx and
Pten-targeting sgRNAs to the hepatocytes by hydrodynamic injection (Fig. 1E).
Four days after injection of GFP-expressing CasRx plasmids, we observed
scattered hepatocytes with reduced PTEN staining (Fig. 1F). Importantly,
GFP+ hepatocytes were also negative or low for PTEN staining (Fig. 1F). We
also observed increased AKT phosphorylation in hepatocytes receiving the
CasRx plasmids, suggesting a functional knockdown of Pten in these cells (Fig.
1F). To further characterize the hepatocytes receiving CasRx plasmids, we
isolated GFP+ hepatocytes by FACS sorting. The GFP+ hepatocytes showed
significantly reduced expression of Pten and increased AKT phosphorylation
(Fig. 1G, H).
To explore the functional activation of AKT signaling cascades, we
investigated the response of lipid and glucose metabolism-related genes
downstream of AKT. The results showed that Pten knockdown significantly
increased the expressions of Fasn (fatty acid synthase) and Srebp1 (sterol
regulatory element-binding protein-1) in the GFP+ hepatocytes (Fig. 1I), which
was consistent with previous findings (Stiles et al., 2004). Pten-inhibited
PI3K/AKT signaling was found to be critical for lipogenesis regulation in the
liver, while the activated AKT repressed SREBP1, a key transcription factor
required for the expression of Fasn (Haeusler et al., 2014; He et al., 2010).
Therefore, decrease of PTEN promoted the expression of Fasn and Srebp1

(Fig. 1I). Pten is also involved in regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver
(Gross et al., 2009). AKT positively regulates the transcriptions of
glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(Pepck) in hepatocytes (Gross et al., 2009). Here, the CasRx-mediated
knockdown of Pten, a negative regulator of AKT activity, led to the decreased
expression of G6pc and Pepck in GFP+ hepatocytes (Fig. 1J). Together, the
above results indicated that the CasRx system could be used to functionally
knock down Pten in vivo.
Next, AAV8, an efficient liver-targeted gene delivery system, was applied
to further increase the effect of in vivo Pcsk9 knockdown (Fig. 2A) (Shen et al.,
2007). PCSK9 is secreted by hepatocytes, and has great promise as a
candidate of drug targets among all regulators of serum cholesterol (Steinberg
and Witztum, 2009). Accumulating evidence shows that inhibition of PCSK9
lowered serum cholesterol levels (Chan et al., 2009; Rossidis et al., 2018).
Increased plasma LDL cholesterol level is one of the major causes for
coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as
many other diseases (LaRosa et al., 1990; Law et al., 1994). Thus, we chose
the CasRx system applied to Pcsk9 gene knockdown in hepatocytes for the
purpose of reducing serum cholesterol levels.
We delivered CasRx, sgPcsk9-5 and sgPcsk9-6 to the liver by AAV8,
which significantly reduced Pcsk9 mRNA level (Fig. 2A, B). The serum PCSK9

levels in Pcsk9 knockdown mice was reduced to 56.8Â±15.6% of those in
non-injected wild-type mice 3 weeks after AAV infection (Fig. 2C). Serum total
cholesterol levels were reduced to 61.6Â±19.4% of normal levels (p=0.002) (Fig.
2D). Moreover, the liver function of AAV-injected mice, saline-injected and
non-injected mice were similar, and we did not observe obvious liver injuries in
these mice (Fig. 2E, F). Thus, the CasRx system provides an efficient tool
targeting Pcsk9 to reduce serum cholesterol in vivo.
To investigate whether CasRx-mediated gene knockdown is reversible
after removal of the CasRx system, we delivered CasRx plasmids expressing

Hepatocytes receiving the plasmids could be traced by the expression of red
fluorescent protein tdTomato. One day after injection of plasmids, Pcsk9
mRNA levels in hepatocytes receiving CasRx plasmids (tdTomato+)
decreased to 16.5Â±4.9% of those in hepatocytes without plasmids
(GFP-/tdTomato-) (Fig. 2H). Along with the gradual loss of CasRx plasmids in
hepatocytes, the Pcsk9 mRNA levels gradually recovered to normal levels 15
days after injection (Fig. 2H and Fig. S4A). Importantly, a second-round
injection of the plasmids achieved a similar efficiency of Pcsk9 knockdown
compared to that in the first-round of plasmids injection (Fig. 2H). These

results suggested a remarkable superiority of the CasRx system for its
reversibility of gene knockdown.

Discussion
Through these early studies we have successfully obtained firsthand
information and experiences for realizing the potential and feasibility of the
CasRx system in RNA knockdown in vivo. These results support our long-term
goal to model and develop therapies of metabolic diseases. Over the past few
years, advancements in CRISPR systems have provided plentiful tools for
genome editing, epigenetic modification and transcript activation/inhibition
both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the development of a CasRx-mediated in vivo
gene knockdown system is becoming more relied upon for disease modeling,
genetic screening, mechanism studies, and therapeutic purposes. Remarkably,
different from CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing with permanent
disruption of DNA in vivo, CasRx-mediated modification is used to target RNAs,
instead of genomic DNA (Zhang et al., 2018). This impermanent modification
makes the CasRx system more valuable for modeling metabolism disorders
considering the required reversible downregulation of metabolism genes.
Moreover, CasRx-mediated modification can ideally also be used for
therapeutic applications in clinical metabolism disorders because of its
advantages in terms of reversible manipulations of gene expressions.

In this study, hepatocytes were treated as the targeting locations because
they are one of the most important cell types to maintain metabolism
homeostasis in the human body. Indeed, many drug candidates were first
designed to target proteins that are produced by the hepatocytes in order to
correct metabolic disorders. Because hepatocytes are composed of a large
fraction of polyploid cells (Duncan et al., 2010), the multiple copies of an
individual gene in one hepatocyte make CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene
knockout less efficient. Thus, posttranscriptional silencing approaches
attracted much attention for disrupting gene expression in the liver, which can
rely on the CasRx system for modulation of mRNAs at the post-transcriptional
level. The successful CasRx-mediated gene knockdown in hepatocytes is
expected to be beneficial to similar approaches in other cells. Compared to
other approaches of gene knockdown with RNA interference, the CasRx
system-derived approach was more specific and efficient (Konermann et al.,
2018; Yan et al., 2018). In this study, we demonstrated that the CasRx system
could efficiently target RNA for knockdown in hepatocytes, providing a robust
method to inactivate genes in polyploid cells in vivo.
Another advantage of CasRx is its small size, when considering
therapeutic potential (Barrangou and Doudna, 2016; Konermann et al., 2018).
Currently, CasRx is the smallest class 2 CRISPR effector available in
mammalian cells (Konermann et al., 2018). The small size of 966 aa for one

CasRx protein molecule makes it possible to package CasRx into AAV
together with multiple guide RNAs (Konermann et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018)
(Fig. 2A), highlighting its potential in therapeutic uses.
As an RNA-targeting CRISPR effector, CasRx is especially appealing for
its potential in the treatment of RNA virus infections. A Cas9-based
DNA-targeting strategy has been reported to function in disruption of genome
DNA or DNA intermediates of viruses (Liu et al., 2015; Ophinni et al., 2018;
Price et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2017). However, RNA viruses with neither genome
DNA nor DNA intermediates, such as deadly SARS-Cov-2 (2019-nCov),
SARS-Cov, MERS-Cov and influenza A virus, could not be targeted by
DNA-targeting CRISPR effectors. Recently, RNA-targeting Cas13 was
experimentally validated for its antiviral activity in cell lines infected with
single-stranded RNA viruses (Freije et al., 2019). In this study, we validated
that CasRx, a Cas13 family protein, could also functionally target RNA in vivo,
further supporting the potential use of CasRx in RNA-targeting therapies.
