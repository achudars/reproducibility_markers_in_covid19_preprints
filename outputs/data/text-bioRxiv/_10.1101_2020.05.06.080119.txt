Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions shaped the early outbreak in Central Eastern
Europe: comparing Hungarian data to a worldwide sequence data-matrix

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is the third highly pathogenic human
coronavirus in history. Since the emergence in Hubei province, China, during late 2019 the
situation evolved to pandemic level. Following China, Europe was the second epicenter of the
pandemic. To better comprehend the detailed founder mechanisms of the epidemic evolution
in Central-Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary, we determined the full-length SARSCoV-2 genomes from 32 clinical samples collected from laboratory confirmed COVID-19
patients over the first month of disease in Hungary. We applied a haplotype network analysis
on all available complete genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from GISAID database as of
the 21th of April, 2020. We performed additional phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses
to achieve the recognition of multiple and parallel introductory events into our region. Here
we present a publicly available network imaging of the worldwide haplotype relations of
SARS-CoV-2 sequences and conclude the founder mechanisms of the outbreak in CentralEastern Europe.

Introduction
Following the 2002 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic and the
discovery of MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus in 2012, the third
highly pathogenic human coronavirus in history emerged in Hubei province, China, during
late 2019. The novel virus was subsequently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the acute respiratory disease as coronavirus disease 19
(COVID-19) 1. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the ongoing coronavirus pandemic
spreading on all inhabited continents. As of April 26, 2020, the confirmed case numbers
surpassed 3 million worldwide and the disease associated mortality rate exceeded 200,000 2.
At the onset of the second week of March, Europe became the next epicenter of the
pandemic, following China, as reported by the World Health Organization 3. By the end of
April, more than one million laboratory confirmed cases were reported from all European
countries 4. The first two Hungarian cases were officially confirmed on March 4th, according
to the data of ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report 5. Border closures and universal
ban regarding public gatherings was announced on March 17.
To better comprehend the detailed founder mechanisms of the epidemic evolution in
Central-Eastern Europe, particularly in Hungary, we determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2
genomes from 32 clinical samples collected from laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients
over the first month of disease in Hungary. Our virus sampling started from this date and
spanned the first two weeks of country-wide mitigation regulations (March 17 through April
2, 2020).
Results and Discussion
In order to understand the origin of Hungarian-based COVID-19 epidemics and
provide baseline data for the evaluation of future epidemic events we applied a network
analysis on complete genomic sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 available in GISAID database6
current to April 21. The network showed negative exponential degree distribution which is
common regarding scale-free networks7. This characteristic network is typical for epidemics8.
However, several nodes represented a higher frequency in the lower part of the plot which is
the tendency associated with small-world networks9 (Supplementary Figure 1.). Altogether, a
total of 147 clusters were identified with a Girvan-Newmann community detection
algorithm10. In consideration of this approach, a total of nine main clusters were described
which together serve as the base for the remaining smaller clusters (Figure 1.). Although the
investigated network contained relatively high number of clusters, its diameter is 25, which
infers the farthest distance in the matrix between two sequence is 25 steps, whilst the average
path length is 8.91 steps. The high cluster rate was supported by the ratio of these two
measures. The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network was 0.004
(edge density).

Figure 1.: Genetic network analysis of 7864 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomic sequences. Hungarian
strains are indicated with numbered yellow dots – numbers referring to Table 1. The nine major clades
are represented by a solid color. Genetic lineages are marked with colored dotted lines, where green
lines are bordering B 1, B 1.1 and B 1.11; yellow and orange lines mark B 1.5 and B 3 respectively.

Hungarian genomes are dispersed within four main clusters out of the nine (Figure
2.). The genome designated SARS-CoV-2/human/Hungary/620/27_03_2020 is positioned in
the main Chinese cluster (incorporating early Chinese sequences and data from Hangzhou, in
January) and closely connected to a Taiwanese sequence on March 23rd (Figure 2., Cluster
C). Apart from other Hungarian sequences, this is the only indication for the introduction
from a non-European source towards Hungary at the examined time-period in consideration
of the available sequence data. The remainder of the sequences are dispersed among three
other main clusters: A, B and I (Figure 2.). A and I clusters are structured by mostly the

Western-European sequences, whilst B is a dominant cluster in the USA. Although sampling
bias may largely alter the conclusions for the exact geographic origin of a particular strain, the
main patterns as multiple introductions from different sources can be concluded.

Figure 2: Representation of the nine main clusters which serve as the baseline regarding the
worldwide haplotype network of SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of April 21, 2020. The ten most common
countries of each cluster are summarized in a column graph and represented using different colors.
Hungarian sequences are depicted by enlarged grey dots. Star indicates the participation of a sample
from this study indirectly to the specified main cluster (i.e., participation in a sub-cluster relevant to
the main cluster). Number of elements within each remaining (n=147) smaller cluster is indicated as a
simple column chart at the bottom of the figure.

Using the complete haplotype network dataset as a backbone, we applied additional
phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses (Supplementary Figure S2). It is likely that
occupation-related movement within the EU resulted in multiple introductory events from
Western-European host countries towards Central-Eastern Europe. This observation is further
supported by recent narrative analysis on the Nextstrain online platform focusing on Eastern
European processes of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolution11. Similarly to Hungary and
possibly to the entire region, there were eleven separate introductions to Poland, based on the
currently available sequence data11. In order to leverage additional support regarding this
phenomenon, we applied a local Nextstrain database workflow in the addition of the
sequences from this manuscript (Supplementary Figure S3)12. As a result of this analysis and
considering the observation from Poland, we were able to lend more support for the regular
and dispersed introductions into Central-Europe. In addition to regular movement, the border
restrictions as outbreak mitigation measures fixed a narrow timescale for individuals returning
to Hungary and likely facilitated the parallel introductory events dispersed throughout the
country. Based on genetic lineage categorization using PANGOLIN software, 20 out of the
total 32 Hungarian sequences fell into the most dominant (i.e., most sequenced) lineage B.1
(Table 1). Dominance may largely depend on sampling heterogeneity between geographic
regions and countries. However, it substantiates the connection of Hungary regarding SARSCoV-2 cases to multiple European sources and provides additional support for the network
analysis.

and offers additional details for each sample. Background data is also noted where it was available.
Different background color of SARS-CoV-2 strain names highlight different genetic lineage groups
represented with the same colored dotted lines on Figure 1

Across the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Figure S2A), several of the Hungarian
sequences were interspersed and mainly clustered with European sequences (England, France,
Iceland and Germany) and supported with high posterior probabilities (>80%) while only one
Hungarian sequence clustered with a North-American sequence (PP = 95%). These
observations elegantly support the scenario regarding multiple individual introductions. In
parallel, local clusters were also observed (PP = 100%) indicating local transmission even
within the short timeframe of sampling. Moreover, several of the local clusters had very low
PP indicating missing data which is likely to be the consequence of insufficient contact
tracing and subsequent missing sequence data.
Within our dataset, the phylogeographic analysis indicated China as the root location
(diffusion origin) (Supplementary Figure S2B). Moreover, the virus seemed to spread out to

Hungary mainly from Western European countries, nevertheless local transmissions also
contributed to disease spread within the country. The data correspond with the
epidemiological history of SARS-2-CoV-2 in Hungary4.
As a main result of this study, we present and provide a large-scale haplotype network
backbone in reference to the immediate analysis of pandemic evolution of SARS-CoV-2. It is
a rapid and useful tool to assess the origin of particular sequences and the acquisition of
important data for regarding public health mitigation actions, discovering unidentified
infection sources or super-spreading events on a large-scale. In general, it provides the
network-based opportunity of rapid, genetic distance-based analysis for all available sequence
data, in any context. Herein, we offer this network file available for any researchers to
facilitate the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic evolution. The network file is suitable
to visualize any available sequences, available at late April 2020, in its context to all known
sequence data.
The importance of early, country-based mitigation measures are thoroughly
exemplified on this dataset. We presented the emergence of multiple virus clusters from
various sources in Hungary during the early phase of the epidemic. However, the publicly
available epidemiologic data indicate a predominance of confirmed cases in and adjacent to
the capital city, Budapest. Possibly, this phenomenon is due to effective mitigation by limiting
individual movement, application of social distancing and border restrictions13. Therefore, we
believe a pan-European, coordinated mitigation policy will be beneficial to prevent significant
mixture of European clusters during future epidemics.
Our research further highlights the importance of genomic epidemiologic tools for
public health decision making. The combination of different methods (i.e., network analysis
and phylogenetic approaches) may greatly facilitate the understanding of COVID-19 outbreak
evolution.

Methods
Sample collection
Oro-pharyngeal swab samples were obtained from 32 patients during the period from
March 17 to April 2. Within the frame of a country-wide collaboration network regarding
SARS-CoV-2 research, nucleic-acid samples were received from University Hospitals at
Szeged and Budapest and from the Hungarian Defense Forces, Military Medical Center.
Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Pécs, Ethics Committee, under the
registration number: 8218-PTE2020.
Direct sequencing and primary data analysis from patient samples
Nucleic acid samples were extracted directly from oro-pharyngeal swab samples using
a Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep Plus extraction kit (Zymo Research) and in full compliance to
the manufacturers’ recommendations. Reverse transcription and multiplex PCR were
performed on the basis of information provided by the Artic Network initiative 14. Both the
concentration and the quality of the PCR products were measured and checked using the
Agilent 4200 TapeStation System and ThermoFisher Scientific Qubit 3 Fluorometer. The 32
sequencing libraries were prepared using 98 overlapping amplicons covering the whole viral

genome. The libraries were then quantitatively checked, barcoded and sequenced on 5 flow
cells using Oxford Nanopore MinION Flow Cells (R9.4.1).
During primary data analysis, we used RAMPART to track the sequencing process in
“real-time” in order to acquire instant information regarding the quality of samples and the
coverage of the amplicons. Sequencing reads of samples with sufficient amplicon coverage
were mapped and consensus sequences generated by the bioinformatics pipeline built within
the Artic Network protocol.
Genome data analysis
SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n=7864) were downloaded from GISAID database on 21
April, 2020. Only complete (>29000 base-pair length) and high quality (with <1% Ns,
<0.05% unique amino acid mutations and no insertion/deletion unless verified by submitter)
sequences were used for network construction. To quantify the sequence similarity, percent
identity was calculated based on the BLAST 15 alignment for each paired sequence.
First, using the resulted similarity matrix, a fully connected, edge-weighted network
was constructed, where each node represented a COVID sequence, while the edges
represented their potential connections, and the edge weights (similarity values). Secondly,
the edge weights were transformed (100-weight) in the full network to make high values low
and low values high. Next, a minimum spanning tree (MST) was identified. In a spanning
tree, every node has only one or two connections. If multiple edges have the same minimum
weight, the algorithm will randomly pick one and not select all links with the same values. To
manage this issue, the graph with additional edges was modified by adding every edge for
each node having an equal or higher weight than the edges in the initial MST to the
corresponding node. All data analyses were performed using the R 3.6.2 on Linux16, for
network creation, and the Igraph package was applied17.
In regards to the generation of time-scaled phylogenetic tree, 105 SARS-CoV-2
genomes were retrieved from GISAID 6 following a manual selection based on the network
analysis. The sequences were aligned in MAFFT 18 with default parameters. Subsequently,
both best-fitting substitution model and the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with ultrabootstrapping were implemented in IQTREE webserver 19,20. The resulting tree was
subjugated to a root-to-tip regression analysis in TempEst21 to assess the clock-likeness
regarding the data. A positive correlation was observed between sampling time and root-to-tip
genetic divergence indicating the suitability of the dataset for molecular clock analysis using
the Beast v1.10.4 package. The KHY+I substitution model with the uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed clock, in addition to the coalescent exponential population growth model, were
applied22. The MCMC chains were run for 200 million iterations and sampled every 10,000
cycles, or generations, with 10% discarded as burn in. We explored the effective sample sizes
in Tracer (ESS>200)23. Moreover, to explore the phylogeographic diffusion of SARS-COV-2
in continuous space, the lognormal relaxed random walk diffusion model and a lognormal
uncorrelated relaxed clock model were implemented in the same package, were next
employed. Thus, the Maximum clade credibility tree was visualized in SpreaD324.
Lineage assignment of the Hungarian sequences was performed using the PANGOLIN
(Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages) software v1.0, which uses a
recently published lineage nomenclature 25,26.
