Abstract
Development of effective preventative interventions against SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic
agent of COVID-19 is urgently needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a
key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical for the viral replication cycle and the primary
target of neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated design elements previously shown for other
coronavirus S protein-based vaccines to be successful, e.g. prefusion-stabilizing substitutions and
heterologous signal peptides, for selection of a S-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. In vitro
characterization demonstrated that the introduction of stabilizing substitutions (i.e., furin cleavage
site mutations and two consecutive prolines in the hinge region of S1) increased the ratio of
neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibody binding, suggestive for a prefusion conformation of
the S protein. Furthermore, the wild type signal peptide was best suited for the correct cleavage
needed for a natively-folded protein. These observations translated into superior immunogenicity
in mice where the Ad26 vector encoding for a membrane-bound stabilized S protein with a wild
type signal peptide elicited potent neutralizing humoral immunity and cellular immunity that was
polarized towards Th1 IFN-γ. This optimized Ad26 vector-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2,
termed Ad26.COV2.S, is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT04436276).

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the
Betacoronavirus genus, the Sarbecovirus subgenus, and is a member of the species SARS-related
coronavirus, and the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Coronaviridae
Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020). In March 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the development
of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has become a global health priority.
Immune responses against the spike (S) protein are thought to be required for vaccineelicited protection against coronaviruses. Like other class I fusion proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein is intrinsically metastable (Sternberg and Naujokat, 2020). In recent years, efforts have
been made to stabilize various class I fusion proteins in their prefusion conformation through
structure-based design. In particular, the stabilization of the so-called hinge loop that precedes the
central helix (CH) was shown to be a successful approach for stabilizing a range of viral fusion
glycoproteins, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F (Krarup et al., 2015), human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein (Env) (Rutten et al., 2018; Sanders et al., 2002),
Ebola glycoprotein (GP) (Rutten et al., 2020), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) F (Battles et al.,
2017), and Lassa GP (Hastie et al., 2017). Introduction of two consecutive proline (PP)
substitutions in the S2 subunit in the hinge loop between the CH and heptad repeat 1 (HR1)
stabilized the S proteins of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017) and recently also the SARS-CoV2 S protein in which also the furin cleavage site present at the boundary of the S1/S2 subunits was
mutated (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Several vaccine approaches using different
designs of the S protein (e.g. with or without stabilizing substitutions, using a wild type (wt) signal
peptide (SP) or Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) SP (Alharbi et al., 2017)), have been
described, which induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and protection in animal challenge models
against SARS-CoV (Martin et al., 2008), MERS-CoV (Alharbi et al., 2017) and SARS-CoV-2
infections (Corbett et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). It
is assumed that an effective vaccine against coronavirus infections should induce NAbs and a Th1skewed immune response. For SARS-CoV prototype vaccines that were generated in response to
the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, a theoretical risk of vaccine-associated enhanced disease induction
has been associated with a Th2 type immune response in animal models (Honda-Okubo et al.,

2015; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2014; Tseng et al., 2012). Although it is unclear whether vaccine
associated enhanced disease is a relevant concern for COVID-19 vaccines applied to humans,
induction of a Th1-skewed immune response is warranted to reduce even a theoretical risk of
vaccine-associated enhanced disease. Different immunogen design elements and vaccine
platforms can influence these vaccine characteristics and should therefore be evaluated.
We have previously shown that vaccines based on transgenes that are delivered by
recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 vectors (Ad26) have an acceptable safety
profile in humans and are able to induce neutralizing and binding antibodies, CD4 and CD8 T cell
responses and a Th1-biased immune response in animals and humans (Anywaine et al., 2019;
Baden et al., 2016; Baden et al., 2013; Barouch et al., 2013; Barouch et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2008;
Milligan et al., 2016; Mutua et al., 2019; Radosevic et al., 2010; Shukarev et al., 2017; van der Fits
et al., 2020; Winslow et al., 2017). Furthermore, the availability of industrialized and scalable
manufacturing processes makes this an attractive platform for vaccine development.
Here we describe how we employ this vaccine platform for the development of an
optimized S protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 S immunogen design
We engineered a series of plasmids coding for seven variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein: 1) native full-length S (S) with wt signal peptide (SP), 2) full-length S with the tissue
plasminogen activator SP (tPA.S), 3) full-length S with the tPA SP positioned upstream of the wt
SP (tPA.WT.S) (Alharbi et al., 2017), 4) full-length S with the tPA SP, the furin cleavage site
mutations (R682S, R685G) and proline substitutions (K986P, V987P) (tPA.S.PP)), 5) full-length
S with wild type SP, with furin cleavage site mutations and proline substitutions (S.PP), 6) fulllength S with only the furin cleavage site mutations (S.dFurin) and 7) full-length S with only the
proline substitutions (S.PP-PR), which can therefore be processed (PR) at the furin cleavage site
in the presence of furin (Fig. 1). Constructs 6 and 7 were used to study the effects of the furin
cleavage site mutations and the proline substitutions separately in vitro.
Antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S designs
Antigenicity of the seven membrane bound S proteins encoded by the different DNA
constructs was evaluated in cell-based ELISA (CBE). In addition, Ad26 vectors with a transgene
cassette encoding five of the DNA constructs were used to transduce cells to assess transgene
antigenicity by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Binding was assessed to four neutralizing ligands
(human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), convalescent human serum and two
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), S309 (Pinto et al., 2020) and SAD-S35 (Acro Biosystems) that
bind the receptor binding domain (RBD)) and three mAbs (CR3022, CR3015, CR3046) that are
non-neutralizing (Fig. S1). ACE2 and the neutralizing mAbs (1 g/ml) showed the highest binding
to the constructs that contain the double proline substitutions and/or the furin cleavage site
mutations (tPA.S.PP, S.PP, SdFurin and S.PP-PR) (Fig. 2A). ACE2 binding to these four
constructs correlated with increasing ACE2 concentration, whereas ACE2 binding to the three
constructs without any stabilizing substitutions showed decreased binding at the highest ACE2
concentration (5 µg/ml) (Fig. 2B), which might be caused by shedding of the S1 domain (Tortorici
and Veesler, 2019). Shedding of S1 from non-stabilized S also occurs in the absence of ACE2, as
ACE2 binding activity was observed in the supernatants of cell cultures transfected with construct
S, but not with S.PP (Fig. S2).

The construct containing the wt SP (S, S.PP, S.dFurin and S.PP-PR) gave a higher ratio of
neutralizing to non-neutralizing antibody binding than the tPA SP (tPA.S and tPA.S.PP) (Fig. 2C).
The highest ratio of neutralizing to non-neutralizing antibody binding was observed for S.PP
indicating a native prefusion conformation.
Expression of all immunogens was confirmed by western blot (Fig. 2D) using the CR3046
monoclonal antibody. Furin cleavage product S2 was only seen for those constructs with an intact
furin cleavage site (confirming previous observations, Mercado et al., in press).
N-termini of mature S proteins
Correct N-terminal processing by signal peptidase is a requirement for obtaining nativelyfolded proteins. In coronavirus S proteins, a conserved cysteine (Cys15 in case of SARS-CoV-2
S) is present directly downstream of the SP, that forms a disulfide bond with Cys136 and which is
likely required for correct folding of the N-terminal domain (NTD). In silico modeling using
SignalP-5.0 predicted that the wt SP would be cleaved predominantly after position 15, preventing
the formation of the disulfide and leading to the presence of an unpaired Cys in the mature protein.
When the wt SP was replaced by the tPA SP, the predicted cleavage occurred after position 13,
allowing formation of the disulfide bond to Cys136. When a tPA SP was added upstream the wt
SP, SignalP-5.0 predicted cleavage after the tPA SP. To investigate the SignalP-5.0 predictions
and study the effect of different SPs on S expression and stability in more detail, we performed
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine the N-terminus of the fulllength S protein as pulled down from cell membranes using either Mab CR3022 or ACE2-Fc. In
contrast to the prediction of SignalP-5.0, we found that the wt SP was cleaved after position 13,
that tPA SP leads to a lower number of correct N-termini and that tPA.WT.S is cleaved
predominantly after position 13 of the wt SP, but that also a small fraction of incorrectly processed
signal peptide was observed with the wt SP still attached (Fig. 3).
Since the membrane-bound S protein samples gave relatively low LC-MS/MS signals,
probably due to inherent complexities associated with the pull-down of membrane-anchored
proteins, we sought to confirm the identity of the N-terminal residue by analyzing a pair of secreted
SARS-CoV-2 S proteins that differ solely in their signal peptide. To this end we purified and
characterized engineered soluble proteins that were preceded by either the wt SP or the tPA SP
(S.dTM.PP and tPA.S.dTM.PP, respectively). These proteins were stabilized by furin cleavage site

mutations, introduction of the two consecutive proline substitutions in the S2 hinge loop and were
equipped with a T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain. Analysis of the purified soluble proteins
showed that the wt SP leads to a larger fraction of correctly cleaved N-termini compared to the
tPA SP (99.5% versus 11%) (Fig. S3A). In line with this, we observed lower trimer yields (Fig.
S3B) and a lower melting temperature (Fig. S3C) for the protein with the tPA SP compared to the
protein with the wt SP.
Stabilizing mutations render the S protein non-fusogenic
To further characterize our immunogen designs, we determined the effect of the furin
cleavage site mutations at the S1/S2 boundary as well as the PP substitutions in the S2 hinge loop
on fusion competence. To this end we developed an in vitro cell-cell fusion assay that is based on
co-transfection of constructs expressing wt SARS-CoV-2 S, and variants thereof, with constructs
expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). The
monolayers were imaged after 24 hr to visualize the syncytia through GFP redistribution. Both the
dFurin mutations and the PP substitutions alone or in combination, were sufficient to fully prevent
syncytium formation (Fig. 4B).
Next, to increase sensitivity and allow quantification of the fusion assay, we redesigned
the assay using a split luciferase system. A donor cell line, expressing the S protein and one
luciferase subunit, was mixed with an acceptor cell line that expresses ACE2, TMPRSS2 and the
complementing luciferase subunit (Fig. 4C). In this setup, expression of the wt S protein yielded
high signals that were diminished upon introduction of the PP substitutions but remained
detectable (Fig. 4D). Furin cleavage site mutations reduced the signal to the background level (‘no
spike’). As expected, combination of both stabilizing mutations rendered the S protein nonfusogenic as well.
Stabilizing substitutions enhance in vivo immunogenicity
In parallel to the in vitro characterization, we assessed how the different construct design
elements affect immunogenicity. Mice received a single intramuscular (i.m.) immunization of 10 8,
109 or 1010 viral particles (vp) of Ad26 vectors encoding different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein. We observed that across doses, adeno26 with the tPA.S insert (Ad26.tPA.S) induced lower
titers of antibodies that bind to the S protein than Ad26.S, as measured by ELISA at 4 and 6 weeks

post immunization (Fig. 5A,B). Ad26.tPA.S.PP and Ad26.tPA.WT.S showed similar
immunogenicity as Ad26.S. In addition, a live virus neutralization assay (VNA) was used to
measure SARS-CoV-2 NAb responses in mice receiving 10 10 vp (Ad26.tPA.S was not included).
Ad26.tPA.S.PP did not induce higher NAb titers than Ad26.S (Fig. 5C,D), in line with the findings
described above. Ad26.tPA.WT.S induced lower NAb titers than Ad26.S albeit not statistically
significant.
We next compared humoral and cellular immune responses induced by Ad26.S.PP and
Ad26.S. Mice received a single i.m. immunization of 108, 109 or 1010 vp Ad26.S or Ad26.S.PP and
binding and NAbs titers were measured at weeks 2 and 4. Both vectors elicited S protein binding
antibodies in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A,B). The induction of Nabs was only assessed for
mice immunized with the highest dose (Fig. 6 C,D). Titers of both binding- and NAbs were
significantly higher in Ad26.S.PP immunized mice, clearly indicating the benefit of S protein
stabilization for immunogenicity. These findings were consistent with immunizations with DNA
vaccines encoding tPA.S, tPA.S.PP, S and S.PP (Fig. S4).
Ad26.S.PP induces Th1-skewing of T cell response
To further investigate whether Ad26.S.PP induced a Th1-skewed immune response, to reduce the
theoretical risk of vaccine-associated enhanced disease, mice were immunized i.m. with a single
dose of 108 or 1010 vp Ad26.S or Ad26.S.PP and T cell responses were measured by IFN-γ
ELISpot after 4 weeks. Both vaccines elicited IFN-γ producing T cells and no differences were
observed between doses or vaccine constructs (Fig. 7A). To further assess the Th1/Th2
polarization by our lead vaccine candidate, mice were immunized with either Ad26.S.PP or 50 µg
recombinant S protein in 100 µg aluminum phosphate adjuvant (Adjuphos), which has been shown
to induce a Th2-biased immune response (Lindblad, 2004). A single dose of Ad26.S.PP again
elicited IFN-γ producing T cells as measured by ELISpot. However, recombinant S protein in
Adjuphos induced undetectable or low IFN-γ ELISpot responses (Fig. 7B). Th1 dominant T cell
responses were confirmed by ICS (Fig. S5). Stimulation of splenocytes with S peptide pools
resulted in secretion of the Th1 hallmark cytokine IFN-γ, but secretion of typical cytokines
associated with a Th2-type immune response was low. The ratios of IFN-γ concentration to either
IL-4, IL-5, or IL-10 concentration was high after immunization with Ad26.S.PP suggesting that
the response was Th1-skewed (Fig. 7C). IgG1 is produced during any type of immune response,

while IgG2a is predominantly produced during a Th1-polarized immune response, and therefore
an increase of the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio is indicative of the Th1-skewing of the immune response.
Ad26.S.PP induced a high IgG2a/IgG1 ratio again indicative of a Th1-biased response, whereas S
protein in Adjuphos induced a low IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, confirming a Th2-biased response (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
According to the WHO, more than 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently in
development of which most target SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Our data demonstrate that the design
of the S protein is critical for the characteristics of the immunogen and the resulting immune
responses elicited by the vaccine. While SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies and NAbs have been
shown to be induced in animal models and humans by several vaccines using different vaccine
platforms and different S protein designs (Corbett et al., 2020), we here examined different S
protein designs side by side which revealed specific characteristics for each of them. We show
here that the wt SP is best suited for correct cleavage, which is needed for natively folded protein
and it enhanced the induction of S binding antibodies and virus NAbs in vivo. Initial in silico
analysis revealed that cleavage after the wt SP could result in the removal of the structurally
important cysteine at position 2 of the mature protein. However, replacement of the wt SP by the
tPA SP resulted in aberrant cleavage after the conserved N-proximal cysteine, most probably
required for fully correct S protein folding whereas only the wt SP resulted in fully native amino
terminal cleavage. This agreed well with reduced neutralizing antibody binding to tPA.S versus S.
A high ratio of neutralizing to non-neutralizing antibody binding is a qualitative measure of high
expression levels of S in the prefusion conformation and/or low amount of S1 shedding (Tortorici
and Veesler, 2019). The wt SP in combination with modifications that stabilize the protein in the
prefusion conformation, i.e. furin cleavage site mutations and PP substitutions (S.PP), resulted in
the highest ratio of neutralizing to non-neutralizing antibody binding. In vivo evaluation of the
Ad26-based vaccines encoding the different S protein designs confirms that they all are
immunogenic in mice after a single immunization. Induction of binding antibodies was observed
for all Ad26 doses tested and S.PP was most immunogenic as it elicited the highest binding- and
neutralizing antibody titers. This is likely related to the stabilizing effect of the PP substitutions
and mutations in the furin cleavage site that preserve the prefusion conformation and blocks
shedding of S1 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the combination of stabilizing mutations renders the S

protein non-fusogenic, indicating that the conformational change to the post-fusion form is
prevented, in line with improved antigenicity.
An important aspect in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is to exclude or minimize the
theoretical risk of vaccine-associated enhanced disease that was observed in animal models for
some of the SARS-CoV (Honda-Okubo et al., 2015; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2014; Tseng et al.,
2012). In these models, vaccine-associated disease enhancement was associated with low
neutralizing antibody titers and a Th2 skewed immune response. These findings, however, could
not be substantiated in humans as no SARS-CoV vaccine was tested for efficacy. Genetic vaccines
like Ad26 have been shown to induce a Th1-biased immune response(Anywaine et al., 2019;
Baden et al., 2016; Baden et al., 2013; Barouch et al., 2013; Barouch et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2008;
Milligan et al., 2016; Mutua et al., 2019; Radosevic et al., 2010; Shukarev et al., 2017; van der Fits
et al., 2020; Winslow et al., 2017), and we have shown here that Ad26.S.PP elicited a dominant
Th1 response in combination with high titers of Nab, thereby reducing the theoretical risk of
vaccine-associated enhanced disease. Ongoing animal studies are aimed to further substantiate
these findings.
The potency of the Ad26-based vaccine encoding S.PP (Ad26.S.PP) in eliciting protective
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection was successfully demonstrated in a non-human primate
challenge model (Chandrashekar et al., 2020) (Mercado et al., in press). Ad26.S.PP, from now on
named Ad26.COV2.S, was identified as our lead SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate and is currently
being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276).

Methods
Vaccine design
The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to positions 21,536 to 25,384 in SARS-CoV-2
isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number: MN908947) was codon-optimized for
expression in human cell lines. S designs were either based on the native SP, replacement of the
native SP by the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) SP or a SP upstream of the native signal,
resulting in a sequence encoding SARS-CoV-2 amino acids 2-1273 and tPA leader as described
for MERS-CoV spike protein (Alharbi et al., 2017; Gilbert et al., 2017) In some constructs the
furin cleavage site was abolished by amino acid changes R682S and R685G, or proline
substitutions (K986P, V987P) were introduced.
Protein expression and purification
A plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV2 S-2P protein (Wrapp et al., 2020) with the wt SP and with
the wt SP replaced by the tPA SP and with a C-tag for purification were codon-optimized and
synthesized at GenScript. The constructs were cloned into pCDNA2004. The expression platform
used was the Expi293F cells. The cells were transiently transfected using ExpiFectamine (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and cultured for 6 days at 37°C and
10% CO2. The culture supernatant was harvested and spun for 5 min at 300 g to remove cells and
cellular debris. The supernatant was subsequently sterile filtered using a 0.22 µm vacuum filter
and stored at 4°C until use. The C-tagged SARS-CoV2 S trimers were purified using a two-step
purification protocol by 5 mL CaptureSelect™ C-tag Affinity Matrix (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad Superdex 200
16/600column (GE Healthcare).

(Pinto et al., 2020) the heavy and light chain were cloned into a single IgG1 expression vector to
express a fully human IgG1 antibody. The antibodies were made by transfecting the IgG1
expression construct using the ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection Kit (ThermoFisher) in
Expi293F (ThermoFisher) cells according to the manufacturer specifications. Antibodies were
purified from serum-free culture supernatants using mAb Select SuRe resin (GE Healthcare)
followed by rapid desalting using a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column (GE Healthcare). The final
formulation buffer was 20 mM NaAc, 75 mM NaCl, 5% Sucrose pH 5.5. Convalescent serum
(SER-0743-00001) was obtained from Sanquin, the Netherlands.
Cell-Based ELISA
HEK293 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/mL in appropriate medium in a flat-bottomed 96-well
microtiter plate (Corning). The plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C in 10% CO 2. After 24 hrs,
transfection of the cells was performed with 300 ng DNA for each well and the plate was incubated
for 48 hrs at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Two days post transfection, cells were washed with 100 μl/well of
blocking buffer containing 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma), 1 mM MgCl 2, 1.8 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM Tris
pH 8.0 in 1x PBS (GIBCO). After washing, nonspecific binding was blocked, using 100 μl/well
of blocking solution for 20 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were incubated in 50 μl/well blocking
buffer containing primary antibodies ACE2-Fc (5 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL and 0.2 µg/mL)(1 µg/mL for
radar plot), S309 (1 µg/mL), SAD-S35 (1 µg/mL), CR3015 (5 µg/mL), CR3022 (5 µg/mL),
CR3046 (5 µg/mL), and convalescent serum (1:400) for 1 hr at 4 °C. The plate was washed three
times with 100 μl/well of the blocking buffer, three times with 100 μl/well of washing buffer
containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2 in 1x PBS and then incubated with 100 μl/well of the
blocking buffer for 5 min at 4 °C. After blocking, the cells were incubated with 50 μl/well of
secondary antibodies HRP conjugated Mouse Anti Human IgG (Jackson, 1:2500) or HRP
Conjugated goat anti mouse IgG (Jackson, 1:2500) then incubated 40 min at 4 °C. The plate was
washed 3 times with 100 μl/well of the blocking buffer, 3 times with 100 μl/well washing buffer.
30 μl/well of BM Chemiluminescence ELISA substrate (Roche, 1:50) was added to the plate, and
the luminosity was immediately measured using the Ensight Plate Reader.

Flow cytometry
MRC-5 cells (0.4×106 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and after overnight growth
transduced with Ad26 vectors encoding SARS-CoV-2 S transgenes at 5000 vp/cell for 48 hrs.
Harvested cells were washed with PBS and stained with LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Violet Dead Cell
Stain Kit (Invitrogen). For SARS-CoV-2 surface staining, cells were washed twice with PBS and
then incubated with ACE2-Fc (1 μg/ml), convalescent serum (1:400), and mAbs S309, SAD-S35,
CR3022, CR3015 and CR3046 (1 μg/ml) for 30 min in FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA). Cells
were washed twice with FACS buffer and stained with goat anti-Human IgG Alexa Fluor 647
(Invitrogen) or goat anti-Mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody for 30 min
in FACS buffer. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and fixed with 1x BD CellFIX (BD
Biosciences) for 15 min. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer and resuspended in FACS
buffer before analysis on a FACS Canto instrument (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with
FlowJoTM Software (Becton, Dickinson and Company) and plotted as median fluorescence
intensity of the MRC-5 single, live cell population.
BioLayer Interferometry (BLI)
Expi293F cells were transiently transfected using ExpiFectamine (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and cultured for 3 days at 37C and 10% CO2. The culture
supernatant was harvested and spun for 5 minutes at 300 g to remove cells and cellular debris. The
spun supernatant was subsequently sterile filtered using a 0.22 m vacuum filter and used as the
analyte in the experimentA solution of ACE2-Fc at a concentration of 10 g/mL was used to
immobilize the ligand on anti-hIgG (AHC) sensors (FortéBio cat#18-5060) in 1x kinetics buffer
(FortéBio cat#18-1092) in 96-well black flat bottom polypropylene microplates (FortéBio
cat#3694). The experiment was performed on an Octet HTX instrument (Pall-FortéBio) at 30 °C
with a shaking speed of 1,000 rpm. Activation was 60 s, immobilization of antibodies 600 s,
followed by washing for 300 s and then binding the S proteins for 1200 s. Data analysis was
performed using the FortéBio Data Analysis 8.1 software (FortéBio). Binding levels were plotted
as nm shifts at 1200s after S protein binding.

Differential scanning fluorometry (DSF)
0.2 mg of purified protein in 50 µl PBS pH 7.4 (Gibco) was mixed with 15 µl of 20 times diluted
SYPRO orange fluorescent dye (5000 x stock, Invitrogen S6650) in a 96-well optical qPCR plate.
A negative control sample containing the dye only was used for reference subtraction. The
measurement was performed in a qPCR instrument (Applied Biosystems ViiA 7) using a
temperature ramp from 25–95°C with a rate of 0.015°C per second. Data were retrieved
continuously. The negative first derivative was plotted as a function of temperature. The melting
temperature corresponds to the lowest point in the curve.
Mass-spectrometry
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to determine the N-terminus
on either purified soluble protein or on a pull-down of the full-length S protein from cell
membranes using either Mab CR3022 or ACE2-Fc. The purified soluble proteins were subjected
to direct digest, whereas the membrane-bound spike protein samples were either subjected to direct
digest or in gel digestion. Data processing for the different proteins was performed using
Biopharma finder 3.1 (Thermo Scientific). Each data file was compared to its corresponding amino
acid sequence. Peptides were filtered by mass accuracy, confidence and structural resolution and
reported. In order to pick up low abundant peptides, the thresholds for the MS noise level and the
S/N were lowered 100-fold in comparison to the normal processing method.
Cell-cell fusion assay
Cell-cell fusion assays were performed to ascertain the relative fusogenicity of the different S
protein variants. For fluorescent read-out, full-length wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S protein and variants
thereof, human ACE2, human TMPRSS2 and GFP were co-expressed from pcDNA2004 plasmids
in HEK293 cells using Trans-IT transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfections were performed on 70% confluent cell monolayers in 6-well plates. Transfected cells
were incubated at 37°C and 10% CO2 for 24 hrs before imaging on an EVOS cell imaging system
(Thermofisher). Overlays between brightfield and GFP channels were made in ImageJ.
The fluorescent fusion assay was adapted to allow quantitative measurement of cell-cell fusion by
leveraging the NanoBiT complementation system (Promega). Donor HEK293 cells were
transfected with full-length S and the 11S subunit in 96-well white flat bottom TC-treated

microtest assay plates. Acceptor HEK293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates (Corning) with
ACE2, TMPRSS2 and the PEP86 subunit, or just the PEP86 subunit (‘No spike’) as negative
control. 18hr after transfection, the acceptor cells were released by 0.1% trypsin/EDTA and added
to the donor cells at a 1:1 ratio for 4 hr. Luciferase complementation was measured by incubating
with Nano-Glo® Live Cell Reagent for 3 min, followed by read-out on an Ensight plate reader
(PerkinElmer).
Ad26 Vectors
Replication-incompetent, E1/E3-deleted Ad26-vectors were engineered using the AdVac system
(Abbink et al., 2007), here using a single plasmid technology containing the Ad26 vector genome
including a transgene expression cassette. The codon optimized SARS-COV-2 Spike genes (as
described in vaccine design) were inserted into the E1-position of the Ad26 vector genomes under
transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV-40 polyadenylation
sequence. Rescue and manufacturing of the Ad26 vectors was performed in the complementing
cell line PER.C6 TetR (Wunderlich et al., 2018; Zahn et al., 2012). Virus particle (vp) titers in the
Ad26 vector preparations were quantified by measurement of optical density at 260 nm (Maizel et
al., 1968) and infectivity was assessed by quantitative potency assay (QPA)(Wang et al., 2005),
using PER.C6 TetR cells. PCR including subsequent sequencing of PCR products has confirmed
the identity and integrity of the SARS-COV-2 Spike genes. Ad26 vector-mediated expression of
SARS-COV-2 Spike genes was confirmed by western blot analysis of cell-culture lysates from
infected MRC-5 cells (Fig. 1G). Bioburden levels and endotoxin levels met the preset release
criteria for animal experiments.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting
24 well plates were seeded with MRC-5 cells (1.25x105 cells/well), and after overnight growth
transduced with Ad26 vectors encoding SARS-CoV-2 S transgenes. Cell lysates were harvested
48 hrs post transduction and, after heating for 5 min at 85°C, samples were loaded under nonreduced conditions on a precasted 3-8% Tris-Acetate SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot2 dry blotting system (Invitrogen), and
membrane blocking was performed overnight at 4°C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing
0.2% Tween 20 (V/V) (TBST) and 5% (W/V) Blotting-Grade Blocker (Bio-Rad). Following
overnight blocking, the membrane was incubated for 1 hr with 2.8 µg/ml CR3046. in TBST-5%

Blocker. CR3046 is a human monoclonal antibody directed against SARS-CoV-1 Spike and binds
to the Spike S2 domain and also cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 Spike S2 (unpublished data).
After incubation, the membrane was washed three times with TBST for 5 min and subsequently
incubated for 1 hr with 1:10,000 IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat-anti-human secondary antibody
(Li-COR) in TBST-5% Blocker. Finally, the PVDF membrane was washed three times with TBST
for 5 min, and after drying developed using an ODYSSEY® CLx Infrared Imaging System (LiCOR).
Virus Neutralization Assay
Neutralization assays against live SARS-CoV-2 were performed using the microneutralization
assay previously described by Algaissi and Hashem (Algaissi and Hashem, 2020). Vero E6 cells
[CRL-1580, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were grown in Eagle’s minimal essential
medium (EMEM; Lonza) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco BV), 1%
penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, P4458) and 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA). Cells were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Clinical isolate SARS-CoV2/human/NLD/Leiden-0001/2020 (Leiden L-0001) was isolated from a nasopharyngeal sample
and its characterization will be described elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). The NGS-derived
sequence of this virus isolate is available under GenBank accession number MT705205. Isolate
Leiden-0001 was propagated and titrated in Vero E6 cells using the tissue culture infective dose
50 (TCID50) endpoint dilution method and the TCID50 was calculated by the Spearman-Kärber
algorithm as described in Hierholzer & Killington (1996) (Hierholzer and Killington, 1996). All
work with live SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a biosafety level 3 facility at Leiden University
Medical Center.
Vero-E6 cells were seeded at 12,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates 1 day prior to
infection. Heat-inactivated (30 min at 56°C) serum samples were analyzed in duplicate. The panel
of sera were two-fold serially diluted in duplicate, with an initial dilution of 1:10 and a final
dilution of 1:1280 in 60 μL EMEM medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 2 mM Lglutamine and 2% FCS. Diluted sera were mixed with equal volumes of 120 TCID 50/60 µL Leiden
-0001 virus and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The virus-serum mixtures were then added onto VeroE6 cell monolayers and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2. Cells either
unexposed to the virus or mixed with 120 TCID50/60 µL SARS-CoV-2 were used as negative

(uninfected) and positive (infected) controls, respectively. At 3 days post-infection, cells were
fixed and inactivated with 40 µL 37% formaldehyde/PBS solution/well overnight at 4 °C. The
fixative was removed from cells and the clusters were stained with 50 µL/well crystal violet
solution, incubated for 10 minutes and rinsed with water. Dried plates were evaluated for viral
cytopathic effect. Neutralization titer was calculated by dividing the number of positive wells with
complete inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect, by the number of replicates, and
adding 2.5 to stabilize the calculated ratio. The neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the log2
reciprocal of this value. A SARS-CoV-2 back-titration was included with each assay run to
confirm that the dose of the used inoculum was within the acceptable range of 30 to 300 TCID 50.
Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay
MLV pseudotyped with SARS-COV-2 S protein was produced as previously described (Millet
and Whittaker, 2016) with some minor changes. In short, Platinum-GP cells (cell Biolabs, Inc)
were transfected with a plasmid encoding the codon optimized SARS-COV-2 Spike gene from
strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank: MN908947) carrying a 19-aa cytoplasmic tail truncation, a GAGPol packaging vector and an MLV vector encoding a luciferase reporter gene using Lipofectamine
3000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were
incubated overnight at 37°C 10% CO2 with OPTIMEM transfection medium. Next day, medium
was replaced by OPTIMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% PenStrep and incubated for 48
hrs prior to harvest. The harvested pseudotyped MLV particles were stored at -80°C prior to use.
In the neutralization assay, soluble ACE2-Fc and mAbs CR3015, CR3022, CR3046 and SAD-S35
(ACROBiosystems) were two-fold serial diluted (n=3) in DMEM without phenol red
supplemented with 1% FBS and 1% PenStrep and incubated with an equal volume of pseudotyped
MLV. After 30 min incubation, the mixture was inoculated onto susceptible Vero E6 cells in
MW96 well plates. Luciferase activity was measured after 40 h of incubation by addition of an
equal volume of substrate NeoLite (Perkin Elmer) followed by luminescence read out on the
EnSight Multimode Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). The percentage of infectivity was calculated as
ratio of luciferase readout in the presence of mAbs normalized to luciferase readout in the absence
of mAb.

Direct coat ELISAs
IgG binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen was measured by ELISA with the full-length in house
produced Spike protein COR200099. COR200099 is an in-house produced SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein, stabilized by two point mutations in the S1/S2 junction that knocks out the furin cleavage
site, and by two newly introduced prolines in the hinge region in S2. In addition, the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions have been replaced by a foldon domain for trimerization
mutations, allowing the protein to be produced as soluble protein (see S.dTM.PP Fig. 3C). Briefly,
96-wells Perkin Elmer white ½ area plates were O/N coated with COR200099 protein. Next day
plates were washed, blocked for 1 hr and subsequently incubated for 1 hr with 3-fold serially
diluted serum samples in block buffer in duplicate. After washing, plates were incubated for 1 hr
with goat-anti-mouse IgG-HRP in block buffer, washed again and developed using ECL substrate.
Luminescence readout was performed using a BioTek Synergy Neo instrument.
For IgG1 and IgG2a ELISAs, a similar protocol was followed as described above, but respectively
using Goat anti-Mouse IgG1-HRP and Goat anti-Mouse IgG2a-HRP as secondary antibodies.
ELISpot
IFN-γ ELISpot was performed on splenocytes of mice isolated after sacrifice using mouse IFN-γ
ELISpot-plus kit (Mabtech). Splenocytes were obtained by disaggregation of spleens with the
gentleMACS dissociator. IFN-γ ELISpot assay was performed by stimulating splenocytes from
individual mice for 18 h with two different peptide pools (pool 1; peptides 1-156, and pool 2;
peptides 157-313) consisting of in total 313 15-mers peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids
together covering the full-length Spike protein at a final concentration of 1 μg/peptide/mL. Results
shared in this manuscript are the sum of stimulation with peptide pool 1 and pool 2.
PMA/ionomycin stimulation was used as a positive control (data not shown); medium was used
as negative control and used to calculate the lower limit of detection. Stimulation was done
overnight in duplicate wells containing 0.5 - 2.5 x 10 5 cells per well.
Multiplex ELISA
The Th1/Th2 multiplex ELISA assay was performed on splenocytes obtained after sacrifice.
Splenocytes were stimulated by 48 h culturing in the presence of two Spike 15-mer peptide pools

(pool 1 and pool 2). Resulting supernatants were diluted 4-fold and measured for the presence of
Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-4 and IL-5) using a 10-plex multiplex ELISA proinflammatory panel (mouse) kit (Meso Scale Discovery, V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 Mouse
Kit cat# K15048D). Results shared in this manuscript are the sum of stimulation with peptide pool
1 and pool 2. Ratios of Th1/Th2 cytokines (IFN-γ/IL-10, IFN-γ/IL-4 and IFN-γ/IL-5) were
calculated on basis of cytokine measurements in supernatants by dividing the Th1 cytokine (IFNγ) with the respective Th2 cytokines. Multiplex ELISA measurements were done on supernatant
diluted either 2-fold or 4-fold.
Animals
Female BALB/c or C57BL6 mice (specific pathogen-free), aged 8-12 weeks at the start of the
study were purchased from Charles River laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). Mice were immunized
via the intramuscular (i.m.) route with 100μl vaccine (50μl per hind leg) under isoflurane
anesthesia. Intermediate blood samples were collected via submandibular bleeding route. At the
end of the experiment, under anesthesia, animals were exsanguinated by heart puncture and
sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Blood was processed for serum isolation and spleens were
collected. Spleens were processed into single cell suspensions for cellular assays (when
applicable).
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences between immunization regimens were evaluated for S-specific binding
antibodies as measured by ELISA, NAb titers as measured by VNA, IFN-γ producing cells as
measured by ELISpot and cytokine production by MSD and ICS assays. Comparisons between
Ad26.S, Ad26.tPA.S, Ad26.tPA.SS, Ad26.tPA.WT.S, Ad26.S.PP, adjuvanted S protein, tPA.S,
tPA.S.PP, S and S.PP groups were made using the exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test, CochranMantel-Haenszel test, Mann-Whitney U test, t-test from ANOVA, or z-test from Tobit ANOVA.
Results were corrected for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction; 3-fold Bonferroni
correction Figures 5 A and B, 2-fold Bonferroni correction Figures 5 C and D.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, US) and
R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05). Statistical tests were conducted two-sided at an overall
significance level of α = 0.05.

Figure 1. S immunogen designs. Seven plasmids encoding variants of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were produced: 1)
native full-length S (S), 2) full-length S in which the wt SP is replaced by tissue plasminogen activator SP (tPA.S), 3)
full-length S in which tPA SP is added upstream of the wt SP (tPA.WT.S), 4) full-length S in which SP is replaced by
tPA and in which the furin cleavage site mutations and proline substitutions (K986P, V987P) have been introduced
(tPA.S.PP), 5) full-length S in which furin cleavage site mutations and proline substitutions have been introduced
(S.PP), 6) full-length S with only the furin cleavage site mutations (S.dFurin) and 7) full-length S with only the proline
substitutions (S.PP-PR), which is therefore processed (PR) at the furin cleavage site. Green bars represent tPA SP,
yellow bars represent wild type SP, red vertical lines represent furin cleavage site mutations and blue vertical lines
represent proline substitutions.

Figure 2. S protein antigenicity. A) Radar plots showing luminescence intensities measured with cell-based ELISA
(CBE) and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) measured with flow cytometry (“Flow”). For CBE, cells were
transfected with DNA constructs, whereas for flow cytometry cells were transduced with Ad26 vectors. Luminescence
and MFI were calculated as an average of a duplicate and the MFI were normalized (by multiplying with a factor 342)
to have the highest intensity the same as the highest CBE luminescence intensity. The outer ring of the circles
represents a value of 10,000,000. Conv. serum stands for convalescent serum. S.dFurin and S.PP-PR were measured
only with CBE. B) ACE2 binding measured with CBE (n=2). Data are represented as mean +SD. C) Average
luminescence intensities measured with CBE or MFI measured with flow cytometry of neutralizing ligands and
antibodies divided by that of non-neutralizing antibodies. The black horizontal dashed line indicates the height of the
neut:non-neut ratio for S in CBE and the grey one for S in flow cytometry. D) Western blot analysis for expression
from Ad26 vaccine vectors encoding tPA.S, tPA.S.PP, S, tPA.WT.S, and S.PP in MRC-5 cell lysates under nonreduced conditions using a human monoclonal antibody (CR3046). Ad26.Empty was included as negative control,
and beta-actin is used as loading control
