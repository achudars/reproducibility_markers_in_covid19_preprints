ABSTRACT
Having claimed over 1 million lives worldwide to date, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has
created one of the biggest challenges to develop an effective drug to treat infected patients.
Among all the proteins expressed by the virus, RNA helicase is a fundamental protein for
viral replication, and it is highly conserved among the coronaviridae family. To date, there is
no high-resolution structure of helicase bound with ATP and RNA. We present here structural
insights and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA helicase
both in its apo form and in complex with its natural substrates. Our structural information of
the catalytically competent helicase complex provides valuable insights for the mechanism
and function of this enzyme at the atomic level, a key to develop specific inhibitors for this
potential COVID-19 drug target.
INTRODUCTION
Only a few approved drugs currently repurposed for treating COVID-19, a disease caused by
the human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, despite that its close relatives, SARS-CoV and MERSCoV are responsible for multiple outbreaks earlier this century. As of September 2020,
Remdesivir and Dexamethasone are used in clinical practice.1,2 Therefore, drugs need to be
developed that can be used against the viral replication to help patients overcome the disease
in the most severe cases.
Here we focus on determining the catalytically active complex structures of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA helicase, labelled as Non-structural Protein (NSP) 13 (Fig. 1). This protein is part of the
Orf1ab polyprotein, which gets spliced to produce the enzymes required for viral replication.
The RNA helicase performs two essential functions for the viral replication making it an ideal
drug target. It is thought to perform the first step in the 5’-capping of the viral RNA by its

triphosphatase function hydrolyzing the 5'-triphosphate group to form diphosphate-RNA.3,4
Furthermore, its main helicase function is to enable RNA translocation and unwinding in an
ATP-dependent mechanism during viral replication.
Accordingly, numerous studies have already demonstrated that it is possible to develop
potent inhibitors of viral helicases as antiviral agents.5

Coronaviral RNA helicases share high similarity. 600 out of the 601 residues of the SARSCoV2 RNA helicase are identical to those of the SARS-CoV virus, and 70% match that of the
MERS-CoV NSP13, demonstrating that these proteins are highly conserved within the
coronaviridae family. Despite the importance of this target protein, currently only the apo
structure is available crystallographically. There are no structures currently known of the
RNA helicase bound with either inhibitors or nucleic acids, severely limiting the structurebased mechanistic understanding and the design of more potent drugs. Currently the only
experimentally available information on SARS-CoV-2 helicase comes from a recent study by

Shi et al., that offer a low resolution cryo-EM structure with ATP bound in the active site.6
They fit the crystal structure of the APO helicase from 6jyt to their cryo-EM density maps and
refined using several softwares.7 Recent works mainly focusing on the RNA dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) NSP12,7,8 which is expressed in the polyprotein sequence just before the
helicase, also yielded structures of the replication machinery, including low resolution cryoEM images of the helicase. Unfortunately, the level of resolution is too low in this structure to
model the ATP pocket in a catalytically competent conformation.
Helicase Structures and Models
The recent July 2020 SARS-CoV-2 helicase structure (PDB ID 6zsl) and the almost identical
SARS-CoV helicase structure from 2019 (PDB ID 6jyt)9 were both resolved as crystallographic
dimers (Fig. 2a-b). Interestingly, the dimerization interface is different in the two cases,
leading to structurally dissimilar complexes. In the cryo-EM structure of the RdRp complexed
with the RNA helicase (and co-factors NSP7 and NSP8), the two helicase protomers are noninteracting (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the catalytically active form of a monomer is of interest, and a
dimer may not be the biologically functioning unit.

interaction between the two helicase monomers differs depending on the experimental method used to resolve
the structures.

Here we present the first computational models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA helicase with ATP
and RNA substrates bound. We have performed sequence similarity searches to identify key
domains and homologous sequences suggesting structurally important conserved motifs. We
also performed structural alignments of available homologous helicase crystal structures to
help position the bound RNA and ATP substrates (Fig. 1). A previous computational model
by Hoffmann et al.10 described the proposed helicase ATP interactions. However, there is no
RNA incorporated in these modeled structures. Here, we also present long timescale MD
simulations of both the apo and ligand bound states to address the flexibility and the stability
of our catalytically competent structures. Our results will help guide ongoing drug
development with the identification of novel pockets.
METHODS
Homologous Sequence Analysis
Sequence alignments were done using BLAST with default settings and BLOSUM62 distance
matrix, requesting the most similar 1000 hits from UniProtKB.11 Pairwise alignments for the
obtained sequences were used to count identities and similarity for each residue in the
SARS-CoV-2 helicase.
Homology Modelling
Proteins with crystal structures were aligned with mustang for a combined structuralsequence alignment.12 The apo structure was based on PBD ID 6jyt.9 Missing residues and the
I570V mutagenesis were constructed in pymol. The position of the ATP was determined using
the coordinates of PDB ID 2xzo,13 as a template, modifying residues around the ATP pocket,
except for Arg443 which was modeled based on PBD ID 6jim.14 The single stranded RNA
(ssRNA) was placed based on 2xzl.13
Molecular Dynamics
The helicase model was used as starting point for MD simulations. The system consists of the
helicase, three Zn2+ ions, ATP, Mg2+ and ssRNA with eight uracil bases. The MD simulations
were performed using NAMD 2.13,15 using CHARMM36 force field.16
The system was solvated by 50,000 – 70,000 TIP3P water molecules resulting in a box of 120 Å
per side. To neutralize the system and account for a 0.15 M KCl solution we added 171 K+ and
189 Cl- ions.17 Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) were used in all the simulations and the
particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used for long-range electrostatic interactions. SHAKE
algorithm was deployed to constraint the covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms. A cutoff
12 Å was used to treat non-bonding interactions.
The energy of the system was minimized using a standard protocol via steepest descent
algorithm for a total number of 10,000 steps, followed by 50 ns equilibration with restrained
heavy atoms (heavy atom of the backbone of the protein and the nucleic acid with an isotropic
force of 1000 kJmol-1nm-1) in constant pressure and temperature (NPT) and constant volume

and temperature (NVT; up to 1ns) at 303.15 K via standard MD procedure with a time step of
2 fs.
To help equilibrate the complexes, we used a harmonic constraint on selected contacts with a
force constant of 10 kcal/mol for 15 ns in our preliminary MD simulations to maintain relevant
contacts. These constraints were subsequently progressively reduced and removed during the
next 20 ns, using the colvar function implemented in NAMD. For the apo structure, we
performed five independent unbiased MD simulations, each 1 µs long, for a total of 5 µs
simulations.
To compare simulation results obtained with MD, we also carried out MD simulations using
GROMACS 201818–21 with the Amber ff99+ parmbsc0+chioL3 force field22,23 for ssRNA and
Amber14SB24 for the helicase. To maintain the coordination of the Zn2+ ions, the ZAFF model
was used25. The molecular systems were placed in a cubic box and solvated with TIP3P water
molecules.17 The distance between the solute and the box was set to at least 14 Å. The solute
was neutralized with potassium cations and then K+Cl- ion pairs were added to reach the salt
concentration of 0.15 M. We used the ion corrections of Joung et al.26 as this force field has
been shown to produce stable RNA structures.27 The parameters for Mg2+ are taken from
Ref. 28. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald
method29,30 with a real-space cut-off of 10 Å. The hydrogen bond lengths were restrained using
P-LINCS,19,31 allowing a time step of 2 fs.32 Translational movement of the solute was removed
every 1000 steps to avoid any kinetic energy build-up.33 After energy minimization of the
solvent and equilibration of the solvated system for 10 ns using a Berendsen thermostat (τT =
1 ps) and Berendsen pressure coupling (τP = 1 ps),32 simulations were carried out in an NTP
ensemble at a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar using a Bussi velocity-rescaling
thermostat34 (τP = 1 ps) and a Parrinello-Rahman barostat (τP = 1 ps).35 During minimization
and heating, all the heavy atoms of the solute were kept fixed using positional restraints. The
restraints on the RNA and the protein backbone were relaxed slowly during the equilibration
from 1000 kJmol-1 nm2 to 10 kJmol-1.nm2.
Additional MD simulations, constructed using the AmberTools20 building package, were
performed with the GPU version of Amber18 using the ff14SB force field to represent the
protein,36 the ff99OL3 force field for the RNA,37,38 ATP parameters from Meagher et al39 and
parameters for Mg2+ are taken from Ref. 28. The tetrahedral co-ordination state of the zinc was
maintained using the ZAFF bonded force field.28 Note that additional parameters were
required for the HIS-33 that interacted with the zinc via its epsilon nitrogen by reference to
comparable parameters in the ZAFF using a hybrid of the center ID 4 and 6 models.40 For
structures where ATP is bound, the octahedral co-ordination of the Mg2+ (which involves
bonds to the ATP β and γ phosphate oxygen atoms, one with oxygen of the Ser289 hydroxyl
group and three structural water molecules) was constructed using the Chimera metal center
builder.41 The solute was neutralized with potassium cations, then the protein was immersed
in a box of TIP3P water molecules extending a minimum of 10 Å from the protein surface, and
K+Cl- ion pairs were added to achieve a salt concentration of 0.14 M. MD simulations were
performed in the NTP ensemble, with Berendsen temperature and pressure coupling. SHAKE
was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen, allowing an MD integration timestep of 2 fs.

Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method29,30
with a real-space cut-off of 12 Å. To equilibrate the protein and nucleo-protein complexes, the
systems was initially energy minimized with positional restraints placed upon the solute,
followed by minimization of both solvent and solute. The system was then heated to 300 K in
the presence of positional restraints upon the solute, which were gradually reduced from 50
kcal/mol Å2 to 1.0 kcal/mol Å2 over a timescale of 100 ps. For the apo-helicase structure, all
restraints were then removed. For the ATP-RNA helicase complex which included the
coordinated Mg2+ ion, an additional 50 ns of equilibration was performed with harmonic
distance restraints (set at 2.1 Å with a spring constant of 20 kcal/mol Å2) to maintain the
positions of coordinated atoms, and angle restraints imposing the octahedral geometry
around the Mg2+ ion. An additional restraint was imposed to maintain the orientation of
Asp374 and Glu375 to the adjacent coordinated water molecule, as observed in the MutS-ATP
complex (PDB ID 1w7a,42). Three 1 µs simulations of the apo-structure at a salt concentration
of 140 mM, and one 1.5 µs simulation in neutralizing salt were performed. We have also
obtained 1 µs simulations of the ATP-helicase (two replicas), the RNA-helicase and the ATP
RNA-helicase complex. For all coordinated ATP Mg2+ metal centers, these equilibration
protocols provide stable octahedral geometries, including the complexed water molecules,
during unrestrained MD over 1 µs timescales.
Pocket analysis
For the analysis of the ATP pocket size, we used the open-source cavity detection software,
Fpocket.43 From our MD simulations of the apo and ATP-RNA helicase, we extracted 100
equally time-spaced protein structural snapshots from the last 200 ns simulation of both
systems. We performed the pocket size analysis using several parameter sets using Fpocket
and compared the results for our system (see SI). We then calculated the average volume of
the ATP pocket for the most optimal parameter sets and compared these between the apo and
the ATP-RNA complex simulations. The parameters we modified were: −m: minimum αsphere size; -M: maximum α-sphere size -D: first clustering α-sphere size (see SI).
RESULTS
Helicase domains and their sequence homology
Following previous studies, the single chain SARS-CoV-2 helicase can be divided into three
domains as depicted in Fig. 1. The sequence starts with Domain 1 (residues 1-260), which
features: a Zinc-binding domain (ZBD, residues 1-100), known to facilitate nucleic acid
recognition; a Stalk region shaped by 2 contiguous alpha helices (residues 100-150) which
functions as an interface connecting the ZBD with the rest of the Domain 1 (residues 150-260,
also known as Domain 1B) that interacts with the RNA. The rest of the chain splits into RecA1
and RecA2 domains, which are well characterized in the superfamily 1B type helicases and
bind ATP at their interface.44

Figure 3. Distribution of the pairwise sequence alignments to the SARS-CoV-2 helicase. There are only members
of coronaviridae above 398 matching residues (66%, lime circles, 95 entries). There are no sequences with medium
similarity (235-394 similar residues, red circles). The closest relatives (95 sequences highlighted in lime dashed
frame) are grouped in coronavirus subfamilies with principal hosts highlighted in the inset.

We have obtained the most homologous 1000 non-redundant sequences and their alignments
from the UniProtKB library. About 10% of these sequences show similarities across the whole
helicase sequence and the best 95 has 400 or more positives or similarities in the sequence
alignment (Fig. 3). These are all coronaviruses mainly derived from bat virome (beta and
alphacoronaviruses), and affecting various hosts in the animal kingdom, including humans.
Intriguingly, the next best sequence alignment only covers 235 amino acids as similar residues;
all of these and subsequent aligned regions are specific to the RecA domains and range
through all types of organisms.
To evaluate any similarities to Domain 1 only, we also performed a search using only the first
230 residues. This search for sequences that match at least 70 residues resulted in the exact
same 95 sequences as before, exclusively belonging to coronaviridae. An additional only 21
sequences match shorter segments of this domain between 1-230 residues, corresponding to a
22% sequence identity or below.

Figure 4. Sequence similarity (orange) and identity (blue) of the closest 946 sequences from UniProtKB using
BLAST pairwise alignments to the 601-residue long SARS-CoV-2 RNA helicase. Domain 1 shows similarity only
to the close relatives (95 sequences), while the RecA1 and RecA2 domains are more common across ATPase
sequences. Key structural motifs are highlighted using symbols (P-loop: grey square, DE motif: green square,
arginine fingers: black triangle, ssRNA interactions: red triangles).

Amongst crystal structures containing ATP analogs, most helicases have a very low sequence
similarity to NSP13. The closest homologues are 2xzo, 5mzn, and 6jim with 11.00%, 10.20%,
and 8.40% sequence identity, respectively. Despite the low sequence identity, most residues
in the ATP binding pocket are conserved. At the same time, the closest human sequence
homologue based on our homology search, ZGRF1, a putative RNA helicase, shares only 22%
sequence similarity, restricted to the RecA1 and RecA2 domains. This relatively narrow
bandwidth of sequence similarity can be harnessed to design specific inhibitors against the
coronavirus RNA helicases that do not inhibit human proteins.
Structural model of the ATP binding site
We modelled the ATP-bound active site using the 2xzo structure as a template (Figure 7). The
essential Mg2+ ion cofactor coordinates both the β and γ-phosphates and a conserved Ser288.
The active site contains a DE of the DEAD-motif of RNA helicases. The conserved Asp374
H-bonds with the Ser288 and one of the Mg-coordinating water molecules, whereas the
Glu375 is positioned as the proton acceptor.10,45,46 The γP is stabilized via H-bonds with Arg567
Lys289 and Gln404 through a water molecule, that are found in respectively 95, 56 and 57%

of the homologous sequences analyzed, while βP forms a H-Bond with Arg443. The sugar
region of the ATP likely interacts also with Glu540 and Lys320 as seen in ten and four pdb
structures, respectively. Unlike the highly conserved residues recognizing the triphosphate
pocket, the environment of the sugar and purine moieties (Figure 7, right) shows a greater
diversity. The purine ring is stabilized through multiple π stack interactions, from one side
with Arg442, while in some helicases with a tyrosine, and from the other side with His290 and
Phe261. Additionally, there is a H-Bond between the amino group of the purine ring with
Asn265, a residue which is more typically served by a glutamine in similar sequences.

Figure 5. Conserved residues coordinating the ATP and RNA substrates of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase. Sequence
conservation for RecA1 (orange) and RecA2 (magenta) domains are depicted in logos for each residue and its
neighbors (data from Figure 4). Colored letter represent the residues in the SARS-CoV-2 helicase sequence,
depicted residue indices are bold in the logos.

A lack of specificity towards the purine group is likely due to the dual function of the SARSCoV-2 helicase to aid the 5’-capping of the RNA by the triphosphate hydrolysis of most NTP
substrates.3 Due to these major differences, this area of the nucleotide binding pocket can serve
in the design of SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs.
Structural model of the RNA binding site
To identify the main contact points with the ssRNA, it is first important to understand the
unwinding function of the helicase. Filtering the related crystal structures to the ones
containing RNA, we noticed that the RNA directionality relative to the ATP pocket is well
defined (Fig. 1). The unwinding is driven by a domain-wise translocation process, which

moves the RNA one base in two steps.13,14,47 Upon ATP hydrolysis, domain RecA2 translocate
1 base towards the 5’ end of the RNA which is then followed by the RecA1 when a new
molecule of ATP binds to the enzyme.
Domain 1, being in contact with the sidechain of the RNA, does not feature specific motifs,
thus allowing different RNA bases to translocaste. A long loop transitions into the RecA1 and
2 domains sandwiching the ATP pocket on the side of RNA backbone. This region, equipped
with the necessary functionalities to perform the ATP hydrolysis, has a higher degree of
conservation along the helicases. Both RecA domains have specific residues reliable for the
contact with the RNA phosphates, depicted in Fig. 8. Thr359 in RecA1 and Thr532 are
identified as the main anchoring points of the two domains. The base between these two
threonine residues is coordinated by a backbone NH of His311, an interaction which is kept
in RNA containing crystal structures. Ser310 is also reasonably conserved, although not
directly featured in RNA coordination in this state of the enzyme.
Interestingly, the most conserved motif across the sequences is a GDP(A)Q loop interfacing
between the RecA1 and RecA2 domains. This motif features Gln404, a residue which we
consider to be important in the coordination of the nucleophilic water; moreover, it bridges
the γP and the SH motif discussed earlier. We speculate these moieties play a role in the
translocation of RecA2 upon ATP hydrolysis.
MD simulations
Apo structures
All replicas of the apo structure show low flexibility and no major changes of the backbone
structure of the dimer. We analyze the overall flexibility of the dimers and compare our results
with the experimental b-factor obtained in 6jyt and 6zsl (Figure 6). Our model, in common
with the two crystal structures, shows higher flexibility on the external shell of RecA2 domain,
while the ATP and the RNA pockets appear to be more conserved. The ZBD shows low
flexibility, in agreement with the b-value of 6jyt, but not with 6zsl (especially chain A), in
which the temperature factor is higher, due to the different dimerization of the crystal
structures.

from the MD simulations. The residues are colored according to the deposited PDB B-factors (6jyt and 6zsl; from
blue: low B-factor to red: high B-factor), and by the residue RMSD from the MD trajectory.

ATP-bound pocket
From our unbiased trajectory of the ATP-RNA-helicase complex we extract key distances
along the simulations (Figure 7). The hexacoordinate Mg2+ shows stable bond with 3 water
molecules, the OH of Ser288 and two oxygens of the β and γ phosphate of the ATP, which is
essential for the preorganization of the ATP hydrolysis Further conserved contacts in the
pocket are also kept stable during the simulation: including the arginine fingers, Lys288 and
the DE motif which both takes part in coordinating the Mg2+ and the nucleophilic water.
Gln404 shows a greater flexibility deep in the ATP pocket, which might suggest its role in
changing the conformation during translocation. Residues participating in the adenosine
coordination are less conserved and also exhibit fewer stable contacts.

shown in yellow and magenta, respectively. a) Main protein-substrate interactions of the triphosphate and
magnesium ions are compared with alignment for PDB template 2xzo (cyan lines). b) Nucleotide binding region

5vhc, 5xdr, 5y4z, 5y6m, 5y6n, 6adx, 6ady, 6c90 and 6jim).

Pocket analysis
We identify the cavity size of the ATP pocket using Fpocket. We tested different combinations
of parameters to find a combination that yields more robust results (see SI for details). A
comparison of the average pocket volume from the apo trajectory (394.6±157.5 Å3) with the
average pocket volume from the ATP bound trajectory (367±146 Å3) shows no substantial
differences within the error of the analysis. This finding suggests that the ATP cavity structure
is not altered significantly by the presence of ATP.

Figure 8. Structures of the RNA binding region aligned with existing RNA-helicase crystal structures complexed
with RNA (depicted in lines). RecA1 and RecA2 domains are shown in yellow and magenta, respectively. Key
residues (sticks) are labelled and H-bonds are depicted in yellow dashes.

From the structural analysis and the homology modelling, we denote two important and
well -conserved interactions between the RNA and the helicase. Both interactions involve a
H--bond between a threonine and the O of the phosphate residue on the backbone of the RNA.
Specifically, from Thr359 from RecA1 and Thr532 from RecA2. Additionally, another H-bond
is made between the central RNA and the N of residue 311, this residue is not highly
conserved but the interaction between the backbone of this residue and the OP of the RNA is
present in several PDB structures. A key residue close to the RNA pocket is Ser310; this
residue is conserved (often present as a threonine) and appears to be important for the
communication between the ATP pocket and the RNA pocket.
SUMMARY
We present the catalytically competent computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 ATP
dependent RNA helicase. Our structure is the first to host ATP and a single strand RNA with
detail to the binding modes of the substrates.
The analysis of homologous sequences sheds light upon the specificity of the domain structure
of the viral helicase yielding no match over 40% except close relatives from the coronaviridae
family. Our model features two major improvements compared to the apo protein. The ATP
pocket was reconstructed based on the structural conservation of the most similar crystal
structures including signature motifs from phosphate binding proteins such as the DE(AD) of
helicases, the P loop or the arginine fingers. Furthermore, we identified the main anchoring
points of the ssRNA through the helicase, which are essential to understand the translocation
driving the unwinding activity of NSP13.
With molecular dynamics, we have verified the stability of conserved interactions in our
model as well as improved our initial model to host the nucleic acid. We assess the flexibility
of the ATP pocket with and without the nucleotide bound detecting a well-maintained cavity.
Our work provides insight into one of the elements of the viral replication machinery, ideal
for targeting by drug developers. Our structure can be the basis of structure-based compound
design and screening. Moreover, elaborating the RNA translocations driven by the identified
interactions can reveal other targetable states of the helicase.
