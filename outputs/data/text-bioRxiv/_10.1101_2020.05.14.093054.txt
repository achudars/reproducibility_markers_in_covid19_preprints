ABSTRACT

2

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

3

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for which a vaccine is urgently needed to control its spreading.

4

To facilitate the representation of a native-like immunogen without being infectious, here, we

5

reported a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (designated ShaCoVacc) by incorporating spike-

6

encoding mRNA inside and decorating spike protein on the surface of the virus simulating

7

particles (VSPs) derived from lentiviral particles. We characterized the mRNA copy number,

8

glycosylation status, transduction efficiency, and innate immune property of the new vaccine

9

platform. Importantly, we showed the ShaCoVacc induced strong spike-specific humoral

10

immune responses and potent neutralizing activities by a single injection. Additionally, we

11

disclosed the epitopes of spike-specific antibodies using peptide microarray and revealed

12

epitopes susceptible to specific neutralizing antibodies. These results support further

13

development of ShaCoVacc as a candidate vaccine for COVID-19 and VSP may serve as a new

14

vaccine platform for emerging infectious diseases.

15
16

The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been rapidly becoming a globe pandemic since its first

17

report in Wuhan, China, in the December of 20191. The disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory

18

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which was effectively transmitted from human to human,

19

with influenza-like symptoms ranging from mild disease to severe lung injury and multi-organ failure,

20

eventually causing death, especially in aged patients with co-morbidities2,3. Vaccines are considered

21

to be one of the most effective ways to terminate the pandemic and help to restore the global

22

economy4,5. By May 12, at least six SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have entered the clinical stage

23

basing on different platforms, i.e. mRNA, adenovirus, lentivirus, and plasmid DNA6. However,

24

published information regarding the neutralizing efficacy of each vaccine is still very limited except

25

an inactivated vaccine for which, however, multiple vaccinations are needed to get high EC50 titer7,8.

26

In the past decades, numerous vaccine platforms have been approved for markets or clinical trials.

27

Live attenuated vaccines are weakened pathogens that induce strong humoral and cellular immune

28

response but also with infection risks especially for immune-compromised people9,10. Inactivated

29

vaccines are killed pathogens with intact structure and destroyed genetic materials â€“ therefore, less

30

risky, but also less efficacy9,10. Protein subunit vaccine, viral vector vaccine, and nucleic acid vaccine

31

(DNA and mRNA) are generally safe, but difficult to reflect the conformational structure of viral

immunogen in its nature11,12. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are hulk particles with the unique ability to

2

present viral spikes in their natural conformation and elicit conformation-dependent neutralizing

3

antibodies13-16. A closer mimicking of a pathogen would be a VLP with spikes on its surface and

4

antigen-encoding nucleic acids inside. It is still unknown which vaccine platform will actually work

5

for SARS-CoV-2, making the development of new vaccine platforms of great importance. As

6

neutralizing antibodies have been detected in convalescents of COVID-1917-20, a SARS-CoV-2

7

simulating vaccine may present the antigens to the immune systems in much the same way that it

8

would be presented by an authentic virus, thereby provoking a similar effective immune response.

9

In this study, we designed a candidate vaccine by encapsulating spike within and decorated onto the

10

surface of virus simulating particles (VSPs) derived from lentiviral particles in the form of mRNA

11

and protein, respectively, simulating the wild-type SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized this could be

12

achieved by co-expression of a full-length spike during the production of mRNA-carrying lentiviral

13

particle which we have recently developed for time-restricted gene editing (Manuscript under

14

revision). To package the full-length spike mRNA into VSPs, we designed a spike construct

15

expressing the spike protein with 6X MS2 stem loop repeats on its transcripts which would allow the

16

spike mRNA to be packaged into VSPs via interaction with MS2 coat fused GagPol (Fig. 1a).

17

Meanwhile, as an envelope protein, the spike protein would automatically assemble into the

18

membrane of virus simulating particles (Fig. 1b).

19

To make sure high transcription and translation in the producer cells, we used a CMV promoter to

20

drive spike expression (Fig. 1a). In addition, the spike sequence was codon-optimized and equipped

21

with a signal peptide from the human heavy chain of IgE to boost translation and immunogenicity

22

(Fig. 1a)4. We also introduced two proline substation mutations in the S2 of spike sequence which

23

have been reported to increase the expression of spike and enhance the production of neutralizing

24

antibodies (Fig. 1a)21,22. The resulting spike transcript contains a MS2 stem loop between the stop

25

codon and the polyA sequence so that it could be packaged into lentiviral particles via direct

26

interaction with its cognate MS2 coat protein localized in the N-terminus of GagPol polyprotein. As

27

VSV-G coated lentiviruses are efficiently taken up by antigen-presenting cells and show the high

28

immunogenicity of antigens23, we also included the VSV-G encoding plasmid (pMD.2G) in the

29

production process so that the surface of resulting VSPs will be covered by both spike and VSV-G

30

(Fig. 1b).

31

To examine if spike mRNA has been packaged into lentiviral particle as designed, we performed RT-

32

qPCR and found 3 or 4 copies of spike mRNA on average for each VSP (Fig. 1c). To verify whether

1

spike proteins have been assembled into VSPs and their glycosylation status, we performed Western

2

blot on the lysates of VSP with integration-defective lentiviruses (IDLVs) as controls (Fig. 1d). We

3

found successful decoration of spikes both with and without mutations on the VSPs while more

4

mutant spikes could be loaded. As glycosylation impacts the immunogenicity and immunodominance

5

of a vaccine24, we examined the glycosylation status of the spike on the surface of VSPs. Notably,

6

the S2 bands shifted downwards after PNGase F treatment indicating that the spikes on VSPs were

7

modified by N-linked glycosylations consistent with the resent finding for SARS-CoV-2 revealed by

8

mass spectrometric approach (Fig. 1d)25. Next, we transduced VSPs to 293T cells and evaluated the

9

expression of spikes. We harvested the cells 36 hr postinfection without boiling the samples for

10

Western blot to avoid potential aggregation of the spike protein. 293T cells were not infected by

11

SARS-CoV-2 unless supplemented with hACE226. Here, we still observed the expression of spikes

12

in 293T cells from VSPs suggesting that VSV-G were co-assembled into VSPs, thereby, broadened

13

their tropism (Fig. 1e). We found two major bands for spikes which were likely glycosylated full-

14

length singlet spike and its dimeric/trimeric forms (Fig. 1e). Additionally, we confirmed the

15

expression of spike using confocal analysis of transfected or transduced 293T cells (Fig. 1f). To

16

examine the innate immune property of VSP, we used THP-1 derived macrophages as a model of

17

nucleic sensing and found no significant increase of the type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated

18

genes ISG-15, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (Fig. 1g-i). As VSP-spike-mut incorporates

19

both mRNA and protein of spike more efficiently than the wild-type counterpart, we therefore chose

20

it as a vaccine candidate (designated ShaCoVacc) for in vivo evaluation.

21

To access the immunogenicity of ShaCoVacc, we injected the vaccine candidate to C57BL/6J mice

22

(n=6 for each group) via footpad (Fig. 2a). We performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

23

(ELISA) using the sera from mice two weeks after vaccination to get access to the spike-specific IgG.

24

As shown in Fig. 2b, we observed significant elicitation of the spike-specific IgG. To evaluate the

25

production of neutralizing antibodies, we performed the neutralizing assay using spike pseudotyped

26

HIV which encodes firefly luciferase - a well-established pseudovirus neutralization assay27.

27

Interestingly, a single injection of ShaCoVacc in our study induced an immediate and potent immune

28

responses against SARS-CoV-2 in contrast to an inactivated vaccine which required at least two or

29

three doses of injections (Fig. 2c)8. We also adopted the spike pseudotyped lentivirus which encodes

30

GFP to transduce Huh-7 cells. We found pre-incubation with 1:40 diluted sera from vaccinated mice

31

almost completely abolished the fluorescence which was evident for placebo groups and positive

32

controls (Fig. 2d) in line with Fig. 2c. Interestingly, sera from the vaccinated mice did not inhibit the

transduction of VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus in Huh-7 cells indicating the neutralizing antibody is

2

spike-specific (Fig. 2d). T cell immune response is usually important for the function of vaccines to

3

control virus infection28. However, in case of COVID-19, overproduction of cytokines has been

4

correlated with the disease severity29. Therefore, cellular immunity must be cautious for any SARS-

5

CoV-2 vaccines. Here, we evaluated the T cell immune response here by simulating splenocytes with

6

a pool of spike-derived peptides. We did not found increased expression of IFN-Î³ and IL-2 suggesting

7

spike-specific cellular immune response was insignificant for ShaCoVacc (Fig. 2e-f). This is line

8

with a recent study with an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which showed protection effects, but

9

found no notable changes in the percentages of lymphocytes and key cytokines in vaccinated

10

macaques8. Additionally, no weight loss caused by ShaCoVacc was found during the course of

11

vaccination suggesting no evident toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 1).

12

To dissect the linear epitope profile of the spike-specific antibodies in the vaccinated mice, we used

13

a newly developed peptide microarray which contains short peptides covering the full-length of a

14

spike. We found varying intensities of signals corresponding to certain spike peptides for the

15

vaccinated group while no signal was observed for the placebo treated mice (Fig. 2g). We also

16

quantified the signal intensity for antibodies against the S1 domain and receptor-binding domain

17

(RBD), respectively. The sera from vaccinated mice elicited significantly high signals for both

18

domains echoing our ELISA analysis of spike-specific antibodies and neutralizing assays (Fig. 2h).

19

To access to the panorama of epitopes, we made a heat map for of all vaccinated mice and found

20

epitope profiles for each vaccinated mouse were distinct (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 1).

21

However, we also found three epitopes (S2-22, S2-76, and S2-83) that were common for 66.7% of

22

the vaccinated mice. Interestingly, the S2-22 epitope also appeared in the majority of the

23

convalescents uncovered by our peptide microarray (manuscript in preparation). Antibody against

24

this epitope pulled from sera of convalescents has shown potent neutralizing activity17. Notably, S2-

25

76 and S2-83 epitopes are conserved epitopes and shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

26

(Supplementary Fig. 2).

27

We further revealed five neutralization epitopes locating on RBD, the domain responsible for the host

28

receptor recognition. The identified antibodies targeting these sites, therefore, can potentially block

29

the virus entry efficiently (Fig. 2j). Notably, former studies have shown that the murine

30

monoclonal/polyclonal antibodies that exhibit apparent binding to RBD from SARS-CoV exert no

31

neutralization activities against SARS-CoV-2, likely caused by their distinct structural features30. Our

32

findings thus pinpoint the key structural motifs in SARS-CoV-2-RBD that are susceptible to specific

5

1

neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, we also identified S2-83 epitope (N1178-V1189) locating on

2

the HR2 region, which undergoes a dramatic refolding process during virus entry, leading to the

3

formation of a six-helix bundle structure that finally drives membrane fusion (Fig. 2h). Considering

4

the critical role of HR2 and its high sequence conservation among different coronaviruses

5

(Supplementary Fig. 2), it is conceivable that antibody targeting to HR2 may potentially induce a

6

broad neutralizing activity against various coronaviruses.

7

In compensation to the traditional vaccine platforms, our study provided a new vaccine platform by

8

simulating coronavirus surface protein and internal nucleic acids, therefore, combining features of

9

inactivated vaccines and mRNA vaccines. Due to the limited resource to SARS-CoV-2, we are

10

currently not able to re-challenge the vaccinated animals with an authentic virus. As the VSP platform

11

is based on lentiviral GagPol and no transfer vector is involved, it will not produce insertional and

12

replication competent lentiviruses. Additionally, the large-scale production and quality standard of

13

lentivirus that has been developed in CAR-T industry may facilitate the accessibility of VSP vaccine

14

to general populations. We further revealed the epitope profiles of vaccinated mice and the epitopes

15

susceptible to specific neutralizing antibodies, which may facilitate drug and antibody development.

Cell cultures

19

293T and Huh-7 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

20

serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Primary

21

splenocytes and THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum

22

(Gibco, USA). THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophage-like cells with 150 nM phorbol 12-

Plasmids

26

pCCL-PGK-spike-flag and pCCL-PGK-spike-mut-flag were constructed by replacing the GFP gene

27

in pCCL-PGK-eGFP with spike or mutant spike (K1003P and V1004P) gene. pCMV-spike-mut-

28

6XMS2, pCMV-spike-6XMS2-flag, pCMV-spike-mut-6XMS2-flag were generated by inserting

29

6XMS2 stem loop repeats between the stop codon of spike or mutant spike gene and polyA sequence

VSP, IDLV, and pseudovirus were produced by 293T cells in 15-cm dishes. Cells were seeded in the

2

15-cm dish at a density of 107/dish 24 hr before calcium phosphate transfection. The media were

3

refreshed 12 hr after transfection. 48 hr and 72 hr post-transfection, supernatants were filtered through

4

a 0.45-Âµm filter (Millipore) and ultracentrifuged at 4Â°C for 2 hr. Pellets were re-suspended in PBS

5

and stored at âˆ’80Â°C. To produce GFP-expressing spike pseudovirus and IDLV (IDLV-spike or

6

IDLV-spike-mut), cells were transfected with 9.07 Âµg pMD.2G (or corresponding spike plasmids),

7

7.26 Âµg pRSV-Rev, 31.46 Âµg pMDlg/pRRE-D64V, 31.46 Âµg pCCL-PGK-eGFP (or pCCL-PGK-

Western blot

16

To detect spike protein associated with VSP or IDLV, we use Western Blot to detect spike protein

17

with/without treatment of PNGase F (NEB). 100 ng particles were incubated with Glycoprotein

18

Denaturing Buffer at 98Â°C for 10 min. After adding GlycoBuffer 2 and NP-40 (10%), the mixtures

19

were incubated with/without PNGase F at 37Â°C for 2 hr. Mixtures were then incubated with SDS

20

loading buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology) before sample loading. To detect spike protein expressed

21

in cells, 293T cells were lysed in RIPA 36 hr after transfected with VSP or IDLV. The lysates were

22

incubated with SDS loading buffer supplemented with 2.5% Î²-Mercaptoethanol at 37Â°C for 30 min

23

without boiling. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and

24

transferred to the PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked by 5% fat-free milk dissolved in

25

TBS/0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hr then cut off according to the marker and incubated with anti-flag

26

monoclonal antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4Â°C. The membranes were incubated with anti-mouse

27

secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 hr at room temperature. Proteins were

HIV p24 ELISA (Beijing Biodragon Immunotechnologies) was used to measure the p24 level of the

21

lentiviral particles according to the manufacturer. To detect SARS-CoV-2-spike specific antibodies

22

in vivo, serum from the animals were used to test the spike-specific IgG by Mouse IgG ELISA (Bethyl)

23

with a few modifications. 200 ng recombinant spike proteins were coated in 96-well ELISA plates

24

overnight at 4Â°C in a carbonating buffer (pH 9.5). The plates were blocked with PBS containing 0.05%

25

Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hr. Serum samples were diluted 1: 4

26

using PBS incubated for two hours, then washed and test follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. To

27

find the involvement of cellular immunity, the cytokine production in the splenic cells upon treatment

28

of spike peptides in vitro was measured. For the IFN-Î³ and IL-2 assay, the splenocytes were plated

29

in a 96-well plate at a density of 5Ã—105 cells/200 ÂµL. Cells were incubated with a pool of SARS-CoV-

was followed by an additional 48 hr incubation. Huh-7 cells were subsequently lysed with 50 ÂµL lysis

16

reagent (Promega), and 30 ÂµL lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom luminometer

17

plates (Corning Costar) for the detection of relative light units using the Firefly Luciferase Assay Kit

18

(Promega) with an Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan). A nonlinear regression analysis was performed

19

on the resulting curves using Prism (GraphPad) to calculate half-maximal inhibitory concentration

20

(EC50) values.

Immunofluorescence imaging

23

293T cells were seed to 48-well plates with 0.1 mg/mL poly-D-lysine coated cover glasses at a destiny

24

of 4Ã—104/well. On the next day, cells were transduced by 150 ng IDLVs or VSPs, or transfected by

25

0.6 Âµg pCMV-spike-6XMS2 or pCMV-spike-mut-6XMS2 plasmids. Cells were fixed using 4%

26

paraformaldehyde 36 hr after transduction and transfection. Cells were then stained by anti-flag tag

27

antibody (Proteintech) followed by Alexa Fluor 555 IgG incubation (Cell Signaling Technology) and

28

nuclei staining with DAPI (Beyotime Biotechnology). The imaging was performed on a confocal

29

microscope (A1Si, Nikon) to verify the expression of Spike proteins.
