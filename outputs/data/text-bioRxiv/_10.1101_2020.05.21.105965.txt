Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has generated a global
pandemic and no vaccine or antiviral drugs exist at the moment of writing. An attractive
coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro , also known as 3CLpro ) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors
which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address
potential non-competitive inhibition which targets regions beyond the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this
work, we construct an Elastic Network Model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse the dynamics and thermodynamics of the main protease’s ENM. We found a
rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure in the correlated motions, including allosterically
correlated motions between the homodimeric protease’s active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and
2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate
regions that are distant from the active site for control of the protease function. Our results
suggest new dynamically-driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive
inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragmentbased binding screens. The results also provide new insight into the protein physics of fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.

1. Introduction
In 2019, a rapidly spreading disease named COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,
has since generated a global pandemic. Preventive measures have been taken by a majority of
countries, but no vaccine or anti-viral drugs exist, at the time of writing, although candidates are
under trial. In the longer term, the identification of all potential inhibitor sites at all points of the
viral life-cycle is of interest. Here we focus on the low-frequency dynamical structure of the virus’
main protease, an important molecular machine in the viral cycle, and identify critical residues in its
allosteric control. The work is informative for inhibitor design by identifying control regions of the
protein that are distant from, rather than proximal to, its active sites. Allosteric mechanisms for
distant control of binding and activation fall into two main classes: those which invoke significant
conformational change (the original scenario of Monod, Wyman and Changeaux (1), and mechanisms
that invoke the modification of thermal (entropic) fluctuations about a fixed, mean conformation
(2–5). Such ’fluctuation allostery’ recruits mostly global, low-frequency modes of internal protein
motion, which are well-captured by correspondingly coarse-grained mechanical representations of
the protein (6, 7). One effective tool at this level is the Elastic Network Model (ENM) (8). The

ENM resolves protein structure at the level of alpha-carbon sites only, which are represented as
nodes connected by harmonic springs within a fixed cut-off radius from each other. Local point
mutation can be modelled by changing the moduli of springs attached to the corresponding residue,
and effector-binding by the addition of nodes and local harmonic potentials. The most significant
contributions to the correlated dynamics of distant residues, and to the entropy of fluctuation come
from global modes, whose ENM approximation allows straightforward calculation. This approach
was successfully used to identify candidate control residues whose mutation may control allostery of
effector binding in the homodimer transcription factor CAP (9). This study, and others, have shown
that, while the huge reduction in the number of degrees of freedom that the ENM constitutes, does
not capture the quantitative values of free energies, or their changes on mutation that are seen in
experiment, it can identify the qualitative nature of the thermal dynamics of a protein. Furthermore,
its coarse-graining can determine which residues present as candidates for allosteric control through
mutation. The method, and the open software (’DDPT’) (10) used in the previous study on allosteric
homodimers is deployed here in a similar way (see Methods section) to a coarse-grained ENM model
of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.

A. The SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Protein. At the time of this study (July 19, 2020) more than
37,000 papers have been published in relation to the virus (See COVID-19 Primer). However, work is
still in progress to identify biological and molecular pathways the virus takes. Fortunately, significant
research has already been directed to very similar coronavirus - SARS-CoV, first identified in 2003.
The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences are almost 80% identical (11). Both viruses
encode the main protease (Mpro ), also known as the 3C-like protease (3CLpro ). In its active form Mpro
is a two protomer homodimer with one active site per the homodimer chain (12). Although Mpro is
a relatively compact protein (less than 310 residues per chain), it plays a vital role in the viral cycle
of both coronaviruses: it divides polyproteins expressed from the viral mRNA into its functional
non-structural units (13). This functional role makes SARS-CoV-2 Mpro an appealing target for
drug design. The major research effort to date has been focused on the competitive inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro , i.e. by directly targeting the active site with molecules that competitively bind
to the active site "pockets" (11, 14–16). A significant body of work has been recently published
investigating inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease via virtual screening and MD simulations
(17–24). In 2011 it was found that N214A mutation dynamically inactivates SARS-CoV Mpro (25).

The same research group later characterised another SARS-CoV Mpro mutation, S284-T285I286/A, which dynamically enhances the protease catalytic activity more than three-fold (26). In
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro two of those amino acids (T285 and I286) are changed to T285A and I286L with
respect to SARS-CoV Mpro . However only a little enhancement in catalytic activity is observed (11).
This delicate potential control region will appear below in our analysis (see section B.2.). Due to
the high sequence conservation between both coronaviruses, and 96% amino acid sequence identity
between the main proteases, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro might posses similar allosteric features. Furthermore,
in another study, researchers found the the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.53 Å for apo
(ligand-free) forms of two corona viruses’ main proteases (PDB accession 2BX4 and 6Y2E) (11).
These evidence that the N214A mutation operates through a fluctuation allostery mechanism and
structural similarities between two proteases motivates the analysis of the coarse-grained dynamic
structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reported here. We apply the ENM techniques of (9) to this purpose,
looking in particular to identify non-active, yet allosteric, sites for non-competitive inhibition.

No crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro∗ active form with a polyprotein is available
to date. Only empty (apo) structures or structures with synthetic ligands/substrates attached to
the active site available. Therefore, the ENM study reported here used a recent crystallographic
structure (PDB accession 6LU7 (14)) with competitively inhibited active site to calculate fluctuation
free energies and consequent allosteric energies and their modification under mutation. The inhibited
(with α-ketoamide inhibitors, referred as "holo2") and ligand-free (apo) structures of the protein
are almost identical shown in figure 1. Resolutions for the structures shown are 2.16 Å and 1.75 Å
respectively, while RMSD between them is under 1.5 Å for Cα atoms. Evidently, very little structural
change happens upon the inhibitor binding. These findings further support the hypothesis of
dynamically driven allosteric control of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro , and provide a structure (6LU7) on which
to base an ENM construction (SI, Sec. A).
The resulting ENM of Mpro is shown in figure 2. It takes Cα node masses as the whole residue mass,
and uses a cut-off distance for harmonic connecting springs of 8 Å, based on comparison of mode
structures with full Molecular Dynamics simulations in previous work on Catabolite Activator Protein
(9, 27)(SI, Sec. B). Balancing the requirements of: (i) sufficient spatial resolution of dynamics;
(ii) requirements not to include unphysically small-scale structure; (iii) acceptable convergence of
thermodynamic calculations; (vi) compatibility with the previous studies (28) leads to the choice of
summing the first real 25 modes in SARS-CoV-2Mpro ENM calculations (SI, Sec. C).
A. Residue-residue dynamic cross-correlation map. The first quantity of interest is the map of
residue-residue cross-chain dynamic correlations, which indicates for each residue on the protein
those other residues whose motion correlates with its own (Eq. 1). This gives both a detailed
summary map of the homodimer dynamical structure, and is also significant thermodynamically
since the same elastic communication drives both correlations and allosteric control (4). The dynamic

cross-correlation of motion map for the all residues in the ENM apo (ligand-free), holo1 (only one
active site at chain A occupied) and holo2 (both active sites occupied) structures are shown in figure
3. We discuss the dynamic features of each structure in the following:
A.1. apo. The N-terminus of each chain positively correlates with residues adjacent to the active site
(res 100-200) on the other chain. This is due to physical proximity rather than allostery (Fig. 3A,
wide purple rectangles in lower right and upper left quadrants). Significantly, the dynamics of active
sites on both chains positively correlate, and allosterically, with each other (Fig. 3A, green square
and rectangle in lower right quadrant). These regions are spatially far away: we can not see them at
the corresponding location on the distance map (Fig. 3A, green square and rectangle in upper left
quadrant). The T201-N214 alpha helix (which contains the experimentally-sensitive N214) on one
chain dynamically anti-correlates with H41 on the opposite chain. The same helix, from residue 201
to 213, also anti-correlates with C145 on the opposite chain; while surprisingly (since its mutation is
effective in allosteric control) N214 shows no correlation with the catalytically vital C145 at all. We
observe strong positive correlation between this helix and two regions forming the active site pocket:
residues K137-N142 (loop) and E166-H172 (β-turn) (Fig. 3A, narrow purple rectangles in lower
right and upper left quadrants). However, this correlation can partially be accounted for by spatial
proximity. S284-L285-A286 residues (henceforth SLA) on one monomer show positive cross-chain
dynamic coupling of motion with the identical residues on the other, in this case through spatial

proximity (Fig. 3A, orange squares in lower right and upper left quadrants), but a somewhat
smaller positive correlation spans residues 275 to 306 (N terminus) on both chains with respect
to SLA. This effect suggests strong SLA coupling to a large fraction of the protein domain not
containing the active site. Furthermore, SLA positively correlates with the T201-N214 alpha helix,
which contains the experimentally determined dynamically allosteric residue N214. Beyond the helix,
G215 and D216 show slightly greater correlation with SLA. Finally, SLA negatively correlate with
the active site’s catalytic dyad, H41 and C145, and residues around it (Fig. 3A, not shown). Thus,
we observe both dynamic correlation at a distance, as well as that due to immediate spatial proximity,
supporting previous findings regarding SARS-CoV Mpro dynamically allosteric inactivation.

an addition of the first ligand, especially in regard to two beta sheets (G146-I152 and V157-L167)
and a beta turn between them (Fig. 3B, green square in the lower right quadrant). Interestingly,
and by contrast, the region displaying positive correlation around residues 50-70 in the apo form
is decreased in the holo1 structure (Fig. 3B, green rectangle in the lower right quadrant). In
the holo-1 form, the structural symmetry of the apo form is broken, permitting the asymmetric
magnitude of correlation between chains A and B (Fig. 3B), across the diagonal of the lower
right quadrant). The biologically active residues (green ticks) show up in the ligand’s correlation
with (host) chain A. However, four other regions, not cited in the literature to date, also show
strong dynamic correlation with the ligand. Two of them (res 17-32 and 120-131) can be vividly
observed as spatially proximal to the ligand from the corresponding distance map. Two other regions
exhibiting positive cross-correlation are, however, distant from the ligand (Fig. 3B, blue rectangles
in lower right and upper left quadrants). These regions span residues 67-75 and 77-91, respectively,
and include two beta sheets and a beta turn in each case. The previously reported dynamically
allosteric residue 214 (chain B) correlates positively with ligand on chain A; potentially due to
spatial proximity. The closest ligand’s residue to N214 is 11.2 Å away. Moreover, the ligand shows
positive correlation at distance with the beta sheets on the opposite chain (Fig. 3B, blue rectangles
in upper right quadrant). The fact that the ligand’s motion positively correlates with beta sheets at
residues 67-75 and 77-91 on both chains suggests strong chain-ligand coupling around residues 67-91
region on both homodimer chains.
The dynamically allosteric SLA and the region around dynamically couples to the same residues on
the opposite chain (Fig. 3B, orange square in lower right quadrant). The structural C2 symmetry
breaking upon the ligand binding decouples motion of residues which are far away form the active
site (Fig. 3B, orange square in lower right quadrant). Thus these residues can engage in a collective
motion driven by spatial proximity to their neighbours. Not seen on apo cross-correlation map, the
second half of the N261-N274 alpha helix on chain B appears to correlate positively with four distant
residue groups in 15-100 region on chain A (Fig. 3B, orange rectangle in upper left and lower right
quadrants). Moreover, addition of the ligand enhanced produced an ’H’ shape correlation (on the
cross-correlation map) between four beta sheets, two on each chain: G146-I152 and V157-L167 on
chain A, G109-Y118 and S121-R131 on chain B (Fig. 3B, purple square in lower right quadrant).
This group motion across chains is partially caused by two neighbouring beta turns sticking out of
active site protein domains (Fig. 3B, purple square in upper left quadrant).

the residue groups in interval 15-100 of the holo1 form, is reduced on binding the second effector to
its previous apo level correlation (Fig. 3C, orange square and rectangle in lower right quadrant).
The newly added ligand on chain B shows the same correlation-at-distance with the L66-A70 and
V73-L75 beta sheets, excluding the beta turn in between them (Fig. 3B, blue rectangles in upper
right quadrant). Nevertheless, the cross chain coupling between active site and the alpha helix
(T201-N214) is further increased. The correlation is split into three distinctive regions in locally
’wedge-like’ shapes on the map, two of which are around active site. These structures were also
seen in the CAP cross-correlation map (9), and indicate the two contributing beta strands acting
as a local hinge region. The third region is located around a beta sheet at S121-R131, which is
not bound to the ligand (Fig. 3C, purple squares in lower right and upper left quadrants). The
cross-correlation displays an interesting structure along the helix from residue N201 to T214: the
third region is split into three zones: positive, negative and positive correlation. This sign change
reminds 3-rd harmonic of a standing wave with two nodal points, whereas in 3D those are nodal
planes. The negative correlation region is absorbed by the two positive regions as we reach residue
N214. Unsurprisingly, the two ligands exhibit identical correlations with their host and opposite
chains. Noteworthy, each ligand has dynamics correlating positively with the termini of the opposite
chain, arising principally from the spatial proximity of C and N termini to the opposite chain’s
active site.

result considering that no ligand is present to emphasise the spatial nature of the active sites.
They seem dynamically pre-disposed to dynamic allosteric communication, in agreement with the
cross-correlation map (Fig. 3). Both termini display mutation peaks due to their spatial proximity
to the active sites. Additionally, a very sharp peak is seen around residues 187-192 where a free
loop forming the active site is located. The seven new regions seen on the cross-correlation map
(res 17-32, 67-75, 77-91, 97-98, 120-131, 201-214 and 261-274) form distinctive peaks as well on the
mutation scan.
Furthermore, the experimentally identified residue N214 is signposted by these calculations: its
computational mutation generates the largest fluctuation free energy change upon spring stiffening
of 0.29 % at kR /k=4.00. The largest negative free energy change value of -0.47 % is produced upon
spring relaxation of M276 at kR /k=0.25. These two points define the amplitude of the colour bar.
Although the catalytically paramount residue C145 is not as sharp as other peaks, it appears with
greater strength in a higher mode summation (SI, Fig. S3A). The map is mostly qualitatively
anti-symmetric around middle line (wild-type). However, the quantitative behaviour of three regions
worthy of attention: the region around residue 50, before 100, at residue 150, as well as the sharpest
region around residues 187-192. Relaxation of stiffness at those points cause larger energy change
than stiffening. A very narrow region, not identified on the cross-correlation map, at residues 97-98,
preceding a small beta sheet at res Y101-V104, appears sharply when local interaction strengths are
relaxed.
A new broad region of strong sensitivity to mutation appears on this map at residues 261-293,
which includes an alpha helix at V261-N274. This helix is located on the surface of the protein
far from the active site. This region also contains SLA which appear as sharp lines in figure 4A;
and is especially responsive to spring constant change at L285: a free-energy change of 0.19 % at
kR /k=4.00 and -0.29 % at kR /k=0.25. L285 is in the middle residue of the triad affecting two of its
neighbours; furthermore, L285 on one chain is in the closest contact with its counterpart on the
other chain (5.3 Å).
We also note 7 residues which are located on the homodimer chains’ interface (K5, P9, K12, E14,
M276, I281 and S284), recalling that in the CAP homodimer, residues located on the interface were
critical in allosteric regulation (9). Especially responsive is E14 located on the very first alpha helix.

free energy for binding-site occupation is that K2 /K1 ≈ 1 for the wild-type Mpro ENM. Therefore,
this ENM model (over 25 softest modes) is non-cooperative. Nevertheless, we can identify regions
that are sensitive to even slight change in local stiffness which again are around biologically active
areas. All previously-marked active regions show-up to some extent; especially vivid is the region
around catalytic residue H41 and, as already appeared in the apo mutation scan, the loop around
the active site (res 187-192). Residue N214 shows very weak allosteric control in this scan. The local
environment around N214 is mainly hydrophobic (SI, Fig. S4). Therefore, the experimentallyreported N214A mutation corresponds to a local structural stiffening (asparagine (N) is hydrophilic
while alanine (A) is hydrophobic). This is indeed the region of parameter space (kR /k>1) where
this mutation displays a weak effect in the ENM model, but a strong response upon relaxation.
In SARS-CoV-2 Mpro residues T285 and I286 are replaced by L285 and A286 with respect to
SARS-CoV Mpro . Purely from the perspective of hydrophobicity of residue and environment, the
former mutation would correspond to kR /k>1, while the latter emulates kR /k<1. However, no exact
comparison with experimental data can be made as there is no data on how S284-L285-A286/A
simultaneous mutation affects SARS-CoV-2 Mpro catalytic activity. Without data on single mutations
within the SLA region, we have no direct experimental verification of the single S284A mutation

which in our ENM corresponds to kR /k>1 for similar reasons as for N214A mutation (SI, Fig. S4).
We see a decrease in cooperativity for S284 spring stiffening, while for spring relaxation the ENM’s
cooperativity increases.

C. 2-point mutational scans. It is of interest to explore the cooperative effect of two-point mutations
in models of fluctuation allostery, as previous work has indicated that double mutations may combine
non-linearly in control of the allosteric landscape of proteins (27). This numerical scan explores
cases where mutations are made not only on one of the single homodimeric chains: experimentally
this is a possible, but not a trivial, task. However it can reveal contribution of each chain alone to
fluctuation and allostery of the dimeric composite structure. The discussion of this sections refers to
results presented in the 2-point scans of 6LU7 ENM in figure 5. In order to present the response to
all double-mutations on a single 2D plot, the change in spring stiffness is not scanned; rather, just
two constant spring changes of 0.25 and 4.00 are considered. Spring-stiffening 2-point mutational
scans (Fig. 5A,C), kR /k=4.00, models the effect of small molecule/ligand binding to the mutated
residues (and would also model mutations such as N214A (SI, Fig. S4)); while kR /k=0.25 map
looks at the opposite extreme to the stiffening case, which would model mutations that weaken local
bonding (Fig. 5B,D).

scans, is the difference in total free energy of the apo structure. As on the 1-point map for apo 6LU7
structure strong lines are observed (Fig. 5A,B), but spring relaxation resolves fewer biologically
active residues than spring stiffening. In figure 5A only residues around H41, a loop region forming
active site at D187-A191 and N214 show up as solid lines. Whilst, stiffening (Fig. 5B) resolves
all bioactive residues except H163-L167 (beta sheet forming the active site pocket) with with an
additional region around a small beta sheet (Y101-V104), alpha helices (T201-N214 and V261-N274)
and loop region adjacent to the latter helix. As in case of the 1-point map (Fig. 4A) M276 (-0.47 %)
and N214 (0.29 %) define maximum absolute response upon relaxation and stiffening of these residues
on both chains, respectively (Fig. 5A,B). In both cases the SLA region show moderate fluctuation
free energy change. We conclude that stiffening is a better choice for resolving critical residues in
fluctuation free energy control. Note that, in the case of this protein, the 2-point mutations combine
approximately linearly: the effect of the first mutation (vertical lines) is not strongly affected by the
second mutation. Nevertheless, response to relaxation and stiffening qualitatively different plots.

C.2. Allosteric free energy 2-point mutation scan. Finally, the effect of all double mutations upon

spring relaxation and stiffening on the allosteric free energy between the two active sites was
calculated (Fig. 5C,D). While the 2-point apo maps show qualitatively different behaviour for
relaxation and stiffening, the allosteric free energy 2-point mutation maps are qualitatively exactly

the same with an inverted allosteric free energy change sign. A new strong control site that did not
appear on the 2-point apo maps (Fig. 5A,B) is found at the beginning of the second beta-sheet
(T25-L32) on each chain (Fig. 5C,D). Additionally, S1 and G302 exhibit strong allosteric control
due to spatial closeness to the active site and, thus, the ligand. The apparent increased cooperativity
for both mutations (in most cases) on chain A, and the same pattern of decreased cooperativity on
chain B, is due to the formal symmetry breaking through choice of the first binding site at chain A.
Mutation of residues around H41 are the exception, and have an opposite effect on allostery to all
others. The dashed lines represent the 1-point allo scan in figure 4 for corresponding kR /k values.
In that scan K2 /K1 values range from 0.998 to 1.010, while for these 2-point mutational scans the
range is slightly increased.
This calculation draws attention to an additional advantage of the 2-point scans: while N214 did
not exhibit allosteric control on the 1-point map (Fig. 4C) over 25 fluctuation modes, it appears
as a strong line in all quadrants on the 2-point maps. However, when the lines intersect in the
cross-chain quadrant K2 /K1 reaches almost wild-type value (corresponding to making exactly the
same change on both monomers). This effect explains why we do not observe allosteric control of
N214 on the 1-point mutational map: evidently, when the bold lines intersect (identical mutation or
binding on both domains) allosteric effects interfere destructively. Thus, in the 1-point allo scan for
6LU7 ENM amplitude of K2 /K1 is lower than in the 2-point mutational allosteric scan or hardly
shows up. The SLA region appears neither on the 1-point nor 2-point global maps for dynamic
regulation of allostery in spite of its presence on the free-energy apo scans. This absence of control
indicates the limited coupling between SLA and the given ligand (α-ketoamide inhibitor).

The ENM analysis reinforces previous findings in application to other proteins, that in the SARSCoV-2 Mpro as well, local harmonic potentials within the equilibrium protein structure, but without
mean structural change can identify already known biologically active sites. Furthermore, there is
no need to have holo forms of the protein to locate those active sites, whose correlated dynamics are
already clear in the apo form. Calculations of those sites where total free energies are sensitive to
mutations converge well with the limit of the sum over normal modes. The convergence of calculations
of control of the allosteric free energy itself is more subject to noise, being a difference-quantity, but
sufficiently to identify strong candidates for control regions (SI, Fig. S3).
The analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 Mpro possesses a rich dynamical structure that supports several
long-distance allosteric effects through thermal excitation of global normal modes. In particular the
motions in the vicinity of two active sites are correlated within the first 25 non-trivial normal modes,
especially in the singly-bound dimer. Although, at the level of ENM calculations, this does not lead
to cooperativity in the WT structure, it does render the protein susceptible to the introduction of
cooperativity by mutation.
Our methodology is further supported by the ENM dynamics sensitivity to residue 214 and 284-286
mutation which has been previously experimentally verified to dynamically control SARS-CoV Mpro .
The ENM calculations have identified new sites whose local thermal dynamics dynamically correlate
with those of the active sites, and which also appear on global maps for allosteric control by single
or double mutations. The new candidate control regions are summarised in table 1. In particular,
residues around the beta sheets (Y101-V104, G109-Y118 and S121-R131) and the alpha helices
(T201-N214 and V261-N274) are novel, and distant from the active site (SI, Fig. S5). The position
of these residues suggest them as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites.
We also draw attention to eight residues located on Mpro interface surface (Tab. 1) as a potential

dynamically allosteric control residues.
Computational studies such as this, therefore, accompany and support concurrent experimental
programs of scanning for small-molecule binding candidates to the protein in question. We note that
several candidate molecules, identified in a very recent large crystallographic fragment screen against
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (29), bind to regions suggested as dynamically sensitive control candidates in
this study.
The ENM model employed was specific for the given inhibitor. Other ligands might, of course, show
different behaviour in the corresponding holo structures and display other "hot-spots", however,
the appearance of active regions, and their coupling, in the apo structure suggests that there are
general properties that emerge from the global elastic structure of the protein. As well as providing

specific information on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure of the calculations reported there, the
findings of this study also contribute to the large programme of research on fluctuation-induced
allostery without conformational change. In particular the general question of the focusing of
dynamic correlations between distant (so candidate allosteric) sites is solved in a highly specific
way by this structure. It also constitutes a system for which double mutations contribute in a
predominantly linear addition, in contrast to findings with other allosteric homodimers. This pattern
includes the cancellation phenomenon we identified in the case of some single point mutations made
identically and simultaneously in both monomers, whose cancellation in the 1-d scans can mask
their potential sensitivity as target sites. Finally, the appearance of control regions on the exterior
surface of proteins, with obvious pharmacological application, generates other general questions in
the biophysics of fluctuation elasticity in globular proteins.

Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) of ENM describes protein motions around equilibrium and can be used to
calculate the partition function for large scale harmonic thermal fluctuations in protein structure, including
those responsible for allostery (30) . Two main approximations of NMA are:

325

• The structure fluctuates about at local energy minimum. Consequently no other structures beyond
the given equilibrium can be explored.

326

• The force field everywhere arises from sums over ENM harmonic

324

327

The whole NMA method can be reduced to three steps:

329

1. Construct mass-weighted Hessian for a system. For a protein ENM the system consists of the
co-ordinates of the C-alpha atoms (N ) for each residue from the corresponding PDB structure.

330

2. Diagonalise the mass-weighted Hessian to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the normal modes.

328

331
332

3. Calculate the partition function (and so free energy) from the product over the normal mode harmonic
oscillations.

A−1 H̃ A = Λ
∂ 2 Vij
