Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants emerged respectively in United Kingdom and South Africa
and spread in many countries. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains and examined
their sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs, in comparison with
a D614G reference virus. We established a novel rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells
that become GFP+ after overnight infection. B.1.1.7 was neutralized by 79/83 sera from
convalescent patients collected up to 9 months post symptoms, almost similar to D614G. There was
a mean 6-fold reduction in titers and even loss of activity against B.1.351 in 40% of convalescent sera
after 9 months. Early sera from 19 vaccinated individuals were almost as potent against B.1.1.7 but
less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Nasal swabs from vaccine recipients were
not neutralizing, except in individuals who were diagnosed COVID-19+ before vaccination. Thus,
faster-spreading variants acquired a partial resistance to humoral immunity generated by natural
infection or vaccination, mostly visible in individuals with low antibody levels.
SARS-CoV-2 variants rapidly emerged in humans and supplanted ancestral strains1-5. Their increased
rates of inter-individual transmissions conferred a replication advantage at the population level. One
of the first identified variant includes the D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which enhances viral
infectivity and shifts Spike conformation towards an ACE2-binding fusion-competent state, without
significantly modifying sensitivity to antibody neutralization

1,6-8

. More recently, novel variants

appeared in different countries, with combinations of mutations and deletions in the RBD and Nterminal Domains (NTD) of Spike as well as in other proteins. The B.1.1.7 variant emerged in the UK,
the B.1.351 variant (also termed 501Y.V2) in South Africa and the P.1 and P.2 lineages in Brazil 2,3,5,9-12.
Although different, the variants share common characteristics, including known escape mutations that
were previously identified under antibody pressure selection in vitro 2,3,13-17. Some of the mutations or
deletions were also identified in immuno-compromised individuals with prolonged infectious viral
shedding and treated with convalescent plasma or anti-Spike monoclonal antibodies 3,17-19, indicating
that antibody escape mutations are selected in vivo. The sensitivity to antibody neutralisation varies
with the viral variant. B.1.1.7 seems to be more sensitive to neutralization than B.1.351. The RBD
mutation N501Y that increases affinity to ACE2 and is present in B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 20 does not impair
on its own post-vaccine serum neutralization 21. The other mutations in B.1.1.7 have been suggested
to not result in immune evasion of linear epitopes 22. Mutations in B.1.351 and P.1 strains, including
E484K and K417N/T, are of high concern, since they partly compromise neutralization generated by
previous infection or vaccination

pseudovirus, with slightly reduced titers in some vaccinees, when compared to the Wuhan reference
strain 26,27. The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine also induces neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
variants, with however a 5-10 fold reduction in efficacy against the B.1.351 Spike, when compared to
pseudovirus bearing the D614G mutation 27,28.
Neutralization efficacy was so far mostly assessed using VSV-derived or lentivirus-derived pseudovirus
assays, or with infectious SARS-CoV-2 carrying point mutations in the Spike. One recent report using
infectious B.1.351 virus showed that plasma from six convalescent donors were strongly attenuated
against this strain, with 6 to 200-fold higher IC50 values relative to ancestral virus

29

. It is thus of

outmost importance to use authentic variant strains in addition to pseudovirus particles to evaluate
their sensitivity to antibodies. Here, we compared the sensitivity of three authentic SARS-CoV-2
strains, the pre-existing D614G virus and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, to antibody neutralization.
Results
Isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants
We isolated the two variants from nasal swabs of patients with RT-qPCR and sequence-diagnosed
infection. The viruses were amplified by one to two passages on Vero cells. Sequences of the outgrown
viruses confirmed the identity of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Viral stocks were titrated using S-Fuse
reporter cells 30. These cells are derived from U2OS-ACE2+ cells and carry the GFP-split system. Upon
infection, the cells produce the Spike at their surface and fuse with neighbouring cells, generating a
GFP signal after a few hours 30 (Fig. 1a). The number of GFP+ cells correlated with the viral inoculum
(Fig. 1b). Neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting the RBD can be
classified into 4 main categories 31,32. We tested with the S-Fuse assay the sensitivity of the three viral
strains to two anti-RBD antibodies, mAb102 and mAb48, that belong to the first category, and act by
blocking ACE2 and binding to “up” RBDs 32. MAb102 efficiently and similarly neutralized the three viral
strains, with IC50 of ≃ 0.01 µg/mL (Fig. 1c,d). MAb48 neutralized D614G (IC50 of 0.1 µg/mL) but was
inactive against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants (Fig. 1c,d). These results confirmed that the two variants
selectively display reduced sensitivity to certain antibodies. Of note, the activity of the mAbs was
similar at different viral inocula, within a range of 50 to 200 GFP+ syncytia/well (Fig. 1e), indicating that
potential variations in the number of infected S-Fuse cells do not impact the calculation of IC50. We
thus selected for further studies a multiplicity of infection leading to about 150 syncytia/well for each
viral strain.
Sensitivity of D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants to sera from convalescent individuals
We then assessed the neutralization ability of sera from convalescent individuals. We randomly
selected 28 samples in a longitudinal cohort of infected individuals from the French city of Orléans

(Table S1). They were all diagnosed for COVID-19 by RT-qPCR or serology and included critical, severe,
and mild-to-moderate cases. 25 individuals were sampled twice, firstly at a median of 89 days (range:
77-105) post onset of symptoms (POS) (Month 3 samples (M3)), and secondly at a median of 179 days
(range 168-197) POS (M6 samples). We incubated serially diluted sera with D614G, B.1.1.7 or B.1.351
strains, added the mixture to S-Fuse cells, and scored the GFP+ cells after overnight infection. We then
calculated ED50 (Effective Dose 50%) for each combination of serum and virus. A representative
example with the same donor is depicted Fig. 2a, and the results with all donors appear in Fig. 2b. The
D614G and B.1.1.7 strains were similarly sensitive to sera. At M3, the median ED50 values were
respectively 1.5x103 and 1x103 for D614G and B.1.1.7 variants, with huge variations between
individuals (from 102 to 2x104) and the values did not strongly decline at M6. As expected, individuals
with critical conditions displayed higher neutralizing activities than those with severe or mild-tomoderate symptoms (Fig. S1). Again, there was no significant difference between the two viral strains
in each category of symptoms. With B1.351, the neutralization titers were significantly decreased by 5
and 10-fold at the two time-points, when compared with D614G and B.1.1.7 strains (Fig. 2b and S1).
We confirmed these results in 30 sera from another cohort of RT-qPCR-confirmed staff from
Strasbourg University Hospitals that experienced a mild disease 33,34. The samples were collected at a
later time point (M9), with a median of 233 days (range 206-258) POS (Table S1). Overall, the
neutralization activity was lower (one representative example is shown in Fig. 2a and the results of all
donors in Fig. 2b). There was no significant difference in neutralization between D614G and B.1.1.7
strains, with a similar ED50 of 2x102. In sharp contrast, the neutralizing activity against B.1.351 was
particularly low at this late time point, with a median ED50 of 50, representing a 4-fold decrease when
compared to D614G (Fig. 2b).
We then arbitrarily classified the cases as neutralizers (with neutralizing antibodies detectable at the
first serum dilution of 1/30) and non-neutralizers, for the three viral strains and the two cohorts (Fig.
2c). Most of individuals neutralized the three strains at M1. The fraction of neutralizers started to
decline at M6, a phenomenon which was more marked with B.1.351. The fraction of neutralizers was
higher in the second cohort, with 93% of individuals neutralizing either D614G or B.1.1.7 strains at M9.
This fraction however dropped to 63% of neutralizers against the B.1.351 strain (Fig. 2c).
Antibody binding to cells expressing D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Spikes.
We then examined the binding capacity of monoclonal antibodies and sera to Spikes from different
lineages. To this aim, we adapted the flow cytometry based S-Flow assay, that we previously
established to measure the levels of antibodies binding to cells expressing the Wuhan Spike 35. We
transiently transfected 293T cells with plasmids expressing the D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Spikes.
Similar surface levels of the viral proteins were detected with mAb10, a non-neutralizing pan4

the cells fused when co-cultivated with ACE2-expressing cells, indicating that the three proteins were
functional (not shown). The mAb102 similarly bound to the three Spikes, in accordance with its crossreactive neutralizing activity. mAb48 efficiently bound to D614G Spikes, slightly less potently to B.1.1.7,
and lost any binding activity to B.1.351. Therefore, the escape of mAb48 neutralization by the two
variants is due to mutations decreasing or abrogating antibody binding to its target. The N501Y
mutation enhances RBD affinity to ACE2, when tested with recombinant proteins and yeast surface
display

20

. We assessed by flow cytometry the binding of a labelled soluble ACE2 protein to cells

expressing the different Spikes. We observed a dramatic increase of binding of soluble ACE2 to B.1.1.7
and to a lesser extent to B.1.351, which both carry the N501Y mutation, when compared to D614G
(Fig. 3a,b).
We next tested our panel of 83 sera from convalescent individuals against the different Spikes. Overall,
the sera similarly bound to the Spikes, even though B.1.351 displayed a slight reduction in the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of binding (Fig. 3c). We observed a global and slight decrease of MFI at
M9, compared to samples from M3 and M6 (Fig. 3d). Altogether, these results indicate that Spikes
from B.1.351 and to an higher extent B.1.1.7 display increased affinity for ACE2, while escaping binding
to some monoclonal antibodies and either to a lesser degree or not at all to polyclonal sera.
Sensitivity of D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants to sera from vaccine recipients
We next asked whether vaccine-elicited antibodies inhibit infection by the different variants. In France,
vaccination started in January 2020 with the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine. We thus selected 19 vaccine
recipients from a cohort of vaccinated health care workers established in Orléans. The characteristics
of vaccinees are depicted Table S2. Sera and nasal swabs were sampled at week 2 (17 individuals) and
week 3 (18 individuals), week 4 (11 individuals, corresponding to week 1 after the second dose), with
a median of 13, 19 and 28 days after the first dose, respectively. This allowed us to assess the early
humoral response to vaccination. We first analyzed the 16 out of 19 vaccinees that have not been
previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by the absence of pre-existing anti-S antibodies and
anti-N antibodies. A representative example of the evolution of the neutralizing response in one
vaccine recipient at the three time-points is depicted Fig. 4a. In this case, the serum only neutralized
D614G at week 2, whereas B.1.1.7 started to be neutralized at week 3, although less efficiently than
D614G. B.1.1.7 and D614G strains were similarly neutralized at week 4. The anti-B.1.351 response was
negative up to week 3, and became detectable at week 4, at a level lower than the two other viruses.
The ED50 results with the 16 vaccine recipients are presented Fig. 4b. We also arbitrarily classified the
cases as neutralizers (with neutralizing antibodies detectable at the first serum dilution of 1/30) and
non-neutralizers, for the three viral strains (Fig. 4c). Two weeks after vaccination, antibodies

neutralizing the D614G strain were detected in the sera of 5/15 recipients (33%, with an arbitrary
threshold of ED50> 30 for neutralization positivity ) (Fig. 4b,c). The titers were relatively modest at this
early time point (median ED50: 30). These low titers were less efficient against B.1.1.7, with 2/15
neutralizers (13%), and inactive against B.1.351 (Fig. 4b,c). At week 3, the neutralizing activity
increased against D614G and B.1.1.7. There was however a 3-fold reduction in the neutralization titers
with B.1.1.7 (Fig. 4b), whereas B.1.351 remained unsensitive. At the later time point (week 1 after the
second dose), titers increased in most of the recipients, were similar between D614G and B.1.1.7, but
remained 7-fold lower with B.1.351 (Fig. 4b). At week 3, 63%, 38% and 0% neutralized D614G, B.1.1.7
and B.1.351 strains, respectively (Fig. 4c). These percentages increased after the second dose, to reach
80% of neutralizers for D614G and B.1.1.7, whereas 60% neutralized B.1.351 with a low titer (Fig. 4c).
The S-Flow demonstrated the presence of antibodies binding to the three Spikes at the three sampling
times, with a noticeable decrease for the B.1.351 Spike (Fig. 5). Therefore, the Pfizer vaccine generated
a neutralizing response that efficiently targeted D614G and B.1.1.7. There was a delay in the
appearance of neutralizing antibodies against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. The titers remained lower against
B.1.351, even in responders. The vaccine displays a protective efficacy against COVID-19 as soon as
two weeks after the first dose 36. Our results suggest that the low neutralizing titers (ED50 of 50-100)
in the sera correspond to a protection against severe disease.
Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants to nasal swabs from vaccine recipients
Little is known about the levels and function of vaccine-elicited antibodies in mucosal samples. We
thus measured the neutralizing activity of nasal swabs from the series of vaccine recipients (Fig. 5). We
did not detect any antiviral effect in these samples at two and three weeks post vaccination (Fig. 5a,b)
We also analyzed three additional vaccine recipients who were seropositive for N at the time of
vaccination, indicative of a previous infection. Two were diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive by PCR in
March and April 2020 and experienced a mild disease. The third did not report any previous signs
reminiscent of COVID-19. In these three individuals, the neutralizing titers were strikingly high at week
2 in their sera (ED50 of about 104) (Fig. 5c). Two out of the three vaccine recipients who were previously
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 displayed a neutralizing activity in their nasal swabs (Fig. 5d,e). Their nasal
swabs similarly neutralized the D614G and B.1.117 strains and were inactive against B.1.351. The levels
of anti-Spike antibodies and their neutralization activity in the sera and nasal swabs of vaccine
recipients are summarized in the heat map presented in Fig. 5f. In the swabs, we detected anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies in 6/17 available samples at week 2, 7/13 at week 3, 8/10 at week 4 (Fig. 5f). The
three COVID-19+ vaccine recipients were those with highest antibody levels in the nasal swab.
Unfortunately, we did not have access to their nasal swabs before vaccination, precluding determining
whether previous infection, vaccination, or more likely the combination of both generated a

neutralizing response in these individuals. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that vaccinees do
not generally elicit an early humoral response detectable at mucosal surfaces. They strengthen the
hypothesis that some vaccines may not protect against viral acquisition and infection of the oral-nasal
region but may prevent severe disease associated with viral dissemination in the lower respiratory
track.

Discussion
Here, we analyzed the cross reactivity of the humoral response to pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 viruses and
recently emerging variants, in sera from long-term convalescent individuals and recent vaccine
recipients. We report that immune sera had slightly reduced but largely preserved activity against
B.1.1.7 when compared to the reference D614G strain. The B.1.351 variant is more problematic as it
is less sensitive or even unsensitive to a large part of the sera tested, particularly when global antibody
levels are low. The E484K mutation, responsible for antibody escape of B.1.351 and P.1 variants, has
been recently detected in the B.1.1.7 lineage in UK, and thus represents a major threat for previously
immune populations. Here, we used authentic clinical viral isolates, rather than pseudovirus, providing
a relevant way to assess inherent viral fitness and potential impact of additional mutations outside of
Spike on sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. On a technical note, the combination of S-Fuse and SFlow assays, two methods of analysis of viral infectivity, neutralization or antibody levels, allowed a
rapid assessment of the properties of emerging variants. The workflow established here can be easily
adapted to any novel viral strain. Potential limitations of our study are the relatively low number of
individuals analyzed and the short time frame of analysis after vaccination. Furthermore, we have not
investigated the impact of pre-existing cellular immunity, which may be more cross-reactive against
variants than the humoral response. Future work with more vaccine recipients that have or haven’t
been previously infected, and longer periods of survey, will help characterizing the role of local and
systemic humoral responses in vaccine efficacy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that suboptimal
or declining antibody responses are associated with a loss of cross-reactivity against novel emerging
viral strains.

enrolling 170 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and 30 non-infected healthy controls is on-going, aiming
to describe the persistence of specific and neutralizing antibodies over a 24-months period. This study
was approved by the ILE DE FRANCE IV ethical committee. At enrolment written informed consent was
collected and participants completed a questionnaire which covered sociodemographic
characteristics, virological findings (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results including date of testing), clinical data
(date of symptom onset, type of symptoms, hospitalization), and data related to anti-SARS-CoV-2
vaccination if ever (brand product, date of first and second vaccination). Serological status of
participants was assessed every 3 months. Those who underwent anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination will
have additional weekly blood and nasopharyngeal sampling after first dose of vaccine for a 2-months
period (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04750720). For the present study, we randomly selected xx
participants.
Strasbourg Cohort of convalescent individuals. Since April 2020, a prospective, interventional,
monocentric, longitudinal, cohort clinical study enrolling 308 RT-PCR-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected
hospital staff from the Strasbourg University Hospitals is on-going (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT04441684). At enrolment (From April 15 to 29 2020) written informed consent was collected and
participants completed a questionnaire which covered sociodemographic characteristics, virological
findings (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results including date of testing) and clinical data (date of symptom onset,
type of symptoms, hospitalization). The serological status of the participants have been described at
Months 3 (M3) and Months 6 (M6) POS 33,34. Laboratory identification of SARS-CoV-2 was performed
at least 10 days before inclusion by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimens according to
current guidelines (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; WHO technical guidance). The assay targets two
regions of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene with a threshold of detection of 10
copies per reaction. For the present study, we randomly selected 30 patients collected at M9.

SARS-CoV-2 strains were incubated with monoclonal antibodies, sera or nasal swabs at the
indicated concentrations or dilutions for 15 minutes at room temperature and added to S-Fuse cells.
18 hours later, cells were fixed with 2% PFA, washed and stained with Hoechst (dilution 1:1,000,

with the following formula: 100 x (1 – (value with IgA/IgG – value in “non-infected”)/(value in “no
IgA/IgG” – value in “non-infected”)). Neutralizing activity of each isotype was expressed as the half
maximal effective concentration (IC50). IC50 values (in µg/ml for monoclonal antibodies and in dilution
values for sera and nasal swabs) were calculated using a reconstructed curve using the percentage of
the neutralization at the different indicated concentrations.
Virus strains. The D614G strain (hCoV-19/France/GE1973/2020) was supplied by the National
Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) and headed by Pr.
S. van der Werf. This viral strain was supplied through the European Virus Archive goes Global (Evag)
platform, a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and
innovation program under grant agreement n° 653316. The variant strains were isolated from nasal
swabs on Vero cells and amplified by one or two passages on Vero cells. The B.1.1.7 strain originated
from a patient in Tours (France) returning from United Kingdom. The B.1.1.351 strain (CNR 202100078)
originated from a patient in Creteil (France). Both patients provided informed consent for the use of
the biological materials. Titration of viral stocks was performed on Vero E6, with a limiting dilution
technique allowing a calculation of TCID50, or on S-Fuse cells. Viruses were sequenced directly on nasal
swabs, and after one or two passages on Vero cells. Sequences are available upon request.
Spike expression plasmids. A codon optimized version of the SARS-Cov-2 Spike gene from Wuhan
reference strain (GenBank: QHD43416.1), was transferred into the phCMV backbone (GenBank:
AJ318514), by replacing the VSV-G gene. The B.1.1.7 (Δ69-70, ΔY144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H,
T716I, S982A, D1118H), and B.1.351 (L18F, D80A, D215G, Δ242-244, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G,
A701V) Spike mutations were added in silico into the Wuhan codon optimized reference strain and
were ordered as synthetic genes (GeneArt - Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred into the phCMV
backbone. The D614G Spike was generated by introducing the corresponding mutation in the Wuhan
reference strain using Q5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB).
Commercial serological assays. The serum samples from the Strasbourg cohort were first tested at
Hôpital de Strasbourg using two commercial assays: 1) a CE-Marked LFA for detection of IgM and IgG
against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD of the S protein developed by Biosynex® (COVID-19 BSS IgG/IgM). The test
has a specificity of 99% and a sensitivity of 96% for samples >22 days POS. 2) a CE-Marked ELISA assay
for detection of IgG against the full-length recombinant N protein from Epitope Diagnostics (EDITM
Novel coronavirus COVID-19 IgG). The test has a specificity of 96% and a sensitivity of 81% after 28
days POS in our hands. The vaccine recipients were tested for anti-S antibodies at Hôpital Européen
Georges Pompidou (Paris) with the following assays: Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays (Des Plaines, IL,

USA) targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) were performed on Architect™ i2000SR analyzer
(Abbott). Index value threshold for positivity was 1.4 as recommended. Beckman Coulter Access SARSCoV-2 IgG assays (Brea, CA, USA) targeting the RBD were performed on UniCel DxI 800 Access
Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter). Index value threshold for positivity was 1 as recommended.
Qualitative results as well as index values were used for analysis for both assays.
S-Flow Assay. The S-Flow assay was performed as described 33,35. Briefly, HEK293T (referred as 293T)
cells were acquired from ATCC (ATCC® CRL-3216™) and tested negative for mycoplasma. 293T Cells
were transfected with the indicated Spike expression plasmids or a control plasmid using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life technologies). One day after, transfected cells were detached using PBS-EDTA
and transferred into U-bottom 96-well plates (50,000 cell/well). Cell were incubated at 4°C for 30 min
with sera (1:300 dilution) or nasal swabs (1:50 dilution) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA,
washed with PBS, and stained using anti-IgG AF647 (ThermoFisher), or Anti-IgM (PE by Jackson
ImmunoResearch or AF488 by ThermoFisher). Cells were washed with PBS and fixed 10 min using 4%
PFA. Data were acquired on an Attune Nxt instrument (Life Technologies). Stainings were also
performed on control (293T Empty) cells. The specificity and sensitivity of this assay were originally
assessed with the Wuhan Spike using 253 pre-pandemic samples and 377 RT-PCR confirmed SARSCoV-2 cases. The sensitivity is 99.2% with a 95% confidence interval of 97.69%-99.78% and the
specificity is 100% (98.5-100). Results were analysed with FlowJo 10.7.1 (Becton Dickinson). After
testing 253 pre-pandemic samples, the positivity of a sample was defined as a specific binding above
40%. The specific binding was calculated as follow: 100 x (% binding 293T Spike

% binding 293T

Empty)/ (100 - % binding 293T Empty).
Antibodies and ACE-2 ectodomain. Human anti-SARS-CoV2 monoclonal antibodies were cloned from
S-specific blood memory B cells of Covid19 convalescents (Planchais et al, manuscript in preparation).
mAb48 and mAb102 recognize the RBD, and mAb10 binds to a conserved region of the S2 domain of
the Spike protein. Human anti-S IgG mAbs and His-tagged recombinant ACE2 ectodomain (amino acids
19-615) cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector were produced by transient transfection of Freestyle™ 293-F cells
and purified by affinity chromatography as previously described

. Purified ACE2 protein was

biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Statistical analysis. Flow cytometry data were analyzed with FlowJo v10 software (TriStar).

Fig. 1. Effect of two anti-SARS-Cov-2 monoclonal antibodies on D614G, B.1.1.7 and B1.351 strains.
a. Principle of the S-Fuse reporter assay. S-Fuse cells, a mix of U20S-ACE2-GFP1-10 and U20S-ACE2GFP11 were cocultured at a 1:1 ratio and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Cells fuse upon infection and
generate a GFP signal. Infection was quantified by measuring the number of GFP+ syncytia at 18 hours.
b. Linearity of the assay with D614G (blue), B.1.1.7 (red) and B.1.351 (green) strains. S-Fuse cells were
exposed to serial dilutions of viral stocks and infection was quantified by high content imaging. c.
Representative images of S-Fuse cells infected with D614G, B.1.1.7 and B1.351 strains in the presence
or absence of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb48 and mAb102). d. Dose response
analysis of the neutralization by mAb102 and mAb48 on the three viral strains. e. Neutralization of
SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7) by mAb102 at three viral inocula. Results are shown as mean ± SD from four
independent experiments.

three viral isolates. 28 sera from the Orléans Cohort were sequentially sampled at month 3 (M3) and
M6 (left and middle panels, respectively), and 30 sera from the Strasbourg Cohort were sampled at
M9 (right panel). Data are mean from two to four independent experiments. Friedman test with Dunn’s
multiple comparison was performed between each viral strain at the different time points, *: pvalue<0.05 **: p-value<0.01 **** p<0.001. c. Each subject was arbitrarily defined as “neutralizer” (in
blue) if a neutralizing activity was detected at the first (1/30) serum dilution or “non-neutralizer” (in
grey) if no activity was detected. The numbers indicate the % of neutralizers.
