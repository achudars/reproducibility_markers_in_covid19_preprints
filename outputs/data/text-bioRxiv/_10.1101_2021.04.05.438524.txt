Summary
Pregnant women were excluded from initial clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines1-2, thus
the immunologic response to vaccination in pregnancy and the transplacental transfer of
maternal antibodies are just beginning to be studied4-5.
Methods
Between January 28 and March 31, 2021, we studied 122 pregnant women and their
neonates at time of birth. All women had received one or both doses of a messenger
RNA (mRNA)-based COVID-19 vaccine. Fifty-five women received only one dose of the
vaccine and 67 women received both doses of the vaccine by time of giving birth.
Eighty-five women received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, while 37 women received the
Moderna vaccine. All women tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection using reversetranscriptase PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs, and none reported any COVID-19
symptoms at the time of admission for birth. Semi-quantitative testing for antibodies
against S-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (ET HealthCare)3 was performed on sera of
maternal peripheral blood and neonatal cord blood at the time of delivery to identify
antibodies mounted against the vaccine. All women tested negative for antibodies
against the Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) antigen (Roche Diagnostics EUA) to ensure that
the antibodies detected were not produced in response to past SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Relationship between IgG antibody levels over time was studied using ANOVA with
Tukey posthoc. Relationship between maternal and neonatal IgG levels was studied
using Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression on log2-scaled serological
values. Relationship between IgG placental transfer ratio (neonatal/maternal) vs. time
was studied using Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression on log2-scaled
serological values and days. Serology levels represented as log2+1. Statistical analysis
was performed using R 3.6.3, RStudio 1.1.463. The study was approved by the Weill
Cornell Medicine institutional review board.
Results
Pregnant women vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy
and tested at time of birth had detectable immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM response.
Eighty-seven women tested at birth produced only an IgG response, and 19 women
produced both an IgM and IgG response. Sixteen women tested at birth had no
detectable antibody response, and they were all within four weeks after vaccination
dose 1 (Figure 1A). There was an increase over time in the number of women that
mounted an antibody response, as well as the number of women that demonstrated
passive immunity to their neonates (Figure 1A). All women and their neonates, except
for one neonate, had detectable IgG antibodies by 4 weeks after maternal first dose of
vaccination (Figure 1A). 43.6% (24/55) of neonates born to women that received only
one vaccine dose had detectable IgG, while 98.5% (65/67) of neonates born to women
that received both vaccine doses had detectable IgG.

The IgG levels in pregnant women increased weekly from two weeks after first vaccine
dose (p=0.0047;0.019), as well as between the first and second weeks after the second
vaccine dose (p=2e-07) (Figure 1B). Maternal IgG levels were linearly associated with
neonatal IgG levels (R=0.89, p<2.2e-16) (Figure 2A). Placental transfer ratio correlated
with the weeks that elapsed since maternal second dose of vaccine (R=0.8, p=2.6e-15)
(Figure 2B).
Discussion
mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women lead to maternal antibody
production as early as 5 days after the first vaccination dose, and passive immunity to
the neonate as early as 16 days after the first vaccination dose. The increasing levels of
maternal IgG over time, and the increasing placental IgG transfer ratio over time
suggest that timing between vaccination and birth may be an important factor to
consider in the vaccination strategies of pregnant women. Further studies are needed to
understand the factors that influence transplacental transfer of IgG antibody, as well as
the protective nature of these antibodies.
