Abstract
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by infection with the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected the global healthcare system. Drug
repurposing is a feasible method for emergency treatment. As low–molecular-weight drugs have
high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a
strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand- and
protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the
catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), thereby modestly inhibiting the
enzymatic activity of Mpro. Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a
partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of Mpro may accommodate
derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1
pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these
drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity. Our study demonstrates that the
fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low–molecular-weight drugs
against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1-3 has so far affected >4 million people worldwide, with a
mortality rate of approximately 7%. Main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) is one of the most extensively
studied targets of coronaviruses4. Mpro plays an essential role in the cleavage of viral
RNA-translated virus polypeptide5 and recognizes at least 11 cleavage sites in replicase
polyprotein 1ab, e.g., LQSAG (denotes the cleavage site). Covalent inhibitors against the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have recently demonstrated potency toward inhibiting viral replication in
cellular assays6,7; this further underpins the druggability of Mpro. However, these compounds
remain in the early stages of preclinical studies, and the development of new drugs usually takes
years. The lack of drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2currently poses a threat to numerous COVID-19
patients.
The COVID-19 pandemic has implored the repurposing of oral drugs8. As most recently
approved drugs have been designed and optimized for specific targets, they are unlikely to
completely match interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 targets. Compared with 13550 potential
drugs in the DrugBank database at various stages from preclinical studies through approval, the
estimated number of drug-like compounds (molecular weight of ~500 Da) is reportedly
approximately 1060. Therefore, the possibility of uncovering a highly potent and specific drug
against the SARS-CoV-2 is quite slim. Conversely, low–molecular-weight drugs with intermediate
potency and high safety can be an alternative treatment against the SARS-CoV-2. The toxicity of
many low–molecular-weight drugs has been well understood owing to long clinical trials.
Furthermore, their low structural complexity adds odds to fully match the interactions with
anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets; e.g., the chemical space of compounds with <11 non-hydrogen atoms is

approximately 109. This is the cornerstoneof fragment-based lead discovery9, and many of the
compounds in the fragment library were indeed extracted from pharmacophores of the approved
drugs. We therefore hypothesize that it is highly possible to identify a low–molecular-weight drug
containing pharmacophores using fragment-based screening (FBS).
We therefore assessed 38 compounds, which are pharmacophores (substructures) of
repurposing drugs proposed from virtual screening, from our fragment library10-15 against the
SARS-CoV-2 target. As these candidates have been predicted to bind at a high affinity, their
pharmacophores should bind as well, albeit at a weaker affinity. These weak binders can be
readily identified using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fragment-based approach, thereby
eliminating the distracting false positives in virtual screening. Using our NMR fragment-based
approach16-18, we characterized weak target–ligand interactions using ligand-observed spectra,
e.g., saturation transfer difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY. Three hits for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
were identified (Figure 1a): niacin, hit 1, and hit 2 (Figure 1b). The potency of these three hits was
then evaluated using enzymatic activity assay of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Figure 1c). Niacin and hit 1
moderately

inhibited

the

of

fluorescent-labeled

polypeptide

(FITC-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2) by the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
To further map the binding sites of niacin and hit 1, we determined the chemical shift
perturbations (CSPs) of 15N-labeled Mpro induced by the titration of these two compounds. Due to
the severe signal overlap in the heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of
the 15N labeled full-length SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (residue 4-306), the N-terminal domain(Mpro-N) with
the catalytic core included(residues 4–199) was used instead for all the protein-observed NMR
studies conducted thereafter. The well-dispersed HSQC spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-N

enabled many 1H-15N amide chemical shift assignments transferred directly from SARS-CoV
Mpro-N19, as these two proteins share 96% sequence identity. Key residues proximal to the
catalytic site, including H41, V42, D48, N51,G143, H163, and V186, were thus assigned (Figure S1).
Both niacin and hit 1 perturb a common residue V42, suggesting that these two hits bind to the
catalytic core of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Interestingly, these two hits also recognize different sets of
residues in the catalytic core; for example, niacin perturbs H41, G143, N51, and V186 (Figure 2a),
whereas hit 1 induces CSPs of residues M165, E166, and L167 (Figure 2b). Mapping of these
residues to the surface representation of the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB code:
6LU7)6 suggested that these two hits adopted different orientations in the catalytic site, with a
shared anchor point near V42 (Figure 2c). Considering the molecular size of niacin and the spatial
distribution of the perturbed residues, niacin probably binds more than one site. Nevertheless,
the CSP pattern suggests that the catalytic core of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro accommodates
compounds larger than niacin and hit 1.
We therefore searched for low–molecular-weight (<400 Da) drugs containing the
pharmacophores of niacin and hit 1. Molecular docking identified carmofur as a niacin derivative.
Titration of carmofur with 15N-labeled SARS-CoV-2 Mpro-N induced an extra setof cross peaks at a
ligand:protein molar ratio of 2:1, and some original signals completely disappeared at a molar
ratio of 4:1 (Figure S2a). This indicated a strong binding between carmofur and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro,
as confirmed by the IC50 of 2.8 ± 0.2 µM determined using enzymatic assay at an Mpro
concentration of 0.5 µM (Figure S2b). However, the original NMR signals completely disappeared
at a ligand:protein molar ratio that significantly deviated from a stoichiometry of 1:1. It has been
recently demonstrated that carmofur is a covalent inhibitor of the main protease of

theSARS-CoV-2, with an IC50value of 1.82 μM in the presence of 0.2 µM enzyme6; this was
consistent with our measurement as a higher Mpro concentration was used in our case.
Collectively, these data suggest that covalent linking to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is driven by excess
carmofur. Nevertheless, using this fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for repurposing
low–molecular-weight drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
Further pharmacophore identification and molecular docking nominated several
low–molecular-weight analogs of hit 1, for example, triclabendazole, emedastine, and
bendamustine (Figure S3a). The single-dose enzymatic assay showed that these three drugs had
significantly higher potency than hit 1 (Figure S3b). We further determined the dose-dependent
response of bendamustine and emedastine in the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity, with
IC50 values of 26 ± 1 μM and 82 ± 7 μM (Figure 3a). The IC50 value of triclabendazole was roughly
estimated to be 70 μM from the two-dose inhibition rates (31% and 72% inhibition at 50 μM and
100 μM triclabendazole, respectively), as limited by the low aqueous solubility of triclabendazole.
Further, bendamustine and emedastine induced significantly larger CSPs in a dose-dependent
manner than hit 1 (Figure 3b).
Taken

together,

our

fragment-based

strategy

facilitates

the

identification

of

low–molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. First, this approachcan be readily
applied to identify low–molecular-weight drugs against other SARS-CoV-2 targets (e.g.,
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein). Second, a
combination of these low–molecular-weight drugs may be used to gain higher potency than that
achieved via a single compound if their binding topologies show no evidence of steric repulsion.
Finally, although carmofur and bendamustine show higher potency than the fragment screening

hits, the toxicity of anti-cancer drugs remains a challenge in their clinical applications. Conversely,
triclabendazole and emedastine could be valuable in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 replication at the
early stage. It may also serve as a starting point for the next round of pharmacophore
identification. In general, our study provides new insights toward the repurposing of
low–molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific
drugs.
