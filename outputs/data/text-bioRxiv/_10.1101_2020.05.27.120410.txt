Abstract

32

Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019

33

(COVID-19) and preventing the spread of the virus. A novel “2019 Novel Coronavirus

34

Detection Kit (nCoV-DK)” halves detection time by eliminating the steps of RNA extraction

35

and purification. We evaluated concordance between the nCoV-DK and direct PCR. The

36

virus was detected in 53/71 fresh samples by the direct method and 55/71 corresponding

37

frozen samples by the nCoV-DK. The overall concordance rate of the virus detection

38

between the two methods was 94.4% (95% CI, 86.2-98.4). Concordance rates were 95.2%

39

(95% CI, 83.8-99.4), 95.5% (95% CI, 77.2-99.9), 85.7% (95% CI, 42.1-99.6) in

40

nasopharyngeal swab, saliva, and sputum samples, respectively. These results indicate

41

that the nCoV-DK effectively detects SARS-CoV-2 in all types of the samples including

42

saliva, while reducing time required for detection, labor, and risk of human error.

Introduction

45

Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the prevention of outbreaks of

46

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in communities and hospitals. The diagnosis of

47

COVID-19 is made by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of specimens

48

collected by nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal swabs, with the nasopharyngeal route being

49

the standard and sensitivity to the virus ranging from 52% to 71%(1-5). However, swab

50

sample collection poses a risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers. Self-collecting

51

saliva specimens are noninvasive tool for the virus detection and reduce a risk of health

52

care workers. A series of recent studies have shown efficacy of saliva as a diagnostic

53

tool(6-10). We recently reported 97% concordance rate between nasopharyngeal swab

54

samples and saliva in the detection of SARS-CoV-2(11).

55
56

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (nCoV-DK, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto,

57

Japan) is a novel SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, which eliminates the steps of RNA extraction

58

and purification by using the AmpdirectTM technology(12), thus significantly reducing the

59

time required for sample preparation and PCR detection from more than 2 hours to about 1

60

hour. In addition, the risk of human error can be reduced by omitting the manual RNA

61

extraction. However, nCoV-DK was initially developed for the use of nasopharyngeal swab

62

specimens and it remained to be elucidated whether saliva samples could be applied to the

63

nCoV-DK, since saliva has high RNase(13). In this study, we compared efficacy of the

64

nCoV-DK with the direct PCR method requiring RNA extraction and purification using

65

nasopharyngeal swab, saliva, and sputum samples.

Methods

68

Samples

69

Nasopharyngeal swab, sputum and saliva samples were collected from 9 patients who

70

were admitted to our hospital after a diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 71 samples were

71

selected for this study according to the availability of the frozen stock samples. This study

72

was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board and informed consent was obtained from all

73

patients. Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained using FLOQSwabs (COPAN, Murrieta,

74

CA, USA). Sputum and saliva samples were self-collected in a sterilized PP Screw cup 50

75

(Asiakizai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). 200 μL sputum or saliva were added to 600 μL PBS,

76

mixed vigorously, then centrifuged at 20,000 X g for 5 minutes at 4oC, and and the

77

supernatant was used.

PCR

80

Direct RT-qPCR was performed according to the manual "Pathogen Detection 2019-nCoV

81

Ver. 2.9.1" (March 19, 2020) from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases

82

(https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/lab-manual/2019-nCoV20200319.pdf,

83

84

Hilden, Germany) from fresh samples. One-step RT-qPCR was performed using One-Step

90

The nCoV-DK PCR was carried out using the corresponding frozen specimens used for the

91

direct PCR detection as above. The samples were processed according to the

92

manufacturer’s instruction. In brief, 5 μL of sample and 5 μL of sample treatment reagent

93

were mixed and heated for 5 min at 90°C using a thermal cycler to inactivate RNase. After

94

cooling on ice, 15 μL of the reaction mixture containing primers and polymerase was added.

PCR was performed using the CFX96 Touch Deep Well Real-Time PCR Detection System

Statistical analysis

107

Agreement between nasopharyngeal and saliva samples for the detection ability of

108

SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa. Pearson's correlation coefficient test

109

was performed to identify the relation of the Ct values between the methods. All statistical

110

analyses were performed with EZR (Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan), which is a

111

graphic user interface for R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

112

P-value of 0.05 was used as the cutoff for statistical significance.

114

Results

115

Seventy-one specimens were tested by the direct PCR and the nCoV-DK. The virus was

116

detected in 53 / 71 fresh samples by the direct PCR and 55 / 71 of the corresponding frozen

117

samples by the nCoV-DK (Table 1). The overall concordance rate of the virus detection

118

between the two methods was 94.4% (95% CI, 86.2-98.4). Interrater reliability of the two

119

methods was strong (=0.85) determined by Cohen’s kappa analysis. Concordance rates

120

were 95.2% (95% CI, 83.8-99.4), 95.5% (95% CI, 77.2-99.9), 85.7% (95% CI, 42.1-99.6) in

nasopharyngeal swab, saliva, and sputum samples, respectively. Figure 1 shows a scatter

122

plot presenting a comparison of Ct values in each positive sample between the two

123

methods. There was a strong correlation between the two methods (r = 0.837, 95%CI =

124

0.736–0.902, P < 0.01). Significant correlations were also demonstrated in each sample

125

type (Swab, r = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.673–0.905, P < 0.01; Saliva, r = 0.818, 95%CI = 0.507–

126

0.94, P < 0.01; Sputum, r = 0.945, 95%CI = 0.574–0.994, P < 0.01).

128

Discussion

129

In this study, we demonstrate that a novel SARS-CoV-2 detection kit nCoV-KD is as

130

effective as the direct PCR methods in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in all types of the samples

131

tested including saliva. Particularly, it should be noted that our study demonstrated that

132

saliva is a reliable tool to detect the virus by the nCoV-KD even without process of RNA

133

extraction and purification. However, there are some discordant results between the two

134

methods. The virus was detected only by the direct PCR in one sample, while the virus was

135

detected only by the nCoV-DK in 3 samples. It is unclear whether these are false-positive or

136

true positive, since PCR primer sets are not the same between the two methods. In

137

conclusion, the nCoV-DK has advantage over the direct PCR due to shorter detection time

138

by eliminating the steps of RNA extraction and purification, without impairing diagnostic
