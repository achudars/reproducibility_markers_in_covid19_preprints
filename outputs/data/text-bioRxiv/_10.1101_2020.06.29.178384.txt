Abstract
Management of the COVID-19 pandemic requires widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing. A main limitation for
widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among these, RNA extraction kits.
The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic
material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here we propose an alternative method we call PEARL
(Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts
cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based
precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins. PEARL is a fast, low-cost, and simple method that uses common
laboratory reagents and offers comparable performance to commercial RNA extraction kits. PEARL offers an
alternative method to isolate host and pathogen nucleic acids and proteins to streamline the detection of DNA and
RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

TRIzol, a phenol- and guanidine-based reagent
routinely used for isolation of RNA, DNA, and protein,
has been used to isolate SARS-CoV-2 RNA4-6.
However, TRIzol extraction is labor intensive, which
challenges scaling-up to meet testing demands.
Moreover, it requires special considerations for the
disposal of organic solvents. A 5-minute RNA
preparation method has been recently reported, but it
depends on expensive proprietary lysis solutions
originally developed for genomic DNA isolation7.
Recently, direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
nasopharyngeal swab samples without RNA extraction
was reported, indicating that the initial RNA isolation
step could be omitted8-10. Despite encouraging results,
this approach results in reduced sensitivity of
downstream
quantitative
PCR
(qPCR)-based
detection. On average, this method required an
additional 5-7 PCR cycles to reach the detection
threshold when compared to reactions templated on
purified RNA. Because detection of low viral loads is
critical for minimizing false negative results, it is
essential that new approaches do not compromise

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating social
and economic impact worldwide. As the disease
continues to spread, global SARS-CoV-2 testing is
more urgent than ever. The most widely used reference
test for SARS-CoV-2 detection relies on the isolation of
viral genetic material followed by PCR-based
amplification1-2. The first step in this approach is the
extraction of viral RNA from human samples.
Commercial solid-phase RNA extraction kits that
isolate viral RNA are the starting point for PCR-based
SARS-CoV-2 reference tests3. These kits use silicabased columns to purify viral RNA after disruption of
cells and viral particles with proprietary reagents. The
global demand for these kits has made them a limiting
resource for SARS-CoV-2 testing, fueling the
development of alternative SARS-CoV-2 RNA
isolation methods and protocols. These alternative
approaches include organic solvent-based RNA
extraction, and the use of chaotropic agents and
proprietary buffer formulations.

sensitivity. In a more recent report, guanidium chloride
was used for sample lysis in nasal swabs obtained from
COVID-19 positive patients11. Total RNA was
subsequently precipitated with isopropanol. This
approach conveniently concentrates the RNA, which
can increase detection sensitivity in downstream
analyses. However, the use of the toxic chaotropic
agent guanidium chloride requires special disposal
guidelines.

To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we
developed a simple technique to isolate nucleic acids

(Precipitation Enhanced Analyte RetrievaL). PEARL is
fast, easy to perform, and uses common laboratory
reagents. Moreover, PEARL allows the downstream
detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences with
comparable sensitivity to that afforded by commercial
RNA extraction kits. PEARL can be coupled to nucleic
acid amplification or immunodetection methods to
detect host and viral RNA, DNA, and proteins from
multiple sources. PEARL does not require specialized
equipment or highly trained personnel, and offers a
low-cost straightforward alternative to facilitate virus
detection.

RNA extraction kit 1/Cq

We designed PEARL to provide a low-cost, columnfree approach for the isolation of nucleic acids and
proteins that uses common laboratory reagents (Fig.
1A, Supplemental Table 1). PEARL uses a non-ionic
detergent-based lysis solution (see Materials and
Methods) to disrupt cell membranes and viral
envelopes, while simultaneously providing conditions
suitable for alcohol-based precipitation and recovery of
RNA, DNA, and proteins. To benchmark our method,
we extracted RNA from de-identified SARS-CoV-2
positive samples using PEARL or a dedicated RNA
extraction kit (QIAamp Mini Elute Virus Spin Kit,
Qiagen). Next, we used the isolated RNA to examine
the levels of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) gene
as well as the host RNaseP mRNA in the samples using
the 1-step reverse transcription qPCR reference test for
COVID-19 recommended by the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
(TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1-Step Kit, ThermoFisher). In
these experiments, we detected the SARS-CoV-2 N1
site using the qPCR primers and probes recommended
by the CDC.

of initial swab sample input and 500 μL of PEARL lysis
solution resulted in the lowest RT-qPCR Cq values
(Fig. S1). Next, we compared the Cq values from
PEARL extracts to RNA purified using a commercial
kit. We found strong concordance between extraction
methods using de-identified nasopharyngeal swab
samples provided by the Santa Barbara County Public
Health Department (Fig. 1B). However, PEARL,
required a modest increase in initial sample input (1.25fold) to achieve similar sensitivity to that of the
commercial RNA extraction kit we used (Fig. 1B, note
that the sample input for PEARL was either 175 µL or
250 µL, while the sample input for the commercial kit
we used was 200 µL or 140 µL, respectively). Together,

these results indicate that PEARL can be used as an
alternative to commercial RNA extraction kits without
substantial loss in sensitivity.

Puerto Rico in 201515, at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 1. We collected 100,000 cells, which
corresponds to the estimated cellular yield of a typical
buccal swab16, and prepared 10-fold dilutions to
determine the detection limit for RNA, DNA, and
protein. Next, we prepared PEARL extracts and
probed for viral and host nucleic acids and proteins
using qPCR- and immunodetection-based assays,
respectively. To ensure the specificity of RNA or DNA
detection, we treated the PEARL extracts with DNase
I (to detect RNA) or RNase A (to detect DNA). For
protein immunodetection, we treated the PEARL
extracts with RNase and DNase before SDS-PAGE
and western blotting to ensure undisturbed migration
of the proteins during electrophoresis, or left them
untreated for dot-blot detection.

We reasoned that, because DNA and protein coprecipitate with RNA upon addition of isopropanol
during extraction12, PEARL could be used to
streamline the retrieval of RNA, DNA, and proteins
from other viruses. To test whether PEARL can be used
to detect different types of viruses, we used cells infected
with the Kaposi’s Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus
(KSHV), which contains a DNA genome, or with Zika
virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus that contains an RNA
genome and no DNA replication intermediates in its
life cycle13. In these experiments, we used iSLK-219
cells, which are latently infected with a GFP-expressing
recombinant KSHV14, or HeLa cells infected with the
PRVABC59 strain of ZIKV, which was isolated in

To detect host and viral transcripts, we
synthesized first-strand complementary DNA from the
DNase I treated samples and used it for qPCR
detection of the host β-actin mRNA (ACTB) and viral
transcripts. These viral mRNAs included the KSHV
latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and KHSVencoded GFP (Fig. 2A), as well as ZIKV RNA regions
encoding the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS5
(Fig. 3A). In these experiments, we detected viral
transcripts in PEARL extracts obtained from as few as
1,000 infected cells, and we did not observe significant
differences in sensitivity between the detection of
KSHV or ZIKV transcripts. Thus, PEARL can
facilitate the detection of mRNAs from DNA and RNA
viruses.

To detect host and KSHV genomic sequences, we
used PEARL extracts treated with RNase A. Our target
sequences for DNA detection corresponded to the
genes for the host and viral transcripts aforementioned
(Fig. 2A, 3A). In agreement with our observations for
KSHV transcripts, we detected the viral genome in as
low as 1,000 latently infected cells (Fig 2B). We also
detected the host DNA β-Actin locus in all samples,
regardless of the infection status (Fig 2B, 3B). In these
experiments, we used the same pair of PCR primers for
detection of the β-Actin mRNA and genomic DNA
sequences, thus eliminating variability that could arise
from dissimilar amplification efficiencies of different
primer pairs. The primers target sequences in different
β-Actin exons (Fig. S2A), distinguishing mRNA
amplicons from genomic DNA amplicons by molecular
size. As a control, and to corroborate that the
amplification products in Figs. 2B and 3B were not
templated on contaminant RNA, we used PCR primers
that amplify the non-transcribed promoter region of the

host gene HSPA5 (Fig. S2B). As expected, we detected
an amplification product only in the PEARL extracts
treated with RNase A but not in those treated with
DNase I (Figs. S2C, S2D), verifying the specificity of the
amplification reaction.

PEARL can be used as a reliable and efficient method
to extract host and virus nucleic acids and proteins from
a wide range of viral infections.
While we designed PEARL to be accessible, it still
uses a high-speed centrifuge, which is expensive,
requires AC power to operate, and is typically restricted
to professional laboratories. We reasoned that we could
make PEARL field deployable by using a handpowered centrifugation device. Inspired by the work of
Manu Prakash and others who pioneered these types of
devices17-19, we modified a freely-available design for a
hand-powered centrifuge actuated by supercoiling of a
string (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1946291).
We engineered a safety lid and chamfered all edges to
avoid abrasion on the string, and increased the distance
between the pull points to augment torque around the
rotational axis (Fig. S4A). We 3D printed our device
with thermoplastic polyester, measured its angular
velocity using a laser tachometer, and found that we
could achieve centrifugal forces of approximately 3,900
× g (Fig. S4B). To test whether our hand-powered
centrifuge could replace a benchtop centrifuge in
PEARL, we compared the RNA and protein extraction
efficiency achieved with our device and with a tabletop
centrifuge set at 19,000 × g. Despite the substantial
difference in centrifugal force, we found that viral RNA
and proteins can be easily detected using PEARL
extracts prepared with our hand-powered centrifuge
(Figs. S4C and S4D). Thus, this device can enable the
deployment of PEARL in the field without a significant
loss in detection sensitivity.

An additional benefit of PEARL over columnbased commercially available RNA extraction methods
is that it allows the recovery of proteins in addition to
nucleic acids. To confirm the presence of host and viral
proteins in PEARL extracts, we carried out western
blot and dot-blot assays using antibodies against the
ubiquitous host chaperone HSP70, and the viral
proteins KHSV-LANA, KSHV-encoded GFP, and
ZIKV-NS2B. In these experiments, we detected the
host chaperone HSP70 in PEARL extracts obtained
from 100,000 cells (HeLa and iSLK-219) by western
blot (Fig. 2C and 3C) and in as few as 12,500 cells
(HeLa and iSLK-219) by dot-blot (Fig. S3A, and S3B).
Detection of KSHV-encoded GFP was achievable with
approximately 1,000 iSLK-219 cells (Figs. 2C and
S3B). Detection of KSHV-LANA was significantly less
sensitive by western blot than by dot-blot, requiring
100,000 and 1,250 iSLK-219 cells, respectively (Figs.
2C and S3B). Taken together, our results indicate that

The primary tool to combat the COVID-19 pandemic
is widespread and accessible testing to monitor SARSCoV-2 prevalence and spread, which informs
deployment of containment and mitigation measures20.
Globally scaled testing remains an unmet public health
need, as attempts to meet this demand have resulted in
shortages of the reagents and supplies necessary for
sample processing, RNA extraction and SARS-CoV-2
detection. Here we present data to support PEARL as
a cost effective, simple, and less-toxic alternative for the
isolation of RNA, DNA and proteins. Our results
indicate that PEARL enables the detection of SARSCoV-2 transcripts in COVID-19 positive swab samples
with sensitivity comparable to that afforded by
commercially available RNA extraction kits. This
outcome highlights the validity of using PEARL as a
viable alternative to facilitate the detection of SARSCoV-2 in respiratory samples.

Our data also show that PEARL extracts can be
used to efficiently detect host and viral transcripts,
genomic DNA, and proteins regardless of the nature of
the infection—PEARL was equally useful in detecting
DNA and RNA viruses with different tropism.
Coupling PEARL to different downstream analyses for
detection of nucleic acids and proteins can provide a
powerful tool for detection of diverse viruses.
Moreover, because RNA, DNA, and proteins are
extracted at once, PEARL reduces sample handling
time, allowing for streamlined diagnostic procedures.
Thus, it may enable both nucleic acid and antigenbased SARS-CoV-2 testing. PEARL’s minimal
handling requirements also make it scalable, which is
desirable for high-volume testing operations, as is
needed for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Finally, since PEARL uses common reagents and
it does not require expensive equipment or highly
trained personnel, it can provide an accessible
alternative for streamlining diagnostics in geographic
areas that lack access to capital, specialized reagents,
and professional laboratories. Moreover, PEARL is
field-deployable, given that a hand-powered
centrifugation device can be used. In view of these
considerations, coupling PEARL to our recently
developed CRISPR-based protocol for detection of
SARS-CoV-2 genetic material called CREST (Cas13based, Rugged, Equitable, Scalable Testing)24 could
allow efficient, affordable, widespread testing, lowering
the barrier of “luxury testing” in many regions of the
world.

Materials and Methods

It is possible that the collection medium used to
store samples before processing may influence the
performance of PEARL. For example, the viral
transport media recommended by the CDC to store
and inactivate samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing (2%
Fetal Bovine Serum, 100 µg/mL Gentamicin, 0.5
µg/mL Amphotericin B, and various salts)21 has
components that could co-precipitate with target
analytes. Isopropanol is less polar than ethanol, and
therefore, it has a higher propensity to precipitate salts
and antibiotics22. In our experiments, co-precipitation
of salts and antibiotics does not appear to compromise
downstream RT-qPCR or immunodetection assays.
Concerns regarding the inhibition of downstream
detection assays could be addressed by using ethanol
instead of isopropanol.

Samples were mixed in a 1:2 (v/v) sample:lysis
solution (0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 450 mM sodium
acetate, 20 % glycerol, 20 mM TCEP, 50 μg/ml linear
polyacrylamide, and 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.2)
ratio and incubated for 5-minutes at room temperature.
Next, nucleic acids and proteins were precipitated on
ice, for 10 minutes, using one volume of cold
isopropanol. The precipitated material was collected by
centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 10 minutes, washed
once with 75% ethanol, air-dried for 5 minutes at room
temperature and solubilized in 20 μl of nuclease-free
water for amplification-based detection of nucleic acids
or immunodetection of proteins.

and infections. All cell lines were
maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum
(FBS),
L-Glutamine,
and
antibiotics
(penicillin/streptomycin, 100 units/mL), and were
maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5%
CO2. iSLK-219 cells are latently infected with
KSHV.21914. This recombinant virus is maintained in
cells as an episome. GFP is constitutively expressed
from the episome, under the control of the human EF1
promoter. iSLK-219 cells also harbor the gene for a
doxycycline-inducible KSHV RTA transcription
activator. Uninfected iSLK and KSHV-infected iSLK219 cells were grown to 80% confluence, collected by
trypsinization after two washes with PBS (GenClone),
counted, and diluted at the desired density in 250 µL of
PBS for PEARL extraction. For ZIKV infections,
HeLa cells were grown to 60% confluency and then
infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 1. 48 hours post-infection, the cells were collected by
trypsinization after two washes with PBS (GenClone),
Cell culture

It is also possible that PEARL may introduce
extraction bias, as short RNAs, including tRNAs,
snoRNAs and miRNAs, are more difficult to
precipitate than longer RNA and DNA molecules22.
Though we have not directly tested whether small
RNAs are underrepresented in PEARL extracts, we
have designed PEARL to enhance the precipitation of
all RNAs by using linear polyacrylamide as a carrier23.
Additionally, longer and faster centrifugation speeds
can be used to enhance small RNA recovery, if
needed10. Further improvements may be required to
implement PEARL as mainstream nucleic acid and
protein isolation tool for detection of viruses obtained
from sources different than those described here, as the
sample type may dictate overall performance. Future
work outside the scope of this study will be required to
address whether this is the case.

membranes were incubated with primary antibodies
for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following primary
antibody incubation, the membranes were washed with
TBST 3 times before the addition of HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies. The membranes were incubated
for 30 minutes with secondary antibody diluted 1:3,000
in 0.5% BSA-TBST. Immunoreactivity was detected
using the Radiance Plus HRP Substrate (Azure

using automatic contrast. For dot-blot-based
immunodetection, nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad)
were spotted with 1 μL of PEARL extract and allowed
to dry completely at room temperature for 30 minutes.
For the remainder of the procedure, membranes were
processed and imaged as described for western blotting.

PEARL extracts were obtained from deidentified human samples or cultured cells. SARSCoV-2 positive human samples were heat-inactivated
by incubation at 56 °C for 30 minutes before RNA
extraction. RNA from these samples was obtained with
the QIAamp Mini Elute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen)
following the manufacturer’s protocol, using 200 μL of
sample input and eluting the purified RNA in 50 µL.
PEARL extracts were prepared using 250 µL of SARSCoV-2 positive human samples or a fixed number of
cultured infected cells suspended in 250 µL of PBS.
PEARL extracts from cultured cells were treated with
either DNase I (1 unit per every 8 µL of PEARL extract,
New England BioLabs) or with RNase A (0.1 mg per
every 8 µL of PEARL extract, ThermoFisher) in a final
volume of 10 µL for 30 minutes at 37 °C. 5 µL of
DNase-treated samples were reverse transcribed in a
final volume of 10 µL using the iScript cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer’s protocol and
diluted 5-fold in nuclease-free water before qPCR.
Target detection by qPCR was carried out with SYBR
Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using 2 µL of
diluted cDNA as template, and following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The entire 10 µL from
RNase-treated samples (genomic DNA) were diluted 5fold with nuclease-free water and 2 µL of diluted
genomic DNA were used as template for detection of
specific genes with the SYBR Select Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene
sequences and host RNase P mRNA from de-identified
SARS-CoV-2 positive samples was carried out with the

centrifugal force (RCF) was calculated as follows:
Hand-powered

RCF = 1.118 × 10-5 × rmax × (RPM)2

PEARL precipitation, the samples were spun at
maximum speed with the hand-powered centrifuge, or
at 19,000 × g in a benchtop centrifuge. RNA and
protein recovery for both centrifugation methods were
determined by RT-qPCR and dot blot.

Nuclease-treated PEARL extracts
were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad)
for western blot analysis. The membranes were blocked
in 0.5% BSA-TBST for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies
were diluted in 0.5% BSA-TBST as follows: anti-HSP70 (Cell Signaling Technology 4872) 1:1,000; antiLANA/ORF73 (Advanced Biotechnologies 13-210100) 1:3,000; anti-GFP (Invitrogen A11122) 1:3,000;
Immunodetection.
