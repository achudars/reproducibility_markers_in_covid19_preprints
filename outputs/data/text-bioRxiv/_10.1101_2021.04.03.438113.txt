Abstract
Prevailing COVID-19 vaccines are based on the spike protein of earlier SARS-CoV-2 strain that
emerged in Wuhan, China. The continuously evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2 resulting
emergence of new variants raises the risk of immune absconds. During the last few months,
several RBD (receptor-binding domain) variants have been reported to affect the vaccine
efficacy considerably. Soon after reporting of a new double mutant variant (L452R & E484Q) in
India, the country facing a deadlier second wave of infections which prompts researchers to
suspects this variant to be accountable. To address the relevant concerns about this new variant
affecting vaccine efficacy, we performed molecular simulation dynamics based structural
analysis of spike protein of double mutant (L452R & E484Q) along with K417G variants and
earlier reported RBD variants and found structural changes in RBD region after comparing with
the wild type. Comparison of the binding affinity of the double mutant and earlier reported RBD
variant for ACE2 (angiotensin 2 altered enzymes) receptor and CR3022 antibody with the wildtype strain revealed the lowest binding affinity of the double mutant for CR3022 among all other
variants. These findings suggest that the newly emerged double mutant could significantly
reduce the impact of the current vaccine which threatens the protective efficacy of current
vaccine therapy.

Introduction
COVID-19, a serious and continuously spreading pandemic affecting the world, creates severe
ailments and apparently everlasting health problems. Global coronavirus virus death increases
significantly. Possibilities of a wind up of this outbreak are developing adequate interventions.
While Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy has gained emergency use approval; a few vaccines
have exhibited potential & defensive effects upon COVID-19, mostly targeting the trimeric spike
glycoprotein, which is involved in host cell interaction and passage to cell entry as well as the
essential target for neutralizing antibodies. Essentially those were aimed against the earlier
SARS-CoV-2 strain that emerged in 2019 in Wuhan China (Korberet al., 2020; Chen et al.,
2020). Due to the perceived ease of transmission and expansive mutations in spike proteins, the
speedy evolution of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 is of high concern. A more contagious form of
the virus is spread across the country. According to recent reports by the BBC, Hindustan Times,
and Irish Times, several reports of feasible re-infection have been depicted in recent months.
Globally, deaths are rising again, on average around 12,000 per day, and new cases are also
increasing, excelling at 700,000 per day. In Brazil, where there are about 3,000 deaths per day, or
in recent weeks, a quarter of the world's lives were lost. Situation is equally grim in India, where
cases have risen in the weeks of February. The Asian nation has disclosed >14 million cases of
Covid and over 174,300 deaths so far. A new variant with two mutations - E484Q and L452R,
called B.1.617 initially reported in India was named "double mutant". This new variant is
believed to be creating the latest wave of infections in India, making it the second most affected
country in the world, surpassing Brazil. India was returning to a deadlier new wave of infections
after

reporting

a

double

mutation.

This new variant was found in >200 samples from Maharashtra only, which became the first hot
spot region during the second national wave that started in the last few months. By around 7
April, Maharashtra alone accounted for more than half of the new cases filed in the country,
convincing experts to doubt that the variant might be blamed. Approximately, more than half of
the districts in Maharashtra now have a large no. of cases than the high rate in September.
Nagpur, which has returned to lockdown, records 67 new cases over 100,000 people per day,
more than thrice the statewide rate. These cases are doubling every 10 days.
In India, over 180,000 new infections occurred in a 24-hour period in the previous week, taking

million.

For better management of this second wave, we need to re-evaluate the threshold efficacy of the
vaccine explore the functional aspects or potential efficacy of vaccine therapy currently
available, on the dual mutant variant and thereby look for strategic change/s for better efficacious
vaccine in future. It was noted that several mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), are
essential for the interaction of Human angiotensin 2 altered enzymes (ACE2) (Yan et al. 2020)
and antibodies, as well as region that neutralizes antibodies. It is therefore imperative to
understand up to what extent mutations interrelated with SARS-COV-2 affect the vaccination.
Taking these into account both vaccination as well natural infections, several reports deal with
the outcome of these variants on antibody ligation and function. The RBD can exist in two
conformities, alluded to as "up" and "down" i.e. receptor accessible and receptor in-accessible
(Wrapp et al. 2020). The in silico investigation revealed that ACE2 and potential antibodies
binds in a similar area on the spike protein (Hwang et al. 2006, Sui et al. 2004). An antibody
becomes very effective when it forestalling viral spread by impeding the ACE2 binding site in
the RBD. CR3022 antibody showed the most elevated binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein RBD (Hussain et al. 2020, Huoet al. 2020).
Based on the up to date literature survey, we retrieved 28 different spike protein variants and out
of these 28 variants, 12 variants belong to RBD region only. Here, we report RBD variants that
affect the ability of CR3022 and ACE2 to bind with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD through insilico
analysis.
Material and methods
Retrieval of crystal structures
Crystalstructuresof spike protein (PDBID-7AD1), ACE2 (PDBID-6ACG) and antibody
CR3022 (PDBID 6YLA) were retrieved from PDB RCSB (https://www.rcsb.org/). All water
molecules and hetro-atoms were removed by using Discovery studio visualization software
(BIOVIA

2020).

Homology modeling and Energy minimization
Based on high similarity, 7AD1 (crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2) was selected as template for
homology modeling of RBD mutant variants using the SWISS-MODEL (Lyskov and Gray
2008).Energy minimization and structural analysis of RBD mutant variants were done with
UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004). Evaluation of the modeled structure was done by PDBSum

(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-

bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=index.html ).
Docking analysis
Docking of RBD mutant variants with selected targets (ACE2 receptor and antibody
structure CR3022) was carried out by PatchDock server (Ranjan et al. 2020) by choosing
parameter RMSD esteem 4.0 and complex type as default. Docking investigation was based
on geometric shape complementarity score. Higher score indicates higher binding affinity.
Outcome of the results is based on the docking scores and interaction at the RBD regions.
Protein-protein and antibody-protein interactions were visualized by LigPlot plus v2.2 (Wallace
et al., 1995).
Molecular interactions of antibody CR3022 and ACE2 receptor with RBD variants were
performed byantibody script under antibody loop numbering scheme i.e. KABAT Scheme and
DIMPLOT script algorithm package built into LigPlot plus v2.2 respectively.
Molecular Dynamics Simulation
The equilibrium and the dynamic behavior of wild and mutant variants of RBD Spike protein
was studied by using GROMACS (Hess, et al., 2008).
MD simulation brings about time-dependent conformational changes and adjustment of protein,
which opens to the alteration in unique nature after establishment of mutation in protein. We
used GROMOS96 54a7 force field (Pandey, et al., 2020) for MD simulation study. We added
solvent water around protein to facilitate from spc216.gro as a non exclusive equilibrated 3-point
dissolvable water model in a dodecahedron. Here, we kept the protein in the centre in at least 1.0
nm from the case edges.

Further, steepest descent algorithm was utilized for energy minimization, to remove the steric
conflicts and unstable conformations. Further we equilibrate the system via NVT ensemble
(constant Number of particles, Volume and Temperature) and NPT ensemble (constant Number
of particles, Pressure and Temperature). After achieving equilibrium process, we moved for MD
run to 10ns. Data analysis was done by Gromacs tools i.e. gmx rms for RMSD (Root Mean
Square Deviation), gmx rmsf for RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation), gmx gyrate for radius
of gyration (Rg), gmx hbond for H-bond (for intra-protein H-bonds and for H-bonds between
protein and water), and gmx sasa for SASA (solvent accessible surface). We further used
GRACE software for data visualization.
Results
We have retrieved 28 variant mutants (Figure1) in spike protein from literature survey. We
found 12 variants/mutants in RBD region. RBD region is important for ACE2 and Antibody
interactions. We have done structural analysis of all 12 mutant variants and compared with wild
type and found seven mutant variants (F486L, Q493N, double mutant (L452R & E484Q), R408I,
L455Y, K417G and E484K) have structural changes in RBD region (Figure2). We analyzed
interactions between RBD variants and ACE2 receptor. Moreover, we checked the interactions
between antibody and RBD variants too. It was found that seven structurally changed variants
(F486L, Q493N, Indian double mutant (L452R & E484Q), R408I, L455Y, K417G and E484K)
have high docking score against ACE2 receptor compared with wild type and less docking score
against antibody (CR3022) unlike wild type (Table2). High docking score signifies high binding
affinity and low docking score signifies low binding affinity. Out of seven variants, double
mutants (Double mutant< Q493N<E484K<K486L<L455Y<R408I<K417G) have lowest binding
energy against antibody. Molecular interactions of antibody and ACE2 receptor with RBD
variants are depicted in supplementary file1. A few RBD variants already shown to affect the
vaccine efficacy as documented earlier by wet lab and dry lab results (Table1), however, the
vaccine efficacy against the double mutant and K417G variants is yet to be elucidated. Our in
silico study suggests that the double mutant and K417G variants may affect the vaccine efficacy.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To examine the dynamic behavior, MD simulation runs for 10 ns to contemplate the structural
stability of RBD mutant variants (F486L, Q493N, Indian double mutant (L452R & E484Q),
R408I, L455Y, K417G and E484K) as compared to wild type. Various parameters studied all
through the simulation trajectory, such as RMSD, Rg, RMSF, SASA, total number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds of protein and H-bond between protein and water with the time
dependent function of MD to examine the functional and structural impact of a mutant on wild
protein.
The RMSD and RMSF (Figure 3&4) of C-alpha chain atoms of all RBD mutant variants
showed significant fluctuations in stability as well as in flexibility in comparison to Wild one. Rg
and SASA analysis (Figure 5&6) depicted much fluctuation between mutant and wild type. The
fluctuations of hydrogen bonds are easily shown in all RBD mutant variants as compared to wild
type (total intra-molecular H-bond and H-bond between protein and water) (Table3). These
molecular simulation data showed hampered structural stability and complexity of all seven RBD
mutant variants as compared to wild type.
Discussion
Continuing emerging variant of SARS-Cov-2 resulting compromised vaccine induced immunity.
The 20I / 501Y.V1 variant of the lineage B.1.1.7, first discovered in the UK, has eight major
mutations in the spike genes that may affect vaccine efficiency, antibody therapy, and the threat
of re-infection. In addition to remaining susceptible to antibody neutralization, the B.1.1.7
variant does not seem to be a major burden for available vaccines (Shen et al., 2021; Muiket al.,
2021).
B.1.351, a variant first encountered in South Africa, is of greater concern that this variant is
incompliant to NTD mAbs neutralization, mainly due to E484K mutations. In addition, B.1.351
was more opposing to neutralization by convulsive plasma (9.4-fold) and vaccinated sera (10.3–
12.4-fold)

(Wang

et

al.,

2021).

The SARS-CoV-2 P.1, the Brazilian variant of B.1.1.28 lineage, has 10 mutations in spike gene
viz. D614G, T20N, D138Y, L18F, R190S, and P26S in the NTD and K417T, E484K and N501Y

in the RBD region and H655Y within furin cleavage site. It shares mutations similar to B.1.35.
P.1 on the same 3 RBD residues which are resistant to neutralization by the RBD targeted mAbs.
Shared E484K mutation is the main culprit, which emerged in more than 50 lines independently
along with B.1.526, recently identified in New York. A significant loss of neutralizing activity
has been shown by vaccinated serum and convalescent plasma towards P.1, but the decrease is
not as goodas compared to what was found against B.1.351., Accordingly,the risk of re-infection
by P.1 or dropped efficacy of vaccine protection may not be severe like B.1.351 (Wang et al.,
2021).
The mRNA-1273 vaccine’s neutralizing activity towards number of variants like B.1.351,
B.1.1.7 + E484K, B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.427 / B.1.429, D614G, 20A.EU2, 20E [EU1], N439KD614G, and previously identified mutant in Denmark mink cluster 5 were identified and found
to have the same neutrality level as Wuhan-Hu-1 (D1414) (Wu et al., 2021). Limited loss in
antibody neutralizing activity against B.1.1.7 while significant loss against B.1.35 was shown by
the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine, thus maintaining its efficacy towards B.1.1.7 and
demonstrating a major loss of efficacy against the benign version of B.1.151. Although the
efficacy against B.1.1.7 was found to have retained by the BNT162b2 Pfizer / BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine. The Novavax vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) reported differential protective
immunity in the clinical trials i.e 96%, 60%, and 86% against parental strain, B.1.351 and
B.1.1.7, respectively (Tarkeet al., 2021)."Double mutant" coronavirus variation with a
combination of changes not seen in any other places in the world than in India according to
Times of India and BBC news. Many SARS-CoV-2 variants have been detected in the last few
weeks of March in India. India is experiencing a sharp rise in coronavirus infections from
between

March

and

April

2021.

Based

on

worldometer

statistics

data

https://www.worldometers.info/, we observed sudden enhancement of total, active, daily new
cases, and death rate in the months of March and April indicates the beginning of second wave in
India (Figure 9). We do also observed the confirmed and active cases in all State/Union territory
(UT) of India with sudden rise from March to April 2021 according to covid19 India tracker
(http://www.covid19india.org ) (Figure10&11). Based on these studies, it can be hypothesized
that the double mutant variant may also one of the causes of the sudden increment of cases in all
state and UT of India. It might be possible that double mutant variant plays a major role in
speedy spreading of infections in India, which we tried to explore through in sillico analysis.

The RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, Intramolecular H-bond and H-bond between protein and water
molecules were plotted to analyze the stability as well as flexibility of structural hampered
mutant RBD variants. Comparison of wild protein with mutant protein, higher RMSD
fluctuations observed in all variants except Q493N, K408I. In case of Q493N and K408I less
fluctuation was noted. The RMSD output showed that the protein stability can be influenced. We
observed that the RMSF values are lower as compared to wild and it confirms the compressed
behavior of mutant trajectory. We noticed higher value of Rg in case of all mutants which
indicates that the compactness of protein can be lower. High fluctuations of SASA results
revealed that the protein structure and consequently protein function might be hampered. The
fluctuations of total intra-molecular H-bond and H-bond between protein and water showed in all
structural hampered RBD mutant variants which indicates the rigidity of protein may be
influenced (Hubbard et al., 2010).
Previous study has disclosed that the residues F486, L455, Q493, and N501 in the RBD spike
protein form a major binding domain for the human ACE2 receptor (Wan et al., 2020). A few
mutants’ viz.L455Y, Q493N, R408I, Q498Y, F486L, N501T within the RBD region (319-591),
and D936Y & A930V within HR1 site (912-984) have also been studied by in silico analysis to
investigate the basic structure of spike glycoprotein. After comparing MD simulations in mutants
and WT, a significant destabilizing outcome of mutations on the HR1 and RBD domains was
revealed. Researchers revealed compromised stability of the overall spike protein structures by
investigating the effect of framed mutations, before binding to the receptor (Ahamad et al.,
2020).
Conclusion
In this severe COVID-19 pandemic, in silico studies can be used to stimulate the proceeding of
development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of disease. In this study, we performed
molecular docking and simulation based screening of recently emerged double mutant variant
and previously reported RBD variant of COVID-19 to compare the binding and functional
stability of spike proteins. Results of the present study suggest that the new Indian strain double
mutant and K417G within the receptor-binding site could reduce the vaccine efficacy by
affecting the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the CR3022 antibody and ACE2 receptor. We have

examined the impact of double mutants and earlier reported RBD variants on the
spike glycoprotein’s structural stability by in silico analysis along with molecular simulation data
and found structural alteration in the RBD domain in seven mutant variants. Further molecular
interaction study of CR3022 antibody and ACE2 receptor with the RBD variants and comparison
with wild type strain revealed the reduced binding affinity of double mutant with antibody,
besides double mutant found to have the lowest affinity among all the RBD variants. These
findings infer the possibilities of antigenic drift, ensuing in compatibility of current vaccine for
double mutants’ Indian strain. This double mutant strain seems to be a major burden for the
available vaccine that could reduce the vaccine efficacy drastically and so may increase the
chances of re-infection. However, more research is still needed to explicate the exact
consequences of the double-mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2.
