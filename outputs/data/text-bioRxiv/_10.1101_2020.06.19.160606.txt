Abstract
Whole Genome Sequence of four samples from COVID-19 outbreaks was done in two
laboratories in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Veterinary Faculty Sarajevo and Alea
Genetic Center). All four BiH sequences cluster mainly with European ones (Italy,
Austria, France, Sweden, Cyprus, England). The constructed phylogenetic tree
indicates probable multiple independent introduction events. The success of future
containment measures concernig new introductions will be highly challenging for
country due to the significant proportion of BH population living abroad.
Background and objectives
The first case of a new viral respiratory disease (COVID-19) caused by a newly
discovered virus (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) on
March 5, 2020. In the period until 17th of June, a total of 3085 cases were laboratory
confirmed, of which 168 with fatal outcome [1]. On 17th of March 2020 BH declared
national emergency followed by introduction of very restrictive measures on
international movement, social distancing, mandatory use of personal protective
equipment and lockdown for the population under 18 and above 65 years. Despite
having 13 different health authorities and no state ministry of health due to complex
governmental structure, it is generally agreed that BH authorities successfully
implemented case detecting and tracing practices keeping epidemic scenario not to

overwhelm health care capacities. Cease of restrictive measures started mid-May
2020 and, regardless of the current new cases numbers increase in the first half of
June, authorities are keeping the plan to return to pre epidemic life conditions. BH
scientific community has a significant experience in, and previously established
capacity for, a wide specter of both human and animal virologic genetic analysis
[2,3,4,5]. As a result, several scientific teams were prepared to be involved in a joint
mission of genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in BH. Objectives of this research
were:
To share obtained sequences of the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 strains from
clinical samples of BiH patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and
To contribute to the understanding of the interaction of molecular and classical
epidemiology findings of COVID 19 in BH and the whole region and give
recommendations for the improvement of prevention and future measures.
Samples, RNA extraction and whole genome sequencing (WGS)
The samples used in this study were nasopharyngeal swabs in Viral Transport Medium
from four patients, originating from Tuzla, Sarajevo, Livno and Banja Luka, and RTPCR COVID-19 confirmed on 6, 8, 11, and 29 of April 2020, respectively (Figure 1.).
Figure 1. Sample locations in BH (Livno, Banja Luka, Tuzla, Sarajevo).

Figure 1. Description: samples were collected from four geographically representative
different regions in BH.
Samples from Livno and Banja Luka were processed at the laboratory of Veterinary
Faculty Sarajevo (VFS) and samples from Tuzla and Sarajevo at the Alea Genetic
Center, Sarajevo (AGC). A total of 140 μL of each sample was used for RNA extraction
by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), and the product of extraction was
later used for further analysis, while the rest of the samples were used for virus
isolation on various cell lines at the VFS (data not shown here). The presence of
SARS-CoV-2 in the samples was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using HKU protocol
[6], and the cycle threshold (Ct) values were 17,1; 21,3; 24,6 and 20,4 for Livno, Banja
Luka, Tuzla and Sarajevo samples, respectively.

Livno and Banja Luka samples
WGS was performed according to the ARTIC amplicon sequencing protocol for
MinION for nCoV-2019, which uses two primer pools to generate the sequence, as
described elsewhere [7]. The sequencing was performed on a MinION sequencer,
using an R9.4.1 flow cell on which the samples, as well as a negative control, were
pooled. MinKNOW software and the MinIT device were used for high accuracy realtime base-calling during the run, which lasted 17 hours. Only the base-called fastq
files with the Q score ≥ 7 were used for further analysis. The bioinformatic analysis
was performed according to the nCoV-2019 novel coronavirus bioinformatics protocol
[8]. The consensus sequence was mapped, for correction purposes, to the Wuhan
reference genome (MN908947) using Minimap2, and polished in Racon.
Tuzla and Sarajevo samples
WGS was performed according to Ion AmpliSeq™ SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel
Instructions for use on an Ion GeneStudio™ S5 Series System, as described
previously [9], with certain modifications. Sequencing was performed on Ion
GeneStudio™ S5 instrument using 520 chip. Raw data was analyzed using Torrent
Suite Software 5.12.0 where the sequences were aligned to the Ion AmpliSeq SARSCoV-2 reference genome. FASTA format of the obtained sequences was generated
by the Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler (IRMA) plugin. Sequences were
additionally reviewed using BioEdit software.
All sequences were deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/).
Phylogenetic analysis
To perform a phylogenetic analysis (PA) of sequences from Livno (GISAID Accession
ID: EPI_ISL_462753), Banja Luka (GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_462990), Tuzla
(GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_463893) and Sarajevo (GISAID Accession ID:
EPI_ISL_467300), a dataset of 120 whole genome sequences was obtained from
GISAID (Supplementary material). These sequences were chosen based on their
similarity with four BH sequences mentioned above. Namely, a set of 30 sequences
from other countries, displaying the highest sequence identity with each BH sequence,
were chosen. Sequence alignment and the construction of the phylogenetic tree were
performed in MEGA X [10].
Two main GISAID lineages [11] were highlighted with differently coloured brackets
and named accordingly: B.1.1. (GR) (yellow bracket) and B.1 (G) (blue bracket). Four
BH sequences were marked with a different marker (red square, circles and a triangle),
and bootstrap values were shown at the level of nodes. Livno sequence (GISAID
Accession ID: EPI_ISL_462753) is marked differently from other three BH sequences
because its GISAID subclade (B.1.1. (O)) is different than the subclade it has been
sorted in this phylogenetic tree (B.1.1. (GR)).
Position 614 in Spike protein, used to characterize the G clade [12], was shown to be
G in BH isolates, assigning all four BiH isolates to G clade together with European
sequences (Italy, Austria, France, Sweden, Cyprus, England). The constructed
phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 indicates probable multiple independent introduction
events as reflected by clustering of each single BiH sequence in a separate cluster,
highlighted with red (Livno, EPI_ISL_462753), green (Banja Luka, EPI_ISL_462990),
blue (Sarajevo, EPI_ISL_467300) and purple (Tuzla, EPI_ISL_463893).

sequences retrieved in this study, as well as sequences from different countries (n =
120 genome sequences).

Likelihood method, Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano substitution model as well as 1000
bootstrap replicates. Main clusters are highlighted in different colours. Certain
branches have been collapsed and labels have been deleted for the ease of browsing.
Discussion and conclusions
We sequenced the whole genome out of four samples from four different BH regions,
originated from Tuzla, Livno, Sarajevo and Banjaluka municipalities. Even though all
four BiH sequences cluster mainly with European ones, the constructed phylogenetic
tree indicates multiple independent introductions of COVID-19 in BiH. Those findings
correspond with other COVID-19 WGS studies [13,14] and confirm the importance of

travel-associated disease introduction events for BiH as well. The success of future
mitigation measures related to this type of disease introduction will be highly
challenging for BiH due to a significant proportion of BiH population living abroad.
WGS is a valuable approach for further investigation of the level of association of
various modes of international movement (touristic, economic, religious, family visits
etc) with transmission chains and associated risks.
Recently, significant increase in the number of new cases (more than 280 in just one
week and both international and community transmitted) emphasized a need to
establish a more efficient scientific and expert system for further work on the genetic
analysis of the SARS CoV-2 virus, and to continue investigation of the whole genetic
COVID-19 pattern as well. Integration of phylogenetic (molecular) and epidemiological
approaches in the assessment of human, animal and environmental data will help with
the identification of risk factors for disease spreading and optimize efficient and
rational use of preventive measures. The importance of results gained from such
approaches and studies will help in communication and scientific justification of social
distancing and movement restriction perception in public.
