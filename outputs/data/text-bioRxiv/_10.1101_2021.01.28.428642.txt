Abstract - This study aims to predict autoimmunity-related pathological mechanisms that
possess risk for individuals with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) serotypes and shared
by certain coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, based on homology to a SARS-CoV-2 peptide.
With the given aim, 1-) coronavirus-associated sequences, which are homologous to the 15mer
SARS-CoV-2 peptide CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC, are obtained. 2-) Human peptides that have at
least 7 residue matches with those coronavirus sequences, and the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, are
found. 3-) Epitope pairs, which are sourced by those aligned coronavirus and human sequences
are identified. 4-) Epitope pairs that are predicted to bind strongly not only to the same HLA
allele with each other but also to the same HLA allele as those of the respective alignment of the
SARS-CoV-2 peptide are selected. Following are the identified proteins or peptides (with HLAA*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02 epitopes), as described in 1-to-4: Immunoglobulin heavy chain
junction regions, CRB1 isoform I precursor, slit homolog 2 protein, hCG1995581, hCG2028737,
phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2. Among those, CRB1 isoform I precursor
sequence with the predicted HLA-A*24:02 epitope aligns with the highest number of different
sequences. Results imply autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients with HLA-A*02:01 and
HLA-A*24:02 serotypes, through molecular mimicry, as a shared pathogenicity risk that can be
prevalent upon getting infected with certain coronaviruses. These can pave way to improved risk
groups' assessment and autoimmunity treatment options, for COVID-19 and its associated
diseases. Also, the approach in this study can be used to predict prospective pathologies of the
transmissible variants in susceptible humans.

1. Introduction
Upon infection, presence of similar sequences to the pathogens' proteins in the human proteome
can be a potential risk of causing autoimmune response. This molecular mimicry is among the
preliminary conditions. Kerkar and Vergani [1] mentioned molecular mimicry, sequence
similarities of pathogenic organisms with autoantigens, as a possible mechanism of
autoimmunity, and is conceptually reinforced through the discoveries of de novo autoimmune
hepatitis associated with certain viral infections. In 90s, a sequence similarity search revealed 70
% overlap of a 10mer within the V3-loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 isolates,
with the collagen-like region of the human complement component C1q-A [2]. Follow-up
studies by the same group addressed the complications that would be caused by vaccines, which
are based on gp120 of HIV-1 [3]. Later, their findings on the presence of antibodies that are
reactive for the peptide in the V3-loop of HIV-1 in the healthy individuals [4], and the
complementarity of the antibodies for V3-loop of HIV-1 and IgG of human [5] were reported.
Presence of homologies between human proteins and virus proteins, and the examination of the
pathways of those homologous peptides, drew attention to the pathologies of viral infections that
are related to the immune response [6]. Even therapies targeting such complexifications were
suggested. In correlation with these, Kanduc and Shoenfeld [7] considered the intrinsic hazards
in the vaccines that are based on such pathogen sequences. The authors later extended their
earlier findings, and the theoretical implications of those [8,9]. Similarities among the SARSCoV-spike glycoprotein sequences and those of the human surfactant protein and the related
proteins were revealed by the authors, through a similar methodology [10]. Specifically, 13 of 24
shared pentapeptides were found to be present in 52 SARS-CoV-derived immunoreactive
epitopes. In addition, heptapeptide-sharing among pathogens, which are also containing SARSCoV-2, and the non-human primates, was observed and it revealed that high level of peptidesharing is somewhat unique to human [11]. The findings of their studies also led the authors to
suggest "aged mice" for testing of vaccines that are based on spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2
[12].

Relationship of COVID-19 and immunity is complex [13,14,15,16,17,18], it can involve
autoimmune reactions through molecular mimicry. Woodruff and co-workers [19] reported that
critically ill patients of COVID-19 "displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation as
previously described in autoimmune settings." Bastard and co-workers [20] reported
autoantibodies against type I IFNs in people with serious COVID-19 disease. Rodríguez and coworkers [21] reviewed autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions in COVID-19.
Accordingly, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune cytopenia, Guillain-Barré syndrome and
Kawasaki disease are known to be reported in COVID-19 patients [21]. A more recent review
[22] is present as well. Regarding molecular mimicry, Cappello and co-workers [23]
hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may be generating autoimmunity through molecular mimicry,
induced by stress. Rodríguez and co-workers [21] mentioned the molecular mimicry and
bystander activation as the mechanisms that can link COVID-19 to autoimmunity. In relation,
Lucchese and Flöel [24] reported three 6mers in the human brainstem respiratory pacemaker
proteins that are present in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The authors also reported molecular
mimicry with SARS-CoV-2 and heat shock proteins 90 and 60 of human, which are known to be
associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome and other autoimmune diseases [25]. Importantly, those
shared peptides are part of those epitopes that were experimentally shown to be immunoreactive.
Also, Kanduc and Shoenfeld [10] reported 5mers of human surfactant protein to be present in the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Angileri and co-workers [26] reported a 7mer of human Odorant
Receptor 7D4, a 6mer of human Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase Family Member 9, and a 7mer of
Solute Carrier Family 12 Member 6, which are present in the putative epitopes of SARS-CoV-2.
There are also human proteins that have strong immune cross-reactions with the spike protein
antibody of SARS-CoV-2 [27], which can be suggestive of molecular mimicry-based
autoimmunity in susceptible individuals [21]. In relation, we looked for autoimmunity related
pathological mechanisms that are common to certain coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by
means of a selected sequence (CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC), which is obtained through our ongoing
study [28] involving tblastx search of SARS-CoV-2 and plasmodium species that cause malaria
in human [29,30].

2. Materials and Methods
The CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC sequence was obtained by performing blastx [31] at NCBI [32],
between the reference genome of query input SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) and P. vivax
(taxid:5855) [28]. It was the aligned query sequence in the tblastx output that revealed the top
identity between the query and subject, which was afterwards utilized as input for NCBI blastp
search, by limiting the search to SARS-CoV-2 (taxid:2697049), to ensure that the sequence is
expressed [28]. Here, in this study, blast of the sequence is performed at Uniprot with threshold
10 (performed on 5 August 2020). The associated coronaviruses with homologous sequences are
selected from the results. Then, blastp of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and the coronavirus
sequences that are homologous, are performed separately, by limiting the searches to H. sapiens
(taxid:9606). The query-subject sequence pairs that have at least 7 residue matches are found in
those results. Within those results, the ones with the same names and sequence IDs as those in
the respective results of SARS-CoV-2 blastp search, are identified. This is followed by major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I binding predictions for those identified query-subject
sequence pairs. This is done to find the coronavirus and human sequences that are homologous,
and which are predicted to bind strongly to the same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as
that with the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. To do that, binding affinities to the MHC class I (MHC
class I genes are HLA-A, -B, and -C genes [33]) proteins are predicted with the use of a tool that
integrates NetMHC 4.0 [34,35], NetMHCpan 4.1 [36], and PickPocket 1.1 [37]. That tool is
NetMHCcons 1.1 [38]. Predictions are performed for 8-15mers, with default parameters, and by
performing the predictions for 12 MHC supertype representatives. The 12 MHC supertype
representatives are HLA-A*01:01 (A1), HLA-A*02:01 (A2), HLA-A*03:01 (A3), HLA-A*24:02
(A24), HLA-A*26:01 (A26), HLA-B*07:02 (B7), HLA-B*08:01 (B8), HLA-B*27:05 (B27),
HLA-B*39:01 (B39), HLA-B*40:01 (B44), HLA-B*58:01 (B58), HLA-B*15:01 (B62).
NetCTLpan 1.1 [39] is utilized as well, similarly, for the prediction of the epitopes of cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL), as 8-11mers. Within the prediction results, epitopes with at least 5 residue
matches and strong binding affinities to the same MHC supertype representative are considered
for possible risk of autoimmunity-related pathological mechanisms that are common to SARSCoV-2 and associated coronaviruses, based on similarity to the selected short SARS-CoV-2
sequence. Epitope-pairs with the highest number of residue-matches are displayed.

Summary information - Summary information about the identified proteins (or peptides in
case of immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions) is collected by searching the sequence ID
of the aligned subject sequence in the blastp results at Entrez (NCBI), and then searching the
encoding gene ID, which is indicated at the UniProt (www.uniprot.org) [40], to retrieve the
UniProtKB number. Information on the associated diseases is obtained from the human gene
database GeneCards (www.genecards.org) [41], wherever readily available.

3. Results
The query peptide with the sequence CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC in the single letter code
representation is originally obtained through tblastx search (see s2 file of [28]). Peptide with that
sequence is present in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (see s6 file of [28]), as part of non-structural
protein 6 (nsp6), which is cleaved from the replicase polyprotein 1a. Blast search of the sequence
is performed (on 5 August 2020) at Uniprot, with threshold 10 (S1, all Sfiles are deposited at
shorturl.at/rswS6). The associated coronaviruses are retrieved from that search. They are
presented in Table 1, along with their related sequences.

Blastp search results of the sequences that are displayed in the first column of Table 1 are
obtained by limiting the search to H. sapiens (S2-10). The query-subject sequence pairs in those
results, which have at least 7 residue matches, are found (S11, file displays the respective subject
sequences and the proteins containing them). Among those, the ones with the same protein name
and sequence IDs as those in the respective results of SARS-CoV-2 blastp, are identified (Table
2). The LGFMCTCYFGVF sequence displayed at Table 1 do not have any alignment with the
same protein name and sequence ID as those that are aligned with the SARS-CoV-2 sequence.
The GWFCTCYFGLY sequence displayed at Table 1 do not have any alignment with the same
protein name and sequence ID neither as those aligned with the SARS-CoV-2 sequence nor as the
other coronaviruses. Yet, we looked for at least 7 residue matches, indicating that the outcome
could be different with 6 residue matches, or so.

Table 2. Human proteins and their subject sequences, which are aligned with the coronavirus sequences
that are homologous with the 15mer SARS-CoV-2 sequence (query number 1, seq-1). Aligned subject
sequences that are shown in the second column contain at least 7 residues that are matching with the query
sequences, which are indicated by a designating-number in the first column. Descriptions of those
numbers are at the end of the table. Aligned sequences in the second column are displayed together with
the gaps that are introduced to the sequence for the alignment.

sequence ID is indicated here, but there can be different sequence IDs with the same alignment.

It is observed at Table 2 that there are 24 different alignments of 16 human protein sequences
with the coronavirus sequences. All the listed human proteins in Table 2 are aligning with seq-1,
which is a SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and with at least one other coronavirus sequence that is
homologous to seq-1. MHC supertype representative-binding predictions are performed for (both
the query and subject) sequences that are displayed at Table 2. Table 3 presents the MHC
supertype representative-binding predictions for the homologous coronavirus (query) and human
(subject) sequence pairs, which are predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles, not only
with each other, but also with those of the respective SARS-CoV-2 (query) and human (subject)
sequences. Immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions with sequence IDs MOR79299.1,
MOR77883.1, and MON20268.1; immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions with sequence
IDs ACT68971.1 and AAK13839.1; and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 isoform with
sequence ID EAW59359.1 are displayed in Table 2, but not in Table 3. The query-subject
sequence pairs with those protein sequences are not predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA
alleles. On the other hand, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region with the sequence ID
CEF94348.1 is also absent in Table 3 because the query-subject sequence pairs of those other
than that of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence are not predicted there, to be binding strongly to the same
HLA alleles.

Table 3. Human proteins and their (subject) sequences, which are aligned with the coronavirus (query)
sequences that are not only homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 15mer (seq-1) but also predicted to bind
strongly to the same HLA alleles as that of the SARS-CoV-2 (query) and human (subject) epitope-pairs.
These epitope-pairs are shown in consecutive rows and each epitope-pair have at least 5 matchingresidues. Residues in these epitope-pairs are written bold if they are among the matching-residues in the
original alignments. Those residues are further underlined if they are still present as matching-residues in
the predicted epitope-pairs. HLA allele is indicated in the first column. Accordingly, the same HLA
allele is displayed in case of the coronavirus (query) and human (subject) epitope-pairs. Epitopes
predicted by NetMHCcons are displayed here. Epitope-pairs that are sourced by the alignments of the
SARS-CoV-2 15mer (seq-1) are shown in the third column. In the second column, 1 indicates the SARSCoV-2 (query) sequence-number and it is written at the rows, which correspond to the same rows as the

of the proteins with the sequences in the second (bottom) lines of the query and subject epitope-pairs, which are shown

side by side, as seq-1 (on top) and its homologous human sequence (at the bottom), and the other coronavirus sequences that are
homologous to seq-1 (on top) and their homologous human sequences (at the bottom). The latter query and subject epitope-pairs
are shaded in grey, together with the number(s) designating the respective query sequences in the front.

The predictions displayed in Table 3 belong to NetMHCcons, but predictions are performed
with NetCTLpan as well. Its results were similar for those that have high affinity to the HLAA*24:02 allele, according to the NetMHCcons. Exceptions are the predictions for the alignments
of seq-2 (CFLGYCCCCYFGLFC) with the hCG1995581 (sequence ID EAW57092.1);
predictions for the alignments of both seq-1 and seq-2, with the slit homolog 2 protein (sequence
ID XP_011512212.2); and the alignments of seq-2 with one of the immunoglobulin heavy chain
junction regions (sequence ID MCG41834.1).

It is observed in Table 3 that the predicted epitope-pairs, which include peptides that are
sourced by two immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions (sequence IDs MOQ87140.1 and
MOP50498.1) and phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2 isoform (sequence ID
XP_024307423.1), are predicted to bind strongly to the HLA-A*02:01 (A2) allele. On the other
hand, those that include peptides sourced by the hCG1995581 (sequence ID EAW57092.1); two
other immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions (sequence IDs MON95290.1 and
MCG41834.1); hCG2028737 (sequence ID EAW73174.1); CRB1 isoform I precursor (sequence
ID AAL10681.1); and slit homolog 2 protein isoform (sequence ID XP_011512212.2), bind
strongly to the HLA-A*24:02 (A24) allele. Peptides of most of these proteins that overlap with
seq-1, the SARS-CoV-2 peptide’s sequence, overlap also with seq-2, the coronavirus peptide with
the sequence CFLGYCCCCYFGLFC. This is expected since seq-2 is closer in sequence to the
SARS-CoV-2 peptide (seq-1), compared to the others (Figure 1). Yet, the CRB1 isoform I
precursor is the protein with an antigenic peptide with similarity to the highest number of
different coronavirus sequences (seq-3 to -6), in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (seq-1)
(Table 3).

4. Discussion
Bianchi and co-workers [43] indicated earlier that studies involving peptide elution confirmed the
presentation of transmembrane helices by the MHC class I molecules. In accordance,
CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC is likely a transmembrane region, and is predicted to bind strongly to
certain HLA alleles, like its homologous sequences in the human proteome [44]. Here, the subset
of those that are common to the other coronaviruses is found (Table 3). Some associated diseases
of the proteins with the aligned peptides as potential epitopes are mentioned in the ‘summary
information’. In relation to this study, Lyons-Weiler [45] identified immunogenic epitopes in the
proteome of SARS-CoV-2. They compared those epitopes with the proteome of human. More
than 1/3 of the immunogenic peptides were found to be homologous to the proteins that are
significant in the adaptive immune system. Kanduc [46] suggested that there is an extensive
range of health disorders, related to probable autoimmune reactions against the peptides of the
human proteome that are homologous to the immunogenic peptides of SARS-CoV-2. It was
indicated in another study [47] that cerebrospinal fluids from the patients of COVID-19 were
suggestive of autoimmunity. In line with those, results presented here suggest molecular
mimicry-based autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients with HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*24:02
serotypes, as a shared risk to being exposed to certain coronaviruses. Immune responses to the
peptides and proteins with similar sequences and strong binding affinities to the same HLA allele
can lead to autoimmune reaction [48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. Yet, Trost and co-workers [51] pointed
at dramatically high number of shared heptapeptides (7mers) between bacterial and human
proteomes. In relation, Amela and co-workers [55] also demonstrated that most of the pathogen
proteins that can cause antibody generation by the host immune system are not homologous to the
human proteins, and vice versa. Distinguishing self from non-self was suggested to be
contributing this observation [56]. There need to be genetic, physiological, and environmental
[57] variations in action. Additional proofs, although some are challenging, and not free from
concerns, are required in addition to (peptide-)similarity. Autoimmune reactions were shown to
be developed in the animal models under such conditions (e.g. [58,59]).

Involvement of evolutionary processes [60] is a related concern, not only to these discussions
but also to this study and its results. Vaccine targets are already studied for COVID-19 [61], but
15

cross-reactivity risk in the adjuvant-vaccine for the individuals with genetic susceptibility should
also be considered [62], together with the discussed considerations in terms of the autoimmunity
risk, in general. Similar studies as this one, and as those mentioned here [7,8,9,10,11,12,45,46],
and relevant studies [63], all need to consider the possible variations in the genetic makeup as
well.

As stated in section 3, the results section, CRB1 isoform I precursor is the protein with an
antigenic peptide with similarity to the highest number of different coronavirus sequences (seq-3
to -6), in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (seq-1) (Table 3). Accordingly, the epitope
sourced by the CRB1 isoform I precursor is a strong candidate of a common autoimmune reaction
risk source, in case of individuals with the HLA-A*24:02 serotype, upon getting infected by
SARS-CoV-2 or the other coronaviruses. In support, CRB1 related coronavirus pathogenicity is
previously suggested [64,65]. It is suggested here further that possible CRB1 related coronavirus
pathogenicity is additionally fostered by autoimmunity risk in susceptible individuals. However,
seq-2, which is including SARS-CoV-1 among the source species, is not among those different
coronavirus sequences (seq-3 to -6). This result is obtained through homology to one SARSCoV-2 sequence (seq-1), which is limited. Yet, this result is in line with related studies. De
Maio and co-workers [64] pointed at the importance of Envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2,
which is significantly different from SARS-CoV, and bats and pangolin coronaviruses. E protein
was reviewed by Schoeman and Fielding [66], in terms of its possible relation with the
immunopathology of the disease. E protein binds with the tight-junction associated PALS1
protein, leading to redistribution to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and disruption of
tight junction, and epithelial barrier damage [66]. De Maio and co-workers [64] suggested that
the strengthened binding of E protein with PALS1, which is supported by their later studies [67],
can increase epithelial barrier weakening, inflammatory events, and tissue remodeling. The
latter, tissue remodeling, is also mentioned by Ziegler and co-workers, as de-differentiation [68].

CRB1 is natural ligand of PALS1 PDZ domain [67]. Autoimmune response to CRB1 through
molecular mimicry can reduce the availability of natural ligand CRB1 of PALS1 and destabilize

PALS1, or alter its function, in addition to the mechanisms that are discussed above. It can also
be mentioned regarding the possible autoimmune response related pathologies in susceptible
individuals with COVID-19 that CRB1 is among the top affiliated genes of many diseases that
are related to the rare disease Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration, as seen at MalaCards [69]. The
site (https://www.malacards.org/card/late_onset_retinal_degeneration?showAll=True) displays
through text searches within MalaCards or GeneCards Suite gene sharing. CRB1 is also among
the important genes related to retinis pigmentosa [70]. In relation, our findings suggest possible
autoimmune reaction development against CRB1 protein in susceptible individuals, upon getting
infected with SARS-Co-V-2 or MERS (BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013). Interestingly, this is not the
case for seq-2, which is including SARS-CoV-1 among the source species, while bat coronavirus
(HKU9) sequences (seq-3 to -5) have the same property. However, high affinity of those bat
coronavirus (HKU9) sequences (seq-3 to -5) to the same HLA allele as human CRB1 peptide is
not necessarily suggestive of a probable autoimmune reaction risk in susceptible animals. Yet,
this approach can be used to predict prospective pathologies of the transmissible variants in
susceptible humans.

As mentioned, it is observed here that the epitope sourced by the CRB1 isoform I precursor is
the candidate of a common coronavirus-sourced autoimmune reaction risk in the individuals with
the HLA-A*24:02 serotype, upon getting infected. Warren and Birol [71] also identified the
same HLA allele in predictions from the transcriptome sequences of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
of 4 among 5 patients from China, with COVID-19. Yet, different from here, the allele was
reported not to be (recognized as) a SARS-risk-factor. Findings of this work will be investigated
further in the follow-up studies.

5. Conclusion
We investigated autoimmunity related, shared pathological mechanisms of coronaviruses,
through a 15mer SARs-CoV-2 peptide with the sequence CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC. Accordingly,
coronavirus sequences homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide are initially obtained.
Afterwards, those homologous coronavirus sequences that are aligning with the human proteins

with at least 7 residue matches are attained. They were also expected to be common to the
similar alignments of the SARS-CoV-2 peptide with the human proteins. So, coronavirus (query)
and human (subject) epitope-pairs are identified. Those epitope-pairs were not only predicted to
bind strongly to the same HLA alleles with each other but were also predicted to bind strongly to
the same HLA alleles as the respective peptides of the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, and the human
protein(s) aligning with it. Immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions, phospholipid
phosphatase-related protein type 2, CRB1 isoform I precursor, and slit homolog 2 protein are
among the proteins with those predicted epitopes. They can be related to pathological conditions
in susceptible patients. Results suggest autoimmune reaction risk related to the CRB1 protein, in
individuals with the HLA-A*24:02 serotypes, upon getting infected with SARS-Co-V-2 or
MERS (BtVs-BetaCoV/SC2013). This is suggested also to be the case in bat coronavirus
(HKU9). High affinity of bat coronavirus (HKU9) sequences to the same HLA allele as human
CRB1 peptide is not necessarily suggestive of a probable autoimmune reaction risk in susceptible
animals. Yet, this approach can be used to predict prospective pathologies of the transmissible
variants in susceptible humans. Overall, the results here infer molecular mimicry-based
autoimmunity risk in individuals with HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*24:02 serotypes, in general,
upon getting infected with certain coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These findings can
pave the way to clinical studies for autoimmunity treatment options to be used in COVID-19 and
associated diseases; identification of individuals with specific HLA alleles as disease risk groups;
and consideration of genetic susceptibilities in vaccine studies; and can be further nourished by
the identification of novel alleles [72,73].
