ABSTRACT

27

Molecular-level understanding of human neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-

28

2 could accelerate vaccine design and facilitate drug discovery. We analyzed 294

29

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and found that IGHV3-53 is the most frequently used IGHV

30

gene for targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. We

31

determined crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies +/- Fab CR3022

32

ranging from 2.33 to 3.11 Å resolution. The germline-encoded residues of IGHV3-53

33

dominate binding to the ACE2 binding site epitope with no overlap with the CR3022

34

epitope. Moreover, IGHV3-53 is used in combination with a very short CDR H3 and

35

different light chains. Overall, IGHV3-53 represents a versatile public VH in neutralizing

36

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, where their specific germline features and minimal affinity

37

maturation provide important insights for vaccine design and assessing outcomes.

MAIN

39

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory

40

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is far from an end (1). The increasing global

41

health and socioeconomic damage require urgent development of an effective COVID-

42

19 vaccine. While multiple vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials (2), the

43

molecular features that contribute to an effective antibody response are not clear. Over

44

the past decade, the concept of a public antibody response (also known as multidonor

45

class antibodies) to specified microbial pathogens has emerged. A public antibody

46

response describes antibodies that have shared genetic elements and modes of

47

recognition, and can be observed in multiple individuals against a given antigen. Such

48

responses to microbial pathogens have been observed against influenza (3), dengue (4),

49

malaria (5), and HIV (6). Identification of public antibody responses and characterization

50

of the molecular interactions with cognate antigen can provide insight into the

51

fundamental understanding of the immune repertoire and its ability to quickly respond to

52

novel microbial pathogens, as well as facilitate rational vaccine design against these

53

pathogens (7, 8).

54
55

The spike (S) protein is the major surface antigen of SARS-CoV-2. The S protein utilizes

56

its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to engage the host receptor ACE2 for viral entry (9-

57

12). Therefore, RBD-targeting antibodies could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by blocking

58

ACE2 binding. A number of antibodies that target the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 have now

59

been discovered in very recent studies (13-28). We compiled a list of 294 SARS-CoV-2

60

RBD-targeting antibodies where information on IGHV gene usage is available (17-28)

61

(Table S2), and found that IGHV3-53 is the most frequently used IGHV gene among

62

such antibodies (Fig. 1A). Of 294 RBD-targeting antibodies, 10% are encoded by

63

IGHV3-53, as compared to only 0.5% to 2.6% in the repertoire of naïve healthy

64

individuals (29) with a mean of 1.8% (30). The prevalence of IGHV3-53 in the antibody

65

response in SARS-CoV-2 patients has also been recognized in some recent antibody

66

studies (20, 22, 27). These observations indicate that IGHV3-53 represents a frequent

67

and public antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

68
69

To understand the molecular features that endow IGHV3-53 with the ability to act as a

70

public antibody, we determined crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing

71

antibodies, namely CC12.1 and CC12.3, in complex with the SARS CoV-2 RBD and also

72

in the presence of the SARS-CoV1/2 cross-reactive Fab CR3022 (17). CC12.1 and

73

CC12.3 were previously isolated from a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient and shown to be

74

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific (27). Although CC12.1 and CC12.3 are both encoded by

75

IGHV3-53, CC12.1 utilizes IGHJ6, IGKV1-9, and IGKJ3, whereas CC12.3 utilizes IGHJ4,

76

IGKV3-20, and IGKJ1. This variation in IGHJ, IGKV, and IGKJ usage indicates that

77

CC12.1 and CC12.3 belong to different clonotypes, but are encoded by a common

78

IGHV3-53 germline gene. IgBlast analysis (31) shows that IGHV and IGKV of CC12.1

79

are only 1% somatically mutated at the nucleotide sequence level (two amino-acid

80

changes each). Similarly, the IGHV and IGKV of CC12.3 are also minimally somatically

81

mutated at 1.4% in both IGHV (four amino-acid changes) and IGKV (a single amino-acid

82

deletion). The binding affinities (Kd) of Fabs CC12.1 and CC12.3 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD

83

are 17 nM and 14 nM, respectively (Fig. S2). Moreover, competition experiments

84

suggest that CC12.1 and CC12.3 bind to a similar epitope, which overlaps with the

85

ACE2 binding site, but not the CR3022 epitope (Fig. S3).

90

site on SARS-CoV-2 RBD with an identical angle of approach (Fig. 1B-F). Interestingly,

91

another IGHV3-53 antibody B38, whose structure was determined recently (23), also

92

binds to the ACE2 binding site on SARS-CoV-2 RBD in a similar manner (Fig. S4).

93

Similar to the ACE2 binding site (11), the epitopes of these antibodies can only be

94

accessed when the RBD is in the “up” conformation (Fig. S5). Among 16 ACE2 binding

95

residues on RBD, 10 are within the epitopes of CC12.1 and B38, and 6 are in the

96

epitope of CC12.3 (Fig. 2A-D). Many of the epitope residues are not conserved between

97

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 2E), explaining their lack of cross-reactivity (27). The

98

buried surface area (BSA) from the heavy-chain interaction is quite similar in CC12.1

99

(723 Å2), CC12.3 (698 Å2), and B38 (713 Å2). In contrast, the light-chain interaction is

100

much smaller for CC12.3 (176 Å2) compared to CC12.1 (566 Å2) and B38 (495 Å2),

101

consistent with different light-chain gene usage. While both CC12.1 and B38 utilize

102

IGKV1-9, CC12.3 utilizes IGKV3-20. This observation suggests that IGHV3-53 can pair

103

with different light chains to target the ACE2 binding site of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

104

Given that CC12.3 (80% BSA from the heavy chain) binds the RBD with similar affinity to

105

CC12.1 (56% BSA from heavy chain) (Fig. S2), the light-chain identity seems not to be

106

as critical as the heavy chain. In fact, among the RBD-targeting IGHV3-53 antibodies,

107

nine different light chains are observed, although IGKV1-9 and IGKV3-20 are the most

108

frequently found to date (Fig. S6).

109
110

To understand why IGHV3-53 is elicited as a public antibody response, the molecular

111

interactions between the RBD and the heavy chains of CC12.1, CC12.3, and B38 were

112

analyzed. The complementarity-determining regions (CDR) H1 and H2 of these

113

antibodies interact extensively with the RBD mainly through specific hydrogen bonds

114

(Fig. 3A-B). Interestingly, all residues on CDR H1 and H2 that hydrogen bond with the

115

RBD are encoded by the germline IGHV3-53 (Fig. S1 and S7, Table S3). These

116

interactions are almost identical among CC12.1, CC12.3, and B38 with the only

117

difference at VH residue 58. A somatic mutation VH Y58F is present in both CC12.1 and

118

CC12.3, but not in B38 (Fig. 3A-C, boxed residues). Nevertheless, this somatic mutation

119

is unlikely to be essential for IGHV3-53 to engage the RBD, since VH residue 58 in B38

120

still interacts with the RBD through an additional hydrogen bond (Fig. 3C). Of note, none

121

of these antibody interactions mimic ACE2 binding (Fig. 3D).

122
123

Our structural analysis reveals two key motifs in the IGHV3-53 germline sequence that

124

are important for RBD binding, namely an NY motif at VH residues 32 and 33 in the CDR

125

H1, and an SGGS motif at VH residues 53 to 56 in the CDR H2 (Fig. S8). The side chain

126

of VH N32 in the NY motif forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of A475 on

127

the RBD, and this interaction is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds

128

with other antibody residues as well as a bound water molecule (Fig. 4A). VH N32 also

129

hydrogen bonds with VH R94, which in turn hydrogen bonds with N487 and Y489 on the

130

RBD (Fig. 4A). These interactions enhance not only RBD-Fab interaction, but also

131

stabilize CDR and framework residues and conformations. VH Y33 in the NY motif

132

inserts into a hydrophobic cage formed by RBD residues Y421, F456, L455 and the

133

aliphatic component of K417 (Fig. 4B). A hydrogen bond between VH Y33 and the

134

carbonyl oxygen of L455 on RBD further strengthens the interaction. The second key

135

motif SGGS in CDR H2 forms extensive hydrogen bond network with the RBD (Fig. 4C),

136

including four hydrogen bonds that involve the hydroxyl side chains of VH S53 and VH

137

S56, and four water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of VH G54, the

138

backbone amide of VH S56, and the side chain of VH S56. Along with VH Y52, the SGGS

139

motif takes part in a type I beta turn, with a positive Φ-angle for VH G55 at the end of the

140

turn. In addition, the Cα of VH G54 is only 4 Å away from the RBD, indicating that side

141

chains of other amino acids would clash with the RBD if they were present at this

142

position. As a result, the SGGS motif is a perfect fit for interacting with the RBD at this

143

location.

144
145

Overall, these observations demonstrate the importance of the NY and SGGS motifs,

146

which are both encoded in the IGHV3-53 germline, for engaging the RBD. In fact,

147

besides IGHV3-53, the only other IGHV gene that contains an NY motif in CDR H1 and

148

an SGGS motif in CDR H2 is IGHV3-66, which is a closely-related IGHV gene to IGHV3-

149

53 (32). As compared to IGHV3-53, IGHV3-66 has a lower occurrence frequency in the

150

repertoire of healthy individuals (0.3% to 1.7%) (29), which may explain why IGHV3-66

151

is less prevalent than IGHV3-53, but yet is still quite commonly observed (19-22, 24, 26)

152

in antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients (Fig. 1A). Overall, our structural analysis has

153

identified two germline-encoded binding motifs that enable IGHV3-53 to act as a public

154

antibody and target the SARS CoV-2 RBD with no mutations required from affinity

155

maturation.

156
157

While the binding mode of CDR H1 and H2 to RBD is highly similar among CC12.1,

158

CC12.3, and B38, CDR H3 interaction with the RBD is different (Fig. 3A-C) due to

159

differences in the CDR H3 sequences and conformations (Fig. 5A-B). For example,

160

while CDR H3 of CC12.1 can interact with RBD Y453 through a hydrogen bond, CDR

161

H3s of CC12.3 and B38 do not from such a hydrogen bond (Fig. 3A-C). Similarly, due to

162

the difference in light-chain gene usage, the light-chain interactions with the RBD can

163

vary substantially in IGHV3-53 antibodies (Fig. S9). Overall, our structural analysis

164

demonstrates that IGHV3-53 provides a highly versatile framework for antibodies to

165

target the ACE2 binding site in SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

166

167

An interesting feature of CC12.1 and CC12.3 is their relatively short CDR H3. While the

168

CDR H3 sequences of CC12.1 and CC12.3 are very different, both have a length of nine

169

amino acids (Kabat numbering), whereas the average CDR H3 length for human

170

antibodies is around 13 (33), as compared to for example very long CDR H3s (up to 30

171

residues) on average that seem to be required for many broadly neutralizing antibodies

172

to HIV-1 (34). Similarly, antibody B38 has a very short CDR H3 length of seven residues

173

(23). It is unlikely that longer CDR H3’s can be accommodated in these antibodies since

174

their epitopes are relatively flat with no large pocket to insert a protruding CDR (Fig. 2A-

175

C). This conclusion was also arrived in a recent study that also reported SARS-CoV-2

176

RBD-targeting antibodies that are encoded by either IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66 tend to

177

have a short CDR H3 (28). In fact, IGHV3-53 and IGHV3-66 antibodies in general have

178

slightly shorter than average CDR H3’s (by around one residue), but do appear to have

179

a few much shorter CDR H3’s (<10 amino acids) than average in the baseline antibody

180

repertoire (30). In CC12.1 and CC12.3, the space for CDR H3 to fit in the interface within

181

the RBD is limited (Fig. 5A-B), which thus constrains its length. Consistently, among

182

RBD-targeting antibodies currently reported (17-28), those encoded by IGHV3-53 have a

183

significantly shorter CDR H3 compared to those encoded by other IGHV genes (p-value

184

= 6e-8, Mann-Whitney U test) (Fig. 5C). These observations provide structural and

185

statistical evidence that a short CDR H3 length is a molecular feature of the IGHV3-53-

186

encoded public antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, reminiscent of a short 5-

187

residue CDR L3 in IGHV1-2 antibodies to the CD4 receptor binding site in gp120 of HIV-

188

1 Env (35).

189
190

Besides IGHV3-53, several other IGHV genes such as IGHV1-2, IGHV3-9, and IGHV3-

191

30 are also more frequently observed than other germlines in SARS-CoV-2 RBD-

192

targeting antibodies (Fig. 1A). The molecular mechanisms of these antibody responses

193

to SARS-CoV-2 will need to be characterized in the future. In addition, whether other

194

antibody germline gene segments, including the IGHD and the light chain, contribute to

195

public antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will also need to be further addressed.

196

Notwithstanding, the detailed characterization of this public antibody response to SARS

197

CoV-2 is already be a promising starting point for rational vaccine design (36), especially

198

given limited to no affinity maturation is required from the germline to achieve a high

199

affinity neutralizing antibody response to the RBD. In addition, IGHV3-53 exists at a

200

reasonable frequency in healthy individuals (29, 30), indicating that this public antibody

201

could be commonly elicited during vaccination (37), and aid in design of both antibody

202

and small molecule therapeutics (7, 38).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

369

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

370

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) (residues 319-541) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)

371

protein (GenBank: QHD43416.1) was cloned into a customized pFastBac vector (40),

372

and fused with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and C-terminal His6 tag (17). A

373

recombinant bacmid DNA was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life

374

Technologies). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid DNA into Sf9

375

cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and subsequently used to infect suspension

376

cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at an MOI of 5 to 10. Infected High Five

377

cells were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 110 r.p.m. for 72 h for protein expression.

378

The supernatant was then concentrated using a 10 kDa MW cutoff Centramate cassette

379

(Pall Corporation). The RBD protein was purified by Ni-NTA, followed by size exclusion

380

chromatography, and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl.

381
382

Expression and purification of Fabs

383

For CC12.1 and CC12.3, the heavy and light chains were cloned into phCMV3. The

384

plasmids were transiently co-transfected into ExpiCHO cells at a ratio of 2:1 (HC:LC)

385

using ExpiFectamine™ CHO Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the

386

manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was collected at 10 days post-transfection.

387

The Fabs were purified with a CaptureSelect™ CH1-XL Affinity Matrix (Thermo Fisher

388

Scientific) followed by size exclusion chromatography. CR3022 was expressed and

389

purified as described previously (17).

390
391

Expression and purification of ACE2

392

The N-terminal peptidase domain of human ACE2 (residues 19 to 615, GenBank:

393

BAB40370.1) was cloned into phCMV3 vector, and fused with a C-terminal Fc tag. The

394

plasmids were transiently transfected into Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine™ 293

395

Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The

396

supernatant was collected at 7 days post-transfection. Fc-tagged ACE2 protein was then

397

purified with a Protein A column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion

398

chromatography.

399
400

Crystallization and structural determination

401

CC12.1/RBD,

402

complexes were formed by mixing each of the protein components at an equimolar ratio

403

and incubated overnight at 4°C. Each complex was adjusted to 13 mg/ml and screened

404

for crystallization using the 384 conditions of the JCSG Core Suite (Qiagen) and ProPlex

405

screen (Molecular Dimensions) on either our custom-designed robotic CrystalMation

406

system (Rigaku) or an Oryx8 (Douglas Instruments) at Scripps Research. Crystallization

407

trials were set-up by the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops containing 0.1 μl of

408

protein and 0.1 μl of reservoir solution. Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained in the

409

following conditions:

CC12.3/RBD,

CC12.1/CR3022/RBD,

and

CC12.3/CR3022/RBD

Of note, these four complexes crystallized in a broad range of pHs. All crystals appeared

421

on day 3 and were harvested on day 7. Before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen for X-ray

422

diffraction studies, crystals were equilibrated in reservoir solution supplemented the

423

following cryoprotectants:

425

CC12.1/RBD complex: 20% glycerol

426

CC12.3/RBD complex: 20% glycerol

427

CC12.1/RBD/CR3022 complex: 10% ethylene glycol

428

CC12.3/RBD/CR3022 complex: none were required

429
430

Diffraction data were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at Stanford Synchrotron

431

Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) on the new Scripps/Stanford beamline 12-1 with a beam

432

wavelength of 0.97946 Å, and processed with HKL2000 (41). Structures were solved by

433

molecular replacement using PHASER (42) with PDB 6YLA (43), 4TSA, and 4ZD3 (44).

434

Iterative model building and refinement were carried out in COOT (45) and PHENIX (46),

435

respectively. Epitope and paratope residues, as well as their interactions, were identified

436

by

Biolayer interferometry binding assay

440

Antibody binding and competition assays were performed by biolayer interferometry

441

(BLI) using an Octet Red instrument (FortéBio) as described previously (47), with Ni-

442

NTA biosensors. There were five steps in the assay: 1) baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics

443

buffer; 2) loading: 180 s with 20 μg/mL of 6x His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins; 3)

444

baseline: 135 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 4) association: 240 s with serial diluted

445

concentrations of CC12.1 Fab or CC12.3 Fab; and 5) dissociation: 240 s with 1x kinetics

447
448

For competition assays, CC12.1 Fab, CC12.3 Fab, CR3022 Fab, and human ACE2-Fc

449

were all diluted to 250 nM. Ni-NTA biosensors were used. In brief, the assay has five

450

steps: 1) baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 2) loading: 120 s with 20 μg/mL, 6x His-

451

tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins; 3) baseline: 120 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 4) first

452

association: 180 s with CC12.1 Fab, CC12.3 Fab or CR3022 Fab; and 5) second

453

association: 180 s with CC12.1 Fab, CC12.3 Fab, CR3022 Fab, or human ACE2-Fc or

454

disassociation with 1x kinetics buffer for each first association.

Fig. S3. Competition assay between different Fabs and ACE2. Competition between

476

CC12.1, CC12.3, CR3022, and ACE2 was measured by biolayer interferometry (BLI). Y-

477

axis represents the response. The biosensor was first loaded with SARS-CoV-2 RBD,

478

followed by two binding events: 1) CC12.1, CC12.3, or CR3022, and 2) CC12.1,

479

CC12.3, or CR3022, ACE2, and buffer (negative control). A period of 180 s was used for

480

each of the binding events. A further increase in signal during the second binding event

481

(starting at 480 s time point) indicates lack of competition with the first ligand.

Fig. S5. Modelling the binding of CC12.1 and CC12.3 on the homotrimeric spike (S)

490

protein. The S trimer is shown with one RBD in the up conformation (cyan) and two

491

RBDs in the down conformation (pink). The CC12.1 and CC12.3 epitopes are shown in

492

yellow. (A) Model of the binding of CC12.1 (green) to the RBD up conformation. (B)

493

Model of the binding of CC12.3 (blue). PDB 6VSB is used in the modeling (48). The

494

complete epitopes of CC12.1 and CC12.3 are accessible only when the RBD is in the

495

up, but not the down, conformation.

interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the light chain in (A) CC12.1, (B) CC12.3,

518

and (C) B38 (PDB 7BZ5) (23) are shown. RBD is in white. Oxygen atoms are in red.

519

Nitrogen atoms are in blue. Hydrogen bonds are represented by dashed lines. The light

520

chains from both CC12.1 and B38 form an extensive hydrogen bond network with the

521

RBD, whereas the interaction between the light chain of CC12.3 and the RBD is

522

minimal. (D) The interaction between ACE2 and RBD residues (PDB 6M0J) (12) that are

523
