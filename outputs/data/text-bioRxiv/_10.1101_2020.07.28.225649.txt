Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a dramatic
global impact on public health, social, and economic infrastructures. Here, we assess
immunogenicity and anamnestic protective efficacy in rhesus macaques of the intradermal (ID)delivered SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine, INO-4800. INO-4800 is an ID-delivered DNA
vaccine currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell
responses and neutralizing antibody responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2
spike proteins. Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2
resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T and B cell responses. These
responses were associated with lower viral loads in the lung and with faster nasal clearance of
virus. These studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral and
cellular arms of the adaptive immune system which are likely important for providing durable
protection against COVID-19 disease.

Introduction
COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization.
There are >15.5 million confirmed cases worldwide with the total number of deaths estimated to
be >600,000 (July 24, 2020, gisaid.org). COVID-19 presents as a respiratory illness, with mildto-moderate symptoms in many cases (~80%) (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020). These
symptoms include headache, cough, fever, fatigue, difficulty breathing, and possible loss of taste
and smell. The factors involved with progression to severe COVID-19 disease in 20% of cases
are unclear; yet, severe disease is characterized by development of a hyperinflammatory response,
followed by development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), potentially leading to
mechanical ventilation, kidney failure, and death (Huang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). The rapid
development of vaccine countermeasures remains a high priority for this infection, with multiple
candidates having entered the clinic in record time (Thanh Le et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus belonging to the family
Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus, the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
SARS-CoV-2 is homologous to SARS-CoV, sharing around 70-80% of its genome (Lu et al.,
2020). Structural components of SARS-CoV-2 include the envelope (E) protein, membrane (M)
protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and surface spike (S) protein, which is a major immunogenic
target for humoral and cellular immune responses.
Virus entry into host cells is mediated through S protein receptor binding domain (RBD)
interaction with the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and priming by
the serine protease TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Recent preprints and published studies

also implicate S1 binding to neuropilin 1 (NLP-1) and have identified neutralizing epitopes outside
RBD (Chi et al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus outbreak this century. Prior work with the related
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, delineated that the Spike protein of these viruses was
an important target for development of neutralizing antibodies, and in animal viral challenges
vaccine targeted immunity (reviewed in (Du et al., 2009; Roper and Rehm, 2009; Thanh Le et al.,
2020) (Liu et al., 2018; Muthumani et al., 2015; van Doremalen et al., 2020a).
Recently studies have described initial data for vaccines developed from inactivated viruses
(Gao et al., 2020), recombinant adenoviral vectors that express the spike antigen (van Doremalen
et al., 2020b), or intramuscular (IM) delivered DNA vaccine candidates (Yu et al., 2020) in nonhuman primates (NHPs). These studies focused on disease protection in acute models with
challenge weeks after the final vaccination. Two in particular showed the ability of vaccination to
lower viral load in the lungs (Gao et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020b), and one reported
impact in the lungs and a trend to impact viral loads in the nose (Yu et al., 2020). While there are
significant questions arising regarding the length of protective immunity from SARS-CoV2
infection, as well as the long-term protection of vaccination, there have been no studies yet
reported of the ability of vaccine memory to impact challenge outcome. Here we report on the
impact of an ID-delivered SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine in a nonhuman primate model where the
animals were challenged 3 months post-vaccination.
Recent studies support an important role for both cellular and humoral immunity in
protection against COVID-19 disease. T cell-mediated immunity has been shown to be important
for other beta-coronaviruses, providing both direct protection and help in the generation of
effective humoral responses (Channappanavar et al., 2014b; Gretebeck and Subbarao, 2015).

Several SARS-CoV-2 studies have now reported that up to 40% of persons can exhibit mild disease
which may be associated with T cell immunity (Payne et al., 2020) or humoral responses (Robbiani
et al., 2020). This echoes older studies which found that neutralizing antibody levels and memory
B cell responses have not been sustained in SARS survivors, while responsive T cell populations
have proved more durable (Le Bert et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2006). Studies have
indicated the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies wane rapidly in convalescent subjects (Long et al.,
2020).
We recently described the immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine (INO-4800),
encoding a synthetic spike immunogen in small animal models (Smith et al., 2020). This vaccine
candidate induced neutralizing and ACE2-blocking antibodies, as well as T cell responses in mice
and guinea pigs. Here, we assess vaccine-induced memory T and B cell responses during the acute
expansion and memory phases in rhesus macaques, as well the ability of vaccine-induced memory
to impact infection in an NHP viral installation challenge following vaccination by the minimally
invasive (ID-EP) route. Additionally, we addressed the growing concerns regarding the emergence
of a dominant SARS-CoV2 variant G614, which now comprises more than 80% of circulating
global viral strains, and is reportedly associated with increased infectivity and spread (Korber B et
al., 2020). There have not yet been descriptions of vaccine induced responses driving immunity
against G614 variants. We report vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immunity, including
neutralizing antibody responses against both the SARS-CoV-2 D614 virus as well as the new G614
strain. Upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge more than 3 months following final-dose, vaccinated
macaques exhibited a rapid recall response against multiple regions of the S protein. This
anamnestic response was characterized by expansion of neutralizing antibody responses, including

those against the now dominantly circulating G614 variant, as well as the rapid expansion of T cell
responses. The immune responses induced by INO-4800 were associated with disease protection.

Results
Induction of memory humoral and cellular immune responses in INO-4800 immunized nonhuman primates
NHPs are a valuable model in the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics as they
can be infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and present with early infection that mimics aspects
of human disease (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Rhesus macaques
(n=5) received two immunizations of INO-4800 (1 mg), at Week 0 and Week 4 (Figure 1A).
Naïve control animals (n=5) did not receive vaccine. Humoral and cellular immune responses
were monitored for 15 weeks (~4 months) following prime immunization for memory responses.
All animals seroconverted following a single INO-4800 immunization, with serum IgG titers
detected against the full-length S1+S2 extracellular domain (ECD), S1, S2, and RBD regions of
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Figure 1B and C). Cross-reactive antibodies were also detected
against SARS-CoV S1 protein and RBD, but not MERS-CoV (Supplementary Figure 1). SARSCoV-2-reactive IgG against the ECD and RBD were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
washes at Week 8, 4-weeks following the 2nd immunization dose (Supplementary Figure 2).
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in the serum of
vaccinated animals at week 12 following immunization (Figure 1D). These memory titers were
comparable to those observed in other reported protection studies in macaques performed at the
acute phase of the vaccine-induced immune response (Gao et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al.,

2020b; Yu et al., 2020) and those reported in the sera of convalescent patients (Ni et al., 2020;
Robbiani et al., 2020). During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, a D614G SARS-CoV-2
spike variant has emerged that has potentially greater infectivity, and now accounts for >80% of
new isolates (Korber B et al., 2020). There is a concern that vaccines developed prior to this
variant’s appearance may not neutralize the D614G virus. There is also concern that persons
infected with earlier strains, may not have immunity against the G614 variant. Therefore, we
evaluated neutralization against this new variant using a modified pseudovirus developed to
express the G614 spike protein (Figure 1E). Similar neutralization ID50 titers were observed
against both D614 and G614 spikes, supporting induction of functional antibody responses by the
vaccine against both SARS-CoV-2 virus variants.
To investigate specific receptor-blocking neutralizing antibody activity, we assessed the
capacity to occlude ACE2 by vaccine-induced sera. We recently developed a receptor-blocking
assay and demonstrated that it correlates with pseudovirus neutralization titers (Walker et al.
accepted). In this assay, anti-spike antibodies are bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in an
ELISA plate followed by addition of a soluble version of the ACE2 receptor. Sera containing
antibodies which can obstruct the receptor binding site on the spike protein will have lower Area
Under the Curve (AUC) values in our assay. We observe that sera from 80% of immunized NHPs
had reduced AUC indicating the presence of antibodies that can block the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein from interacting with ACE2 (Figure 1F). An independent flow cytometry-based assay
was also performed to further study the Spike-ACE2 interaction. ACE2-expressing 293T cells
were co-incubated with Spike with or without the presence of sera. Spike binding to ACE2 was
detected by flow cytometry.

In this assay, 100% of macaques inhibited the Spike-ACE2

interaction, with 53-96% inhibition of the spike-ACE2 interaction at a 1:10 dilution and 24-53%
inhibition at a 1:30 dilution (Figure 1G).
INO-4800 immunization induced SARS-CoV-2 S antigen reactive T cell responses against
all 5 peptide pools with T cells responses peaking at Week 6, two weeks following the second
immunization (0-518 SFU/million cells, with 4/5 NHPs showing positive responses) (Figure 1H).
Distinct immunogenic epitope responses were detected against the RBD and S2 regions (Figure
1B and C). Interestingly, cross-reactive T cells responses were also detected against the SARSCoV spike protein (Supplementary Figure 3A). However, we did not observe cross-reactivity
to MERS-CoV spike peptides, which is consistent with the lower sequence homology between
SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV (Supplementary Figure 3B).

Vaccine induced immune recall responses upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge in non-human
primates
INO-4800 immunized macaques and unvaccinated controls were challenged with SARS-CoV-2
13 weeks (~3 months) post-final immunization (Study Week 17, Figure 2A). NHPs received a
challenge dose of 1.1x104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 Isolate USA-WA1/2020 by intranasal and
intratracheal inoculation as previously described (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020).
One day after viral challenge, 3/5 of INO-4800 vaccinated animals displayed an increase in
antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 full-length ECD. By day 7, all vaccinated animals had
an increase in antibody titers against the full length ECD, S1, RBD, and S2 proteins (Figure 2B).
Seven days post-challenge, robust geometric mean endpoint titers for the ECD ranging from
409,600 - 1,638,400 were observed in immunized animals, compared with the naïve group which
displayed seroconversion of only 1/5 animals (GMT 100) (Figure 2B). Antibody responses

continued to increase against SARS-CoV-2 proteins 14 days post-challenge. A significant increase
in pseudoneutralization titers (>20-fold increase) was observed in all INO-4800 immunized
animals against both D614 and G614 spike variants by day 7 post-challenge, compared to
unimmunized animals which only developed low neutralizing titers (Figure 2C).
Cellular responses were evaluated before and after challenge. At week 15, IFN-γ ELISpot
responses had contracted to memory but persisted (Figure 1H). Following challenge, T cell
responses increased for all animals in the vaccinated group (~218 SFU/million cells average)
supporting rapid recall expansion of immunological T cell memory (Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure 4).

Protective efficacy following SARS-CoV-2 challenge
At earlier time points post challenge, viral mRNA detection does not discriminate between input
challenge inoculum and active infection, while subgenomic (sgmRNA) levels are more likely
representative of active cellular SARS-CoV-2 virion replication (Wolfel et al., 2020; Yu et al.,
2020). As such, SARS-CoV-2 sgmRNA was measured in unvaccinated control and INO-4800
vaccinated macaques following challenge (Figure 4). Peak viral sgmRNA loads in the BAL were
significantly lower in the INO-4800 vaccinated group (Figure 4A and B), along with significantly
lower viral RNA loads at day 7 post-challenge (Figure 4C), indicating protection from lower
respiratory disease. While sgmRNA was detected in the nasal swabs of both the control and INO4800 vaccinated animals (Figure 4D-F), viral mRNA levels trended downwards in INO-4800
vaccinated animals by more than 2 logs (Figure 4F) and were achieved sooner on average.
Overall, the reduced viral loads following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection at 17 weeks after
immunization show an important durable impact mediated by the vaccine.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate global health creating a destabilizing
environment. Although therapies are progressing through multiple stages of development, the
need for preventative vaccine approaches for SARS-CoV-2 remains significant. Importantly,
multiple vaccines candidates are being advanced to the clinic as potential options for protection
against infection and or disease (reviewed in (Funk et al., 2020; Thanh Le et al., 2020)). Recently
acute challenge studies in NHPs receiving different experimental vaccines have been reported
(Gao et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020b; Yu et al., 2020). These studies describe reduction
in viral loads in the lower airways, and a trend to lower viral loads in the nose by an IM DNA
delivered full length spike Ag. However, protective efficacy at time points following contraction
of the acute phase immune response and establishment of immune memory have not been
previously studied. This is also true looking at prior NHP challenge in the MERS or SARS models
(Muthumani et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2008; van Doremalen et al., 2020a). Accordingly,
understanding the impact of vaccine-induced memory on challenge is of importance.
In the current study, we evaluated the durability of an ID-delivered full-length Spike
antigen vaccine (INO-4800) in rhesus macaques. The vaccine induced broad Spike binding
antibodies to multiple forms of the antigen, as well as rapid induction of potent neutralizing
antibodies, and cellular immune responses. Macaques additionally elicited cross-reactive humoral
and cellular responses to the SARS-CoV S protein. We further demonstrated protective efficacy
more than 3 months post-final immunization, observing establishment of anamnestic immune
responses and reduced viral loads upon challenge in vaccinated macaques. Recently, Yu et al.
evaluated a full length Spike Ag DNA vaccine candidate, administered by 2 x 5 mg IM doses, in
NHPs (Yu et al., 2020) followed by challenge at 3 weeks following the second immunization.

They observed decreases in BAL viral loads and a trend to lower nasal swab subgenomic viral
loads in some groups, including a group containing a full-length Spike Ag construct that shares
similarity to the construct studied here using a 2 x 1 mg dose by ID administration. In a recent
clinical study, we reported that ID delivery of an HIV vaccine prototype was dose-sparing and
demonstrated increased tolerability and improved immune potency compared to IM DNA delivery
(De Rosa et al., 2020). While limited conclusions can be drawn from such comparisons, more
study in this context is warranted.
In this study, we observed an impact on induction of durable immunity and protective
efficacy at a memory time point, 13 weeks post-final immunization. Importantly, reduced viral
subgenomic RNA loads in the lower lung were observed. A trend of lower viral mRNA loads was
also observed in the nose with more rapid clearance induced in the INO-4800 vaccinated animals.
These data support that immunization and memory immunity from such a vaccine in humans might
protect from severe disease in the lung as well as limit the duration of viral shedding in the nasal
cavity, thus possibly lowering viral transmission.
The initial viral loads detected in control unvaccinated animals in this study were
approximately 2 logs higher (109 PFU/swab in 4/5 NHPs on day 1 post-challenge) than in similar
published studies performed under identical conditions (~107 PFU/swab) (Yu et al., 2020). Two
of the prior reported NHP studies included intranasal delivery as an inoculation route for challenge
(van Doremalen et al., 2020b; Yu et al., 2020). High-dose challenge inoculums are frequently
employed to ensure take of infection, however such high dose challenge may artificially reduce
the impact of potentially protective vaccines and interventions (Durudas et al., 2011; Innis et al.,
2019). Despite these limitations, this study demonstrated significant reduction in peak BAL
sgmRNA and overall viral mRNA. Wolfel et al reported nasal titers in patients of an average 6.5

x 105 copies/swab days 1-5 following onset of symptoms (Wolfel et al., 2020). These titers are
significantly lower than our NHP challenge dose and support the potential for the vaccine to exhibit
great impact in the field against natural SARS-CoV-2 challenge.
T cell immunity has been shown to be an important mediator of protection against
betacoronaviruses, and recent studies have specifically identified a role in protection against
COVID-19 disease (Channappanavar et al., 2014a; Channappanavar et al., 2014b; Sekine et al.,
2020; Sun et al., 2020). Sekine et al reported SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in asymptomatic and
mild COVID-19 convalescent patients who were antibody seronegative (Sekine et al., 2020).
These results from convalescent patient studies collectively suggest that vaccine candidates which
could generate balanced humoral and cellular immune responses could be important in providing
protection against COVID-19 disease. Our study and other published reports show that DNA
vaccination with candidates targeting the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein likely increase
the availability of T cell immunodominant epitopes leading to a broader and more potent immune
response, compared to partial domains and truncated immunogens. In this study, we also observe
T cell cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-1. Further evaluation of these shared responses is likely of
interest and may inform development of vaccines targeting related betacoronaviruses. Long-lived
SARS-CoV specific T cells have been reported (Le Bert et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2006). Additional
studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients will provide important insight towards immunity and
long-term protection against COVID-19 disease.
In addition to T cells, we demonstrated that INO-4800 induced durable antibody responses
that rapidly increased following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. The vaccine induced robust neutralizing
antibody responses against both D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 variants. While the D/G 614 site
is outside the RBD, it has been suggested that this shift has the potential to impact vaccine-elicited

antibodies (Korber B et al., 2020) and possibly virus infectivity. Our data shows induction of
comparable neutralization titers between D614 and G614 variants and that these responses are
similarly recalled following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We additionally observe a positive
relationship between vaccine-induced antibody binding to the RBD and neutralizing antibody titers
(Supplementary Figure 5, R2=0.69).
Overall, the current challenge study provides a snapshot of anamnestic protective efficacy
several months post-vaccination with a small cohort of animals. The data support further study of
the SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine candidate INO-4800 which is currently in clinical trials. The
persistence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity following natural infection is unknown and recent studies
suggest natural immunity may be short lived (Long et al., 2020). Given that many people exhibit
asymptomatic or mild disease and recover without developing significant antibody responses,
additional study of vaccines that induce immunological memory for T and B cell responses is
clearly of interest. The immune responses and protection induced by simple ID delivery of INO4800 are promising and provide important information to advancing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
development.

Methods
DNA vaccine, INO-4800: The highly optimized DNA sequence encoding SARS-CoV-2 IgE-spike
was created using Inovio’s proprietary in silico Gene Optimization Algorithm to enhance
expression and immunogenicity (Smith et al., 2020). The optimized DNA sequence was
synthesized, digested with BamHI and XhoI, and cloned into the expression vector pGX0001
under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and a bovine growth
hormone polyadenylation signal.

Animals: All rhesus macaque experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Bioqual (Rockville, Maryland), an Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International accredited facility.

Blood

was collected for blood chemistry, PBMC isolation, and serological analysis. Bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) was collected on Week 8 to assay lung antibody levels and on Days 1, 2, 4, 7 post
challenge to assay lung viral loads.

Immunizations, sample collection and viral challenge. Ten Chinese rhesus macaques (ranging
from 4.55kg-5.55kg) were randomly assigned to be immunized (3 males and 2 females) or naïve
(2 males and 3 females). Immunized macaques received two 1 mg injections of SARS-CoV-2
DNA vaccine, INO-4800, at week 0 and 4 by the minimally invasive ID-EP administration using
the CELLECTRA 2000® Adaptive Constant Current Electroporation Device with a 3P array
(Inovio Pharmaceuticals). Animals were challenged with SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate
USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources NR-52281. The following reagent was deposited by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARSRelated Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, NR-52281. Blood was collected at indicated time
points to analyse blood chemistry and to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and
serum. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected at Week 8 and during challenge period to assay viral
load. BAL from naïve animals was run as control. At week 17, all animals were challenged with
1.2x108 VP (1.1x104 PFU) SARS-CoV-2. Virus was administered as 1 ml by the intranasal route
(0.5 ml in each nostril) and 1 ml by the intratracheal route. Nasal swabs were collected during the
challenge period using Copan flocked swabs and placed into 1 ml PBS.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation
Blood was collected from each macaque into sodium citrate cell preparation tubes (CPT, BD
Biosciences). The tubes were centrifuged to separate plasma and lymphocytes, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were transported by same-day shipment on cold-packs from
Bioqual to The Wistar Institute for PBMC isolation. PBMCs were washed and residual red blood
cells were removed using ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer. Cells were counted

using a ViCell counter (Beckman Coulter) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Corning),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).
Fresh cells were then plated for IFNγ ELISpot Assays and flow cytometry.

IFN-γ Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot). Monkey interferon gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot assay
was performed to detect cellular responses. Monkey IFN-γ ELISpotPro (alkaline phosphatase)
plates (Mabtech, Sweeden, Cat#3421M-2APW-10) were blocked for a minimum of 2 hours with
RPMI 1640 (Corning), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% pen/strep (R10). Following PBMC
isolation, 200 000 cells were added to each well in the presence of 1) peptide pools (15-mers with
9-mer overlaps) corresponding to the SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, or MERS-CoV spike proteins
(5 µg/mL/well final concentration), 2) R10 with DMSO (negative control), or 3) anti-CD3 positive
control (Mabtech, 1:1000 dilution). All samples were plated in triplicate. Plates were incubated
overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. After 18-20 hours, the plates were washed in PBS and spots were
developed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Spots were imaged using a CTL Immunospot
plate reader and antigen-specific responses were determined by subtracting the number of spots in
the R10+DMSO negative control well from the wells stimulated with peptide pools.

Antigen Binding ELISA. Serum and BAL was collected at each time point was evaluated for
binding titers.

Ninety-six well immunosorbent plates (NUNC) were coated with 1ug/mL

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2 ECD protein (Sino Biological 40589-V08B1), S1 protein (Sino
Biological 40591-V08H), S2 protein (Sino Biological 40590-V08B), or receptor-binding domain
(RBD) protein (Sino Biological 40595-V05H) in PBS overnight at 4°C. ELISA plates were also
coated with 1 µg/mL recombinant SARS-CoV S1 protein (Sino Biological 40150-V08B1) and

RBD protein (Sino Biological 40592-V08B) or MERS-CoV spike (Sino Biological 40069-V08B).
Plates were washed four times with PBS + 0.05% Tween20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 5% skim
milk in PBS-T (5% SM) for 90 minutes at 37°C. Sera or BAL from INO-4800 vaccinated and
control macaques were serially diluted in 5% SM, added to the washed ELISA plates, and then
incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. Following incubation, plates were washed 4 times with PBS-T and
an anti-monkey IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech 4700-5) 1 hour at
37°C. Plates were washed 4 times with PBS-T and one-step TMB solution (Sigma) was added to
the plates. The reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 2N sulfuric acid. Plates were read
at 450nm and 570nm within 30 minutes of development using a Biotek Synergy2 plate reader.

ACE2 Competition ELISA-Non-human primates
96-well half area plates (Corning) were coated at room temperature for 3 hours with 1 µg/mL
PolyRab anti-His antibody (ThermoFisher, PA1-983B), followed by overnight blocking with
blocking buffer containing 1x PBS, 5% SM, 1% FBS, and 0.2% Tween-20. The plates were then
incubated with 10 µg/mL of His6x-tagged SARS-CoV-2, S1+S2 ECD (Sinobiological, 40589V08B1) at room temperature for 1-2 hours. NHP sera (Day 0 or Week 6) was serially diluted 3fold with 1XPBS containing 1% FBS and 0.2% Tween and pre-mixed with huACE2-IgMu at
constant concentration of 0.4 µg/ml. The pre-mixture was then added to the plate and incubated
at room temperature for 1-2 hours. The plates were further incubated at room temperature for 1
hour with goat anti-mouse IgG H+L HRP (A90-116P, Bethyl Laboratories) at 1:20,000 dilution
followed by addition of one-step TMB ultra substrate (ThermoFisher) and then quenched with 1M
H2SO4. Absorbance at 450nm and 570nm were recorded with BioTEK plate reader.

Flow cytometry-based ACE2 receptor binding inhibition assay. HEK-293T cells stably
expressing ACE2-GFP were generated using retroviral transduction. Following transduction, the
cells were flow sorted based on GFP expression to isolate GFP positive cells. Single cell cloning
was done on these cells to generate cell lines with equivalent expression of ACE2-GFP. To detect
inhibition of spike binding to ACE2, 2.5 µg/ml S1+S2 ECD-his tagged (Sino Biological, Catalog
#40589-V08B1) was incubated with serum collected from vaccinated animals at indicated time
points and dilutions on ice for 60 min. This mixture was then transferred to 150,000 293T-ACE2GFP cells and incubated on ice for 90 min. Following this, the cells were washed 2x with PBS
followed by staining for surelight® APC conjugated anti-his antibody (Abcam, ab72579) for 30
min on ice. As a positive control, spike protein was pre-incubated with recombinant human ACE2
before transferring to 293T-ACE2-GFP cells. Data was acquired using a BD LSRII and analyzed
by FlowJo (version 10).

Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was produced using HEK293T cells transfected with GeneJammer
(Agilent) using IgE-SARS-CoV-2 spike plasmid (Genscript) and pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- plasmid (NIH
AIDS reagent) at a 1:1 ratio. Forty-eight hours post transfection, supernatant was collected,
enriched with FBS to 12% final volume, steri-filtered (Millipore Sigma), and aliquoted for storage
at -80°C. SARS-Cov-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay was set up using D10 media (DMEM
supplemented with 10%FBS and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin) in a 96 well format. CHO cells
stably expressing ACE2 were used as target cells (Creative Biolabs, Catalog No. VCeL-Wyb019).
SARS-Cov-2 pseudovirus were titered to yield greater than 20 times the cells only control relative
luminescence units (RLU) after 72h of infection. 10,000 CHO-ACE2 cells/well were plated in 9619

well plates in 100ul D10 media and rested overnight at 37˚C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours. The
following day, sera from INO-4800 vaccinated and control groups were heat inactivated and
serially diluted. Sera were incubated with a fixed amount of SARS-Cov-2 pseudovirus for 90
minutes at RT. The sera+virus mix was then added to the plated CHO-ACE2 cells and allowed to
incubate in a standard incubator (37% humidity, 5% CO2) for 72h. Cells were then lysed using
Britelite plus luminescence reporter gene assay system (Perkin Elmer Catalog no. 6066769) and
RLU were measured using the Biotek plate reader. Neutralization titers (ID50) were calculated
using GraphPad Prism 8 and defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which RLU were reduced
by 50% compared to RLU in virus control wells after subtraction of background RLU in cell
control wells.

Viral RNA assay: RT-PCR assays were utilized to monitor viral loads, essentially as previously
described (Abnink P et al 2019 Science). Briefly, RNA was extracted using a QIAcube HT
(Qiagen,Germany) and the Cador pathogen HT kit from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
supernatant and nasal swabs. RNA was reverse transcribed using superscript VILO (Invitrogen)
and ran in duplicate using the QuantStudio 6 and 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s specifications. Viral loads were calculated of viral RNA
copies per mL or per swab and the assay sensitivity was 50 copies. The target for amplification
was the SARS-CoV2 N (nucleocapsid) gene. The primers and probes for the targets were:
2019-nCoV_N1-F :5’-GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT-3’
2019-nCoV_N1-R: 5’-TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG-3’
2019-nCoV_N1-P: 5’-FAM-ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ1-3’

Subgenomic mRNA assay: SARS-CoV-2 E gene subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) was assessed by
RT-PCR using an approach similar to previously described (Wolfel R et al. Nature 2020). To
generate a standard curve, the SARS-CoV-2 E gene sgmRNA was cloned into a pcDNA3.1
expression plasmid; this insert was transcribed using an AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield Message
Maker Kit (Cellscript) to obtain RNA for standards. Prior to RT-PCR, samples collected from
challenged animals or standards were reverse-transcribed using Superscript III VILO (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A Taqman custom gene expression assay
(ThermoFisher Scientific) was designed using the sequences targeting the E gene sgmRNA (18).
Reactions were carried out on a QuantStudio 6 and 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Standard curves were used to
calculate sgmRNA in copies per ml or per swab; the quantitative assay sensitivity was 50 copies
per ml or per swab.

Figure 1. Humoral and cellular immune responses in rhesus macaques. (A) The study outline
showing the vaccination regimen and sample collection timepoints. (B) Schematic of SARS-CoV2 spike protein. (C) SARS-CoV-2 S1+S2 ECD, S1, RBD and S2 protein antigen binding of IgG in
serially diluted NHP sera collected. Data represents the mean endpoint titers for each individual
NHP. (D&E) Pseudoneutralization assay using NHP sera, showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2
specific neutralizing antibodies against the D614 (D) and G614 (E) variants of SARS-CoV-2.
(F&G) Serum collected at Week 6 from INO-4800 vaccinated NHPs inhibited ACE2 binding to
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. A plate-based ACE2 competition assay (F) and a flow-based ACE2
competition assay (G) showing inhibition of ACE2 binding by NHP sera. (H) T cell responses
were measured by IFN-γ ELISpot in PBMCs stimulated for 20h with overlapping peptide pools
spanning the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Bars represent the mean + SD.
