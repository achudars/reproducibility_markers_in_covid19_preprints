Abstract

2

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity within infected hosts can provide insight into the

3

generation and spread of new viral variants and may enable high resolution inference of

4

transmission chains. However, little is known about temporal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost

5

diversity and the extent to which shared diversity reflects convergent evolution as opposed to

6

transmission linkage. Here we use high depth of coverage sequencing to identify within-host

7

genetic variants in 325 specimens from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and infected employees

8

at a single medical center. We validated our variant calling by sequencing defined RNA mixtures

9

and identified a viral load threshold that minimizes false positives. By leveraging clinical

10

metadata, we found that intrahost diversity is low and does not vary by time from symptom

11

onset. This suggests that variants will only rarely rise to appreciable frequency prior to

12

transmission. Although there was generally little shared variation across the sequenced cohort,

13

we identified intrahost variants shared across individuals who were unlikely to be related by

14

transmission. These variants did not precede a rise in frequency in global consensus genomes,

15

suggesting that intrahost variants may have limited utility for predicting future lineages. These

16

results provide important context for sequence-based inference in SARS-CoV-2 evolution and

17

epidemiology.

Introduction

22

Over the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, whole genome sequencing has been widely

23

used to characterize patterns of broad geographic spread, transmission in local clusters, and

24

the spread of specific viral variants1–6. Early reports demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits

25

genetic diversity within infected hosts, but this has been less studied than consensus-level

26

genomic diversity7. Intrahost diversity is an important complement to consensus sequencing.

27

Patterns of viral intrahost diversity throughout individual infections can suggest the relative

28

importance of natural selection and stochastic genetic drift8. Shared intrahost variants between

29

individuals can reveal loci under convergent evolution and enable measurement of the

30

transmission bottleneck, a critical determining factor in the spread of new genetic variants9,10.

31

Studies of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity may shed light on selective pressures applied at the

32

individual level, such as antivirals and antibody-based therapeutics. While a clear understanding

33

of within-host evolution can inform how SARS-CoV-2 spreads on broader scales, there have

34

been relatively few comprehensive studies of intrahost dynamics9,11,12.

35
36

Sequencing of intrahost populations can also potentially be applied to genomic epidemiology13.

37

A common goal in sequencing specimens from case clusters is to infer transmission linkage,

38

which can guide future public health and infection control interventions. However, the relatively

39

low substitution rate and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 present challenges to inference of

40

individual transmission pairs13,14. In the pandemic setting, there is a non-negligible chance that

41

two individuals who are epidemiologically unrelated could be infected with nearly identical viral

42

genomes. Viruses from a single local outbreak may have few differentiating substitutions,

43

limiting the ability of sequencing to resolve exact transmission chains. Identification of shared

44

intrahost variants between individuals has been explored in other pathogens to overcome this

45

obstacle15–19. However, use of this approach for SARS-CoV-2 will depend on a solid

46

understanding of the forces that shape the generation and spread of genetic variants.

47
48

There are several unresolved questions that will dictate the utility of intrahost diversity for

49

genomic epidemiology. First, there must be sufficient intrahost diversity generated during acute

50

infection prior to a transmission event. How much intrahost diversity is accumulated over time

51

from infection onset is currently unknown. Second, the population bottleneck during

52

transmission must be sufficiently wide to allow minor variants to be transmitted to recipient

53

hosts20,21. Third, de novo generation of the same minor variants across multiple infections must

54

be sufficiently rare. Independent generation of shared minor variants by positive selection or

55

genetic drift in unrelated hosts could confound transmission inference15. Finally, measurements

56

of intrahost diversity must be accurate and account for several potential sources of error22,23.

57

Although previous studies have described within-host variation of SARS-CoV-27,9,11,12,24–26, few

58

have addressed the sources of systematic errors and batch effects in variant identification. To

59

assess the utility of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity for transmission inference, we need a

60

clearer understanding of its temporal variation throughout infection and the extent of convergent

61

evolution across individuals. Addressing these questions will also be valuable for understanding

62

SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

63
64

Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 325 residual upper respiratory samples from

65

hospitalized patients and employees at the University of Michigan. To validate our sequencing

66

approach, we sequenced defined mixtures of two synthetic RNA controls and found that low

67

input viral load decreases the specificity of variant calling. We find that observed intrahost

68

diversity does not vary significantly by day since symptom onset. Intrahost variants can be

69

shared between individuals that are unlikely to be related by transmission, suggesting that

70

variants can arise by parallel evolution. These results inform our understanding of SARS-CoV-2

71

diversification in human hosts and highlight important considerations for sequence-based

72

inference in the virus’s genomic epidemiology.

Results

75

We retrieved respiratory specimens collected through diagnostic testing from March – May

76

2020. We sequenced samples from two groups: inpatients who were part of an observational

77

study of COVID-19 in hospitalized individuals (n = 190), and symptomatic employees who

78

presented to occupational health services (n = 135). All employees were diagnosed and treated

79

in outpatient settings, except for one who was admitted as an inpatient. Genome copy number

80

determined by qPCR of the nucleocapsid gene was highly variable and decreased by day from

81

symptom onset (p < 0.001, linear model, Fig. 1A). We obtained 212 complete genomes (Fig.

82

1B), mostly from samples with higher viral loads (Fig. 1B). Consensus genomes had a median

83

of 7 substitutions relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 reference sequence (range 4 – 12).

84

Phylogenetic analysis of whole consensus genomes identified 10 unique evolutionary lineages

85

in our cohort (lineages determined by the PANGOLIN system, see Methods; Fig. 1C). Most

86

sequenced genomes fell in lineage B.1. We evaluated whether any employees were part of an

87

epidemiologically linked cluster based on illness onset date, positive test status, and work

88

location. We found that some employees were part of epidemiologically linked clusters (Fig.

89

1C). The genomes from clusters 2, 10, 19, 20, and one pair in cluster 29 had ≤ 1 consensus

90

difference, while the rest had 2 – 7 differences. Many inter-cluster employee pairs also had

91

identical or nearly identical consensus genomes. We have no information on epidemiologic

92

linkage for the remaining sequenced individuals.

93
94

Identification of viral within-host variants can be prone to errors22,23. Therefore, we performed a

95

mixing study to evaluate the accuracy of our pipeline for identifying intrahost single nucleotide

96

variants (iSNV). We mixed two synthetic RNA controls that differ by seven single nucleotide

97

substitutions at defined frequencies and input concentrations (Fig. 2A). These mixtures were

98

sequenced using the same approach as the clinical samples. We identified true iSNV at the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.427330; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

99

expected frequencies at ≥ 103 copies/μL (Fig. 2B). There was greater variance in the observed

100

variant frequencies at 102 copies/μL compared to higher input concentrations. We obtained high

101

sensitivity for iSNV at ≥ 2% frequency and ≥ 103 copies/μL with sufficient genome coverage.

102

Many false positive iSNV remained at ≥ 2% frequency and 102 copies/μL despite multiple quality

103

filters (Figure 2C, Supplemental Figure 1). However, false positive iSNV per sample drastically

104

decreased with input concentrations ≥ 103 copies/μL. Three false positive variants were

105

identified in multiple samples above 104 copies/μL: A3350U, G6669A, and U13248A. Because

106

these iSNV were not randomly dispersed across the genome and were otherwise well-

107

supported in the sequence data, we suspect that they represent low-frequency variants present

108

in the synthetic RNA controls. Together, these data indicate that sufficient input viral load is a

109

critical factor for accurate identification of iSNV.

110
111

Based on our benchmarking experiment, we identified iSNV in 178 specimens with viral loads

112

≥103 copies/μL (Fig. 3A). We excluded position 11083, which is near a natural poly-U site and

113

prone to sequencing errors27. Most specimens exhibited fewer than ten minor iSNV (median 1,

114

IQR 0 – 3, Fig. 3B). There were four outlier specimens with greater than 15 iSNV. In these

115

samples, iSNV were dispersed throughout the genome at various frequencies, so it is difficult to

116

determine whether they represent mixed infections11. The locations of these samples on

117

sequencing plates were not suggestive of cross-contamination. There was no difference in

118

minor iSNV richness between hospitalized patients and employees treated as outpatients (p =

119

0.29, Mann-Whitney U test, Supplemental Figure 2). We identified more minor iSNV encoding

120

non-synonymous changes than synonymous ones across most open reading frames (Fig. 3C)

121

and identified more iSNV at lower frequencies (Fig. 3D), which together is suggestive of mild

122

within-host purifying selection. Sample iSNV richness decreased with higher viral loads by about

123

1 iSNV per 10-fold increase in viral load (p = 0.01, multiple linear model, Supplemental Figure

124

3). Sample iSNV richness did not correlate with day from symptom onset (p = 0.75, multiple

125

linear model, Fig. 3E). These results show that within-host diversity is low and remains that way

126

over the duration of most SARS-CoV-2 infections.

127
128

Next, we investigated patterns of shared intrahost diversity between individuals. Most iSNV

129

were unique to a single individual. However, 19 iSNV were present in multiple specimens (Fig.

130

4A). These did not include the three recurrent false positives found in the synthetic RNA

131

controls. None of these mutations were located at sites known to commonly produce errors or

132

homoplasies27,28. Two iSNV were present in three individuals (G12331A and A11782G, both

133

synonymous changes in ORF1a) and one iSNV was present in six individuals (U13914G,

134

encoding N149K in ORF1b). There was no clear phylogenetic clustering of genomes exhibiting

135

these shared iSNV (Supplementary Figure 4). The U13914G mutation was shared between

136

several sample pairs separated by 2 or more substitutions, and G12331A was shared between

137

samples from different viral lineages (13 substitutions). These three mutations were first

138

detected in our samples in late March 2020 (Fig. 4B). None reached > 1% frequency per week

139

in consensus sequences submitted to GISAID through mid-November 2020. These results

140

suggest that iSNV that arise convergently across viral lineages are not necessarily predictive of

141

subsequent global spread of those mutations.

142
143

Transmission inference based on shared iSNV integrates information such as consensus

144

genome sequences, sample dates, and shared iSNV15. Therefore, we compared shared iSNV

145

across all unique pairs of specimens used for variant calling (n = 15753, Fig. 5). Because most

146

iSNV were unique to an individual, most pairs did not share iSNV and only 0.23% of pairs

147

shared one iSNV. Many pairs with shared iSNV were sequenced in separate batches, which

148

reduces the likelihood that shared iSNV are due to cross-contamination. No employee pairs in

149

the same epidemiologic cluster shared iSNV (see Fig. 1C). We identified fourteen unique pairs

150

with shared iSNV between genomes that were near-identical (0 – 1 consensus differences),

151

eight of which were collected within one week of each other. However, we have no

152

epidemiologic data to suggest that these pairs of individuals are linked by transmission. We also

153

identified shared iSNV between 23 pairs separated by ≥ 2 consensus substitutions (Fig. 5A and

154

5B) and 15 pairs with collection dates 7 – 28 days apart (Fig. 5B). Due to differences in viral

155

lineage and time of collection, these are very unlikely to be transmission pairs. Together, these

156

data indicate that iSNV can arise convergently between individuals who are unlikely to be

157

related by transmission.

159

Discussion

160

Accurate characterization of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity is important for understanding the

161

spread of new genetic variants and its potential use in transmission inference. In this study, we

162

sequenced upper respiratory specimens from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and

163

infected employees. We found that intrahost diversity is low and its distribution does not vary by

164

time since symptom onset. We identified iSNV shared across viral genomes separated by time

165

and disparate evolutionary lineages, indicating that iSNV can arise convergently. Because

166

variants may be shared through parallel mutation rather than transmission, caution is warranted

167

in the use of shared iSNV alone for inferring transmission chains. Intrahost variants shared

168

across multiple individuals did not precede an increase in frequency in global consensus

169

genomes, which suggests that identifying convergent iSNV may have limited utility in tracking

170

broader SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

171
172

Specimen viral load is important when measuring intrahost diversity. We and others have shown

173

that samples with low viral loads are prone to false positive iSNV and lower sensitivity22,23,29. A

174

strength of our study is that we experimentally validated the accuracy of our variant calling by

175

sequencing defined populations. Based on these results, we excluded samples with low viral

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.427330; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

176

load from subsequent analyses. Future studies of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity should report

177

and account for specimen viral loads to avoid this common source of error. We did not

178

benchmark our sequencing approach for detecting insertions and deletions (indels) and

179

therefore did not report these for the clinical specimens. Intrahost indels could conceivably

180

provide useful information about within-host evolution, but accurate detection is also subject to

181

similar issues of sample quality and viral load.

182
183

The low level of intrahost diversity that we found here is consistent with a recent preprint by

184

Lythgoe et al.9. The fact that our work and the study by Lythgoe et al. were performed with

185

different geographical areas, sequencing approaches (ARTIC Network amplicons vs. veSEQ

186

metagenomic sequencing), and analysis methods lends credence to the results. Lythgoe et al.

187

reported more shared variation than seen here, but this is most likely due to sequencing a

188

greater number of samples among individuals within known epidemiologic clusters. We and

189

Lythgoe et al. measure a lower level of intrahost diversity at the 2% frequency threshold

190

compared to a recent study in Austria12. The reasons for this are not clear, but it is likely due to

191

differences in sample viral loads and variant calling methods. We did not find a difference in

192

intrahost diversity between hospitalized COVID-19 patients and those treated as outpatients,

193

which suggests that viral diversity may not be a reliable marker for disease severity.

194
195

Measuring viral diversity over the course of infection is relevant for understanding how variants

196

are transmitted to new hosts. Only genetic variants present at the time of a transmission event

197

will have the opportunity to spread. Because SARS-CoV-2 usually transmits just before or

198

several days after symptom onset30,31, it is important to define viral diversity in this window. Our

199

cross-sectional analysis of diversity by time since symptom onset indicates that diversity does

200

not significantly increase over the course of infection. A significant fraction of samples may not

201

exhibit any iSNV at the time of transmission, which could limit the utility of iSNV for linking

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.427330; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

202

transmission pairs. Only a large bottleneck would lead to onward spread of most iSNV present

203

during early infection. However, it is important to recognize that although the absolute level of

204

diversity may not change over time, different variants may arise or go extinct during a given

205

infection. This phenomenon was observed in a recent study by Tonkin-Hill et al.11. Serial

206

samples from individuals could address this issue with higher resolution. Low diversity within

207

hosts also shapes our expectations for emergence of resistance to drugs and monoclonal

208

antibodies. With such limited substrate for selection to act upon, the short window of time

209

between treatment and transmission could limit the spread of a variant selected within a host.

210

Even during prolonged infections in immunocompromised hosts, there is only limited evidence

211

of resistance to various COVID-19 therapeutics32–34.

212
213

Parallel evolution is a critical factor to consider in the interpretation of shared intrahost

214

variation15. Even if iSNV identification were perfectly specific, iSNV can arise in parallel due to

215

biological processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. A key finding of this work is that

216

iSNV can arise in genomes that are unrelated by local transmission, specifically those across

217

large time intervals and lineages. Shared iSNV between individuals with identical genomes

218

collected the same week may also have arisen in parallel. These pairs are most likely not

219

epidemiologically linked, but we are unable to rule out coincident local transmission in the

220

community. Because iSNV can arise in parallel in genomes that are not linked by transmission,

221

caution is needed when relying entirely on shared iSNV for transmission inference11,13.

222
223

We also found that identifying iSNV across multiple individuals did not precede an increase of

224

those mutations in frequency in global consensus genomes. It is unclear whether these

225

mutations arose due to positive selection, chance, or mutational “hotspots”11. It is possible that

226

these mutations were lost due to purifying selection within hosts or during transmission8,35.

227

These results suggest that iSNV may have lower utility for tracking broader SARS-CoV-2

228

evolution, but larger sample sizes in more geographic areas are necessary to evaluate this.

229
230

One of the most important variables for transmission inferences is the size of the transmission

231

bottleneck15. If parallel evolution of iSNV occurs regularly and the transmission bottleneck is

232

very small, that would increase the likelihood that shared iSNV are due to convergence rather

233

than transmission. However, if the bottleneck is large, then iSNV may become more valuable for

234

detecting transmission networks when consensus genomes are limited. There are currently

235

conflicting results on the SARS-CoV-2 bottleneck size. Popa et al. estimated a bottleneck size

236

of greater than 100012. In contrast, Lythgoe et al. estimated a bottleneck size range from 1 – 8

237

based on 14 household pairs9. Lythgoe et al. in particular used extensive controls and validation

238

for preventing contamination and identifying sequencing errors. Other studies both in humans

239

and in domestic cats have estimated small bottlenecks36,37. It is difficult to interpret these

240

contrasting results because each study used different sequencing and analysis methodologies.

241

In recent work on influenza A virus, a study of methodological differences was key for resolving

242

different conclusions about the bottleneck size38. One factor that has not yet been clearly

243

defined is how the time interval between donor-recipient pairs affects SARS-CoV-2 bottleneck

244

estimates. We expect that further work will clarify the reasons behind these conflicting

245

estimates.

246
247

Because of the high incidence and low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, genomic epidemiology is

248

necessarily constrained in its ability to determine exact transmission chains in an outbreak.

249

Using minor genetic variation to increase the resolution of genomic epidemiology requires

250

attention to the underlying processes of within-host viral evolution and awareness of possible

251

confounders. Unified statistical frameworks that incorporate sequences, metadata, and

252

epidemiological models are likely the most robust approaches for integrating intrahost variants,

253

but these models also must account for parallel evolution15–17. As others have recently

254

suggested11, we caution against assigning transmission pairs solely by virtue of shared iSNV in

255

the absence of clear epidemiologic information.

Genome amplification and sequencing

281

Residual samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum specimens were centrifuged at 1200

282

x g. and 200 microliters were aliquoted. RNA was extracted with the Invitrogen PureLink Pro 96

283

Viral RNA/DNA Purification Kit and eluted in volumes of 100 microliters. Complementary DNA

284

was reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV (ThermoFisher). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was

285

amplified in two multiplex PCR reactions using the ARTIC Network V3 primer sets. Sequencing

286

libraries were prepared with the NEBNext Ultra II kit and pooled in equal volumes after

287

barcoding. The pooled sequencing library was gel extracted to remove adapter dimers. Libraries

288

were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq at the University of Michigan Microbiome Core facility (v2

289

chemistry, 2x250 cycles). To validate this approach, we used two synthetic RNA controls that

290

differ by seven single nucleotide mutations, Wuhan-Hu-1 and EPI_ISL_418227 (Twist

291

Bioscience, San Francisco, CA). We mixed the two RNAs at various copy numbers (105, 104,

292

103, 102 genome copies/μL) and frequencies (0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 100%).

293

We amplified and sequenced each RNA mixture as described above.

294
295

Viral load measurements

296

We measured SARS-CoV-2 genome copy concentration for each sample by qPCR using

297

conditions outlined in the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus EUA protocol

298

(https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download). The nucleocapsid gene was amplified using the

299

CDC N1 primer and probe set as follows: 2019-nCoV_N1 Forward Primer

300

GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT; 2019-nCoV_N1 Reverse Primer

301

TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG; 2019-nCoV_N1 Probe

302

ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC. Probe sequences were FAM labeled with Iowa Black

303

quencher (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Reactions were performed using

304

TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) with 500 nM of each primer

305

and 250 nM of each probe in a total reaction volume of 20 µl. Cycling conditions were as

306

follows: 2 min at 25 °C, 15 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 95 °C, and 45 cycles of 3 seconds at 95 °C, 30

307

seconds at 55 °C. Samples were run on an Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST real-time PCR

308

system. Cycle threshold (Ct) was designated uniformly across PCR runs.

309

Standard curves based on serial dilutions of a plasmid containing the nucleocapsid sequence

310

were used to determine copy number for each plate of samples. Copy number is expressed in

311

genome copies per microliter of extracted viral RNA.

312
313

Analysis of sequence reads

314

We aligned reads to the MN908947.3 reference genome with BWA-MEM version 0.7.1539. We

315

removed sequencing adaptors and trimmed ARTIC primer sequences with iVar 1.2.123. We

316

determined the consensus sequences with iVar 1.2.1, taking the most common base as the

317

consensus (>50% frequency). We placed an N at positions along the MN908947.3 reference

318

with fewer than 10 reads. We manually inspected insertions and deletions by visualizing

319

alignments with IGV (version 2.8.0)40. We identified single nucleotide variants with iVar 1.2.1

320

using the following parameters: sample with viral load ≥ 103 copies/μL; sample with consensus

321

genome length of ≥ 29000; sample with ≥ 80% of genome sites above 200x coverage; iSNV

322

frequency threshold of 2%; read depth of ≥ 100 at iSNV sites; ≥ 10 reads with average Phred

323

score of > 35 supporting a given iSNV; iVar p-value of < 0.0001. All samples on which we called

324

variants had > 50,000 mapped reads. We accounted for strand bias by performing a two-sided

325

Fisher's exact test for hypothesis that the forward/reverse strand counts supporting the variant

326

base are derived from the same distribution as the consensus base. We then applied a

327

Bonferroni multiple test correction and excluded variants with an adjusted p-value < 0.05. To

328

generate a phylogenetic tree, we aligned consensus genomes with MUSCLE 3.8.31 and

329

masked positions that are known to commonly exhibit homoplasies or sequencing errors41. We

Figure 2. Assessing accuracy of intrahost variant detection by sequencing defined viral mixtures. (A)
Schematic of the experiment. Wuhan-Hu-1 (reference) and EPI_ISL_418227 (variant) RNA were
mixed at the given frequencies and viral loads (units of genome copies per microliter). Mixtures of
RNA were amplified and sequenced in the same fashion as the clinical specimens. Reference and
variant genomes differ by seven single nucleotide substitutions. (B) Observed frequency by expected
frequency. Observed frequency of the true positive intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNV) is on
the y-axis and expected iSNV frequency is on the x-axis. Viral loads are shown above each facet, in
units of genome copies per microliter of RNA. Values above the points indicate the number of
variants detected in that group (maximum of seven per group). (C) False positive iSNV. Number of
false positive iSNV per sample is shown on the y-axis (base 10 log scale) and viral load as shown in
(B) is on the x-axis. Each point represents a unique sample and the boxplots represent the median
and 25th and 75th percentiles, with whiskers extending to the most extreme point within the range of
the median ± 1.5 times the interquartile range.

variant (iSNV) diversity. (A) Sequencing coverage
for clinical samples. The number of clinical samples
(y-axis) is shown by the fraction of the genome
above a given read depth threshold (x-axis). The
different lines show the data evaluated with six
read depth thresholds. (B) Histogram of the
number of specimens (y-axis) by the number of
minor iSNV per sample (x-axis), n = 178. (C)
Number of minor iSNV by frequency with a bin
width of 0.05. Non-synonymous iSNV are shown in
orange and synonymous iSNV are shown in violet.
(D) Number of minor iSNV by coding region. Nonsynonymous iSNV are shown in orange and
synonymous iSNV are shown in violet. (E)
Scatterplot of the number of minor iSNV per
sample (y-axis) by the day post symptom onset (xaxis). Hospitalized patients are shown in teal and
employees shown in violet. The four samples with
> 15 iSNV shown in (B) are excluded from the plot
for visualization.
