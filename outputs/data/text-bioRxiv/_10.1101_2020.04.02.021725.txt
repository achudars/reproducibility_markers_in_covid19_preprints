Abstract
The recent outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 has generated a chaos in global health and economy and
claimed/infected a large number of lives. Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain
has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due
to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host
machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a
suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time.
Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a
comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We
verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs
(MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and
screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and
antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratopic binding (Vaxigen
v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic
regions and selected their energetic, IC50, MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very
good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed
profound effects on epitopic recognition. The present work might be helpful for the urgent
development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2.

Introduction
An outbreak of a novel Coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (or
SARS CoV-2 or COVID-19) infection is threatening the humanity, globally occurring from last
week of December 2019. As a result, a massive loss of human health status and global economy
are becoming unaccountable. As of current situation, SARS CoV-2 claimed more than 40,000
lives from more than 800,000 infected persons globally [1]. The outbreak started from the
Wuhan province of China and spread more than 195 countries with most adverse effects in
China, Italy, Iran, Spain, the United States, France, Germany, Britain and several other countries.
Any type of therapeutic strategies starting from the blocking of viral entry, inhibition of spike
proteins association with host ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme type 2), modulations of
interfering kinase activity, inactivation of viral genome expression-packaging and vaccination
against this virus is the demand of the present situation. Regarding the vaccination strategies, it is
assumed that frequent mutation results in anomalies in its surface/ spike proteins [2,3]. Mostly
resembling the features of SARS CoV global outbreak (2003, https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/) ,
this virus unlikely manifested it’s extremely high grade of virulence, spreading capability and
stability across the geographical barrier (or specifically colder place, aged persons or specific
genders; yet to be clarified) [4].
The positive selective pressure could account for the stability and some clinical features
of this virus compared with SARS and Bat SARS-like CoV [5]. Stabilizing mutation falling in
the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID-2019
high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a
potential mechanism differentiating COVID-2019 from SARS CoV [5]. Nevertheless, nutritional
and immunological statuses are also important factors for the screening of the therapeutic

strategies for the affected and sensitive persons. Possible medications or immunizations from the
existing drugs or infusion of convalescent plasma should be conducted with utmost care to the
COVID 19 patients [6]. Advanced precautionary steps and therapeutic interventions should be
formulated taking into account of several personal and community factors [7]. Development of a
successful and reproducible vaccination protocol and its human trial may take longer time for the
issues of mutation and large number glycan shield and epitope masking on the SARS CoV 2
proteins [8].
In a series of medication regimen, 1 (AT1R) blockers is used for reducing the severity
and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections [9]. Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine are
now being prescribed somewhere to fight COVID-19 for the time being [10,11]. Human
coronaviruses and other influenza viruses resulted in epidemic in last 2 decade in different parts
of the world. The anomalies between severity and spreading between the origin site, China and
the other parts of the World (European and North America countries) might have some
indication. Common human CoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the
US, and individual human CoVs may show variable circulation from year to year. [12]
Colder climate and prior exposure to other human coronaviruses, or influenza or flu
viruses or possible vaccination against those might develop antibody dependent enhancement
(ADE) of immunological responses during recent SARS CoV-2 exposure. ADE might have
modulated immune response and could elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or
cytokine storm [13,14]. Possibly, that could be one of the reasons (more history of exposure with
CoVs beside weaker immune system) for older people being more affected by the present SARS
CoV-2. Moreover, both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were
below normal levels. The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T

lymphocytes [15]. Strong inflammatory events could be the initiator of the collapsing
environment during COVID-19 infection. In most of the death cases in COVID-19 infections,
acute respiratory failure is followed by other organs like kidney anomalies. In these cases
inflammatory outburst might have worsened the infection and post viral-incubation situations
[16,17]. Recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for
virus-induced immunopathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after human CoV
infections [18]. So, combined anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatment might be beneficial in
these cases [19]. SARS-based available immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities
revealed poor efficacy to neutralize and protect from infection by targeting the novel spike
protein. [20].
In this background, critical screening of the spike sequence and structure from SARS
CoV-2 by energetic and IC50 based immunoinfrmatics analysis may help to develop a suitable
vaccine. So, in the current study we were intended to analyze the spike proteins of SARS CoV,
MERS CoV and SARS CoV 2 and four other earlier out-breaking human corona virus strains.
We critically compared SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 spike-proteins, domains, motifs and
screened several epitopes based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity employing several
bio/immuuno –informatics software with regard to their possible glycosylation and
MHC/paratopic binding effects. The present work might be helpful for the urgent development
of a suitable vaccination regimen.

Structure Prediction and Structure Quality Assessment
Tertiary structures of selected coronavirus (CoV) spike proteins were predicted/ validated
using Phyre2, Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine V 2.0 [22] and SWISS-MODEL
[23]. In Phyre2 structures were predicted against 100,000 experimentally designed protein folds.
Predicted structures were subjected to analysis in SWISS-MODEL for QMEAN Z-score
calculation which includes cumulative Z-score of Cβ, All atoms, Solvation and Torsion values
prediction. RAMPAGE: Ramachandran Plot Analysis server [24] was used for protein 3D
structures quality assessment. The summation of number of residues in favored regions and in
additionally allowed regions was considered for percent (%) quality assessment.
Protein Structural Alignment
Predicted tertiary structures were visualized and aligned using PyMol molecular
visualization system. Pymol assigns the secondary structure using a secondary structure
alignment algorithm called “dss”, where the sequences of two structures were aligned first then
the structures were aligned. For the visualization of molecules a high-speed ray-tracer molecular
graphics system was used.

Secondary structural analysis and their 3D folding patterns were analyzed in the form of
topology using ProFunc; a protein function predicting server using protein 3D structures [25]. In
protein classification, topology analysis plays an independent and effective alternative to
traditional structural prediction. Topological differences between two structures indicated
differences in protein folding and flexibility.
Sequence Comparison
Sequence comparisons among selected CoV spike glycoproteins were conducted through
multiple sequence alignment using Clustal X2 [26]. Conserved motifs were identified using
MEME Suite (http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/cgi-bin/mast.cgi) server. MEME Suite represents the
ungapped conserved sequences which are frequently present in a group of related sequences. The
7 motif number has been defined in the current study for motif finding. Whereas, GLAM2Scan
tools was used for the identification of gapped motifs within the related sequences. Conserved
motifs were represented through LOGO using GLAM2Scan tools of MEME Suite server.

Epitope Designing
Conserved epitopes of SARS Cov-2 spike glycoprotein were identified using SVMTrip:
A tool which predicts Linear Antigenic Epitopes [28]. SVMTrip predicts the linier antigenic
epitopes by feeding Support Vector Machine with the Tri-peptide similarity and Propensity
scores of different pre-analyzed epitope data. Annotation of predicted epitopes was performed

through protein BLAST. SVMTrip have gained 80.1% sensitivity and 55.2% precision value
with five fold cross-validation. For epitope prediction 20 amino acid lengths was selected.
Analysis for Epitopes binding efficiency to MHC Class II
The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) binding efficiency of predicted epitops
was performed using Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and Analysis Resource [29]. A total of
5 DPA, 6 DQA and 662 DRB alleles from MHC class II were screened for the detection of best
interactive alleles on the basis of highest consensus percentile rank and lowest IC50 value. All
the analyses were performed on Human Class II allele, using frequently occurring alleles
(frequency > 1%), peptide length of 9mers was selected; consensus percentile rank ≤ 1 was used
for the selection of peptides.
Antigenecity Prediction
Antigenecity of predicted epitopes were determined using Vaxigen v2.0 protective
antigen, tumour antigens and subunit vaccines prediction server [30]. Vaxigen v2.0 uses auto
cross covariance (ACC) transformation of selected protein sequences based on unique amino
acid properties. Each sequence was used to find out 100 known antigen and 100 non-antigens.
The identified sequences were tested for antigenecity by leave-one-out cross-validation and
overall external validation. The prediction accuracy was up to 89%.
Molecular Docking
The structure of MHC class II HLA-DRA, DRB molecule (PDB ID: 2q6w, 5jlz) and fully
glycosylated COVID 19 spike protein structure (PDB ID: 6svb) was retrieved from Protein Data
Bank (PDB) and Docking was performed using HawkDock [31] and ZDOCK [32] Server

and binding free energy value calculation.
Results and Discussion
Structure Prediction and Structure Quality Assessment
The spike glycoprotein structures of seven coronavirus including the recent outbreaking strain
SARS CoV-2 (Covid 19) presented in table 1. The Ramachandran plot data and structural
alignment data suggests that SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 (Covid-2) has higher degree of
alignment (Table 1). The protein sequences were ranged from 1173-1356 amino acids. An effort
was made for epitope based peptide vaccine development by searching MHC-I and II classes
compatible sites and the results yet to come [33]. In the current study, energetic and Inhibition
Concentration50 based selection of SARS CoV-2 spike epitope and its possible glycosylation
effect/structural-hindrance have been evaluated. This may help in urgent vaccination strategies in
the current disastrous situation.
The system generated structures showed sequence identity with the homologous
templates like Human coronavirus HKU1 and OC43 with template 6nzk.1A (Identity: 65.16% &
99.68% respectively), NL63 and 229E with 6u7h.1A (Identity: 65.22% & 99.10% respectively),
MERS CoV with 5w9h.1.L (Identity: 99.69%), whereas, SARS CoV & COVID 19 with
6acc.1.A (Identity: 99.92% & 76.47% respectively).

Structure quality assessment showed

QMEAN values of two SARS strains were -2.82 and -3.63 for respective models (Table 1). This
indicated the degree of native nature of the predicted structures in an universal scale [23]. Good
quality structures were indicated with QMEAN Z-score closest to zero. QMEAN indicated the
overall Z-score of Cβ, All atoms, Solvation and Torsion values. According to the

Ramachandrans plot analysis on number of residues in favoured regions and in additionally
allowed regions, human coronavirus HKU1 (98.5%), NL63 (99.2 %), 229E (99.8 %), OC43
(99.6 %), SARS CoV (99.8%), MERS CoV (98.3%) and COVID 19 (99.4%) were found as very
good quality structures.
Higher degree of similarity between SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 might indicate and
help in the therapeutic and vaccination strategies with reference to the current global situation.
However, an absolute higher degree of virulence and spreading nature of SARS CoV-2 is of
great concern in the present scenario. Present prediction was further validated by the multiple
sequence alignment of all CoVs and topology analysis of three spike glycoprotein structures of
MERS CoV, SARS CoV and COVID-19 (Figure 1 and 2). Position specific multiple sequence
alignment also showed the highest similarity of COVID 19 with the SARS CoV (Figure 1).
Although having sequential diversity, all the selected spike glycoproteins showed some stretches
of conserved sequences Figure 1. The position of N-terminal and C-terminal were found similar
between SARS CoV and COVID-19 during topology analysis. On the other hand, a drastic
difference was observed in MERS CoV in arrangement of secondary structures in the tertiary
region (Figure 2).
Conserved Motif Identification
Based on the alignment pattern, selected sequences were subjected to analysis different
conserved motifs in the protein sequences. A total of 7 conserved motifs were analyzed (Figure
3). Most remarkably all the selected spike glycoprotein sequences were shown to have each 7
motif sequences in similar pattern and some of those conserved motif position were represented
in figure 3. All the identified conserved motifs were individually subjected to protein BLAST for

functional annotation. Where motif 1, 5, 6 and 7 showed similarity with spike protein of Human
and Bat coronavirus origin, motif 2 shared similarities with spike structural protein of mouse
coronavirus origin, motif 3 showed similarity with spike glycoprotein S from SARS CoV and
motif 4 with spike glycoprotein from MERS CoV (Table 2). Highest percent identity of 91.84%
was observed for motif 2. Functional gene ontology based conserved domain identification
within 7 identified motifs were predicted against InterPro database. IPR002552 (CORONA_S2),
PF01601 (CORONA_S2) domains were found within motif 1, 5 and 6. Similar domains were
also observed in motif 2, 3 and 4 with an extra domain of SSF111474 (Coronavirus _S2
glycoprotein). No such domains were observed in motif 7. Identified domains were predicted
with membrane fusion function (GO:0061025) and receptor-mediated virion attachment to host
cell (GO:0046813). Whereas, those were detected as viral envelope (GO:0019031) and integral
component of membrane (GO:0016021). Above analysis indicated that identified motifs were
specific for coronavirus and they could be used as the markers for common coronavirus infection
detection irrespective of COVID 19.
COVID 19 specific Epitope Designing
The epitope designing was conducted only with the COVID 19 spike glycoprotein
sequence and structure. From the sequence analysis, 10 different locations were found which
also showed similarity with SARS CoV and SARS COVID 2 spike glycoprotein in protein
BLAST (Figure 4). Also the motif positions within the spike glycoprotein monomer were
represented in figure 4. Epitopes 1, 4 and 5 were not represented in COVID 19 spike
glycoproteins, as they were found to be embedded within the virus envelop. Among the others,
motifs 2, 3, 6 and 7 were found at the interior location of spike glycoprotein monomer but motifs
8, 9 and 10 were found at the surface of the structure, which could be used as the immunological
targets for the proper diagnosis and treatment of COVID 19. The important issue of epitope

finalization could be confronted by the factor of possible transition between pre-fusion and postfusion spike structural distortion. Specific mutant structure has been designed and tested to be
resistant to conformational change after ACE2 binding and protease cleavage at the S1/S2 site
[34]. This may be indicative to searching suitable epitope which may remain unhindered from
pre- to post- fusion state transition.
Analysis of epitope binding to specific MHC Class II
The proper type of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) selection for identified
COVID 19 epitope was performed and enlisted in Table 3. All the epitopes were individually
screened against 5 DPA, 6 DQA and 662 DRB alleles from MHC class II for best fit analysis.
As, we have analyzed the spike glycoprotein of COVID 19 which is an infectious particle,
transmit from one infected individual to another, alleles of MHC class II were selected for viral
epitope specificity analysis. Where HLA-DRB1*01:13 was observed to bind with 2B, 3B, 4B,
5B, 7B and 8B epitope sequences identified on the basis of IC50 value. Among them sequence
IIAYTMSLGAENSVA (epitope 8B) was shown with lowest IC50 value of 7.11. On the other
hand, HLA-DRB1*04:04 was found for both the sequence of TIMLCCMTSCCSCLK (epitope 5A)
and SIIAYTMSLGAENSV (epitope 8A) on highest consensus percentile rank basis. Highest
value of 9.5 was found for motif 5. Similarly HLA-DRB1*04:08 was observed for the sequences
VRDPQTLEILDITPC (epitope 9A) with highest 9.50 and VSVITPGTNTSNQVA (epitope 10A)
with 7.90 consensus percentile rank value. Individual MHC class II molecules were found for
others (Table 3). The threshold value of highest consensus percentile rank was selected as 10 for
all. As a whole, highest Consensus percentile rank value of 10 was observed for sequence
QQLIRAAEIRASANL (epitope 3A) and lowest IC50 value of 7.11 was observed for sequence
IIAYTMSLGAENSVA (epitope 8B).

The antigenic property of identified target sequences from epitopes was also predicted on
the basis of threshold value of 0.4. Below the threshold value, the sequence has been considered
as non-antigenic and sequences with above value were antigenic in nature. A total of 9 antigenic
sequences were detected (Table 3), among them two sequences AAEIRASANLAATKM (epitope
3B) and ITPGTNTSNQVAVLY (epitope 10B) were found with higher threshold value of
0.7125 and 0.7193 respectively. As the location of 3B was more interior 10B could be used as
potent antigen. According to epitope locations (Figure 4) and antigenic nature, other sequences
like 8A&B, 9A&B could be the target also.
Glycosylation and structural modification
Coronavirus spike proteins are glycosylated in nature where N-acetyl glucosamine
(NAG) is the main component. Glycan shielding and possible epitope masking of an HCoVNL63 has been observed which may be the barrier for proper immunogenic responses [8].
Comparative analysis between glycosylated and non-glycosylated protein revealed some
structural modification at the epitope locations.

Among the identified epitopes 10B with

sequence ITPGTNTSNQVAVLY (598-612) was found with N linked glycosylation at 603
position. The structural modification of this epitope was analyzed using non-glycosylated protein
structure of COVID 19 (Acc. No.: NC_045512.2:21563-25384) and gltcosylated COVID 19
protein (PDB ID: 6vsb). Effect of glycosylation on protein structures revealed that glycosylated
conformation was more organised (Figure 5a) than non-glycosylated one (Figure 5b). Secondary
structural comparison between two epitopes showed more organised structure with attached
NAG residue (Figure 5d) whereas a shorter β-sheet structure was observed when NAG is
removed from the structure (Figure 5c). The peptide interactive site of 10B epitope was blocked
due to NAG attachment. As a result of which antibody binding to the antigen may hamper. The
NAG residue directly binds with N or ASN amino acid residue (Figure 5e). So the removal of

NAG from the spike glycoprotein structure is difficult.

Structural distortion between

glycosylated and non-glycosylated epitope 10B at tertiary level indicated that removal of NAG
may distort the structure of epitope (Figure 5f). Again that may hamper the proper antigenantibody binding.
Effect of epitope glycosylation on MHC class II – epitope binding
In this section energetics of epitope attachment with MHC class II HLA-DRA, DRB was
determined in presence and absence of NAG at the 10B epitope structure through molecular
docking (Figure 6). Docking results showed that without NAG, the binding efficiency of 10B
epitope at the epitope binding site of MHC class II HLA-DRA, DRB molecule was very high.
Among the 10 best docking posture, 1, 2, 3, 7 & 10 were found at the desired location with
docking score of -3552.23, -3472.43, -3436.90, -2767.44 and – 2185.81. Whereas, tertiary
structure of epitope 10B with NAG revealed less affinity to MHC class II HLA-DRA, DRB
molecule. Only 3 postures, 5, 7 & 10 were found at the desired position with docking score of 3085.38, -2949.73 and -2141.10. The best docking of posture 1 (without NAG) and posture 5
(with NAG) were represented in Figure 6 where amino acid attachment differences were clearly
indicated in Figure 6b and 6e. Like the docking score of posture 1 (without NAG) -3552.23, it
also showed the binding free energy of complex, -36.97 (kcal/mol). Whereas, docking score of
posture 5 (with NAG) -3085.38, showed binding free energy of complex, -30.06. That indicated
the rigid binding of 10B epitope when it lacks the NAG molecule. The interactive analysis also
revealed that without NAG, 10B binds with more amino acids of MHC class II HLA-DRA, DRB
(Figure 6c) where structural stabilization by hydrogen bond networking was noticed. But, the
bindings were less when NAG residue was attached (Figure 6f). This result indicated that the
attachment of NAG with epitope also made it difficult for MHC class II molecules to proper
representation of epitope.

Though, epitope 8 A & B were also present at the surface of the spike glycoprotein but
was found to wrapped with a short segment IGAEHVNNSYECD (651- 663) carrying a
glycosylation at N residue position 657 (Figure 7a). As a result of which antibody accessibility
to this epitope may also be difficult. Whereas, surface epitope 9 with sequence
VRDPQTLEILDITPC (576-590) showed highest antigenecity of 1.1285 (Table 3) and highest
consensus percentile rank of 9.50 and found free of any direct or indirect NAG attachment
pattern (Figure 7b). On that basis, it was further analyzed for MHC II HLA-DRB1 (PDB ID:
5jlz) binding through molecular docking. Among the best 10 docking posture, 8 were found at
the desired position of MHC molecule (Figure 7c). The best position 1 was represented in figure
7 d & e. A rigid interaction with six amino acids and one hydrogen bonded amino acid of MHC
molecule was detected for proper representation of epitope 9. So, this could be a target for
COVID -19 vaccine development.
Modifications in spike proteins structure during receptor mediated host cell entry and
further prediction on post-fusion events may result in success in vaccination strategies or
blocking entry. Host protease processing during viral entry and how different lineage B viruses
can recombine to gain entry into human cells are the points also to be noted [35]. SARS CoV-2
induced severe and often lethal lung failure is caused due to its inhibition of ACE-2 expression
[36]. So, keeping the ACE-2 normal functioning but blocking viral entry is the most challenging
issue right now. Possible suitable epitope as screened in the current study may be helpful in this
global pandemic situation. The history of last two decades’ outbreak of these types of virus is
very much evident. The present situation justifies further advanced studies with proper
infrastructure and fund-resources facilities at a global scale to eradicate current or any possible
future outbreak.
