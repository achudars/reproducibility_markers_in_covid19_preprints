Running Title: palmitoylation inhibitors attenuate CoV virulence.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the causative agent
of COVID19 that has infected >76M people and caused >1.68M deaths. The SARSCoV2 Spike glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment and infection of target cells.
The viral Spike protein serves the basis for many putative therapeutic countermeasures
including vaccines, blocking and neutralizing antibodies, and decoy receptors. Here we
investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein
palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. The Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple
juxtamembrane cysteine residues conserved among coronavirus. Increased abundance
of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper-palmitoylation, while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced the
ability of the human CoV 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers. Inhibition of fatty
acid synthase using the pharmacological inhibitor TVB-3166 eliminated palmitoylation of
SARS-CoV2 Spike. Additionally, TVB-3166 attenuated plaque formation and promoted
the survival of mice from a lethal murine CoV infection. Thus, inhibition of the Spike
protein palmitoylation has the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV infections.

Introduction
Since 2002, coronaviruses (CoV) have resulted in three zoonotic outbreaks:
SARS in 2002, MERS in 2012, and SARS-CoV2 in December 20191, 2. CoVs infect
humans and animals and cause various diseases targeting different tissues, including

respiratory, enteric, renal, and hepatic3,4. The current pandemic highlights the need for
effective treatments of this family of viruses.
There are enormous efforts to develop prophylaxis and therapeutic options for
SARS-CoV2, including vaccination, protease inhibitors, and soluble decoy receptors5-7.
Many putative countermeasures target the Spike protein required to attach the virus to
cells via binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) and potentially other host
proteins6. Further, the Spike protein's proteolytic cleavage generates an S2 fragment
capable of stimulating viral fusion and payload delivery into the cytosol8. However, the
high mutation rates of positive-sense (+) sense RNA viruses may result in resistance to
some of these putative therapeutics9, 10. Additionally, the existence of many potential
zoonotic coronavirus species in bat and civet populations necessitates exploring all
available therapies11, 12. Thus, identifying a pan-CoV therapy that targets the host is
desirable for current and potential zoonotic infections.
In the Spring of 2020, Krogan and colleagues reported that the protein
palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5 and its binding partner Golga7 interact with the Spike
protein of SARS-CoV2 using an affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach13. The
results suggest that the cytosolic tail of the Spike protein may be post-translationally
palmitoylated. Consistent with this notion is that the Spike protein of the murine hepatitis
virus (MHV) requires palmitoylation of its C-terminal tail to support virion production14.
Specifically, preventing its palmitoylation prevented the MHV Spike protein from being
incorporated into new virions14. Further, cells expressing a mutant version of Spike
unable to be palmitoylated have a reduced ability to stimulate membrane fusion vis-àvis syncytium formation14, 15. Finally, palmitoylation of the SARS Spike is critical for its
ability to catalyze cell-cell fusion16. Together, these findings motivated us to determine if
the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein is palmitoylated and investigate whether preventing
palmitoylation could serve as a therapeutic strategy.
Results and Discussion
Alignment of the C-terminal domains of several human and murine CoVs reveals the
prevalence of Cys residues within the 20 amino acids adjacent to the membrane (Figure
1A). In the case of SARS-CoV2 Spike, half of the first 20 amino acids are Cys residues,
thus providing ample sites for potential palmitoylation. To explore this possibility, we
transiently transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV2 Spike
tagged with a C-terminal C9 epitope17, 18. Immunoblotting revealed numerous reactive
bands in transfected cells but none in controls (data not shown). Consistent with
previous reports18, 19 we detect several Spike molecular species, including a full-length
~190 kDa, a ~100kDa fragment consistent with the S2 fragment, and several high
molecular weight bands that likely represent a mixture of detergent-resistant multimers.
Next, cells transiently transfected with Spike-C9 from SARS-CoV2 were cultured in
the presence of 15-hexadecynoic acid (15-HDYA), an alkyne containing “clickable”
palmitate analog, to determine if this fatty acid could be covalently attached to the Spike
protein20. Spike-C9 was captured on anti-C9 agarose beads from cell lysates and

subsequently reacted with azide-Cy5.5. As shown in Figure 1B, the Spike-C9 from cells
incubated with alkynyl-palmitate and reacted with the Cy5.5-azide generated a similar
banding pattern as the anti-C9 antibody (Figure1C), suggesting that full-length, S2
fragment and high-molecular weight species of the Spike protein are all palmitoylated.
Considering the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein contains ten putative palmitoylation
sites, we sought to examine the extent of palmitoylation on a per protein basis. We used
an approach termed acyl-polyethylene glycol (PEG) exchange (APE) that involves
substituting each palmitoyl group attached to the Spike protein for a 5-kDa PEG mass
tag21. The unreacted protein (input) and the protein stripped of palmitate but not reacted
with PEG (-PEG) both run at ~190 kDa (Figure 1D). In comparison, Spike-C9 with
palmitoyl groups replaced with 5-kDa PEG displays five distinct bands consistent with
an unmodified band up to and including four sites of palmitoylation. Given the proximity
of the 10 Cys residues within a 20 amino acid stretch, it is unclear if the addition of PEG
molecules could be constrained. Regardless, the results demonstrate that the Spike
protein is indeed capable of being modified on numerous sites and that some individual
proteins contain a minimum of four palmitoyl groups.
To investigate the role of the Spike palmitoylation we used a site-directed
mutagenesis approach to mutate all ten Cys residues to Ser. Lysates of HEK293T cells
expressing wild-type and SpikeC->S-C9 were immunoblotted and revealed that the
SpikeC->S-C9 was expressed at comparable levels to the wild-type (Figure 2A).
Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that both the wild-type Spike and SpikeC->SC9 localize to the plasma membrane (Figure 2B), consistent with previous reports,
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.12.335562. Previous studies have demonstrated that
the Spike protein could catalyze syncytium formation provided the neighboring cells to
express ACE26. To determine if the palmitoylation of the Spike protein is required for
syncytium formation, we used a co-culture strategy where cells co-transfected with
Spike-C9 and mCherry were lifted and re-seeded with cells expressing ACE2 and GFP.
Co-cultures containing Spike but no ACE2 showed no signs of cell-cell fusion, as
expected, while co-cultures with both Spike and ACE2 displayed numerous large
syncytium that contains both GFP and mCherry [Figure 2C]. In contrast, HEK293T cells
expressing SpikeC->S-C9 co-cultured with ACE2 expressing cells displayed only a few
instances of small mCH- and GFP-positive cells. The results demonstrate that the Cys
residues are required for the Spike protein to facilitate syncytium formation.
The human genome encodes a family of 23 zinc finger Asp-His-His-Cys (ZDHHC)
domain-containing palmitoyltransferases22. Yet, only ZDHHC5 interacts with the SARSCoV2 Spike13. We confirmed the previous results and found that Spike-C9 could
transiently interact with HA-tagged ZDHHC5 (Figure 3A, B). Additionally, we found that
in cells ectopically expressing HA-ZDHHC5, more of the Spike-C9 is palmitoylated
based on the intensity and the appearance of a higher molecular weight band in the
APE assay (Figure 3C). Next, we wanted to know if silencing ZDHHC5 could limit the
spread of CoV in cell culture. To do this, we used the biosafety level 2 human CoV
229E as a model. Although the Spike protein of this CoV recognizes a different host
protein, CD1323, its cytosolic tail is remarkably similar to that of SARS-CoV2 (Figure

1A). Using the APE assay, we found that the 229E Spike is palmitoylated on multiple
sites. However, the exact number of palmitoylation sites is not apparent compared to
SARS-CoV2 (Figure 1D). The banding pattern of the 229E Spike was less clear and
often resulted in a smear. Regardless, the intensity of the PEGylated proteins is further
enhanced when ZDHHC5 levels are increased, and a higher molecular weight is
detectable (Figure 3D). This finding is consistent with the Spike proteins of SARS-CoV2
and likely 229E being substrates of ZDHHC5.
To investigate the role of ZDHHC5 in the generation of virulent progeny, we used
two complementary cell-based assays. First, we silenced ZDHHC5 in confluent
monolayers of MRC-5 cells and assessed the ability of 229E to form plaques (Figure
3E, F). We found that control monolayers produced an average of ~106 PFU/ml,
whereas cells with reduced levels of ZDHHC5 had substantially fewer plaques than
siControl. From the plaque assay, it was unclear if the loss of ZDHHC5 was impacting
the initial infection or the subsequent spread throughout the monolayer. To complement
the plaque assay we used a liquid culture assay to investigate infection and
dissemination. In this assay, cells were incubated in the presence of 229E virus at a low
multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.005 for 2 hours, followed by extensive washing and
further incubation for 72 hours. Following the incubation period, cells were processed
and stained with an antibody against the 229E Spike24 and an Alexa488 secondary
antibody. As shown in Figure 3G, H ≈51% of the siControl cells were positive for the
Spike protein. In contrast, 16% of the ZDHHC5 silenced cells were positive for the Spike
protein. The results are consistent with the notion that ZDHHC5 is required for the
generation of virulent progeny but not the initial infection of the MRC-5 cells.
Based on our data, we sought to determine if ZDHHC5 is a suitable therapeutic
target for the treatment of CoV infections. Unfortunately, no specific inhibitor of
ZDHHC5 exists. However, we found that the fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor
cerulenin prevented the palmitoylation of ZDHHC5 substrates, NOD1 and NOD225. This
is logical since FASN produces palmitoyl-CoA, the substrate for the ZDHHCs. However,
cerulenin and its derivative C75 are not suitable therapeutically due to severe weight
loss and off-target effects in murine models26-28. Fortunately, a series of heterocyclic
FASN inhibitors have been developed by Sagimet Biosciences, formerly 3-V
Biosciences (San Mateo, USA). One of these inhibitors, TVB-2640, is orally available,
well-tolerated, and a highly potent FASN inhibitor in clinical trials for cancer
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03179904)29 and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease30. TVB2640 is not commercially available. However, a surrogate compound, TVB-3166, is
commercially available and an effective FASN inhibitor in cell culture and mice31.
Treating HEK293T cells expressing Spike-C9 with TVB-3166 or 2-bromopalmitate, a
non-specific inhibitor of ZDHHC enzymes, attenuated the palmitoylation of the Spike
protein (Figure 4A). Likewise, TVB-3166 was also able to partly reduce the
palmitoylation of the 229E Spike protein (Figure 4B) and in PFU assay, treating cells
with TVB-3166 after infection, attenuated 229E plaque formation by nearly 86% (Figure
4C, D).

The cellular results demonstrating that TVB-3166 attenuated Spike palmitoylation,
and limited spread of the 229E virus motivated us to try this orally available FASN
inhibitor in a mouse model. To do this, we nasally infected A/J mice intranasally with
150,000 TCID50 of MHV-S. In control mice, changes in health were noticed as early as
two days post-infection; all proceeded to deteriorate as monitored by several health
indicators, including decreased temperature, body weight, and activity. By day 5, all
control mice were sacrificed as per animal care protocols. In contrast, mice treated daily
with 30mg/kg of TVB-3166 by oral gavage showed both prolonged survival and even
recovery (Figure 4E). The results demonstrate that reducing palmitoyl-CoA levels is
beneficial during CoV infection as this reduction promotes survival in mice.
We have established that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV2 is palmitoylated and that
this modification supports its ability to catalyze membrane fusion. This observation is
similar to findings on MHV and SARS Spike proteins14, 16. The results suggest that
palmitoylation of the S2 fragment is critical to facilitate membrane fusion. However,
palmitoylation of the full-length protein may also influence protein interactions or viral
assembly. Indeed, the MHV Spike's palmitoylation is required for interactions with the M
protein to incorporate the Spike protein into new virions14. Since no specific or clinically
available inhibitors of ZDHHC5 are available, we used a FASN inhibitor, TVB-3166, to
attenuate palmitoyl-CoA synthesis. We could not find any other ZDHHC isoforms in
affinity purification – mass spectrometry experiments consistent with Krogan and
colleagues. However, there is the possibility that another ZDHHC may also be able to
modify the Spike protein. Additionally, the envelope (E) protein of MHV also requires
palmitoylation for the assembly of virions. Thus, reducing palmitoyl-CoA levels may
prevent the palmitoylation of multiple CoV proteins. Treating cells or mice with TVB3166 limited the ability of human CoV 229E to produce virulent progeny in cell culture
and promoted survival of mice subjected to a lethal MHV infection. We suggest that our
findings warrant further COVID studies using the structurally related TVB-2640 that has
already advanced to Phase II clinical trials for fatty liver disease and cancer30, 32.
Alterations in lipid metabolism are documented in CoV infections. Sera from
patients with COVID19 have altered apolipoproteins and lipid levels33, while 229E
infected cells have been shown to have increased levels of free fatty acids33. As
enveloped viruses, CoVs-induced remodeling of the cellular lipidome may support viral
replication. Additionally, the ectodomain of SARS-CoV2 Spike contains a binding pocket
for another fatty acid, linoleic acid34. The importance of this pocket is unclear, but it is
conserved in other pathogenic CoVs. Further studies on the importance of fatty acids
and lipid metabolism are needed to clarify these aspects of CoV infections.
We anticipate that our findings will advance the possibility of using TVB-2640 or
other FASN inhibitors to treat COVID-19 or other CoV infections. Since FASN is a host
enzyme, the likelihood of viral resistance is low and would necessitate extensive
mutagenesis of the Spike protein to bypass the requirement for palmitoylation.
Clinically, the identification and approval of an orally available pan-CoV treatment or
prophylaxis would be beneficial in the short-term and the future against other zoonotic
CoVs.

Mutagenesis of SARS CoV-2 Spike multi-cysteine to serine: The SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein has 10 cysteines in its cytosolic tail; C1235, C1236, C1240, C1241,
C1243, C1247, C1248, C1250, C1253, C1254. In this study, all 10 Cys residues were
replaced by Ser. Sequential PCR and overlap extension PCR was used for the
complete substitution strategy. Using pcDNA3.1 SARS CoV-2 Spike-C9 as an initial
template, two fragments were generated: 5’-, and 3’-terminal fragments. To amplify 3’terminal fragment (contains 10 Cys to Ser mutation), three sequential PCR reactions
were performed by using overlapping forward primers (F2 primer overlaps with F1
primers, F3 primer overlaps with F2 primers). As a result, fragment 1 served as a DNA
template of fragment 2, and fragment 2 as a template of fragment 3. The fragment 1,2,

[PMID: 317807750]
Immunoblotting: SDS polyacrylamide gels were transferred on PVDF membranes by
Trans-blot Turbo System at 25 Volts for 20 min. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA
for 1 hour at room temperature and were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in
blocking solution at 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed with TBS-0.1% Tween20
(TBST) for 5 minutes, 3 times and were subsequently incubated with appropriate
secondary antibodies. Blots were then washed three times with TBST for 5 minutes
each wash. The membranes were treated with ECL and imaged with ChemiDoc
Imaging System (BioRad).
Co-Immunoprecipitation: HEK293T cells seeded in T25 Flask (25cm2) were grown
until reaching 70-90% confluency. Cells were transfected with 3xHA-zDHHC5 and CoV2 Spike-C9 plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s
instruction and incubated for 16-24hrs. For protein cross-linking, cells were incubated
with 2mM DSP crosslinker in PBS at 4°C for 2hrs. DSP was quenched in 20 mM glycine
in PBS for 15 min, and cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (20mM Tris and adjust to
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 2 mM EDTA) supplemented with cOmplete Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail tablet, EDTA-Free at a constant agitation for 30 min at 4°C. Cell
lysates were centrifuged at 12,000xg for 20 min, and supernatant was collected.
Samples were pre-cleared by incubating with protein G Sepharose beads and were
spun at 14,000g for 1min to collect the supernatant. Pre-cleared samples were
incubated with anti-C9 or anti-HA primary antibody for overnight at 4°C. To form primary
antibody-bead complex, Protein G beads were added and incubated for 30min. Beads

were washed in cold wash buffer (20mM Tris, pH 7.4, 350 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2 mM
EDTA) 6 times, and proteins were eluted with SDS Laemmli buffer and heated for
30min at 37°C prior to SDS-PAGE.
Immunofluorescence: Cells were seeded on a 18mm-round coverslip in 12-well plate.
Cells expressing myc-ACE2, CoV-2 Spike or CoV-2 SpikeC->S-C9 were fixed with 4%
PFA. Remaining PFA was quenched by 0.15M glycine, and cells were permeabilized by
0.1% Triton-X100 for 20 min at RT. Cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1hr and
probed with a primary antibody (human myc, CoV-2 Spike) in 5% BSA for 1hr. Cells
were washed with PBS and probed with fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies for
1hr.
Confocal Microscopy: Imaging in the St. Michael’s Hospital BioImaging was
conducted using an Andor Diskcovery multi-modal imaging system provided by Quorum
Technology (Guelph, Ontario). The system is based on a Leica DMi8 equipped with a
63x/1.47 NA oil objective; 405, 488, 561, and 637 nm laser lines; 450/50, 525/50,
600/50, 610/75, and 700/75 emission filters. Images were acquired using Metamorph
software on a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 V2 sCMOS camera. Imaging at Ryerson
University was performed on the Quorum WaveFX spinning disc based on an inverted
Leica DMi8 equip with an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera using a 10x objective
controlled by MetaMorph.

Metabolic labelling/ on-bead click chemistry assay: HEK293T cells seeded in T25
Flask (25cm2) were transfected with pcDNA3.1-SARS CoV-2- Spike-C9 and incubated
overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) charcoal-stripped FBS with or without
100 μM 15-HPYA (Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, Arizona). After 18-24 hours of
labeling, cells were washed twice with ice-cold D-PBS and collected following scraping.
Cells were lysed in IP buffer (20mM Tris and adjust to pH 8.0, 137mM NaCl, 1% NP40,
2 mM EDTA) supplemented with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet, EDTAFree (Roche) and Immunoprecipitated using C9-agarose bead (Cube biotech) at 4°C
overnight. The beads were then washed with ice-cold D-PBS 4 times and incubated in
D-PBS supplemented with 1 μM Cy5.5-azide (Click Chemistry Tools), 1 mM TCEP
(adjusted to pH 7.0), 1 mM CuSO4, 0.1 mM TBTA (1:4 v/v DMSO: tert-Butanol) for 2h.
The beads were washed 5 times with D-PBS, and proteins were eluted with 5X SDS
Laemmli buffer. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to in-gel
fluorescence using the 685nm laser on the Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.
Acyl-PEG exchange assay: HEK293T cells were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM
+10% FBS and were transfected with lipofectamine 3000 reagent. For each well 2.5 mg
of either: 229E Spike-C9 + HA-ZDHHC5, 229E Spike-C9+ EGFP-C1, SARS-CoV-2
Spike-C9 and HA-ZDHHC5 or SARS-CoV2 Spike-C9 + EGFP-C1 DNA mixtures were
diluted in Opti-mem and mixed with Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Upon transfection, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of
TVB-3166, or 50 μM 2-BP. 16 -18 hours post transfection cells were lysed and
processed with the SiteCounterTM S-palmitoylated protein kit (Badrilla, Leeds, UK)

following the manufacturer instructions. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE by
resolving on a 3-8% CriterionTM XT Tris-Acetate gel (Bio-Rad) for immunoblotting.
Propagation of the Human 229E Coronavirus: Human coronavirus 229E (ATCC® VR740™) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA.
Stocks of the 229E virus were produced by propagation in MRC-5 cells. Briefly, a T75
flask of 90% confluent MRC-5 cells were infected with a MOI of 0.01 for 2 hours at 33°C
in infection media for viral adsorption. Unbound virus was removed by washing cells 2X
with infection media, and infected cells were returned to the 33°C incubator in 12mL
infection media for 72 hours. The virus-containing supernatant was centrifuged at 1000
x g for 5 minutes to remove cellular debris, and single use aliquots of the virus were
frozen at -80°C.
Human CoV 229E plaque forming unit assay: PFU assays was used to determine
viral titers and experiments using protocols adapted from previous publications37, 38.
Briefly, MRC-5 cells seeded on 6-well tissue culture and grown to 100% confluency in
EMEM+ 10% FBS+ 1% PenStrep. Plates were infected with serially diluted virus in
infection media (EMEM+2% FBS+ 1% PenStrep) for 1 hour at 33°C in a volume of
300uL with periodic agitation. After virus adsorption, unbound virus was removed by
washing with infection media followed by agarose overlay with 1X MEM Temin’s
modification (Thermo Fisher, 11935046) +0.3% agarose. Cells were then returned to
the 33°C incubator until they showed obvious signs of cytopathic effects (typically 4-7
days post-infection), upon which plates were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin
for 4 hours, followed by removal of the agarose plug and staining with 1% crystal violet
for 15 minutes. Plaques were counted based on standard protocols for determining viral
titer.
Liquid viral infection assay: MRC-5 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and
transfected as described above. Cells were infected with 229E at an MOI of 0.005 for 2
hours in a total volume of 2mL per well. After virus absorption, cells were washed 2X
with infection media and then replaced with 2mL infection for incubation at 33°C. After
72 hours, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 1 hour, followed by: 0.15% glycine, 0.1%
Triton X-100, 3% BSA, for 15 minutes each. Cells were then incubated in a 1:50 dilution
of mouse anti-229E Spike protein antibody by inverted drop for 1 hour at room
temperature. After washing, cells were incubated in 1:1000 anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488
secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and DAPI (1 mg/mL) for 1h at room
temperature, followed by mounting on slides with DAKO mounting media. Images were
acquired with the WaveFX system. Total fluorescent signal was quantified with ImageJ.
MHV-S infection of mice: Four-week-old female A/J mice were purchased from
Jackson Laboratories. Mice were housed in the St. Michael’s Hospital Vivarium on a
standard light:dark cycle and were given free access to food and water. Prior to
infection, mice were acclimatized for 1 week. Mouse infection experiments were
performed in the dedicated BSL-2 room in the vivarium and procedures were conducted
in accordance with the St. Michael’s Hospital Animal Care Committee guidelines for
animal use, under an approved animal protocol (ACC962, St. Michael’s Hospital). One
day prior to infection, the necks of mice were shaved and chemical depilatory cream

was used to remove all hair in order to obtain optimal oxygen saturation measurements
during the study. For infection, mice were sedated with 5% isoflurane and infected
intranasally with 150,000 TCID50/mouse of MHV-S (Cedarlane, VR-766), which is
known to induce pneumonitis (PMID: 17041219). The virus was diluted in PBS to a final
volume of 75μL prior to administration. After infection, mice were allowed to recover for
ten minutes in a cage on a covered heating pad. On the day of infection, TVB-3166
(Sigma, SML 1694) was reconstituted by adding a small volume of DMSO (10% of the
final volume) to the vial. The vial was briefly vortexed and heated in a 37°C water bath,
then corn oil was added to make a 5mg/mL solution for treatments. Following recovery,
mice were randomly separated into weight matched groups and immediately received
solvent control or TVB-3166 (30 mg/kg) by oral gavage. For the remainder of the study,
mice were monitored daily and received one dose of TVB-3166 or solvent control per
day. As previously reported (PMID: 26046800), mice were sacrificed if they reached two
of four of the following endpoints: weight loss of 30% of the initial weight, body
temperature below 31°C, oxygen saturation below 75% or activity level of 1 (moribund).
For the measurement of oxygen saturation on awake mice, the Mouse Ox Plus device
and software from Starr Life Sciences was used. Accurate readings were obtained until
day 3 when regrowth of hair and weight loss prevented reliable measurements.
