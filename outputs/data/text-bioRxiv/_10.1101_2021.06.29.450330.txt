Abstract

29

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 was first detected in Belgium on 3rd February 2020,

30

albeit the first epidemiological wave started in March and ended in June 2020. One year after the first

31

epidemiological wave hit the country data analyses reveled the temporal and variant distribution of

32

SARS-CoV-2 and its implication with Belgian epidemiological measures. In this study, 766 complete

33

SARS-CoV-2 genomes of samples originating from the first epidemiological were sequenced to

34

characterize the temporal and geographic distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium through

35

phylogenetic and variant analysis. Our analysis reveals the presence of the major circulating SARS-

36

CoV-2 clades (G, GH and GR) and lineages circulating in Belgium at that time. Moreover, it

37

contextualizes the density of SARS-CoV-2 cases over time with non-intervention measures taken to

38

prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium, specific international case imports and the functional

39

implications of the most representative non-synonymous mutations present in Belgium between

40

February to June 2020.

41

Introduction

42

The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were detected in December 2019 in Wuhan

43

(China). Shortly thereafter, the causative agent was identified as SARS-CoV-21. SARS-CoV-2 has

44

spread worldwide in a short period of time, unlike the Betacoronavirus members SARS-CoV-1 (2002-

45

2003) and MERS-CoV (2012 and 2015), whose outbreaks could be better contained, limiting

46

international spread and averting global transmission2–4. Based on publicly available data, the case

47

fatality

48

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), lower than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, with 9.6%

49

and 34.3%, respectively 5, although the true infection fatality rate is likely lower, as many asymptomatic

50

or mildly symptomatic cases remain undiagnosed6. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need for effective

51

treatments, as the global death toll has already surpassed 3.7 million confirmed deaths (WHO

52

coronavirus dashboard, 12/06/2021), and measures taken to control the spread of the virus have

53

significantly impacted social and economic activity world-wide.

55

SARS-CoV-2 is a non-segmented, positive single-strand RNA (+ssRNA) virus with a genome length

56

of around 30,000 nucleotides. The genome is organized into 12 genes that code for structural and non-

57

structural proteins5. Structural proteins are the Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and

58

Nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Non-structural proteins are all generated from the ORF1ab polyprotein,

59

including the core proteins Nsp12 (RNA synthesis), Nsp7 and Nsp87. Additionally, at least 5 accessory

60

proteins are encoded alongside the structural proteins: ORF3a (putative apoptotic factor), ORF6

immunomodulator), and ORF10 (unknown function). Recent estimates situate the mutation rate of

63

SARS-CoV-2 between 0.8 × 10−3 and 1.12 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year8,9, equating to 2 to 2.8

64

substitutions/month. As per the writing of this manuscript, SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been

65

organized dynamically in three large clades, based on non-synonymous substitutions10: (i) clade G

66

(D614G in the Spike), (ii) clade V (G251 in ORF3a) and (iii) clade S (L84S in ORF8) 11. The Spike

67

mutation at D614G has been recently linked to an increased virus production in host cells and seems to

68

be the predominant mutation in European clades since March 202012. Genetic diversity analyses

69

currently play an important role in improving our understanding of SARS-CoV-2. Complete genome

70

sequences shared through the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) have been, and

71

still are, valuable to monitor and contain the pandemic. Additionally, this unprecedented international

72

cooperation has allowed to rapidly evaluate the viral origin and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-213

73

based on sequence similarity. Likewise, the availability of sufficient and diverse genome sequences to

74

capture the variability of SARS-CoV-2 may allow estimations of which sets of antiviral drugs are most

75

likely to be repurposed for this virus13. Changes in infection and mortality rates are influenced by SARS-

In Belgium, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on 3th of February 2020

79

(2020 week 5), from an asymptomatic individual who was part of a quarantined group of 10 travelers,

80

epatriated from Wuhan to Brussels16. During week 8 of 2020, the Belgian government started engaging

81

in travel regulations from and into China, trying to minimize the possible SARS-CoV-2 introduction

82

events into the country. Still, borders were not closed until week 11, thus several entry events occurred

83

prior to strict border regulations. Later, the Belgian government attributed part of these introduction

84

events to returning travelers from the Carnival break (Figure 1). In March 2020, the rapidly growing

85

number of confirmed cases alarmed the government, who decided to take restrictive measures to reduce

86

the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into and inside the country. By week 10, the federal government limited

87

indoor activity nationwide by closing bars and restaurants and prohibiting sportive and cultural

88

activities (lockdown). From week 11 to week 18, strict social distancing measures were applied, and all

89

non-essential travel and gatherings were suspended. Strict isolation policy during this period, which

90

included the Easter break (weeks 15-16, Figure 1) were key to a substantial reduction of cases. Part of

91

the lockdown measures were alleviated at week 18, although most public establishments were only

92

allowed to re-open to the public in week 23 (Figure 1). Positive cases steadily increased until mid April

93

(2020 week 15), after which case numbers decreased until mid June, following several intervention

94

measures (Figure 1, Suppl. Table 1). During this period, 59.242 COVID-19 cases were reported. For

95

776 of these cases, the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome has been sequenced (1.3% of positive cases,

96

Suppl. Table 1), including the first re-infection case in Belgium and one of the first cases world-wide17.

97

In this study, we performed phylogenetic and mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

Sample collection

110

Samples were obtained through University Hospitals Leuven, the Belgian National Reference Center

111

(NRC) for Respiratory Pathogens. Different types of samples including oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs,

112

broncho-alveolar lavages and endotracheal aspirates were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by

113

Reverse Transcription qPCR at the NRC. Samples were randomly selected from a pseudo-anonymized

114

database considering viral load (Ct < 20) and spread among collection dates and municipalities. Samples

115

with low titulation coming from low-positivity regions or time periods were also considered in the

116

study.

117

118

RNA extraction and sequencing

119

RNA extraction was performed with 140 µl of swab transporting medium using the QIAampViral RNA

120

extraction kit (ref. 52904, Qiagen). SARS-CoV-2 genomes were amplified following the ARTIC

121

network protocol V1 and V216. Briefly, reverse-transcription with SuperScript IV (ref. 18090010,

122

Invitrogen) was performed on SARS-CoV-2 positive RNA extracts. Multiplex PCR with specific

123

primer pools, tiling the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome, was performed on cDNA using Q5 Hot Start

124

High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (ref. M0493S, New England Biolabs). Amplicons were immediately

125

cleaned up with AMPure XP beads (New England Biolabs, ref. A63880) and libraries were prepared

126

using the ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies with the

127

modifications detailed in the ARTIC protocol. Libraries were quantified using QUBIT 1X dsDNA HS

128

Assay Kit (ref. Q33231, Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed on MinION and GridION platforms

129

using MinKNOW’s (v19.12) built-in basecalling, demultiplexing and adapter trimming (dual-barcode

130

detection at 60% barcode sequence identity).

131

Data collection and phylogenetic analysis

132

Sequencing runs were processed using the ARTIC analysis pipeline and custom scripts. Sequence

133

metadata was collected and complemented to their respective GISAID records. SARS-CoV-2 lineages

134

were derived using the Pangolin tool (https://cov-lineages.org/pangolin.html, github.com/cov-

135

lineages/pangolin) 10. Epidemiological data was obtained from Sciensano (the Belgian federal institute

136

for health, https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/). Sequences were aligned with MAFFT18, SNPs were

137

collected with snp-sites19 and annotated with VCF-annotator (https://github.com/rpetit3/vcf-annotator).

138

Data analysis was performed in R v3.520 and Tidyverse21. Phylogenetic analysis were conducted with

139

IQTREE22, TimeTree23 and JModelTest24 using the non-redundant set of Belgian SARS-CoV-2

140

genomes (528 sequences) to generate a time-scaled Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree

Geographic distribution and sequencing coverage

145

The first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic hit Belgium in March 2020, although the first

146

imported case was already detected in the first days of February 2020. Throughout the first

147

wave, samples were transferred from across Belgium (Figure 2) through the NRC for

148

Respiratory Pathogens. Sequencing covered all 10 Belgian provinces and the Brussels-Capital

149

Region, with the exception of the sparsely populated Luxembourg province (representing

150

<2.5% of the Belgian population). Overall sequence density (SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence

151

counts per town and province) is wide-spread, with the provinces of Limburg, Vlaams-Brabant

152

and Brussels being slightly overrepresented due to the geographic proximity of these provinces

153

to the location of the NRC. Sequencing rate (proportion of sequenced cases per total cases

154

reported) was ~1% throughout most of the period, with the exception of the first weeks of the

155

pandemic, in which the number of detected cases was low and hence a higher sequencing rate

156

of 36% - 100% (Suppl. Table 1).

Temporal distribution and phylogeny

166

The temporal distribution of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be observed with a time-

167

scaled maximum likelihood-tree (ML), in which sampling dates (tip dates) re-calibrate the

168

phylogenetic distance between sequences (Figure 3), as previously used elsewhere 16. Most of

169

the sequenced cases correspond to ‘domestic’ spread of the virus (within the country), as most

170

of the tips in the phylogenetic tree tend to cluster at short distance with other tips. Tips with

171

long branch lengths that occupy single clusters without neighbouring tips may represent

172

international re-introductions or undersampled ‘domestic’ events. The latter becomes more

173

relevant as the number of available sequences decreases over time (especially during May and

174

June of 2020). Interestingly, 4 tips are clustered apart from the rest of the phylogenetic tree,

175

indicating strong divergence from the rest of the tree (Figure 3, dashed rectangle). These cases

176

correspond to direct internationally imported events (i) before non-essential international travel

177

was banned (original case in February and a secondary case in March), or (ii) despite border

178

regulations, as the sequences represented by the tips in April and May do not cluster with the

179

rest of the tree, indicating a direct import event (after border regulations were enforced).

purposes.

191
192

Tip density in the ML tree is not constant over time, in part due to sequence downsampling

193

(merge sequences at 100% identity and same collection date), sequencing availability (access

194

to sample for sequencing) and differences in COVID-19 positivity rates (Figure 1). The highest

195

density is found throughout April, following the trend of COVID-19 positive cases and SARS-

196

CoV-2 sequenced genomes shown in Figure 1. As hinted previously, intervention measures

197

applied in mid March (week 11, Figure 1) reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the

198

Belgian population, reducing reported positive cases from May onwards. Correspondingly, a

199

declining tip density can be observed for May-June in the ML tree. Despite higher sequencing

200

rates would have been desirable for the study; sample accessibility and reagent discontinuity

201

forbade a deeper genomic surveillance on the Belgian population. Nevertheless, as shown in

202

Dellicour et al., the number of cases sequenced and its dispersion between March – June

203

provide sufficient resolution to identify and trace SARS-CoV-2 lineages through time 16.

204

205

Isolate classification and distribution of relevant mutations

206

SARS-CoV-2 acquires 2-3 nucleotide mutations per month (evolutionary rate 0.8 × 10−3 and

207

1.12 × 10−3 substitutions/site/year8,9). The acquisition of genetic changes allows the different

208

genome sequences to be classified into groups. Currently, there are 2 widely used SARS-CoV-

209

2 classifications based on: (i) specific amino acid changes (as found in GISAID, and called

210

Clade hereafter or CoVariants in Nextclade 25) and (ii) a dynamic phylogenetic classification

211

10

212

CoV-2 clades are further subdivided into 7 different groups, depending on their mutations: L

213

(C241, C3037, A23403, C8782, G11083, G26144, T28144), G (C241T, C3037T, A23403G

214

nucleotide mutations and the aminoacid change D614G in the spike protein), GH (G clade

215

mutations plus G25563T and the aminoacid change Q57H in NS3), GR (G clade mutations

216

plus G28882A and the aminoacid change G204R in the nucleoprotein), S (C8782T, T28144C

217

and the aminoacid change L84S in NS8), V ( G11083T, G26144T and the amino acid changes

218

L37F in NSP6 and G251V in NS3 ) and O (others). The lineage classification of SARS-CoV-

219

2 makes use of Maximum-likelihood phylogenies of globally available viral sequences to

220

dynamically name the branches of the tree with an alphanumeric system (defining first a major

221

lineage, A or B, and then numbering the successive branching events). As shown by Alm et

222

al., there is a correspondence between SARS-CoV-2 classification between GISAID clades,

223

Pangolin lineages and the NextStrain classification scheme (not elaborated upon)26.

224
225

Distribution of clades and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 during the first epidemic wave of SARS-

226

CoV-2 in Belgium strongly resembles the European distribution reported by Alm et al., with

227

the G (Figure 4, blue) and GR (red) clades being the most prominent. GH (orange) emerges

228

with an intermediate frequency, slowly diminishing towards the end. Together, the G clades,

229

being the most prevalent ones, are likely responsible for most of the ‘domestic’ transmission

230

cases. Clades L, S and V are seldom found during these initial 5 months of the SARS-CoV-2

231

epidemic in Belgium and were likely linked to direct import cases and their direct spread

232

sphere. Specifically, clade S (the most ancestral SARS-CoV-2 clade) is the least prevalent,

233

being detected only 4 times, each time linked to international travel and as seen in Figure 2,

234

forming a clearly distinct clade directly rooted to the initial spreading events. Regarding

235

lineages, the largest contributors were B.1 (G clade), B.1.1 (GR clade) and B.1.5 (G clade),

236

especially in March and April (Table 1 and Suppl. Figure 1, respectively). Overall, more than

237

42 different lineages were detected over the course of 5 months, 40 representing B-lineages

238

and 2 representing A-lineages (A and A.2).

Non-synonymous mutations were distributed across the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure

251

5). Certain amino acid changes were found to be more frequent in the complete dataset. An

252

amino acid change was deemed frequent when it was present in at least 10% of sequences of

253

the dataset (n = 776, 77 sequence count threshold). We observed five frequent mutations:

254

L3606F (ORF1a, NSP6), T5020I (ORF1ab, NSP12), I65256T (ORF1ab, NSP15), D614G (S

255

gene), R203K and G204K (N gene). The prevalence of some of these mutations can be traced

256

back directly to specific clades, as some clades are defined by specific amino acid changes.

257

Examples are D614G, which is linked to clade G and its derivatives (GH and GR) or G204K,

258

which is present in clade GR. Other mutations that are characteristic of specific clades, such as

259

Q57H in the NS3 (GH clade), are present in the dataset but at frequencies below 10%.

268

Prevalence of mutations L3606F, T5020I, I65256T, D614G, R203K and G204K varies over

269

time (Figure 6). The amino acid substitution D614G, which is linked to an increased

270

replicability of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells27, was already prevalent in our sequencing space

271

from the beginning of March (week 9). Moreover, the ratio of G614/D614 sequences increases

272

over time, corresponding with data reported across Europe, where D614G was the most

273

prevalent viral variant from April 2020 onwards (Figure 6) 26. As mentioned above, D614G is

274

linked to a strong functional change, as the aspartic acid (D), an amino acid with bivalent cation

275

binding properties, is exchanged for a glycine (G), a small apolar aminoacid, known to be

276

flexible and capable of interrupting helicoidal secondary structures. This single non-

277

synonymous mutation increases the fitness of the virus by increasing its replication in the upper

278

respiratory tract. Increased titers in the upper respiratory tract coupled with a lack of increased

279

morbidity makes D614G an adaptive variant for human-to-human transmission14,27,28. R203K

280

and G204K are collinear and share the same evolutionary history in the Belgian set of

281

sequences. K203/K204 are present in 31% of our sequences. Interestingly, both positions are

282

found to change to a lysine (K). Unlike G204K, R203K corresponds to a conservative amino

283

acid change. Both K and arginine (R) are basic amino acids with DNA/RNA binding properties.

284

Both non-synonymous mutations are found between the RNA-Binding Domain (RBD) and the

285

Dimerization Domain (BB), also called the link domain, of the nucleocapsid protein. Based on

286

the high frequency of K203/K204 it appears that a local increase in positive polarity does not

287

hinder N protein function. L3606F and T5020I (lineage B.1), causing amino acid changes in

288

the NSP6 and NSP12 proteins, respectively, also seem to follow similar frequency trends over

289

the first 20 weeks of the epidemic (Figure 6). Position 3606 of the ORF1ab (NSP6) gene

290

undergoes a substantial change from a leucine (L), an aliphatic amino acid, to a phenylalanine

291

(F), a more reactive aromatic amino acid. Position 5020 in the ORF1ab (NSP12) undergoes a

292

strong change in hydrophobicity between a threonine (T), a polar hydroxylic amino acid and

293

an isoleucine (I), an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid (an increase in 0.493 in hydrophobicity).

294

Similarly, the I6525T change in the ORF1ab (NSP15) results in a strong decrease in

295

hydrophobicity. Currently, little is known about the functional consequences of these changes.

Conclusion

303

The first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Belgium spanned from February 3rd (first

304

reported case) to mid June. Over that period, 776 SARS-CoV-2 cases were sequenced,

305

representing a randomized subset of the early circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium. Most

306

reported COVID-19 cases corresponded to local or ‘domestic’ transmissions of SARS-CoV-2.

307

Late March border control measures greatly contributed to reduce international import (i.e.

308

returning travelers from holidays). Domestic clades and lineage distribution were comparable

309

to the general European trend, with clades G, GR and GH being the most prominent. Despite

310

the sequencing rate being relatively low during the peak of transmission of the first wave in

311

Belgium (weeks 13 - 16, April 2020), it was sufficient to identify the presence of minor clades

312

L, S and V, with S being mostly linked to direct SARS-CoV-2 import due to (i) its very low

313

prevalence in Belgium (4 cases), (ii) its placement in a separate clade in the phylogenetic tree,

314

as seen in Figure 3 and (iii) its direct link to travel history. Identification of 2 S clade sequences

315

after border and flight regulations were already in place hints at the possibility of a small

316

number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases eluding the established measures. Furthermore,

317

sequence resolution was sufficient to identify more than 42 SARS-CoV-2 lineages throughout

318

the period, comparable to other reporting countries26. The most frequently observed non-

319

conservative amino acid changes are in line with the presented clade distribution. Despite some

320

of the mutations corresponding to significant changes in the chemical properties of the amino

321

acids, little is known about their functional consequences on SARS-CoV-2 infection and

322

COVID-19 presentation. Further efforts are required in (i) the detection of SARS-CoV-2

323

variants through random genomic surveillance to check measure effectiveness and viral

324

evolution and in (ii) functional studies to map detected non-synonymous changes into viral

325

behaviour.
