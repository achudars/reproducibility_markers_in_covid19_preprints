ABSTRACT

25

The newly emerged human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of

26

respiratory illness. The innate immune response is critical for protection against

27

Coronaviruses. However, little is known about the interplay between the innate immune

28

system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary

29

human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface.

30

We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally

31

released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies

32

found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-

33

inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNFα, CXCL8. We

34

also identified NF-κB and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-

35

inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I

36

or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with

37

type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this

38

corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate

39

that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the

40

production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type

41

I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-

42

19 patients.

IMPORTANCE

45

The current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently

46

emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells

47

causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can

48

result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently

49

no vaccines or antivirals approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of

50

SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human

51

airway epithelial cultures induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet

52

blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the

53

effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options

54

to treat COVID-19 patients.

INTRODUCTION

56

In December 2019, a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan,

57

China, causing an outbreak of severe respiratory disease (1, 2). In the span of several

58

months, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly escalated to a pandemic, with over 4 million infections

59

and 275,000 deaths worldwide (3). There are currently no vaccines or antivirals

60

approved for use in humans that can prevent or treat the infection. SARS-CoV-2

61

infection manifests as an upper and lower respiratory disease (named COVID-19 by the

62

World Health Organization), characterized by fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath.

63

SARS-CoV-2 targets lower respiratory tract cells, with one study finding 93% of their

64

patients’

65

Correspondingly, lung abnormalities have been observed in several patients with

66

COVID-19, and severe infection can lead to respiratory failure and lung tissue

67

destruction (5). Severe disease has also been associated with a low level of

68

lymphocytes in the blood and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6

69

and TNF-α (6). How the host innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection

70

is not well understood.

(4).

71
72

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29.8 kb in length and predicted to contain 12 open reading

73

frames. This includes 15 putative non-structural proteins, envelope and capsid genes,

74

an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), and a spike protein (7, 8). SARS-CoV-2

75

virus is closely related to the β-coronavirus SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of

76

acute respiratory distress syndrome in China in 2003 (9). β-coronaviruses use the spike

77

protein receptor-binding domain to gain entry to target cells, and recent studies have

78

found that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilize the same receptor, ACE-2 (10). SARS-

79

CoV-2 entry was also found to require the expression of the cellular protease,

80

TMPRSS2 (10). ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in epithelial tissue from the lung

81

and gut, with the highest expression in ciliated cells from the nasal cavity (11).

82

Consistently, previous studies have shown that SARS infects and replicates in primary

83

human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures isolated from the nasal and tracheobronchial

84

regions (12).

85
86

Type I IFN is the first line of defense and is critical for blocking early virus replication,

87

spread, and tropism as well as promoting the adaptive immune response. Type I IFN

88

induces a systemic response that impacts nearly every cell in the host, while type III

89

IFNs are restricted to anatomic barriers and select immune cells (13). This selectivity is

90

due to the receptor expression patterns: type I IFN binds IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which

91

are ubiquitously expressed. In contrast, type III IFN binds IFNLR1 and IL10-Rβ, which

92

are expressed preferentially on epithelial cells (13). Despite using different receptors,

93

Type I and III IFNs use similar downstream signaling complex (ISGF3) and induce

94

similar gene expression profiles. Type III IFN induces lower levels of ISG (interferon-

95

stimulated gene) expression, and at a slower rate than type I IFN (14, 15). Thus, type III

96

IFN produces a less inflammatory, localized response compared to type I IFN. The role

97

of type I and type III IFNs in restricting SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung epithelial cells has

98

not been studied.

100

In this study, we seek to address some of these unanswered questions about the innate

101

immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 infects and

102

replicates in pHAE cultures and is released exclusively from the apical surface. We

103

performed transcriptional profiling and found that infection triggers a robust

104

inflammatory cytokine response characterized by the induction of IL-6, CXCL8, TNF-α,

105

and IL-1 family cytokines. In contrast, we observed a lack of induction of type I IFN and

106

IFN-stimulated genes despite the expression of both type I and III IFN receptors. We

107

found that both pre- and post-treatment of pHAE cultures with type I or III IFNs reduced

108

SARS-CoV-2 replication and this was correlated with increased expression of IFN-

109

stimulated antiviral effector genes. Our studies demonstrate the utility of pHAE cultures

110

to model SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify type I and III IFNs as potential therapeutics

111

to restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients.

RESULTS

113

Human bronchial airway epithelial cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

114

To understand the response of airway epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we

115

utilized pHAE cultures isolated from the bronchial or tracheal region. These cells were

116

cultured using an air-liquid interface model to create a polarized, pseudostratified

117

epithelial layer. This culture system excellently re-capitulates the unique features of the

118

human respiratory tract, including mucus production and coordinated cilia movement

119

(16). pHAE cultures were infected on the apical side with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1

120

and 0.25 (as determined on VeroE6 cells). In our study, we used a low cell culture-

121

passaged and sequence-verified SARS-CoV-2 strain, nCoV2019/WA, which was

122

isolated in January 2020 from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens

123

collected three days post-symptom onset (17). Using two different measurements, we

124

demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures. On the apical

125

surface, we detected infectious SARS-CoV-2 beginning 24 hours post-infection (p.i.)

126

and increased through 48 hours p.i. as measured by plaque assay (Fig. 1A). In

127

contrast, we were unable to detect infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus on the basolateral side

128

at any timepoint or MOI, suggesting the directional release of the virus from pHAE

129

cultures. Next, we confirmed the presence of viral RNA in the cells by qRT-PCR with

130

primer/probes that anneal to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

131

(RDRP). We observed an increase in viral RNA between MOI 0.1 and 0.25 at 48 hours

132

p.i. (Fig. 1B). Combined, these findings demonstrate that pHAE cultures are permissive

133

for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

135

SARS-CoV-2 infection prompts a pro-inflammatory response in pHAE cultures.

136

We next evaluated the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end,

137

we performed bulk mRNA-sequencing analysis on differentiated pHAE cultures infected

138

with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI= 0.25) at 48 hours p.i. Following infection, we observed 1,039

139

differentially expressed genes (DEG) (P < 0.01; 1.5-fold change cut-off), with 458

140

upregulated (Fig. 2A in red) and 581 downregulated (Fig. 2A in blue) DEGs. We

141

detected viral transcripts spanning most of the viral genome, although there was minor

142

variation between the three replicates (Fig 2B).

143
144

Next, we investigated genes associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine

145

production and signaling. Several genes showed increased expression in SARS-CoV-2

146

infected cells as compared to mock-infected cells (Fig 3A; purple highlighted genes,

147

Supplementary Table 1). We then performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

148

using the Hallmarks data set from MSigDB. Compared to mock, SARS-CoV-2 infected

149

cells had significant enrichment for TNFα signaling, with a normalized enrichment score

150

(NES) of 1.53 and p-value < 0.0001, and IL-6-STAT3 related signaling (NES= 1.34, p<

151

0.04) (Fig. 3B). Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells had increased transcript

152

expression of IL-6, TNFα and other cytokine genes, including the IL-17 family (IL17C,

153

IL23A), and the IL-1 family (IL18, IL1B) (Fig. 3C). Several chemokines were also

154

upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, including molecules that promote monocyte

155

migration (CCL4, CCL5) and neutrophil migration (CXCL8, CXCL6). We also analyzed

156

genes associated with barrier immunity, which includes genes related to the production

157

of mucus and anti-microbial/-viral peptides (AMPs) (Fig. 3D; highlighted in orange).

158

While these genes are expressed in mock and infected cells, we observed little to no

159

change in gene expression and only a few genes approached threshold levels

160

(Supplementary Table 2). This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not alter mucus and

161

AMP production in pHAE cultures.

162
163

To determine the transcriptional regulatory network induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected

164

cells, we performed cis-regulatory sequence analysis using iRegulon to predict

165

regulatory nodes. iRegulon identifies enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs

166

within a DEG list (18). Consistent with pathway enrichment for pro-inflammatory

167

cytokines, our analysis identified NF-κB and ATF-4 as top predicted transcriptional

168

regulators following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3E). NF-κB regulates a substantial

169

portion of the DEGs, with a network of 312 DEGs. This network includes some of the

170

top upregulated genes, such as IL-6 and CXCL8. ATF-4 has a slightly smaller enriched

171

network of 219 DEGs, that includes CHAC1, which is a key marker of the unfolded

172

protein response (Fig. 3E; Supplementary Table 3) (19, 20). The identification of NF-

173

κB as a key transcriptional node is consistent with our observations that SARS-CoV-2

174

triggers cytokine induction. ATF-4 is associated with the promotion of a cellular stress

175

response. Thus, we used GSEA to investigate if ATF4 corresponds to an enrichment of

176

cellular stress pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (21). Compared to mock, SARS-

177

CoV-2 infected pHAE cultures showed an enrichment of genes related to the unfolded

178

protein response, such as ASNS, CHAC1, and STC2 (NES= 1.39, p-value< 0.0001)

179

(Fig. 3F). CEBP plays a critical role in maintaining epithelial barriers by regulating the

180

epithelial to mesenchymal transition (22). Accordingly, GSEA also revealed enrichment

181

of genes associated with the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal tissue (Fig. 3F).

182

Overall, the transcriptional profiling of infected pHAE cultures revealed that the normal

183

homeostatic functions are disrupted and they induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype

184

characterized by NF-κB signaling, ER stress response and IL-6 production.

185
186

SARS-CoV-2 does not induce IFN production or signaling in pHAE cultures. Viral

187

sensing by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) is a key initial step in responding to

188

viral infections. Activation of PRR pathway triggers a signaling cascade that induces

189

expression of type I IFN,

190

dependent stimulated genes. First, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 induces minimal

191

type I or III IFNs at the transcript level (Fig. 4A). In both mock and SARS-CoV-2

192

infected samples, there was no detectable IFNα of any subtype, and low induction of

193

IFNβ1 and IFNλ1, with normalized read counts less than 10 (Fig. 4A). Next, we

194

determined whether this was due to the lack of expression of molecules required for the

195

induction of IFN transcription, such as the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. We

196

found that several genes within this pathway, including RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, TRAF6,

197

IRF-3, and IRF-7 are expressed at baseline but show little to no induction in response to

198

SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4B; highlighted in green; Supplementary Table 4).

interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-dependent and IFN-

199
200

We observed little to no change in expression for several genes related to type I IFN

201

signaling, including transcription factors and antiviral effector genes, such as IFIT2,

202

IFIT3, IFITM1, OAS1 and MX1 (Fig. 4C-D; highlighted in pink; Supplementary Table

203

5). We next evaluated the expression of both the type I IFN (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and

204

type III IFN (IFNLR1 and IL10Rβ) receptors. At the transcript level, the type I and III IFN

205

receptors are present in pHAE cultures, but the expression of these receptors does not

206

change with infection (Fig. 4E). Combined, these data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2

207

infection does not induce a type I or III IFN response in pHAE cultures, but these cells

208

express the signaling components to respond to type I or III IFN signaling.

209
210

Pre-treatment with type I and type III IFN restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication. To

211

determine whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to type I and III IFNs, we pre-treated the

212

basolateral side of pHAE cultures with IFNβ1 or IFNλ1 (100 IU/mL) for 24 hours prior to

213

infection. The next day, pHAE cultures were infected on the apical side with SARS-CoV-

214

2 (Fig. 5A). As compared to untreated cells, we observed significantly reduced viral

215

RNA in type I (3-fold less) and III (3-fold less) IFN treated cells by 24 hours p.i. (Fig.

216

5B). We next evaluated infectious virus release and found that pHAE cultures pre-

217

treated with type I or III IFNs significantly reduced (14-fold and 12-fold respectively)

218

SARS-CoV-2 viral burden by 24 hours p.i., resulting in greater than 90% reduction in

219

virus replication as compared to untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Fig. 5C).

220
221

To better understand how type I and III IFN signaling promotes restriction of SARS-

222

CoV-2 replication, we performed qRT-PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected, treated

223

and untreated cells. Both type I and III IFN treatment upregulated ISGs in uninfected

224

and infected pHAE cells. This included innate immune sensors RIG-I and MDA5, and

225

the IFIT family of antiviral effector genes (Fig. 5D). Changes in transcription factors

226

were also observed with increases in IRF-7 and to a lesser extent IRF-1. Treatment with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.105437; this version posted May 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

227

type I and III IFNs upregulated ISGs regardless of infection status, but SARS-CoV-2

228

infected samples had larger fold changes compared to mock-infected cells. In SARS-

229

CoV-2 infected samples, treatment with type I IFN induced higher expression of certain

230

ISGs (IFIH1, IFIT2) than type III IFN (Fig. 5D). These findings demonstrate that pre-

231

treatment with type I or III IFN increases antiviral effector expression and restricts

232

SARS-CoV-2 infection of pHAE cultures.

233
234

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAE cultures with type I and III IFN reduces

235

viral burden. We next evaluated the antiviral potential of type I and III IFNs in a

236

therapeutic model of infection. In this case, pHAE cultures were infected with SARS-

237

CoV-2 (MOI= 0.5) and, at 24 hours p.i., we treated the basolateral side with IFNβ1 or

238

IFNλ1 (100 IU/mL). Infectious virus release was measured before and after treatment

239

(Fig. 6A). Twenty-four hours after treatment (48 hours p.i.) there was no significant

240

difference in viral burden between treatments. However, by 72 hours p.i., treatment with

241

both type I and III IFN had reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels 50-fold compared to

242

untreated samples, resulting in a 98% reduction in viral burden at 72 hours p.i. (Fig.

243

6A). Analysis of RNA at 72 hours p.i. confirmed that both IFNβ1 and IFNλ1 treatment

244

reduced viral RNA compared to untreated cells, 12-fold and 20-fold, respectively (Fig.

245

6B). Similarly, to our pre-treated samples (Fig. 5), treatment after infection with type I

246

or III IFNs upregulated ISGs, such as RIG-I, MDA5, and IFIT family members,

247

compared to untreated (Fig. 6C). Type I and III IFN increased expression of IRF

248

transcription factors, IRF-7 and IRF-1 compared to mock. Combined, therapeutic

treatment with type I or III IFNs was effective at reducing viral burden, and upregulating

252

DISCUSSION

253

In this study, we found that human pHAE cultures, which model the air-liquid interface of

254

the lung, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the virus is unilaterally released

255

from the apical surface. Transcriptional profiling revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infected

256

pHAE cultures trigger a pro-inflammatory response driven by ATF-4 and NF-κB. This

257

analysis also suggested that the normal cellular functions of pHAE cultures were

258

disrupted during SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evidenced by the enrichment of ER stress

259

pathways. Despite having a baseline expression of viral sensing pathway components,

260

pHAE cultures did not produce type I or III IFN in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

261

and there was little to no induction of antiviral effector genes. However, pHAE cultures

262

are sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFN, as pre-treatment with exogenous IFN

263

was able to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden significantly. Therapeutic administration of

264

type I and III IFNs was also effective at restricting viral replication, and induced

265

upregulation of ISGs in pHAE cultures. Thus, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 is

266

susceptible to both type I and type III IFN, and identifying them as potential antiviral

267

treatments.

268
269

The baseline expression of molecules such as RIG-I, MDA5, IRF-3 and IRF-7 in pHAE

270

cultures suggests that these cells are capable of producing type I and III IFN. In other

271

models of viral infection, pHAE cultures produce a robust IFN response (14, 23).

272

Previous studies with SARS-CoV, showed that it is able to block the production of type I

273

IFN, by inhibiting the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, and interfering

274

with STAT signaling (24-29). However, studies of both in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV

infection found that delayed production of type I IFN did occur eventually (30, 31).

276

Follow-up studies assessing whether SARS-CoV-2 uses similar mechanisms to block

277

type I and III IFN production will be essential for understanding viral antagonism of

278

innate immune signaling pathways during infection.

279
280

pHAE cultures did not produce IFN in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly,

281

SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to the effects of both type I and III IFNs, resulting in reduced

282

viral burden concomitant with an upregulation of ISGs. Lung epithelial cells are highly

283

polarized, and often have differential localization of receptors, such as ACE-2, on the

284

apical vs basolateral side (32). Thus, an interesting follow-up study would be to

285

compare the differential effects of cytokine application to the apical side. While the

286

reduction in viral load was similar between both IFNs, type I IFN was able to induce

287

higher expression than type III IFN (~ 2-fold) of most ISGs in pre-treated pHAE cultures.

288

However, in our post-treated samples, this difference disappeared. Studies of the

289

differential effect of type I and III IFN in other viral infection models have shown

290

differences in both magnitude and timing of ISG and IRF transcription factor expression.

291

Type I IFN responses often peak early then decline sharply, while type III IFN

292

responses take longer to initiate and are more sustained (14, 15). Detailed analysis of

293

the transcriptional response to type I and III IFNs noted these differences are driven

294

largely by IRF-1 (33). Correspondingly, we did see higher induction of IRF-1 in type I

295

IFN treated pHAE cultures compared to type III, during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus,

296

while type I and III IFNs have similar effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication, type III IFN

297

might have a more localized, less inflammatory effect on the immune response.

298

Dissecting the signaling pathways of type I and type III IFN could provide a clearer

299

understanding of the innate immune response in airway epithelial cells and inform the

300

application of these cytokines as therapeutics.

301
302

In response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, pHAE cultures primarily produced pro-

303

inflammatory cytokines, which will promote localized edema, fever, and the recruitment

304

of immune cells into the lung. Many of the cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection,

305

such as CXCL6, CXCL8 and CXCL5 are chemotactic factors that primarily recruit

306

neutrophils (34). However, the recruitment of neutrophils may be of limited use in

307

controlling SARS-CoV-2, as neutrophils are not particularly effective against intracellular

308

pathogens, and have been associated with poor prognosis in other models of

309

respiratory disease (35). Several cytokines primarily associated with a TH17 response

310

(IL-23, IL-17) were also highly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAE cultures.

311

While TH17 cells are important for barrier immunity, they are most potent against

312

extracellular pathogens, and have the potential to cause chronic inflammation (36). IL-6,

313

neutrophil infiltration, and TH17 immunity have all been previously implicated in the

314

development of fibrotic tissue in the lung (37). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAE

315

cultures were highly enriched in genes associated with the unfolded protein response

316

and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which are both pathways directly linked to

317

the formation of fibrotic tissue (38-40). The RNA-Seq data suggests that SARS-CoV-2

318

may be producing a sub-optimal immune response in pHAE cultures, as evidenced by a

319

preference for the production of cytokines whose primary function is in the defense

320

against extracellular pathogens, and the complete lack of type I and III IFN signaling.

321

Furthermore, this dysregulated immune response combined with an increase in ER

322

stress may be promoting the formation of fibrotic epithelial tissue during SARS-CoV-2

323

infection. Additional studies are needed to explore the specific role these cytokines play

324

during SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung, and their implications in the formation of

325

fibrotic tissue.

326
327

In this study, we characterized the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

328

using an in vitro model of the air-lung epithelial barrier. We found that pHAE cultures are

329

permissive to SARS-CoV-2, but mount a weak innate antiviral response, that is notably

330

lacking type I and III IFN production, signaling, and induction of ISGs. Instead, the

331

innate immune response signature of infected pHAEs is dominated by pro-inflammatory

332

cytokines and chemokines that will recruit neutrophils and monocytes. Most importantly,

333

therapeutic treatment of pHAE cultures with type I and III IFNs are able to reduce

334

SARS-CoV-2 viral burden. Overall, these data suggest that pHAE cultures mount a

335

misdirected innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the early

336

administration of type I or III IFN could potentially decrease virus replication and

337

disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

341

Viruses and cells. SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020) was isolated from the

342

first reported case in the US (17). A plaque purified passage 4 stock was kindly

343

provided by Dr. Natalie Thornburg (CDC, Atlanta, GA). Viral titers were determined by

344

plaque assay on VeroE6 cells (ATCC). Vero cells were cultured in complete DMEM

345

medium consisting of 1x DMEM (Corning Cellgro), 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES Buffer

346

(Corning Cellgro), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1x Non-essential Amino

347

Acids, and 1x antibiotics.

348
349

Quantification of infectious virus.

For plaque assays, 10-fold dilutions of viral

350

supernatant in serum-free DMEM (VWR, #45000-304) were overlaid on VeroE6

351

monolayers and adsorbed for 1 hour at 37°C. After adsorption, 0.8% Oxoid Agarose in

352

2X DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologics) and 5% sodium bicarbonate

353

was overlaid, and cultures were incubated for 72 hours at 37°C. Plaques were

354

visualized using crystal violet staining (70% methanol in ddH2O). For focus-forming

355

assays, 10-fold dilutions of viral supernatant on VeroE6 cells were incubated with a

356

methylcellulose overlay (1.0% methylcellulose in 2X DMEM) for 24 hours at 37°C.

357

Methylcellulose was then removed, cells were fixed with 2%-PFA and permeabilized

358

with 0.1% BSA-Saponin in PBS. Cells were incubated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike

359

protein primary antibody conjugated to biotin (generously provided by Dr. Jens

360

Wrammert, Emory University) for 2 hours at room temperature (RT), then with avidin-

361

HRP conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at RT. Foci were visualized using True

362

Blue HRP substrate and imaged on an ELI-SPOT reader.

364

Generation of pHAE cultures. pHAE cultures were kindly provided by Dr. C. U. Cotton

365

(Case Western Reserve University) and cultured, as described previously (16). Briefly,

366

after initial expansion in F media supplemented with ROCK inhibitor (Selleck Chemical

367

LLC), bronchial lung specimens were seeded on Transwell permeable support inserts

368

(Costar-Corning), cultured until confluent then transferred to an air/liquid interface.

369

Cultures were differentiated for 3 weeks and maintained in DMEM/Ham’s F12 media

370

differentiation media supplemented with 2% of Ultroser G (Pall Corp., France), until they

371

had TEER measurements greater than 1000 Ω and were deemed ready for use.

372
373

SARS-CoV-2 infection of pHAE cultures. Prior to infection, the apical side of the

374

pHAE cultures was washed 3 times with PBS. Virus was diluted to the specified MOI in

375

PBS and allowed to adsorb for 1 hour at 37°C. After adsorption, the apical side was

376

washed 3 times with PBS to remove excess virus, and the basolateral media was

377

changed. To collect viral supernatant, PBS was added to the apical side and incubated

378

for 30 minutes at 37°C. Treatment of pHAE cultures with type I or type III IFN was

379

performed by adding 100 IU/mL of human IFNβ or human IFNλ1 (PBL Assay Science).

380
381

RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. pHAE cultures were infected at MOI= 0.25 for

382

48 hours. RNA was harvested from mock and infected pHAE cultures (n=3) by gently

383

scraping the Transwell insert with a plunger to dislodge the cells, which were then lysed

384

by treatment with RNA lysis buffer for > 5 minutes. Total RNA was extracted using the

Figure 1. pHAE cultures are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A) Healthy,

604

differentiated pHAE cultures were infected by adsorption to the apical side at the

605

indicated MOI. The supernatant was collected from the apical or basolateral side of the

606

epithelial layer, and the virus was measured by plaque assay. B) Viral RNA was

607

measured by probing for the SARS-CoV-2 RDRP RNA at 48 hours p.i. by qRT-PCR. CT

608

values are represented as relative fold change over mock (log10). All experiments were

609

repeated twice with biological triplicates.
