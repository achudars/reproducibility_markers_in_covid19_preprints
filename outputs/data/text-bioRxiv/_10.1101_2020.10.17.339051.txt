Abstract

29

The visualization of viral pathogens in infected tissues is an invaluable tool to

30

understand spatial virus distribution, localization, and cell tropism in vivo. Commonly,

31

virus-infected tissues are analyzed using conventional immunohistochemistry in

32

paraffin-embedded thin sections. Here, we demonstrate the utility of volumetric three-

33

dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging using tissue optical clearing and light

34

sheet microscopy to investigate host-pathogen interactions of pandemic SARS-CoV-

35

2 in ferrets at a mesoscopic scale. The superior spatial context of large, intact

36

samples (> 150 mm3) allowed detailed quantification of interrelated parameters like

37

focus-to-focus distance or SARS-CoV-2-infected area, facilitating an in-depth

38

description of SARS-CoV-2 infection foci. Accordingly, we could confirm a

39

preferential infection of the ferret upper respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 and

40

emphasize a distinct focal infection pattern in nasal turbinates. Conclusively, we

41

present a proof-of-concept study for investigating critically important respiratory

42

pathogens in their spatial tissue morphology and demonstrate the first specific 3D

43

visualization of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

50

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with viral

51

pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1-4]. The virus was

52

subsequently designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

53

(SARS-CoV-2) [5] and identified to be the causative agent of COVID-19 (Coronavirus

54

disease 2019). Patients most commonly present with fever, cough, fatigue, and

55

dyspnea [6-9]. About one out of five patients develops severe disease [10,11]. The

56

outbreak was declared a “public health emergency of international concern” on

57

January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of October 12, 2020,

58

37,109,851 confirmed cases and 1,070,355 confirmed death were reported in 235

59

countries [12].

60

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive

61

polarity and has been classified as a member of the Coronaviridae family, genus

62

Betacoronavirus [5]. Including SARS-CoV-2, there are currently two alpha- and five

63

betacoronaviruses associated with human disease [13]. While most result in only mild

64

respiratory illness, the three zoonotic betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV [14], SARS-

65

CoV-2 [1-4], and MERS-CoV [15] (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus)

66

can cause severe respiratory disease. Bats presumably serve as natural reservoir for

67

both SARS-CoV [16,17] and MERS-CoV [18-20], whereas palm civets [21] and

68

dromedary camels [22] have been identified as the intermediate hosts for animal-

69

human transmission for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Viruses closely

70

related to SARS-CoV-2 have been found in bats [2] and Malayan pangolins [23,24]

71

but no direct transmission event or intermediate host species have been identified

72

thus far.

73

Over the course of the current pandemic, tremendous research efforts have been

74

undertaken to study the virus and its disease. Consequently, critical information on

75

the virus, e.g. receptor usage [25], and necessary research tools, including reverse

76

genetics systems [26,27], became rapidly available. Furthermore, a variety of animal

77

studies to investigate susceptibility and suitability as animal models have been

78

conducted in a number of animal species (reviewed in [28]): ferrets [29-31], hamsters

79

[32-34], cats [31,35], dogs [31], raccoon dogs [36], rabbits [37], transgenic mice [38-

80

40], pigs [30,31], cattle [41], monkeys [42-44], poultry [30,31,45], and fruit bats [30].

81

Within the respiratory tract, detection of viral antigen and RNA suggested a

82

preferential replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of ferrets

83

[29-31], whereas viral antigen was detected in both the URT und lower respiratory

84

tract (LRT) of Syrian hamsters [32,33]. In humans and non-human primates (NHPs),

85

viral antigen detection indicates virus replication in both the URT and LRT [42,46,47].

86

Thus far, almost all approaches to detect and image SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues

87

have been based on conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) of paraffin-embedded

88

thin sections. However, by omitting the spatial context, thin tissue sections of only

89

several micrometers in thickness bear the risk of incomplete or inaccurate

90

description, particularly for focal infections. Recent developments in the field of tissue

91

optical clearing (TOC) have facilitated the preservation of large intact tissue

92

structures by turning them optically transparent. This eliminates the need of physical

93

sectioning and allows acquisition of intact three-dimensional (3D) structures using

94

only optical sectioning, e.g. in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) (reviewed

95

in [48]). Lately, the opportunities and advantages of TOC for virus research have

96

been demonstrated in several studies [49-54]. While two approaches to 3D imaging

97

of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissue have been described recently [55,56], neither of

98

them is capable of direct visualization of SARS-CoV-2 infection via virus-specific

99

antigen staining.

100

In our study, we provide a first complete 3D overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the

101

ferret model. By staining for the viral nucleocapsid protein (SARS-CoV-2 N), we were

102

able to directly visualize and localize SARS-CoV-2-infected foci within large volumes

103

of the ferret respiratory tract. Direct visualization further allowed detailed description

104

of the foci in their spatial context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report

105

of specific 3D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the first report of 3D

106

visualization of respiratory virus infection in nasal turbinates using LSFM.

isolate 2019_nCoV Muc-IMB-1 [30]. Tissues were collected in 10% neutral-buffered

145

formalin and fixed for at least 21 days to ensure complete virus inactivation. In this

146

study, nasal conchae, trachea, and lung tissue samples from infected ferrets

147

euthanized on day 4 post-infection were analyzed.

148

Immunofluorescence staining of high-volume tissue sections

149

Large sections of respiratory tissues (≥ 150 mm3) were immunostained according to

150

a modified iDISCO protocol [50,58]. All incubation steps were conducted with slight

151

agitation and, if not indicated otherwise, at room temperature.

152

To this end, formaldehyde-fixed tissues were washed three times for at least 1 h

153

each in PBS. Nasal conchae were furthermore decalcified for 4-7 days in Formical-

154

2000™ (Statlab, USA). Samples were trimmed to the sizes and volumes described

155

above, and bleached overnight in 5% H2O2 in PBS at 4 °C. For permeabilization, the

156

tissue samples were first incubated twice for 3 h each with 0.2%Triton X-100/PBS at

157

37 °C and subsequently in 0.2% Triton X-100/20% DMSO/0.3 M glycine/PBS for 2

158

days at 37 °C. Following a blocking step with 6% normal donkey serum/0.2% Triton

159

X-100/10% DMSO/PBS for 2 days at 37 °C, primary antibodies were diluted in 3%

160

normal donkey serum/5% DMSO in PTwH (0.2% Tween-20 in PBS with 10 µg/mL

161

heparin) and applied for 4 days at 37 °C. Unbound antibody was removed by

162

washing the samples 4-5 times over the course of a day, leaving the final wash on

163

overnight. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% normal donkey serum/PTwH and

164

the samples were incubated for another 4 days at 37 °C. Washing was performed as

165

described for the primary antibody.

166

Ethyl cinnamate (ECi)-based tissue optical clearing

167

Immunostained tissue sections were cleared with an adjusted ECi-based protocol

168

[59]. All incubation steps were conducted with slight agitation.

169

The samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (30% [v/v], 50%, 70%, and

170

twice in 100%; each for ≥ 8 h at 4 °C, diluted in aqua ad iniectabilia, and pH-adjusted

171

to 9). Following a two-hour wash with n-hexane at room temperature [60], n-hexane

172

was gradually replaced with the clearing agent ECi and samples were incubated until

173

optically transparent.

175

Light sheet micrographs of optically clear and immunostained respiratory tissues from

176

SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets were acquired with a LaVision BioTec Ultramicroscope

177

II (LaVision, Germany). The microscope was equipped with an Olympus MVX-10

178

zoom body (magnification range: 0.63x – 6.3x, total magnification: 1.26x – 12.6x;

179

Olympus, Japan), an Olympus MVPLAPO 2x objective (NA = 0.5), a LaVision laser

180

module with four laser lines (488 nm, 561 nm, 639 nm, and 785 nm), and a Andor

181

Zyla 5.5 sCMOS Camera (Andor Technology, UK) with a pixel size of 6.5 µm2. To

182

visualize tissue morphology, non-specific autofluorescence was excited with the 488

183

nm laser. Excitation lines 561 nm and 639 nm were used to excite Alexa Fluor™ 568

184

and Alexa Fluor™ 647, respectively. Channels of a high-volume 3D image were

185

acquired sequentially with a z-step size of 2 µm, a light sheet width of 100%, and a

186

light sheet thickness of 3.89 µm (NA = 0.156). Acquisition was done with ImSpector

187

(v7.0.124.0).

188

Confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM)

189

Confocal images were acquired with a Leica DMI6000 TCS SP5 confocal laser-

190

scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with a 63x/1.40 oil

191

immersion HCX PL APO objective and a 40x/1.10 water immersion HC PL APO

192

objective. Fluorescence was recorded sequentially between lines with a pinhole

193

diameter of 1 Airy unit and z-step sizes of 0.35 µm. Acquisition was done with LAS

194

AF (v2.7.3.9723).

195

For high-resolution confocal laser-scanning analysis of cleared and immunostained

196

tissue samples, they were sectioned into 1-mm-thick slices using a stainless steel

197

tissue matrix (World Precision Instruments, UK). Tissue slices were then mounted in

198

3D-printed imaging containers as described before [50]. Tissue morphology was

199

reconstructed from non-specific tissue autofluorescence via excitation with a 405 nm

200

UV laser diode.

201

Image processing and analysis

202

Image visualization and analysis were performed with arivis Vision4D (v3.2). If

203

necessary, channels were background corrected. CLSM-acquired image stacks of

204

subsectioned volumetric tissue samples were denoised. To quantify relations

205

between SARS-CoV-2 infection foci, they were segmented. The shortest distances

206

between foci were measured using the segment operation “Distances”. To calculate

the area of SARS-CoV-2-infected tissue, surface areas of the segmented objects

were extracted and divided by two to account only for the surface of the object facing

209

outwards. Lookup tables of multicolor images were selected for maximum

accessibility.

211

Results

212

LSFM provides a unique insight into the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in

213

intact nasal turbinates. By combining LSFM with optically cleared samples of the

214

ferret respiratory tract (Figure 1A), we aimed to shed light on the infection

215

environment and spatial context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A commercially available

216

polyclonal serum (designated as #1), which has been used for SARS-CoV-2

217

detection by conventional IHC [30,42], and a mix of two monoclonal antibodies

218

(designated as #2) against SARS-CoV N were tested on virus-infected VeroE6 cells

219

and confirmed to be cross-reactive with SARS-CoV-2 N (Figure 1B). Following

220

immunostaining, ferret tissue samples, including the partly ossified nasal conchae,

221

were successfully turned optically transparent using a recently established ethyl

222

cinnamate (ECi)-based approach [59] (Figure 1C).

223

Full translucency of ferret nasal turbinates enabled LSFM acquisition of a > 200 mm3

224

(6.69 gigavoxels per channel; ∑ = 20.07 gigavoxels)-sized tissue sample (Figure 2A

225

and Supplementary Movie S1). While there were some unspecific signals detectable

226

in the SARS-CoV-2 N-stained sample (individual green or magenta spots), they could

227

be clearly distinguished from specific SARS-CoV-2 detection by the absence of

228

colocalization (white) of the signals from either antibody (Figure 2B and Figure S1).

229

Within the about 4-mm-thick URT sample (4 days post-infection), multiple

230

comparatively small SARS-CoV-2 infection hot spots were visualized (Figure 2B).

231

They were detected in both the Concha nasalis dorsalis (Figure 2B, ROIs [region of

232

interests] 1 & 2) and the Concha nasalis ventralis (Figure 2B, ROI 3). Overall, these

233

data provide the proof of concept for the feasibility of TOC-assisted LSFM analysis

234

for SARS-CoV-2.

235

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets is characterized

236

by an oligofocal infection pattern. To achieve a more in-depth analysis of the

237

individual SARS-CoV-2 infection foci, LSFM image stacks of infected areas were

238

acquired using a higher magnification (total magnification of 8x for Figure 3 vs. 1.26x

239

for Figure 2), thus, increasing image resolution while maintaining the complete spatial

240

context (Figure 3).

241

Virtually traveling through an image stack of the ROIs 1 & 2 from Figure 2, which was

242

acquired accordingly, corroborated the presence of three individual, well delimitable,

243

and distinguishable SARS-CoV-2 infection foci (Figure 3A, images 1 [filled-in

244

arrowhead], 5 [outlined arrowhead], and 7 [arrow]). A volumetric reconstruction of this

245

image stack was able to convey spatial relationships between the individual infection

246

spots (Figure 3B-D). Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 N detection was again confirmed by

247

colocalization of both independent antibody stainings (Figure 3B and C, right side).

248

Consequently, linear distances between foci and foci areas were quantified (Figure 4

249

and Table 1). This increased spatial context within the nasal turbinate sample is

250

further reinforced by the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 infection focus from Figure 3A7

251

(arrow) is buried deeper within the sample and cannot be seen from the frontal angle

252

in Figure 3B. However, either by virtually clipping the sample as indicated (Figure 3B

253

and C, red square) or using 3D rendering to virtually “fly through the sample”

254

(Supplementary Movie S2), the infection site can be visualized. Taken together, this

255

emphasizes the system’s flexibility to switch from broad, mesoscopic overviews to

256

detailed, resolved close-ups. By maintaining the full infection environment, we were

257

able to establish quantifiable relations between the individual SARS-CoV-2 foci and

258

highlight the oligofocal infection pattern of SARS-CoV-2 in the URT of ferrets.

the distance between the center of two foci or as the shortest possible distance

between the edges of two foci. The area affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection was

263

measured by calculating the surface area of the segmented objects and dividing the

264

resultant value by two, thus, only accounting for the surface facing outwards.

271

the optically cleared high-volume tissue sample to 1-mm thick slices using a tissue

272

matrix to achieve compatibility with the limited free working distances of CLSM

273

objectives (Figure 1A).

274

Using the spatio-morphological information on the distribution of SARS-CoV-2

275

infection foci obtained from LSFM analysis, high-resolution CLSM image stacks of a

276

SARS-CoV-2 infection focus in the Concha nasalis dorsalis (ROI 1 from Figure 2)

277

were acquired (Figure 5). Individual SARS-CoV-2-infected cells could be resolved,

278

demonstrating cytoplasmic SARS-CoV-2 N distribution in both ciliated and non-

279

ciliated cells (Figure 5B, arrows). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 N accumulated particularly at

280

the apical side of the ciliated cells. Overall, these data demonstrate the feasibility of

281

this correlated approach to dissect cell-specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection

282

in vivo at subcellular resolution.

283

SARS-CoV-2 detection in the LRT of ferrets. Previous studies demonstrated a

284

preferential replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the URT of ferrets [29-31]. To assess

285

whether comprehensive LSFM analysis may uncover previously undetected SARS-

286

CoV-2 infection foci in the LRT, we looked at optically cleared high-volume lung and

287

tracheal samples.

288

As before, some unspecific fluorescence signals could be seen in both lung (Figure

289

6) and tracheal tissue (Figure S2 and Supplementary Movie S3). At a first glance, no

290

specific SARS-CoV-2 infection foci could be identified. However, hidden within an

291

airway of the large lung tissue volume, a 172 µm by 102 µm-sized spot of colocalized

292

antibody signals was detected (Figure 6B and Supplementary Movie S4). Contrary to

293

the SARS-CoV-2 infection foci in the ferret nasal turbinates (Figures 2 and 3), the

294

signal was localized above the epithelial cell layer (Figure 6B, single plane). This

295

suggested detection of debris-associated antigen, which was mostly likely inhaled

296

from the URT. Overall, while we were able to detect an 8.6x10-5 mm3 (86,000 µm3)

297

spot of debris-associated antigen within a > 80 mm3 volume, we did not identify

298

additional sites of infection within the LRT of ferrets, which corroborates preferential

299

replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the URT of ferrets.

300

Discussion

301

While conventional immunohistochemistry studies have been used to assess the

302

presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in human and animal tissues [29-

303

33,42,46,47], none of them were able to provide a greater spatial context of the

304

infection site. By combining TOC with LSFM, we acquired large intact volumes of

305

SARS-CoV-2-infected respiratory tissues from ferrets (Figure 1). The direct 3D

306

visualization of virus infection via SARS-CoV-2 N staining established a

307

comprehensive and mesoscopic overview of the infection in its full spatial context

308

(Figures 2-6 and Supplementary Movies 1-4). Moreover, the determination of

309

morphological parameters, e.g. focus-to-focus distances or the area of virus-infected

310

tissue, not only allowed the characterization of individual SARS-CoV-2 infection foci

311

but also provided a first quantitative insight into virus distribution within the spatio-

312

morphological context of ferret nasal turbinates (Figure 4 and Table 1).

313

Here, we employed an ECi-based TOC approach [59] and adjusted it to visualize

314

immunostained SARS-CoV-2 infection in large tissue samples of the respiratory tract

315

of ferrets. While two 3D imaging approaches to SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung tissue

316

have been reported, they have an entirely different scope: as both represent virtual

317

histopathology strategies, they are meant to assess pathophysiology and associated

318

tissue damage, but inherently cannot map and visualize specific SARS-CoV-2

319

infection. For the first study, Eckermann et al. [55] developed and demonstrated the

320

utility of a phase contrast x-ray tomography concept to investigate unstained lung

321

tissue. The second study describes the use of fluorescent H&E-analog stains (TO-

322

PRO-3 for nuclear contrast and Eosin-Y for cytoplasmic/stromal contrast) to achieve

323

“3D pseudo-histological imaging” [56]. Consequently, our study constitutes the first

324

report of direct 3D visualization of SARS-CoV-2 infection via LSFM. While unspecific

325

antibody signals were detected for both the polyclonal serum and the monoclonal mix

326

directed against N of SARS-CoV, particularly on the outer surface of the tissue

327

blocks, specificity for SARS-CoV-2 was ensured via colocalization of either staining

328

(Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6) and absence of colocalization in naïve animals (Figure S1).

329

Further optimization of the immunostaining protocol or the availability of SARS-CoV-

330

2-specific antibodies will likely aid in reduction of background staining and

331

improvement of virus detection.

332

In addition to the specific 3D reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 infection within its spatio-

333

morphological environment, the implementation of quantitative image analysis

334

following accurate quantification of interrelated 3D parameters (Figure 4 and Table 1)

335

represents a pronounced advantage of 3D immunofluorescence imaging over

336

conventional IHC. To achieve a somewhat comparable yet more artifact-prone 3D

337

reconstruction from thin sections, exceedingly laborious and time-consuming image

338

registration pipelines following serial thin sectioning are necessary [61]. For instance,

339

the nasal turbinate section from Figures 2-4 alone would require processing of

340

around 800 sections (at 5 µm thickness), making it de facto impossible with 2D IHC.

341

When compared to previous studies [29-31], the spatial visualization of SARS-CoV-2

342

in the ferret respiratory tract confirmed preferential infection of the URT (Figures 2-4).

343

Furthermore, our data indicate and emphasize a distinct oligofocal infection pattern of

344

SARS-CoV-2 within nasal turbinates (Figures 2-4). Within a > 200 mm3 section of

345

nasal turbinate tissue, only four SARS-CoV-2 infection foci (with a combined volume

346

of 5.17x10-3 mm3) were detected, three of which accumulated in the Concha nasalis

347

dorsalis and exhibited a maximum linear distance of 1.3 mm to each other (Figure 4

348

and Table 1). It is important to note that tissues inevitably shrink during the fixation,

349

dehydration, and clearing process. For the EtOH-ECi-based TOC approach used

350

here, a 50% volume reduction, equaling to a change of about 20% in tissue

351

diameters, has been determined [59]. The limited degree of infection is particularly

352

interesting in view of the amounts of infectious virus and genome copies that can be

353

isolated from the URT of ferrets [29-31] and other animal species, like Syrian

354

hamsters [32-34] and rhesus macaques [42-44]. Clustering of SARS-CoV-2 infection

355

foci in narrow areas of the URT might also have implications for the likelihood of

356

isolation of infectious virus and the detection of viral RNA from nasal swabs in

357

comparison to nasal washes from ferrets and possibly other animal models.

358

Accordingly, a high degree of variation in viral copy numbers can be observed from

359

nose or throat swabs in comparison to bronchoalveolar lavages from SARS-CoV-212

360

infected rhesus macaques [42]. However, because of the proof-of-principle character

361

of our study and the limited availability of SARS-CoV-2-infected material, further

362

studies have to corroborate the clustering and focal infection pattern of SARS-CoV-2

363

in the URT.

364

Alongside complex quantitative 3D image analysis, volumetric imaging has the

365

potential to discover rare events, as demonstrated by the detection of cancer

366

metastases in sentinel lymph nodes, which had not been found via conventional IHC

367

[62]. While preferential replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the URT of ferrets has been

368

demonstrated via viral RNA and antigen detection [29-31], Kim et al. also detected

369

some SARS-CoV-2-positive cells in the LRT. This is in contrast to the two other ferret

370

susceptibility studies, which detected either no [31] or only low amounts [30] of viral

371

RNA in the LRT, but neither found any SARS-CoV-2 antigen at this location. It is

372

conceivable that scarce LRT infection had been overlooked in previous 2D IHC

373

studies because of the focal character of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tissue or that

374

the detected viral RNA originated from URT-derived aspirated material. Using this

375

high-volume imaging approach, we aimed to screen the tissue for rare SARS-CoV-2

376

infection foci in the LRT. While we did not detect any infection spots in tracheal tissue

377

(Figure S2), we did visualize an individual, only 86,000 µm3-sized SARS-CoV-2 N-

378

positive structure inside a lung airway (Figure 6B). However, spatial analysis

379

revealed that the signal, contrary to the SARS-CoV-2 infection foci in the nasal

380

turbinate epithelium (Figures 2 and 3), was detected above the airway epithelial

381

layer. This strongly suggested that the structure most likely represents aspirated

382

virus-containing debris as the result of localized cell or tissue damage at infected

383

URT sites. Accordingly, this example emphasizes the suitability of this volumetric 3D

384

LSFM approach to identify rare and highly localized pathogen-related events.

385

Ferrets are a standard model for human respiratory infection (reviewed in [63]).

386

However, they recapitulate only mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and do not develop

387

severe respiratory disease [11,29-31]. In contrast, both URT and LRT are strongly

388

affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters, including overt signs of

389

disease [32,33]. This is closer to human disease, where SARS-CoV-2 antigen is

390

found in the URT and LRT, as corroborated by the NHP model rhesus macaques [42-

391

44]. While this proof-of-principle study is focused on ferret samples, it may serve as

13

392

blueprint for further analyses in other animal models and even human clinical

393

samples.

394

Independent of sample origin, volumetric imaging of cleared samples enables

395

discovery and detection of rare infection events, as demonstrated earlier. This

396

facilitates the investigation of the involvement of other organs outside of the

397

respiratory tract in SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, viral antigen has been

398

detected in the intestine of ferrets [29], hamsters [32,33], and rhesus macaques [42].

399

While viral RNA has been detected in human clinical brain samples [64], infection of

400

cells of the central nervous system could thus far only be demonstrated

401

experimentally in 3D human brain organoids [65]. Except for genetically modified

402

mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [39], the presence

403

of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in animal or human brain samples has yet to be shown.

404

Previous studies with other viral pathogens demonstrated that volumetric 3D imaging

405

using TOC and LSFM is a highly valuable tool to assess the comprehensive

406

distribution of virus infection in vivo [49,52]. Additional immunostaining against tissue-

407

specific cell markers may further facilitate the investigation of the global SARS-CoV-2

408

cell tropism in affected tissues. Combining and correlating this with high-resolution

409

CLSM analysis of SARS-CoV-2 hot spots identified via LSFM has the potential to

410

dissect subcellular infection processes of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo with unparalleled

411

detail. These results form the basis for research on larger sample sizes of both

412

respiratory and non-respiratory tissues from SARS-CoV-2 animal models and human

413

clinical samples using volumetric 3D LSFM of immunostained and cleared tissues.

414

Overall, we demonstrate the proof of concept for the utility of volumetric 3D

415

immunofluorescence of critically important respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2

416

using TOC and LSFM. The ability to analyze interrelated morphological parameters,

417

like inter-foci distances and SARS-CoV-2-affected areas, and to put them into global

418

perspective to the spatial tissue morphology provides unprecedented insight into

419

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract of ferrets. In the future, this approach

420

will be a crucial tool to understand the mesoscopic scale of host-pathogen

421

interactions of SARS-CoV-2 but also other respiratory and non-respiratory

422

pathogens, including, for example, influenza A and henipaviruses.
