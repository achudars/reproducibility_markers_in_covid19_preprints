Summary
Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
report on an improved soluble ACE2, termed a “microbody” in which the ACE2
ectodomain is fused to Fc domain 3 of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. The protein is
smaller than previously described ACE2-Ig Fc fusion proteins and contains an H345A
mutation in the ACE2 catalytic active site that inactivates the enzyme without reducing its
affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. The disulfide-bonded ACE2 microbody protein
inhibited entry of lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus and live SARSCoV-2 with a potency 10-fold higher than unmodified soluble ACE2 and was active after
initial virus binding to the cell. The ACE2 microbody inhibited the entry of ACE2-specific
b coronaviruses and viruses with the high infectivity variant D614G spike. The ACE2
microbody may be a valuable therapeutic for COVID-19 that is active against SARS-CoV2 variants and future coronaviruses that may arise.

Introduction
As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to
spread worldwide, there is an urgent need for preventative vaccine and improved
therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19. The development of therapeutic agents that
block specific steps of the coronavirus replication cycle will be highly valuable both for
treatment and prophylaxis. Coronavirus replication consists of attachment, uncoating,
replication, translation, assembly and release, all of which are potential drug targets. Virus
entry is particularly advantageous because as the first step in virus replication, it spares
target cells from becoming infected and because drugs that block entry do not need to be
cell permeable as the targets are externally exposed. In SARS-CoV-2 entry, the virus
attaches to the target cell through the interaction of the spike glycoprotein (S) with its
receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li, 2015; Li et al., 2005; Li et al.,
2003), a plasma membrane protein carboxypeptidase that degrades angiotensin II to
angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)] a vasodilator that promotes sodium transport in the
regulation of cardiac function and blood pressure (Kuba et al., 2010; Riordan, 2003;
Tikellis and Thomas, 2012). ACE2 binding triggers S protein-mediated fusion of the viral
envelope with the cell plasma membrane or intracellular endosomal membranes. The S
protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide that is cleaved by the cellular protease furin
into S1 and S2 subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum and then further processed by
TMPRSS2 on target cells (Glowacka et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Matsuyama et
al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011). The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD)
which binds to ACE2 while S2 mediates virus-cell fusion (Belouzard et al., 2012; Fehr

and Perlman, 2015; Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012; Li et al., 2006; Shang et al.,
2020). Cells that express ACE2 are potential targets of the virus. These include cells in
the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines (Harmer et al., 2002; Ksiazek et al., 2003;
Leung et al., 2003).
The use of soluble receptors to prevent virus entry by competitively binding to viral
envelope glycoproteins was first explored for HIV-1 with soluble CD4. In early studies, a
soluble form of CD4 deleted for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was found
to block virus entry in vitro (Daar et al., 1990; Haim et al., 2009; Orloff et al., 1993;
Schenten et al., 1999; Sullivan et al., 1998). Fusion of the protein to an immunoglobulin
Fc region, termed an “immunoadhesin”, increased the avidity for gp120 by dimerizing the
protein and served to increase the half-life of the protein in vivo. An enhanced soluble
CD4-Ig containing a peptide derived from the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 was found to
potently block infection and to protect rhesus macaques from infection (Chiang et al.,
2012). The soluble receptor approach to blocking virus entry has been recently applied
to SARS-CoV-2 through the use of recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein (hrsACE2)
(Kuba et al., 2005; Monteil et al., 2020; Wysocki et al., 2010) or hrsACE2-IgG which
encodes soluble ACE2 and the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Case et
al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020; Qian and Hu, 2020) which were shown to inhibit of SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 entry in a mouse model. In phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials (Haschke
et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2017), the protein showed partial antiviral activity but short halflive. Addition of the Fc region increased the half-life of the protein in vivo. A potential
concern with the addition of the Ig Fc region is the possibility of enhancement, similar to

what occurs with antibody-dependent enhancement in which anti-spike protein antibody
attaches to Fc receptors on immune cells, facilitating infection rather than preventing it
(Eroshenko et al., 2020).
We report, here on a soluble human ACE2 “microbody” in which the ACE2
ectodomain is fused to domain 3 of immunoglobulin G heavy chain Fc region (IgG-CH3)
(Maute et al., 2015). The IgG-CH3 Fc domain served to dimerize the protein, increasing
its affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 S and decreasing the molecular mass of the protein. The
ACE2 microbody did not bind to cell surface Fc receptor, reducing any possibility of
infection enhancement. Mutation of the active site H345 to alanine in the ACE2 microbody
protein, a mutation that has been shown to inactivate ACE2 catalytic activity (Guy et al.,
2005), did not decrease its affinity for the S protein. The dimeric ACE2 microbody had
about 10-fold higher antiviral activity than soluble ACE2, which was also a dimer, and
high a higher affinity for virion binding. The ACE2 microbody blocked virus entry into
ACE2.293T cells that over-expressed ACE2 as well as all of the cell-lines tested and was
fully active against the D614G variant spike protein and a panel of b coronavirus spike
proteins.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 Δ19 S protein was incorporated in pseudotyped virion and had higher
infectivity.
As a means to study SARS-CoV-2 entry, we developed an assay based on SARS-CoV2 S protein pseudotyped lentiviral reporter viruses. The viruses package a lentiviral vector
genome that encodes nanoluciferase and GFP separated by a P2A self-processing
peptide, providing a convenient means to titer the virus, and the ability to use two different
assays to measure infection. To pseudotype the virions, we constructed expression
vectors for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S and for a Δ19 variant deleted for the carboxyterminal 19 amino acids that removes a reported endoplasmic reticulum retention
sequence that blocks transit of the S protein to the cell surface (Giroglou et al., 2004)
(Figure 1A). The vectors were constructed with or without a carboxy-terminal
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. Pseudotyped viruses were produced in 293T cells

and Δ19 S proteins were expressed and processed into the cleaved S2 protein (S1 is not
visible as it lacks an epitope tag). Analysis of the virions showed that the Δ19 S protein
was packaged into virions at >20-fold higher levels than the full-length protein (Figure
1B). This difference was not the result of differences in virion production as similar
amounts of virion p24 were present in the cell supernatant. Analysis of the transfected

293T cells by flow cytometry showed a minor increase in the amount of cell surface Δ19
S protein as compared to full-length (Figure 1C) suggesting that deletion of the
endoplasmic reticulum retention signal was not the primary cause of the increased virion
packaging of the Δ19 S protein and may result from an inhibitory effect of the S protein
cytoplasmic tail on virion incorporation. As a suitable target cell-line, we established a
clonal, stably transfected 293T cell-line that expressed high levels of ACE2 (Figures 1D
and S1). A comparison of the infectivity of the viruses on ACE2.293T cells showed that
the Δ19 S protein pseudotype was about 2.5-fold more infectious than the full-length S
protein pseudotype (Figure 1E). The HA-tag had no effect on infectivity and the
nevirapine control demonstrated that the luciferase activity was the result of bona fide
infection and not carried-over luciferase in the virus-containing supernatant.
To determine the cell-type tropism of the pseudotyped virus, we tested several
standard laboratory cell-lines for susceptibility to infection to the Δ19 S protein
pseudotyped virus. The VSV-G pseudotype, which has very high infectivity on most celltypes was tested for comparison and virus lacking a glycoprotein was included to control
for potential receptor-independent virus uptake. The results showed high infectivity of the
Δ19 S protein pseudotyped virus on ACE2.293T cells, intermediate infectivity on 293T,
Vero, Vero E6, A549, ACE2.A549, CaCO2 and Huh7 and low infectivity on A549,
CHME3, BHK and U937 (Figure 1F). Analysis by flow cytometry of cell surface ACE2
levels showed high level expression on ACE2.293T, intermediate levels expression on
ACE2.A549 and low to undetectable levels on A549, CaCO2 and Huh7 (Figure S1). The
low level of ACE2 expression on cells such as Vero and CaCO2 suggests that virus can

use very small amounts of the receptor for entry. Moreover, the pseudotyped virus is a
highly sensitive means with which to detect virus entry.

An ACE2 microbody potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated virus entry.
Soluble ACE2 and ACE2-Fc fusions have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Case et al., 2020; Kuba et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020; Qian and Hu,
2020; Wysocki et al., 2010). To increase the effectiveness of soluble ACE2 and improve
therapeutic potential, we generated an ACE2-“microbody” in which the ACE2 ectodomain
was fused to a single IgG CH3 domain of the IgG Fc region (Figure 2A). This domain
contains the disulfide bonding cysteine residues of the IgG Fc that are required to
dimerize the protein, which would serve to increase the ACE2 microbody avidity for ACE2.
To prevent potential unwanted effects of the protein on blood pressure due to the catalytic
activity of ACE2, we mutated H345, one of the key active site histidine residues of ACE2,
to alanine, a mutation that has been shown to block catalytic activity (Guy et al., 2005).
H345 lies underneath the S protein interaction site so was not predicted to interfere with
S protein binding (Figure 2B). For comparison, we constructed vector encoding soluble
ACE2 without the IgG CH3. The proteins were purified from transfected 293T cells and
purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography followed by size
exclusion chromatography (Figure S2). The oligomerization state of the proteins was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions. Under reducing
conditions, the ACE2 and ACE2.H345A microbody proteins and soluble ACE2 ran at the
130 kDa and 120 kDa, consistent with their calculated molecular mass (Figures 2C and

S2). Under nonreducing conditions, the ACE2 microbody and ACE2.H345A microbody
proteins ran at 250 kDa, consistent with dimers while the soluble ACE2 ran as a monomer
with a mass of 120 kDa (Figure 2C). Analysis of the proteins by size-exclusion

nondenaturing conditions showed all three proteins to have a molecular mass consistent
with dimers (Figure 2D). The mass of the ACE2 and ACE2.H345A microbody proteins
was 218 kDa and 230 kDa, respectively, while soluble ACE2 was 180 kDa. Taken
together, the results suggest that the ACE2 microbody proteins are disulfide-bonded
dimers while soluble ACE2 is a nondisulfide-bonded dimer.

ACE2 microbody binds to SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus.
To compare the relative ability of the soluble ACE2 proteins to virions that display the S
protein, we established a virion pull-down assay. Ni-NTA beads were incubated with a
serial dilution of the carboxy-terminal His-tagged soluble ACE2 proteins. Free spike
protein was removed and the beads were then incubated with a fixed amount of lentiviral
pseudotyped virions. Free virions were removed and the bound virions were quantified
by immunoblot analysis for virion p24 capsid protein. To confirm that virus binding to the
beads was specific for the bead-bound ACE2, control virions lacking the spike were
tested. The results showed that S protein pseudotyped virions bound to the beads while
virions that lacked the S protein failed to bind, confirming that the binding was specific
(Figure 3A). In addition, a high titer human serum from a recovered individual blocked
binding of the virions to the bead-bound ACE2 microbody (Figure S5). Analysis of the

soluble ACE2 and ACE2 microbody proteins that had bound to the beads showed that
similar amounts of each proteins had bound (Figure 3B). Immunoblot analysis of virion
binding to the bead-bound soluble ACE2 proteins showed that the wild-type and H345A
microbody proteins both bound to virions more efficiently than soluble ACE2 (Figure 3C)
and that the ACE2.H345A microbody bound more virions than the wild-type microbody
protein. This was unexpected as H345 does not lie in the interaction surface with the S
protein.

ACE2 microbody blocks SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus infection.
To determine the relative antiviral activity of soluble ACE2 and the ACE2 microbody
proteins, we tested their ability to block the infection SARS-CoV-2 Δ19 S protein
pseudotyped GFP/luciferase reporter virus. A fixed amount of pseudotyped reporter virus
was incubated with the ACE2 proteins and then used to infect ACE2.293T cells. After 2
days, luciferase activity and the number of GFP+ cells in the infected cultures were
analyzed. For comparison, a high titered recovered patient serum with a neutralizing titer
of 1:330 (figure S5) was also tested. The results showed that soluble ACE2 had moderate
inhibitory activity with an EC50 of 1.24 µg/ml. The ACE2 microbody was significantly more
potent, with an EC50 of 0.36 µg/ml and the ACE2.H345A microbody protein was
somewhat more potent than the wild-type ACE2 microbody with an EC50 of 0.15 µg/ml
(Figure 4A). Inhibition of infection by the soluble ACE2 proteins was comparable to
recovered patient serum although it is not possible to directly compare the two inhibitors
as the mass amount of anti-S protein antibody in the serum is not known. To confirm the

results, we analyzed the infected cells by flow cytometry to determine the number of
GFP+ cells. The inhibition curves were similar to the luciferase curves, confirming that
the ACE2 proteins had decreased the number of cells infected and did not simply reduce
expression of the reporter protein (Figure 4B, top). Representative images of the GFP+
cells provide visual confirmation of the results (Figure 4B, below). The inhibitory activity
of the soluble ACE2 proteins was specific for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as they did not
inhibit VSV-G pseudotyped virus (Figure 4C). The ACE2 microbody was somewhat more
active when tested on untransfected 293T that express low levels of ACE2 (Figure 4D).
To determine the ability of the ACE2 microbody proteins to block the replication of
live SARS-CoV-2, we used the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, icSARS-CoV-2mNG
that encodes an mNeonGreen reporter gene in ORF7 (Xie et al., 2020). Serially diluted
ACE2 microbody proteins were incubated with the virus and the mixture was then used
to infect ACE2.293T cells. The results showed that 1-0.125 µg of ACE2 microbody protein
blocked live virus replication (Figure 4E). Soluble ACE2 was less active; 1 µg of the
protein had a 50% antiviral effect and the activity was lost with 0.5 µg. The antiviral activity
of ACE2 proteins against live virus was similar to pseudotyped virus, except that in the
live virus assay, the wild-type and H345A microbodies were of similar potency.
In the experiments described above, the proteins were incubated with virus prior
to infection. To determine whether they would be active when at later time points, the
ACE2 proteins were tested in an “escape from inhibition” assay in which the soluble ACE2
and ACE2 microbody proteins were added to cells at the same time as virus or up to 6
hours post-infection. The results showed that addition of the microbody together with the

12

virus (t0) blocked the infection by 80%. Addition of the microbody 30 minutes postinfection maintained most of the antiviral effect, and even 2 hours post-infection the
inhibitor blocked 55% of the infection. At 4 hours post-infection, the ACE2 microbody
retained its blocking activity at 10 µg/ml but was less active with decreasing amounts of
inhibitor (Figure 5A). These results suggest that the ACE2 microbody is highly efficient
at neutralizing the virus when present before the virus has had a chance to bind to the
cell and that it maintains its ability to block infection when added together with the cells
and even 2 hours after the virus has been exposed to cells, a time which most of the virus
has not yet bound to the cell.
To determine whether the ACE2 microbody could prevent virus entry once the
virus bound to the cell, the virus was prebound by incubating it with cells for 1 hour at
22°C, the unbound virus was removed and the ACE2 microbody was added at increasing
time points. The results showed that removal of the unbound virus after 1 hour incubation
resulted in less infection as compared to when the virus was incubated with the cells for
4 hours, indicating that only a fraction of the virus had bound to cells. However, virus that
was bound could be blocked by the ACE2 microbody for another 30 minutes post-binding
(Figure 5B). The ability to block entry of the cell-bound virus suggests that virus binding
results from a small number of spike molecules binding to ACE2. Over the next 30-60
minutes, additional spike:ACE2 interactions form, escaping the ability of the ACE2
microbody to block virus entry. The results demonstrate that the ACE2 microbody is a
highly potent inhibitor of free virus and maintains its antiviral activity against virus newlybound to the cell.

ACE2 microbody blocks entry of virus with D614G mutant spike. A variant SARSCoV-2 containing a D614G point mutation in the S protein has been found to be circulating
in the human population with increasing prevalence (Daniloski et al., 2020;
Eaaswarkhanth et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The D614G mutation
was found to decrease shedding of the spike protein from the virus and to assume a
fusion-ready conformation, resulting in increased infectivity and most likely contributing
to its increasing prevalence. To determine the ability of the soluble ACE2 proteins to block
entry of virus with the D614G S protein, we introduced the mutation into the Δ19 S protein
expression vector and generated pseudotyped reporter viruses (Figure 6A). Analysis of
the infectivity of the D614G and wild-type pseudotyped viruses on the panel of cell-lines
showed that the mutation increased the infectivity of virus 2-4 fold on 293T, ACE2.293T,
Vero and VeroE6 cells, consistent with previous reports (Daniloski et al., 2020;
Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Infectivity of the mutated virus was also
increased in A549, ACE2.A549 CaCO2 although the overall infectivity of these cells was
low (Figure.6B). To determine the ability of the soluble ACE2 proteins to neutralize the
virus with the variant S protein, serial dilutions of the soluble ACE2 proteins were tested
for their ability to block wild-type and D614G S pseudotyped virus. The results showed
that soluble ACE2 had moderate antiviral activity against wild-type virus, while the wildtype and H345A microbody proteins were more potent (Figure 6C). The ACE2.H345A
microbody was somewhat more active at low concentrations than the wild-type protein.
To test the relative binding affinity of the soluble ACE2 proteins for wild-type and D614G

(Figure 6D). The results showed that virus with the D614G S bound efficiently to soluble
ACE2.

ACE2 microbody is effective against other b coronavirus S proteins. To determine
how well the ACE2 microbody would block the entry of other b coronaviruses, lentiviral
virions pseudotyped by S proteins from a panel of different lineage 2 b coronaviruses that
use ACE2 for entry (Letko and Munster, 2020) (pcSARS-CoV, pcSARS-CoV2, pcWIV1,
pcLYRa11, pcRs4231, pcRs4084 and pcSHC014) were generated. The pseudotypes
were incubated with soluble ACE2 and the ACE2 microbody proteins and their infectivity
was then measured on ACE2.293T cells. The analysis showed that the ACE2 and H345A
microbody proteins blocked all of the b coronavirus pseudotyped viruses while the
antiviral activity of soluble ACE2 was significantly diminished in comparison (Figure 7).
The results demonstrate the broad activity of the ACE2 microbody.

Discussion
We report the development of a soluble form of ACE2 in which the ectodomain of ACE2
is fused to a single domain of the IgG heavy chain Fc. The domain renders the protein
smaller than those fused to the full-length Fc yet retains the cysteine residues required
for dimerization and the ability to increase the in vivo half-life (Maute et al., 2015). The
microbody protein was shown to be a disulfide-bonded dimer in contrast to soluble ACE2
lacking the Fc domain which was dimeric but not nondisulfide-bonded. Although both
proteins are dimeric, the ACE2 microbody had about 10-fold more antiviral activity than
soluble ACE2 and bound to virions with a >4-fold increased affinity.
While high affinity anti-spike RBD monoclonal antibodies that potently inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection will be of great value in the treatment of COVID-19, the soluble
receptor proteins have advantageous features. The ACE2 microbody is of fully human
origin so should be relatively non-immunogenic. In addition, it is expected to be broadly
active against mutated variant spike proteins that may arise in the human population. The
microbody was fully active against virus with the D614G S protein, a variant of increasing
prevalence with increased infectivity in vitro (Figure 6) and was highly active against
ACE2-specific S proteins from other b coronaviruses. It has been previously shown that
a recombinant ACE2-Fc fusion had a major effect on blood pressure in a mouse model
(Liu et al., 2018). It was therefore important to inactivate ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity
in microbody to decrease unwanted effects on blood pressure associated with its use
therapeutically. The H345A mutation alters one of the histidine essential for ACE2
catalytic activity yet did not impair antiviral activity against SARS CoV-2 or other b

coronavirus spike proteins. In some of our analyses, the ACE2.H345A microbody
appeared to be more active than the wild-type protein although the significance of this
difference was unclear as the two proteins had similar activity in the live virus replication
assay.
Escape from inhibition studies provided insight into the kinetics of virus infection
and the mechanism of inhibition by the soluble receptors. Pretreatment of virus with the
ACE2 microbody potently neutralized the virus as did simultaneous treatment addition of
virus and microbody to cells. Furthermore, the protein retained its ability to prevent
infection even when added to the culture at times after addition of virus, blocking infection
by about 50% when added 1 hour after virus addition. The ACE2 microbody was partially
active even on virus that had already attached to the cell. When virus was pre-bound for
2 hours, a time at which about 10% of the infectious virus had bound the cell, the ACE2
microbody retained the ability to prevent infection of about 50% of the bound virus (Figure
5A). Taken together, the experiments suggest a series of events in which the virus binds
to cells over a period of about 4 hours. During this time, the ACE2 microbody is highly
efficient, neutralizing nearly all of the free virus. Once the virus binds to the cell, the ACE2
microbody retains its ability to block infection for about 30 min, suggesting that binding is
initially mediated by a small number of S proteins and that over 2 hours, additional S
proteins are recruited to interact with target cell ACE2, a period during which the ACE2
microbody remains able to block the viral fusion reaction. Once a sufficient number of S
protein:ACE2 interactions have formed, the virus escapes neutralization.

It was surprising that the ACE2 microbody had more antiviral activity than soluble
ACE2 as both proteins are dimeric. In addition, the ACE2 microbody protein showed
somewhat better binding to virions than soluble ACE2. The reasons for these differences
are not clear. It is possible that the disulfide bonds of the ACE2 microbody stabilize the
dimer or that they position the individual monomers in a more favorable conformation to
bind to the individual subunits of the S protein trimer. It is worth noting that in most of the
experiments, we used ACE2.293T cells that overexpress ACE2 compared to the cell-lines
tested. On untransfected 293T cells that express barely detectable levels of ACE2, the
antiviral activity of the microbody protein was increased, suggesting that the antiviral
activity of the ACE2 microbody may be under-estimated by the use of ACE2 overexpressing cells.
Recent reports have described similar soluble ACE2 proteins. Recently soluble
ACE2-related inhibitor including rhACE2 was shown to partially block infection (Case et
al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020) although the proteins had a short half-life
(Wysocki et al., 2010) (< 2 hours in mice), limiting their clinical usefulness. In contrast a
dimeric rhesus ACE2-Fc fusion protein had a half-life in mice in plasma greater than 1
week (Liu et al., 2018). The half-life of the ACE2 microbody in vivo has not yet been
tested, but the protein retained antiviral activity for several days in tissue culture,
significantly longer than longer than soluble ACE2 (Figure S3).
The phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement is caused by the
interaction of the Fc domain of non-neutralizing antibody with the Fc receptor on cells
which then serves to promote rather than inhibit virus neutralization. A similar

phenomenon is possible with receptor-Fc fusion proteins by interaction with Fc receptor
on cells. Because the ACE2 microbody contained only a single Fc domain, it was not
expected to interact with Fc receptor. To test whether this was the case, we tested the
ACE2 microbody in an enhancement assay using U937 cells which express Fc receptors.
The ACE2 microbody protein did not detectably bind to cells that express the Fc g receptor
and the cells did not become infected, suggesting that this mechanism is not likely to play
a role in vivo (Figure S4 and not shown).
Pseudotyped viruses have been highly useful for studies of SARS-CoV-2 entry.
Vectors for producing SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes have been developed by
several laboratories (Crawford et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Schmidt et
al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020). The vectors we report here produce
pseudotyped lentiviral viruses with very high infectivity. The high infectivity of the
pseudotypes produced is due in part to efficient expression of a codon-optimized Δ19 S
protein and the efficient virion incorporation that results from the cytoplasmic tail
truncation. The Δ19 S protein was present at only slightly higher levels on the cell surface
than the full-length protein, suggesting that this small increase does not fully account for
the large increase in virion incorporation. A possible explanation is that the full-length
cytoplasmic tail sterically hinders virion incorporation by conflicting with the underlying
viral matrix protein and that the deletion removes the conflict. Also, contributing to high
viral titers, is the use of separate Gag/Pol packaging vector and lentiviral transfer vector
as opposed to a lentiviral proviral DNA encoding Gag/Pol and the reporter gene, a
strategy that resulted in higher reporter gene expression as shown in a direct comparison

(not shown). Moreover, the dual luciferase/GFP reporter allows for measurement of
infectious virus titer by flow cytometry and the high sensitivity of nanoluciferase read-out.
The lentiviral pseudotypes are highly useful for rapidly titering neutralizing antibody in
patient serum. In a study of over 100 sera from recovering patients, we found that the
pseudotype assay results to be highly correlated with those of a live virus neutralization
assay (submitted).
A feature of soluble receptors is that because the virus spike protein needs to
conserve receptor binding affinity to maintain transmissibility, they should maintain their
ability to neutralize S protein variants. SARS-CoV-2 S variants have been found to be
circulating in the human population and it is likely that others are yet to emerge, some of
which may be less sensitive to neutralization by the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
currently under development. The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variant encoding the
D614G S protein has been found to be spreading with increased frequency in the human
population (Daniloski et al., 2020; Eaaswarkhanth et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Zhang
et al., 2020). The D614G S protein was found to be more resistant to shedding from the
virion and to adopt a conformation that favors ACE2-binding and is in a more fusioncompetent state (Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). We confirmed the
increased infectivity of virions and find that the D614G S protein has a higher affinity for
ACE2 as measured in a virion binding assay. Nevertheless, the ACE2 microbody
maintained its ability to neutralize D614G S protein pseudotyped virus. The ability of the
ACE2 microbody to neutralize diverse b coronaviruses suggest that it may also be able
to neutralize novel ACE2 using coronaviruses that may be transferred to the human

Methods
Plasmids.
The dual GFP/nanoluciferase lentiviral vector pLenti.GFP.NLuc was generated by overlap
extension PCR. A DNA fragment encoding GFP was amplified with a forward primer
containing a BamH-I site and a reverse primer encoding the P2A sequence. The
nanoluciferase gene (NLuc) was amplified with a forward primer encoding the P2A motif
and a reverse primer containing a 3’-Sal-I site. The amplicons were mixed and amplified
with the external primers. The fused amplicon was cleaved with BamH-I and Sal-I and
cloned into pLenti.CMV.GFP.puro (Addgene plasmid #17448, provided by Eric Campeau
and Paul Kaufman) (Campeau et al., 2009).
The SARS-CoV-2 S expression vector pcCOV2.S was chemically synthesized as
DNA fragments A and B encoding codon-optimized 5’ and 3’ halves, respectively, of the
S gene of Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 SARS-CoV-2 isolate (Table S2 and S3). Fragment A was
amplified with a forward primer containing a Kpn-I site and reverse primer containing an
EcoR-I site. The amplicon was cleaved with Kpn-I and EcoR-I and cloned into pcDNA6
(Invitrogen). Fragment B was amplified with a forward primer containing an EcoR-I site
and reverse primer containing Mlu-I and Xho-I sites. The amplicon was cleaved with
EcoR-I and Xho-I and cloned into pcDNA6. The cloned fragment A was then cleaved with
Mlu-I and Xho-I and cloned into the Mlu-I and Xho-I sites in the fragment B-containing
plasmid. To generate the SARS-CoV-2 S D19 expression vector pcCoV2.S.D19, the
codon-optimized S gene was amplified with a forward primer containing a Kpn-I site and
reverse primer that deleted the 19 carboxy-terminal amino acids and contained an Xho-I

site. The amplicon was cloned into the Kpn-I and Xho-I of pcDNA6. The D614G mutation
in S was generated by overlap extension PCR of the Δ19 S gene using internal primers
overlapping the sequence encoding D614G and cloned into pcDNA6. Beta coronavirus
spike expression vectors (Letko and Munster, 2020) (pcSARS-CoV, pcSARS-CoV2,
pcWIV1, pcLYRa11, pcRs4231, pcRs4084 and pcSHC014) were kindly provided by
Michael Letko and Vincent Munster (NIH).
ACE2 expressing lentiviral vector pLenti.ACE2 was generated by amplifying an
ACE2 cDNA (Origene) with a forward primer containing an Xba-I site and reverse primer
containing a Sal-I site. The amplicon was cleaved with Xba-I and Sal-I and cloned into
pLenti.CMV.GFP.puro in place of GFP. The soluble ACE2 expression vector pcsACE2
was generated by amplifying the extracellular domain of ACE2 with a forward primer
containing a Kpn-I site and reverse primer encoding an in-frame 8XHis-tag and Xho-I site.
The amplicon was then cloned into the Kpn-I and Xho-I sites of pcDNA6. The ACE2
microbody expression vector pcACE2-microbody was generated by overlap extension
PCR that fused the extracellular domain of ACE2 with human immunoglobulin G heavy
chain Fc domain 3 using a forward primer containing a Kpn-I site and reverse primer
containing an 8XHis-tag and Xho-1 site. The amplicon was cloned into the Kpn-I and XhoI sites of pcDNA6. Expression vector pcACE2.H345A-microbody that expressed the
ACE2.H345A microbody was generated by overlap extension PCR using primers that
overlapped the mutation. Full-length cDNA sequence, primer sequences and amino acid
sequences are shown in Tables S1-3.

Human sera.
Control and recovered patient sera were collected from patients through the NYU Vaccine
Center with written consent under I.R.B. approval (IRB 20-00595 and IRB 18-02037) and
were deidentified.

Cells.
Vero E6, CaCO2, A549, ACE2 A549, BHK, Huh7 293T, Vero and CHME3 cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) at 37°C in 5% CO2. CaCO2 cells
were cultured in DMEM/10% FBS/1% nonessential amino acids. U937 cells were cultured
in RPMI/10% FBS/ with P/S. ExpiCHO-S (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured in
ExpiCHO expression medium at 37 °C in 8% CO2. Cell-line ACE2 expression levels were
quantified by staining with anti-ACE2 antibody (NOVUS) and Alexa-fluor 594-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (Biolegend) and pacific blue viability dye. Data were analyzed by
flow cytometry with Flowjo software. ACE2.293T cells were established by lipofection of
293T cells with pLenti.ACE2-HA using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 2 days, the
cells were selected in 1 µg/ml puromycin and cloned at limiting dilution. Single cell clones
were expanded and analyzed by flow cytometry and a single clone was chosen.

293T cells (4 X 106) with pMDL, pLenti.GFP-NLuc, S protein expression vector and
pRSV.Rev at a mass ratio of 4:3:4:1 by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. S protein
expression vectors used were pcCoV2.S, pcCoV2.S-D19 or the b coronavirus RBD
expression vectors. Control viruses were produced substituting the S protein vector for
pcVSV or with pcDNA6 to produce virus lacking S protein. Virus-containing supernatant
was harvested 2 days post-transfection, passed through a 0.45 µm filter and concentrated
by ultracentrifugation over a 20% sucrose cushion at 30,000 RPM for 90 min in an
SW40.1 rotor in a Beckman Optima L-100K ultracentrifuge (Brea, CA). The pellet was
resuspended to 1/10 the initial volume in DMEM/10% FBS and frozen in aliquots at -80°C.
Virus stocks were titered on 293T by flow cytometry and for luciferase activity. The p24
concentration was measured and the virus was used at a concentration of 1.0 µg/ml. To
test the inhibitory activity of soluble receptors and convalescent sera, 50 µl serially diluted
inhibitor or convalescent patient serum was incubated for 30 min at room temperature
with 5 µl pseudotyped reporter virus (approximately 5 X 106 cps luciferase activity/µl) at
a MOI of 0.1 in a volume of 100 µl. The mixture was added to ACE2.293T cells in a 96
well tissue culture dish containing 1 X 104 cells/well. After 2 days, the culture medium was
removed and 50 µls Nano-Glo luciferase substrate (Promega) and 50 µls medium was
added to each well. The supernatant (70 µls) was transferred to a microtiter plate and the
luminescence was read in an Envision 2103 microplate luminometer (PerkinElmer).
Alternatively, the GFP+ cells were quantified by flow cytometry with pacific blue viability
dye to exclude dead cells (Biolegend).

Protein purification and molecular mass determination.
293F cells (Thermo Fisher) at a density of 2.5 X 106 cells/ml were transfected with
microbody expression vector plasmid DNA using polyethyleneimine (Polysciences, Inc)
at a 1:3 plasmid:PEI ratio. The cells were then cultured at 30°C and at 12 hours posttransfection 10 mM sodium butyrate was added. After 4 days, the supernatant culture
medium was collected, filtered and adjusted pH to 8.0. The medium was passed over a
5 ml HiTrap Chelating column charged with nickel (GE healthcare), washed with 30 ml of
buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole and the bound protein
was eluted in buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. The eluate was concentrated to 1.0 ml
and loaded onto a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (GE healthcare) in running buffer
containing 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl. Protein containing fractions were pooled
and concentrated. The purified proteins were analyzed on a 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE
stained with Coomassie blue.
The absolute molecular masses of the purified protein complexes were
determined by SEC/MALs. The proteins were injected onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL
gel-filtration chromatography column equilibrated in sample buffer that was connected to
a Dawn Heleos II 18-angle light-scattering detector (Wyatt Technology), a dynamic lightscattering detector (DynaPro Nanostar; Wyatt Technology) and an Optilab t-rEX refractive
index detector (Wyatt Technology). The data were collected at 25°C at a flow rate of 0.5
ml/minute every second. The molecular mass of each protein was determined by analysis
with ASTRA 6 software.

Virion pull-down assay.
293T cells were transfected by lipofection with 4 µg pcACE2-microbody. At 72 hours posttransduction, 0.5 ml of culture supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose beads (QIAGEN). The beads were washed, and bound protein was eluted with
Laemmle loading buffer. The proteins were analyzed on an immunoblot probed with
mouse anti-6XHis antibody (Invitrogen) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The proteins were visualized
using luminescent substrate and scanned on a LI-COR Biosciences FC Imaging System
(LI-COR Biotechnology). Ratios were calculated as the His (spike) signal intensity divided
by the p24 signal intensity for an identical exposure of the blot.

Immunoblot analysis.
Transfected cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM
EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentration in the lysates
was measured by bicinchoninic protein assay and the lysates (40 µg) were separated by
SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and
probed with anti-HA mAb (Covance), mouse anti-His mAb (Invitrogen) and anti-GAPDH
mAb (Life Technologies) followed by goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated second antibody
(Sigma). The blots were visualized using luminescent substrate (Millipore) on a LI-COR
Bio-sciences FC Imaging System.

Binding assay.
Soluble ACE2 proteins (10 µg) were mixed with 20 µl nickel beads for 1 hour at 4°C.
Unbound protein was removed by washing the beads with PBS.

The beads were

resuspended in PBS and mixed with 40 µl pseudotyped lentiviral virions After 1 h
incubation at 4°C, the beads were washed with PBS and resuspended in reducing
Laemmli loading buffer and heated to 90°C. The eluted proteins were separated by SDSPAGE and analyzed on an immunoblot probed with anti-p24 antibody (AG3.0) followed
by goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated second antibody.

Live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay.
mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (Xie et al., Cell Host and Microbe 2020) was obtained from
the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of
Texas Medical Branch. The virus was passaged once on Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL1586), clarified by low-speed centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C. The infectious
virus titer was determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells after staining with crystal
violet. Virus neutralization was determined as previously described (Xie et al, bioRxiv
2020). ACE2.293T cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 X 104/well). The next day,
mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.5) was mixed 1:1 with serially 2-fold diluted soluble
ACE2 protein in DMEM/2% FBS and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The virus:protein
mixture was then added to the ACE2 cells and incubated for 24 hours. at 37°C in 5%
CO2. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with DAPI and the

mNeonGreen+ cells were counted on a CellInsight CX5 Platform high content microscope
(Thermo Fisher).

Data analysis and statistics.
All experiments were performed in technical duplicates or triplicates and data were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism (Version 7 7.0e). Statistical significance was determined
by the two-tailed, unpaired t test. Significance was based on two-sided testing and
attributed to p< 0.05. Confidence intervals are shown as the mean ± SD or SEM. (*P≤
0.05, **P≤ 0.01, ***P≤0.001, ****P≤0.0001).
