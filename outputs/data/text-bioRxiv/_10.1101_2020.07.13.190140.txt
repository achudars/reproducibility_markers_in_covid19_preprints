Abstract
For yet unknown reasons, severely ill COVID-19 patients often become critically ill around the time of
activation of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that anti-Spike IgG from serum of severely ill COVID19 patients induces a hyper-inflammatory response by human macrophages, which subsequently
breaks pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induces microvascular thrombosis. The excessive
inflammatory capacity of this anti-Spike IgG is related to glycosylation changes in the IgG Fc tail.
Moreover, the hyper-inflammatory response induced by anti-Spike IgG can be specifically
counteracted in vitro by use of the active component of fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved
therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk.

Main text
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of patients(1,
2). However, approximately 20% of the cases have more severe disease outcomes, with bilateral
pneumonia that may rapidly deteriorate into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even
death by respiratory failure. With high numbers of people being infected worldwide and very limited
treatments available, safe and effective therapies for the most severe cases of COVID-19 are urgently
needed.
Remarkably, many of the COVID-19 patients with severe disease show a dramatic worsening of the
disease around 1-2 weeks after onset of symptoms(2, 3). This is suggested not to be a direct effect of
viral infection, but instead to be caused by over-activation of the immune system, particularly because
it coincides with the activation of adaptive immunity(2). This excessive immune response is frequently
described as a ‘cytokine storm’, characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines(3, 4).
Detailed assessment of the cytokine profile in severe cases of COVID-19 indicates that some cytokines
and chemokines are particularly elevated, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF(5-7). In contrast, type I and III
interferon (IFN) responses, which are critical for (early phase) anti-viral immunity, appear to be
suppressed(8). Combined, the high pro-inflammatory cytokines, known to induce collateral damage to
tissues, together with muted anti-viral responses, indicate a highly unfavorable immune response in
severe cases of COVID-19.
Previously, it has been shown that the virus leading to SARS, SARS-CoV, causes severe inflammation
and lung injury through IgG antibodies(9). Using a SARS-CoV macaque model, Liu et al. demonstrated
that the early emergence of anti-CoV Spike-protein IgGs induces severe lung injury by skewing
macrophage polarization away from wound-healing ‘M2’ characteristics towards a strong proinflammatory phenotype. Notably, SARS patients that eventually died from infection displayed similar
conversion of these wound-healing lung macrophages, as well as the early and high presence of
neutralizing IgG antibodies. The pro-inflammatory consequences of these IgGs could be suppressed by
Fc receptor (FcR) blockade. Very similar to SARS, severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by an
early rise and high titers of IgG antibodies(10-12) and show a similar conversion from anti- to proinflammatory lung macrophages(13). Combined, these data hint towards the involvement of anti-Spike
IgG in severe cases of COVID-19. Therefore, in this study we explored the hypothesis that, similar to
responses in SARS, anti-Spike antibodies drive excessive inflammation in severe cases of COVID-19.
We assessed the effect of anti-Spike antibodies from serum of critically ill COVID-19 patients on human
M2 macrophages. While different protocols are available for generating human M2 macrophages, our
previous transcriptional analyses demonstrated that an M-CSF and IL-10-induced monocyte
differentiation protocol generates cells that most closely resemble primary human lung
macrophages(14). Since activation of immune cells by IgG antibodies is known to require immune
complex formation by binding of IgG to its ligand(15, 16), we generated Spike-IgG immune complexes
by incubating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-coated wells with diluted serum from severely ill COVID-19 patients
(i.e. patients from the intensive care unit at the Amsterdam UMC) that tested positive for anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG. As shown in Figure 1A, stimulation with Spike protein alone did not induce cytokine
production, while Spike-IgG immune complexes elicited small amounts IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF, but very
high IL-8 production by human macrophages. Stimulation with the viral mimic PolyIC induced very little
cytokine secretion. Yet, since in the late phase of infection lung macrophages are simultaneously
exposed to viral stimuli and anti-Spike IgG immune complexes, we also assessed the effect of the
combination of these two stimuli. Strikingly, combined stimulation of anti-Spike IgG immune

complexes and PolyIC strongly amplified the production of COVID-19-associated pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF (Figure 1A). Induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also
increased, similar to what is observed in COVID-19 patients(17). To verify the relevance of our findings
for human lung macrophages, we assessed the response of primary alveolar macrophages that were
obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, which showed very similar responses (Figure 1B).
To assess whether this inflammatory response is really dependent on anti-Spike IgG antibodies, and
not on other inflammatory components in serum of critically ill patients, we compared the effect of
sera from 33 intensive care lung disease patients that either (1) did not have COVID-19, (2) had COVID19 but were still negative for anti-Spike IgG, or (3) had COVID-19 and were positive for anti-Spike IgG
(see Table S1 for details). While serum of non-COVID-19 patients and anti-Spike IgG-negative COVID19 patients showed no up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to individual PolyIC
stimulation, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF production was strongly amplified by serum of COVID-19 patients
with anti-Spike IgG (Figure 1C). Substantiating these findings, RNAseq analysis of macrophages
stimulated with sera from anti-Spike IgG positive COVID-19 patients also showed clear induction of a
pro-inflammatory gene program, as highlighted by induction of TNF, interleukins, chemokines, and
macrophage differentiation factors (Figure 1D). Interestingly, also IFN- and IFN- were induced by
anti-Spike positive serum, while the classical downstream interferon response gene CXCL10 was
reduced (Figure S1A and S1B), which may be related to reduced expression of IFN receptors (Figure
S1C).
In COVID-19 patients, high anti-Spike IgG titers are associated with disease severity(10, 12). To
determine whether anti-Spike titers correlate with higher cytokine responses by human macrophages,
we performed a principle component analysis (PCA) of the combined cytokine production data for all
samples, which upon overlaying with anti-Spike IgG titers (based on half maximal effective
concentration EC50) indeed indicated that the hyper-inflammatory response of macrophages was
associated with IgG titers (Figure 1E). This was subsequently confirmed by analyzing four serum
samples with different titers using serial-step dilutions (Figure 1F), which showed dose-dependent
induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 1G). Taken together, these data demonstrate that
anti-Spike IgG immune complexes generated from serum of severely ill COVID-19 patients induce a
strong pro-inflammatory response by (otherwise immunosuppressive) human M2 macrophages, which
is characterized by high production of classical cytokine storm mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and
TNF.
In addition to excessive lung inflammation through a cytokine storm, severe COVID-19 is characterized
by pulmonary edema, following disruption of the microvascular endothelium(18), and by
coagulopathy, which in many patients is characterized by pulmonary thrombosis(19). To test whether
the excessive macrophage activation by anti-Spike IgG may contribute to pulmonary edema and
thrombosis, we applied in vitro models for endothelial barrier integrity(20) and in situ thrombosis(21)
using primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC), where thrombocytes can be added
under flow conditions. While conditioned medium of macrophages that had been stimulated with only
PolyIC induced a transient drop in endothelial barrier integrity, co-stimulation of macrophages with
Spike protein and serum of severe COVID-19 patients induced long-lasting endothelial barrier
disruption (Figure 2A). In addition, during platelet perfusion we observed significantly increased
platelet adhesion to endothelium exposed to conditioned medium of macrophages that had been costimulated with Spike protein and serum (Figure 2B). This effect was paralleled by an increase in von
Willebrand Factor release from the endothelial cells (Figure 2C), indicative for an active pro-coagulant
state of the endothelium. These data indicate that anti-Spike IgG from severely ill COVID-19 patients

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.190140; this version posted July 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

does not only induce hyperinflammation by macrophages, but also may contribute to permeabilization
of pulmonary endothelium and microvascular thrombosis.
In addition to the anti-Spike antibodies from serum, we tested the effect of the recombinant anti-Spike
IgG COVA1-18, which we generated previously from B cells of COVID-19 patients(22). As previously
shown by others, the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in severe COVID-19 patients peaks at an
average of 16.5 μg/mL(23). To test the efficacy of our recombinant anti-Spike IgG, we stimulated
macrophages with anti-Spike immune complexes made with a high concentration (mimicking a serum
concentration of 100 μg/mL in our assay) of the recombinant antibody COVA1-18. Remarkably, the
high concentration of recombinant anti-Spike IgG immune complexes elicited substantially less IL-1β,
IL-6, and TNF than anti-Spike immune complexes made from COVID-19 serum (Figure 3A).
Interestingly, we did not observe this difference for the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10
(Figure 3A). These data suggest that the anti-Spike IgG in severe cases of COVID-19 patients is
intrinsically more pro-inflammatory than recombinant IgG. One of the key characteristics that
determines IgG pathogenicity is glycosylation of the IgG Fc tail at position 297(24, 25). Previously, we
and others have shown that anti-Spike IgG of severe COVID-19 patients has aberrant fucose and
galactose expression, both compared to the total IgG within these individual patients, as well as
compared to anti-Spike IgG from mild or asymptomatic patients(26, 27). For a subset of COVID-19
serum samples in the present study, the glycosylation pattern of anti-Spike IgG1 had been determined
previously for the study of Larsen et al.(26), which showed significantly decreased fucosylation and
increased galactosylation of anti-Spike IgG compared to total IgG within the tested patients (IgG
glycosylation of the sera used in this study is depicted in Figure S2A). When plotting the percentage of
anti-Spike IgG fucosylation against pro-inflammatory cytokine production, we observed an inverse
correlation for IgG fucosylation and production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF (Figure 3B), while this was not
seen for IL-8 and IL-10 (Figure S2B). To determine whether there is a causative role for these
glycosylation changes in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we compared cytokine induction
by regular COVA1-18, to modified COVA1-18 that had low fucose and high galactose (glycosylation
details in Table S2). Notably, COVA1-18 with low fucose and high galactose showed an increased
capacity for amplification of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 3C). These data indicate that antiSpike IgG from COVID-19 patients has an aberrant glycosylation pattern that makes these antibodies
intrinsically more inflammatory than ‘common’ IgGs by increasing its capacity to induce high amounts
of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Anti-Spike IgG from severely ill COVID-19 patients promoted inflammatory cytokines, endothelial
barrier disruption, and microvascular thrombosis, which are key phenomenon in severely ill COVID-19
patients that are thought to underlie the pathology. Hence, counteracting this antibody-induced
aberrant immune response could be of potential therapeutic interest. To determine how this antibodyinduced inflammation could be counteracted, we first set out to investigate which receptors on human
macrophages are activated by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immune complexes. IgG immune complexes
can be recognized by Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs), which includes FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII(16). As
shown in Figure 4A, the used human macrophage model highly expressed all FcγRs. To determine
whether FcγRs are involved in activation by anti-Spike immune complexes, we blocked the different
FcγRs with specific antibodies during stimulation, and analyzed cytokine production. As shown in
Figure 4B, all FcγRs contributed to anti-Spike-induced cytokine induction, but the most pronounced
inhibition was observed upon blockade of FcγRII. No inhibition was observed upon blocking of Fc alpha
receptor I (FcαRI), suggesting that IgA does not play a major role in the observed cytokine induction
(Figure 4B).

FcγRs are known to induce signaling that critically depends on the kinase Syk(28, 29). To determine
whether we could counteract anti-Spike-induced immune activation, we blocked Syk using R406, the
active component of the small molecule inhibitor fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved drug for
treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)(30). Strikingly, R406 almost completely blocked proinflammatory cytokine production induced by anti-Spike IgG from severe COVID-19 patients (Figure 4C
and D). Importantly, inhibition by R406 appeared to be specific, since it selectively blocked anti-Spike
induced amplification of cytokines, but did not substantially affect cytokine production induced by
PolyIC alone (Figure 4C).
To assess the effects of inhibition by fostamatinib in greater detail, we analyzed the effects of R406 on
macrophages stimulated with Spike, COVID-19 serum, and PolyIC by RNAseq. In total 4386 genes were
suppressed by R406 treatment, while 3976 genes were induced (FDR<0.05, Figure 4E). In the
downregulated genes many of the classical pro-inflammatory mediators were present, including TNF,
IL1B, IL6 and CCL2. Pathway analyses further showed no clear pathways in the upregulated genes,
while suppressed genes were clearly linked to inflammatory pathways (Figure S3A). Finally, gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that genes associated with several pro-inflammatory pathways
including IL-1 signaling and TNF production and response, were significantly downregulated by R406
(Figure 4F), while also response to type I IFN, Fc-gamma receptor signaling, glycolysis, and platelet
activation gene sets were suppressed (Figure S3B). These data demonstrate that the excessive
inflammatory response by anti-Spike IgG from severely ill COVID-19 patients can be counteracted by
the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib.
In conclusion, our data show that anti-Spike IgG from serum of severely ill COVID-19 patients
strongly amplifies pro-inflammatory responses by human macrophages, and can contribute to
subsequent endothelial barrier disruption and thrombosis. This may explain the observation that many
COVID-19 patients become critically ill around the time of activation of adaptive immune responses.
In general, antibodies are beneficial for host defense by providing various mechanisms to counteract
infections(31). These different effector functions of antibodies are modulated by antibody-intrinsic
characteristics, such as isotype, subclass, allotype, and glycosylation(24). In severely ill COVID-19
patients the glycosylation of anti-Spike IgG is changed, which we here show amplifies the IgG effector
function to promote pro-inflammatory cytokine production, of which COVID-19-associated cytokines
such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF(5, 32) are most pronounced. Decreased IgG fucosylation, as observed in
severe cases of COVID-19, has so far only been observed in patients infected with HIV and Dengue
virus(33, 34), but may actually be a general phenomenon in a response to enveloped viruses(26). While
decreased fucosylation increases the infection of cells by a process known as antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE)(35), there is little evidence for antibody-enhanced infection in COVID-19(36).
Instead, our data show that increased pathology by de-fucosylated IgG in COVID-19 patients most likely
results from excessive immune activation. The combination of decreased fucosylation and increased
galactosylation of IgG is known to particularly increase the affinity for FcγRIII(24). While we show that
FcγRIII was partially responsible for anti-Spike-induced inflammation, FcγRII contributed most,
indicating that collaboration between multiple FcγRs is required for the hyper-inflammatory responses
induced by the aberrant glycosylation of anti-Spike IgG. In addition to human alveolar macrophages,
these FcγRs are expressed by various other myeloid immune cells(15), but also by airway epithelial
cells(37), which are one of the main target cells of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and closely interact with
activated macrophages(38).
The observed hyper-inflammatory response induced by anti-Spike IgG from severe patients could be
specifically counteracted by the Syk inhibitor R406, the pro-drug of fostamatinib. Notably, fostamatinib

is an FDA and recently also EMA approved drug that is currently used for treatment of ITP(30), which
may facilitate repurposing for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. A very recent study indicates
that fostamatinib may also counteract acute lung injury by inhibiting Mucin-1 expression on epithelial
cells, suggesting that fostamatinib may target multiple pathways simultaneously(39). In addition to
fostamatinib, also other drugs that target key molecules in FcγR signaling could be efficacious to
counteract anti-Spike IgG-induced inflammation in COVID-19 patients. For example, the Sykdependent FcγR signaling pathway critically depends on the transcription factor IRF5(15, 28), which
can be targeted using cell penetrating peptides(40). Furthermore, FcγR stimulation is known to induce
metabolic reprogramming of human macrophages(28), which is also observed in COVID-19
patients(41), and therefore may provide additional targets for therapy. These findings may not only
be valuable to find new ways to treat the most severely ill COVID-19 patients, but may also have
implications for the therapeutic use of convalescent serum, for which it may be wise to omit the deglycosylated IgGs that are present in severely ill patients.

Supplementary Materials
Materials and Methods
Cells
Buffy coats from healthy anonymous donors were acquired from the Sanquin blood supply in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All the subjects provided written informed consent prior to donation to
Sanquin. Monocytes were isolated from the Buffy coats through density centrifugation using
Lymphoprep™ (Axis-Shield) followed by human CD14 magnetic beads purification with the MACS® cell
separation columns (Miltenyi) as previously described(14). The resulting monocytes were seeded on
tissue culture plates and subsequently differentiated to macrophages for 6 days in the presence of
50ng/mL human M-CSF (Miltenyi) with Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM, Lonza)
containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest) and 86µg/mL gentamicin (Gibco). The medium was
renewed on the third day. After 6-day differentiation, the medium was replaced by culture medium
without M-CSF and supplemented with 50 ng/mL IL10 (R&D) for 24 hours to generate alveolar
macrophage-like monocyte-derived macrophages. These macrophages were then detached with
TrypLE Select (Gibco) for further treatment and stimulation.
Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) were obtained from resected pulmonary artery tissue,
obtained from lobectomy surgery performed at Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical
Center, The Netherlands and isolated according to the previously published protocol(21). Briefly, the
endothelial cell layer was carefully scraped onto fibronectin-coated (5 µg/mL) culture dishes (Corning,
#3295), and maintained in culture in endothelial cell medium (ECM, ScienCell, #1001) supplemented
with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1% endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), 5% FBS, and 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA, Biowest, #X055-100). Cells were grown until passage 4-6 for experiments.
Primary macrophages were prepared from broncheo-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid that was obtained
as spare material from the ongoing DIVA study (Netherlands Trial Register: NL6318; AMC Medical
Ethical Committee approval number: 2014_294). The DIVA study includes healthy male volunteers
aged 18-35. In this study, the subjects are given a first hit of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and, two hours
later, a second hit of either fresh or aged platelet concentrate or NaCl 0.9%. Six hours after the second
hit, a BAL is performed by a trained pulmonologist according to national guidelines. Fractions 2-8 are
pooled and split in two, one half is centrifuged (4 °C, 1750g, 10 minutes), the cell pellet of which was
used in this research. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, subjects are also screened for SARS-CoV-2 (via
throat swab PCR) 2 days prior to the BAL. All subjects in the DIVA study have signed an informed
consent form. The amount of macrophages (80-85%) in the BAL was determined by counting the cells
that did not adhere to the plate after 30 minutes at 37°C. For our experiment complete cell pellet was
stimulated.
Coating
To mimic Spike protein specific immune complexes, 2µg/mL soluble prefusion-stabilized Spike proteins
of SARS-CoV-2 was coated overnight on a 96-well high-affinity plate (Nunc). Plate were blocked with
10% FCS in PBS for 1h at 37°C. Then diluted serum or 2 g/mL anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies
were added and incubated for 1h at 37°C. The Spike and anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody COVA118 were generated as described previously(22). Patient sera were provided by the Amsterdam UMC
COVID-19 Biobank based on a deferred consent procedure for the usage of materials and clinical
information for research purposes, approved by the medical ethics committees of Amsterdam
University Medical Centers (Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
The specific glyco-engineered antibodies were made from the potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibody COVA1-18 produced in 293F cells as previously described(22). Glyco-engineering tools were
used to alter N-linked glycosylation of the N297 glycan in the Fc domain and thereby generated several
COVA1-18 glycoforms(42). To decrease fucosylation of the N-linked glycan 0.2mM of the decoy

substrate for fucosylation, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-l-fucose (2FF) (Carbosynth, MD06089) was added one
hour prior to transfection. To produce a COVA1-18 variant with elevated galactosylation, 293F cells
were co-transfected (1% of total DNA) with a plasmid expressing Beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 1
(B4GALT1). In addition 5mM D-Galactose was added 1h before transfection. Antibodies were purified
with protein G affinity chromatography as previously described(22) and stored in PBS at 4°C . To
determine the glycosylation of COVA1-18, aliquots of the mAb samples (5µg) were subjected to acid
denaturation (100 mM formic acid, 5 minutes), followed by vacuum centrifugation. Subsequently,
samples were trypsinized, and Fc glycopeptides were measured as described previously(26). Relative
abundances of Fc glycopeptides were determined, and levels of bisection, fucosylation, galactosylation
and sialylation were determined as described before(26).
Stimulation
Cells (50,000/well) were stimulated in a pre-coated plates as described above in combination with 20
µg/mL PolyIC (Sigma-Aldrich). To block Syk, cells were pre-incubated with 0.5 μM R406 (Selleckchem)
or DMSO as a control, for 30 minutes at 37°C. To block the different FcRs, cells were pre-incubated
with 20 μg/mL of the following antibodies: (anti-FcyRI (CD64; 10.1; BD Bioscience); anti-FcyRIIa
(CD32a; IV.3; Stemcell Technologies); anti-FcyRIII (CD16; 3G8; BD Bioscience) and anti-FcαRI (CD89;
MIP8a; Abcam)) for 30 minutes at 4°C. Then media was added to get a final antibody concentration of
5 μg/mL.
Endothelial barrier function
PAEC passage 4-6 were seeded 1:1 in 0.1% gelatin coated 8-well (8W10E) or 96-well (96W10idf PET)
IBIDI culture slides for electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), as previously described(20).
Cells were maintained in culture in endothelial cell medium (ECM, ScienCell, #1001) supplemented
with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1% endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), 5% FBS and 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA, Biowest, #X055-100), with medium change every other day. From seeding
onwards, electrical impedance was measured at 4000Hz every 5 minutes. Cells were grown to
confluence and after 72h, ECM medium was removed and replaced by supernatant of alveolar
macrophage-like monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated for 6h as described above with PolyIC, or
in combination with patient serum. Within every experiment triplicate measurements were performed
for each condition. For every experiment PAECs and macrophages obtained from different donors
were used.
Platelet adhesion on PAEC under flow
PAECs were seeded in 0.1% gelatin coated µ-Slide VI 0.4 ibiTreat flow slides (ibidi, #80606) and cultured
for 7 days. PAECs were pre-incubated for 24h with supernatant of alveolar macrophage-like monocytederived macrophages stimulated for 6h as described above with PolyIC, or in combination with patients
serum before flow experiments were performed. On the day of perfusion, citrated blood was collected
from healthy volunteers and platelets were isolated as previously described(43). Platelets were
perfused for 5 minutes and phase-contrast and fluorescent images were taken with an Etaluma LS720
microscope using a 20X phase-contrast objective. Platelet adhesion was quantified in ImageJ by
determining the area covered by platelets per Field of View (FOV).
ELISA
To determine cytokine production, supernatants were harvested after 24h of stimulation and
cytokines were detected using the following antibody pairs: IL-1β and IL-6 (U-CyTech Biosciences); TNF
(eBioscience); and IL-8 (Invitrogen).
To determine the concentration of anti-Spike antibodies present in patients serum, Spike protein
was coating directly on 96-well plates at 5µg/mL overnight to determine serum binding using serial
dilutions as previously described(22).
To detect the VWF levels, flow supernatant was collected after perfusion and VWF levels were
measured with ELISA. An 96-well high affinity ELISA plate was coated with polyclonal anti-VWF (1:1000,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.190140; this version posted July 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Dako, #A0082) and blocked with 2% BSA. Samples were loaded and bound VWF was detected with
HRP-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-VWF (1:2500, Dako, #A0082). Normal plasma with a stock
concentration of 50 nM VWF (gifted from Sanquin) was used as a standard for determination of VWF
levels, measured at 450nm and 540nm.
Meso Scale Discovery multiplex assay
V-PLEX Custom Human Cytokine10-plex kits for Proinflammatory Panel1 and Chemokine Panel 1
(K151A0H-2, for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF, CCL2, CXCL10) and U-PLEX human Interferon Combo
SECTOR (K15094K-2, for IFN-α2a, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IFN-λ1) were purchased from Mesoscale Discovery
(MSD). The lyophilized cocktail mix calibrators for Proinflammatory Panel 1, Chemokine Panel 1, and 4
calibrators for U-PLEX Biomarker Group 1 (Calibrator 1 , 3, 6, 9) were reconstituted in provided assay
diluents respectively. U-PLEX plates were coating with supplied linkers and biotinylated capture
antibodies according to manufacturer’s instructions. Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in
supernatant collected at 24 hours after stimulation were detected with pre-coated V-PLEX while
interferons in 6-hour supernatant were measured by coated U-PLEX plates. The assays were performed
according to manufacturer’s protocol with overnight incubation of the diluted samples and standards
at 4°C. The electrochemiluminescence signal (ECL) were detected by MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 plate
reader (MSD) and analyzed with Discovery Workbench Software (v4.0, MSD). The concentration of
each sample was calculated based on the four-parameter logistic fitting model generated with the
standards (concentration was determined according to the certificate of analysis provided by MSD).
log10 values of measured level of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF, IFN-β, IFN-γ, CXCL10 were used for the
principle component analysis. log10 IgG titers (half maximal effective concentration, EC50) were used
for the color overlay.
RNA Sequencing
Cells were stimulated as described above and lysed after 6 hours. Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen) per the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA libraries
were prepared using the standard protocol of KAPA mRNA HyperPrep Kits (Roche) with input of 300ng
RNA per sample. Size-selected cDNA libraries were pooled and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 sequencer
(Illumina) to a depth of 16-20M per sample according to the 50 bp single-end protocol at the
Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location Vrije Universiteit medical center. Raw FASTQ files
were aligned to the human genome GRCh38 by STAR (v2.5.2b) with default settings(44). Indexed
Binary alignment map (BAM) files were generated and filtered on MAPQ>15 with SAMTools
(v1.3.1)(45). Raw tag counts and reads per kilo base million (RPKM) per gene were calculated using
HOMER2’s analyzeRepeats.pl script with default settings and the -noadj or -rpkm options for raw
counts and RPKM reporting(46) for further analyses.
Flow cytometry
After detachment, macrophages were stained with antibodies against Fc gamma receptors: FcγRI
(CD64; cat# 305014, Biolegend), FcγRII(CD32; cat# 555448, BD bioscience), and FcγRIII (CD16; cat#
562293, BD bioscience). Fluorescence was measured with CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer and analyzed with
FlowJo software version 7.6.5 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR). Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls
were used for each staining as negative controls.
Data availability
All data generated during this study are available within the paper. The RNAseq data were deposited
on Gene Expression Omnibus. Source data are provided with this paper.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of the data was performed in Graphpad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software).
Correlation analysis: for the fucosylation and cytokine correlation analysis, Pearson’s correlation was
performed for paired fucosylation percentage and measured cytokine concentration. For Fig. 1C and

Fig. S1B, statistics were made with Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA test and corrected by Dunnett
T3 test for multiple test correction (sample size: COVID19-: 2, COVID19+ anti-spike-: 4, COVID19+ antispike+: 27). For Fig. 2 an ordinary one-way ANOVA was performed and corrected for Tukey’s
comparisons test (Fig 2A) or Sidak’s multiple comparison test (Fig. 2B and C). For Fig. 4D and Fig. S2A
ratio paired t-test were used.
Functional analyses of transcriptomic data
All analyses were performed in the R statistical environment (v3.6.3). Differential expression was
assessed using the Bioconductor package edgeR (v3.28.1)(47). Lowly expressed genes were filtered
with the filterByExpr function and gene expression called differential with a false discovery rate (FDR)
<0.05. Pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the differentially regulated genes with an
absolute log2(fold change) higher than 1 using the Metascape (http://metascape.org/gp/index.htmL)
(48) on 2020-06-26. For heatmaps, normalized expression values (count per million, CPM) of each gene
were calculated and plotted using pheatmap (v1.0.12) with values scaled by gene. Gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) was performed with Bioconductor package fgsea (v1.12.0)(49) with genes ranked by
effect size (Cohen’s d) with respect to the “R406+serum+spike+PolyIC vs serum+spike+PolyIC” against
the curated gene sets obtained from gene ontology (GO) by Bioconductor package biomaRt
(v2.42.1)(50). A total of 5000 permutations were performed to estimate the empirical P values for the
gene sets. Normalized enrichment scores and the BH-adjusted P values were provided in the figure.

Table S1. COVID-19 patient characteristics. Ventilation indicates that these patients received mechanical ventilation. The numbers in the columns
of “Hospitalization” and “Sampling” indicate the days after onset of symptoms, which for some patients were unknown. IgG1 glycosylation
percentages indicate the glycosylation of anti-Spike IgG1 of these patients. Donors 18 and 30 were intensive care lung disease patients that did not
have COVID-19 (not included in this table). CCD: Chronic cardiac disease, including congenital heart disease (not hypertension). CPD: Chronic
pulmonary disease (not asthma). CKD: Chronic kidney disease. Liver dis.: Moderate or severe liver disease. CHD: Chronic hematologic disease.
