Abstract
Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia hit a major city of
China, Wuhan, December 2019 and subsequently reached other provinces/regions of China and countries. We
present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
Methods: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic
curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the
exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (Œ≥), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals
(SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true
unknown SI.
Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0
ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in
the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0.
Conclusion: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger
than 1. Our findings indicate the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks.

Introduction
The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported and confirmed
in Wuhan, China in December 31, 2019 [1]. As of January 26 (17:00 GMT), 2020, there have been 2033
confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 56 deaths [2]. The 2019-nCoV cases
were also reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all these cases
were exported from Wuhan, see WHO news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14-21. The
outbreak is still on-going. A recently published preprint by Imai et al. estimated that a total of 1723 (95%CI:
427-4471) cases of 2019-nCoV infections in Wuhan had onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 [3]. The
likelihood of travel related risks of disease spreading is suggested by [4], which indicates the potentials of
regional and global spread [5].
To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing peer-reviewed literature quantifying the transmissibility of
2019-nCoV as of January 22, 2020. In this study, we estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV via the
basic reproduction number, R0, based on the limited data in the early phase of the outbreak.

Methods
We obtained the number of 2019-nCoV cases time series data in mainland China released by Wuhan
Municipal Health Commission, China and National Health Commission of China from January 10 to January
24, 2020 from [6]. All cases were laboratory confirmed following the case definition by national health
commission of China [7]. Although the date of submission of this study is January 26, we choose to use data
up to January 24. Please note that the data of the most recent few days contain a number of infections that
were infected outside Wuhan due to travel, and thus this part of infections is excluded from the analysis.
Although there were cases confirmed on or before January 16, the official diagnostic protocol was released by
WHO on January 17 [8]. To adjust the impact of this event, we considered a time-varying reporting rate that
follows a linear increasing trend, motivated by the previous study [9]. We assumed that the reporting rate, r(t),
started increasing since January 17, and stopped at the maximal level at January 21. The time window of the
reporting rate increase accounts for the official report on improving the 2019-nCoV surveillance released by
the Chinese government by the end of January 21 [10], which also coincides with the average of the
incubation periods of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, i.e., the middle east respiratory syndrome
(MERS) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), i.e., 5 days [11-13]. Denoting the daily reported
number of new cases by c(t) for the t-th day, then the adjusted cumulative number of cases, C(t), is ùê∂(ùë°) =
‚àëùë°ùúè=0 ùëê(ùúè)/ùëü(ùúè). Instead of finding the exact value of r(t), we calculated the fold change in r(t) that is defined
by the ratio of r on January 10 over that on January 24 minus 1. We illustrated six scenarios with 0- (no
change), 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4- and 8-fold increase in reporting rate, see Fig 1(a), (c), (e), (g), (i) and (k).
Following previous studies [14, 15], we modelled the epidemic curve obeying the exponential growth. The
nonlinear least square (NLS) framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. The intrinsic
growth rate (Œ≥) of the exponential growth was estimated, and the basic reproduction number could be obtained
by R0 = 1/M(‚àíŒ≥) with 100% susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at this early stage. The function M(‚àô) is the Laplace
transform, i.e., the moment generating function, of the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) of the
disease [14, 16], denoted by h(k) and k is the mean SI. Since the transmission chain of 2019-nCoV remains
unclear, we adopted the SI information from SARS and MERS, which share the similar pathogen as 2019nCoV. We modelled h(k) as Gamma distributions with mean of 7.6 days and standard deviation (SD) of 3.4
days for MERS [17], and mean of 8.4 days and SD of 3.8 days for SARS [18] as well as their average, see the
row heads in Table 1 for each scenario.

Results and discussion
The exponential growth fitting results are shown in Fig 1(b), (d), (f), (h), (j) and (l). The coefficient of
determination, R-squared, ranges from 0.91 to 0.92 for all reporting rate changing scenarios, which implies
that the early outbreak data were largely following the exponential growth. In Table1, we estimated that the R0
ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 5.71 (95%CI: 4.24-7.54) associated with 8-fold to 0-fold increase in
the reporting rate. All R0 estimates are significantly larger than 1, which indicates the potential of 2019-nCoV
to cause outbreaks. Since the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on January 17 [8], an increase
in the diagnosis and reporting of 2019-nCoV infections probably occurred. Thereafter, the daily number of
newly reported cases started increasing around January 17, see Fig 1, which implies that more infections were
likely being diagnosed and recorded. We suggested that changing in reporting might exist, and thus it should
be considered in the estimation, i.e., 8-, 4- and 2-fold changes are more likely than no change in the reporting
efforts. Although six scenarios about the reporting rate were explored in this study, the real situation is
difficult to determine given limited data and (almost) equivalent model fitting performance in terms of Rsquared. However, with increasing reporting rate, we found the mean R0 is likely to be around 2 and 3.
Our analysis and estimation of R0 rely on the accuracy of the SI of 2019-nCoV, which remains unknown as of
January 25. In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV.
The determination of SI requires the knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs sufficient
number of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up [19], and thus this is unlikely to be achieved
shortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight to the
transmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early stage of the outbreak. We reported that the mean R0 of 2019nCoV is likely to be from 2.24 (8-fold) to 3.58 (2-fold), and it is largely in the range of those of SARS, i.e., 25 [11, 18, 20], and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 [12].
We note that WHO reported the basic reproduction number for the human-to-human (direct) transmission
ranged from 1.4 to 2.5 [21], which is marginally lower than ours. However, many of existing online preprints
estimate the mean R0 ranging from 2 to 5 [3, 22-24], which is largely consistent with our results.

Conclusion
We estimated the mean R0 of 2019-nCoV ranging from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89-4.39) if
the reporting effort has been increased by a factor of between 8- and 2-fold after the diagnostic protocol
released on January 17, 2020 and many medical supplies reached Wuhan.
