Abstract
COVID-19 currently represents a major public health problem. Multiple efforts are
being performed to control this disease. Vaccinations are already in progress. However,
no effective treatments have been found so far. The disease is caused by the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus that through the Spike protein interacts with its cell surface receptor
ACE2 to enter into the host cells. Therefore, compounds able to block this interaction
may help to stop disease progression. In this study, we have analyzed the effect of
compounds reported to interact and modify the activity of ACE2 on the binding of the
Spike protein. Among the compounds tested, we found that hydroxyzine could inhibit
the binding of the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein to ACE2 in a qualitative in
vitro assay. This finding supports the reported clinical data showing the benefits of
hydroxyzine on COVID-19 patients, raising the need for further investigation into its
effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 given its well-characterized medical
properties and affordable cost.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as the most severe pandemic
disease over the last decades (1). It has become a major public problem, collapsing
health care systems worldwide. Multiple efforts are being addressed to develop
strategies to control this disease. Thus, vaccines have recently been approved and
vaccinations have started (2). In contrast, although several potential treatments are being
investigated and even approved, their efficacy remains limited (3,4). Therefore,
continuing the investigation of COVID-19 treatments remains of great importance for
the management of this disease.
COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (1). Cellular infection is
facilitated by the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike
protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its receptor on the cell surface.
Therefore, compounds able to block the interaction of Spike with ACE2 may be useful
in preventing virus progression at the early stages of infection. In this regard, Kulemina
and Ostrov reported in 2011 the existence of several small known compounds that could
interact with ACE2 modifying its in vitro activity (5). Among them, hydroxyzine was
found to have a statistically significant effect on ACE2 efficiency. They proposed that
the binding of compounds to ACE2 could provoke conformational changes that would
affect angiotensin II binding. We hypothesized that the binding of hydroxyzine to ACE2
might also interfere with SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2. This idea may help to
understand the reported beneficial effect of hydroxyzine in this disease (6,7). To
investigate it, we analyzed the effect of hydroxyzine on an in vitro assay that
qualitatively determines the binding of recombinant Spike to ACE2.

Materials and Methods
Drugs: hydroxyzine, labetalol, and other compounds were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Binding assays: The RayBio COVID-19 spike-ACE2 binding assay (Cat: CovACE2S2) was obtained from RayBiotech, Inc. (Peachtree Corners, GA). This assay is a
qualitative method to characterize the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding
domain (RBD) to ACE2 in the presence of potential inhibitors The Binding assay
experiments were performed as indicated in the instruction manual. The binding of
RBD to ACE2 was determined in a Tescan spectrophotometer at 450 nm.

Hydroxyzine (empty bars) and Labetalol (dotted bars) were incubated with recombinant spike RBD
protein and added to a plate containing recombinant ACE2 as indicated in RayBiotec protocol. This is
representative of three different experiments.

We analyzed the effect of selected compounds on the binding of recombinant Spike
RBD protein to ACE2. To this end, the indicated amounts of drugs were mixed with
RBD and added to wells containing immobilized ACE2 protein. We found that
hydroxyzine inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein

(Figure 1). In contrast, labetalol, another drug reported to interact with ACE2 (5), did
not affect RBD/ACE2 interaction.
These results suggest that hydroxyzine could compete and interfere with the binding of
Spike RBD to ACE2. This was further supported by the fact that preincubation of ACE2
with hydroxyzine inhibited to a greater extent the posterior binding of RBD to ACE2
(Figure 2).

Figure 2. Hydroxyzine inhibits the binding of Spike RBD protein to bind ACE2. A plate containing
recombinant ACE2 was preincubated with the indicated amount of hydroxyzine overnight. Then,
hydroxyzine was washed out and the binding of spike RBD to ACE2 was determined as indicated in
RayBiotec protocol. This is representative of three different experiments.

Discussion
In this study, we have found that hydroxyzine competed and interfered with viral Spike protein
to bind ACE2 in an in vitro qualitative assay. These findings are in agreement with the
reported in vitro antiviral activity of hydroxyzine (6). Hydroxyzine and other antihistaminic
drugs have already been shown to have some beneficial effects in treating COVID-19 (6,7).
Thus, hydroxyzine has been reported to reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in older
people and the mortality in hospitalized patients (6,7). Although these effects may be explained
in part by its antihistaminic properties (7), our findings suggest an additional potential effect by
blocking the binding of Spike to ACE2. Hydroxyzine is one of the best known and prescribed

drugs among the first-generation antihistamines. Short-term use is generally well tolerated, with
the most frequent side effects being drowsiness and dry mouth. Taken together the mentioned
evidences, the efficacy of hydroxyzine as a treatment for COVID-19 would be worth further
investigation. Considering also that it is an affordable and well-characterized drug, it would
allow access to a large number of patients worldwide who may not have access to new and more
expensive drugs in development.
