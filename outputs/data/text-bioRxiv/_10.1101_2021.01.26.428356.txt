Abstract

27

Since the COVID-19 pandemic onset, the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 has been

28

extensively characterized. Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein

29

are frequently encoded by IGHV3-53/3-66 with a short CDR H3. Germline-encoded sequence

30

motifs in CDRs H1 and H2 play a major role, but whether any common motifs are present in CDR

31

H3, which is often critical for binding specificity, have not been elucidated. Here, we identify two

32

public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a 9-residue CDR H3 that pair with

33

different light chains. Distinct sequence motifs on CDR H3 are present in the two public clonotypes

34

that appear to be related to differential light chain pairing. Additionally, we show that Y58F is a

35

common somatic hypermutation that results in increased binding affinity of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD

36

antibodies with a short CDR H3. Overall, our results advance fundamental understanding of the

37

antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

39

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of

40

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1,2, which primarily results in respiratory distress, cardiac

41

failure, and renal injury in the most severe cases3,4. The virion is decorated with the spike (S)

42

glycoprotein, which contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that mediates virus entry by

43

binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor on the surface of host cells1,5-7. To

44

mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the pandemic, vaccines and post-

45

exposure prophylaxes including antibody cocktails that exploit reactivity to the S protein are being

46

developed at an unprecedented rate. Several vaccines are currently in various stages of clinical

47

trials8,9. Most notable are the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have

48

been issued emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration for distribution in

49

the United States10-12 and the Oxford-AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus vectored DNA vaccine

50

in the United Kingdom13-15. In humans, most neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 target the

51

immunodominant RBD on the S protein16,17, and can abrogate virus attachment and entry into

52

host cells18,19. In the past year, many RBD antibodies have been isolated and characterized from

53

convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients 20-40.

54
55

Antibody diversity is generated through V(D)J recombination41-43. Three genes, one from each of

56

the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) loci, are combined to form the coding region for the

57

heavy chain. In humans, genes encoding for the V, D and J regions are denoted as IGHV, IGHD

58

and IGHJ, respectively. Two complementarity-determining regions on the heavy chain (CDRs H1

59

and H2) are encoded by the V gene while the third (CDR H3) is encoded by the V(D)J junction. A

60

similar process occurs in assembly of the coding region for the light chain except that the D gene

61

is absent. The light chain genes also encode kappa and lambda chains that are denoted as IGKV

62

and IGKJ, as well as IGLV and IGLJ, respectively. To further improve affinity of antibodies to an

63

antigen, affinity maturation occurs via somatic hypermutation (SHM)44,45. V(D)J recombination and

64

SHM therefore ensure a diverse repertoire of antibodies is available for an immune response to

65

the enormous number and variety of potential antigens.

66
67

Notwithstanding this antibody diversity, some RBD antibodies with strikingly similar sequences

68

have been found in multiple convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients32,46,47. These antibodies can be

69

classified as public clonotypes if they share the same IGHV gene with similar CDR H3

70

sequences48-52. Over the past decade, public clonotypes to human immunodeficiency virus48,

71

malaria52, influenza49, and dengue virus53 have been discovered. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD

72

frequently use IGHV3-53 and IGHV3-6623,31,47,54, which only differ by one amino acid (i.e. I12 in

73

IGHV3-53 and V12 in IGHV3-66). IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies carry germline-encoded features

74

that are critical for RBD binding – an NY motif in CDR H1 and an SGGS motif in CDR H231,47,54.

75

Nevertheless, IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies have varying lengths of CDR H3 with diverse

76

sequences, which seem to deviate from the canonical definition of a public clonotype.

77
78

By categorizing IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies based on CDR H3 length and light chain usage,

79

we now report on two public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies, both of which have a

80

CDR H3 length of 9 amino acids but with distinct sequence motifs. Our structural and biochemical

81

analyses reveal that these sequence motifs on CDR H3 are associated with light chain pairing

82

preference. We also identify Y58F as a signature SHM among IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies

83

that have a CDR H3 length of less than 15 amino acids (Kabat numbering). As the COVID-19

84

pandemic continues, knowledge of public antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can inform on

85

therapeutic development as well as vaccine assessment.

89

In this study, we define clonotypic IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies as antibodies that share the

90

same IGL(K)V genes and with identical CDR H3 length. Literature mining of 214 published

91

IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies obtained from convalescent patients (Supplementary Table 1)

92

revealed that the two most common clonotypes have a CDR H3 length of 9 amino acids and are

93

paired with light chains IGKV1-9 (clonotype 1) and IGKV3-20 (clonotype 2), respectively (Figure

94

1a). Antibodies from clonotype 1 have been observed across 10 studies22-24,32-36,40, whereas

95

antibodies from clonotype 2 are found across seven studies22,24,32-34,37,40. Interestingly, sequence

96

logos revealed distinct sequence features of CDR H3 between clonotype 1 and clonotype 2

97

antibodies (Figure 1b).

98
99

We further determined IGHJ gene usage in the two major clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD

100

antibodies. Among the IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a CDR H3 length of 9 amino acids,

101

we observed a statistically significant bias in IGHJ gene usage (p-value = 2e-6, Fisher’s exact

102

test), where clonotypes 1 and 2 preferentially pair with IGHJ6 and IGHJ4, respectively (Figure

103

1c). In fact, IGHJ6 encodes the last four amino acids (GMDV) in CDR H3 that are highly conserved

104

in clonotype 1 (Figure 1d, Supplementary Figure 1a). Similarly, IGHJ4 encodes the last four amino

105

acids (YFDY) in CDR H3 that are highly conserved in clonotype 2 (Figure 1d, Supplementary

106

Figure 1b). Taken together, we demonstrate that IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies can be

107

categorized into at least two public clonotypes.

108
109

Structural analysis of signature motifs on CDR H3

110

We further investigated sequence signatures of CDR H3s in clonotypes 1 and 2 (Figure 1b). In

111

particular, we focused on amino acid residues 96, 98 and 100 in CDR H3 since these residues

112

show clear patterns of differential amino-acid preference between clonotype 1 and clonotype 2

113

antibodies. Subsequently, analysis was performed on structures of BD-604 (PDB 7CH4) and

114

CC12.1 (PDB 6XC2), which are two clonotype 1 antibodies, as well as BD-629 (PDB 7CH5) and

115

CC12.3 (PDB 6XC4), which are two clonotype 2 antibodies.

116
117

Residue 96 is usually Leu in clonotype 1 antibodies, while an aromatic residue, usually Tyr,

118

occupies residue 96 in clonotype 2 antibodies. While VH L96 interacts with Y489 of the RBD in

119

clonotype 1 antibodies via van der Waals interactions, VH F/Y96 is located at the center of a p-p

120

stacking network that involves F456, Y489 and VH Y100 (Figure 2a, 2b, Supplementary Figure

121

2a, 2b; left panels). Substituting VH L96 in clonotype 1 with Y96 would result in a clash with RBD

122

Y489, whereas substituting VH F/Y96 in clonotype 2 with L96 would abolish the p-p stacking

123

network but still maintain a hydrophobic core.

124
125

Residue 98 in CDR H3 of clonotype 1 antibodies does not show a strong amino-acid preference,

126

since it is located in a relatively open space (Figure 1b, 2a, Supplementary Figure 2a; middle

127

panels). On the other hand, a highly conserved acidic residue at position 98 in the CDR H3 loop

128

of clonotype 2 antibodies contributes to formation of hydrogen bond interactions with VH Y52 as

129

well as electrostatic interactions with RBD K417 and VL R96 (Figure 2b, Supplementary Figure

130

2b; middle panels). Consistently, VL R96 is highly conserved in clonotype 2 antibodies, but not in

131

other IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies (Supplementary Figure 3). Thus, the electrostatic

132

interactions between VH D/E98 and VL R98 are highly conserved in clonotype 2 antibodies and

133

can likely help stabilize the CDR H3 loop conformation to minimize entropic cost upon binding to

134

SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

135
136

Residue 100 is usually Gly in CDR H3 of clonotype 1 antibodies (Figure 1b). Structural analysis

137

shows that small, non-polar amino acids are favored at position 100 due to the limited space

138

around that residue (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 2a; right panels). Moreover, G100 in

139

clonotype 1 has a positive Φ angle, which is typically less favorable for non-Gly amino acids. In

140

contrast, residue 100 is a highly conserved Tyr in CDR H3 of clonotype 2 antibodies (Figure 1b).

141

Structural analysis shows that VH Y100 contributes to the p-p stacking network that is formed via

142

the aromatic ring at VH residue 96 (see above) and an aromatic residue at VL residue 49 (Figure

143

2b, Supplementary Figure 2b; right panels).

144
145

Additionally, we investigated the structural basis of the conservation of VH Y102 among clonotype

146

2 antibodies. Structural analysis reveals that VH Y102 interacts with RBD Y486 via p-p

147

interactions (Supplementary Figure 4). Only IGHJ4 offers a bulky aromatic side chain at residue

148

102 (Figure 1d), which explains the common usage of IGHJ4 in clonotype 2 antibodies. In

149

contrast, clonotype 1 antibodies frequently use IGHJ6 (Figure 1d), which has a much shorter Val

150

at residue 102, most likely because IGHJ6 encodes a Gly at residue 100 that can avoid steric

151

clashes with the light chain (see above, Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 2a; right panels). Of

152

note, the only other IGHJ gene that encodes a non-bulky amino acid at residue 100 is IGHJ3

153

(Ala). IGHJ1, IGHJ2, IGHJ4, and IGHJ5 all encode a bulky residue at residue 100 (Figure 1d),

154

which may be disfavored in clonotype 1 antibodies due to the limited space where VH residue 100

155

is located (Supplementary Figure 5). Overall, our structural analyses provide a structural basis for

156

the differential signature sequence motifs in CDR H3 between clonotype 1 and clonotype 2

157

antibodies.

158
159

Incompatibility of CDR H3 between clonotype 1 and clonotype 2 antibodies

160

To understand the influence of light-chain usage in CDR H3 sequences, we performed a structural

161

alignment of RBD-bound CDR H3 from two clonotype 1 antibodies, namely BD-604 and CC12.1,

162

and two clonotype 2 antibodies, namely BD-629 and CC12.3 (Supplementary Figures 2c-2f).

163

While the CDR H3 conformations are similar within each clonotype (RMSD ranges from 0.27 to

7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428356; this version posted January 27, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

164

0.41 Å), they are quite different between clonotypes (RMSD ranges from 0.77 Å to 1.5 Å).

165

Although our sample size is small, this analysis suggests that antibodies from clonotypes 1 and

166

2 have different preferences for their CDR H3 conformations. Such differential preference of CDR

167

H3 conformations may be partly influenced by light-chain usage, as indicated by the structural

168

analyses above on VH residues 96, 98, and 100 (Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 2 and 5).

169
170

To experimentally examine the compatibility between CDR H3 and the light chains from clonotype

171

1 and clonotype 2 antibodies, we focused on antibodies COV107-23 (clonotype 1) and COVD21-

172

C8 (clonotype 2). The heavy-chain sequences of these two antibodies only differ by four amino

173

acids in CDR H3, namely VH residues 96, 98, 99, and 100 (Supplementary Figure 6a). Of note,

174

COV107-23 uses IGHJ4, which is seldom observed among clonotype 1 antibodies but highly

175

preferred in clonotype 2 antibodies (Figure 1c), to encode the two amino acids at the C-terminus

176

of its CDR H3 (Supplementary Figure 6b). Both COV107-23 and COVD21-C8 bind strongly to the

177

SARS-CoV-2 RBD, with dissociation constants (KD) of 1 nM and 4 nM, respectively (Figure 3a).

178

However, when their light chains are swapped, their binding affinity to the RBD is weakened

179

substantially to KD > 1 μM. We further determined apo crystal structures of COV107-23 paired

180

with its native light chain and with the light chain from COVD21-C8 to 2.0 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively

181

(Supplementary Table 2). The conformations of CDR H3 indeed differ when paired with different

182

light chains, as exemplified by the 3.3 Å displacement of VH G97 near the tip of CDR H3 and

183

different side-chain orientations of VH T98 (Figure 3b). In addition, a type I’ β-turn is observed at

184

the tip of CDR H3 in COV107-23 when paired with its native light chain but not with the light chain

185

from COVD21-C8 (Figure 3c). These observations demonstrate that the conformation of CDR H3

186

changes substantially when IGKV1-9 in COV10-23 is swapped to IGKV3-20, which abolishes the

187

binding to RBD (Figure 3a). The CDR H3 conformation is therefore a determinant for compatibility

188

between the CDR H3 sequence and the light chain in IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies.

190

Compatibility of different CDR H3 variants with IGHV1-9 for binding to RBD

191

Besides antibodies from clonotypes 1 and 2, other IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a range

192

of CDR H3 lengths pair with different light chains (Figure 1a). We further aimed to expand our

193

analysis on CDR H3 compatibility to include CDR H3 from IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies other

194

than clonotypes 1 and 2. In particular, we focused on identifying CDR H3 sequences that are

195

compatible with IGKV1-9, which is used by clonotype 1 antibodies for binding to RBD. We first

196

compiled a list of 143 CDR H3 variants that were observed in IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies

197

(Supplementary Table 3). A yeast display library was then constructed with these 143 CDR H3

198

variants in the B38 antibody, which is a IGHV3-53/IGKV1-9 RBD antibody26. Subsequently,

199

fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on the yeast display library based on

200

antibody expression level and binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Supplementary Figures 7 and 8).

201

The enrichment level of each CDR H3 variant in the sorted library was quantified by next-

202

generation sequencing (see Methods, Supplementary Table 4). CDR H3 variants that were

203

positively enriched in binding (log10 enrichment > 0) are derived from both IGKV1-9 and non-

204

IGKV1-9 antibodies (Figure 4a). The native CDR H3 for B38 has a log10 enrichment level of -

205

0.002. As a result, positively enriched CDR H3 variants should have a higher affinity than wild-

206

type B38. A total of 68% (17 out of 25) binding-enriched CDR H3 variants have a length of 9

207

amino acids, whereas only 31% (37 out of 118) have a length of 9 amino acids in the non-enriched

208

group (Figure 4b). Interestingly, binding-enriched CDR H3 variants with a length of 9 amino acids

209

displayed very similar sequence features as that of clonotype 1 antibodies obtained from literature

210

mining (Figure 1b and 4c). Of note, 41% (7 out of 17) binding-enriched CDR H3 variants with a

211

length of 9 amino acids come from non-IGKV1-9 antibodies. Overall, our yeast display screen

212

indicates that certain CDR H3s from non-IGKV1-9 RBD antibodies are compatible with IGKV1-9

213

for RBD binding and have similar sequence features as those CDR H3s from clonotype 1

214

antibodies.

216

We noticed that some CDR H3 sequences that come from IGKV1-9 RBD antibodies do not enrich

217

in binding. One possibility is that they are still able to bind to RBD, but with a lower affinity than

218

B38, which has a KD of 70 nM to the RBD26. However, as shown by our yeast display screen,

219

CDR H3 sequences from IGKV1-9 antibodies in general have a significantly stronger binding to

220

RBD than those from non-IGKV1-9 antibodies (p-value = 0.002, Figure 4d), whereas their

221

expression level is only marginally higher than that from non-IGKV1-9 antibodies (p-value = 0.06,

222

Figure 4d).

223
224

Y58F is a signature SHM in IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies

225

We further aimed to understand if there are common SHMs among IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD

226

antibodies. We first categorized IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies from convalescent SARS-CoV-

227

2 patients by CDR H3 length. The occurrence frequencies of individual SHMs in each category

228

were then analyzed (Figure 5a). This analysis included 214 IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies that

229

have sequence information available. One clear observation is that Y58F is highly common

230

among IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a CDR H3 length of less than 15 amino acids, but

231

completely absent when the CDR H3 length is 15 amino acids or above, suggesting that Y58F

232

improves the binding of affinity IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies to RBD only when they have a short

233

CDR H3 loop (CDR H3 < 15 amino acids). To understand the effect of Y58F on the binding affinity

234

of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies to the RBD, we compared the binding affinity of the same antibodies

235

that carry either Y58 or F58 to the RBD. In particular, we focused on three IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD

236

antibodies that have a CDR H3 length of 9 amino acids – one in clonotype 1 (COV107-23), and

237

two in clonotype 2 (COVD21-C8 and CC12.3). Our BLI experiments showed that the Y58F

238

mutation dramatically improved the affinity of the three antibodies (COV107-23, COVD21-C8 and

239

CC12.3) by ~10-fold to ~1000-fold (Figure 5b, Supplementary Figure 9). As a control, we also

240

performed the same experiment on an IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody with a CDR H3 length of 15 amino

241

acids, namely COVA2-20. In contrast to those three IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a short

CDR H3, COVA2-20 shows similar binding affinity to RBD between Y58 and F58 variants (Figure

243

5b, Supplementary Figure 5). Taken together, our results show that Y58F appears to be a

244

signature SHM in IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with CDR H3 length of < 15 amino acids. In

245

fact, the results here are consistent with our previous finding that IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies

246

with CDR H3 length of 15 amino acids or longer adopt a different binding mode as compared to

247

those with a shorter CDR H354.

248
249

Interestingly, a Y58F mutation results in a loss of hydrogen bonding interactions between residue

250

58 of the heavy chain and T415 of the RBD (Supplementary Figure 10), yet the mutation

251

significantly increases the binding affinity of the antibody to the RBD. We then performed a

252

structural analysis on seven IGHV3-53/66 RBD antibodies with Y58F mutation and nine

253

without26,29,38,40,47,54-57. Our results indicate that, by removal of the hydroxyl group, the side chain

254

of Y58F moves closer to the backbone carbon of RBD T415 (Supplementary Figure 10). The

255

average distance between the centroid of the side-chain aromatic ring at VH residue 58 and the

256

backbone carbon of RBD T415 are 5.3 Å and 5.9 Å for antibodies that carry F58 and Y58,

257

respectively. Since T-shaped p-p stacking is optimal at around 5.0 to 5.2 Å58,59, F58 but not Y58

258

can form strong T-shaped p-p stacking interactions with the amide backbone of RBD T415. This

259

observation can at least partly explain why Y58F improves affinity despite the loss of a hydrogen

260

bond with the RBD.

Discussion

263

While several studies to date have described IGHV3-53/3-66 as a commonly used germline for

264

SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies23,31,47,54, the exact sequence requirements for generating an

265

IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody to SARS-CoV-2 RBD has remained largely elusive. As a result of

266

numerous efforts from multiple groups in isolating RBD antibodies and reporting their

11

267

sequences20-40, detailed characterization of RBD antibody sequence features has become

268

possible. Through sequence analysis, biophysical experiments, and high-throughput screening,

269

we identified distinct sequence requirements for two public clonotypes (clonotypes 1 and 2) of

270

IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies. In fact, the frequent occurrence of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD

271

antibodies with IGHJ6 and a CDR H3 length of 9 amino acids, which are germline features of

272

clonotype 1 antibodies, have also been reported in previous publications23,60.

273
274

One important finding in this study is that the CDR H3 sequence that supports IGHV3-53/3-66

275

antibodies binding to RBD is light chain-dependent. This finding is consistent with our previous

276

observation that there is a large diversity of CDR H3 sequences in IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD

277

antibodies54. In addition, our findings explain a recent observation by Banach and colleagues61

278

who showed that swapping the heavy and light chains of different IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies

279

often substantially reduced their neutralization potency. Therefore, IGHV3-53/3-66 provides a

280

robust framework to generate different public clonotypes that have distinct CDR H3 and light chain

281

sequence signatures. While only two major clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies are

282

examined in this study, it will be worth characterizing other minor clonotypes to obtain a more

283

complete understanding of the compatibility between CDR H3 sequence and light-chain identity

284

among IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies.

285
286

Although this study revealed that Y58F is a common SHM that improves the affinity of IGHV3-

287

53/3-66 antibodies with a short CDR H3 to RBD, other common SHMs have also shown up in our

288

sequence analysis (Figure 5a), albeit with a lower frequency. Most noticeably, a cluster of

289

common SHMs is found in VH framework region 1 from residues 26 to 28. This cluster of SHMs

290

is also likely to be important for affinity maturation to RBD. A recent study has indeed shown that

291

SHMs VH F27V and T28I together increase affinity by 100-fold of an IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody to

292

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD38. Additional common SHMs among IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with

293

a short CDR H3 include S31R in CDR H1 and V50L in CDR H2 (Figure 5a). As a result, while

294

IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies do not require any SHM to neutralize SARS-CoV-257, this study

295

along with others have shown that SHM can substantially improve the binding affinity of IGHV3-

296

53/3-66 antibodies to RBD38,57. Consistently, RBD antibodies from convalescent SARS-CoV-2

297

patients have significantly more SHMs and higher neutralization potency at 6 months post-

298

infection than at 1-month post-infection62.

299
300

Circulating SARS-CoV-2 mutant variants represent a major ongoing challenge to natural immunity

301

and vaccination. In particular, a lot of attention has been focused on RBD mutation E484K, which

302

has emerged in multiple independently SARS-CoV-2 lineages63,64 and can alter the antigenicity

303

of the spike protein65-67. Another naturally occurring RBD mutation, K417N, which has emerged

304

in South Africa and Brazil (B.1.351 lineage and B.1.1.28, respectively)63,64,68, has recently been

305

shown to also alter antigenicity of the spike protein66,69-71. Consistently, we found that K417N

306

dramatically decreased the binding of COV107-23 (clonotype 1) and COVD21-C8 (clonotype 2)

307

to RBD (Supplementary Figures 11a-11b). In fact, K417 forms an electrostatic interaction with the

308

signature residue VH D/E98 of CDR H3 in clonotype 2 antibodies (Figure 2b) and can also interact

309

with CDR H3 of clonotype 1 antibodies (Supplementary Figure 11c), providing a structural

310

explanation for its change in antigenicity. Constant antigenic drift of SARS-CoV-2 is unavoidable

311

if it keeps circulating among humans. Thus, sustained efforts in characterizing the antibody

312

response to SARS-CoV-2 as it evolves will not only benefit vaccine development and assessment,

313

but also improve our fundamental understanding of the ability of the antibody repertoire to rapidly

314

respond to viral infections.

Methods

316

Literature mining for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD

317

Sequences of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD from convalescent patients infected with SARS-CoV-2

318

were obtained from published articles20-40 (Supplementary Table 1). IgBlast was used to identify

319

somatic hypermutations and analyze IGHJ gene usage72. Of note, IgBlast can only identify IGHJ

320

gene usage for antibodies with available nucleotide sequences. Sequence logos were generated

321

by WebLogo73.

322
323

Expression and purification of Fc-tagged RBD

324

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) (residues 319-541) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein

325

(GenBank: QHD43416.1) was fused with an N-terminal Igk secretion signal and a C-terminal

326

SSSSG linker followed by an Fc tag and cloned into a phCMV3 vector. The plasmid was

327

transiently transfected into Expi293F cells using ExpiFectamine™ 293 Reagent (Thermo Fisher

328

Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was collected at 7 days

329

post-transfection. The Fc-tagged RBD was purified with by KanCapA protein A affinity resin

330

(Kaneka).

331
332

Expression and purification of Fabs

333

Fab heavy and light chains were cloned into phCMV3. Heavy chain Y58F or F58Y mutants were

334

constructed using the QuikChange XL Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the

335

manufacturer’s instructions. The plasmids were transiently co-transfected into Expi293F cells at

336

a ratio of 2:1 (HC:LC) using ExpiFectamine™ 293 Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according

337

to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was collected at 7 days post-transfection. The

338

Fab was purified with a CaptureSelect™ CH1-XL Pre-packed Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

341

Binding assays were performed by biolayer interferometry (BLI) using an Octet Red96e

342

instrument (FortéBio) as described previously74. Briefly, Fc-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins at

343

20 to 100 μg/ml in 1x kinetics buffer (1x PBS, pH 7.4, 0.01% w/v BSA and 0.002% v/v Tween 20)

344

were loaded onto streptavidin (SA) biosensors and incubated with the indicated concentrations of

345

Fabs. The assay consisted of five steps: 1) baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 2) loading: 300 s

346

with His6-tagged S or RBD proteins; 3) baseline: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer; 4) association: 60 s

347

with samples (Fab or IgG); and 5) dissociation: 60 s with 1x kinetics buffer. For estimating the

348

exact KD, a 1:1 binding model was used.

349
350

X-ray crystallography

351

Fabs COV107-23 (15 mg/ml) and COV107-23 paired with the light chain of COVD21-C8

352

(COV107-23-swap, 14 mg/ml) were screened for crystallization using the 384 conditions of the

353

JCSG Core Suite (Qiagen) on our custom-designed robotic CrystalMation system (Rigaku) at

354

Scripps Research by the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops containing 0.1 μl of protein and

355

0.1 μl of reservoir solution. For COV107-23, optimized crystals were grown in 0.085 M of sodium

356

citrate - citric acid pH 5.6, 0.17 M ammonium acetate, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 25.5% (w/v)

357

polyethylene glycol 4000 at 20°C. For COV107-23-swap, optimized crystals were grown in 0.1 M

358

of sodium citrate pH 4, 1 M lithium chloride, and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 at 20°C.

359

Crystals were grown for 7 days and then harvested and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction

360

data were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation

361

Lightsource (SSRL) on the Scripps/Stanford beamline 12-1 with a beam wavelength of 0.97946

362

Å, and processed with HKL200075. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using

363

PHASER76,

364

(https://sysimm.org/rep_builder/)77. Iterative model building and refinement were carried out in

Construction of plasmids and CDR H3 library

368

143 oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table 3) encoding CDR H3 were obtained from Integrated

369

DNA Technologies (IDT) and PCR-amplified using 5´-ACC TAC AGA TGA ATT CTC TTA GGG

370

CAG AAG ATA CCG CCG TCT ACT ACT GC-3´ as forward primer and 5´-GGG CCT TTT GTA

371

GAA GCT GAA CTC ACA GTG ACG GTA GTC CCT TGT CCC CA-3´ as reverse primer. Then,

372

the amplified oligonucleotide pool was gel-purified using a GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo

373

Scientific).

374
375

Wild-type (WT) B38 yeast display plasmid, pCTcon2_B38, was generated by cloning the coding

376

sequence of (from N-terminal to C-terminal, all in-frame) Aga2 secretion signal, B38 Fab light

377

chain, V5 tag, ERBV-1 2A self-cleaving peptide, Aga2 secretion signal, B38 Fab heavy chain, HA

378

tag, and Aga2p, into the pCTcon2 vector80. pCTcon2_B38 was PCR-amplified using 5´-TGG GGA

379

CAA GGG ACT ACC GTC ACT GTG-3´ as forward primer and 5´-GCA GTA GTA GAC GGC

380

GGT ATC TTC TGC-3´ as reverse primer to generate the linearized vector. The PCR product was

381

then gel-purified.

382
383

Yeast antibody display library generation

384

5 µg of the amplified oligonucleotide pool and 4 µg of purified linearized vector were transformed

385

into Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100 via electroporation following previously published

386

protocol81 to generate a B38 yeast display library with different CDR H3 variants.

387
388

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of yeast antibody display library

389

100 µl of WT B38 yeast antibody display library glycerol stock was recovered in 50 ml SD-CAA

390

medium (2% w/v D-glucose, 0.67% w/v yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate, 0.5% w/v

393

time, 15 ml of the yeast culture was harvested, and the yeast pellet was obtained via centrifugation

394

at 4,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and SGR-CAA (2% w/v galactose,

395

2% w/v raffinose, 0.1% w/v D-glucose, 0.67% w/v yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate,

396

397

398

transferred to a baffled flask and incubated at 18°C with shaking at 250 rpm. Once OD600 has

399

reached between 1.3 and 1.6, 1 ml of yeast culture was harvested, and the yeast pellet was

400

obtained via centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min. The pellet was subsequently washed

401

with 1 ml of 1x PBS twice. After the final wash, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 1x PBS.

402
403

Then, for expression assay, 1 µg of PE anti-HA.11 (epitope 16B12, BioLegend, Cat. No. 901517)

404

buffer-exchanged into 1x PBS was added to the cells. A negative control was set up with nothing

405

added to the PBS-resuspended cells. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation.

406

Then, the yeast pellet was washed twice in 1x PBS and resuspended in FACS tubes containing

407

2 ml 1X PBS. Using a BD FACS Aria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences), PE-positive cells were

408

collected in 1 ml of SD-CAA containing 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin. Cells were then collected via

409

centrifugation at 4,500 rpm at 20°C for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded. Subsequently,

410

the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of SD-CAA and plated on SD-CAA plates at 37°C. After 40

411

h, colonies were collected in 2 ml of SD-CAA. Frozen stocks were made by reconstituting the

412

pellet in 15% v/v glycerol (in SD-CAA medium) and then stored at -80°C.

413
414

For binding assay, 20 µg of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-Fc was added to washed cells. A negative

415

antibody (clone HP6017, BioLegend, Cat. No. 409304) buffer-exchanged into 1x PBS was added

Next-generation sequencing of CDR H3 loops

429

Plasmids from the unsorted yeast display library (input) as well as two replicates of sorted yeast

430

display library based on RBD-binding and expression were extracted from sorted yeast cells using

431

a Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep II Kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

432

The CDR H3 region was subsequently amplified via PCR using 5´- ACC TAC AGA TGA ATT CTC

433

TTA GG-3´ and 5´- GGG CCT TTT GTA GAA GCT GAA CT-3´ as forward and reverse primers,

434

respectively. Subsequently, adapters containing sequencing barcodes were appended to the

435

genes encoding the CDR H3 region via PCR. 100 ng of each sample was used for paired-end

436

sequencing using Illumina MiSeq PE150 (Illumina). PEAR was used for merging the forward and

437

reverse reads82. Regions corresponding to the CDR H3 were extracted from each paired read.

438

The number of reads corresponding to each CDR H3 variant in each sample is counted. A

439

pseudocount of 1 was added to the final count to avoid division by zero in enrichment calculation.

440

The enrichment for variant i was computed as follows:

441

Enrichment =

(read count of variant i in sorted sample)/(total read count in sorted sample)
(read count of variant i in input)/(total read count in input)

Figure 4. Binding and expression profiling of 143 CDR H3 variants in B38 antibody. (a) For

694

each of the 143 CDR H3 variants, the enrichment in occurrence frequencies after FACS

695

selections for binding to RBD and expression level are shown. Blue: CDR H3 variants that are

696

derived from IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies that use IGKV1-9. Black: CDR H3 variants that are

697

derived from IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies that do not use IGKV1-9. Shaded area indicates

698

log10 enrichment in binding > 0. (b) The amino-acid length distribution of CDR H3 variants that

699

are positively enriched in binding (log10 enrichment in binding > 0) or not (log10 enrichment in

700

binding ≤ 0) is shown. (c) Sequence logos are shown for CDR H3 variants with 9 aa (Kabat

701

numbering) that are positively enriched or not enriched. (d) Comparison of log10 enrichment in

Figure 5. Y58F is a signature somatic hypermutation in IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with

708

a short CDR H3. (a) IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies are categorized based on their CDR H3

709

length (Kabat numbering). Occurrence frequencies of individual somatic hypermutations in

710

different categories were quantified and shown as a heatmap. (b) Both Y58 and F58 variants

711

were constructed for four IGHV3-53 antibodies. Binding affinity (KD) of each of these antibodies

712

as Fab format to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was measured by biolayer interferometry with RBD loaded

713

on the biosensor and Fab in solution. Y-axis represents the response. Dissociation constants (KD)

714

for the Fabs were obtained using a 1:1 binding model. Of note, the WTs of COV107-23, COVD21-

715

C8, and CC12.3 contain F58, whereas the WT of COVA2-20 contains Y58.
