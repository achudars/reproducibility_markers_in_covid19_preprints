Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses an unprecedented public health crisis.
Accumulating evidences suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of
immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains
elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected
with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 in animal
models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of
S100A8/A9, could reduce inflammatory response and rescue the pneumonia with
substantial reduction of viral titers in SASR-CoV-2 infected animals. Remarkably,
Paquinimod treatment resulted in 100% survival of mice in a lethal model of mouse
coronavirus (MHV) infection. A novel group of neutrophils that contributed to the
uncontrolled inflammation and onset of COVID-19 were dramatically induced by
coronavirus infections. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and
regain antiviral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and noncanonical
neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for
therapeutic intervention.

Introduction
The ongoing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in unprecedented
public health crises, requiring a deep understanding of the pathogenesis and
developments of effective COVID-19 therapeutics (Wu et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020).
Innate immunity is an important arm of the mammalian immune system, which serves
as the first line of host defense against pathogens. Most of the cells of the body harbor
the protective machinery of the innate immunity and can recognize foreign invading
viruses (Akira et al., 2006). The innate immune system recognizes microorganisms
via the pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and upon detection of invasion by
pathogens, and PRRs activate downstream signaling pathways leading to the
expression of various cytokines and immune-related genes for clearing the pathogens
including bacteria, viruses and others (Akira et al., 2006). With regards to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, an overaggressive immune response has been noted which
causes immunopathology (Huang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, T cell
exhaustion or dysfunction has also been observed (Diao et al., 2020; Zheng et al.,
2020a; Zheng et al., 2020b). Besides, some studies suggest that there may be a unique
immune response evoked by coronaviruses (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). However, the
nature of these responses elicited by the virus remains poorly understood.
Accumulating evidences suggest that the neutrophil count is significantly increased
in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms (Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Liao et al.,
2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). It is believed that neutrophils migrate from
the circulating blood to infected tissues in response to inflammatory stimuli, where
they protect the host by phagocytosing, killing and digesting bacterial and fungal
pathogens (Nauseef and Borregaard, 2014; Nicolas-Avila et al., 2017). The role of
such a response in host defense against viral infection has not been clearly
characterized. A recent study observed a new subpopulation of neutrophils in
COVID-19 patients, which have been named developing neutrophils because they
lack canonical neutrophil markers like CXCR2 and FCGR3B (Wilk et al., 2020).

However, it is still not clear how this type of neutrophil is activated. Moreover, the
precise function of these cells is also unknown.
Alarmins are endogenous, chemotactic and immune activating proteins/peptides
which are released as a result of cell injury or death, degranulation, or in response to
infection. They mediate the relay of intercellular defense signals by interacting with
chemotactic and pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate immune cells in host
defense (Oppenheim and Yang, 2005; Yang et al., 2017). Currently, the major
categories of alarmins include defensins, high-mobility group (HMG) proteins,
interleukins (ILs), heat shock proteins (HSPs), S100 proteins, uric acid, hepatoma
derived growth factor (HDGF), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), and
cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) (Giri et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017).
In response to microbial infection, alarmins are released to initiate and amplify
innate/inflammatory immune responses, which involve the activation of resident
leukocytes (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, etc.), production of
inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and lipid metabolites), recruitment
of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages for the purpose of eliminating invading
microorganisms and clearing injured tissues (Bianchi, 2007; Chen and Nunez, 2010;
Nathan, 2002; Oppenheim and Yang, 2005; Yang et al., 2017). However, uncontrolled
production of alarmins is harmful or even fatal to the host in some cases. HMGB1
protein acts as a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation in sepsis (Wang et al.,
2004). Therefore, anti-HMGB1 therapeutics have shown to be beneficial in
experimental models of sepsis.
S100A8 and S100A9 make up approximately 45% of the cytoplasmic proteins
present in neutrophils. Both these proteins are members of the S100 group of proteins.
S100A8 and S100A9 are also referred to as MRP8 and MRP14, respectively. Under
physiological conditions, massive levels of S100A8 and S100A9 are stored in
neutrophils and myeloid-derived dendritic cells, while low levels of S100A8 and
S100A9 are expressed constitutively in monocytes (Foell et al., 2004; Wang et al.,
2018). S100A8 and S100A9 often form heterodimers (S100A8/A9) (Ometto et al.,
2017). The major functions of S100A8/A9 reported so far include the regulation of

leukocyte migration and trafficking, the remodeling of cytoskeleton, amplification of
inflammation and exertion of anti-microbial activity (Ometto et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
2018). After being infected with bacteria, neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes
intensely induce the expression and secretion of S100A8/A9 to modulate
inflammatory processes through the induction of inflammatory cytokines. S100A8/9
is an endogenous ligand of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and can trigger multiple
inflammatory pathways mediated by TLR4 (Vogl et al., 2007). S100A8 and S100A9
also have antibacterial potential via their ability to bind Zn2+ (Foell et al., 2004; Wang
et al., 2018). Not much is known about the roles of S100A8/A9 in host defense
responses against viruses.
In the present study, we characterized the nature of the early innate immune
responses evoked in rhesus macaques and mice during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
S100A8 was dramatically upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 and a mouse coronavirus
(mouse hepatitis virus, MHV), but not by other viruses. A group of non-canonical
neutrophils were also activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The abnormal immune
responses were mediated by the S100A8/A9-TLR4 pathway. S100A8/A9 specific
inhibitor, Paquinimod, significantly reduced the number of neutrophils activated by
the coronavirus, inhibited viral replication and rescued lung damage a result of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results highlight the potential of therapeutically
targeting S100A8/A9 for suppressing the uncontrolled inflammation associated with
severe cases of COVID-19 and provide new information on an alarmin-mediated
pathway for regulating neutrophil function.

Results
Induction of S100A8 and activation of neutrophils by SARS-CoV-2
To characterize the early immune responses against coronavirus infection, we infected
rhesus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 and analyzed the transcriptome of infected and
non-infected animals (Figure 1A). The whole genome wide RNA-seq analysis of the
lungs from infected rhesus macaques showed that a number of transcripts were

induced or inhibited at day 3 and day 5 after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary
Figure 1A). The induction of primary antiviral factors, like type I IFNs was
completely blocked during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Figure 1B). Gene
ontology (GO) analysis showed that a small group of genes involved in defense
responses against viruses was induced (Figure 1B). However, interestingly, a greater
number of genes involved in regulating cellular responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
were induced by SARS-CoV-2 at day 3 post infection. An analysis of the KEGG
pathways also showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced genes were enriched with more
from anti-bacterial pathways than those from anti-viral pathways (Supplementary
Figure 1C). In line with this, neutrophil chemotaxis associated genes were also
upregulated as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This upregulation was less
significant at day 3, but more significant at day 5 when compared to the levels of
genes related to antiviral responses that were induced as a result of the viral infection
(Figure 1B). It is worthy to note that the number of neutrophils increases in
COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms (Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Liao et al.,
2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). Our results of the preliminary
characterization of the early innate response to a SARS-CoV-2 challenge indicate that
neutrophils are significantly activated at the very beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To confirm this, we examined the expression of neutrophil markers in the lungs from
infected rhesus macaques. All the signature genes, from primary granules to tertiary
granules, were significantly induced as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1C).
The markers for monocytes and natural killer cells were slightly upregulated. T cells
were unchanged, while interestingly, B cells were significantly down-regulated in the
lungs of infected animals (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 1D). Taken together,
the above data suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 infection provoked a non-canonical
antiviral response, or an antibacterial response accompanied by increased neutrophils
in the lung at the early stage.
To explore how an infection by SARS-CoV-2 triggers the activation of antibacterial
responses, we examined the differential expression of genes before and after
coronavirus infection. The expression of alarmin protein S100A8 was robustly

upregulated with 7,000- and 18,000-fold induction at day 3 and day 5 post
SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively (Figure 1E). S100A8 acts as an alarmin through
formation of heterodimers with S100A9, then these heterodimers function as danger
associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules and activate innate immune
responses via binding to pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4). In our studies, S100A9 was also induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Figure 1E). The basal expression of S100A9 was much higher, but its induction was
not as significant as that of S100A8. In fact, among all the known alarmins, S100A8
was the most significantly induced gene at both day 3 and day 5 post infection (Figure
1F). qRT-PCR analysis showed that the level of S100A8/9 surged along with an
increase in the viral load in the lung of infected animals (Figure 1G). Next, we
examined the expression of alarmins in the blood samples taken from infected rhesus
macaques. S100A8/9 as well as the neutrophil marker genes were also induced by the
viral infection (Figure 1H). Based on these results, we investigated if S100A8/A9
were upregulated in COVID-19 patients. Remarkably, both S100A8 and S100A9 were
upregulated in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19-positive patients when
compared with biopsied healthy lung tissue from uninfected individuals (Figure 1I).
The expression of neutrophil marker genes was also significantly increased in
COVID-19-positive patients (Figure 1I). Concomitantly, the mRNA level of S100A8
was significantly higher in peripheral blood from COVID-19-positive patients when
compared to healthy subjects (Supplementary Figure 1E). A group of alarmins were
induced in different types of blood cells of COVID-19-positive patients. For instance,
S100A8 was significantly induced in red blood cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD16+
monocytes, neutrophils and developing neutrophils (Figure 1J). S100A8/A9 is the
ligand of TLR4, which is the primary PRR that recognizes invading gram-negative
bacterium and LPS. We thus observed a significant induction of genes that were
predominantly involved in responses to LPS and anti-bacterial pathways. S100A8/A9
are also able to induce neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion, which probably
contributed to the increased infiltration of neutrophils.

Activation of coronavirus-specific neutrophils
To further investigate the nature of immune responses triggered and the roles of
S100A8 in these responses, we challenged hACE2 transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2
and C57BL/6 mice with Influenza A virus (IAV), which also infects the respiratory
tract. We performed whole genome wide RNA-seq analysis to characterize the
defense responses during viral infection (Figure 2A). Consistent with the results from
the rhesus macaque experiments, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not trigger typical
antiviral immune responses (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2A). GO analysis
showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced genes were enriched in antibacterial humoral
response and neutrophil chemotaxis at day 1, day 3 and day 5 post infection. In
contrast to this, IAV induced genes were enriched in defense response to virus and
cellular response to IFNβ (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2B). KEGG analysis
showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced genes were enriched in bacterium related and
autoimmune pathways at day 1, day 3 and day 5 post infection. Comparatively, IAV
induced genes were enriched within virus related pathways (Figure 2B and
Supplementary Figure 2B). We further analyzed the differentially induced genes at
different time intervals after SARS-CoV-2 infection. GO analysis showed that while
SARS-CoV-2 induced antibacterial responses, neutrophil related and other processes,
IAV induced canonical antiviral responses and activated type I IFNs signaling (Figure
2C and supplementary Figure 2C). We then evaluated the expression of IFNs in the
lungs during SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection. Except for IFNκ, all the type I IFNs
were significantly induced by IAV infection (Supplementary Figure 2D). Interestingly,
SARS-CoV-2 was only able to induce IFNκ but not any other type I IFNs
(Supplementary Figure 2D). Both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were able to induce IFNγ
expression. IAV, but not SARS-CoV-2, induced type III IFNs production
(Supplementary Figure 2D). qRT-PCR further confirmed that IFNβ and ISG15
induction was impaired during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2C). The induction of
most ISGs was attenuated during SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with IAV
infection (Supplementary Figure 2E). However, SARS-CoV-2 but not IAV induced
S100A8 and neutrophil marker genes Ly6g expression (Figure 2C). Consistently,

other neutrophil marker genes were also induced by SARS -CoV-2 but not by IAV
(Figure 2D). Similar to the data from rhesus macaque experiments, compared to other
alarmins, S100A8 was robustly induced by SARS-CoV-2 but not by IAV infection in
mice (Figure 2E). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection specifically induces the transcription
of alarmin S100A8. To further confirm this, we infected C57BL/6 mice with other
RNA- or DNA-viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), herpes
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and measured the
expression of S100A8 in the lung of infected animals. None of these viruses were able
to induce the expression of S100A8 (Figure 2F).
We then investigated if other coronaviruses were able to induce the transcription of
S100A8 and activate neutrophils. We infected C57BL/6 mice with mouse hepatitis
virus (MHV-A59) intranasally (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, we did not observe any
obvious symptoms in infected mice. We then infected IRF3/IRF7 double knockout
mice and IFNAR deficient mice with MHV. Similar to the wild type mice, IRF3/IRF7
double knockout mice were able to eliminate the virus rapidly and did not develop
severe pneumonia. Interestingly, IFNAR deficient mice showed obvious damage in
pulmonary interstitium and alveoli (Figure 2G). All the mice died within 10 days
(Figure 2H). We performed whole genome RNA-seq analysis to determine if MHV
induced similar immune responses as those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
lungs of MHV infected mice were collected at day 5 post infection and subjected to
RNA analysis. Similarly, MHV induced genes were enriched in neutrophil chemotaxis
and antibacterial pathways (Figure 2I). S100A8 was also significantly induced by
MHV infection (Figure 2J). When compared to IAV, type I IFNs induction was
impaired, but neutrophil marker genes were significantly induced by MHV infection
(Figure 2K and 2L). Histological staining of samples taken from lungs showed more
S100A8 positive cells infiltration after MHV infection (Figure 2M).
Since the expression of neutrophil marker genes was elevated in the lung after
coronavirus infection, we examined if more neutrophils were infiltrated into lung
during infection. Surprisingly, the number of Ly-6G (high) and CD11b (high)
neutrophils decreased in the lung after MHV infection (Figure 2N). Interestingly, a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704; this version posted September 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this

group of CD11b (high) Ly-6G (mid) cells showed up after MHV infection. Further
analysis revealed that these cells were CD45+ granulocytes. A recent single cell
analysis study had reported that a group of developing neutrophils was detected in the
peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients with decreased expression of canonical
neutrophil markers CXCR2 and FCGR3B (Wilk et al., 2020). We purified these cells
by using flow cytometry sorting. qRT-PCR analysis showed decreased expression of
CXCR2 and FCGR3 (Figure 2O). To explore if other types of viruses or stimuli are
able to induce these cells, we challenged C57BL/6 mice with IAV, EMCV, VSV,
HSV-1 and LPS, hACE2 transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 through nasal
inoculation. Interestingly, only SARS-CoV-2 and MHV induced this group of
neutrophils (Figure 2P). Taken together, these results suggest that coronavirus
infection induces S100A8 and a group of noncanonical neutrophils specifically.

Paquinimod suppresses coronavirus specific neutrophils and viral infection
S100A8/A9 functions as a TLR4 ligand that amplifies inflammation by triggering the
activation of innate immune signaling, including neutrophil chemotaxis. We thus
reasoned that the abnormal upregulation of S100A8/A9 probably resulted in
activation of coronavirus specific neutrophils and dysregulation of immune responses.
Quinoline-3-carboxamide Paquinimod (also known as ABR-215757), is an inhibitor
of S100A9 which can prevent the binding of S100A9 to TLR-4 (Bjork et al., 2009;
Schelbergen et al., 2015), suggesting that it can be used to block the function of
S100A8/A9 and mitigate the antibacterial immune responses elicited during
SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test this, we treated the SARS-COV-2 infected mice with
S100A8/A9 inhibitor Paquinimod (Figure 3A). Expectedly, Paquinimod was able to
rescue the weight loss of infected mice and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral replication
significantly (Figure 3B and 3C). Consistently, the expressions of neutrophil markers
(Ly6G, MMP8, LTF), IL-6 and S100A8 were significantly reduced after Paquinimod
treatment (Figure 3D). More strikingly, Paquinimod completely rescued the death of
MHV infected, but not IAV infected IFNAR deficient mice and significantly inhibited
MHV replication (Figure 3E, 3F and Supplementary Figure 3A). The expression of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704; this version posted September 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this

neutrophil marker genes in lung and blood from infected mice was also inhibited by
Paquinimod (Figure 3G, 3H and Supplementary Figure 3B). The damages to
pulmonary interstitium and alveoli were alleviated, and infiltration of S100A8+ cells
was also reduced by Paquinimod (Figure 3I and 3J).
To gain further insights into the modulation of immune responses after Paquinimod
treatment, we performed genome wide RNA-seq analysis using the RNA from MHV
infected IFNAR deficient mice. As expected, pathways related to neutrophil
chemotaxis and antibacterial responses were primarily downregulated by Paquinimod
(Figure 3K and Supplementary Figure 3C). Interestingly, Paquinimod upregulated
genes that were intensively enriched in positive regulation of B cell activation and B
cell receptor signaling pathway (Figure 3K). The transcription of a group of B cell
related genes was decreased during MHV infection (Figure 3L), which was consistent
with results in rhesus macaque experiments (Supplementary Figure 1D). The
expression of these B cell related genes was rescued or induced by Paquinimod during
MHV infection, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 3M). In line with
this, SARS-CoV-2 but not IAV infection, suppressed the expression of these B cell
related genes (Figure 3N and Supplementary Figure 3D), which were also rescued by
Paquinimod (Figure 3O).

S100A8 activates aberrant neutrophils via TLR4
We demonstrated that Paquinimod inhibited the expression of neutrophil maker genes
in lung and blood. To determine if Paquinimod could reduce the number of these
abnormal cells, we performed flowcytometry to analyze the cell population during
coronavirus infection. Coronavirus-specific neutrophils were significantly reduced in
blood and lung after treatment with Paquinimod (Figure 4A). It is believed that
S100A8/A9 can activate TLR4 or receptor for advanced glycation end products
(RAGE) pathways. Interestingly, TLR4 inhibitor (Resatorvid) but not RAGE inhibitor
(Azeliragon) was able to reduce the number of these neutrophils suggesting that
S100A8/A9 activated these neutrophils via TLR4 pathway (Figure 4A). Moreover,
MHV infection also induced these neutrophils in liver and bone marrow, which could

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.288704; this version posted September 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this

be suppressed by TLR4 inhibitor (Figure 4B). Consistently, Resatorvid was able to
inhibit viral replication in lung and blood of the infected mice (Figure 4C). Moreover,
both Paquinimod and Resatorvid suppressed the activation of coronavirus related
neutrophils in lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 4D). To confirm the role of
TLR4 in activating S100A8 related signaling, we examined S100A8 induction upon
LPS treatment. LPS induced S100A8 expression through adaptor protein MyD88
(Supplementary Figure 4A). We then treated mouse macrophages with the serum from
SARS-CoV-2 infected mice with or without Paquinimod treatment. The serum from
infected mice was able to induce the expression of S100A8 and CXCL2 but not IL-1β
or IL-6 in a MyD88 dependent manner (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure 4B).
S100A8 further activated TLR4 signaling to form a positive loop. We thus observed
that Paquinimod was able to inhibit the induction of S100A8 (Figure 3D and 3G-H).
CXCL2 is the primary chemokine that recruits neutrophils. Consistent with the in vivo
results (Figure 4A), Azeliragon could not inhibit induction of S100A8 or CXCL2 by
the serum (Figure 4E). S100A8 therefore exerted its pathogenic function through
activating TLR4 signaling during coronavirus infections.
A recent single cell sequencing data clarified the heterogeneity of neutrophils and
identified 8 subpopulations (Xie et al., 2020). We collected the CD11+ and Ly-6G+
cells from bone marrow (Figure 4B) and examined the expression of each marker
gene during MHV infection with or without TLR4 inhibitor. Compared to noninfected
mice, MHV induced expression of all 3 G1 maker genes and 1 maker gene from G0 to
G1, but inhibited expression of other maker genes (Figure 4F). Interestingly,
Resatorvid was able to reverse the expression of marker genes back to the normal
levels. The expression of canonical neutrophil markers CXCR2, LY6G and FCGR3
were decreased after MHV infection (Figure 4G). We further analyzed the RNA-seq
data of lung samples taken from the mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. G5B
population, the matured neutrophil, was activated during IAV infection (Figure 4H
and Supplementary Figure 4C). Whereas SARS-CoV-2, similar to the results from
bone marrow experiments (Figure 4F), activated G1 subpopulation significantly. In
addition, SARS-CoV-2 also induced other premature neutrophil markers from G2 to

G4 subpopulation in lung (Figure 4H and Supplementary Figure 4C). Interestingly,
Paquinimod was able to turn off the abnormal upregulation of these genes
(Supplementary Figure 4D). Together, these results suggested that coronavirus
infection expanded the population of premature neutrophils in S100A8/9 and TLR4
dependent manner, and caused dysregulation of the immune system.

Discussion
Innate immunity, the first line of host defense, employs pattern-recognition receptors
(PRRs) for recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of invading
pathogens and galvanizing the host defense machinery. The endogenous
danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are also able to trigger the activation
of innate immune signaling. Alarmins are a panel of proteins or peptides that can
function as DAMPs to activate various immune pathways (Bianchi, 2007; Yang et al.,
2017). The fine tuning of the transcription of alarmins is critical for maintaining
immune homoeostasis. Over or sustained expression of alarmins could result in
uncontrolled inflammation (Chan et al., 2012; Cher et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2014;
Patel, 2018). Such imbalanced immune responses and cytokine storm contribute to the
development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we
demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and MHV, but not any other tested viruses, induced a
robust and sustained transcription of the alarmin S100A8 in animal models (Figure 1
D-G and Figure 2). In line with this, the substantial upregulation of S100A8 was also
observed in the lung and peripheral blood of infected macaques and COVID-19
patients (Figure 1H and 1I). Although we did observe that the SARS-CoV-2 and the
other types of viruses could induce S100A8 expression slightly in blood at day 1 post
infection (Figure 2C), however, the induction of S100A8 by viruses other than
SARS-CoV-2 was either unchanged or reduced at day 5 post infection. S100A8
expression increased dramatically by 300 folds at day 5 post infection (Figure 2C).
Similar phenotypes were observed during MHV infection (Figure 2F). Thus,
uncontrolled or sustained induction of S100A8 could be a common feature of

coronavirus infections. However, the mechanisms by which coronaviruses provoke
the induction of S100A8 is unknown.
In addition to studying the innate immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2
infected hACE2 transgenic mice and rhesus macaques, we also infected IFNAR
deficient mice with mouse coronavirus and characterized the resulting immune
responses. The MHV infected mice exhibited a characteristic immune signature
comprising of S100A8 induction, initiation of antibacterial like responses and
activation of coronavirus related neutrophils. These features of the immune response
were similar to those observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice and rhesus macaques
(Figure 2 and Figure 4A and 4B). Untreated MHV infected mice developed more
severe symptoms and died within 10 days. Mice administered with S100A8 inhibitor,
Paquinimod, were rescued from lung damage and death against MHV infections.
Since these results were similar to those obtained during studies with SARS-CoV-2, it
seems like a shared mechanism that directs the pathogenesis of pneumonia during
SARS-CoV-2 and MHV infections in animal models. Thus, IFNAR deficient mice
and MHV through its ability to evoke similar immune responses as SARS-CoV-2,
could serve as useful models for investigating ARDS associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection. Although we inoculated wild type, MAVS knockout, STING knockout,
ELF4 knockout and IRF3/IRF7 double knockout mice with MHV intranasally, none
of these mice developed obvious ARDS related symptoms. IRF3 and IRF7 are key
transcription factor of type I IFNs. Type I IFNs activate interferon stimulated genes by
binding IFNAR. Since the IRF3/IRF7 double knockout phenotype was not susceptible
to MHV infection, it seems like IFNAR can exert its function in a type I IFNs
independent way. Previous studies (Hadjadj et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) and our
above data showed that induction of type I IFNs is completely blocked during
SARS-CoV-2 and MHV infections. This further suggests that IFNAR is involved in
defense against coronavirus with an unknown mechanism.
There is consensus that the neutrophil number is significantly increased in
COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms (Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Liao et al.,
2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). Moreover, a recent study identified that a

group of premature neutrophils in COVID-19 patients that do not express canonical
neutrophil markers like CXCR2 and FCGR3B. Bacterial coinfection is common in
viral pneumonia, especially, in critically ill patients (Bost et al., 2020). Neutrophils
can be activated during bacterial infection and are critical for killing invading bacteria
(Deng et al., 2013; Li et al., 2002). The increased neutrophil number and developing
neutrophils in patients could be attributed to coinfection of bacterium. However,
results of our studies showed that the premature neutrophils were induced by
coronavirus at the early stage of infection in animal models. We compared these cells
with 8 neutrophil subpopulations that were proposed in a recent study. Coronavirus
induced neutrophils in bone marrow and lung belong to the G1 population
predominately (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure 4B). Furthermore, the
populations of neutrophils in lungs are more diverse than those in bone marrow.
Compared to IAV induced neutrophils, coronavirus preferentially induces the
expression of premature marker genes (Supplementary Figure 4B). However, the
exact mechanism by which coronavirus induces these abnormal neutrophils and the
key transcription factors that direct development of these cells await to be further
investigated.
In summary, we have demonstrated that alarmin S100A8 was specifically
upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. S100A8/A9 amplified inflammatory
responses by activating TLR4 signaling pathway. A group of coronavirus-specific
premature

neutrophils

were

activated

during

infection. The inhibitors

of

S100A8/A9-TLR4 axis were able to mitigate abnormal inflammation and inhibit viral
replication. These results uncover the role of alarmins and neutrophils in the
pathogenesis of SASR-CoV-2 infection and provide new therapeutic targets for the
treatment of COVID-19.

University), IAV (Influenza A Virus, PR8) was a gift from Feng Qiang (Fudan
University), and HSV-1 (Herpes simplex virus 1) was from A. Iwasaki (Yale
University). EMCV (Encephalomyocarditis virus, VR-129B) was purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MHV-A59 (mouse hepatitis virus A-59)
has been described previously (Yang et al., 2014). The SARS‐CoV‐2 which has been
used in this paper is named strain HB‐01. The complete genome for this SARS‐CoV‐2
had been put in to GISAID (BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC‐HB‐01/2020|EPI_ISL_402119),
and has been described previously (Yu et al., 2020).
VSV, EMCV, HSV-1 were propagated in Vero cells followed by 3 cycles of
freezing and thawing, then the large debrises were spun down and the supernatants
were used as a stock solution. The titer of the viruses was determined by plaque assay
in Vero cells. For mice infection assay, WT mice were inoculated intranasally with
VSV (107 PFU), EMCV (107 PFU), HSV-1 (106 PFU) after anesthesia. PFU: plaque
forming unit.
MHV-A59 were propagated in 17CL-1 cells followed by 3 cycles of freezing and
thawing, the large debrises were spun down and the supernatants were used as a stock
solution. The titer of the viruses was determined by plaque assay in 17CL-1 cells. For
mice infection assay, Ifnar-/- mice were inoculated intranasally with MHV-A59 (105
PFU) after anesthesia or Ifnar-/- mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with
MHV-A59 (106 PFU).
IAV was propagated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonic chicken eggs.
The allantoic fluid was collected and titrated to determine the 50% tissue culture
infection dose (TCID50) in A549 cells and the median lethal dose (LD50) in mice
following the Reed-Muench method. For mice infection assay, WT mice were
inoculated intranasally with IAV (105 TCID50) after anesthesia.

Paquinimod rescue assay
For the Paquinimod rescue assay, WT mice, hACE2 mice, and Ifnar-/- mice were
inoculated intranasally with IAV, SARS-CoV-2, and MHV-A59 respectively after
anesthesia. The mice were given intranasally 12.5 μg/day of Paquinimod (TargetMol;

50 μL of PBS. Stock solutions of 100 mg/mL Paquinimod were prepared with DMSO
in advance. The health status and body weight of all mice were observed and recorded
daily. Mice were euthanized at 0,1, 3, 5 and 7 dpi to collect different tissues and
examine virus replication and histopathological changes.

Resatorvid rescue assay/Azeliragon rescue assay
Ifnar-/- mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with MHV-A59. For the Resatorvid
rescue assay, the mice were given intraperitoneally 50 μg/day of Resatorvid (MCE;
Synonyms: TAK-242; CLI-095) starting on 2 dpi. Stock solutions of 10 mM
Resatorvid were prepared with DMSO in advance. Before inoculating, stock solutions
of Resatorvid in DMSO was diluted by corn oil. For the Azeliragon rescue assay, the
mice were given intraperitoneally 100 μg/day of Azeliragon (TargetMol; Catalog No.
T2507) starting on 2 dpi. Stock solutions of 10 mM Azeliragon were prepared with
DMSO in advance. Before inoculating, stock solutions of Azeliragon in DMSO was
diluted by corn oil. The control group mice were given intraperitoneally 200 μL of
corn oil solution which is contained 20 μL DMSO. The health status and body weight
of all mice were observed and recorded daily. Mice were euthanized at 0,1, 3, 5 and 7
dpi to collect different tissues and examine virus replication and histopathological
changes.

Cell culture
Raw 274.7 cells, 17CL-1 cells, MDCK cells and Vero cells were kept in our lab.
17CL-1 cells, MDCK cells and Vero cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% FBS (PAN), 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin. Raw 274.7
cells were cultured in 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL

of Ifnar-/- mice on day 5 during Paquinimod rescue assay. After blood coagulation at
room temperature, samples were spun down and the supernatants were used as a stock
serum.
Raw 264.7 cells were seeded on 6-well plates with 106 cells/mL. After cell
adherence, LPS (100 ng/mL) and mice serum which has been collected above (2
μL/mL) were added. After 12 hours co-culture, cells were harvested and lysed by
TRNzol reagent for RNA extraction.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and analysis
Whole RNA of cells with specific treatment were purified using RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen NO. 74104). The transcriptome library for sequencing was generated using
VAHTSTM mRNA-seq v2 Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (Vazyme Biotech Co.,Ltd,
Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer's recommendations. After clustering, the
libraries were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq X Ten platform using (2×150bp)
paired-end module. The raw images were transformed into raw reads by base calling
using CASAVA (http://www. illumina.com/ support/ documentation.ilmn). Then, raw
reads in a fastq format were first processed using in-house perl scripts. Clean reads
were obtained by removing reads with adapters, reads in which unknown bases were
more than 5% and low quality reads (the percentage of low quality bases was over
50% in a read, we defined the low quality base to be the base whose sequencing
quality was no more than 10). At the same time, Q20, Q30, GC content of the clean
data were calculated (Vazyme Biotech Co.,Ltd, Nanjing, China). The original data of
the RNA-seq was uploaded to the GEO DataSets.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the tissues by TRNzol reagent (DP424, Beijing
TIANGEN Biotech, China). Then, cDNA was prepared using HiScript III 1st Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (R312-02, Nanjing Vazyme Biotech, China). qRT-PCR was
performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA) with SYBR qPCR Master mix (Q331-02, Nanjing Vazyme

Biotech, China). The data of qRT-PCR were analyzed by the Livak method (2−ΔΔCt).
Ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) was used as a reference gene for mice, and GAPDH
for macaques. qRT-PCR primers are displayed in supplementary materials Table S1.

Histology and Immunohistochemical staining
The lungs were quickly placed in cold saline solution and rinsed after they were
collected. Then, lungs were fixed in 4% PFA, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin
prior to sectioning at 4 μm and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E).
For immunohistochemical staining, the lung paraffin sections were dewaxed and
rehydrated through xylene and an alcohol gradient. Antigen retrieval was performed
by heating the sections to 100 °C for 4 min in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and
repeated 4 times. The operations were performed according to the instructions of the
two-step detection kit (PV-9001, Beijing ZSGB Biotechnology, China). The samples
were treated by endogenous peroxidase blockers for 10 min at room temperature
followed by incubation with primary antibodies S100a8 (1:200, 47310T, Cell
Signaling Technology) at 37°C for 1 h, then after washed with PBS, sections were
incubated with reaction enhancer for 20 min at room temperature and secondary
antibodies at 37°C for 20 min, and finally sections were visualized by
3,30-diaminobenzidine

tetrahydrochloride

(DAB)

and

counterstained

with

haematoxylin.

Tissue preparation and data analysis for flow cytometry
The lung tissues, peripheral blood and bone marrow were collected from the mice.
The lungs were first ground with 200 mesh copper sieve, and then transferred to
DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mg/mL Collagenase D (11088858001, Roche,
Switzerland) and 0.1 mg/mL DNase I (07469, STEMCELL Technologies, Canada) for
a 20 min digestion at 37℃ to obtain single-cell suspensions. Livers were harvested
and homogenized into single-cell suspensions using 200 mesh copper sieve. Bone
marrow were flushed out of the femurs using a 23–gauge needle in PBS containing

2mM EDTA and 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and dispersed into single cells through
a pipette. Single-cell samples were treated by red blood cell lysis buffer (R1010,
Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology, China) for 2 min at room temperature and
passed through a 70–μm nylon mesh sieve before staining. Peripheral blood was
treated with red blood cell lysis buffer to remove red blood cells.
After blocking non-specific Fc-mediated interactions with CD16/CD32 antibodies
(14-0161-82, eBioscience, USA), single-cell suspensions were stained with
fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies at 4℃ for 30min. After washing the
samples, flow cytometry acquisition was performed on a BD LSRFortessa. Sorting
were performed using a BD AriaIII (BD). All antibodies were purchased from
eBioscience: CD45-PE (12-0451-81), Ly-6G-APC (17-9668-80), CD11b-FITC
(11-0112-81).

Statistical analysis
All analyses were repeated at least three times, and a representative experimental
result was presented. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used for statistical
analysis to determine significant differences when a pair of conditions was compared.
Asterisks denote statistical significance (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001). The
data are reported as the mean ± S.D.
