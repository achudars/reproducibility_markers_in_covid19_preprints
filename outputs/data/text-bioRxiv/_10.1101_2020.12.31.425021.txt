Abstract
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated
immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent serum
antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target
of serum neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal serum antibodies is affected by mutations in three
main epitopes in the RBD, but there is substantial variation in the impact of mutations both among
individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity,
the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD’s receptor
binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some sera is reduced >10-fold
by several mutations, including one in emerging viral lineages in South Africa and Brazil. Going
forward, these serum escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.
Introduction
Neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike are associated with protection against infection
in both humans ​(Addetia et al., 2020; Lumley et al., 2020)​ and animal models ​(Alsoussi et al., 2020;
Walls et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020a)​. However, other human coronaviruses undergo antigenic
evolution that erodes neutralizing antibody immunity ​(Eguia et al., 2020)​. This antigenic evolution is
driven by positive selection for mutations in the viral spike, particularly in regions involved in receptor
binding ​(Kistler and Bedford, 2020; Wong et al., 2017)​. To monitor for similar antigenic evolution of
SARS-CoV-2, it is important to determine which viral mutations impact human polyclonal antibody
immunity.
A multitude of recent studies have identified viral mutations that escape monoclonal antibodies
targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike ​(Baum et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al.,
2020b; Starr et al., 2020a; Weisblum et al., 2020)​.​ However, it remains unclear how mutations that
escape specific monoclonal antibodies will affect the polyclonal antibody response elicited by infection
or vaccination. Several recent studies have identified viral mutations that impact neutralization by
polyclonal human sera. So far, these studies have relied on either selecting viral escape mutants with
reduced neutralization sensitivity ​(Andreano et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020)​, or characterizing the
antigenic effects of specific mutations such as those observed in circulating viral isolates ​(Kemp et al.,
2020b; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; Thomson et al., 2020)​. This work has shown that single
mutations to the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) or N-terminal domain (NTD) can appreciably
reduce viral neutralization by polyclonal sera, sometimes by as much as 10-fold. However, a limitation

of these studies is that they characterize an incomplete subset of all possible mutations, and thus do
not completely describe the effects of viral mutations on recognition by polyclonal serum antibodies.
Here we comprehensively map how all amino-acid mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD
affect binding by the antibodies in plasma collected from convalescent individuals ~1 to ~3 months
post-symptom onset. We focus on the RBD because prior studies have reported that RBD-binding
antibodies contribute the majority of the neutralizing activity of most human sera ​(Piccoli et al., 2020;
Steffen et al., 2020)​, a result we confirm. Our complete maps of how mutations impact serum antibody
binding identify three major epitopes in the RBD. However, serum antibody binding from different
individuals is impacted differently by mutations in these epitopes, and sometimes the impacts of
mutations also change over time for longitudinal samples from the same individual. Some mutations
that reduce serum antibody binding also reduce viral neutralization by >10 fold. The site where
mutations tend to have the largest effect on binding and neutralization is E484, which unfortunately is a
site where mutations are present in several emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages ​(Tegally et al., 2020;
Voloch et al., 2020)​. However, some sera are more affected by mutations at other sites, while others
are largely unaffected by any single mutation. Overall, these systematic maps of how mutations to the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD affect recognition by human antibody immunity can inform surveillance of ongoing
viral evolution.
Results
RBD-targeting antibodies dominate the neutralizing activity of most convalescent sera
We characterized the serum antibodies from 35 plasma samples longitudinally collected from 17
different SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals between 15 and 121 days post-symptom onset. Prior work
has shown that these samples all have RBD-binding antibodies and neutralizing activity, with a median
neutralization titer 50% (NT50) of ~250 (range of 34 to >10,000) against lentiviral particles pseudotyped
with the D614 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. For most of the 17 individuals, both the RBD binding
and the neutralizing activity decreased moderately from one to four months post-infection ​(Crawford et
al., 2020a)​ (​Supplementary Table 1​).
Several recent studies have reported that RBD-binding antibodies contribute the majority of the
neutralizing activity in most convalescent human sera ​(Piccoli et al., 2020; Steffen et al., 2020)​. To
confirm the importance of anti-RBD antibodies for the samples in our study, we used RBD-conjugated
beads to deplete RBD-binding antibodies, and compared the neutralizing activity pre- and
post-depletion. First, we validated that these depletions effectively removed RBD-directed but not other
anti-spike antibodies. To do this, we created “synthetic” sera by combining non-neutralizing
pre-pandemic serum with either an RBD-binding or N-terminal domain (NTD)-binding monoclonal
antibody. As expected, RBD antibody depletion completely eliminated binding of the anti-RBD synthetic
serum to both RBD and spike, but did not reduce the spike binding activity of the anti-NTD synthetic
serum (​Figure S1A​).
We then validated that the depletion effectively removed nearly all RBD-binding antibodies from
the convalescent human plasma samples, and examined how depletion of RBD-binding antibodies
affected total serum binding to the spike ectodomain (​Figures 1A, S1B​). To do this, we performed
ELISAs for binding to the RBD and spike for each sample both pre- and post-depletion, using an
anti-IgG secondary antibody. The depletion removed essentially all RBD-binding IgG antibodies but
only modestly decreased the amount of IgG that bound to spike (​Figures 1A, S1B​). This result
suggests that RBD-binding antibodies comprise a relatively modest proportion of all spike-binding IgG
serum antibodies in naturally infected individuals, consistent with studies reporting that less than half of
spike-reactive B cells and monoclonal antibodies bind to RBD ​(Brouwer et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020;
Seydoux et al., 2020; Voss et al., 2020)​.

We next measured how depletion of RBD-binding antibodies affected neutralization of lentiviral
particles pseudotyped with the G614 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, and found that RBD-binding
antibodies usually dominated the neutralizing activity (​Figures 1B, S1C, Supplementary Table 1​).
Specifically, the majority of the neutralizing activity was due to RBD-binding antibodies in nearly all
samples (33 of 35 tested), and >90% of neutralizing activity was due to RBD-binding antibodies in over
a third of the samples (13 of 35 tested) (​Figures 1B, S1C​).
Notably, RBD-binding antibodies dominated the serum neutralizing activity both at early (~30
day) and late (~100 day) time points post-symptom onset. For many individuals, the contribution of
RBD-binding antibodies to serum neutralizing activity increased over time, although this was not always
the case (​Figures 1B, S1E​). For instance, the contribution of RBD-binding antibodies to neutralization
increased over time for subjects E and J, but not subjects L or M. The strong contribution of
RBD-binding antibodies to serum neutralization demonstrates that mapping mutations that escape
these antibodies is crucial for understanding the potential for SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution.
Complete mapping of RBD mutations that reduce binding by sera collected ~1 month post-symptom
onset
To completely map RBD mutations that reduce binding by polyclonal serum antibodies, we extended a
deep-mutational scanning method previously developed to identify mutations that escape binding by
monoclonal antibodies ​(Greaney et al., 2020)​. Briefly, we used libraries of yeast that each expressed a
different RBD variant on their surface. The library covered nearly all possible single amino-acid
mutations to the RBD ​(Starr et al., 2020b)​. We incubated these yeast libraries with polyclonal human
sera, and used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with an IgG/IgA/IgM secondary antibody to
enrich for yeast expressing RBD mutants that bound appreciably less serum antibodies than
unmutagenized RBD (​Figure S2A-C​). We then used deep sequencing to measure the frequency of
each RBD mutation in the initial population and the antibody-escape FACS bin. ​We quantified the effect
of each RBD mutation on serum antibody binding as that mutation’s “escape fraction,” which is the
fraction of all yeast cells expressing RBD with that mutation that fall into the FACS escape bin. These
escape fractions range from 0 (no effect on serum antibody binding) to 1 (all cells with this mutation are
in the antibody-escape bin) ​(​Figure S2A-C​) ​(Greaney et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020b)​. All mapping
experiments were performed in biological duplicate using independently constructed RBD mutant
libraries; the replicates were highly correlated (​Figure S2D,E​), and we report the average
measurements across the two libraries throughout.
We began by mapping mutations that reduced binding by serum antibodies in samples collected
from 11 individuals at approximately 30 days post-symptom onset (range 15–61 days). These samples
had neutralizing titers against lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the G614 variant of the SARS-CoV-2
spike that ranged from 140 to 30,000, with the extent of neutralization attributable to RBD-targeting
antibodies ranging from 63% to 99% (first time point for subjects shown in orange in ​Figure 1B​). ​We
quantified each RBD mutation’s escape fraction and visualized the results using “escape maps,” which
are logo plots where the height of each letter is proportional to that mutation’s escape fraction (​Figure
2A, S2A​). Interactive versions of these escape maps are at
https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera​.
Although the exact effects of mutations on serum antibody binding varied widely across
individuals, the escape maps revealed several common patterns. Mutations that strongly reduced
binding fell in one of three discrete regions of the RBD: the receptor-binding ridge within the
receptor-binding motif (RBM), a loop in the RBM opposite the ridge (spanning sites 443–450, and the
structurally adjacent sites at 494–501), or a surface patch in the core RBD (​Figure 2B​). The
receptor-binding ridge and 443–450 loop are also targeted by many potently neutralizing antibodies,

including the two antibodies in the Regeneron cocktail ​(Greaney et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Starr
et al., 2020a)​. The core RBD epitope is targeted by monoclonal antibodies that tend to be less potently
neutralizing but more broadly cross-reactive to SARS-like coronaviruses ​(Barnes et al., 2020a; Piccoli
et al., 2020; Yuan et al.; Zost et al., 2020a)​. In particular, binding by all 11 samples was reduced by
mutations at site F456, and binding by most samples (9 of 11) was reduced by mutations at site E484
(​Figure 2A​). Both of these sites are within the receptor-binding ridge epitope. Notably, E484 is a site at
which mutations have recently been demonstrated to reduce neutralization by several monoclonal
antibodies and sera ​(Andreano et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020a; Weisblum et al.,
2020)​.
We grouped the samples into several classes based on which mutations most strongly reduced
serum antibody binding (​Figure 3 ​and the interactive visualizations at
https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera/​). Binding by 6 of the 11 samples
was reduced primarily by mutations in the receptor-binding ridge. For instance, binding by serum
antibodies from subject B (day 26) was most strongly affected by mutations at sites F456 and E484
(​Figure 2, 3A​). Binding by three samples was strongly reduced by mutations across a broader swath of
the RBM, including the 443–450 loop (​Figure 3B​). An example is subject G (day 18), which was
strongly affected by mutations at sites 443–450 in addition to F456 and E484. Binding by two samples
was most affected by mutations in the core RBD epitope (​Figure 3C​). The sites where mutations
reduced binding by these core-RBD targeting sera clustered around the lipid-binding pocket in the
RBD, where binding of free fatty acids may contribute to locking spike into a “closed” conformation
(Carrique et al., 2020; Toelzer et al., 2020)​. Notably, for the sample from subject K (day 29), no single
RBD mutation had more than a small effect on serum antibody binding (​Figures 2, 3D​).
There are some regions of the RBD where mutations did not strongly affect serum antibody
binding for any sample in our panel. These regions include the sites near the 343 glycan that are
targeted by the SARS-CoV-1 cross-reactive antibody S309 ​(Pinto et al., 2020)​, and the region near
residue E465 on the “lateral” side of the RBD, which to our knowledge is not an epitope for any known
neutralizing antibodies (​Figure 3E​) ​(Barnes et al., 2020a; Greaney et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020;
Starr et al., 2020b)​. Antibodies targeting these two regions may be rare, have low binding avidity in the
context of polyclonal serum, or be subdominant relative to other RBD epitopes ​(Barnes et al., 2020b;
Piccoli et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020)​.
How mutations affect serum antibody binding can shift over time in the same individual
Next, we examined how the RBD mutations that affect serum antibody binding change over time as an
individual’s immune response matures. We speculated that such changes might occur because other
studies have shown that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies become more somatically hypermutated and less
clonal in the months following recovery from infection ​(Gaebler et al., 2020; Nielsen et al., 2020; Rodda
et al., 2020)​. Moreover, we reasoned that mapping mutations that affect serum antibody binding several
months after infection would be relevant for determining which viral mutations might alter the
effectiveness of immunity if these individuals were re-exposed to a distinct SARS-CoV-2 variant in the
future.
We thus performed escape mapping for samples collected at later time points (76–121 days
post-symptom onset) from all 11 individuals for whom we had characterized serum antibody binding at
the ~1 month time point. For some but not all individuals there were changes over time in how binding
was affected by RBD mutations (​Figures 4, S3, S4​ and interactive visualizations at
https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera​)​(Hilton et al., 2020)​.
Specifically, for over half of the 11 individuals there was little change in which RBD mutations
affected serum antibody binding (​Figures 4A, S3, S4​). For two individuals, antibody binding became

more broad and less affected by any single RBD mutation (​Figures 4B, S3, S4​). For one individual,
mutations in the 443–450 loop had a much larger effect on binding by serum antibodies from the later
time compared to the earlier time (​Figure 4C, S3, S4​). Finally, for one individual, there was a strong
narrowing of the response, with no single RBD mutation having a large effect on binding by sera from
the early time point, but mutations at F456 and to a lesser extent E484 having large effects at the later
time point (​Figure 4D, S3, S4​). In summary, while the specificity of serum antibody binding is often
maintained over time, in some individuals the specificity broadens to become relatively unaffected by
any single RBD mutation, while in other individuals the specificity narrows so that single mutations have
a greater impact.
However, there was no clear relationship between changes in the fine specificity of antibody
binding and overall serum neutralizing activity. For instance, subject B and subject C maintained similar
binding specificities over time (​Figure 4A​), even though the neutralization titers of both subjects’ sera
decreased (​Figure 1B​). Similarly, subject D showed major changes in binding specificity over time
(​Figure 4B​), although this change in specificity was not accompanied by a substantial change in overall
serum neutralization titer.
For some sera, RBD mutations that reduce antibody binding strongly reduce neutralization
To determine how mutations that reduced serum antibody binding to the RBD affected viral
neutralization, we characterized a subset of mutations in neutralization assays with spike-pseudotyped
lentiviral particles. For these assays, we chose mutations that our mapping showed had substantial
effects on serum antibody binding by samples from multiple individuals, and prioritized mutations
present in circulating isolates of SARS-CoV-2.
In many cases, single mutations that were mapped to strongly reduce serum antibody binding
also greatly reduced viral neutralization. The effect of mutations at site E484 were particularly striking
(​Figure 5A,B​). For several sera, the neutralization titer dropped by over an order of magnitude against
viruses carrying spikes with E484 mutated to K, Q, or P. For instance, these three mutations to E484
caused 35- to 60-fold decreases in the neutralization titer of the sample collected from subject C at day
32 (​Figure 5A,D​). As another example, both E484K and E484Q reduced neutralization by the serum
from subject B (day 26) by 10-fold, the same reduction achieved by depleting the serum of all
RBD-binding antibodies (​Figure 5A,D​).
While mutations at E484 generally caused the largest drops in neutralization, other mutations
mapped to decrease antibody binding for specific sera also affected neutralization. A dramatic example
was G446V, which caused a ~30-fold decrease in the neutralization titer of subject G at day 18 (​Figure
5B,D​). Mutations G485R and S494P also caused lesser but still appreciable (~3 to 5-fold) decreases in
neutralization titer for a few sera (​Figure 5B​).
In general, there was good concordance between the mapping of how mutations affected serum
antibody binding and their impact on viral neutralization. This concordance can be seen in ​Figure
5A-C​, where the violin plots show the distributions of the effects of mutations on serum antibody
binding across all sites. The sites in the upper tails of these violin plots are ones where mutations had
large effects on binding, and mutations to such sites usually reduced neutralization. The one major
exception was site F456, where mutations often caused large reductions in binding but never
appreciably affected neutralization (​Figure 2A, 5A-C​). This discrepancy between the binding and
neutralization effects of mutations is not because antibodies targeting this region are inherently
non-neutralizing or unaffected by mutations at site 456, as F456A and F456K disrupt neutralization by
two monoclonal antibodies with epitopes that include F456 ​(Greaney et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Starr
et al., 2020a; Zost et al., 2020a)​ (​Figure S5B​). Rather, we hypothesize that the discrepancy is because
we mapped how mutations affected binding using isolated RBD, but in virus the RBD is in the context of

full spike, where it can be positioned in either a “down” or “up” conformation ​(Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp
et al., 2020)​. All sites where mutations that reduced binding also affected neutralization are accessible
in both the “down” and “up” conformations, but F456 is only accessible in the “up” conformation.
Because the RBD is usually in the “down” conformation ​(Cai et al., 2020; Ke et al., 2020; Walls et al.,
2020)​, we speculate that while sites accessible in this conformation can be targeted by neutralizing
antibodies, they may be subdominant in the context of polyclonal serum binding to full spike even if
they are dominant when assaying binding to isolated RBD.
The neutralization assays also validated one of the most notable findings from the mapping: that
the antigenic effects of mutations varied markedly across samples from different individuals. For
several samples, the maps of binding escape were relatively “flat” with no mutations having
disproportionately large effects, and for these samples no tested mutations substantially affected
neutralization (​Figure 5C​). Additionally, sometimes the effects of mutations on neutralization changed
over time for the same individual. Such a temporal change was especially notable for subject G:
mapping of the day 18 sample showed a strong effect of mutations centered around G446, but by day
94 the escape map had flattened (​Figure 4B​). Concordant with the maps, G446V greatly decreased
neutralization by subject G’s day 18 sample, but had only a modest effect on the day 94 sample, even
when combined with mutations at several other key sites (​Figure 5B,D​). These facts highlight how the
antigenic effects of mutations vary across people and time, and suggest that some sera are more
resistant than others to erosion by viral evolution.
RBD mutations that reduce serum binding and neutralization in circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates
To determine the extent that mutations we mapped to affect serum binding are present among
circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates, we determined the frequency of mutations at each RBD site among
all SARS-CoV-sequences in GISAID as of Dec-23-2020. We then compared these frequencies to the
effects of mutations at each site on serum antibody binding, averaged across all samples (​Figure 6A​).
It is immediately apparent that the most concerning site of mutations is E484 (​Figure 6A​). E484
is the site where mutations tend to have the largest effect on serum antibody binding to the RBD, and
our neutralization assays (​Figure 5A,D​) and similar experiments by others ​(Andreano et al., 2020; Liu
et al., 2020b; Weisblum et al., 2020)​ show that mutations to site E484 reduce the neutralization potency
of some human sera by >10 fold, although other sera are unaffected by mutations at this site. Over
0.1% of all sequenced isolates have mutations at this site. Of special note, E484K is present in recently
described lineages in South Africa (S.501Y.V2) and Brazil (descended from the B.1.1.28 lineage)
(Tegally et al., 2020; Voloch et al., 2020)​; another mutation at the same site (E484Q) has also been
found in a smaller number of human isolates (​Figure 6B​). Two other RBD mutations, K417N and
N501Y, co-occur with E484K in the S.501Y.V2 South African lineage ​(Tegally et al., 2020)​. K417N
escapes neutralization by some monoclonal antibodies ​(Greaney et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020a)​, but
mutations to site 417 only modestly affected binding by a few of the samples we assayed (the largest
effects were for the last time point for subjects A and J, see ​Figure S3​). N501Y increases affinity for
ACE2 ​(Starr et al., 2020b)​ and is also present in a recently described U.K. lineage (B.1.1.7) that may
have increased transmissibility ​(Kemp et al., 2020a; Public Health England, 2020; Rambaut et al.,
2020)​. Although other mutations at N501 have modest effects on binding by some monoclonal
antibodies ​(Greaney et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020a)​, mutations at N501 do not strongly affect binding
by any sera we tested (​Figures 2A, S3​).
Several other sites where we mapped mutations to affect serum antibody binding for a few
samples also have low-level variation (<0.1%) among circulating viruses (​Figure 6A-C​). These include
site G446, where the G446V mutation reduced neutralization by one sample by >10 fold (​Figure 5B,D​).
Other key sites with circulating variation where mutations impact binding by some samples are

indicated in ​Figure 6​. Notably, site F456, where mutations consistently affect serum antibody binding
but not neutralization, has little variation among circulating viruses (​Figure 6A​).
The four mutations that have the highest frequency among sequenced viruses (S477N, N439K,
N501Y, and Y453F; see ​Figure 6B​) do not strongly affect serum antibody binding by any samples we
tested. As mentioned above, N501Y increases affinity for ACE2, is present in the B.1.1.7 U.K. lineage
(Kemp et al., 2020a)​, and is in the epitope defined by the “443–450 loop” (​Figure 2B,3B​)—but does not
impact binding by any samples we tested, a result corroborated by live-virus neutralization assays
(Menachery, 2020)​. Y453F and N439K both also increase affinity for ACE2 ​(Starr et al., 2020b;
Thomson et al., 2020)​, and both escape some monoclonal antibodies ​(Baum et al., 2020; Starr et al.,
2020a; Thomson et al., 2020)​ but neither greatly impact serum antibody binding by the samples we
tested. Finally, S477N also reduces neutralization by some monoclonal antibodies ​(Liu et al., 2020b)​,
but did not greatly affect binding by the samples we tested.
In summary, our results suggest that E484 is the site of most concern for viral mutations that
impact binding and neutralization by polyclonal serum antibodies targeting the RBD. However,
mutations at the other serum antibody epitopes (e.g., the 443–450 loop and residues around 484 such
as 455, 485, 486, and 490) are also worth monitoring, since they also have antigenic impacts.
Discussion
We comprehensively mapped how mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD affected binding by the
antibodies in convalescent human serum. One major result is that serum antibody binding is
predominantly affected by mutations at just a few dominant epitopes in the RBD. In particular, E484 is
the site in the RBD where mutations usually have the largest effect on binding and
neutralization—possibly because E484 is often targeted by antibodies that utilize heavy-chain germline
genes that are common among anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, IGHV3-53 and IGHV3-66 ​(Barnes et
al., 2020a; Greaney et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020; Zost et
al., 2020b)​. Mutations at other structurally adjacent sites in the RBD’s receptor binding ridge (e.g.,
L455, F456, G485, F486, and F490) can also have substantial antigenic effects. Another major epitope
centered on the loop formed by residues 443–450 in the RBD’s receptor-binding motif, and mutations in
this epitope sometimes strongly affect serum antibody neutralization. A third epitope is in the core of the
RBD distal from the receptor-binding motif, although mutations here tend to have smaller effects on
serum antibody binding. Notably, RBD mutations reported by other studies to have large effects on
serum neutralization are also in the epitope centered around E484 or in the 443–450 loop ​(Andreano et
al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020)​.
While the major serum epitopes are targeted by many well-characterized monoclonal antibodies
(Barnes et al., 2020a; Baum et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020a)​,
there are also sites where mutations that escape monoclonal antibodies have little effect on serum
antibody binding for any sample we tested. For instance, mutations in the S309 epitope footprint ​(Pinto
et al., 2020)​ and at sites of escape from antibody C135 (e.g., R346 and N440) ​(Barnes et al., 2020a;
Weisblum et al., 2020)​ had minimal effects on serum antibody binding (​Figures 3, S3​). This lack of
concordance between the epitopes of serum and monoclonal antibodies is consistent with other studies
reporting that the specificities of potent monoclonal antibodies often do not recapitulate the sera from
which they were isolated ​(Barnes et al., 2020b; Weisblum et al., 2020)​. These antibodies may be rare in
polyclonal sera or the epitopes they target may be subdominant ​(Piccoli et al., 2020)​. However, these
subdominant epitopes may become more important as SARS-CoV-2 evolves: after mutations at
immunodominant sites such as E484 partially erode serum antibody neutralization, the remaining
neutralization is presumably due to antibodies targeting previously subdominant epitopes.

Another key finding is that there is extensive person-to-person variation in how mutations affect
serum antibody binding and neutralization. For instance, the neutralizing activity of several samples
was reduced by >10-fold by single mutations to site E484, but a few samples were essentially
unaffected by E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations at sites in the 443–450 loop (e.g., G446V) caused a
large drop in serum antibody binding and neutralization for some samples, but had little effect on
others. This inter-individual heterogeneity is further compounded by the fact that the effects of
mutations sometimes changed over time for samples longitudinally collected from the same individual.
These temporal changes could be due to a disproportionate decay in one dominant antibody clonotype,
or a relative increase in antibodies targeting other epitopes ​(Gaebler et al., 2020)​.
There are several limitations to our study. Most importantly, we only examined mutations to the
RBD. While we and others ​(Piccoli et al., 2020; Steffen et al., 2020)​ have shown that RBD-binding
antibodies contribute the majority of the serum neutralizing activity of most convalescent human sera
and plasma, antibodies also target other regions of the spike. For example, mutations and deletions in
the NTD can affect serum antibody neutralization ​(Andreano et al., 2020; Kemp et al., 2020b; Liu et al.,
2020a; McCarthy et al., 2020; Voss et al., 2020)​, and are certainly of great importance. In addition, we
only mapped samples from 11 individuals at two time points. Given the substantial inter- and
intra-individual heterogeneity, mapping more samples may identify additional sites of importance. On a
technical level, we assayed binding of antibodies to isolated RBD expressed by yeast, which implies
several limitations. First, we are unable to map the effects of mutations that alter the spike’s overall
conformation or affect antibodies spanning quaternary epitopes ​(Barnes et al., 2020a)​. Second, our
mapping likely overestimates the contributions of antibodies that bind epitopes that are more accessible
on isolated RBD than in the context of full spike (e.g., F456). Finally, the N-linked glycans on
yeast-expressed proteins are more mannose-rich than those on mammalian-expressed proteins
(Hamilton et al., 2003)​, which could affect measurements of how N-linked glycans affect antibody
binding. However, the general consistency of our mapping with our pseudovirus neutralization assays
and the serum-escape mutations reported by others suggest that our study successfully defines the
major RBD epitopes of convalescent human serum antibodies.
The comprehensive nature of our mapping makes it possible to begin to assess which
circulating RBD mutations are likely to have the greatest impact on human immunity. In particular,
emerging lineages in South Africa and Brazil carrying the E484K mutation will have greatly reduced
susceptibility to neutralization by the polyclonal serum antibodies of some individuals. In contrast, the
N501Y mutation present in the U.K. lineage is unlikely to greatly affect neutralization by most human
sera, although it could contribute to increased viral titer or enhanced transmissibility ​(Kidd et al., 2020;
Public Health England, 2020)​. The NTD deletions in this lineage, however, may have an antigenic
effect ​(Andreano et al., 2020; Kemp et al., 2020b; McCarthy et al., 2020)​. More generally, our serum
antibody mapping can be used with other functional characterization to assess the likely antigenic
impacts of additional viral mutations that emerge in the future.
Our mapping also reveals broader features of antibody immunity that are relevant to
SARS-CoV-2 evolution. One reason that influenza virus undergoes such rapid antigenic evolution is
that neutralizing human immunity often focuses on just a few residues in hemagglutinin, such that a
single mutation can dramatically reduce neutralization ​(Lee et al., 2019)​. In contrast, while measles
virus can escape neutralization by monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal serum targets multiple
co-dominant measles epitopes, meaning that no single mutation has a large effect on neutralization
(Muñoz-Alía et al., 2020)​. Our results show that polyclonal antibody immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
is sometimes focused as for influenza, but in other cases more broadly targets the RBD in a way that
mitigates the effect of any single mutation. This heterogeneity in the antigenic impacts of RBD
mutations implies that the immunity of different individuals will be impacted differently by viral evolution.

It also suggests that an important area for future work is understanding how viral mutations impact
vaccine-elicited immunity, and using this knowledge to design vaccines that are robust to viral antigenic
evolution.

SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human sera
Plasma samples were previously described ​(Crawford et al., 2020a)​ and collected as part of a prospective
longitudinal cohort study of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Seattle, WA February-July 2020. See

(isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, Genbank accession number MN908947, residues N331-T531) and contain 3,804 of the
3,819 possible amino-acid mutations, with >95% present as single mutants. Each RBD variant was linked to a
unique 16-nucleotide barcode sequence to facilitate downstream sequencing. As previously described, libraries
were sorted for RBD expression and ACE2 binding to eliminate RBD variants that are completely misfolded or
non-functional (i.e., lacking modest ACE2 binding affinity) ​(Greaney et al., 2020)​.
FACS sorting of yeast libraries to select mutants with reduced binding by polyclonal sera
Serum mapping experiments were performed in biological duplicate using the independent mutant RBD libraries,
as previously described for monoclonal antibodies ​(Greaney et al., 2020)​, with the following modifications: Mutant
yeast libraries induced to express RBD were washed and incubated with serum at a range of dilutions for 1 h at
room temperature with gentle agitation. For each serum, we chose a sub-saturating dilution such that the amount
of fluorescent signal due to serum antibody binding to RBD was approximately equal across sera. The exact
dilution used for each serum is given in S
​ upplementary Table 2​. After the serum incubations, the libraries were
secondarily labeled with 1:100 FITC-conjugated anti-MYC antibody (Immunology Consultants Lab, CYMC-45F) to
label for RBD expression and 1:200 Alexa-647- or DyLight-405-conjugated goat anti-human-IgA+IgG+IgM
(Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-605-064 or 109-475-064, respectively) to label for bound serum antibodies. A
flow cytometric selection gate was drawn to capture 3–6% of the RBD mutants with the lowest amount of serum
binding for their degree of RBD expression (​Figure S1A-C​). We also measured what fraction of cells expressing
unmutated RBD fell into this gate when stained with 1x and 0.1x the concentration of serum. For each sample,
approximately 10 million RBD+ cells (range 7.4e6 to 1.7e7 cells) were processed on the cytometer, with between
2e5 and 8e5 serum-escaped cells collected per sample (see percentages in ​Supplementary Table 2​).
Antibody-escaped cells were grown overnight in SD-CAA (6.7g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base, 5.0g/L Casamino acids,
1.065 g/L MES acid, and 2% w/v dextrose) to expand cells prior to plasmid extraction.
DNA extraction and Illumina sequencing
Plasmid samples were prepared from 30 OD units (1.6e8 cfus) of pre-selection yeast populations and
approximately 5 OD units (~3.2e7 cfus) of overnight cultures of serum-escaped cells (Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid
Miniprep II) as previously described ​(Greaney et al., 2020)​. The 16-nucleotide barcode sequences identifying
each RBD variant were amplified by PCR and prepared for Illumina sequencing as described in ​(Starr et al.,
2020b)​. Barcodes were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 3500 with 50 bp single-end reads. To minimize noise
from inadequate sequencing coverage, we ensured that each antibody-escape sample had at least 2.5x as many
post-filtering sequencing counts as FACS-selected cells, and reference populations had at least 2.5e7
post-filtering sequencing counts.
Analysis of deep sequencing data to compute each mutation’s serum escape fraction
Escape fractions were computed as described in ​(Greaney et al., 2020)​, with minor modifications as noted below.
We used the ​dms_variants​ package (​https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_variants/​, version 0.8.2) to process
Illumina sequences into counts of each barcoded RBD variant in each pre-sort and antibody-escape population
using the barcode/RBD look-up table from ​(Starr et al., 2020a)​.
For each serum selection, we computed the “escape fraction” for each barcoded variant using the deep
sequencing counts for each variant in the original and serum-escape populations and the total fraction of the
library that escaped antibody binding via the formula provided in ​(Greaney et al., 2020)​. These escape fractions
represent the estimated fraction of cells expressing that specific variant that fall in the serum escape bin, such that
a value of 0 means the variant is always bound by serum and a value of 1 means that it always escapes serum
binding. We then applied a computational filter to remove variants with low sequencing counts or highly
deleterious mutations that might cause antibody escape simply by leading to poor expression of properly folded
RBD on the yeast cell surface ​(Greaney et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020b)​. Specifically, we removed variants that
had (or contained mutations with) ACE2 binding scores < −2.35 or expression scores < −1, using the variant- and
mutation-level deep mutational scanning scores from ​(Starr et al., 2020b)​. Note that these filtering criteria are
slightly more stringent than those used in ​(Greaney et al., 2020)​ but are identical to those used in (​ Starr et al.,
2020a)​.

We next deconvolved variant-level escape scores into escape fraction estimates for single mutations
using global epistasis models ​(Otwinowski et al., 2018)​ implemented in the ​dms_variants​ package, as detailed
at (​https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_variants/dms_variants.globalepistasis.html​) and described in ​(Greaney et al.,
2020)​. The reported scores throughout the paper are the average across the libraries; these scores are also in
Supplementary Table 3​. Correlations in final single-mutant escape scores are shown in ​Figure S2D-E​.
For plotting and analyses that required identifying RBD sites of “strong escape” (e.g., choosing which
sites to show in logo plots in ​Figures 2A,B, and S4​ or label in ​Figure 4B​), we considered a site to mediate strong
escape if the total escape (sum of mutation-level escape fractions) for that site exceeded the median across sites
by >5 fold, and was at least 5% of the maximum for any site. We also included site K417, which did not meet this
threshold but was of interest due to its frequency among circulating viruses.
Full documentation of the computational analysis is at
https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera​.
Generation of pseudotyped lentiviral particles
We used spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles that were generated essentially as described in ​(Crawford et al.,
2020b)​, using a codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike from Wuhan-Hu-1 that contains a 21-amino-acid deletion at
the end of the cytoplasmic tail ​(Crawford et al., 2020a)​ and the D614G mutation that is now predominant in human
SARS-CoV-2 ​(Korber et al., 2020)​. The plasmid encoding this spike, HDM_Spikedelta21_D614G, is available
from Addgene (#158762), and the full sequence is at (​https://www.addgene.org/158762​). Point mutations were
introduced into the RBD of this plasmid via site-directed mutagenesis.
To generate these spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles ​(Crawford et al., 2020b)​, 6e5 293T cells per well
were seeded in 6-well plates in 2 mL D10 growth media (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM
l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). 24h later, cells were transfected using BioT
transfection reagent (Bioland Scientific, Paramount, CA, USA) with a Luciferase_IRES_ZsGreen backbone,
Gag/Pol lentiviral helper plasmid, and wildtype or mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike plasmids. Media was changed to
fresh D10 at 24 h post-transfection. At 60 h post-transfection, viral supernatants were collected, filtered through a
0.45 μm SFCA low protein-binding filter, and stored at −80°C.
Neutralization assays
293T-ACE2 cells (BEI NR-52511) were seeded at 1.25e4 cells per well in 50 μL D10 in poly-L-lysine coated,
black-walled, 96-well plates (Greiner 655930). 24 h later, pseudotyped lentivirus supernatants were diluted to
~200,000 relative luciferase units (RLU) per well (determined by titering as previously described ​(Crawford et al.,
2020b)​) and incubated with a range of dilutions of sera for 1 h at 37 °C. 100 μL of the virus-antibody mixture was
then added to cells.
At ∼70 h post-infection, luciferase activity was measured using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System
(Promega, E2610). Fraction infectivity of each serum antibody-containing well was calculated relative to a
“no-serum” well inoculated with the same initial viral supernatant (containing wildtype or mutant RBD) in the same
row of the plate. We used the ​neutcurve​ package (​https://jbloomlab.github.io/neutcurve​) to calculate the
inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) and the neutralization titer 50% (NT50), which is simply 1/IC50, of each serum
against each virus by fitting a Hill curve with the bottom fixed at 0 and the top fixed at 1. The full neutralization
curves are in ​Figure S5​.
Depletion of RBD-binding antibodies from polyclonal sera
Magnetic beads conjugated to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (AcroBiosystems, MBS-K002) were prepared according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Beads were resuspended in ultrapure water at 1 mg beads/mL and a magnet was
used to wash the beads 3 times in PBS with 0.05% BSA. Beads were then resuspended in PBS with 0.05% BSA
at 1 mg beads /mL. Beads (manufacturer-reported binding capacity of 10-40 ug/mL anti-RBD antibodies) were
incubated with human serum at a 3:1 ratio beads:serum (150 uL beads + 50 uL serum), rotating overnight at 4°C.
A magnet was used to separate antibodies that bind RBD from the supernatant, and the supernatant (the
post-RBD antibody depletion sample) was removed. A mock depletion (pre-depletion sample) was performed by
adding 150 uL of PBS + 0.05% BSA and incubating rotating overnight at 4°C. For the neutralization assays on

these sera depleted of RBD-binding antibodies shown in ​Figure S1C​; the reported serum dilution is corrected for
the dilution incurred by the depletion process.
Measurement of serum binding to RBD or spike by ELISA
The IgG ELISAs for spike protein and RBD were conducted as previously described ​(Dingens et al., 2020)​.
Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with recombinant spike and RBD antigens described in ​(Dingens et al., 2020)​ at
2 μg/mL. Five 3-fold serial dilutions of sera beginning at 1:100 were performed in phosphate-buffered saline with
0.1% Tween nonfat dry milk. Dilution series of the “synthetic” sera comprised of the anti-RBD antibody
rREGN10987 ​(Hansen et al., 2020)​ or anti-NTD antibody 4A8 ​(Chi et al., 2020)​ and pooled pre-pandemic human
sera from 2017-2018 (Gemini Biosciences; nos. 100–110, lot H86W03J; pooled from 75 donors) were performed
such that the anti-spike antibody was present at a highest concentration of 0.25 μg/mL. Both antibodies were
recombinantly produced by Genscript. The rREGN10987 is that used in ​(Starr et al., 2020a)​ and the variable
domain heavy and light chain sequences for r4A8 were obtained from Genbank GI 1864383732 and 1864383733
(Chi et al., 2020)​ and produced on a human IgG1 and IgK background, respectively. Pre-pandemic serum alone,
without anti-RBD antibody depletion, was used as a negative control, averaged over 2 replicates. The area under
the curve (AUC) was calculated as the area under the titration curve with the serial dilutions on a log-scale.
Analysis of RBD mutations among circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates
All 283,908 spike sequences on GISAID as of Dec-23-2020 were downloaded and aligned via mafft ​(Katoh and
Standley, 2013)​. Sequences from non-human origins and sequences containing gap characters or excessive
mutations were removed, leaving 263,217 sequences. The code that performs this alignment and filtering is at
https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera/blob/main/results/summary/gisaid_rbd_mut
ations.md​. The counts and frequencies of mutations at each RBD site were then computed using this filtered
sequence set. We acknowledge all GISAID contributors for sharing sequencing data
(​https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera/blob/main/data/gisaid_hcov-19_acknowled
gement_table_2020_12_30.pdf​).
Sites and mutations highlighted in ​Figure 6​ were chosen as follows. Sites in the RBM containing the 4
RBD mutations with the highest cumulative frequency (S477N, N439K, N501Y, and Y453F), the two sites with the
highest total escape (F456 and E484), and sites that have >=30 variant counts in GISAID and are sites of strong
escape for any serum, are labeled in ​Figure 6A​. The labeled sites are colored according to epitope region as in
Figure 2​. Figure 6B highlights the 4 most frequent mutations and also any mutations at the other sites labeled in
Figure 6A​ with at least 10 or more counts in GISAID. ​Figure 6C​ highlights sites where mutations have a strong
effect on binding of at least 1 serum or have circulating variation with >50 counts in GISAID. Site K417 was also
of interest due to the presence of the K417N mutation in a recently identified lineage ​(Tegally et al., 2020)​, and
thus is also highlighted in each panel in F
​ igure 6​.
Data visualization
The static logo plot visualizations of the escape maps in the paper figures were created using the ​dmslogo
package (​https://jbloomlab.github.io/dmslogo​ , version 0.3.2) and in all cases the height of each letter indicates
the escape fraction for that amino-acid mutation calculated as described above. For each serum, the y-axis is
scaled to be the greatest of (a) the maximum site-wise escape metric observed for that serum, (b) 20x the median
site-wise escape fraction observed across all sites for that serum, or (c) an absolute value of 1.0 (to appropriately
scale sera that are not “noisy” but for which no mutation has a strong effect on serum binding). Site C361 has
been removed from the plots, because while mutations at this site reduce serum binding, these mutations ablate a
disulfide bond in the core RBD that is important for proper folding of the RBD and likely result in a grossly
misfolded RBD and do not represent specific serum escape mutations. Site K417 has been added to ​Figure S3
due to its frequency among circulating viruses. The code that generates these logo plot visualizations is available
at
https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera/blob/main/results/summary/escape_profiles.

In many of the visualizations (e.g., ​Figures 2, 4, 6A, S3, and S4​), the RBD sites are categorized by
epitope region (core-RBD epitope, receptor-binding ridge, or 443–450 loop) and colored accordingly. We define
the core-RBD epitope as residues 365–372+382–386, the receptor-binding ridge epitope to be residues
417+455+456+471–490, and the 443–450 loop epitope to be residues 443–452+494–501.
For the static structural visualizations in the paper figures, the RBD surface (PDB: 6M0J, ​(Lan et al.,

Figure 1​. ​RBD-binding antibodies are responsible for most of the neutralizing activity of human polyclonal
sera.​ ​(A)​ Change in binding of human sera to RBD and spike before and after depletion of RBD antibodies,
measured by ELISA area under the curve (AUC). The dashed orange line is binding of pre-pandemic pooled sera
collected in 2017-2018. Raw ELISA binding curves in ​Figure S1A​. ​(B)​ Neutralization titer 50% (NT50) of human
sera before and after depletion of RBD-binding antibodies. Legend is at left: filled and open circles are pre- and
post-depletion samples, respectively, connected by a line. Orange indicates sera for which we subsequently
mapped mutations that reduce binding. The numbers at right indicate the percent of all neutralizing activity
attributable to RBD-binding antibodies. Sera are sorted in descending order of percent of neutralization due to
RBD-binding antibodies, first by subject and then within subject. The dashed blue line is the limit of detection
(NT50 of 20). Points on this line have an NT50 <= 20, so the percent of neutralization due to RBD-binding
antibodies may be an underestimate for these sera. See ​Figure S1​ and ​Supplementary Table 1​ for additional
data including full ELISA and neutralization curves and numerical values plotted here.

Figure 2​.​ Complete maps of RBD mutations that reduce binding by polyclonal serum antibodies from 11
individuals. (A)​ The line plots at left indicate the total effect of all mutations at each site in the RBD on serum
antibody binding, with larger values indicating a greater reduction in antibody binding. The logo plots at right zoom
in on individual mutations at key sites (indicated by purple highlighting on the x-axis of the line plots). In these logo
plots, the height of each letter is that mutation’s escape fraction, so larger letters indicate mutations that cause a
greater reduction in antibody binding. Escape fractions are comparable across sites within a sample, but not

necessarily between samples due to the use of sample-specific FACS gates—therefore, for each serum, the
y-axis is scaled independently (see ​Methods​). Sites in the logo plots are colored by RBD epitope. ​(B)​ For coloring
of the logo plots, we designated three RBD epitopes based on the structural locations where mutations had large
effects on serum antibody binding. The images show the structure of the RBD bound to ACE2 (PDB 6M0J, ​(Lan
et al., 2020)​) in several representations. The receptor-binding-ridge epitope is dark blue, the epitope containing
the 443–450 loop is cyan, the core-RBD epitope is orange, the rest of the RBD is gray, and ACE2 is purple. For
the cartoon rendering in the top structure, alpha carbons for sites of strong binding-escape for any of the 11 sera
(i.e., all sites shown in the logo plots) are represented as spheres. Interactive versions of these escape maps are

Figure 3. Regions of the RBD where mutations strongly reduced binding by the antibodies in sera
collected from 11 individuals. ​The total effect of mutations at each site (sum of escape fractions) are projected
onto the structure of the RBD (PDB 6M0J), with white indicating no effect of mutations at that site and red
indicating a large reduction in antibody binding. Two views of the RBD are shown: the surface of the RBD that is
buried in the “down” conformation, and the surface that is always exposed and accessible ​(Walls et al., 2020;
Wrapp et al., 2020)​. ​(A)​ For some individuals (typified by subject B), antibody binding is predominantly reduced by
mutations in the receptor-binding ridge, particularly at sites F456 and E484. ​(B)​ For some individuals (typified by
subject G), antibody binding is strongly reduced by mutations in the 443–450 loop of the RBM in addition to the
receptor-binding ridge. ​(C)​ For a few individuals (typified by subject J), antibody binding is affected by mutations in
the core RBD epitope around site P384. ​(D)​ Samples from the other eight individuals fall in one of the three
classes detailed in panels ​(A)​ to ​(C)​. For panels ​(A)​ to ​(D)​, the white-to-red coloring scale is set to span the same
range as the y-axis limits for that serum in ​Figure 2​. ​(E)​ Mutations in two major surface regions (the S309 epitope
and the sites near E465) do not strongly affect serum antibody binding for any of the subjects. Shown is a surface
representation of the RBD, with the 3 polyclonal serum epitopes colored as in ​Figure 2​. The S309 epitope and
region near E465 (“E465 patch”) are shown in pink and maroon. ACE2 is shown in a dark gray cartoon

Figure 5.​ ​Mutations mapped to reduce serum antibody binding often reduce viral neutralization. (A)​-​(C)
Violin plots at left show the distribution of how mutations at all sites in the RBD affect serum binding in the
mapping experiments. The plots at right then show the effects of tested mutations on neutralization (the
fold-change in neutralization inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50)). For instance, the top row in ​(A)​ shows that
mutations at E484 and F456 are mapped to reduce serum antibody binding for subject C at both day 32 and day
104, and that multiple different mutations at E484 but not F456 greatly reduced serum neutralization (e.g., a
nearly 100-fold increase in IC50 for E484K for the day 32 serum). Sites that are accessible in the down
conformation of the RBD in the context of full spike are indicated by red circles (e.g., E484), and sites that are

fold change in IC50s, the dashed gray line indicates a value of one (no change in neutralization), and the dotted
orange line indicates the change in inhibitory concentration if all RBD-binding antibodies are removed (see ​Figure

G446V, and G485R substantially reduce viral neutralization for some sera. For all neutralization curves used to
determine changes in neutralization plotted in ​(A)​-​(C)​, see ​Figure S5​. The y-axis limits in the violin plots are set

with spike D614-spike-pseudotyped lentivirus ​(Crawford et al., 2020a)​ and pre-depletion neutralization titers
measured with G614-spike-pseudotyped lentivirus (present study), Pearson’s R = 0.88. ​(E)​ Change in the amount
of neutralizing activity that is due to RBD-binding antibodies over time for each individual. Each point gives the
fold-change in neutralization inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) post- versus pre-depletion for plasma isolated at
the indicated time, such that larger values indicate that more of the neutralizing activity is due to RBD-binding
antibodies. Open circles represent samples for which the post-depletion NT50 was at the limit of detection, i.e.,
less than 20 (see ​Figure 1B​); these circles are therefore lower bounds in the fold-change in IC50.

antibody binding was detected using a IgA+IgG+IgM secondary antibody. We then used FACS to enrich for cells
expressing RBD that bound reduced levels of antibody, and used deep sequencing to quantify the frequency of
each mutation in the initial and “antibody escape” cell populations. We quantified the effect of each mutation as
the “escape fraction,” which represents the fraction of cells expressing RBD with that mutation that fell in the
“antibody escape” FACS bin. Escape fractions are represented in logo plots, with the height of each letter
proportional to the effect of that amino acid mutation on antibody binding. The site-level escape metric is the sum
of the escape fractions of all mutations at a site. Note that both experimental and computational filtering steps
were used to remove RBD mutants that were misfolded or completely unable to bind the ACE2 receptor (see
Methods​). ​(B)​ Representative plots of nested FACS gating strategy used for all serum selection experiments to

and the FACS scatter plots looked qualitatively similar between the two libraries. For information on the fraction of

Figure S5. Full curves for all assays testing how RBD mutations affected viral neutralization, related to
Figure 4. (A)​ The x-axis gives the serum dilution, and the y-axis gives the fraction of viral infectivity remaining at
that dilution. A different plot facet is shown for each serum (labeled by subject and day of collection) and assay
date. The neutralization curves were fit and plotted using ​neutcurve​ (​https://jbloomlab.github.io/neutcurve/​,

These IC50s were then used to determine the fold-change values plotted in ​Figure 5A-C​, comparing each mutant
to the wildtype run on the same assay date. The curves plotted in ​Figure 5D​ recapitulate data plotted in this
panel, but aggregate mutants across several assay dates and show the wildtype curve for just the first assays
date. This aggregation across assay dates is well supported since the wildtype was re-run on each assay date
and always yielded very similar IC50s for any given serum. ​(B)​ Neutralization curves for monoclonal antibodies
