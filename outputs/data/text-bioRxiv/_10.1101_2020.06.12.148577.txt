Abstract
Obesity is one of the biggest public health problems in the world, and its
pathophysiological characteristics include chronic inflammation with an increase in
various circulating inflammatory markers, such as acute inflammatory cytokines.
Complications in the respiratory tract are related to bodily problems, which lead to a
restriction of lung function due to reduced volume, inducing an increase in respiratory
work. SARS-CoV-2 has a high potential for contamination by respiratory secretions
and, therefore, obesity is one of the main risk factors for complications due to the
association established between obesity, chronic inflammation and respiratory infection.
The objective was to analyze the complex relationships between obesity and COVID-19
in a meta-analysis study using complex network modeling and the theoretical knockouts
technique. Here, we identify and justify through a mathematical analysis the
relationships between all the immunological agents added to the proposed
immunological networks, considered as a simple evident interaction, relationship,
influence, response, activation, based on our quantifiers. They performed the knockouts
of all 52 vertices in the COVID-19 network and obesity - regardless of the environment,
which would result in nonsense - and the COVID-19 infection network without
considering obesity. The stationary flow vector (flow profile), for some knockouts of
immunological interest in COVID-19 infections, was chosen IFNα, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17
and TNFα. This initial study pointed out the importance of chronic inflammation in the
obese individual as an important factor in potentiating the disease caused by covid-19
and, in particular, the importance on IL-17.

Keywords: Obesity, cytokines, SARS-CoV-2, inflammation, respiratory system.

1. Introduction
Obesity is one of the biggest public health problems in the world. The World
Health Organization (WHO) projected for 2025 about 2.3 billion overweight adults and
more than 700 million obese – with significant growth in Western Countries – , as in the
United States of America (USA), the prevalence of obesity has risen from 23% to
almost 40% in recent years, and in the United Kingdom, which has increased by
approximately 10% in 25 years [1,2].
One of the pathophysiological characteristics of the obese is a chronic
inflammation, with an increase in several circulating inflammatory markers, such as
acute inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, CRP (C-reactive protein), haptoglobin
(BULLO´ et al, 2003) , IL-1b, IL-8 and IL-10. This chronic inflammatory state acts
aggravating diseases such as dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension,
asthma and bronchitis [3].
Complications in the respiratory tract are related to body issues, which lead to a
restriction of lung function due to reduced volume, unrelated effects of lung and
bronchi, inducing an increase in respiratory work, expansion of torax, obstruction to
airflow and decreased peripheral oxygen saturation. In addition, we have an
inflammatory response that works synergistically aggravating the asthma, bronchitis
and pneumonia [4-7].
In late 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARSCoV-2), caused by the COVID-19 virus, have high potential for contamination through
respiratory secretions causing a pandemic [8]. The pathogen identified as a new RNA
involved in the beta coronavirus, similar to SARS-CoV [9-10] has caused thousands of
deaths worldwide [11]. Initially, the majority of those affected by the complications
shown in relation to age, being mainly elderly due to the presence of comorbidities,
which is associated with infections caused by the virus, increases the lethality, in the
same way observed if the obese manifest the same or greater risk [12,13].
During the H1N1 epidemic, diabetics and obese were considered to be more
prone to the risk of contamination and individuals with a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m had a higher
degree of complications [14]. Thus this situation is repeated again, where obese
individuals demonstrate to be part of the high-risk group of complications of COVID-19
with the need for hospitalization and intensive care, probably due to the increased risk
associated with the chronic diseases that obesity leads to [15].

Thereby, the ratio of the hospitalization rate among the patients identified with
COVID-19 was 4.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in the USA, in which the rates were higher
(13.8) among adults aged ≥ 65 years, of whom 89.3% had one or more underlying
conditions, with 48.3% being obese, in addition to conditions such as hypertension,
chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, which raise the
levels of intensive care [16].
Thus, obesity is one of the main risk factors for coronavirus complications [17],
due to the association established between obesity, chronic inflammation, and
respiratory infection. Considering such health problem scenario and this strong tool to
analyze complex networks, the aim was analyze the complex relations of obesity and
COVID-19 in a meta-analysis study using complex network modeling and the
theoretical knockouts technique [18]. Specifically we shall cover the following
purposes: a) To build a network of interactions between the most immediate and
relevant immunological agents that participates in the COVID-19 respiratory infection;
b) To made a similar network with COVID-19 respiratory infection and the
immunological factors considering the chronic inflammation state observed in obese
patients; c)To calculate, using the Theoretical Knockouts Method (TKM), the relative
importance of such immunological agents in such phenomena in both networks and
compare the results of this method in order to quantify how obesity interferes in the
COVID-19 infection in a metabolic level.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Data Assembly
This section indicates and justifies the relations between all immunological
agents (i. e., cells, molecules, etc) that will be added in the immunological networks
proposed above. The agents are considered as vertices and their relations as directed
edges in the network (i. e., graph). In immunological networks there is two ways for
those agents to interact: increasing or decreasing, so when the A increases the activation
of agent B, then an arrow will originate from A and terminate in B. On the other hand, if
A decreases the activation of B, then an arrow will originate from B and terminate in A
[18].
Additionally, since matter and energy must be conserved in the resulting
networks, we cannot allow any vertex to be a dead-end, that is, there is no biological
agent without an exit in the system (i. e., network). To deal with this situation, we insert

in the network an origin and a terminus. All vertices that have no arrow (edge) entering
it, will be connected to the origin – from the origin to these vertices. On the other hand,
all vertices that have no arrow leaving it will be connected to the terminus – from these
vertices to terminus. The origin and the terminus function as a section of a metabolic or
an immunological phenomenon – that is, the zone of interest for analysis and knockouts.
We cannot work with all possible interactions of the human body that COVID-19 and
obesity influence. This is very reasonable, since only the local and most immediate have
relevant and measurable impact in the phenomenon. Then, in a practical sense, both
origin and terminus are considered as an environment for the purpose of our study. The
environment consists in the set of less relevant interactions that we did not include in
the network.
The production of IFNα, IFNAβ and IFNγ are one of the first innate responses to
any viral infection. In this case, they are secreted by cells of the nasopharynx and
bronchiolar mucosa. IFNα and IFNβ are secreted primarily by the host cell infected,
whereas IFNγ is initially produced by macrophages and NK cells [19,20].
NK cells are the main mediators of innate immunity and, in general, expand
sufficiently to eliminate viruses in 4 to 6 days. These cells are stimulated by the three
Interferons. The interaction between NK cells and infected host cell promotes increased
secretion of IL-1, IL-2 and IFNγ by the host cell [21].
The viral RNA itself functions as a Pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPS), stimulating, among other cells, macrophages that, in addition to phagocytic
activities, will secrete a vast amount of substances, among them: IL-1, IL-18 (which
will increase secretion of IFNγ), IL-6, IL-12, TNF, NO, IL-10, IL-8. The association of
IL-18 with IL-12 will promote a decrease in IL-4, which will lead to less IgE and IgG1.
IL-8 will stimulate the phagocytic activity of Neutrophils associated with the
complement C3b, which will cause the secretion of Myeloperoxidases, Defensin,
Neutrophil elastase, Bacterial / permeability-increasing protein (BPI), Cathepsin,
Lactoferrin and Gelatinases [22,23].
Dendritic cells (DC) stimulated by the viral particle and interferons will activate
CD4 + T cells. The interaction between DC and CD4 + T (CD40 - CD40L) will activate
Tc (increased secretion of IFNγ, IL-10), B cells (secretion of TGF-β, Th17, IL-17 and
IL-10) and DC licensing. Being an important step in the progression of the response to
the viral agent [24,25].

Chronic inflammation in the obese is characterized by the constant circulation of
TNFα, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β (leptin), IL-17 and IL-18, secreted by adipose tissue
[26].
All the above stated interactions can be observed in the form of a complex
network in Fig. 1.
2.2. Summarization of the theoretical knockouts’ theory and technique
The relations (edges) must be considered as a simple evident interaction,
relation, influence, response, activation.
After the building of the network – which is, for our purposes, synonym of
graph. A graph is an ordered pair 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸) in which V is a set of vertices and E is a
subset of V composed by edges. The graph obtained by the above stated method is
connected. This means that given any pair of vertices A and B of a graph G, there is
always at least one directed path between them – a set of directed edges from A to B or
from B to A. This condition is mandatory for the calculations presented bellow.
Furthermore, such condition guarantees that all matter and energy that flows in the
network is conserved, which is a very reasonable condition.
Mathematically, we do not work with the graph object as it is designed in Figure
1, but we work with another way to represent it: the adjacency matrix of a graph. This
matrix is build with the following consideration: if there is a directed edge (arrow)
connecting the vertices iand j, then the value of the adjacency matrix’s element 𝑎𝑖𝑗
equals 1, and otherwise equals 0. In order to calculate the distribution of probabilities,
we must define the out-degree of a vertex. Let x be a vertex of the graph, the out-degree
of x is the number of edges that originates in x. Mathematically, and using the concept
of adjacency matrix, we have: the out-degree of vertex x is 𝑘𝑥𝑜𝑢𝑡 = ∑𝑗𝑎𝑖𝑗.
All vertices in the network interact dynamically, that is: every vertex generates a
signal of increase or decrease of biological activity. To model this dynamics, we used
the random walk in the network. The time variable is added to the network, when times
increases (discrete), a walker is created in the vertex environment; then if tis time, the
total number of walkers in the network is 𝑁(𝑡) = 𝑡. The walkers (i. e., particles,
information, stimuli, activation, etc) transits in the network from vertex to vertex, one
step per walker per unit of time. The amount (discrete) of walkers in vertex i in the time
tisdenoted by 𝜎𝑖(𝑡). Ergo, the relative number of walkers – for now on, information – in

𝜎𝑖(𝑡)

a vertex iis coined as local flux, defined as 𝑓𝑖(𝑡) = 𝑁(𝑡). Naturally, as times evolves, the

values of 𝑓𝑖(𝑡) for any ivertex in the network changes. If there are n vertices in the
network, then there will be n values of 𝑓𝑖 for every time t. Since we want to study the
general state of the network, we devised a state vector coined as Flux Vector given by
𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡) = (𝑓1(𝑡), 𝑓2(𝑡), 𝑓3(𝑡),…,𝑓𝑛 ‒ 1(𝑡), 𝑓𝑛(𝑡)).
Thus, for every time t, there is a flux vector 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡). However, we are interest
in generating a steady measurement, for this we want to compute the stationary state of
the dynamics performed upon the network. The stationary state of the flux vector for a
given network is a vector that does not change with the increase of time, denoted by
𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞) = (𝑓1'(𝑡→∞), 𝑓2'(𝑡→∞), 𝑓3'(𝑡→∞),…,𝑓𝑛 ‒ 1'(𝑡→∞), 𝑓𝑛'(𝑡→∞)). Taking
into account the stationary state 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞). In dynamics, there is three possible states
when times increases indefinitely: a) or it is periodic, that is: the vector 𝐹𝑉(𝐺) transits
within a set of states with a certain period; b) or it is chaotic, that is: the vector 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)
transits through a set of infinite states, never repeating; c) or it is stationary, there is
only one state as times increases.
In order to test these possible options, it is needed to define the transition matrix
T of a given graph G. This matrix is also known as probability matrix, because its
1

entries are probabilities given by 𝑝𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘𝑖 . This matrix has a algebraic interest in our
𝑜𝑢𝑡

study, since it can be used for model time, algebraically:𝑇.𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡) = 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡 + 1).
Every time the transition matrix operates upon 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡), times goes on in the dynamics
of

the

flux

in

the

network.

Equivalently:

𝑇𝑡.𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡 = 0) = 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡)⇒𝑇𝑡→∞.𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡 = 0) = 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞). It is possible to compute
numerically 𝑇𝑡→∞ as a limit, but we are interested in an exact evaluation of 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞)
. For this, we must consider the Perron-Frobenius features of the transition matrix T.
These features allows one to assert that there exists an unique stationary state
𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞), and it can be computed exactly by normalizing the eigenvector associated
to the major eigenvalue of T. It wasconsidering the set {𝜆𝑖} of eigenvalues of T. If the
matrix T met the following criteria, possessing the Perron-Frobenius features: a)

|𝜆1| ≥ |𝜆2| ≥ |𝜆3| ≥ …|𝜆𝑛 ‒ 1| ≥ |𝜆𝑛| and b) |𝜆1| = 1.
In our concrete case, since the graph is connected – due to the conservation of
matter and energy in the time –, it also met the Perron-Frobenius features. This means

that 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞) can be calculated exactly, with no need for numeric computation, by
normalizing the eigenvector associated to the biggest eigenvalue: 1.
An initial graphG represents the normal functioning of a phenomenon of
interest. When a knockout to a given vertex ifrom G, generates in this process a
knocked-out graph G’. Considering that the transition matrix T of G met the PerronFrobenius features, then we can compute the stationary state 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞). Since G’ is
derived from G, it will be also connected, ergo possessing the Perron-Frobenius
features. This means that we can also compute its stationary state 𝐹𝑉(𝐺')(𝑡→∞). Using
both 𝐹𝑉(𝐺') and 𝐹𝑉(𝐺) one can calculate the distance between such vectors, given by:
𝐷𝐺,𝐺' = 𝐹𝑉(𝐺)(𝑡→∞) ‒ 𝐹𝑉(𝐺')(𝑡→∞) = (Δ𝑓1,Δ𝑓2,Δ𝑓3,…,Δ𝑓𝑛 ‒ 1,Δ𝑓𝑛 = 𝑓𝑛).,

where

Δ𝑓𝑖 = lim [𝑓𝑖(𝑡) ‒ 𝑓𝑖'(𝑡)] for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛. Naturally, the values of Δ𝑓𝑖 can be positive or
𝑡→∞

negative; if it is positive, it means that the activation of the component is locally
increase by the knockout (KO); however, if it is negative, it means that the activation is
locally decreased. For each Δ𝑓𝑖, we can compute its relative error, by:

{

Δ𝑓𝑖

, 𝑓𝑜𝑟 Δ𝑓𝑖 > 0
𝑓𝑖(𝑡→∞)
𝜇𝑖 = |Δ𝑓𝑖|
, 𝑓𝑜𝑟 Δ𝑓𝑖 < 0.
𝑓𝑖'(𝑡→∞)
Collecting all relative error, we can average the set of all error and obtain the
𝑛

relative mean error, which is a global measure: 𝑀𝐺,𝐺' =

∑𝑖 = 1𝜇𝑖
𝑛

. This measure is an index,

that is, ranges from 0 to 1. If 𝑀𝐺,𝐺' is close to 0, then the particular KO was not
significant to the normal functioning of the graph G. On the other hand, if 𝑀𝐺,𝐺' is close
to 1, then the KO is very relevant to the normal functioning of the graph G.
It is important to note that our main measures are: the stationary state
𝐹𝑉(𝐺')(𝑡→∞) due to a particular KO (also known as Flux Profile): it shows how the
local fluxes change with particular KO; and the relative mean error 𝑀𝐺,𝐺', which
indicates how much a local KO can impact globally. Both quantifiers are very steady
and can easily be biologically interpreted in a variety of biological phenomena. Now,
based on our quantifiers we performed the knockouts of all 52 vertices in the COVID19 and obesity network – regardless of the environment, which would result in nonsense
-, and the COVID-19 infection network not considering obesity.

3.1 Relative Mean Error measurements
Since we built two networks, there are two sets of results concerning the Relative
Mean Error (RME). The first network models the COVID-19 and obesity happening
together. And the second one models only the effects of COVID-19, Network 1 and
Network 2, respectively. Table 1 shows the values of RME and its deviations for both
networks.In the sequel, we have plotted a histogram (Figure 2) of these.
3.2 Flux profiles
In this section, we show the Stationary Flux Vector (Flux Profile) for some knockouts of immunological interest in COVID-19 infections.It was chosen IFNα, IL-6, IL10, IL-17, and TNFα (Figures 3-6, respectively) as focus for discussion. Other knockouts are presented as supplementary material of the present paper, which are:
IFNβ,IFNγ, IL-1, IL2, IL-4, IL-8, and IL-18. It is important to state that these Flux
Profiles have as base the Network 1 (COVID-19 and obesity).
4. Discussion
The evaluation of RME in the complex network shows that the infected host cell
is more important for the progression, severity and aggravation of the disease than the
viral particle itself. Viruses, in general, directly or indirectly, kill or inactivate host cells,
the immune response associated with this infection will cause a local inflammatory
process, causing an immunopathic disease [19].
The virus-host cell relationship leads to the first sequence of immunoattractors,
here, IFNs. The analysis of the KOs shows the importance of these cytokines. In all the
results presented (Fig. 3-7) these molecules are of greater importance. These substances
are directly related to antiviral state, decreasing cell proliferation, increasing the number
of NK and CTL functions. Another important source of secretion of these cytokines is
plasmocytoid DC [20].
The CD40 present on the surface of the DC cells interacts with the CD40L
activating the T cells. This link avoid infection of DCs, interfere with MHC class IImediated antigen presentation, force pMHC internalization, Tc activation and B cell

activation. Tc activation feeds inflammation by stimulating IFNg, IL-10 and other
cytokines. Activated B cell induces secretion of IL-10 and TGFb that induces Th17
recruitment and increased secretion of IL-17 [25,27].
Some syndrome likeX-Linked Hyper IgM andX-linked form of hyper
Immunoglobulin M have a large mortality risk by respiratory infection present high
alteration in CD40 mutation [28,29]. Each syndrome shows increased serum
concentrationsof IgM.
The evaluation of Figure 2 shows the importance of adipose tissue as one of the
main agents of interaction in this network. This tissue is a source of constant supply of
TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGFb, IL-17 and IL-18. Recently, in an initial clinical
study by our group, we evaluated the secretion of IL-6 and C-reactive protein,
previously and after one year of Partial Duodenal Switch surgery, with removal of the
greater omentum [30]. As expected, there was a decrease in these two inflammatory
markers and, interestingly, patients reported decreased asthma attacks and bronchitis.
Here, we observe that, based on our network results, adipose tissue is one of the main
actors in the aggravation of the installed inflammatory process.
Both the infectious process by covid and the adipose tissue have secretion of
large amounts of IL-8, which generate a stimulus to neutrophils. In a study by the
University of Leicester, also in a network, but with a focus on proteins and receptors in
this disease, they showed a robust response from neutrophils and their important
participation [31].
Another interleukin, and our results, demonstrate an essential role in the severe
form of a disease that manifests itself in obese people is IL-17. Our study shows this as
the main one mentioned in the developed network. The role of this interleukin has been
identified as associated with the risk and prognosis of Acute Respiratory Discomfort
Syndrome (ARDS). Suggestion IL-17 may be a marker for risk prediction and
development of ARDS [33].
Interestingly, a recent study [34] reinforced that inhibition of IL-17, which, by
the way, is immunologically possible, could be a plausible strategy to prevent Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in corona virus disease 2019. Part of this
statement is due to a 2017 study that evaluated the significant and important increase in
IL-17 and Th17 cytokine profile in MERS-CoV [32].

This initial study, in a small network, pointed out the importance of chronic
inflammation in the obese individual as an important factor in potentiating the disease
caused by covid-19 and, in particular, the need for a clinical study focusing on IL-17.
This proved to be a possible therapeutic target to minimize the potential of the disease
in obese people. The expansion of the network and the association with other chronic
endemic diseases have already been the subject of new studies.
