ABSTRACT
Serology testing for COVID-19 is highly attractive because of the relatively short
diagnosis time and the ability to test for an active immune response against the SARSCoV-2. In many types of serology tests, the sensitivity and the specificity are directly
influenced by the quality of the antigens manufactured. Protein purification of these
recombinantly expressed viral antigens [e.g., spike and its receptor binding domain
(RBD)] is an important step in the manufacturing process. Simple and high-capacity
protein purification schemes for spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb, recombinantly
expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, are reported in this article. The schemes consist
of an affinity chromatography step and a desalting step. Purified proteins were
validated in ELISA-based serological tests. Interestingly, extracellular matrix proteins
[most notably heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] were co-purified from spikeexpressing CHO culture with a long cultivation time. HSPG-spike interaction could play
a functional role in the pathology and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronaviruses.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), identified in
December 2019, is the causative agent for the global pandemic designated COVID19 [1]. Serological surveys represent an invaluable tool to study immune response, to
assess the extent of the pandemic given the existence of asymptomatic cases and to
guide control measures. There is clear research evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the primary viral antigens, against which antibodies
are raised [2]. Hence, ELISA-based serological tests rely on the purified SARS-CoV2 components that are recombinantly expressed in insect or mammalian cells.

Coronavirus entry into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein
that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface [3]. The spike protein contains
a receptor binding domain (RBD) that specifically recognizes angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor [4, 5]. Spike is therefore a prime target of neutralising
antibody and vaccine [6].
CR3022 mAb, isolated previously from a convalescent SARS patient, is a neutralizing
antibody that targets the RBD of SARS-CoV [7]. The spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV are phylogenetically closely related, sharing an amino acid sequence
identity of ~77% [8]. Not surprising, CR3022 also binds to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2,
as confirmed by ELISA [9], bio-layer interferometry (BLI; [9]) and protein
crystallography [10]. For the purpose of a serological test, CR3022 serves as a good
positive control, when either spike or RBD is used as an antigen.
The focus of this article is two-fold. First, we present detailed protein purification
schemes for spike, RBD and CR3022, three important components for an ELISAbased serological test. These schemes, often omitted from or briefly described in
publications, are optimised specifically for the ÄKTA protein purification system to
increase protein manufacturing capacity. Second, we report and discuss co-purified
protein impurities, which could have significant implications on the downstream
application of these recombinant proteins and analysis of their associated
experimental data.
METHODS
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb
Transient spike/RBD production in HEK
Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were routinely cultivated in Expi293F
Expression medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C, 125 rpm in 8% CO2, ~80%
humidity. Cells were routinely sub-cultured every 3 – 4 days, by seeding at 0.3 – 0.4
0.4 mvc/mL. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA [11, 12] using PEI under
optimized conditions, and cultured for up to 8 days.
Stable spike production in CHO
A CHO-S derived clone was used to stably express spike. Cultures were grown in CDCHO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under biphasic conditions in an orbital shaker at 37°C,
140 rpm, 5% CO2, 85% humidity, with a feeding of 5% (v/v) CHO CD EfficientFeed B
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 of a 10-day fed batch cultivation.
Stable CR3022 production in CHO
A CHOK1SV GS-KO cell line was used to stably express CR3022. Cultures were
grown in CD-CHO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in an orbital shaker at 37°C, 140 rpm, 5%
CO2, 85% humidity, with a feeding of 10% (v/v) CHO CD EfficientFeed B (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) on days 3, 6 and 9 of an 11-day fed batch cultivation.
Protein purification of SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD
All protein purifications in this study was conducted using an ÄKTA Pure system
(Cytiva). A 5-mL HisTrapTM HP column (Cytiva) was washed with 5 column volumes
(CVs) of buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH
8.0), and equilibrated with 5 CVs of buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl,

10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Spent medium containing either spike or RBD was filtered
using a 0.22 µm stericup and loaded onto the equilibrated column using a sample
pump. Typically, a volume of 50 – 500 mL was loaded. After sample loading, the
column was washed in three steps using 5 CVs of buffer A, 5 CVs of 4.5% (v/v) buffer
B, and 10 CVs of 9% (v/v) buffer B. Protein was eluted using 100% (v/v) buffer B, and
collected in fractions (1 mL/fraction) using a fraction collector. The column equilibration,
sample loading, and column washing steps were conducted at 5 mL/min, while the
elution step at 1 mL/min. To further reduce non-specific binding, spent medium was
adjusted to 20 mM imidazole using buffer B, prior to filtration and sample loading.
SDS-PAGE
Protein fractions were analysed on a NuPAGETM 4-12%, Bis-Tris, 1 mm, 12-well mini
protein gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to check for size, purity, and integrity. The gel
was run using NuPAGETM MES SDS running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a
constant voltage of 200 V for 40 min. For visualization, the gel was stained using
InstantBlueTM (Expedeon).
Buffer exchange and storage of SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD
Protein fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged into storage buffer [20 mM Tris,
200 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0] using a PD-10 desalting column (Cytiva).
Protein sample was aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.
Protein purification of CR3022 mAb
A 5-mL HiTrapTM Protein G HP column (Cytiva) was equilibrated with 10 CVs of Protein
G IgG Binding Buffer (pH 5.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Spent medium containing
CR3022 mAb was diluted with binding buffer at a 1:1 volume ratio and filtered using a
0.22 µm stericup, prior to sample loading using a sample pump. The column was
washed with 10 CVs of binding buffer. mAb was eluted using IgG Elution Buffer (pH
2.8; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein fractions (1 mL/fraction) were collected using a
fraction collector and collection tubes containing 100 µL/tube of neutralization buffer
(1 M Tris, pH 9.0). The column equilibration, sample loading, and column washing
steps were conducted at 5 mL/min, while the elution step at 1 mL/min.
Buffer exchange and storage of CR3022 mAb
After SDS-PAGE analysis, mAb fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged into
storage buffer [phosphate-buffered saline, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) ProClin 300]
using a PD-10 desalting column (Cytiva). mAb sample was aliquoted and stored at 20°C.
Protein quantification
Spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb samples were diluted with their corresponding storage
buffers, and quantified using PierceTM Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Bovine serum albumin (2.5 µg/mL to 25 µg/mL) was used as a
protein calibration standard. Briefly, 100 µL of Bradford reagent was added to 100 µL
of diluted protein sample in a 96-well microplate. After a 30-sec shaking, the plate was
incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance was then measured at 595 nm
using a MultiskanTM FC microplate photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Proteins were resolved on a NuPAGETM 4-12%, Bis-Tris, 1 mm, 12-well mini protein
gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and transferred onto a PDVF membrane (iBlotTM 2
Transfer Stacks; Thermo Fisher Scientific). His-tagged protein was detected using a
mouse anti-6´His IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (MCA1396P; Bio-Rad),
and the blot was developed using PierceTM ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).
Peptide analysis by mass spectrometry
The identification of proteins analysed by SDS-PAGE was performed by first excising
the bands from the gel and slicing them into 1 mm pieces. The gel pieces were then
de-stained with 2 x 200 µL of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
(ACN/ABC). The proteins were reduced and S-alkylated with 10 mM TCEP and 55
mM MMTS, respectively, with washing in ACN/ABC after each reaction. The gel pieces
were dried in a vacuum centrifuge then rehydrated in 50 mM ABC containing 12.5
ng/μL trypsin (Promega), 5 mM calcium chloride. Proteolytic digestion was by
incubation at 37°C for 16 h. Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 15 μL of
25 mM ABC then 20 μL of neat ACN. The extracts were combined, dried in a vacuum
centrifuge and the peptides redissolved in 0.5% (v/v) TFA, 3% (v/v) ACN for analysis
by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an
RSLCnano-Q Exactive HF system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass spectra were
searched against Chinese hamster or human proteome databases (with inserted
Spike and RBD sequences) using Mascot software (Matrix Science).
For identification of proteins in solution, samples were concentrated to approximately
1 g/L by centrifugal ultrafiltration and 5 μg diluted to 7 μL with water. 1 μL each of 500
mM ABC, 0.2% (w/v) ProteaseMax surfactant (Promega) in 50 mM ABC and 0.2 g/L
trypsin was then added. The proteins were incubated at 37°C for 16 h then 1 μL of 5%
(v/v) TFA was added to degrade the surfactant. After incubation at RT for 5 min, the
peptides were desalted using a C18 spin column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) then dried
and redissolved for LC-MS/MS analysis as above.
Size exclusion chromatography
A HiLoad™ 26/600 Superdex™ 200 pg column (Cytiva) was washed with 2 CVs of
water, and equilibrated with 1.5 CVs of buffer (20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). A
2-mL protein sample was injected via a 5-mL sample loop. Separation was performed
at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Eluate was collected in fractions (4 mL/fraction) using a
fraction collector.
Co-immunoprecipitation
Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted using a NAbTM Spin Kit (Protein G, 0.2 mL;
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, the columns were equilibrated with 400 µL of binding
buffer (100 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2), and incubated with 500 µL of
protein sample for 10 min at room temperature. The columns were subsequently
washed 3 times with 400 µL of binding buffer, followed by 3 elution steps with 400 µL
of IgG Elution Buffer. Eluates were collected in tubes containing 40 µL/tube of
neutralization buffer (1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5).

The gene sequence for spike, in the constructs provided by Krammer [11, 12], was
derived from the genomic sequence of the first virus isolate, designated as WuhanHu-1 (GenBank: MN908947.3; Fig. 1) [13]. The spike protein sequence contains
multiple modifications intended for protein stabilization and downstream processing:
(a) the polybasic cleavage site (R682RAR685) recognised by a furin [14] was removed
via an alanine replacement, (b) two stabilizing mutations (K986P and V987P; [15])
were introduced, (c) the transmembrane domain (a.a. 1214 – 1236) and the
endodomain (a.a. 1237 – 1273) were truncated, and (d) a thrombin cleavage site
(LVPR¯GS), a trimerization domain from the bacteriophage T4 fibritin
(GYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL) [16, 17], and a hexahistidine tag
(HHHHHH) were fused to P1213. For the RBD construct, the native N-terminal signal
peptide of spike (MFVFLVLLPLVSSQ) was fused to the RBD sequence (a.a. 319 –
541), and joined with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag.
Protein purification of spike
All the purification schemes in this study were developed for use with ÄKTA protein
purification systems and the likes. The schemes, consisting of an affinity
chromatography step and a desalting step, were designed for routine larger-scale
preparative purification. The number of purification steps was intentionally minimised
to strike a balance between protein purity that suffices a serological test and protein
yield, and to reduce processing time.
SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the full-length spikes purified from both HEK and
CHO cultures were relatively pure and homogenous (Fig. 2A), giving a Mw of >180
kDa that is significantly larger than the calculated Mw of 139.2 kDa. SARS-CoV-2 S
gene encodes 22 N-linked glycan sequons (N-X-S/T, where X ¹ P) per protomer [18].
The size difference of ~40 kDa indicated that the recombinant spike is a heavily
glycosylated protein. The band corresponding to the spike protein was subsequently
analysed using in-gel trypsin digestion in conjunction with mass spectrometry analysis.
Mass spectrometric data confirmed the identity of the spike (Fig. 2B). Contrary to the
work reported by Krammer and co-workers, in which the full-length spike appeared as
a double band (~180 kDa and ~130 kDa) on a reducing SDS-PAGE which was
postulated due to protein degradation resulting in a smaller protein [11], our purified
spike ran as a clear single band on both non-reducing (Fig. 2A) and reducing (data
not shown) SDS-PAGE.
Protein purification of RBD
The same purification scheme, developed for the full-length spike, was applied for the
purification of RBD. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified RBD showed
two distinct bands (Fig. 3), a dominant band with a Mw of ~30 kDa and a side band
with a Mw of ~60 kDa. As our RBD sequence (a.a. 319 – 541) contains, in total, 9
cysteine residues (C336, C361, C379, C391, C432, C480, C488, C525 and C538),
we suspected an RBD dimer formation. When we re-ran the purified RBD on a
reducing SDS-PAGE, a clear single band was obtained (Fig. 3), confirming our
hypothesis. The bands corresponding to the RBD dimer and RBD monomer were
analysed using in-gel trypsin digestion in conjunction with mass spectrometry analysis
and confirmed the identity of RBD in both cases (Fig. 4). Based on the crystallographic
data of RBD (6M0J, [19]), there are four disulphide bonds in RBD (C336-C361,
C379-C432, C391-C525 and C480-C488; Fig. 5). The free C538 is likely the cysteine
residue involved in inter-molecular dimerization.

Like the recombinant full-length spike, recombinant RBD also appeared larger in size.
There are two N-glycosylation sites within the RBD sequence (N331 and N343) [18].
This could explain the size difference of ~4 kDa between the Mw deduced from the
SDS-PAGE (~30 kDa) and the calculated Mw (26.1 kDa).
Protein purification of CR3022 mAb
CR3022 mAb was purified using a pre-packed protein G column, with a straightforward
purification scheme. This IgG interacts strongly with protein G, evidenced by its broad
elution peak spanning over 16 fractions (Fig. 6). We chose a Protein G IgG Binding
Buffer with a pH of 5.0 in our purification scheme for a stronger IgG interaction with
protein G. The binding between protein G and IgG was shown to be pH-dependent
between 2.8 and 10, strongest at pH 4 and 5, and weakest at pH 10 [20]. The downside
of using an acidic binding buffer is protein precipitation, which occurred when the spent
medium was diluted with the binding buffer at a 1:1 volume ratio. The yield of CR3022
mAb (57 mg/L spent medium) was similar to that estimated from HPLC using
MAbPacTM Protein A column (40 – 100 mg/L spent medium). The precipitated protein
was likely host cell proteins. It is therefore necessary to filter the diluted spent medium
with a 0.22 µm stericup, prior to sample loading onto the equilibrated protein G column.
Non-reducing (Fig. 7A) and reducing (Fig. 7B) SDS-PAGE analyses confirmed the
presence of both heavy chain and light chain in the purified CR3022.
HSPG was co-purified with full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike
During our optimization of protein expression in CHO cells, a longer cell cultivation
time was found to have a profound and positive effect on the full-length spike yield
(data not shown). However, the spike purified from the spent medium of a longer
culture did not provide the same purity as seen in Fig. 2A, despite applying the same
purification scheme (Fig. 8A). Notably, we observed protein species of much higher
Mw (>250 kDa) and of lower Mw (predominantly at ~70 kDa). Western blot analysis
with an anti-His antibody showed that these co-purified proteins were not His-tagged
(Fig. 8B), and the possibility of spike degradation due to a longer cell cultivation time
was ruled out.
To identify these impurities, two impure spike fractions (Fig. 8A, lanes D and F) were
subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. The two
fractions gave almost an identical protein profile (Table 1). Based on the mass
spectrometry data, heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG, Mw 334 kDa), nidogen-1 (79
kDa) and suprabasin (64 kDa) constituted bulk of the co-purified impurities, consistent
with the impurity bands (high Mw of >250 kDa and low Mw of ~70 kDa) observed in the
SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 8A).
Peaks corresponding to HSPG and full-length spike were incompletely resolved
using a gradient elution in affinity chromatography or a size exclusion
chromatography
To further optimise the affinity chromatography step, two strategies were attempted:
(a) a gradient elution, and (b) a more stringent binding by adding 20 mM imidazole
into the spent medium prior to sample loading.
In Fig. 9, a gradient elution [0 – 100% (v/v) buffer B over 5 CVs] was applied to an
impure spike fraction (Fig. 8, lane D). HSPG interacts strongly with Ni sepharose, as

the peak corresponding to HSPG was eluted at 47% (v/v) buffer B. Although it was
possible to partially resolve the peaks corresponding to HSPG (fractions 13 – 16) and
spike (fractions 15 – 24), as shown in Fig. 10A, this elution scheme was not further
pursued for two reasons. First, the spike protein was eluted in a broad peak spanning
over 10 fractions. This lowers the concentration of the purified spike and would mean
a larger volume to process in the subsequent desalting step. The lower spike
concentration is not ideal as protein is typically more stable when stored at a higher
concentration. Second, some spike protein was lost through co-elution with HSPG (Fig.
10, fractions 15 and 16). Adding 20 mM imidazole into the spent medium, however,
provided a clear benefit of higher purity without compromising the protein yield (Fig.
10B).
We also attempted size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using an impure spike
fraction, with the aim of simultaneously achieving (a) separation between HSPG and
spike, and (b) buffer exchange. However, we obtained a broad peak (Fig. 11, line 2)
with a slight shoulder (line 3). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the peak
corresponding to HSPG was eluted at ~116 mL, while the one corresponding to spike
at ~121 mL (Fig. 12). Although SEC was not the right approach to separate HSPG
from spike, we could deduce the Mw of the full-length spike from the calibration curve
for a HiLoad™ 26/600 Superdex™ 200 pg column (Fig. 13A). Using an elution volume
of ~121 mL, the recombinant spike has a Mw of 619 kDa (Fig. 13B), confirming the
trimeric nature of this glycoprotein. This Mw is in good agreement with the one reported
by Watanabe et al. using a similar full-length spike construct (670 kDa, deduced from
SEC using a Superose 6 10/300 column) [18].
Co-immunoprecipitation
Co-purification of HSPG raises the possibility that HSPG could potentially be a binding
partner of SARS-CoV-2 spike. To further investigate the potential HSPG and spike
interaction, four protein samples were prepared and loaded onto NAbTM Protein G spin
columns: sample 1 (75 µg CR3022), sample 2 (75 µg CR3022 + 71 µg spike), sample
3 (75 µg CR3022 + 50 µg protein from the HSPG-rich fraction), and sample 4 (75 µg
CR3022 + 50 µg protein from the HSPG-rich fraction + 71 µg spike). The HSPG-rich
fraction used in these samples referred to the peak corresponding to HSPG from a
gradient elution (Fig. 9).
As shown in Fig. 14, all the impurities including HSPG were not captured by the Protein
G spin column. They were present in the flowthrough and absent from the eluate.
Spike, on the other hand, was captured by the Protein G spin column via CR3022.
Although we did not observe a co-complex formed between spike and HSPG, we could
not rule out their potential interaction for two reasons. First, co-immunoprecipitation
relies on strong affinities between the bait (CR3022) and the primary target (spike) as
well as the latter with the secondary target (HSPG). Low affinity or transient interaction
between proteins may not be detected. The spike-HSPG interaction could potentially
be a weak one. Second, CR3022 could be a competitor of HSPG for spike interaction.
Although the co-immunoprecipitation experiment was inconclusive with respect to
spike-HSPG interaction, it confirmed nonetheless (a) the functionality of the purified
spike and CR3022, and (b) the incomplete resolution of the peaks corresponding to
HSPG and spike in a gradient elution. Therefore, if a gradient elution was adopted
during purification, the spike protein loss would be higher than the gain in purity.

Co-purification of HSPG
HSPGs are composed of unbranched, negatively charged heparan sulfate
polysaccharides attached to a variety of cell surface or extracellular matrix proteins
[21]. Owing to the heavily sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains, they present a global
negative charge that interacts electrostatically with the basic residues of viral surface
glycoproteins or viral capsid proteins. Viruses exploit these weak interactions with
HSPG to increase their local concentration at the cell surface, augmenting their
chances of binding a more specific receptor [21]. HSPGs are expressed in lung cells
[22]. They also play a pivotal role in cellular internalization of viruses, basic peptides
and polycation-nucleic-acid complexes [23].
Both heparan sulfate [24] and heparin [25] were recently shown to interact with SARSCoV-2 spike and its RBD, further strengthening our postulation that CR3022 and
HSPG could compete with one another for spike binding. All these evidences in the
literature, along with the experimental observation presented in this study, suggest
that HSPG co-purification is not a coincidental event. We hypothesize that HSPG copurification is contributed by two synergistic mechanisms, as illustrated in Fig. 15A.
First, HSPG interacts with spike via electrostatic interaction. As spike is being captured
by the HisTrapTM column, the high local concentration of spike within the column would
favour protein-protein interaction. Second, the high histidine content of HSPG (135
residues, 4.3%) further augment its binding with Ni sepharose or spike. The pKa value
of the histidine side chain is 6.0. Some of these histidine residues would be
deprotonated in our purification buffers of pH 8.0. Important to note, three arginine
residues and one lysine residue were removed from the spike variant used in this
study (R682, R683, R985 and K986). These modifications would have compromised
the affinity of HSPG to spike. Recently, the D614G mutation in spike was shown to
increase the infectivity of the virus [26]. Removal of a negatively charged residue from
spike could benefit its interaction with HSPG.
Based on our SEC data (Fig. 13b), HSPG has a Mw of 727 kDa, in line with a previous
study (400 – 600 kDa, purified from mouse cells) [27]. There are a number of GXXXG
motifs in the protein sequence of HSPG (Fig. 15B), suggesting that this protein could
form a dimer [28].
Co-purification of proteins other than HSPG
A close examination of other impurities revealed multiple extracellular matrix (ECM)
macromolecules, such as laminin, nidogen and tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like
[29]. They were captured by the Ni sepharose for two reasons: (a) a high histidine
content (e.g., 8.1% histidine in suprabasin), and (b) interaction with HSPG. Laminin,
an ECM-adhesive protein, is known to interact with HSPG [30]. Nidogen, another
impurity we identified, interacts with both laminin [31] and HSPG [32].
Throughout our spike purifications, we have consistently noticed that the spike purified
from a HEK culture was purer than that from a CHO culture. This is in agreement with
a previous report that CHO cells had a higher amount of cell-surface and intracellular
HSPGs compared to HEK293 cells [33].
CONCLUSION
Recombinant spike, its RBD and CR3022, purified using the purification schemes
presented here, are adequate for routine serological assays, both in terms of protein

purity and yield. Although CHO is an excellent manufacturing host for spike, impurities
such as HSPG are co-purified from CHO culture with a long cultivation time when a
HisTrap column is used for spike purification. One potential mitigation strategy is the
use of HSPG-deficient CHO cells or those defective in the biosynthesis of
glycosaminoglycans [34]. HEK293, with a lower HSPG expression, is a good
alternative. The potential HSPG-spike interaction certainly warrants further
investigation, as it may contribute to the pathology and the pathogenesis of SARSCoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1: Sequence alignment of the S protein from the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank: MN908947.3) and the S
protein variant used in this study (provided by Krammer), created using Clustal Omega
[35]. In the S variant, the polybasic cleavage site (R682RAR685) recognised by a furin
was replaced by an alanine (boxed in red). Two stabilizing mutations (K986P and
V987P) were introduced (boxed in blue). The transmembrane domain (a.a. 1214 –
1236) and the endodomain (a.a. 1237 – 1273), highlighted in grey, were truncated. A
thrombin cleavage site (cyan), a trimerization domain from the bacteriophage T4
fibritin (green) and a hexahistidine tag (yellow) were fused to P1213. For the RBD
construct used in this study, the native N-terminal signal peptide of SARS-CoV-2 S
protein (MFVFLVLLPLVSSQ) was fused to the RBD sequence (a.a. 319 – 541;
sequence in bold red), and joined with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag.
Figure 2: (A) Fractions collected from a step elution in SARS-CoV-2 spike purification
using an affinity chromatography (5-mL HisTrapTM HP column). (B) Gel band
corresponding to spike was excised from the SDS-PAGE, post visualisation by
InstantBlueTM. The gel band was de-stained and proteolytically digested with trypsin
to generate peptides for mass spectrometric analysis using LC-MS/MS. Peptides
mapped to spike protein sequence were coloured in red.
Figure 3: Purified receptor binding domain (RBD; a.a. 319 – 541) of SARS-CoV-2
spike was analysed on a non-reducing (left) and reducing (right) SDS-PAGE,
confirming the RBD’s dimerization.
Figure 4: The boxed gel bands in Fig. 3 (box 1 for RBD dimer and box 2 for RBD
monomer) were excised from the SDS-PAGE, post visualisation by InstantBlueTM. The
gel bands were de-stained and proteolytically digested with trypsin to generate
peptides for mass spectrometric analysis using LC-MS/MS. Peptides mapped to RBD
sequence were coloured in red: (A) Box 1 – RBD dimer, and (B) Box 2 – RBD
monomer.

[36]. The four disulphide bonds in RBD (C336-C361, C379-C432, C391-C525 and
C480-C488) were shown in sticks.

of buffer B, respectively. The blue, green and brown curves represent UV absorbance
at 280 nm, % (v/v) of buffer B and conductivity, respectively. CR3022 mAb interacted
strongly with Protein G, and was eluted in a broad peak spanning over 16 fractions.

Figure 9: The chromatogram of a gradient elution [0 – 100% (v/v) buffer B over 5
column volumes], when an impure spike fraction (Fig. 8, lane D) was loaded onto a 5mL HisTrapTM HP column. The x axis, left y axis, and right y axis show the elution
volume in mL, UV absorbance at 280 nm, and % (v/v) of buffer B, respectively. The
blue, green and brown curves represent UV absorbance at 280 nm, % (v/v) of buffer

peak corresponding to HSPG was eluted at 47% (v/v) buffer B.
Figure 10: (A) Fractions collected from a gradient elution [0 – 100% (v/v) buffer B over
5 column volumes, see Fig. 9], when an impure spike fraction (Fig.8, lane D) was
loaded onto a 5-mL HisTrapTM HP column. HSPG (fractions 13 – 16) and spike
(fractions 15 – 24) were partially resolved. (B) A more stringent binding by adding 20
mM imidazole into the spent medium, prior to sample loading onto a 5-mL HisTrapTM
HP column, improved the purity of spike when the protein was purified from CHO
culture with a long cultivation time.

(75 µg CR3022 + 50 µg protein from the HSPG-rich fraction + 71 µg spike). The HSPGrich fraction used in these samples referred to the peak corresponding to HSPG from
a gradient elution (see Fig. 9). The samples from flowthrough, 1st washing, 2nd washing,
1st elution, and 2nd elution were analysed on a reducing SDS-PAGE.
