Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to more than 216
countries and has put global public health at high risk. The world urgently needs a cost-effective
and safe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine, antiviral and therapeutic drugs to control the
COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we engineered the Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike protein (S)
variants (Receptor binding domain, RBD and S1 domain) of SARS-CoV-2 genes and produced
in Nicotiana benthamiana plant. The purification yields were at least 20 mg of pure protein/kg of
plant biomass for each target protein. The S protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 showed specific
binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The purified
plant produced N and S variants were recognized by N and S protein specific monoclonal and
polyclonal antibodies demonstrating specific reactivity of mAb to plant produced N and S
protein variants. In addition, IgG responses of plant produced N and S antigens elicited
significantly high titers of antibody in mice. This is the first report demonstrating production of
functional active S1 domain and Nucleocapsid protein of SARC-CoV-2 in plants. In addition, in

this study, for the first time, we report the co-expression of RBD with N protein to produce a
cocktail antigen of SARS-CoV-2, which elicited high-titer antibodies compared to RBD or N
proteins. Thus, obtained data support that plant produced N and S antigens, developed in this
study, are promising vaccine candidates against COVID-19.
Introduction
The novel coronavirus, currently designated as SARS-CoV-2, is a novel and highly pathogenic
coronavirus, and spread more than to 222 countries and territories in a short time, and as of
December 25, 2020, more than 79,931,215 cases were recorded, and more than 1,765,265
confirmed deaths. Although a number of various types vaccines (mRNA, DNA, and viral vectorbased, protein based subunits, inactivated, attenuated etc.) for COVID-19 is underway and there
are currently no drugs, no specific treatment and no vaccines available to treat COVID-19
infections and protect people against fatal SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The world urgently needs a
safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine, antiviral and therapeutic drugs, cost
effective diagnostic reagents and kits to control the COVID-19 pandemic and relieve the human
suffering associated with the pandemic that kills thousands of people every day. One of the
major observed features of this virus is that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from infected people
without symptoms, therefore, it increases the challenges of controlling a deadly pandemic
without the use of a vaccine. One-third of the virus genome (~30 kb) of SARS-CoV encode
mainly structural proteins such as spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein (N), small
envelop protein (E) and matrix protein (M). When reported on January 2020, in Spike protein,
SARS-CoV-2 had about 79.6 % sequence identity

with that of SARS-CoV1,2.

Now the

sequence identity is less than 76%, as the spike protein of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has
acquired more than 725 mutations. S protein of coronavirus consist of S1 and S2 domains and

plays a key role in virus binding, fusion and entry to host cells. S protein has been demonstrated
as a leading target for vaccine and neutralizing antibody development. In fact, most of vaccines,
such as mRNA, DNA, viral vector-based, subunits, protein based vaccines against COVID-19
have been developed based on the gene encoding S protein3-7. S1 domain contains a receptorbindingdomain (RBD), which binds specifically to angiotensin-converting enzyme (AEC2),
areceptorfor both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is
cycteine-rich protein and nine cysteine residues are found in the RBD, eight of which involve in
forming four pairs of disulfide bridges8. In addition, the S protein has 22 potential Nglycosylation sites, of which two of them are in the RBD9. Thus, correct formation of disulfide
bridges and status of glycosylation would be essential for functional activity of recombinant S
protein-based vaccines, produced using different expression system. The structure of SARSCoV-2 spike RBD was recently determined by crystal structure analysis at 2.45 Å resolution 1. It
was demonstrated that the overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly
identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. It should
be noted that since the RBD is the critical region for receptor binding, therefore RBD based
vaccines could be great promise for developing vaccines and also highly potent cross-reactive
therapeutic agents. It has been recently demonstrated that RBD-Fc-based COVID-19 vaccine
candidate elicited high titer of RBD-specific antibodies with neutralizing activity against SARSCoV-2 infections3. As mentioned above, N protein has been shown to be more conserved
compared with S protein and share 90% amino acid homology with SARC-CoV and stable with
fewer observed mutations10-13. Since the N-protein was found to be more conservative and
showed strong immunogenicity, the N-protein could be a strong potential candidate for a
COVID-19 vaccine14.

Numerous studies in recent years have demonstrated plant expression systems as promising
expression platforms for the cost-effective, rapid and safe production of various recombinant
proteins. Plant expression systems have several advantages over other expression systems
currently in use. This system has been successfully used for rapid and cost-effective production
of a variety of recombinant proteins, vaccine candidates, therapeutic proteins, enzymes,
antibodies etc.15-22. Recently, a number of flexible approaches have been developed, which
enabled the successfully production of pharmaceutically important complex proteins including
human proteins and enzymes in plants15,19-21. Thus, plant expression system could be ideal
platform for cost effective, safe and rapid production of structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as a
vaccine candidates against COVID-19. In previous efforts, a number of studies have been
conducted on the transgenic (stable) expression of the spike protein of SARS-CoV in plants. Nterminal fragment of SARS-CoV S protein (S1) was produced in tomato and low-nicotine
tobacco plants and demonstrated immunogenicity in mice after parenteral or oral
administration23. Several groups have reported development of S protein recombinant plantbased vaccines against different coronoviruses for oral delivery that elicit protective immunity
against virus challenge24-26. Recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein was also expressed in plant
cytosol and chloroplasts27. However, transgenic plant approach has some concerns, which are
mainly associated with the long development time. Additionally low target accumulation levels
and the possibility of gene flow from transgenic plants to wild types are of concern28. Plant
transient expression system has a number of advantages over stable expression. Using a transient
plant expression system, the production of glycosylated form of RBD SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana
benthamiana plant has been reported recently29. However, the expression level of RBD in N.
benthamina plant was very low, 8 μg/g, which is unsatisfactory to be economical for

commercialization. In this study, we report the high production of functionally active structural
proteins of SARC-CoV-2 such as RBD (glycosylated and deglycosylated variants), and
glycosylated variant of S1 domain, and N proteins in the N. benthamiana plant using a transient
expression platform. Notably, neither the S1 domain of SARS-CoV nor the SARS-CoV-2 was
produced using a transient plant expression system elsewhere.

Results
Engineering, cloning and expression, purification and characterization of N andS protein
variants in N. benthamiana plant.
The purification yields were at least 20 mg pure protein/kg plant biomass for each target protein.
On SDS-PAGE and western blotting, plant produced N protein molecule appears as a doublet
protein with a MM of 48 and 24 kDa (Figure 1). Both molecular forms of plant produced N
proteins were recognized by anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 1B) and by N protein specific mAb
(Figure 1C), demonstrating specific reactivity of mAb to the two forms and also confirm that
epitope for mAb still present in ~24 kDa fragment. N protein of SARS-CoV-2 has 5 potential Nglycosylation sites. When N protein was co-expressed with Endo H, there was no protein band
shift in the western blotting suggesting that plant produced N protein is not N-glycosylated. To
understand the role of glycosylation, we produced both glycosylated and non-glycosylated
variants of RBD and S1 protein in N. benthamiana plant. Figure 2 demonstrate SDS-PAGE
analysis of the anti-Flag column purified, deglycosylated and glycosylated variants of RBD. The
purity of both glycosylated anddeglycosylated proteins were higher than 90%. Plant produced,
purified glycosylated RBD molecules appear as a protein with a molecular mass (MM) of ~36
kDa (Figure 2, dRBD). dRBD molecules appear as a double protein with a MM of ~32 or ~33

kDa (Figure 2, dRBD). Plant produced dRBD and gRBD proteins were very well recognized by
anti-FLAG (Figure 2A), and also by S protein specific polyclonal (Figure 2C) antibody,
demonstrating specific reactivity of pAb to the RBD protein. N+gRBD co-expressed (cocktail)
proteins were purified using anti-Flag column. SDS-PAGE analysis of the cocktail protein
purified from N. benthamiana plant is presented in Figure 3.Deglycosylated variants were
produced using the in vivo Endo H deglycosylation strategy, which we recently developed19.
Deglycosylated and glycosylated variants of plant produced S1 proteins were purified using
HisPur™ Ni-NTA resin. On SDS-PAGE and western blotting, plant produced glycosylated S1
(gS1) protein appears as a single protein with a MM of ~100 kDa (Figure 4A). No clear visible
band of Ni-NTA resin purified, Endo H deglycosylated S1 protein (dS1) was observed in SDSPAGE gels, suggesting degradation of deglycosylated S1 protein. However, on Western blotting,
deglycosylated S1 protein with a band of ~ 80 kDa was observed. Plant produced, purified
glycosylated and deglycoslated S1 variants were recognized by anti-His mAb tag (Figure 4B) or
anti-S protein specific pAb (Figure 4C).

Binding of plant produced RBD and S1 proteins to ACE2
Binding of plant-produced gRBD, dRBD and gS1 proteins to ACE2 were performed as described
in Methods. As can be seen from Figure 5, the plant-produced RBD variants and S1 protein
demonstrated specific binding to AEC2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Notable, Endo
deglycosylated RBD exhibited stronger binding to AEC2 compared with glycosylated
counterpart.
Stability assessment of RBD variants and S1

The stability analysis of plant produced glycosylated and Endo H in vivo deglycosylated forms of
RBD and gS1 of SARC-CoV were examined after incubation at 37 °C for 48, 96, 72 and 96
hours. The procedure of stability analysis was similar to those described previously21.These
analyses showed that dRBD degradation was very low at incubation at 37 ° C for 24 hours (less
than 10 %), however, at the same condition, gRBD degraded significantly (more than 60%).
Plant produced gS1 protein showed better stability compared to gRBD or dRBD and degraded
about 50% after 48 hours. Since the yield of Endo H dS1 was very low, we were not able to
compare the stability of gS1 with dS1 counterpart.

Immunogenicity studies of N, RBD and S1 variants in mice

Mice received two doses from each variant (N, gRBD, dRBD, [N+ RBD (cocktail)] or gS1
proteins) adsorbed to 0.3% Alhydrogel at three-week intervals (0, 21 days). Serum samples were
collected on days -1 (pre-bleed) and 42 (post 2nd vaccination) and assessed for anti-N, antigRBD, anti-dRBD anti-(N+gRBD) and anti-gS1 antibody responses by an IgG ELISA. IgG
responses showed that plant produced N and S protein variants were able to induce significantly
higher titers of antibody with alum adjuvant at the 5 μg dose (Figure 6).

Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus, which has caused an outbreak in
Wuhan city, China in 2019, and then spread rapidly throughout the world. The new coronavirus
COVID-19 disease is currently responsible for the pandemic, created huge global human health
crisis with significant negative impacts on health and economy worldwide. The development of

effective and safe vaccines is urgently needed to prevent the spread of the disease and protect
populations. A number of different types of vaccines (adenovirus-vectored vaccine, mRNA
vaccines, inactivated vaccines and protein based subunits vaccines) are currently in various
developmentstages30-32and Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials have already been completed for some of
them5,33-36. Several of these vaccine candidates have been demonstrated to induce antibodies
specific for S and RBD and can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection3. However, due to725
mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein37,and considering possible future mutations on the S
protein RBD, most of developed vaccines, especially mRNA and inactivated vaccines may not
be effective against SARS-CoV-2. The other concern is if COVID-19 vaccines will be safe and
effective. It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into
human genome38; this is one of the major concerns regarding the RNA based vaccines. The
genomes of all known Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
encode four structural proteins: N, S, E and M proteins. S protein plays a key role in the receptor
(AEC2) recognition and responsible for attachment to host receptor. Nucleocapsid (N) protein,
plays essential role in the viral genomic RNA packaging and facilitate the binding of the viral
genome to a replication-transcription complex39.As mentioned above, most vaccine candidates
such as DNA, mRNA, and viral vaccines developed so far are based on the S protein gene of
SARS-CoV-24-7. However, N Protein of SARS–CoV-2 could be a potential target for COVID-19
vaccine development since N protein is more conserved and stable, in fact few mutations was
observed over time2,10,12-14,40-42. It has also been recently shown that the crystal structure of the
SARS–CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is very similar to coronavirus N proteins, which were
previously described43. Cong et al. (2020) using a mouse hepatitis virus model showed that
nucleocapsid protein contributes to forming helical ribonucleoproteins during the packaging of

the RNA genome, and thereby regulating the viral RNA synthesis during replication and
transcription. A number of studies have shown the critical roles of N protein for multiple steps of
the viral life cycle14. It was also demonstrated that N proteins of many coronaviruses are highly
immunogenic and are produced abundantly during infection44 and high levels of IgG antibodies
against N protein have been detected in sera from patients who had recoveredfromSARS45. We
performed sequence analysis and amino acid variations of structural proteins deduced from new
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 strains, isolated in different countries. Our amino acid sequence
analysis of structural proteins demonstrates that, despite a high number of amino acid variations
in membrane protein (M), there are no significant amino acid variations observed in the
structural N, S or E-proteins obtained from new strains of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus isolated in
different countries2. These results support the importance of subunit vaccines that can be
effective against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, especially against various mutations. Notable, due to
their safety, efficacy and scalability, subunit protein-based vaccines are becoming preferred
alternatives to killed or live attenuated pathogens and are increasingly becoming popular. Plant
transient expression system is a promising expression platform for production a variety of
recombinant proteins such as vaccines, antibodies, therapeutic proteins and enzymes. Using a
transient expression system, a number of difficult-to-express proteins have been successfully
produced in N. benthamiana such as full length Pfs48/45 of Plasmodium falcipatrium19,21, human
Factor IX and Furin, heptamerized form of PA63 of Bacillus anthracis21. Major challenge in any
expression system, including plant expression systems, is to achieve the production of
recombinant proteins with native folding, native like post-translational modifications (PTM),
with high solubility and high yield. Flexible approaches are required for successful production of
functional active recombinant proteins in plants with high yield. Thus, plant expression system

could be ideal platform for rapid, cost effective, safe and high level production of structural
proteins of SARC-COV-2. In this study, we demonstrate the production of functionally active
structural proteins SARC-CoV-2, such as RBD variants, S1 domain and nucleocapsid proteins, at
a high level and in a highly soluble form in the N. benthamiana plant using a transient expression
platform. We purified these protein using anti-Flag and Ni-NTA resin chromatography. The
purification yields were at least 20 mg/ kg plant leaf. In this study, we constructed two plasmids,
expressing FLAG tagged and His tagged variants of RBD. We found that the expression level
and purification yield of RBD-His tagged was low (less than 10 mg/kg leaf biomass), however,
the expression level and purification yield of plant produced RBD-FLAG tagged protein was
significantly higher, more than 20 mg/kg leaf biomass. The purified plant produced N and S
proteins were recognized by N and S protein specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrating
specific reactivity of mAb to plant produced N and S protein variants. The plant-produced RBD
and S1 protein showed specific binding to AEC2, SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Notable, plant
produced Endo H deglycosylated RBD exhibited stronger binding to AEC2 compared with
glycosylated counterpart, suggesting native-like folding of dRBD, and negative effect of
glycosylation on masking of important epitopes of the RBD.
IgG responses showed that plant produced N, S1 antigens were able to induce significantly
higher titers of antibodies with Alhydrogel adjuvant. In this study, we are also reporting for the
first time the co-expression of gRBD with protein N to produce a cocktail of SARS-CoV-2
antigens, which elicited high-titer antibodies compared to RBD or N proteins. Thus, N, S1 and
[N+gRBD] antigens are promising vaccine candidates against COVID-19.These plants produced
antigens can also be used as a diagnostic reagent in serological tests for detection of SARSCOV-2 antibody in COVID-19 patients.

Methods
Cloning and expression of Nucleocapsid(N) and Spike (S) protein variants in N.
benthamiana. The nucleocapsid gene (1-419 AAGenBank accession YP_009724397) and Spike
gene of SARS–CoV-2 variants: RBD (receptor-binding domain containing fragment, RBD, 319591AA, GenBank accession MN985325, as a Flag or His6 tagged) and S1 domain (AA 14- 815,
GenBank accession MN985325, as a His6 tagged) were optimized for expression in N.
benthamianaplants and de-novo synthesized at Biomatik Corp. To transiently express N, S
protein (RBD, S1 domain and N+RBD) variants in N. benthamiana plants, the Nicotiana
tabacum PR-1a signal peptide (MGFVLFSQLPSFLLVSTLLLFLVISHSCRA) was added to the
N-terminus of N, RBD and S1 proteins. In addition, the KDEL sequence (the ER retention
signal) and the FLAG epitope (the affinity purification tag for N and RBD proteins) or His6 tag
(for S1 domain) were added to the C-terminus. The resulting sequences were inserted into the
pEAQ46 binary expression vectors to obtain pEAQ-N, pEAQ-RBD and pEAQ-S1. These
plasmids were then transferred into Agrobacterium AGL1 strain. To express N, RBD, S1 and
N+RBD variants in N. benthamiana plant, AGL1 harboring pEAQ-N, pEAQ-RBD and pEAQS1 plasmids were infiltrated into N. benthamiana plant leaves. Plants were harvested at 4 dpi
(day afterpost infiltration).

SDS-PAGE analysis of plant produced N, RBD and S1 variants were performed on 10%
acrylamide gels stained with Coomassie (Gel Code Blue, Pierce Rockford, IL). Western blot
analysis was performed after electrophoresis and transfer of the proteins to Polyvinylidene
Fluoride membranes. After transfer, Western blot membranes were blocked with I-Block
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and recombinant proteins N, RBD, S1 and N+RBD were
detected with anti-DYKDDDDK antibody (cat. no. 651503, BioLegend, for N, RBD or
N+RBD), anti-His antibody (for S1) and anti-RBD of S protein of SARC-CoV-2 monoclonal
antibody (cat. no. MBS7135930, for RBD) or Human Novel Coronavirus Nucleoprotein (N) (1419aa) monoclonal Antibody (MyBioSource, cat. no. MBS7135930).

In vivo co-expressing of N and S protein with Endo H

To produce deglycosylated variants of N, RBD and S1 domain, AGL1 strain harboring pEAQ-N,
pEAQ-RBD and pEAQ-S1 were co-infiltrated with pGeen-Endo H construct19.

Purification of plant produced N, RBD and N+RBD (cocktail) proteins using antiDYKDDDDK affinity gel

Purification of plant produced N and RBD (glycosylated and deglycosylated) variants were
performed by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography using anti-DYKDDDDK affinity gel (cat. no.
651503, BioLegend) as described previously21. For purification, 20 g of frozen leaves, infiltrated
with the pEAQ-N-Flag-KDEL or pEAQ-RBD- Flag-KDEL (with or w/o pGreen-Endo H)
constructs were ground in 20 mL PBS buffer (1XPBS, 150 mMNaCI) using a mortar and a

pestle. Plant debris was removed by filtration through Miracloth followed by centrifugation
at20,000 g for 25 minutes and then filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Millipore). An antiFLAG affinity column was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sixty
milliliters of a clear supernatant were loaded into 0.5 ml resin column equilibrated with PBS
buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of PBS buffer. Bound proteins were eluted
using 200 mM Glycine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 2.2 into tubes containing 2.0 M Tris solution to
neutralize. Total protein content was estimated using the BioDrop and then analyzed by SDSPAGE and western blot.

Purification of plant produced S1 domain variant using HisPur™ Ni-NTA Resin

Plant produced S1 domain variants (glycoslated and deglycosylated variants) were purified using
HisPur™ Ni-NTA Resin (ThermoFisher scientific, Cat. No. 8822) as described previously19.
Briefly, 25 grams of frozen plant leaves, infiltrated with the pEAQ-S1-His6-KDEL construct,
were ground using mortar and pestle in a phosphate extraction buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate,
300 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The plant cell extract was filtered through
Miracloth and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 25 minutes and then filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe
filter (Millipore). The clarified total protein extract was then purified using HisPur Ni-NTA resin
(Cat. No. 8822, Thermo Fisher Scientific) by following a previously used protocol19.

Briefly a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Germany) was coated with 100 ng of
commercially available ACE2 (MBS2563876, MyBiosource, USA) using 100 mM carbonate
buffer and incubated overnight at 4ºC. After incubation, the plates were blocked with blocking
buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking, various concentrations (50-1000 ng) of plant
produced gRBD, dRBD, gS1 variants and baculovirus-Insect cells produced, commercially
available recombinant Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 (RBD, His Tag, Arg319-Phe541, MM~ 25
kDa, MBS2563882, MyBioSource, USA) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After 2 h,
COVID 19 Spike RBD Coronavirus (COVID-19) Polyclonal Antibody was added into each well.
The plate was washed three times with blocking solution (200 μl/well). After washing, wells
were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cat. no. MBS440123, MyBioSource, USA). The
plate was washed three times with 1X PBST washing solution (200 μl/wellfor 5 minute). 200 μl
of Substrate Solution (Sigma) was added to each well. Afterwards plate was incubated in the
dark, for 30 minutes at RT. After the incubation period, the plate was read at 450 nm on a multi
well plate reader.

Stability assessment of plant produced RBD variants and S1protein

The stability analysis of plant produced gRBD, dRBD and gS1 of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant
proteins were examined after incubation at 37 °C for 48, 96, 72 and 96 hours using similar
procedure as described previously21. Protein samples were diluted to 0.5 mg/ mL with PBS and
were transferred into polypropylene Eppendorf low-binding tubes. After incubation at at 37 °C
for 48, 96, 72 and 96 hours, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The
degradation of gRBD, dRBD or gS1 protein bands were calculated and quantified based on SDS-

PAGE and WB analysis using highly sensitive Gene Tools software (Syngene Bioimaging, UK)
and ImageJ software as described previously21.
Immunogenicity studies of N, RBD, N+RBD and S1 domain in mice

Mice received two doses of N, RBD, N+RBD and S1 domain proteins adsorbed to 0.3%
Alhydrogel at three-week intervals (0, 21 days). Groups of seven-week-old mice (6
animals/group) were immunized IM with 5 μg of N, RBD, N+RBD and S1 domainvariants at 0
and 21 days. IgG titers were determined by ELISA in sera collected on 21st or 42nd days post
vaccination from mice immunized with N, S1 or N+ S1 (cocktail) variants.Serum samples were
collected on days -1 (pre-bleed) and 42 (post 2nd vaccination) and assessed for anti-N, antiRBD, anti- N+RBD and anti-S1 domain antibody responses by an IgG ELISA. Wells were
coated with commercial Spike protein or plant produced RBD to detect antibody levels in serum

SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of purified N and S variants

SDS-PAGE analysis of plant produced N and S variants were performed on 10% acrylamide gels
stained with Coomassie (Gel Code Blue, Pierce Rockford, IL). Western blot analysis was
performed after electrophoresis and transfer of the proteins to Polyvinylidene Fluoride
membranes. After transfer, Western blot membranes were blocked with I-Block (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and recombinant proteins detected with an anti-FLAG (N, S1 and
N+S1) or anti-His Antibody (S2), or anti-SARS-COV2 COVID 19 Spike Protein Coronavirus
Monoclonal Antibody (MyBioSource, cat. no. MBS2563837). The image was taken using
highlysensitive GeneGnome XRQ Chemiluminescence imaging system (Syngene, A Division of
Synoptics Ltd).
