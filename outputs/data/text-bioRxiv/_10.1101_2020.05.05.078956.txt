Abstract

28

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is widespread in several countries around the

29

world following its late-2019 emergence in the human population. Rapid development of

30

molecular diagnostic tests and subunit vaccines have been prioritized, and as such evaluating

31

the SARS-CoV-2 genomic plasticity and evolutionary dynamics is an urgent need. We

32

determined the SARS-CoV-2 selectome by calculating rates of pervasive and episodic

33

diversifying selection for every amino acid coding position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To

34

provide context for evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus following a

35

zoonotic spillover into human hosts, we also determined the selectomes of SARS-CoV and

36

MERS-CoV, and performed evolvability calculations for SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV.

37

These analyses identify the amino acid sites within each coding sequence that have been

38

subjected to pervasive diversifying selection or episodic diversifying selection, and report

39

significantly evolvable sites in the ORF1a polyprotein, the spike protein, and the membrane

40

protein of SARS-CoV-2. These findings provide a comprehensive view of zoonotic, highly

41

pathogenic betacoronavirus evolutionary dynamics that can be directly applied to diagnostic

42

assay and vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

47

As of December 2019, seven coronaviruses have been identified as causes of human

48

respiratory tract infections. Four of these viruses, the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) HCoV-229,

49

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, co-circulate annually with many other respiratory

50

viruses across the globe during colder months, and they are usually associated with mild upper

51

and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Severe diseases can be caused by HCoVs, and fatal

52

infections have been documented, especially among individuals with compromised immune

53

systems, young children, and older adults (1-4). In late 2002, numerous cases of severe viral

54

pneumonia were reported in Guangdong Province, China. Over the following nine months,

55

8,448 total cases and 774 deaths were reported in 26 countries across the globe. This disease,

56

called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was determined to be caused by a novel

57

coronavirus named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS is characterized by fever, chills,

58

headache, muscle aches, and other generalized symptoms (5). Severe complications varied in

59

frequency among described patient cohorts, but most fatal cases were associated with severe

60

pneumonia. The case fatality rate of SARS-CoV infection is approximately 10%; however,

61

considerable differences in case fatality rates were observed in patients of different age groups

62

(6). In 2012, a patient from Saudi Arabia with severe lower respiratory tract disease was

63

diagnosed with a novel coronavirus, later called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

64

(MERS-CoV) (7). As of November 2019, nearly 2,500 cases of Middle East respiratory

65

syndrome (MERS) have been diagnosed in 12 countries, and the case fatality rate is estimated

66

to be approximately 34% (8). MERS-CoV continues to cause cases, but they are infrequent and

67

appear to be associated with dromedary camel-to-human spillover events followed by

68

occasional human-to-human transmission events during caretaking (9).

69

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome-

70

related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. The first cases were identified

71

among individuals with links to a seafood market in Wuhan (10). The detection of similar viruses

72

in wild-caught rhinolophid bats and pangolins in China suggests a possible zoonotic reservoir

73

and/or intermediate host(s), respectively; however, recent data suggests that this virus did not

74

directly spill over into the human population from pangolins (11). The exact source of this virus

75

is not currently known, and the description of a small number of clades raise the possibility of a

76

complex series of events preceding the spillover event (12). As of this writing, over 2,000,000

77

human cases of SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

78

have been reported from a total of 210 countries scattered across all continents except

79

Antarctica (13). The case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 varies, but the overall CFR is

80

approximately 2 - 3%, and the disease appears to be most severe in individuals of advanced

81

age. Interestingly, children seem to be spared from severe complications; however, fatal cases

82

among pediatric patients have been described (14-16).

83

Coronaviruses leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; MERS-CoV,

84

SARS-CoV, SARS CoV-2) entered the human population following zoonotic spillover events.

85

These viruses are also known to infect animals, including bats (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and

86

SARS-CoV-2), dromedary camels (MERS-CoV), masked palm civets (SARS-CoV), non-human

87

primates (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV), ferrets (SARS-CoV-2), house cats (SARS-CoV-2), and

88

rodents (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) (1, 17-18). Closely related coronaviruses have also been

89

detected in animals, but they have yet to be implicated in human infections (11).

90

Coronaviruses possess the largest genomes of all RNA viruses so far described. They

91

are comprised of monopartite, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) molecules that

92

vary in length from 27-32 kbp (19). Genomes encode four structural proteins (spike, S;

93

envelope, E; membrane, M, and nucleoprotein, N) and 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs)

94

encoded by a large open reading frame (ORF) termed ORF1ab (20). Initial attachment to host

95

cells occurs following binding of the S protein to its cellular receptor, identified so far for the

96

ARDS-associated viruses to include angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; SARS-CoV,

97

SARS-CoV) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; MERS-CoV) (20). Coronaviruses feature

98

exonuclease activity that maintains fidelity during genome replication, which is an uncommon

99

feature among RNA viruses (21). This unusually high genomic stability makes areas of plasticity

100

in coronaviruses particularly noteworthy, and underscores the need to evaluate elevated rates

101

of diversity carefully. Here we present a comprehensive selectomic and evolvability analysis of

102

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, the coronaviruses causing ARDS in humans, with

103

particular emphasis on evaluating diversity and evolvability in diagnostic targets and sites

104

associated with host adaptation.

105
106

Highly Pathogenic Betacoronaviruses are Subject to both Pervasive and Episodic

107

Diversifying Selection

108

Pervasive Diversifying Selection (PDS) was detected in the N, ORF1a, and ORF1b protein

109

products for all three viruses (Figure 1A-1E, Table 1). The S and M proteins of SARS-CoV and

110

MERS CoV also had multiple sites under PDS, including sites within the S protein binding

111

domain (Fig 2F). A majority of sites under PDS that were able to be mapped onto three-

112

dimensional protein structures were located in disordered regions [3/3 SARS-CoV-2; 7/7 SARS-

113

CoV; 9/11 MERS CoV; Fig. 2A â€“ 2G]. Predicted N-linked glycosylation sites did not appear to

114

correlate with the position of sites under PDS (Fig. 1A-1E). Episodic Diversifying Selection

115

(EDS) was detected in the ORF1a protein product for all three viruses. The S protein of SARS-

116

CoV-2 and the N protein and ORF1b protein product of MERS-CoV also had several sites under

117

EDS (Figure 1A-1E, Table 1). The majority of sites under EDS that were able to be mapped

118

onto the three-dimensional protein structure of the SARS-CoV S protein were located in

119

disordered regions [12/14; Fig. 2F]. In contrast, the only sites under EDS that were able to be

120

mapped onto three-dimensional protein structures for MERS-CoV were located exclusively

121

within Î²-sheet formations [3/3; ORF1a deubiquitinase domain; Fig. 2A]. The single site under

122

EDS for SARS-CoV was not able to be mapped onto a predicted structure. Predicted N-linked

123

glycosylation sites did not appear to correlate with the position of sites under EDS (Fig 1A-1E).

124

PDS was detected in all three viruses, and was most frequently found in MERS-CoV.

125

SARS-CoV had an intermediate level of PDS and very little EDS, whereas SARS-CoV-2 had

126

three traits under PDS and two under EDS. As PDS reflects viral response to persistent

127

selective pressure, the comparatively longer tenure of MERS-CoV as a human pathogen likely

128

accounts for its higher frequency. Similarly, the circulation of SARS-CoV for at least 9 months

129

gave it far longer to adapt to the human host environment via diversification than SARS-CoV-2

130

has yet experienced. In contrast, EDS is often seen transiently after a sudden shift in habitat,

131

and tends to become less detectable over time as sites either optimize within the new host

132

environment or become subject to PDS. It is notable that while the recently emerged SARS-

133

CoV-2 has only two traits under EDS, the S protein EDS rate is the highest selection rate

134

observed for any trait across the three viruses (Table 1). Elevated EDS occurring soon after a

135

host species jump is highly consistent with the role of the S protein in mediating host cell

136

attachment and fusion. SARS-CoV, which appeared once in the human population, circulated

137

for 9 months, and has never re-emerged, had very little detectable EDS. This, too, is consistent

138

with a single introduction into a human host followed by circulation within that host until sites

139

begin to stabilize or operate under PDS. Three MERS-CoV traits were subject to both PDS and

140

EDS. Given that MERS-CoV can be transmitted from human-to-human and from dromedary

141

camels to humans, and has been causing infections in human hosts since at least 2012, the

142

combination of both types of diversifying selection likely reflects simultaneous attempts to adapt

143

to multiple host habitats while passing between them. The E, ORF3, ORF7, and ORF8 protein

144

products were uniformly under purifying selection and were highly conserved.

145

Three-dimensional structural predictions were made for ORF1a, ORF1b, S, and N from

146

each virus (Fig 2A â€“ 2G), and any sites under PDS or EDS were noted. Sites under PDS across

147

all three species exhibited a striking tendency to occur in disordered, low-complexity regions

148

whose structures tend to be highly flexible (Fig. 2). The majority of sites under EDS that were

149

able to be mapped onto the three-dimensional protein structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

150

were located in disordered regions [12/14; Fig. 2F]. In contrast, the only sites under EDS that

151

were able to be mapped onto three-dimensional protein structures for MERS-CoV were located

152

exclusively within Î²-sheet formations [3/3; ORF1a deubiquitinase domain; Fig. 2A]. It is

153

conceivable that EDS acting on sites within a defined structure allows for fine-tuning of camel-

154

versus-human host target specificity while maintaining deubiquitinase enzymatic function as

155

MERS-CoV passes between the two host habitats. Predicted N-linked glycosylation sites did not

156

appear to correlate with the position of sites under PDS or EDS for any trait of any of the three

157

viruses, although structural analysis to confirm modifications of predicted sites is a critical

158

measure to truly establish the absence of a connection between these factors.

159

ORF1a, S, and M of SARS-CoV-2 Have Several Evolvable Amino Acid Sites

160

Evolvability could be calculated for the ORF1a protein product, the S protein, and the M

161

protein. Exclusive purifying selection across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 prevented

162

evolvability calculations for E, ORF3, ORF7, and ORF8, and pervasive diversifying selection in

163

SARS-CoV-2 prevented them for ORF1b and N. Several significantly evolvable amino acid sites

164

were identified in the ORF1a polyprotein, but the distribution was non-uniform. Proteins NSP1,

165

the nucleic acid binding domain, the endopeptidase, and NSP9 had no evolvable sites, whereas

166

NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP7, NSP8, NSP10, the ADP ribose-binding domain, and the

167

deubiquitinase (papain-like protease) domain had several evolvable sites (Fig 3A). Significantly

168

evolvable sites were found throughout the S protein, including within the binding motif (Fig. 3B,

169

Table 2). Of those that were able to be mapped, evolvable amino acid positions in S and ORF1a

170

were frequently found in predicted disordered regions (Fig. 3A â€“ 3B). Eight evolvable sites were

171

identified in the M protein irrespective of predicted secondary structure, occurring within

172

predicted Î±-helices, Î²-strands, and coiled coils (Fig. 3C).

173

Using the recently emerged, relatively low-diversity SARS-CoV-2 as a base and the

174

extensively circulated, pervasively selected SARS-CoV as an endpoint query, the evolvability of

175

each amino acid position for ORF1a, S, and M was calculated. Uniform purifying selection

176

acting on ORF3, E, ORF7, and ORF8 in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 indicate that these traits

177

are not significantly evolvable following a host species jump. In contrast, PDS has already

178

measurably acted on ORF1b and N, making SARS-CoV-2 an already inappropriate base point

179

for these traits. Numerous sites in the ORF1a protein product and the S protein are significantly

180

evolvable, including some within known functional motifs. Evolvable sites were detected in

181

NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP7, NSP8, NSP10, the ADP ribose-binding domain, and the

182

deubiquitinase (papain-like protease) domain, suggesting that the functions of these ORF1a

183

cleavage-product proteins are subject to diversification during adaptation to a human host.

184

Similarly, many evolvable sites were detected within the S protein including within the binding

185

domain. The majority of these sites also fall within highly disordered regions (Fig. 3B). This is

186

consistent with the notion of host cell binding and entry being a strong driver of diversification

187

upon entry into a new host. Further, the role of the S protein as an immunodominant antigen for

188

both SARS-CoV (28) and MERS-CoV (29) suggests that, in addition to functional selection,

189

immune selection could also play a role in diversification and evolvability. Notably, a SNP found

190

across all SARS-CoV-2 strains reported results in a change from lysine in SARS-CoV to

191

arginine in SARS-CoV-2. This substitution is moderately synonymous (K-R BLOSUM62 score =

192

2), and therefore the site is not under significant PDS. While this is also not flagged as a

193

significantly evolvable site, it nevertheless introduces an R-G-D motif in the S protein of SARS-

194

CoV-2, which may confer integrin-binding capacity onto the virus (30). The biological impact of

195

this change has yet to be explored.

196

SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Tests and Subunit Vaccines Target Positively Selected,

197

Evolvable Traits

198

Management and control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires rapid and expansive

199

diagnostic testing. The diagnosis of coronavirus infections including COVID-19 is currently

200

performed by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) methods such as real-time reverse

201

transcription PCR (rRT-PCR). Several NAATs to detect SARS-CoV-2 have received Emergency

202

Use Authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration and equivalent

203

international authorities (Table 3). The majority of these assays include primers and probes

204

targeting multiple sites within the SARS-CoV-2 genome; however, it is notable that no tests

205

exclusively target ORFs with evolvability and/or diversifying selection rates of 0. Only four

206

SARS-CoV-2 NAAT platforms (i.e., the BioFire 2.0, the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, the

207

Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2, and the Luminex NxTAG CoV Extended Panel) include a target

208

ORFs (ORF8, E, E, and E, respectively) that is under purifying selection and does not have

209

significantly evolvable sites. While the specific primer and probe sequences of the assays

210

described in Table 3 are largely proprietary and thus could not be assessed in this study, the

211

locations of those sequences and of future diagnostic tests should be evaluated in the context of

212

sites encoding significantly evolvable amino acid positions and those under pervasive

213

diversifying selection to minimize the chance of divergent viruses escaping detection

214

(Supplemental Datasets S1, S2, S3, S4). Similarly, proposed nucleic acid and subunit vaccines

215

must similarly consider evolvable and positively selected sites to minimize the possibility of viral

216

escape variants.

217
218

Discussion

219

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the third Betacoronavirus to emerge in the past

220

twenty years. All known human-pathogenic coronaviruses are transmissible from human to

221

human and are also known to infect animals (1, 17, 25). Other coronaviruses, including SARS-

222

CoV-like coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs), have also been detected in animals, but they have yet to

223

be implicated in human infections (11). Many comparative genomic analyses have described

224

single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (12, 26), but

225

ascribing function to those SNPs absent of context can lead to over-interpretation (27).

226

Determination of the sites under diversifying selection and sites that are significantly evolvable

227

in those coronaviruses causing ARDS (i.e., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) that have circulated

228

among a novel human host can inform expectations around accumulating diversity in SARS-

229

CoV-2 as it begins the process of adaptation to a human habitat.

230

Diversification of viral adhesins is a common mechanism of host adaption or expansion

231

of target tissues, and PDS (MER-CoV, SARS-CoV) and EDS (SARS-CoV-2) acting on sites in

232

the S protein is consistent with that trend. However, we detected several additional traits with

233

sites that are diversifying in response to selective pressure, underscoring the need for multiple

234

areas of the virus infectious cycle to adapt to a novel host for a successful species jump to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.078956; this version posted May 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

235

occur. For example, sites under PDS were detected in the N protein of all three viruses, possibly

236

indicating that interactions between nucleocapsids and host cell ER-Golgi intermediate

237

compartment (ERGIC) as progeny virions mature is a point where host cell permissiveness can

238

exert itself. Similarly, PDS in the nucleic acid binding domain and the M protein may reflect that

239

RNA targets or components needed for envelope maturation represent points critical for novel

240

host adaptation.

241

Identification of evolvable residues is possible by the presence of homologues in two

242

species, one of which is under PDS and the other of which is not in its current habitat (31).

243

Human coronaviruses can be both plastic (e.g., HCoV-OC43 [32]) and highly conserved (e.g.,

244

HCoV-229E [33]), indicating that evolvability analysis is a technique with potential to identify

245

more mutable species in wildlife reservoirs. This underscores the need to conduct continuous

246

viromic surveillance of wildlife reservoirs, as identification of coronaviruses with significantly

247

evolvable traits are likely at higher probability for successful zoonotic spillover events.

248

Here we describe the positive selectomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the partial

249

positive selectome of MERS-CoV, and the identification of significantly evolvable sites in SARS-

250

CoV-2 based on the natural history of SARS-CoV. Pervasive diversifying selection was detected

251

in the significantly evolvable ORF1a polyprotein and the S protein of MERS-CoV and SARS-

252

CoV, and EDS was detected in the same proteins of SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that

253

host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is likely to lead to viral diversification parallel to that

254

seen for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Detection of PDS in all three species in the ORF1b

255

polyprotein and N protein are further consistent with that outcome. Consideration of significantly

256

evolvable residues identified can inform the design and refinement of diagnostic tests and

257

subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, and periodic revisions to the SARS-CoV-2 selectome over

258

time will be immensely valuable to confirm the predicted evolvability of noted amino acid sites.

Figure 1: PDS and EDS Predictions in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Selection
values (Y axis) for ORF1a (A), ORF1b (B), S (C), M (D), and N (E) are plotted at each amino
acid position (X axis). PDS values for each trait are shown on the left side of the panel, and
EDS values are shown on the right. The cutoff for significance is shown as a red line; values
rising above the line indicate diversifying selection acting at that amino acid position. Important
functional domains are boxed in red and identified on each panel. Predicted N-linked
glycosylation sites are shown as purple arrowheads.

Figure 3: Evolvability Measures of SARS-CoVs. Evolvability (Y axis) was detected at multiple
amino acid sites (X axis) in the ORF1a polyprotein (A), the S protein (B), and the M protein (C).
The cutoff for significance is shown as a pink line; values rising above the line indicate that the
amino acid position is significant evolvable. Black boxes indicate the region depicted in the
accompanying three dimensional structural models (A, B). All amino acid positions are included
in the M protein secondary structure prediction (C). Evolvable residues appearing within the
structural predictions are shown as white boxes (A, B) or black arrowheads (C), and were
notably frequent in disordered regions. The novel S protein R-G-D motif arising in SARS-CoV-2
is indicated as a pink box and appears within a disordered region of the binding domain (B).
Functional domains are indicated as pink blocks below the X axis [label abbreviations - 1:
