ABSTRACT

50

As of middle May 2020, the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has infected over 4

51

million people with more than 300 thousand death as official reports1,2. The key to

52

understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of

53

mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a

54

few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and

55

their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. Here, using deep sequencing data, we

56

achieved and characterized consensus genomes and intra-host genomic variants from 32 serial

57

samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The 32 consensus genomes revealed the

58

coexistence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host

59

single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30/40) iSNVs presented in single patient, while ten

60

iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparison of

61

allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed genetic divergence between intra-host populations of

62

the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events

63

among intra-host transmissions. Nonetheless, we observed a maintained viral genetic diversity

64

within GIT, showing an increased population with accumulated mutations developed in the

65

tissue-specific environments. The iSNVs identified here not only show spatial divergence of

66

intra-host viral populations, but also provide new insights into the complex virus-host

67

interactions.

MAIN

70

From January 25 to February 10 in 2020, we collected a total of 62 serial clinical samples from

71

eight hospitalized patients (GZMU cohort) confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time

72

RT-qPCR (Table S1). All patients had direct contacts with confirmed cases during the early

73

stage of the outbreak. Most patients, except P15 and P62, had severe symptoms and received

74

mechanical ventilation in ICU, including the patient P01 who passed away eventually. The

75

patient P01 also showed much lower antibody (IgG and IgM) responses (Table S1) compared

76

to other patients. We then deep sequenced the 62 clinical samples using metatranscriptomic

77

and/or hybrid capture methods (Table S1). The numbers of SARS-CoV-2 reads per million

78

(SARS-CoV-2 RPM) among the metatranscriptomic data correlated well with the corresponding

79

RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct), reflecting a robust estimation of viral load (R = 0.71, P = 6.7e-11)

80

(Fig. 1a). The respiratory tract (RT: Nose, Sputum, Throat) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT: Anus,

81

Feces) samples showed higher SARS-CoV-2 RPMs compared to gastric mucosa and urine

82

samples (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, RT and GIT samples from two patients with mild symptoms

83

showed relatively low viral loads among their respective sample types. The data here may

84

reflect an active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in RT and GIT, especially in patients with severe

85

symptoms3,4.

86

Here, using metatranscriptomic data, we obtained 32 consensus complete genomes

87

from the clinical samples with at least 60-fold sequence coverage (Table S1 and Table S2).

88

Comparing the assemblies to the reference sequence (GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_402119)

89

revealed 14 consensus variants (6 synonymous and 8 non-synonymous) located mostly in

90

ORF1ab, S and N genes (Table S2). Most of the consensus variants were also detected among

91

public sequences, including the widespread associated variants (C8782T and T28144C)

92

detected in four patients (P10, P13, P14 and P62). The novel consensus variant causes a

93

frameshift at the end of ORF8 in the patient P14, showing the phenotypic plasticity during the

94

evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Evolutionary relationships showed that the consensus SARS-CoV-2

95

genomes of the GZMU cohort belonged to distinct clades, including clades defined by T28144C

96

and A23403G, respectively (Fig. 1c). Remarkably, we observed distinct SARS-CoV-2 genomes

97

co-existed in the GIT samples of the patient (P08) with three nucleotide differences (Fig. 1d and

98

Table S2), suggesting independent replications of different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes within the

99

same host5.

100

Although plenty of polymorphic sites were identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations,

101

intra-host variant spectra of closely related viral genomes are mostly disguised by the

102

consensus sequences. We firstly examined the reproducibility of our experimental procedures

103

for allele frequency identification. Only a minor difference of alternative allele frequencies (AAFs)

104

was observed among biological replicates of two selected samples (Fig. S1), showing that the

105

estimated population composition was marginally affected by independent experimental

106

procedures. To control false discovery rate, we applied a stringent approach to detect iSNVs.

107

The iSNVs were identified from the 32 samples using metatranscriptomic data and then verified

108

using hybrid capture data, which are available for most (27/32) samples (Table S3 and Table

109

S4). Overall, we observed 1 to 23 iSNVs in six patients with a cut-off of 5% minor allele

110

frequency (Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b). When an iSNV was discovered in one patient, we reduced the

111

cut-off to 2% to detect that iSNV from the rest samples of the same patient (see methods). The

112

AAFs of iSNVs detected from the metagenomic data correlated well with those of the hybrid

113

capture data (Spearman’s ρ = 0.99, P < 2.2e-16; Fig. S2). Furthermore, the numbers of the

114

observed iSNVs did not correlate with the sequencing coverage (Fig. S3), suggesting that the

115

coverage of metatrancriptomic data was sufficient to estimate intra-host variation in most

116

samples.

117

We further analyzed intra-host variation across genes for evidence of natural selection.

118

Overall, the 40 identified iSNV sites (10 synonymous iSNVs and 30 non-synonymous iSNVs)

119

distributed evenly across genomic regions (Fig. 2c; Table S3). High proportion of non-

120

synonymous iSNVs suggests that most iSNVs were either under frequent positive selection or

121

insufficient purifying selection. However, we did not observe significant difference in AAFs

122

between non-synonymous and synonymous iSNVs (Fig. 2d) and among codon positions (Fig.

123

S4), indicating a relaxed intra-host selection. It is likely that most of those non-synonymous

124

iSNVs will be removed by purifying selection and/or genetic drift in a longer timescale6.

125

Nonetheless, the exact functional and evolutionary relevance of the intra-host variants remain to

126

be explored.

127

One central task when estimating intra-host variation is to identify the source of iSNVs.

128

Overall, the distribution of the iSNVs among samples does not correlate well with the consensus

129

SNPs (Fig. 2a). Samples carrying the same consensus SNPs generally had different iSNVs,

130

particularly in P01, P10 and P13. Here, we classified the iSNVs into i) rare iSNVs (30/40)

131

detected in a single patient, and ii) common iSNVs (10/40) detected in at least two patients

132

and/or identical to consensus variants. The ten common iSNVs did not show significant higher

133

AAFs than the rare iSNVs (Fig. 2e). Notably, the ten common iSNVs include two iSNVs

134

(G11083T and C21711T) exclusively detected in the GIT populations of P01, P08 and P10

135

(Table S4). Among the common iSNVs, G11083T is the most widespread consensus variant

136

distributed in multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that it might derive from recurring

137

mutations on distinct strains rather than the mutation on a single ancestral strain. Interestingly,

138

although G11083T was detected as an intra-host variant in the GIT samples of three patients, it

139

was not detected in the corresponding RT samples, indicating a recurrent mutation of this loci,

140

especially in the GIT population. Interestingly, G11083T locate in a region encoding a predicted

141

T-cell epitope7, suggesting that recurrent mutation may provide genetic plasticity to better adapt

142

against host defenses.

143

Using Shannon entropy, we observed a significantly higher genetic diversity within the

144

GIT samples than that of RT samples (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P = 1.4e-05; Fig. 3a and Table

145

S5), reflecting an increased viral population size within the GIT samples. We further investigated

146

the genetic differentiation between the two places. Notably, no iSNVs was shared between RT

147

and GIT samples from the same patients, suggesting a clear genetic divergence among intra-

148

host viral populations. Here we used L1-norm distance to estimate genetic dissimilarity among

149

samples based on iSNVs and their AAFs and compared that between samples within and

150

among hosts (Fig. 3b and Table S6). As expected, genetic distances among samples from the

151

same host were smaller than those among inter-host samples (Fig. 3b and Table S6). Within

152

each host, the greatest genetic differentiation was observed among GIT samples and between

153

GIT and RT samples, while the differentiation among RT samples was relatively small. For

154

example, seven iSNVs were shared among the GIT samples of P01, while none of them was

155

observed in RT samples (Fig. 2a). It seems that the frequent genetic divergence between GIT

156

and RT populations is mostly driven by bottleneck events during distant intra-host transmissions.

157

However, the exact interaction mechanisms among intra-host populations require further

158

investigation.

159

Previous studies have revealed longitudinal evolution of intra-host populations in some

160

important RNA viruses8-10. We firstly compared the detected iSNVs among serial samples. All

161

the iSNVs of early GIT samples also presented in later GIT samples, while all the iSNVs

162

detected in RT samples disappeared in the following samples, suggesting that the viral genetic

163

diversity is better maintained in GIT. We further focused on the allele frequency dynamics of

164

GIT iSNVs of P01 and P08, respectively. Notably, most GIT iSNVs were remarkably stable and

165

showed continuous trends of AAFs across sampling dates. For example, within the GIT

166

population of P01, seven iSNVs showed continuous trends of allele frequency dynamics,

167

including four iSNVs with increased AAFs and two iSNVs with decreased AAFs across the three

168

sampling dates (Fig. 4a). Given their similar growth rates but distinct allele frequencies, it is

169

likely that more than two genetically related haplotypes co-existed in within P01. Similar patterns

170

were also observed in the GIT population of P08 (Fig. 4b). Notably, the dynamics of intra-host

171

variants changed the consensus allele (>50%) of three genomic loci (3160, 21711 and 28854)

172

of P08. Taken together, the iSNVs and their frequencies suggest that the viral populations in

173

GIT is more stable than those in RT. Nonetheless, in both P01 and P08, we observed increased

174

AAFs of C21711T and G11083T, suggesting that these two variants might be adaptively

175

selected, especially in the GIT. Whether viral adaptation is involved in the intra-host divergence

176

among distant populations warrants further investigation.

177

We further phased the proximal iSNVs into local haplotypes using paired-end mapped

178

reads (Table S7). Most minor haplotypes had one nucleotide difference from the dominant

179

haplotype of the same sample, suggesting that they might derive from the main strain of the

180

population. Nonetheless, we observed one exception in the GIT population of P01, covering the

181

variable sites of C21707T, C21711T and A21717G (Fig. S5). With the cut-off of 1%, one

182

dominant haplotype (T-C-A) and two minor haplotypes (T-T-A and T-T-G) were identified.

183

Despite that minor haplotype (T-T-A) was relatively stable (8%–10%), the proportion of the

184

dominant haplotype (T-C-A) decreased from 89% to 67%, while that of the minor haplotype (T-

185

T-G) increased from 2% to 22%. Based on the dynamics and nucleotide differences among

186

three haplotypes, we hypothesized that the minor haplotype (T-T-G) may derive from the

187

dominant haplotype (T-C-A) via the intermediate haplotype (T-T-A), showing a maintained

188

diversity within GIT population. More importantly, our observation supports that the mutated

189

viruses are capable to replicate and hence, accumulate more variants within GIT of the same

190

host, leading to an increased genetic diversity in the tissue specific environment.

191

Given the observations in patients with influenza8, stochastic process is the dominant

192

factor driving the intra-host population dynamics, which is especially the case during distant

193

intra-host transmissions. For SARS-CoV-2, one possible intra-host transmission route is from

194

the respiratory tract to the gastrointestinal epithelia. During the intra-host transmission,

195

population composition may change dramatically through random sampling when a novel sub-

196

population was established from a small group of viruses of a larger population13. This is

197

supported by the genetic divergence of intra-host variants between RT and GIT populations.

198

The stochastic process between and within intra-host populations seems to also attenuate the

199

efficacy of intra-host purifying selection, as shown by the even distribution of AAFs among

200

synonymous and non-synonymous iSNVs. However, under the traditional genetic population

201

theories, novel founder populations are expected to have a low genetic variation due to the

202

subsampling from the original population. In contrast, viral populations in GIT showed a higher
8

203

genetic diversity than those in RT, reflecting a larger effective viral population size in the GIT.

204

This result is also consistent with the high viral load in GIT (Fig. 1b). During the viral replication,

205

both RT and GIT populations showed evidence of generating intra-host variants. Our findings

206

further demonstrated that those novel and/or recurrent intra-host variants are better maintained

207

within GIT, and hence, leading to a higher level of genetic diversity and potentially larger

208

effective population size in GIT. In contrast, the intra-host variants seemed to be less stable in

209

RT, probably associated with a more dramatic genetic drift in RT populations. Differences in

210

other factors, such as host-cell entry, immune responses and microbial communities among

211

tissue specific environments, may further drive the structuring among intra-host population. On

212

the other hand, those differences may also drive viral adaptation, given the two GIT specific

213

non-synonymous iSNVs observed in our study. However, it is still challenging to fully

214

disentangle the influences of stochastic processes and natural selection, considering the

215

frequent confounding genetic signals of these two processes.

216

Intra-host variants were identified in many RNA viruses8,9,11-14. Here, using deep

217

sequencing data of serial samples, we revealed the existence of intra-host variation within

218

COVID-19 patients, which is likely to be contributed by novel and/or recurring intra-host

219

mutations. Furthermore, our observation demonstrated a frequent genetic divergence between

220

GIT and RT samples, mostly driven by bottleneck events among intra-host transmissions.

221

Nonetheless, we observed a maintained viral genetic diversity within GIT, reflecting an

222

increased population with accumulated mutations developed in the tissue-specific environments.

223

Exact biological mechanisms of the intra-host population dynamics remain to be explored in

224

future. Our data presented here also reflects the evolutionary capacity of SARS-CoV-2 in

225

developing viral escape and drug resistance during infection. More broadly, these data provide

226

new insights into the complex virus-host interactions.

METHODS

230

Patient enrollment and Ethics statement

231

Eight pneumonia patients, referred as GZMU cohort, were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2

232

infection between January 25 to February 10 in 2020 and hospitalized at the first affiliated

233

hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (six patients), the fifth affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-

234

sen University (one patient), and Yangjiang People’s Hospital (one patient). Serial samples

235

were collected, including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, gastric mucosa, urine, plasma,

236

anal swabs and feces. The overall research plan was reviewed and approved by the Ethics

237

Committees of all the three hospitals. All the information regarding patients has been

238

anonymized.

239
240

Real-time RT-qPCR and Metatranscriptomic sequencing

241

A total of 62 serial clinical samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19 (Table S1) were

242

used for Real-time RT-qPCR. Clinical samples were subjected to RNA extraction using QIAamp

243

Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). An in-house real-time RT-qPCR was performed

244

by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and N gene regions (Zybio Inc.). Human DNA was

245

removed using DNase I and RNA concentration was measured using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit

246

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA-depleted and purified RNA was used to

247

construct double-stranded DNA library using MGIEasy RNA Library preparation reagent set

248

(MGI, Shenzhen, China) following the protocol described in our previous study15. High

249

throughput sequencing of the constructed libraries was then carried out on the DNBSEQ-T7

250

platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China) to generate metatranscriptomic data of 100bp long paired-end

251

reads.

254

For a subset of samples (Table S1), genomic content of SARS-CoV-2 was enriched from the

255

double-stranded DNA libraries mentioned above using the 2019-nCoVirus DNA/RNA Capture

256

Panel (BOKE, Jiangsu, China) as described in our previous study15. The SARS-CoV-2 content

257

enriched samples were used to construct DNA Nanoballs (DNBs) based libraries, which were

258

then sequenced using the same protocol described above.

259
260

Data filtering and Genome assembly

261

Data filtering was performed following the procedures described in previous research15. Briefly,

262

for both metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture data, sequence data of each sample were firstly

263

mapped to a pre-defined database comprising representative genomes of coronaviridae. The

264

mapped reads were then subject to the removal of low-quality, duplications, adaptor

265

contaminations and low-complexity to collect high quality coronaviridae-like reads. We also

266

compared the allele frequencies among the two data types when available, samples with

267

conflicted consensus alleles were removed. For the samples with 60-fold of metatranscriptomic

268

data, coronaviridae-like metatranscriptomic reads were used to generate consensus genomes

269

270

mapped to the reference genome (GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_402119) using Pilon (v. 1.23)16.

271

To prevent false discovery, base positions reporting an alternative allele with the following

272

conditions were masked as N: 1) sequencing coverage less than 5-fold; 2) sequencing

273

coverage less than 10-fold and the proportion of reads with the alternative allele less than 80%.

274

The collected coronaviridae-like reads were also de novo assembled using SPAdes (v. 3.14.0)

275

with default settings17 with a maximum of 100-fold coverage of read data. Structural variations

276

between the de novo assemblies and consensus genomes, if any, were manually checked and

277

resolved based on read alignments. Nucleotide differences between the consensus sequences

278

and the reference genome were summarized into artificial Variant Call Format (VCF) files, which

279

were annotated using SnpEff (v.2.0.5)18 with default settings.

Phylogenetic analysis

282

Available consensus sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S8) were collected from GISAID

283

database (https://www.gisaid.org/) on 5th April, 2020, after the removal of highly homologous

284

sequences, 122 representative virus strains (Table S8) were used to infer evolutionary

285

relationships with the assembled genomes. Within the GZMU cohort, only one genome was

286

selected when more than one identical genome was achieved from the same patient. The

287

assembled SARS-CoV-2 and selected representative genomes were aligned using MAFFT with

288

default settings. A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was inferred using the software IQ-TREE

289

(v.1.6.12)19, with the best fit nucleotide substitution model selected by ModelFinder from the

290

same software. The inferred ML tree was then visualized using the R package ggtree20 (v.3.10).

291

Major branches and the defining nucleotide mutations were manually labelled.

292
293

Summary of public consensus variants

294

All the consensus sequences of the public strains were aligned with the reference genome

295

(GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_402119) using MAFFT (v.5.3)21 with default settings. Nucleotide

296

differences between the consensus sequences and the reference genome were summarized

297

into an artificial VCF file, which was then were annotated using SnpEff (v.2.0.5) with default

298

settings. The linkage disequilibrium among the identified consensus variants were estimated

299

using VCFtools (v.0.1.16).

Calling of iSNVs

302

Here, an intra-host single nucleotide variant (iSNV) was defined as the alternative allele co-

303

existed with the reference allele at identical genomic position within the same sample. To

304

minimize false discovery, iSNVs were identified on samples with at least 60-fold mean

metatranscriptomic sequencing coverage and then verified using hybrid-capture data when

306

available.

307

First, paired-end metatranscriptomic reads were mapped to the reference genome

308

(GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_402119) using BWA aln (v.0.7.16) with default parameters22.

309

Duplicated

310

(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) with default settings. Base composition of each position

311

was summarized from the mapped reads using the software pysamstats (v. 1.1.2)

312

(https://github.com/alimanfoo/pysamstats), and then subject to iSNV site identification with

313

following criteria: 1) base quality larger than 20; 2) sequencing coverage of paired-end mapped

314

reads >= 10; 3) at least five reads support the minor allele 4) minor allele frequency >= 5%; 5)

315

strand bias ratio of reads with the minor allele and reads with major allele less than ten-fold. To

316

minimize false discoveries, sites with more than one alternative allele were filtered out.

317

Biological effects of the identified iSNVs were annotated using the SnpEff (v.2.0.5) with default

318

settings. Alternative allele frequencies (AAFs) at the identified iSNV sites were measured by the

319

proportion of paired-end mapped reads with alternative alleles. When an iSNV was detected in

320

one patient, the detection cut-off of that iSNV was reduced to 2% for the rest samples of the

321

same patient. Only the AAFs more than 2% with at least three reads were kept for the following

322

analyses. All the iSNVs were verified using hybrid capture data when available. At the iSNV

323

sites, the allele with higher frequency was defined as major allele, while one with less frequency

324

was defined as minor allele, regardless whether it is different from the reference allele. A

325

heatmap was generated to visualize the AAFs for all samples using the pheatmap package in R

326

(v.3.6.1). A subset of the identified iSNVs were validated by Sanger sequencing using the

327

protocol described in previous study15.

330

The distribution of iSNVs among genetic components and patients were summarized and

331

visualized using the Python package matplotlib (v.3.2.1). Alternative allele frequencies on all

332

the detected iSNV sites were compared among patients. To avoid oversampling, for the patient

333

with more than sample, only the median AAF among all samples of that patient was used for

334

comparison. Alternative allele frequencies among synonymous and nonsynonymous variants

335

and among codon positions were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test and visualized

336

through boxplot using the R package ggplot (v.3.3.0). For the iSNVs detected in patient P01 and

337

P08, the dynamics of AAFs was visualized across time points using the R package ggplot
