Abstract

21

We present a structure-based model of phosphorylation-dependent binding and sequestration

22

of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the impact of two consecutive amino acid changes

23

R203K and G204R. Additionally, we studied how mutant strains affect HLA-specific antigen

24

presentation and correlated these findings with HLA allelic population frequencies. We discovered

25

RG>KR mutated SARS-CoV-2 expands the ability for differential expression of the N protein

26

epitope on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) of varying Human Leukocyte Antigen

27

(HLA) origin. The N protein LKR region K203, R204 of wild type (SARS-CoVs) and (SARS-

28

CoV-2) observed HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:21, but mutant SARS-CoV-2 observed HLA-

29

A*31:01 and HLA-A*68:01. Expression of HLA-A genotypes associated with the mutant strain

30

occurred more frequently in all populations studied.

31

Importance

32

The novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease renowned as 2019-nCoV

33

(or COVID-19). HLA allele frequencies worldwide could positively correlate with the severity of

34

coronavirus cases and a high number of deaths.

1. Introduction

41

A major outbreak of a novel coronavirus isolated in china called SARS-CoV2 leads to the

42

global declaration of a worldwide pandemic (1). The novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV2

43

causes a disease renowned as 2019-nCoV (or COVID-19) (1-3). Sequencing of the viral genome

44

and characterization of immunogenic viral proteins has been crucial for understanding the virus

45

and creating targeted vaccinations and treatments. Additionally, wide variation in the clinical

46

presentation of COVID-19 ranging from an asymptomatic presentation to disabling multi-organ

47

failure has led to the study of differential host-pathogen interaction specifically relating to

48

population-based Human Leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele frequencies (4, 5).

49

SARS-CoV2 is an RNA virus and structurally contains 16 open reading frames (ORFs).

50

ORF1a express 11 nonstructural proteins (Nsps) from Nsp1 to Nsp11, with the genes of ORF1b

51

expressing proteins from Nsp12 to Nsp16 (6, 7). Major structural proteins including Spike (S),

52

envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are encoded by other ORFs. The N

53

proteins of SARS-CoV are highly basic structural proteins localized in the cytoplasm and the

54

nucleolus of Trichoplusia ni BT1 Tn 5B1-4 cells (8). Previous studies have indicated the N

55

proteins of other coronaviruses are extensively phosphorylated and bound to viral RNA to form a

56

helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that comprises the viral core structure (9). Recently, mutations in

57

N segment of SARS-CoV2 have been reported (10). Two replacements in positions R203K and

58

G204R of N proteins have been found in several countries, but their potential effects in the protein

59

structure have not been discussed.

61

We present a structure-based model of phosphorylation-dependent binding and

62

sequestration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the impact of two consecutive amino

63

acid changes R203K and G204R. Additionally, we studied how mutant strains affect HLA-

64

specific antigen presentation and correlated these findings with HLA allelic population

65

frequencies.

2. Results

67

2.1. Sequence Alignments and Clustering of LKR of CoVs N-protein

68

ClustalW multiple sequence alignment was employed to align the LKR (68 nucleotides

69

long) of CoV N protein aligned for bat/pangolin models and human models SARS-

70

COVs/MERS-COV. Notably, The Gly at position 204 is conserved among the closely related

71

coronaviruses Bat coronavirus pangolin, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, but variable for SARS-

72

CoV2n (fig. 1(a)). The clustering trees of coronavirus are displayed in figure 1 (b). Sequence

73

alignments suggested that other coronavirus N proteins might share the same structural

74

organization based on intrinsic disorder predictor profiles and secondary structure predictions

75

(Fig. 2).

76

2.2. Calculation of N-protein LKR Residue Energies

77

A plot of N-proteins residues indicates the local model quality by plotting knowledge-based

78

energies as a function of an amino acid sequence position. A detailed energy calculation of wild

79

and mutant types revealed residues 203/204 are located in the highest energy level area (Fig. 3).

80

The mutant type showed slightly high free energy at residues 203/204 a.a. KR compared to the

81

wild type; suggesting enhanced structural flexibility and increased the tendency for the formation

82

of a coil or a bend in the secondary structure. The relative orientation of NTD and CTD, as well

83

as the conformations of the disordered regions (N-arm, LKR, and C-tail), are drawn randomly to

84

reflect the dynamic nature of the N protein (Fig. 3)

85

2.3. Calculation of Putative Phosphorylation Sites

86

We also analyzed predictable phosphorylation sites of N-protein by employing the NetPhos

87

3.1 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/, accessed on 14 Sep 2020). The linker

88

region of SARS-CoV N-protein (LKR) contains a Ser/Arg-rich region with a high number of

89

putative phosphorylation sites (a.a. 172–206). The sites of contiguous amino acid changes of

90

203R>K and 204G>R are located in the SR-rich region which is known to be intrinsically

91

disordered. We predicted a nonspecific kinase phosphorylation site at Ser202 and a specific

92

CDK5, RSK, and GSK3 phosphorylation sites at Ser206, all of which are close to the RG>KR

93

mutation (Fig. 4). When Ser202/206 and Thr205 are phosphorylated, charge neutralization of

94

the nearby positively charged sidechains likely takes place. The G204R mutation decreases the

95

conformational entropy of neutralization by increasing the positive charge in the vicinity of

96

negatively charged P-Ser202/205 phosphate groups (Fig. 5).

97

2.4 Protein Localization

98

Subcellular localization of the N-protein was predicted using the DeepLoc 1.0 neural network

99

algorithm. The resultant values of 0.861 and 0.913 obtained for wild and mutant N protein

100

respectively suggest the protein is predominantly found in the nucleus (Fig. 6 a,b). The N-protein

101

position prediction graph (Fig.6,c,d) confirmed a long peak in mutation areas K203 and R204,

102

defined based on SARS-CoV-2 data.

103

2.5 Identification of N-protein B‐cell epitopes

104

We used the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to determine linear B‐cell hosted epitopes

105

utilizing the incorporated Chou & Fasman Beta-Turn prediction module threshold 1.07. We

106

supplied the FASTA sequence of the targeted protein as an input assuming all default parameters.

107

LKR (a.a.170-206) region of N-protein shown significant antigenic epitopes with potential binding

108

to B lymphocytes cells (Fig. 7). IEDB software also predicted epitopes based on N-protein

109

conformation and residue exposure, and independently graphed a broad peak in mutation areas

110

K203 and R204, the likely epitope regions defined based on SARS-CoV-2 data (Fig. S2).

111

2.6 Identification of T‐cell epitopes

112

We found that MHC polymorphism typically results in differential MHC epitope

113

recognition within the N-protein LKR K203 R204 region of wild type (SARS-CoV-2) as

114

compared to mutant (SARS-CoV2). Wild type (SARS-CoV-2) observed HLA-A*30:01 and HLA

115

31:01 predictions, but mutant SARS-CoV-2 observed HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-A*68:01

116

predictions (Table 1,2). The frequency of HLA class I representation within South American,

117

Japanese, and Iranian populations was recorded for both wild type and mutant strains. HLA class

118

I molecules associated with mutant strains occurred more frequently in all three population groups,

119

with the most significant increase seen in the South American population (18.38% in wild type

120

versus 28.25% in the mutant).

121

3. Discussion

122

Variations in Host Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene expression can influence

123

antigenic presentation of coronavirus epitopes. The Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of many

124

coronaviruses are highly immunogenic epitopes expressed abundantly during infection. Using

125

genome sequencing and prediction models, we characterized a mutation in the N-protein which

126

affected the viral structure, function, and immunogenicity.

127

In the case of SARS-CoV N protein, previous studies have demonstrated that there are three

128

intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (residues 1–44, 182–247, and 366–422) which modulate

129

the RNA-binding activity of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (11).

130

The middle IDR, which we coined the linker region of SARS-CoV N protein (a.a. 182–247) LKR,

131

and C-terminal IDR have both been implicated in the oligomerization of the N protein (12, 13).

132

Five a.a variations at position 203 (R203K/M/S/I/G) within the SR-rich domain have been

133

studied of the five variations, substitution R203K occurred most frequently in 68.09% of the

134

mutated strains globally followed by the substitution G204R found in 67.94% mutated

135

strains of the SARS-CoV-2 [19].

136

We identified phosphorylation sites in close proximity to the 203/204: RG>KR mutation and

137

modeled the mutation’s potential role in the alteration of protein structure and favorable

138

electrostatic interaction between positively charged Arg and the negatively charged P-

139

Ser202/205. A decrease in structural instability could contribute to a potential increase in

140

immunogenicity of the mutant variant.

141

The N protein wild type is known to be a representative antigen for the T-cell response in

142

a vaccine setting, inducing SARS-specific T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity (14, 15).

143

We discovered RG>KR mutated SARS-CoV-2 expands the ability for differential expression of

144

the N protein epitope on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) of varying Human

145

Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) origin. Specifically, the N protein LKR region K203 R204 of wild

146

type (SARS-CoVs) and (SARS-CoV-2) observed HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:21, but mutant

147

SARS-CoV-2 observed HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-A*68:01. Expression of HLA-A genotypes

148

associated with the mutant strain occurred more frequently in all populations studied (South

149

American, Japanese, and Iranian) with the most significant increase in frequency seen in the

150

South Americans.

151

Major MHC-I molecules play a key role in the recognition of intracellular pathogens.

152

HLA-A*31:01, associated with mutant and wild type strains is reported to be linked with

153

carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including medicine

154

reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),

155

and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (16). HL-A*68:01 was only associated with the mutant

156

strain in our analysis. Two previous independent studies linked the HLA-A*68:01 allele, which

157

is expressed at 5.2–25% allele frequency, with severe influenza disease during the 2009 influenza

158

pandemic (17, 18).

159

The frequency of the HLA-A*68:01 allomorph is high among the indigenous populations

160

globally including Southern America (http://www.allelefrequencies.net) and Australia (19, 20).

161

HLA-A*68:01 is at low levels in most of SE Asia, particularly the indigenous populations

162

reflected by low levels along the West Pacific Rim including Japan (19). If HLA-A*68:01

163

expression correlates with the manifestation of a more severe illness course, HLA-A*68:01

164

allele frequencies worldwide could positively correlate with the severity of coronavirus cases

165

and a high number of deaths seen in south American countries like Brazil (21). On the other hand,

166

low HLA-A*68:01 expression could correlate with the low number of COVID-19-attributable

167

deaths seen in Japan as compared to other industrialized countries (22).

168

4. Conclusion

169

Findings in this study demonstrate how variations in Host Human Leukocyte Antigen

170

(HLA) gene expression can influence the antigenic presentation of coronavirus epitopes. We

171

identified phosphorylation sites in close proximity to the 203/204: RG>KR mutation and

172

modeled the mutation’s potential role in the alteration of protein structure and favorable

173

electrostatic interaction between positively charged Arg and the negatively charged P-

Ser202/205. Major MHC-I molecules play a key role in the recognition of intracellular pathogens.

175

Low HLA-A*68:01 expression could correlate with the low number of COVID-19-attributable

176

deaths seen in Japan as compared to other industrialized countries. Importantly, we found that

177

RG>KR mutated SARS-CoV-2 expands the ability for differential expression of the N protein

178

epitope on Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) of varying Human Leukocyte Antigen

179

(HLA) origin.

180

5. Methods

181

5.1. Data retrieval and sequence alignment

182

We used BLASTP programs from the NCBI database search (23) to find the LKR N-

183

protein sequence (43 nucleotides long) of all SARS-CoV-2. Conserved and varied residues were

184

identified by using the WebLogo program (24-26). Multiple alignments were performed between

185

full-length N-protein sequences on the EMBL-EBI server. Clustal Omega is used to apply mBed

186

algorithms for guide trees. ClustalW alignment tools executed to output alignment format (27).

187

We analyzed all available sequences available up to September 07th, 2020.

188

5.2. Structure modeling

189

The atomic coordinates of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD)

190

were obtained from the

structure that is available in a Protein Data Bank

191

(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) (PDB ID: 6M3M, 6WZO)(28, 29). The tertiary structure of the full

192

419 a.a. sequencing of N-proteins was predicted using the IntFOLD5 server (PYMOL).

193

Sequences from residues 1-419 for N-protein native Sequence ID: YP_009724397.2 and mutant

194

sequence ID: QIQ08827.1 were used in this study. All of the structures were visualized using

195

PYMOL Chimera software Version 1.7.4 (30). The calculation procedure was almost the same

196

as that in our previous works (31-34).

197

5.3. Model Validation

198
199

ProSA was used to measure the energy distribution of the N-protein structure (35, 36).
5.4. Identification of B‐cell epitopes

200

In this subsection, we used the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (36) to determine linear

201

B‐cell epitopes operating the incorporated Chou & Fasman Beta-Turn prediction module (37).

202

We supplied the FASTA sequence of the targeted protein as an input considering all default

203

parameters. We also used the Discotope 2.0 (38) method to predict epitopes based on N-protein

204

conformation and residue exposure.

205

5.5. Identification of T‐cell epitopes

206

We used the TepiTool, a T cell Epitope Tool that is used for MHC class I and II binding

207

predictions. The IEDB team’s recommendations were selected as defaults to automatically select

208

the top peptides (39). In the MHC-I Binding Prediction feature, the default value provided is 1.0,

209

i.e. all peptides with percentile rank ≤ 1.0 will be selected as predicted peptides. The list of

210

representative alleles from different HLA supertypes was selected by the panel of 27 allele

211

reference sets. The peptide selection criterion in this approach will always be predicted percentile

212

rank. MHC-II binding prediction Results from the default value provided is 10.0, i.e. all peptides

213

with percentile rank ≤ 10.0 will be selected as predicted peptides by using the panel of 26 most

214

frequent alleles.

215

5.6. Prediction of protein subcellular localization using deep learning

The subcellular localization of wild and mutant N proteins was predicted using DeepLoc-

216
217

1.0 software (40). Using the 419 sequence number at residues 203/204, a.a. of wild/ mutant

218

strains were used to provide information about the subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins

219

using Neural Networks algorithm trained.
