ABSTRACT
Small molecules that bind the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 Mac1 domain in place of
ADP-ribose could be useful as molecular probes or scaffolds for COVID-19 antiviral drug
discovery because Mac1 has been linked to coronavirus‚Äô ability to evade cellular detection. A
high-throughput assay based on differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was therefore optimized
and used to identify possible Mac1 ligands in small libraries of drugs and drug-like compounds.
Numerous promising compounds included nucleotides, steroids, beta-lactams, and
benzimidazoles. The main drawback to this approach was that a high percentage of compounds
in some libraries were found to influence the observed Mac1 melting temperature. To
prioritize DSF screening hits, the shapes of the observed melting curves and initial assay
fluorescence were examined, and the results were compared with virtual screens performed
using Autodock VINA. The molecular basis for alternate ligand binding was also examined by
determining a structure of one of the hits, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, with atomic
resolution.

Introduction.
Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are desperately needed to treat COVID-19 patients and
stem the devastation caused by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DAAs are typically
developed from potent inhibitors of viral enzymes or high-affinity ligands of viral proteins. For
example, remdesivir inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase, halting SARSCoV-2 replication.1 Based on past experiences, any effective DAA therapy will likely require a
cocktail of more than one antiviral agent because drug resistance evolves rapidly. Methods are
therefore needed to rapidly identify small-molecule drug-like ligands for as many SARS-CoV-2
proteins as possible. The ~29,900 nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes many potential DAA
targets including 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), four structural proteins, six accessory
proteins, and possibly many others. Most SARS-CoV-2 nsps are products of the rep1b openreading frame that encodes a short (aka ORF1a) and long (aka ORF1b) polyprotein because an
internal RNA hairpin occasionally causes translational frameshifting. The subject of this study is
the multifunctional 945 amino-acid-long nsp3 protein that cleaves the three junctures
separating nsp1, nsp2 and nsp3.2 SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 is most likely tethered to the ER with two
ubiquitin-like domains (Ubl1 and Ubl2), two papain-like protease domains (PLP1pro and PLP2pro),
three macrodomains (Mac1, Mac2, and Mac3), a nucleic-acid-binding domain, and a
hypervariable region facing the cytoplasm.
In a previous study, Frick et al.3 characterized the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 domain (aka the ‚ÄúX‚Äù
domain) and its ability to binds ADP-ribose (ADPr). Here, we report the results of pilot screens
designed to find drug-like Mac1 domain ligands, which might facilitate DAA design, or which
could be useful as molecular probes. A differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF, aka the thermal

shift, or ThermoFluor)4‚Äì6 assay was optimized and used to screen 726 compounds in the
National Institutes of Health clinical collection (NIHcc), the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
mechanistic set (540 compounds), and Sigma-Aldrich‚Äôs 1280 compound Library of
Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC1280). Since up to 5% of compounds in each set
influenced the apparent melting temperature, compounds were prioritized using information
derived from individual melting curves and virtual screens performed with AutoDock VINA.7 A
high-resolution structure of one hit compound, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was
determined in complex with SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, revealing at atomic resolution the capacity of
the binding cleft to accommodate other ligands.
Materials and Methods
Purified SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein was prepared as described previously. 3 DSF Assays
were performed in 96-well PCR plates using an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep Realplex
Quantitative Realtime PCR System with each well containing 19 ¬µl of Master-mix (5 ¬µM Mac1)
and 1 ¬µl of a compound stock (10 mM for screening) or DMSO. The master-mix was prepared
by adding 20 ¬µl of 500 ¬µM Mac1, 2.5 ¬µl 5000x SPYRO Orange protein gel stain (Sigma-Aldrich
catalog #S5692) to 1977.5 ¬µl of buffer (20 mM MOPS, 25 mM NaCl, pH 7). The 96-well PCR plate
was then sealed by a clear adhesive film and centrifuged at 1,100 RPM for 5 mins. The
temperature was raised from 20 ¬∞C to 95 ¬∞C at a rate of 2 ¬∞C per min while measuring the
fluorescence in the ‚ÄúTAMRA‚Äù channel. Each plate included both negative (DMSO) and positive
(ADPr) controls. Tm‚Äôs were calculated by fitting the data to equation 1 using either GraphPad
Prism or TSA-CRAFT (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tsa-craft/).8

In Eq. 1, Fobs (T) is the observed fluorescence at each temperature (T), Fmin is the
minimum observed fluorescence, Fmax is maximum observed fluorescence, and a is a Hill slope.
Two methods were used estimate the affinity of Mac1 from DSF. First, the observed melting
temperatures were plotted versus ligand and fit to Eq. 2 to determine the amount of compound
needed to cause a change the melting temperature of 50% (EC50) using equation 2, and a nonlinear regression to estimate DTm max (the maximum change in Tm) from the melting
temperature of Mac1 in the absence of ligand (Tm 0)

Computational ligand screening was performed using both the unligated (6WEY and
6VXS) and ADPr-bound forms (6W02), using the program AutoDock VINA.7 The protein files
were downloaded directly from the protein data bank and processed as described below before
submitting for screening. All solvent molecules (HETATM) were removed from the files. Polar
hydrogen atoms were added and Kollman charges were included in the protein files. The

converted protein and ligand file pdbqt libraries were uploaded to a parallel computing cluster
and run with the following parameters: Energy difference = 4; Number of recorded modes = 20;
Exhaustiveness was set to 12. Docking box location was configured prior to using AutoDock
tools. After the docking calculation was complete, the locations, orientations, and binding
affinities of the top candidates were examined using UCSF Chimera and tabulated for
comparison.
Mac1 was prepared for crystallization as described before3 with the following
modifications. First, the plasmid was modified to express one additional N-terminal residue
(E206) and C-terminus was shortened by three residues such that it encoded residues 206-374
of the SARS-Cov-12 nsp3. After purification and TEV protease cleavage the tag-free protein was
concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP.
Crystallization was accomplished as described for the Mac1¬∑AMP complex10 (1 ¬µl of
concentrated Mac1 was mixed with 1 ¬µl 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5). Plate-shaped
crystals grew in 3-7 days at 22 ¬∞C.
The Mac1¬∑cAMP complex was prepared by soaking the crystal in a solution containing
35% PEG 4000 and 20 mM cAMP for 30 min. Cryo-protection was accomplished by briefly
soaking the crystal in 35% PEG 4000, 20 mM cAMP, and 20% glycerol before plunging it into
liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LSCAT) beamline 21-ID-F at the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory, which is
fitted with a fixed-wavelength beam at 0.97872 √Ö and a MarMosaic M300 detector. The data
were collected with an oscillation width of 0.5¬∞ per image for a total oscillation of 180¬∞. The
data were processed using HKL2000;11 data collection statistics are provided in Table S1.

The structure was determined by molecular replacement in PHASER12 using PDB ID
6WEY,3 with solvent molecules and B-factor information removed, as the search model. The
model underwent iterative rounds of (re)building in COOT13 and refinement in PHENIX.refine.14,

Translation-libration-screw (TLS) refinement provided a more realistic treatment of the

atomic displacement parameters; TLS groups were identified by phenix.find_tls_groups. Model
refinement and validation statistics are provided in Table S1. The coordinates were deposited in
the PDB (accession code 7JME).
Results
An optimized DSF assay for SARS-CoV-2 Mac1‚Äî DSF has been used previously to study
ligand binding to viral macrodomains.16, 17 In DSF experiments using SARS-CoV-2 Mac1, the
presence of ADPr raised the Mac1 melting temperature in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 1A). To estimate the ligand concentrations needed to alter melting temperatures by 50%
(EC50), melting temperatures were fit to Eq. 2 (Fig. 1B). Such EC50 values do not, however,
describe protein-ligand affinity because DSF assays do not directly measure binding. The
isothermal analysis recently described by Bai et al.9 was therefore used to estimate binding
affinities. Fits of the fraction of protein unfolded at various temperatures in the presence of
various ligand concentrations (Fig. 1C) were used to estimate a dissociation constant (Kd) and
equilibrium unfolding constant (Ku). Each depended on temperature (Fig. 1D), and when fit to
the Van‚Äôt Hoff relationship, were in good agreement with the dissociation constant describing
the interaction of ADPr and Mac1 (10 ¬µM) determined at 23 ¬∞C.3
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) did not change the melting curve even at concentrations as
high as 10% (v/v) and similar results were also obtained when titrations with ADPr were

repeated in various buffers, with the pH ranging from 6.5 to 8.0, or in the presence of various
concentrations of divalent metal cations (Mg2+ or Mn2+). In contrast, the ionic strengths of the
assay buffers influenced the results, with the largest DTm values and lowest EC50 values being
obtained at the lowest ionic strengths (Fig. 1E). Based on these results, DSF assays were
subsequently performed in 20 mM MOPS pH 7 buffer containing 25 mM NaCl to reduce
possible non-specific interactions with ligands. Z‚Äô factors18 were always above 0.5 for each
plate and typically above 0.7. Plate-to-plate variability was negligible (Fig. 1F). The first screen
was performed using compounds from an NCI library (NCI,
https://dtp.cancer.gov/repositories/)(Fig. 2A),19 the second was performed using the NIHcc
(https://commonfund.nih.gov/molecularlibraries/tools ) (Fig. 2B),20 and the third using SigmaAldrich‚Äôs LOPAC1280 (Fig. 2C, D). Although ligands that reduce a protein‚Äôs Tm are often assumed
to bind and stabilize unfolded structures,21 we nevertheless also examined some of these hits in
more detail. In addition to nucleotides suspected to bind in place of ADPr, other noteworthy
hits relevant to current COVID-19 research included the ACE inhibitor telmisartan, several
steroids, and Œ≤-lactam antibiotics (Fig. 2E).
Prioritizing hits in DSF screens‚Äî Screening results reveal that the major limitation of this
approach is that a high percentage of compounds in some libraries influence the observed
protein melting temperature, which was particularly evident with the NIHcc. Many of these
compounds either quench fluorescence, fluoresce themselves, or interact with the reporter
dye. To exclude such compounds in follow-up experiments, the TSA-CRAFT software package
was used to identify what it defines as ‚Äútypical‚Äù curves (filled-circles, Figs. 2, 3). We found that

such interfering compounds could also be identified by simply plotting Tm values versus the
initial fluorescence seen in the melting curve (Fig. 3A).
As another method for hit prioritization, ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù screens were performed with SARSCoV-2 Mac1 crystal structures (PDB files 6WEY, 6W02, and 6VXS) as targets in the program
AutoDock Vina (Fig. 3A). Each was searched free from ligands. Binding sites were not restricted
but, for most compounds, minimum binding energy (best fit) values were obtained for
structures in which the compound docked near the ADPr binding site. Plots of AutoDock Vina
scores vs. Tm could be used to identify compounds for follow-up assays (Fig. 3B). First, there
was a clear correlation between the number of hits and AutoDock Vina scores, with more hits
clustering at lower energies. Second, when cherry-pick assays were performed on hits, those
with lower energy scores (12/15) were more likely to be reproducible than compounds with
higher-energy scores (3/9) (Fig. 3B). Close examination of molecular models generated by
AutoDock Vina reveal that the steroids (Fig. 3C), Œ≤-lactams (Fig. 3D) and benzimidazoles (Fig. 3E)
could each occupy the ADPr-binding cleft on SARS-CoV-2 Mac1. The larger compounds in each
class make more contacts with amino acids in the cleft, explaining their higher binding energies.
By combining these prioritization methods, compounds that more likely bind Mac1
could be differentiated from those that likely do not. For example, all nucleotides that were hits
yielded results similar to those seen with ADPr. However, the steroids either yielded atypical
curves (b-estradiol) or increased the DSF assay fluorescence (estradiol valerate and flunisolide).
When new aliquots of selected compounds were purchased, abnormal melting curves were
observed with estradiol valerate and no effects were observed with flunisolide (Fig. 3C). In
contrast, fresh batches of both lactams and two benzimidazoles yielded the same effects seen

with the screening library (Fig. 3D, E). Interestingly, fresh telmisartan yielded a different effect,
lowering the apparent Tm as was seen with related compounds (Fig. 3D), suggesting that a
possible degradation product led to the Tm increase observed using the library sample.
Structure of cAMP bound to SARS-CoV-2 Mac1‚Äî The protein construct used to
determine the structure of the apoenzyme (PDB ID 6WEY; nsp3 residues 207-377) crystallized
with such tight packing that it proved impossible to obtain structures of the ligand-bound Mac1
protein. Thus, we were in the unusual position of try to get looser packing and poorer
resolution. Adding a single N-terminal residue to the protein (nsp3 residues 206-374) was
enough to change the packing from orthorhombic (P212121) to monoclinic (P21). To verify
binding, each of the compounds in Fig. 2 was both co-crystallized with this new Mac1 construct
and soaked into crystals of the apoprotein. Despite considerable effort, we were only able to
obtain a complex structure with cAMP. This model contains one molecule of Mac1 in the
asymmetric unit, comprising 166 amino acids (residues 208-373), 135 water molecules, and one
molecule of cAMP. The cAMP binds in the cleft between the Œ≤2-Œ±2 loop (residues K248-V253)
and the Œ≤5-Œ±5 loop (residues L331-D339); the bottom of this cleft is formed by strand Œ≤2 (Fig.
4A-C). The electron density is well defined for all but the solvent-exposed edge of the adenine
base, which appears to be wobbling at the brink of the binding site. The interactions with Mac1
are comprised entirely of hydrogen bonding interactions to the main chain, particularly in the
Œ≤5-Œ±5 loop (Fig. 4D). The adenine base is held only by water-mediated interactions to the Œ≤2-Œ±2
and Œ≤5-Œ±5 loops (e.g. the amide nitrogen atoms of V253 and I335) and a stacking interaction
with the G251-G252 peptide bond. There are also two water-mediated contacts with a
symmetry-related Mac1 molecule (Fig. 4D). Since cAMP makes no close contacts to this

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.06.190413; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

symmetry mate, we do not believe that the proximity of the neighboring Mac1 molecule
significantly influences the binding pose of the ligand. The 2‚Äô hydroxyl group of cAMP make
hydrogen bonding interactions with the carbonyl group of A242 on strand Œ≤2 and the amide
group of A254 on helix Œ±2 (Fig. 4D). On the other side of the ribose ring, O4‚Äô interacts with the
side chain of N244 through the intercession of the water molecule. The 3‚Äô and 5‚Äô oxygen atoms
of the ribose moiety interact, through water, with the amide of I335 and the carbonyl of A243,
respectively. Given the density of interactions with the Mac1 protein, the two phosphate
oxygen atoms are likely the main drivers of cAMP binding. The Œ≤5-Œ±5 loop forms a string of
amide groups that lock the phosphate of cAMP in place with hydrogen bonding interactions to
these two oxygen atoms.
The binding mode of cAMP was compared to those of ADPr (PDB ID 6W02 10; Figure 4C)
and AMP (PDB ID 6W6Y 10; not shown). Chain A of 6W02 was superimposed onto the
Mac1¬∑cAMP model using the SSM algorithm22 as implemented in COOT. The two models fit with
a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.41 √Ö for all 166 CŒ± atoms in the Mac1¬∑cAMP model.
Overlaying the AMP complex structure gave an RMSD of 0.40 √Ö for all CŒ± atoms. These low
RMSD values indicate that the structures are identical in gross terms, with only small
differences in the orientations of small portions such as surface loops, as one would expect
when comparing multiple structures of the same protein. What is interesting is that whereas
the common portions of ADPr and AMP overlay almost perfectly, cAMP binds such that the
cyclic phosphate matches with the Œ≤-phosphate of ADPr, the ribose moiety corresponds to the
terminal ribose of ADPr, and the adenine base is directed toward solvent. Consequently, there
is no overlap at all of cAMP and AMP. This was entirely unexpected, since the adenine bases in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.06.190413; this version posted September 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the ADPr- and AMP-bound Mac1 domain structures are very solidly bound, with strong electron
density and low B-factors. The only possible explanation for this is that the geometry of the
cyclic phosphate moiety, particularly its relationship to the ribose ring, does not comport well
with the Œ±-phosphate-binding site of Mac1, and is instead a better fit for the Œ≤phosphate/terminal ribose-binding site. This alternative binding pose results in slight
reorientations of the Œ≤2-Œ±2 and Œ≤5-Œ±5 loops (Fig. 4C), which move away from each other to
accommodate the adenine base of cAMP. It is also intriguing that, if the cAMP in this model
were joined to the AMP in 6W6Y by a phosphodiester bond (and the P-O3‚Äô bond in cAMP were
broken), the result would be reminiscent of diadenosine 5',5'-diphosphate, or related
compounds like NAD(H).
Discussion
The idea that SARS-CoV Mac1 functions as an enzyme in the cell to remove ADPr from
antiviral proteins suggests that Mac1 might be an important new drug target for COVID-19.23 A
thermal-shift binding assay was therefore developed to facilitate those efforts. The main
drawback with the DSF assay was the high percentage of hits for some libraries. Various
methods to successfully prioritize hits are described above, with the simplest being an
examination of the initial fluorescence values in DSF assays (Fig. 3A). DSF‚Äôs other main
disadvantage is that it requires relatively large amounts of protein, but this is a minor concern
because of the ease with which Mac1 can be produced from E. coli.3 The most attractive
alternative to a DSF binding assay would be an enzyme assay that monitors the ability of Mac1
to hydrolyze ADPr-based substrates, which are presently under development.24

The most intriguing hits in DSF screens were the steroids and telmisartan (Fig. 3).
Unfortunately, closer examination revealed that the steroid effects in DSF appeared to be
artifacts. Caution should also be exercised because telmisartan and similar compounds lowered
the apparent Tm of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1. This could mean they bind to the protein‚Äôs unfolded
state, but it is worth noting that similar destabilizing compounds were found to inhibit
macrodomains in assays not based on thermal shifts,24 suggesting that the destabilizing
compounds might bind a folded protein that assumes a different conformation.
The idea that SARS-CoV-2 ADP-ribose-binding cleft can accommodate other ligands is
supported by the X-ray structure of Mac1-bound cAMP. Surprisingly the adenine base of cAMP
does not bind in the adenine-binding cleft identified in the structures of Mac1 bound to ADPr or
AMP.10 Instead, cAMP binds in the site occupied by the Œ≤-phosphate/terminal ribose unit of
ADPr. This result underscores the importance of computational modelling and experimental
structure determination in assessing the hits from high-throughput screening campaigns. Based
on this crystal structure, it is likely that scaffolds containing a central phosphate (or
diphosphate) or sulfate group could be expected to bind to this same ADPr-binding cleft. The
interaction between Mac1 and cAMP, which binds Mac1 with a similar affinity as ADPr,3 points
to other possible biological roles for Mac1, and hints that cyclic mono- or dinucleotide second
messengers might allosterically modulate other nsp3 activities.
The next step in this project will be to examine the effect of promising antiviral
compounds on cells harboring SAR-CoV-2 or surrogate reporter viruses. Some of the
compounds above might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication based on the fact that Shimizu et al.
showed that small molecules found in virtual screens targeting the homologous nsp3

macrodomain from Chikungunya virus inhibit replication of Chikungunya replicons.25 However,
further chemical optimization would most likely be necessary for these probes to be useful in
cellular studies. Fortunately, many hits reported here are already FDA approved drugs with
hundreds of analogs available to facilitate such work. Alternatively, this optimized DSF assay
could be used to screen larger more diverse libraries for more attractive probe candidates.

Figure 4. The Mac1 protein binds cAMP in an unexpected way. (A) Ribbon diagram showing of
the SARS-CoV-2 MaC1 domain with cAMP bound (gold sticks). (B) Overlay of the structures of
the Mac1 domain with cAMP (gold sticks) or ADPr (grey sticks) bound. The Œ≤2-Œ±2 and Œ≤5-Œ±5
loops are noted for reference. Note the difference in conformation of the Œ≤2-Œ±2 loop (the
section carrying G251). The reorientation of this loop allows it to pack against the adenine base
of cAMP. (C) The cAMP-binding site. The Mac1 domain protein is shown as a blue CŒ± trace with
important residues shown as thin blue sticks. Water molecules are shown as transparent blue
spheres. The stretch of amino acids shown in grey sticks represents the symmetry-related Mac1
molecule that makes contacts with cAMP. The simulated annealing composite omit map is
shown as a magenta mesh contoured at 1.0œÉ, the 2Fo-Fc map is shown in black, also at 1.0œÉ,
and the Fo-Fc map is shown as green and red mesh at +3.0œÉ and -3.0œÉ, respectively. (D)
Schematic representation of the Mac1¬∑cAMP complex showing polar interactions between the
enzyme and ligand. The cAMP ligand is shown with orange bonds. The heavy blue lines and
residues drawn with black bonds represent the Mac1 protein. The heavy grey line represents
the symmetry-related molecule that makes solvent-mediated contacts with cAMP. Solvent
molecules are shown as blue circles with a ‚ÄúW‚Äù. Potential hydrogen-bonding interactions are
shown as dashed green lines with the associated distances in grey italics. The stacking
interaction described in the text between the G251-G252 peptide bond is shown as a green line
with light green circles at each end.
