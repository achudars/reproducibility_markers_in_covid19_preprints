ABSTRACT

2

The potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shed in stool via fecal microbiota transplantation

3

is not yet known, and the effectiveness of various testing strategies to prevent FMT-based

4

transmission has also not yet been quantified. Here we use a mathematical model to simulate

5

the utility of different testing strategies.

INTRODUCTION

8

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the instillation of stool from a healthy donor into a

9

patient’s gut, is a recommended therapy for the most common hospital-acquired infection in the

10

United States, Clostridioides difficile, and is being explored as an experimental therapy for

11

dozens of other conditions.1,2 As with all human-derived therapies, the safety of FMT depends

12

on screening donors to prevent transmission of pathogens via the procedure,3 and screening

13

guidelines must be continually updated to account for emerging pathogens.

14
15

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is primarily considered a respiratory pathogen,

16

but evidence suggests that the virus is able to independently replicate in the gut, raising the

17

possibility of transmission via the fecal oral-route or via FMT.4 Practitioners4,11 and regulators12

18

have therefore called for screening of FMT donors for SARS-CoV-2. However, because of the

19

virus’s long incubation period, the high proportion of infected individuals that are asymptomatic,6

20

and the long period in which apparently-recovered individuals can continue to shed virus in their

21

stool,7–10 screening FMT donors using COVID-19 clinical assessment alone is insufficient.

22
23

Despite the consensus that FMT donors should be screened for SARS-CoV-2, the optimal

24

available strategy for detecting asymptomatic carriage among FMT donors is unclear. The

25

theoretical effectiveness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests using nasopharyngeal

26

swabs, stool-based PCR tests, donor serology tests, or a combination of those tests has not

27

been assessed or compared. We therefore developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2

28

infection among FMT donors that simulates the effect of different testing strategies. The model

29

quantifies the effect of more stringent testing on the desirable reduction in potentially infectious,

30

virus-positive donations processed into FMT material and released for use as well as the

31

undesirable reduction in virus-negative donations released.

32
33

METHODS

34

We built an abstract model of FMT donors, simulating their donation schedule, SARS-CoV-2

35

infection incidence, and COVID-19 disease course. On top of these simulations, we layered

36

various screening strategies, accounting for the imperfect specificity and sensitivity of each test,

37

to estimate how many virus-negative donations would be appropriately released for use and

38

how many virus-positive donations would be undesirably released. Parameters for the model

39

are shown in Table 1.

40
41

Each simulation treats a single donor and runs in discrete time steps of 1 day. The simulation

42

begins when the donor enrolls as a stool donor and ends either when the donor is removed

43

because of a positive virus test or after a fixed time. Donors donate stool at set intervals.

44
45

We simulate the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the general picture of

46

Sethuraman et al.13 For simplicity, and to reflect the rigor of the initial screening for new donors,

47

donors are assumed to have tested negative on all screens be unexposed U when they enroll

48

on the first day of the simulation. Each day, the donor has a probability of becoming infected I1;

49

this is the incidence of infection. We ignore any latent period, as it is not relevant to the model. A

50

proportion of infected donors develop symptoms. If a donor becomes symptomatic, their

51

donations from the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms are rejected, and the donor is removed.

52

We assume that an asymptomatic donor in phase I1 has detectable virus in their nasopharynx

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.169094; this version posted June 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

53

but is not shedding detectable loads virus in stool and has not developed detectable IgG

54

antibodies (Supplemental Table 1). After a period of time, the donor enters a second phase of

55

infection I2. A proportion of I2 donors are “stool shedders”. Shedders have detectable virus in

56

their stool, and donations produced by shedders are virus-positive. After this second phase of

57

infection, donors enter a first recovery phase R1. In this phase, donors no longer have

58

detectable nasopharyngeal virus, but they do have detectable antibodies. Shedders continue to

59

produce virus in stool. Finally, donors enter a second recovery phase R2. Donors in this phase

60

do not have detectable virus in their stool, but they remain detectable by serology. We did not

61

consider the role of immunity because the chance of multiple asymptomatic, undetected

62

infections during the simulation period is low.

63
64

Simulated donors are screened for the virus according to a screening strategy that consists of a

65

set of individual test types: a nasopharyngeal swab test performed at 14-day intervals; a blood

66

IgG antibody test at 60-day intervals; and a stool test performed at 14-day intervals, at 28-day

67

intervals, or at every donation. If a donor tests positive on any test implemented in a strategy,

68

they are removed and do not continue to donate. Donations are released only if they are

69

“bookended” by two negative screens. In other words, any donations made after the last

70

negative test conducted before the first positive test are destroyed.

71
72

The model has two outcomes: the number of “true negative”, virus-negative donations released

73

and the number of “false negative”, virus-positive donations released. A desirable screening

74

strategy will release many virus-negative donations and few or no virus-positive donations, while

75

a poor strategy will needlessly destroy many virus-negative donations or release many virus-

76

positive donations.

78

To evaluate the effectiveness of different testing strategies, 10,000 simulations were run for

79

each of 3 incidences (1 infection per 1,000 people per day; 1 per 10,000; 1 per 100,000) and

80

each of 9 screening strategies (stool testing only at 28-day intervals or 14-day intervals, or

81

testing every stool; nasopharyngeal swabs only; nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at each of the

82

3 stool-testing intervals; nasopharyngeal swabs and serology; nasopharyngeal swabs, serology,

83

and every stool). A sensitivity analysis was run to evaluate the dependence of the model

84

outcomes on input parameters. In 10,000 simulations, parameters were varied over the

85

hypercube bounded by the upper and lower parameter estimates in Table 1. Sensitivity was

86

assessed by the Spearman’s ρ correlation between each input parameter and each of the 2

87

outcomes. Statistical significance was assessed using the false discovery rate, treating the

88

simulations in each strategy separately.

89
90

Simulations and analyses were run using R (version 3.6.0).14 Code to reproduce the results is

91

available online (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3903840).

92
93

RESULTS

94

The number of virus-positive and -negative donations released varied over simulations and

95

depended on testing strategy and incidence of infection (Figure 1, Supplemental Table 2). In

96

general, the more sensitive strategies released fewer virus-positive donations but also removed

97

donors early due to false positives and therefore released fewer virus-negative donations per

98

donor. In other words, the most sensitive strategies were also the least specific.

99
100

At the baseline incidence of 1 infection per 10,000 people per day, the least stringent strategy

101

(testing stool at 28-day intervals) released approximately 1 virus positive-donation per 3,000

102

donations, while the most stringent strategy (nasopharyngeal swabs, serology tests, and testing

103

every stool) released approximately 1 per 400,000 (Supplemental Table 2). In other words, the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.169094; this version posted June 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

104

most stringent strategy released 100-fold less virus-positive material than the least stringent

105

strategy.

106
107

Even at the lower incidence of 1 infection per 100,000 people per day, the least stringent

108

strategy (testing stool at 28-day intervals) released approximately 1 virus-positive donation per

109

30,000 donations. By contrast, the most stringent strategy (nasopharyngeal swabs, serology

110

tests, and testing every stool) released 1 virus-positive donation per 40,000 donations only at

111

the higher incidence of 1 infection per 1,000 people per day. In other words, the difference in

112

risk of released virus-positive material between the most and least stringent strategies was

113

comparable to the effect of a 100-fold change in daily SARS-CoV-2 incidence.

114
115

In a sensitivity analysis (Supplemental Figure 1), the parameters most strongly associated with

116

the two outcomes (Spearman’s ρ > 10%, false discovery rate < 0.05) were donation interval

117

(longer interval correlated with fewer virus-negative donations released), the specificities of the

118

3 tests (more specific tests correlated with more virus-negative donations released), and SARS-

119

CoV-2 incidence (higher incidence correlated with more virus-positive donations released).

120
121

DISCUSSION

122

A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection among stool donors suggests that, if incidence

123

among stool donors is comparable to the aggregate national average, if a stringent strategy is

124

used, and if our estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the tests are accurate, then the

125

probability of releasing a virus-positive donation for clinical use is low. The most stringent test

126

strategies involved testing every stool, while the least sensitive strategies were to use

127

nasopharyngeal swab alone or to test stool at 28-day intervals. More stringent tests were more

128

sensitive but also less specific, and the most appropriate strategy must be determined by a

129

balance between the necessary stringency and logistical considerations like resourcing.

130
131

The strength of this analysis is its quantitative treatment of a pressing clinical question.

132

However, it has multiple limitations. First, as a modeling study, the accuracy of the results

133

depend on the accuracy of the input parameters and the appropriateness of the model structure,

134

especially the tests’ sensitivity and specificity as well as the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

135

values which remain subject to refinement. Thus, the quantitative predictions made by the

136

model should be used as guides to clinical reasoning rather than as precision forecasts.

137

Second, the model makes a number of assumptions about the course of disease that may be

138

shown to be invalid or that are no longer applicable. For example, our assumption that newly

139

enrolled donors are seronegative maximizes the sensitivity of serology testing. As the number of

140

candidate donors with positive serology rises, the sensitivity and utility of the serology test will

141

decline. Finally, verifying the model would be challenging, as the possibility of fecal-oral

142

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been confirmed, and there is no accepted “gold standard”

143

for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in stool.

144
145

Although these results are encouraging, we again caution that they depend on a number of

146

assumptions about testing quality and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology that will be refined in the

147

coming months. Nevertheless, this method is valuable in assessing the risks of transmission in

148

this evolving pandemic, and we hope this approach can serve as a model for evaluating testing

149

strategies for other pathogens or human-derived therapies beyond FMT.
