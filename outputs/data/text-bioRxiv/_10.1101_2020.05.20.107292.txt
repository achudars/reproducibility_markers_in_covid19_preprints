Abstract
While individuals infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifested a broad
range in susceptibility and severity to the disease, the pre-existing immune memory of related
pathogens can influence the disease outcome. Here, we investigated the potential extent of T
cell cross-reactivity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
that can be conferred by other coronaviruses and influenza virus, and generated a map of
public and private predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes between coronaviruses. Moreover, to
assess the potential risk of self-reactivity and/or diminished T cell response for peptides
identical or highly similar to the host, we identified predicted epitopes with high sequence
similarity with human proteome. Lastly, we compared predicted epitopes from coronaviruses
with epitopes from influenza virus deposited in IEDB to support vaccine development against
different virus strains. We believe the comprehensive in silico profile of private and public
predicted epitopes across coronaviruses and influenza viruses will facilitate design of
vaccines capable of protecting against various viral infections.

Introduction
Faced by unprecedent health and economic crisis from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), the scientific community is pushing forward with efforts to develop vaccines and
treatments to mitigate its impact. While the severity of symptoms have been reported to be
associated with age, gender and comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases and chronic
respiratory diseases1, the underlying mechanism of broad variation in susceptibility and
severity to COVID-19 is not fully understood2. It is however accepted that an altered immune
response is a key contributor to pathology3,4, and the balance between generation of protective
and pathological immune responses by the host may be a vital factor governing the disease
outcome.
As immune memory by related pathogens has shown to help reduce severity and spread of the
diseases 5–7, pre-existing immunity through cross-reactivity to familial coronavirus strains may
provide individuals with protection or enhanced susceptibility against the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without prior exposure8–10. Therefore, we
aim to characterize the potential for the existing immune memory by other coronaviruses and
influenza virus to fight against SARS-CoV-2 and further identify targets for developing a
‘universal’ vaccine against coronaviruses.
The strains infecting humans belong to either alpha and beta genera of coronavirus. The
alphacoronavirus contains human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and HCoV-NL63, while
the betacoronavirus contains HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, middle east respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-211. It is known that NL63,
229E, OC43, and HKU1 usually cause only mild to moderate symptoms such as cough, runny
nose, fever and sore throat like the common cold12, whereas MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV cause
more severe symptoms including respiratory tract disease.
In this study, we investigated the level of T cell antigen cross-reactivity across the seven alpha
and betacoronavirus strains, evaluated the risk of self-reactivity from SARS-CoV-2 predicted
epitopes and identified targets for vaccine developments against coronavirus and influenza
virus. We first predicted the potential of peptides to be presented by ten prevalent HLA alleles
and eliciting CD8+ T cell responses, and generated a comprehensive in silico profile of public
and private predicted epitopes. We also expanded the map of cross-reactivity from exact
matching peptides to those with a high sequence similarity, resulting in addition of 264 and
283 public SARS-CoV-2 predicted epitopes by allowing one and two amino acid mismatches,
respectively. Moreover, to assess the risk of self-reactivity and immunopathology, we
compared SARS-CoV-2 predicted epitopes with human proteome sequences and detected ten
predicted epitopes that are single amino acid variant from their counterparts in the human
proteome. Lastly, to identify peptides to support development of vaccines against coronavirus
and influenza virus, we compared our list of predicted epitopes from coronaviruses with
epitopes from influenza virus deposited in IEDB and detected epitopes with a modest sequence
similarity that are shared across multiple coronavirus strains.

Results
Shared predicted epitopes among coronavirus strains
To first evaluate the homology of proteome sequences among alpha and betacoronavirus
strains, we conducted sequence alignment and generated a phylogenetic tree of encoded
proteins between NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (see
Methods). Based on sequence alignments (example alignment of spike protein illustrated in
Supplementary Figure 1) and phylogenetic trees of encoded proteins, the alpha and
betacoronavirus strains shared a high sequence similarity within their own genera, i.e. higher
similarity between NL63 and 229E than with betacoronaviruses. In particular, for
betacoronavirus strains, phylogenetic analysis showed higher similarity between OC43 and
HKU1, and between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Notably, MERS-CoV showed relatively
distinct proteome sequences to all other coronavirus strains included in this study (Figure 1A
for spike protein and Supplementary Figure 2 for other encoded proteins).
To identify the conserved 9-mer peptides across coronavirus strains, we first generated 9-mer
peptides from encoded proteins of coronavirus strains (Figure 1B) and detected public peptides
with identical matches (Figure 1C). Notably, there were 3663 shared 9-mer peptides between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Given the longest open reading frame of replicase polyproteins
(Orf1ab) with an average of 7002 amino acids across coronavirus strains, many public peptides
were derived from Orf1ab, with 19 peptides shared across all studied strains (Figure 3 first
panel).
We then investigated antigen presentation potential of 9-mer peptides for 10 most prevalent
HLA alleles corresponding to MHC class I (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles). These
include HLA-A*0101, 0201, 0301, 2402, HLA-B*0702, 4001, 0801 and HLA-C*0702, 0401,
0701. The MHC presentation was predicted by netMHCpan v4.013 (see Methods). Generally,
there was a relatively high number of peptides predicted to bind HLA-C alleles while HLA-B
alleles had the lowest number of predicted binders (Figure 2A). We identified on average 1380
(SD = 45) peptides predicted to bind at least one HLA allele (Figure 2B), which is ~15% of
total number of 9-mer peptides across different strains. Of interest, there were few peptides
predicted to bind by at least 7 different HLA alleles, of which 9 peptides were derived from
SARS-CoV-2. The peptides predicted to bind 8 HLA alleles and their derived proteins are
listed in Supplementary Figure 3.
Although viral antigen presentation is a vital step in triggering immune responses, not all MHC
binding peptides are immunogenic. We therefore set out to predict T cell immunogenicity, i.e.
the ability of a peptide to elicit a T cell response, of all peptides predicted to bind at least one
HLA allele. In an ongoing unpublished study, we have benchmarked the existing
immunogenicity predicting models and as a result recognized a recently published model called
Repitope14 as the best performing existing model to predict immunogenicity of viral epitopes.
We therefore utilized Repitope (see Methods) and identified in total 4894 out of 16096 (~30%)
unique predicted binders to be immunogenic (subsequently referred to as predicted epitopes),
and the proportion of such predicted epitopes was comparable across different strains (Figure
2C, Supplementary Figure 4). On average, we detected 429 (SD=26) epitopes predicted to bind
at least one HLA type and trigger T cell response. The full list of predicted immunogenic and
nonimmunogenic HLA-binders are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

With the pool of predicted epitopes, we generated Venn diagrams to illustrate private and
public epitopes across different coronavirus strains (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 5). From
a total of 794 predicted epitopes from SARS-CoV-2, 411 were private while the remaining
were public of which 350 were shared between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We detected
only one predicted epitope SLAIDAYPL public across all strains. Given the long sequence of
Orf1ab protein, many public epitopes were derived from Orf1ab.
For a validation of predicted epitopes, we have compared the list of predicted epitopes with
epitopes characterized by in vitro T cell assays and deposited in Immune Epitope Database and
Analysis Resource (IEDB). We retrieved all 35,224 peptides in IEDB (as of 13-02-2020),
presented on either MHC-I or MHC-II, reported positive in T cell assays and have human as
the host organism, then compared with the list of 4894 unique predicted epitopes. We identified
66 unique 9-mer predicted epitopes matching with IEDB epitopes from four coronavirus
strains, 229E, NL63, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1. Supplementary Table 2). In
particular, the matching epitopes from NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 were public peptides with 229E
and SARS-CoV respectively. Consequently, all 229E and NL63 matching epitopes in IEDB
were derived from 229E whereas all SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 matching epitopes in IEDB
were derived from SARS-CoV.

Public epitopes between SARS-coV-2 and other coronavirus strains by high sequence
similarity
In addition to public peptides by exact matches, predicted epitopes with a high sequence
similarity may also trigger cross-reactivity across coronavirus strains. Here, we expanded the
previous set of public predicted epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 to include those with up to two amino
acid mismatches (Table 2, Supplementary Table 3). In addition to 629 predicted epitopes from
SARS-CoV-2 shared with other coronavirus strains, there can be an increase of 264 and 283
public epitopes by allowing one or two amino acid mismatches respectively.

Autoimmune potential of SARS-CoV-2 derived predicted epitopes
In identifying targets for vaccination, peptides identical or highly similar to those of host
organism may diminish the T cell response due to exclusion of high-affinity T cells by thymic
negative selection and/or may induce autoimmune response. Thus, we analyzed the sequence
similarity of predicted epitopes with their best matching counterparts in human proteome to
hint on their potential risks.
By comparing predicted epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 with the human proteome, none of the
predicted epitopes had identical match but we detected 10 and 184 epitopes with one and two
amino acid mismatches respectively with their human proteome counterparts (Figure 4A). The
predicted epitopes differ by only one amino acid is listed in Table 3.

Cross-reactivity between coronavirus and influenza virus
Due to the prevalence of disease caused by influenza virus and its tendency to gain mutations
(antigenic drift) and reassortment among subtypes of virus (antigenic shift), there have been
multiple attempts to develop generic vaccines protective against all influenza viruses to reduce
the severity of infection and spread of disease15. Along with cross-reactivity among influenza
virus strains, the cross-reactivity between coronavirus and influenza virus would benefit the
community to combat recurrence of diseases caused by both strains. Here, we compared the
4894 unique predicted epitopes from all coronavirus strains with 1334 unique MHC-I influenza
virus-derived epitopes (1298 influenza A virus and 36 influenza B virus) deposited in IEDB.
Due to a relative sequence dissimilarity between influenza virus and coronavirus, there were
no peptides with identical match between two strains and all peptides were distinct by at least
three amino acids (Figure 4B). But interestingly, among those with three amino acid
differences, there were predicted epitopes shared across multiple coronavirus strains as
exemplified in Table 4 (full list provided in Supplementary Figure 6). These public peptides
pose a potential to be cross-protective within coronavirus strains and given that they share a
modest sequence similarity with epitopes derived from influenza virus, also pose a potential to
cross-react against influenza virus.

similarity with influenza virus epitopes.

Discussion
The severity and recurrence of coronavirus disease outbreaks pose ongoing global threat, and
prompts the need for better understanding of potential cross-protection by prior infection of
familial coronaviruses to mitigate the current spread and prevent future pandemics. Hereby,
in continuation of our previous study to identify vaccine target for SARS-CoV-216, we sought
to determine the extent of antigen cross-reactivity amongst coronavirus strains.
Taking a step ahead of previous efforts to study potential immune recognition of SARS-CoV2 by earlier infections of common coronaviruses based on MHC presentation predictions17–21,
we i) shortlisted predicted epitopes by taking immunogenicity potential of predicted binders
into account, ii) validated the prediction by comparing with epitopes deposited in IEDB, and
iii) expanded the map of public predicted epitopes to accommodate up to two amino acid
variants. To aid design of vaccines targeting both coronaviruses and influenza viruses, we
further analyzed correlates of the predicted epitopes from coronaviruses with epitopes from
influenza virus.
Along with the in silico profile of predicted epitopes shared across coronaviruses, we evaluated
the potential risk of self-reactivity imposed by high sequence similarity with the human
proteome. Considering the reports of lung, heart, liver, intestine, genital and kidney failures by
autoimmune disorders in COVID-19 patients22, peptides from SARS-CoV-2 may carry high
risk of immunopathology and should be carefully selected to proceed for vaccination.
In regards to the accuracy of predictive models utilized in this study, the algorithms to predict
MHC presentation has matured significantly in the last decade by training with extensive
datasets, especially for the most common HLA types. On the other hand, it is worth noting
that predicting immunogenicity is challenging and not a fully solved problem. Therefore,
although the best performing models have been used for classifying immunogenicity, the
predictions are suboptimal and should be taken with caution.
We believe that our comprehensive profile of private and public predicted epitopes across
coronaviruses and influenza virus will assists biologists with targeted function validation, and
facilitate design of vaccines capable of protecting against multiple prevalent virus strains.

Methods
Retrieval of coronavirus proteome sequences
The proteome sequences of coronavirus strains were obtained from NCBI. The reference
numbers for these sequences are NC_002645.1 (229E), NC_006577.2 (HKU1),
NC_019843.3 (MERS-CoV), NC_005831.2 (NL63), NC_006213.1 (OC43), NC_004718.3
(SARS-CoV) and NC_045512.2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree of encoded proteins in coronaviruses
For multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree generation, the open reading frames
were grouped by their encoded proteins – spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane
protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), replicase polyprotein (Orf1ab) and other encoded
regions (Other) – prior to analysis. The multiple sequence alignment was conducted using
‘msa’ function from R msa v1.4.3 package and visualized by ‘msaPrettyPrint’ function. The
phylogenetic tree was produced by plotting ‘identity’ distance generated by ‘dist.alignment’
function from R seqinr v3.6.1 package.
Peptide generation from proteome sequences
Each encoded proteins were fragmented into 9-mer peptides by scanning the proteome with a
window of 9 amino acids and step length of 1 amino acid. For strains containing two open
reading frames annotated with the same functional protein e.g. 229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 having two open reading frames annotated for Orf1ab, 9-mer peptides were
generated from both encoded proteins and unique set of peptides were selected for subsequent
analysis.
MHC presentation prediction
The antigen presentation of MHC was predicted using NetMHCpan v4.013, a model trained on
binding affinity and eluted ligand data, against HLA-A*0101, 0201, 0301, 2402, HLAB*0702, 4001, 0801 and HLA-C*0702, 0401, 0701 alleles. Peptides with rank score <= 2.0
were categorized as positive HLA-binder.
Immunogenicity Prediction
The immunogenicity potential was predicted by R package Repitope for peptides that passed
netMHCpan filtering i.e those predicted to bind at least one HLA allele. The Repitope utilizes
amino acid descriptors and TCR-peptide contact potential profiling (CPP)-based features to
label immunogenicity. The Repitope package was retrieved from GitHub repository
(https://github.com/masato-ogishi/Repitope.git).
After feature computation and feature selection, we utilized the published Repitope
‘MHCI_Human’ model to extrapolate probabilistic immunogenicity scores for our dataset and
made binary classification of immunogenicity. This classification was based on a threshold
computed from the ROC curves of the MHCI_Human immunogenicity prediction model and
was calculated using the youden index that maximizes 1-sensitivity+specificity. Probabilistic
scores were extracted from the original model for a subset of peptides that were identical to
peptides in the model’s training dataset.

Visualization of private and public peptides
The conservation of peptides across coronavirus strains before and after MHC binding and
immunogenicity prediction were visualized by ‘venn’ function from R venn v1.9 package and
upset function from R UpSetR v1.4.0 package. To identify shared peptides with up to two
amino acid tolerance, the best matching peptides were identified by ‘pairwiseAlignment’
from Biostrings v2.40.2 package using BLOSUM62 matrix, gapOpening of 100 and
gapExtension of 100, followed by hamming distance to filter only peptide pairs with less than
or equal to two amino acid difference.
Sequence similarity with human proteome and epitopes deposited in IEDB
The sequence similarity of peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 with human proteome
counterparts was computed by first identifying best global-local alignment by
‘pairwiseAlignment’ function from Biostrings v2.40.2 package with a high gap penalty,
gapOpening of 100 and gapExtension of 100. The number of mismatches between best
aligned pair was computed by hamming distance using ‘stringdist’ function from R stringdist
v0.9.5.5 package. Similarly, the sequence similarity between coronavirus peptides and
epitopes from IEDB was compared by global-local alignment following by computing
hamming distance to find the best matching pairs.
