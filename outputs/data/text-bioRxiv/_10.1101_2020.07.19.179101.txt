Summary

28

A lot of software for network visualization are available, but existing software

29

have not been optimized to infection cluster visualization against the current

30

worldwide invasion of COVID-19 started since 2019. To reach the

31

spatiotemporal understanding of its epidemics, we developed Haplotype

32

Explorer. It is superior to other applications in the point of generating HTML

33

distribution files with metadata searches which interactively reflects GISAID IDs,

34

locations, and collection dates. Here, we introduce the features and products of

35

Haplotype Explorer, demonstrating the time-dependent snapshots of haplotype

36

networks inferred from total of 4,282 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Abstract

39

The worldwide eruption of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019

40

reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to understand the

41

epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have

42

attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral

43

genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available

44

applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID3

19 epidemic spatiotemporally, due to functional limitations That motivated us to

46

develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring

47

haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables people to dissect

48

epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters to provide

49

spatiotemporal perspectives on multimodal spectra of infectious diseases,

50

including introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment, for given regions

51

and time spans. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Haplotype Explorer

52

by showing an example of its visualization and features. The demo using

53

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences is available at

Introduction
To eliminate infectious diseases, it is essential to quickly identify and control

58

emerging infection clusters before they become uncontrollable. For this

59

purpose, many applications to assist researchers in understanding the latest

60

epidemiology have been developed. In fact, the recent intensification of the

61

COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, has prompted

62

development of new software to support investigations of this virus. For

63

example, Nextstrain (Hadfield et al. 2018) is one of the most popular web

64

services related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides interactive molecular

65

phylogenetic trees and geographic maps representing possible virus

66

transmission routes. COVID-19 Genome Tracker (Akther et al. 2020) is another

67

unique application which shows the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 using a haplotype

68

network. This tool can dynamically display metadata, such as isolate conditions,

69

locations, and mutations, compared to the reference genome.

70

So far, many phylogenetic trees and haplotype networks using the SARS-

71

CoV-2 genome have been inferred using Nextstrain and COVID-19 Genome

72

Tracker because they are suited to interpret genetic and epidemiological

73

relationships among sequences. Haplotype networks are especially useful for

74

this pandemic due to their potential for displaying short-term diversification of

75

closely-related genomes. Many available software programs for network

76

inferring, such as TCS (Clement et al. 2000), PopART (Leigh and Bryant 2015),

77

and Network (Bandelt et al. 1999), have supported these studies using

78

haplotype networks of SARS-CoV-2. Although these applications also work as

79

network viewers, many alternatives are also available for additional annotation

81

2009), and tcsBU (Múrias dos Santos et al. 2016).

82

Despite the excellent designs of the above-mentioned tools, none of the

83

currently available software programs simultaneously fulfill the requirements

84

essential to dissect epidemic situations: 1) nodes that can be dynamically

85

filtered with metadata by complex search queries, 2) nodes that can be

86

indicated by real-time pie charts which reflect sample size and content

87

proportions at a given point in time, and 3) interactive distributions requiring no

88

external software installation other than a modern web browser. Hence, we

89

endeavored to develop Haplotype Explorer, a specialized network viewer, to

90

assist onsite actions against emerging pathogens.

Methods

93

Implementation and workflow

94

Haplotype Explorer is a JavaScript application executable in web browser, so it

95

does not require uploading data to an external web server. This allows users to

96

analyze confidential data securely. It can produce distributions in HTML, which

97

enables users to share originated networks with others easily. The network

98

structure is written in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, and can be

99

generated semi-automatically from a multi-FASTA file with the provided

100

programs. The flow-diagram starting from the raw multi-FASTA file to resultant

101

network graphs is shown in Figure 2. Briefly, the procedure is as follows: 1)

102

collect, curate, and align sequences using the provided python programs and

103

other external programs, 2) run network analysis in TCS, and 3) convert data to

104

an HTML file. All procedures are supported by the provided python programs

105

(Step1-3.py). We confirmed compatibilities of Haplotype Explorer and the

106

bundled python scripts with the latest versions of Safari, Firefox, Edge, Chrome,

107

and Python3 on macOS Catalina 10.15.3, respectively.

109

Data analysis

110

Whole genome sequences were retrieved from GISAID (Shu and McCauley

111

2017) on 9 June 2020 using the following options: 1) collection date was before

112

21 March 2020, 2) host was only human, 3) check was on for “complete,” “high

113

coverage,” and “low coverage excl.” After retrieval of a total of 9,583

114

sequences, they were curated by Step1.py. Briefly, the Step1.py is in charge of

115

removing low-quality sequences, such as those containing spaces, gaps,

degenerated bases, and ambiguous collection dates (i.e., month or date are

117

absent in collection date) using seqkit (Shen et al. 2016) and the Linux sed

118

command. Passing sequences were aligned by MAFFT Katoh et al. 2002),

119

clustered by CD-HIT (Fu et al. 2012) (threshold: 100% identical), and SNVs

120

extracted by snp-sites Page et al. 2016). The Step1.py output PHYLIP file is an

121

input of TCS, and the Step2.py assists in executing TCS. The resultant

122

GraphML (.gml) file was parsed by the Step3.py to generate the resultant HTML

123

file for network exploration. In the following analysis, we collected figures by

124

applying the filters “~YYYYMMDD” day by day from the initial day (31

125

December 2019; Wuhan-Hu-1) to 21 March 2020.

Results and Discussion

128

Principal features of Haplotype Explorer toward epidemic dissection

129

The primary feature of Haplotype Explorer is a vibrant and interactive

130

visualization function utilizing D3.js (Bostock et al. 2011) and metadata,

131

including sample size, accession no, location, and collection date, which are

132

important to understand epidemics. Each node is represented by differently-

133

sized pie charts calculated from sample size and location proportion described

134

in the metadata. The node size is automatically calculated using metadata. The

135

nodes and related edges can be interactively highlighted when a specific node

136

is left-clicked, making it easy to dissect a crowded network with large samples

137

(Figure 1). Users can quickly look into the node of interest by zooming with the

138

scroll-wheel, and show metadata by mousing-over the tool-tip window. The

139

application has four text boxes for filtering nodes: GISAID ID, location,

140

YYYYMMDD~, and ~YYYYMMDD. Filters can be combined, and the GISAID ID

141

and location can be specified by regular expressions. The current view of the

142

network can be exported in a JSON format file, and users can resume it by

143

importing the JSON. Finally, the current SVG view can be converted into a high-

144

resolution PNG image using the export button, which is able to be saved by left-

145

clicking. We also provide python scripts for assisting haplotype network

146

construction with in-house data. Details are shown in the flow-diagram (Figure

147

151

The epidemic context of SARS-CoV-2 from January 1 to March 21 was

152

visualized by Haplotype Explorer (Figure 3). We began by capturing a snapshot

153

for 21 March 2020 as an overall view. Haplotype Explorer effectively discerned

154

significantly large, but distinctly invaded clusters consisting of a dozen to over

155

one hundred genome collections formed by late March (Figure 3A; magenta

156

arrowhead). In order to understand epidemics in a time-dependent manner,

157

Haplotype Explorer can also generate snapshots for specified dates (Figure

158

3B).

(A) An example of the exported network generated by Haplotype Explorer using

255

1,729 of SNVs calculated from 4,282 of world-wide SARS-CoV-2 genomes until

256

21 March 2020 obtained from the GISAID database. Each node size depends

257

on sample size, and node colors differ by locations. The black arrow indicates

258

the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. Magenta arrows indicate distinct erosion

259

of SARS-CoV-2 occurring mainly in Europe or America. (B) Three snapshots of

260

the SARS-CoV-2 genomic network around Wuhan, China from January 1 to

261

March 1. Haplotype Explorer enabled us to dissect a haplotype network

262

depending on metadata, giving significant insights into the epidemic.
