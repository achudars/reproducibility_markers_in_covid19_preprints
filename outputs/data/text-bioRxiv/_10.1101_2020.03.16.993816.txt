SUMMARY
The recent global outbreak of viral pneumonia designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has threatened global public health and urged to
investigate its source. Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic
similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore,
RaTG13 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that
RaTG13 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be
crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARSCoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a
recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in
coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short,
our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and
pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and,
during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability.

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, pangolin CoVs, recombination, mutations

INTRODUCTION
The family Coronaviridae is comprised of large, enveloped, single stranded, and positivesense RNA viruses that can infect a wide range of animals including humans (To et al., 2013;
Guan et al., 2003). The viruses are further classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma,
and delta coronavirus (King et al., 2012). So far, all coronaviruses (CoVs) identified in
human belong to the genera alpha and beta. Among them betaCoVs are of particular
importance. Different novel strains of highly infectious betaCoVs have been emerged in
human populations in the past two decades that have caused severe health concern all over
the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was first recognized
in 2003, causing a global outbreak (Zhong, 2004; Peiris et al., 2004; Cherry, 2004). It was
followed by another pandemic event in 2012 by a novel strain of coronavirus designated as
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2013). Both CoVs
were zoonotic pathogens and evolved in animals. Bats in the genus Rhinolophus are natural
reservoir of coronaviruses worldwide, and it is presumed that both SARS-CoV and MERSCoV have been transmitted to human through some intermediate mammalian hosts (Li et al.,
2005a; Bolles et al., 2011; Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2014). Recently, emergence of another
pandemic termed as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization
(WHO) caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
has been reported (Zhu et al., 2020). To date, more than 174,000 people are infected and over
6,600 death tolls, having transmission clusters worldwide including China, Italy, South Korea,
Iran, Japan, USA, France, Spain, Germany and several other countries causing alarming
global health concern.
The large trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) located on the surface of CoVs is crucial for
viral infection and pathogenesis, which is further subdivided into N-terminal S1 subunit and
C-terminal S2 domain. The S1 subunit is specialized in recognizing receptors on host cell,
comprising of two separate domains located at N- and C-terminal which can fold
independently and facilitate receptor engagement (Masters, 2006). Receptor-binding domains
(RBDs) of most CoVs are located on S1 C-terminus and enable attachment to its host
receptor (Li et al., 2005b). The host specificity of virus particle is determined by amino acid
sequence of RBD and is usually dissimilar among different CoVs. Therefore, RBD is a core
determinant for tissue tropism and host range of CoVs. This article presents SARS-CoV-2
phylogenetic trees, comparison and analysis of genome, spike protein, and RBD amino acid

sequences of different CoVs, deducing source and etiology of COVID-19 and evolutionary
relationship among SARS-CoV-2 in human.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Phylogenetic classification of SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related CoVs
To determine the evolutionary relationship of the SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetic analysis was
performed on whole genomic sequences of different CoVs from various hosts. The
Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 1, which illustrates four
main groups representing four genera of CoVs, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.

In the

phylogenetic tree, strains of SARS-CoV-2 (red colored) are cluster together and belong to the
genera Betacoronavirus. Among Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV, Civet SARS CoV, Bat SARS-like
CoVs, bat/RaTG13 CoV, and SARS-CoVs-2 clustered together forming a discrete clade from
MERS-CoVs. The clade is further divided into two branches and one of the branches
comprises all SARS-CoV-2 strains clustered together with Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13 CoV
forming a monophyletic group. Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13 exhibited ~96% genomic similarity
with

SARS-CoV-2.

This

specifies

that

SARS-CoV-2

is

closely

related

to

Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13 CoV.
The ML phylogenetic tree demonstrates that CoVs from bat source are found in the
inner joint or neighboring clade of SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that bats CoVs particularly
Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13 are the source of SARS-CoV-2, and they are emerged and transmitted
from bats to humans through some recombination and transformation events in intermediate
host.

Detection of putative recombination within the spike protein
To explore the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, we investigated CoVs S-protein and
its RBD as they are responsible for determining the host range (Table 1). The S-protein
amino acid sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and related beta-CoVs showed that
bat/Yunnan/RaTG13 shares highest similarity of 97.43%. However, the amino acid sequence
identity of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 with bat/Yunnan/RaTG13 is 89.57%. On the other hand,

pangolin/Guangdong/lung08) revealed highest RBD amino acid sequence identity of 96.68%
and 96.08% respectively with SARS-CoV-2. These indication shows the existence of
homologous recombination events within the S-protein gene between bat and pangolin CoVs.
Similarity plot analysis of CoVs genome sequences from bat, pangolin and human also
indicated a possible recombination within S-protein of SARS-CoVs-19 (Figure S1).
The amino acid residues change in S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 was further analyzed
with

SARS-CoV,

pangolin

and

bat

CoVs

including

pangolin/Guandong/1/2019,

pangolin/Guangdong/lung08, and bat/Yunnan/RaTG13 (Figure 2). Regardless of low
homology

between

SARS-CoV-2

(Wuhan-Hu-1_MN908947)

and

SARS-CoV

(SARS_AAR07630), they had many homologues areas in S-protein. The five key amino acid
residues of S-protein at positions 442,472, 479,480, and 487 of SARS-CoVs are described to
be at the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor complex interface and supposed
to be crucial for human to human and cross-species transmission (Li et al., 2005b; Wu et al.,
2012). Figure 2b and Table S1 describe that all key amino acid residues of RBD (except two
positions) are completely homologues between SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1_MN908947)
and

pangolin

CoVs

(pangolin/Guandong/1/2019

and

pangolin/Guangdong/lung08),

supporting our postulation of recombination event in S-protein gene. Even though, all five
crucial amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 for binding to ACE2 are different from SARSCoV, their hydrophobicity and polarity are similar, having same S-protein structural
confirmation and identical RBD 3-D structure (Xu et al., 2020). In addition, six critical key
residues in MERS-CoV RBD binding to its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) are all
different in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus (Figure 2a).

Ongoing mutations in SARS-CoV-2 during its spread
We also investigated some of the important evolutionary and phylogenetic aspects of SARSCoV-2 during its spread in human population. Mutation in encoding segments of 125 SARSCoV-2 genomes obtained from public-domain databases were investigated. In comparison
with the first reported SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1_MN908947), amino acid substitutions
were observed at 87 positions of SARS-CoV-2 open reding frames (orfs) (Figure 3). Total
number of amino acid substitution in corresponding orfs are listed in Table 2. Among
different orfs of SARS-CoV-2, orf1a was most variable segment with total number of 44

dissimilar amino acid substitutions. It was followed by spike segment S orf with 13 amino
acid residue substitutions. However, orf6 and orf7b are the most conserved regions without
amino acid changes. In addition, orf10, E, M and orf7a have tended to be more conserved,
with only one or two amino acid substitutions.
With the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, its amino acid sequence is also significantly
varied (Figure 3). Usually, RNA viruses have high rate of genetic mutations, which leads to
evolution and provide them with increased adaptability (Lin et al., 2019). To further explore
SARS-CoV-2 evolution in human, we have performed phylogenetic analysis based on the
aforementioned SARS-CoV-2 in correspondence with their amino acid substitution. Figure
4. illustrates the phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 and associated amino acid changes. Our
phylogenetic tree demonstrates that BetaCoV/Chongqing/YC01/2020 is the closest SARSCoV-2 to bat CoV (Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13) as compared to the first reported SARS-CoV-2
(Wuhan-Hu-1_MN908947). Taking BetaCoV/Chongqing/YC01/2020 as a reference group,
South Korea SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/South_Korea/SNU01/2020) has 7 amino acid
substitutions in six orfs (S, E, orf1a, orf31, and orf8). BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-001/2020
has total of 16 amino acid substitutions in four coding regions with highest substitution of 11
amino acid residues in orf1a. United States of America (USA) SARS-CoV-2
(BetaCoV/USA/MA1/2020) has 5 amino acid substitutions in N, orf1a, orf1ab, and orf8.
France CoV (BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020) has 3 amino acid mutations in orf1a and 1
amino acid mutation in orf8.

CONCLUSION
Based on amino acid and genome sequences analysis and comparison, our results suggest that
SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus between bat and pangolin coronaviruses, and the
recombination event has been occurred in spike protein genes. Our finding suggest that
pangolin is the most possible intermediate SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, which may have given
rise to cross-species transmission to humans. These new findings suggest further research to
investigate pangolin as a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Another important outcome of our analysis
is the genetic mutations and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it spread globally. These findings
are very significant for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sequence data collection
One hundred and twenty-five newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes were
obtained from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data EpiFluTM database (GISAID
EpiFluTM) and GenBank. Closely related beta-CoVs genomes sequences from different hosts
were also collected and analyzed together with SARS-CoV-2. Open reading frames (orfs) of
CoVs genomes were predicted using ORFfinder (v0.4.3) with default parameters ignoring
nested orfs.
Raw pair-end reads of pangolin dataset sample (SRR10168377) obtained from NCBI were
filtered with bbmap.sh (v38.79) by removing adaptors, trimming low quality reads from both
sides (quality value < 20), and reads length less than 50 nt were ignored. Host reference
genome (pangolin ManJav1.0, GCF_001685135.1) contaminant reads were removed by
bowtie2 (v2.3.5.1) [13]. Pangolin CoV genome fragments were assembled via MEGAHIT
(v1.2.9) (Li et al., 2015).

Phylogenetic and recombination analysis
The sequences of CoVs were aligned using multiple sequence alignment MAFFT (v7.450)
(Katoh et al., 2019). Aligned sequences were visualized with Jalview (v2.10.3) (Waterhouse
et al., 2009). Poorly aligned regions and gaps were removed by trimAL (v1.4.rev22)
(Capellagutiérrez et al., 2009). Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees of whole
genome sequences were constructed in IQ-TREE (v1.6.12) (Nguyen et al., 2015). Support for
inferred relationships in the phylogenetic tree was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000
replicates and the best-fit substitution model was determined by IQ-TREE model test.
