Abstract

26

Resolving the COVID-19 pandemic requires diagnostic testing to determine which individuals

27

are infected and which are not. The current gold standard is to perform RT-PCR on

28

nasopharyngeal samples. Best-in-class assays demonstrate a limit of detection (LoD) of 100

29

copies of viral RNA per milliliter of transport media. However, LoDs of currently approved

30

assays vary over 10,000-fold. Assays with higher LoDs will miss more infected patients,

31

resulting in more false negatives. However, the false-negative rate for a given LoD remains

32

unknown. Here we address this question using over 27,500 test results for patients from across

33

our healthcare network tested using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA. These results

34

suggest that each 10-fold increase in LoD is expected to increase the false negative rate by

35

13%, missing an additional one in eight infected patients. The highest LoDs on the market will

36

miss a majority of infected patients, with false negative rates as high as 70%. These results

37

suggest that choice of assay has meaningful clinical and epidemiological consequences. The

38

limit of detection matters.

Introduction

41

In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic being declared a public health emergency, clinical

42

and commercial laboratories as well as test kit manufacturers have been submitting diagnostic

43

devices and assays for expedited Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug

44

Administration (FDA EUA). As of June 2020, there were over 85 such EUA issuances for

45

COVID-19

46

devices/emergency-use-authorizations, accessed June 1, 2020). However, optimal use of these

47

assays requires consideration of several issues.

48

First, NP swabs are generally considered to provide optimal detection early in disease.

49

However, even for this sample type, there is currently no ideal reference standard to establish

50

clinical sensitivities of the available EUA SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays (1). Second, details

51

about assay limit of detection (LoD) are often not provided with sufficient detail and

52

transparency to allow facile comparisons. For molecular diagnostic assays, the LoD is generally

53

considered the lowest concentration of target that can be detected in ≥95% of repeat

54

measurements. The LoD is a measure of analytic sensitivity, as opposed to clinical sensitivity,

55

which measures the fraction of infected people detected by a given test. LoDs are sometimes

56

reported in units other than copies of viral genomic RNA per milliliter of transport media

57

(copies/mL), such as TCID50, copies/microliter, copies per reaction volume, or molarity of assay

58

target, making comparisons difficult. Third, the LoDs of currently approved EUA nucleic acid

59

amplification and antigen detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 vary up to 10,000 fold (see below)

60

and likely are associated with meaningful differences in clinical sensitivity for these tests.

61

Fourth, although LoDs are quantitative, and RT-PCR tests are inherently quantitative, in practice

62

results for SARS-CoV-2 testing are generally reported qualitatively, as positive or negative,

63

even though viral load may provide both clinically and epidemiologically important information.

64

Two barriers to quantitative reporting are demonstration that qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values

65

are repeatable with acceptably low variance and a reliable means of converting from Ct value to

66

viral load. The latter is complicated by a traditional requirement for a standard curve that must

67

span a range of viral loads at least as large as what is observed in the patient population, which

68

can be expensive and time-consuming, especially in a pandemic where the limits of this range

69

are unknown; however, there have been reports demonstrating how appropriate measurements,

70

based on the principles of RT-PCR, can be used as an alternative for reliable conversion of Ct

71

values to viral loads (2, 3).

72

Here we report on the reliability of Cts for the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 EUA (LoD 100 copies viral

73

RNA/mL transport medium, among the best in class) (4) and a conversion from Ct to viral load,

74

which together support the use of reporting viral loads clinically, and also on an observation

75

based on over 4,700 first-time positive results that makes it possible to estimate the clinical

76

sensitivity and false-negative rate of both this assay and other assays that have received EUA

77

for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings have clear implications for patient care,

78

epidemiology, and the social and economic management of the ongoing pandemic.

79

Methods

80

Setting and time period. All SARS-CoV-2 testing data from The Beth Israel Lahey Health

81

Network from March 26th to May 2nd, 2020 was included in our analysis. The study was

82

deemed exempt by our hospital institutional review board.

83

Testing. Tests were performed using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay, a real-time

84

reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for qualitative detection of

85

SARS-CoV-2 in NP and oropharyngeal swabs (5). The dual target assay detects both the

86

SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and N genes with a reported LoD of 100 copies/mL. The assay also

87

includes an internal control. Results are reported as positive if the Ct value is ≤31.5, based upon

88

the signal threshold determined by the manufacturer. Ct values for all first-time positive test

89

results were analyzed. Repeat tests were excluded in order to more accurately estimate the

90

range of Ct values of the infected population upon presentation at our medical center. In our

91

internal validation we determined that the LoD with 100% detection for the Abbott m2000

92

platform was 100 copies/mL (n=80), with Ct mean and standard deviation at this LoD,

93

26.061.03 (4). Note, the Ct determination on Abbott M2000rt platform is alternatively called the

94

fractional cycle number (FCN) and is specifically one way of determining the cycle number at

95

the maximum amplification efficiency inflection point, i.e, the maxRatio, of each amplification

96

curve (6). The FCN has been reported to be a more robust measure for Ct determination than a

97

fixed fluorescence threshold.

98

Statistics. Variance was estimated by R2 of Ct values for repeat tests obtained within 6 hours

99

(n=25 patients, excluding one obvious outlier that by itself accounted for half the total variance:

100

initial Ct 4.4, but repeat negative and attributed to pre-analytic or analytic technical error) and 12

101

hours (n=51 patients, excluding the same outlier). The conversion from Ct value to viral load

102

was performed using the definition of exponential growth with variable efficiency (2, 3).

103

Efficiency was measured from plots of fluorescence intensity vs. cycle number for 50 positive

104

samples chosen at random, yielding an expression for viral load in copies/mL as a function of Ct

105

(Eq. 6, Supplementary Methods). Per this expression, the expected negative cutoff corresponds

106

to 9.2 copies per mL or ~2 virions per RT-PCR reaction volume (0.5mL), supporting the validity

107

of our parameter estimation.

108

We used Python (v3.6) and its NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas libraries to plot linear

109

regression and Theil-Sen slopes with 95% confidence intervals on repeat positives; a

110

normalized cumulative distribution (histogram) of positive results (with reversed x-axis for ease

113

Results

114

Of the 27,098 tests performed on 20,076 patients over the testing period, 6,037 tests were

115

positive (22%), representing 4,774 unique patients. Analysis of repeats within 6 or 12 hours of

116

each other (7) demonstrated high repeatability of Ct values over these short time windows (R2

117

0.70 and 0.63, n=25 and 51, respectively), supporting the validity of this quantitative measure as

118

a basis for assessment of viral load in patients (Fig. 1). We used basic principles of PCR and

119

detailed measurements of PCR efficiency on 50 randomly chosen positive samples to convert

120

from Ct values to viral load, in units of copies of viral RNA per mL of viral transport medium. In

121

order to study the patient population upon presentation without confounding by repeat

122

measurements on the same patients, the remainder of the analysis was on the first positive

123

value for the above 4,774 unique patients.

124

Viral loads spanned nearly nine orders of magnitude, from 9 copies/mL to 2.5 billion copies/mL

125

(Fig. 2). Notably, patients were almost equally likely to exhibit low, medium, or high viral loads

126

upon initial testing, with remarkable uniformity down to the LoD of 100 copies/mL (R2=0.99). The

127

reason for this uniformity is unknown. Fewer patients had viral loads below the LoD, as reflected

128

by the curve’s departure from the trend in this range. Because the LoD is a 95% confidence

129

limit, the difference between the curve and the trend likely reflects false negatives: the lower the

130

viral load, the greater the likelihood that infection will be missed. By definition, only 5% of

131

patients with viral load at the LoD are expected to be missed (1 in 20 patients); this percentage

132

grows for patients with viral loads below this threshold. Thus, extending the observed trend

133

leftward to the assay’s positive cutoff, which corresponds to approximately two virions per

134

reaction, yields an estimate of the total false negative rate for this assay of 10%, and thus a

135

clinical sensitivity of 90%, or 9 in 10 infected individuals.

136

This method can be used to estimate the clinical sensitivity of assays with other LoDs. For

137

example, an assay with LoD of 1,000 copies/mL, such as that of the CDC assay (8) or Genmark

138

ePlex EUA (9), is expected to detect 77%, or 3 in 4, of infected individuals, for a false-negative

139

rate of 22%. With an LoD of 6,250 copies/mL, the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR EUA test has an

140

estimated clinical sensitivity of 67% and a false-negative rate of 33%, missing approximately 1

141

in 3 infected individuals. The first EUA antigen detection assay, the Quidel Sofia2 SARS Antigen

142

FIA, has an LoD of approximately 6 million in a contrived universal transport medium sample

143

collection. Although the package insert indicates the LoD using TCID 50 units, the BEI Resources

144

control material referenced lists both TCID50 and genome copies/mL, allowing the calculation of

145

the latter and an associated estimated clinical sensitivity of 31%, i.e., it would miss 7 in 10

146

infected patients.

147

Discussion

148

The diagnostic priorities in the COVID-19 pandemic are to robustly identify three populations:

149

the infected, the infectious, and the susceptible. Our study addresses the first of these.

150

Specifically, it illustrates the clinical and epidemiologic impact of assay LoD on SAR-CoV-2

151

diagnosis and the challenges of interpreting and comparing molecular assay results across

152

various platforms. First, viral loads vary widely among infected individuals, from individuals with

153

extremely high viral loads, potential “super-spreaders” who presumably would be picked up by

154

even the least sensitive assays, to those whose viral loads are near, at, or even below the LoD

155

of many assays. Therefore, a substantial fraction of infected patients will be missed by less

156

sensitive assays. Concerningly, some of these missed patients are, have been, or will become

157

infectious, and such misses will undermine public health efforts and put patients and their

158

contacts at risk. This must give pause in the rush to approve additional testing options and

159

increase testing capacity, and emphasizes the importance of defining infectivity as a function of

160

viral load and other factors (e.g. time of exposure), which remains a critical unknown in this

161

pandemic.

162

Antigen detection assays promise rapid turnaround time, point-of-care implementation, and low

163

cost. For influenza detection, such tests have exhibited substantially lower analytical and clinical

164

sensitivity compared with NAAT tests (10). The poor historical performance for influenza

165

detection led to reclassification of influenza rapid antigen detection tests as Class II devices with

166

a new minimal performance standard of at least 80% sensitivity compared with NAAT (11).

167

Previously, clinical sensitivity of 50-88% for the Quidel Sofia influenza test was noted in several

168

studies in different influenza seasons compared to RT-PCR comparators (12-14). The same

169

trend was observed in our analysis of the single SARS-CoV-2 antigen test introduced thus far

170

with EUA status. Tests with such performance characteristics will identify individuals with the

171

highest viral burden. However, such a high detection threshold will be unlikely to fully meet

172

public or individual health goals in the COVID-19 pandemic.

173

Our findings also suggest that Ct values and imputed viral loads have clinical utility. Real-time

174

PCR methods in particular are inherently quantitative, and we demonstrate here that they are

175

quite reproducible during repeated clinical sampling over a short time period, with R2 of 0.70 for

176

repeats within six hours (as a proxy for immediate repeats). We note that because PCR

177

efficiency can fall substantially with PCR cycle number, as we observed here, viral load is

178

ideally calculated not simply as a powers-of-2 transformation of Ct value but based on the

179

observed trend between efficiency and Ct number. This trend may differ by assay: for example,

180

the assay used here includes an internal control whose product may contribute to polymerase

181

inhibition. (This method can be extended to provide confidence limits that incorporate the

182

variance in, e.g., the Ct of the LoD, but this extension is beyond the scope of the current work.)

183

As yet it is unclear whether or how viral loads affect prognosis, but they at least suggest a

184

measure of infectivity, as well as possibly severity of illness, and, therefore may have value for

185

public health efforts, as we learn which cutoffs may imply minimal or inconsequential infectivity,

186

especially during clearance of infection. We make explicit our assumption that ~2 virions per

187

reaction, translating to a viral load of 9 copies/mL, reflects a 100% detection rate. With stricter

188

cutoffs, clinical sensitivity falls slightly (e.g., from 90% to 86% for an assay with an LoD of 100

189

copies/mL, if using a cutoff of 4 copies/mL, or a single virion per reaction, and to 79% if using a

190

cutoff of 0.7 copies/mL, or a single virion per 3mL transport tube). Regardless, these different

191

assumptions have essentially no effect on the relative clinical sensitivities of different assays.

192

While it is theoretically possible that even lower levels of infection are possible, making our

193

estimates of clinical sensitivity upper limits, we believe potential for contagion at these levels is

194

highly unlikely, as that would assume that breathing, a cough, or a sneeze would transmit more

195

particles than can be obtained by dedicated and vigorous physical swabbing of the actual

196

nasopharynx.

197

To control the pandemic, ultimately we will need diagnostics for all three populations of interest,

198

infected, infectious, and susceptible, and for that we will need to understand whether and how

199

viral load relates to infectiousness. As we have shown, assays with higher LoD are likely to miss

200

non-negligible fractions of infected individuals. However, individuals with viral burdens low

201

enough to be missed by some assays may prove to be less infectious. In vitro, approximately

202

only 1 of 10,000 genome copies in viral cultures may be associated with a tissue culture

203

infectious viral particle based on standard preparation such as BEI Resources NR-52866(15).

204

However, it is unclear how or whether this fraction might change with viral load for patients in

205

vivo.

206

The ultimate lesson from these studies bears repetition: LoD matters and directly impacts efforts

207

to identify, control, and contain outbreaks during this pandemic. Various assays report out LoDs

208

in manners that are often difficult to comprehend, for example, TCID 50 values that may related

209

to viral copy numbers in different ways depending on the viral preparation, or units of copies/µL

210

(1 copy/µL = 1,000 copies/mL) or attomolar quantities (1 attomolar = 602 copies/mL). We

211

therefore suggest that viral copies/mL be used as a universal standard metric, so that cross

212

comparison between assays can readily be made. It is clear that viral load matters, and

213

therefore LoD values should be readily evaluable and in the public domain.
