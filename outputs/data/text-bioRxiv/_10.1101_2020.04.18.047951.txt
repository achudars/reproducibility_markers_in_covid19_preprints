Abstract
Background:
Leading to a sustained epidemic spread with >40,000 confirmed human infections,
including >10,000 deaths, COVID-19 was caused by 2019-nCov and resulted in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which brought more challenges to
the patient's treatment. The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the
entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor
binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell
membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for
the zoonotic transmission of 2019-nCov. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is
likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2
receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which
considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the
expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited.
Methods: In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in
oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new
coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence
datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to
confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level.
Results: The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and
FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of
FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC
experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the
target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in
fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results.
Conclusions: Based on these findings, we speculated that 2019-nCov could
effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2
receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results

valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.

Introduction
In December 2019, an increasing number of patients with pneumonia caused by
unknown pathogen emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations
greatly resembling viral pneumonia [1, 2, 3]. A novel coronavirus, which was named as
Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) by The World Health Organization (WHO),
was detected from lower respiratory tract samples via deep sequencing analysis [1]. As
of 15th April 2020, the number of coronavirus infections approaches more than two
million people and kill more than a hundred thousand [4]. The present outbreak of the
2019 coronavirus strain has been labeled as a global pandemic by WHO [5]. The
Covid-19 outbreak has posed critical challenges for the public health, research, and
medical communities.
Similar to those of patients with SARS and MERS, the clinical manifestations of
COVID-19 at illness onset are fever, dry cough, and myalgia. The patients may suffer
from dyspnea, shortness of breath, and then respiratory failure and even death in later
stages [2, 6, 7]. Previous findings indicated that the ACE2 plays an important role in
cellular entry, thus ACE2-expressing cells may act as target cells and are susceptible
to COVID-19 infection [2, 8, 9, 10,]. Besides, ACE2 receptor was proven to be expressed
in 72 human tissues, and is abundantly present in the epithelia of the lung and small
intestines [11]. Studies also found ACE2 expression in the epithelial layer of nasal and
oral mucosa. However, this conclusion was based on the bulk RNA datasets. The cell
type and number of cells expressing ACE2 in each tissue could not be estimated.
As a co-expressed membrane endopeptidase of ACE2 receptor, FURIN play a
central role in the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) entering into the
host cells through cleaving its envelope glycoprotein [12]. Genomic characterization of
the 2019-nCov have revealed that FURIN enzyme could activate the specific site of
its spike protein [13]. Meanwhile, Li H. et. al revealed that a putative FURIN-cleavage
site reported recently in the spike protein of 2019-nCov may facilitate the virus-cell
fusion, which can explain the virus transmission features[14]. In addition, Ma Y and
co-authors found that presence of FURIN cleavage site, which is absent in other
coronavirus, during the course of 2019-nCov infection may cause some distinct
clinical symptoms from SARS-CoV infection[15]. Similar results were also reported in
Li X.’s study from China[16]. Hence, the expression and distribution of ACE2 and
FURIN in human body were the key factors for the coronavirus to invade host cells.
Furthermore, online single-cell sequence datasets analysis unveiled that FURIN was
expressed in coronavirus’s potential target organs, such as lung, heart, nose, rectum,
colon, intestine and ileum [14]. However, information on the expression and
distribution of ACE2 and FURIN in oral cavity were limited.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technique, which provides an avenue
to understand gene regulation networks, metastasis and the complexity of intratumoral
cell-to-cell heterogeneity at the single-cell level, has diverse applications on
bioinformatics, stem cell differentiation, organ development, whole-tissue subtyping
and tumor biology [17,18,19]. It captures cellular differences underlying tumor biology at
a higher resolution than regular bulk RNA-seq and has revolutionized studies of
cancer mechanisms and personalized medicine [ 20 ]. For better understanding the

potential infection risk in oral cavity, we explored whether the ACE2 and FURIN
were expressed and their expressing cells composition and proportion in different oral
tissues based on the public scRNA-seq profiles from GEO public databases. Then
IHC analysis was used to further confirm the results in the protein level.

Materials and methods
Public scRNA-seq dataset acquisition
Single-cell RNA-seq dataset(GSE103322) including the gene expression and cell type
annotation from human oral squamous cell carcinoma tissue were downloaded from
the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

Single-cell sequencing analysis
Single-cell RNA-seq datasets (GSE103322) were downloaded from the GEO database.
Datasets of five patients, which have the closest histological features with normal
tissue, were selected for futher analysis. The scRNA-seq data sets of
GSE103322_HN_UMI_table.txt was used to subsequently analyze based on R
package Seurat (Version 3.6.2). To control quality, we removed cells with < 50 genes,
and as well as the cells with mitochondrial content higher than 5%. Besides, the genes
detected in < 3 cells were filtered out in the function CreateSeuratObject.
Subsequently, the data was log-normalized using the function NormalizeData with the
default parameters. The FindVariableGenes function was used to determine the highly
expressed variable genes, followed by PCA dimensionality reduction by RunPCA
function. PCA components, which P value was less than 0.05, were selected to further
analyze using Two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE).
The setting of k.param was 20 in the function FindNeighbors, and the setting of the
resolution was 0.5 in the function FindClusters. Finally, the cell types were assigned
based on their canonical markers. Gene expression of different cell types was
displayed by the functions of DotPlot and VlnPlot. The significant level was set as
0.05.

Human oral tissue specimens
Ten tissues of oral mucosa (three buccal tissues, two palatal tissues, two tongue
tissues and three gingival tissues) were obtained from patients after informed consent
and ethical approval from Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,
then sent for IHC. Oral tissue was taken from 10 different patients with an average
age of 53. Tissue morphology was evaluated in haematoxylin and eosin-stained
sections by a qualified pathologist. Tissues meeting the diagnostic criteria of nondiseased were included in our research. [11,21]

Immunohistochemical staining
4-μm sections of selected tissues were de-waxed, rehydrated, and subjected to heatinduced antigen retrieval by overnight incubation in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer at 80 ◦C.
Subsequently, they were dried and incubated anti-ACE2 (cat. no. ab15348 , Abcam,
Cambridge, CB, UK) antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody was added to the sections. Peroxidase activity was developed by
using DAB for 8 min and counterstained with hematoxylin. The expression levels of
ACE2 were evaluated by two experimenters. A qualified pathologist analyzed the
staining for structures positive for ACE2. The stain intensity of ACE2 and FURIN
was semiquantitatively graded according to the previous methods[22].

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined with a one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni’s post-hoc test for multiple group comparisons or Student’s t-test for two
group comparisons. For all tests, p < 0.05 or < 0.01 was considered statistically
significant or very significant.
Results
Identification of cell types in the oral mucosal tissues
We analyzed 1843 individual cells from the oral mucosa of five patients. Using the
unsupervised graph-based clustering, we found that at least thirteen distinct cell
clusters existed in the oral tissues (Fig. 2A), including epithelial cells (clusters 1, 4, 5),
fibroblasts (clusters 0, 2, 7), T-cells (clusters 8, 9), and B cells (cluster 12). The
heatmap of main corresponding cell marker gene expression profiles across the cell
types can be found in Fig. 2B. The marker gene of epithelial cells included KRT6B,
GJB2, SFN, and KRT14, fibroblasts included THY1, COL1A1, DCN, ACTA2, B
cells included SLAMF7, CD19, CD20 and CD79A and T-cells included CD2, CD3,
CD45.
Identification of ACE2-expressing cells in the oral mucosa
As ACE2 had been proven to be one of the major receptors of COVID-2019 in human
body, we explored the online datasets to find out the expression level of ACE2 in oral
mucosa. As expected, data from GEO indicated that ACE2 receptor expression level
was relatively higher in epithelial cells (cluster 1, 5, 6)(Fig. 3A, 3B), while very little
cellular expression of ACE2 was found in fibroblasts (cluster 2). Then we calculated
the percent of ACE2-expressing cells in the dataset (Fig. 3C). We find that, in oral
tissue, the percentage of ACE2-positive cells was 2.2%. Among them, 92% were
epithelial cells.
Identification of FURIN-expressing cells in the oral mucosa
To determine the cell types of expressing FURIN, we analyzed the FURIN mRNA
expression using tSNE method. Violin and scatter plot showed that FURIN was
highly expressed in epithelial cells, follow by fibroblasts, T-cells, and endothelial
cells of the oral mucosal tissues, but hardly expressed in B cells (Fig. 4A, 4B).
Meanwhile, the proportion of FURIN-expression cells was approximately 10%.
Among them, epithelial cells make up more than 55% (Fig. 4C).
ACE2 protein was highly expressed in epithelial layer of the buccal mucosa, lip,
palate, tongue and gingiva
To further determine the protein expression level of ACE2 in the oral mucosa, IHC
experiments were performed. The first remarkable finding was that ACE2 was present
in epithelial cells in all the tissues studied (Fig. 5). Results indicated that the
expression level of ACE2 protein was significantly higher in the lip, tongue, and
buccal mucosa, especially the epithelial cells in the basal layer, although the mRNA
expression level is not as high (Fig. 3). The ACE2-postive cells in the gingival and
palate tissue were limited. The corresponding gingiva and palate epithelial cells
showed weak positive ACE2 staining. Also, we found that ACE2 expressed in
fibroblasts and endothelial cells. These results indicate that oral epithelial cells were
the potential targets of 2019-nCov.
FURIN protein was highly expressed in the normal oral mucosa

FURIN mRNA expression has been described mainly in oral epithelial cells through
scRNA-seq technique. To determine whether this differential expression of FURIN
was maintained at the protein level, oral tissues from different sites were screened. As
shown in Fig. 6, moderate to mild immunostaining in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells
can be seen in five normal oral tissues. Surprisingly, except for the positive cells in
the basal layer of oral epithelium, the spinous layer in all examined tissues also turned
out with large numbers of FURIN-positive cells. In addition, the percentage of
FURIN-positive cells in lip, tongue and gingiva was higher than that of buccal and
palate mucosa. These results indicated that 2019-nCov might be able to infect oral
tissues through the route of FURIN-mediated fusion with oral mucosal cell.

Discussion
The amazing spreading speed of 2019-nCov and the large number of infected
people have quickly overwhelmed the public health services in the world, and have
become a global public health problem [23]. As mentioned before, ACE2 receptor in
cell membrane and FURIN clearage site of 2019-nCov were the key factors that
allowed the virus to invade the host [14, 15]. Many studies have shown that ACE2
receptor was highly expressed in respiratory epithelium, kidney, cardiovascular
system and testis [24]. Some scholars also found that ACE2 was expressed in oral
tissues with bulk RNA sequencing data, which could not accurately reflect the
expression of ACE2 on the single cell level [21, 25]. Chen et al. benefited from the
single-cell sequencing data to further proved the expression of ACE2 receptor in
tongue, buccal mucosa and gingiva [11]. However, these studies were based on public
databases and were not analyzed together, and further validation of protein levels was
lacking.
In addition, virologist Gary Whittaker of Cornell University, whose team
published another structural analysis of the coronavirus S protein on bioRxiv on
February 18th, argues that the FURIN cutting site allows the virus to enter cells in a
very different way than SARS, and this may affect the stability and spread of the virus
[26]
. Other research teams have also identified this activation site, suggesting that it
may enable the virus to spread effectively between humans [13]. It has been
demonstrated that 2019-nCov could fuse with cell membrane and then entry into the
target cells[27,28]. Researchers have found FURIN proteases in many tissues, including
the lungs, liver, and small intestine [29]. However, limited reports were seen regarding
the expression of FURIN in oral cavity and whether the new coronavirus could spread
by oral cavity are not fully understood. Thus, 2019-nCov host cell receptor ACE2 and
FURIN enzyme were investigated in five different oral sites and the results would be
valuable for the prevention of the COVID-19 spreading.
The present study detected the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in different oral
mucosal tissues via scRNA-Seq technique. As expected, ACE2 and FURIN were
mainly expressed in the epithelial cells of oral mucosa, which were similar to the
previous reports [30, 31, 32]. In addition, we also found that FURIN were expressed on
the fibroblasts, endothelial cells and T-cells, and the percentage of positive cells was
dramatically higher than that of ACE2. These results were further validated by the
IHC tests. Interestingly, although no ACE2 receptors were found using scRNA-Seq
methods, IHC result revealed that the ACE2 also expressed in lymphocytes within
oral mucosa, and similar results were found in oral cavity and other various organs [21].
But, the proportion of ACE2-positive lymphocytes is quite small, whether
coronaviruses invade the lymphocytes needs further validation. The underlying reason

may be the individual differences of sampling tissues and different dimensionality
reduction methods in data processing. Stringkly, the live 2019-nCov was consistently
detected in the self-collected saliva of 91.7% of patients till 11 days after
hospitalization, and it could be transmitted via saliva, directly or indirectly, even
among asymptomatic infected patients [33]. These results indicated that ACE2 and
FURIN were abundantly expressed in oral mucosa, which implied the potential attack
and spread of 2019-nCov in the oral tissues through two possible target protein.
Therefore, we should pay close attention to protecting the oral tissues of all people,
preventing the virus from spreading through the mouth.
In the current study, we investigated the expression of other endopeptidases in
various oral mucosa cells using the public single-cell sequence datasets. As shown by
voilin plot in supplemental files, the high expression of ACE2 sheddase, ADAM17,
ADAM10 indicated the higher membrane fusion activity, virus uptake and virus
replication in the oral mucosa. Besides, the endopeptidases (such as CAPN1 and
CAPNS1) were abundantly enriched in the oral mucosal cells. Large proportion of
endopeptidases positive cells in the different oral sites provided opportunities for
2019-nCov infection and rapid replication in the oral cavity [15]. These results were in
accordance with the previous study, which indicated the residence of 2019-nCov in
nasal and throats swab samples, suggesting the strong spread ability in oral cavity [34].
Based on our results, we would like to make a few suggestions about the
prevention of this new virus. First, all the healthcare workers should focus on taking
effective measures to prevent the virus from spreading via the oral cavity. It is
necessary to wear facemask and face shields during this pandemic. Due to the droplets
and aerosols generated during dental clinical procedures and high risk of cross
infection, strict and effective infection control protocols are urgently needed for
patients and dental practitioners [35]. In addition, antimicrobial mouth rinse, which was
proven to reduce the number of microbes in the oral cavity, was suggested before any
dental operation [36]. Second, for groups with higher virus prevalence, it is worth
advocating and encouraging this population to drink from their own glass, have
separate meals, and reduced conversation while eating. Also, washing hands before
meals and after going to the toilet is needed. Third, oral symptoms, such as dry mouth
and taste blindness may also be considered as initial symptoms of COVID-19
infection [25]. Moreover, potential impairment of oral tissues should be evaluated after
infected with 2019-nCov, giving more evidence to the prevention and treatment of
COVID-19.
In conclusion, our results further confirm the potential role of ACE2 receptor of
2019-nCov invading targeted oral mucosal cells in the protein level. Additionally, we
discovered that FURIN enzyme and ACE2 recepor were mainly expressed in
epithelial cells, implying the possible two transmission routes of the coronavirus
through oral mucosa, which provides a new insight to the future prevention strategy in
clinical cares as well as daily life. More evidence is still needed to reinforce these
findings.
