Abstract
Background:

Leading to a sustained epidemic spread with >2,000,000 confirmed human infections,
including >100,000 deaths, COVID-19 was caused by SARS-CoV-2 and resulted in
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis, which brought more
challenges to the patient's treatment. The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key
factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, contains two functional domains: an
ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the
coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion
domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has
been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition,
FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue,
and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus.
However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited.
Methods: In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in
oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new
coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence
datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to
confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level.

Results: The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and
FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of
FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC
experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the
target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in
fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results.
Conclusions: Based on these findings, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could
effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2
receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results
indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which provides
valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, an increasing number of patients with pneumonia caused by
unknown pathogen emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations
greatly resembling viral pneumonia

[1, 2, 3]

. A novel coronavirus, which was named as

Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) by The World Health Organization (WHO),
was detected from lower respiratory tract samples via deep sequencing analysis [1]. As
of 15th April 2020, the number of coronavirus infections approaches more than two
million people and kill more than a hundred thousand [4]. The present outbreak of the
2019 coronavirus strain has been labeled as a global pandemic by WHO

[5]

. The

Covid-19 outbreak has posed critical challenges for the public health, research, and
medical communities.
Similar to those of patients with SARS and MERS, the clinical manifestations of
COVID-19 at illness onset are fever, dry cough, and myalgia. The patients may suffer
from dyspnea, shortness of breath, and then respiratory failure and even death in later
stages

[2, 6, 7]

. Previous findings indicated that the ACE2 plays an important role in

cellular entry, thus ACE2-expressing cells may act as target cells and are susceptible
to COVID-19 infection [2, 8, 9, 10,]. Besides, ACE2 receptor was proven to be expressed
in 72 human tissues, and is abundantly present in the epithelia of the lung and small
intestines

[11]

. Studies also found ACE2 expression in the epithelial layer of nasal and

oral mucosa. However, this conclusion was based on the bulk RNA datasets. The cell
type and number of cells expressing ACE2 in each tissue could not be estimated.
As a co-expressed membrane endopeptidase of ACE2 receptor, FURIN play a
central role in the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) entering into the
host cells through cleaving its envelope glycoprotein [12]. Genomic characterization of
the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) have revealed
that FURIN enzyme could activate the specific site of its spike protein [13]. Meanwhile,
Li H. et. al revealed that a putative FURIN-cleavage site reported recently in the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the virus-cell fusion, which can explain the
virus transmission features[14]. In addition, Ma Y and co-authors found that presence
of FURIN cleavage site, which is absent in other coronavirus, during the course of
SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause some distinct clinical symptoms from SARS-CoV
infection[15]. Similar results were also reported in Li X.’s study from China[16]. Hence,
the expression and distribution of ACE2 and FURIN in human body were the key
factors for the coronavirus to invade host cells. Furthermore, online single-cell
sequence datasets analysis unveiled that FURIN was expressed in coronavirus’s
potential target organs, such as lung, heart, nose, rectum, colon, intestine and ileum
[14]

. However, information on the expression and distribution of ACE2 and FURIN in

oral cavity were limited.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technique, which provides an avenue
to understand gene regulation networks, metastasis and the complexity of intratumoral
cell-to-cell heterogeneity at the single-cell level, has diverse applications on
bioinformatics, stem cell differentiation, organ development, whole-tissue subtyping
and tumor biology [17,18,19]. It captures cellular differences underlying tumor biology at
a higher resolution than regular bulk RNA-seq and has revolutionized studies of
cancer mechanisms and personalized medicine

[ 20 ]

. For better understanding the

potential infection risk in oral cavity, we explored whether the ACE2 and FURIN
were expressed and their expressing cells composition and proportion in different oral
tissues based on the public scRNA-seq profiles from GEO public databases. Then
IHC analysis was used to further confirm the results in the protein level. These results
will provide a theoretical basis for clarifying the possible invading path and damage
of SARS-CoV-2 in oral tissues.

2.1 Public scRNA-seq dataset acquisition
Single-cell RNA-seq dataset(GSE103322) including the gene expression and cell type
annotation from human oral squamous cell carcinoma tissue (OSCC) were
downloaded from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).
2.2 Single-cell sequencing analysis
Single-cell RNA-seq datasets (GSE103322) were downloaded from the GEO database.
Datasets of five patients, which have the closest histological features with normal
tissue, were selected for futher analysis. The scRNA-seq data sets of
GSE103322_HN_UMI_table.txt was used to subsequently analyze based on R
package Seurat (Version 3.6.2). To control quality, we removed cells with < 50 genes,
and as well as the cells with mitochondrial content higher than 5%. Besides, the genes
detected in < 3 cells were filtered out in the function CreateSeuratObject.
Subsequently, the data was log-normalized using the function NormalizeData with the
default parameters. The FindVariableGenes function was used to determine the highly
expressed variable genes, followed by PCA dimensionality reduction by RunPCA
function. PCA components, which P value was less than 0.05, were selected to further
analyze using Two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE).
The setting of k.param was 20 in the function FindNeighbors, and the setting of the
resolution was 0.5 in the function FindClusters. Finally, the cell types were assigned
based on their canonical markers. Gene expression of different cell types was
displayed by the functions of DotPlot and VlnPlot. The significant level was set as
0.05.
2.3 Human oral tissue specimens
Twelve normal tissues of oral mucosa (three buccal and gingival tissues, two lip,
tongue and palatal tissues respectively) were taken from 12 different patients with
clinically diagnosed fibrous epithelial polyp or benign tumor [11,21], whose average age
was 53. Written informed consent was obtained for each participant, and the study
was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines approved by
the Clinical Ethics Committee of Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical
University. Tissue morphology was evaluated in haematoxylin and eosin-stained
sections by a qualified pathologist.
2.4 Immunohistochemical staining

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.047951; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

The selected tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution and embedded in
paraffin. The paraffin sections (4 µm in thickness) were deparaffinized in xylene,
rehydrated in a graded series of alcohol, then incubated in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5
min at 120°C, and the endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min.
Subsequently, they were dried and incubated anti-ACE2 (cat. no. ab15348 , Abcam,
Cambridge, CB, UK) antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody was added to the sections. Peroxidase activity was developed by
using DAB for 8 min and counterstained with hematoxylin. The expression levels of
ACE2 were evaluated by two experimenters. A qualified pathologist analyzed the
staining for structures positive for ACE2. The stain intensity of ACE2 and FURIN
was semiquantitatively graded according to the previous methods[22].
2.5 Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined with a one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni’s post-hoc test for multiple group comparisons or Student’s t-test for two
group comparisons. For all tests, p < 0.05 or < 0.01 was considered statistically
significant or very significant.
3 Results
3.1 Identification of cell types in the oral mucosal tissues
Given that SARS-CoV-2 invade host cells via ACE2 receptors, we detected the
ACE2-expressing cell types by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data. 1843
individual cells from the oral mucosa of five patients were analyzed. Using the
unsupervised graph-based clustering, we found that at least thirteen distinct cell
clusters existed in the oral tissues (Fig. 2A), including epithelial cells (clusters 1, 4, 5),
fibroblasts (clusters 0, 2, 7), T-cells (clusters 8, 9), B cells (cluster 12). The heatmap
of main corresponding cell marker gene expression profiles across the cell types can
be found in Fig. 2B. The marker gene of epithelial cells included KRT6B, GJB2, SFN,
and KRT14, fibroblasts included THY1, COL1A1, DCN, ACTA2, B cells included
SLAMF7, CD19, CD20 and CD79A and T-cells included CD2, CD3, CD45.
3.2 Identification of ACE2-expressing cells in the oral mucosa
As ACE2 had been proven to be one of the major receptors of COVID-2019 in
human body, we explored the online datasets to find out the expression level of ACE2
in oral mucosa. As expected, data from GEO indicated that ACE2 receptor expression

level was relatively higher in epithelial cells (cluster 1, 4, 5)(Fig. 3A, 3B), while very
little cellular expression of ACE2 was found in fibroblasts (cluster 2). Then we
calculated the percent of ACE2-expressing cells in the dataset (Fig. 3C). We find that,
in oral tissue, the percentage of ACE2-positive cells was 2.2%. Among them, 92%
were epithelial cells.
3.3 Identification of FURIN-expressing cells in the oral mucosa
It has been indicated that FURIN activity is essential for the transmission of SARSCoV-2. To determine the cell types of expressing FURIN, we analyzed the FURIN
mRNA expression using tSNE method. Violin and scatter plot showed that FURIN
was highly expressed in epithelial cells, follow by fibroblasts, T-cells, and endothelial
cells of the oral mucosal tissues, but hardly expressed in B cells (Fig. 4A, 4B).
Meanwhile, the proportion of FURIN-expression cells was approximately 10%.
Among them, epithelial cells make up more than 55% (Fig. 4C).
3.4 ACE2 protein was highly expressed in epithelial layer of the buccal mucosa,
lip, palate, tongue and gingiva
To further determine the protein expression level of ACE2 in the oral mucosa,
IHC experiments were performed. The first remarkable finding was that ACE2 was
present in epithelial cells in all the tissues studied (Fig. 5). Results indicated that the
expression level of ACE2 protein was significantly higher in the lip, tongue, and
buccal mucosa, especially the epithelial cells in the basal layer, although the mRNA
expression level is not as high (Fig. 3). The ACE2-postive cells in the gingival and
palate tissue were limited. The corresponding gingiva and palate epithelial cells
showed weak positive ACE2 staining. Also, we found that ACE2 expressed in
fibroblasts and endothelial cells. These results indicate that oral epithelial cells were
the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2.
3.5 FURIN protein was highly expressed in the normal oral mucosa
FURIN mRNA expression has been described mainly in oral epithelial cells
through scRNA-seq technique. To determine whether this differential expression of
FURIN was maintained at the protein level, oral tissues from different sites were
screened. As shown in Fig. 6, moderate to mild immunostaining in the cytoplasm of
epithelial cells can be seen in five normal oral tissues. Surprisingly, except for the
positive cells in the basal layer of oral epithelium, the spinous layer in all examined
tissues also turned out with large numbers of FURIN-positive cells. In addition, the
percentage of FURIN-positive cells in lip, tongue and gingiva was higher than that of

buccal and palate mucosa. These results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might be able to
infect oral tissues through the route of FURIN-mediated fusion with oral mucosal cell.
Discussion
The amazing spreading speed of SARS-CoV-2 and the large number of infected
people have quickly overwhelmed the public health services in the world, and have
become a global public health problem

[23]

. As mentioned before, ACE2 receptor in

cell membrane and FURIN clearage site of SARS-CoV-2 were the key factors that
allowed the virus to invade the host

[14, 15]

. Thus, clarifying the distribution of ACE2

and FURIN at the protein and gene levels in tissues is essential for understanding the
pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.
Many studies have shown that ACE2 receptor was highly expressed in
respiratory epithelium, kidney, cardiovascular system and testis

[24]

. Some scholars

also found that ACE2 was expressed in oral tissues with bulk RNA sequencing data,
which could not accurately reflect the expression of ACE2 on the single cell level [21,
25]

. Chen et al. benefited from the single-cell sequencing data to further proved the

expression of ACE2 receptor in tongue, buccal mucosa and gingiva

[11]

. However,

these studies were based on public databases and were not analyzed together, and
further validation of protein levels was lacking. In the current study, we firstly
characterized the ACE2 protein expression profiles in five different oral tissues
through immunohistochemical staining experiment. Results indicated that ACE2 was
mainly present in epithelial cells in all included tissues, especially in buccal mucosa,
lip and tongue. Previous study discovered the similar result[21]. Overall, these results
demonstrated that, compared with other oral sites, buccal mucosa, lip and tongue
might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, virologist Gary Whittaker of Cornell University, whose team
published another structural analysis of the coronavirus S protein on bioRxiv on
February 18th, argues that the FURIN cutting site allows the virus to enter cells in a
very different way than SARS, and this may affect the stability and spread of the virus
[26]

. Other research teams have also identified this activation site, suggesting that it

may enable the virus to spread effectively between humans[13]. It has been
demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could fuse with cell membrane and then entry into
the target cells[ 27 , 28 ]. Researchers have found FURIN proteases in many tissues,
including the lungs, liver, and small intestine

[29]

. However, limited reports were seen

regarding the expression of FURIN in oral cavity and whether the new coronavirus
could spread by oral cavity are not fully understood. Thus, we investigated the
FURIN enzyme in both gene and protein level from five different oral sites and the
results would be valuable for the prevention of the COVID-19 spreading.
Previous analysis about the SARS-CoV-2 receptor in the sing cell level were
based on the complete OSCC database named GS103322, which was significantly
different from the genetic profiles of normal oral tissues[30]. In order to accurately
analyzing the expression status of FURIN in the gene level, datasets from five OSCC
patients, which were graded as 1 and T1N0 stage were selected originated from the
online platform in the present research. The obtained single cell RNA-seq data were
processed and analyzed with R software. As expected, FURIN were found abundantly
enriched in oral mucosa cells, particularly in epithelial cells and the proportion of
FURIN-positive cells was higher than that of ACE2-positive cells.
Except for the expression profiles in the gene level, FURIN protein expression in
oral cavity was crucial for further clarifying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the mouth.
Previous reports had demonstrated that FURIN protein was expressed in
metastasizing OSCCs[31]. Besides, FURIN was expressed in normal epithelium and
up-regulated in SCCs from three different organs[22]. But the relative report of FURIN
protein expression in normal oral cavity was limited. For further validating the results
in the gene level, FURIN immunohistochemistry was therefore performed on
conventional sections for the first time to assess its expression in oral mucosa
obtained from five different sites. It is noteworthy that moderate positive expression
of FURIN protein were observed in tongue, giniva and lip, while weakly positive in
the buccal and palatal tissues. As a result, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could fuse
with the FURIN enzyme on the cell membrane the oral mucosal cells, then entry into
the host cells. Alternatively, FURIN could be recognised as the potential drug target
of suppressing the infection of new coronavirus.
Strikingly, the scRNA-Seq data analysis and IHC tests results indicated that
ACE2 and FURIN were both abundantly expressed in oral mucosa, especially on oral
epithelial cells, which were similar to the previous reports [32, 33, 34]. In other word, two
key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 entering the target cell in different routes were both
present in oral mucosa, which implied the potential attack and spread of SARS-CoV-2
in the oral tissues. Moreover, the live SARS-CoV-2 was consistently detected in the
self-collected saliva of 91.7% of patients till 11 days after hospitalization, and it could

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.047951; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

be transmitted via saliva, directly or indirectly, even among asymptomatic infected
patients[35]. Thus, it is suggested that all the healthcare workers should focus on taking
effective measures to prevent the virus from spreading via the oral cavity and
potential impairment of oral tissues should be evaluated after infected with SARSCoV-2, giving more evidence to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. We
should also pay close attention to protecting the oral tissues of all people, preventing
the virus from spreading through the mouth.
In the current study, we investigated the expression of other endopeptidases in
various oral mucosa cells using the public single-cell sequence datasets. As shown by
voilin plot in supplemental files, the high expression of ACE2 sheddase, ADAM17,
ADAM10 indicated the higher membrane fusion activity, virus uptake and virus
replication in the oral mucosa. Besides, the endopeptidases (such as CAPN1 and
CAPNS1) were abundantly enriched in the oral mucosal cells. Large proportion of
endopeptidases positive cells in the different oral sites provided opportunities for
SARS-CoV-2 infection and rapid replication in the oral cavity [15]. These results were
in accordance with the previous study, which indicated the residence of SARS-CoV-2
in nasal and throats swab samples, suggesting the strong spread ability in oral cavity
[36]

.
In conclusion, our results systematicly investigated the expression profiles of

FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor in oral cavity at the gene and protein level for the
first time. Furthermore, significant expression of FURIN and ACE2 were discovered
in oral epithelial cells, implying the possible two transmission routes of the
coronavirus through oral mucosa, which provides a new insight to the future
prevention strategy in clinical cares as well as daily life. More evidence is still needed
to reinforce these findings.
