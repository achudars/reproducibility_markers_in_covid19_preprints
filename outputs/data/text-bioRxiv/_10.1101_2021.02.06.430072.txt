Abstract

24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with amino-

25

acid substitutions and deletions in spike protein (S) can reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal

26

antibodies (mAbs) and may compromise immunity induced by vaccines. We report a polyclonal,

27

fully human, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin produced in transchromosomic bovines (Tc-

28

hIgG-SARS-CoV-2) hyperimmunized with two doses of plasmid DNA encoding the SARS-CoV-

29

2 Wuhan strain S gene, followed by repeated immunization with S protein purified from insect

30

cells. The resulting Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2, termed SAB-185, efficiently neutralizes SARS-CoV-

31

2, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) SARS-CoV-2 chimeras in vitro. Neutralization potency

32

was retained for S variants including S477N, E484K, and N501Y, substitutions present in recent

33

variants of concern. In contrast to the ease of selection of escape variants with mAbs and

34

convalescent human plasma, we were unable to isolate VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutants resistant to

35

Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. This fully human immunoglobulin that potently inhibits

36

SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide an effective therapeutic to combat COVID-19.

Introduction

41

Ending the global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

42

(SARS-CoV-2) requires the deployment of multiple countermeasures including therapeutics and

43

vaccines. Emergency use authorization (EUA) has already been granted by the United States

44

Food and Drug Administration for vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and convalescent

45

plasma (Baden et al., 2021; Bloch et al., 2020; Graham, 2020; Group et al., 2020; Halfmann et

46

al., 2020; Krammer, 2020; Polack et al., 2020; Weinreich et al., 2020). A shared feature of those

47

countermeasures are neutralizing antibodies that target the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2.

48

The S protein is responsible for engaging the viral receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2

49

(ACE2), and catalyzes fusion of the viral and host cell membranes initiating the process of

50

infection (Letko et al., 2020). Genomic analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has

51

identified mutations in S including E484K that blunt the ability of multiple mAbs and

52

convalescent plasma to neutralize virus in cell culture based assays (Allison J. Greaney, 2021;

53

Baum et al., 2020; Greaney et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020; Z Liu., 2021). Substitutions

54

N501Y (B.1.1.7) and E484K-N501Y (B.1.351) are present among variants of concern which also

55

possess other mutations in the spike gene and elsewhere in the viral genome (C Rees-Spear,

56

2021; Hou et al., 2020; Naveca F, 2021; Rambaut A, 2020; Tegally et al., 2020). To date, sera

57

from vaccinated individuals neutralize the new variants in cell culture assays with some loss of

58

potency. The impact of S mutations on the efficacy of therapeutic mAbs and convalescent

59

plasma warrants the development of additional countermeasures (C K Wibmer, 2021; P Wang.,

60

2021; Z Wang, 2021).

61

Genetically modified transchromosomic bovines (Tc-bovines) adaptively produce fully

62

human polyclonal antibodies after exposure to environmental or vaccine antigens (Kuroiwa et

63

al., 2009; Luke et al., 2018; Luke et al., 2016; Matsushita et al., 2014). After hyperimmunization,

64

Tc-bovines produce high titer, fully human IgG (Tc-hIgG) that can be rapidly produced from their

65

plasma (Kuroiwa et al., 2009; Luke et al., 2018; Luke et al., 2016; Matsushita et al., 2015). Tc-

66

hIgGs have shown pre-clinical efficacy against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

67

(MERS-CoV), Hantaan, Ebola and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis viruses among others

68

(Casey C. Perley et al., 2020; Gardner et al., 2017; Luke et al., 2018; Luke et al., 2016).

69

Previous randomized, double blind, Phase 1 or 1b clinical trials against MERS-CoV and

70

mycoplasma hominis (ClinicalTrials.gov nos., NCT02788188 and NCT02508584 respectively)

71

found Tc-hIgG to be safe, well tolerated and non-immunogenic (Beigel et al., 2018; Silver, et al.,

72

2018).

73

Here we used a fully-human, polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin Tc-hIgG-

74

SARS-CoV-2, termed SAB-185, produced from Tc bovines hyperimmunized with two doses of

75

plasmid DNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain Spike (S) gene (Wu et al., 2020),

76

followed by repeated doses of recombinant S protein. Evaluation of SAB-185 in a Phase 1

77

(healthy adult) and Phase 1b (non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected) clinical trial

78

(ClinicalTrials.gov nos., NCT04468958 and NCT0446917 respectively) revealed SAB-185 to be

79

safe and well tolerated (manuscript in preparation). Distinct mutants to the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus

80

strain, such as the D614G strain, and three newer mutants from the United Kingdom, South

81

Africa and Brazil, have arisen (C K Wibmer, 2021; Hou et al., 2020; Naveca F, 2021; Rambaut

82

A, 2020; Tegally et al., 2020). We therefore tested the ability of this Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2 to

83

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (D614G variant) and several VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses in

84

vitro. We demonstrate that SAB-185 retains potent neutralizing activity against the D614G,

85

S477N, E484K, and N501Y S protein substitutions in cell culture based assays and were unable

86

to isolate escape variants. This finding contrasts with the ability to isolate escape variants with

87

convalescent human plasma and several neutralizing mAbs.

Results

90

Production of polyclonal human IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike in transchromosomic

91

bovines

92

To generate anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal human immunoglobulin, we primed

93

bovines with a DNA encoding the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain Spike (S) gene (Wu et al., 2020) for the

94

first vaccination (V1) and the second vaccination (V2) at a 3-week interval, followed by 3

95

subsequent boosts with recombinant spike ectodomain produced and purified from insect cells

96

for the third vaccination (V3) to the fifth vaccination (V5) at a 4-week interval (Figure 1A).

97

Plasma was collected at 8, 11 and 14 days post V3 to V5 boosts and subjected to cGMP IgG

98

purification to produce SAB-185 (Figure 1A). We selected multiple lots of SAB-185 for further

99

analysis: Lot 1 obtained from V3 plasma, Lot 5 from V4 plasma, and Lot 6 from pooled V3, V4

100

and V5 plasma. The titers of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG titers for each lot were evaluated

101

by ELISA compared to human IgG purified Tc bovine pre-immune plasma as a negative control

102

(Figure 1B). As expected, the neutralization titers increased with extent of immunization, with

103

Lot 5 and Lot 6 having higher titer than Lot 1.

Effect of Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2 on neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

Tc-

105

To examine whether this purified polyclonal human IgG could neutralize SARS-CoV-2,

106

we performed a plaque reduction neutralization test assay using SARS-CoV-2 with the D614G

107

(Munich strain) S substitution. The neutralization potency of Lot 1, 5 and 6 increased (Figure

108

1C). Similar results were obtained from a neutralization assay using a chimeric VSV-SARS-

109

CoV-2 (Case et al., 2020) (Figure 2A). For VSV-SARS-CoV-2 we obtained IC50 of 4730 ng ml-1

110

with Lot 1, 650 ng ml-1 for Lot 5 and 212 ng ml-1 for Lot 6 corresponding to their levels of SARS-

111

CoV-2 specific IgG. The IC50 values for virus neutralization compare favorably to those of

112

potently neutralizing mAbs including 2H04 (Figure 2A).

113

We previously selected >50 mutants in SARS-CoV-2 spike that exhibit resistance to

114

specific monoclonal antibodies (Z Liu., 2021). Among those mutants were S477N and E484K

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.06.430072; this version posted February 7, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

115

which exhibit resistance to multiple mAbs and are present in emerging variants of concern. We

116

also generated the dominant D614G, and the mouse adapted N501Y (Gu et al., 2020; Hou et

117

al., 2020) and E484K-N501Yvariants. To determine whether the potency of SAB-185 was

118

altered by any of these individual amino acid substitutions we performed neutralization assays

119

with the corresponding chimeric VSV (Figure 2B). Each mutant exhibits a dose-dependent

120

inhibition of infection by Lots 1, 5 and 6 of SAB-185, at levels that were similar to wild type S.

121

We therefore tested whether the Tc-hIgG-SARS-CoV-2 also retains potency against a

122

combination of substitutions E484K-N501Y in S. The resulting chimeric virus was also potently

123

neutralized by SAB-185 with IC50 values of 9744 ng ml-1, 1508 ng ml-1 and 468 ng ml-1 for Lots

124

1, 5, and 6 (Figure 2C). This data demonstrates that SAB-185 retains neutralizing potency

125

against multiple substitutions in S in chimeric VSV cell culture assays including several present

126

in circulating human variants of SARS-CoV-2.

127

Selections for resistance mutations using chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2

128

We and others have previously isolated VSV-SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutants by selection

129

using mAbs and human convalescent serum that are resistant to neutralization (Baum et al.,

130

2020; Weisblum et al., 2020; Z Liu., 2021). We therefore applied the same approach in an

131

attempt to isolate variants resistant to SAB-185. In contrast to the ability to readily isolate mAb

132

and convalescent serum escape mutants, we were unable to isolate mutants resistant to the

133

human immunoglobulin SAB-185 from 3 successive attempts at sub-neutralizing concentrations

134

of SAB-185 (Figure 3). Taken together, this analysis suggests that SAB-185 poses a significant

135

barrier to immune escape.

Discussion

138

We report a potently neutralizing polyclonal human IgG produced in transchromosomic

139

bovines that effectively neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeras that contain

140

one or two S mutations present in circulating variants of concern (Greaney et al., 2020; Li et al.,

141

2020; Weisblum et al., 2020; Z Liu., 2021). This finding contrasts with earlier work which shows

142

that immune sera obtained from patients that have recovered from COVID-19 as well as several

143

mAbs show significant reductions in neutralization potency in cell culture assays particularly

144

against S substitutions E484K and S477N. The potency seen for SAB-185 with the combination

145

of E484K and N501Y likely reflects the fact that the hyperimmune IgG SAB-185 recognizes a

146

broader swath of epitopes in S such that single substitutions are unlikely to escape

147

neutralization. As a result, large scale antigenic variation that results in the appearance of new

148

serotypes may be required to evade neutralization by such a polyclonal human IgG.

149

The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in humans and other species will continue

150

to pose a threat to human health particularly if sufficient antigenic variation is achieved to blunt

151

vaccine induced immunity (Dinnon et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020; Halfmann et al., 2020; Oude

152

Munnink et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). It seems likely, however, that pre-existing immunity

153

developed as a consequence of natural infection or through vaccination may offer some

154

protection from disease. The present study evaluated the ability of the polyclonal IgG SAB-185

155

to neutralize virus in cell culture assays, and how this impacts disease outcome will require

156

studies in vivo. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies can offer

157

protection of animals from infection by SARS-CoV-2 in experimental models of disease (Winkler

158

et al., 2020). The extent to which natural infection or vaccination induces non-neutralizing but

159

protective antibodies is uncertain. Both vaccination and natural infection will also stimulate a T-

160

cell response that also contributes to immunity (Lu et al., 2018).

161

Production of human IgG by transchromosomic cattle has been described for multiple

162

emerging viruses, including Ebola, Hantaan, and MERS CoV (Casey C. Perley et al., 2020;

163

Luke et al., 2018; Luke et al., 2016), demonstrating that it provides a versatile platform for

164

development of immunotherapeutics. Identification of the key antigenic determinants is critical,

165

but in the case of enveloped viruses their surface proteins are typically effective targets. Using

166

nucleic acid as the immunogen also limits the need for production of recombinant protein or

167

vectored vaccine approaches that may pose unexpected challenges toward developing human

168

IgG. Here we used recombinant S produced in insect cells to boost the immune response

169

following priming with nucleic acid. Although there are differences in glycosylation in insect cells,

170

the recombinant protein effectively boosted neutralizing IgG titers as demonstrated by the

171

increased potency of Lot 6 and 5 over Lot 1. In phase 1 clinical trials, SAB-185 was shown to be

172

safe and well tolerated and given its potent neutralization efficacy in vitro, use of SAB-185 may

173

provide a useful addition to the evolving repertoire of countermeasures against COVID-19.

IGHM − / − IGHML1 − / − IGL − / − /IGK− / −) and carry a human artificial chromosome (HAC)

264

vector labeled as isKcHACD with an IgG1 production bias. This HAC vector consists of human

265

chromosome 14 fragment, which contains the entire human immunoglobulin heavy chain locus

266

except that the IGHM constant region remains bovine and the key regulatory sequences were

267

bovinized; and human chromosome 2 fragment, which contains the entire human

268

immunoglobulin k light chain locus (Kuroiwa et al., 2009).

269

Generation of pCAGGS and Spike fusion protein for Tc Bovine immunization

270

A plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and a purified Spike fusion protein were

271

generated for use as antigens to stimulate production of human polyclonal antibodies using the

272

Tc bovine platform. The pCAGGS expression plasmid, provided by Florian Krammer from Icahn

273

School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, contains the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence encoding

274

the full-length Spike protein. Expression of the spike gene is regulated by the CMV promoter.

275

Plasmid DNA was generated using the Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Giga Kit. To produce purified

276

Spike protein, the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD) was

277

used to make the antigen in the insect cell line, ExpiSf9, according to manufacturer’s

278

instructions. Briefly, the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence encoding the ectodomain of Spike

279

(amino acids 1-1213) was cloned into pFastBAC1 3’ of the polyhedrin promoter with the

280

following modifications. The furin cleavage site, RRAR (residues 682-685), was changed to

281

GSAS. Substitutions K986P and V987P were added to stabilize the C-terminal S2 fusion

282

machinery. The sequence encoding the 27 amino acid T4 foldon trimerization domain(Guthe et

283

al., 2004) was cloned 3’ of the ectodomain. Linker sequences were added 5’ and 3’ of the

284

encoded TEV protease recognition site, ENLYFQG, followed by six histidines. The sequence

285

was codon optimized for insect expression systems, and the final plasmid is referred to as

286

pSAB-uSpike. The pSAB-uSpike was transformed into competent DH10Bac E. coli containing a

287

bacmid and helper vector to generate a recombinant bacmid. The purified uSpike bacmid was

288

transfected into ExpiSf9 cells to produce P0 recombinant baculovirus stock. After viral

289

amplification and titer determination, ExpiSf9 cells were infected with an MOI of 5. ExpiSF9 cells

290

were grown at 27°C in a non-humidified and non-CO2 atmosphere incubator on an orbital

291

shaker platform set at 125 ±5 rpm. After 96-120 hours, supernatants were harvested, and the

292

purification procedures were performed at 4°C. His-tagged uSpike was purified using Ni-NTA

293

agarose (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) in a gravity flow column. After washing and elution from

294

the Ni-column, the imidazole was removed by Amicon centrifugal filters (Sigma Aldrich, St.

295

Louis, MO). The his-tag was cleaved using AcTEV protease according to manufacturer’s

296

instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the his-tagged protease and noncleaved uSpike

297

protein were removed by binding to Ni-NTA resin. The purified uSpike antigen was buffer

298

exchanged into PBS, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay.

299

Tc bovine immunization and plasma collection

300

A group of Tc bovines were primed with SARS CoV2 12 mg pDNA along with SAB’s proprietary

301

adjuvant formulation (SAB-adj-1) for the first vaccination (V1) and the second vaccination (V2)

302

at three weeks interval, and then boosted with 2 to 5mg recombinant ectodomain of spike

303

protein formulated with SAB-adi-1 for third vaccination (V3) to Fifth vaccination (V5) at 4-week

304

intervals. pDNA was delivered by by using the PharmaJet Stratis® IM injection device as

305

previously described (Hooper et al., 2014). Up to 2.1% of body weight of hyperimmune plasma

306

per animal was collected from immunized Tc bovines on days 8, 11 and 14 after each

307

vaccination starting fromV3–V5. Plasma was collected using an automated plasmapheresis

308

system (Baxter Healthcare, Autopheresis C Model 200). Plasma samples were stored frozen at

309

-20°C until purifications were performed.

310

SAB-185 cGMP Purification

311

After quality control testing, the qualified Tc bovine plasma was thawed, pooled, fractionated by

312

caprylic acid (CA), and clarified by depth filtration in the presence of Celpure P1000 filter aid.

313

The clarified sample containing Tc bovine-derived human IgG is further purified by affinity

314

chromatography, first using an anti-human IgG kappa light chain specific column, KappaSelect

315

(GE Healthcare Life Sciences) to capture hIgG and remove residual non-hIgG and bovine

316

plasma proteins (BPP) followed by a low pH treatment, and, second, by passing through an

317

anti-bovine IgG heavy chain specific affinity column, Capto HC15 (GE Healthcare Life

318

Sciences). To further remove residual IgG that contains bovine heavy chain, the human IgG

319

fraction was then subjected to a Q Sepharose chromatography polishing step to further reduce

320

impurities, nanofiltration, final buffer exchange, concentration and sterile filtration. Finally, the

321

SAB-185 product was terminally filtered and filled into vials. The product protein concentration

322

was determined by A280 using the Unchained Labs Big Lunatic. The product SAB-185 was in a

323

buffer at a pH of 5.5 consisting of 10 mM of glutamic acid monosodium salt, 262 mM of d-

324

sorbitol, and 0.05 mg/mL of Tween 80. After quality control testing and quality assurance

325

review, SAB-185 was released for preclinical and/or clinical studies. SAB-185 Lot 1 and Lot 5

326

were purified from pooled V3 plasma and V4 plasma, respectively. SAB-185 Lot 6 was purified

327

from pooled V3, V4 and V5 plasma. The protein concentration for each lot of SAB-185 was as

328

follows: Lot 1 at 75.48mg ml-1, Lot 5 at 73.01mg ml-1 and Lot 6 at 75.69mg ml-1.

329

SARS CoV-2 spike-protein-specific human IgG ELISA

330

In this ELISA assays, recombinant ectodomain of SARS CoV-2 spike protein produced and

331

purified from 293 cells was used as the coating antigen. Determination of SARS CoV-2 spike

332

protein-specific human IgG antibody titers was performed in Maxisorp Immuno 96-well ELISA

333

plates (Thermo Scientific) coated overnight at 4°C with 100 μl/well of 2 μg ml-1 recombinant

334

SARS CoV-2 spike protein produced and purified from 293 cells in PBS. Plates were washed

335

with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked at RT for 1 hour with 1% bovine serum

336

albumin in PBS. After washing with PBST, SAB-185 Lot1, 5 and 6 were serially diluted in PBST,

337

added to the plates, and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Following washing with PBST, diluted goat

338

anti-human IgG-Fc conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Bethyl) was added to plates

339

and incubated for 1 hour at RT. After final washing with PBST, the bound anti-spike antibodies

340

were detected colorimetrically by using the 3, 3,’ 5, 5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate kit

(SeraCare). Absorbance was read in a microplate reader at 450 nm. The titer (units/ml) is

342

defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of SAB-185 resulting in an optical density at 450

343

nm (OD450) reading that was 2.5-fold higher than blank.

344

Plaque Reduction Neutralization Assay and plaque assay

345

Virus production and neutralization of a low passage strain of SARS-CoV-2 were as described

346

as previously (Klimstra WB, 2020). Virus growth and assays were performed at Biosafety Level

347

(BSL) 3 BSL-3 conditions in the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) in the Center from

348

Vaccine Research, at the University of Pittsburgh. Briefly, approximately 100 plaque forming

349

units of SARS-CoV-2 were mixed with serial 10-fold dilutions of SAb-185, beginning with a 1:20

350

dilution, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour followed by infection of two wells of a six-well plate of

351

Vero E6 cells. Infection proceeded for 1 hour at 37°C followed by overlay with virus growth

352

medium containing 0.1% (w/v) immunodiffusion agarose (MP Biomedicals) and incubation was

353

continued for 96 hours. Plates were fixed with formaldehyde (37% (w/v) formaldehyde stabilized

354

with 10-15% (v/v) methanol; Fisher Scientific) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Agarose and

355

fixative were discarded and 1 ml/well 1% (w/v) crystal violet in 10% (v/v) methanol (both Fisher

356

Scientific) was added followed by enumeration of plaques.

357

performed in triplicate (6 total wells) and values averaged and then 1/10 of the reciprocal of the

358

highest dilution at which 80% of control plate plaques were neutralized was taken as the

359

PRNT80 value. VSV-SARS-CoV-2 plaque assays were performed on Vero and Vero E6-

360

TMPRSS2 cells. Briefly, cells were seeded into 6 well plates for overnight. Virus was serially

361

diluted using DMEM and cells were infected at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were cultured with an agarose

362

overlay in the presence of Ab or absence of Ab at 34°C for 2 days. The concentration of SAB-

363

185 pAbs added in the overlay completely inhibited viral infection. Plates were scanned on a

364

biomolecular imager and expression of eGFP is show at 48 hours post-infection.

eight dilutions. Indicated dilutions of SAB-185 pAbs were incubated with 102 PFU of VSV-SARS-

368

CoV-2 and mutants for 1 h at 37 °C. SAB-185 pAb-virus complexes then were added to Vero E6

369

cells in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 7.5 h. Cells were fixed at room temperature in

370

2% formaldehyde containing 10 µg/mL of Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain for 45 min. Fixative was

371

replaced with PBS prior to imaging. Images were acquired using an In Cell 2000 Analyzer

372

automated microscope (GE Healthcare) in both the DAPI and FITC channels to visualize nuclei

373

and infected cells (×4 objective, 4 fields per well). Images were analyzed using the Multi Target

374

Analysis Module of the In Cell Analyzer 1000 Workstation Software (GE Healthcare). GFP-

375

positive cells were identified using the top hat segmentation method and counted within the

376

InCell Workstation software.
