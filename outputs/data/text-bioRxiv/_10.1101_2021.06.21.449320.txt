Abstract

12

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-

13

CoV-2) has emphasized the serious threat to human health posed by emerging coronaviruses.

14

Effective antiviral countermeasures are urgently needed as vaccine development against an

15

emerging coronavirus takes time, even in the best-case scenario. The green tea catechin,

16

epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has broad spectrum antiviral activity. We demonstrate here that

17

EGCG prevents murine and human coronavirus infection and blocks the entry of lentiviral particles

18

pseudotyped with spike proteins from bat or highly pathogenic coronaviruses. We show that

19

EGCG treatment reduces coronavirus attachment to target cell surfaces. Our results demonstrate

20

the potential for the development of pan-coronavirus attachment inhibitors.

Introduction

25

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected hundreds

26

of millions of people and has resulted in millions of deaths around the world. The COVID-19

27

pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, underscores the severe health threat posed by emerging

28

coronaviruses (CoVs), and makes evident the paucity of antivirals with extended spectrums of

29

activity. SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic CoV to emerge in the 21st century. The

30

abundance and diversity of SARS-related CoVs in bats points to the likelihood of future spillover

31

into human populations [1]. In addition, seasonally circulating common cold CoVs continually

32

burden human health [2], and cause severe disease in elderly populations [3,4], without effective

33

preventative or therapeutic strategies. In order to develop inhibitors that are effective against such

34

a broad range of endemic, pandemic, and emerging CoVs, a conserved step of viral infection needs

35

to be targeted.

36

Most human viruses, including CoVs, initiate primary attachment to cell surfaces through

37

low-affinity but high-avidity interactions with glycans. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are

38

necessary attachment receptors for the human alphacoronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [5], as well

39

as many other human viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) [6,7], hepatitis C virus (HCV)

40

[8,9] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10]. Recently, heparan sulfate has also been

41

identified as a necessary co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection [11,12]. Alternatively, other viruses,

42

including influenza A virus (IAV) and betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 require

43

sialic acid-containing glycans for attachment and entry [13–15]. Regardless of the glycan subtype,

44

glycan binding is critical to the primary attachment of many different viruses, facilitating their

45

specific high-affinity interaction with less abundant protein receptors, such as ACE2 for HCoV-

46

NL63, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [16,17]. For some viruses, like IAV, glycans serve as the

47

only known entry receptor.

48

Blocking viral attachment to cellular glycans is a demonstrated approach to inhibit diverse

49

viral infections. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most bioactive polyphenolic compound

50

from green tea with antiviral activity against diverse DNA and RNA viruses, including HSV-1,

51

HCV, and IAV [18]. The broad antiviral spectrum of EGCG has been attributed to its ability to

52

inhibit the primary attachment of unrelated viruses by competing with both heparan sulfate and

53

sialic acid for virion binding [19]. However, whether EGCG inhibits coronavirus infection by

54

similar mechanisms remains unknown.

55

Here, we show that EGCG inhibits infectivity of murine, bat, and human CoVs. Cell

56

surface binding of multiple human CoVs is blocked by EGCG, suggesting that this natural product

57

inhibits a conserved step in CoV attachment, such as initial binding to glycans. These findings

58

demonstrate that blocking primary attachment is a potential antiviral strategy to prevent infection

59

by diverse CoVs.

183

virions were treated with DMSO or varying concentrations of EGCG for 10 min at 37°C and used

184

to inoculate infection-susceptible human hepatoma Huh7 or human lung epithelial A549 cell

185

monolayers. After 2 h of infection, inocula were removed and cells were overlaid with plaquing

186

media. Infectivity was assessed by plaquing efficiency on Huh7 for HCoV-229E or by

187

immunofluorescence focus-forming assay on Huh7 and A549 cells for HCoV-OC43. EGCG

188

inhibited infectivity of HCoV-229E (IC50 = 0.77 µM) and HCoV-OC43 (IC50 = 0.49-0.56 µM) at

189

sub- to low micromolar concentrations (Figure 1A), similar to other viruses highly susceptible to

190

inhibition by EGCG, such as HSV-1 [19]. We next tested the inhibitory activity of EGCG against

191

a murine CoV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), on murine fibroblast L929 cell monolayers.

192

We observed that EGCG inhibited MHV-A59 infection with similar potency as for the human

193

common cold CoVs (IC50 = 0.71 µM) (Figure 1B) and inhibited the formation of syncytia (Figure

194

1C). Consistent with previous reports, we found EGCG to have minimal effect on cell viability at

195

the low micromolar range in which antiviral activity is exerted (Figure 1D).

196
197

Entry of highly pathogenic coronaviruses is blocked by EGCG.

198

We produced luciferase-encoding lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-1, SARS-

199

CoV-2 and MERS-CoV spike (S) proteins to investigate the effect of EGCG on entry of highly

200

pathogenic coronaviruses. We also generated lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the spike

201

protein of WIV1-CoV, a bat coronavirus that binds to human ACE2 [23]. Huh7 cells were

202

inoculated with CoV S pseudoparticles pre-exposed to EGCG or DMSO for 10 min at 37°C.

203

Inocula were removed after 2 h and replaced with fresh DMEM. After 72 h, cells were lysed and

204

luminescence was measured. EGCG inhibited SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and

205

WIV1-CoV pseudoparticle entry with IC50 of 2.5, 48.6, 13.7 and 3.8 µM, respectively (Figure

expressing human ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and isolated a clone

208

with high levels of ACE2 expression and enhanced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 S

pseudoparticle infection (Supplemental Figure 1). We found that EGCG also inhibited entry of

210

SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and WIV1-CoV pseudoparticles into A549-ACE2 B9 cells, with

211

IC50 of 15.9, 24.0 and 24.5 µM, respectively (Figure 2A).

CoV-2) [21]. Huh7, A549-ACE2, and lung epithelial Calu-3 cells were infected with EGCG-

225

treated VSV-SARS-CoV-2 virions (MOI of 5). Infected cells were imaged by fluorescence

226

microscopy after 24 h. Similar to the pseudoparticle assays, EGCG inhibited VSV-SARS-CoV-2

227

S infection with IC50 ranging from 11.45 to 15.40 µM, depending on the cell type (Figure 2B),

228

with minimal cytotoxicity up to 100 µM (Supplemental Figure 2). We next evaluated whether

229

the effect of EGCG was dependent on MOI. Using the same assay, but with MOI of 0.5, we found

230

that EGCG inhibited VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC50 ranging from 0.14 to 1.13 µM. These

231

findings demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of EGCG depends on the MOI (Figure 2B),

232

consistent with the virions as the proposed target of EGCG [19]. This also provides a potential

233

explanation for the difference in IC50 for authentic viruses investigated at low MOI (<0.001)

234

(Figure 1A-B) compared to lentiviral pseudoparticles (Figure 2A), for which p24 ELISA data for

235

lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike in our laboratory provide an estimate of

236

approximately 1.7 x 106 transducing units per mL, resulting in an apparent MOI of 3.4.

237
238

EGCG acts on virions to inhibit coronavirus binding to cell surfaces.

239

To confirm that EGCG acts on CoV virions, and not on cells, we performed time-of-addition

240

experiments. Cells were pre-treated with EGCG or DMSO 1 h at 37°C, at which point media was

241

removed and cells were infected with HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43. Infectivity was determined by

242

plaque assay or immunostaining. Alternatively, cells were infected, and EGCG- or DMSO-

243

containing medium was added 2 h post-infection. In either condition, no inhibition of infectivity

244

was observed until the highest concentration of 100 µM EGCG (Figure 3A). To test if EGCG

245

bound virions were quantified by RT-qPCR (Supplemental Figure 3). Pre-chilled Huh7 or Calu-

248

3 cells were inoculated with HCoV-OC43 or VSV-SARS-CoV-2 treated with DMSO, 10 µM

249

EGCG, or 20 µg/mL heparin, as a control attachment inhibitor [11]. As expected, heparin partially

250

blocked VSV-SARS-CoV-2 binding. We also observed that heparin reduced HCoV-OC43

251

binding, which unlike other coronavirus does not have a known protein receptor but depends on

252

sialic acid, and, as recently reported, glycosaminoglycans for entry [24]. EGCG similarly reduced

253

VSV-SARS-CoV-2 binding to Huh7 and Calu-3 cells (Figure 3B-C).

Discussion

276

Green tea catechins, especially EGCG, exert antiviral effects against diverse viruses. We show that

277

EGCG broadly inhibits CoV infections, and that its activity is due, at least in part, to blocking CoV

278

attachment to target cells. Infection by authentic murine and human CoVs, as well as entry of

279

lentivirus particles pseudotyped with spike proteins of highly pathogenic or potentially emerging

280

CoVs [23], was inhibited by EGCG treatment. Interestingly, EGCG was recently shown to

281

significantly inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and time-of-addition experiments suggested

282

that EGCG at least partially blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry [25], consistent with our findings. In this

283

study, we expand the scope of EGCG activity to other CoVs, including murine and bat CoVs, and

284

demonstrate the physiological relevance of the inhibitory activity of EGCG on CoV attachment

285

and infection of lung epithelial cells.

286

A variety of mechanisms for the antiviral activity of EGCG have previously been

287

described. EGCG inhibits the primary attachment of diverse viruses including VSV, IAV, HCV,

288

HSV-1 and vaccinia virus [19]. EGCG is proposed to act directly on HCV virions to block

289

attachment in a genotype independent manner, with no alteration in HCV (co)-receptor expression

290

nor any effect on viral replication, assembly, or release [26,27]. As for HBV, EGCG may inhibit

291

entry [28], as well as replication, with proposed roles in impairing HBV replicative intermediates

292

during DNA synthesis [29], diminishing the transcriptional activation of the HBV core promoter

293

[30], and enhancing lysosomal acidification to adversely affect HBV replication [31].

294

Alternatively, EGCG is suggested to prevent the binding of HIV glycoprotein 120 to its receptor

295

molecule CD4 on cells [32], and to act as an HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor [33]. Finally,

296

recent studies have identified in vitro inhibitory effects of EGCG against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-

297

like protease [34–37]. However, our time-of-addition experiments with HCoV-229E and HCoV-

298

OC43, as well as those of others with SARS-CoV-2 [25], strongly suggest that EGCG

299

predominantly inhibits authentic CoV infection by blocking entry, although other activities might

300

be exerted at higher concentrations. Furthermore, we show that EGCG reduces cell surface binding

301

of HCoV-OC43 and VSV-SARS-CoV-2, in a similar manner to heparin, which has been

302

demonstrated to competitively block virion attachment [11].

303

While COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment are ongoing, extensive efforts are

304

underway to identify antibodies, peptides, and small molecules to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry [38].

305

To protect against emerging CoVs, the identification of broad-spectrum entry inhibitors is a

306

priority. Recently, lactoferrins have been described to disrupt CoV primary attachment, mediated

307

by heparan sulfate interactions, conferring antiviral activity against multiple CoVs in vitro,

308

demonstrating the potential for a pan-coronavirus inhibitor [39]. Small molecules continue to be

309

preferred as drugs in general due to superior pharmacokinetic properties and simpler synthesis

310

[40]. As with other green tea catechins, EGCG does not accumulate at high levels, is unstable

311

under physiological conditions, and is rapidly metabolized [41–43]. However, the observation that

312

a small molecule exerts pan-coronavirus activity provides the basis for the development of entry

313

inhibitors that could provide an effective antiviral strategy to protect against future emerging CoV

314

infections.
