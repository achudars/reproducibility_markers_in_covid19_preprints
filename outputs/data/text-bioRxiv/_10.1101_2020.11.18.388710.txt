Abstract

27

The current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented medical and

28

socioeconomic crisis. Highly efficient treatment options preventing morbidity and mortality

29

are not broadly available and approved drugs are hardly affordable in developing countries.

30

Even after vaccine approvals, it will take several months until the vaccinated and

31

convalescent

32

interventions and antiviral treatments are indispensable to curb the death toll of the pandemic.

33

To identify cost-effective and ubiquitously available options, we tested common herbs

34

consumed worldwide as herbal teas. We found that aqueous infusions prepared by boiling

35

leaves of the Lamiaceae plants perilla and sage elicit potent antiviral activity against SARS-

36

CoV-2 in human cells. Sustained antiviral activity was evident even when cells were treated

37

for only half an hour, and in therapeutic as well as prophylactic regimens. Given the urgency,

38

such inexpensive and broadly available substances might provide help during the pandemic -

Introduction

46

Fossil records suggest that humans may have applied plants as medicine at least from the

47

Middle Palaeolithic age some 60,000 years ago 1,2. Across cultures and spanning thousands of

48

years, humans consumed aqueous plant infusions as teas. The first textual reference to tea

49

consumption dates back to 59 years before the current era (BCE) and physical evidence even

50

dates back to 255±80 years BCE 3. In addition to reasons of enjoyment and taste, teas are

51

frequently applied for disease prophylaxis, therapy, or symptom allevation. A major

52

distinction is genuine teas based on Camellia sinensis infusions versus various types of herbal

53

teas. For the latter, parts of other plants are boiled in water generating complex aqueous

54

solutions. Especially members of the Lamiaceae family comprising plants such as sage

55

(Salvia officinalis) and perilla (Perilla frutescens) are ubiquitously used to prepare herbal teas.

56

Additionally, important aromatic spices such as basil, mint, rosemary, marjoram, oregano,

57

thyme, and lavender also belong to the family of Lamiaceae. Across the world, the edible

58

plant perilla and its variations have a variety of names such as Tía tô (Vietnam), rattlesnake

59

weed (US), silam (India and Nepal), Korean perilla, shiso and egoma (Japan), deulkkae

60

(Korea), zĭsū and sūzǐ (China). In parts of Japan, it is referred to as jūnen (‘ten years’) since it

61

is believed to be able to add ten years to a person's lifespan. In addition to the consumption in

62

herbal teas, certain perilla varieties are used either as spices or in traditional medicine in

63

Southeast Asia. Members of the Lamiaceae family are well described for their medicinal

64

effects against various diseases including pneumonia and cough 4. While perilla is very

65

popular in Asia, the related plant sage is more common in Europe and America. The name

66

Salvia officinalis already indicates its medicinal potential since the officinal was a room in a

67

monastery dedicated to herbs and medicine. Sage was also included in the so-called four

68

thieves vinegar which was used in medieval times in attempts to protect users from the

69

plaque. Intriguingly, perilla and sage extracts indeed possess antimicrobial activities (see, e.g.

70

5,6

71

In the era of modern medicine, some people have reservations concerning the use of

72

traditional and herbal medicines. However, a highly relevant fraction of recently approved

73

modern therapeutics directly or indirectly originate from natural products

74

known to and applied by our ancestors. In this respect, the antimalarial lactone Artemisinin

75

derived from the sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) is amongst the best-known examples

the capacity of very efficient replication in the upper respiratory tract and the corresponding

85

efficacy of human-to-human transmission. Given the broad coverage of this topic, we refer

86

the reader to review articles concerning SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 (e.g., 13,14). At the time

87

of writing, more than 55.7 million individuals experienced laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-

92

A variety of SARS-CoV-like viruses can be found in bats, indicating an alarming reservoir of

93

coronaviruses that could cause zoonotic animal-to-human spillover transmissions

94

on the facts that CoVs are present in animals such as rodents, bats, and cats residing in utmost

95

proximity of human settlements and civilization and seem to have caused human epidemics in

96

the past 20, we speculated that human culture might provide certain behavioural adaptations to

97

coronavirus infections. Such knowledge may be applicable to alleviate some of the hardship

98

and suffering caused by SARS-CoV-2 in a process of ‘cultural repurposing’. People with

99

respiratory diseases often consume herbal products and teas in attempts of self-medication.

100

Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, people reported that they have changed their behaviour

101

accordingly. In two studies comprising thousands of people, up to 57.6% of individuals

102

reported having used nutritional supplements or herbal products, usually as teas, in attempts to

111

of their ability to elicit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, we applied an experimental

112

setup that reflects short-term incubation of infected cells with herbal teas. We infected highly

113

SARS-CoV-2-permissive Vero E6 cells for 1 h before the virus suspension was removed and

114

different dilutions of aqueous infusions of perilla and sage were added (Fig. 1a). As control,

115

we included coriander, a herb that does not belong to the family of Lamiaceae and that is to

116

our knowledge not commonly used as medicinal herb. We applied aqueous infusions that

117

were prepared by boiling up the coriander, perilla, and sage leaves and subsequent simmering

118

at 60°C for 2 h to ensure complete extraction of the water-soluble components of the herbs.

119

Intriguingly, the short-term treatment with perilla and sage infusions was sufficient to

120

significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1b, upper panel; for details

121

concerning the calculation of the infectivity see Methods section and Supplementary Fig. S1).

122

This effect does not appear to constitute a general antiviral activity, since inhibition of HSV-1

123

replication in treated Vero E6 cells was not observed (Fig. 1b, lower panel). To visualize the

124

impact of the herbal teas on the SARS-CoV-2 replication, we repeated the experiment with

125

two different doses of virus and stained the infected cells for immunofluorescence

126

microscopy. As depicted in Fig. 1c, the number of infected cells (stained in green) was clearly

127

diminished after treatment with perilla and sage infusions. The antiviral activity was still

128

evident even when a high amount of virus was used for infection (0.5 PFU/cell). In addition,

129

cell viability was determined to exclude cytotoxicity as reason for diminished viral replication

130

(Supplementary Fig. S2). When we evaluated different members of the family of Perilla

131

frutescens (red perilla, green perilla, and bi-color perilla), we observed antiviral activity in all

132

three cases (Fig. 1d). To confirm, that the experimental setup allows reporting of antiviral

133

activity affecting post-entry steps, we included a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum sample

134

with shown neutralizing capacity

135

infusions outperformed the effect of the convalescent serum (Fig. 1e; NAbs, neutralizing

136

antibodies) under these experimental conditions, showing that the herbs perilla and sage

137

contain components active against SARS-CoV-2 replication by interfering with a post-entry

138

step. Since the components were extracted by boiling the herbs in water, we concluded that

139

the antiviral activity is elicited by water-soluble heat-stable compound(s).

140

Preserved sage and perilla leaves retain bioactive compounds

141

When we used a second clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate to test the susceptibility towards the

142

herbal components, we observed almost identical dose responses (Supplementary Fig. S3).

143

The combined results of 8 independent experiments (using two distinct SARS-CoV-2 isolates

144

for the infection of Vero E6 and α-S or α-N antibodies for staining) revealed highly

23

in our analysis. We observed that the perilla and sage

145

significant antiviral activity of all tested dilutions of the perilla infusion as well as of the 1/10

146

and 1/20 dilutions of the sage infusion (Fig. 2a). Considering that the herbal infusions were

147

prepared from 150 g of fresh herbal material per liter, which correspond to 15-30 g of dried

148

herbal material per liter (assuming a water content of 80-90% of fresh herbs), a 1/10 dilution

149

of these infusions already meets the concentration of herbal teas prepared from standard tea

150

bags (1.5-2.25 g per cup). This indicates that herbal teas prepared from commercially

151

available tea bags or dried herb leaves might contain a sufficient concentration of the antiviral

152

compound(s). To further adapt the experimental setup to realistic conditions of tea

153

consumption, we shortened the treatment time from 1 h to 30 min. Even under this condition,

154

significant reduction of viral replication was observed (Fig. 2b). Next, we compared the

155

antiviral activity of infusions prepared from fresh or dried herb leaves. As shown in Fig. 2c,

156

dried sage leaves retained most of the antiviral component(s) whereas dried perilla was less

157

effective as compared to fresh perilla leaves although significant inhibition of viral replication

158

was observed for the 1/10 dilutions. Since the herbal infusions were prepared by boiling,

159

simmering, and over-night incubation (see Methods section), we also tested if the standard

160

procedure of herbal tea preparation using dried sage leaves is sufficient to extract the antiviral

161

component(s). To this end, dried sage leaves were boiled up in water and incubated for 10

162

min before the herb leaves were removed. When this ‘10 min infusion’ of dried sage was

163

compared to the ‘over-night infusion’, very similar dose response curves were observed (Fig.

164

2d). To assess whether conservation of perilla by freezing could be superior to drying in terms

165

of preserving the antiviral component(s), we first tested if the antiviral activity of perilla

166

infusions is reduced by freeze-thaw cycles. Since this did not seem to be the case (Fig. 2e),

167

infusions prepared from fresh and frozen perilla leaves were compared. The comparison

168

revealed that the preservation of the herbs by freezing was preferable to drying (Fig. 2f).

169

Perilla and sage elicit prophylactic antiviral activity in vitro

170

Having observed the potent antiviral activity of perilla and sage after only 1 h of treatment,

171

we wondered whether the herbs might also elicit prophylactic effects. Therefore, Vero E6

172

cells were treated 1 h prior to infection with different dilutions of the herbal infusions before

173

the supernatant including the herbal components was removed. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2

174

infection was performed and the virus suspension was replaced by fresh medium at 1 h p.i.

175

(Fig. 3a). By removing the herbal infusions before infection, we aimed to primarily assess

176

antiviral effects based on cellular responses and not on direct virucidal elimination of

177

infectious virus particles. The analysis of combined results of 6 independent experiments

178

using two distinct SARS-CoV-2 isolates and α-S or α-N antibodies for staining showed highly

179

significant decrease of infectivity, especially upon pre-treatment with the perilla infusion (Fig.

180

3b). To compare the extent of prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral capacity, we conducted

181

an experiment in which we treated and pre-treated the infected cells in parallel. As already

182

indicated by the results of the independent experiments (Fig. 2a and 3b), therapeutic treatment

183

elicits stronger antiviral activity for both perilla and sage (Fig. 3 c, d). Nonetheless, perilla and

184

sage teas might not only be suitable for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections but also for

185

prevention of infections.

186

Perilla and sage confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells

187

Since cells differ concerning the mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 24, a second independent cell

188

line was tested. Caco-2 cells were used to analyse the antiviral activity elicited by perilla and

189

sage infusions in human cells. We have observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is more

190

protracted in Caco-2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells

191

was adapted by increasing the time of treatment as well as the time of infection before

192

analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4a). We observed a strong decrease in infectivity in perilla-

193

and sage-treated Caco-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4b). Encouraged by this result, we

194

applied the same treatment regimen of 1 h as was used for Vero E6 cells (Fig. 4a). This early

195

short-term treatment was sufficient to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, even in cells

196

with a protracted viral replication cycle (Fig. 4b). To visualize the antiviral activity, Caco-2

197

cells were infected with and without treatment (as depicted in Fig. 4a) and were fixed for

198

fluorescence microscopic analysis. This analysis showed clearly visible differences in the

199

number of Spike-positive cells (Fig. 4c) validating the data obtained by in-cell-ELISA

200

(icELISA).

201

Taken together, the Lamiaceae plants perilla and sage contain water-soluble heat-stable

202

components eliciting potent therapeutic as well as prophylactic antiviral activity against

203

SARS-CoV-2 in different cell lines.

204

Discussion

205

Using different assays such as visualization by fluorescence microscopy and measurements by

206

icELISA, which provides objective quantification of either the SARS-CoV-2 N or S protein,

207

we observed significant, potent, and dose-dependent antiviral activity of herbal teas produced

208

by boiling leaves of the Lamiaceae plants perilla and sage. The effect was evident in different

209

cellular models including highly permissive Vero E6 cells and human Caco-2 cells. In all

210

assays, unspecific and general effects were excluded by a suitable negative control (coriander

. Therefore, the experimental setup

211

infusion). As expected from the fact that these plants are edible, the treatment did not exert

212

cytotoxicity. Although the FDA generally recognizes sage as safe

213

particular should not be consumed by pregnant and breastfeeding women without consultation

214

of their health-care provider 26 due to the potential to cause toxicity to the foetus or to induce

215

premature labour. Sage is also discussed to reduce the milk supply when consumed during

216

lactation. Additionally, sage and perilla can cause allergic reactions 27.

217

A typical cup of tea corresponds to ca. 250 ml of volume and commercial tea bags usually

218

contain 1.5-2.25 g of plant material. Our initial extracts were produced using 15 g of herb

219

leaves boiled in 100 ml water. In human cells, perilla and sage teas elicited significant

220

antiviral effects at dilutions of 1:40 (3.75 g per litre or ca. 0.94 g per cup) and 1:30 (5 g per

221

litre or ca. 1.25 g per cup) (Fig. 2a), indicating efficacy at concentrations usually consumed in

222

such herbal teas. Intriguingly, as little as 30 min of treatment, after which the tea was

223

removed, were sufficient to significantly diminish the SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 2b).

224

Through a series of experiments, we further showed that different perilla plant variations and

225

all usual forms of preparation and preservation of perilla and sage such as teas prepared from

226

fresh leaves, dried leaves as well as frozen and thawed leaves elicit significant inhibition of

227

SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 2).

228

Given that Vero cells are incapable to express type I interferons due to genetic aberrations 28,

229

the antiviral activity observed in Vero E6 cells indicate that perilla and sage extracts elicit

230

their effect independent of interferon induction. SARS-CoV-2 exploits different host-derived

231

proteases. In TMPRSS2-negative cells such as Vero, the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs

232

mainly through an endosomal route facilitated by S cleavage by Cathepsins

233

SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cells can be significantly inhibited by blocking the

234

acidification of endosomes (e.g., by ammonium chloride) or Cathepsin inhibitors such as E-

235

64d. Conversely, in TMPRSS2-positive cells such as Caco-2, the effect of E-64d is less

236

pronounced while the priming of S is supported by TMPRSS2 as evident by Camostat

237

mesylate treatment studies 24,29. Our finding that Lamiaceae infusions exhibit antiviral activity

238

in both cell types (Fig. 1 and 4) suggests that S cleavage and the endosomal entry route are at

239

least not the only target of the antiviral mechanism. This conclusion is further supported by

240

our observation that sage and perilla herbal teas diminished viral replication, especially when

241

they were applied after infection (Fig. 1, 2, and 4) at a time at which neutralizing antibodies

242

present in convalescent plasma (CP) had lost most of their antiviral activity. In such treatment

243

regimens, the herbal teas significantly outperformed NAb-containing CP (Fig. 1e).

Plants of the Lamiaceae family have previously been shown to possess antiviral activity

247

compounds responsible for the antiviral activity of aqueous perilla and sage infusions and to

elucidate whether the antiviral activity against retroviruses and coronaviruses is mediated by

249

the same or similar molecules.

250

The WHO SOLIDARITY trial comprising more than 400 hospitals and 11,000 patients in 30

251

countries showed that ‘Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens

252

appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall

253

mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay’

254

may be attributed to the practice of reserving such drugs for critically ill patients where they

255

may be applied too late in terms of disease progression. Others and we hope that studies in

256

which single therapies are administered earlier will be more successful. A widely discussed

257

potential solution to the limitations of single therapies is obviously to combine substances that

258

on their own have only limited effects. Such ‘shotgun’ treatment regimens have already

259

shown some success

260

and exhibit excellent safety profiles given their consumption as spices, we propose to add

261

perilla and sage infusions to such combinatorial treatment regimens. Additionally, these

262

Lamiaceae teas may be applicable as an addition to the very important non-pharmaceutical

263

interventions (NPI) such as wearing a face cover, proper hygiene, physical distance, and the

264

restriction of social interactions.

265

Obviously, the consumption of herbal teas cannot and should not replace NPIs or clinically

266

approved drugs. However, given their inexpensive and universal availability, they might

267

contribute to prevent and/or relieve some of the hardness and suffering of the COVID-19

268

pandemic. We are convinced that our data argue in favour of future clinical studies addressing

269

the question of whether herbal teas based on perilla and/or sage may either be able to

270

prophylactically reduce infections or offer therapeutic benefits when administered

271

concomitantly with the standard treatment - or both.

SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated from patient samples using Vero E6 and confirmed by

282

SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic qRT-PCR. Viral titers were determined by TCID50 titration. The

283

virus isolation has been approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the

284

University of Duisburg-Essen (20-9511-BO and 20-9512-BO). HSV-1-ΔgE-GFP was

285

generated and described

286

Science University, USA). With Prof. Johnson’s written permission, we received the virus

287

from Prof. Hartmut Hengel (University of Freiburg, Germany).

288

Generation of aqueous infusions of herbs

289

The herbal infusions were prepared by boiling up 15 g of fresh herbal leaves in 100 ml water

290

and subsequent simmering at 60°C for 2 h. The infusions were stored over-night at 4°C before

291

the leaves were removed and the aqueous solutions were sterile-filtered (200 µM filter,

292

Whatman/GE Healthcare). Afterwards, the herbal infusions were stored in aliquots at -80°C.

293

For the infusions based on dried herbs, 3 g of material per 100 ml were utilized. The ‘10 min

294

infusion’ was prepared by boiling up dried sage leaves in water (30 g per liter) and subsequent

295

incubation for 10 min before the herb was removed. Sterile-filtered aliquots were then stored

296

at -80°C. Infusions of frozen and rethawed herbal material were prepared in the same manner

297

as those based on fresh herbs. The concentration of 150 g of material per liter was calculated

298

based on the fresh weight before freezing. The sources of supply for the herbal leaves and

299

plants are as follows: coriander and sage, farmer´s market (Essen, Germany); red and green

300

perilla plants, online vendor Naturkraeutergarten (Kleinich, Germany); bi-color perilla plant,

301

home-grown; dried red perilla, home-dried; dried green perilla, Keiko Shiso Finest Selection

302

(Japan); dried sage, vom-Achterhof Bio-Salbei (Uplengen, Germany).

303

in-cell-ELISA (icELISA)

304

For the quantification of viral protein amounts in infected cells, an icELISA was applied. A

305

detailed icELISA protocol is provided in

306

and fixed after 20 or 30 h of infection with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS. Cells were

307

permeabilized with 1% (v/v) Triton-X-100/PBS and blocked with 3% (v/v) FCS/PBS. The

308

primary antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or over-night at 4°C.

309

Peroxidase-labelled secondary antibody was incubated for 1-2 h. Washing steps were

310

performed with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20/PBS. Tetramethylbenzidin (TMB) substrate was added

311

to visualize the enzyme reaction. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 M HCl before the

312

absorbance was determined using a microplate multireader and MicroWin software (Mithras2

313

LB 943; Berthold Technologies). The resulting data were analysed using Excel and GraphPad

314

Prism software. The α-S mAb (kindly provided by Peter Miethe, fzmb, Bad Langensalza,

315

Germany), α-N mAb (ABIN6952435), and POD-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova)

316

were used.

317

Dose-response curves of antiviral activity

318

To enable comparison among different icELISA measurements and experiments, we included

319

on every plate a virus calibration curve. Residual infectivity after treatment was calculated

320

using the formula computed from the calibration curve (see Supplementary Fig. S1 as an

321

example). Dose-response curves were compiled based on the relative change in infectivity

322

compared to the untreated control.

323

Immunofluorescence microscopy

324

Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and fixed after 20 or 30 h of infection using 4% (w/v)

325

paraformaldehyde/PBS for >2 h before they were discharged from the BSL-3 laboratory.

326

Cells were permeabilized with 1% (v/v) Triton-X-100/PBS and blocked with 3% (v/v)

327

FCS/PBS. SARS-CoV-2 infection was visualized by use of α-S mAb (kindly provided by

328

Peter Miethe, fzmb, Bad Langensalza, Germany) and Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG

329

(Dianova). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma).

330

Fluorescence was visualized using a THUNDER Imager 3D Cell Culture (Leica). Image

331

analysis and processing were performed with LAS X Premium imaging software (Leica).

332

Statistical analysis

333

Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA as described in the figure

334

legends. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. *, p value <0.05. **, p

335

value <0.01. ***, p value <0.001.

a, b Pooled icELISA data of 5 (a, isolate 1) and 3 (b, isolate 2) independent experiments of

544

SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells after treatment with herbal infusions using two distinct

545

SARS-CoV-2 isolates for infection of Vero E6 and α-S or α-N mAbs for staining. Data are

546

expressed as relative change in optical density compared to the untreated control. The perilla-

547

and sage-treated conditions were compared to the corresponding coriander-treated condition

548

(same dilution) by one-way ANOVA. **, p<0.01. ***, p<0.001.
