Abstract
Background: The spike S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is N-glycosylated. The N-glycan structure and
composition of this glycoprotein influence how the virus interacts with host cells.
Objective: To identify a putative N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of SARS-CoV-2 (HEK293 cell
recombinant) from previously published mass spectrometric studies, and to identify what effect blocking
some enzymes has on the overall glycoprotein profile. Finally, our goal was to provide the biosynthesis
network, and glycans in easy-to-use format for further glycoinformatics work.
Methods: We reconstructed the glycosylation network based on previously published empirical data using
GNAT, a glycosylation network analysis tool. Our compilation of the network tool had 23
glycosyltransferase and glucosidase enzymes, and could infer the pathway of glycosylation machinery
based on glycans identified in the virus spike protein. Once the glycan biosynthesis pathway was
generated, we simulated the effect of blocking specific enzymes - Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6fucosyltransferase to see how they would affect the biosynthesis network.
Results: Of the 23 enzymes, a total of 12 were involved in glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 - Man-Ia,
MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI and FucT8.
Blocking enzymes resulted in a substantially modified glycan profile of the protein.
Conclusions: A network analysis of N-glycan biosynthesis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows an
elaborate enzymatic pathway with several intermediate glycans, along with the ones identified by mass
spectrometric studies. Variations in the final N-glycan profile of the virus, given its site-specific
microheterogeneity, could be a factor in the host response to the infection and response to antibodies.
Here we provide all the resources generated - the glycans derived from mass spectrometry and
intermediate glycans in glycoCT xml format, and the biosynthesis network for future drug and vaccine
development work.

Introduction
Glycosylation is a very common and complex post-translational modification process of proteins1. About
90% of human proteins are N-glycosylated. N-glycosylation has been shown to have an impact on protein
folding and function in some cases2, but not in others3. Among various reasons, this could suggest that the
site of glycosylation, or the type of the glycan – mannose-rich, hybrid or complex, also play a role in
influencing protein structure and function. Viruses use the host glycosylation machinery to replicate. So, it
can be useful to understand which enzymes are critical to this process. Bioinformatics tools have been
used to determine physiological processes in the field of genetics4 and cancer biology5 with success, and
glycobiology is no exception6.
Given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the role of the spike-S-glycoprotein in the virus
entry and infection of host cells7, we chose to map the enzymatic machinery that is responsible for the
spike-S-glycoprotein synthesis. This pathway could help with vaccine development, where modified
glycoproteins can be used to simulate binding using molecular dynamic binding studies with immune cells
or immunoproteins, determining the host response8. Several groups of researchers have developed
bioinformatics tools that are useful in understanding glycosylation, both for glycosite prediction9 and to
predict the bio-synthetic pathway based on empirical data from mass spectrometry10. GNAT11, which is
used in the current manuscript, is a tool that allows to selectively identify glycosylation pathways using
the glycan profile of each protein based on specific enzyme rules and constraints.
The glycosylation profile of the spike S protein has been reported by three independent research
groups thus far, using sequencing, mass spectrometry and imaging tools12-14. There is some variability in
the reported glycosylation profile based on these reports. And further research is necessary to find out how
the host processes are actually being used to generate the spike glycoprotein, as pointed out by Shajahan et
al14.

In this work, we examined the effect of blocking two different glycosylation enzymes, to see if we
can modify the network of glycans developed as part of the virus spike glycoprotein. Specifically, we
chose to simulate blocking Mannosidase-II and alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase. Expanding on these blocking
studies can help identify the ideal targets to choose that affect the virus replication, since that is dependent
on the spike glycoprotein, without affecting the host.

Methods
Simulated N-glycan biosynthetic network generation: We used the list of the most representative Nglycans per glycosite detected by Zhang et al (obtained from figure 3 in their manuscript)12, and the Nglycan profile of SARS-CoV-2 as reported by Shahjahan et al (obtained from figure 4 in their
manuscript)14 to generate our primary glycosylation biosynthesis networks. Data from Zhang et al11 and
Shajahan et al13 were both obtained from recombinant viral proteins expressed in HEK293 cells. We
generated glycoCT xml version of these glycans using the glycanbuilder tool15 and verified structures
using the glycan chemNIST MS database16. Our supplemental documents provide all the glycans that
were used and generated as part of this analysis in glycoCT xml format.

GNAT and Inferglycan pathway: As mentioned earlier, we used GNAT11, with the additional enzymes
developed by Hou et al17 to have a functional simulation tool for N-glycan biosynthesis with a total of 23
enzymes. The reverse inference algorithm derives the N-glycosylation pathway from a given set of
reaction products and possible enzymes. For each enzyme, a set of rules and constraints is provided that
defines its action. Given a glycan, it is then possible to identify a set of reactions that led to the production
of the glycan, by examining all the enzyme rules with constraints in reverse. This will generate either a
network of glycans which are predecessors of the given glycan all the way to Man-9, which is the ‘parent’
glycan for this pathway, or will result in an empty set, i.e., the given glycan has no predecessor leading the
way to Man-9. Since we provided all the required enzymes to construct the entire glycosylation pathway,
we were able to identify all the paths from Man-9 to all the glycans observed in the Mass Spectrometry
studies. Since, there is no good way to determine the linkage information (i.e. structure) from mass
spectrometry-based composition18, there is likely structural heterogeneity that we failed to account for.
This heterogeneity can also affect the pathway that was chosen or the enzyme that was involved in the
biosynthesis, which is a limitation in our current approach.

Simulated inhibition of glycan biosynthesis pathway: There are established chemical inhibitors for
blocking or slowing down the rate of glycosylation biosynthetic reactions19. The blocking of these
pathways has been discussed and considered in the past20,21. We identified the N-glycan biosynthesis
pathway using GNAT, based on which we chose to simulate blocking of ManII and FucT8. We generated
network graphs with glycans as nodes, and the enzymes as edges with and without the simulated enzyme
inhibition.

Results
Figure 1 depicts the network of reactions (edges colored by enzyme) and glycans (nodes, numbered ones
were identified by the masspec data) generated based on glycans from Zhang et al. The glycans detected
by mass spectrometric analyses are numbered, and the intermediate ones generated in the biosynthesis
pathway are not numbered. Our results suggest the involvement of the following 9 enzymes: Man-Ia, Man
II, MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, SiaT and FucT8. In addition to the full network of
biosynthetic reactions, Figure 2 also has panels depicting the effect blocking Man-II and FucT8. In both
cases, only 3 of the total 10 glycans were formed, thus modifying the glycan profile of the viral protein. In
panel B and C, the network depicting 3 glycans (1, 4 and 9) that result in being traced back to the Man-9
residue (residue # 102) will be formed. The other network that is independent of this (not containing
resiude#102) comprises all the glycans that would not be formed. Table 1 presents the glycans that could
and could not be formed when Man II and FucT8 were blocked. As previously mentioned, these two
inhibitors were chosen because they have been established to specifically inhibit glycosylation enzymes.

Figure 2 depicts the network of reactions and glycans similar to Figure 2, but is based on glycans from
Shajahan et al. Similar to Figure 1, the glycans detected by mass spectrometric analyses are numbered,
and the intermediate ones generated in the biosynthesis pathway are not. Here, 12 enzymes were involved
– Man-Ia, MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT4, MGAT5, B4GalT, B4GalT, Man II, SiaT, ST3GalI, ST3GalVI
and FucT8. Similar to Figure 2, blocking of Man II and FucT8 resulted in a very different glycosylation
profile of the overall protein, since only the network of glycans that can be traced back to Man-9 (residue
#15) would be formed, and the others (networks without residue #15) would not be formed. Table 2
presents the glycans that could and could not be formed when Man II and FucT8 were blocked.

Even though we included data from both manuscripts, since we only used the representative glycan from
Zhang et al, and a more complete version of data from Shajahan et al, it is likely that the latter is a more
accurate representation of the glycosylation process of the virus.

DISCUSSION
Here we present a preliminary N-glycan biosynthesis pathway of the spike S glycoprotein on SARS-CoV2, which is not available currently for quick examination. We also share the individual glycan structures in
a more easily accessible format for future glycoinformatics and molecular dynamics work. Based on our
blocking simulation studies, the enzymes Man-II and FucT8 play important roles in the biosynthetic
pathway, and without them the glycans synthesized are altered, changing the glycoprotein profile. The Nglycan biosynthesis pathway is a highly conserved two-step process – beginning in the endoplasmic
reticulum, and ending in the golgi body 22. It has recently been recognized that the host glycosylation
process is very relevant to vaccine development 13 and being able to identify the effect of modified
glycans on the protein could further aid in development of vaccines. This first step will pave the way for
such future work.
We did not choose to focus only on the glycans in the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the
current report. Instead we showed that the overall glycan profile is altered dramatically by simulating
glycosylation pathway inhibitors. Owing to the site-specific microheterogeneity that all glycoproteins
express, which is also true of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, it becomes important in subsequent steps to
study the effect of this variability on its pathogenicity, with specific focus on the glycans in the RBD.
However, the role of these glycans in overall protein folding and dynamics is unclear, and still being
studied. Several factors determine this microheterogeneity23, which in turn affects the structure, folding,
and dynamics of the protein. So, it becomes important to not focus only on the glycans within the RBD of
the spike S protein. Researchers have generated molecular dynamic simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein that represents site-specific micro-heterogeneity, based on mass spectrometry and imaging studies
24,25

. Following up on our current approach, it would be possible to generate molecular dynamic

simulation studies of altered spike S-glycoprotein that is generated by altering the glycosylation
machinery, for vaccine development or other purposes.

Various levels of computational modeling of N-glycosylation have been used in the past. Here we
used a pathway construction computational model. Alternatively, simulations that include the kinetics of
enzyme activity by including rate equations can be more representative of the physiological process26.
Using kinetics, it will further be possible to examine the effect of slowing down the rate of glycosylation
of the spike S protein on overall viral replication27. Such an approach could shed light on potential
pharmacological targets that would slow down both the host and the virus glycosylation pathways. If used
appropriately, it may become possible to identify pharmacological targets that would affect the host the
least, and the virus the most. Also, the time involved in testing several of these targets to identify ideal
ones can be made short by using such network modeling tools before pre-clinical trials. However, this can
be very challenging since the mammalian host post-translational glycosylation, and its downstream effect
on proteins and their functions is still an active area of investigation.
Yet another approach is to use golgi-compartment representations within the modeling framework
to model intra-organelle regional impacts on protein synthesis28. This could also aid in developing
accurate representations of the enzymatic biosynthesis pathway. Alternately, for the current crisis, these
approaches could evaluate competitive inhibitor glycans (natural or synthetic) and their effect on viral
replication. By generating modified glycoproteins, it is possible to evaluate how they bind to, or alter the
immune response of the host, since the host response to SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be the
determining factor in the severity of the manifested infection or in development of life-threatening adverse
complications29. The added benefit of modeling is to be able to quickly narrow down targets by simulating
several at once, while also knowing the underlying mechanism, which is not always possible in clinical
studies. This makes computational modeling a useful tool in drug and vaccine discovery efforts.

Limitations: As mentioned, there are several more approaches to construct N-glycosylation pathways. In
addition to that, this work being computational, is preliminary, and requires further computational and

dynamic modeling studies, to determine if the altered glycan affects the protein, and its downstream
binding with mammalian receptors.
