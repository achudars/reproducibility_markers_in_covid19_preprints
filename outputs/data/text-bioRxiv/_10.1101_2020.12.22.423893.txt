Summary
SARS-CoV-2 uses subgenomic (sg)RNA to produce viral proteins for replication and immune
evasion. We applied long-read RNA and cDNA sequencing to in vitro human and primate
infection models to study transcriptional dynamics. Transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)dependent sgRNA was upregulated earlier in infection than TRS-independent sgRNA. An
abundant class of TRS-independent sgRNA consisting of a portion of ORF1ab containing nsp1
joined to ORF10 and 3’UTR was upregulated at 48 hours post infection in human cell lines.
We identified double-junction sgRNA containing both TRS-dependent and independent
junctions. We found multiple sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 genome is consistently more
modified than sgRNA, and that sgRNA modifications are stable across transcript clusters, host
cells and time since infection. Our work highlights the dynamic nature of the SARS-CoV-2
transcriptome during its replication cycle. Our results are available via an interactive web-app

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA beta-coronavirus, is the causative agent of COVID-19
(Zhou et al., 2020). As with all identified coronaviruses, the replicative and infectious cycle of
SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by a process termed discontinuous minus-strand extension
which occurs during replication of viral RNA by the viral Replication and Transcription Complex
(RTC) within the host cell. The RTC halts synthesis of negative sense RNA when it encounters
a 6 – 8 nucleotide (nt) Transcript Regulating Sequence (TRS) in the body of the genome (TRSB) and reinitiates synthesis via a template switching event with a homologous TRS present in
the 5’ leader sequence (TRS-L) (V'Kovski et al., 2020). This results in a set of nested negativestrand templates (shown in Figure S1) which are utilised for expression of subgenome mRNA
(sgRNA). Each sgRNA includes the 3’ polyadenylated (poly(A)) Untranslated Region (UTR),
a truncated set of 3’ Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and a common 5’ leader sequence. The
production of subgenome transcripts alleviates pressure on the primary viral genome for
protein synthesis and enables the translation of proteins at greater speed and concentration.
Major SARS-CoV-2 TRS-dependent mRNAs have been previously described (Davidson et al.,
2020, Kim et al., 2020, Taiaroa et al., 2020). However, the changes in the viral transcriptome
and epi-transcriptome across the course of cellular infection have not yet been explored.
Long-read sequencing platforms can generate reads spanning the length of these sgRNA and
are thus better suited to transcriptomic characterization of its highly nested transcriptome. One
such platform is the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)), that can sequence either
native RNA or cDNA directly without requirement for PCR amplification, therefore reducing
PCR induced biases in estimation of expression levels (Ozsolak F et al., 2011). Furthermore,
RNA modifications induce changes in ONT signal which enable exploration of the epitranscriptome using direct RNA (dRNA) sequencing (Garalde et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2020).
In this manuscript, we carried out a comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 transcription.
We generated more than 8 million long-read viral dRNA sequences and direct cDNA reads
across multiple time points (2, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi)) with infected African green
monkey (Vero) and Human (Calu-3, Caco-2) cell lines. We have developed an interactive web

http://coinlab.mdhs.unimelb.edu.au/. Our dataset provides an expansive overview of the
SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and its changes throughout the course of infection. Our work will
enable the development of new diagnostic tests for monitoring the progression of SARS-CoV2 infectious cycle both in vitro and in vivo. This will assist in better understanding the
mechanism-of-action of therapeutic agents and in monitoring the efficiency of the immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccination studies.
Results
Infection dynamics are represented by changes in proportion of sgRNA
Viral RNA load was substantially higher in African green monkey Vero cells in comparison to
Human Caco-2 and Calu-3 cell lines, reaching a maximum of 74% of all sequenced RNA at
24 hours post infection (hpi). In comparison, a maximum of 4% of all sequenced RNA mapped
to SARS-CoV-2 in infected human cell lines at 48 hpi (Figure 1a). Even as early as 2 hpi,
substantially more viral reads were detectable in Vero compared to Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells
(Figure S2), suggesting a faster course of infection in Vero cells.
The proportion of sgRNA (i.e reads containing both 5’ leader and 3’ UTR) amongst all viral
mapping reads peaked at around 40% in all three cell lines at 24 hpi (Figure 1a). In the nonreplicating virion sample, as well as the 2 hpi samples, most reads were sequenced from the
viral genome, as they had complete 3’ UTR but no 5’ leader (labelled as non5_3, Figure S2).
This indicated that transcriptional activity had yet to accelerate at this early timepoint. Vero
cells showed a greater proportion of sgRNA at 2 hpi compared to the Caco-2 and Calu-3
(Fisher exact test p=0.02)), suggesting that transcriptional activity is able to commence earlier
during infection of Vero cells.
To further investigate the relationship between production of sgRNA and progression of
infection, we calculated, for each ORF, the proportion of reads spanning the ORF which also
contained the leader sequence (Figure 1b). We observed that the RNA derived from the virion
sample had the least sgRNA, followed by 2 hpi, whereas the 24 hpi samples had the highest
proportion of sgRNA in Vero and Calu-3 cell lines, with maximum discrimination between the
virion RNA and 24 hpi obtained for the N ORF.
We then designed primers to measure both subgenomic and total N ORF expression and used
quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) with primers targeting these regions. For
comparison, we applied the same approach for both subgenomic and total E ORF (Wolfel et
al., 2020, Corman et al., 2020). In all three cell lines, the difference between subgenomic and
total N and E ORFs was smallest at 24 hpi (1.1 and 3.1 cycle threshold (Ct) difference

respectively in Vero) with a slight increase at the final 48 hpi timepoint (Figure 1c). This
suggests that SARS-CoV-2 reaches its peak rate of transcriptional activity at the 24 hpi
timepoint. By calculating expected Ct differences between subgenomic and total E and N
ORFs from sequence data, we further confirmed that RT-qPCR results captured the same
dynamics (Figure S3).
Overall, these results reveal the changing proportions of sgRNA during the SARS-CoV-2 virus
infectious cycle. Our analysis using RT-qPCR to compare total and sgRNA demonstrates the
potential to track viral transcriptional activity using PCR. Our data indicates that the slower
rate of infection in human compared to monkey Vero cell lines may arise due to both
differences in viral entry and differences in rate of early viral genome replication.
Coronaviruses produce classes of TRS-independent sgRNA which are abundantly expressed
While all coronaviruses use a repetitive 6 nt TRS throughout the genome to generate a nested
set of TRS-dependent sgRNA, the breadth of data generated in this study reveals a more
detailed transcriptome that is also constituted by transcripts generated through other,
unknown genome mechanisms. The depth profile of sgRNA showed sharp changes in readdepth, corresponding to negative strand disjunction mediated by TRS immediately upstream
of the ORF (Figure 2a). To better quantify different classes of sgRNA, we developed a new
tool - npTranscript - which assigns reads to transcript clusters (see Methods). Using
npTranscript, we could calculate the abundance of the sgRNA at various stages of infection.
At the peak of infection in Vero cells (24 hpi), the most abundant sgRNA in terms of Transcripts
Per Million (TPM) mapped viral reads were ORFs N (266,000), 7a/7b (63,000), M (62,000),
ORF1ab,ORF10 (60,000), ORF3a (26,000), ORF8 (16,000), ORF6 (13,000), S (7,500), E
(6,100) and ORF1ab,N (5,700) (Figure 2b). Of these transcripts, formation of ORFs N,7a/7n,
M, 3a, 8, 6, S were all mediated by a TRS-dependent homology (Figure 2c). The remaining
two transcripts ORF1ab,ORF10 and ORF1ab,N were abundant in all 24 hpi and 48 hpi
datasets and did not have breakpoints at TRS motifs (Figure 2c). Further inspection of TRSindependent sgRNA indicated that the majority included the first polypeptide in ORF1ab
(Figure 2d). Taking into account polypeptide boundaries, these transcripts contained leader,
nsp1 and a variable 3’ trailer incorporating a segment of the genome upstream of ORF10 and
continuing until the terminus. The exclusion of the ORF1ab stop codon will allow translation to
continue into a portion of the 3’ ORF downstream of the junction site before a stop codon is
reached, which has the potential to produce truncated proteins of unknown function.
To investigate whether this unusual transcript is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 (which is part of
the beta-coronavirus family), we re-analysed ONT dRNA sequence data from the alpha4

coronavirus 229E-HCoV (Viehweger et al., 2019). We found a similar pattern of TRSdependent and TRS-independent sgRNA (Figure 3a & 3c), in which the first polypeptide nsp1
was joined to a portion of the 3’UTR. Using npTranscript to quantify abundance of these
transcripts, we found that TRS-independent transcripts were substantially more abundant in
wild-type 229E-HCoV compared to a mutant form of 229E in which the conserved 5’ Stem
Loop 2 (SL2) in 229E-HCoV is replaced with that from SARS-CoV and B-CoV 3’UTR (Figure
3b). This finding is suggestive of a role for the SL2 of the leader sequence in the creation of
these transcripts in 229E, perhaps via long-range RNA-RNA interaction, and may be relevant
to the similar extended leader mRNAs found in SARS-CoV-2. Inspection of the RNA
secondary structure of ORF10 + 3UTR indicates that ORF10 forms a Bulged Stem Loop (BSL)
structure, upstream of the hypervariable BSL region of 3’UTR (Figure 3d). The BSL is a
conserved feature of beta-coronavirus genomes and thought to be essential for viral
replication (Madhugiri et al., 2016). Taken together, this evidence supports the role of ORF10
as part of the 3’UTR of SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 produces double-junction sgRNA
We also identified a persistent ‘double junction’ pattern in SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. This
category featured sgRNA that showed two patterns of disjunction present at low
concentrations across both dRNA and cDNA datasets (Figure 4a). ORF10 was the most
frequently added terminal 3’ ORF in double junction sgRNA (Figure 4b). Most first disjunctions
events were TRS-dependent, although 10% used the TRS-independent ORF1ab break point
as described in previous section (Figure S4). In contrast, most second disjunctions were nonTRS dependent, and the 3’ breakpoint mirrored the ORF1ab,ORF10 breakpoint, suggestive
of shared joining mechanism controlling this second junction that differs from TRS-mediated
discontinuous minus-strand extension (Figure S4a). Double junction sgRNA were greatest in
the Calu-3 48 hpi dataset, in which we observed leader,N,ORF10 and leader,ORF7a,ORF10
as most abundant, with 1241 and 811 TPM respectively. We also observed triple-disjunction
clusters at very low levels of expression, such as ORF1ab,ORF1ab,ORF1ab,ORF10 which
had an estimated 60 TPM in Calu-3 48hpi dataset. The majority of final junctions of these
triple-junction reads includes the ORF10 breakpoint (Figure S4b).
In comparison, 229E-HCoV appeared to have a smaller proportion of double-junction reads.
Nevertheless, we observe a leader,ORF1ab,3UTR double junction cluster (Figure 3c). This
cluster was only observed in the WT 229E-HCoV strain, and hence highly dependent on SL2
in the 3’UTR (Figure 4d).

Viral transcript polyadenylation is produced from negative strand templating rather than host
factors.
We detected reads with no region mapping to the 3’ end of the viral genome in both cDNA and
dRNA datasets (Figure 1a). Upon inspection with Nanopolish ‘polya’ we found that no poly(A)
tail is detected in most of these reads (Figure S5a), and that more than half of these reads
also lacked detectable sequencing adapter. This observation was consistent regardless of
whether the transcripts mapped to the viral 5’ terminus and contrasted with transcript
categories that mapped to the 3’ end and possessed clearly segmented poly(A) tails. This
observation was consistent with polyadenylation being produced by templating from the
negative strand, rather than from host polyadenylation factors. The quantity of non-3' reads
varied from 2 – 4% (median = 3.3%) of viral reads in all the dRNA datasets we analysed except
for Vero 24 hpi in which 10% of reads lacked the expected 3' viral segment (Table S1). We
found a non-random distribution of terminal breaks for non-3’ reads, however the sequence
composition of their end segments does not support the idea that it is driven by runs of internal
poly(A) (Figures S5b & S5c). Given the requirement for poly(A) tails for ONT sequencing, we
considered that these reads may arise from incorrect segmentation of a single read into
multiple reads, only one of which possessed a poly(A) tail.
Viral sgRNA expression patterns change during the course of cellular infection
In order to interrogate the differential expression of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional clusters
during the time-course, we analysed ONT direct cDNA data which was sequenced in triplicate
for each time point (2, 24 and 48 hpi) and each cell line (Vero, Calu-3, Caco-2). We utilized
npTranscript to generate a reference transcriptome of sgRNA produced by SARS-CoV-2, and
to assign reads to transcript clusters (see Methods), followed by DESeq2 for differential
expression analyses. We normalized each library by the number of viral mapping reads, rather
than the total number of viral and host mapping reads in order to establish changes in relative
abundance, rather than simply track increase in overall viral RNA during the infection (which
can be seen in Figure 1). From this analysis, we could identify differentially expressed
transcripts between timepoints – 24 vs 48 hpi (late) in all three cell lines, and in 2 vs 24 hpi
(early to late) in the Vero cell line only (due to extremely low abundance of viral mapping reads
in human cell lines at 2 hpi).
Interestingly, in addition to differential expression of transcripts which have both 5’ leader and
3’ UTR, we also found differential expression of transcripts which lacked the leader (non5_3)
or the 3’UTR (5_non3), or both (non5_non3) (Figures 5a-d). For the main analysis, we
proceeded to analyse the 5_3 subset of the differential expression results (Table 1). From our

data, we estimate that the general trajectory of differential expression of SARS-CoV-2
subgenomic transcripts during an infection presents an upregulation of TRS-dependent and
TRS-independent transcripts between early and late infection, and then downregulation of
TRS-dependent and TRS-independent transcripts, followed by an upregulation of fragmented
non5_non3 transcripts at the final stage. Of note, the transcriptional activity of TRSindependent transcripts appeared to occur faster in Vero cells compared to the human cell
lines, as seen by the delayed upregulation of TRS-independent transcript in human cell lines
in relation to Vero cells (Figure 5e).
Among these results, one TRS-independent transcript - leader_ORF1ab,ORF10_3UTR - has
been shown to be consistently differentially expressed across all cell types. These transcripts
were significantly upregulated (p-adj < 0.05) between 2 and 24 hpi in Vero cells, and
downregulated between 24 vs 48 hpi (Figures 5a-d). In comparison, these transcripts are
upregulated between 24 vs 48 hpi in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells, mirroring the viral counts over
time (Figure 1a) as the level of these transcripts peaked at 24 hpi in Vero cells and at 48 hpi
in the human cell lines. Collectively, these results suggest that the peak of TRS-independent
transcriptional activity occurs earlier in Vero cells compared to human cell lines and the
presence of this TRS-independent transcript is of importance as they appear in all three cell
types.
Additionally, we found that differentially expressed 5_3 transcripts (p-adj < 0.05) which were
either genome-mapped or transcriptome-mapped revealed a positive linear correlation in
log2FC between the two mapping methods (Table S2), with less transcripts being differentially
expressed in transcriptome-mapped reads.
RNA modifications vary between genomic and sgRNA but not throughout the course of
infection
We used Tombo to determine de novo modification predictions on the various mRNA
transcripts of the viral genome. Using virion direct RNA as baseline (Taiaroa et al., 2020), we
identified changes to modification of the genome throughout the course of infection, between
individual transcripts, and across the three cell lines: Vero, Calu-3, and Caco-2. The vast
majority (98.2%) of reads from virion dataset included the 3’UTR but not the 5’ leader, and
thus we inferred that it was almost entirely composed of reads from the viral genome rather
than transcribed mRNA. The depth of coverage of this dataset was very low at the 5’ leader,
and thus we are unable to report results of RNA modifications in the leader region (Figure
S6).

The rapid infectibility of Vero cells allows a clear analysis of modifications at 24 and 48 hpi.
The 2 hpi time-point failed to produce adequate subgenome expression for the analysis and
only 311 viral reads were detected in total.
In our analysis, predicted viral modification sites on specific sgRNA clusters did not change
markedly throughout the infection time course (Figure 6). However, we saw differences on
sgRNA as compared to the RNA genome. In particular, all analysed sgRNA clusters displayed
an absence of modification relative to virion genome in three regions as measured by the
mean difference in methylated fraction (µ DMF): 26130 – 26135 in ORF3a (µ DMF = 0.62),
28858 - 28862 in ORFN (µ DMF = 0.6), & 29750A in 3UTR (µ DMF = 0.48) (Figure 6). We
also observed that these modifications in the virion genome generated an artificially high rate
of base-calling error at these positions (Figure S7).
These same findings were repeated in data from Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells at 24 hpi, indicating
that the different cell lines had little impact on modification changes (Figure 6). These results
demonstrate that the viral genome carries RNA modifications which are not detectable on
expressed mRNA.
The modifications reported here all consist of changes at >0.2 DMF2 (equivalent to DMF 0.44).
A results summary including bases at >0.1 DMF2 (equivalent to 0.31) are included in Data S1.
Discussion
The use of long-read native RNA and direct cDNA sequencing allowed the identification of
TRS-dependent and independent transcripts in SARS-CoV-2. TRS-independent transcripts
(sometimes referred to as non-canonical sgRNA) are formed without utilizing homologous
TRS sequences and have been observed to occur in other SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome studies
(Nomburg et al., 2020, Gribble et al., 2020, Kim et al., 2020, Taiaroa et al., 2020). Analysis of
the time-course data presented in this manuscript shows a delayed increase of TRSindependent transcripts relative to TRS-dependent transcripts in two SARS-CoV-2susceptible human cell lines.

The most strongly upregulated of these included the

leader_ORF1ab,ORF10_3UTR and leader_ORF1ab,N_3UTR transcripts (Table 1).
The function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 remains unclear. Some studies have reported evidence
of ORF10 translation (Finkel et al., 2020), while others have not found conclusive evidence of
its existence in proteome databases (Taiaroa et al., 2020). Pancer et al. (2020) identified SNPs
which cause premature stop-codons in ORF10 but do not impact viability in vitro or in vivo.
The active transcription of the leader_ORF1ab,ORF10_3UTR transcript in our data (Figures
5a-d) suggests a role for ORF10 distinct from its protein coding potential. This transcript

contains the full length nsp1 peptide, which is responsible for inhibiting host translation
(Schubert et al., 2020), as well as the stabilizing stem loop structure from ORF10. Thus, the
role of ORF10 in this context may be to stabilize the RNA molecule and enhance production
of nsp1. The RNA family database RFAM (Kalvari et al., 2018) includes ORF10 in the
Sarbecovirus-3UTR-annotated (RF03125) region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
We also observed ORF10 participating in the formation of the second junction in double
junction transcripts. These transcripts typically have a TRS-dependent first junction, and a
TRS-independent second junction to ORF10. The position of the second junction in the region
upstream of ORF10 is variable, further supporting the notion that the ORF10 junction occurs
in a homology independent manner.
One explanation for the mechanism of TRS-independent sgRNA formation maybe long-range
RNA interactions.

Long-range RNA interactions have previously been demonstrated as

important for TRS-mediated leader-body joining in other coronaviruses (Mateos-Gomez et al.,
2013) and may also be essential for non-TRS mediated binding as seen in SARS-CoV-2. Ziv
et al. (2020) explored cis-acting RNA-RNA interactions in SARS-CoV-2 and found several
long-distance interactions within ORF1ab including one which binds position 8357 nt with the
3’UTR of the genome. This interaction may be responsible for promoting generation of the
ORF1ab-ORF10 transcripts we describe.
Differential expression analyses were produced by mapping to the viral genome as well as to
the transcriptome (Table S2). Mapping to the genome allows novel transcripts to be found
(Tombácz et al., 2016), whereas mapping to the transcriptome ensures the identity of the
transcripts by clearly defining the junctions/breakpoints (Zhao, 2014). In this context of
investigating the transcriptome of a novel coronavirus, there is more merit in mapping to the
genome than the transcriptome as the transcriptome has not yet been extensively investigated
and is most likely to be incomplete. The issues of using an incomplete reference transcriptome
have been outlined previously (Pyrkosz et al., 2013). In our data, this is exemplified in
transcripts which contain ORF1ab, as the breakpoint of ORF1ab is variable and cannot simply
be defined by one breakpoint coordinate (Figure S8). This may explain why some transcripts
are found differentially expressed in genome-mapped but not transcriptome-mapped
analyses.
The data generated in this study are uniquely suited to studying the dynamics of viral epitranscriptomics. Earlier studies have gained insights on methylation of 5’ capping for the
escape of host immunity (Chen et al., 2011), and the impact of host epigenetics on disease
outcome (Pinto et al., 2020). Kim et al. (2020) published what is thus far the only analysis of

base modifications on the viral genome in which they report 41 potential 5mC viral modification
sites by contrasting signal-space information of the dRNA-sequenced viral genome against
unmodified In Vitro Transcribed (IVT) sequence data. We used the virion-derived RNA as a
control, which enabled us to focus on differences between modifications on the viral genome
and transcriptome.
We find that the genomic RNA harbours more RNA modifications than the transcribed sgRNA.
In particular, we report three regions which are more modified in genomic RNA than sgRNA.
The strongest of these (position 28858 – 28862) was reported by Kim et al. (2020) who also
reported that position 28859 is more modified amongst longer sgRNA. We extended this
finding by showing that the modified state is representative of the genome RNA. We also
report a remarkably stable pattern of modifications that showed very little change across cell
lines and time points in transcribed sgRNA. This is the first evidence reported for the stability
of SARS-CoV-2 epi-transcriptome throughout infection.
A deeper understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, and how it changes during
infection may lead to new avenues for therapeutic strategies. One example is development of
strategies to disrupt the complex patterns of negative strand disjunction to form sgRNA. Our
work also highlights the importance of TRS-independent transcripts in the infectious cycle of
SARS-CoV-2, which may also be an avenue for therapeutic development. Moreover, such
knowledge also spurs the next generation of diagnostics for monitoring infection progression.
The RNA genome modifications described here may also be a target for therapy, although
further research is required to understand the role of the modifications described here.

Methods
Cell culture
Cell lines were sourced from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and included Vero
(African green monkey kidney epithelial cells, ATCC CCL-81), Caco-2 (human intestinal
epithelial cells, ATCC HTB-37) and Calu-3 (human lung epithelial cells, ATCC HTB-55) and
maintained at 37 °C, 5% (v/v) CO2. Vero cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Media
(MEM) (Media Preparation Unit, Peter Doherty Institute) supplemented with 10% Foetal
Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich), 1X penicillin/streptomycin, 1X Glutamax (Gibco), and
15 mM HEPES (Gibco). Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) (Media Preparation Unit, Peter Doherty Institute) supplemented with 1X nonessential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1X Glutamax 2
µg/mL Fungizone solution, 26.6 µg/mL gentamicin, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL
streptomycin, and 20% FBS). Calu-3 cells were cultured in Advanced DMEM (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 1X Glutamax. All
cell lines were seeded in 4 x 6-well tissue-culture plates and maintained at 37°C for infection.
The cell lines were tested for presence of mycoplasma using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma
Detection Kit (Lonza). Virion culturing was carried out as per described previously (Taiaroa et
al., 2020).

Infection
One 6-well plate per cell line was used for each time point (0, 2, 24, 48 hpi) with triplicate wells
for mock controls and infected cells. All four cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV-

2/Australia/VIC01/2020 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with infection inoculum composed of
serum-free culture media and TPCK-treated trypsin (Worthington). The plates were incubated
at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The 0-hour time point plates were removed from incubation for
harvesting, and 2 mL of serum-free media + TPCK trypsin mixture was added to the plates for
the remaining time points (2, 24, 48 hpi). The 2, 24 and 48 hpi plates were placed in the
incubator in 37 °C, 5% CO2 until harvesting time.

RNA extraction, DNase treatment and magnetic bead purification
The RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract the RNA using the ‘Purification of Total
RNA from Animal Cells Using Spin Technology’ protocol with minor modifications. The
modifications include the following; 600 µL of RLT buffer was added to the cells, and the
lysates were homogenised using the Homogenizer columns (Invitrogen) as per the
manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit and treated with the
DNase from the Turbo DNA-free Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s ‘rigorous
DNase treatment’ protocol. The RNA in the supernatant was cleaned using RNAClean XP
magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) using the protocol ‘Agencourt RNAClean XP protocol
001298v001’. The magnetic beads were added to the RNA at 1.8X concentration and the final
RNA was eluted in nuclease-free water.

Oxford Nanopore Technologies library preparation and sequencing

Direct cDNA sequencing libraries were prepared using an input of 3 µg of total RNA
(equivalent to approximately 150 ng of poly(A) + RNA) for Vero cell infections, and 1-2 µg of
total RNA (equivalent to approximately 50 – 100 ng of poly(A) + RNA) for Caco-2 and Calu-3
cell infections per triplicate. RNA was converted to cDNA via the Direct cDNA sequencing kit
(SQK-DCS109) and multiplexed using the native barcoding kit (EXP-NBD104 & 114). DRNA
sequencing libraries were generated using an input of 6 µg of total RNA (2 µg per triplicate
equivalent to ~300 ng poly(A) + RNA) for Vero cell infections and 3 µg of total RNA (1 µg per
triplicate equivalent to ~150 ng poly(A) + RNA) for Caco-2 and Calu-3 cell infections via the
SQK-RNA002 kit. Due to the absence of multiplexing, control or infected triplicates were
pooled for dRNA sequencing per flow cell. Synthetic RNA controls (Hardwick et al., 2016)
were spiked into samples at ~10% of expected poly(A) + RNA content with Mix A used for
infected samples and Mix B for uninfected controls. All libraries were sequenced with MinION
R9.4.1 flow cells. Sequencing generated approximately 6 – 11 million reads for direct cDNA

and roughly 1-3 million reads for dRNA sequencing. Raw data (FAST5 files) were basecalled
using Guppy v3.5.2.
Data analysis
Transcript Discovery
FASTQ sequences were mapped to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome from the first
Australian case of COVID-19 (Australia/VIC01/2020, NCBI: MT007544.1) using Minimap2
v2.11 with the splice option ‘-x splice’ engaged and ignoring TRS-dependent splice signal ‘un’. Mapped sequences in the resulting BAM file were passed through a transcript discovery
pipeline which annotates reads with information on the location of splice breakpoints relative
to the viral genome. CIGAR strings are used to determine splice regions by continuous
sequence of the N (not mapped) operator. Any splice traversing longer than 1000 bp of the
viral genome is treated as a valid break and the genomic sites of the break are recorded in a
vector such as [read_start, break1_5’, break1_3’, read_end]. We then convert this to an
annotation-based string array.

The read_start, read_end and 5’ breakpoint ends are

converted to the first annotation which starts 5’ upstream of its position, or within 10 bp
downstream of its position to allow for sequencing error. The 3’ breakpoint ends are converted
to text based on the next 3’ downstream annotation, or within 10 bp 5’ upstream. This captures
the fact that the disjunction sites occur immediately upstream of the target ORF. We note that
this is different to the way a eukaryotic or prokaryotic gene annotation program would work.
Finally, we convert the string array into a string via concatenation, with 5’ break to 3’ break
concatenated using a comma to indicate the break. The end result of this procedure is an
assignment of string ID, such as leader_leader,N_3UTR indicating the read starts in the leader
sequence, has its first break point starting in leader and going to upstream of N, and finally
ending

the

3’UTR.

TRS Finding
Transcription Regulating Sequences (TRS) are required for leader-body joining during
discontinuous minus-strand extension. TRS sites were located in the viral genome via a motif
search using FIMO v5.1.1. The 6 bp segments of viral-mapping reads aligned to the TRSdependent 5’ ACGAAC 3’ TRS were extracted from the BAM file and transformed into a
Position Weight Matrix to model variability in the sequence. The hexamer 5’ CTAAAC 3’ was
used for locating TRSs in the 229E genome. The resulting PWM was converted into meme

format using jaspar2meme from MEME-suite v5.1.1 (Bailey et al., 2009) and then used for
scanning the full viral genome using FIMO from the same software suite.

Methylation analysis
Signal-space FAST5 files were assessed to identify signal changes corresponding to RNA
modifications using Tombo v1.5 (Stoiber et al., 2016). Having already been allocated a
transcript cluster in npTranscript, read IDs from each of the 8 major subgenomes were downsampled to 1000 reads. FAST5 reads were retrieved using the ‘fast5_fetcher_multi’ function
in SquiggleKit (Ferguson and Smith, 2019) and resquiggled to the respective reference
transcript. Transcript clusters with fewer than 1000 reads were abandoned for fear of
generating an inaccurate assessment of methylation.
Resquiggled FAST5 reads were input into the ‘detect_modifications’ function using the
‘de_novo’ option which searches for any deviation from the TRS-dependent FAST5 signal.
Outputs were converted to dampened_fraction wiggle files and exported for visualization and
analysis in R. ComplexHeatmap (Gu et al., 2016) was used to produce heatmap plots of
methylation data. Tombo ‘plot’ was used to generate squiggle plots at sites of interest. All R
code for this analysis is available at [https://github.com/dn-ra/SARS-CoV-2_Mods].

Poly(A) analysis
FASTQ passed and failed reads from dRNA sequencing were merged and indexed using
Nanopolish v0.13.2 ‘index’ [https://github.com/jts/nanopolishusing] using the default
parameters ‘-d $FAST5 -s sequencing_summary.txt $FASTQ’. The poly(A) tails of each read
were estimated using the ‘polya’ function with the parameters ‘--reads $FASTQ –bam $BAM
--genome $REFERENCE GENOME > combined.tsv’. A merged reference genome containing
the SARS-CoV-2 Australia virus (Australia/VIC01/2020, NCBI: MT007544.1), host genome
from Ensembl (release 100) and RNA sequin decoy chromosome genome (Hardwick et al.,
2016) was used.

Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
As a measure of infectivity, the difference between total and subgenomic transcripts which
encode for the Nucleocapsid (N) and Envelope (E) genes was investigated using RT-qPCR.
Barcoded cDNA from direct cDNA sequencing libraries were diluted to a concentration of

~0.17 ng/µL and were amplified in triplicate using four sets of primers (1 µM input each primer)
(Sigma-Aldrich) (Table S3) via the PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (2X) (Applied
Biosystems). The amplification was carried out within the Quantstudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR
Systems (Applied Biosystems) with the standard cycling mode (50 °C, 2 mins; 95 °C, 2 mins;
50 cycles of 95 °C, 15 sec and 60 °C x 1 min). The data was analysed using the QuantStudio
Real-Time PCR Software v1.3. As the Ct values of subgenomic E mRNA were undetectable
(> 40 Ct) in 0 and 2 hpi timepoints in the human cell lines across duplicate runs, the Ct value
was regarded as 40 for the purposes of measuring infectivity.

Counts and proportions mapping to host, virus and sequin genes
Samtools v1.9 ‘view’ (Li et al., 2009) was used to generate the name and length of all the
chromosomes in the host reference genome using the commands ‘–H $BAM | grep SQ | cut
–f2-3 | sed ‘s/SN://g’ | sed ‘s/LN:?1\t/g’’. The number of host, virus and sequin reads mapping
to the combined genome was counted using parameters ‘-F4 -F2048 -F256 -L
$LIST_OF_CHROMS_IN_HOST.txt $BAM | wc –l’, ‘-F4 -F2048 -F256 $BAM MT007544.1 |
wc –l' and ‘-F4 -F2048 –F256 $BAM chrIS | wc –l', respectively.

Differential expression analysis
Passed and failed FASTQ files from direct cDNA sequencing were merged for each
sequencing run and used for downstream differential expression analysis. Mapping was
carried out with Minimap2 v2.17 (Li, 2018) with the parameters ‘-ax splice –secondary=no’ to
a

Australia

virus

(Australia/VIC01/2020, NCBI: MT007544.1), host genome from Ensembl (release 100) and
RNA sequin decoy chromosome genome (Hardwick et al., 2016). Using the npTranscript
pipeline, the viral reads were extracted from the BAM files to separate out reads which had
primary mapping to the viral genome. The extracted viral reads were re-mapped to the viral
genome using Minimap2 with the parameters ‘-ax splice –un’ as these parameters account for
TRS-independent splice sites within the viral genome. During this process, Featurecounts-like
count files were generated for differential expression analysis as Featurecounts (Liao et al.,
2014) was unable to be used to generate suitable counts tables for the virus, perhaps due to
the viral annotations being generated in-house using the npTranscript pipeline which are
based on the ORF start position downstream of the 3' break point instead of the breakpoint
being considered as the start of the ORF. The raw counts from npTranscript were analysed
using DESeq2 v1.28.1 (Love et al., 2014) as per described below, where thresholds of |log2FC|

> 0.5 and p-adj < 0.05 were applied. Transcript clusters with both 5’ leader and 3’ UTR
sequences were retained in the results (Table 1). Furthermore, due to the low counts at 2 hpi,
transcripts with direction of normalised counts conflicting with the direction of log2FC between
2 hpi and 24 hpi were regarded as false positives and flagged as being spurious.
In order to assess correlation of differential expression between genome-mapped and
transcriptome-mapped transcripts, extracted viral transcripts from npTranscript which map to
both the 5’ and 3’ ends of the full-length viral transcripts were isolated using a custom script.
The new FASTQ reads were re-mapped to the viral genome using Minimap2 with the
parameters ‘-ax splice –un’ and the transcriptome with the default ‘-ax ont-map'. The same
Featurecounts-like files were generated for genome-mapped reads as above, which were
used for DESeq2 analysis. For viral reads re-mapped with the viral 5_3 transcriptome
generated by npTranscript, primary-mapped reads were isolated using Samtools ‘view -b -h F 2308 $BAM > primary.bam’. Salmon v0.13.1 (Patro et al., 2017) was used for isoform
quantification of alignments with the parameters ‘--noErrorModel –noLengthCorrection’ to
obtain viral transcript counts which were input for differential transcript expression analysis in
DESeq2. Threshold of p-adj < 0.05 were applied were applied for this analysis.

DESeq2 was used to validate the results of differential expression. The counts from
npTranscript and Salmon were input for gene and transcript level analysis respectively. Count
matrices were filtered to remove very lowly expressed features (≤5 in total for each
gene/transcript). Counts were normalised for sequencing depth within DESeq2 prior to
statistical analysis. Log2 fold changes and adjusted p-values (using the Benjamini-Hochberg
method to correct for multiple testing) were calculated for each annotated gene or transcript
and used to determine statistical significance. A regularised log transformation was
subsequently performed on the normalised counts for visualisation. The PCA and volcano

Figure S1: Schematic of major sgRNA described in this study. sgRNA are listed in order
of abundance. Most of the central part of the genome is not expressed in sgRNA but is
translated directly from genomic RNA.
Figure S2: Transcripts per million mapped viral reads for different read categories for
RNA from infected cells 2 hpi (left axis) and total number of viral mapping reads (right
axis). Top left cell is empty as virion cDNA was not sequenced. Related to Figure 1.
Figure S3: Estimated cT difference between sgRNA and total RNA from cDNA
sequence data. Error bars indicate 95% CI estimated based on read depth. For virion E 2
hpi, only the lower 95% CI is shown. Related to Figure 1.
Figure S4: Multiple junction transcript clusters. A. Coverage of SARS-CoV-2 doublejunction reads which have second breakpoint upstream of ORF10 (i.e. in the N ORF) vs
those which do not. B. Coverage of SARS-CoV-2 triple junction reads which have second
breakpoint upstream of ORF10 vs those which do not. Related to Figure 4.
Figure S5: Characterisation of non-3’ mapping reads. A. Poly(A) and sequencing
adaptor detection from nanopolish ‘polya’. Groups without 3' mapping from all experiments
show consistent low detection of poly(A) tail. Vero 48 hpi has a comparatively high amount
of poly(A) detection compared to other experiments which remains unexplained. B. Genome
position at end of read for transcripts without 3' end within final 2000 bases of viral genome.
There is non-random distribution of final breaks indicating unexplained bias in the reads that
pass through the nanopore for sequencing. C. 5-mer at end of non-3' viral RNA reads. 5-mer
is centered on final break of the transcript. Although non-random (5B), the sequencing of
these transcripts cannot be explained by A-rich sequence at their ends. Related to Table S1.

Figure S6: Coverage of SARS-CoV-2 virion dataset. Related to Figure 6.

Figure S7: Basecalling error rate by position for direct RNA extract from Virion (blue)
and Vero at 24 hpi (orange). Size of dot indicates the -log10 p-value of the fisher exact test

comparing basecalling error between two conditions. Error bars indicate estimate 95%
confidence interval of base-calling rate estimation (estimated using binomial model). Only
sites for which both conditions have a coverage of at least 1000 are shown, and at all
positions reads are sub-sampled down to a depth of 1000. Dashed vertical lines indicate
position of TRS. Related to Figure 6.

Figure S8: Histogram of breakpoint positions for leader_ORF1ab,ORF10_3UTR
transcript cluster. A. Position at which reads assigned to cluster have a 5’ breakpoint or
terminate (i.e. contribute to depth “ending”. Zoomed in region shows histogram of 5’ break
points up to 2 kb. B. Position at which reads assigned to cluster have 3’ breakpoint or begin
(i.e. contribute to depth “starting”). Zoomed in region shows histogram of 3’ breakpoints in
final 1.5 kb. Dashed vertical lines show position of TRS motif. Related to Figure 5.
Data S1: Supplementary data for Figure 5 modifications heatmap. Sheet 1 contains the
raw data for values in the heatmap. Sheet 2 contains a subset of sheet 1 with all values for
bases with any one value > 0.1 or < -0.1. Red highlighted base numbers indicate positions
that are near a transcript breakpoint and therefore in question. Units for both sheets is
squared Difference in Methylated Fraction. Related to Figure 6.
