Abstract
The RBD (receptor binding domain) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus S (spike) protein
mediates the viral cell attachment and serves as a promising target for therapeutics
development. Mutations on the S-RBD may alter its affinity to cell receptor and affect
the potency of vaccines and antibodies. Here we used an in-silico approach to predict
how mutations on RBD affect its binding affinity to hACE2 (human
angiotensin-converting enzyme2). The effect of all single point mutations on the
interface was predicted. SPR assay result shows that 6 out of 9 selected mutations can
strengthen binding affinity. Our prediction has reasonable agreement with the
previous deep mutational scan results and recently reported mutants. Our work
demonstrated in silico method as a powerful tool to forecast more powerful virus
mutants, which will significantly benefit for the development of broadly neutralizing
vaccine and antibody.

Introduction
Since it first broke out in late 2019, COVID-19 has soon spread out worldwide and
has been defined as a world pandemic by WTO. The disease is caused by a novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2),
which is a beta-coronavirus closely related to the known SARS-CoV1 2 3. Much

efforts have been distributed in developing the prevention/treatment to the disease,
including small molecule drug4, vaccine5, neutralizing antibodies6-7 and other
engineered proteins8-9. However, none of the methods has been comprehensively
tested or publicly applied so far.
The adhesion of the virus to the target cell and the following membrane fusion
process are essential steps in virus infection thus those two processes are promising
targets for drug development. As is typical for coronavirus, the homo-trimeric spike
glycoprotein (S protein, comprising S1 and S2 subunit in each monomer) on the
envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the cell adhesion process. SARS-CoV-2
uses hACE2 as the receptor for host cell entry10-11, and the dissociation constant KD of
S protein RBD binding to hACE2 was determined to be in the scale of nM10-12. X-ray
crystal structures of RBD had been solved in complex with the hACE2 receptor,
revealing essential interactions on the binding surface13-14.
As cell entry is the very first step of virus infection, blocking the binding of S protein
to hACE2 can potentially prevent virus transmission. Many developing therapeutics
are based on this concept. Monoclonal neutralizing antibodies separated from
convalescent patient showed complete competition with RBD and can reduce virus
titers in infected lungs in a mouse model7. Recombinant vaccine that comprises
residues from the S protein RBD was shown to induce functional antibody response in
immunized animals15. What’s more, de novo protein inhibitors with KD of
picomolar-level has been designed to neutralize the virus by targeting S protein
RBD8-9.
While therapeutics relying on the RBD binding surface require the surface to be
consistent enough, SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is known to have high mutation
rate. According to reported data, 196 missense mutations in the gene encoding the
RBD domain have been discovered16. Although most mutants on the RBD domains
were determined to be less infectious, some variants indeed became resistant to
neutralizing antibodies17. We are interested in finding RBD mutants with higher
affinity, which may escape future treatments.
In-silico affinity maturation technology is widely used in protein engineering and
antibody discovery18. Rosetta Flex ddG method is a ddG estimation method
developed within the Rosetta macromolecule modeling suite. The ddG represents the
difference in protein-protein interaction strength upon mutation. The protocol
generates an ensemble of models to include conformational plasticity around a
specific/given mutation site and then calculates the average ddG over the ensemble.
This method has been shown to outperform previous methods, and considerable
improvement on predicting binding-stabilizing mutations was observed19.
In this article, Rosetta Flex ddG protocol was used to predict the binding affinity
change of point mutations on the RBD binding surface. Candidate mutants with large
negative predicted ddG score were selected for further experimental validation. 6 of
the 9 recommended mutants shows improved affinity to hACE2 in SPR affinity assay.

Results and Discussion
Mutations with increased binding affinity are accurately predicted through
Rosetta Flex ddG and validated by SPR assay
Rosetta Flex ddG calculation was carried out for 25 residues on the RBD binding
surface. For each residue, the wild type (WT) amino acid was mutated to the other 19
natural amino acids individually and Flex ddG calculation was applied. 48 models for
each mutant were generated and the ddG score were averaged over 48 models. In all
475 possible single point mutants (25 times 19), 114 mutants have negative ddG score,
which implies potential mutations with improved affinity. The lowest predicted ddG
score was -3.66 REU (Rosetta Energy Unit) from mutation Q498W. Mutants with
large negative ddG values were examined manually and 9 mutants were selected for
SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) assay. The selected mutants and their
corresponding predicted ddG scores are shown in Table1.

are shown in Figure S4. The experimental KD are reported in Table1. 6 of the 9
selected mutants with predicted elevated binding affinity have lower KD to hACE2
than WT RBD in SPR assay. The prediction accuracy is comparable to that reported in
previous work19. Among the 9 selected mutants, the best binder is mutation Q493M
with a KD of 6.90 nM, showing a 3-fold improvement in affinity compared with that
of WT. There is a modest Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.41 between predicted
ddG and SPR measured KD (Figure S2).

a 1:1 binding model is shown in red lines.
Among the 5 RBD sites (477, 493, 498, 500 and 505) which give affinity-increased
mutants, 4 of them were identified as key residues interacting with hACE2 (493, 498,
500 and 505)14 and 3 of them were SARS-CoV-2 unique mutants different from
SARS-CoV-1 (477, 493 and 498)13 in previous research. The increased affinity
coupled with those mutations shows that the key residues in natural binding pattern
aren’t necessarily optimized for binding. And even after evolution towards more
potent binding, there is still great capacity for increased binding affinity.
Analysis of mutant structures indicates the stabilizing interaction mainly come
from newly formed hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions
To explain the affinity-increase effect in mutants, we analyzed the interface characters
other than dG_cross reported by Rosetta InterfaceAnalyzeMover. We chose to analyze
the hbond_int (count of hydrogen bonds crossing the interface) and the dSASA
(buried solvent accessible area at the interface, Å2) as those terms are closely related
to dG_cross value. In Table 2, each term was calculated by averaging over the 48
difference between the reported values of the WT model and the mutant model.

residue forms a hydrogen bond with hACE2 38D (Figure 2b). The Q498W mutation
also increases hydrophobic contact with nearby residues, as indicated by the
increment of hydrophobic SASA surface. For the Q498R mutant, in most of the
mutant models, 498R forms hydrogen bond with hACE2 42N (Figure 2c), and in
some of the models also with hACE2 38D (Figure 2d). This phenomenon could be
explained by the fact that the longer hydrophobic part of arginine compared with
glutamine could afford increased hydrophobic interaction. On average, there are 1.65
additional interface hydrogen bonds formed after mutation which may contribute to
the increasing affinity. S477H mutation forms a new hydrogen bond with the terminal
NH2 group of hACE2 19S (Figure 2e) according to the mutant model. Calculation
result shows that additional 0.77 hydrogen bond formed in average along with
increased hydrophobic interaction. For the Y505W mutant, the model shows hydrogen
bond has no contribution. In the original crystal structure of WT, 505Y doesn’t form
any hydrogen bond with other residues. The mutation Y505W is likely increasing the
affinity by evolving to bear better hydrophobic contact (Figure 2f), as shown in the
increase of hydrophobic interactions. For the T500R mutant, the dominant factor is
newly formed hydrogen bond interaction which is similar to Q498R mutant. The WT
500T forms a hydrogen bond with 41Y (Figure 2g). In the best mutant model, T500R
forms hydrogen bond with hACE2 329E and 330N (Figure 2h), while in some other
model T500R only forms hydrogen bonds to 330N (Figure 2i). The Q493M mutant is
the only affinity-increase mutant with significant decrease in hydrogen bond count.
493Q in WT originally forms a hydrogen bond with hACE2 35E (Figure 2j). The van
de vaals contact increases significantly when mutating to a hydrophobic residue like
methionine (Figure 2k), indicated by the large dSASA_hphobic in Table 2.
According to above analysis, the enhanced interaction mainly come from additional
hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The Q493M mutant also reveal that the
hydrophobic term itself can be sufficient for leaning the equilibrium to more potent
binding.
The false positive predictions are possibly due to inaccurate estimation of
hydrogen bond interaction
3 of the 9 mutants (T500W, N501V and Y489W) are predicted to stabilize the
interaction, however according to the SPR experiment result they are neutral or
destabilizing. Next, we try to analyze the Flex ddG energy terms and structure model
to elucidate the reason of the incorrect prediction. For the mutant T500W, the increase
of SASA_hphobic is the dominant factor to binding. However, the mutation to W
destroy the hydrogen bond between 500T and hACE2 41Y as shown in T500R
(Figure 2g, Figure 3a). Although in most of the WT model this hydrogen bonding
pattern was well preserved, the hydrogen bond count didn’t show this adverse factor
as significant, with only a decrease of 0.08. This probably leads to wrong estimation
of binding affinity. For the mutant N501V, in the crystal structure of N501 WT, 501N
adopted the rotamer with the NH2 of the amide pointing at hACE2 41Y, which forms
a hydrogen bond (Figure 3b). However, in most WT structure model generated after

backrub (a method to perturbate protein backbone to generate an ensemble of
conformations), the oxygen atom of the amide points to 41Y instead with an O-O
distance of 3.6 Å (Figure 3c). Therefore, the ddG calculation did not consider the
destruction of the hydrogen bond, which is verified in the zero hbond count difference.
For the mutant Y489W (Figure 3e), the situation is similar to N501V. In the crystal
structure, the hydroxy oxygen of 489W is within 3.5 Å of hACE2 83Y (Figure 3f).
However, in most WT models generated by backrub, the distance is larger than 3.7 Å
(Figure 3g), resulting in loss of consideration for this hydrogen bond impact in the
final ddG score.

By analyzing the models of false positive predictions, we illustrated that the main

error may come from the broken of hydrogen bonds which are not considered in the
ddG calculation. The missing hydrogen bond may be existing hydrogen bond in the
scoring step and the hydrogen bond destroyed in the previous relaxing step. Visual
examination of the model structure to see whether the original hydrogen bond is
disrupted and comparing with the predicted surface properties may help spot those
inaccuracies and exclude some false positive instance before wet-lab experiments.
The predicted binding affinity modestly agrees with deep mutational scanning
(DMS) results
Starr et al. has systematically changed every amino acid in the S protein RBD and
determined the mutation effects on hACE2 binding using deep mutational scanning
method20. Although this high throughput method using flow cytometry has some
contradict results compared with our SPR results (Figure S3), it is nevertheless a
valuable data set to evaluate our Flex ddG prediction. Plotting log (KD,mut/KD,wt)
measured by DMS versus predicted ddG gives Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.37
(Figure 4).

Using the result measured by DMS as the ground truth, the prediction performance of

stabilizing mutation is 0.18, and the recall is 0.50 given a ratio of 40/432 stabilized

and destabilizing mutations, which shows the potential of the Flex ddG method to
suggest stabilized mutations for enhanced binding affinity (Table S1).

Conclusion
In this article, we utilized the Rosetta Flex ddG protocol to predict mutations on the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding surface that can strengthen its interaction to hACE2. SPR
experiments confirmed 6 of the 9 predicted mutations had increased affinity, with the
best mutation showed a 3-fold improvement of KD.
The SARS-CoV-2 mutants carrying the mutation Y453F were discovered in Denmark
to circulate between human and minks and have brought up concerns recently21-22.
Our prediction (-0.30 REU, supplementary material) and the deep mutational scan
results20 both shows that the Y453F mutation will strengthen the interaction between
RBD to hACE2, which is consistent with the maintained transmissibility and
pathogenicity. Although more studies on the potential effect on treatment, diagnostic
test and virus antigenicity are still ongoing, preliminary results showed that the
Cluster-5 strain which carries another 3 mutations outside the RBD domains was
more difficult to be recognized by convalescent sera23. It is also a concern that
spreading of the virus in minks may bring up more fatal variants.
The still-mutating SARS-CoV-2 alerts us of the need of an efficient mechanism in
dealing with newly discovered pathogens. For such RNA virus under constant
mutagenesis, it is necessary to quickly spot possible mutants with increased
pathogenicity or infectivity. Given the relatively low cost and short period of
computational methods, we can build a computational forecast system on virus
pathogenicity in the early stage of a virus breakout. The Flex ddG method used in this
work would be a constructive part in this system, predicting pathogenicity by
evaluating mutant binding affinity to cell receptor. The mutations on the binding
surface are especially essential in vaccine or antibody development and the predicted
mutations can be considered in designing multi valent vaccine to prevent possible
immune escape.
Furthermore, in-silico affinity maturation itself is a promising technology in the
development of macromolecule drugs. For instance, it can help reduce the scale of
experimental screening in optimizing the affinity of peptide or protein drugs. Our
work demonstrated the ability of the previously reported Flex ddG method to serve as
an efficient affinity maturation method in predicting stabilizing mutants with no need
for the time-consuming MD process. We anticipate that combined with machine
learning and deep learning technology, Rosetta Flex ddG-based in-silico affinity
maturation can be improved to be faster and more accurate in the near future.

The S protein RBD-hACE2 complex structure was downloaded from PDB database
(PDB ID 6M0J)13. The structure was relaxed using Rosetta FastRelax Mover. Resfiles
describing saturate point mutation were generated for each residue on the S protein
within 8 Å of S protein and hACE2 interface in the relaxed structure. The Flex ddG
protocol defined in previous literature19 was refactored for in-house high-performance
computing platform, and implemented using pyRosetta API (Figure S1). For each
mutant defined by a resfile, backrub sampling was applied around the mutation site.
The structure was then allowed to repack and relax globally with both the WT and the
mutant. The binding energy dG_cross was calculated using the
InterfaceAnalyzerMover, and the dG_cross difference between the mutant and the WT
model was taken as ddG. 48 independent ddG calculations were perform for each
mutant. The mutants were sorted according to their average ddG score. After
subsequent manual examination of top scored structures, 9 structures were selected
for further SPR wet-lab experimental validation.

single-cycle mode. SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (RBD His Tag) and its mutants were
immobilized to an mSAM sensor chip (Planar Polyethylene Glycol/Carboxyl Sensor
Chip P/N 13206061) at approximately 500 response units. The experiment data were
obtained at 25°C with running buffer PBST (8 mM Na2HPO4, 136 mM NaCl, 2 mM
KH2PO4, 2.6 mM KCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH7.4). Gradient concentrations of
hACE2 (from 100 nM to 6.25 nM with 2-fold dilution) were then flowed over the
chip surface. The resulting data were fit to a 1:1 binding model using Scrubber and
Clamp software. Kinetic rate constant ka and kd were calculated from the above
analysis and the apparent KD was calculated as kd / ka.
Plasmid construction, protein expression and purification
The receptor binding domain (RBD, corresponding to Spike 319-514AA) of spike
protein of SARS-COV-2 have been previously codon optimized and synthesized into
pTT5 vector (EcoRI + BamHI) through PCR based overlapping oligonucleotides
assembly. Kozak sequence was inserted before start codon to enhance translational
efficiency. To obtain the secreted RBD protein, a mouse V-set immunoregulatory
receptor signal peptide was fused to the N-terminus of the protein (1-32,
MGVPAVPEASSPRWGTLLLAIFLAASRGLVAA). Ten mutations were introduced
using primers with the desired mutation in a PCR protocol which amplifies the entire
plasmid template (the above clone as the template). Restriction enzyme digestion and
Sanger sequencing confirmed that all 10 clones were correct.

The mutated RBD proteins were prepared using the Expi293 Expression System
(Code: A14635). The specific operation was performed following the kit instruction.
Expi293F cells were maintained in serum-free Expi293 Expression Medium, and the
Expression plasmid transfected into Expi293 cells by using an ExpiFectamine 293
Transfection Kit (all from Gibco). Five days after transfection the medium was
collected, and the protein was purified by Ni-NTA (QIAGEN) column
chromatography (nonspecifically binding contaminants were washed on Ni-NTA
column using PBS, pH 7.4 containing 20 mM imidazole and eluted with PBS, pH 7.4
supplemented with 300 mM imidazole.). The eluted fractions were pooled and
dialyzed against PBS (pH7.4) to remove the imidazole. Purified proteins were
checked by SDS-PAGE and protein concentrations were quantified using Nano-Drop.
