Abstract

Recently a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China and has infected more
than 571000 people leading to more than 26000 deaths. Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes
based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs.
Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might
regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host
cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in
the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses
(SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is

significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared
to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS
reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling
pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar “GA” rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that
was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we
successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both
these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2
genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We
identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute

towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these
viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for
development of new antivirals.

Introduction

Coronaviruses are the group of enveloped viruses with positive-sense single stranded RNA as the
genetic material. These viruses cause mild to severe respiratory and intestinal infections in immune
compromised individuals. They were not considered to be pathogenic until the outbreak of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) in Middle East countries in 2002 and 2012 respectively when the viral infection led
to significant deaths among the infected individuals [1]. Human coronaviruses have been shown to
be rapidly evolving due to high genomic nucleotide substitution rate as well as recombination [2].
Apart from evolution, viral transmission is further fuelled by rapid urbanisation and close animal
human encounters. One of the examples of pathogenicity and transmission of coronavirus is its

recent outbreak in Wuhan city, China. Since the outbreak of the virus in December 2019, in Wuhan,
China, people infected with this mysterious new coronavirus are escalating fast. As of 30 March
2020, more than 693000 people were infected and around 33100 people died around the globe [3].
Based on phylogenetic and taxonomy data, SARS-CoV-2 was recently shown to form a sister clade
with SARS coronavirus [4]. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS genomes have been shown to be
similar, we sought to investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 by predicting miRNAs
regulating their pathogenesis as well as taking clues from the published study on SARS encoded
non-coding RNAs [5].
MicroRNAs are known to regulate diverse biological pathways including various steps in viral

replication [6]. Hence, we studied the role of host miRNAs in regulating viral replication by
predicting the host miRNA binding sites among the genome of these viruses. In order to gain in
depth understanding into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, we analysed all genomes of SARSCoV-2 (n=52) that were available for download till 07 March 2020 (Supplementary figure 1).
SARS reference genome was used for comparison and the analysis was performed on both the
forward and reverse sequences of viral genomes. For prediction of host miRNAs that could bind to
viral genomes, miRDB algorithm was used [7-8]. The analysis was performed in custom mode
where user defined sequences can be uploaded and processed. All the analysis were done at default
settings and only those miRNAs were studied further that had a target score >= 80. Using this

approach, around 263 and 196 host miRNAs were identified that could target each of the forward
and reverse SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences (Fig1a, Supplementary table 2). Similar analysis on
SARS reference genome identified 174 and 120 host miRNAs that could bind to forward and
reverse sequences respectively (Fig1a, Supplementary table 2). The analysis further revealed that
number of host miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomes (both forward and reverse genomes)
were significantly higher as compared to number of miRNAs targeting SARS reference genome.
Despite the dissimilarity among number of host miRNAs targeting viral genomes, we observed that

86 common host miRNAs could target all the SARS-CoV-2 forward and SARS forward reference

genome whereas 61 common host miRNAs were found to be targeting all the SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS reverse genome (Supplementary table 3). Comparison of all the forward and reverse
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome revealed 10 host miRNAs that could target
all the genomes being studied and hence could be potentially used as broad acting antivirals (Fig
1b, 1c).
Several viruses have been shown to regulate host signaling pathways by encoding miRNAs in their
genomes. Hence, in order to gain insights into various miRNAs encoded by genomes of SARSCoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses, a set of computational tools were used to predict miRNAs
encoded by these viruses. Since hairpin loops forms the precursor of small RNAs, miRNAFold

algorithm was used first to predict loops in viral genomes [9,10]. The algorithm predicted around
574 and 550 hairpin loops in each SARS-CoV-2 forward and reverse genomes respectively, 573
and 575 hairpin loops in SARS forward and reverse genome respectively. Since all hairpin loops
does not result in functional miRNAs, miRBoost algorithm was then used to identify whether the
hairpin structures could yield functional microRNA or not [11]. The algorithm successfully
predicted around 66 miRNAs in each of SARS-CoV-2 forward genome, 64 miRNAs in each of
SARS-CoV-2 reverse genome, 89 miRNAs in SARS forward genome and 79 miRNAs in SARS
reverse genome. Using the above mentioned algorithms we successfully identified some of the
potential viral encoded miRNAs which can be used by the viruses to modulate host signaling

pathways. Then we utilized mirBase algorithm to study whether our predicted miRNAs had any
similarity to human encoded miRNAs or not [12-16]. Interestingly, we observed that out of 65
sequences that were predicted by miRBoost, mirBase identified 56 miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2
forward genome sequence that matched to human specific miRNAs. Similarly out of 64 miRNAs
predicted in SARS-CoV-2 reverse genome, 39 matched to human specific miRNAs. The algorithm
further matched 66 and 33 miRNAs to humans from a repertoire of 89 and 79 predicted miRNAs
among forward and reverse SARS genomes (fig 1d, Supplementary sheet 4). We then compared all
the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS for identification of any common virus encoded miRNA.
Contrary to our expectation, we did not find any virus encoded miRNA which was common to

forward and reverse genomes of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 (fig 1e).
Recently, deep sequencing based approaches were used to identify SARS encoded non-coding
RNAs which were then shown to play a critical role in SARS induced lung pathology [5]. The
authors successfully identified a set of non-coding RNAs that were produced during SARS
infections. The authors further characterized a “GA” rich region that was enriched in non-coding
RNAs produced during SARS infection. Hence, we aimed to analyse SARS-CoV-2 genomic
sequences for the identification of similar non-coding RNAs with a rationale that presence of

similar sequences in SARS-CoV-2 might predict about the pathogenesis of the virus. Our approach

revealed presence of a very similar “GA” stretch in SARS-CoV-2 which was reported in be
enriched in SARS encoded non-coding RNAs. We then analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes for the
presence of non-coding RNAs that were shown to be produced in during SARS pathology. Our
comparative analysis of both viral genomes revealed that SARS-CoV-2 had very similar stretches
compared to SARS encoded non-coding RNAs (figure 2). Interestingly, it was also observed that all
the 52 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were highly conserved in the regions that encoded non-coding RNAs
suggesting their critical role in viral pathology.
To summarize, our study identified various host and viral encoded miRNAs that could potentially
regulate viral pathogenesis. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 genomes had binding sites for

more number of host miRNAs as compared to SARS genomes which might translate to low
pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy individuals. Similarly, though SARS-CoV-2 and SARS
genomes differed in terms of miRNA targets, however, there was a stark similarity among virus
encoded non-coding RNAs in both the genomes thereby suggesting towards a possible overlap
among pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses and providing an opportunity to develop
new therapeutics that might successfully regulate both the viruses.
