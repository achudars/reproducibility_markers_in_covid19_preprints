Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind the COVID-19 pandemic, and responsible for over 100 million infections, and over
2 million deaths worldwide. Efforts to test, treat and vaccinate
against this pathogen all benefit from an improved understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2. Both viral and cellular
proteases play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and inhibitors targeting proteases have already shown success at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models. Here, we study
proteolytic cleavage of viral and cellular proteins in two cell line
models of SARS-CoV-2 replication using mass spectrometry to
identify protein neo-N-termini generated through protease activity. We identify previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N,
which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts. We discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage
events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease,
and identify 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main
and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with in vitro assays. We showed that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr
kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARSCoV-2 titres. Overall, our study provides a powerful resource to
understand proteolysis in the context of viral infection, and to
inform the development of targeted strategies to inhibit SARSCoV-2 and treat COVID-19 disease.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 emerged into the human population in late
2019, as the latest human coronavirus to cause severe dis-

ease following the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERSCoV over the preceding decades (1, 2). Efforts to develop
vaccines and therapeutic agents to treat COVID-19 disease
are well underway, however it is widely expected that this
first generation of treatments might provide imperfect protection from disease. As such, in-depth characterisation of
the virus and its interactions with the host cell can inform
current and next-generation efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Past efforts in this area have included the proteome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitome and interactome of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and infected cells
(3–9). Proteolytic cleavage plays a crucial role in the life
cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and indeed most positive-sense RNA
viruses. Inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular proteases
have previously shown the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication in cell culture models (10–13). Here we present a
first unbiased study of proteolysis during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its implications for viral antigens, as well as cellular
proteins that may represent options for antiviral intervention.
Proteolytic cleavage of the two coronavirus polyproteins generates the various viral proteins needed to form a replication
complex, required for transcription and replication of the viral genome and subgenomic mRNAs. The key viral enzymes
responsible are the papain-like (PLP, nsp3) and main proteases (Mpro, nsp5). Aside from cleaving viral substrates,
these enzymes can also act on cellular proteins, modifying or
neutralising substrate activity to benefit the virus. A recent
study highlighted the ability of the viral proteases to cleave
proteins involved in innate immune signaling including IRF3,
NLRP12 and TAB1 (14). However, there has yet to be an unbiased study to identify novel substrates of the coronavirus
proteases in the context of viral infection. The identification

of such substrates can identify cellular enzymes or pathways
required for efficient viral replication that may represent suitable targets for pharmaceutical repurposing and antiviral intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.
Viral proteins can also be the targets of cellular proteases,
with the most prominent example for coronaviruses being
the cleavage of the spike glycoprotein by the cellular proteases furin, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsins (10, 11, 15, 16), but
the exact cleavage sites within spike for most of these individual cellular proteases are not yet characterised. Proteolytic processing can also be observed for other coronavirus
proteins, for example, signal peptide cleavage of SARS-CoV
ORF7A (17) and caspase cleavage of the nucleocapsid protein (18, 19). Many of these viral proteins, and especially the
spike glycoprotein form part of vaccine candidates currently
undergoing clinical trials. For a functional immune response,
it is vital that the antigens presented to the immune system,
as part of these vaccines, closely mimic those seen in natural infection. An understanding of any modifications to these
antigens observed during natural infection, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage, is critical to
enable the rational design and validation of vaccine antigens
and the selection of appropriate systems for their production.
Mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches have already
led to rapid advances in our understanding of SARS-CoV2, with notable examples including the rapid release of the
cellular interactome (6) and proximity interactome (7) for
a majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, as well as proteomic
(3, 5), phosphoproteomic (4, 8) and ubiquitomic analyses (9).
Larger scale-initiatives have been launched focusing on community efforts to profile the immune response to infection,
and provide in-depth characterization of viral antigens (20).
Mass spectrometry has particular advantages for investigation of proteolytic cleavage as analysis can be conducted in
an unbiased manner, and identify not only the substrate, but
the precise site of proteolytic cleavage (21).
In this work we have applied mass spectrometry-based methods for N-terminomics to study proteolysis and the resulting
proteolytic proteoforms generated in the context of SARSCoV-2 infection, enabling the identification of novel cleavage and processing sites within viral proteins. We discovered several of these novel cleavage sites show altered cleavage following treatment with the TMPRSS inhibitor camostat mesylate, and cathepsin/calpain inhibitor calpeptin. We
also identify cleavage sites within cellular proteins that match
the coronavirus protease consensus sequences for Mpro and
PLP, show temporal regulation during infection, are cleaved
in vitro by recombinant Mpro and PLP, and demonstrate these
proteins are required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication.
These SARS-CoV-2 protease substrates include proteins that
can be targeted with drugs in current clinical use to treat other
conditions (22). Indeed, we demonstrate potent inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 replication with two compounds that are wellestablished chemical inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 protease
substrates SRC and myosin light chain kinase (MYLK).

Results
Proteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cell lines
identifies alterations to the N-terminome. To investigate

proteolysis during SARS-CoV-2 infection, N-terminomic
analysis at various timepoints during the course of SARSCoV-2 infected Vero E6 and A549-Ace2 cells (Fig. 1A)
was performed. Vero E6 cells are an African Green Monkey kidney cell line commonly used for the study of a range
of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 which replicates in this
cell line to high titres. A549-Ace2 cells are a human lung
cell line which has been transduced to overexpress the ACE2
receptor to allow for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Cells were infected
in biological triplicates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 1, and harvested at 4 timepoints (0, 6, 12 and 24h) postinfection. Mock-infected samples were collected at 0 and
24h post-infection. These timepoints were chosen to cover
SARS-CoV-2 infection from virus entry, over replication to
virus egress: RNA levels increased from 9h post-infection
(Fig. 1B), protein levels showed steady increases throughout
infection (Fig. 1C), and viral titres increased at the 24h timepoint (Fig. 1D). These features were shared in both cell lines,
with the Vero E6 cells showing greater RNA and protein levels, as well as viral titres compared with the A549-Ace2 cells.
Analysis of the N-termini-enriched samples was performed
by LC-MS/MS following basic reverse phase fractionation.
For the purposes of this analysis, neo-N-termini were taken
to be those beginning at amino acid 2 in a given protein or
later. By this definition these neo-N-termini will include
those with post-translational removal of methionine, signal
peptide cleavage, as well as those cleaved by viral or cellular
proteases. The modified N-terminomic enrichment strategy
used (21) employed isobaric labelling (TMTpro) for quantification as this permitted all samples to be combined prior
to enrichment, minimising sample variability. This strategy meant that only those peptides with a TMTpro-labelled
N-terminus or lysine residue were quantified. As only unblocked N-termini are labelled with undecanal, this approach
results in the selective retention of undecanal-tagged tryptic
peptides on C18 in acidified 40% ethanol, with N-terminal
and neo-N-terminal peptides enriched in the unbound fraction (21).
Quality filtering of the dataset was performed (Fig. S1), infected and mock samples separated by PCA and 0h Mock, 0h
infected and 6h infected clustered together, and away from
the 12h and 24h infected samples (Fig. S1A-D). With the
exception of the enriched Vero E6 dataset the 24h mock sample clustered with the 0h mocks. The Vero E6 24h Mock
clustered away from the 0h and infected samples which may
reflect regulation due to cell confluence as this was not observed with the paired unenriched sample. Sample preparation successfully enriched for blocked N-termini consisting of acetylated, pyroglutamate-N-termini and TMTprolabelled N-termini (Fig. S1), and blocked N-termini were
more abundant in the enriched samples. In both datasets,
TMTpro-labelled N-termini represent approximately 50% of
the blocked N-termini, with the rest split evenly between pyroglutamate and N-terminal acetylation (Fig. S1). After filMeyer et al.

tering, over 2700 TMTpro-labelled N-termini representing
neo-N-termini were identified from each cell line.
When the 24h infected and mock-infected timepoints were
compared, both cellular and viral neo-N-termini in A549Ace2 cells (Fig. 1) and Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1F) were identified
as showing significant alterations in their abundance. In line
with expectation, N-termini from viral proteins were solely
identified as showing increased abundance during infection in
both cell lines. N-termini from cellular proteins showed both
increased and decreased abundance during infection. We reasoned that those neo-N-termini showing increased abundance
would include viral neo-N-termini, as well as those cellular
proteins cleaved by the SARS-CoV-2 PLP and Mpro proteases. For this study we therefore focused specifically on
viral N-termini and those cellular neo-N-termini identified as
showing significantly increased abundance (t-test, multiple
hypothesis testing corrected Q value ≤ 0.05) during infection.
Novel proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV-2 proteins
is observed during infection. The 30kb SARS-CoV-2

genome encodes a large number of proteins including two
long polyproteins formed through ribosomal frameshifting,
the structural proteins S, E, M and N and a range of accessory
proteins (Fig. 2). Coronavirus proteins, in line with those of
other positive-sense RNA viruses are known to undergo posttranslational modifications, including proteolytic cleavage in
some cases. Across all datasets we identified the S, M and N
structural proteins, with the exception of E which has also not
been observed in other proteomics datasets due to both short
length and sequence composition (3, 5). We identified the
ORF3a, ORF6, ORF8 and ORF9b accessory proteins, and all
domains of the polyprotein aside from nsp6, 7 and 11.
We first sought to characterise neo-N-termini from viral proteins to understand potential patterns of cleavage that might

generate functional proteolytic protoforms of the viral proteins. Neo- and N-termini were identified from 8 viral proteins including the polyprotein (Fig. 2B-D; Fig. S2). Of
these the nucleocapsid (N), ORF3a accessory protein and
spike were most prominent. More cleavage sites were observed from infected Vero E6 cells than A549-Ace2 cells,
which is in line with expectation given the higher levels of
viral protein expression, and superior infectivity of this cell
line compared to the A549-Ace2 cell line.
The coronavirus N protein is highly expressed during infection, and also represents a major antigen detected by the host
immune response. Prior studies have identified cleavage of
the SARS-CoV N protein by cellular proteases (18, 19), and
our data identified multiple neo-N-termini consistent with
proteolytic cleavage from both infected A549-Ace2 and Vero
E6 cells (Fig. 2B). neo-N-termini common to both datasets
include amino acids 17, 19, 69, 71, 76, 78, 154, and 263.
Many of these cleavage sites were spaced closely together
(e.g. 17/19, 69/71), consistent with a degree of further exoproteolytic processing. Some of these cleavage sites have
subsequently been identified as autolysis products following
extended incubations with N in vitro.
The ORF3a putative viroporin also shows N-terminal processing, possibly reflecting signal peptide cleavage (Fig. 2C).
In a recent study, cryoEM of ORF3a in lipid nanodiscs did
not resolve the first 39 N-terminal suggesting this region is
unstructured (24). We observed N-terminal processing sites
in the first 22 residues of the protein, with neo-N-termini
beginning at amino acids, 10, 13 and 16 identified in both
datasets, giving a possible explanation for the lack of Nterminal amino acids in cryoEM experiments.
Proteolytic cleavage of the spike glycoprotein is of major interest as it can play an important role in cell entry, with different distributions of cellular proteases between cell types

resulting in the usage of different entry pathways, as well as
potentially changing availability of surface epitopes for antibody recognition. Key proteases include furin, TMPRSS2
and cathepsins, though in the latter two cases the actual cleavage sites targeted by these enzymes to process spike into S1
and S2 remain unclear. Consistent with previous observations (3, 5), we do not detect a neo-N-terminus deriving from
the furin cleavage site as the trypsin digestion we employed
would not be expected to yield peptides of suitable length
for analysis. However, while beneficial for replication, furin cleavage is not essential and other cleavage events within
spike can compensate (15, 16). We detect neo-N-terminal
peptides from S637 in both datasets (Fig. 2D). In line with
the pattern of viral gene expression observed in the unenriched datasets this neo-N-terminus showed consistent increases in abundance throughout the experimental timecourse
(Fig. 2E). S637 is located on a flexible loop near the furin
cleavage site (Fig. 2F), suggesting it is accessible for protease cleavage (25). A mass spectrum for the S637 neo-Nterminus from the A549-Ace2 dataset is shown in Fig. 2G,
the same peptide was observed with both 2+ and 3+ charge
states in the Vero E6 dataset, and with a higher Andromeda
score (124.37 vs. 104.82). Intriguing, S637 was identified as

a phosphorylation site in Davidson et al. (3). As phosphorylation can inhibit proteolytic cleavage when close the the
cleavage site, this suggests potential post-translational regulation of this cleavage event.
Further neo-N-termini from spike were identified in the Vero
E6 dataset alone, including a neo-N-terminus beginning at
Q14. This is slightly C-terminal of the predicted signal peptide which covers the first 12 amino acids. This peptide featured N-terminal pyroglutamic acid formed by cyclization of
the N-terminal glutamine residue. The peptide does not follow an R or K residue in the spike amino acid sequence and
thus represents non-tryptic cleavage. The absence of TMTpro labelling at the N-terminus suggests that this N-terminus
was blocked prior to tryptic digestion, with this modified Nterminus preventing TMTpro modification. Artifactual cyclization of N-terminal glutamine or glutamic acid residues
typically results from extended trypsin digestion and acidic
conditions (26). However, the order of labelling and digestion steps in our protocol, and non-tryptic nature of this peptide suggests that this N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue
is an accurate reflection of the state of this neo-N-terminus
in the original biological sample. Three further N-terminal
pyroglutamic acid residues were identified in SARS-CoV-2

proteins within the Vero E6 dataset and can be found in table
S2.
We detected viral neo-N-termini and N-termini in M, ORF7a,
ORF9b and pp1ab. Due to conservation with SARS-CoV
ORF7a, the first 15 residues of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a are
expected to function as a signal peptide which is posttranslationally cleaved (17, 27). neo-N-termini were identified in both datasets consistent with this hypothesis. Due
to inclusion of the ORF7a iORF1 proposed N-terminal truncation of ORF7a which lacks the first two amino acids in
ORF7a in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences used for data analysis, the start position of this neo-N-terminal peptide is given
as 14 (28). However, this would be position 16 in ORF7a,
consistent with removal of the signal peptide (MKIILFLALITLATC , in Uniprot P0DTC7), and conserved with that in
SARS-CoV ORF7a.
The native N-terminus of ORF9b was also identified, and several sites mapping to the replicase polyprotein, including a
conserved neo-N-terminus consistent with predicted nsp10nsp12 cleavage by Mpro. A neo-N-terminus consistent with
nsp15-nsp16 cleavage by Mpro was identified in A549-Ace2
cells, and several internal neo-N-termini deriving from nsp1,
-2 and -3 were also observed, though not common to both
datasets. All the viral neo-N-termini and N-termini identified in this study can be found in tables S1 (A549-Ace2) and
S2 (Vero E6) respectively. Table S3 includes all viral peptides identified in this study in both enriched and unenriched
datasets.
Novel SARS-CoV-2 cleavage sites are sensitive to
calpeptin and a mutation proximal to the 637 cleavage site results in a higher fraction of cleaved spike in
purified pseudovirus and enhanced cell entry. The N-

terminomics experiments above successfully identified multiple previously uncharacterised proteolytic cleavage sites
within viral proteins. However, we have limited information
on the identity of the causal proteases behind these cleavage events. To address this, we performed a further Nterminomics experiment comparing the relative abundance
of these cleavage sites and viral proteins following treatment
with specific protease inhibitors Fig. 3A. The first, camostat mesylate is currently in clinical trials to treat COVID-19
disease and acts on TMPRSS2. The second, calpeptin inhibits cathepsin and calpain cleavage. The experiment was
performed in Vero E6 cells as the majority of viral cleavage sites identified in the first dataset were found in this cell
line. Inhibitors were added at 12h post-infection with the aim
of reducing proteolytic cleavage rather than inhibiting virus
replication per se by permitting viral replication to proceed
unimpeeded for the first 12h. Samples were then harvested at
24h post-infection Fig. 3A.
Quality control of this dataset against showed tight clustering of the relevent samples, with infected samples clustering
away from the mock-infected cells Fig. S3A,B. This dataset
identified fewer quantifiable N-termini Fig. S3C-F, but these
included the key cleavage sites in S and N.
Analysis of viral protein levels showed that when added at
this late time post-infection viral protein levels were simiMeyer et al.

ilar but did show some differences with the untreated infected samples Fig. S3G. ORF9B showed significantly reduced abundance in protease inhibitor-treated infected cells
compared to infected but untreated cells (Camostat: t-test, p
= 0.0031; Calpeptin: t-test, p = 0.0012). ORF3A showed
significantly increased abundance compared to untreatedinfected cells in the camostat-treated cells alone (t-test, p =
0.0016). Neither N or S showed significant changes in their
abundance with either inhibitor treatment.
Neo-N-termini corresponding to viral proteins were normalised to the abundance of the viral protein from which
the neo-N-terminus was derived and can be seen in Fig. 3B.
The largest changes were observed following calpeptin treatment, resulting in significantly reduced abundance of neoN-termini beginning at N(19),S(260) and S(637). Both neoN-termini from S (260, 637) showed increased abundance
following treatment with camostat compared to untreated infected cells (t-test, p = 0.0074 and 0.0288 respectively). Two
neo-N-termini within N (78, 286) show increased abundance
in the calpeptin-treated infected cells (t-test, p = 0.0045,
0.0120). Reduced abundance of neo-N-termini following
calpeptin inhibibion (e.g. N(19), S(260, 637)) is consistent
with cleavage of these sites by cathepsin which is known to
cleave S(10). The enhanced cleavage of these sites following addition of camostat in Vero E6 cells suggests some increased diversion of S and N down a cathepsin-dependent
cleavage pathway under conditions which inhibit TMPRSS2
and Trypsin. The Vero E6 cell line used does not overexpress
TMPRSS2 so is generally held to be camostat-insensitive
(11). However, while it may not target TMPRSS2 specifically
in this cell line, clearly there is some alteration of proteolytic
activity following camostat treatment.
The same data lacking normalisation to total viral protein levels can be seen in Fig. S3H. As expected given the lack of
significant changes to total N and S protein levels, all sites
highlighted in the previous paragraph maintained their direction of change relative to mock, and remained t-test significant in this unnormalised dataset (p < 0.05).
As a majority of these cleavage sites within viral proteins are
novel, we lack a functional understanding of their role in viral infection. We sought to examine the importance of several of the novel cleavage sites found within the spike glycoprotein by mutating residues proximal to the cleavage sites
and assessing their functions in a pseudovirus entry assay,
utilising pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Given our observed
cleavage at Q14 we generated a S13A mutation, altering the
P1 residue in this cleavage site following the nomenclature
of Schechter and Berger (29). For the cleavage sites at 637
and 671, given that cathepsin is known to cleave spike (10),
and indeed the site at 637 showed sensitivity to calpeptin, a
calpain and cathepsin inhibitor, we sought to modify cleavage through mutagenesis of the P2 residue within this cleavage site as the P2 site is considered important for cathepsin
cleavage (30). This approach generated V635G and C671G
mutants. RatG13 spike, a mutant lacking the furin cleavage
site due to a deletion of four residues (∆681-684, ∆PPRA)
was included as an additional control (31).

In HEK-ACE2 cells, both the V635G and RatG13 mutants
showed significantly increased cell entry compared to wildtype (t-test p<0.01), while the C671G mutant showed significantly decreased cell entry (t-test, p<0.0001)Fig. 3C. Entry
for both the S13A and the double V635G/C671G mutant was
not significantly different to wild-type Fig. 3C.
The same pattern was observed in HEK-ACE2-TMPRSS2
cells, though the enhanced cell entry seen for the the V635G
and RatG13 mutants did not reach significance Fig. 3D.
This may reflect reduced importance of the V635G mutation in cells bearing high levels of TMPRSS2.Similarly while
the pattern of partial recovery of the double V635G/C671G
mutant remained visible, its entry remained significantly reduced compared to wild-type Fig. 3D. While reproducible
across multiple independent viral stocks and experiments, the
phenotypes are modest (2-fold change) in both cell types, except for the marked infectivity defect of the C671G mutant.

Western blotting of purified pseudovirus particles confirmed
expression and incorporation of spike Fig. 3E. Notably constructs containing the C671G mutation showed limited incorporation and defective spike processing. While this could
be in part due to cleavage, this cysteine residue is identified
in a disulphide bond in several crystal structures suggesting
that a more likely explanation for the lower entry phenotype
in pseudovirus bearing this mutation is down to defective
protein folding or stability (32). The wild-type, S13A and
V635G mutants all show S0 (uncleaved) and S1 (cleaved)
spike Fig. 3E. Notably the V635G mutant showed significantly increased levels of the cleaved S1, with a near 3:1
ratio of S1 to S0 compared to the wild-type where this is 1:1
Fig. 3F (t-test, p < 0.01). This could reflect either enhanced
cleavage at this location, or increased incorporation of the
cleaved V635G S1 into pseudovirus particles. Of note, the

particles was consistent with the increased infectivity of this
mutant.
SARS-CoV-2 infection induces proteolytic cleavage of
multiple host proteins. The consensus sequences for coro-

navirus proteases are conserved between coronaviruses, with
PLP recognising a P4 to P1 LxGG motif, and Mpro recognising a (A|P|S|T|V)xLQ motif (33). No strong preference
has been identified for either protease at the P3 residue (Fig.
4A). Analysis of both datasets showed strong enrichment for
neo-N-termini consistent with cleavage at Mpro motifs (twotailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p<0.001, Fig. 4B,C). However, no comparable enrichment could be seen for neo-Ntermini consistent with cleavage at PLP motifs (Fig. 4D,E).
This may reflect fewer cellular protein substrates of PLP
compared to Mpro, or higher background levels of neo-Ntermini generated by cellular proteases with similar P4 to P1
cleavage specificities as PLP.
Neo-N-termini matching, or close to the consensus sequences, for either Mpro or PLP and showing significant
upregulation (t-test, q ≤ 0.05 after correction for multiple
hypothesis testing) at 24h post-infection compared to the
24h mock sample were selected for further analysis. Perfect matches to the consensus sequences from A549-Ace2
cells included NUP107, PAICS, PNN, SRC and XRCC1.
GOLGA3 and MYLK (MCLK) were identified from Vero
E6 cells. Hits from both cell lines that resembled, but
did not completely match the consensus sequence were
ATAD2, ATP5F1B, BST1, KAT7, KLHDC10, NUCKS1 and
WNK1 (Fig. 4F, G). Adding confidence to these observations, approximately half of these hits were also identified in a recent SARS-CoV-2 proximity labelling study
(ATP5F1B, GOLGA3, NUP107, PNN, SRC and WNK)(7),
and GOLGA3 was additionally identified in an interactome
study as an nsp13 interaction partner (6).
SRC, MYLK and WNK are all protein kinases, one of the
protein families best studied as drug targets (34). MYLK is
especially interesting as dysregulation of MYLK has been
linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome - one of the
symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease (35). NUP107
is a member of the nuclear pore complex, with nucleocytoplasmic transport a frequent target for viral disregulation
(36). GOLGA3 is thought to play a role in localisation of the
Golgi and Golgi-nuclear interactions, and was identified in
two recent studies of SARS-CoV-2 interactions (6, 7). PNN
is a transcriptional activator, forming part of the exon junction complex, with roles in splicing and nonsense-mediated
decay. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus has previously
been shown to target nonsense mediated decay, with pro-viral
effects of inhibition (37). PAICS and BST1 both encode enzymes with roles in ADP ribose and purine metabolism respectively, with PAICS previously identified as binding the
influenza virus nucleoprotein (38).
The majority of these neo-N-termini showed enrichment at
24h, with levels remaining largely unchanged at earlier timepoints, especially for Mpro substrates (Fig. 4F,G). This
matches the timing for peak viral RNA, protein expression
and titres over the timepoints examined (Fig. 1B-D). ExcepMeyer et al.

tions to this trend include the potential PLP substrates, 2/3
of which begin to show increased abundance at 12h postinfection, with BST1 appearing to peak at 12h rather than
24h, indicating a potential temporal regulation of the two viral proteases. Data for all quantified and filtered N- and neoN-termini from A549-Ace2 and Vero E6 cells is available in
tables S4 and S5 respectively.
We sought to validate a subset of prospective SARS-CoV2 protease substrates in vitro, using the L. tarentolae system previously used to identify cleavage of proteins involved in the immune response by the SARS-CoV-2 proteases (14). For these assays, the target protein is fused (Nor C-terminally) to GFP, which is then imaged directly in
the SDS-PAGE gel. This system sucessfully validated cleavage of PNN, PAICS and SRC by Mpro (PNN, PAICS) and
PLP (SRC) respectively (Fig. 4H). It also indicated additional cleavage products of PNN, and SRC not identified in
the original mass spectrometry study. SRC cleavage was
identified by N-terminomics following a LfGG motif yielding a neo-N-terminus at F67 (Fig. 4F). Two SRC cleavage
products migrate at slightly over 30kDa (including the GFP
tag). The second cleavage product found in vitro migrates
at slightly higher molecular weight, consistent with cleavage
at an LaGG motif 19 amino acids downstream of the first
cleavage site, generating a neo-N-terminus at V86 (Fig. 4,H).
Titration of the amount of PLP included in the reaction resulted in dose-dependent cleavage of SRC Fig. S4.
In addition to a cleavage product consistent with the cleavage
at S114 observed in the N-terminomics migrating between
the 80-115kDa markers, a second cleavage product of PNN
was also identified, migrating at slightly over 50kDa (including the GFP tag)Fig. 4H. However there are multiple candidate cleavage sites located in this portion of PNN that could
explain this cleavage event.
We also validated cleavage of PAICS and GOLGA3 by
SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-based assay. To generate functional
Mpro, a plasmid containing the nsp4-5 sequence was generated, permitting autocleavage at the nsp4-5 junction and generation of an authentic N-terminus for nsp5 (Mpro). Transfection of 293 cells with this construct resulted in cleavage
of PAICS and GOLGA3. Both antibodies recognise the Cterminus of the cleaved proteins. As with the in vitro assay, cleavage of PAICS resulted in the appearence of a single
cleavage product. This assay recognises endogenous rather
than tagged PAICS which is why both uncleaved and cleaved
PAICS have differing apparent molecular weights in Fig. 4H
and I. Anti-GOLGA3 cleavage results in the appearence of a
single-cleavage product at slightly over 70kDa. This may reflect further proteolytic cleavage of this protein given that the
observed cleavage at 365/366 would be expacted to result in a
40k reduction in the apparent molecular weight of GOLGA3
which migrates at slightly over its predicted molecular weight
of 167kDa.

for efficient viral replication, and represent targets for

terminomic analyses are necessary for efficient viral replication, an siRNA screen was conducted Fig. 5. Where
proteolytic cleavage inactivates cellular proteins or pathways inhibitory for SARS-CoV-2 replication, siRNA depletion would be anticipated to result in inreased viral titres

depletion to result in a reduction in viral titres/RNA levels.

down efficiency at the time of infection was confirmed by
qRT-PCR (Fig. S6), with a low of 77% efficiency for
NUCKS1, and averaging over 95% efficiency for most targets.10/14 coronavirus protease substrates showed significant
reductions (one-way ANOVA, p ≤ 0.01) in viral RNA levels, averaging a 100-1000-fold median decrease in viral RNA
equating to pfu equivalents per ml at 72h post-infection compared to treatment with a control siRNA (Fig. 5B). PAICS,
GOLGA3, NUCKS1, and XRCC1 did not show a significant drop in RNA copy number following siRNA treatment.
Plaque assays were then conducted on these samples to determine whether this observed reduction in viral RNA levels reflected a reduction in infectious virus titres (Fig. 5C).
All 14 potential substrates showed a statistically significant
(one-way ANOVA, p ≤ 0.01) reduction in viral titres following siRNA depletion. For PAICS and GOLGA3, which did
not show reduced RNA levels, these reductions were approximately 10-fold. Most other siRNA targets showed reduced
titres in the 100-1000-fold range. These differences in outcome between viral RNA levels and plaque assays may result
from a subset of proteins required for efficient viral replication. While efficient mRNA knockdown was shown for all
targets Fig. S6, it is also possible that this discrepancy between viral RNA levels and titres may result from differences
in protein half-life of the knockdown targets. This could result in proteins with longer half lives only giving a phenotype
at later stages of infection when infectious virus is produced.
A subset of the prospective viral protease substrates have
commercially-available inhibitors, notably SRC and MYLK.
In the case of SRC these include tyrosine kinase inhibitors
in current clinical use. In light of the siRNA screening results we concluded that pharmacological inhibition of SARSCoV-2 protease substrates could represent a viable means to
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dose-response experiments

could be employed as a potential therapeutic strategy (Fig. 6;
Fig. S7). Of these, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors: Bafetinib
and Sorafenib showed inhibition at concentrations which did
not result in cytotoxicity in the human cell line A549-Ace2
(Fig. 6). In the case of Bafetinib, a Lyn/Bcr-Abl inhibitor
which has off-target activity against SRC the IC50 was in
the nanomolar range (IC50 : 0.79 µM, 95% confidence interval 0.23-1.35 µM). Bafetinib has recently been independently identified as an inhibitor of the coronaviruses OC43
and SARS-COV-2 in a large-scale drug-repurposing screen
(39). Inhibition with Sorafenib which was included as a positive control and does not directly target any of the protease
substrates was in the low micromolar range (Fig. 6), in line
with a previously published report (4). Two inhibitors were
trialed against MYLK. These were MLCK inhibitor peptide
18, and ML-7. Only ML-7 showed inhibition of SARS-CoV2, with inhibition in the low micromolar range (IC50 : 1.7
µM, 95% confidence interval 1.51-1.80 µM), at concentrations which did not induce cytotoxicity (Fig. 6; Fig. S8).
ML-7 and MLCK inhibitor peptide 18 have different mechanisms of action, with MLCK inhibitor peptide 18 outcompeting kinase substrate peptides, and ML-7 inhibiting ATPase
activity. All four had CC50 values over the 10µM maximum
concentration tested, except ML-7 which had a CC50 of 5
µM. Bafetinib did show reduced viability at the two highest
concentrations tested (10 µM, 3.3 µM), though not reaching
50% reduction (Fig. S8).
The other 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested (Bosutinib, Saracatinib, Dasatinib) all showed inhibition Fig. S7, however cytotoxicity results obtained with the assay used were also high
preventing the unambiguous determination of whether inhibition was specific or due to cytotoxicity Fig. S8. However,
it should be noted that these agents have been reported to be
cytostatic in A549 cells, and the CellTiter Gloassay used to
assess viability measures cellular metabolism so will not distinguish between cytostatic and cytotoxic effects.

Discussion
We employed a mass spectrometry approach to study proteolytic cleavage events during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substrates of viral proteases are frequently inferred through studies of related proteases (40). However, such approaches
are unable to identify novel substrates, and even closelyrelated proteases can differ in their substrate specificity (41).
Mass spectrometry-based approaches to identify protease
substrates by identifying the neo-N-terminal peptides generated by protease activity have existed for a number of years
(21, 42–44), however, they have seen only limited application
to the study of viral substrates (45), and have not been previously applied to the study of proteolysis during coronavirus
infection.
While our approach identified multiple novel viral and cellular cleavage sites, it also failed to identify multiple known
cleavage sites, including the furin cleavage site in spike, and
multiple cleavage sites within the viral polyprotein. This can
be understood from the dependence of the approach on the
specific protease used for mass spectrometry analysis. Iso10

baric labelling prior to trypsin digestion blocks tryptic cleavage at lysine residues and causes trypsin to cleave solely after arginine residues. This results in the generation of long
peptides and if the specific cleavage site does not produce a
peptide of suitable length for analysis (typically 8-30 amino
acids) then it will be missed. This can be alleviated through
the application of multiple mass spectrometry-compatible
proteases in parallel, yielding multiple peptides of different
length for each cleavage site (46, 47). This would both increase the number of sites identified and cross-validate previously identified cleavage sites. These methods will likely
prove a fruitful avenue for future investigations of proteolysis during infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that
employ protease-driven mechanisms of viral replication.
Our approach identified multiple cleavage sites within viral
proteins. In some cases, such as the nucleocapsid protein,
cleavage by cellular proteases has been observed for SARSCoV (18, 19), though the number of cleavage products observed was much higher in our study (Fig. 2). Compared
to the gel-based approaches used in the past, our approach
is much more sensitive for detecting when protease activity
results in N-termini with ragged ends, due to further exoproteolytic activity. Examples of this in our data are particularly
evident in Fig. 2 for the nucleocapsid and ORF3a where neoN-termini appear in clusters. Cleavage sites within the nucleocapsid and spike protein are of particular interest as these are
the two viral antigens to which research is closely focuses for
both testing and vaccination purposes. In this context, neoN-termini are of interest as N-termini can be recognised by
the immune response, as they are typically surface-exposed.
Antibodies recognising neo-N-termini such sites will not be
detected in tests using complete or recombinant fragments
that do not account for such cleavage sites. Indeed, a recent
study revealed altered antigenicity of proteolytic proteoforms
of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid following autolysis (48).
Understanding cleavage events can also inform interpretation
of protein structural analysis, for example in the ORF3a viroporin (24). Knowledge of cleavage sites can permit further
analysis of spike entry mechanisms, and vaccine design, especially when considering N-terminal modifications such as
pyroglutamate, which will impact antibody binding in this
region.
Formation of the most prominent neo-N-terminus we identified in SARS-CoV-2 spike at 635 appeared dependent on
cathepsins and/or calpains, as its appearance was limited by
calpeptin treatment. Mutation of the P2 residue in the putative cleavage site, resulting in mutant V365G, led to an increased incorporation of cleaved spike in pseudotyped viral
particles. Consistent with an increased content of fusioncompetent cleaved spike, the V635G mutant showed an increased infectivity in HEK-Ace2 target cells.
Why blocking the formation of the 637 neo-N-terminus promotes cleaved spike incorporation remains to be elucidated.
A possible explanation may lie in a competition between different cleavage sites in the producer cell, with cleavage at
637 inhibiting cleavage at the furin site, or inhibiting the
incorporation of spike trimers already cleaved at the furin

site. The capacity of producer cells to cleave viral glycoproteins at alternative sites may thus be viewed as an intrinsic
defense mechanism. In contrast, the capacity of viral proteases to cleave multiple host proteins, as demonstrated in
this study, contributes to well-established mechanisms aiming at inhibiting innate host responses, including in particular the interferon pathway (14). Therefore, the diversity of
proteolytic cleavage events revealed by N-terminomics may
reflect another layer in the dynamic evolutionary conflict between viruses and their hosts.
Proteolytic cleavage can alter protein function in several
ways, including inactivation, re-localisation, or altered function including the removal of inhibitory domains. Our siRNA
screen showed knockdown of the majority of potential protease targets we identified was inhibitory to SARS-CoV-2
replication (Fig. 5). Indeed, no siRNA treatment resulted
in higher viral titres or RNA levels, suggesting that inactivation is not the prime purpose of these cleavage events. This
suggests that in many cases, proteolytic cleavage by viral proteases may be extremely targeted, serving to fine-tune protein
activity, rather than merely serving as a blunt instrument to
shut down unfavorable host responses. It is also worth noting the low overlap between our infection-based study, and a
subsequently released N-terminomics dataset which used incubation of cell culture lysates with recombinant Mpro (49).
Only GOLGA3 was common to both studies, in spite of the
larger number of cleavage events identified in the Koudelka
et al. study. However in such a lysate-based experiment subcellular compartmentalisation and regulation of relative enzyme and substrate localisation & abundance is lost, so can
risk identifying cleavage events not possible in vivo during
genuine infection. An improved understanding of the exact
ways in which proteolytic cleavage is regulated, modulates
protein activity, and serves to benefit viral replication will be
crucial for targeting cellular substrates of viral proteases as a
therapeutic strategy.

Limitations
In this study, we used two cell line models to characterise
the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on protease activity and
the generation of viral and cellular cleavage products. Notably, we tested the efficiency of several inhibitors against
SARS-CoV-2 infection only in the context of the A549Ace2 cell line model. These results present preliminary data
that must be further validated in other models, in vivo, and
through clinical trials before use in patients for the treatment
of COVID-19 disease.

tific). A549-Ace2 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line
that over-expresses ACE2, were kindly provided by Oliver
Schwartz (Institut Pasteur) (50). A549-Ace2 cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptavidin and 10 µg/ml blasticidin (Sigma) and
maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 . The SARS-CoV-2 isolate BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 was supplied through
the European Virus Archive goes Global (EVAg) platform.
Viral stocks were prepared by propagation in Vero E6 cells
in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. For protease inhibitor experiments employing calpeptin and camostat mesylate, these drugs or an equal volume of vehicle (DMSO) were
supplemented to the medium 12h post-infection at 50mM
final concentration. All experiments involving live SARSCoV-2 were performed in compliance with Institut Pasteur
Paris’s guidelines for Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment
procedures in approved laboratories. All experiments were
performed in at least three biologically independent samples.
For spike-pseudotyped lentivector production and infections,
HEK293Tn were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (complete
medium), and cultured at 37°C under 5% CO2. HEK293ThACE2-TMPRSS2 (called HEK-ACE2-TMPRSS2) with inducible TPMRSS2 expression were a gift from Julian
Buchrieser and Olivier Schwartz (50). These cells were
maintained in complete medium with blasticidin (10 µg/mL,
InvivoGen) and puromycin (1 µg/mL, Alfa Aesar), and induced for TMPRSS2 expression by the addition of TMPRSS2 was induced by addition of doxycycline (0.5 µg/mL,
Sigma).
SARS-CoV-2 titration by plaque assay. Vero E6 cells

were seeded in 24-well plates at a concentration of 7.5x104
cells/well. The following day, serial dilutions were performed in serum-free MEM media. After 1 hour absorption at 37°C, 2x overlay media was added to the inoculum to
give a final concentration of 2% (v/v) FBS / MEM media and
0.4% (w/v) SeaPrep Agarose (Lonza) to achieve a semi-solid
overlay. Plaque assays were incubated at 37° C for 3 days.
Samples were fixed using 4% Formalin (Sigma Aldrich) and
plaques were visualized using crystal Violet solution (Sigma
Aldrich).

were washed 3x with PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific) before
lysing them in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.4 (ThermoFisher
Scientific), 1% Igepal (Sigma Aldrich), 1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS; ThermoFisher Scientific), and protease inhibitor (mini-cOmplete, Roche). Samples were then heated
to 95°C for 5 minutes, before immediately freezing at -80°C.
Samples were then thawed and incubated with benzonase for
30 min at 37°C. Sample concentrations were normalized by
BCA assay, and 25µg of material from each sample was used
for downstream processing.
DTT was added to 10mM and incubated at 37°C for 30 min,
before alkylation with 50mM 2-chloroacetamide at room
temperature in the dark for 30 min. DTT at 50mM final
concentration was added to quench the 2-chloroacetamide for
20 min at room temperature. Samples were washed by SP3based precipitation (REF). Each sample was resuspended in
22.5µL 6M GuCl, 30µL of 0.5M HEPES pH8, and 4.5µL
TCEP (10mM final) and incubated for 30 minutes at room
temperature.
0.5mg of individual TMTpro aliquots (Lot VB294905) were
resuspended in 62uL of anhydrous DMSO. 57µL of the TMTpro was then added to each sample, mixed and incubated
for 1.5h. Label allocation was randomized using the Matlab Randperm function. Excess TMTpro was quenched with
the addition of 13µL of 1M ethanolamide and incubated for
45 min. All samples were combined for downstream processing. SP3 cleanup was performed on the combined samples.
These were resuspended in 400µL of 200mM HEPES pH8,
containing Trypsin gold at a concentration of 25ng/µL and
incubated overnight at 37°C.
Samples were placed on a magnetic rack for 5 min. 10% of
the samples was retained for the unenriched analysis. The
remaining material was supplemented with 100% ethanol to
a final concentration of 40%, undecanal added at an undecanal:peptide ratio of 20:1 and sodium cyanoborohydride to
30mM. pH was confirmed to be between pH7-8 and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 1h. Samples were then sonicated for 15 seconds, and bound to a magnetic stand for 1
min. The supernatant was retained and then acidified with
5% TFA in 40% ethanol. Macrospin columns (Nest group)
were equilibrated in 0.1% TFA in 40% ethanol. The acidified sample was applied to the column, and the flow through
retained as the N-terminal-enriched sample.
Both unenriched and enriched samples were desalted on
macrospin columns (Nest group), before drying down again.
Off-line basic reverse phase fractionation for both unenriched
and enriched samples was performed on a Waters nanoAcquity with an Acquity UPLC M-Class CSH C18 130A 1.7µm,
300µm x 150µm column. The sample was run on a 70 minute
gradient at 6µL/min flow rate. Gradient parameters were 10
min 3% B, 10-40 min 3-34% B, 40-45 min 34-45% B, 45-50
min 45-99%B, 50-60 min 99% B, 60.1-70 min 3% B. Buffers
A and B were 10mM ammonium formate pH10, and 10mM
ammonium formate pH10 in 90% acetonitrile respectively.
Both samples were resuspended in buffer A, and 1 minute
fractions were collected for 1-65 min of the run. These were
concatenated into 12 (1:13:24. . . ) or 5 fractions (1:6:11. . . )

SunChrom Micro Fraction Collector. Samples were dried
down and resuspended in 1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS
analysis.
Mass spectrometry. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted

on a Dionex 3000 coupled in-line to a Q-Exactive-HF mass
spectrometer. Digests were loaded onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 2 cm x 75 microM inner diameter, C18,
3 microM, 100 Å) at 5 µL per min in 0.1%(v/v) TFA and
2%(v/v) acetonitrile. After 3 min, the trap column was set inline with an analytical column (Easy-Spray PepMap® RSLC
15 cm x 50cm inner diameter, C18, 2 microlM, 100 Å)
(Dionex). Peptides were loaded in 0.1%(v/v) formic acid
and eluted with a linear gradient of 3.8–50% buffer B (HPLC
grade acetonitrile 80%(v/v) with 0.1%(v/v) formic acid) over
95 min at 300 nl per min, followed by a washing step (5 min
at 99% solvent B) and an equilibration step (25 min at 3.8%
solvent). All peptide separations were carried out using an
Ultimate 3000 nano system (Dionex/Thermo Fisher Scientific).. The Q-Exactive-HF was operated in data-dependent
mode with survey scans aquired at a resolution of 60,000 at
200m/z over a scan range of 350-2000m/z. The top 16 most
abundant ions with charge states +2 to +5 from the survey
scan were selected for MS2 analysis at 60,000 m/z resolution
with an isolation window of 0.7m/z, with a (N)CE of 30. The
maximum injection times were 100ms and 90ms for MS1 and
MS2 respectively, and AGC targets were 3e6 and 1e5 respectively. Dynamic exclusion (20 seconds) was enabled.
Data analysis. All data were analysed using Maxquant ver-

sion 1.6.7.0 (52). Custom modifications were generated to
permit analysis of TMTpro 16plex-labelled samples. FASTA
files corresponding to the reviewed Human proteome (20,350
entries, downloaded 8th May 2020), and African Green monkey proteome (Chlorocebus sabeus, 19,223 entries, downloaded 16th May 2020). A custom fasta file for SARS-CoV-2
was generated from the Uniprot-reviewed SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences (2697049). This file was modified to additionally include the processed products of pp1a and pp1b,
novel coding products identified by ribo-seq (28), as well as
incorporate two coding changes identified during sequencing (spike: V367F, ORF3a: G251V). All FASTA files, TMT
randomisation strategy, and the modifications.xml file containing TMTpro modifications have been included with the
mass spectrometry data depositions. Annotated spectra covering peptide N-termini of interest were prepared using xiSPEC v2(53).
Several different sets of search parameters were used for
analysis of different experiments.
For analysis of unenriched material from fractionated
lysates. Default MaxQuant settings were used with the fol-

lowing alterations. As the experimental design meant unenriched samples contained a majority of peptides lacking
N-terminal TMT labelling, quantification was performed at
MS2-level with the correction factors from Lot VB294905

For analysis of viral protein neo-N-termini from fractionated,

were used with the following alterations. MS1-based quantitation was selected. Digestion was ArgC, sei-specific Nterminus. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was selected

variable modifications. PSM and Protein FDR were set at
0.01.
All downstream analysis was conducted in Matlab. Reverse
hits and contaminants were removed, peptides were filtered
to meet PEP ≤ 0.02. For quantitative analysis, peptides were
further filtered at PIF ≥ 0.7. TMTpro data was normalised
for differences in protein loading by dividing by the label
median, rows were filtered to remove rows with more than
2/3 missing data. Missing data was KNN imputed, and individual peptides were normalised by dividing by their mean
abundance accross all TMTpro channels. As the objective
was to identify protein cleavage events, peptides were further filtered to remove those beginning at the first or second
amino acid in a protein sequence that represent the native Nterminus. +/- methionine. neo-N-termini were annotated if
they matched known signal peptides. For non-quantitative
analysis (e.g. mapping of viral neo-N-termini), peptides were
filtered to retain only blocked (acetylated, TMTpro labelled,
and pyroglutamate) N-termini. pyroglutamate-blocked Ntermini were discarded if they were preceeded by arginine or
lysine as these could represent artifactual cyclization of tryptic N-termini. Fractional protein or peptide intensity was calculated as the total intensity for the protein or peptide, multiplied by the fraction of the summed normalised TMTpro
intensity represented by a particular TMTpro label of interest.
Visualisation of the Y636/S637 cleavage site within the
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein structure was performed using PDB: 6X6P (25), in UCSF ChimeraX v1.0 (54).

method. The lentiviral vector pCDH-EF1a-GFP (System
Bioscience), the packaging plasmid psPAXII (Addgene), the
spike expression vector phCMV-SARS-CoV-2-Spike (a gift
from O. Schwartz), and the pRev plasmid (a gift from P.
Charneau) were mixed at a 2:2:1:1 ratio and transfected at
252 µg DNA per 175 cm2 cell flask. The pQCXIP-Empty
plasmid was used as a negative control for spike expression.
At 48h after transfection, supernatants were collected and
concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 23,000 g for 1h 30m
at 4°C on a 20% sucrose cushion. Viral particles were resuspended in PBS and frozen in aliquots at -80°C until use. Gag
p24 antigen concentration was measured with the Alliance
HIV-1 p24 Antigen ELISA kit (Perkin Elmer).
Point mutations to generate the mutants were introduced
by site-directed mutagenesis of phCMV-SARS-CoV-2-Spike

Infection with spike-pseudotyped lentivectors. The day

before infection, 100,000 HEK-ACE2 or HEK-ACE2TMPRSS2 cells were plated in 96-well plates and TMPRSS2
was induced by the addition of doxycycline. HEK-ACE2 +/TMPRSS2 were infected with the equivalent of 2 µg of p24
Gag for each spike lentivector, in final volume of 100 µL. Infection was quantified by measuring the percentage of GFP+
cells two days post-infection by flow cytometry. Cells were
harvested, washed in PBS, and stained with the viability dye
eF780 (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4°C. After two washes
in PBS, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 2% (ThermoFisher) and acquired on an Attune NxT flow cytometer.
Results were analyzed with FlowJo software (v10.7.1), with
statistical analyses carried out with the GraphPad Prism software (v9).
Western blotting of spike-pseudotyped lentivectors.

To prepare protein extracts, cells were lysed in buffer with
NaCl 150 mM, Tris HCl 50 mM (pH8), 1% Triton, EDTA 5
mM, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) for 30
min on ice. For lentiviral particle extracts, an equivalent
of 500 ng of p24 Gag was lysed in buffer with 1% Triton
(ELISA kit, Alliance Perkin Elmer) for 30 min on ice. To
preserve antibody reactivity, samples were not heated nor reduced before being run in a 4-12% acrylamide denaturing
gel (NP0323, NuPAGE, ThermoFisher), and then transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (IB23001, ThermoFisher).
The membrane was blocked with 5% dried milk in PBS
Tween 0.1%, before incubation with the primary antibody

imaging system. Images were quantified with the ImageStudioLite (v5.2.5) software, using a mode with automated
background subtraction. Primary antibodies consisted in the
human anti-spike mAb 48 (1:1,000; a gift from H. Mouquet) or the mouse anti-p24 Gag MAB7360 (RD Systems;
1:1000). Anti-human or mouse IgG secondary antibodies,
conjugated to DyLight-800 (A80-304D8, Bethyl Laboratories) or DyLight-680 (SA5-35521, ThermoFisher) respectively, were used at a 1:10,000 concentration.
In vitro cleavage assays. In vitro cleavage assays were per-

formed using the Leishmania tarentolae (LTE) system as described (14). SRC, PAICS, PNN and RPA2 (control) were
cloned as GFP fusion proteins into dedicated Gateway vectors for cell-free expression. Open Reading Frames (ORFs)
in pDonor were sourced from the Human ORFeome collection, version 8.1 and transferred into Gateway destination
vectors that include N-terminal (SRC) or C-terminal (PAICS,
PNN and RPA2) Fluorescent proteins. The specific Gateway vectors were created by the laboratory of Pr. Alexandrov and sourced from Addgene (Addgene plasmid # 67137;
http://n2t.net/addgene:67137; RRID:Addgene_67137). LTE
extracts for in vitro expression were prepared in-house as described (55). Purified recombinant Mpro and PLP were generated by the UNSW protein production facility as described
previously (14).
The SRC, PAICS, PNN and RPA2proteins were expressed individually in 10 µL reactions (1µL DNA plasmid at concentrations ranging from 400ng/L to 2000ng/L added to 9 µL of
LTE reagent). The mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at
27°C to allow the efficient conversion of DNA into RNA. The
samples were then split into controls and protease-containing
reactions. The proteases PLpro (nsp3) and 3CLpro (nsp5)
were added at various concentrations, and the reactions were
allowed to proceed for another 2.5h at 27°C before analysis.
The controls and protease-treated LTE reactions were then
mixed with LDS (Bolt LDS Sample Buffer, ThermoFisher)
and loaded onto SDS-page gels (4-12% Bis-Tris Plus gels,
ThermoFisher); the proteins were detected by scanning the
gel for green (GFP) fluorescence using a ChemiDoc MP system (BioRad) and proteolytic cleavage was assessed from the
changes in banding patterns. Note that in this protocol, the
proteins are not treated at high temperature with the LDS and
not fully denatured, to avoid destruction of the GFP fluorescence. As proteins would retain some folding, the apparent
migration on the SDS-page gels may differ slightly from the
expected migration calculated from their molecular weight.
We have calibrated our SDS-page gels and ladders using a
range of proteins, as shown previously (14).

cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher, USA) in
presence of Phosphatase/Protease inhibitors cocktail (ThermoFisher, USA). The lysate was centrifuged (15 min at 4°C
and 13000rpm) and the supernatant was collected. Protein
concentration was quantified using Pierce™ BCA Protein
Assay kit (ThermoFisher, USA) and Western Blot performed
with standard protocol. Briefly, proteins were seperated
on a precast 4-20% gradient gel (Biorad, USA) and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry TransBlot Turbo Transfer System and Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer
Buffer (Biorad, USA). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour
with 5% milk in TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20)
buffer, rinsed, and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies in 2% BSA in TBST. Membranes were washed
with TBST and incubated for 2h at room temperature with
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked secondary secondary
antibody (Cell signaling #7074). Chemiluminescent signal
was revealed using SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS Substrate
(ThermoFisher, USA) and imaged with an Azure 600 Imaging system (Azure Biosystem, USA). The primary antibodies
used were PAICS (Bethyl A304-547A-T), GOLGA3 (Bethyl
A303-404A-T) and β-Tubulin (Cell Signaling #2128). Primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1/1000 and
1/5000 dilutions, respectively. Importantly, primary antibodies against PAICS and GOLGA3 recognized C-terminal immunogens, ensuring that cleaved proteins could be detected.
Virus infections in siRNA-based cellular protein
knockdowns . Host proteins were knocked-down in A549-

Ace2 cells using specific dsiRNAs from IDT. Briefly, A549Ace2 cells seeded at 1x104 cells/well in 96-well plates. After 24 hours, each well was transfected with 5 pmol of individual dsiRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 hours post transfection, the cell culture supernatant was removed and replaced with virus inoculum (MOI
of 0.1 PFU/cell). Following a 1 hour adsorption at 37°C,
the virus inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh 2%
FBS/DMEM media. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 3
days before supernatants were harvested. Samples were either heat-inactivated at 80°C for 20 min and viral RNA was
quantified by RT-qPCR, using previously published SARSCoV-2 specific primers targeting the N gene (56). RT-qPCR
was performed using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR
Kit (NEB) in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 thermocycler, using the following cycling conditions: 55 °C for 10
min, 95 °C for 1 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 sec, followed by 60 °C for 1 min. The quantity of viral genomes
is expressed as PFU equivalents, and was calculated by performing a standard curve with RNA derived from a viral
stock with a known viral titer. Alternatively, infectious virus
titers were quantified using plaque assays as described above.
To quantify siRNA-based cellular protein knockdowns,
A549-Ace2 cells were seeded and transfected with individual dsiRNAs as described above. After 24 hours incubation at 37 °C cells were lysed and RNA was extracted using Trizol (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by purification using the Direct-zol-96 RNA extraction kit (Zymo) folMeyer et al.

lowing the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA levels of target proteins were subsequently quantified by using RT-with
the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB) in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 thermocycler using genespecific primers. Expression levels were compared to scrambled dsiRNA-transfected cells und normalized to expression
of human beta-actin. Knockdown efficiencies were calculated using ΔΔCt in Matlab.
To assess cell viability after siRNA knockdowns, cells were
seeded and transfected as described above. 24 hours after transfection cell viability was measured using alamarBlue reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific), media was removed
and replaced with alamarBlue and incubated for 1h at 37
°C and fluorescence measured in a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro
plate reader. Percentage viability was calculated relative to
untreated cells (100% viability) and cells lysed with 20%
ethanol (0% viability), included in each plate.
Drug Screens and Cytotoxicity analysis. Black with

clear bottom 384 well plates were seeded with 2x103 A549Ace2 cells per well. The following day, individual compounds were added using the Echo 550 acoustic dispenser at
concentrations indicated 2 hours prior to infection. DMSOonly (0.5%) and remdesivir (10µM; SelleckChem) controls
were added in each plate. After the pre-incubation period,
the drug-containing media was removed, and replaced with
virus inoculum (MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell). Following a onehour adsorption at 37°C, the virus inoculum was removed
and replaced with 2% FBS/DMEM media containing the individual drugs at the indicated concentrations. Cells were
incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Supernatants were harvested
and heat-inactivated at 80°C for 20 min. Detection of viral
genomes from heat-inactivated was performed by RT-qPCR
as described above. Cytotoxicity was determined using
the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega).
White with clear bottom 384 well plates were seeded with
2x103 A549-Ace2 cells per well. The following day, individual compounds were added using the Echo 550 acoustic

Fig. S2. Viral N-termini and neo-N-termini identified from the viral M, ORF7A/ORF7A iORF1, ORF8, ORF9B and pp1ab replicase. Please note that ORF7A iORF1 is an
N-terminally truncated form of ORF7A that initiates at isoleucine 3 in the ORF7A sequence. The indicated neo-N-terminus beginning at amino acid 14, would therefore be
amino acid 16 in ORF7A.
