Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a
pandemic and continues to spread around the globe at an unprecedented rate. To date, no effective
therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19. Our discovery of a novel
insertion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (681-686
(PRRARS)) and two other GAG-binding-like motifs within SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein
(SGP) led us to hypothesize that host cell surface GAGs might be involved in host cell entry of
SARS-CoV-2. Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both
monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40
pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM,
respectively). In competitive binding studies, the IC50 of heparin, tri-sulfated non-anticoagulant
heparan sulfate, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin against SARS-CoV-2 SGP
binding to immobilized heparin were 0.056 μM, 0.12 μM, and 26.4 μM, respectively. Finally,
unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAGbinding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and
at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open
conformation. Our study augments our knowledge in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and advances
carbohydrate-based COVID-19 therapeutic development.

Introduction
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic less than three months after its initial
emergence in Wuhan, China [1,2]. SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic Betacoronavirus transmitted
through person-person contact through airborne and fecal-oral routes, and has caused over 693,000
confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 33,000 associated deaths worldwide
[2–5]. While there is limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, extensive studies have
been performed on how its closely related cousins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus), invade host cell. Upon initially contacting the surface
of a host cell, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV exploit host cell proteases to prime their surface spike
glycoproteins (SGPs) for fusion activation, which is achieved by receptor binding, low pH, or both
[6,7]. The receptor binding domain (RBD) resides within subunit 1 (S1) while subunit 2 (S2)
facilitates viral-host cell membrane fusion [6]. Activated SGP undergoes a conformational change
followed by an initiated fusion reaction with the host cell membrane [6]. Endocytosed virions are
further processed by the endosomal protease cathepsin L in the late endosome [7,8]. Both MERSCov and SARS-CoV require proteolytic cleavage at their S2’ site, but not at their S1-S2 junction,
for successful membrane fusion and host cell entry [6,7]. Additionally, receptors involved in fusion
activation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include heparan sulfate (HS) and angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively [9–11].
SARS-CoV and other pathogens arrive at a host cell surface by clinging, through their
surface proteins, to linear, sulfated polysaccharides called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [12–14].
The repeating disaccharide units of GAGs, comprised of a hexosamine and a uronic acid or a
galactose residue, are often sulfated (S1 Fig) [15]. GAGs are generally found covalently linked to

core proteins as proteoglycans (PGs) and reside inside the cell, at the cell surface, and in the
extracellular matrix (ECM) [15]. GAGs facilitate various biological processes, including cellular
signaling, pathogenesis, and immunity, and possess diverse therapeutic applications [15]. For
example, an FDA approved anticoagulant heparin (HP) is a secretory GAG released from granules
of mast cells during infection [15,16]. Some GAG binding proteins can be identified by amino
acid sequences known as Cardin-Weintraub motifs corresponding to ‘XBBXBX’ and
‘XBBBXXBX’, where X is a hydropathic residue and B is a basic residue, such as arginine and
lysine, responsible for interacting with the sulfate groups present in GAGs [17,18]. Examination
of the SARS-CoV-2 SGP sequence revealed that the GAG-binding motif resides within S1-S2
proteolytic cleavage motif (furin cleavage motif BBXBB) that is not present in SARS-CoV or
MERS-CoV SGPs (Fig 1, S2 Fig, S3 Fig) [19]. Additionally, we discovered GAG-binding-like
motifs within RBD and S2’ proteolytic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 SGP (Fig 1, S2 Fig, S3 Fig).
This discovery prompted us to hypothesize that GAGs may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 fusion
activation and host cell entry as a novel mechanism through SGP binding. We performed surface
plasmon resonance (SPR)-based binding assays to determine binding kinetics of the interactions
between various GAGs and SARS-CoV-2 SGP in comparison with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV
SGP to address this question. Lastly, we performed blind docking on the trimeric SARS-CoV-2
SGP model to objectively identify the preferred binding GAG-binding sites on the SGP.

Results
Kinetic measurements of CoV SPG-HP interactions
Previous reports showed that various CoV bind GAGs through their SGPs to invade host
cells [13]. In the current study, we utilized SPR to measure the binding kinetics and interaction
affinity of monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2, monomeric SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with
SGP-HP using a sensor chip with immobilized HP. Sensorgrams of CoV SGP-HP interactions are
shown in Fig 2. The sensorgrams were fit globally to obtain association rate constant (ka),
dissociation rate constant (kd) and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) (Table 1) using the
BiaEvaluation software and assuming a 1:1 Langmuir model. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS CoV SGP
exhibited a markedly low dissociation rate constant (kd ~ 10-7 1/s) suggesting excellent binding
strength. The HP binding properties of monomeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP was comparable to that of
the trimeric form (KD of monomer and trimer were 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively). In comparison,
previously known HP binding SARS-CoV SGP showed nearly 10-fold lower affinity, 500 nM.
The extremely high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 SGP to HP was supported by the chip surface
regeneration conditions. The immobilized HP surface could only be regenerated using a harsh
regeneration reagent, 0.25% SDS, instead of the standard 2M NaCl solution used for removing
HP-binding proteins. One reason for SARS-CoV-2 SGP monomer and trimer extremely high
affinity to immobilized heparin is the high density of surface bound ligands might promote
polyvalent interactions. The difference of binding kinetics and affinity of CoV SGPs to HP may
also be due in part to the difference in protein sequence of the Cov SGPs. Based on amino acid
alignment analysis using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 SGPs share 76% similarity. Association rate constants (ka) for MERS-CoV SGP
(339 (± 27) 1/M-1s1) was the lowest, followed by monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP (2.5

× 103 (± 62.7) M-1s-1 and 1.6 × 103 (± 127) M-1s-1, respectively) (Table 1). SARS-CoV SGP had
the highest Ka, which was 4.12 × 104 (± 136) M-1s-1. The differences in ka values suggest a different
mechanism when each SGP binds HP in addition to differences in binding strengths.

SPR solution competition study on the interaction between surface-bound HP and SARSCoV-2 SGP to HP-derived oligosaccharides in solution
Solution/surface competition experiments were performed by SPR to examine the effect of
the saccharide chain length of HP on the SARS-CoV-2 SGP-HP interaction. HP-derived
oligosaccharides of different lengths, from tetrasaccharide (dp4) to octadecasaccharide (dp18),
were used in these competition studies. The same concentration (1000 nM) of HP oligosaccharides
were mixed in the SARS-CoV-2 SGP protein (50 nM)/ HP interaction solution. Negligible
competition was observed (S4 Fig) when 1000 nM of oligosaccharides (from dp4 to dp18) were

present in the protein solution suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 SGP-HP interaction is chainlength dependent and it prefers to bind full chain (~dp30) HP.

SPR solution competition study of different chemically modified HP derivatives and GAGs
Competition levels measured by SPR for chemically modified HP derivatives are shown
in Fig 3. The results of these studies demonstrate that all the chemically modified HPs, Ndesulfated HP, 2-O-desulfated HP and 6-O-desulfated HP, were unable to compete with
immobilized HP for binding to SARS-CoV-2 SGP-HP suggesting all the sulfate groups within HP
have critical impact on this interaction.
SPR competition assay was also used to test the binding preference of SARS-CoV-2 SGP
for various GAGs (S1 Fig), including various chondroitin sulfates, dermatan and keratan sulfates,
and the results are shown in S5 Fig. Weak or no inhibitory activities were observed for all GAGs
tested, suggesting that the binding of SARS-CoV-2 SGP protein to GAGs appears to be HP
specific and greatly influenced by the level of sulfation within the GAG.

SPR solution competition dose response analysis of HP, Tri-sulfated HS and NACH
Solution competition dose response analysis between surface immobilized HP and various
soluble glycans (HP, non-anticoagulant trisulfated (TriS) HS, and non-anticoagulant low
molecular weight HP (NACH)) was performed to calculate their IC50 values (Figs 4A-4E). SARSCoV-2 SGP protein (50 nM) samples were pre-mixed with different concentrations of glycans
before injection into the HP chip. The sensorgrams (Figs 4A, 4C and 4E) show that once the active
binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 SGP were occupied by glycans in solution, the binding of SARSCoV-2 SGP to the surface-immobilized HP decreased resulting in a reduction of signal in a

concentration dependent fashion. The IC50 values (concentration of competing analyte resulting
in a 50% decrease in RU) were calculated from the plots SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding signal
(normalized) vs. glycans concentration in solution (Figs 4B, 4D and 4F). The IC50 values of HP,
TriS HS and NACH were 0.056 µM, 012 µM and 26.4 µM, respectively.

Identification of GAG-binding motifs by blinding docking analysis
Using a modified version of Autodock Vina tuned for use with carbohydrates (Vina-Carb)
[20,21], we performed blind docking on the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP model to discover
objectively the preferred binding GAG-binding sites on the SGP protein surface. The SGP
contains three putative GAG-binding motifs with the following sequences: 453-459 (YRLFRKS),
681-686 (PRRARS), and 810-816 (SKPSKRS), which we define as sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively
(Fig 1, S2 Fig, S3 Fig). An HS hexasaccharide fragment (GlcA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)) binds site 2 in
each monomer chain in the trimeric SGP (Fig 5C, S3 Fig). The docking results also indicates that
HS may bind to site 1 when the apex of the S1 monomer is in an open conformation, as this allows
basic residues to be more accessible to ligand binding. The site 1 residues are less accessible for
GAG binding when the domain is in a closed conformation (Fig 5D). The electrostatic potential
surface representation of the trimeric SGP confirms that the GAG-binding poses generally prefer
regions of positive charge, as expected, and illustrates that basic residues within site 3 are not
exposed for binding to HS on any of the chains (Fig 5A). Finally, our blind docking analysis
reveals that a longer HS polymer may span an inter-domain channel that contains site 2.

Discussion
The original SARS-CoV and numerous pathogens exploit host cell surface GAGs during
the initial step of host cell entry [12–14]. Based on our discovery of GAG-binding and GAGbinding-like motifs at site 1 (within the RBD, Y453-S459), site 2 (at the proteolytic cleavage site
at S1/S2 junction, P681-S686), and site 3 (at the S2’ proteolytic cleavage site, S810-S816), we
hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may also interact with host cell surface GAGs through its SGPs
to invade host cell (Fig 1, S2 Fig, S3 Fig). The predominant GAG in normal human lung is HS
followed by CS [22] and it is noteworthy that lung tissue is rich in mast cells and has been a source
of commercial HP [23]. Using unbiased docking, we found that TriS HS hexasaccharide
(GlcA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)) binds site 2 in each monomer chain in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP (Fig
5C). TriS HS hexasaccharide may additionally bind site 1 when the SGP monomer is in an open
conformation, but not site 3 where the basic residues are not accessible to the surface (Figs 5C and
5D). Docking results indicated that the HS hexasaccharides could span an inter-domain channel
that includes site 2, suggesting a mechanism for the binding of a longer HS sequence (Fig 5C).
Next, we experimentally determined binding kinetics for the interactions between HP (rich
(60-80%) in TriS domains) and monomeric SARS-CoV-2, trimeric SARS-CoV-2, monomeric
SARS-CoV, and monomeric MERS-CoV SGPs using SPR binding assays (Fig 2 and Table 1).
GAG-protein interactions are mainly electrostatically driven [24], thus, HS-binding proteins
generally bind HP due to its higher degree of sulfation [15]. We discovered that HP binds both
monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP with remarkable affinity (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM,
respectively) (Fig 2 and Table 1). This was unexpectedly tight binding for a GAG-protein
interaction as even one of one of the prototypical HP-binding proteins, fibroblast growth factor 2
(FGF2), has a KD of 39 nM [25]. In comparison, SARS-Cov and MERS-CoV SGPs also bind HP,

however, much more weakly with binding strengths of KD = 500 nM and 1 nM, respectively (Fig
2 and Table 1). While HS facilitates SARS-CoV host cell entry and is an essential host cell surface
receptor, its involvement in MERS-CoV host cell entry or binding kinetics for SARS-Cov and
MERS-CoV SGPs had not previously been reported [10].
After discovering the high binding affinity between HP and SARS-CoV-2 SGP, we next
found that the degree and position of sulfation within HP was important for its successful binding
to monomeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP (Figs 3 and 4). N-, 2-O, and 6-O-sulfation were all required for
binding to SARS-CoV-2 SGP (Fig 3). This was additionally demonstrated when competitive
binding studies gave IC50 values of HP (0.056 μM), TriS HS (NS2S6S) (0.12 μM), and NACH
(26.4 μM) for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding to immobilized HP (Fig 4). Both HP
and TriS HS are sulfated at N-, 2-O-, and 6-O- positions and have approximately the same
molecular weight (and chain length) but HP has additional 3-O-sulfation, responsible for its
anticoagulant activity (S1 Fig). NACH lacks an intact antithrombin binding site, has a lower
average molecular weight of 5 kDa than HP, and a higher content (>90%) of TriS [26].
The low IC50 of these GAGs suggest that the FDA approved anticoagulant HP, or its nonanticoagulant derivatives, might have therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection as
competitive inhibitors. The location of proposed GAG-binding sites is also of interest. Unlike
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs, SARS-CoV-2 SGP has a novel insert in the amino acid
sequence (681-686 (PRRARS)) that fully follows GAG-binding Cardin-Weintraub motif
(XBBXBX) and a furin-cleavage motif (BBXBB) at the S1/S2 junction (Fig 1). This site was also
shown to be a preferred GAG-binding motif by our unbiased docking study (Fig 5). Proteolytic
cleavage at S1/S2 is not required for successful viral-host cellular membrane fusion in SARS-CoV

and MERS-CoV SGPs [6,7]. Proteolytic cleavage primes the SGP for fusion activation and may
additionally influence cell-cell fusion, host cell entry, and/or the infectivity of the virus [13,27].
Some CoVs, including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV),
possess both GAG-binding and furin cleavage motifs at their S1/S2 junction in their SGPs [13]. In
the cases of MHV and IBV spike proteins, a single amino acid mutation near the GAG-binding
and furin cleavage motifs resulted from a cell culture adaptation, and determines whether a virion
binds GAGs or exploits host cell surface protease, but not both [28]. While not within the CoV
family, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires HS-binding to achieve optimal
furin processing because HS binding allows selective exposure of furin cleavage site [29]. While
the idea of repurposing HP as COVID-19 therapeutic sounds appealing, further questions,
including in vitro relevance of GAGs as host cell surface receptors, proteolytic processing of SGPs
at S1/S2 junction, and their relationship in host cell entry and infectivity, must first be carefully
evaluated.
Based on our findings, we propose a model on how GAGs may facilitate host cell entry of
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 6). First, virions land on the epithelial surface in the airway by binding to HS
through their SGPs (Fig 6A). Host cell surface proteoglycans utilize their long HS chains to
securely wrap around the trimeric SGP (Fig 6A). During this step, heavily sulfated HS chains span
inter-domain channel containing GAG-binding site 2 on each monomer in the trimeric SGP and
binds site 1 within the RBD in an open conformation (Fig 5). Host cell surface and extracellular
proteases, such as furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), may process site 2
(S1/S2 junction) and/or 3 (S2’) and GAG chains come off from site 2 upon cleavage (Fig 6B). HS
and ACE2 binding to more readily accessible RBD containing site 1 may drive conformational
change of SGP and activate viral-cellular membrane fusion [30]. Finally, SGP on the endocytosed

virion may utilize an endosomal host cell protease, such as cathepsin L, to further execute viralcellular membrane fusion. (Fig 6C).
In conclusion, we have discovered that GAGs can facilitate host cell entry of SARS-CoV2 by binding to SGP in the current work. SPR studies demonstrate that both monomeric and
trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP bind HP with remarkably high affinity and it prefers long, heavily
sulfated (TriS rich) structures. Additionally, we reported low IC50 of HP and derivatives against
HP and SARS-CoV-2 SGP interactions suggesting therapeutic potential of HP as COVID-19
competitive inhibitors. Lastly, unbiased computational ligand docking indicated that a TriS HS
oligosaccharide preferably interacts with GAG-binding motifs at the S1/S2 junction and within
receptor binding domain and hinted at mechanism of binding. This study adds to our current
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and serves a foundation for designing glycoconjugate
vaccines and therapeutics to successfully contain and eliminate COVID-19.

(N-DeS HP, Mw = 14 kDa) and 2-O-desulfated HP (2-DeS HP, MW = 13 kDa) were prepared in
house based on protocols by Yates et al [31]. The 6-O-desulfated HP derivative, 6-DeS HP, Mw

depolymerization product of porcine intestinal HP, followed by periodate oxidation as described
in our previous work [26]. TriS HS (NS2S6S) was synthesized from N-sulfo heparosan with
subsequent modification with C5-epimerase and 2-O- and 6-O-sulfotransferases (2OST and
6OST1/6OST3) [32]. HP oligosaccharides included tetrasaccharide (dp4), hexasaccharide (dp6),
octasaccharide (dp8), decasaccharide (dp10), dodecasaccharide (dp12), tetradecasaccharide
(dp14), hexadecasaccharide (dp16) and octadecasaccharide (dp18) and were prepared from
porcine intestinal HP controlled partial heparin lyase 1 treatment followed by size fractionation.
The chemical structures of the GAGs are shown in S1 Fig. Sensor SA chips were from GE

Biotinylated HP was prepared by conjugating its reducing end to amine-PEG3-Biotin
(Pierce, Rockford, IL). In brief, HP (2 mg) and amine-PEG3-Biotin (2 mg, Pierce, Rockford, IL)
were dissolved in 200 µl H2O, 10 mg NaCNBH3 was added. The reaction mixture was heated at
70 °C for 24 h, after that a further 10 mg NaCNBH3 was added and the reaction was heated at
70 °C for another 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was desalted with the spin
column (3,000 MWCO). Biotinylated HP was collected, freeze-dried and used for SA chip

preparation. The biotinylated HP was immobilized to streptavidin (SA) chip based on the
manufacturer’s protocol. The successful immobilization of HP was confirmed by the observation
of a 200-resonance unit (RU) increase on the sensor chip. The control flow cell (FC1) was
prepared by 2 min injection with saturated biotin.

SGP samples were diluted in buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005%
surfactant P20, pH 7.4,). Different dilutions of protein samples were injected at a flow rate of 30
µL/min. At the end of the sample injection, the same buffer was flowed over the sensor surface to
facilitate dissociation. After a 3 min dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated by
injecting with 30 µL of 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) to get fully regenerated surface.
The response was monitored as a function of time (sensorgram) at 25 °C.

SARS-CoV-2 SGP (50 nM) mixed with 1 M HP, HP-derived oligosaccharides,
chemically modified HP or GAGs in SPR buffer were injected over HP chip at a flow rate of 30
L/min, respectively. After each run, the dissociation and the regeneration were performed as
described above.

Solution competition studies between surface HP and soluble glycans (HP, TriS HS and
NACH) to measure IC50 were performed using SPR [33]. In brief, SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (50
nM) samples alone or mixed with different concentrations of glycans in SPR buffer were injected
over the HP chip at a flow rate of 30 l/min, respectively. After each run, dissociation and
regeneration were performed as described above. For each set of competition experiments, a
control experiment (only protein without glycan) was performed to ensure the surface was
completely regenerated.

Protein modeling
The 3D coordinates for the SGP trimer (NCBI reference sequence YP_009724390.1) were
downloaded from the SWISS-MODEL homology modeling server [34]. The selected model was
generated with the Cryo-EM structure PDB ID 6VSB as a template, which has a 99.26% sequence
identity and 95% coverage for amino acids 27 to 1146. The template and resulting model is the
“prefusion” structure with one of the three receptor binding domains (Chain A) in the “up” or
“open” conformation [30]. Cryo-EM studies have revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 SGP
trimer exists in two conformational states in approximately equal abundance [35]. In one state, all
SGP monomers have their hACE2-binding domain closed, and in the other, one monomer has
its hACE2-binding domain open, where it is positioned away from the interior of the protein.

Ligand docking
Initial coordinates for a hexasaccharide fragment of HS (GlcA(2S)-GlcNS(6S))3 were
generated using the GAG-Builder tool [36] at GLYCAM-Web (glycam.org) and used for unbiased
(blind) docking. A hexasaccharide was chosen as being sufficiently long to represent a typical

GAG length found in protein co-complexes [36] and to avoid introducing so many degrees of
internal flexibility that the efficiency of the docking conformational search algorithm was
impaired. Docking was performed using a version of Vina-Carb [21] that has been modified to
improve its performance for GAGs. A grid box with dimensions (x = 190, y = 223, z = 184 Å) was
placed at the geometric center the protein enclosing its entire surface. Docking was performed
with default values, with the following exceptions: exhaustiveness = 80, chi_cutoff = 2, and
chi_coeff = 0.5. All sulfate and hydroxyl groups and glycosidic torsion angles were treated as
flexible, resulting in 83 ligand poses.
