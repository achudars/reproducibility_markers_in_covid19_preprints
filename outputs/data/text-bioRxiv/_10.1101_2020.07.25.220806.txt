Abstract

2

Infection by SARS-CoV-2 may elicit uncontrolled and damaging inflammatory

3

response, thus it is critical to identify compounds able to inhibit virus replication

4

and thwart the inflammatory reaction. Here, we show that the immunoregulatory

5

neuropeptides VIP and PACAP were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis in

6

human monocytes and viral production in lung epithelial cells, protect the cells

7

from virus-induced cytopathicity and reduce the production of proinflammatory

8

mediators. Both neuropeptides prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of

9

NF-kB

and

SREBP1

and

SREBP2,

transcriptions

factors

involved

in

10

proinflammatory reactions and lipid metabolism, respectively, and promoted CREB

11

activation in infected monocytes, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity

12

and also a negative regulator of NF-kB. VIP levels were elevated in plasma from

13

patients with severe COVID-19, which correlated with the inflammatory marker

14

CRP, viral load, and survival on those patients. Our results provide scientific

15

evidence to further support clinical investigation of these neuropeptides against

16

COVID-19.

Introduction

18

Individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the

19

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), may present

20

asymptomatic or mild disease to severe lung inflammation and the life threatening

21

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2,3), besides a variety of

22

extrapulmonary manifestations due to multiple organ infections (4). Severe SARS-

23

CoV-2 infection is characterized by elevated serum levels of proinflammatory

24

mediators (hypercytokinemia, also known as cytokine storm) such as, for example,

25

IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1b, IFN-γ (2,3,5,6). The dysregulated immune response

26

and production of cytokines and chemokines are hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2

27

infection and have been pointed as the main cause of the severe lung damage

28

and unfavorable clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 (3–8). Lately, the

29

in vivo formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the lungs, SARS-CoV-

30

2-induced inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis, have also been

31

considered as risk factors in critically ill COVID-19 patients (9–14).

32

During the inflammatory response to human pathogenic coronaviruses

33

(hCoVs), circulating neutrophils and monocytes migrate and infiltrate the lungs

34

(15,16) and other organs, where they release toxic amounts of neutrophil

35

extracellular traps (9–12) and proinflammatory cytokines, thus contributing to

36

potentiate and perpetuate the inflammation and eventually exacerbating the tissue

37

damage (17–19). In fact, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 induces

38

neutrophils to release NETs, which are present in the plasma and lungs of critically

39

ill COVID-19 patients, suggesting that they are central components of the

40

exacerbated inflammatory reaction occurring in individuals with COVID-19.

41

Previous studies showed that MERS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-infected macrophages

42

produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (20,21), and,

43

more recently, that lung monocytes from severe pneumonia caused by SARS-

44

CoV-2 are potent producers of TNF-α and IL-6, whose levels were increased in the

45

serum of the same patients (7). Also, we and other authors have found that

46

SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis in

47

human primary monocytes, either by experimental or natural infection, which are

48

associated with lung inflammation and are risk factors in critically ill COVID-19

49

patients (13,14).

50

Thus, it is critical to identify agents able to prevent the infection and

51

concurrently thwart the prototypical dysregulated inflammatory reaction and tissue

52

lesions secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, we evaluated whether

53

the neuropeptides Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Pituitary Adenylate

54

Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide (PACAP), can present protective effects in SARS-

55

CoV-2 infection. VIP and PACAP share many biological properties through their

56

interaction with the G protein-coupled receptors VPAC1, VPAC2 and PAC1 (22),

57

which are systemically distributed. They have well-characterized regulatory effects

58

on the immune system and anti-inflammatory properties, including control of cell

59

activation and differentiation, down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and

60

reactive oxygen species and induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (23–

61

28). Based on their consistent anti-inflammatory activities, both neuropeptides

62

have been considered as promising therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders

63

and chronic inflammatory illnesses (29–31). We report here that VIP and PACAP

64

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 gene replication in human monocytes, viral production in lung

65

epithelial cells, and reduced cellular production of proinflammatory mediators. We

66

also found that VIP levels were elevated in the plasma of individuals with severe

67

manifestations of COVID-19, which correlated with survival on critically ill patients.

68

Results

69

VIP and PACAP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis in human primary

70

monocytes, protecting them from virus-mediated cytopathic effects. Based

71

on our previous findings showing that VIP and PACAP present antiviral effects on

72

HIV-1 infection (32,33), and on their ability to control the inflammatory response,

73

we initially investigated whether both neuropeptides could inhibit viral life cycle in

74

SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. Thus, human primary monocytes were treated

75

with either VIP or PACAP, then infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the replication of

76

viral genome was measured 24 hours later. We found that VIP significantly

77

reduced the SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, achieving up to 40% and 50% inhibition

78

at 5 nM and 10 nM, respectively (Fig. 1A). PACAP similarly inhibited levels of viral

79

RNA synthesis with 5 nM and 10 nM (up to 50% for both doses) (Fig. 1B). In

80

parallel, we observed that VIP and PACAP, at 10 nM each, completely protected

81

the monocytes from the SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytopathic effect, as measured by

82

the LDH levels in the cell culture supernatant (Fig. 1C). These results show that

83

both neuropeptides are similarly effective in their ability to reduce SARS-CoV-2

84

genome replication in monocytes and to prevent the virus-induced cell death.

85

Receptor contribution for the VIP and PACAP mediated inhibition of SARS-

86

CoV-2 replication. Because VIP binds the receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2, and

87

PACAP has high affinity for PAC1, but also binds the VPAC1 and VPAC2 (22), we

88

analyzed the role of the individual receptors in the neuropeptide-mediated

89

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication. To this end, monocytes were treated

90

with specific agonists to VPAC1, VPAC2 and PAC1 (Ala-VIP, Bay 55 9837 and

91

Maxadilan, respectively), and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2. We found that the

92

sole activation of VPAC1 at 1 nM, 5 nM and 10 nM, and of VPAC2 at 1 nM,

93

significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 gene replication (Fig. 1D). Of note, the

94

optimal concentrations of the receptor agonists that significantly decreased the

95

SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis were similar to those of the natural receptor ligands

96

VIP and PACAP.

97

We also evaluated if the combination of VIP and PACAP could reduce the viral

98

replication, while reducing the optimal concentration, as VIP and PACAP are

99

reported to act synergistically or in additive fashion in the inhibition of HIV-1

100

replication in macrophages (32). We did not observe any increase of viral inhibition

101

activity or reduction of optimal dose when the peptides were combined, being the

102

10 nM dose the optimal concentration for both peptides, combined or not (Fig. 1E).

103

Overall, these findings suggest that VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors are the main

104

contributors for the VIP- and PACAP-mediated SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in

105

monocytes, and that the sole activation of these receptors can lead to a

106

diminished viral inhibition similar as that induced by the own neuropeptides.

107

VIP and PACAP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells and protect

108

them from virus-mediated cytopathic effects. We next evaluated whether VIP

109

and PACAP could also be able to restrict the virus production in pulmonary cells,

110

one of the major targets of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, Calu-3 cells, a lineage of epithelial

111

lung cells highly susceptible to this virus, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and

112

treated with a range of concentrations of either peptide. We found that VIP

113

decreased the productive infection, reaching up to 50% and 40% inhibition with 1

114

nM and 5 nM, respectively (Fig. 2A). PACAP also diminished virus production up

115

to 40% and 50% at concentrations equivalent to 10 nM and 50 nM (Fig. 2B). The

116

different optimal concentrations between VIP and PACAP in their ability to control

117

the viral productive infection in Calu-3 cells might be explained by the relative

118

abundance of the neuropeptide receptors, since it has been shown that these cells

119

express only VPAC1 (34). However, all three receptors are reported to be

120

expressed in lungs, with some studies showing that VPAC1 levels are much

121

higher than VPAC2 (the other VIP receptor) or PAC1 (to which PACAP binds with

122

higher affinity than to VPAC1 and VPAC2 (22,35–37)). Likewise what we found for

123

monocytes, VIP and PACAP also protected Calu-3 cells from the SARS-CoV-2-

124

induced cytopathogenic effects, at the same optimal viral inhibitory concentrations

125

(1 nM and 50 nM, respectively) of each neuropeptide (Fig. 2C). Using agonists for

126

VIP and PACAP receptors we also verified that VPAC1 is the main receptor

127

involved the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells, emulating the level of

128

inhibition achieved with VIP, while the exposure to a VPAC2 agonist resulted in a

129

more modest inhibition (Fig. 2D). The stimulus with a PAC1 agonist had no effect

130

on viral replication (Fig. 2D).

131

Given that monocytes and epithelial cells can be in close proximity in the

132

lungs, and, thus, can interact and exchange molecules, we investigated whether

133

conditioned medium (CM) obtained by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes exposed

134

to VIP or PACAP could repress the viral production in human lung cells. While the

135

transference of CM from uninfected monocytes, treated or nor with either

136

neuropeptide, did not modify the virus growth, the addition of CM (at 50% vol/vol –

137

the combination of fresh medium at this ratio did not alter the basal replication of

138

SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells, Fig. 2E) from infected monocytes increased viral

139

replication 33% when compared to cells maintained with the equivalent

140

combination of fresh media (Fig. 2E). However, when infected Calu-3 cells were

141

exposed to CM from infected monocytes treated with VIP or PACAP, we observed

142

a reduction of 30% and 21% in SARS-CoV-2 replication in these cells (Fig. 2E).

143

This finding raises the hypothesis that both neuropeptides, besides inhibiting the

144

SARS-CoV-2 gene replication, induce monocyte production and release of factors

145

endowed with antiviral activity, which may increase the resistance of neighboring

146

cells to SARS-CoV-2 growth. This bystander effect can reduce viral propagation,

147

thus eventually protecting the tissues from lesions secondary to SARS-CoV-2-

148

replication and dissemination. Future studies are needed to identify the nature of

149

these putative soluble factors.

150

Influence of peptidases on VIP and PACAP inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

151

replication in pulmonary cells. Lung cells are known to express several

152

peptidases (38–40), whose interaction with VIP and PACAP on the cell membrane

153

could modulate the effects of these neuropeptides, favoring or hindering the

154

SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitory effect. Thus, we evaluated the inhibitory

155

potential of VIP and PACAP in SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 cells in the presence

156

of Bestatin, an inhibitor of several aminopeptidases, including aminopeptidase N,

157

which also acts as receptor for the human coronavirus E229 (41), but not for

158

SARS-CoV-2 (42). While Bestatin alone (500 nM) did not change the virus yield

159

(Fig. 3A), we verified a gain of effect of VIP at 0.5 nM and 10 nM when combined

160

with Bestatin, (Fig. 3B). Moreover, PACAP achieved an optimal inhibitory

161

concentration at 5 nM when combined with Bestatin, a dose ten-times lower than

162

its optimal inhibitory concentration when alone (50 nM) (Fig. 3C). This result

163

suggests that VIP and PACAP could be targeted by some of the peptidases

164

expressed in pulmonary cells, thus requiring a high concentration to inhibit SARS-

165

CoV-2 replication in these cells.

166

Association with antivirals increments the neuropeptide anti-SARS-CoV-2

167

effect in pulmonary cells. Given the enhancement of PACAP-mediated SARS-

168

CoV-2 inhibition when in the presence of a protease inhibitor, we tested whether

169

the association of the neuropeptides with the protease-targeting antivirals could

170

also increase VIP and PACAP inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in pulmonary

171

cells, as several viral protease inhibitors can also target cell proteases and

172

peptidases (43). We tested the combination of VIP or PACAP with atazanavir, a

173

classical HIV-1 protease inhibitor which also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 (44), or with

174

ritonavir (whose aminopeptidase inhibition is more prominent than atazanavir

175

(43)). For comparison, we also evaluated the combination with remdesivir, an

176

inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2

177

replication in vitro (45). The concentrations used for atazanavir (ATV) and ritonavir

178

(RDV) were 5 uM, which did not significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig.

179

4A). The combination the neuropeptides with ATV, did not promote any increment

180

in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 4B and 4C). However, when in

181

combination with RTV, VIP and PACAP performed better than alone, with a higher

182

inhibition with VIP+RTV at 5 nM than VIP alone at the same concentration; and

183

PACAP achieving an optimal inhibitory concentration of 5 nM (Fig. 4C), equal to

184

that observed when combined to Bestatin (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, the association

185

of VIP or PACAP with remdesivir (RDV) resulted in a strong potentiation of VIP

186

and PACAP inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4B and 4C).

187

VIP and PACAP reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines by SARS-

188

CoV-2-infected monocytes and Calu-3 cells. Given the hypothesis that

189

controlling the production of proinflammatory cytokines may be critical for reducing

190

SARS-CoV-2 replication and limiting tissue damages, and based on evidence that

191

VIP and PACAP can regulate the inflammatory response (27,46), we next

192

evaluated whether both neuropeptides could attenuate the production of

193

proinflammatory mediators by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes or lung epithelial

194

cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes produced large

195

amounts of the proinflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and MIF relative to

196

uninfected cells (15, 4, 12 and 18 times more, respectively). In contrast, the

197

treatment of monocytes with either neuropeptide after SARS-CoV-2 infection

198

reduced to 66%, 50%, 66% and 50% the cellular production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF- α

199

and MIF, respectively. Furthermore, VIP and PACAP reverted by approximately

200

the same degree the release of IL-6 and IL-8 by Calu-3 cells (Fig. 5B), implying

201

that VIP and PACAP may offer a critical protection to inflamed lungs affected by

202

SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because proinflammatory cytokines may favor SARS-

203

CoV-2 replication, which, in turn, can amplify the cellular synthesis of these

204

mediators, these findings may support our assumption that VIP and PACAP offer

205

tissue protection by inhibiting virus replication and regulating the boost of cytokine

206

production.

207

VIP and PACAP regulate the activation of transcription factors in SARS-CoV-

208

2-infected monocytes. Based on the fact that the transcription factor NF-kB is

209

critically involved in the cellular production of inflammatory mediators (47), and on

210

our own findings that VIP and PACAP can inhibit its activation in HIV-1-infected

211

macrophages (33), we investigated whether both neuropeptides would exert this

212

same effect on SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, we

213

initially observed that NF-kB is up-modulated in infected cells (as measured by the

214

increased amount of phosphorylated NF-kBp65 subunit) and, in addition, that VIP

215

and PACAP reduced the NF-KBp65 phosphorylation, evidencing the significant

216

anti-NF-kBp65 activity of VIP and PACAP. We believe that the SARS-CoV-2-

217

induced NF-kB activation could have contributed for the elevated production of

218

proinflammatory cytokines by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, and that the

219

inhibition of this transcription factor by VIP and PACAP was critical for the

220

decreased synthesis of these mediators by the same cells. Following, we analyzed

221

the effects of both neuropeptides on the activation of CREB, a transcription factor

222

induced by several GPCR ligands, including VIP and PACAP (48), and also

223

involved in the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines (49,50). CREB and NF-kB

224

share the CREB-binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300 protein) as a cofactor, and

225

CREB activation results in the inhibition of NF-kB (51). We found that activation of

226

CREB was diminished in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, a finding coherent

227

with NF-kB activation in the same cells (Fig. 6B). Consistent with this finding, VIP

228

and PACAP promoted CREB activation (as measured by augmentation of CREB

229

phosphorylation) in those infected monocytes, a result matching the inhibition of

230

NF-kB and the reduction of cellular production of proinflammatory cytokines.

231

We also evaluated in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes the expression of

232

the active form of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, a transcription factor that also interacts

233

with CBP/p300 (52), and is crucial for the replication of several viruses, including

234

coronaviruses (53–55). In fact, we and other authors reported that SARS-CoV-2

235

infection promotes the activation of SREBP, and that this activation is associated

236

with enhanced viral replication (56) and COVID-19 disease severity(57). We found

237

that the levels of both isoforms of SREBP in active state are increased in SARS-

238

CoV-2-infected monocytes, but reduced in infected monocytes exposed to VIP and

239

PACAP when compared to the untreated infected cells, lowering to the same basal

240

levels found in uninfected monocytes (Fig. 6C and 6D, Supp. Fig. 1).

241

Together, these results suggest that the restriction of SARS-CoV-2

242

replication in monocytes and, possibly, in pulmonary cells (represented in this

243

work by the Calu-3 cell line) by VIP and PACAP can also be the outcome of the

244

intrinsic modulation of transcription factors related to the regulation of inflammatory

favoring the cellular damage, through exacerbating the inflammation, or by

247

promoting a permissive cellular microenvironment for viral replication.

Plasma levels of VIP are elevated in patients with severe forms of COVID-19.

249

Based on our results showing that VIP and PACAP, besides inhibiting viral

250

replication and production, can also control the production of proinflammatory

251

mediators by SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and lung epithelial cells, we

252

measured the levels of both neuropeptides in plasma samples of SARS-CoV-2-

253

infected individuals. We found that the amount of VIP is significantly elevated in

254

patients affected by the most severe forms of infection, relative to levels of

255

uninfected healthy controls and asymptomatic/mild patients (Fig. 7A). We also

256

observed that some critically ill patients had increased levels of PACAP, but

257

without statistical significance when considering the entire group (Fig. 7B). In

258

addition, levels of VIP positively correlated with levels of C-reactive protein (CRP)

259

(Fig. 7C), but neither VIP nor PACAP levels correlated with other inflammatory

260

markers, such as D-dimer, fibrinogen or IL-6 (data not shown), or with each other

261

(Fig. 7D). We found a positive correlation between VIP levels and viral load in

270

Taking into account that VIP and PACAP regulate inflammatory reactions, it

271

is possible that their increased circulating amounts reflect a counter-regulatory

272

effect elicited by the dysregulated immune response typical of the more severe

273

clinical status of COVID-19 patients. The levels of VIP and PACAP in SARS-CoV-

274

2-infected tissues should be a matter of future studies, to support our hypothesis.

275

Discussion

276

In this work, we report that the neuropeptides VIP and PACAP, endogenous

277

molecules presenting anti-inflammatory properties, are able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2

278

RNA synthesis and viral production and reduce the exacerbated synthesis of

279

proinflammatory mediators due to infection, in human monocytes and lung

280

epithelial cells. Also, we identified that VIP plasma levels are elevated in patients

281

with severe forms of COVID-19, corresponding with viral load, and elevated VIP

282

levels at ICU admission predicts patients’ favorable outcome, including association

283

with patient survival. Our findings provide the scientific basis for clinical trials with

284

VIP (Aviptadil), which can be used in intravenous (58) and inhaled (59)

285

formulations. Indeed, first results of clinical studies with VIP are expected to be

286

disclosed in the next year (58,59). Clinical data, along with mechanism described

287

here, may allow additional larger trials with VIP, an overlooked molecule

288

associated with antiviral, anti-inflammatory and enhanced survival activities.

289

Both neuropeptides regulate the inflammatory response due to their ability

290

to decrease the production of proinflammatory mediators, and to elicit the

291

production of anti-inflammatory molecules, Given that VIP and PACAP and their

292

receptors are systemically distributed, including the lungs (22,60), brain and gut,

293

we believe that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of both neuropeptides would not be

294

restricted to the respiratory tract, as shown by many studies in other chronic

295

inflammatory illnesses.

296

Here, we initially observed that VIP and PACAP decreased the genome

297

replication of SARS-CoV-2 in monocytes, in parallel with protecting the cells from

298

virus-induced cytopathicity. By diminishing the intracellular levels of viral RNA and

299

other viral molecules, VIP and PACAP could prevent the cell death by pyroptosis,

300

which has been described as one of the main causes of cell damage during

301

SARS-CoV-2 infection (13,14). While preserving the viability of monocytes, VIP

302

and PACAP also diminished the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6,

303

IL-8, TNF-α and MIF by these cells, which is in agreement with the reported ability

304

of these neuropeptides to regulate the inflammatory response (24–27,61). We

305

found similar results with lung epithelial cells, further supporting the assumption

306

that VIP and PACAP may offer a critical protection to inflamed lungs affected by

307

SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because these mediators are elevated in patients with

308

COVID-19, it is possible that the higher amounts of VIP in patients with severe

309

forms of infection may reflect a counter-regulatory feedback elicited by the

310

dysregulated immune response of these patients. Interestingly, the cellular

311

protection conferred by VIP or PACAP to SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes can be

312

transferred to other neighboring virus target cells (Fig. 2E), suggesting that a

313

bystander effect can ultimately protect other SARS-CoV-2-infected cells not

314

directly interacting with VIP or PACAP. More investigations are needed to identify

315

the nature of the putative protecting factors present in the monocyte supernatants.

316

The ability of VIP and PACAP to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2-induced activation

317

of the subunit p65 of the transcription factor NF-kB, pertain to a complex molecular

318

mechanism leading to reduction of proinflammatory cytokines synthesis by SARS-

319

CoV-2-infected monocytes. Also, we detected here that the transcription factor

320

CREB, which can act as a negative regulator of NF-kB (62,63), is down-regulated

321

in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, in opposition to NF-kB activation in the same

322

cells. In some models (64–69), CREB activation is related to induction of anti-

323

inflammatory cytokines concomitant with reduction of pro-inflammatory molecules,

324

mainly through direct transcription of its targets, such as IL-10, or through

325

competing

326

(49,62,63,69). Besides its role in the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory

327

cytokines, CREB activation is also involved with the anti-apoptotic response in

328

monocytes and macrophages, during differentiation and inflammatory stimuli

329

(70,71). Thus, the imbalance between CREB and NF-kB, either as a direct effect

330

of infection by SARS-CoV-2 or a consequence of exposure of bystander cells to

331

viral products and inflammatory molecules, could be an important target for

332

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 deleterious effects, at least in monocytes and probably

333

also in lung cells, as a similar imbalance between CREB and NF-kB was observed

334

in an acute inflammatory pulmonary condition (51).

335

The induction of SREBP activity by SARS-CoV-2 was consistent with data

showing its increase and association with COVID-19 severity in patients (57).

337

SREBPs are transcription factors that have well-defined roles in the regulation of

338

cellular lipid homeostasis (72). They exist in an inactive form associated to the

339

endoplasmatic reticulum, where initial activation occurs, completing the activation

340

in the Golgi apparatus before migrating to the nucleus (72). SREBP1 regulates the

341

expression of fatty acid biosynthesis genes, whilst SREBP2 regulates genes

342

involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, intracellular lipid movement and lipoprotein

343

import (72). While crucial for metabolic homeostasis, both transcription factors are

344

involved in pathologies when misbalanced or overactivated (72), and several

345

viruses are reported to induce their activation, as for their optimal replication, the

346

up-regulation of host lipid biosynthesis is a requirement (53–55). In fact, our group

347

just reported that SARS-CoV-2 activates SREBP-1 and other pathways of lipid

348

metabolism in human cells, and that lipid droplets enhance viral replication and

349

production of inflammatory mediators (56). The inhibition of SREBP activation in

350

SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes exposed to VIP and PACAP points to a possible

351

mechanism of viral inhibition directly related to the replicative cycle, since inhibiting

352

SREBPs activation, the replication process can be restrained via limiting the

353

supply of energy and building blocks, ultimately delaying or even stopping the

354

replicative process.

355

Similar to NF-kB and CREB, the association of SREBP with CBP/p300 (52)

356

makes its function susceptible to the availability of this co-factor, which abundance

357

can be low or high depending on the state of activation of NF-kB and CREB. Thus,

358

the modulation of each one of these factors by VIP and PACAP can reflect a fine

359

tuning of the transcriptional regulation of metabolic and inflammatory pathways,

360

which in turn can affect the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

361

Because VIP and PACAP signaling pathway outcome is dependent of the

362

combined action of the receptors activated by them (VIP and PACAP receptors

363

can elicit cell signaling in homo and hetero dimers (73)), we evaluated whether

364

they were involved in the final outcome analyzed. Our assays suggest that

365

signaling through the receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2 contributed for VIP- and

366

PACAP-mediated reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis in monocytes and viral

367

production in Calu-3 cells, with VPAC1 activation alone being able to reproduce

368

the SARS-CoV-2 inhibition promoted by the natural neuropeptides. The inhibition

369

profile of SARS-CoV-2 by VIP and PACAP in Calu-3 cells may be biased

370

regarding the expected action in the lungs, since Calu-3 cells appear to express

371

only VPAC1 (34). However, lung tissues, while reported to express high levels of

372

VPAC1, also express VPAC2 and PAC1 (35,37), and, more specifically, VPAC2

373

mRNA was detected in airway epithelial, glandular, and immune cells of the lung

374

(36). Therefore, while the inhibition curve of SARS-CoV-2 by VIP and PACAP in

375

Calu-3 cells points to different optimal doses than those obtained for monocytes, it

376

is possible that in normal lung cells and tissue, VIP and PACAP could present a

377

broader range of action in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, VIP and specific

378

agonists for VPAC1 or VPAC2 have been proposed and tested for respiratory

379

conditions, like asthma (74–76), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (74,77,78)

380

and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (74,75,79), demonstrating that

381

the anti-inflammatory actions of VIP/PACAP can be achieved in lung tissues.

382

Future studies should define which of these receptors would preferentially be

383

activated by specific agonists to restrain SARS-CoV-2 replication in lungs or other

384

sites. Together with the possible differences of receptor expression and self-

385

regulatory characteristics of GPCRs, a third regulation level of VIP and PACAP

386

action on pulmonary cells can be achieved by the activity of proteases and

387

peptidases, as lungs are described to express high levels of several of them in

388

both normal and pathological conditions (38–40). Some of these peptidases could

389

target VIP and PACAP, thus altering the ligand/receptor ratio and modulating the

390

signaling pathways.

391

The improvement of VIP and PACAP action on SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in

392

Calu-3 cells when combined with Bestatin, suggests that some aminopeptidases

393

are involved in the processing or degradation of these neuropeptides. Likewise,

394

the finding that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of both neuropeptides is enhanced

395

when they were combined with RTV, which per se did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2

396

replication but can inhibit cellular peptidases (43), supports the view that a

397

possible clinical use of VIP or PACAP for COVID-19 treatment would be aided by

398

a concomitant inhibition of aminopeptidases. In fact, Bestatin (Ubenimex) has

399

already been evaluated for clinical use for some types of cancer and

400

cardiovascular diseases, with no significant side effects (80,81). The strong

401

inhibition of virus production resulting from the combination of VIP and PACAP

402

with remdesivir raises the possibility that the direct inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

403

transcription by this antiviral could alleviate the excessive metabolic burden on

404

cellular processes, due to sheer reduction of viral load in the infected cells,

405

ultimately favoring the antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions of VIP and PACAP

406

on these cells.

407

Since up to now there are no antivirals specific to SARS-CoV-2, and that

408

the hyper-inflammation may persist even after the lowering of the viral load, the

409

searching for compounds that target the aberrant production of proinflammatory

410

cytokines and, simultaneously, the own viral replication, should be stimulated. Our

411

present results showing that VIP and PACAP hold these two critical activities point

412

these neuropeptides or their analogue molecules as potential therapeutic agents

413

for COVID-19.

The neuropeptides VIP and PACAP and the VPAC1 and VPAC2 agonists

441

(Ala11,22,28)-VIP and Bay 55-9837, respectively, were purchased from Tocris. The

442

PAC1 agonist Maxadilan was kindly donated by Dr. Ethan A. Lerner (Department

443

complete medium with treatments or not. For virus titration, monolayers of Vero E6

453

cells (2 x 104 cell/well) in 96-well plates were infected with serial dilutions of

454

supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C. Semi-solid high glucose

455

DMEM medium containing 2% FSB and 2.4% carboxymethylcellulose was added

456

and cultures were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. Then, the cells were fixed with

10% formalin for 2 hour at room temperature. The cell monolayer was stained with

458

0.04% solution of crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 1 hour. Plaque numbers were

Peripheral vein blood was also collected from 10 SARS-CoV-2-negative healthy

519

participants as tested by RT-PCR on the day of blood sampling. The

520

characteristics of severe (n=24), mild/asymptomatic (n=6) and healthy (n=10)

521

participants are presented in Table 1. Mild and severe COVID-19 patients

522

presented differences regarding the age and the presence of comorbidities as

523

obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (Table 1), which is consistent with

524

previously reported patient cohorts (2,83–85). The SARS-CoV-2-negative control

525

group, however, included subjects of older age and chronic non-communicable

526

diseases, so it is matched with mild and critical COVID-19 patients, except for

527

hypertension (Table 1). All ICU-admitted patients received usual supportive care

528

for severe COVID-19 and respiratory support with either noninvasive oxygen

529

supplementation (n=5) or mechanical ventilation (n=19) (Supplemental Table 1).

530

Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were managed with

531

neuromuscular blockade and a protective ventilation strategy that included low

532

tidal volume (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight) and limited driving pressure (less

533

than 16 cmH2O) as well as optimal PEEP calculated based on the best lung

534

compliance and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. In those with severe ARDS and PaO2/FiO2 ratio

535

below 150 despite optimal ventilatory settings, prone position was initiated. Our

536

management protocol included antithrombotic prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 to

537

60 mg per day. Patients did not receive routine steroids, antivirals or other anti-

538

inflammatory or anti-platelet drugs. The SARS-CoV-2-negative control participants

539

were not under anti-inflammatory or anti-platelet drugs for at least two weeks. All

540

clinical information was prospectively collected using a standardized form -

541

ISARIC/WHO Clinical Characterization Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections

542

(CCPBR). Clinical and laboratory data were recorded on admission in all severe

543

patients included in the study and the primary outcome analyzed was 28-day

544

mortality (n = 11 survivors and 13 non-survivors, Supplemental Table 2). Age and

545

the frequency of comorbidities were not different between severe patients

546

requiring mechanical ventilation or noninvasive oxygen supplementation neither

547

between survivors and non-survivors (Supplemental Table 1 and 2).

548

Statistical analysis. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism software

549

version 8. All the numerical variables were tested regarding their distribution using

550

the Shapiro-Wilk test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to

551

compare differences among 3 groups following a normal (parametric) distribution,

552

and Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to locate the differences between the groups;

553

or Friedman’s test (for non-parametric data) with Dunn’s post-hoc test.

554

Comparisons between 2 groups were performed using the Student t test for

555

parametric distributions or the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric

556

distributions. Correlation coefficients were calculated using Pearson’s correlation

557

test for parametric distributions and the Spearman’s correlation test for

558

nonparametric distributions.

Figure 5. VIP and PACAP reduce production of proinflammatory mediators by

961

SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes and Calu-3 cells. Monocytes and Calu-3 cells were

962

infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour, and then exposed to VIP or PACAP (10 nM each for

963

monocytes, 1 nM of VIP or 50 nM of PACAP for Calu-3 cells). The levels of IL-6, IL-8,

964

TNF-α and MIF were measured in culture supernatants of monocytes after 24 hours (A),

965

and of IL-6 and IL-8 after 48 hours for Calu-3 cells (B), by ELISA. Data represent means ±

Figure 6. VIP and PACAP regulate the activation of transcription factors in SARS-

968

CoV-2-infected monocytes. Monocytes were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and, 1 hour later,

969

the infected cells were exposed (or not - Nil) to VIP or PACAP (at 10 nM). After 24 hours,

970

the cells were lysed and the ratios between phosphoNF-kBp65/total NF-kBp65 (A),

971

phosphoCREB/total CREB (B), active SREBP-1/β-actin (C), and active SREBP-2/β-actin

972

(D) were quantified by ELISA (A and B) or by western blot (C and D) in the cell lysates.

The levels of VIP (A) and PACAP (B) in the plasma of SARS-CoV-2-negative control

976

participants, SARS-CoV-2-positive asymptomatic subjects, or symptomatic patients

977

presenting mild to severe COVID-19 syndrome were quantified by ELISA. Correlation

978

between levels of VIP and CRP (C) and levels of both neuropeptides (D) in the plasma

979

from patients with COVID-19. Correlation between viral load and VIP (E) or PACAP (F) in

980

mild and severe patients with detectable swabs samples. (G and I) Severe COVID-19

981

patients admitted to the ICU were stratified between those requiring invasive mechanical

982

ventilation or noninvasive O2 supplementation. (H and J) Severe COVID-19 patients were

983

stratified according to the 28-day mortality outcome as survivors or non survivors. One

984

outlier (CRP = 621.64 mg/dL) was excluded from the analysis in panels C-D according to

985

the ROUT test. Linear regression (with the 95 % confidence interval) and Spearman’s

986

correlation were calculated according to the distribution of the dots (controls: grey;

987

asymptomatics: brown; mild: green; severe: red). The horizontal lines in the box plots

988

represent the median, the box edges represent the interquartile ranges, and the whiskers

989

indicate the minimal and maximal value in each group. *p ≤ .05; **p ≤ .01.
