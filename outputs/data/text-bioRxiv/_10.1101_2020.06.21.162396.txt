Abstract: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (1), was declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020 (2). While awaiting a vaccine, several antivirals are
being used to manage the disease with limited success (3, 4). To expand this arsenal, we screened 4
compound libraries: a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, an
angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) targeted compound library, a flavonoid compound library as
well as a natural product library. Of the 121 compounds identified with activity against SARS-CoV-2, 7
were shortlisted for validation. We show for the first time that the active form of Vitamin D, calcitriol,
exhibits significant potent activity against SARS-CoV-2. This finding paves the way for consideration
of host-directed therapies for ring prophylaxis of contacts of SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Despite implementation of physical distancing, mask wearing, quarantine and the tireless efforts
expended for contact tracing, the rapid transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 even during the asymptomatic
phase has made containment of this virus extremely difficult. The main proposed strategy to curb this
pandemic is the implementation of mass vaccination programs. Once a suitable vaccine is
discovered, the significant challenges associated with vaccination programs e.g. limitations in
manufacturing capabilities and associated costs, are anticipated to significantly affect uptake of
vaccinations globally. We therefore propose that ring prophylaxis, which had been previously
proposed for influenza pandemics and involves treating close contacts of a confirmed case with an
antiviral prophylaxis to further curb community spread(5), be considered as a viable strategy to
reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In an effort to identify potential candidates for SARS-CoV-2 chemoprophylaxis, we performed a virusinduced cytopathic effect (CPE) based screen of several small molecule libraries in SARS-CoV-2infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1a). The African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells were used
for the screen as these cells are highly susceptible to coronaviruses and exhibit obvious CPE upon
infection. A 57-compound natural product library and a library of 462 ACE2 targeted inhibitors (the
ACE2 receptor was identified to be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection (6)) were used in a preinfection treatment screen to identify potential viral entry inhibitors, while a post-infection treatment
screen was performed using both a 500 compound flavonoid library and a 1172 FDA-approved
compound libraries in order to identify potential inhibitors targeting post-entry steps of the SARS-CoV2 replication cycle. For the pre-infection treatment screen, Vero E6 cells were treated with compounds
for two hours prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The post-infection treatment screen on the other
hand was performed by adding compounds to the Vero E6 cells 1 hour post-infection with SARSCoV-2. Compounds which showed less than 50% CPE compared to the 0.1%DMSO vehicle control
with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified as hits (Tables S1- S3). Using this method, we identified
31 compounds from the pre-infection treatment screen and 90 compounds from the post-infection
treatment screen with activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Table S4). As expected, our hit list included the
tyrosine kinase inhibitors masitinib and imatinib mesylate (7), the antiretroviral drug lopinavir(8) and
the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (9) – all compounds reported to inhibit SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or
MERS-CoV. This provides the robustness and confidence of our primary screen for potential antivirals
against SARS-CoV-2.
Of these primary hits, 7 compounds were selected for downstream validation (Table 1). These
included 3 compounds from the pre-infection treatment screen (citicoline, pravastatin sodium and
tenofovir alafenamide) and four compounds from the post-infection treatment screen (imatinib
mesylate, calcitriol, dexlansoprazole, and prochlorperazine dimaleate). These compounds were
selected based on level of CPE inhibition in the primary screens (Fig. 1b), known mechanism of
action and existing FDA approval or Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status. FDA approval was
considered an important factor as pre-existing data on safety and dosage would allow expedited
decisions to be made regarding the potential use of these compounds in vulnerable populations to
stymie the current pandemic. Validation assays to determine changes in infectious virus titres upon
treatment was carried out by testing selected hit compounds in dose-dependent assays in Vero E6 to

confirm the primary screen observation and also in the human hepatocarcinoma HuH7 cell line as the
latter cell line expresses high levels of the ACE2 receptor (10) and supports replication of
coronaviruses (11). Cell viability assays were also carried out to ensure that reduction of SARS-CoV2 titres was not due to cytotoxic effects of the compounds on host cells. CC50, IC50 were obtained for
each of the 7 compounds in Vero E6 cells (Table S5) and HuH7 cells (Table S6) and where possible
selectivity index values were calculated. Pre-infection treatment of Vero E6 cells with citicoline and
pravastatin sodium resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a & 2b), while a nondose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at lower concentrations was observed with tenofovir
alafenamide (Fig. 2c). These observations were however not recapitulated in HuH7 cell line (Fig. 2d,
2e & 2f). Post-infection treatment with ≥ 10 μM imatinib mesylate resulted in a reduction of SARSCoV-2 titres to non-detectable levels in both Vero E6 and HuH7 cells (Fig. 2g & 2k), and a similar
finding was observed with ≥ 10 μM prochlorperazine dimaleate in HuH7 cells (Fig. 2n). Significant
reductions of at least 0.4 log10 of SARS-CoV-2 were also noted upon treatment with ≥10 μM
dexlansoprazole (Fig. 2i, 2m) and post-infection treatment with 10 μM calcitriol resulted in a 1.3 log10
reduction of SARS-CoV-2 titre in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2h). This finding could not be recapitulated in
HuH7 cells (Fig. 2l) most likely because the CC50 value of calcitriol was 4.7 μM in HuH7 cells (Table
S6). Given that the HuH7 cell line is a hepatocarcinoma cell line and therefore not the first point of
entry for SARS-CoV-2 in humans, we decided to test the three most promising compounds (imatinib
mesylate, citicoline and calcitriol) against SARS-CoV-2 in the primary human nasal epithelial cell line
(hNEC) that is a known in vivo target of SARS-CoV-2 (12) (Fig. 1a). Despite its significant activity in
the continuous cell lines (Vero E6 and HuH7), in hNECs, imatinib mesylate only displayed a 0.2 log10
reduction in viral titre (Fig. 3). Interestingly, out of the three compounds only calcitriol proved effective
against SARS-CoV-2 with a reduction of 0.69 log10 in viral titre (Fig. 3). While recent data has shown
that vitamin D levels are negatively associated with morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 cases (13,
14), this is the first report of a direct inhibitory effect of calcitriol on SARS-CoV-2.
Vitamin D is well known to modulate host immune responses through the production of the
antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin to promote autophagy (15). It has proven essential for host
defenses

against many intracellular

pathogens

including

respiratory pathogens

such as

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and has been shown to also possess anti-inflammatory properties(15). A
recent study by Smith and colleagues (16) showed an association between vitamin D deficiency and
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 associated mortality. The authors speculated that vitamin D
supplementation could protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve patient disease
outcomes(16), and our finding certainly provides credence to this hypothesis. Given that calcitriolmediated inhibition occurred upon post-treatment of Vero E6 cells and hNECs, it is likely that its
mechanism of antiviral action targets the post-entry phase of viral replication.
Use of Host-directed therapies (HDTs) for prevention of infections is certainly not a new idea. Most of
these therapies however rely mainly on the use of vaccines, convalescent plasma and monoclonal
antibodies (17, 18). Small molecule HDTs have been used adjunctively for diseases such as
tuberculosis (19) and have been proposed for viral pandemics (5). This strategy would overcome
some of the costs and challenges associated with antiviral production, including the emergence of

drug resistance (20). Vitamin D is a dietary supplement that is cheap and widely available even in low
and middle income countries and is converted by the liver and kidneys into the active compound
calcitriol (21, 22). It is however important that our findings be confirmed in vivo as well as in clinical
trials in order to assess efficacy, optimal dosage, treatment duration, toxicity and safety of calcitriol.
Given the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 globally (23), if these findings can be replicated in
clinical trials, calcitriol may certainly prove to be an effective tool in the effort to control the pandemic
while waiting for an effective vaccine to be rolled out globally. At the very least, these findings
certainly pave the way for consideration of host-directed therapies for ring prophylaxis of contacts of
SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Methods
Cell lines and Viruses. African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6; ATCC CRL-1586™), human
hepatoma cells (HuH7; Dr Priscilla Yang, Harvard Medical School, USA) and human nasal epithelial
cells (hNECs; Dr Wang De Yun, National University of Singapore, Singapore) were utilised in this
study. Vero E6 and HuH7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)
(Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and buffered with 2 g
sodium hydrogen carbonate.
hNECs were derived from in vitro differentiation of human nasal epithelial stem/progenitor cells
(hNESPCs) obtained from healthy adult donors scheduled for septal plastic surgery. Approval to
collect the tissue biopsies was obtained from the National Healthcare Group Domain-Specific Board
of Singapore (DSRB Ref: D/11/228) and the institutional review board of the National University of
Singapore (IRB Ref: 13-509). Written consent was also obtained from the donors prior to tissue
biopsies collection. At the time of biopsies collection, all subjects were free of upper respiratory tract
infection and rhinitis symptoms. Once the hNESPCs were isolated and enriched using standardised
protocols (24, 25), the hNESPCs were expanded and subjected to ALI culture in Transwells for in vitro
differentiation (24, 25). The expanded hNESPCs were then transferred onto 12-well 0.4 μm Transwell
inserts (Corning). Once the cells became confluent, growth medium was discarded and 700 μl of
PneumaCult™-ALI Medium with inducer supplements (STEMCELL Technologies) was added to the
basal chamber to establish ALI conditions. The cells were cultured in ALI culture for 4 weeks, with
media change every 2-3 days. hNECs were obtained after 3-4 weeks of differentiation were then
subjected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. All cultures were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2.
SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Singapore/10/2020) was isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab of a COVID19 patient in February 2020. The virus isolate was validated by qRT-PCR and propagated in Vero E6
cells with no more than 3 passages prior to drug screening. The virus genome (EPI_ISL_410716) has
been released to GISAID by the National Public Health Laboratory, National Centre for Infectious
Diseases, Singapore and belongs to Clade O. All virus work was performed in a biosafety level 3
(BSL-3) laboratory and all protocols were approved by the BSL-3 Biosafety Committee and
Institutional Biosafety Committee of the National University of Singapore.
Preparation of compound libraries for primary screen. A primary screen to identify novel
compounds with potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed on four

different libraries, namely, a 462-compound ACE2-targeted compound library (CADD) (TargetMol),
57-compounds natural product library, 500-compound flavonoids library (TimTec) and 1172compound FDA-approved drug library (Selleckchem). Compounds were first dissolved in 100%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock concentration of 10 mM, followed by dilution to 100 μM in
serum-free media. Compounds were stored at ‐20°C till further use.
Primary screen with pre-treatment using ACE2-targeted inhibitors and 57-compound natural
product libraries. Vero E6 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (Corning) at a seeding density of
4

1×10 cells per 100 µl and incubated overnight prior to drug inhibitory assay. Pre-infection treatment
drug assays were performed by treating cells with 10 µM of ACE2-targeted inhibitors and the 57compound natural product libraries for 2 h at 37°C. 0.1% DMSO and 100 μM remdesivir were
included as vehicle and positive controls, respectively. Treated cells were then washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1
and incubated for 4 days at 37°C, 5% CO2, before formalin fixation, analysis and hit selection.
Primary screen with post-treatment using FDA-approved drugs and flavonoids library. Vero E6
cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (Corning) at a seeding density of 1×104 cells per 100 µl and
incubated overnight. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection at a MOI of 1 for 1 h. Final
concentrations of 10 µM of FDA-approved drugs and 50 µM of flavonoids were added to SARS-CoV2-infected cells, respectively. 0.1% DMSO and 100 μM remdesivir were included as vehicle and
positive controls, respectively. Cells were then incubated for 4 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 before formalin
fixation, analysis and hit selection.
Selection of hits via analysis of cytopathic effects (CPE). For selection of hits at 4 days post
infection, differences in cell viability caused by virus-induced CPE and/or compound-specific toxicity
were visually analysed using light microscopy (Olympus). Hits were identified and selected based on
the reduction of CPE and > 50% inhibition in duplicate wells in comparison to vehicle control.
Validation of hits. Hits identified from the primary screens were validated using cell viability and
dose-dependent inhibition assays on Vero E6 and HuH7 cells. To determine the cell viability profiles
of the selected compounds, Vero E6 and HuH7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at seeding

densities of 1×10 cells and 7.5×10 cells per 100 µl, respectively. Both cell lines were pre-treated with
the hit compounds from the ACE2-targeted library, namely citicoline, pravastatin sodium and tenofovir
alafenamide for 2 h at a range of concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 20 µM). Hits identified from the
FDA-approved

drug

library,

namely,

imatinib

mesylate,

calcitriol,

dexlansoprazole

and

prochlorperazine dimaleate were added to the cells with the same concentration range and incubated
for 4 days. After incubation, the media was removed from the plates and washed once with PBS
before addition of alamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:10 in media
with 2% FCS. Fluorescence was detected after 2.5 h incubation at an excitation wavelength of 570
nm and an emission wavelength of 600 nm on an Infinite 200 Pro multiplate reader (Tecan). Data
obtained from compound-treated cells and vehicle-treated cells were normalised against those
obtained from untreated cells.
Validation of the primary hits was performed via dose-dependent inhibition assays. Vero E6 and
HuH7 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates and incubated overnight prior to drug inhibitory assays.

Pre-infection treatment with citicoline, pravastatin sodium and tenofovir alafenamide at working
concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 20 µM was carried out for 2 h at 37°C. The inhibitors were removed
and washed twice with PBS prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection at an MOI of 1. For validation of imatinib
mesylate, calcitriol, dexlansoprazole and prochlorperazine dimaleate, Vero E6 and HuH7 cells were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 for 1 h at 37°C and then incubated with the compounds at
working concentrations. All dose-dependent inhibition assay plates were incubated for 4 days at 37°C,
5% CO2, prior to harvesting of viral supernatants for virus titration.
Validations of imantib mesylate, calcitrol and citicoline with primary cell line, hNEC at 10 µM.
hNECs were seeded in apical chambers of the Transwell inserts for 4 weeks prior to drug inhibitory
assays. Pre-infection treatment with citicoline at 10 µM was added to the basal chamber and carried
out for 2 h at 37°C. The inhibitors were removed and replaced with fresh PneumaCult™-ALI Medium
(STEMCELL Technologies) prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection at an MOI of 0.1. For validation of imatinib
mesylate and calcitriol, hNECs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h at 37°C before
incubation with the compounds at 10 µM. All inhibition assay plates were incubated for 4 days at
37°C, 5% CO2, prior to harvesting of viral supernatants for virus titration.
Plaque Assay. To determine the virus titer, viral supernatants harvested were 10-fold serially diluted
in DMEM. 200 µl of each serial diluted supernatant were applied to confluent Vero E6 cells. After 1 h
of absorption, the inoculum was removed and 500 µl of 0.5% agarose overlay was added to each well
and incubated for 3 days at 37°C, 5% CO2 to facilitate plaque formation. The cells were fixed with
formalin overnight and the agarose was removed before staining with crystal violet for 5 minutes. The
number of plaques were counted and the virus titer of individual samples were expressed in the
logarithm of plaque forming units (pfu) per ml.
Statistical Analyses. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the statistical
significance of data obtained. Drug-treated samples expressing statistical difference when compared
to control samples were subsequently subjected to a Dunnett’s post-test, with * denoting that p < 0.05,
** denoting that p < 0.01 and *** denoting that p < 0.001.

Figure 1: Schematic overview of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug screening procedure. (a) ACE2
targeted inhibitors and compounds from the natural product library were applied prior to infection with
SARS-CoV-2 (pre-infection treatment) while compounds from the FDA-approved library and the
flavonoid library were applied post infection (post- infection treatment). Out of 2191 compounds
tested, 121 displayed viral CPE reductions and 7 were selected for further validations using Vero E6,
HuH7, and hNEC cell lines. (b) Uninfected cells, infected cells treated with 0.1% DMSO and infected
cells treated with remdesivir were included as controls.
Figure 2: Validation of primary hits. For validating compounds with activity pre-infection, Vero E6
cells were first pre-treated with increasing concentrations of (a) citicoline, (b) pravastatin sodium and
(c) tenofovir alafenamide prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, Huh7 cells were also pretreated with (d) citicoline, (e) pravastatin sodium and (f) tenofovir alafenamid and subsequently
infected with SARS-CoV-2. For post-infection treatment validation, Vero E6 cells were infected with
SARS-CoV-2 and treated with increasing concentrations of (g) imatinib mesylate, (h) calcitriol, (i)
dexlansoprazole and (j) prochlorperazine dimaleate. Similarly, HuH7 cells were also infected and
treated with a range of concentrations of (k) imatinib mesylate, (l) calcitriol, (m) dexlansoprazole and
(n) prochlorperazine dimaleate. The primary and secondary exes correspond to the viral titre and
relative cell viability, and the dashed line represents the CC50 cut-off for cell viability. * denotes p <
0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. Error bars represent the standard deviation observed from the
means of triplicates performed for both cell viability and dose-dependent inhibition studies.
Figure 3: Validation of primary hits in hNECs. hNECs were either pre-treated with 10 μM citicoline
prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection or treated following SARS-CoV-2 infection with 10 μM imatinib
mesylate and 10 μM calcitriol. ** denotes that p < 0.01. Error bars represent the standard deviation
observed from the means of triplicates performed for dose-dependent inhibition studies.

antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
