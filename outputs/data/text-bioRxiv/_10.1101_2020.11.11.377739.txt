ABSTRACT
The Nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 regulates the translation of host and viral mRNAs in cells. Nsp1
inhibits host translation initiation by occluding the entry channel of the 40S ribosome subunit. The
structural study of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1-ribosomal complexes reported post-termination 80S complex
containing Nsp1 and the eRF1 and ABCE1 proteins. Considering the presence of Nsp1 in the posttermination 80S ribosomal complex simultaneously with eRF1, we hypothesized that Nsp1 may be
involved in translation termination. Using a cell-free translation system and reconstituted in vitro
translation system, we show that Nsp1 stimulates translation termination in the stop codon recognition
stage at all three stop codons. This stimulation targets the release factor 1 (eRF1) and does not affect the
release factor 3 (eRF3). The activity of Nsp1 in translation termination is provided by its N-terminal
domain and the minimal required part of eRF1 is NM domain. We assume that biological meaning of
Nsp1 activity in translation termination is binding with the 80S ribosomes translating host mRNAs and
removal them from the pool of the active ribosomes.

INTRODUCTION
Currently, the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 pandemic continues around the world, having already
killed more than 1 million people. The causative agent of COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to the beta-coronavirus group (Zhu et al., 2020).
Its genome consists of a single-stranded (+) RNA, approximately 30,000 nt long, containing 14 open
reading frames (ORFs) encoding 27 proteins. The two overlapping 5'-end frames ORF1a and ORF1b
encode large polypeptides (490 and 794 kDa, respectively), which are subsequently proteolytically
cleaved by viral proteases (Nsp3 and Nsp5), generating the unstructured proteins Nsp1-Nsp16. The
ORF1b polypeptide synthesis occurs via a -1 frameshift just before the ORF1a stop codon. The RNAdependent RNA polymerase NSP12 encoded within the ORF1b ensures the replication of the viral
genome, also producing additional truncated RNA products with open reading frames for the synthesis of
the remaining SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Kim et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). It has been
shown that among all SARS-CoV-2 proteins, Nsp1 is a major viral factor that affects cellular viability
(Yuan et al., 2020).
Nsp1 is the first protein produced by a virus. It affects the vital activity of the infected cell and is
necessary for the development of viral particles. Nsp1 induces apoptosis, and alters the transcriptional
profile of cells by blocking the transcription of genes responsible for cell metabolism, regulation of the cell
cycle, mitochondrial function, antigen presentation, ubiquitin/proteasome pathways, and protein synthesis
(Yuan et al., 2020). Moreover, Nsp1 directly inhibits translation both in vitro in the cell-free translation
systems and in vivo in the cells (Banerjee et al., 2020; Schubert et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Tidu et al.,
2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Therewith, viral mRNAs are less susceptible to translation inhibition due to the
presence of an SL1 hairpin in their 5'UTR (Banerjee et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020). Nsp1mediated inhibition of translation leads to suppression of the host interferon response, which is one of the
main mechanisms of cellular defense against viral replication (Banerjee et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020;
Xia et al., 2020).
Nsp1 of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a small protein of 180 amino acid residues, consisting of N- and
C-terminal domains connected by an unstructured linker (Shi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). The N-domain
of this protein interacts with the 5 'UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA, which is necessary for its efficient
translation (Shi et al., 2020). Mutations in the N-domain also lead to a decrease in the level of apoptosis
of infected cells (Yuan et al., 2020). The C-domain of Nsp1 binds to the entry channel of the 40S
ribosome subunit. In this case, the 40S subunit associated with Nsp1 binds to mRNA much worse and is
unable to form a native translation initiation complex. Thus, Nsp1 inhibits the initiation of host mRNA
translation (Banerjee et al., 2020; Lapointe et al., 2020; Schubert et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Thoms et
al., 2020; Tidu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). In addition to free 40S subunits, Nsp1 SARS-CoV-2 is also
found in aberrant 48S initiator complexes and 80S ribosomes (Lapointe et al., 2020; Schubert et al.,
2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). It should be noted that binding to the 40S subunit of
homologous Nsp1 in closely related SARS-CoV does not block the formation of the 48S initiator complex
but inhibits the attachment of the 60S subunit to it and causes inhibition of the translation initiation
(Kamitani et al., 2009). Some of the 80S ribosomes with Nsp1 SARS-CoV-2 contain additional proteins
involved in translation termination and ribosome recycling, i.e., the eukaryotic release factor eRF1 and
ABCE1 (Thoms et al., 2020). This prompted us to address a possible role of Nsp1 in translation
termination.

Translation termination is the final stage of protein biosynthesis, in which the nascent polypeptide
releases from the ribosome. Translation termination begins when one of the three stop codons appears in
the A site of the ribosome (Jackson et al., 2012). The ribosome then binds eRF1 that recognizes all three
stop codons (Brown et al., 2015; Frolova et al., 1994; Kryuchkova et al., 2013; Matheisl et al., 2015; Song
et al., 2000). A partner protein of eRF1 is eRF3, the GTPase that activates eRF1 (Alkalaeva et al., 2006;
Cheng et al., 2009; Frolova et al., 1996; Shao et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2012). Concerted binding of the
eRF1-eRF3-GTP complex with the ribosome stimulates GTPase activity of eRF3, which, in turn, causes a
conformational change of eRF1 (Cheng et al., 2009). As a result, the catalytic GGQ motif of eRF1 is
juxtaposed to the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome. This induces the hydrolysis of peptidyltRNA and the release of the synthesized protein (Alkalaeva et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2015; Frolova et al.,
1999; Jackson et al., 2012; Matheisl et al., 2015; Song et al., 2000). Termination of translation is one of
the critical stages of protein biosynthesis because its suppression allows for inhibiting both the release of
peptides from the ribosomes and the transition of the ribosomes to recycling, consequently, to prevent
new rounds of translation.
The simultaneous binding of the eRF1 and Nsp1 to the 80S ribosomes (Thoms et al., 2020),
implies a possible role of Nsp1 in translation termination, which has not been elucidated yet. To study an
effect of Nsp1 on the termination of host translation, we used the reconstituted mammalian translation
system (Alkalaeva et al., 2006) as well as pre-termination complexes (preTCs) purified from rabbit
reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (Susorov et al., 2020). We demonstrate that Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 stimulates
translation termination and determines the stage of termination at which it works. Direct involvement in
translation termination of Nsp1 was confirmed by studying activities of the mutants of Nsp1. The data
obtained allow us to propose a possible mechanism of control of translation on the stage of termination by
SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1.

RESULTS
Nsp1 stimulates peptide release
To study the activity of Nsp1 in translation termination, the codon-optimized sequence of the SARS-CoV2 Nsp1 was cloned into the petSUMO vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Noteworthy, the
resulting Nsp1 lacked any tag. We first verified the ability of the recombinant Nsp1 to inhibit translation.
For this purpose, translation of Nluc mRNA in RRL was assayed in the presence of Nsp1 (Fig. 1A). We
confirmed that our preparation of the recombinant tag-free Nsp1 significantly inhibited the translation of
Nluc mRNA in the cell-free system.
Next, we evaluated a possible effect of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 on translation termination. The result
of translation termination is the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA and the release of the nascent peptide from
the ribosome. We performed an analysis of a peptide release efficiency using the Termi-Luc approach
developed recently by Susorov et al. (2020). Pretermination complexes PreTCs, containing NanoLuc
luciferase (Nluc) located at the P site of the ribosome in the peptidyl-tRNA form and UAA stop codon at
the A site, were purified from the RRL. The addition of the release factors to the purified preTC triggers
the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and induces the release of Nluc from the ribosome. Human release factors
eRF1 and eRF3a, together with Nsp1, were added to the preTC, and the appearance of luminescence
was measured over time. Nsp1 is unable to perform peptide release by itself, however it significantly
stimulates translation termination induced by eRF1 alone and by the complex of eRF1-eRF3a (Fig. 1B).
As a negative control we used eukaryotic initiation translation factor eIF1A, which is of a similar size and
binds close to the Nsp1 binding site on the ribosome. Interestingly, eIF1A was shown to be involved into
ribosomal recycling after translation termination (Pisarev et al., 2007), however here we did not detect its
influence on peptide release. Probably it was due to the absence in the mixture of the other eukaryotic
initiation factors and the recycling protein ABCE1.
Considering data on Nsp1 activity in peptide release, we concluded that the presence of Nsp1 in
the 80S ribosomal complexes (Thoms et al., 2020) reflects its functional significance in translation
termination.
Nsp1 stimulates the termination complexes formation
To study a molecular mechanism of the stimulation of translation termination by Nsp1, we tested its
activity on the purified preTCs obtained in the reconstituted translation system (Alkalaeva et al., 2006).
We assembled preTCs from individual components on the model MVHL mRNAs with the UAA stop codon
and purified them by centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. These complexes were then used to
test the effect of Nsp1 on the formation of termination complexes (TCs) by fluorescent toe-print analysis,
which shows the position of ribosomal complexes on mRNA. When stop codon is recognized by eRF1,
the ribosome changes conformation of the +4 nucleotide following the stop codon, which is then detected
as a nucleotide shift of the toe-print signal (Alkalaeva et al., 2006; Egorova et al., 2019). It should be
noted that in each experiment we compared the relative amounts of cDNAs as areas of the preTC and
the TC peaks according to the following formula TC formation efficiency = TC / (TC + preTC), which is
presented on the histograms (Fig. 2).
Toe-print analysis showed that the addition of Nsp1 to the preTC does not induce any shift of the
preTC peak both in 0,5 and 2,5 µM concentration (Fig. S1A). However, addition of Nsp1 to the preTC with

the release factor eRF1 increases the amount of the formed TC by 1,6 times (Fig. 2A). As a negative
control, we also used eIF1A. To determine the stage of termination during which Nsp1 activates TC
formation, we tested the activity of the eRF1(AGQ) mutant, which is unable to induce hydrolysis of
peptidyl-tRNA. Efficiency of the TC formation in the presence of AGQ mutant reflects the efficiency of
eRF1 binding with the stop codon irrespective of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis. We observed that TC
formation performed by eRF1(AGQ) was similarly stimulated by Nsp1 (Fig. 2B).
Additionally, Nsp1 stimulates the formation of the TC in the presence of both release factors
(eRF1 and eRF3a) and GTP (Fig. 2C). Likewise, in the presence of the eRF1(AGQ)-eRF3a complex, we
observed significant stimulation of TC formation by Nsp1 (Fig. 2D). Thus, we concluded that Nsp1
stimulates translation termination before peptide release either during the binding of eRF1 with the stop
codon or during GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by eRF3a.
Nsp1 does not influence the GTPase activity of eRF3a
One of the stages of translation termination is the GTP hydrolysis performed by eRF3, which occurs after
the binding of eRF1-eRF3 complex to the stop codon inside the ribosome. This is followed by a
conformational change of the TC and positioning of eRF1 in the peptidyl-transferase center of the
ribosome (Cheng et al., 2009). By analyzing the GTPase activity of eRF3a in the presence of eRF1, 80S
ribosome, and Nsp1, we demonstrated no effect of Nsp1 on the hydrolysis of GTP (Fig. 3A). The GTPase
activity of eRF3a was determined at the concentrations of the components corresponding to the linear
part of the saturation curve (Fig. S1B). We confirmed this finding by analyzing the efficiency of TC
formation in the presence of a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, GDPCP, using toe-printing assay. The
addition of the GDPCP to eRF1 and eRF3a did not prevent stimulation of TC formation by Nsp1 similar to
that observed in the presence of GTP (Fig. 3B). Therefore, Nsp1 stimulation activity in translation
termination appears before and independently of GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by eRF3.
Additionally, we tested the ability of Nsp1 to stimulate peptide release induced by truncated from
the C-end form of eRF1, NM-eRF1, which is unable to interact with eRF3a. We observed even the higher
level of peptide release stimulation of NM-eRF1 by Nsp1 (Fig. 3C). This once again confirms our
conclusion that Nsp1 does not affect the GTPase activity of eRF3, and the stimulation of translation
termination by Nsp1 occurs on the stage of stop codon recognition.
Effects of mutations of Nsp1 on its activity in translation termination
To find critical regions of Nsp1 to perform its function during termination, we obtained five mutant forms of
Nsp1: K164A/H165A (KH/AA), Y154A/F157A (YF/AA), R171E/R175E (RR/EE), R124S/K125E (RK/SE),
and N128S/K129E (NK/SE), described previously as proteins that lack an activity in translation or
mutations that disrupt cell apoptosis (Fig. 4A) (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Yuan et al.,
2020). The mutant proteins KH/AA, YF/AA, and RR/EE were unable to suppress translation in the cellfree system (Fig. 4B), in agreement to the previous studies (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020).
Moreover, the mutants KH/AA and YF/AA slightly activated cell-free translation. However, the mutants
RK/SE, NK/SE decreased the translation of the Nluc in cell-free system similarly to the wild-type Nsp1
(Fig. 4B). On the other hand, the mutants KH/AA and YF/AA stimulated peptide release in the presence
of eRF1 alone and the eRF1-eRF3a complex similarly to Nsp1 (Fig. 4C). However, the mutants RR/EE,
RK/SE and NK/SE lost the ability to stimulate peptide release (Fig. 4C).
TC formation analysis of the same mutants showed that the proteins KH/AA and YF/AA
demonstrated the same activity as Nsp1 wt (Fig. S2). On the contrary, the mutants RR/EE, RK/SE and

NK/SE did not stimulate the formation of TC (Fig. S2). Therefore, TC formation analysis confirmed the
results obtained by the peptide release assay.
We believe that activation of the cell-free translation (Fig. 4B) and stimulation of peptide release
(Fig. 4C) by the two mutant proteins KH/AA and YF/AA reflect their positive effect on translation
termination in combination with the loss of the ability to inhibit initiation. On the other hand, the mutant
RR/EE was inactive in all performed tests, so we concluded that this mutation reduces the whole activity
of the protein, probably disrupting its structure. Indeed, the most part of expressed RR/EE precipitated
during isolation from the lysate and further purifications, which indicates a violation of its structure.
Summarizing the obtained results, we can conclude that different parts of Nsp1 are responsible
for different activities of this protein in translation. The analysis of mutant activities indicated that the C
domain of Nsp1 is involved in translation repression via binding with the 40S subunit, which was shown
by structural analysis (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020), but the N domain of
Nsp1 is responsible for the activation of translation termination.
We also tested 3xFLAG-tagged Nsp1 (3xFLAG-Nsp1) in peptide release and TC formation
analysis, as this form of Nsp1 has been used in different structural and biochemical studies (Schubert et
al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Interestingly, similar to untagged Nsp1 amount of
3xFLAG-Nsp1 did not suppress translation of Nluc mRNA in the cell-free system (Fig. S3A). However, in
the presence of either eRF1 alone, or the eRF1-eRF3a-GTP complex, 3xFLAG-Nsp1 stimulated TC
formation and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, like the wild-type Nsp1 (Fig. S3B,C). Thus, the 3xFLAG does not
interfere with the functioning of Nsp1 in translation termination but prevents suppression of protein
translation in the cell-free system. We did not find any information about influence of 3xFLAG-Nsp1 on
translation in cell-free systems. All published data describe translation activity of 3xFLAG-Nsp1 or its
mutants during overexpression in cell lines. Although 3xFLAG-Nsp1 partially suppress translation in cell
lines, overexpression of this protein in the cells could give inaccurate results due to the high amount of
low activity protein. As far as we have found nobody compared activities in translation of untagged Nsp1
and 3xFLAG-Nsp1. Probably an extremely high negative charge from 3xFLAG-tag (at pH 7,5 charge is 7.17) interferes with the interaction of this protein with the ribosomal RNA. It in turn can cause an
ineffective translational suppression and low amount of purified ribosomal complexes from cell lysates via
FLAG antibodies.
Individual N and C domains of Nsp1 are inactive in the initiation and termination of
translation
It would be interesting for further research to determine whether it is possible to work with
individual Nsp1 domains. Therefore, we decided to see if we can localize the activities in initiation and
termination in separate domains of Nsp1. We obtained the N domain that contained 1-138 amino acid
residues, and the C domain that contained 139-180 amino acid residues (Fig. 4A). Then we tested the
effect of the individual Nsp1 domains on the cell-free translation and peptide release. Unfortunately, both
domains lost their function in suppressing NLuc cell-free translation (Fig. 5A) and did not stimulate
hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA in the presence of eRF1 or the eRF1-eRF3a complex (Fig. 5B). Only the N
domain of Nsp1 slightly improved the peptide release in the presence of eRF1 with eRF3a (Fig. 5B).
Activities of the N and the C domains of Nsp1 were also checked by TC formation analysis. The
activities of the domains clearly follow the pattern of their activities in the peptide release. The C domain
of Nsp1 was unable to stimulate TC formation, and the N domain slightly stimulated TC formation in the

presence of eRF1 (Fig. S4). Thus, we have shown that the functioning of Nsp1, both in the translation
termination and cell-free translation, requires the presence of the full-length protein.
Nsp1 stimulates translation termination at all three stop codons
As we obtained results of stimulation of peptide release and TC formation by Nsp1 only at UAA stop
codon, we studied its activity at other codons. First, we determined the efficiency of TC formation on the
model mRNAs with UAA, UAG and UGA stop codons (Fig. 6). We revealed that in all three stop codons,
Nsp1 equally stimulated TC formation in the presence of eRF1(AGQ) (Fig. 6A) and the eRF1(AGQ)eRF3-GTP complex (Fig. 6B). Second, we tested whether in the presence of Nsp1 appears a capability of
eRF1 to recognize sense codons. We determined the efficiency of TC formation on the model mRNAs
with UGG and GCU codons (Fig. S5). We revealed that at the sense codons, Nsp1 was unable to induce
TC formation in the presence of the eRF1(AGQ)-eRF3-GTP complex. Therefore, Nsp1 is equally effective
in stimulating of translation termination on all three stop codons and does not work on the sense codons.
This confirms the specific effect of Nsp1 on translation termination.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we show that Nsp1 promotes translation termination which is compatible with the
finding that Nsp1 binds the 80S ribosome simultaneously with eRF1 and ABCE1 (Thoms et al., 2020). We
show the activity of Nsp1 at different stages of translation termination (Fig. 1–3, S1) and identify the
amino acid residues of Nsp1 important for its functioning in translation termination (Fig. 4, S2).
Additionally, we demonstrate that Nsp1 stimulates termination at all three stop codons (Fig. 6).
We show that Nsp1 stimulates of translation termination on the stage of stop codon recognition
because it functions independently of GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 3B) and presence of eRF3 in the reaction (Fig.
1B,2AB). Moreover, it does not stimulate GTPase activity of eRF3, which is stop codon independent (Fig.
3A). Besides analysis of mutant forms of Nsp1 demonstrates that it does not require binding to the mRNA
channel of the ribosome to perform its function in translation termination (Fig. 4C). Additionally, we
localize interacting regions of these proteins: NM domain of eRF1 and N domain of Nsp1 (Fig. 3C, 4C).
Summarizing obtained results, we propose the following molecular mechanism of Nsp1 activity during
translation termination – interacting with the NM domain of eRF1 via its N domain, Nsp1 promotes binding
of the release factor to the stop codon, which increases the overall efficiency of translation termination.
Nsp1 stimulates expression of host genes via increasing translation termination rate, but at the
same time, Nsp1 suppresses cell translation at the initiation stage via binding to the 40S ribosome
subunit to transfer components of protein biosynthesis into the translation of virus proteins (Banerjee et
al., 2020; Lapointe et al., 2020; Schubert et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020; Tidu et al.,
2020; Yuan et al., 2020). That’s why this work could not be done using cell-based experiments, since the
effect of Nsp1 on translation termination could not be detected on the background of suppression of
translation initiation by this protein. The only possibility to detect its influence on termination in the cells is
using two mutants KH/AA and YF/AA which are deficient in translational suppression. These mutants
indeed increase the level of the Nluc translation in RRL stimulating peptide release (Fig. 4B).
One can conclude that improving translation termination leads to better gene expression, unless
this increased translation termination takes place at sense codons. We tested this possibility and showed
that termination is stimulated by Nsp1 specifically at the stop codons (Fig. 6,S5). What are the
advantages for the virus to stimulate translation termination? Ribosomes that are in this step will
terminate translation and dissociate even without Nsp1, however stimulation of Nsp1 intensifies this
process and accelerates cell switching to viral translation. Additionally, Nsp1 probably binds to the mRNA
channel at the termination stage to prevent de novo protein synthesis of cellular mRNAs. By stimulating
termination in translating mRNA, it can bind to the 40S ribosome subunits and can prevent host initiation
of translation. Furthermore, it should be noted that the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA contains two long ORFs for
the translation of 16 proteins. They contain only two stop codons, so the elimination of the 40S subunits
by Nsp1 after translation termination preferentially involves ribosomes that translate host mRNAs and do
not affect the translation of the viral proteins encoded in the first two ORFs. It's clear that the entire
process of translation cannot be stopped by only suppressing initiation because those mRNAs that have
already passed the initiation stage continue to be translated at the stages of elongation and termination.
To disrupt the translation of such mRNAs, it would be reasonable to stimulate termination at the stop
codons and remove the 40S ribosome subunits from the pool of active components. We assume that
Nsp1 is involved in this process.

resulting proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) after induction by 0.5
mM isopropyl

β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside

at 18°C overnight, followed by purification using a Ni-NTA

gravity flow column and elution by 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 7,5% glycerol, 300 mM imidazole,
and 1 mM DTT. Obtained proteins were dialysed against cleavage buffer (CB), comprising 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 250 mM KCl, 7,5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT. Then peptide bond hydrolysis was carried out with 6xHistagged peptidase Ulp1 in CB. Hydrolysis was carried out during the night at +4 º. Then mix was incubated
with Ni-NTA agarose, equilibrated in CB, and purified using gravity flow column. The product was dialysed
in storage buffer (SB): 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, frizzed in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -70º. The composition of CB for Nsp1

С domain (~4,8 kDa) was identical with SB

and the dialysis was not carried out.

A peptide release with Nanoluciferase (NLuc) was performed as previously described (Susorov et al.,
2020) with modifications. The assay allows measurement of the NLuc release from TCs assembled on
NLuc mRNA in RRL. NLuc folds into the catalytically active form only after its release from the ribosome,
which leads to luminescence in the presence of substrate. The NanoLuc mRNA was in vitro transcribed (T7
RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System, Promega, USA) from a template containing βglobin 5'-UTR, NLuc CDS, 3'-UTR derived from pNL1.1[Nluc] vector (Promega), and 50 nt poly(A) tail. 1 ml
of RRL lysate (Green Hectares, USA) was preincubated in a mixture containing 1.5 u/µl Micrococcal
nuclease (Fermentas) and 1 mM CaCl2 at 30°C for 10 min, followed by the addition of EGTA to a final
concentration of 2 mM. A reaction mixture containing 70% nuclease-treated RRL was supplemented with
20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 80 mM KOAc, 0.5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.36 mM ATP, 0.2 GTP, 0.05 mM each of
20 amino acids (Promega), 0.5 mM spermidine, 5 ng/µl total rabbit tRNAs, 10 mM creatine phosphate,
0.003 u/µl creatine kinase (Sigma), 2 mM DTT and 0.2 U/µl Ribolock (ThermoFisher) in a volume of 1 ml.
The mixture was preincubated with 1 μM eRF1(AGQ) at 30°C for 10 min, followed by the addition of the
NLuc mRNA to a final concentration of 8 µg/ml, resulting in the formation of TCs. Next, KOAc concentration
was adjusted to 300 mM and the mixture was layered on 10–35% linear sucrose gradient in buffer
containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 300 mM KOAc, 2 mM DTT. The gradients were
centrifuged in a SW-41 Ti (Beckman Coulter) rotor at 18000 rpm for 14 h. Fractions enriched with preTCs
were collected. PreTC was aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Peptide release
was performed in solution containing 8 nM preTC, 50 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 mM spermidine, 2 mM
DTT, 0.2 mM GTP, and 1% NLuc substrate (Nano-Glo, Promega) in the presence of release factors (4 nM
eRF1 alone or with 4 nM eRF3a) and 80µM Nsp1 protein or its mutants/domains or eIF1A as negative
control. Luminescence was measured for 1 hour at 30°C using a Tecan Infinite 200Pro (Tecan, Männedorf,
Switzerland). The peptide release kinetic curves or histogram with maximum values were generated and
the standard deviation was calculated in Microsoft Excel.
Pre-termination complex assembly
The 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits as well as eukaryotic translation factors eIF2, eIF3, eEF1H, and eEF2
were purified from RRL or HeLa lysate, as previously described (Alkalaeva et al., 2006). The human
translation factors eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B, ∆eIF4G, ∆eIF5B, eIF5, PABP, and eRF1 were produced as
recombinant proteins in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) with subsequent protein purification on Ni-NTA agarose
and ion-exchange chromatography (Alkalaeva et al., 2006). The full-length human eRF3a was expressed in
insect Sf21 cells and purified via affinity chromatography using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare)
followed by anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) (Ivanov et al., 2016).
mRNAs were transcribed in vitro (T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System, Promega,
USA) from the linear fragment of the pET28-MVHL-UAA plasmid containing the T7 promoter, four CAA
repeats, β-globin 5’-UTR, and ORF (coding for the peptide MVHL), followed by the stop codon UAA and 3’UTR, comprising the remaining natural

β-globin

coding sequence. Eukaryotic preTCs on MVHL-UAA

mRNA were assembled and purified as previously described (Alkalaeva et al., 2006; Egorova et al., 2019;
Mikhailova et al., 2017). Briefly, ribosomal complexes were assembled in a 500 μL solution containing 37
pmol of mRNA. They were incubated for 15 min in buffer A (20 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 100 mM KAc, 2.5
mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT) supplemented with 400 U RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#
EO0384), 1 mM ATP, 0.25 mM spermidine, 0.2 mM GTP, 75 μg calf liver total tRNA (acylated with all or

individual amino acids; Sigma, cat# R7250), 75 pmol human 40S and 60S purified ribosomal subunits, 200
pmol eIF2, 60 pmol eIF3, 400 pmol eIF4A, 150 pmol eIF4B, and 125 pmol each of human eIF2,
eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5, and

ΔeIF4G,

ΔeIF5B for the formation of the 80S initiation complex. After 15 min, 200 pmol of

human eEF1H and 38 pmol of eEF2 were added to form the elongation complex. The ribosomal complexes
were then purified via centrifugation in a Beckman SW55 rotor for 95 min at 4 °C and 48,000 rpm in a 10–
30% (w/w) linear sucrose density gradient (SDG) prepared in buffer A with 5 mM MgCl2. Fractions
corresponding to the ribosomal complexes were diluted three-fold with buffer A containing 1.25 mM MgCl2
(to a final concentration of 2.5 mM Mg2+) and used in experiments.
Termination complex (TC) formation efficiency assay
First, 0.03 pmol preTCs incubated with release factors (0.5 pmol eRF1/eRF1(AGQ) alone or 0.1 pmol
eRF1/eRF1(AGQ) with 0.1 pmol eRF3a) and optionally with 2.5 pmol Nsp1 or its mutants/domains or
eIF1A as negative control at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 0.2 mM GTP or GDPCP, supplemented
with equimolar amounts of MgCl2. Samples were analysed using the primer extension protocol. The toeprinting analysis was performed with AMV reverse transcriptase and 5’-carboxyfluorescein-labelled primers
complementary to 3’-UTR sequences, as described previously (Egorova et al., 2019). cDNAs were
separated via electrophoresis using standard GeneScan® conditions on an ABI Prism® Genetic Analyser
3100 (Applera).
GTPase assay
Ribosomal 40S and 60S subunits (5 pmol each) with 5 pmol of eRF1 were associated at 37 °C for 10 min.
Then, other components were added. Final reaction volume was 10 μL and contained 23.5 mМ Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 35 mM NH4Cl, 18 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM GTP, 3 pmol of eRF3a and 0, 3, 5, 10 or 15 pmol of Nsp1.
After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C the amount of released phosphate was estimated with Malachite
Green Phosphate Assay (Sigma), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Quantification and statistical analysis
All experiments were carried out in at least 3 replicates (the specific number of replicates is shown in the
description under figures). The data is presented as mean±standard deviation (SD), when analyzing
luminescence signals of lysates, or mean±standard error of mean (SE), when analyzing parameters
(translation). A two-tailed t-test was used to compare mean values between two groups. For multiple
comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used. One-way ANOVA was used to compare mean values
between more than two groups. P-values were calculated in Microsoft Excel. The difference was
considered significant when p was less than 0.05 (Glantz, 2011).
