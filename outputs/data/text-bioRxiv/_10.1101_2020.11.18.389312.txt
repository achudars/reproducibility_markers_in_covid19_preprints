ABSTRACT: Mutation-driven evolution of SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)

28

highlights the need for innovative approaches that simultaneously suppress viral

29

replication and circumvent viral escape routes from host immunity and antiviral

30

therapeutics. Here, we employed genome-wide computational prediction and single-

31

nucleotide resolution screening to reprogram CRISPR-Cas13b against SARS-CoV-2

32

genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Reprogrammed Cas13b effectors targeting

33

accessible regions of Spike and Nucleocapsid transcripts achieved >98% silencing

34

efficiency in virus free-models. Further, optimized and multiplexed gRNAs suppressed

35

viral replication by up to 90% in mammalian cells infected with replication-competent

36

SARS-CoV-2. Unexpectedly, the comprehensive mutagenesis of guide-target

37

interaction demonstrated that single-nucleotide mismatches do not impair the capacity

38

of a potent single gRNA to simultaneously suppress ancestral and mutated SARS-

39

CoV-2 in infected mammalian cells, including the highly infectious and globally

40

disseminated Spike D614G mutant. The specificity, efficiency and rapid deployment

41

properties of reprogrammed Cas13b described here provide a molecular blueprint of

42

antiviral therapeutics to simultaneously suppress a wide range of SARS-CoV-2

43

mutants, and is readily adaptable to other emerging pathogenic viruses.

INTRODUCTION

50

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of

51

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused >52 million infections and over 1.3

52

million deaths worldwide as of November 20201. A wide range of preventive and

53

therapeutic strategies are the subject of intensive investigation and include vaccines2,

54

engineered monoclonal antibodies3,4, and small molecule antiviral agents5,6. However,

55

the capacity of viruses to evolve in response to host, environmental and therapeutic

56

pressures presents challenges to these conventional approaches.

57

While SARS-CoV-2 possesses a moderate mutational rate due to the proof-

58

reading activity of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), there are nonetheless

59

reports of emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains that have evolved increased fitness and

60

pathogenicity7,8. The SARS-CoV-2 D614G (Asp614Gly) variant, resulting from a single

61

nucleotide substitution (A to G) in the receptor binding domain of the Spike

62

glycoprotein, has demonstrated increased affinity for the ACE2 receptor and

63

enhanced replication capacity in vitro, potentially contributing to the global spread of

64

this variant8–10. Likewise, analysis of virus phylogenetics globally enabled by the

65

GISAID11 and Nextstrain12 databases revealed recurrent hotspot mutations in several

66

viral subunits that are considered likely to confer selective advantage and/or alter

67

pathogenicity13,14. Also, there are concerns regarding uncontrolled spread and

68

evolution of the virus in farm animals such as minks that could eventually lead to

69

problematic mutations15. These findings emphasize the need for an innovative antiviral

70

approach that can counteract dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and

71

thwart viral escape.

76

be established whether Cas13 is capable of silencing replication-competent SARS-

RESULTS

80

In-silico prediction and design of a genome-wide SARS-CoV-2 gRNA library. We

81

hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and its subgenomic transcripts can

82

be silenced with CRISPR-Cas13 in mammalian cells. We opted to use pspCas13b22

83

due to its long (30-nt) spacer sequence that is anticipated to confer greater specificity

84

than Cas13 orthologs with shorter target sequences. We used the first publicly

85

available genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 as the reference genome23 to design

86

pspCas13 gRNAs, and developed a bioinformatics pipeline for in silico design of

87

29,894 pspCas13 tiled gRNAs covering the entire genome, from 5’ to 3’ end (Suppl.

88

Figure 1 & Suppl. Table 1). We further refined the list of gRNAs by excluding (i)

89

spacer sequences with poly-T repeats (4 or more successive T’s) that prematurely

90

terminate the Pol III-driven transcription of gRNAs (Suppl. Table 2), and (ii) spacers

91

or target sequences with predicted thermodynamically stable RNA-RNA duplexes that

92

should hinder gRNA loading into pspCas13b and target accessibility. We selected 839

93

spacer sequences that best satisfied the selection criteria (Suppl. Table 3). As all 839

94

30-nt spacer sequences fully base-pair with the reference SARS-CoV-2 RNA, all are

95

predicted to achieve high targeting efficiency. This database represents a valuable

96

investigative tool to interrogate SARS-CoV-2.

97

PspCas13b suppresses the Spike transcript with high efficiency and specificity.

. Previous reports have demonstrated the potential of certain Cas13 orthologs to

98

In a proof-of concept assay, we used the bioinformatics pipeline described above to

99

select gRNAs targeting the transcript of the Spike glycoprotein, which facilitates viral

100

invasion of host cells following binding to the ACE2 surface receptor3,24 A codon-

101

optimized Spike DNA template was cloned in frame with an upstream P2A self-

102

cleavage peptide and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), enabling co-

103

transcription and translation of Spike and eGFP, which are separated post-

104

translationally by P2A proteolytic self-cleavage. In this reporter assay, pspCas13b-

105

mediated cleavage of the Spike mRNA was predicted to lead to a loss of eGFP

106

fluorescence (Figure 1A). We co-transfected 293 HEK cells with the Spike-eGFP

107

reporter plasmid together with pspCas13 linked to a blue fluorescent protein (BFP)

108

and gRNAs targeting either the Spike transcript (4 gRNAs) or non-targeting (NT) gRNA

109

as a control. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that high silencing efficiency was

110

achieved with all Spike-targeting gRNAs compared to the NT control (Figure 1B &

111

1C). We achieved similar silencing in VERO cells, a kidney epithelial cell line derived

112

from an African green monkey, commonly used in SARS-CoV-2 research due to its

113

high susceptibility to infection25 (Figure 1B & 1C). gRNA2 achieved the highest

114

silencing efficiency amongst the 4 gRNAs we tested, reaching >99% and >90%

115

reduction in spike transcript levels in 293 HEK and VERO cells, respectively. To

116

demonstrate that the observed silencing was dependent on the cellular expression of

117

gRNA, we transfected 293 HEK cells with increasing amounts of either NT or Spike-

118

targeting gRNA2 plasmids ranging from 0 to 104 pM (0, 0.16, 0.8, 4, and 20ng plasmid

119

in 100 µL volume). While NT gRNA exhibited no effect on eGFP expression, the Spike-

120

targeting gRNA2 showed dose-dependent silencing of the Spike transcript with 50%

121

silencing efficiency (IC50) achieved with 5.16 pM of plasmid gRNA (equivalent to

122

994pg in 100 µL of media), demonstrating that gRNA availability in the cell is key for

123

efficient degradation of viral RNA (Figure 1D & 1E). This very low IC50 value also

124

highlights the need for intracellular delivery of just a few copies of gRNA template

125

plasmid to achieve effective silencing, thanks to intracellular gRNA amplification by

126

the transcription machinery.

127

Like all RNA-guided nucleases, pspCas13b specificity is conferred by base-

128

pairing between the target and gRNA spacer sequences26–28. Evaluating the tolerance

129

for mismatches in this interaction is therefore critical to determining both the potential

130

off-target activity of pspCas13b (ie, silencing cellular transcripts), and more

131

importantly, the loss of activity against variant sequences generated by the RdRP

132

during viral replication29,30. Given that pspCas13b specificity is still poorly understood,

133

we opted to determine the degree of variation in base-pairing between target RNA and

134

the spacer of gRNA2 that could be tolerated and still lead to RNA degradation. We

135

designed and cloned 9 constructs that encoded successive 3-, 6-, or 9-nt substitutions

136

across the whole gRNA2 spacer sequence (Figure 1F). The nucleotide substitutions

137

created mismatches (MSM) that perturbed the thermodynamic stability of the RNA-

138

RNA duplex. While a 3-nt mismatches placed internally (position 14-16) or at the 3’end

139

(position 28-30) had minimal impact, 3-nt mismatches at the 5’end reduced the

140

silencing efficacy by ~50%. By comparison, 6-nt mismatches introduced at various

141

locations markedly and consistently reduced silencing, and 9-nt mismatches

142

completely abolished the degradation of the Spike transcript (Figure 1F). Taken

143

together, this experiment indicated that gRNA2 requires >21-nt base-pairing with its

144

target to trigger the necessary CRISPR-Cas conformational change and nuclease

145

activation necessary for target degradation26–28. Conversely, the ability of pspCas13b

146

to tolerate up to 3-nt mismatches underlines its potential to remain effective against

147

the majority of variants with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the target sequence,

148

conferring protection against potential viral escape mutants such as the D614G

149

mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein8, and mutations that compromise the

150

efficacy of therapeutic antibodies against SARS-CoV27.

151

Next, we questioned whether the RNA target sequence and structure may

152

influence pspCas13b silencing efficiency. To comprehensively evaluate this

153

possibility, we generated 61 single-nucleotide-tiled gRNAs covering the 5’ and 3’

154

overhangs of the gRNA2 target sequence (Figure 1G). This approach generated

155

single-nucleotide resolution of the RNA landscape that influences pspCas13b

156

silencing. Overall, 95% of gRNAs achieved >50% degradation efficiency, and 70% of

157

gRNAs achieved >75% degradation of the Spike transcript. Notably, the least effective

158

gRNAs were spatially clustered, suggesting that the RNA secondary structure and/or

159

the presence of endogenous RNA binding proteins might limit spatial RNA

160

accessibility. The tiling approach employed results in continuous changes in spacer

161

flanking sequences (PFS). Accordingly, our findings revealed that unlike other

162

CRISPR subtypes, pspCas13b activity appears to be independent of defined PFS or

163

PAM-like (protospacer adjacent motif) motifs that constrain the targeting spectrum of

164

other CRISPR effectors31. These data highlight the high likelihood of efficient silencing

165

with various pspCas13b gRNAs and emphasize the flexibility of this RNA silencing tool

166

for SARS-CoV-2 suppression.

167

Silencing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid transcript. We next examined whether other

168

SARS-CoV-2 structural components essential for viral assembly can be silenced by

169

pspCas13b. We chose to target the RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein (NCP)

170

that is critical for viral particle assembly by packaging the RNA genome within the viral

171

envelope32,33. Based on the reference genome sequence23 we designed and cloned

172

the original sequence of the NCP into a reporter vector in frame with a monomeric red

173

fluorescent protein (mcherry) (Figure 2A). We co-transfected 293 HEK and VERO

174

cells with the NCP-mcherry reporter plasmid together with pspCas13-BFP and a NT

175

gRNA or three different gRNAs targeting various regions of the NCP transcript.

176

Based on mcherry fluorescence intensity, we achieved high silencing efficiency

177

in both cell lines, with all three NCP-targeting gRNAs (Figure 2B & 2C). Of these,

178

gRNA1 exhibited the highest silencing efficiency, achieving >99% and >90% reduction

179

in fluorescence in 293 HEK and VERO cells, respectively. In line with the microscopy

180

data, western blot confirmed that the three NCP-targeting gRNAs efficiently depleted

181

NCP protein, with gRNA1 again the most effective (Figure 2D). As with Spike-

182

targeting gRNAs, titration of the NCP-targeting gRNA1 plasmid (0, 0.83, 4.15, and

183

20.75 pM, equivalent to 0, 0.16, 0.8, 4, and 20ng per 100 µL of media) into 293 HEK

184

cells demonstrated dose-dependent silencing of the target, whereas NT gRNA had no

185

effect (Figure 2E). The dose-dependent effect of NCP-targeting gRNA1 revealed 50%

186

inhibition of the target (IC50) with 0.725 pM of plasmid gRNA (140 pg in 100 µL of

187

media in 96-well format; R2=0.906) (Figure 2F), whereas the IC50 of Spike-targeting

188

gRNA2 was 5.16 pM (R2=0.86) (Figure 1E). The variation in silencing efficiency (7-

189

fold) observed with these two potent spacer sequences again highlighted that affinity

190

and target accessibility need to be considered when selecting the optimal gRNA for

191

maximal target silencing.

192

Next, we examined the extent to which mismatches in the spacer-target RNA-

193

RNA hybrid of the highly efficient NCP-targeting gRNA1 would compromise its

194

silencing potency. We designed 29 additional gRNA constructs that incorporated

195

mismatches at the 5’ end, 3’ end, or at internal positions (blue residues, Figure 2G-I).

196

Mismatch length varied from 3 to 30 nucleotides to cover the entire spacer sequence.

197

At the 5’end, mismatches at positions 1-3 or 1-6 were well-tolerated and caused minor

198

reductions in silencing efficiency in 293 HEK cells transfected with 20ng of gRNAs,

199

while altering positions 1-9 reduced silencing by ~30%. However, by titrating the

200

quantity of gRNA delivered, we revealed noticeable loss of silencing efficiency when

201

1-3, 1-6 or 1-9 mismatches were introduced (suppl. Figure 2). Mismatches longer

202

than 9-nt at the 5’end completely abrogated silencing. Similarly, 3-nt mismatches

203

placed internally (positions 14-16) or at the 3’ end were well tolerated, while 6-nt

204

mismatches reduced silencing by ~30%. Introducing >6-nt mismatches at both internal

205

and 3’ end positions caused complete loss of silencing (Figure 2H & 2I).

206

pspCas13b silencing tolerates a single-nucleotide mismatch with the target.

207

Viral evolution takes place predominantly through single-nucleotide indels brought

208

about by error-prone polymerases. We investigated whether pspCas13b can tolerate

209

a single-nucleotide mismatch between the spacer and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA target,

210

potentially enabling our silencing technology to remain effective against spontaneous

211

mutations. We re-designed the gRNAs targeting either the Spike (gRNA2) or the

212

nucleocapsid (gRNA1) transcripts to harbour a single-nucleotide mismatch at spacer

213

positions 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 and compared their silencing efficiency to their

214

fully-matched wildtype counterparts. Overall, we found that a single-nucleotide

215

mismatch at various locations of the spacer was well tolerated, with no appreciable

216

impact on target silencing (Figure 3A & 3B). Among all the constructs we tested, only

217

a single nucleotide mismatch in the first nucleotide of the spacer sequence of gRNA1

218

targeting Nucleocapsid exhibited a moderate loss of silencing (Figure 3B). In line with

219

the fluorescence data, western blot analysis of Nucleocapsid protein expression

220

confirmed that single-nucleotide mismatch at position 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 are

221

well tolerated and retain full silencing efficiency, while a mismatch at position 1 led to

222

a partial loss of silencing (Figure 3C). These data highlight the potential of a single

223

pspCas13b gRNA to silence SARS-CoV-2 variants and overcome mutation-driven

224

viral escape.

225

PspCas13b reduces live SARS-CoV-2 virus replication. A recent study attempted

226

to target a SARS-CoV-2 RNA construct with a Cas13d ortholog but the silencing of

227

live replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 was not examined21. Rather, a genetically

228

engineered H1N1 influenza strain expressing a fluorescent reporter was used. To

229

determine whether our reprogrammed pspCas13b could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA

230

replication, we transfected VERO cells with pspCas13b-BFP and either NT gRNA or

231

the gRNA1 that most efficiency reduced Nucleocapsid RNA levels in virus-free models

232

(Figure 2). We optimised transfection conditions of VERO cells to achieve 25-40%

233

transfection efficiency as measured by flow cytometry analysis (Suppl. Figure 3). 48h

234

post-transfection, we infected the cells with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 at a

235

Multiplicity Of Infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 0.1, and assayed the culture medium at 1hr,

236

24hrs, and 48hrs time-points using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for viral RNA25. We also

237

determined the titre of infectious SARS-CoV-2 by exposing fresh VERO cells to the

238

supernatant and quantifying the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) by light microscopy and

239

manual counting to determine the tissue culture infectious dose that inhibits 50% of

240

virus growth (TCID50) (Figure 4A). In cells transfected with NT gRNA and infected at

241

0.1 MOI, viral RNA in the supernatant increased ~15-fold at 24h compared to baseline

242

and this level was maintained at 48hrs. By contrast, in the presence of NCP-targeting

243

gRNA1 there was a marked reduction in viral RNA detected (Figure 4B). RT-PCR

244

analysis showed that gRNA1 reduced the viral load by ~90% 24h post-infection

245

compared to the NT gRNA. However, NCP-targeting gRNA1 did not completely

246

abrogate viral replication in this biological replicate, as the viral titre still increased 3-

247

fold between 24 and 48hrs (Figure 4B). This partial inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

248

replication by pspCas13b is likely explained by a combination of a high viral load (0.1

249

MOI) that saturates intracellular pspCas13b nucleoproteins, and the limited

250

transfection efficiency in VERO cells (25-40%) (Suppl. Figure 3). Subsequently, viral

251

replication may take place in untransfected cells or cells expressing low levels of

252

pspCas13b and gRNA. Increasing the efficiency of delivery of pspCas13b and its

253

gRNA should result in even greater viral suppression.

254

In fact, when we infected VERO cells with one order of magnitude lower viral

255

titre (0.01 MOI), viral RNA in the supernatant of cells expressing NT gRNA increased

256

by ~14-fold 48hrs post-infection. By contrast, viral RNAs in the culture medium of cells

257

expressing NCP-1 gRNA remained at the basal level (Figure 4B), demonstrating that

258

pspCas13b and NCP-targeting gRNA1 efficiently suppressed viral replication in

259

infected mammalian cells. In line with RT-PCR, the infectivity assay confirmed that the

260

NCP-targeting gRNA1 greatly reduced the release of infectious virus (measured as

261

TCID50 / mL) in the supernatant (Figure 4C).

262

The emergence of new viral strains of SARS-CoV-2, potentially with enhanced

263

fitness, poses a formidable challenge to any single antiviral or antibody therapy7.

264

Likewise, targeting SARS-CoV-2 with a single gRNA may have limited efficacy due to

265

viral adaptation and/or poor accessibility to viral RNA in vivo due to intrinsic RNA

266

folding and/or interference from RNA-binding proteins. We postulated that

267

simultaneously targeting several regions of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs with multiplexed

268

gRNAs would mitigate these effects, and reduce the likelihood of viral adaptation. We

269

transfected VERO cells with four pools of gRNAs each containing four different guides

270

targeting either SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins Spike and NCP, or non-structural

271

protein NSP7 and NSP8 that act as co-factors critical for the RdRP6,29,30. We again

272

infected the VERO cells with SARS-CoV-2, and quantified viral RNA and infectious

273

virus in the culture supernatant. We found that all four gRNAs pools markedly reduced

274

viral RNA (Figure 4D), and infectious virus (Figure 4E,) in the supernatant at both 0.1

275

and 0.01 MOI.

276

Likewise, when we challenged VERO cells with 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SARS-

277

CoV-2 virus 72h post-transfection of pspCas13b and various gRNAs, we achieved

278

~80% and ~90% suppression of viral loads with all tested gRNAs, respectively (Figure

279

4F & Suppl. Figure 4). These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral suppression

280

from a single pspCas13b transfection can persist beyond 5 days post-transfection,

281

and 3 days post-infection.

282

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that definitively demonstrates

283

the effective and specific targeting of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in infected

284

mammalian cells, using CRISPR-Cas13.

285

pspCas13b suppresses mutation-driven SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

286

A single nucleotide substitution in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike

287

protein led to the global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant with increased

288

ACE-2 affinity and infective potential8,9. Based on the single-nucleotide mismatch data

289

described above (Figure 3A &3B), we hypothesized that gRNAs designed against

290

ancestral Spike D614 genomic sequence should remain effective against the D614G

291

mutant RNAs despite a single-nucleotide mismatch at the spacer-target interface. To

292

test this, we cloned part of the D614G Spike coding sequence (1221 bp; D614G

293

SARS-CoV-2 genomic region between 22,760—23,980) into the mcherry reporter

294

system, and assessed the silencing efficiency of 6 tiled gRNAs targeting this frequently

295

mutated hotspot. The spacer sequences of all 6 tiled gRNAs tested are designed to

296

fully match the ancestral Spike sequence (D614) and harbour one nucleotide

297

mismatch with the Spike transcript of D614G mutant at spacer positions 5, 10, 15, 20,

298

25, and 30 (Figure 5A). The data showed that all 6 gRNAs significantly degraded the

299

D614G mutant transcript (P<0.0001). Interestingly, gRNAs with a single-nucleotide

300

mismatch at spacer position 15, 20, 25, or 30 were highly effective and exhibited >98%

301

silencing efficiency against the D614G mutant transcript. By contrast, gRNAs with a

302

mismatch at position 5 or 10 showed a reduced silencing efficiency estimated at

303

approximatively 85-88% removal of the D614G mutant transcript (Figure 5A). These

304

data suggest that pspCas13 and the D614G targeting gRNAs with a single-nucleotide

305

mismatch at positions 15, 20, 25, and 30 are likely to remain effective against both

306

ancestral and D614G mutant in infected cells. Thus, the mismatch tolerance molecular

307

mechanism described here is expected to confer pspCas13d resilience against

308

spontaneous single-nucleotide mutations that drive viral escape in SARS-CoV-2 and

309

other pathogenic viruses.

310

To test the mismatch tolerance of our Cas13b system against various

311

replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viral strains, we transfected VERO cells with NT

312

gRNA, NCP-1 targeting gRNA (positive control), or 4 tiled gRNAs (10, 15, 20, 30) fully

313

matching the ancestral Spike sequence D614 (see the schematic illustration in Figure

314

5A & 5B). 48 hours post-infection, VERO cells expressing pspCas13-BFP and various

315

gRNAs were infected with either the ancestral or D614G mutant SARS-CoV-2, and

316

the viral loads in supernatants were quantified by RT-PCR 1h (initial viral input), 24h

317

and 48h post-infection (Figure 5B). The comparison of viral loads in the supernatant

318

of cells infected with either the ancestral or D614G in the control groups (NT) showed

319

7.7, 4.2, and 2.3-fold higher viral loads in the D614G samples at timepoints 1h, 24h,

320

and 48h, respectively (Figure 5C, 5E & 5G). These data revealed that the initial

321

D614G viral load used here was more than 7 times higher than the ancestral strain.

13

322

As anticipated, all SARS-CoV-2 targeting gRNAs tested showed no significant

323

viral suppression against the ancestral nor the D614G strains 1-hour post-infection.

324

The absence of viral suppression with targeting gRNAs at this early timepoint of

325

infection was anticipated because pspCas13b-mediated viral suppression requires

326

intracellular viral replication that had not yet occurred.

327

In the positive control groups, NCP-1 gRNA is used to target a fully matching

328

sequence within the Nucleocapsid RNA that is conserved in both ancestral and D614G

329

strains. Consistent with the data in Figure 2 and Figure 4, NCP-1 gRNA again showed

330

a very high silencing efficiency, and suppressed 84-88% and 73-74% of replication-

331

competent ancestral and D614G viruses, respectively, at both 24 and 48h timepoints

332

(Figure 5F & 5H). The moderate loss of viral suppression in cells infected with the

333

D614G mutant is likely due to the 7-fold higher initial viral load (Figure 5C, 5E & 5G).

334

Among the 4 tiled gRNAs targeting the ancestral D614 position in Spike’s RNA, 3 of

335

them (15, 20, and 30) showed efficient viral suppression reaching 78-84% and

336

44-60% in cells infected with the ancestral and D614G strains respectively, at both 24

337

and 48h timepoints (Figure 5F & 5H). Again, the moderate reduction in D614G

338

suppression with these 3 gRNAs is likely attributable to the initial higher viral load of

339

this D614G strain. Last, the fourth gRNA we tested (harbouring a mismatch with the

340

D614G mutation at spacer position 10) showed the lowest affinity and viral

341

suppression potential with 62-71% suppression of the ancestral strain, and only 3-7%

342

suppression of the D614G, which was not statistically significant at 24 nor at 48h

343

(Figure 5F & 5H). This result is congruent with the data obtained from virus-free model

344

(Figure 5A), where the gRNA harbouring a single-nucleotide mismatch with D614G

345

at spacer position 10 exhibited the lowest silencing efficiency among the 4 gRNAs

346

tested. This correlation highlights the predictive power of the virus-free model we

347

developed, and emphasises its utility to tractably screen and select the best

348

performing gRNAs. Overall, the data in Figure 5 provide strong evidence that

349

optimized single gRNAs are likely to retain efficacy against spontaneous point-

350

mutations that arise during viral replication and can efficiently silence ancestral and

351

emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants, including the D614G.

352

DISCUSSION

353

The remarkable capability of RNA viruses to adapt to selective host and environmental

354

pressure is highly dependent on their ability to generate genomic diversity through the

355

occurrence of de novo mutations34. Mutation-driven viral evolution can generate drug

356

resistance, immune escape, and potentially increased efficiency of transmission and

357

pathogenicity, all of which are detrimental to the host. Although our understanding of

358

SARS-CoV-2 mutation-driven escape mechanisms remains limited, several reports

359

have demonstrated the emergence of new strains, which possess increased infective

360

potential8 or are resistant to monoclonal antibody therapy7. In this study, we leveraged

361

a novel technology and employed two key strategies to silence SARS-CoV-2 RNA and

362

counteract its intrinsic ability to escape standard therapies through the generation of

363

de novo mutations.

364

Firstly, the gRNA multiplexing approach to target various regions of viral RNA

365

simultaneously mitigates the risk of target inaccessibility35 and potential viral escape

366

through genomic rearrangement or polymorphisms7,8,14,36 (Figure 4, Suppl. Figure 4

367

& Figure 5). Given the moderate mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, it is extremely unlikely

368

that the virus would accumulate simultaneous mutations in various regions to escape

369

a cocktail of 4 gRNAs without compromising its fitness. This multiplexed targeting is

370

comparable to other combination therapeutic strategies that have proven to be

371

effective against other viruses including HIV37. Compared to inhibitors of protein

372

function that typically require years of modelling, design, and screening, the advantage

373

of viral RNA targeting with pspCas13b lies in its design-flexibility, predictive efficacy

374

and specificity, and the short time needed to generate the relevant gRNAs. The

375

specificity, high silencing efficiency, and rapid deployment properties of pspCas13b

376

that we have demonstrated are indicative of the translational potential of this

377

technology to reshape the battle against SARS-CoV-2 and provide a means of

378

evolving therapy in concert with viral genomic changes. Likewise, other Cas13

379

orthologs may also offer similar properties3,16,19,28,38,39.

380

Secondly, our comprehensive mutagenesis analysis revealed that the

381

positively-charged central channel of pspCas13b can tolerate single-nucleotide

382

mismatches within the RNA-RNA hybrid created by spacer-target base-pairing26,27

383

(Figure 1, 2 & 3). We demonstrated that a single gRNA can simultaneously silence

384

parental and emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains (Figure 5). The mismatch tolerance

385

mechanism shown here revealed that a single gRNA will likely remain effective against

386

future viral mutants that acquire de novo single-nucleotide indels as a result of genome

387

replication by the error-prone RdRP of SARS-CoV-2.

388

Given the high degree of tolerance to single-nucleotide mismatch and the use

389

of gRNA multiplexing, we postulate that a reprogrammed pspCas13b can act as a

390

universal tool to silence various SARS-CoV-2 strains that would escape conventional

391

antiviral therapeutics, including single monoclonal antibodies7 or small inhibitor

392

molecules. A key step in enabling clinical translation of this approach will be to develop

393

a safe and effective delivery strategy such as lipid nanoparticle formulations for

394

systemic, and possibly, mucosal delivery40. Importantly, a CRISPR-Cas13 based

395

approach is also readily adaptable and expandable to other pathogenic viruses

multiplexing and single-nucleotide mismatch tolerance. (A) gRNA multiplexing

enables simultaneous targeting of several genomic and sub-genomic RNA locations,

which limits the probability of poor silencing due to target inaccessibility (e.g. RNA

folding, interaction with RNA-binding proteins in vivo). The spacer of pspCas13b

mediates sequence-specific target recognition through complete base-pairing with the

targeted sequence, followed by nuclease activation and target degradation. The

silencing of viral RNAs alters the integrity of the viral genome, suppresses sub-

genomic RNA-dependent viral protein translation, and the assembly of replication-

approach aborts viral replication cycles and inhibits the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2

virus. (B) The error-prone RdRP creates viral polymorphisms through the

incorporation of single-nucleotide indels, and together with host (immune system) and

new strains with higher infectivity and pathogenicity. Unlike other antiviral therapeutics

529

(e.g. monoclonal antibodies7), pspCas13b target affinity remains unaffected when a

530

single-nucleotide indel occurs at the target site, enabling a single gRNA to be effective

531

against wild type and mutant strains. Thus, the pspCas13b approach can suppress

viral evolution.

METHODS

534

Design and cloning of pspCas13b guide RNAs

535

Individual guides were cloned into the pC0043-PspCas13b22 crRNA backbone

536

(addgene#103854, a kind gift from Feng Zhang lab), which we refer to as gRNA

537

backbone. This vector contains pspCas13b gRNA direct repeat (DR) sequence and

538

two BbsI restriction sites for spacer cloning. 20μg of DNA backbone was digested by

539

BbsI (NEB#) following the manufacturer’s instructions (2h at 37C). The digested

540

backbone was gel purified using NucleoSpin™ Gel and PCR Clean-up Kit (Thermo

541

Fisher 12), aliquoted, and stored in -20C°.

542

For gRNA cloning, a forward and reverse single-stranded DNA oligos

543

Cloning of pspCas13b-NES-HIV-T2A-BFP

551

The original pspCas13b (addgene#103862) is a gift from Feng Zhang lab22. A new

552

pspCas13 plasmid was designed by fusing a 3xFlag-T2A-BFP tag to the Cas13 C-

553

terminus using EcoRI and NheI enzymatic restriction. 5μg of pUC19 vector encoding

554

a Psp-Cas13b-3’end-3xFlag-T2A-BFP sequence was generated by DNA synthesis

555

(IDT).

556

PspCas13b-NES-HIV plasmids were digested by EcoRI/NheI restriction enzymes (1

614

For RNA silencing experiments, the fluorescence intensity was monitored using EVOS

615

M5000 FL Cell Imaging System (Thermo Fisher). Pictures were taken 48 hours (293

616

HEK) and 72 hours (VERO) post-transfection, and the fluorescence intensity of each

617

image was quantified using a lab-written macro in ImageJ software. Briefly, all images

618

obtained from a single experiment are simultaneously processed using a batch mode

619

macro. First, images are converted to 8-bit, threshold adjusted, converted to black and

620

white using Convert to Mask function, and fluorescence intensity per pixel measured

621

using Analyze Particles function. Each single mean fluorescence intensity was

622

obtained from four different field of views for each gRNA, and subsequently normalized

623

to the non-targeting (NT) control gRNA. Two-fold or higher reduction in fluorescence

624

intensity is considered as biologically relevant.

625

Cell flow cytometry

626

For monitoring cell transfection/transduction efficacy, cells were re-suspended in

627

200μL 1x PBS containing 2% FBS for flow cytometry analysis. All samples were

628

analyzed by an LSR II (BD Biosciences), FORTESSA X20 (BD Biosciences) or

629

FACSymphony (BD Biosciences). All flow cytometry profiles were analyzed using

630

FlowJo V10 software (Tree Star Inc).

641

Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) skin milk powder in PBST

642

with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hour at RT and probed overnight with primary antibody

643

(anti-HA, mAb #2367, Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 °C. Blots were washed three

644

times in PBST with 0.1% Tween20, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated

645

secondary antibody (Rabbit Anti-Mouse Immunoglobulins/HRP #p0260, Dako) for 1

646

hour at RT. Membranes were washed in PBST (0.1% Tween20) three times and

647

incubated in appropriate strength ECL detection reagent. Chemiluminescence was

648

detected using Invitrogen iBright Imaging Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

VERO cells infection assays.

650

VERO cells were transfected in 24-well plates and incubated for 48 h as described

651

above. VERO cells expressing pspCas14b-BFP and various gRNAs were then

652

infected in a level 3 containment laboratory with 200 μL of the ancestral or D614G

653

671

For titration of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2, VERO

672

cells were plated in 96-well plates at 20,000 cells per well in MEM containing 5% heat-

673

inactivated fetal bovine serum, Penicillin/Streptomycin, L-Glutamine and 15 mM

674

HEPES (Life Technologies). The cells were incubated overnight in a 5% CO2

675

environment at 37°C, washed once with PBS and then cultured in serum-free MEM

676

containing Penicillin/Streptomycin, L-Glutamine, 15 mM HEPES and 1 μg / mL TPCK-

677

treated trypsin. A 10-fold initial dilution of samples with one freeze-thaw cycle was

678

made in quadruplicate wells of the 96-well plates followed by 6 serial 10-fold dilutions.

679

The last row served as negative control without addition of any sample. After a 4-day

680

incubation, the plates were observed for the presence of cytopathogenic effect (CPE)

681

Supplementary Figures legends
Supplementary Table 1. Single-nucleotide increment spacer sequence (DNA) of
gRNAs covering the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2. The 30-nt spacer sequences
were generated using inhouse script written in Python and are complementary to the
target RNA. For each gRNA, we provide the matching location in the SARS-CoV-2
genome, the predicted secondary structure of the spacer and target sequences, and
the corresponding predicted minimum free energy (kcal/mol). The data in this table
are unfiltered and unranked.
Supplementary Table 2. Single-nucleotide increment spacer sequence of gRNAs
covering the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 are listed. The 30-nt spacer sequences
are complementary to the target, and were generated using inhouse code written in
Python. For each gRNA, we provide the matching coordinate in the SARS-CoV-2
genome, the predicted secondary structure of the spacer and target sequences, and
the predicted minimum free energy (kcal/mol). The data in this table are filtered to
remove spacer sequences that include 4 or more successive T residues that would
prematurely terminate Pol III-driven spacer transcription and generate non-functional
gRNAs. The gRNAs are ranked based on predicted secondary structures in the target
and spacer sequence.
Supplementary Table 3. Top scoring 839 gRNAs with a predicted open secondary
structure in the spacer and target sequences. These gRNAs are designed to fully
base-pair with various regions of SRAS-CoV-2 genome and are predicted to achieve
high silencing efficiency, given that Cas13b efficacy is governed by target accessibility.
Supplementary Table 4. All gRNAs used in this study are listed.
Supplementary Figure 1. (A) Bioinformatics pipeline for the design and selection of
pspCas13b gRNAs that are predicted to achieve high silencing efficiency. gRNAs are
tiled across the entire RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 with single-nucleotide
increments. gRNAs harbouring 4 or more successive T residues are removed to avoid
premature termination of Pol III-driven gRNA transcription, and the top 839 gRNAs
with predicted open secondary structure in the spacer and target are selected. (B)
Predicted secondary structure of the spacer (upper panels) and its target sequence
(lower panels) in the top scoring and lowest scoring gRNAs in Suppl. Table 1. The
RNA secondary structures were generated using the RNAfold program1 (ViennaRNA
webservices). The top scoring gRNA shows a predicted open structure for both the
spacer and the target, while both structures of the lowest scoring gRNA exhibit high
probability of folding into stem-loop that may impair gRNA loading into pspCas13b and
target accessibility.
Supplementary Figure 2. Dose-dependent silencing of NCP transcript with nontargeting gRNA (NT), wildtype gRNA1 (WT), gRNA1 harbouring 1-3, 1-6, or 1-9
nucleotides mismatches at the 5’end of the spacer. Data are normalized mean
fluorescence and errors are SD from 4 different field of views. N=1.
The dose-dependent silencing shows that the silencing efficiency is dependent on the
degree of base-pairing between the spacer and the target. The reduction in the
silencing efficiency is proportional to the number of mismatches within the spacertarget RNA-RNA duplex. For instance, with 0.8ng of WT, 1-3, 1-6, and 1-9 nucleotides
mismatches gRNAs we achieved 87%, 57%, 34%, and 5% silencing efficiency,
respectively. Thus, demonstrating the dependency between the spacer-target basepairing and silencing efficiency.

Supplementary Figure 3. Optimization of VERO cells transfection conditions. (A)
20,000 VERO cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and transfected with various
amounts of Spike-eGFP reporter plasmid (0-500ng). 48h later, the transfection
efficiency was measured by flow cytometry (FACS). (B) 20,000 VERO cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate and transfected with 100ng of Spike-eGFP reporter plasmid
packaged in either 0.3μL or 0.6μL of lipofectamine 3000. Flow cytometry analysis
showed that 0.6μL of lipofectamine 3000 gave the highest transfection efficiency
(36.8%). N=1. (C) FACS analysis of pspCas13b-BFP transfection efficiency in VERO
cells. VERO cells were transfected with pspCas13b-BFP, Spike-eGFP, and either NT
or four Spike-targeting gRNAs. Both transfection and silencing efficiencies were
measured by FACS 48h post-transfection. The gating strategy is shown in the upper
panels. In this experiment 25-30% of VERO cells expressed detectable levels of
pspCas13b-BFP. (D) The histogram quantifies eGFP mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) in each transfection condition that reflects the silencing of Spike-eGFP RNA in
pspCas13b-positive VERO cells.
Supplementary Figure 4. Silencing of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus
in infected VERO cells. (A) Schematic of infection assay to assess pspCas13bmediated suppression of SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected VERO cells. VERO cells
were transfected with liposomes containing pspCas13b-BFP and various gRNA
constructs. 72h post-transfection, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour and
the kinetic of viral replication was measured by assessing the infectivity of virus shed
into the culture medium at 1, 24, and 48hrs post-infection (B, D) infectivity assay to
evaluate the kinetics of viral replication in VERO cells expressing either NT or NCPtargeting gRNA1 at 0.01 (B) or 0.1 MOI. (C, E) infectivity assays to monitor the kinetics
of viral replication in VERO cells expressing either NT or various pools of gRNA
targeting NCP, Spike, NSP7 (RdRP subunit 7), or NSP8 at 0.01 (C) or 0,1 (E) MOI.
