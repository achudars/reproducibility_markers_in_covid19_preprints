Amyloid Formation of Serum Amyloid A

Abstract
A marker for the severeness and disease progress of COVID-19 is overexpression of serum
amyloid A (SAA) to levels that in other diseases are associated with a risk for SAA amyloidosis.
This secondary illness is characterized by formation and deposition of SAA amyloids in blood
vessels, causing inflammation, thrombosis and sometimes organ failure, with symptoms
resembling the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) observed in some COVID-19
survivors. Hence, in order to understand better the danger of SAA amyloidosis in the context of
COVID-19 we have used molecular dynamic simulations to study the effect of a SARS-COV-2
protein segment on SAA amyloid formation. We find that presence of the nine-residue segment
SK9, located on the Envelope protein, increases the propensity for SAA fibril formation by three
mechanisms: it reduces the stability of the lipid-transporting hexamer shifting the equilibrium
toward monomers, it increases the frequency of aggregation-prone configurations in the resulting
chains, and it raises the stability of SAA fibrils. Our results therefore suggest that SAA amyloidosis
-related pathologies are a long-term risk of SARS-COV-2 infections.

Introduction
While even after serious complications most COVID-19 survivors appear to recover completely,
only little is known about the long-term effects of infections by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Disease-associated symptoms such as inflammation of
blood vessels and overreaction of the immune system1–3

are connected with spikes in the

concentration of the human Serum Amyloid A (SAA) protein, with the level increasing as the
disease progresses from mild to critical4–6. The more than thousand times higher blood
concentrations of SAA in acute COVID-19 patients4,5 are comparable to the ones seen in patients
with various cancers or inflammatory diseases7 where the overexpression of SAA is associated
with systemic amyloidosis as a secondary illness. SAA amyloidosis is characterized by formation
and deposition of SAA amyloids in the blood vessels, causing inflammation, thrombosis and
eventually organ damage. Common complication of SAA amyloidosis such as kidney failure or
high incidents of thrombosis are also frequently observed in COVID-19 patients8,9. The similarity
of symptoms suggests that SAA amyloidosis may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms10, or that it
is a long-term risk in COVID-19 survivors causing, for instance, the broad spectrum of symptoms
in the multisystem inflammatory syndrome first reported in children and adolescents (MIS-C)11,
but also observed in adults (MIS-A). This hypothesis is the motivation for the present study where
using molecular dynamics simulations we probe how presence of SARS-COV-2 affects formation
and stability of SAA amyloids.
The overexpression of SAA in some cancers or inflammatory diseases leads not in all cases to
amyloidosis. Usually, after a spike, the concentration levels decrease rapidly in a process that
involves dissociation of SAA hexamers followed by cleavage of the released chains. In our

previous work12, we proposed that the cleavage happens in part because the fragments have a lower
probability to re-assemble into the functional hexamers than the complete SAA1−104 proteins. We
also observed that unlike other fragments, the most commonly found SAA1−76 can switch between
two structural motifs. The first one is easy to proteolyze (allowing to lower rapidly the SAA
concentration) but vulnerable for aggregation, while the opposite is the case for the second motif.
If amyloid formation takes longer than proteolysis, the aggregation-prone species dominates.
However, if environmental conditions such as low pH encourage amyloid formation, the
configurational ensemble shifts toward the more protected form. In this picture, amyloidosis
happens when this mechanism for downregulating SAA concentration becomes overwhelmed or
otherwise fails. In COVID-19 patients this could happen in three ways: first, presence of SARSCOV-2 could lower the stability of the functional hexamers; secondly, it could increase the
probability for association of the SAA fragments after cleavage; and thirdly, it could enhance the
stability of the resulting SAA fibrils; each possibility shifting the equilibrium toward SAA fibril
formation.

orange. Enlarge is also shown the E-protein assembled as a pentamer with the SK9 segments
colored in dark blue. The SARS-COV-2 virion is drawn from data in Yu et. al.14, while the Eprotein pentamer structure is extracted from Ref. 18.

In this computational study, we probe all three possibilities, but focus on the effect of viral proteins,
i.e., neglecting the potential roles played by viral RNA. In order to reduce computational costs,
we restrict ourselves to short amyloidogenic regions on viral proteins that are most likely to interact
with SAA. An example is the nine-residue-segment S55FYVYSRVK63 (SK9) on the C-terminal
tail of the SARS-COV2-Envelope protein, see Figure 1. As its location makes it likely to interact
with SAA proteins, and as its homolog in SARS-COV-1 is known to interfere with amylin
aggregation13, we investigate in our simulations the interaction of the SK9 segment with the SAA
hexamers, monomeric SAA1-76-fragments and the SAA fibrils as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: X-ray crystal structure of full-length SAA1-104 hexamer (PDB ID: 4IP8) shown in (a) in
a top-down view and in (b) in a side view. Each chain consists of four helix-bundles: the N-terminal
helix-I (residues 1–27), helix-II (residues 32–47), helix-III (residues 50–69) and the C-terminal
helix-IV (residues 73–88). N- and C-terminal residues are here and in all other sub-figures
represented by blue and red spheres, respectively. In the start configuration, the virus protein
segment SK9 binds with SAA1-104 hexamer at the N-terminal helix-I (green) or residues in the
helix-III (yellow). The monomer structure of the SAA1-76 fragment in (c) is derived from the Xray crystal structure (PDB-ID: 4IP9), while the representative configurations for the helixweakened (d) and helix-broken (e) SAA1-76 monomers are taken from our previous work12. The
initial binding positions of SK9 at N-terminal helix-I (green) , helix-I-helix-II linker (orange) and
disordered C-terminus (yellow) are also shown. Finally, we show in (f) the fibril fragment 2F2L
as extracted from the cryo-EM structure of the human SAA fibril (PDB ID: 6MST). In the start
configuration, the SK9 segment binds to the SAA2-55 fibril at either the N-terminus (green), Cterminal cavity (violet) or the packing interface (orange).

Materials and Methods
System Preparation
In order to evaluate the effect of the nine-residue SK9-segment S55FYVYSRVK63 (located in the
C-terminal tail of the Envelope protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus) on Serum Amyloid A (SAA)
amyloid formation, we evaluate the change in stability of the known hexamer, monomer, and fibril
models upon binding, comparing the complex of SK9 and SAA to the corresponding “pure” SAA
models.

We choose as the initial configuration for the SAA1-104 hexamer

the X-ray-resolved crystal

structure, deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under identifier 4IP815 and shown by us in
Figure 2a-b. Note, that we add here and in the following cases a NH3+- group at the N-terminus
and a COO- -end group at the C-terminus. These end groups are chosen to make our simulations
consistent with our previous work12. As in vivo SAA monomers are cleaved enzymatically, with
SAA1-76 the most common resulting fragment, we consider the following three models for our
simulation of monomers. The first one, shown in Figure 2c, is generated by removing the residues
77−104 from the crystal structure of the full-length SAA monomer (PDB ID: 4IP9)15, while the

other two configurations were derived by us in Reference 11 as typical motifs found in long-time
simulations of the fragment, and named by us “helix-weakened” (Figure 2d) and “helix-broken”
(Figure 2e). Finally, for simulation of SAA fibrils we have used tetramers made of two folds
(protofibrils) and two layers, since we have identified in previous work16 such 2F2L tetramers
as the smallest stable fibril fragments. Our 2F2L model is shown in Figure 2f and is derived from
the cryo-EM structure deposited in the PDB database under identifier 6MST17. Note that the fibril
model is made of SAA fragments with residues 2-55 since no fibril model for human SAA1-76 is
available. Initially, we built also

a second fibril model where we added the likely disordered

missing residues 56 to 76 in a configuration predicted by homology modeling. However, we
discarded this model for reasons discussed in the result section.

Simulation starting from the above described SAA models serve as a control against which we
compare our simulations of the various SAA models interacting

with SK9 segments

S55FYVYSRVK63 which is located in the C-terminal tail of the Envelope protein of the SARSCOV-2 virus. As with the exception of the transmembrane domain of residues 8-3818 the
Envelope protein has not been resolved, we have generated the initial configuration for the SK9
fragment from a model derived by a machine-learning approach and subsequent refinement by
molecular dynamics19. For this purpose, we have removed from this model the residues 1-54 and
64-75, afterwards capping the remaining nine-residue segment with a NH3+ -group at the Nterminus and CONH2 as the C-terminus. These end groups were chosen to avoid strong
electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged terminal residues.

Using the AutoDock Vina software20, we have generated the start configurations for our
simulations by docking the SK9-segments in a ratio 1:1 with the SAA chains in our models.
The resulting binding positions of the SK9 segments in the start configurations of either SAA
hexamer, monomers, or fibrils, are also shown in Figure 2. In the case of the hexamer are the
binding positions obtained from a global search, and the configuration with lowest energy is
chosen as start configuration. On the other hand, we have performed for each SAA1−76 monomer
three independent searches, focusing on either the N-terminus, the helix-I – helix-II linker, or the
C-terminal region; and chose the respective lowest energy binding pose as the start configuration
of the respective runs. Finally, for our fibril models we have again identified SK9 binding positions
by a global search using AutoDock Vina.
The various models, either with SK9 binding to the SAA chains or without SK9 present, are each
put in a rectangular box with periodic boundary condition. The box is chosen such that there is a
minimum distance of 15 Å between any SAA or SK9 atom and all box sides. Each box is filled
with TIP3P21 water molecules, and counter ions are added to neutralize the system. Table 1 lists
for all systems the number of water molecules and total number of atoms.

Simulation Protocol
All simulations are carried out using the GROMACS 2018 package22 and are employing the
CHARMM 36m all-atom force field23 and TIP3P water21. Number and length of runs are also
listed in Table 1. For each system, we have taken the configurations generated above, and
minimized their energy using the steepest-descent algorithm. This step is followed by 200 ps of
molecular dynamic simulations in the NVT ensemble (keeping the volume constant) at 310 K, and
a subsequent run of 200 ps in the NPT ensemble keeping the pressure at 1 atm. During the NVT
and NPT equilibrations, the nonhydrogen (heavy) atoms of protein are restrained with a force
constant of 1,000 kJ mol-1 nm-2.

The so-equilibrated configurations are the start point of our production runs where the
respective systems evolve at a constant temperature of 310 K and a constant pressure of 1 atm. For
each set-up we followed three independent trajectories starting from different initial velocity
distributions. Note that in these simulations the position of the SK9 segment is not restrained to
the original docking sites. Instead, it can move and even detach over the course of the simulation.
The temperature is controlled during the simulation with a v-rescale thermostat,24 and the pressure
with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat,25 using a coupling constant of 2 ps. Keeping the water
geometry fixed with SETTLE algorithm26 and constraining non-water bonds including hydrogen
atoms with the LINCS algorithm27 allowed us to use a timestep of 2fs for integrating the equations
of motion. As we use three-dimensional orthorhombic periodic boundary conditions, we have to
use the particle-mesh Ewald (PME)28 method for calculating electrostatic interactions. This is done
with a real-space cutoff of 12 Å, a value also used as cut-off for Van der Waal interactions, where
smoothing started at 10.5 Å.

Trajectory Analysis
Most of our analysis relies on GROMACS tools such as gmx_rms for calculating the Root-meansquare-deviation (RMSD) with respect to the initial configuration. Another example is the
do_dssp tool which implements the Dictionary of Secondary Structure in Proteins (DSSP)29 and
allows calculation of residue-wise secondary structure propensities. For visualization and for
calculating the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) we use VMD software.30 Quantities such
as the cavity diameter ⟨dcavity⟩ in the hexamer are calculated by In-house programs, averaging over
the center-of-mass distances between the N-terminal helix-I regions of adjacent units of both
layers. Another example is the fraction of native contacts which is calculated using a soft cutoff
algorithm and which is defined as31:
𝑄(𝑟, 𝑟! ) =

1
1 + 𝑒"($%&$! )

Here, r is the distance between two heavy atoms at which a contact is formed in the native state
and r0 denotes this distance in the native state. β denotes smoothing parameter taken to be 5 Å,
while λ represents the fluctuation when contact is formed, taken to be 1.8.

Results
Effect of SK9- segments on SAA hexamers
One of the symptoms of COVID-19 is an increase in the concentration of SAA to levels that in a
number of cancers and inflammatory diseases often, but not always, leads to amyloidosis as a
secondary illness. The response to the overexpression of SAA includes in these diseases a
dissociation of the hexamers. The subsequent cleavage of the resulting SAA monomers into
fragments is likely because these fragments

have a lower probability than the full SAA1-104

protein to reassemble as hexamer.12 Hence, we start our investigation into the effect of the SK9

segment on SAA amyloidosis by probing how presence of SK9 alters the equilibrium between
hexamers and monomers.

As the monomer - hexamer equilibrium depends on the stability of the SAA hexamer, we explore
first the change in stability of the SAA hexamer upon binding of SK9 segments. The loss of
stability can be monitored by measuring over the length of the trajectory the root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) to the start configuration. If this RMSD is calculated over all heavy atoms in
the hexamer, we call this a global RMSD. On the other hand, if the RMSD is calculated separately
for each chain, and averaged over all six chains, we talk of a chain RMSD. Hence, the global
RMSD measures the structural deviation of the entire hexamer, whereas the chain-RMSD
represents the structural distortion of each chain in the hexamer. Note that we evaluate in both
cases the RMSD only for residues 1-76 to stay consistent with our previous work12. In Figure 3ab, we plot the time evolution of the global RMSD, averaged over three independent trajectories,
comparing the case of SAA bound with the SK9 segment to our control, the hexamer in the absence
of SK9. The global RMSD for the SAA hexamer rises in the control simulation initially by nearly
3.0 Å, but quickly reaches a plateau within the first 100 ns, and over the next 400 ns increases only
gradually. On the other hand, when the SK9 segments are bound to the SAA chains, the global
RMSD rises in the first 100 ns also by about 3.0 Å, but instead of approaching a plateau, continues
to rise in a step-wise fashion to a RMSD of 5.0 Å and higher. The differences are much smaller
for the chain RMSD, indicating that the interaction with the SK9 segments disturbs the association
of SAA chains but not the configuration of the individual chains.

This can be also seen by comparing the final configurations of both systems

in Figure 3c-d,

where we show the binding of the SK9 segments to the interfacial regions and the resulting
distortion of the hexamer. In order to quantify this distortion, we plot in Figure 3e-f the time
evolution of the cavity diameter ⟨dcavity⟩ for both systems. Strongly correlated with the global
RMSD we find for the hexamer in absence of SK9 that the cavity diameter approaches quickly a
plateau, while for the hexamer in complex with SK9 segments the values again increase stepwise,
with a pronounced step at in <dcavity> at 250 ns.

Representative final configurations (at 800 ns) for the two cases are shown in (c) and (d),
respectively, with N- and C-terminal residues represented by blue and red spheres, respectively.
Note that the positions of the SK9 segments are also shown in (c). The visual differences are
quantified by the cavity diameter plotted in (e) for the SAA1-104 hexamer in complex with SK9,
and in (f) for our control. All data are averaged over three trajectories, with the shaded region in
(a),(b), and (e),(f) representing the standard deviation over the trajectories.

In order to understand in more detail how SK9 affects the association of the SAA chains in the
hexamer, we consider in Figure 4a the solvent-exposure of the hydrophobic residues in the
hexamer. For this purpose, we have measured in each of the three trajectories the solventaccessible surface area (SASA) of exposed hydrophobic residues over the last 500 ns using VMD
with a spherical probe of 1.8 Å radius. We observe in Figure 4a for the hydrophobic residues that
in the presence of SK9 the SASA distribution is shifted towards higher values indicating solvent
exposure of interfacial residues. The mean SASA value for hydrophobic residues in presence of
SK9 is (10,108 ± 247) Å2, and (9,511 ± 275) Å2 in absence of SK9. Thus the hydrophobic solvent
accessible surface increases by about 6 % in presence of SK9 segments, leading to the lower
stability of the hexamer indicated by the higher global RMSD values in Figure 3a.

The resulting loss in contacts can be seen in Figure 4b where we plot the time evolution of the
number of native inter-chain contacts, i.e., contacts between SAA chains in the hexamer that also
exist in the start configuration. We define contacts by a distance cut-off of 4.5 Å and calculate the
fraction of the inter-chain native contacts as described in the method section. In both systems
decreases this fraction within the first 50 ns. However, it reaches a stable value with little
fluctuation after 100 ns in the control simulation, whereas in presence of SK9 the loss of contacts
continues and is clearly more pronounced after about 250ns. For a more fine-grained picture we
have calculated the inter-residue contact probabilities between monomers; defining two residues

whose heavy atoms lie within 7 Å of each other as a contact pair. Analyzing these contacts, we
find multiple π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions involving the residues F3, F4, W18, F68, F69
and I65 that stabilize the interface region, as do the inter-chain salt bridges between pairs D12-R25,
E9-R25 and E26-R47. On average we find in our control, that is for the hexamer in absence of the
SK9 segments, (1078± 96) interfacial contacts. However, when present, the SK9 segments bind
with the above listed interfacial residues, disrupting the interchain network in the hexamer, and
the number of interfacial contacts decreases to an average of (704± 81) contacts. As an example,
we show in Figure 4c-d representative snapshots of the A and C chain from the control simulation
and from the hexamer binding with SK9. In the control simulation (Figure 4c) are residues F3 and
F4 from chain A in contact with residues F68 and F69 from chain C, while in Figure 4d tyrosine and
valine residues from a SK9 segment bind with the residues F3 and F4 from chain A, thereby
preventing π-π stacking with residues F68 and F69 from chain C. We have quantified this effect for
the salt bridge forming residues D12 and R25. For this pair, we plot in Figure 4e the probability
distribution of the center of mass distance for both the control, and for the hexamer in presence of
SK9 segments. Measurements for both systems are taken over the last 500 ns of all three respective
trajectories. The shift in the center-of-mass distance toward larger values in presence of SK9
demonstrates the disruption of the interfacial salt bridge formed by the two residues D12 and R25
in the control. The loss of this salt bridge in presence of SK9 destabilizes the SAA hexamer. This
can be seen in Figure 4f where for a representative trajectory of the SAA hexamer in presence of
SK9 segments we compare the time evolution of the center of mass distance between D12 of chain
A and R25 of chain C with the time evolution of the global RMSD. The strong correlation between
both quantities is especially visible at 250 ns where the loss of the salt bridge (once the distance
between the two residues is larger than 4.0 Å) is mirrored by a jump in RMSD.

stability indicates that in presence of the SK9 segments the equilibrium is shifted away from the
hexamer and toward monomers.

While this shift downregulates the activity of SAA, it also

increases the chance for aggregation.

Effect of SK9- segments on SAA1-76 monomers
We argue in Ref. 11 that after dissociation of the hexamer the monomers are cleaved

into

fragments because this eases their proteolysis. The most common fragment SAA1-76 is special in
that it evolves into an ensemble of configurations dominated by two forms. The first one is easy
to proteolyze (allowing for a quick decrease in SAA concentration) but vulnerable to aggregation,
while the situation is reversed for the second motif. If amyloid formation takes longer than
proteolysis, the aggregation-prone species prevails. However, if external factors encourage
amyloid formation, the frequency of the more protected motif increases. Hence, in the second part
of our investigation we study how the interaction with SK9 alters this mechanism.

For this purpose, we have simulated three systems. The first one is a SAA1-76-fragment in the same
configuration as seen in the full-sized free monomer (PDB-ID: 4IP9). This is presumably the
structure of the fragment right after cleavage. We follow the time evolution of this fragment in
the presence of SK9 segments in three molecular dynamics simulations, with the SK9 segment
initially docked to either the helix-I – helix-II linker, the N-terminus, or to the C-terminal region.
We then compare our results from these three simulations with control simulations where the SK9segment is absent. When initially binding to the helix-I - helix-II linker, the SK9 segment separates
within 500 ns from the SAA monomer and moves away, and the time evolution of the SAA chain
is similar to the control simulation. Hence, we discuss in the following only the other two cases.
For instance, we show in Figure 5 the time evolution of the secondary structure for the trajectory
where the SK9- segment initially binds with the disordered C-terminal region. Over the course of
the simulation the SK9 segment shifts its binding partners to hydrophobic residues in N-terminal
helix-I (L7, A10 and F11) and some residues encompassing the helix-III and disordered C-terminal
region (W53, A54, E56, A57, D60, N64, I65, R67, F68, G70 and E74), see also the corresponding snapshot
in Figure 5. As a consequence of this binding pattern, we observe formation of a β-hairpin,
involving residues 28–30 and 33–35 in the helix-I – helix-II linker and in the beginning of helixIII. Helix-II (residues 32-47) unfolds completely over the course of the simulation. This β-hairpin
formation was also observed in a previous study by Gursky et. Al,32 but is on the time scale of our
simulations not seen in the control simulations. Both the unfolding of helix-I and helix-II and the
β-hairpin formation in the helix-I – helix-II linker region are also not observed, when the SK9segment binds initially to the N-terminal helix-I, but the two trajectories are otherwise similar.
Configurations in both trajectories resemble the easy-to-proteolyze, but aggregation prone, helixweakened configurations of Figure 2d, sharing similar

reduced helicity of residues 63-69 in

helix-III (the mean helicity percentages are (43 ±41)% and (69 ±31)%, respectively) and a
comparable solvent accessible surface area for the first eleven N-terminal residues (with mean
SASA values of (525 ±106) Å2, and (564 ±48) Å2 respectively).
Without the viral amyloidogenic segment present, the SAA1-76-fragment can also evolve into the
helix-broken form of Figure 2e which is more difficult to proteolyze but also less aggregationprone. Our simulations indicate that presence of SK9 alters the distribution of the two forms,
shifting it to the more aggregation-prone helix-weakened form. Depending on the effect that
presence of SK9 has on the stability of the two forms this would imply a raised probability for
SAA-fibril formation. Hence, we have also performed molecular dynamic simulations of helixbroken and helix weakened SAA1-76-fragments interacting with a SK9 segment initially docked to
either the N-terminus, the helix-I – helix-I -linker, or the C-terminal region.

Independent on where the SK9 segment is initially docked, we observe that in all our trajectories,
starting from SAA1-76 in the helix-broken configuration, the virus segment disengages and moves
away. Consequently, no noticeable differences to the control simulation are seen. This observation
suggests that once the SAA fragment assumes a helix-broken configuration, it will not be affected
by presence of the viral segment and will stay in this less aggregation-prone motif. On the other
hand, when the SK9 segment is initially bound to SAA1-76 in the helix-weakened form, we find
after about 800 ns a clear signal for forming a N-terminal b-strand involving the first eleven
residues. This observation is independent on where the SK9 segment initially binds to the SAA
chain, see, for instance, the snapshots of representative configurations in Figure 6a.

The

appearance of a N-terminal b-strand is important as this region is known to be crucial for amyloid
formation33–35, and we have shown in Ref. 11 that fibril assembly starts with this region.

Figure 6: Representative snapshots extracted from a simulation of the SAA1-76 monomer in the
presence of SK9, binding to either the N-terminus (a), the helix-II – helix-III linker (b), or the Cterminus (c). In the start configuration the SAA fragment is in all three trajectories in the helixweakened form. N-and C-terminus are marked by a blue and red sphere, respectively.
As in the earlier discussed simulations starting from a native-like configuration for the SAA1-76
fragment, we also observe the β-sheet formation in the helix-I - helix-II linker region or the
disordered C-terminal region, see the corresponding snapshots in Figure 6b and 6c. Note that
while the initial binding sites are obtained from docking calculations, visual inspection of the
trajectories shows that the SK9 segment does not stay bound at the initial position. Instead, it
preferentially binds with hydrophobic (A10 and A14) and aromatic residues (F11 and W18) in Nterminal helix-I region, along with binding to helix-III and the disordered C-terminal region
through hydrophobic (A54, A57, I58 and A61), aromatic (W53, F68 and F69) and electrostatic
interaction (E56, D60, E74 and D75). Note that the binding probability of SK9- segment towards the
helix-I - helix-II linker region is relatively low in our simulations, but when binding occurs, the
segment forms of a β-hairpin with the linker region (shown in Figure 6b).

The increased propensity for β-strand formation is confirmed by Figure 7 where we plot the
secondary structure as function of time. No β-strands are formed in the control simulations

(Figure 7a), while there is a clear signal for it in Figure 7b where we show the same quantity
for a trajectory where the SAA monomer binds initially with the SK9 segment at the helix-I helix-II linker region.

Figure 7: Residue-wise secondary structure measured along a trajectory of the SAA1-76 monomer
in (a) absence and (b) presence of the SK9-segment. Both simulations start with the SAA
fragment in a helix-weakened configuration.
Hence, a second effect by which SK9 can increase SAA amyloid formation is by shifting the
equilibrium toward helix-weakened SAA1-76-fragments and by initiating the β-sheet formation in
these fragments. The higher probability for forming an N-terminal b-strand (residues S2-S5),
known to be the start point for fibril formation33,34,36, results from interaction between N-terminus
(residues 1-6) and C-terminal region (residues 65-72), more precisely π-π stacking (F3-F68 and F4F69) and hydrophobic (F6-I65) interactions. In order to specify these relations we show in Figure 8
the difference between the residue-residue contact probabilities which measured in simulations of
the helix-weakened SAA1-76 in the presence of a SK9- segment, and the ones measured in the
control simulations where no SK9 segment is present. The contact propensities are averaged over
the last 3.0 µs of all three trajectories. These relative contact probabilities show that hydrophobic

interaction between helix-I and helix-III involving residues A10-A54, A14-I58, M17-I58 and Y21-R62
are significantly enhanced in the presence of the SK9- segment. In contrast, the SK9- segment
weakens the interactions within the N-terminal helix-I (F4-A14 and S5-F11). SK9 binding also
increases the salt-bridge propensity of E9-R47 and decreases the salt-bridge propensity of D16-R47.
Of special interest is the change in the contact pattern in the helix-I - helix-II linker region. Here,
the SK9- segment increases

the hydrophobic interactions between the helix-I - helix-II linker

region and the end of helix-I involving the residue pairs M24-I30, M24-F36 and A20-F36, but decreases
the hydrophobic interactions between helix-II or helix-III and the disordered C-terminal region
involving residues pairs F36-A55 and F36-I58. Hence, the SK9– segment disrupts residue-residue
contact pattern in the otherwise unchanged helix-I and helix-III region, thereby inducing the βsheet formation in the N-terminal helix-I and the helix-I - helix-II linker region.

Effect of SK9- segments on the stability of SAA fibrils
In the previous two sections we have shown that the SK9 segments reduce the stability of the
hexamer, making it easier to dissolve the hexamer; and that they raise the aggregation propensity
of the monomer fragments by encouraging the N-terminal residues to assume a b-strand
configuration that is known to be crucial for fibril formation33–36. In our third set of simulations,

we finally study the effect of the amyloidogenic segment on the stability of SAA fibrils. This is
because stabilization of the fibril will shift the equilibrium between hexamers, monomers, and
fibrils toward the fibrils. Having identified in previous work16 a two-fold-two-layer (2F2L) tetramer
as the critical size for fibril stability, we have simulated the effect of SK9 on such tetramers. The
creation of the start configuration and the set-up of the simulations are described in the method
section. Note that our fibril model is made of segments SAA2-55 as no fibril model for human
SAA1-76 is available. A second fibril model with the missing residues 56 to 76 added by homology
modeling was no longer considered by us after we realized that the SK9 segment does not bind to
the disordered region of residues 56-76. This is because we had seen in previous work16 that the
added presence of the residues 56-76 by itself does not affect the stability of the SAA2-55 chains
in the fibril form. Hence, we have only performed molecular dynamics simulations of the 2F2L
tetramer, built from SAA2-55 chains, either in the presence or -as control – in the absence of SK9
segments.

Following the two systems over 300 ns, we compare the change in stability along the trajectories
between the two cases. Representative final configurations are shown together with the
corresponding start configurations in Figure 9. Visual inspection of these configurations suggests
that the fibril is stabilized by the SK9 segment.

segments, is shown in (a), while the SAA2-55 fibril bound with SK9 segments is shown in (b).
Representative final configurations (at 300 ns) for the two cases are shown in (c) and (d). N- and
C-terminal residues are represented by blue and red spheres, respectively.
The above visual inspection is again quantified by following the time evolution of global RMSD
(measured over the whole fibril) and chain RMSD in Figure 10, where the later one is the average
over RMSD measurements of the individual chains. Similar to the hexamer, we observe for both
systems an initial increase in both RMSD values, which plateaus for the SK9-bound fibril after
about 100 ns while the RMSD continues to rise for the fibril in absence of the viral segment until
reaching a global RMSD of 8.0 Å after 200 ns. The stabilization of the SAA fibril in presence of
SK9 is also supported by the smaller root-mean-square-fluctuation, also shown in Figure 10 and

calculated over the last 200 ns, as they indicate that the shape of the individual chains changes less
than in the control.

absence (in black) and presence of SK9 (in red). Chain RMSD values are averages over all four
chains in the SAA fibril and all three trajectories. Backbone RMSF values are for the final 200 ns
of each trajectory. The shaded region represents the standard deviation. The RMSD and RMSF
values are calculated with respect to the experimentally solved structure considering all backbone
atoms in residues 2-55
The observed stabilization of the chain architecture is interesting as the amyloidogenic segment is
binding to the outside of the chains, i.e., the stabilization has to be indirect by either enhancing
stacking or packing of chains. Analyzing the contact pattern, we find that presence of SK9 leads

to an increase in hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts involved in the stacking of chains.
While at the same time the SK9 segment reduces the contacts and hydrogen bonds involved in the
packing of the two folds, this loss of contacts is compensated by the new interactions with the
SK9- segment. The binding probabilities of SK9- segments towards the SAA fibril shown in
Figure 11 indicate that the SK9- segment binds to the hydrophobic and aromatic residues in the
N-terminal and the C-terminal region. This binding stabilizes residue-residue stacking contacts,
but also reduces the inter-strand packing distance (shown in Table 2) through forming contacts
with certain charged (E26 and D33), polar residues (N27) and hydrophobic residues (M24 and A30)
at the packing interface. Here, we define the inter-strand packing distance by the center of mass
distance between two folds at their packing interface (residues 28-31). Note that the data for the
control differ slightly from the one listed in Ref. 15 as our simulations are with 300 ns longer than
the 100 ns of the simulations of Ref. 15.

In Figure 12, we plot the residue-residue stacking contact probability maps of the SAA fibril in
the presence (a) or absence (b) of the SK9- segment. The difference between the two cases is
shown in Figure 12c. Our data indicate that the residue-residue contact probability of the first 21
residues in the N-terminal region, the most hydrophobic and amyloidogenic segment of the protein,
increases in presence of SK9- segment. Especially enhanced are the π-π stacking and the
hydrophobic interaction involving residues F3, F4, L7, F6, F11, A10, W18 and M17, and the propensity
of residues R15 and D16 to form salt bridges. Additional stabilization of the fibril occurs at the Cterminal cavity (residues 23–51) through salt-bridges (D23-R25, R25-E26 and D33-K34), π-π stacking
interactions (W53-W53) and hydrophobic interactions (A54-A55, A55-A55, A54-A54, W53-A55 and

Conclusions
The concentration of Human Serum Amyloid A (SAA) in acute COVID-19 patients can grow to
levels that

in patients with certain cancers or inflammatory diseases may cause systemic

amyloidosis as a secondary illness. Hence, SARS-COV-2 infections may also increase the risk for
SAA amyloid formation and subsequent pathologies. However, overexpression of SAA does not
always lead to systemic amyloidosis, and mechanisms exist for downregulating SAA
concentration and minimizing the risk for amyloidosis. In the present paper we use molecular
dynamics to study how presence of SARS-COV-2 proteins may interfere with these protection
mechanisms by changing the propensity for forming SAA amyloids. In order to reduce
computational cost, we have restricted ourselves the nine-residue-segment S55FYVYSRVK63
(SK9) on the C-terminal tail of the SARS-COV2-Envelope protein whose location makes it likely
to interact with SAA proteins.

Our simulations show that SARS-COV-2 proteins can increase the risk for SAA fibril formation
by three mechanism. First, binding of the SK9 reduces the stability of the biologically active SAA
hexamer in which SAA transports lipids during inflammation, shifting the equilibrium toward
monomers. As monomers are SAA proteins subject to enzymatic cleavage into smaller fragments,
and only these fragments are found in SAA fibrils. Hence, by shifting the equilibrium toward the
monomers, presence of the viral protein segment SK9 increases the risk for fibril formation. This
risk is further enhanced by the interaction of SK9 with the SAA fragments, which increase the
frequency of the aggregation prone form (called by us helix-weakened) and for this motif raises

the propensity to form b-strands, especially for the first eleven residues known to be crucial for
fibril formation. Finally, presence of the amyloidogenic segment SK9 also stabilizes SAA fibrils,
moving further the equilibrium toward the fibril, and therefore enhancing the probability for
amyloid formation. Hence, our simulations strengthen our hypothesis that SARSCOV-2 infections
raise the risk for SAA amyloidosis during or after COVID-19. As SAA amyloidosis is
characterized by formation and deposition of SAA amyloids in the blood vessels, causing
inflammation and thrombosis, it may be behind the broad spectrum of severe and at times lifethreatening cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurological symptoms, commonly
summarized as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MISC) sometimes observed in COVID-19
survivors11.

It is interesting to speculate why amyloidogenic regions such as SK9 on SARS-COV-2 proteins
seem to have such a pronounced effect on SAA amyloid formation. One possibility would be that
fibril formation is part of the immune response and serves as a way to entrap and neutralize the
virus. Such a microbial protection hypothesis37,38 has been suggest in context of Herpes Simplex I
infections and the development of Alzheimer’s Disease. Amyloid formation by SAA may serve a
similar role, with SAA amyloidosis would be a consequence of this mechanism becoming
overwhelmed. Further work will be needed to test this hypothesis.
