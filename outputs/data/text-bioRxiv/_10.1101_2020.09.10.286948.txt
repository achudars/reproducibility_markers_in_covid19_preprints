Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mediates entry into cells and is critical for vaccine development
against COVID-19. Structural studies have revealed distinct conformations of S, but realtime information that connects these structures, is lacking. Here we apply single-molecule
5

Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational
dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four
distinct conformational states. In response to hACE2, S opens sequentially into the hACE2bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate. Conformational
preferences of convalescent plasma and antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization

10

involving either competition with hACE2 for binding to RBD or allosteric interference with
conformational changes required for entry. Our findings inform on mechanisms of S
recognition and conformations for immunogen design.

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mediates entry into cells and is a main target for antibody responses
15

against the virus(1-4). S is synthesized as a precursor, processed into S1 and S2 by furin
proteases, and activated for fusion when human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)
engages the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and when the N-terminus of S2 is proteolytically
processed(5-7). Structures of soluble ectodomains and native virus particles have revealed
distinct conformations of S, including a closed trimer with all RBD oriented downward, trimers

20

with one or two RBDs up, and hACE2-stabilized conformations with up to three RBD oriented
up(6-18). Real-time information that connects these structures, however, has been lacking.
smFRET is well suited to inform on conformational dynamics of proteins reporting domain
movements in the millisecond to second range, and has previously been applied to study HIV-1,

influenza A, and Ebola spike glycoproteins, via measurements of the distance-dependent energy
transfer from an excited donor to a nearby acceptor fluorophores in real-time(19-23).

To probe dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spikes, we used available high-resolution structures of the
5

SARS-CoV-2 S trimer to identify sites of fluorophore pair labeling that have the potential to
inform on distance changes expected to accompany conformational changes between the RBDdown and receptor hACE2-induced RBD-up trimer structures(14, 17) (Fig. S1). Accordingly, we
engineered A4 and Q3 labeling peptides before and after the receptor-binding motif (RBM) to
allow site-specific introduction of donor and acceptor fluorophores at these positions (Fig. 1, A,

10

B, and Fig. S1). We optimized retroviral and lentiviral pseudoviral particles carrying the SARSCoV-2 S protein (Fig. S2) to test the impact of these peptides on infectivity, and found that they
were well tolerated, both individually and in combination (Fig. S1D). To measure
conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer on the surface of virus particles, we
established two types of particles, lentiviral pseudoparticles carrying S, as well as coronavirus-

15

like particles generated by expression of S, membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N)
protein (S-MEN)(24, 25) (Fig. 1, A and B). S-MEN particles co-express coronavirus surface
proteins M and E. Particle quality and the presence of the corona-like S proteins on both particle
surfaces were confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D).

20

For smFRET, lentivirus particles and S-MEN particles were generated (see Materials and
Methods) by transfecting HEK293T cells with an excess of plasmid-encoding wild-type, doped
with trace amounts of plasmid expressing labeling peptide-carrying S to ensure the production of
virus particles that contain, on average, only a single engineered S protein. As for analogous

investigations of HIV-1 Envelope protein(19, 21), donor (Cy3B(3S)) and acceptor fluorophore
(LD650) were enzymatically conjugated to the engineered S proteins presented on the virus
particle surface in situ (see Materials and Methods). A biotinylated lipid was then incorporated
into the virus particle membrane to allow their immobilization within passivated microfluidic
5

devices coated with streptavidin to enable imaging by total internal reflection microscopy
(Fig.1A). Donor fluorophores on single, immobilized virus particles were excited by a singlefrequency 532 nm laser and fluorescence emission from both donor and acceptor fluorophores
were recorded at 25 Hz (Fig. 2A). From the recorded movies, we computationally extracted
hundreds of smFRET traces exhibiting anti-correlated donor and acceptor fluorescence

10

intensities, the telltale signature of conformational changes within the S protein on individual
virus particles.

Analyses of smFRET data from ligand-free S protein on lentiviral particles revealed that the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein is dynamic, sampling at least four distinct conformational states
15

characterized by low- (~0.1), intermediate- (~0.3 and ~0.5), and high- (~0.8) FRET efficiency
(FRET). Population FRET histograms, comprised of hundreds of smFRET traces, revealed that
the conformation exhibiting intermediate FRET (~0.5) to be the most abundantly occupied
(Fig.2B, and Table S1). Comparable findings were obtained for S protein incorporated into SMEN coronavirus-like particles (Fig. 2C). Notably, the intermediate-FRET (~0.5) conformation

20

of the S protein was stabilized by a disulfide bridge between amino acids 383 and 985 (Fig. 2D,
Fig.S3, A and B). Because electron microscopy (EM) methods have identified the disulfidebridge stabilized state as the three-RBD-down conformation(9, 11), these experiments suggest

the intermediate- (~0.5) FRET S protein conformation to represent the closed trimer with all
three RBD oriented downward (RBD-down conformation).

To identify the receptor-bound conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by smFRET, we
5

measured the conformational consequences of soluble, monomeric hACE2 binding. Addition of
the monomeric hACE2 receptor to surface-immobilized virus particles lead to increased
occupancy of the low- (~0.1) FRET S protein conformation (Fig. 2E), which was observed at
both the single-molecule and population level (Fig. 2F). Similar hACE2 receptor impacts on the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein were observed in both lentiviral particle and S-MEN coronavirus-like

10

particle contexts (Fig. 2, E to G). Dimeric hACE2, a more potent ligand (Fig. S4A)(26),
stabilized the low- (~0.1) FRET S protein conformation more efficiently (Fig. S4, B and C),
suggesting that the observed low-FRET state likely represents the receptor-bound state in which
all three RBD domains are oriented upwards (RBD-up conformation).

15

A unique strength of single-molecule imaging is its capacity to reveal directly both the structural
and kinetic features that define biological function(27, 28). To extract such information for the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we employed Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM)(29) to idealize
individual smFRET traces. These data allowed quantitative analyses of the thousands of discrete
FRET transitions observed for the S protein on the surface of lentiviral and S-MEN particles in

20

the absence and presence of ligands to gain insights into the order and timing of conformational
changes across conditions (Figs. 2, B, C, F, G, and Fig. S4). Transition density plots (TDPs),
which conveniently display the nature, order and frequency of the transitions observed in the
ensemble of molecules examined(27), immediately revealed two salient features that informed

on the nature of S protein dynamics. First, the symmetry of the evidenced transitions in each
TDP with respect to the diagonal axis indicated that the unliganded S protein is in equilibrium
exchange between distinct conformations under ambient conditions - i.e. physiological buffer at
room temperature. Second, the transitions evidenced in the TDP exhibited a defined transition
5

order, from low- to intermediate- FRET and from intermediate- to high-FRET conformations.
These findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein exhibits a defined sequence of activating
structural transitions wherein the ground state RBD-down conformation (intermediate- (~0.5)
FRET) converts to the receptor-activated RBD-up conformation (low- (~0.1) FRET) via at least
one intermediate- (~0.3) FRET conformation. They further reveal that the RBD-down

10

conformation of the S protein can reversibly access at least one additional high- (~0.8) FRET
conformation. The most frequent transitions evidenced were those between RBD down (~0.5
FRET) and the on-path intermediate- (~0.3) FRET states, from which relatively infrequent
transitions to the low-FRET (~0.1), RBD-up conformation - akin to those observed upon
hACE2-binding – could be achieved spontaneously.

15

As expected, the binding of the hACE2 receptor modified the dynamic S protein conformational
landscape towards the RBD-up conformation (~0.1 FRET), rendering it the most populated (Fig.
2, B, C, F, G). This change resulted from an increase in the transition rate from the RBD-down
conformation (~0.5 FRET) towards the intermediate- (~0.3) FRET state and subsequently the
20

RBD-up (~0.1 FRET) conformation, which was also modestly stabilized. The energy barriers for
reverse transitions towards the RBD-down conformation (~0.5 FRET), were also elevated,
explaining receptor-bound conformation accumulation over time (Figs. S5). These analyses lead
to a qualitative model for hACE2 activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from the ground state

to the receptor-bound state through at least one intermediate conformation (Fig. 2H). The
summary of relative state occupancies, transition rates among conformations and errors are listed
in Tables S1 and S2, respectively.

5

In most cell types, the serine protease TMPRSS2 is required for pH-independent SARS-CoV-2
entry(5, 30, 31). In vitro, the effect of TMPRSS2 is mimicked by the serine protease trypsin,
which has similar cleavage specificity(5, 31). smFRET analysis of trypsin-treated S protein on
lentiviral particles in the absence of receptor revealed a clear shift towards activation (Fig. 3, A,
B). After trypsin treatment, the addition of hACE2 receptor was more effective at stabilizing the

10

S protein in the RBD-up (~0.1 FRET) conformation (Fig. 3, C and D, Fig. S6). To further
validate this finding, we measured the effects of trypsin pre-treatment in virus-cell and cell-cell
fusion assays using split NanoLuc system consisting of LgBiT and HiBiT (Fig. 3, E and F, Fig.
S7). Here, membrane fusion restored luciferase activity between lentiviral particles carrying the
S protein as well as a Vpr-HiBiT fusion protein with cells expressing the LgBiT counterpart

15

fused to a PH domain. This assay revealed fusion to be strictly dependent on the hACE2 receptor
and to be stimulated by trypsin treatment (Fig. 3, E and F). Nearly identical results were
observed for cell-cell fusion between donor cells expressing S and target cells expressing hACE2
(Fig. S7), confirming the activating role of trypsin treatment.

20

We next explored the suitability of the smFRET assay to characterize the conformational
consequences of antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Multiple studies on antibodies
generated from COVID-19 patients have shown that one type of antibody often dominates
immune responses(32-37). This prompted us to screen plasma from convalescent patients with

neutralizing activity that can bind to the S protein on lentiviral particles(38) using a modified
virus-capture assay (VCA)(39). Cross-reactive CR3022(40), one of the very first reported
antibodies from SARS-CoV-1 that also bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain, served as a
good indicator of RBD binding (Fig. 4A). We identified two plasma samples (S002 and S006)
5

able to specifically bind the RBD, recognize S expressed at the cell surface and to neutralize
viral particles (Fig. 4, A to C, and Fig. S8). smFRET analysis of antibody-bound S revealed that
both CR3022 and plasma from patient S006, stabilized S in the RBD-up (~0.1 FRET)
conformation, in a similar fashion as receptor hACE2 (Fig. 4, D and E). These data point to the
presence of RBD-directed antibodies in patient S006. By contrast, smFRET indicated that

10

plasma from patient S002 contained an activity that stabilized the RBD-down (~0.5 FRET)
conformation (Fig. 4F). Plasma S002 antagonized hACE2 binding, but RBD competition did not
affect its recognition of S, suggesting that its neutralization activity does not solely rely on
blocking the receptor interface We then assessed the conformational preference of four RBDdirected antibodies: the potently neutralizing antibodies H4, 2-4 and 2-43, and the neutralization

15

nanobody VHH72, each of which binds RBD in a different way(41-43). Antibody H4 and
nanobody VHH72 stabilized the S protein in an RBD-up (~0.1 FRET) conformation similar to
hACE2, CR3022, and S006, whereas antibody 2-4 shifted the conformational landscape towards
RBD-down (~0.5 FRET) conformation, similar to S002 (Fig. 4, G to J). The very potent
neutralizing antibody 2-43(43), meanwhile, showed a partial shift to the RBD-up (~0.1 FRET)

20

conformation (Fig. S9). The absence or presence of hACE2 did not appear to affect the RBD-up
stabilization evidenced for antibodies CR3022, S006, VHH72, or H4 (Fig. S9). However, plasma
S002, and to a lesser extent antibody 2-4, reduced the hACE2-dependent stabilization of the
RBD-up (~0.1 FRET) conformation, suggesting that they may interfere with hACE2 receptor

binding via an allosteric mechanism. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 neutralization
can be achieved in two ways: 1) antibodies that conformationally mimic hACE2 and directly
compete with hACE2 receptor binding, or 2) by allosterically stabilizing the S protein in its
RBD-down conformation.
5

The strength of the presented smFRET approach is revealed by the capacity to examine the
dynamic properties of the S protein in real time, including: 1) the distinct conformational states
that it spontaneously transits under physiological conditions; 2) the impact of sequence
alterations on S protein dynamics; and 3) the responses of the S protein to cognate hACE2
10

receptor and antibody recognition.

The present analyses of dynamic S protein molecules provides three lines of evidence that
indicate that the intermediate- (~0.5) FRET state observed represents the RBD-down, ground
state conformation of the S protein, in which all three RBD domains are oriented towards the
15

viral particle membrane. First, in line with previous electron microscopy (EM) investigations(616), the RBD-down state is the most populated. In further agreement with recent EM studies,
both the disulfide bridge (S383C, D985C)(9, 11) and antibody 2-4 stabilized the S protein in a
conformation with all three RBD oriented down42. While our smFRET observations highlight
considerable conformational flexibility in these contexts compared to EM of soluble trimers, we

20

attribute these distinctions to a tendency of our analysis approach to over-emphasize dynamic
features, while EM may over-emphasize static conformations rigidified by cryogenic
temperatures that may be more readily identified and classified(44). Multiple lines of evidence
also facilitated assignment of the RBD-up (~0.1 FRET) conformation of the S protein with all

three RBD domains oriented away from the virus particle membrane. For instance, this
conformation was stabilized by soluble monomeric hACE2 receptor, and even further stabilized
in the presence of soluble, dimeric hACE2 receptor as well as RBD-targeting antibodies, such as
CR3022, that are known to access their epitopes when the S protein is in an activated, RBD-up
5

conformation(40-42). The structure of the on-path (~0.3 FRET) intermediate observed during S1
opening is likely similar to the all-down ground state; cryo-EM structures of soluble SARS-CoV2 S trimers(17) that engage one or two hACE2 molecules receptors(18) reveal that the distance
between the two labeling sites increases in the ligand-free protomers adjacent to a protomer
engaged to hACE2 (Fig. S1A). The additional, highly compacted S conformation (~0.8 FRET)

10

evidenced, which is also depopulated by activating ligands, remains unknown.

These smFRET analyses are in global agreement with the conformational states observed at the
single particle EM and cryoET level(6, 8, 9, 11-17, 40-42, 45, 46). The observed FRET changes
are also are in good agreement with expected increase in the distance between the labeling
15

peptide insertion sites that carry the fluorophores in the RBD-down and RBD-up conformations
of the S trimer. The capacity to examine the conformational preferences of RBD-directed
antibodies to the S protein enabled us to identify conformational signatures of antibodies in
patient plasma. This approach identified patients with antibody activities that either mimicked
ACE2 (indicating anti-RBD activity) or stabilized the ground state of S, thereby interfering with

20

hACE2 receptor-mediated activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We anticipate that ground
state stabilization by antibodies, small molecules, or the rational engineering of trimers may
represent an effective avenue of antagonism as well as immunogen design.

Materials and Methods
Construction of full-length tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
A full-length wild-type pCMV3-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1+S2)-long (termed as pCMV-S,
codon-optimized, Sino Biological, cat # VG40589-UT) plasmid was used as a template to
5

generate tagged pCMV-S. The translated amino acid sequence of pCMV-S is identical to
QHD43416.1 (GenBank). Labeling tags Q3 (GQQQLG) and A4 (DSLDMLEM)(48, 49) were
placed before and after the receptor-binding motif (RBM) where the cellular receptor ACE binds
(Fig. S1). The short peptide labeling tag Q3 was inserted at either of two positions in the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) to generate the pCMV-S Q3-1 and Q3-2 constructs. The

10

labeling tag A4 was inserted at either of two sites in subunit domain 1 (SD1) to generate the
constructs pCMV-S A4-1 and A4-2, respectively. Insertion of single tags into S proteins did not
affect viral infectivity. Four different combinations of double-tagged S (designated as pCMV-S
Q3-1 A4-1, Q3-1 A4-2, Q3-2 A4-1, Q3-2 A4-2) were constructed to permit smFRET imaging.
Each pair of inserted tags did not compromise S-dependent lentivirus infectivity.

15

Infectivity measurements
The infectivity of lentivirus particles carrying SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins was
determined using a vector containing an HIV-1 or MLV long terminal repeat (LTR) that
expresses a Gaussia luciferase reporter (Gluc)(50, 51) 293T cells were cultured in DMEM
20

(Gibco) media, supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco),
2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), and in the presence of 5% CO2. Cell culture media was exchanged
before transfection. Cells were transfected at 60–80 % confluency with the plasmid encoding
respective spike protein, the plasmid encoding an intron-regulated Gluc (HIV-1-inGluc), and a

plasmid pCMV delta R8.2 encoding HIV-1 GagPol (Addgene, plasmid #12263) using Fugene 6
(Promega, # E2311). Variants of plasmids encoding spike included the wild-type pCMV-S,
single or dually tagged pCMV-S, pCMV-S Δ19 (S lacking the last 19 amino acids of the
cytoplasmic tail), and an additional S Δ19 expressing plasmid (a gift from Mark Johnson,
5

University of Missouri). To generate retroviral particles with an MLV core carrying full-length S,
an MLV GagPol construct, and an intron-regulated Gaussia luciferase reporter construct (MLVinGluc) were used(50). An HIV-1 GagPol-InGluc construct(52) (a gift from Mark Johnson,
University of Missouri) in which HIV-1 GagPol and HIV-1-inGluc genes are expressed from a
single plasmid were also tested. Viruses were harvested 40 hours post-transfection, filtered, and

10

concentrated 7-fold by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor for 2 hours at 4 °C.
Pelleted viruses were resuspended in above DMEM media and titered on Huh7.5 cells that
endogenously express hACE2. Gluc activity was measured in the cell supernatant at 48 hours
using a PierceTM Gaussia Luciferase Flash Assay Kits (ThermoFisher Scientific, # 16158).

15

Soluble human ACE2 (hACE2) inhibition assay
NanoLuc-expressing SARS-CoV-2 decorated lentiviruses were first generated by
transfecting a plasmid mixture containing 5 µg of pCMV-S, 5 µg of pCMV delta R8.2 (expresses
HIV-1 GagPol), 2 µg of pLL3.7 NanoLuc (packaging reporter to express NanoLuc) into 60-70 %
HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 (3ul of FuGENE 6 for every µg of DNA) in a 10 cm TC dish.

20

The culture supernatants were harvested at 48 h after transfection, clarified using 0.45 µm filter,
and viruses partially purified by sedimentation through a layer of 15 % sucrose solution made in
1X PBS. The virus pellet was resuspended in OptiMEM to achieve a 20-fold concentration over
original culture volume. Infectivity inhibition assays were performed by incubating NanoLuc

expressing lentiviruses either alone or with soluble hACE2 (monomeric and dimeric) at indicated
concentrations in triplicates for 90 mins at room temperature prior to infection of the 293T cells
stably expressing hACE2 seeded in a tissue-culture treated 96-well solid white assay plate
(Costar Inc, catalog #3917). The culture supernatants were completely removed 24 h p.i. and
5

cells lysed using 50 µl NanoLuc assay buffer. Luciferase activity was then measured using
Tristar multiwell luminometer (Berthold Technology, Bad Wildbad, Germany) for 2.5 seconds
by adding 20 µl of Nano-Glo® substrate (Promega Inc, WI, USA; diluted 1:40 in NanoLuc assay
buffer). HEK293T cells (not expressing hACE2) infected similarly served as controls to
determine basal luciferase activity for obtaining normalized relative light units in infected

10

samples. Infectivity obtained in mock-treated samples were set to 100 %. The data were
processed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 8 v8.4.3.

Preparations of convalescent plasma from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients
All SARS-CoV-2-postive patient serum work was conducted in accordance with the
15

Declaration of Helsinki in terms of informed consent and approval by an appropriate institutional
board (CHUM, 19.381). The donors met all donor eligibility criteria: previous confirmed
COVID-19 infection by PCR and complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days.
Donor S002: Male, 65 years old, sample recovered 25 days after symptoms onset.
Donor S006: Male, 30 years old, sample recovered 41 days after symptoms onset.

Antibody neutralization assays
In the case of VSVG, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 parallel neutralization assay (Fig.
4C, and Fig. S8C), experiments were performed as follows. Target cells were infected with

single-round luciferase-expressing lentiviral particles. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected by the
calcium phosphate method with the pNL4.3 R-E- Luc plasmid (NIH AIDS Reagent Program)
and a plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike, SARS-CoV Spike or VSV-G at a ratio of 5:4.
Two days post-transfection, cell supernatants were harvested and stored at –80 °C until use.
5

293T-ACE2(53) target cells were seeded at a density of 1×104 cells/well in 96-well
luminometer-compatible tissue culture plates (Perkin Elmer) 24 hours before infection.
Recombinant viruses in a final volume of 100 µl were incubated with the indicated sera dilutions
(1/50; 1/250; 1/1250; 1/6250; 1/31250) for 1hours at 37°C and were then added to the target cells
followed by incubation for 48 hours at 37°C; cells were lysed by the addition of 30 µl of passive

10

lysis buffer (Promega) followed by one freeze-thaw cycle. An LB941 TriStar luminometer
(Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the luciferase activity of each well after the
addition of 100 µl of luciferin buffer (15 mM MgSO4, 15 mM KH2PO4 [pH 7.8], 1 mM ATP,
and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and 50 µl of 1 mM d-luciferin potassium salt (Prolume). The
neutralization half-maximal inhibitory dilution (ID50) represents the plasma dilution to inhibit 50

15

% of the infection of 293T-ACE2 cells by recombinant viruses bearing the indicated surface
glycoproteins. The plasmids expressing the human coronavirus Spikes of SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV, NL63 229E and OC43 were previously described(38, 53). The pNL4.3 R-E- Luc was
obtained from NIH AIDS Reagent Program. The plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD was
reported elsewhere(53). The vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-encoding plasmid (pSVCMV-

20

IN-VSV-G) was previously described(53).

Virus-cell fusion assays
We used the split nanoluc assay to monitor virus-cell fusion(47). For the preparation of
Vpr-HiBiT–containing SARS CoV-2 decorated lentiviruses, a plasmid mixture containing 4 µg
of pCMV-S, 4 µg of psPAX2 (Gag-pol, Rev, and Tat expression vector; does not express Vpr), 2
5

µg of pLL3.7 (packaging reporter to express GFP), and 2 µg of pCMV-Vpr-HiBiT (Vpr-HiBiT
expression vector)) was transfected into 60-70 % HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 (3ul of
FuGENE 6 for 1µg of DNA). The culture supernatants were harvested at 48 hours after
transfection, clarified using 0.45 µm filter, and viruses partially purified by sedimentation
through a layer of 15 % sucrose solution made in 1X PBS. The virus pellet was resuspended in

10

OptiMEM to achieve a 20-fold concentration over original culture volume. Virus preparations
were mock-treated or treated with trypsin (50 and 150 µg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. Neat serum at
a final concentration of 10 % was added to terminate both trypsin and mock-treated samples. 2.5
× 105 HEK293 cells in 24-wells were transfected with 400 ng of hACE2-expressing plasmid or
pcDNA3.1 vector along with 100 ng PH-LgBiT (LgBiT-tagged to pleckstrin homology domain

15

of human phospholipase Cδ at the N-terminus) expressing plasmid using FuGENE 6 for use as
target cells. 24 hours post-transfection, 2 x 105 cells were seeded in tissue-culture treated 96-well
solid white assay plate (Costar Inc, #3917) in 100 µl RPMI complete medium. They were
infected with 25 µl of prepared Vpr-HiBiT-containing viruses in quadruplicates for 24 hours at
37 °C. Light signals derived from reconstituted HiBiT/LgBiT association were measured using

20

Tristar multiwell luminometer (Berthold Technology, Bad Wildbad, Germany) for 2.5 seconds
by adding 20 µl of Nano-Glo® substrate (Promega Inc, WI, USA; diluted 1:40 in PBS). Mockinfected cells served as controls to determine basal luciferase activity for obtaining normalized

Prism 8 v8.4.3.

Cell-cell fusion assays
5

2.5 × 105 HEK293 cells seeded per well of 24-well plate were transfected with 400 ng of
hACE2 and 100 ng PH-LgBiT expressing plasmid(47) using FuGENE 6 (3 ul of FuGENE 6 for
1 µg of DNA). The second set of HEK293 cells for co-culture were transfected with 400 ng of
SARS CoV-2 spike-expressing plasmid or pcDNA 3.1 vector along with 100 ng of vpr-HiBiT
(HiBiT tagged to HIV-1 Vpr at the N- terminus) expressing plasmid. 24 hours later, HEK293

10

cells expressing Vpr-HiBiT alone or co-expressing spike and Vpr-HiBiT were either untreated or
treated with 50 µg/ml trypsin solution for 10 min at 37 °C. Trypsin was neutralized by adding
serum-containing medium and cells washed once before resuspending in complete RPMI
medium. 1 x 105 cells from various Vpr-HiBiT and PH-LgBiT expressing populations were
mixed (1:1 ratio, 50 µl each population) in tissue culture treated 96-well solid white assay plate

15

(Costar Inc, catalog #3917) in quadruplicates. Membrane fusion was initiated by spinning down
the mixed cells in a 96-well plate (1600 rpm for 5 min, swing-out buckets, Heraeus, Sorvall
centrifuge). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in tissue culture incubator for 4 hours or 24
hours before measuring reconstituted HiBiT/LgBiT activity using a Tristar multiwell
Luminometer (Berthold Technology, Bad Wildbad, Germany) for 2.5 seconds by adding 20 µl of

20

Nano-Glo® substrate (Promega Inc, WI, USA; diluted 1:40 in PBS). Individual unmixed
populations of cells were treated identically and served as controls to determine basal luciferase
activity to obtain normalized relative light units. The data were processed and plotted using
GraphPad Prism 8 v8.4.3.

Preparation of lentivirus particles carrying SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins for smFRET imaging
Lentiviruses carrying SARS-CoV-2 spikes were prepared similarly as previously
described for HIV-1(19-21, 54). Two short peptides labeling tags (Q3: GQQQLG; A4:
DSLDMLEM), either single or in pair-wise combinations were introduced into indicated
5

positions in the S1 subunit on the plasmid pCMV-S (see Fig. S1). Viruses carrying 100 % singletagged or double-tagged pCMV-S showed no noticeable defect in virus infectivity. The spike
carrying one pair-wise combination of peptide tags (designated as pCMV-S Q3-1 A4-1) was
used to make lentiviruses or S-MEN coronavirus like particles with SARS-CoV-2 spikes
incorporated in the virus surface.

10

Lentivirus particles carrying SARS-CoV-2 spikes were produced by pseudotying an HIV1 core with full-length spike proteins. To generate lentivirus particles that carry only one double
tagged S on average among all the S trimers on the virus surface, plasmids encoding wildtype
pCMV-S, pCMV-S Q3-1 A4-1, and pCMV delta R8.2 were transfected at a ratio of 20:1:21,
respectively. Under these conditions, the vast majority of virus particles carry wildtype spikes.

15

Among the small portion of virus particles containing tagged S, more than 95 % will carry one
dually tagged protomer while the other two protomers remain wildtype. The same strategy has
been deployed in our previous studies(19-21, 54). 293T cells were transfected using Fugene 6
with above indicated plasmids to express spikes on the HIV-1. When virus particles were
generated that contained the disulfide bridge between S383C and D985C S, both plasmids, the

20

plasmid encoding the spike protein, as well as plasmids encoding the dually tagged spike protein
contained the S383C and D985C modification. To generate S-MEN particles, plasmids encoding
wildtype pCMV-S, dual-tagged pCMV-S Q3-1 A4-1, pLVX-M (SARS-CoV-2 membrane
protein expressing plasmid), an pLVX-E (SARS-CoV-2 envelope expressing plasmid, and

pLVX-N (SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid expressing plasmid) were transfected at a ratio of
20:1:21:21:21. pLVX plasmids are gifts from Nevan Krogan, UCSF.
Lentivirus or S-MEN particles carrying dually-tagged S proteins were harvested 40 hour
post-transfection, filtered through syringe filter with 0.45 mm pore size, and sedimented through
5

a 15 % sucrose cushion at 25,000 rpm for 2 hours. The virus pellets were then re-suspended in 50
mM pH 7.5 HEPES buffer supplied with 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2.
Cryo-electron tomography
6 nm gold tracer was added to the concentrated S-decorated HIV-1 lentivirus and S-MEN
particles viruses at 1:3 ratio, and 5 µl of the mixture was placed onto freshly glow discharged

10

holey carbon grids for 1 min. Grids were blotted with filter paper, and rapidly frozen in liquid
ethane using a homemade gravity-driven plunger apparatus.
Cryo-grids were imaged on a cryo-transmission electron microscope (Titan Krios,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) that was operated at 300 kV, using a Gatan K3 direct electron detector
in counting mode with a 20 eV energy slit. Tomographic tilt series between −51° and +51° were

15

collected by using SerialEM(55) in a dose-symmetric scheme(56) with increments of 3°. The
nominal magnification was 64,000 X, giving a pixel size of 1.346 Å on the specimen. The raw
images were collected from single-axis tilt series with accumulative dose of ~50 e− per Å2. The
defocus was -3 µm and 8 frames were saved for each tilt angle.
Frames were motion-corrected using Motioncorr2(57) to generate drift-corrected stack files,

20

which were aligned using gold fiducial makers by IMOD/etomo(58). Tomograms were
reconstructed by weighted back projection and tomographic slices were visualized with IMOD.

Fluorescently labeling spikes embedded on lentivirus particles
Virus particles were labeled through site-specifically enzymatic labeling, as previously
described(19, 21). Transglutaminase transferred Cy3B(3S) from the cadaverine conjugate to the
central glutamine residue of the Q3 (GQQQLG) tag in S1. The AcpS enzyme mediated the
5

addition of the Cy5 derivative (LD650-CoA) to the serine residue of the A4 tag (DSLDMLEM).
For these reactions to occur, Cy3B(3S)-cadaverine (0.5 mM, Lumidyne Technologies), LD650CoA (0.5 mM, Lumidyne Technologies), transglutaminase (0.65 mM, Sigma Aldrich), and AcpS
(5 mM, home-made) were added to the above suspensions of viruses. The labeling reaction mix
was incubated at room temperature overnight. PEG2000-biotin (0.02 mg/ml, Avanti Polar Lipids)

10

was added to the reaction mix and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. Free
dyes and lipids were then purified away from labeled virus particles by ultracentrifugation for
one hour at 4 °C at 40,000 rpm over a 6%-18% Optiprep (Sigma Aldrich) gradient. Purified virus
particles were stored at -80 °C for future use in smFRET imaging.

15

smFRET imaging data acquisition
All smFRET imaging data acquisition was performed on a home-built prism-based total
internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. Lentiviruses or S-MEN coronavirus-like
particles carrying fluorescently-tagged spike protein, as well as lipid-biotin in the viral
membranes, were immobilized on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-passivated, streptavidin-coated

quartz slides for imaging. The evanescent field was generated at the interface between the quartz
slide and the virus sample solution by prism-based total internal reflection, with laser excitation
from a single-frequency 532-nm laser. Donor fluorophores labeled on viruses were directly
excited by the generated evanescent field. Fluorescence signals from both donor and acceptor

fluorophores were collected through a 1.27-NA 60 x water-immersion objective (Nikon).
Collected signals were optically separated by passing through a 650 DCXR dichroic filter
(Chroma) mounted on MultiCam LS image splitter (Cairn Research). Separated donor
(ET590/50, Chroma) and acceptor fluorescent (ET690/50, Chroma) signals were simultaneously
5

recorded on two synchronized ORCA-Flash4.0 V3 sCMOS cameras (Hamamatsu) at 25 frames
per second for 80 seconds. Unless otherwise noted, all virus samples were imaged in pH 7.4, 50
mM Tris buffer with 50 mM NaCl, a cocktail of triplet-state quenchers, and an oxygen-scavenger
system(59).
Where indicated, the conformational effects of different ligands/antibodies/plasma on

10

SARS-CoV-2 spike were tested by pre-incubating fluorescently labeled viruses for 90 mins at
room temperature before imaging in the continued presence of the ligands. In experiments with
two different ligands presented, the second ligand (hACE2) was added to first-ligand-bound
viruses and incubated similarly. The specific concentration of ligands incubated with viruses in
smFRET imaging are as follows: 200 mg/ml hACE2 (human hACE2); 200 mg/ml dimeric

15

hACE2, 50 mg/ml trypsin; 200 mg/ml CR3022; 200 mg/ml VHH72; 200 mg/ml H4; 100 fold
dilution of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient plasma.

smFRET data analysis
smFRET data analysis was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks)-based customized
20

SPARTAN software package(60). For each labeled virus recorded over 80 seconds, the
background signal at the single-molecule level was first identified based on the fluorophore
bleaching point and subtracted. Donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity time-trajectory or
traces were then extracted for each recorded virus and corrected for donor to acceptor crosstalk.

The energy transfer efficiency (termed as FRET in graphs) from the donor to the neighboring
acceptor was evaluated as FRET= IA/(γID+IA), where ID and IA are the fluorescence intensities of
donor and acceptor, respectively, and γ is the correlation coefficient compensating for the
difference in quantum yields and detection efficiencies of donor and acceptor.
5

FRET efficiencies of each FRET pair report on the relative distance between the donor
and the acceptor over time and ultimately reveal the conformational dynamics of host molecules
(spikes on the virus in our case) in real-time. Viruses lacking donor or acceptor fluorophores,
containing multiple labeled protomers, or containing more than one labeled spike on a single
virus were automatically excluded from further analysis. FRET traces (FRET values as a

10

function of real-time) were then manually selected if they displayed sufficient signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio and anti-correlated fluctuations in donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity between
clearly defined FRET states, which are indicative of fully active molecules. These traces were
compiled into FRET histograms. Based on visual inspection of traces that revealed direct
observations of state-to-state transitions, FRET histograms were fitted into the sum of four

15

Gaussian distributions using the least-squares fitting algorithm in Matlab. Each gaussian
represents one FRET-indicated conformational state, and the area under each Gaussian curve
estimates each state's occupancy. The occupancy of each state was used to evaluate the
difference in free energies between states i and j, according to ΔG°ij=-kBTln(Pi/Pj),
where Pi and Pj are the ith and jth state’s occupancy, respectively, kB is the Boltzmann constant,

20

and T is the temperature in kelvin.
The idealization of each FRET trace using a 4-state Hidden Markov Model was
performed in the SPARTAN software package using a segmental K-means algorithm(29). The
state-to-state transition tracing, indicative of the locations and the frequencies of transitions, was

displayed in a transition density plot (termed as TDP). Dwell times (the time during which a
molecule occupies one specific conformation before transitioning to any other conformations)
distributions were compiled into survival probability plots and were fitted to the sum of two
exponential distributions (y = A1 exp –k1t + A2 exp –k2t). The transition rates were weighted from
5

averaging the two rate constants by their amplitudes.

Virus capture assay
The assay was modified from a previous published method(39). Briefly, pseudoviral
particles were produced by transfecting 2×106 HEK293T cells with pNL4.3 Luc R-E- (3.5 µg),
10

plasmids(38, 53) encoding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike or SARS-CoV Spike (3.5 µg) protein and
VSV-G (pSVCMV-IN-VSV-G, 1 µg) using the standard calcium phosphate protocol. Forty-eight
hours later, supernatant-containing virion was collected and cell debris was removed through
centrifugation (1,500 rpm for 10 min). To immobilize antibodies on ELISA plates, white
MaxiSorp ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were incubated with 5 µg/ml of antibodies or

15

1:500 diluted plasma in 100 µl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 oC. Unbound
antibodies or plasma were removed by washing the plates twice with PBS. Plates were
subsequently blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature. After two washes with PBS, 200 µl of virus-containing supernatant was added to
the wells. For sACE2 competition, 10 µM sACE2 was incubated with the supernatant at 37 oC

20

for 1 hour before adding to the coated wells. After 4 to 6 hours incubation, supernatant was
removed and the wells were washed with PBS 3 times. Viral capture by any given antibody was
visualized by adding 10×104 SARS-CoV-2-resistant Cf2Th cells (not shown) in full DMEM
medium per well. Forty-eight hours post-infection, cells were lysed by the addition of 30 µl of

passive lysis buffer (Promega) and three freeze-thaw cycles. An LB941 TriStar luminometer
(Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the luciferase activity of each well after the
addition of 100 µl of luciferin buffer (15 mM MgSO4, 15 mM KH2PO4 [pH 7.8], 1 mM ATP,
and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and 50 µl of 1 mM D-luciferin potassium salt (Prolume).

Flow cytometry analysis of cell-surface staining
Using the standard calcium phosphate method, 10 µg of Spike expressor and 2 µg of a
green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressor (pIRES-GFP) was transfected into 2 × 106 293T cells.
At 48 hours post transfection, 293T cells were stained with plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected
10

or uninfected individuals (1:250 dilution). The percentage of transfected cells (GFP+ cells) was
determined by gating the living cell population based on the basis of viability dye staining (Aqua
Vivid, Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on a LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mississauga,
ON, Canada) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo vX.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR,
USA). Alternatively, convalescent plasma was incubated with 20 µg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

15

prior cell-surface staining in order to compete for RBD-specific antibodies.

ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD ELISA assay used was recently described(38, 53). Briefly,
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S RBD proteins (2.5 µg/ml), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (2.5
20

µg/ml) as a negative control, were prepared in PBS and were adsorbed to plates (MaxiSorp;
Nunc) overnight at 4 °C. Coated wells were subsequently blocked with blocking buffer (Trisbuffered saline [TBS] containing 0.1% Tween20 and 2% BSA) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Wells were then washed four times with washing buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing

0.1% Tween20). CR3022 mAb (50 ng/ml) or serial dilutions of plasma from SARS-CoV-2infected or uninfected donors (1/100; 1/250; 1/500; 1/1000; 1/2000; 1/4000) were prepared in a
diluted solution of blocking buffer (0.1 % BSA) and incubated with the RBD-coated wells for 90
minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed four times with washing buffer followed by
5

incubation with anti-IgG secondary Abs (diluted in a diluted solution of blocking buffer [0.4%
BSA]) for 1hour at room temperature, followed by four washes. HRP enzyme activity was
determined after the addition of a 1:1 mix of Western Lightning oxidizing and luminol reagents
(Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Light emission was measured with a LB941 TriStar luminometer
(Berthold Technologies). Signal obtained with BSA was subtracted for each plasma and was then

10

normalized to the signal obtained with CR3022 mAb present in each plate.

Fig. 1. Experimental design for single-molecule FRET imaging of real-time conformational
dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on virus particles. (A, B) Experimental set-up.
(A) Virus particles carrying a two-dye labeled SARS-CoV-2 spike protein protomer among
wildtype spikes were immobilized on a quartz slide and imaged on a customized prism-based
TIRF microscope. Two virus particle systems were developed to incorporate SARS-CoV-2 spike
proteins on their surfaces. HIV-1 lentivirus particles comprise HIV-1 cores and SARS-CoV-2
spike proteins on the surface. S-MEN virus-like particles consist of four structural proteins, in
which S represents spike, M the membrane protein, E the envelope protein, and N the
nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. (B) Placement of labeling tags for the site-directed
introduction of fluorophores (Cy3B, green; LD650, red) was guided by conformational changes
in S1 induced by binding of the cellular receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(hACE2) from the “RBD-down” to the “RBD-up” conformation (Fig. S1). RBD, receptorbinding domain; NTD, N-terminal domain. Structures were adapted from RCSB Protein Data

traces compiled into a conformation-population FRET histogram (gray lines) and fitted into a 4state Gaussian distribution (solid black) centered at 0.1-FRET (dashed cyan), 0.3-FRET (dashed
red), 0.5-FRET (dashed green), and 0.8-FRET (dashed magenta). TDPs, displayed as initial
FRET vs. final FRET with relative frequencies, trace the locations of state-to-state transitions
and their relative frequencies (max red scale = 0.01 transitions/second), originated from the
idealization of individual FRET traces in FRET histograms. (D) A modified spike (S383C and
D985C)(9, 11) stabilized in ‘RBD-down’ conformation, observed from the FRET histogram
(upper panel). The small increase in the population of the ground state (~0.5 FRET) likely
reflects the partial nature of the formation of the disulfide in this mutant, which has 40% the
infectivity of wildtype (Fig. S3C). Modified S383C and D985C depicted in the high-resolution
structure of S 6ZOY (lower panel). (E–G), Experiments as in A–C, respectively, conducted in
the presence of 200 µg/ml monomeric hACE2. The soluble hACE2 activates spike proteins on
the virus by shaping the conformational landscape towards stabilizing the ‘RBD-up’
conformation (activated-state). FRET histograms represent mean ± s.e.m., determined from three
randomly assigned populations of all FRET traces under corresponding experimental conditions.
N, number of individual FRET traces. Evaluated state occupancies see Table S1. (H) Relative

relative state occupancies of each state.

Fig. S2. Establishment of infectivity assays using lentivirus and retrovirus particles
carrying SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. (A) HIV-1 or MLV single-round viruses used for
infectivity and neutralization assays were generated by transfecting HEK293T cells with
plasmids expressing respective GagPol, LTR-intron Gaussia luciferase Gluc(50, 51) or plasmid
encoding HIV-1 envelope-deleted genome encoding intron Gluc together with codon-optimized,
non-codon-optimized or Δ19 (spike with 19 amino acids deleted from C-terminal) versions of
SARS-CoV-2 spike(52). (B) Graphs comparing infectivity of indicated viruses titered on Huh
7.5 measured as a function of Gaussia luciferase activity (relative light units, RLU; mean ± s.d.)
48 h after infection from 7-fold concentrated or neat culture supernatants (C). Viral infectivity
assays were carried out three independent times in triplicates.

(A) Dimeric hACE2 is more potent than monomeric hACE2. Infectivity of lentivirus particles
carrying SARS-CoV-2 Spike in presence of indicated amounts of soluble monomeric or dimeric
hACE2 protein using 293T cells stably expressing hACE2 as target cells. Experiment was
performed in triplicates and represented as mean ± s.d. (B, C) The FRET histogram (B) and the
corresponding transition density plot (C) of spikes on lentivirus particles in the presence of 200
µg/ml dimeric hACE2. 206 (Nm) individual dynamic traces were compiled into a conformationpopulation FRET histogram (gray lines, B) and fitted into a 4-state Gaussian distribution (solid
black, B). Compared to monomeric hACE2, dimeric hACE2 further reduces the occupancy of
the very high-FRET and facilitates the stabilization in the low-FRET receptor-stabilized state (C).
FRET histograms represent mean ± s.e.m., determined from three randomly-assigned
populations of all FRET traces. Evaluated state occupancies see Table S1.

Assay design to monitor cell-cell fusion using the HiBit and LgBiT split nanoluc system(47).
HEK293 cells transiently expressing Vpr-HiBit with or without SARS-CoV-2 spike were cocultured with HEK293 cells transiently expressing LgBiT tagged to PH domain of human
phospholipase Cδ at the N-terminus together with hACE2. SARS-CoV-2 spike-hACE2dependent cell-cell fusion was determined by monitoring reconstituted nanoluc activity at 4 and
24 h post co-culture. (B) Normalized relative luciferase units (RLU; bars denote mean; dots,
individual data points of replicates) measured at 4 h and 24 h post co-culture to quantify cell-cell
fusion in stated cell populations. Indicated cell populations were either left alone or treated with
50 µg/ml trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C before co-culture. Reconstituted NanoLuc activities were
normalized to luciferase activity detected in cell populations without co-culture. p values were

Table S1. Relative state-occupancy and fitting parameters in each of four FRET-defined
conformational states of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of virus particles. The
FRET efficiency histograms were fitted into the sum of four Gaussian distributions (µ, the mean
or expectation of the Gaussian distribution; σ, s.d. of the Gaussian distribution) for each
conformational state. Parameters were based upon the observation of original FRET efficiency
data and were further determined using hidden Markov modelling. Relative conformational stateoccupancy of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on viral particles are presented as mean ± s.e.m.,
determined from three independent measurements. R-squared values were evaluated to indicate
the goodness of fit.

Table S2. Transition rates between observed conformational states of SARS-CoV-2 spike
on virus particles. The survival probability plots (Figs. S5 and S6) were derived from
distributions of dwell times for each state-to-state transitions determined through Hidden Markov
Modeling (HMM). Then plots were fitted by double-exponential distributions: y(t) = A1 exp –
