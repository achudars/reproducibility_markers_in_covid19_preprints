Abstract
We describe our efforts at developing a one-step quantitative reverse-transcription
(qRT)-PCR protocol to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) RNA directly from saliva samples, without RNA purification. We find that both
heat and the presence of saliva impairs the ability to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Buffer composition (for saliva dilution) was also crucial to effective PCR detection. Using the
SG2 primer pair, designed by Sigma-Aldrich, we were able to detect the equivalent of
1.7×10​6​ viral copies per mL of saliva after heat inactivation; approximately equivalent to the
median viral load in symptomatic patients. This would make our assay potentially useful for
rapid detection of high-shedding infected individuals. We also provide a comparison of the
PCR efficiency and specificity, which varied considerably, across 9 reported primer pairs for
SARS-CoV-2 detection. Primer pairs SG2 and CCDC-N showed highest specificity and PCR
efficiency. Finally, we provide an alternate primer pair to use as a positive control for human
RNA detection in SARS-CoV-2 assays, as we found that the widely used US CDC primers
(targeting human ​RPP30​) do not span an exon-exon junction and therefore does not provide
an adequate control for the reverse transcription reaction.

Introduction
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to rapidly spread globally, reaching in
excess of 5.2 million cases and 330,000 deaths, causing substantial socio-economic impacts
(UNSDG 2020; Nicola et al. 2020; WHO 2020a)​. In order to facilitate: (I) minimising and
tracing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and (II) an easing of lockdown measures; we require
information on the extent of community transmission, particularly of asymptomatic cases
(Prather et al. 2020)​. This necessitates accessible, high-throughput, and cost-effective
methods of SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR has become a critical tool for detecting
SARS-CoV-2, by amplifying virus-derived RNA, due to its increased sensitivity and fast
processing time ​(Esbin et al. 2020)​. However, this has been limited by the requirement for
labor-intensive RNA extractions in order to enrich viral RNA. We propose an alternative
method that bypasses RNA extractions by performing one-step qRT-PCR directly on saliva.
Importantly, saliva samples have been highlighted as a useful diagnostic tool for
SARS-CoV-2 detection ​(Azzi et al. 2020)​ and qRT-PCR on crude saliva samples has been
used to detect Zika virus ​(Li et al. 2019)​. We also propose the use of SYBR green-based
detection to complement the multiplexed hydrolysis probe-based detection of widely used
kits. The relative simplicity and cost of SYBR green detection is particularly relevant for
facilitating mass testing of SARS-CoV-2 in poorer countries. Indeed, SYBR green, ​Taq
polymerase, and reverse transcriptase can all be made relatively cheaply and there is a
growing community effort for open source protocol development (e.g. BEARmix:
https://gitlab.com/tjian-darzacq-lab/bearmix).
The use of SYBR green also allows for the diagnosis of non-specific amplification via melt
curve analysis (T​m​ calling). Indeed, non-specific amplification has been a problem for
hydrolysis probe-based kits, likely the result of sequence similarity to RNA from other
commonly found pathogens including viruses ​(Vogels et al. 2020; Rahman et al. 2020)​. For
example, early versions of the US CDC kits were prone to false positives when testing for
SARS-CoV-2 because the primers bound to other milder strains of coronavirus
(Satyanarayana 2020; Cohen 2020)​. Therefore, the ability to distinguish non-specific
amplification is important for reliable diagnosis. Finally, the internal control primers from the
US CDC kit [targeting human ​RPP30​ ​(Vogels et al. 2020)​] do not span an exon-exon
junction thus allowing amplification of genomic DNA instead of specifically detecting
RNA-derived cDNA. This means it does not provide a reliable positive control for successful
reverse transcription. We also tested the combined use of a sample buffer containing
Tween20 and heat treatment for impediments on PCR chemistry so they could be
considered for virus inactivation ​(Roberts et al. 2009; Darnell et al. 2004)​.

Method
Human RNA was purified from blood using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's
instructions. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 1 (Twist Bioscience, SKU:102019) was
used to represent viral RNA. One-step qRT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR

one-step kit (Applied Biosystems) to amplify RNA-derived cDNA in 10 µL reactions on a
LightCycler480 Instrument II (Roche, LC480).
The following describes our protocol use to obtain the results herein:
1. Saliva samples were collected in a 50 mL Falcon tube.
2. Samples were diluted 1:1, using a reverse pipetting technique with wide-end or cut
pipette tips to overcome saliva viscosity, with sample buffer (TE-T: 10 mM Tris pH
6.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Tween20) in a clean PCR tube then heated at 95 °C for 5 mins.
3. Heat-treated samples were further diluted to a final dilution ranging from 1/4 to 1/128.
4. A one-step RT-PCR master mix was prepared containing Power SYBR Green
RT-PCR Mix (2×, 5 µL per reaction), 125× RT enzyme mix (0.08 µL per reaction),
and appropriate primer pairs (0.15 µL of 10 µM stock for each primer per reaction to
obtain final concentration of 150 nM), according to the manufacturer's instructions for
a 10 uL reaction volume. Primers used are listed in Table 1.
5. 5.4 µL of the master mix was combined with 4.6 µL of sample on a 384-well skirted
PCR plate (Roche style, BioTools). Samples include: (I) saliva diluted in sample
buffer, (II) purified human RNA diluted in nuclease-free water, (III) synthetic
SARS-CoV-2 RNA diluted in nuclease-free water, or (IV) no-template control (NTC:
nuclease-free water or sample buffer as appropriate).
6. All samples were run in either technical duplicate or triplicate reactions.
7. The plate was sealed with an adhesive optically transparent PCR seal (Integrated
Sciences).
8. The LC480 was run according to the program outlined in Table 2 based on the
manufacturer's instructions.
9. The LC480 Instrument Software (v1.5.0) was used to calculate threshold cycle (Ct)
values from raw fluorescence. First, T​m ​calling was performed on all reactions to
exclude:
a. Reactions with products matching non-specific amplification as reflected from
the negative control (no template), or
b. Reactions not demonstrating a single clear product matching the product
amplified from the positive control (SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 1).
10. Amplified products from each primer pair were inspected by gel electrophoresis
(1.5% agarose) to match the T​m ​calling results to expected fragment size (Figure 4
A-B).
11. The ​2nd derivative method​ was used for determining Ct values (based on polynomial
regression performed by the LightCycler480 Instrument Software using the high
confidence algorithm). Each reaction, and its corresponding Ct value, was
considered individually.
12. PCR efficiency was estimated using two separate methods:
a. PCR efficiency for each primer pair was estimated using LinReg on positive
control reactions demonstrating a single expected product as determined in
step 8 (​ Ruijter et al. 2009)​. Additionally, PCR efficiencies were only
considered if reactions passed LinReg sample and quality checks, for
example reactions displaying minimal noise, no baseline error, and
appropriate amplification and plateau phases. In some cases PCR

efficiencies could not be determined by LinReg (“n.d.”), for example due to
variable background fluorescence and/or minimal amplification.
b. For selected primer pairs, PCR efficiency was also estimated using a dilution
series of Twist Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 1 (or purified human RNA
for ​GAPDH​). A standard curve was constructed in GraphPad Prism (Ct values
plotted against Log​10​ Concentration) and its slope was used to determine
PCR efficiency with the formula: E = [-1+10​-1/slope​] x 100.

Results
We first established a workflow for one-step qRT-PCR by amplifying ​GAPDH ​from a dilution
series of purified human RNA (1x = 344.4 ng/µL; Figure 1 A-B). The reverse primer spans an
exon-exon junction in ​GAPDH ​(exons 2 and 3), thus minimising the risk of amplifying
genomic DNA ​(McIntyre et al. 2012)​. As expected, a single product was observed and Ct
values demonstrated a log-linear relationship to RNA concentration. The abnormal
fluorescence curve from in the 1x sample (not included in regression) suggested the
possibility of a saturated reverse-transcription reaction resulting in a less pronounced
amplification phase.
We next amplified ​GAPDH ​from a series of diluted saliva samples without RNA purification
(Figure 2). We checked for specific amplification by comparing product T​m​ based on purified
human RNA. Unfortunately, high concentrations of saliva inhibited the reaction as seen by
open circles in 2​-1​ - 2​-4​ dilutions. As we diluted the saliva, we were able to more confidently
amplify ​GAPDH​ suggesting that some saliva-derived material may be interfering with the
reaction. We also tested the effect of a moderate heat treatment (70°C for 5 minutes). This
was done to simulate heat inactivation, which would be performed on saliva from potentially
infectious samples. Interestingly, whilst Ct values increased after heat-treatment,
heat-treatment improved the ability to amplify the expected product from ​GAPDH​ in less
diluted saliva.
We next tested whether the use of various sample buffers and heat treatments impaired the
one-step RT-PCR reaction. This included the use of Tween20 and a 5 minute 95°C heat
treatment, which is advised for inactivating viral particles ​(Roberts et al. 2009; Darnell et al.
2004)​. Three buffers were trialled: PBS (pH 7.4, 10 mM Na​2​HPO​4​, 2 mM KH​2​PO​4​, 2.7 mM
KCl, 140 mM NaCl), TBS (20 mM Tris pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl), and TE-T (10 mM Tris pH 6.5,
1 mM EDTA, 1% Tween20) alongside two heat treatments (70 or 95°C) to observe whether
​ mplification was impeded. The use of PBS led to no amplification regardless of
GAPDH a
sample or treatment. On the other hand, TBS and TE-T could amplify ​GAPDH ​from human
RNA for all conditions (Figure 3 A-B; note that TE-T shifted the expected T​m​ by
approximately 3 degrees compared to TBS). TE-T was clearly superior to TBS in amplifying
GAPDH f​ rom saliva. Finally, the use of a 5 minute 95°C heat treatment led to improved
GAPDH a
​ mplification from saliva (Figure 3 B).
Using these conditions, we next sought to test a range of primers designed for SARS-CoV-2
detection. As we were using a SYBR green-based method, we sought to minimize the
possibility of non-specific amplification. The combination of NCBI Primer-BLAST ​(Ye et al.

2012)​ and Nucleotide BLAST was used to screen a range of primers, designed to detect
SARS-CoV-2 RNA, based on the following criteria:
1. Primer-BLAST: no products <1000 bp from human mRNA and genomic DNA
2. Nucleotide BLAST: no, or minimal, matches to human mRNA and genomic DNA
3. For ​GAPDH,​ one of the primers had to span an exon-exon junction to minimise the
risk of amplifying genomic DNA.
From this process we selected the following primers: CCDC-N and CCDC-ORF1ab (China
CDC), HKU-ORF1b and HKU-N (University of Hong Kong), SG2 (Sigma-Aldrich), nCoV_IP2
and nCoV_IP4 (Institut Pasteur), and E_Sarbeco and RdRP_SARSr (Charité) [Table 1
(WHO 2020b)​].
We tested the ability, of the selected primers, to amplify synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Figure
4 shows our results for nine SARS-CoV-2 primer pairs, including gel electrophoresis to
confirm correct amplification (Figure 4 A), melt curve analysis (Figure 4 B), and SYBR-green
fluorescence (Figure 4 C). Subsequently, we calculated Ct values from the raw fluorescence
curves for all reactions (Figure 4 D). Using these calculated Ct values, we determined the
specificity for each primer with which to compare performance (Ct​NTC​–Ct​Virus​; Figure 4 E).
Based on this, we selected four primer pairs: CCDC-N, HKU-ORF1b, nCoV_IP2, and SG2;
for further analysis.
We next performed qRT-PCR on a dilution series of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA to
determine a limit of detection (LoD) per select primer pair and included saliva, human RNA,
and NTC as negative controls (Figure 5). Based on the ability to amplify the correct product,
based on T​m​ calling, and observing a log-linear relationship between Ct value and viral RNA
concentration. We estimate the LoD for CCDC-N (64–256 copies per reaction), HKU-ORF1b
(256-1024 copies per reaction), and SG2 (16–64 copies per reaction). We could not
determine a LoD for nCoV_IP2, although this primer pair appeared less prone to amplifying
non-specific products.
Lastly, we tested whether saliva interfered with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To do
this, we spiked-in two quantities of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (100 or 1000 copies per reaction) into
a saliva dilution series. We picked dilutions ranging from 1/8 to 1/64 to identify the minimal
dilution allowing unimpeded detection using our most sensitive primer pairs: SG2 and
CCDC-N (Figure 6). Unfortunately, mixing with saliva resulted in reduced sensitivity (higher
Ct values). Furthermore, heat treatment abolished the sensitivity of CCDC-N at both RNA
concentrations and for SG2 on 100 copies per reaction. This is, in part, likely driven by
heat-induced RNA degradation (see Figure 6, right, “100 copies of Viral RNA”). Promisingly,
primer pair SG2 could detect 1000 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all saliva dilutions after
heat treatment (Figure 6, top left panel).

Discussion
From these results, we describe a SYBR green-based approach for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples. Performing a one-step qRT-PCR assay directly
on saliva provides several advantages, including relative ease of self-collection requiring no
trained personnel and less PPE, minimal patient discomfort, skipping laborious and

expensive RNA extractions, and reducing demand on swabs (which are in global shortage)
(Azzi et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020)​. The SYBR green-based methodology also offers the ability
to diagnose non-specific amplification, which is not possible using hydrolysis-based
primer-probes, and reduces demand on commercial kits, which are in short supply (thereby
increasing testing capacity). We estimate the cost of these reactions to be in the range of
AUD $4-8 per sample. Aspects of this method could be combined with community-driven
open source protocols (for example, ​BEARmix​: https://gitlab.com/tjian-darzacq-lab/bearmix)
to achieve even lower costs while addressing technical limitations, such as appropriate
methods for virus inactivation as discussed below.
Despite promising progress, we must highlight the critical need for validation against patient
samples alongside clinical certification in order for results to be considered diagnostic. While
we attempted to mimic patient samples by spiking synthetic RNA into non-infectious saliva,
this cannot replace validation using patient saliva. We propose the combined use of
Tween20 and heat treatment (95 °C for 5 mins) for viral inactivation ​(Roberts et al. 2009;
Darnell et al. 2004)​, and for increased release of viral RNA from patient saliva. However, this
needs to be validated with samples from patients with known SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
therefore report a theoretical limit of detection based on reactions using synthetic virus RNA
while controlling for non-specific amplification.
Primer pairs CCDC-N and SG2 demonstrated the best specificity (Figure 4 E) and sensitivity
(Figure 5 A, C) towards the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Based on the amplification of
synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serial dilutions (no saliva), we estimate the LoD for CCDC-N
and SG2 primer pairs to be 64-256 and 16-64 molecules per reaction, respectively.
Therefore, we propose these primers to be best suited for SARS-CoV-2 screening reactions.
However, whilst an LoD could not be determined for nCoV_IP2, this primer pair showed
negligible non-specific amplification (leading to higher specificity) and, therefore, would be
useful to confirm ambiguous samples. The amplification efficiency observed here performs
comparably with other primer-probe based detection methods on synthetic SARS-CoV-2
RNA ​(Vogels et al. 2020)​. Promisingly, despite different methodology and source RNA, we
arrive at similar conclusions regarding the superiority of nCoV_IP2 (or RdRp IP2) and
CCDC-N primers, whereas RdRP_SARSr and E_Sarbeco performed poorly ​(Etievant et al.
2020; Vogels et al. 2020)​.
We uncover a promising new candidate in primer pair SG2 designed by Sigma-Aldrich for
research use (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/covid-19.html). With these primers, we estimate
a LoD of 16 - 64 molecules per reaction, which translates to between 1.6×10​4​ – 6.4×10​4
copies per mL in the original sample (Table 3). The viral load in self-collected saliva samples
has been estimated to range from 9.9×10​2​ – 1.2×10​8​ (median = 3.3×10​6​) copies per mL ​(To
et al. 2020b)​. The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples has been
estimated as 1.6×10​5​ copies per mL ​(To et al. 2020a)​. However, these measures of viral
load were from patients showing disease symptoms. It remains unclear what the viral load in
asymptomatic cases are, though there is some limited evidence for a correlation between
symptom severity and the amount of viral particles detected ​(Liu et al. 2020)​. Thus, if
purifying RNA from saliva, the SG2 primer pair will be able to detect the majority of infected
individuals (Table 3, SG2 LoD = 1.6×10​4​ - 6.4×10​4​ copies per mL).

SARS-CoV2-RNA could be detected directly from saliva (mimicking patient samples) without
purification. Whilst this was successful for samples kept at room temperature, our heat
treatment led to reduced sensitivity, especially for the CCDC-N primer pair. Nonetheless,
primer pair SG2 was still able to detect 1,000 RNA copies per reaction in saliva diluted 1/8
(of which 4.6 µL is added to the reaction), translating to approximately 1.7×10​6​ copies per
mL after heat-treatment, which is still within the viral load range. The heat-induced reduction
in sensitivity against SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported independently ​(Pan et al. 2020)​.
The reduced sensitivity is likely the result of: (I) increased spontaneous RNA cleavage at
higher temperatures, and (II) enzymatic degradation by salivary ribonucleases post-heat
treatment, which may also denature protective proteins or RNA secondary structures ​(Brisco
and Morley 2012; Emilsson et al. 2003)​. This degradation may be circumvented by the
addition of RNA stabilisers, such as 6-8% formamide ​(Yasukawa et al. 2010)​, prior to heat
treatment or with an alternate buffer with greater pH stability at higher temperatures ​(Sullivan
et al. 2020; Reineke et al. 2011)​. However, caution is required as buffer composition
drastically affects RT-PCR performance as highlighted by no amplification with PBS,
although it has been shown to be a suitable medium for transporting samples ​(Rodino et al.
2020)​. Alternative methods for viral inactivation could be considered, such as the addition of
biocidal agents, proteases, stronger detergents, or reducing agents ​(Brittany S. Mertens
2015; Pfaender et al. 2015; Carver and Seto 1968; Leung et al. 2017; Kampf et al. 2020)​.
This would require subsequent inactivation and/or dilution to prevent the impediment of PCR
enzymes. It may also be possible to apply ultraviolet radiation to saliva samples or
temporarily alter the pH, however, it may be challenging to find a treatment leading to viral
inactivation without complete RNA damage ​(Darnell et al. 2004; Lemire et al. 2016; Beck et
al. 2015)​. Alternatively, RNA extractions could be performed on saliva for which
clinically-relevant methods now exist, however, this would still add considerable costs and
labour ​(Pandit et al. 2013; Sullivan et al. 2020)​. Methods for one-step RNA extractions may
provide a compromise between direct qRT-PCR and complete RNA extraction ​(Sentmanat
et al. 2020)​.
We hope our results will be helpful to other laboratories investigating the possibility of
one-step qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing from saliva samples. Our comparison of various
reported primer pairs is also likely to be of use to laboratories around the world. In particular,
we hope this information provides a platform for increased accessibility to promote
SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially in poorer countries. Finally, we propose the use of the
​ rimer pair, used here, as the human RNA positive control. The reverse primer
GAPDH p
spans an exon-exon junction unlike the widely used US CDC primers.
