SUMMARY
Recently, two mRNA vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) have become available, but there is also an emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants
with increased transmissibility and virulence1-6. A major concern is whether the available
vaccines will be equally effective against these variants. The vaccines are designed to
induce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein7,8, which is required
for viral entry to host cells9. Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is often evaluated by antibody
production, while less is known about the T-cell response. Here we developed,
characterized, and implemented two standardized, functional assays to measure T-cell
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected, convalescent, and vaccinated individuals. We
found that vaccinated individuals had robust T-cell responses to the wild type spike and

nucleocapsid proteins, even more so than convalescent patients. We also found
detectable but diminished T-cell responses to spike variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and
B.1.1.248) among vaccinated but otherwise healthy donors. Since decreases in antibody
neutralization have also been observed with some variants10-12, investigation into the T-cell
response to these variants as an alternative means of viral control is imperative.
Standardized measurements of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are feasible and can be
easily adjusted to determine changes in response to variants.

INTRODUCTION
Most reports of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination focus on humoral immunity by
quantifying anti-spike IgG, IgM, or IgA levels in peripheral blood13-17. Antibodies to the SARSCoV-2 spike protein can be detected in convalescent individuals following natural infection and
correlate with virus neutralizing activity13,14,18. In individuals who develop antibodies, some reports
show that IgG levels wane over the first 3–6 months13,19-22, despite the persistence of memory B
cells13, whereas others have demonstrated a more sustained response 5–8 months following
infection18,23,24. Continued immunity in individuals is imperative for developing herd immunity and
preventing virus spread.

In addition to humoral immunity, T-cell immunity is important for eliminating infected cells and
promoting antibody class switching. The development of memory T-cells recognizing SARS-CoV2 is likely to be important for long-term protection. With other closely-related coronavirus
infections, antibody titers were initially weak or diminished within 2–3 years25-28. In contrast, virusspecific T-cells, which can develop in the absence of seroconversion29, have been detected for
6–11 years30,31. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells are present in COVID-19 convalescent
individuals32-34, even in the absence of seroconversion32 or symptomatic infection34. This suggests
that cellular immunity may play a larger role in sustained protection and a subset of the population

that does not have detectable antibodies may nonetheless be protected due to T-cell mediated
immunity.

RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 ELISpot T-cell immunity test
To measure SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity in convalescent and vaccinated individuals, we
developed an IFNγ ELISpot assay that quantifies IFNγ-producing T-cells in response to viral
peptides. We used commercially available peptide pools from the initial SARS-CoV-2 spike and
nucleocapsid protein sequences identified in Wuhan35. Given its size, the spike protein was split
between two pools, A and B, with A containing amino acids (AA) 1–643 and B containing AA633–
1273 (Figure 1A). We stimulated freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
with the peptide pools and quantified the median spot forming units (SFU) per 2.5x105 PBMC
from duplicate wells (Figure 1B).

To establish the SFU threshold for the peptide pools and the sensitivity and specificity of the
assay, we first evaluated responses in two donor groups: healthy controls who had no known
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or definitive exposure as defined by the CDC (n=19; Extended
Data Table 1; 13 of the 19 had serum available for antibody testing and were negative for antispike-IgG/A/M), and a group of convalescent patients who had recovered from confirmed COVID19 (n=25; Extended Data Table 2; 2 of the 25 were positive by antibody testing to spike protein
but had tested negative by PCR). The median time from diagnosis to ELISpot assay was 162
days (range of 83–237 days; Extended Data Figure 1). The healthy control cohort had low
background responses to all SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools, compared to strong T-cell responses in
the convalescent cohort (Figure 1C, D). Convalescent patients had a median SFU of 16.0 for
spike pool A, 21.5 for spike pool B and 23.5 for the nucleocapsid pool, compared to <2.5 SFU in

the healthy controls (Figure 1E). There was no correlation between SFU and the days from
diagnosis or patient age (Extended Data Figure 2). Only one convalescent donor (C11) had no
response to any of the peptide pools. Interestingly, this individual had tested positive for SARSCoV-2 by PCR but tested negative for antibodies to spike protein despite having mild symtpoms.

Using these results, we performed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses for the
individual peptide pools (Extended Data Figure 3A). The relationship between the average SFU
in response to either spike pool was evaluated for the associated sensitivity and specificity
(Extended Data Figure 3B). A positive threshold of 6 SFU provided the optimal balance between
sensitivity (92.0%) and specificity (90.0%). Using the same positive threshold of 6 SFU, the
nucleocapsid pool response had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 95%. This assay
represents a unified and standardized approach to measure T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2
that could be used by clinical labs with experience in performing ELISpot tests.

T-cell immunity following vaccination
As of January 2021, there were two vaccines with FDA emergency use approval in the United
States. Both vaccines (developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) deliver mRNA coding for the
full-length spike protein, require two doses a minimum of 21 or 28 days apart, and provide 95%
and 94.1% efficacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection respectively7,8. We used our
ELISpot assay to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses in vaccinated individuals prior to
inoculation (V0/negative controls; median 10.5, range 0–156 days prior to injection), after the first
dose (post-V1; median 22 days, range 16–30 days), and after the second dose (post-V2; median
59 days after the initial dose, range 38–204 days). PBMC from 29 donors post-V2 (11 Pfizer, 18
Moderna) were tested using the IFNγ ELISpot assay. This cohort of vaccinated donors had no
history of COVID-19 symptoms or positive SARS-CoV-2 test prior to vaccination.

Similar to results from the phase I/II vaccine trials36,37, all fully vaccinated donors developed
positive T-cell responses to one or both spike peptide pools. The median responses were higher
in the fully vaccinated cohort compared to the convalescent cohort (Figure 2A). While, on
average, convalescent patients were tested further from diagnosis than vaccinated donors from
injection, no association was seen between days from positive test and ELISpot response
(Extended Data Figure 2A). Interestingly, the magnitude of T cell response to spike pool B was
higher than to pool A in vaccinated donors (p=0.0311), but not convalescent patients. T-cell
responses against the nucleocapsid protein, which is not encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,
were lower in vaccinated subjects compared to the convalescent cohort (p<0.0001). Thus,
positive responses (≥6 SFU/2.5x106 PBMC) to the nucleocapsid protein likely reflect natural
infection.

A portion of donors (n=14) were also tested post-V1, and T-cell responses were positive against
at least one spike pool in 11/14 tested. The median SFU in response to spike pools A+B increased
post-V1 (p=0.018) and post-V2, (p<0.0001) compared to baseline (Figure 2B). The cumulative
SFU response to spike pool A+B post-V1 were of similar magnitude to those observed in the
convalescent cohort, but were increased compared to the convalescent cohort post-V2
(p=0.0219; Figure 2B)

High throughput whole blood T-cell assay
We next sought to develop a more straightforward assay for evaluating T-cell responses to
vaccination that would be better suited for high-throughput processing, which would avoid the
personnel and blood-processing requirements of ELISpot analysis and expensive peptide pools.
To achieve this, we designed a whole-blood assay based on the in vitro diagnostic QuantiFERONTB Gold Plus assay that is used to evaluate T-cell recognition of mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB)

antigens when assessing latent TB infection. In our assay we focused on assessing T-cell
responses to the spike protein, which consists of two main subdomains, S1 and S2, that can form
a trimeric tertiary structure (Figure 2C). S1 contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which
interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells38,39, while S2 promotes
fusion with the host cell membrane. We stimulated heparinized whole blood with positive and
negative controls and with the individual monomeric forms of SARS-CoV-2 S1 or S2 proteins
overnight and then measured IFNγ (IU/mL) released into the plasma using a QuantiFERON
ELISA (Figure 2D). We used results from 7 unvaccinated/unexposed healthy controls and 16
vaccinated donors post-V2 (5 Pfizer, 11 Moderna; median 56 days following the first dose, range
38–204 days) to determine the positive threshold of the assay. Individual ROC curves for S1 and
S2 were calculated (Extended Data Figure 4A). We then evaluated how assay
sensitivity/specificity were impacted by altering the positive threshold when the response to both
spike subdomains were combined (i.e. if the response to either S1 or S2 was greater than a given
threshold value). A positive threshold of ≥0.3 IU/mL was selected to optimally discriminate
between the two groups, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (Extended Data Figure 4B).
This threshold value is similar to the positive cut-off of 0.35 IU/mL that is used in the in vitro
diagnostic QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay40.

When visualizing IFNγ produced in response to S1 or S2, there was a clear distinction between
the unvaccinated/unexposed healthy controls (V0) and vaccinated donors post-V2 (Figure 2E).
All post-V2 donor samples had positive responses to either S1 and/or S2, with S1 responses
lower compared to S2 (p=0.0063). Some donors (n=12) were also tested post-V1 (2 Pfizer, 10
Moderna; median 22 days post vaccination, range 18–30; Figure 2E). Only one donor (M017)
had a negative result. This individual was also negative in the ELISpot assay yet had detectable
anti-spike antibodies by IgG/IgA/IgM ELISA, and subsequently developed a spike response in the

ELISpot assay post-V2, but could not be reassessed in the whole blood assay due to limited
sample. The IFNγ response post-V1 and post-V2 was significantly higher than V0 healthy controls
for both protein subunits (Figure 2F). The majority of the vaccinated samples tested using the
whole blood assay were also positive for anti-spike antibodies (Figure 2E) and positive for T-cell
responses to spike peptide pools in the ELISpot assay. Interestingly, one donor (P002) was
positive for T-cell response using the whole blood and ELISpot assays, but negative for anti-spike
IgG/A/M post-V1, and became positive for all three tests post-V2. Another subject initially in the
control cohort (U002) later received the Moderna vaccine and was tested much earlier at 7 and 9
days post-V1. Positive T-cell responses to the spike protein were detected by both the whole
blood and ELISpot assays, while remaining negative for a total antibody response until later
(Extended Data Figure 5). These results demonstrated similar efficacy between the two tests
(ELISpot and whole-blood assay) in identifying individuals with positive T-cell responses to SARSCoV-2.

Vaccine responses by demographics
We next interrogated the relationship of T-cell response in vaccinated subjects with time post
vaccination, vaccine product, sex, and age (Figure 3A). To investigate if there was a difference
in the kinetics and magnitude of the anti-spike T-cell response between individuals receiving
either Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, we plotted the individual’s ELISpot SFU for spike pools A+B
against time since vaccination (Figure 3B). In general, the median SFU increased following
vaccination, including between post-V1 and post-V2. An example of one individual’s (M005)
ELISpot shows an increasing response over the three time points (V0, post-V1, post-V2; Figure
3C). However, in three individuals who received the Moderna vaccine, the median SFU
decreased between post-V1 and post-V2 assessment, though it still remained well above the
6.0 SFU threshold, possibly reflecting contraction of an effector T-cell response. One male
subject vaccinated with Moderna (M019) was receiving the B-cell depleting drug rituximab at the

time of vaccination and demonstrated an anti-spike T-cell response post-V1 (Figure 3C) while
remaining negative for anti-spike IgG/A/M even post-V2, demonstrating the possibility of
developing T-cell immunity independent of an antibody response. Overall, median SFUs postV2 were increased in those receiving the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine
(spike pool A p=0.1069, spike pool B p=0.0805, A+B p=0.0596; Figure 3D). Across both
vaccines, females had increased SFU for spike pool A+B compared to males (p=0.0411; Figure
3E). Age younger than 50 years was weakly associated with a higher median SFU response to
spike pools A+B (p=0.2273; Figure 3F and Extended Data Figure 6).

T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants following vaccination
Using our standardized ELISpot assay, we also examined the impact of the emerging SARS-CoV2 variants on T-cell responses to the spike protein. By using individual peptide pools (rather than
whole protein), our ELISpot assay provided sufficient dynamic range in T-cell responses to identify
potential decrements in response to variant mutations. Variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and
B.1.1.248/P1 were first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil respectively. Not
long after their discovery, these variants were detected globally and stirred concern due to their
increased transmissibility and virulence1-6. There have also been reports of SARS-CoV-2
seropositive individuals becoming reinfected with a new variant41-44. These variants contain
mutations in the spike protein (Figure 4A), including mutations in the ACE2 interacting surface of
the RBD, that could lead to the loss of epitopes recognized by the neutralizing antibodies
developed from SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination. In fact, multiple reports have
demonstrated diminished neutralizing activity of vaccinated and convalescent patient sera in
response to the variants compared to wild type SARS-CoV-210-12.

Considering these variants may escape antibody neutralization, how they influence the T-cell
immune response is of particular interest. One published report measured CD4 T-cell vaccine
responses to a subset of the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in one of two spike
protein subunits, finding no decreased response to variant relative to wild type proteins45.
However, as the authors acknowledge, wild type responses were very low due to the use of whole
proteins rather than peptide pools45, which precludes an accurate fold-change assessment. To
determine the impact of these variants on the magnitude of the anti-spike T-cell response in
vaccinated individuals, we used our ELISpot assay to stimulate PBMC from vaccinated individuals
post-V2 with spike peptide pools from the B.1.1.7, B.1.315, and B1.1.248 SARS-CoV-2 variants
(Figure 4A). These pools were divided into pools A and B to mirror the wild type spike pools.
Given the distribution of the mutations within the spike protein, the majority of the mutations,
including those in the RBD, were present in spike pool A. There was a median decrease in SFU
in response to spike pool A variants by 20.7% for B.1.1.7, 26.0% for B.1.351, and 41.4% for
B.1.1.248 compared to the wild type. The response to spike pool B for B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.248 were
not impacted (<2.0% change); however, the median response to B.1.351 was decreased by
20.2% (Figure 4B,C). When combined, the response to variant spike pools A+B were decreased
to 84.6% [95%CI 73.5–94.7] of the wild type response for variant B.1.1.7, 70.2% [62.3–86.7], for
B.1.315, and 83.4% [58.3-97.0] for B.1.1.248 (Figure 4D). Additionally, there were several
individuals who had a much greater reduction in their T-cell response to the variants despite
having a good response to wild type peptides, suggesting that some individuals might have
substantially impaired T-cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest. Median T-cell
responses to the variants among donors receiving the Pfizer vaccine were lower than those
receiving the Moderna vaccine, though not statistically significant (p=0.2446 for B.1.1.7, p=0.2455
for B.1.315, p=0.0740 for B.1.1.248; Extended Data Figure 7).

Thus far in the course of the pandemic, seroconversion has been the focus of clinical tests of
immunity, largely due to the ease of antibody detection. Unlike humoral immunity assays,
measurements of T-cell immunity require functional viable cells, which makes these assays more
challenging to deploy on a population-wide scale. Both T-cell immunity tests developed herein
have excellent sensitivity and specificity and could be adopted by clinical laboratories to monitor
the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination using commercially available
reagents. T-cell immunity may be especially important for convalescent individuals who do not
seroconvert32 and immunocompromised patient populations who are less likely to develop an
efficacious antibody response, as they may experience prolonged infection and/or longer duration
of virus shedding46. In adults without effective humoral immunity as a result of underlying disease
or therapeutic interventions, clinical measurements of T cell immunity may also guide physicians
in determining when booster vaccination may be appropriate. Even in immunocompetent patients,
increased T-cell response after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with a more benign
clinical course47. Our ELISpot assay could also help to distinguish between patients who were
naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive response to the spike and nucleocapsid proteins)
versus those who were vaccinated (response only to the spike protein) and can easily be modified
to test for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We used these assays to evaluate T-cell responses in convalescent and vaccinated individuals.
A common gauge for vaccine potency is the development of antibodies to a similar level as those
induced by natural infection. The initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials demonstrated increases in IgG
antibody levels and neutralizing activity following the full vaccination course that were similar to
or higher than those observed in convalescent patients36,37. Using this same parameter for T-cell
responses, we found the number of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T-cells were increased in
fully vaccinated individuals compared to convalescent patients who had experienced mild COVID19. In our cohort, the T-cell responses increased significantly from baseline after the first dose of

the vaccine (even as soon as 7 days after vaccination and before seroconversion), which was
equivalent to responses in convalescent individuals. This is in contrast to reported antibody
neutralization titers, which seem to require both doses to reach convalescent levels36,37, unless
the individual had prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure48,49. The presence of a robust T-cell response
comparable to convalescent patients after a single inoculation could suggest a similar level of
SARS-CoV-2 protection and warrants further investigation as a possible measure to increase
vaccine availability in resource-limited settings. Since duration of response will most likely be
affected by the number of doses, long-term follow up of subjects receiving one or two doses will
be valuable, including those receiving the Johnson & Johnson/Jansen vaccine who were not
included in our study due to timing of FDA approval.

We observed a weak association between increased T-cell response in those vaccinated with
Moderna compared to Pfizer. Though more subjects are needed to confirm the validity of this
trend, such a difference could be a consequence of the higher dose of mRNA in the Moderna
vaccine compared to Pfizer (100 μg and 30 μg respectively)7,8. While no direct comparison of Tcell response between these two vaccines has previously been performed, a head-to-head
comparison of the antibody responses found similar neutralizing activities11. We also identified a
weak association between a decreased T-cell response and age, which has been similarly
observed post-V2 with anti-spike IgG levels and antigen-specific memory B cells48. Finally, we
observed an increased T-cell response in females compared to males, mirroring the response
following natural infection where females with COVID-19 had more robust T-cell activation
compared to males50.

The emergence of more transmissible and virulent SARS-CoV-2 variants1-6, coinciding with
evidence of escape from neutralizing antibodies to the wild type virus10-12, raises concerns
regarding the effectiveness of currently available vaccines. This doubt is highlighted by two recent

cases of SARS-CoV-2 variant infection despite full vaccination in the presence of neutralizing
antibodies to the original and variant viruses51. In the absence of effective humoral protection, Tcell immunity to these variants may be sufficient for viral clearance. We demonstrate reduced Tcell responses in vaccinated individuals to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and
B.1.1.248. This reduction in T-cell response was predominantly to regions of the protein bearing
the majority of the variant mutations, while responses to regions with fewer mutations were less
affected. We observed a smaller fractional decrement in T-cell response to the variants than has
been observed for antibody neutralization assays10-12. However, it will be important to determine
how T-cell immunity impacts aggregate immune response to the variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses and
if this reduction translates to adverse clinical outcomes.

METHODS

Study Participants
All donors were consented and participated voluntarily in this study. Protocols were approved by
the Partners Institutional Review Board.

Convalescent cohort: We tested 25 individuals (9 males, 16 females) who had recovered from
COVID-19 between March and May 2020. The median age was 46 (range 25–69 years). SARSCoV-2 infection was confirmed by PCR in 23/25 cases and by serology in the remaining 2/25
cases. Serology results for convalescent patients were extracted from medical records. The
median time between the diagnostic result and the performance of the ELISpot assay was 162
days (83–237 days). The clinical symptoms reported for these donors were all classified as mild
according to WHO definitions1. One donor was hospitalized briefly (C002).

Healthy control cohorts: We tested 19 SARS-CoV-2 naive healthy controls (10 male, 9 female)
by ELISpot. Ten donors were tested between the months of August and December 2020, with the
remaining nine tested between January and April 2021. The median age 35.3 (23.0–63.7 years).
Of the 19 donors, 13 had serology testing performed in parallel with the ELISpot for anti-spike
IgG/A/M and all were negative. For the whole blood assay, we tested 7 healthy controls (4 male,
3 female, median age of 31.0, range 23.8–63.7). Healthy controls had no history of SARS-CoV-2
infection or close contact with a confirmed infected individual. All 7 donors had negative serology
for anti-spike IgG/A/M.

Vaccination cohorts: The ELISpot post-vaccination cohort included 14 donors (7 male, 7 female)
after their first dose (2 Pfizer, 12 Moderna; median 22 days after the initial dose, range 16–30
days) with a median age of 35.6 (range 23.0–61.6 years). All 14 donors had serology testing

performed for anti-spike IgG/A/M, of which only 2 did not seroconvert. An additional 29 donors
(16 male, 13 female) were tested following their second dose (11 Pfizer, 18 Moderna; median 59
days after the initial dose, range 38–204 days) with a median age of 35.6 (23.0–81.0 years).

The post-V1 cohort for the whole blood assay included 12 donors (6 male, 6 female, 2 Pfizer, 10
Moderna, tested a median 22 days, range 18–30 days after vaccination), with a median age of
35.5 years (range 23.0–59.6 years). All 12 donors had serology for anti-spike IgG/A/M performed.
In addition, 16 donors (9 male, 7 female) were tested post-V2 (5 Pfizer, 11 Moderna, median 56
days, range 38–204), with a median age of 35.5 (range 23.0–73.3). One additional donor (U002)
was only tested at day 7 and 9 post-V1 and is excluded from the vaccinated donor cohort and
shown only in Extended Data Figure 5). Self-reported vaccine associated symptoms were collated
and shown in Extended Data Table 4.

Blood collection and processing
Blood was collected in Lithium Heparin tubes and red top serum tubes. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood using ficoll density gradient
centrifugation in a SepMate tube (Stem Cell Technologies) following 1:2 dilution with RPMI.
Serum tubes were centrifuged, and serum was then aliquoted and stored at -80°C prior to
performing the anti-spike antibody ELISA. ELISpot and whole blood assays were performed within
8 hours of venesection.

Peptide pools and protein
The commercially available peptide pools consist of 15mers with an 11 amino acid overlap,
spanning the entire spike and nucleocapsid sequence (JPT peptide solutions). Peptide pools
based upon the initial sequence identified in Wuhan had a guaranteed purity of either >70% or
>90%. Spike variant peptide pools are termed ‘crude’ with HPLC-MS assessment and chemical

capping to prevent de novo epitope formation. The nucleocapsid pool (PM-WCPV-NCAP2)
contains 102 peptides, whilst the spike protein pool (PM-WCPV-S-3) was divided into spike pool
A (158 peptides) and spike pool B (157 peptides, of which the last is a 17mer). Spike pool A only
contains peptides spanning the Spike S1 subunit from AA1-643, which includes the receptor
binding domain, whilst spike pool B spans a small portion of the C terminal domain of S1 and the
entire S2 (AA633-1273) (Figure 1A).

Peptide pools were reconstituted in 50uL DMSO and an equal volume sterile PBS (Gibco).
Aliquots were stored at -20°C. Lot to lot comparisons were performed for different purity pools
(>70% versus >90%) using SARS-Cov-2 vaccinated donors.

IFNγ ELISpot assay
PBMC were resuspended in serum free T-cell assay media (ImmunoSpot) to give a concentration
of 2.5x106/mL and 100 µL was added to each well of the Human IFNγ single color ELISpot plate
(ImmunoSpot). Cells were incubated with 1:1 DMSO:PBS (negative control); the spike A, spike
B, or nucleocapsid peptide pools; or phytohemagglutinin (PHA, positive control). The controls and
antigens were added in 50 µL to each well, where possible in duplicate wells. PHA (Sigma-Aldrich)
was added as a positive control at a final concentration of 5 µg/mL. Peptide pools contained each
peptide at a final concentration of 2 µg/mL. Negative control wells contained the equivalent
volume of DMSO and PBS as the peptide pools. Peptide pools were thawed immediately prior to
use. The plate was incubated at 37oC for 16-20 hours. Plates were developed according to
manufacturer’s instructions and air dried before counting on an ImmunoSpot CoreS6 ELISpot
counter (ImmunoSpot). QC of automated count data was performed by a lab member not involved
in assay set up to minimize operator bias. The background SFU count was subtracted from the
antigen wells spot count and the average SFU result for spike pool A, spike pool B, and

nucleocapsid pool are reported. In some instances, the responses to spike pool A and B are
added together to better reflect responses to the entire spike protein. In cases where there were
no spot responses to antigen, the PHA well was always strongly positive. The median background
in the negative control was 0 SFU/2.5x105 cells (range 0-6). The positive threshold of 6 SFU per
2.5x105 PBMC was determined via receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Selection of ELISpot SFU threshold for positivity
Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed in Prism V8.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc) using the unvaccinated donors with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or
contact with known infected individuals (healthy controls), alongside the 25 convalescent patients.
This was performed individually for spike peptide pool A, spike peptide pool B and the
nucleocapsid peptide pool (Extended Data Figure 2). The impact of altering the mean SFU assay
threshold on clinical sensitivity and specificity was evaluated when utilizing the responses to either
spike pool A or B. The nucleocapsid result was not included with the spike responses as a
response to the nucleocapsid would not be induced to the current spike vaccines.

Whole blood assay and IFNγ ELISA
Overnight incubations with negative control, positive control, S1 and S2 proteins were performed
from donors at three time points (V0, post-V1, and post-V2). Peripheral blood was mixed
thoroughly before aliquoting 1 mL into five sterile tubes with loose fitting lids. For the negative
condition, 20 µL of sterile water is added to the tube. For positive controls, 18 µL of PHA (1 µg/µL
stock) and 2 µL of Cell activation cocktail (Biolegend) are added to the tube. The whole protein
spike S1 subunit, spike S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 are thawed just prior to use and added in 20

plasma isolated and stored at -20°C prior to testing in the QuantiFERON IFNγ ELISA (Qiagen).
Acceptance criteria for the assay specified by manufacturers were always met.

Selection of IFNγ ELISA IU/ml threshold for positivity
ROC curve analysis was performed in Prism V8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc) for IFNγ release
against S1 and the S2 proteins using 7 unvaccinated healthy donors with no known history of
SARS-CoV-2 infection or close contact with known infected individuals, alongside 16 fully
vaccinated donors (11 Moderna and 5 Pfizer). A threshold of >0.3 IU/mL IFNγ was selected. The
combined use of IFNγ results from both S1 and S2 proteins was evaluated to determine the
sensitivity and specificity of the combination assay using a confusion matrix. The upper limit of
detection is 10 IU/mL and samples with ≥10 IU/mL were not further diluted.

ELISA for detection of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
A qualitative ELISA for Human Anti-IgG/A/M SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (The Binding Site) was
performed using donor serum per manufacturer's instructions. Serum was diluted 1:40 prior to the
assay. Plates were read at 450nm using a BioTek Synergy microplate reader. A cut-off calibrator
and a high and a low control were run in each assay. Results were calculated using the equation:
Calibrator coefficient x (Sample OD / Cut-off calibrator OD). A result of <1.0 is interpreted as
negative for anti-spike antibodies, and a result of >1.0 is interpreted as positive for anti-spike
antibodies. The clinical specificity of this assay is reported to be 98.4% [95% CI, 96.6–99.3%],
and sensitivity 94.7% [95% CI, 90.9–97.2%].2

Variant modeling
Spike protein was modeled using Pymol version 2.4.1 and the protein data bank trimeric spike
protein structure 7DX0 in which one of the spike monomers’ receptor binding domains adopts the

“up” conformation3. In some cases, specific spike variant residues were not modeled in the original
structure and adjacent residues were highlighted as representative. In all protein sequence
representations, the abbreviations are as follows. Spike: Ss, single sequence; NTD, N terminaldomain; RBD, receptor binding domain; SD1-2, subdomain 1 subdomain 2; FP, fusion peptide;
HR1, heptad repeat 1; CH, central helix; CD, connector domain; HR2, heptad repeat 2; TM,
transmembrane domain; IC, intracellular domain. Nucleocapsid protein: NTD, N terminal domain;
RBD, RNA binding domain; CTD, C terminal domain; DD, dimerization domain.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism V8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc). Normality of data
was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Log transformation was performed where appropriate
for non-normally distributed data. Where distribution remained non-normal, non-parametric tests
were performed. Parametric tests were performed where data was normally distributed.
Evaluation of differences between matched pairs was performed using the Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed-ranks test and the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The differences
between unmatched groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Mann Whitney U
test or a paired t test. For analysis of ELISpot responses to variant pools, only responses for which
there were >6 SFU were included in the statistical analysis.
