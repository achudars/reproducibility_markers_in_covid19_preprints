Abstract
The main protease (3CL Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, is an
essential enzyme for viral replication, possessing an unusual catalytic dyad composed of His41
and Cys145. A long-standing question in the field has been what the protonation states of the
ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active site cavity are. Here, we present the roomtemperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro from SARS-CoV-2, which allows direct determination
of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states. The catalytic site natively adopts a
zwitterionic reactive state where His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, and Cys145
is in the negatively charged thiolate state. The neutron structure also identified the protonation
states of other amino acid residues, mapping electrical charges and intricate hydrogen bonding
networks in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro active site cavity and dimer interface. This structure
highlights the ability of neutron protein crystallography for experimentally determining
protonation states at near-physiological temperature – the critical information for structure-assisted
and computational drug design.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19, a deadly disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), is a pandemic of extraordinary proportions, disrupting
social life, travel, and the global economy. The development of vaccines and therapeutic
intervention measures promises to mitigate the spread of the virus and to alleviate the burdens
COVID-19 has caused in many communities in recent months.1-6 SARS-CoV-2 is a singlestranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome comprised of around 30,000 nucleotides. The
viral replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that consist of
individual viral proteins essential for replication.7,8 Each polyprotein must be processed into
individual functional proteins – a vital step in the virus life cycle. This is accomplished by a
chymotrypsin-like protease, 3CL Mpro or main protease, a hydrolase enzyme that cleaves peptide
bonds. The proper functioning of 3CL Mpro is indispensable for SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas
its inhibition leads to the inability to produce mature infectious virions. Thus, the enzyme is
considered a promising target for the design and development of SARS-CoV-2 specific protease
inhibitors and for repurposing existing clinical drugs.9-15
SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro is a cysteine protease16,17 and is catalytically active as a
homodimer (Figure 1). Its amino acid sequence is 96% homologous to the earlier SARS-CoV 3CL
Mpro, and the catalytic efficiencies of the two enzymes are similar.10,11,18-20 The ~34 kDa enzyme
has three distinct domains – catalytic domains I (residues 8-101) and II (residues 102-184), and
the α-helical domain III (residues 201-303), which is required for protein dimerization.10,11
Importantly, the monomeric enzyme shows no catalytic activity, as was demonstrated for SARSCoV 3CL Mpro.21-24 The catalytic site of 3CL Mpro employs a non-canonical Cys145-His41 dyad,
thought to be assisted by a water molecule hydrogen bonded to the catalytic histidine.18,25 The
cysteine thiol group functions as the nucleophile during the first step of the hydrolysis reaction by
attacking the carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond. The enzyme recognizes a general amino
acid sequence of Leu-Gln↓Ser-Ala-Gly, where ↓ marks the cleavage site, but displays some
substrate sequence promiscuity. The active site cavity is located on the surface of the protease and
can bind substrate residues in positions P1’ through P5 in the substrate binding subsites S1ʹ through
S5ʹ, respectively (Figure 2). Subsites S1, S2 and S4 are shaped into well-formed binding pockets,
whereas S1ʹ, S3, and S5 are located on the protein surface with no defined shape. The peptide bond

cleavage occurs between the substrate residues at the C-terminal position P1ʹ and N-terminal
position P1.
Current structure-assisted drug design efforts are mainly directed towards reversible and
irreversible covalent inhibitors that mimic the protease substrate binding to subsites S1ʹ-S5 in the
active site cavity,9-12,14 whereas the dimer interface can also be explored for the design of
dimerization inhibitors.26,27 Knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro active site cavity structure
at an atomic level of detail, including the actual locations of hydrogen (H) atoms, can provide
critical information to improve rational drug design. The presence or absence of H atoms at specific
sites on amino acid residues determines their protonation states and, thus, their electrical charges,
defining the electrostatics and hydrogen bonding interactions. Of note, half of all atoms in protein
and small-molecule drugs are H. X-ray crystallography is typically the standard experimental
method for structure-assisted drug design but is unable to reliably locate H atoms in biological
macromolecules, leaving significant gaps in our understanding of biological function and drug
binding.28 Electron clouds scatter X-rays, thus scattering power is determined by the number of
electrons present in an atom, i.e. by its atomic number. H, with just a single electron that often
participates in highly polarized chemical bonds, is the weakest possible X-ray scatterer and
consequently is invisible in X-ray structures with a few exceptions beyond subatomic resolution.2931

In contrast, atomic nuclei scatter neutrons, where the scattering power of neutrons is independent

of the atomic number. Deuterium (D), a heavy isotope of hydrogen (H), scatters neutrons just as
well as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Neutron crystallography is capable of accurately determining
positions of H and D atoms and visualizing hydrogen bonding interactions at moderate
resolutions,32-35 where X-rays cannot locate the functional H atoms.29 Moreover, unlike X-rays,36
neutrons cause no direct or indirect radiation damage to protein crystals, permitting diffraction
data collection at near-physiological (room) temperature and avoiding possible artifacts induced
by the use of cryoprotectant chemicals required for X-ray cryo-crystallographic measurements.
We produced neutron-quality crystals of the ligand-free SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro at pH 6.6
and obtained a room-temperature neutron structure of the enzyme refined jointly with a roomtemperature X-ray dataset collected from the same crystal (Figure 1).37 We accurately determined
the locations of exchangeable H atoms that were observed as Ds attached to electronegative atoms
such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms. Our experimental observations identified the protonation

states of ionizable amino acid residues allowing us to accurately map hydrogen bonding networks
in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro active site cavity and throughout the enzyme structure. Neutron
diffraction data were collected from an H/D-exchanged SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro crystal at pD 7.0
(pD = pH +0.4) to 2.5 Å resolution. In neutron crystallographic experiments, protein crystals are
usually H/D exchanged with the heavy water (D2O) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the
diffraction pattern as H has a large incoherent scattering cross section that increases background.

(https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/) and are therefore observed in the neutron
scattering length (or nuclear) density maps as troughs. At moderate resolutions, the negative
neutron scattering length of H leads to the density cancellation phenomenon observed for CH, CH2
and CH3 groups as H atoms attached to carbon atoms cannot exchange with D. Conversely, D has
a coherent neutron scattering length of +6.671 fm and, thus, is observed as peaks in nuclear density
maps. Because D atoms scatter neutrons just as well as other protein atoms, they can be directly
detected in neutron structures at moderate resolutions as low as 2.5-2.6 Å.38,39 Notably, sulfur (S)
has a coherent neutron scattering length of +2.847 fm, less than half the magnitude of that for
carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and deuterium. Consequently, deprotonated thiol groups (S–) in cysteine
(Cys) and side chain S atoms in methionine (Met) residues are often not visible in nuclear density
maps.

RESULTS
Protonation states of the catalytic site and nearby residues. The electron density for the
catalytic site and the nearby residues of SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro is shown in Figure 3A. Although
hydrogen bonding interactions can be inferred from the distances between the heavy atoms, the
locations of H atoms, and the protonation states of the amino acid residues can only be assumed.
Instead, the nuclear density map shown in Figure 3B displays the actual positions of exchanged D
atoms, accurately visualizing hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. In the neutron structure, we
observed that the catalytic Cys145 thiol is in the deprotonated negatively charged thiolate state.
In contrast, located 3.9 Å away from Cys145, the catalytic residue His41 is protonated on both
Nδ1 and Nε2 nitrogen atoms of the imidazole side chain and is therefore positively charged (Figure

S1). As a result, the catalytic site natively adopts the zwitterionic reactive state required for
catalysis.19,20,41 His41 is strongly hydrogen bonded to a water molecule (D2Ocat) that presumably
plays the role of the third catalytic residue18,25 from a canonical catalytic triad, stabilizing the
charge and position of the His41 imidazolium ring. The Nδ1-D…OD2O distance is 1.7 Å. The
position of the D2Ocat molecule is stabilized by several more, but possibly weaker, hydrogen bonds
with His41 main chain, His164, and Asp187. His164 is doubly protonated and positively charged;
it donates a D in a hydrogen bond with the Thr175 hydroxyl within the interior of the protein. As
expected, Asp187 is not protonated and is negatively charged, and participates in a strong salt
bridge with Arg40. His163 positioned near the catalytic Cys145 is singly protonated and
uncharged, making a hydrogen bond with the phenolic side chain of Tyr161 (Figure S1). The main
chain D atoms of Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 comprising the oxyanion hole are also readily
visible in the nuclear density (Figure 3B).
Substrate binding subsite S1. The P1 group of a substrate, usually Gln, binds in a rather peculiar
substrate binding subsite S1 (Figure 4A). From one side, it is flanked by residues 140-144, making
a turn that creates the oxyanion hole and, on the opposite side, by Met165, Glu166, and His172.
The back wall of subsite S1 is created by the side chains of Phe140 and His163. Interestingly, the
N-terminus of Ser1ʹ of the second monomer within the active 3CL Mpro homodimer reaches in to
cap the subsite S1 from the top. In our neutron structure, the N-terminal amine is the protonated,
positively charged -ND3+ ammonium cation. It forms three hydrogen bonds, one each with the
main chain carbonyl of Phe140, the side chain carboxylate of Glu166, and a D2O molecule. Both
histidine residues, His163 and His172, in this subsite are singly protonated and neutral (Figure
S1). The deprotonated Nδ1 of His172 is hydrogen bonded with the main chain amide nitrogen of
Gly138 with an N…D distance of 2.2 Å, whereas the protonated Nε2 makes a long, possibly weak,
hydrogen bond interaction with the Glu166 carboxylate with the D…O distance of 2.5 Å.
Substrate binding subsite S2. Subsite S2 is more hydrophobic than subsite S1, as it binds the
hydrophobic residues Leu or Phe in substrate position P2 (Figure 4B). Subsite S2 is flanked by the
π-systems of His41 and the main chains connecting Asp187, Arg188, and Gln189. It is capped by
Met165 whereas Met49, situated on the short P2 helix spanning residues Ser46 through Leu50,
adopts a conformation impeding the entrance to this site. Met49 appears to be conformationally
flexible, vacating its position in the ligand-free enzyme to allow various P2 groups to occupy this

subsite when inhibitors bind.9-11 Tyr54 serves as the base of subsite S2, and its phenolic hydroxyl
group donates its D in a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Asp187.
Substrate binding subsites S3-S5. Among the substrate binding subsites S3, S4, and S5, only
subsite S4 has a well-defined binding pocket architecture. Subsites S3 and S5 are on the protein
surface, fully exposed to the bulk solvent, and have ill-defined borders. Subsite S3 is located
between residues Glu166 and Gln189 that are >9 Å apart. Subsite S5 is between Pro168 of the βhairpin flap, spanning residues Met165 through His172, and the P5 loop consisting of residues
Thr190 through Ala194 (Figure 2). Subsite S4 is formed between a long loop spanning residues
Phe185 through Ala194 that acts as its base and the β-hairpin flap on the top. The loop turns 180°
at Gln189, with its secondary structure being stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the Gln192
side chain amide and the main chain atoms of Val186. The side chains of Leu167 and Phe185 form
the back wall of this site in the protein interior, creating a deep, mainly hydrophobic pocket (Figure
4C).
Dimer interface. The two protomers in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro homodimer interact through
an extensive dimer interface. Protomer 1 (unprimed residue numbers) forms elaborate networks of
hydrogen bonding interactions with N-terminal residues 1ʹ-16ʹ, a β-strand with residues 118ʹ-125ʹ,
and a loop containing residues 137ʹ-142ʹ of protomer 2 (primed residue numbers, Figure 5). There
are also many hydrophobic interactions within the dimer interface. The N-termini of the two
protomers meet at the start of a short α-helix spanning residues Gly11-Cys16 and Gly11ʹ-Cys16ʹ
to form several hydrogen bonds involving the main chain and side chain atoms of Ser10, Gly11,
Ser10ʹ, Gly11ʹ and Glu14ʹ (Figure S2A). The N-terminal loop then extends across the face of the
opposite protomer to subsite S1. Here, Ala7ʹ, Phe8ʹ, Arg4ʹ, and Ser1ʹ are observed making
hydrogen bonds with Val125, Glu290, Lys137, Phe140, and Glu166. Ser123ʹ and Asn119ʹ of
protomer 2 β-strand containing residues 118ʹ-125ʹ have direct hydrogen bonds and water-mediated
interactions with the C-terminal residues of protomer 1, in addition to the reciprocal hydrogen
bonds between Val125’ and Ala7 formed due to the two-fold symmetry of the enzyme dimer
(Figure S2B). Similar reciprocity of hydrogen bonding is found for the loop consisting of residues
137ʹ-144ʹ in protomer 2 that interacts with the N-terminal residues Ser1 and Arg4 of monomer 1.
Also, the side chain hydroxyl of Ser139ʹ makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain amide of
Gln299 (Figure S2C).

Protonation states of Cys residues. The SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro structure contains twelve Cys
residues spread throughout the sequence. The reason for such a large number of cysteines within
the enzyme sequence and their functional roles are unknown, except for the catalytic Cys145. By
examining the nuclear density, we were able to establish the protonation states of all Cys residues
in the structure (Figure S3 and S4). The side chains of residues Cys16, Cys85, Cys117, Cys156,
Cys160, Cys265, and Cys300, are protonated thiol groups. Conversely, the remaining Cys residues
– Cys22, Cys38, Cys44, Cys128 and Cys145 – contain deprotonated thiolates. Accordingly,
because we can unambiguously differentiate between seven protonated and five deprotonated Cys
side chains, this provides strong evidence that the catalytic Cys145 is in the reactive deprotonated
negatively charged thiolate form.

DISCUSSION
Neutron crystallography is the only technique capable of accurately determining the
positions of H (and D) atoms in biological macromolecules without causing radiation damage to
the samples at near-physiological temperature. We have succeeded in determining a roomtemperature neutron structure of the homodimeric SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro enzyme mapping the
protonation states of amino acid residues in the active site cavity and throughout the protein
structure. The neutron structure also reveals the elaborate hydrogen bonding networks formed in
the catalytic site, including those in the six substrate binding subsites, and throughout the dimer
interface. Protonation states are determined by the locations of H atoms, observed in the neutron
structure as Ds after the H/D exchange was performed. Also, protonation states establish the
electrical charges and therefore determine the electrostatic environment in the protein, essential
information for the structure-assisted and computational drug design. The catalytic dyad is
observed in the reactive zwitterionic state in the crystal at pD 7.0, having a deprotonated negatively
charged Cys145 and doubly protonated positively charged His41, instead of the catalytically
resting (non-reactive) state40 in which both catalytic residues are neutral (i.e., protonated Cys145
and singly protonated His41). His41 is hydrogen bonded to the catalytic water molecule that is
held in place by interactions with the doubly protonated His164 and negatively charged Asp87.
The substrate binding subsite S1 contains the protonated positively charged N-terminal amine from
protomer 2 and neutral His163. The non-protonated Nε2 of His163 is exposed and can be utilized

as a hydrogen bond acceptor by an inhibitor P1 substituent. In the hydrophobic subsite S2, the
Tyr54 hydroxyl can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor for a P2 substituent with a hydrogen bond
donor functionality. Consequently, specific protease inhibitor design needs to consider the
observed charge distribution in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro active site cavity.
We also accurately mapped the hydrogen bonding networks within the dimer interface of
SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro. Significantly, the N-terminal residues between Ser1 and Cys16 (and
Ser1’ and Cys16’) account for the most hydrogen bonds between the two protomers. There are
thirteen direct hydrogen bonds formed by each N-terminus interacting with the opposite protomer.
Ser1 is an essential residue for building the correct architecture of substrate binding subsite S1.
Truncation of the first four N-terminal residues in SARS-CoV 3CL Mpro has previously shown to
disrupt dimerization and dramatically diminish enzyme activity.22 We, therefore, suggest that the
enzyme area that interacts with residues 1 through 16 from the other protomer may be the most
promising part of the dimer interface for designing SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro-specific dimerization
inhibitors, as was also proposed for SARS-CoV enzyme.41,42

CONCLUSION
We have successfully determined the neutron structure of the ligand-free SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro
at near-physiological (room) temperature and mapped the locations of H atoms (observed as D) in
the enzyme. Thus, protonation states and electrical charges of the ionizable residues have been
accurately resolved. Establishing the electrostatics in the enzyme active site cavity and at the dimer
interface is critical information to guide the structure-assisted and computational drug design of
protease inhibitors, specifically targeting the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2.

Cloning, expression, and purification of SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro. The 3CL Mpro (Nsp5 Mpro)
from SARS-CoV-2 was cloned into pD451-SR plasmid harboring kanamycin resistance (ATUM,
Newark, CA), expressed and purified according to the procedure published elsewhere.25 To make
the authentic the N-terminus of 3CL Mpro, the enzyme sequence is flanked by the maltose binding
protein (MBP) followed by the protease autoprocessing site SAVLQ↓SGFRK (down arrow
indicates the autocleavage site) which corresponds to the cleavage position between NSP4 and
NSP5 in the viral polyprotein. To form the authentic C-terminus, the enzyme construct codes for
the human rhinovirus 3C (HRV-3C) protease cleavage site (SGVTFQ↓GP) connected to a 6xHis
tag. The N-terminal flanking sequence is autocleaved during the expression in E. coli (BL21 DE3),
whereas the C-terminal flanking sequence is removed by the treatment with HRV-3C protease
(Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For crystallization, the authentic 3CL Mpro is concentrated to
~4 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 8.0.
Crystallization. The methodology for growing large crystals of 3CL Mpro suitable for neutron
diffraction is described as follows. Initial protein crystallization conditions were discovered by
screening conducted at the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute (HWI).43 Crystal
aggregates were reproduced using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using 25% PEG3350,
0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5. Microseeding using Hampton Research Seed Beads™ was performed to
grow neutron-quality crystals in Hampton 9-well plates and sandwich box set-ups with 200 µL
drops of protein mixed with 18% PEG3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 3% DMSO at a 1:1 ratio seeded
with 1 µL of microseeds at a 1:500 dilution. This condition produced a final pH in the
crystallization drop of 6.6 as measured by microelectrode. The crystal tray used to harvest a crystal
for neutron diffraction was incubated initially at 18°C then gradually lowered to 10°C over several
weeks. The crystal grew to final dimensions of ~2x0.8x0.2 mm (~0.3 mm3) in a triangular platelike morphology. The crystal was mounted in a quartz capillary accompanied with 18% PEG3350
prepared with 100% D2O and allowed to H/D exchange for several days before starting the neutron
data collection.
Neutron diffraction data collection. The large crystal was screened for diffraction quality using
a broad-bandpass Laue configuration using neutrons from 2.8 to 10 Å at the IMAGINE instrument
at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.44-46 Neutron
diffraction data were collected using the Macromolecular Neutron Diffractometer (MaNDi)

instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).45,47-49 The crystal was held still at room
temperature, and diffraction data were collected for 24 hours using all neutrons between 2-4 Å.
Following this, the crystal was rotated by Δϕ = 10°, and a subsequent data frame was collected
again for 24 hours. A total of twenty-three data frames were collected in the final neutron dataset.
Diffraction data were reduced using the Mantid package, with integration carried out using threedimensional TOF profile fitting.50 Wavelength normalization of the Laue data was performed
using the Lauenorm program from the Lauegen suite.51,52 The neutron data collection statics are
shown in Table S1.
X-ray diffraction data collection. The room-temperature diffraction dataset was collected from
the same crystal used for the neutron data collection using a Rigaku HighFlux HomeLab
instrument equipped with a MicroMax-007 HF X-ray generator and Osmic VariMax optics. The
diffraction images were obtained using an Eiger R 4M hybrid photon counting detector.
Diffraction data were integrated using the CrysAlis Pro software suite (Rigaku Inc., The
Woodlands, TX). Diffraction data were then reduced and scaled using the Aimless53 program from
the CCP4 suite54; molecular replacement using PDB code 6WQF25 was then performed with
Molrep54 from the CCP4 program suite. The protein structure was first refined against the X-ray
using Phenix.refine from the Phenix55 suite of programs and the Coot56 molecular graphics
program to obtain an accurate model for the subsequent X-ray/neutron joint refinement. The
geometry of the final model was then carefully checked with Molprobity.57 The X-ray data
collection statics are shown in Table S1.
Joint X-ray/neutron refinement. The joint X-ray/neutron refinement of ligand-free 3CL Mpro
was performed using nCNS58,59 and the structure was manipulated in Coot.56 After initial rigidbody refinement, several cycles of positional, atomic displacement parameter, and occupancy
refinement were performed. The structure was checked for the correctness of side-chain
conformations, hydrogen bonding, and orientations of D2O water molecules, which were built
based on the mFo-DFc difference neutron scattering length density maps. The 2mFo-DFc and
mFo-DFc neutron scattering length density maps were then examined to determine the correct
orientations of hydroxyl (Ser, Thr, Tyr), thiol (Cys) and ammonium (Lys) groups, and protonation
states of the enzyme residues. The protonation states of some disordered side chains could not be
obtained directly and remained ambiguous. All water molecules were refined as D2O. Initially,

positions in 3CL Mpro were modeled as D atoms, and then the occupancies of those atoms were
refined individually within the range of −0.56 (pure H) to 1.00 (pure D). Before depositing the
neutron structure to the PDB, a script was run that converts a record for the coordinates of a D
atom into two records corresponding to an H and a D partially occupying the same site, both with
positive partial occupancies that add up to unity. The percent D at a specific site is calculated
according to the following formula: %D = {Occup.(D) + 0.56}/1.56.
Data availability
The coordinates and structure factors for ligand-free SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro have been deposited
in the PDB with accession code 7JUN. Any other relevant data are available from the
corresponding authors upon reasonable request.

Figure 1. Structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro. The catalytically active dimer is shown on the left. The enzyme monomer shown in stick representation with
carbon atoms colored cyan demonstrates that X-ray diffraction only provides the positions of the heavy atoms, i.e. C, N, O, and S. The same monomer
shown on the right with carbon atoms colored green illustrates that neutron diffraction provides accurate positions of all atoms, including hydrogen and
deuterium. Only oxygen atoms (red spheres) are visible for water molecules in the X-ray structure, whereas all three atoms are fully visible in the neutron
structure. The catalytic residues Cys145 and His41 are highlighted in ball-and-stick representation, with carbon atoms shown in magenta.
