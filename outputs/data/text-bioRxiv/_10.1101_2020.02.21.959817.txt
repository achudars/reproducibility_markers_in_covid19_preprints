Abstract

28

Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool revolutionising our insights into viral

29

pathogenesis and vaccine development. Large RNA virus genomes, such as from

30

Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and

31

occasional instability1-3. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform

32

for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality

33

of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA

34

viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families.

35

Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical

36

samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using

37

transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast

38

artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious

39

RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able

40

to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24

41

in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance we

42

describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation

43

and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants - in real-time - during an

44

outbreak.

Main Text

46

Population growth, increased travel and climate change foster epidemic and pandemic threats

47

by (re)emerging RNA viruses. Although black swan events cannot be predicted, our medical

48

sector should be ready to use the latest advancements in science to combat emerging viruses.

49

Within the past decade we have seen outbreaks of Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome

50

coronavirus (MERS-CoV)5, ZIKA virus (ZIKV)6, Ebola virus7, and at the end of 2019,

51

SARS-CoV-2 that was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China4, but meanwhile

52

spread throughout China and beyond. Until now SARS-CoV-2 isolates from China have not

53

been shared with health authorities and the scientific community, although they are urgently

54

needed to build up serological diagnostics, to develop and assess antivirals and vaccines, and

55

to establish appropriate in vivo models. Generation of SARS-CoV-2 from chemically

56

synthesized DNA could bypass the limited availability of virus isolates and would

57

furthermore allow genetic modifications and functional characterization of individual genes.

58

However, although the workhorse E. coli did prove very useful for cloning many viral

59

genomes, it has drawbacks for a number of emerging RNA viruses, including coronaviruses,

60

in terms of assembling and stably maintaining full-length molecular clones.

61

Synthetic genomics is a field that was fuelled by the efforts to create a bacterial cell that is

62

controlled by a synthetic genome 8. Genome-wide reassembly of the ~1.1Mb Mycoplasma

63

genome was first attempted using E. coli as an intermediate host 8, but the maintenance of

64

these 100-kbp DNA fragments appeared to be very difficult in this host. Therefore, the yeast

65

Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen to clone, assemble and even mutagenize entire

66

Mycoplasma genomes

67

Syn3.0, a cell carrying the minimal set of genes allowing its autonomous replication in

68

auxotrophic medium 11. The rationale for using a yeast cloning system is the ability of yeast to

9,10

. This ultimately led to the construction of the Mycoplasma JCVI

69

recombine overlapping DNA fragments in cellulo, which led to the development of a

70

technique called “transformation-associated recombination” (TAR) cloning12.

71

More recently, TAR cloning was successfully applied for the assembly, genetic engineering

72

and rescue of large DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 113,14.

73

While large DNA viruses such as herpesviruses can be rescued by transfecting the entire viral

74

DNA genome into eukaryotic cells, the rescue of RNA viruses requires the transcription of a

75

viral genomic RNA from the cloned DNA template. For coronaviruses that belong to a family

76

of positive-stranded RNA viruses termed Coronaviridae, the generation of full-length

77

molecular clones has long been hampered by the extraordinary genome size (27-31 kb) and

78

occasional instability of cloned DNA in E. coli. It took until 2000/2001 before unconventional

79

approaches, such as cloning in low copy bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or vaccinia

80

virus, or cloning of subgenomic DNA fragments followed by in-vitro ligation, were

81

successful1-3. However, each system has caveats leaving the generation of recombinant

82

coronaviruses cumbersome. We therefore aimed to assess the use of the yeast S. cerevisiae to

83

assemble and maintain genomes of diverse RNA viruses in order to establish a rapid, stable,

84

and universal reverse genetics pipeline for RNA viruses.

85

In an effort to adopt a yeast-based reverse genetics platform to RNA viruses we first tested the

86

Murine hepatitis virus strain A59 containing the gene for the green fluorescent protein (MHV-

87

GFP), which is routinely used in our laboratory and has an established vaccinia virus-based

88

reverse genetics platform15,16. The overall strategy is shown in Fig. 1a. Viral RNA was

89

prepared from MHV-GFP-infected murine 17Cl-1 cells and used to amplify 7 overlapping

90

DNA fragments by RT-PCR together spanning the MHV-GFP genome from nt 2024 to nt

91

29672. Fragments containing the 5’- and 3’-termini were PCR-amplified from the vaccinia

92

virus-cloned genome to include a T7-RNA polymerase promoter and a cleavage site (PacI)

93

following the polyA sequence. Overlaps to the TAR vector pVC604 were included in the

94

primers used to amplify the 5’- and 3’-terminal fragments and the pVC604 backbone that was

95

also generated by PCR (Fig. 1b, Table 1, Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data Figure 1a).

96

All DNA fragments were used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain VL6-48N) and

97

resulting colonies were screened for correct assembly of the YAC containing the MHV

98

genome by multiplex PCRs that covered the junctions of the different fragments. This screen

99

revealed that > 90 % of the clones tested were positive indicating a highly efficient assembly

100

in yeast (Extended Data Figure 1a). To rescue MHV-GFP we randomly chose two clones,

101

purified the YAC, linearized the plasmid using the restriction endonuclease PacI (Extended

102

Data Table 2) and subjected it to T7 RNA polymerase-based in vitro transcription to generate

103

capped viral genomic RNA. This RNA was transfected together with an in vitro transcribed

104

mRNA encoding the MHV nucleocapsid (N) protein into BHK-MHV-N cells as previously

105

described15. Transfected BHK-MHV-N cells were mixed with MHV-susceptible 17Cl-1 cells

106

and cytopathic effect (CPE), virus-induced syncytia, and GFP-expressing cells were readily

107

detectable for both clones within 48 hours, indicating successful recovery of infectious virus

108

(Fig. 1c). Finally, we assessed the replication kinetics of the recovered viruses, which were

109

indistinguishable compared to the parental MHV-GFP (Fig. 1d).

110

To address if the synthetic genomics platform can be applied to other coronaviruses, and if it

111

can be used for rapid mutagenesis, we used a molecular BAC clone of MERS-CoV17. We

112

PCR-amplified eight subgenomic overlapping DNA fragments covering the entire MERS-

113

CoV genome (Figure 2a, Extended Data Figure 1b, Extended Data Table 1). The 5’- and 3’-

114

terminal DNA fragments contained the T7-RNA polymerase promoter upstream the MERS-

115

CoV 5’-end and a restriction endonuclease cleavage site MluI downstream the polyA

116

sequence, and overlapping sequences with the TAR plasmid pVC604. To mutagenize the

117

MERS-CoV clone and introduce the GFP gene, fragment 7 was modified to overlap with the

118

PCR-amplified GFP gene. Following transformation almost all YAC clones were positive for

119

the junctions indicating a successful assembly (Figure 2a, Extended Data Figure 1b). Virus

120

rescue from cloned DNA was performed as described previously17 and virus-induced CPE

121

became apparent in VeroB4 cells inoculated with recovered recombinant MERS-CoV (Fig.

122

2b). Importantly, we could readily detect green fluorescent VeroB4 cells that had been

123

infected with recovered MERS-CoV-GFP demonstrating that the synthetic genomics platform

124

is suitable to genetically modify coronavirus genomes (Fig. 2b). As expected replication

125

kinetics of recombinant MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-GFP were slightly reduced compared to

126

cell-culture-adapted MERS-CoV-EMC (Fig. 2c).

127

Having shown that the TAR cloning approach is robust and reproducible, we aimed to

128

thoroughly evaluate the system concerning stability of cloned sequences, the range of

129

applicability to other virus genomes, and if molecular clones can even be generated from

130

clinical samples. The yeast clones containing YACs encoding MHV-GFP and MERS-CoV

131

were passaged 15-17 times followed by re-sequencing. Results of this experiment were very

132

supportive of the yeast-based platform (Extended Data Table 3), since the genomes could be

133

stably maintained and no mutations arose. We then embarked on cloning a number of other

134

coronaviruses (HCoV-229E2, HCoV-HKU1; GenBank: NC_006577, MERS-CoV-Riyadh-

135

1734-2015; GenBank: MN481979) and viruses of other families, such as ZIKV (family

136

Flaviviridae, GenBank: KX377337) and human respiratory-syncytial-virus (hRSV; family

137

Paramyxoviridae) (Table 1) that are known to be difficult to clone and stably maintain in E.

138

coli. As shown in Extended data Figure 1d-h, we followed the same strategy to prepare the

139

genome termini in cloned plasmids to include genetic elements that are later needed for virus

140

rescue (e.g. T7-RNA polymerase promoter, cleavages sites or ribozyme elements) and

141

produced a set of overlapping DNA fragments covering the rest of the genome. This strategy

142

proved to be successful irrespectively of the source of virus or nucleic acid template or the

143

number of DNA fragments that were used for the one-step assembly in yeast. Of note, we

144

were also able to clone hRSV-B, without any prior information on the virus genotype, directly

145

from a clinical sample (nasopharyngeal aspirate) by designing RSV consensus primers to

146

amplify 4 overlapping DNA fragments (sequence submitted to GenBank). Collectively, these

147

results demonstrate the synthetic genomics platform provides the technical advance to rapidly

148

generate molecular clones of diverse RNA viruses by using viral isolates, cloned DNA,

149

synthetic DNA, and even clinical samples as starting material.

150

The appearance of a novel CoV in China at the end of 2019 prompted us to go a step further

151

and to test the applicability of our synthetic genomics platform to reconstruct the virus based

152

on its released genome sequence and chemically synthesized DNA fragments. Notably, at the

153

time when the first genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were released (Jan 10/11th, 2020) no

154

virus isolate has been made available and it took until the end of January 2020 when

155

successful

156

(https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/australian-lab-cultures-new-coronavirus-as-

157

infections-climb-67031). We fragmented the genome into 12 subgenomic DNA fragments

158

ranging in size between 0.5-3.4 kbp (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Figure 1i, Extended Data Tables

159

1, 4). In parallel, we also aimed to generate a SARS-CoV-2 expressing GFP that could be

160

valuable to facilitate the establishment of serological diagnostics (e.g. virus neutralization

161

assay) and detection in cell culture. To do this we divided fragment 11 into 3 sub-fragments

162

(Fig. 3a, Extended Data Figure 1i, Extended Data Tables 1, 4) to include the GFP sequence,

163

which was inserted in frame within the ORF7a. We noticed at the 5’ end of the reported

164

SARS-CoV-2 sequence that nucleotides 3-5 (5’-AUUAAAGG; Genbank MN996528.1) were

165

different compared to the closely related SARS-CoV (5’-AUAUUAGG; GenBank

166

AY291315) and to the even more closely related bat SARS-related CoVs ZXC21 and ZC45

167

(5’-AUAUUAGG)18, and that for all three the 5’-end has been experimentally determined by

168

5’-RACE4,18,19. Therefore, we designed three 5’-end versions of fragment 1 containing the

169

reported SARS-CoV-2 sequence (fragment 1.3; 5’-AUUAAAGG), a version modified by 3

170

nucleotides (fragment 1.1; 5’-AUAUUAGG), and a version containing the 124 5’-terminal

nucleotides spanning the first four 5’-terminal stem-loop structures of SARS-CoV (fragment

172

1.2; Fig. 3b). Notably, nucleotide differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV within

173

this region are in agreement with the predicted RNA secondary structures (Fig. 3b).

174

We ordered the synthetic DNA constructs on January 14th (Fig. 3d, Extended data Table 4,

175

Extended Data Document 1), and until February 4th 12 of 14 constructs were delivered as

176

sequence-confirmed plasmids. However, fragments 5 and 7 turned out to be problematic to

177

clone in E. coli and could not be delivered. Since we received at the same time SARS-CoV-2

178

viral RNA obtained from an isolate of a Munich patient (SARS-CoV-2/München-

179

1.1/2020/929), we decided to amplify the regions of fragments 5 and 7 by RT-PCR. TAR

180

cloning was immediately initiated, and for all 6 SARS-CoV-2 constructs we obtained

181

correctly assembled molecular clones (3 versions of the 5’-end and each version with and

182

without GFP; Extended Data Fig. 2). Since sequence verification was not possible within this

183

short time frame, we randomly selected two clones for each construct for rescuing

184

recombinant rSARS-CoV-2 and rSARS-CoV-2-GFP. YAC DNA were isolated, in vitro

185

transcribed and the resulting RNAs electroporated together with an mRNA encoding the

186

SARS-CoV-2 N protein into BHK-21 and, in parallel, into BHK-SARS-N cells expressing the

187

SARS-CoV N protein20. The BHK-21 and BHK-SARS-N cells were seeded over VeroE6

188

cells and at two days post electroporation we observed green fluorescent signals in cells that

189

received the GFP-encoding SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Indeed supernatants transferred to fresh

190

VeroE6 cells contained infectious recombinant viruses for almost all recombinant rSARS-

191

CoV-2 and rSARS-CoV-GFP constructs (Extended Data Fig. 2). As shown in Figure 3c for

192

SARS-CoV-2 clones 1.1, 2.2, and 3.1, plaques were detectable on VeroE6 cells that were

193

inoculated with supernatants containing the RNA-electroporated cells, demonstrating the

194

infectious virus has been recovered for recombinant rSARS-CoV-2 and for the variants

195

containing modified 5’-termini. Similarly, we could detect green fluorescent cells on VeroE6

196

monolayers that were inoculated with supernatants from RNA-electroporated cells of rSARS-

197

CoV-2-GFP clones 4.1, 5.2 and 6.1, demonstrating that recombinant GFP-expressing viruses

198

have been recoverd for all 5’-end variants. This result demonstrates the full functionality of

199

the SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system and also shows that the 5’-ends of SARS-CoV and

200

bat SARS-related CoVs ZXC21 and ZC45 are compatible with the replication machinery of

201

SARS-CoV-2.

202

We expect that the fast, robust and versatile synthetic genomics platform we describe here

203

will provide new insights into the molecular biology and pathogenesis of a number of

204

emerging RNA viruses and will specifically facilitate the molecular characterization of the

205

novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Although homologous recombination in yeast has already

206

been used for the generation of a number of molecular virus clones in the past13,14,21, we

207

present here a thorough evaluation of the feasibility of this approach to rapidly generate full-

208

length cDNAs for large RNA viruses that have a known history of instability in E. coli. We

209

show that one main advantage of the TAR cloning system is that the viral genomes can be

210

fragmented to at least 14 overlapping fragments and re-assembled with remarkable efficacy

211

(usually >90% of the clones are correct). This allowed us to complete the cloning and rescue

212

of rSARS-CoV-2 and rSARS-CoV-2-GFP within one week. It should also be noted that we

213

see considerable potential to reduce the time of DNA synthesis. Currently, synthetic DNA

214

fragments are still routinely cloned in E. coli, which turned out to be problematic for SARS-

215

CoV-2 fragments 5 and 7. We could however use 4 and 3 shorter dsDNA parts of fragments 5

216

and 7, respectively, that we received, to assemble the full-length fragments 5 and 7 by TAR

217

cloning which is an additional proof of the superior cloning efficiency of our yeast system

218

versus E. coli-based systems. This allowed us to generate a molecular clone of SARS-CoV-2

219

by using exclusively chemically synthesized DNA, and the rescue of this version is currently

220

in progress.

221

The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the need for preparedness to rapidly respond to

222

emerging virus threats. While the availability of SARS-CoV-2 isolates is still limited, full

223

virus genome sequences were disclosed very early during the outbreak. The rapidity of our

224

synthetic genomics approach to generate SARS-CoV-2 and the applicability to other

225

emerging RNA viruses make this system an attractive alternative to provide infectious virus

226

to health authorities and diagnostic laboratories without the need to have access to clinical

227

samples. Finally, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is ongoing, we expect to see sequence

228

variations and possibly phenotypic changes of evolving SARS-CoV-2 in the human host.

229

With the synthetic genomics platform it is now possible to introduce such sequence variations

230

into the infectious clone and to functionally characterize SARS-CoV-2 evolution in real-time.

a, Schematic representation of the general workflow of TAR cloning and virus rescue. In-

331

yeast assembly require the delivery of overlapping DNA fragments covering the viral genome

332

and a TAR vector into yeast in one transformation event. Transformed DNA fragments are

333

joined by homologous recombination in yeast generating a YAC-cloned full-length viral

334

genomic cDNA. The in vitro production of infectious capped viral RNA starts with the

335

isolation of the YAC, followed by plasmid linearization to provide DNA template for run-off

124 nucleotides exchanged by the corresponding 5’-terminal sequence of SARS-CoV

518

(GISAID: EPI_ISL_402119) (synthetic fragment 1.3; constructs 3 and 6). After yeast

519

transformation, 10 colonies were randomly picked for each of the six constructs and all the

520

junctions bridging the overlapping fragments were verified by multiplex PCR. For each

521

construct, two clones (x.1 and x.2) were randomly selected and YAC DNAs were isolated (12

522

clones in total). RNAs were generated by in vitro transcription and electroporated together

523

with an mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 N protein either into BHK-21 cells (12 clones) or

BHK-SARS-N cells (cells expressing the SARS-CoV N protein) (6 clones). Electroporated

cells were then co-cultivated with susceptible VeroE6 cells to rescue the recombinant viruses.
