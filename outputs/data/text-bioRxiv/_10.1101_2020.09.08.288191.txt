Abstract

4

enveloped RNA virus and the etiological agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient

5

replication of the virus relies on the activity of nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), a major virulence

6

factor shown to facilitate suppression of host gene expression through promotion of host mRNA

7

degradation and interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Here, we report the crystal structure

8

of the globular domain of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, encompassing residues 13 to 127, at a resolution

9

of 1.65 Å. Our structure features a six-stranded, capped β-barrel motif similar to Nsp1from

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded,

10

SARS-CoV and reveals how variations in amino acid sequence manifest as distinct structural

11

features. Through comparative analysis of structural homologues, we identified a topological

12

signature associated with this protein fold that facilitated modeling of Nsp1 from MERS-CoV.

13

Combining our high-resolution crystal structure with existing data on the C-terminus of Nsp1

14

from SARS-CoV-2, we propose a model of the full-length protein. Our results provide

15

unparalleled insight into the molecular structure of a major pathogenic determinant of SARS-

16

CoV-2.

Introduction

4

2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic. As of September 2020, there have been more than

5

26,000,00 cases of infection reported globally and approximately 860,000 deaths attributed to

6

COVID-19 [1]. The etiological agent of this pandemic has been identified as Severe Acute

7

Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Betacoronavirus genus

8

and closely related to the SARS-CoV that caused the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004 [2, 3].

9

In March of 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus Disease

Coronaviruses infect a diverse array of vertebrates, with infection typically resulting in

10

respiratory disease or gastroenteritis [4]. Their broad host range allows for a substantial

11

reservoir for human infection and mutation facilitates cross-species transmission [5]. There is

12

mounting evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated via mutation and cross-species transmission of

13

a pangolin coronavirus with which it shares ~97% sequence identity [6]. This highlights the

14

dramatic impact that relatively few amino acid substitutions can have in coronaviruses and

15

underscores the urgent need for characterization of these infectious agents at a molecular level.

16

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus with a single-stranded genome

17

approximately 30 kb in size. The genome is 5´-capped and 3´poly-adenylated and the first ~2/3

18

of the genome encode two overlapping reading frames that produce polyprotein 1a and 1ab [7].

19

Downstream of this region, the remaining 1/3 of the genome encodes for structural proteins and a

20

number of ORFs that produce accessory proteins largely of unknown function. Polyprotein 1a

21

and 1ab are large polypeptides that are processed post-translationally by viral-encoded proteases

22

to produce non-structural proteins (nsp) 1-16 [8]. The genome also contains 5´ and 3´

23

untranslated regions (UTRs), the former of which plays a critical role in self-recognition that

24

allows for SARS-CoV-2 protein production to occur unabated while host gene expression is

suppressed [9]. At the core of this mechanism is Nsp1, a 180 amino acid (AA) protein produced

2

via processing of polypeptide 1a and 1ab by the Papain-like protease domain of Nsp3 (Figure

3

1A) [10].

4

Nsp1 mediates a two-pronged approach to suppression of host gene expression. Firstly, it

5

inhibits translation of host proteins during the initiation stage through interaction with the 40S

6

ribosomal subunit. Secondly, Nsp1 promotes the degradation of host mRNA by endonucleolytic

7

cleavage within the 5´UTR, which in turn leads to accelerated Xrn1-mediated mRNA decay [11,

8

12]. Viral mRNAs are able to avoid the fate of host mRNAs through interaction between Nsp1

9

and the stem-loop 1 (SL1) motif found in the viral 5´ UTR [9]. Nsp1 from SARS-CoV has been

10

shown to inhibit the Type I Interferon response in infected cells, allowing for the virus to

11

circumvent the innate immune response [13]. Expression of SARS-CoV Nsp1 has also been

12

shown to induce the production of chemokines, suggesting this protein may play a role in the

13

“cytokine storm”, a maladaptive release of cytokines in response to infection, associated with a

14

number of COVID-19 infections [14, 15]. Thus, Nsp1 has emerged as a major pathogenicity

15

factor that plays a critical role in the coronavirus infection cycle [16]. Deletion or mutation of

16

nsp1 results in viral attenuation in infection models and restores the innate immune response in

17

infected cells [17]. Based on its central role in suppression of the host immune response and

18

essentiality to infection, Nsp1 has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of

19

COVID-19 [16]. A prerequisite to any investigation into possible interventions targeting Nsp1 is

20

high-resolution structural data that can facilitate robust in silico screening. A partial structure

21

corresponding to the N-terminal fragment of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV was resolved by NMR

22

spectroscopy and revealed a unique β-barrel motif. The corresponding domain from SARS-

23

CoV-2 shares 86% sequence identity with its SARS-CoV ortholog, which is a considerable level

1

of sequence diversity compared to many other non-structural proteins encoded by the SARS-

2

CoV-2 genome (e.g. Nsp12 shares 96% identity with SARS-CoV ortholog [18]). This highlights

3

the need for a pursuit of structural characterization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

4

Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structure of the globular N-terminal domain of

5

Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 at 1.65 Å resolution. Our data reveals a high level of structural

6

conservation between Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also some unique structural

7

features that likely contribute to increased stability of the β-barrel fold in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1.

8

Comparative analysis reveals additional structural homologues in Nsp1 proteins from

9

Alphacoronaviruses, despite low levels of shared sequence identity. These results highlight the

10

critical role this unique protein fold plays in facilitating viral infection and suppression of host

11

gene expression.

Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127

15

In pursuit of structural characterization of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 we expressed a

16

codon optimised version of the ORF encoding this protein in E. coli. Using this expression

17

system, we obtained purified full-length Nsp1 after a two-step purification protocol (see details

18

in Material and Methods). However, we were unable to crystallize the full-length Nsp1 protein,

19

likely due to the presence of flexibly disordered regions at the N- and C-termini.

20

Previous studies of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV reported the presence of a distinct globular

21

domain comprised of residues 13 to 127 [19]. To structurally characterise the N-terminal

22

fragment of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 (Nsp113-127), we sub-cloned it and expressed it in E. coli.

23

The expression level of Nsp113-127 was comparable to that of the full-length protein and with this

fragment we obtained well-diffracting crystals in several conditions that enabled structural

2

determination of this portion of Nsp1.

3

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 was determined via molecular replacement

4

using the SARS-CoV Nsp1(PDB: 2HSX) solution structure as the search model and refined to a

5

resolution of 1.65 Å (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contained a single molecule of Nsp113-127.

6

Analysis of the Nsp113-127 structure by PDBePISA revealed the protein has a total solvent-

7

exposed area of 6102 Å2 [20].

8
9

As in the case of SARS-CoV, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 features a unique
topological arrangement resulting in the formation of a six stranded (n = 6) β-barrel that is

10

primarily antiparallel, with the exception of strands β1 (Q15 – V20) and β2 (C51 – V54) (Figure

11

1B). Additional major structural features include α1 (V35 – D48) helix, which is positioned as a

12

cap along one opening of the β-barrel, two 310 helices that run parallel to each other and the β5

13

strand (I95 – Y97) which is not part of the β-barrel but forms a β-sheet interaction with the β4

14

strand (V84 – L92) (Figure 1C).

15

The core of the β-barrel is highly hydrophobic and is mainly comprised of the side chains of

16

thirteen amino acids organized into three layers. The first layer, which is adjacent to α1 helix, is

17

formed by sidechains of residues L16, L18, V69, L88, L107 and L123 (Figure 1D). The opening

18

of the β-barrel at this layer is obstructed by the α1 helix, which contributes the side chain of L46

19

to the centre of this first layer of core hydrophobic residues. The middle layer of the β-barrel is

20

comprised of the side chains of residues V20, L53, I71, V86 and V121, while the bottom layer

21

features residues V84 and L104. Adjacent to this bottom layer are four solvent-exposed

22

residues; E55, R73, E102 and R119 whose sidechains point inward towards the core of the β-

barrel (Figure 1D). Consequently, the hydrophobic core at both ends of the β-barrel is occluded:

2

by the α1 helix on one side and the charged residues (E54, R73, E102, R199) on the other.

3

A distinctive feature of Nsp1 that is evident in the crystal structure of Nsp113-127 is the large

4

number of flexible loops. For one of these loops (A76 – H81), we were unable to resolve the

5

structure due to a lack of interpretable electron density. This region has been previously shown to

6

be highly flexible as evidenced by the multitude of backbone confirmations observed in the

7

NMR structure of SARS-CoV Nsp1 [19]. The positions of other loops in the crystal structure

8

were stabilized via interactions between specific secondary structure elements. Specifically, the

9

two 310 helices are aligned in the crystal structure forming H-bonds between R24 and Q63. This

10

interaction appears to stabilize the position of two of the largest loops in the crystal structure, the

11

β1-α1 (L21 – S34) loop and the β2- β3 (E54 – P67) loop.

12

Electrostatic surface potential analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 structure revealed

13

several regions of charged residue colocalization [21]. The most electronegative and

14

electropositive patches appear adjacent on the Nsp113-127 surface, separated by a small

15

electroneutral region corresponding to the α1 helix. The electropositive patch continues around

16

the surface of the protein, where the R124 residue is localized (Figure 1E). This residue has

17

been shown to be essential for the interaction between Nsp1 and SL1 of the 5´ UTR, implicating

18

this charged surface in RNA binding [9].

Comparison with SARS-CoV Nsp1

21

The overall fold of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 was highly similar to that of the corresponding

22

SARS-CoV Nsp1 fragment in accordance with the significant primary sequence identity shared

23

between the two proteins (Figure 2A). However, detailed comparative analysis revealed several

1

notable differences between the two structures. The SARS-CoV-2 structure of Nsp113-127

2

features two 310 helices, compared to the single one found in SARS-CoV Nsp1. The primary

3

sequence corresponding to the second 310 helix is completely conserved between SARS-CoV-2

4

and SARS-CoV Nsp1 proteins, suggesting this secondary structure element may be transient in

5

nature or influenced by differences elsewhere in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127. The two 310 helices

6

interact with each other through H-bonds in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 but this interaction is

7

notably absent in the NMR structure of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV [19].

8

Two of the most striking differences between the two Nsp1 structures are the extension of β4

9

and the presence of an additional β-strand in the case of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127. Amino acid

10

changes at positions 84 (K to V) and 85 (V to M) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1

11

result in an extension of β4 on the N-terminus by three residues (Figure 2B). This extension

12

results in an increased number of H-bonds formed between β4 and β7 in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1

13

compared to the pairing between β4 and β6 that occurs in SARS-CoV Nsp1. This extension also

14

facilitates the formation of the β5 strand which is absent in SARS-CoV Nsp1. The β5 and β4

15

strands are part of a small β-sheet that stabilizes the loop region between β5 and β6 (β4 and β5 in

16

SARS-CoV Nsp1) (Figure 2B).

17

Comparison of the electrostatic surface potential of Nsp113-127 from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-

18

CoV shows additional differences between the two proteins. The SARS-CoV structure features a

19

single patch of electronegative surface potential opposite a separate patch of electropositive

20

surface potential. These two charged surfaces are oriented 180° opposite one another and there

21

is a ring of electroneutral surface potential separating the two charged surfaces (Figure 2C). The

22

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 structure features an equivalent patch of electronegativity, but the

23

electropositive surface is divided into two by a patch of mild electronegative surface potential.

Mapping the non-conserved residues onto the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 structure revealed that

2

most of the differences are in solvent-exposed residues. Distinct patches of variation are

3

observed immediately adjacent to both ends of β4 and in the loop between β3 and β4 (S74 –

4

H83), where 4 of 9 residues differ between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Figure 3A). The

5

remaining sequence variation is broadly distributed across the Nsp113-127 structure. Residues that

6

contribute to the hydrophobic core of the β -barrel are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and

7

SARS-CoV, suggesting this particular organization is critical to the function of Nsp1.

10

Comparison with other structural homologues
Amino acid sequence-based searches for homologues of Nsp1 reveal a high level of

11

sequence conservation among representatives of Lineage B of Betacoronaviruses, which

12

includes several animal viruses closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Despite the

13

presence of functionally equivalent Nsp1 proteins, no sequence-based homologues of SARS-

14

CoV-2 Nsp1 were detected in other lineages of Betacoronaviruses. This lack of sequence

15

conservation is observed even when comparing SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 to other coronaviruses

16

known to infect humans, including MERS, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1.

17

A search for structural homologues using our high resolution structure of SARS-Cov-2

18

Nsp113-127 identified three closely related structural homologues, all annotated as Nsp1 proteins

19

(Table 2) [22]. Unsurprisingly, the Nsp1 structure from SARS-CoV was identified as the closest

20

homologue, but the search also indicated strong similarity to the Nsp1 proteins from

21

transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). These

22

Alphacoronavirus homologues superimposed with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 with RMSD values

of 2.8 Å and 2.9 Å over 114 and 118 Cα atoms, respectively (Table 2) [23]. Such appreciable

levels of structural conservation, despite the low levels (<15%) of shared sequence identity,

2

between these proteins highlights the plasticity of the unique protein fold found in Coronaviral

3

Nsp1 proteins (Figure 3B).

4

To further examine the plasticity of this fold, we examined the predicted secondary

5

structure of Nsp1 proteins from other coronaviruses known to infect humans (MERS, OC43,

6

HKU1, 229E, NL63). These Nsp1 proteins share minimal primary sequence identity with Nsp1

7

from SARS-CoV-2 and a BLASTP search failed to identify them as homologues (Table S1).

8

Despite the low primary sequence identity, we were able to identify topological fingerprints,

9

regions comprised of 6-7 β-strands and at least one α-helix, in each of the Nsp1 sequences that

10

are indicative of an arrangement capable of forming the capped β-barrel motif observed in the

11

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 crystal structure (Figure S1). We then modeled the region of MERS-

12

CoV Nsp1 identified through this approach using our crystal structure as the threading template.

13

This resulted in a high-scoring (C-score = 0.48) homology model featuring the capped β-barrel

14

motif characteristic of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp113-127 (Figure 3C). Mapping the modest

15

primary sequence conservation between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 onto the homology

16

model revealed it to be distributed throughout the structure (Figure 3C). The β-barrel in the

17

MERS-CoV Nsp1 homology model retains the hydrophobic core observed in SARS-CoV-2,

18

highlighting a level of functional conservation between the two proteins that may not have been

19

R146/K147 dipeptide (R124/K125 in SARS-CoV-2) that has been shown to be involved in

Nsp113-127 structure in context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1

2

Recent cryo-EM data of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 in complex with the 40S ribosome were able

3

to resolve the structure of the C-terminal portion of Nsp1 at a resolution of 2.6 Å [25]. This study

4

confirms the presence of a C-terminal α-helix spanning residues S166 to G179 and revealed a

5

second helix spanning residues Y154 to N160 that was not predicted bioinformatically. The

6

resulting helix-turn-helix motif interacts with the ribosome and anchors Nsp1 to the pre-initiation

7

complex.

8

To place the crystal structure of Nsp113-127 in context of full-length protein we analyzed

9

the amino acid sequence using PSIPRED and DISPRRED3 [26, 27]. These tools predicted the N-

10

terminal 12 residues outside of our structure contained a disordered protein-binding region and a

11

largely unstructured C-terminal domain with the exception of a single predicted α-helix. The

12

presence of large disordered regions adjacent to the globular domain of Nsp1 provide strong

13

rationale for why the full-length protein failed to crystallize.

14

Using our crystal structure data in combination with insights into the C-terminal domain

15

of Nsp1, we generated a homology-based model of the full-length Nsp1 protein. This model

16

maintains the capped β-barrel motif observed in our crystal structure and features a largely

17

disordered linker between the end of the globular domain and the C-terminal helix-turn-helix.

18

The C-terminal domain is shown as extending outward from the core of the structure at the

19

bottom of the β-barrel, at the face opposite of where the α1 helix localizes; however the

20

disordered linker connecting this motif from the rest of the structure suggests that the position of

21

this domain is likely to be highly dynamic and capable of multiple configurations (Figure 4).

22

This predicted full-length structure aligns well with the partial density and model proposed by

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 arrests translation of host proteins through interaction with the 40S

6

ribosome and in doing so suppresses the innate immune response to viral infection. Through

7

interaction with SL1 in the viral 5´UTR, Nsp1 also distinguishes viral transcripts from host

8

transcripts and allows for viral gene expression to continue unabated, highlighting the critical

9

role this nonstructural protein plays in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Nsp1 proteins encoded by

10

representatives of the Coronaviridae family feature significant amino acid sequence diversity,

11

highlighted by the inability to identify homologues via BLAST of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 outside of

12

the B lineage of Betacoronaviruses. Leveraging our high-resolution structural data, we were

13

able to identify additional structural homologues of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, Nsp1 of TGEV and

14

PEDV, with which it shares low levels of sequence identity. This result is in accordance with the

15

recent data demonstrating that Coronaviral Nsp1 proteins exhibit similar function in suppression

16

of host translation [24]. These observations suggest that the distinctive features of the SARS-

17

CoV-2 Nsp1, highlighted by our structural data, may be critical to its function in self-

18

recognition, via interaction with SL1, of viral RNAs and its role in promoting the degradation of

19

host transcripts. This also provides insight into molecular features that could be expected in

20

functionally similar proteins found in other important human pathogens, such as Nsp1 from

21

MERS coronavirus.

22
23

Our sequence and structural based queries using SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1were only able to
identify homologues within the Coronaviridae family. This raises the possibility that the specific

Materials and Methods

Cloning, expression and purification of SARS-CoV2 Nsp1

8

The portion of Orf1a encoding full-length Nsp1 was codon-optimized for E. coli expression,

9

synthesized (Codex DNA) and cloned into the pMCSG53 expression vector at the SspI site via

10

Gibson assembly. The fragment encompassing amino acid residues 13-127 of Nsp1 was PCR

11

amplified and cloned into the same vector via ligation-independent cloning. Plasmids were

12

transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-Gold for protein expression. The same procedure

13

was used for purification of full-length Nsp1 and Nsp113-127. Cells were grown at 37°C and 200

14

rpm to an OD600 of 0.8, cooled to 20°C then induced with 1 mM IPTG and incubated for 16

15

hours. Cells were harvested via centrifugation at 5000 x g, resuspended in binding buffer (300

16

mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol) and lysed via sonication.

17

Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 45 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant was incubated

18

with Ni-NTA resin and rotated for 1 hour at 4°C. Nsp1 and Nsp113-127 were eluted in elution

19

buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol) then incubated

20

with Tobacco-etch virus (TEV) protease overnight to cleave the N-terminal polyhistidine tag

21

while dialyzing to remove imidazole. The proteins were then passaged over a second Ni-NTA to

22

remove impurities. Nsp113-127 was immediately dialyzed into precrystallization buffer (300 mM

Crystals of Nsp113-127 were grown at 298 K in 0.2 M sodium formate, 20% PEG3350 via the

6

vapour diffusion sitting-drop method. Prior to data collection the crystals were soaked in 0.2 M

Data collection, structure determination and refinement
X-ray diffraction data of crystals of Nsp113-127 were collected at Advanced Photon Source

11

Beamline 19 ID (Argonne, Illinoi USA) under cryo-stream at 93.15 K. Diffraction data were

12

processed with HKL3000 suit [28]. Initial phase for Nsp113-127 was obtained by molecular

13

replacement with Molrep using NMR structure of SARS-CoV Nsp1 (PDB: 2HSX) as a search

14

model [29]. Subsequently, the initial electron density map was improved though density

15

modification by parrot and the model was built using buccaneer [29]. Final model was produced

16

by the cycle of manual model building and refinement using Phenix.refine and Coot [30, 31]. All

17

geometry was verified using Phenix validation tools (Ramachandran statistics: Favoured

18

Structure analysis and homology-modeling
Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated using Pymol using APBS[21].. Structure

improve stereochemical property [34]. Stereochemical properties of the final model was

5

validated with Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK server and 90% of residues are in the
