for the ongoing 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The highly contagious COVID-19

37

disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several

38

vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In

39

present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch

40

Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

41

Methodology: A novel reverse epitomics approach, “overlapping-epitope-

42

clusters-to-patches” method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from

43

the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as “Ag-

44

Patch or Ag-Patches”, for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-

45

Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular

46

region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-

47

Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology

48

for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for

49

immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA

50

constructs.

51

Results: We identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-

52

Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The

53

identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL)

54

overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of

55

epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of

56

epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large

57

ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor

58

ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond

59

formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further,

60

the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell

61

line.

62

Conclusion: Highly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire

63

proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach. We conclude

64

that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccines could be a highly potential novel approach to

65

combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large

66

human population coverage worldwide.

Introduction

106

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes

107

the highly communicable disease COVID-19, the ongoing 2019-2020 disease

108

outbreak which has turned into a pandemic. The disease has already spread to

109

more than 216 countries and territories worldwide. More than 26,415,380 people

110

have already got infected and 870,286 have died worldwide, resulting the

111

ongoing mortality rate to be ~3.295% (cases/deaths*100) (WHO Coronavirus

112

Disease

113

Epidemiological Update, 31st August 2020). The outbreak has raised an urgent

114

need of a specific and efficient vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

115

The long term adaptive immunity crucially involves presentation of antigen

116

as epitope on the surface of Antigen Presenting Cells (APC). The chop down

117

processing of antigen by proteasome and lysosome into small size peptide

118

epitopes of different length like (7,9,13,15… amino acid) pave the way for epitope

119

formation and eventual presentation. The ‘Transporter associated with antigen

120

processing’ (TAP) and further the HLA allele (human leukocyte antigen)

121

molecules facilitate the epitope presentation (Figure 1A). The crucial step in the

122

process of antigen presentation is the cleavage of the antigenic protein

123

molecules to provide small length peptides which acts as epitopes at later stage

124

after their presentation on the surface of APC (Melief et al., 2005; Kahan et al.,

125

2003, Tenzer et al., 2005, Antoniou et al., 2003).

126

In the present study, we have performed the reverse epitomics analysis to

127

identify antigenic patches from SARS-CoV-2 proteins by novel “overlapping-

128

epitope-clusters-to-patches” method. The term “reverse epitomics” would involve

129

search for antigenic patches from the overlapping multiple epitope clusters. This

130

method of identifying antigenic patches (Ag-Patches) from a protein is termed

131

here as “Overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches” method. These antigenic

132

patches are termed here as Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches. These Ag-Patches, once

133

administered as vaccine candidates, are expected to be chopped down to

134

produce cluster of overlapping multiple epitope. In our present study we have

135

identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte) and 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte)

136

such Ag-Patches from the structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2

137

virus proteome. Further we utilized these identified Ag-Patches from SARS-CoV-

138

2 proteome to design Multi-Patch Vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

139

The designed MPVs are supposed to be more effective than both the

140

subunit or single antigenic protein based vaccines and the Multi-Epitope

141

Vaccines (MEVs). MPVs would involve Ag-Patches from entire proteome of

142

SARS-CoV-2 and hence would be more effective than subunit or single protein

143

vaccine. In comparison to the epitope based MEVs, the Ag-Patches based MPVs

144

will provide a more natural antigenic vaccine candidate. The proteasome and

145

lysosomal chop down processing of MPVs by the Antigen Presenting cells would

146

release larger number of epitopes in their intact form for which the MEVs would

147

have a challenge. Moreover the Ag-Patch based MPVs will cover larger number

148

of overlapping epitopes in comparison to the limited number of epitopes covered

149

by epitope based MEVs (Srivastava et al., 2020a; Srivastava et al., 2020b). The

150

larger the number of epitopes covered larger would be the number of HLA alleles

151

targeted and hence larger human population with ethnic distribution of HLA

152

alleles will be covered. Hence, the MPVs would provide more effective and

153

specific solution with larger human population coverage for vaccine development

154

against SARS-CoV-2. The schematic of antigen presentation, the identification of

antigenic patches (Ag-Patches) by the reverse epitomics “Overlapping-epitope-

203

us to identify antigenic patches from the source protein, a reverse epitomics

approach. The identified antigenic patches could be used to design Multi-Patch

207

Methodology

208

In the present study, we have identified antigenic patches from all the

209

eleven ORF proteins of SARS-CoV-2 proteome (Supplementary figure S1)

210

(NCBI:

211

gi|1798174254|ref|NC_045512.2|). These Ag-Patches are identified by the

212

overlapping epitope clusters. These identified Ag-Patches are further utilized to

213

design a Multi-Patch Vaccine (MPV) candidate against the SARS-CoV-2

214

infection. To identify the Ag-Patches from the SARS-CoV-2 proteins we have first

215

screened high scoring CTL and HTL epitopes from all the eleven ORF proteins of

216

the virus. The screening of potential CTL and HTL epitopes was done using

217

various IEDB tools. We further analyzed the immunogenic properties of the

218

screened CTL and HTL epitopes on the basis of their amino acid sequences and

219

epitope databases.

220

We further performed multiple sequence alignment for all the screened

221

epitopes leading us to obtain clusters of overlapping epitopes from the proteins of

222

SARS-CoV-2. These CTL and HTL epitope clusters further led us to identify the

223

antigenic patches (Ag-Patches) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins from where the

224

overlapping epitopes clusters were arising. The identified Ag-Patches, in other

225

words, act as the source of multiple CTL and HTL epitopes and hence are the

226

potential stretch of SARS-CoV-2 proteins which can be utilized to elicit T Cell

227

immune response. The pairs of overlapping epitope forming clusters and their

228

HLA allele binders were also utilized to analyze the world population coverage by

229

the screened epitopes on the basis of HLA allele distributed worldwide amongst

230

different ethnic human population.

231

We further used the identified antigenic patches to design chimeric fusion

232

Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs) against SARS-CoV-2, by the GGGGS linker which

233

is flexible in nature and favors peptide chain folding. We also liked human β

234

defensin 2 and 3 (hBD-2 and hBD-3) at its N and C terminal of the Multi-Patch

235

Vaccines candidates respectively as adjuvants, by the rigid linker EAAAK

236

favoring domain formation (Hu et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2013; Hajighahramani et

237

al., 2017; Srivastava et al., 2018; Srivastava et al., 2019). COVID-19 patients

238

usually have lung infection and lung infection is usually coupled with increased

239

expression of hBD-2 and hBD-3. Also, the β-Defensins are involved in the

240

chemotactic activity for memory T cells, monocytes, immature dendritic cells as

241

well as in degranulation of mast cells. The hBDs also enhances the innate and

242

adaptive immunity and therefore are chosen here as adjuvants in the design of

the MPVs (Wilson et al., 2013; Duits et al., 2003; Hoover et al., 2000; Yang et al.,

244

2020; Biragyn et al., 2001; Kohlgraf et al., 2010). Further, discontinuous B cell

245

epitopes, linear B cell epitopes and IFN-γ inducing epitopes were also screened

246

from the generated tertiary models of all the MPVs, designed by the identified

247

Ag-Patches of SARS-CoV-2.

248

The molecular signaling by multiple TLRs is an essential component of the

249

innate immune response against viral infection. Upon lung infection the PBEC

250

(peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected patients) were found to

251

express TLR3, which is involved in recognition of RNA. Hence we tested all the

252

CTL and HTL MPV models for their molecular interaction with the ectodomain of

253

the TLR3 receptor by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation

254

studies (Delneste et al., 2007; Totura et al., 2015; Farina et al., 2005). Further,

255

the codon-optimized cDNA of all the CTL and HTL MPVs were also analyzed and

256

found to favor high expression in human cell line. The Schematic work flow chart

257

and the methodology utilized in the present study are shown in Supplementary

Screening of Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) Epitope. The screening of Cytotoxic

262

T lymphocyte epitopes was performed by the IEDB (Immune Epitope Database)

263

tools “MHC-I Binding Predictions” (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) and “MHC-I

264

265

2009). The tools use six different methods (viz. Consensus, NN-align, SMM-

267

“Percentile rank” and a “total score” respectively indicating the immunogenic

268

potential of the screened epitopes. The screening methods utilized are based on

269

the total amount of cleavage sites in the submitted protein sequence. The TAP

270

score of a peptide estimates an effective -log of (IC50) values (half maximal

271

inhibitory concentration) for binding to TAP (Transporter associate with Antigen

272

Processing) or its N-terminal prolonged precursors. The MHC

273

histocompatibility complex) binding prediction score of a peptide is the –log of

274

(IC50) values for binding to MHC molecule (Calis et al., 2013). The IC(50) (nM)

275

value for each epitope and MHC allele binding pairs were also obtained by the

276

IEDB tool. Epitopes having high, intermediate, and least affinity of binding to their

277

respective HLA allele binders have IC50 values of < 50 nM, < 500 nM and <

278

5000 nM, respectively.

Immunogenicity of all the screened CTL epitopes was also obtained by

analyzing 1st, 2nd, and C-terminus amino acids of the given epitope (Calis et al.,

Screening of Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) Epitopes. To screen out the Helper T

290

immunogenic potential of the peptide. This percentile score is generated by the

291

combination of three different methods which includes combinatorial library,

292

SMM_align and Sturniolo method. The generated percentile score is further

293

compared with the other random five million 15-mer peptides of SWISSPROT

294

database (Wang et al., 2010; Sidney et al., 2008; Nielsen et al., 2007; Sturniolo

295

et al., 1999). The percentile rank of the screened peptides is generated from the

296

consensus of all above mentioned methods by the median percentile rank.

297
298

CTL and HTL epitope Toxicity prediction. The tool ToxinPred was used to

299

analyze the toxicity of screened CTL and HTL epitopes. The tool facilitates to

300

identify the highly toxic or non-toxic short peptides. The toxicity check analysis

301

was done by the “SVM (Swiss-Prot) based” (support vector machine) method

302

utilizing a dataset of 1805 sequences as positive (toxic) and 3593 sequences as

303

negative (non-toxic) from Swissprot along with a comparison to an alternative

304

dataset comprising of the same 1805 positive sequences and 12541 other

305

negative sequences from TrEMBLE (Gupta et al., 2013).

available on the EBI server (Sievers et al., 2011). The Patches of the SARS-

313

CoV-2 protein sequences showing consensus with the clusters of overlapping

314

epitopes were chosen and shortlisted as antigenic patches (Ag-Patches). This

315

approach of search and identification of antigenic patches from source protein in

316

a reverse epitomics manner, i.e. from epitopes to antigenic patches of source

317

protein, is here defined as “Overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches” method

318

(Figure 1A, 1B). The here provided reverse epitomics approach, “Overlapping-

319

epitope-clusters-to-patches” method to identify Antigenic Patches (Ag-Patches)

320

from pathogen’s (here SARS-CoV-2) protein is included in filed Patent No:

322
323

Population Coverage by the overlapping CTL and HTL epitopes. The “Population

324

Coverage” tool of IEDB was used to analyze the world human population

325

coverage for both the CTL & HTL overlapping epitopes and their respective HLA

326

allele binding pairs (Bui et al., 2006). The T cells recognize the complex of a

327

specific MHC molecule with a particular pathogen-derived epitope. The given

328

epitope will elicit an immune response only in an individual that expresses the

329

epitope binding the MHC molecule. This denomination of the MHC restricted T

330

cell responses and the MHC polymorphism amongst human population provides

331

the basis for population coverage analysis. The MHC types are expressed at

332

dramatically different frequencies in the different ethnicities of human population

333

worldwide. In this way, the population coverage by an epitope-MHC pair could be

334

determined (Sturniolo et al., 1999).

Conservation analysis of antigenic patches. The shortlisted CTL and HTL epitope

337

cluster based antigenic (Ag-Patches) identified from eleven SARS-CoV-2 ORF

338

proteins were analyzed for their amino acid sequence conservancy by “Epitope

339

Conservancy Analysis” tool of IEDB. The epitope conservancy is the percentage

340

of SARS-CoV-2 ORF protein sequences (retrieved from NCBI) containing the

341

particular epitope cluster based Ag-Patch sequence in 100% amino acid

342

sequence match. The analysis was done for all the identified Ag-Patches against

Multi-Patch Vaccines

347

The identified antigenic patches (Ag-Patches) from the SARS-CoV- 2 proteome

348

were further utilized to design three CTL and two HTL Multi-Patch Vaccines as

349

explained in the result section.

Physicochemical property analysis of designed MPVs. The physicochemical

352

properties of the amino acid sequences of the designed three CTL and two HTL

353

MPVs were analyzed by the ProtParam tool (Gasteiger et al., 2005). The

354

ProtParam tool performs an empirical investigation for the given query amino

355

acid sequence of a protein. ProtParam computes various physicochemical

356

parameters including amino acid length, molecular weight, theoretical pI,

357

expected half-life (in E.Coli, Yeast & Mammalian cell), Aliphatic index, Grand

358

average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) and instability index score. The aliphatic

359

index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) indicate the globular and

360

hydrophilic nature of the protein. The instability index score indicates the stable

361

nature of the protein molecule.

363

Interferon-gamma inducing epitope prediction from the MPVs. From the designed

364

amino acid sequence of all the three CTL and two HTL MPVs, the potential

365

interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) epitopes were screened by utilizing the “IFN epitope”

366

tool with “Motif and SVM hybrid” method (MERCI: Motif-EmeRging and with

367

Classes-Identification, and SVM: support vector machine). The tool predicts

368

peptides from the given protein sequences having the potential to induce release

369

of IFN-gamma from CD4+ T cells. This module generates the overlapping, IFN-

370

gamma inducing peptides sequences from the given query sequence. The

371

prediction is based on the IEDB database with 3705 IFN-gamma inducing and

372

6728 non-inducing MHC class II binding epitopes (Nagpal et al., 2015; Dhanda et

373

al., 2013).

374
375

MPVs allergenicity and antigenicity prediction. All the designed CTL and HTL

376

MPVs were further analyzed for allergenicity and antigenicity prediction by

377

utilizing the AlgPred and the Vaxigen tools respectively (Saha et al., 2006;

378

Doytchinova and Flower 2007). The AlgPred prediction is based on the similarity

379

with already known allergens & non-allergens database, with any region of the

380

submitted protein. For the screening of allergenicity, the Swiss-prot dataset

16

381

consisting of 101725 non-allergens and 323 allergens is utilized. The VaxiJen

382

tool utilizes an alignment-free approach, solely based on the physicochemical

383

properties of the given query protein sequence, to predict antigenicity of a give

384

protein sequence. For the prediction of antigenicity, the Bacterial, viral and the

385

tumor protein datasets are utilized by VaxiJen to predict the whole protein

386

antigenicity.

387
388

Tertiary structure modelling and refinement of MPVs. The tertiary structure of all

389

the designed three CTL and two HTL MPVs were generated by homology

390

modelling utilizing the I-TASSER modelling tool. The I-TASSER is a tool that

391

utilizes the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm for protein structure

392

prediction (Roy et al., 2010). The tool generates three-dimensional (3D) atomic

393

models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly

394

simulations for the submitted amino acid sequence of the protein. It works based

395

on the structure templates identified by LOMETS, a meta-server, from the PDB

396

library. The I-TASSER tool only uses the templates of the highest Z-score which

397

is the difference between the raw and average scores in the unit of standard

398

deviation with reference to the templet protein structure. For each target model,

399

the I-TASSER simulations generate a large ensemble of the structural

400

conformations, known as decoys. To select the final models, I-TASSER uses the

401

SPICKER program to cluster all the decoys based on the pair-wise structure

402

similarity and reports up to five top-scoring models. The Normalized Z-score >1

403

indicates a good alignment. The Cov score represents the coverage of the

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.06.284992; this version posted September 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

404

threading alignment and is equal to the number of aligned residues divided by

405

the amino acid length of the query protein sequence. Ranking of templet proteins

406

is based on TM-score of the structural alignment between the query structure

407

model and the known templet protein structures. The RMSD (Root Mean Square

408

Deviation) is the deviation between templet residues and query residues that are

409

structurally aligned by TM-align.

410

The refinement of all the generated three CTL and two HTL MPV models

411

were performed by ModRefiner and GalaxyRefine tools (Dong et al., 2011; Ko et

412

al., 2012). The TM-score generated by ModRefiner indicates the structural

413

similarity of the refined model with the original input protein structure. Closer the

414

TM-Score to 1, higher would be the similarity of original and the refined model.

415

The RMSD value of the refined model shows the conformational deviation from

416

the initial input protein model.

417

The GalaxyRefine tool refines the input tertiary structure by repeated

418

structure perturbation as well as by subsequent structural relaxation and

419

molecular dynamics simulation. The tool GalaxyRefine generates reliable core

420

structures from multiple templates and then re-builds the loops or termini by

421

using an optimization-based refinement method (Wang et al., 2013; Shin et al.,

422

2014). To avoid any breaks or gaps in the generated 3D model, the

423

GalaxyRefine uses the triaxial loop closure method. The MolProbity score

424

generated for a given refined model indicates the log-weighted combination

425

score of the clash score, the percentage of Ramachandran not favored residues

426

and the percentage of bad side-chain rotamers.

427
428

Validation of CTL and HTL MPVs refined models. Both the refined three CTL and

429

two HTL MPV tertiary models were further validated by RAMPAGE analysis tool

430

(Lovell et al., 2003; Ramakrishnan et al., 1965). The generated Ramachandran

431

plots for all the MPV models show the sterically allowed and disallowed residues

432

along with their dihedral psi (ψ) and phi (φ) angles.

433
434

Linear and Discontinuous B-cell epitope prediction from the MPVs. The IEDB

435

tool, Ellipro (ElliPro: Antibody Epitope Prediction tool) available at IEDB server

436

was used to screen the linear and the discontinuous B cell epitopes from all the

437

CTL and HTL MPVs tertiary structure models. The ElliPro method screened B-

438

Cell epitope from the given tertiary structure based on the location of residues in

439

the proteins 3D structure. The farthest residue to be considered was limited to 6

440

Å. The residues lying outside of an ellipsoid covering 90% of the inner core

441

residues of the protein score highest Protrusion Index (PI) of 0.9; and so on. The

442

discontinuous epitopes predicted by the ElliPro tool are clustered based on the

443

distance “R” in Å between two residues centers of mass lying outside of the

444

largest possible ellipsoid of the protein tertiary structure. The larger the value of

445

R, greater would be the distance between the residues (residue discontinuity) of

446

the screened discontinuous epitopes (Kringelum et al., 2012; Ponomarenko et

447

al., 2008).

449

Molecular interaction analysis of MPVs and immune receptor complexes.

450

Molecular interaction analysis of all the three CTL and two HTL MPVs with Toll-

451

Like receptor 3 (TLR3), was performed by molecular docking followed by a

452

molecular dynamics simulation study. Protein-protein molecular docking was

453

performed by the tool PatchDock (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005). The

454

PatchDock tool utilizes an algorithm for unbound (mimicking real-world

455

environment) docking of molecules for protein-protein complex formation

456

(Duhovny et al., 2002). The algorithm carries out the rigid protein-protein docking

457

with the surface variability/flexibility implicitly addressed through liberal

458

intermolecular penetrations. The algorithm focuses on the (a) initial molecular

459

surface fitting on localized and curvature-based patches of the protein surface (b)

460

use of Geometric Hashing and Pose Clustering for initial transformation detection

461

(c) computation of shape complementarity utilizing the Distance Transformation

462

(d) efficient steric clash detection and geometric fit score based on a multi-

463

resolution shape representation and (d) utilization of the biological information by

464

focusing on the hot-spot rich surface patches (Duhovny et al., 2002;

465

Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005). For molecular docking, the X-Ray crystal

466

structure of human TLR3 ectodomain (ECD) was retrieved from PDB databank

467

(PDB ID: 2A0Z) (Bell et al., 2005). The PatchDock molecular docking study

468

provides dynamical properties of the designed system with the complex and also

469

it gives ‘exact’ predictions of bulk properties including the hydrogen bond

470

formation and conformation of the molecules forming the complex.

472

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations study of MPVs and immune receptor

473

complexes. The MPVs-TLR3 complex molecular interactions were further

474

evaluated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations analysis. MD simulation

475

studies were performed for 10 nanoseconds (ns) by using the YASARA tool (Yet

476

Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application) (Krieger and Vriend et al., 2015).

477

The MD simulations studies were carried out in an explicit water environment in a

478

dodecahedron simulation box at a stabilized temperature of 298K, the pressure

479

of 1 atm and pH 7.4, with periodic cell boundary condition. The solvated systems

480

were neutralized with counter ions (NaCl) (concentration 0.9 M). The AMBER14

481

force field was used on the systems during MD simulation (Maier et al., 2015;

482

Case et al., 2014). The Long-range electrostatic energy and forces were

483

calculated using particle-mesh-based Ewald method (Toukmaji et al., 2000). The

484

solvated structures were energy minimized by the steepest descent method at a

485

temperature of 298K and a stable pressure of 1 atm. Further, the complexes

486

were equilibrated for period of 1 ns. After equilibration, a production MD

487

simulation was run for 10 ns at a stable temperature and pressure and time

488

frames were saved at every 10 ps, for each MD simulations. The RMSD and

489

RMSF values for Cα, Backbone and all the atoms of all the CTL and HTL MPVs

490

in complex with TLR3 were analyzed for each MD simulation study.

491
492

Analysis of MPVs cDNA for expression in human host cell line. Codon-optimized

493

complementary DNA (cDNA) of all the three CTL and two HTL MPVs were

494

generated for favored expression in Mammalian cell line (Human) by Java Codon

495

Adaptation Tool. The generated cDNA of all the MPVs were further analyzed by

496

GenScript Rare Codon Analysis Tool for its large scale expression potential. The

497

tool analyses the GC content, Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) and the Tandem

498

rare codon frequency in a given query cDNA sequence (Morla et al., 2016; Wu et

499

al., 2010). The CAI indicates the possibility of cDNA expression in the chosen

500

expression system. The tandem rare codon frequency indicates the presence of

501

low-frequency codons in the given query cDNA sequence.

RESULTS

504

Screening of potential epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteome

505

Screening of Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) Epitope. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte

506

(CTL) epitopes were screened by “MHC-I Binding Predictions” and “MHC-I

507

Processing Predictions” tools of IEDB. A total of 1013 CTL epitopes and HLA I

508

alleles pairs were screened (Supplementary table S1, S2). The immunogenicity

509

analysis of all the screened CTL epitopes was also performed by the tool “MHC I

510

Immunogenicity” of IEDB. The higher immunogenicity score of all the screened

511

CTL epitopes suggest the high immunogenic potential of the CTL epitopes

512

(Supplementary table S1, S2; Srivastava et al. 2020a; Srivastava et al. 2020b;

513

and Grifoni et al., 2020a).

514
515

Screening of Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) Epitopes. The screening of helper T

516

lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes from eleven different ORF proteins of SARS-CoV-2

517

was performed by the “MHC-II Binding Predictions” tool of IEDB. The tool

518

generates percentile rank for all the screened epitopes. The smaller the value of

519

percentile indicates higher “Percentile Rank” of the epitope. Furthermore, the

520

higher Percentile rank suggests a higher affinity of the peptide to bind its

521

respective HLA allele binders. A total of 314 HTL epitopes- HLA II allele pairs

522

with high percentile rank were screened from the entire proteome of the SARS-

523

CoV-2 virus (Supplementary table S3; Srivastava et al. 2020a; Srivastava et al.

524

2020b; and Grifoni et al., 2020a).

525
526

CTL and HTL epitope Toxicity prediction. Toxicity analysis of all the screened

527

CTL and HTL epitopes was also performed by the tool “ToxinPred”. The

528

ToxinPred study of all the screened CTL and HTL epitopes revealed that all the

529

screened epitopes were Non-Toxic (Supplementary table S1, S2, S3).

530
531

Overlapping CTL and HTL epitope clusters to Ag-Patches

532

CTL & HTL multi-epitope cluster based Ag-Patch identification. A total of 73 Ag-

533

Patches from CTL and a total of 49 Ag-Patches from HTL high scoring 768

534

overlapping epitopes (518 CTL and 250 HTL epitopes) were identified (Table 1 &

535

2, Figure 2, 3 & 4) by the “Overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches” method

536

(Figure 1A, 1B, Supplementary table S1, S2, S3). The Ag-Patches hence

537

obtained from the CTL and HTL epitope clusters are expected to produce back

538

clusters of upto 768 overlapping epitopes, targeting different HLA allele, while

539

their chop down processing by proteasome and lysosome, in the process of

540

antigen presentation by the Antigen Presenting Cells (APC). This would be

541

crucial step for the Multi-Patch Vaccines and shown strong possibility for the

542

epitopes to be raised in their intact form and presented by APC. On other hand,

543

such large numbers of epitopes are not possible to be accommodated by the

544

Multi-Epitope Vaccines. The MEVs would also face challenge to give raise to the

545

epitopes in their intact form upon chop down processing by proteasome or

546

lysosome, for presentation by APC (Figure 1A, 1B, 2, 3 & 4). The identified and

547

here provided SARS-CoV-2 Ag-Patches are included in filed Patent No:

Figure 4. The identified immunogenic Ag-Patches (antigenic patches) shown in

704

the tertiary structure models of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The tertiary structure

705

models of all the SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been retrieved from I-TASSER

706

homology modeling server (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COVID-19/).

707

The CTL Ag-Patches are shown in red and the HTL Ag-Patches are shown in

708

blue color. The identification of novel Ag-Patches has been done by the reverse

709

epitomics approach, “overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches” method. Most of

710

the Ag-Patches identified in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins are observed to be on the

711

exposed surface of the proteins.

713

Population Coverage by the overlapping CTL and HTL epitopes. The population

714

coverage by all the overlapping CTL & HTL epitopes on the basis of their HLA

715

allele binders was analyzed by the “Population Coverage” tool of IEDB. As all the

716

Ag-Patches identified cover a large number of overlapping epitopes CTL and

717

HTL epitopes, hence large number of HLA alleles are expected to be targeted

718

and hence ethnically distributed large human population worldwide is expected to

719

be covered. The population coverage analysis has shown very convincing results

720

with 99.98% of world population to be covered with Average of 91.11 and

721

standard deviation of 16.97. In our analysis all the human population ethnicity

722

distribution worldwide was included. The countries most affected by COVID-19

723

have shown particularly significant coverage like France: 100%, Italy: 99.82%,

724

United States: 100%, England: 100%, Germany 100%, Russia: 100%, Brazil:

Conservation analysis of antigenic patches. The identified Ag-Patches were

729

further analyzed for their amino acid sequence conservancy across the source

730

protein sequence library retrieved from NCBI protein database, by the “Epitope

731

Patches are significantly conserved with their 100% amino acid residues largely

734

conserved amongst the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from NCBI

Design of Multi-Patch Vaccines. The identified overlapping epitope cluster based

741

Ag-Patches from the proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 were utilized to design three

742

CTL and two HTL Multi-Patch vaccines (Figure 4). Short peptide linkers EAAAK

743

and GGGGS were utilized as rigid and flexible linkers respectively. The short

744

peptide linker EAAAK facilitates the domain formation and provides a rigid link

745

between two domains facilitating the protein to fold in a stable tertiary

746

conformation. The short peptide linker GGGGS, with its flexible nature, provides

747

conformational flexibility and hence facilitates stable conformation to the final

831

screened from two HTL MPVs (83 from HTL-MPV-1 and 98 from HTL-MPV-2). In

the screening, only the INF-γ inducing POSITIVE epitopes with a score of 1 or

MPVs allergenicity and antigenicity prediction. We used the AlgPred and Vaxijen

836

tools to analyse the allergic and antigenic nature respectively of all the MPVs on

837

the basis of their amino acid composition. All the three CTL and two HTL MPVs

838

were suggested as NON-ALLERGEN (scoring: -0.46602545 for CTL-MPV-1, -

839

0.71579187 for CTL-MPV-2, -0.90796056 for CTL-MPV-3, -0.56197384 for HTL-

840

MPV-1 and -0.72617142 for HTL-MPV-2; the threshold cutoff being -0.4).

841

Likewise, all the three CTL and two HTL MPVs were found to be potential

842

ANTIGENS as suggested by Vaxijen analysis (scoring: 0.5241 for CTL-MPV-1,

843

0.4811 for CTL-MPV-2, 0.6534 for CTL-MPV-3, 0.5016 for HTL-MPV-1 and

844

0.5096 for HTL-MPV-2; default threshold being 0.4). Overall the AlgPred and

845

VaxiJen analysis of all the three CTL MPVs and two HTL MPVs suggests that all

846

the MPVs are non-allergic in nature but they are antigenic. These both properties

847

are essential and favorable for a potential vaccine candidate.

Tertiary structure modelling and refinement of MPVs. The tertiary structure

850

models of all the designed three CTL and two HTL MPVs were generated by

851

utilizing the I-TASSER modeling tool (Figure 6). The parameters (C-score, TM-

852

Score and RMSD) of homology modeling have shown acceptable values for all

853

the MPV models (Supplementary table S8). The C-score is a confidence score

854

for estimating the quality of predicted models by I-TASSER. It indicates the

855

significance of threading template alignments and the convergence parameters

856

of the structure assembly simulations. C-score typically rages from -5 to 2, where

857

higher value signifies a model with high confidence and vice-versa. The TM-

858

score indicates the structural alignment between the query structure and the

859

templet structures. The RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) is the deviation

860

between the residues that are structurally aligned (by TM-align) to the templet

861

structure.

862

All the generated three CTL and two HTL MPV tertiary models were

863

further refined using ModRefiner and GalaxyRefine refinement tools to fix any

864

gaps and improve stoichiometric conformational parameters of the models. The

865

refinement by ModRefiner shows the TM-score of 0.9729, 0.9324, 0.9849,

866

0.9847 and 0.9854

867

HTL-MPV-1 models respectively. The TM-score being close to 1 suggests that

868

the initial and the refined models were structurally similar. After refinement, the

869

RMSD for CTL-MPV-1, CTL-MPV-2, CTL-MPV-3, HTL-MPV-1 and HTL-MPV-1

870

models with respect to the initial model was 2.183 Å, 2.634 Å, 1.185 Å, 1.120 Å

871

and 1.162 Å respectively, indicating not much deviation from the initial structure.

for CTL-MPV-1, CTL-MPV-2, CTL-MPV-3, HTL-MPV-1 and

872

Further, all the three CTL and two HTL MPV models were refined by

873

GalaxyRefine and the top model was chosen based on best scorings

874

parameters. All the three CTL and two HTL MPV refinement output models have

875

acceptable Rama favoured, GDT-HA, RMSD value and MolProbity scores

876

(Supplementary table S9). The Rama favored is the percentage of residues

877

which come in the favoured region of the Ramachandran plot, the GDT-HA

878

(global distance test-High Accuracy) indicates the accuracy of the backbone

879

structure, the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) value indicated deviation

880

from the initial model, and the MolProbity score indicates the log-weighted

881

combination score of the clash score, the percentage of Ramachandran not

882

favored residues and the percentage of bad side-chain rotamers.

883

Overall, after refinement, all the CTL and HTL MPV models had all their

884

stoichiometric parameters in acceptable range and hence all these models were

885

carried forward for further analysis (Supplementary table S8 & S9, Figure 6).

Validation of CTL and HTL MPVs refined models. All the three CTL and two HTL

MPV models were further analyzed again by the RAMPAGE analysis tool after

refinement to their stoichiometric acceptable conformation. All the three refined

933

CTL MPV models (CTL-MPV-1, CTL-MPV-2 & CTL-MPV-3) were found to have

87.0%, 89.20%, & 88.8% favored region residues; 10.2%, 8%, & 7.6% allowed

935

region residues, and 2.7%, 2.8%, & 3.6% outlier region residues, respectively.

936

Likewise, all the two refined HTL MPV models (HTL-MPV-1 & HTL-MPV-2) were

937

found to have 86.9% & 93.0% favored region residues, 9.3% & 5.9% allowed

938

945

by the ElliPro tool available of IEDB. The screening revealed that the CTL MPV

946

carries a total of 41 linear [CTL-MPV-1 (12 epitopes), CTL-MPV-2 (14 epitopes),

947

and CTL-MPV-3 (15 epitopes)] and 19 discontinuous B-cell epitopes [CTL-MPV-

948

1 (7 epitopes), CTL-MPV-2 (5 epitopes), and CTL-MPV-3 (7 epitopes)]. Likewise,

949

the HTL MPVs carries a total of 30 linear [HTL-MPV-1 (16 epitopes) and HTL-

950

MPV-2 (14 epitopes)] and 13 potential discontinuous epitopes [HTL-MPV-1 (8

951

epitopes) and HTL-MPV-2 (5 epitopes)]. The ElliPro associates each predicted

952

epitope with a score, defined as a PI (Protrusion Index) value. The high PI score

953

of the linear and discontinuous epitopes originating from the CTL and HTL MPVs

954

suggest all the MPVs to have high potential to cause humoral immune response

955

(Supplementary table S10, S11, S12, and S13).

956
957

Molecular interaction analysis of MPVs and immune receptor complexes. The

958

immune receptor Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) acts as sentinel for our immune

959

system. The molecular interaction of the designed models of CTL and HTL MPVs

960

with the TLR3 receptor is crucial for the MPVs to act as a vaccine candidate.

961

Hence all the CTL and HTL MPVs were further studied for their molecular

962

interaction with the ectodomain (ECD) of human TLR3 receptor. Molecular

963

docking study for the CTL and HTL MPVs models with the TLR3-ECD crystal

964

structure model (PDB ID: 2A0Z) was performed by utilizing the PatchDock tool.

965

The generated docking complex conformations with the highest docking score

966

were chosen for further study [CTL-MPV-1:TLR3 (docking score: 17696), CTL-

967

MPV-2:TLR3 (docking score: 17118), CTL-MPV-3:TLR3 (docking score: 16562),

968

HTL-MPV-1:TLR3 (docking score: 21432) and HTL-MPV-2:TLR3 (docking score:

969

17620)]. The highest docking score indicates the MPV and TLR3-ECD

970

complexes to have best geometric shape complementarity fitting conformation as

971

predicted by the PatchDock tool. All the three CTL and two HTL MPVs were

972

fitting into the ectodomain region of TLR3 receptor (Figure 7).

973

The B-factor analysis of all the MPV & TLR3-ECD complexes was also

974

performed. The B-factor of a tertiary structure indicates the displacement of the

975

atomic positions from an average (mean) value of the structure i.e. the more

976

flexible an atom is the larger the displacement from the mean position will be

977

(mean-squares displacement) (Figure 7: A-I, B-IV, C-VII, D-X, E-XIII). The B-

978

factor analysis of the CTL and HTL MPVs in complex with TLR3-ECD shows that

979

most of the regions of MPVs bound to TLR3-ECD are stable nature in nature.

980

The B-Factor analysis has been represented by the VIBGYOR color presentation

981

with blue representing low B-factor and red representing high B-factor. Since the

982

entire regions of the MPVs in complex with TLR3-ECD are in blue, hence

983

suggest stable complex formation tendency for all the CTL and HTL MPVs with

984

the ectodomain of the human TLR3 receptor.

985

All the CTL and HTL MPVs have shown to form prominent and close

986

binding site region with TLR3-ECD as represented by binding patches shown in

987

magenta (Figure 7: A-II, B-V, C-VIII, D-XI, E-XIV). The complex forms multiple

988

hydrogen bonds in the interaction interface of MPVs and the ectodomain cavity

1061

molecular dynamics simulation study of all the MPVs & TLR3-ECD complexes

1062

suggests a stable complex formation tendency for all the MPVs with TLR3-ECD.

1063

Further, most of the amino acid residues of the CTL and HTL MPVs in

1064

complexed with TLR3-ECD have shown to have Root Mean Square Fluctuation

1065

(RMSF) from their initial confirmation, for all the amino acid residues of the

1066

MPVs, in acceptable range [(CTL-MPV-1:TLR3-ECD, RMSF: ~2 to ~14 Å) (CTL-

1067

1069

RMSF: ~2 to ~10 Å)] (Figure 8: F-J). These results suggest that all the MPVs and

1070

TLR3-CED complexes to have a stable nature.

1071

Furthermore, the radius of gyration analysis for all the MPVs and TLR3-

1072

ECD complexes was performed. The Radius of gyration (Rg) indicates the

1073

compactness of the complex conformation. Rg is concern with how regular

1074

secondary structures are compactly packed in tertiary structure of protein

1075

complex throughout the MD simulation. The variation in Rg for all the MPVs and

1076

TLR3-ECD complexes remain in acceptable range throughout the MD simulation

1077

[(CTL-MPV-1:TLR3-ECD, Rg: ~44.8 to ~47.0 Å) (CTL-MPV-2:TLR3-ECD, Rg:

1081

structurally compact throughout the 10 ns MD simulation analysis.

DISCUSSION

1137

Majority of the vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 have put their focus

1138

on the single protein, protein subunits or the epitopes from SARS-CoV-2

1139

proteins, mostly S, E, M, N and ORF1ab proteins. The recent strategies to design

1140

and develop vaccine to combat SARS-CoV-2 involve subunit vaccines or multi-

1141

epitope vaccines. The subunit vaccine involves use of single protein or a multiple

1142

subunits of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. On the other hand the multi-epitope vaccine

1143

involves fusion of multiple epitopes identified from the proteome of the SARS-

1144

CoV-2 by short peptide linkers. Many of the subunit based and multi-epitope

1145

based designs have been published claiming potential to activate CD4 and CD8

1146

T cell immune response driving long-term robust adaptive immunity in the vast

1147

majority of the population (Abdelmageed et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020;

1154

al., 2020; Vashi et al., 2020; Yarmarkovich and Farrel et al., 2020; Yazdani et al.,

1155

2020). Numerous highly antigenic regions have also been reported from SARS-

1156

CoV-2 proteins which have been recognized on the basis of large population

1157

coverage by favorable binding with large number of HLA allele distributed

1158

amongst different ethnic human population worldwide (Grifoni et al., 2020b;

1159

Yarmarkovich and Warrington et al., 2020).

1160

Although the major focus is on epitope or subunit based vaccine design,

1161

the antigen protein subunit and the specific epitope used to design multi-epitope

1162

vaccines have some key drawbacks. The Major drawback with single protein or

1163

multiple subunit based vaccine is the limited efficiency of the vaccines. On the

1164

other hand the epitope based vaccines have major drawback of frequent

1165

mutations in the proteome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The multi-epitope based

1166

vaccines have one more major challenge for presentation of the chosen epitopes

1167

by the Antigen Presenting Cells (APC). The chop down processing by

1168

proteasome and lysosome would leave a very narrow chance for the epitopes of

1169

the multi-epitope vaccines, to remain intact and successfully presented by APC.

1170

In the present study, we have reported a novel method to design a

1171

vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing multiple antigenic patches from the viral

1172

proteins. The Ag-Patches used have been identified by the clusters of

1173

overlapping epitopes. The identification of these Ag-Patches was performed by

1174

reverse epitomics analysis, of the high scoring CTL and HTL epitopes screened

53

1175

from all the ORF proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The method is here termed

1176

as “Overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches” method. All the screened epitopes

1177

were well characterized for their conservancy, immunogenicity, non-toxicity and

1178

large population coverage. The clusters of the overlapping epitopes lead us to

1179

identify the Ag-Patches. These Ag-Patches from all the ORF proteins of the

1180

SARS-CoV-2 proteome were utilized further to design Multi-Patch Vaccine (MPV)

1181

candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

1182

The designed MPVs from the antigenic patches of SARS-CoV-2 proteins

1183

have several advantages over to the subunit and multi-epitope based vaccines.

1184

The Ag-Patches utilized were identified and collected from the entire proteome of

1185

the SARS-CoV-2. This would enhance the efficiency of the vaccines and lead the

1186

vaccine to be more effective. The MPVs consists of the identified Ag-Patches will

1187

have potential to raise multiple epitopes in clusters upon the chop down

1188

processing by proteasome and lysosome in the Antigen Presenting Cell (APC).

1189

The identified Ag-Patches will also provide larger chance of the epitopes raised

1190

after proteasome and lysosomal processing to get presentation by the APC and

1191

elicit immune response. Since the Ag-Patches were identified by the large

1192

number of epitopes forming clusters, the MPVs designed would have potential to

1193

raise larger number of epitopes upon proteasome and lysosomal processing,

1194

hence larger number of HLA alleles could be targeted and hence larger ethnic

1195

human population could be covered by the MPVs, in comparison to the limited

1196

number of epitope used in multi-epitope vaccines. For instance, the three MPVs

1197

designed in the present study used the Ag-Patches which were identified by 768

1198

(518 CTL and 250 HTL epitopes) overlapping epitope targeting different HLA

1199

alleles. Such inclusion of large number of epitopes and targeting large number of

1200

HLA alleles is not possible for multi-epitope based vaccines prepared with limited

1201

epitopes.

1202

All the identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs have shown to be

1203

highly conserved amongst the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available at

1204

NCBI protein database. All the physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2,

1205

favors their overexpression in vitro. This is further supported by the cDNA

1206

analysis of the codon-optimized constructs of all the MPVs for high expression in

1207

a mammalian cell line (human). Furthermore, the designed MPVs also show

1208

stable binding tendency with the TLR3-ECD which is an essential criteria for an

1209

antigen to be recognized and processed by the human immune system.

1210
1211

CONCLUSION

1212

In the present study we have identified highly immunogenic novel

1213

antigenic patches (Ag-Patches) (73 CTL and 49 HTL) from the entire proteome of

1214

SARS CoV-2. The Ag-Patches were identified by a novel reverse epitomics

1215

approach, “overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches” method. These Ag-Patches

1216

are highly conserved in nature and found in most of the SARS-CoV-2 protein

1217

sequences available at NCBI protein database. These Ag-Patches are identified

1218

on the basis of high scoring, immunogenic, overlapping epitopes thoroughly

1219

screened from entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2. Further, for the first time we

1220

have utilized the identified multiple immunogenic Ag-Patches to design novel

1221

Multi-Patch Vaccine (MPV) which proposes a new methodology for vaccine

1222

design. The MPVs designed against SARS-CoV-2 in our study have potential to

1223

give raise up to a total of 768 epitopes (518 CTL and 250 HTL epitopes) targeting

1224

large number of different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitopes is not

1225

possible for multi-epitope based vaccine design. The large number of epitopes

1226

covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted. The large number of HLA

1227

allele targeted further implies large ethnic human population coverage worldwide.

1228

The MPVs, with multiple epitope cluster based Ag-Patches from entire proteome

1229

of SARS-CoV-2, are in better position to raise multiple epitopes in comparison to

1230

the MEVs upon proteasome or lysosomal chop down processing by the APC.

1231

The designed MPVs against SARS-CoV-2 are validated for stable complex

1232

formation with ectodomain of TLR3. The physiochemical properties and the

1233

codon-optimized cDNA analysis of all the MPVs designed suggest favored large

1234

scale expression potential. We conclude that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccine

1235

designed by the novel antigenic patches (Ag-Patches) could be a highly potential

1236

novel method to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity

1237

and large human population coverage worldwide.
