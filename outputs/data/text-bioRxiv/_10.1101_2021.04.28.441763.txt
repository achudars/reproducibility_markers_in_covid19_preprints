Abstract: Potent cellular responses to viral infections are pivotal for long-lived protection. Evidence is growing
that these responses are critical in SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Assessment of a SARS-CoV-2 spike ferritin
nanoparticle (SpFN) immunogen paired with two distinct adjuvants, Alhydrogel® (AH) or Army Liposome
Formulation containing QS-21 (ALFQ) demonstrated unique vaccine evoked immune signatures. SpFN+ALFQ
enhanced recruitment of highly activated classical and non-classical antigen presenting cells (APCs) to the
vaccine-draining lymph nodes of mice. The multifaceted APC response of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice was
associated with an increased frequency of polyfunctional spike-specific T cells with a bias towards TH1 responses
and more robust SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific recall response. In addition, SpFN+ALFQ induced Kb spike (539546)-specific memory CD8+ T cells with effective cytolytic function and distribution to the lungs. This epitope is
also present in SARS-CoV, thus suggesting that generation of cross-reactive T cells may provide protection
against other coronavirus strains. Our study reveals that a nanoparticle vaccine, combined with a potent adjuvant,
generates effective SARS-CoV-2 specific innate and adaptive immune T cell responses that are key components
to inducing long-lived immunity.
One Sentence Summary: SpFN vaccine generates multifactorial cellular immune responses.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense, single stranded RNA viruses that cause varying disease pathologies
ranging from common cold symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, as well as, gastrointestinal
symptoms (1-3). SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, represents the seventh CoV to be isolated from
humans, and is the third to cause severe disease (4). The rapid and unparalleled spread of SARS-CoV-2 into a
global pandemic has driven an urgent need for rapidly deployable and scalable vaccine platforms. A myriad of
vaccine platforms and approaches have been adopted and developed by government, industry, academic, and nongovernmental organizations. Two messenger RNA-based vaccines and an adenovirus vector-based vaccine have
been approved for emergency use in the United States (5) (https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/newsarticles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker). While messenger RNA-based vaccines (6, 7) and recombinant
adenovirus vectored vaccines (8-10) have demonstrated potent efficacy and unprecedented deployment speed,
there exists a need for precision vaccine design that may offer improved efficacy to different demographic groups,
induce durable immune responses, and provide a multivalent strategy to protect against multiple CoV species
and the recent emergence of rapidly evolving immunological variants (11-13).
We have recently developed a SARS-CoV-2 sub-unit vaccine based on the ferritin nanoparticle platform
(14) that displays a pre-fusion stabilized spike on its surface (15) and has the potential to fill these current gaps.
The stabilized prefusion-spike protein of the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 was genetically linked to form
a ferritin-fusion recombinant protein, which naturally forms a Spike-Ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN). Ferritin is a
naturally occurring, ubiquitous, iron-carrying protein that self-oligomerizes into a 24-unit spherical particle and
is currently being evaluated as a vaccine platform for influenza in two phase 1 clinical trials (NCT03186781,
NCT03814720) with two further trials in the recruitment phase for Epstein Barr virus (NCT04645147) and
Influenza H10 (NCT04579250).
The spike protein was modified in the following ways to generate a stable spike trimer formation on the
ferritin molecule. Two proline residues (K986P, V987P) were introduced to the spike ectodomain, the furin
cleavage site was mutated (RRAS to GSAS) (16), and the coil-coil interactions were stabilized by mutating the
heptad repeat between hinge 1 and 2 (residues 1140-1161). In addition, a short linker to the ferritin molecule was

used to exploit the natural three-fold axis, for display of eight spikes. SpFN was then formulated with either of
the two distinct adjuvants to evaluate innate and adaptive T cell responses induced by each of the adjuvants. Our
prior experience with Army Liposome Formulation containing the saponin, QS-21(ALFQ) made it a top candidate
to compare with one of the most commonly used adjuvants, Aluminum Hydroxide gel (Alhydrogel®) (AH). ALFQ
contains two immunostimulants, synthetic MPLA (3D-PHAD®) and QS-21 (17), the same two immunostimulants
that are also present in AS01B, the adjuvant in the highly efficacious licensed herpes-zoster vaccine, ShingrixTM
(18). However, the liposomes in ALFQ fundamentally differ from those in AS01B, both in the phospholipid type
and cholesterol content in addition to differences in the amount of 3D- PHAD® and QS-21. Previously, it has
been shown in several different models that ALFQ generates well-balanced TH1/TH2 immunity and protective
efficacy (19-21).
In this study, we show for the first time the effect of adjuvant design on antigen presenting cell (APC)
recruitment to the lymph nodes draining the vaccination site, and its impact on a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform.
We demonstrate that SpFN formulated with ALFQ (SpFN+ALFQ) compared to SpFN formulated with AH
(SpFN+AH) significantly increased recruitment and activation of classical and non-classical APCs. Intriguingly,
this was associated with a potent TH1-biased cellular response and highly functional spike-specific memory T
cells. The APC response to SpFN+ALFQ was characterized by conventional type 1 and type 2 dendritic cells
(cDC1 and cDC2) with upregulated costimulatory molecules, in contrast to SpFN+AH. The effective APC
response induced by SpFN+ALFQ correlated with differentiation of spike-specific CD4+ T cells expressing
markers of TH1 phenotype. Strikingly, vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ resulted in spike-specific CD8+ T cells that
established a memory pool. We identified eleven SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with
SpFN+ALFQ that mapped to the spike protein. Several of these epitopes are corroborated by recently described
findings using an overlapping SARS-CoV-2 peptide library (22) following SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b
restricted mice. Using an MHC class I tetramer, we identified murine Kb restricted SARS-CoV-2 specific memory
CD8+ T cells recognizing an eight amino acid sequence (amino acids 539-546; VNFNFNGL) of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein that is conserved in the SARS-CoV spike protein. The Kb spike(539-546)-specific memory CD8+ T
cells generated by vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ exhibited significantly more cytotoxic activity compared to

those identified in the SpFN+AH vaccinated mice. Together these finding demonstrate a novel vaccine platform
for SAR-CoV-2 that leverages the innate immune response to induce potent memory-specific antiviral T cells.

RESULTS
Spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) adjuvanted with ALFQ (SpFN+ALFQ) induced a more robust and
sustained APC response compared to formulation with aluminum hydroxide (SpFN+AH)

Adjuvants are immunostimulants that activate the innate immune system and facilitate vaccine antigen
presentation (23, 24). To define the ability of distinct adjuvants to engage the innate immune response, we
compared our novel vaccine formulations, SpFN+ALFQ with SpFN+AH. Mice were vaccinated at the specified
time points and innate immune cells were analyzed from the inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes that drain the
vaccinated muscle (dLNs) at days 3 and 5 post vaccination (Fig. 1A). A multiparameter spectral flow cytometry
panel (table S1) was used to discriminate APC subsets. T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)
was used to visualize the high-dimensional datasets (Fig. 1B). The flow cytometric gating strategy is shown in
fig. S1, A. Significant differences in the composition of APCs present in the dLNs were seen in mice vaccinated
with SpFN+ALFQ compared to SpFN+AH (Fig. 1C, and fig. S1, B and C). The overall number of APCs present
in the dLNs was increased 3-7-fold in SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice compared to SpFN+AH vaccinated mice,
as shown by the pie graphs in Fig. 1C. Interestingly, the number and diversity of APCs began to contract 5 days
post vaccination in the SpFN+AH vaccinated mice to levels exhibited in naïve mice. In contrast, mice vaccinated
with SpFN+ALFQ exhibited continued expansion of APCs in the dLNs at this time point, demonstrating a more
sustained response to the adjuvant formulation, ALFQ (Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, not only were the numbers of APCs increased after SpFN+ALFQ vaccination at days 3 and
5, but classical APCs, such as migratory DCs and lymph node resident APCs, predominated (Fig. 1D). Migratory
DCs, which include cDC1 and cDC2s, migrate from tissue sites to dLNs to present antigen and support T cell
activation and differentiation and were increased in number in the SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice (Fig. 1D). In
addition, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), that produce and provide type I interferon for DC and T cell activation, were
also increased in the dLNs after the priming vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ compared to SpFN+AH (Fig. 1D).

Lymph node resident macrophages play a role in acquisition of antigens through pinocytosis and
phagocytosis, and participate in immune regulation. Medullary sinus macrophages (MSM) defined as
CD169+CD11b+F4/80+MHCIIint CD11clo and medullary cord macrophages (MCM) defined as CD169CD11b+F4/80+MHCIIint CD11cloCD64+/- (25, 26) were the most significantly divergent (p <0.0001) between the
two vaccinated groups; higher numbers of MCM were measured in the SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice, whereas
MSM numbers were significantly higher in the SpFN+AH vaccinated mice, (Fig. 1E). CD64- and CD64+MCM
were infrequent in numbers on both days 3 and 5 in the SpFN+AH vaccinated mice, while CD64 + MCM were
present in higher numbers on both days 3 and 5 post-vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ. Interestingly, in the
SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice, CD64-MCM, which were infrequent in number on day 3 post-vaccination
increased by ~10,000-fold on day 5 post-vaccination.
Commensurate with increased numbers of classical APCs, the functional activation of these cells was also
enhanced by SpFN+ALFQ compared to SpFN+AH. In addition to antigen presentation, costimulatory molecules,
such as CD80 and CD86, are expressed by activated DCs and engage T cells, inducing activation rather than
anergy in response to ligation with their peptide-MHC complex (27, 28). The percentage of cDC1 and cDC2
expressing CD80 and CD86 three days post vaccination was 3 times higher in the SpFN+ALFQ group compared
to SpFN+AH (Fig. 1F and fig. S1B). We also measured the activation of macrophage subsets. While the
expression of CD80 and CD40 were similarly low in CD64-MCMs, the CD64+MCMs from SpFN+ALFQ
vaccinated mice significantly upregulated CD80 and CD40 by 3-fold at day 3, and 2-fold at day 5 post priming
vaccination compared to the SpFN+AH group (Fig. 1G). In addition, although the MSM numbers were higher
with AH as the adjuvant, the expression of costimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD40, was increased in the
SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice suggesting a higher activation status (Fig. 1G).
Neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes have been shown to function as APCs or support antigen-specific
T and B cell differentiation in humans and mice (29-31). Increased numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils, and
monocytes were observed in the dLNs of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice at days 3 and 5 post vaccination (figs.
S1, D and E). In addition, a notable proportion of CD11b+MHCII+ monocyte-like cells were CD11c intermediate,
indicative of monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), and were further differentiated by expression of the chemokine

receptor XCR1 (Fig. 1B; fig. 1SA). The XCR1+moDCs were distinct from cDC1, as XCR1+moDCs were MHCII low, CD11c low, and CD103 negative, and displayed two separate populations by t-SNE. Few XCR1+moDCs
were detected in the dLNs of either vaccine group on day 3 post priming vaccination. However, by day 5 post
vaccination this moDC subset had significantly increased in the SpFN+ALFQ group suggesting that these cells
were involved in acquisition and presentation of the antigen (fig. S1E).

Effective APC induction by vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2
spike-specific T cells in the dLNs.

Next, we analyzed the recruitment of total and spike-specific T cells to the dLNs following vaccination with
SpFN+ALFQ or SpFN+AH. T cells from the dLNs were analyzed at days 7 and 10 post priming vaccination for
phenotype and cytokine expression, respectively. At day 7 post priming vaccination, the total T cells, as well as
the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, in the dLNs of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice were significantly higher than
those in the SpFN+AH vaccinated mice (Fig. 2A). T cell memory differentiation potential was characterized by
the expression of CD62L and CD44 (fig. S2A). In addition to the numeric differences of the T cell subsets,
SpFN+ALFQ vaccination resulted in proportionally more effector memory-like (CD62L-CD44+) CD4+ and CD8+
T cells. In contrast, SpFN+AH vaccination induced more naïve T cells (CD62L+CD44-) to the dLNs, although
this subset was seen after vaccination in both groups (fig. S2B).
At day 10 post priming vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells were identified by intracellular
cytokine staining (ICS) following stimulation with a spike peptide pool (S1) containing the epitopes in the
receptor binding domain (RBD). Spike-specific CD4+ T cells were readily detected by expression of IL-2 and
TNF- upon peptide stimulation in the dLNs of mice vaccinated with SpFN+ALFQ, and to a much lower extent
(p<0.0001) in those of SpFN+AH vaccinated mice (Fig. 2B). IL-2 and TNF- were co-expressed in a subset of
the CD4+ T cells (Fig 2C), which were primarily CD44+CD62L-CCR7- effector memory CD4+ T cells (fig. S2C).
The intracellular cytokine responses measured from the spike-specific T cells indicate that the CD4+ T cell
responses were predominantly directed toward TH1 (TNF- and IL-2) rather than a TH2 profile. To further confirm
our findings, multiplex cytokine analysis was performed with the sera of mice after priming vaccination on days

3, 5 and 10. The TH1 cytokines (IFN- and TNF-), as well as IL-10 were significantly higher in the peripheral
blood of the SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice (Fig. 2D) indicating that the cytokine profile was skewed towards a
TH1 profile, which was consistent with the measurement of intracellular cytokine expression in the SpFN+ALFQ
vaccinated mice.

Early expansion of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following priming vaccination with
SpFN+ALFQ
Maturation and activation of APCs, especially DCs, in the dLNs is a prerequisite for the induction of antigenspecific T cell responses and maintenance of long-term memory responses. Since SpFN+ALFQ triggered more
robust APC activation along with significantly higher percentages of functional antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in
the dLNs, we next sought to quantify and characterize the kinetics of vaccine-induced T cell expansion. We
therefore evaluated the phenotype and functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the spleen at days 5 and 10
post vaccination. Cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific peptides from the S1 and S2 peptide
pools from JPT, followed by surface and ICS and measurement by flow cytometry. Although there were no
significant differences in the frequency of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at day 5 and day 10 post
vaccination (fig. S3A), we did observe significant differences in the SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific cytokine
expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells expressing IL-2 (p=0.008) and IFN-γ (p=0.03) were significantly
higher in the ALFQ group compared to the AH group at day 10 (Fig. 3, A to C). In addition, CD8+ T cells secreting
IL-2 (Day 5: p=0.01; Day 10: p=0.03, fig. S3B), IFN-γ (Day 5: p=0.007; Day 10: p=0.03, Fig. S3C) and TNF-
(Day 5: p=0.007; Day 10: p=0.01, fig. S3D ) were higher in SpFN+ALFQ vaccine group on both days 5 and 10
post-vaccination (Fig. 3, A to C). The frequency of cytokine-positive cells was generally higher in the CD8+ T
cell population than the CD4+ T cell population at day 10 compared to day 5 post-vaccination (Fig. 3, A to C).

SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells localize with higher frequency and a TH1-biased cytokine profile to the
lung draining lymph nodes of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice following a prime-boost vaccination

To determine whether an intramuscular vaccination could prime SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells to home
to tissue sites relevant to potential infection, the T cell response in the mediastinal lymph nodes were measured
three weeks following a booster vaccination. The gating strategy for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 spikespecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is shown in fig. S2D. Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed IFN-,
TNF-, IL-17A (Fig. 4A) and IL-10 (Fig. 4B) in the SpFN+ALFQ vaccine group. The IFN- expressing CD4+
and CD8+ T cells exhibited activated effector memory markers (CD69+ CD44+ and CD62L- CD103-; fig. S2, E
and F). Furthermore, IFN- and TNF- were dominant and co-expressed by both spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+
T cell in the SpFN+ALFQ vaccine group (Fig. 4C).
The profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines was also compared in the spleen at 3 weeks following booster
vaccination to track the differentiation of antiviral T cell responses. Splenocytes were stimulated with pooled
SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides spanning the S1 and S2 subunits and the cytokine profiles were assessed. Assessing
the two vaccination groups, IFN-γ, TNF-, IL-2 and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in SpFN+ALFQ
vaccinated mice compared to mice that received SpFN+AH vaccination (Fig. 4D). The IL-4 and IL-10 levels
were also elevated in the SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated group, although the magnitude of increase was much lower in
comparison to the TH1 cytokines (Fig. 4D).

Prime-boost vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ resulted in a more robust SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell
response

To assess the durability of T cell responses, we further characterized the T cell phenotypes and functional
responses in the spleen at three weeks post booster vaccination. Upon evaluating the total T cell response, we
observed an expansion of CD8+ T cells compared to CD4+ T cells as measured by a decrease in the total CD4+
(p=0.002) and an increase in the total CD8+ T cells (p=0.0006) in the SpFN+ALFQ compared to SpFN+AH
vaccination group (Fig. 5, A and B). To assess the frequency of cytokine secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,
splenocytes were stimulated ex-vivo with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides spanning the S1 or S2 subunits. The flow

gating strategy used to determine the frequency of cytokine secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is represented in
fig. S4. Our data revealed that the vaccine boost dramatically increased the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1specific IL-2 (CD4+: p= 0.004; CD8+: p=0.0005, Fig. 5C), IFN-γ (CD4+: p= 0.005; CD8+: p=0.0005, Fig. 5D)
and TNF- (CD4+: p= 0.0007; CD8+: p=0.0005, Fig. 5E) secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, while no differences
were observed in frequency of IL-4 secreting cells (data not shown). The booster dose of SpFN+ALFQ resulted
in a further expansion of cytokine producing T cells above the priming response at day 5 and/or day 10. This
suggested that the two- dose regimen of the SpFN+ALFQ vaccine formulation improved the generation and
differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell memory responses. Importantly, the S1 peptide pool containing
the RBD and NTD portions of the spike protein produced significantly greater cytokine expression compared to
the minimal responses generated by the S2 peptide pool (data not shown). Therefore, we focused further
functional assays on this portion of spike that contains both conserved peptide residues and peptides unique to
SARS-CoV-2.

T cell responses induced by SpFN+ALFQ are focused to the S-1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

Next, we sought to characterize the peptides of the spike protein targeted by the vaccine induced T cell response.
Our data demonstrated that the cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 was dominated by IFN-γ, therefore an IFN-γspecific ELISpot assay was used to screen 52 peptide pools composed of 315 peptides as this methodology
requires fewer cells and has a higher sensitivity than other measurement assays. Peptides comprised the full length
of the spike protein, represented with its major sub-units and domains (S-1 domain containing the NTD, RBD, S2 domain containing FP, HR1 and HR2) in Fig. 6A. Peptides were pooled in a matrix scheme to allow the highthroughput screening and identification of potential epitopes (Fig. 6B, and fig. S5). Most of the measured
reactivity to the peptide pools was focused to the NTD and RBD within S-1 domain of the spike protein with the
highest responses in pools 4 and 5, and 19 (Fig. 6C). The results revealed one epitope, VNFNFNGL (aa 539-546)
that was not predicted by the NetMHCPan 4.1 EL prediction tool (iedb.org), but was previously reported (22) in
mice transfected with human ACE2 mRNA and subsequent infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as defined in
SARS-CoV (32). This epitope is conserved between the two viruses. Comparing the results from the NetMHCPan

4.1EL results with the IFN-γ ELISpot results suggest that all epitopes are either H2Kb or H2Db restricted and
none of them represented CD4+ epitopes.

Induction of Kb-spike(539-546)-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses following booster vaccination
with SpFN+ALFQ.

After establishing the strong effector functions of T cells after the prime-boost vaccination strategy, we then
enumerated the frequency of antigen specific CD8+ T cells with MHC class I tetramer staining. Epitope mapping
data revealed SARS-CoV-2 spike aa 539-546 (VNFNFNGL) as the most immunogenic epitope present in peptide
pools 4, 5, and 19 (Fig. 6, B and C). MHC class I, Kb, tetramers presenting the VNFNFNGL epitope (aa 539-546)
along-with two other H2-Kb restricted epitopes, GNYNYLYRL (aa 433-441) and YNYLYRLF (aa 435-443) from
the spike protein, were used to identify antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. A H2-Kd restricted tetramer, containing
CYGVSPTKL (aa 365-373) from the spike protein served as a control (table S5). The gating strategy is provided
in fig. S6, A and B. Our data revealed that SpFN+ALFQ generated significantly higher Kb-spike(539-546)-specific
CD8+ T cells (p=0.01) ranging from 2.47% to 28 % (Fig. 7A) compared to 0.21% to 4.2 % for SpFN+AH (Fig.
7B). Based on the tetramer and epitope mapping data, we performed combined ICS and tetramer staining
experiments with the Kb-spike(539-546)-specific tetramer, to demonstrate cytokine secretion by tetramer positive
CD8+ T cells. Our results demonstrate SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice generated higher percentages of Kbspike(539-546)-specific TNF-α+ (Fig. 7C; p =0.007), IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 7D; p=0.008), and double positive
TNF-α+IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 7E; p=0.007), compared to SpFN+AH vaccinated mice following the booster
vaccination.
Cytokine polyfunctionality is of major importance for the successful efficacy of a vaccine (33). Several
studies have shown a strong correlation between the protection level and the induction of high frequencies of
polyfunctional T cells co-expressing IFN-γ, TNF-, and IL-2 (33). In order to determine if SpFN+ALFQ
generated antigen-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells, we assessed their frequency post booster vaccination.

Functionality was measured based on stimulation with the S1 peptide pool, as our prior data showed minimal
responses to the S2 peptide pool by ICS.
SpFN+ALFQ induced a strikingly higher percentage of polyfunctional spike-specific CD8+ T cells coexpressing either 3 (IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) or 2 (IFN-γ, TNF-α) cytokines compared to the SpFN+AH (Fig.
7F). Polyfunctional IFN-γ and TNF-α producing T cells dominated the response from the SpFN+ALFQ
vaccinated animals, in contrast to the single cytokine secreting T cell response exhibited by the SpFN+AH group.
These data demonstrate the differences in the landscape of T cell responses induced by the two different vaccine
formulations.

Kb-spike(539-546)-specific CD8+ T cells from SpFN+ALFQ immunized mice effectively lyse target cells

In order to determine if the induction of a more robust CD8+ T cell response in the SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated
mice compared to SpFN+AH vaccinated mice translated into improved effector function, we conducted an invitro killing assay. Target cells were generated by pulsing naïve splenocytes with Kb-spike(539-546)- peptide or
left unpulsed and labeled CFSE high or low, respectively. The gating strategy for target CFSE-high and low and
tetramer positive effector CD8+ T cells is shown in fig. S6C. Cells isolated from the SpFN+ALFQ group
demonstrated increased killing of peptide-pulsed target cells compared to SpFN+AH group represented by the
ratio of CFSE high:low cells at each dilution (Fig. 8C). Increased CTL activity has been linked with reduced
viral titers and inhibition of viral replication (34) and is the central function of the CD8+ T cells we identified in
this study. Representative flow plots further demonstrated an increase in CFSE high population as dilution of
effector cells increased (Fig. 8A). Kb-spike(539-546)- specific CD8+ T cells present at each dilution were measured.
The decrease in cells from the SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice corresponded with a decrease in CFSE high cell
death (Fig. 8B). Even at a high dilution rate, the cells from SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated animals demonstrated
improved cytolytic activity compared to the AH group. Curves for both ALFQ and AH groups were evaluated
using Pearson correlation and showed strong positive correlations of 0.823 and 0.888, respectively (Fig. 8C).

Prime-boost with SpFN+ALFQ resulted in a large population of spike(539-546)-specific memory CD8+ T cells
in the lungs

Prime-boost with SpFN+ALFQ generated effector memory IFN-γ producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the
mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. S2, E and F). Therefore, we wanted to determine the distribution of the cytotoxic
spike(539-546)-specific CD8+ T cells at a similar memory time point in the lungs of mice vaccinated with
SpFN+ALFQ and SpFN+AH. At 3 weeks following booster vaccination, perfused lungs were processed from
both groups of vaccinated mice and stained with Kb-spike(539-546) tetramer. Tetramer positive CD8+ T cells were
detected from the lungs of mice in both adjuvant groups (Fig. 8D). Similar to the results from splenocytes, the
lungs from the SpFN+ALFQ group exhibited a higher percentage of Kb-spike(539-546)-specific CD8+ T cells (9.3%)
compared to lungs from the SpFN+AH group (3.1%).

Discussion
In the present study, we assessed cell-mediated immunity induced by a novel immunogen, SpFN,
combined with a potent adjuvant, ALFQ. This candidate vaccine induced robust recruitment of APCs and
polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cells, and spike epitope-specific cytolytic memory CD8+ T cells.
The vaccine, SpFN+ALFQ is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial in the United States, sponsored by the U.S. Army
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04784767).
Both humoral and cellular responses have been shown to provide protection against respiratory viral
pathogens, such as influenza and RSV (35, 36). Moreover, cross-reactive T cells have been shown to protect
against a heterologous influenza virus infection in the absence of virus-specific antibodies (37). While vaccine
evaluation traditionally involves assessment of neutralizing antibodies, currently, the full spectrum of correlates
of protection for COVID-19 remain unknown. There are several reports that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific
for SARS-CoV-2 arise during an active infection and during the convalescence period (38) and may also provide
protection. Resident memory T cells were shown to protect against SARS-CoV in an intranasal mouse vaccine
model (39), suggesting perhaps a similar important role for T cells in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

Based on the breadth of the observed immune response with SpFN+ALFQ, and protection following
challenge with USA-WA1/2020 strain in nonhuman primates (40), the induction of broad SARS coronavirus
immune responses in mice (unpublished data), a detailed study of the T cell responses induced by SpFN+ALFQ
was warranted. The mouse system offers the advantage of defining the in vivo mechanisms of innate and adaptive
immunity following vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ in comparison with a common and well-established adjuvant
AH.
Following vaccination with SpFN+ALFQ, we observed robust and sustained recruitment and activation
of classical and nonclassical APCs in the dLNs compared to SpFN+AH. Furthermore, we show that cDC1 and
cDC2, in particular, exhibited enhanced upregulation of costimulatory molecules necessary for T cell engagement
and differentiation. Interestingly, by thoroughly analyzing the immune response within the dLN of the vaccination
site, we discovered that SpFN+ALFQ also recruited more non-classical APCs and monocytes that support
recruitment and activation of APCs and T cells that enhance vaccine efficacy (41). Moreover, we show that lymph
node resident macrophages (42, 43) increased in number and functional activation in response to ALFQ+SpFN
and may support and optimize plasma cell (25, 44) and T cell development (44) in response to this vaccine
strategy.
Although both vaccine-adjuvant formulations (SpFN+ALFQ and SpFN+AH) recruited naïve T cells, the
response elicited by ALFQ was superior and faster at generating or differentiating effector memory phenotype
cells than seen with AH. Hence, the adjuvant determines the quality and the quantity of early innate responses
which then sets the stage for downstream adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, our results suggest that the
effective APC responses induced by SpFN+ALFQ resulted in differentiation of virus-specific CD4+ T cells that
were biased towards a TH1 phenotype (TNF- and IL-2). Multiplex cytokine data analysis in the sera of
SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice, post priming, also showed a similar skewing towards a TH1 response (IL-2, TNF, and IFN-). We also noted a significant increase in the secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF- from both CD4+
and CD8+ T cells from the spleen of SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice compared to SpFN+AH in response to spike
peptide pools.

Following a booster vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell responses were also present in the
mediastinal lymph nodes that drain the lungs. A 3-fold increase in MHC class I restricted Kb-spike(539-546)-specific
CD8+ T cells was also observed in the lungs of mice vaccinated with SpFN+ALFQ. The importance of T cell
surveillance in the lungs cannot be overstated as they are the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
SpFN+ALFQ vaccinated mice exhibited a higher frequency of spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting
IFN-, TNF-, IL-17A and IL-10, as well as, co-expression of IFN- and TNF-. Multiplex cytokine analysis in
the splenocytes conducted at the same time point further validated our ICS results and showed significantly
elevated levels of spike-specific TH1 cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-6 compared to vaccination
with SpFN+AH. Even though there was an increase in TH2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 with SpFN+ALFQ,
the magnitude of the response was minimal in comparison to other TH1 cytokines, indicating a strong bias toward
secretion of TH1 cytokines compared to TH2 cytokines. Hence, the two-dose regimen of SpFN+ALFQ vaccine
formulation was able to generate strong functional T cell effector and memory responses in the spleen as well as
memory T cells in the lungs.
One of the key features of the SpFN+ALFQ cellular response is the early induction of a predominantly
TH1, and not a TH2, response. Vaccine elicited TH2 responses have been shown to be detrimental in a SARS-CoV
murine infection model (45-47). Another important factor is the induction of immune-modulatory cytokines. IFNγ in particular, is a key cytokine for several antiviral responses (48, 49). This cytokine has been shown to act in
synergy with type I interferons to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV (50). The robust induction of IFN-γproducing CD8+ T cells in the present study, indicates that SpFN+ALFQ vaccine elicits a favorable cellular
immune response and complements the observed strong neutralizing antibody response observed in mice
(unpublished) and in nonhuman primates (40). The neutralization breadth and the inhibition of ACE-2 binding
was maintained with the variants tested (SARS-1, B.1.1.7 {UK} and B.1.351{SA}) with immune nonhuman primate
sera, showing a zero to 3-fold decrease (unpublished data). The early induction and persistence of CD4+ and CD8+
T cells may confer long-lasting memory against coronaviruses and induce durable immune responses as was
observed in some SARS-CoV survivors, in whom CD4+ and CD8+ T cells persisted for 17 years (51). Also, IFN-

γ+ SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells have been reported in a majority of patients who recovered form COVID19 infection (52).
We identified 11 SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell epitopes targeted by the splenocytes of C57BL/6
mice vaccinated with SpFN+ALFQ. The most dominant and immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike epitope begins in
the RBD domain (VNFNFNGL; aa 539-546). This epitope was further confirmed as an MHC class I restricted
Kb(539-546) spike-specific CD8+ T cell epitope with tetramer staining. Similar to the results from splenocytes, the
lungs from the SpFN+ALFQ group also showed a 3-fold increase in cells positive for the MHC class I, Kb,
restricted epitope, spike(539-546), compared to lungs from the SpFN+AH group. SpFN+ALFQ induced expansion
of antigen specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells and significantly greater amounts of polyfunctional spike-specific
CD8+ T cells co-expressing either 3 (IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) or 2 (IFN-γ, TNF-α) cytokines compared to the
SpFN+AH. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report expansion of vaccine-induced SARSCoV-2 Kb-spike(539-546) -specific polyfunctional CD8+T cells in mice that also exhibited increased killing of
peptide-pulsed target cells in an in vitro cytotoxic T cell assay. Since this epitope is also present in SARS-CoV,
it is tempting to hypothesize that generation of cross-reactive T cells may provide protection against other
coronavirus strains and warrants further investigation. The molecular mechanisms involved in specific gene
signatures associated with an early induction of specific innate immune responses directly as a result of the type
of vaccine formulation, which then influence the adaptive immune responses remains to be explored.
By employing a strategy of sampling immunologically relevant tissues temporally and spatially proximal
to vaccination, we show that the SpFN vaccine potentiates innate sensing and mobilizes the cellular drivers of a
multifactorial immune response, in particular CD4+ T cell responses and durable effector-memory functional
CD8+ T cell responses, with a distinct bias towards a TH1 phenotype, with IFN-γ and TNFα as the dominant
cytokines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The major aim of the study was to utilize a unique liposomal adjuvant formulation and a well-known and widely
used adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide gel, with a novel particulate antigen, SpFN, to understand the early innate
immune responses at the site of vaccination. The influence of the adjuvant formulation on the innate responses
and the subsequent effects on downstream adaptive immune responses were studied in C57BL/6 mice. We utilized
flow cytometry with specific markers of phenotype and activation to identify APCs and T cells at early and late
time points following vaccination. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD8 T cells by ELISpot analysis
followed by confirmation with MHC class I- spike peptide tetramers, allowed us to evaluate the tissue distribution
of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells for polyfunctional cytokine expression and cytolytic responses. We utilized a
sample size of 5 mice/time point/vaccine formulation to obtain reliable data to perform statistical analyses and
ensure reproducibility. The size was based on results of preliminary data obtained during the antigen development
process. Endpoints were set based on the two major experimental arms, single immunization (endpoint Day 10)
or prime/boost strategy (endpoint Day 42). All experiments were replicated in at least two to three independent
experiments. The number of individual replicates for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. Mice
were age- and sex-matched and were randomly assigned to study groups. The APC flow cytometry and ELISpot
analysis were performed by the investigators in a blinded fashion as they were not aware of which treatment group
belonged to which adjuvant formulation. All other analyses were performed unblinded because mice were
grouped according to the treatment.
Mice vaccination and tissue processing
Female C57BL/6 mice (5-6 weeks of age) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Animals were housed
in groups and fed standard chow diets. Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research [Assurance number D16-00596 (A4117-01)]. Mice were vaccinated through the
intramuscular route with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SpFN) mixed with aluminium hydroxide gel (n =5

mice/time point) or SpFN formulated with Army Liposome Formulation containing QS21 (ALFQ) (n = 5
mice/time point). Mice received either a single intramuscular vaccination in the left hind leg quadriceps muscle
or the priming vaccination followed by a boost at week 3 in the right hind leg quadriceps muscle. Mice were
euthanized on days 3, 5, 7, and 10 post first vaccination or 3 weeks after the second vaccination on week 6.
Time points 3, 5, and 10 were repeated twice, each time with an n=5 mice/time point/adjuvant. The 6-week time
point with SpFN-ALFQ vaccine was repeated twice (n=5, n=9). Pre-vaccination peripheral blood was obtained
on day -4. The inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes draining the vaccinated site, as well as, the spleen, and blood
were collected at days 3, 5, 7, and 10 following the first vaccination. At the 6-week time point, perfused lung
tissue, mediastinal lymph nodes, spleen and peripheral blood were obtained.
Serum was separated from pre and post vaccination peripheral blood samples and individually stored in
aliquots at -80°C until analysis. The inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes draining the vaccinated leg was
combined for analysis. Lymph nodes were manually homogenized between the frosted ends of glass slides to
obtain a single cell suspension. Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation over Fico/Lite-LM (Atlanta
Biologicals) density gradient. Single cell suspensions were then washed and resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS.
Individual mouse spleens were pressed through a 70μm cell strainer using the plunger of a 3-mL syringe, to
obtain a single-cell suspension, followed by washing twice in PBS containing 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS,
Invitrogen). Cells were then counted using trypan blue exclusion, cryopreserved in freezing media (90% heat
inactivated FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide) and stored in liquid nitrogen until use.
Following mouse euthanasia, lungs were perfused with approximately 7-10 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA in
Hanks Balanced Salt Solution. Lungs were cut into small pieces (approximately 3-5 mm) and placed in a 15 mL
conical tube containing 5 mL RPMI supplemented with 150 U/mL collagenase, 25 U/mL DNase IV (Fisher
Scientific) and incubated for 60 minutes at 37˚ C on a rotator at 12-15 RPM. Tissue was then pressed through a
100μm cell strainer using the plunger of a 5-mL syringe, to obtain a single-cell suspension. Cells were washed
twice in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, cryopreserved in freezing media, and stored in liquid nitrogen until
use.

Protein and liposome vaccine formulation
SARS-CoV-2 prefusion antigen construct, derived from the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequence was designed as
ferritin-fusion recombinant protein for expression as a nanoparticle. The Helicobacter pylori ferritin molecule
was linked to the C-terminal region of pre-fusion stabilized ectodomain (residues 12-1158). Several modifications
were introduced. The spike ectodomain was modified to introduce two prolines residues (K986P, V987P) as
previously described(16), a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685), and increase the
coiled-coil interactions of the spike stalk region (residues 1140-1161). The modifications were introduced to
stabilize spike trimer formation on the ferritin molecule. The protein was transiently expressed as a soluble
recombinant protein in mammalian Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The secreted protein self-assembles
into a protein nanoparticle, with the SARS-CoV-2 antigen of interest displayed on the nanoparticle surface. The
culture supernatant was harvested four days post-transfection and purified by Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA)affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Purified protein referred to as spike protein ferritin
nanoparticle (SpFN) was formulated in PBS with 5% glycerol at 1 mg/mL and was subsequently diluted with
dPBS to provide 10 µg per 50 µL mouse vaccination dose. The SpFN immunogen is composed of antigens from
the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 scaffolded within a ferritin nanoparticle structure. SpFN immunogen uses 24
copies of antigen spike protein domains supported in a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine platform scaffold that displays
the multivalent array on its surface.
Dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) saturated
phospholipids, cholesterol (Chol), and synthetic monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA, 3D-PHAD®) were purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids. DMPC and Chol were dissolved in chloroform, and DMPG and 3D-PHAD® were
dissolved in chloroform:methanol (9:1). Alhydrogel®, aluminum hydroxide (AH) in a gel suspension was
purchased from Brenntag. QS21 saponin was purchased from Desert King International and was dissolved in
Sorensen PBS, pH 6.2 and filtered. For vaccine preparations adjuvanted with ALFQ (ALF containing QS21),
lipids were mixed in a molar ratio of 9:1:12.2:0.114 (DMPC:DMPG:Chol: 3D-PHAD®), dried by rotary
evaporation followed by overnight desiccation, rehydrated by adding Sorensen PBS, pH 6.2, followed by

microfluidization to form small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) and filtration (19, 53). QS-21 was added to SUV to
form ALFQ (DMPC:DMPG:Chol:MPLA:QS-21; 9:1:12.2:0.114:0.044).
For vaccine preparations adjuvanted with ALFQ, SpFN (600 µg/mL) was mixed with ALFQ (1.5X) in a
1:2 volume ratio. The vial was vortexed at slow speed for 1 min and then put on a roller for 15 mins. The vials
were stored at 4C for 1 hour prior to vaccination and then injected into animals within an hour. For vaccine
preparations adjuvanted with AH, Alhydrogel was diluted from a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL to 900 µg/mL
(1.5X) with DPBS in a sterile glass vial; SpFN (600 µg/mL) was added in a 1:2 volume ratio to the diluted
Alhydrogel. The vial was vortexed at slow speed for 5 min and stored at 4C for 1 hour prior to vaccination. Each
vaccine dose in 50 μl volume contained 10 μg SpFN, 20 μg 3D-PHAD, and 10 μg QS21 (ALFQ) or 10 μg SpFN
and 30 µg AL3+ (AH).

Flow cytometric phenotyping and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)
Spectral flow cytometry was performed to analyze APCs and T cells in the lymph nodes as indicated. Single cell
suspensions were treated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) for 5 minutes at 4C before further staining. Live dead
blue dye (Invitrogen) was used to stain dead cells. Analysis of APC and T cell phenotypes were performed using
the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in table S1. Intracellular cytokine analysis was performed to identify
SARS-CoV2 spike-specific T cells. Single cell suspensions from the draining lymph node were plated at 0.5x106
cells per well in a 96-well plate and stimulated with the spike (S) 1 or S2 peptide pools from JPT at a final
concentration of 1 g/mL for 6 hours at 37C in RPMI and 10% FBS. To prevent the secretion of cytokines,
GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) was added 1 hour after the addition of peptides. Spike-specific T cells were measured
by surface staining followed by fixation and permeabilization using BD fixation/permeabilization solution kit
(BD Biosciences,) and intracellular cytokine staining (table S1). As negative and positive controls, cells were
cultured in stimulation media without peptide stimulation or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and
ionomycin (BioLegend), respectively. T cells were considered to be responsive to peptide stimulation if the
frequency of cytokine-expressing T cells was greater than 0.01% of the parent population after background
subtraction. Samples were analyzed on a 5-laser Cytek Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek Biosciences). The data

were analyzed using FlowJo software v10 (Tree Star, Inc.). Gating strategy for APC subsets, T cell phenotyping
and ICS are shown in fig. 1SA and fig. 2SC, respectively.
Cryopreserved splenocytes were quickly thawed and added to 10 mL of complete RPMI 1640 media
supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% Pen-strep followed by viability assessment by trypan blue exclusion method.
Approximately, 1x106 splenocytes were cultured in the presence of peptide pools directed towards SARS CoV-2
spike protein S1 or S2 (JPT) (1µg/mL) at 37°C, 5% CO2. After 1 hour of incubation with peptides, protein
transport inhibitor (BD Golgi Plug™ containing Brefeldin A, 1 µg/mL and BD Golgi Stop™ containing
monensin, 1 µg/mL, BD Biosciences) was added for an additional 5 hours at 37°C, 5% CO 2. For the positive
control, cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich; 50 ng/mL and 1 μg/mL final
concentration, respectively) or concavalin A (positive control for IL-4), while media served as a negative control.
After the incubation period, cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen),
followed by surface staining with antibodies specific for the following cell surface markers (BUV737 anti-CD3,
BUV395 anti-CD4, BV711 anti-CD8 (table S4), obtained from either BD Biosciences, Thermo Fisher Scientific
or Biolegend, washed twice with FACS buffer and then fixed/permeabilized for 40 mins at 4°C in the dark using
the eBioscience™ Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per the
manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then incubated with a panel of intracellular antibodies specific for the
following cytokines (V450 anti-IFN-γ, FITC anti-TNF-, PerCP-Cy5 anti-IL-4, PE anti IL-2; table S4) for 30
min at 4°C, washed twice, and resuspended in FACS buffer. Appropriate single-color compensation controls and
Fluorescence minus one (FMO) control were prepared simultaneously and were included in each analysis. Flow
cytometric analysis was performed on an BD LSR II flow cytometer, and data were acquired using Diva software
(BD Biosciences). The results were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Evaluation of co-expression of
different cytokines was performed using the FlowJo Boolean gate platform. The gating strategy applied for the
evaluation of flow cytometry-acquired data is provided in fig. S5.

Cytokine levels were measured using V-Plex Plus Multi-Spot Assay plates, from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD,
Rockville, MD). We used the mouse Pro-inflammatory panel containing IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,
KC/GRO (CXCL1), IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF-α. The kit included diluent, wash buffer, detection antibody
solution and read buffer, as well as calibrators and controls for each analyte, from the manufacturer. Plates were
washed three times with MSD wash buffer before the addition of MSD reference standard and calibrator controls
used for quantifying antibody concentrations. Serum samples were diluted 1:2 in MSD diluent buffer, then added
to the wells in duplicate. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C, then washed three times. MSD detection
antibody solution was added to each well, plates were incubated for 2 hours at RT with shaking at 500 rpm then
washed three times. MSD 2x read buffer T was added to each well. Plates were read by MESO SECTOR S 120
Reader. Analyte concentration was calculated using DISCOVERY WORKBENCH® MSD Software and reported
as picograms/mL. For cell supernatants, approximately 1x106 cells were cultured in the presence of peptide pools
directed towards SARS CoV-2 spike protein (JPT, 1µg/mL) for 6 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were centrifuged
at 500 g for 10 minutes and the supernatant was collected. Supernatants were diluted 1:2 in MSD diluent buffer
and subsequently processed as described above.

ELISpot
Multiscreen plates (Millipore, Bedford MA) were coated with anti-IFN-γ antibody (capture mAb; 1 µg/mL)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Plates were blocked using
culture medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS, Pen/Strep, HEPES, NEAA, sodium pyruvate, 2-mercaptoethanol).

processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were counted and data analyzed using the AID
Autoimmun Diagnostica GmbH ELISpot reader (Strassberg,Germany) and software. T cell responses were
considered positive when the mean spot count exceeded the mean ± 3 SD of the negative control wells.
Enumeration of SARS CoV-2 Spike-specific CD8+ T cells by tetramer staining
MHC Class I or H-2Kb restricted SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide (aa 539-546; VNFNFNGL)-PE conjugated tetramer
(NIH tetramer core facility) was used for the detection of antigen specific CD8+ T cells. (see table S2 for a list of
tetramers used in the assay). Approximately, 1x106 freshly isolated splenocytes from mice were first stained with
a dead cell discrimination dye (Aqua stain, 1:1000 dilution, Invitrogen) for 30 minutes at 4°C followed by washing
twice with 1XPBS. Cells were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 for 30 mins followed by further incubation
with 1µL (1.2µg) of PE-conjugated H-2Kb SARS CoV-2 spike-specific tetramer for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.
After washing, cells were further surface stained with BUV737-anti-mouse CD3, BUV395-anti-mouse CD4,
BV711-anti-mouse CD8a and incubated for an additional 30 mins in the dark at room temperature, washed twice,
and resuspended in FACS buffer. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer and
data were acquired using Diva software (BD Biosciences). The results were analyzed using FlowJo software
(TreeStar). Appropriate single-color compensation controls and fluorescence minus one (FMO) control were
prepared simultaneously and were included. Staining with H-2Kd restricted SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide (aa 365373; CYGVSPTKL)-PE conjugated tetramer served as a control tetramer in this analysis.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific (Tetramer positive) CD8+ T cells secreting cytokines by flow
cytometry
To detect the epitope specific CD8+ T cell cytokine production, we combined antigen stimulation with tetramer
labelling and intracellular cytokine staining. Splenocytes (2 × 106/well) were cultured in a 96-well v-bottom plate
in the presence of peptide pools directed towards SARS CoV-2 spike protein S1 (1µg/mL) at 37°C, 5% CO2.
After 1 hour of incubation with peptides, protein transport inhibitor (BD Golgi Plug™ containing Brefeldin A, 1
µg/mL and BD Golgi Stop™ containing monensin, 1 µg/mL, BD Biosciences) was added followed by an
additional 5-hour incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation period, cells were washed at 300 g at

4°C for 7 mins, then labeled with a dead cell discrimination dye (Aqua stain, 1:1000 dilution, Invitrogen) for 30
mins at 4°C followed by washing twice with 1XPBS. Cells were fixed/permeabilized for 40 mins at 4°C in the
dark using the eBioscience™ Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set as per the manufacturer's
instructions. Cells were then blocked for 20 min at 4°C in Fc-blocking solution (5 μg/mL of CD16/CD32 mAb,
eBioscience, USA) and further stained for 40 mins at RT with 1µL (1.2µg) MHC class I or H-2Kb restricted
SARS-CoV-2-spike peptide (aa 539-546; VNFNFNGL)-PE conjugated tetramer (NIH tetramer core facility)
diluted in Perm/wash buffer. In the last 20 min of tetramer incubation, the following mix of fluorescent antibodies
were added: BUV737-anti-mouse CD3, BUV395-anti-mouse CD4, BV711-anti-mouse CD8a and antibodies
directed towards intracellular cytokines such as V450 anti-IFN-γ, FITC anti-TNF-, and APC anti IL-2
(Supplementary Table 4), then washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer. Appropriate single-color
compensation controls and Fluorescence minus one (FMO) control were prepared simultaneously and were
included in each analysis. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer and data were
acquired using Diva software (BD Biosciences). The results were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Staining with H-2Kd restricted SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptide (aa 365-373; CYGVSPTKL)-PE conjugated tetramer
served as a control tetramer in this analysis.

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing assay

Single cell suspensions from spleens of vaccinated mice were used as effector cells and naive spleens were used
as target cells. Target cells were prepared by diluting cells to 20x106/mL and making 2 x 500 µL aliquots (10x106
each). One aliquot was incubated in the presence of SARS CoV-2 spike protein specific peptides
LVKNKCVNFNFNGLT and KCVNFNFNGLTGTGV at 1 µg/mL (JPT) and the other aliquot was incubated in
media for 45 min in a 37C water bath. Both aliquots were washed twice with 3 mL PBS. CFSE high and low
solutions were made at 0.5 and 0.05 µM respectively using ThermoFisher CellTrace™ CFSE Cell Proliferation
Kit (Catalog C34554). Peptide pulsed and non-pulsed cells were resuspended respectively in CFSE high and low
solutions, incubated for 10 min in a 37C water bath, and then washed twice in media. Target cells were
resuspended at 2x106/mL and 50 µL of each CFSE high and low (1:1, CFSE high:CFSE low) was added to each

well. Effector cells were resuspended at 40x106/mL (10x106 cells in 250 µL) and 2-fold serial dilutions were
made by adding 125 µL of cells to 125 µL of media. 100 µL of each dilution was added to a well containing the
target cell mixture, bringing the total volume to 200 µL. Cells were co-incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Following incubation, cells were stained with Live/Dead Aqua stain (1:1000 dilution) (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 30 minutes at 4°C followed by washing twice with 1XPBS. Then, the cells were blocked with antimouse CD16/CD32 for 30 mins followed by further incubation with 1µL (1.2µg) of PE-conjugated H-2Kb
spike(539-546)-specific tetramer for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. After washing, cells were further stained with
BUV737-anti-mouse CD3, BUV395-anti-mouse CD4, BV711-anti-mouse CD8a and incubated for an additional
30 mins in the dark at room temperature. Flow cytometric acquisition and data analysis were performed as
described above with appropriate controls.

Statistical analysis
Flow cytometric data were analyzed using FlowJo v.10.0.8 (BD). Data are displayed as dot plots, or bar graphs.
AH and ALFQ groups were compared by unpaired Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test or Pearson
correlation. Graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism v.8.4.0. Statistical analyses were conducted using
GraphPad Prism v.8.4.0 software. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Fig. 1. APC recruitment in response to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (SpFN) adjuvanted with ALFQ (SpFN+ALFQ) versus AH
(SpFN+AH).
(A) Schematic of vaccination schedule and sample collection. C57BL/6 mice received a prime-boost vaccination regimen with SpFN
formulated with either AH (SpFN+AH) or ALFQ (SpFN+ALFQ). At days 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10, spleen, lymph nodes draining the left
quadriceps (dLN), and blood were collected. Three weeks (day 42) after the second vaccination (day 21) spleen, mediastinal LN,
lungs, and blood were collected. (B) The tSNE display of the APC subsets identified by the gating strategy is shown in Fig. S1A. (C)
Pie representation comparing the number of recruited APCs measured in the dLNs at days 3 and 5 in response to the two vaccine
formulations (n = 5/group/time point) or from naïve mice (n = 4). Eleven APC subsets were identified. Each slice indicates an APC
subset; N indicates the average of the total number of APCs recruited in the dLNs. (D-E) The number of (D) conventional (cDC1,
cDC2) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and (E) macrophage subsets in both vaccine groups at both time points. (F) Activation of cDCs
indicated by CD80 and CD86 and (G) macrophage subsets by CD80 and CD40 in both vaccine groups at both time points. Bars
indicate mean + SD. MCM= medullary cord macrophage, MSM=Medullary sinus macrophage, moDC=monocyte derived DC.
Experiments were repeated twice and differences between the two groups were analyzed by using non-parametric Mann–Whitney Utest with p ≤ 0.05 considered as statistically significant.

Fig. 6. Epitope mapping data in the splenocytes of SpFN vaccinated C57BL/6 mice at week 6 following prime- boost
vaccination.
(A) Schematic representation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein showing the different domains with amino acid (aa) numbers. Red
asterisk denotes the identified H2Kb/Db-restricted epitopes. (B) Amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein peptide pools.
Matrix pools (4, 5, and 38) and overlapping peptide pools of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 aa (19, 24, and 48) containing 315
peptides across the entire glycoprotein were tested in the ELISpot assay. Reactivity to specific matching sequences in pools are
highlighted with different matching colors and represent the predicted epitopes for H2K b/Db (iedb.org) or predicted epitopes without
ELISpot responses (blue highlight; hypothetical epitope). The overlapping peptide pool covering aa 169-1187 (pool 17) did not show
any reactivity (data not shown); aa sequences 13-27 (pool 4) and 17-31 (pool 5) have been highlighted in color to indicate confirmed
epitopes based on ELISpot reactivity to peptide pool 14, which contains overlapping peptides aa 1-67 with spot counts of 54, 56, 54
(data not shown). (C) Number of spike-specific IFN-γ spot forming units stimulated with 52 peptide pools from the Epitope Mapping
Peptide Set of the spike protein is presented as scatter plots (mean ± SD/ 4 x 10 5 splenocytes). ELISpot images of triplicate wells and
the stimulants are shown on the X-axis. T cell responses were considered positive when mean spot count exceeded the mean ± 3 SD of
the negative control wells. Splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with media (negative control), anti-CD3 (positive control), or SARS
CoV-2 spike peptide pools 4, 5, 19, 24, 38, and 44.

differences in the frequency of the SARS-Cov-2 spike-specific CD8+ T cells concomitantly producing both IFN-γ and TNF-α. Bars
represent the mean + SD. and significant differences between the groups were calculated using non-parametric two-tailed MannWhitney U test in Graph pad prism version 8. (F) CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality: Differences in the ability of CD8+ T cells stimulated
with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides to secrete more than one cytokine. Boolean gating was applied to identify all combinations of CD8+
T cell effector functions. The pie chart depicts the average proportion of spike-specific CD8+ T cells producing all three (IFN-γ, IL-2
or TNF-α), any two or any one cytokine. The graphs show cytokine-secreting peptide-dspecific CD8+ T cells for each individual
mouse (n = 5 /group) in response to each adjuvant formulation. This analysis was performed using the SPICE software version
5.1(54).
