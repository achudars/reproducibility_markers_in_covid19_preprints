Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected more than 70 million people worldwide and resulted in over 1.5
million deaths. A broad deployment of effective immunization campaigns to achieve population
immunity at global scale will depend on the biological and logistical attributes of the vaccine. Here, two
adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based vaccine candidates demonstrate potent immunogenicity in mouse
and nonhuman primates following a single injection. Peak neutralizing antibody titers remain sustained at
5 months and are complemented by functional memory T-cells responses. The AAVrh32.33 capsid of the
AAVCOVID vaccine is an engineered AAV to which no relevant pre-existing immunity exists in
humans. Moreover, the vaccine is stable at room temperature for at least one month and is produced at
high yields using established commercial manufacturing processes in the gene therapy industry. Thus, this
methodology holds as a very promising single dose, thermostable vaccine platform well-suited to address
emerging pathogens on a global scale.

INTRODUCTION
A severe acute respiratory disease syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus was first reported in
December 2019 (COVID-19 disease) and was subsequently shown to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou
et al., 2020). A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 has been extensively sought since early
2020, when the virus was first isolated and sequenced. A prophylactic vaccination program using an
effective vaccine candidate would represent one of the best means to mitigate the health and economic
burdens imposed by this pandemic. Based on prior work on SARS-CoV-1 and other respiratory viruses,
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) was considered an attractive antigen target for the induction of
protective immunity to the virus (Folegatti et al., 2020a; Graham et al., 2020; Koch et al., 2020; Martin et
al., 2008; Modjarrad et al., 2019; Muthumani et al., 2015; van Doremalen et al., 2020a). This viral
envelope glycoprotein engages the ACE-2 cellular receptor through its receptor binding domain (RBD), a
key target for developing neutralizing antibodies (Wang et al., 2020). Antigenicity of a full-length S
protein can be further enhanced by select proline substitutions that maintain the S protein in a pre-fusion
conformation (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). The utility of employing this antigen as a
vaccination target has been validated by reports of substantial protective efficacy in several human
vaccine studies (Folegatti et al., 2020b; Jackson et al., 2020).
The magnitude of this crisis has motivated the initiation of over 200 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in
development across various technology platforms (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draftlandscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines). Inactivated viral and gene-based vaccines progressed
particularly rapidly with the start of the first Phase 1 studies ocurring about 3 months after the
identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. The various gene-based vaccines encode for SARS-CoV2 or RBD-containing sequences and leverage different gene delivery platforms including unencapsulated
or naked DNA delivered by electroporation (Patel et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020), mRNA delivered mostly
by lipid nanoparticles (Anderson et al., 2020; Corbett et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2020; Kalnin et al.,
2020; Kremsner et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and viral vectors such as vesicular

stomatitis virus (VSV) (Case et al., 2020), adenovirus (Feng et al., 2020; Folegatti et al., 2020b; Hassan et
al., 2020; Logunov et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020a; Zhu
et al., 2020b) or yellow fever virus (Sanchez-Felipe et al., 2020). The worldwide COVID-19 vaccine
development efforts are in different stages of development, however, less than a year after the start of the
outbreak, at least three of the gene-based vaccine candidates appear to be efficacious and have
demonstrated favorable short-term safety in large Phase 3 studies and two have received the Emergency
Use Approval (EUA) by the FDA (https://www.fda.gov/media/144412/download,
https://www.fda.gov/media/144636/download).
As public health programs race to vaccinate individuals with these early wave vaccines, some of the
limitations of the first-generation vaccines are becoming increasingly apparent, especially when attributes
required for global distribution outside the U.S. and Europe are considered. The cold chain storage
requirement and reliance on more than one injection to induce protective immunity are major limitations
of some of the first-generation vaccines (Folegatti et al., 2020b; Jackson et al., 2020). It is less clear at this
time, but issues such as post-inoculation reactogenicity, durability of immune responses, and efficacy in
populations with known vulnerabilities to COVID-19, such as the elderly and obese, may also be
attributes upon which second wave vaccines can improve (Biswas et al., 2020; Cuschieri and Grech,
2020). Moreover, little is known at this time about the expense and reliability of scale-up manufacturing
that will be critical in assessing the feasibility of using any vaccine in global vaccine campaigns.
Here, we interrogate the safety and immunogenicity of two novel adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector
vaccines in mice and nonhuman primates (NHP). In addition, to address some of the logistical and
biological hurdles in the global distribution challenge mentioned above, we evaluated whether these
genetic vaccines are immunogenic following a single injection, induce immune responses in animal
models of obesity and aging, demonstrate long-term durable responses, and retain activity at various
storage temperatures.

Wild type AAV is a non-enveloped single stranded DNA dependoparvovirus with broad host range
including nonhuman and human primates. AAV serotypes of all characterized versions to date are not
associated with human disease, yet many serotypes are endemic and antibodies directed at those serotypes
are prevalent in human populations (Calcedo et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2004). Replication defective viral
vector particles can be produced by providing in trans viral open reading frames to a recombinant genome
composed of the transgene and AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), the only viral element retained.
Based on studies with natural and engineered variants, the AAV capsid is known to be a primary
determinant of biodistribution, immunogenicity, production yield, and efficiency of gene transfer
(Salganik et al., 2015; Vandenberghe et al., 2009b).
To date, AAV-based vectors have primarily been used for therapeutic gene transfer in genetically defined
diseases such as hemophilia and spinal muscular atrophy type I (High and Roncarolo, 2019). Four
decades of AAV research has established an overall favorable safety profile in preclinical and clinical
studies and has led to the commercialization of 3 products initially approved by US FDA and European
EMA: Glybera, Luxturna, and Zolgensma. AAV is generally well tolerated via several local routes of
administration, including intramuscular (IM) injection, and large doses delivered systemically, typically
by intravenous injection, have been commonly used in human clinical trials (Bennett et al., 2016; High
and Roncarolo, 2019; Mendell et al., 2017; Stroes et al., 2008). Safety, in part, is thought to be due to the
low pro-inflammatory responses to the AAV capsid that allows for a tolerogenic or anergic environment
to be established toward a self-transgene product (Mingozzi and High, 2017). However, transgenes that
are foreign to the host are known to lead to antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunogenicity, tissue
inflammation, and the potential elimination of the transgene product or the transgene expressing cell (Gao
et al., 2009; Vandenberghe and Wilson, 2007). While undesirable in therapeutic gene therapy
applications, the inflammatory potential of AAV has been leveraged in several preclinical and clinical
vaccine studies (Lin et al., 2009; Mehendale et al., 2008; Nieto and Salvetti, 2014; Vardas et al., 2010).

AAVrh32.33 is a hybrid serotype capsid that is phylogenetically distinct from commonly used gene
therapy AAVs such as AAV2, AAV8 or AAV9, with a sequence identity less than 70% (Figure 1B)
(Calcedo et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009; R et al., 2009; Vandenberghe et al., 2009a). In contrast to most
AAVs studied to date, AAVrh32.33, following intramuscular injection (IM), elicits a pro-inflammatory
response in mice, declining transgene expression over time, and pronounced local inflammatory infiltrates
(Lin et al., 2009; Mays et al., 2009; Mays et al., 2013). Moreover, in an extensive sero-epidemiological
study of AAVrh32.33, less than 2% of subjects carried neutralizing responses above a titer of 1:20
(Calcedo et al., 2009). These rare, low titer antibody levels did not reduce vaccine efficacy due to
neutralization when AAVrh32.33 was used as the vaccine vector in contrast to what was observed when
AAV vectors were used to which higher titer antibodies were prevalent (Lin et al., 2009). Previously,
these key attributes of AAVrh32.33 compelled us and others to explore the potential of this AAV
serotype as a vaccine platform. This earlier work established viability as potential vaccine via proof-ofconcept studies in an influenza murine challenge model, a mouse and NHP HIV immunogenicity study,
as well as in applications in dengue and HCV infections (Li et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2015;
Zhu et al., 2019). Collectively, these studies provided evidence of potent, durable, and functional B and
T-cell responses.
Upon the news of the emerging epidemic in Wuhan, China and the sequencing of the likely etiological
agent (Wu et al., 2020), we initiated the development of several AAVrh32.33-based vaccine candidates
(AAVCOVID). Two gene-based vaccine candidates were selected, which encode different versions of the
SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. AAVCOVID19-1 (AC1) encodes a full-length S protein locked in a prefusion
conformation that is designed to be expressed on the cell membrane of transduced cells, whereas
AAVCOVID19-3 (AC3) candidate’s S protein is shorter and engineered to be secreted.
Here, the two AAVCOVID vaccine candidates are shown to elicit strong B and T cell immunogenic
responses following a single intramuscular injection in rodents and NHPs. These immunogenic responses
have proven long-lived, with levels remaining at peak or near peak levels for at least 5 months following

the initial injection. AAVCOVID is minimally reactogenic in NHPs, can be manufactured at scale with
standard industrial processes, and importantly, remains stable during storage at room temperature for at
least one month. Combined, these attributes make AAVCOVID a promising candidate for a safe,
effective and protective vaccine, amenable to manufacturing at scale and broad distribution that could
contribute to the challenge of addressing the global need for vaccines against COVID-19.

RESULTS
Design and production of AAVCOVID vaccines
AC1 and AC3 are both viral vector COVID-19 vaccine candidates composed of an AAVrh32.33 capsid
and an AAV2 ITR-flanked transgene expressing distinct SARS-CoV-2 S antigens. Figure 1A depicts
AC1 which encodes a full-length membrane anchored S protein based on the Wuhan sequence, modified
by amino-acid substitutions that prevent S1/S2 furin cleavage and stabilize S in a pre-fusion conformation
for optimal RBD exposure and antigenicity (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). AC3 expresses the
secreted S1 subunit of the Wuhan S protein (Figure 1A). AAVrh32.33 is a previously described rhesus
derived AAV serotype. It is most closely related to AAV4 but phylogenetically divergent from the AAVs
that are most commonly circulating and used as gene therapy vectors in humans (Figure 1B). Previously it
was shown in an extensive human epidemiological study that the seroprevalence of antibodies to
AAVrh32.33 is minimal (Calcedo et al., 2009). Consistent with these findings, 50 plasma samples
collected from healthy donors demonstrated highly reduced antibody prevalence to AAVrh32.33 as
compared with that seen to AAV8 and AAV2, with 6% of samples with titers of 1:20 or above compared
to 22% and 28% respectively (Figure 1C). In terms of production yields, in more than 10 research grade
preparations, AC1 was shown to be comparable to serotypes AAV8 and AAV9, while AC3 showed
slightly reduced productivity (Figure 1D). The capsid identity of AC1 and AC3 is consistent with
AAVrh32.33 in the AAV-ID thermostability assay (Figure 1E) (Pacouret et al., 2017).
Given the need for scaled production of vaccines, we evaluated whether AC1 and AC3 manufacturing
was feasible with a previously established scalable process developed by Novartis Gene Therapies.
Specifically, approximately 1.5 x 1010 HEK293 were seeded in a fixed-bed bioreactor (PALL iCellis 500),
grown for 4 days, and then co-transfected with the AAVCOVID ITR plasmids, pKan2/rh32.33 for the
AAV capsid and pALDX80 as helper. At harvest, yields for AC1 and AC3 were above 7 x 1015 genome
containing particles or genome copies (gc). Subsequent purification included multiple tangential flow
filtration (TFF), an ion-exchange chromatography and a cesium chloride density gradient step to

eventually recover between 21% and 26% in the final drug substance (Figure 1F). Of note, given the
expedited nature of these studies, less than 2 weeks of process development studies were performed to
successfully adapt the existing scalable production system to AAVrh32.33.
Lastly, expression of the S transgene was detected for each AAVCOVID candidate in vitro by
transfection and transduction (Figures 1G and S1). Higher expression of AC3 was detected at mRNA
(Figure S1A) and protein level (Figures 1G and S1).

A single dose of AAVCOVID induces high and durable antibody titer in two mouse strains
The immunogenicity of AC1 and AC3 following a single injection at a low and high dose of 1010 and 1011
gc, respectively, in the gastrocnemius muscle was evaluated in 6-10-week-old BALB/C and C57BL/6
mice of both genders. SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) RBD-binding IgG antibody levels were monitored by
ELISA at regular intervals (Figures 2A and 2B), as were neutralizing antibody levels assayed using a
SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped lentivirus (pseudovirus) inhibition-of-transduction method (Figures 2C
and 2D).
Both mouse strains demonstrated dose-dependent potent binding and neutralizing responses from a single
dose administration of AC1 or AC3 that persisted through 3 months. Overall, AC1 at high doses induced
a significantly higher level of binding and neutralizing antibody titers to SARS-CoV-2 (binding geometric
mean titer (GMT) of 305,922 and 522,060 in BALB/c and C57BL/6, respectively; and neutralizing GMT
of 2,416 and 9,123, 12 weeks post-vaccination) than AC3 (binding GMT of 14,485 and 248,284 in
BALB/c and C57BL/6, respectively; and neutralizing GMT of 302 and 1,356, 12 weeks postvaccination). At a low dose, AC1 was superior to AC3, particularly in C57BL/6 mice at later timepoints
(Figures 2A-2F). Immunogenicity was modestly lower in males versus female mice for both candidates
(Figures 2A-2D). The kinetics of binding-antibody induction showed early onset of responses by day 14
(Figure S2A) and increasing seroconversion rates over time (Figure S2B). Neutralizing antibody kinetics

lagged by approximately a week, with limited seroconversion at week 4 that increased thereafter (Figures
2C and 2D). Binding and neutralizing titers correlated; however, AC1 achieved higher neutralizing titers
and a larger relative ratio of neutralizing to binding titers compared to those produced by AC3 (Figures
2E and 2F).
Limited plaque reduction neutralizing assay titers (PRNT) with live SARS-CoV-2 were obtained for AC1
and AC3 in BALB/c mice 4 weeks after vaccination, showing the quality of response in terms of the
neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 live virus (Figure 2G). These responses correlated modestly well with
results from the pseudovirus neutralization assay (Figure 2H). ELISA IgG titers to SARS-CoV-2 S full
length ectodomain (SARS2 Ecto), SARS-CoV-1 S RBD (SARS RBD) or MERS S RBD were assayed
(Figure 2I). Antibody responses to full length S ectodomain (SARS2 Ecto) were modestly higher
compared to RBD titers (SARS2 RBD) (Figure 2I). Cross-reactivity of the elicited IgG with SARS RBD
was noted, but at reduced levels (Figure 2I), with no cross-reactivity detected against MERS RBD (data
not shown).
Lastly, to model the impact of AAV capsid pre-existing immunity on AAVCOVID immunogenicity in
humans, 24 and 2 hours before vaccination BALB/c mice received 15 mg of intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) derived from pooled samples from thousands of human donors. As a control, a single dose
immunization using the AC1 vector was compared to vaccination with an AAV1 capsid vector containing
an identical genome (AAV1-S). AAV1 is known to have higher pre-existing immunity in human
populations (Calcedo et al., 2009). Figure 2J shows that animals vaccinated with AC1 were unaffected by
the IVIG pretreatment, while AAV1-S had reduced seroconversion on day 21 compared to IVIG-naïve
animals.

AC1 elicits qualitatively distinct humoral response compared to AC3
Next, we assessed the quality of the humoral responses over time for each of the vaccine candidates in
BALB/c mice. In AC1-treated animals, IgM and IgA antibodies directed at SARS2 RBD were detected at
early timepoints, day 7 and 14 respectively, but the IgG isotype dominated circulating SARS2 RBDspecific antibody levels from thereon (Figure 3A). AC3 IgM and IgA levels were lower than those
observed for AC1. Total IgG levels were composed of all IgG subclasses when AC1 was utilized,
whereas IgG1 predominated when AC3 was injected. The ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 suggests a balanced Th1
response stimulated by AC1, with more Th2 skewing seen in the AC3 response (Figures 3A and 3B).
To further interrogate this divergent qualitative response, cytokine secretion and ELISPOT analyses were
performed on splenocytes from AC1 and AC3 immunized BALB/c and C57BL/6 animals. Secretion of
several cytokines was detected in stimulated splenocytes (Figures 3C and 3F). However, IFN- was
predominantly secreted and minimal levels of Th2-associated cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13, were
measured, except in BALB/c mice, where AC3 induced a greater IL-13 response (Figures 3C and 3F).
IFN- ELISPOT revealed a robust response against peptides spanning the S1 subunit (Figures 3D, 3G,
S3A and S3C), while lower responses were detected against the S2 subunit only in the AC1 vaccinated
group. Minimal IL4 responses were seen by IL4 ELISPOT (Figures 3E, 3H, S3B and S3D).

Immunogenicity of AAVCOVID is influenced by age but retains potency in obese mice
Vaccine efficacy is often impaired in obese or elderly humans, which are two of the most vulnerable
populations in the COVID-19 pandemic. To model this conditions, 18-week and 2-year-old mice of both
genders were immunized with AAVCOVID at low and high doses, bled at regular intervals, and analyzed
for SARS2 RBD IgG and pseudovirus neutralization responses in the serum. A reduction in IgG and
neutralizing titers is observed between 18-week and 2-year-old mice (Figures 4A-4D). 18-week-old and,
to a lesser extent, 2-year-old mice developed robust neutralizing titers upon vaccination with AC1

(Figures 4B and 4D), but the AC3 at high doses failed to recapitulate the results in younger mice (Figure
2D). Low doses and high dose of AC3 failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies in most of the 2-year-old
mice, while animals treated with a high dose of AC1 showed high titers but incomplete seroconversion
(Figures 4D and 4E). In aggregate, high dose AC1 demonstrates robust, albeit reduced immunogenicity in
aged mice, with clearly superior immunogenicity compared to that induced by AC3 in aged mice.
A diet-induced C57BL/6 obesity (DIO) mouse model was used to study vaccine efficacy in inducing
SARS2 RBD-specific antibodies in overweight animals. 12-week-old C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 DIO (n=10)
mice were vaccinated with 1010 and 1011 gc of AC1 and AC3. IgG RBD-binding and neutralizing
antibody levels were indistinguishable between lean and obese groups for AC1 and the high dose group of
AC3, yet interestingly the low dose of AC3 produced a less robust antibody response in the DIO mice
than did the comparable dose of AC1 (Figures 4F and 4G).

Durable neutralizing antigenicity in NHP from a single dose injection
To model the immunogenicity of AAVCOVID in humans, one female and one male rhesus macaque were
injected IM with 1012 gc of AC1 and AC3. Animals tolerated the vaccine dose well, with no temperature
elevations or local reactogenicity based on clinical examinations, complete blood counts and chemistry
(Figure S4), or cytokine analysis (Figure S5). Regular phlebotomies were performed to assess RBD
binding, pseudovirus neutralizing, and live SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in serum (Figures
5A, 5B and 5C) and B cell analysis from PBMCs (Figures 5D, 5E and 5F). These animals continue to be
monitored to assess the durability of the vaccine response and are currently at the 5-month time point
following the single dose immunization.
AC3 SARS2 RBD-binding antibody responses were detectable as early as week 3 after a single
administration and plateaued by week 5 hovering around 1:6,400 and 1:12,800 (Figure 5A). AC1 IgG, on
the contrary, only became apparent on week 5 and then steadily increased until week 10. One AC113

injected animal achieved similar antibody levels to those measured in both AC3 vaccinated primates
(1:12,800) while the other AC-1 vaccinated animal achieved levels that were 8-fold higher (Figure 5A).
With minimal fluctuation, SARS2 RBD IgG levels have been maintained to date at peak levels, now 20
weeks or 5 months after a single shot vaccine for both the AC1 and AC3 injections.
Pseudovirus neutralizing titers and PRNT closely tracked with a slight delay in the IgG kinetics for both
AC1 and AC3, reaching peak neutralizing titers 6 to 8 weeks after vaccination for AC3 (1:640 and
1:1,280) and 11 weeks following AC1 injection (1:1,280 and 1:10,240). These neutralizing antibody
responses have remained stable at peak levels through week 20 in the pseudovirus neutralizing assay and
16 weeks in the PRNT assay (Figures 5B and 5C), the last time points analyzed. Benchmarking of the
pseudovirus neutralizing assay was performed in 2 ways. First, 60 human convalescent plasma samples
from 3 cohorts were analyzed (Figure 5B) (non-hospitalized (GMT: 154), hospitalized yet not critical
(GMT: 508) and ICU patients (GMT: 1,576)), which demonstrated a clear increase of neutralizing titers
with severity of disease. Second, a provisional World Health Organization recommended reference
plasma (NISBC 20/130) yielded a 1:1,280 titer in our assay, which was in line with the reported values
(Figure 5B). In summary, AC1 induces neutralizing titers in the range of 1:1,280 and 1:10,240 which is in
the higher range of convalescence of hospitalized and ICU patients while AC3 leads to titers of 1:6401:1,280 which is in the range of hospitalized non-ICU patients. These titers persist for at least 5 months.
To track vaccine-induced peripheral blood B cells, a double-labeling technique with fluorophoreconjugated SARS2 recombinant RBD protein was utilized (Figure 5D) (Johnson et al., 2020; Knox et al.,
2017). RBD-binding memory B cells (MBCs) were absent at week 0 and detectable by week 4 in three of
the animals (Figure 5E). RBD-specific MBCs peaked in frequency at 6 weeks post-vaccination in all
recipients and were maintained at a similar level at least through week 14 (Figure 5E). Surface
immunoglobulin isotype analyses found an early bias toward generation of IgM-expressing MBCs,
whereas isotype switched (IgD-IgM-; likely IgG+) MBCs dominated the SARS2 RBD-specific response

by week 14 (Figure 5F). These findings suggest durable induction of SARS2 RBD-specific memory B
cells by both AC1 and AC3 vaccines.
Interestingly, in AC3 injected primates, the secreted S1 protein was detectable in their serum 2 weeks
after injection. However, the S protein returned to undetectable levels in both animals by week 4,
concurrent with increasing anti-SARS2 RBD antibody titers (Figure 5G). Similar to the mouse data,
SARS2 ectodomain IgG levels in NHP were higher than SARS2 RBD IgG, and modest cross-reactivity to
SARS1 RBD was detected (Figure 5H). Total IgG for both AC1 and AC3 animals was primarily
composed of IgG1, suggestive that in NHP, as opposed to mice, both responses appear more Th1-like
(Figure 5I).

Memory T cell response to Spike antigen is developed in NHP
T cell responses to transgene peptide pools (Figure S6A) were analyzed by IFN- ELISPOT (Figures 6A
and 6B) and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) (Figures 6C-6F) from PBMCs harvested at monthly
intervals. AC3 injected animals showed responses specific to the S1 subunit, higher in the female,
starting on week 4 (Figure 6B); however, lower responses were detected in the AC1 female starting on
week 8 and there was only a minimal response in the AC1 vaccinated male (Figure 6A).
Flow cytometry was used to identify the phenotype and functionality of S-specific cells after stimulating
PBMCs with the overlapping S1 peptides (note that S2-specific responses in AC1 animals, which were
clearly detected by ELISPOT, were not studied in this analyses). The female AC3 showed a robust
memory CD8+ T cell response to the S1 subunit beginning at week 6 (Figures 6C, 6D and S6B). CD107a+
IFNγ+ responding cells also produced TNFα at week 6 and 14 (Figures 6D and 6E), but the cytotoxic and
activation profile changed over time. At week 6, the S1 subunit-specific cells showed higher expression
of the cytotoxicity markers perforin and granzyme B and the activation marker KI67, compared to week
14 (Figure 6E). S1-specific memory CD4+ T cell responses were also detected through production of

TNFα and IL2 in the female treated with AC3 at week 6 and 14, although these were proportionately
lower compared to the corresponding memory CD8+ T cell responses (Figures 6F and S6C).

NHPs develop slow neutralizing antibody response to AAVrh32.33 capsid that shows no cross-reactivity
with other AAV serotypes
Viral vectored vaccines are known to induce responses to the delivery vector component, in this case to
the AAV capsid. These can enhance the overall immunogenicity of the vaccine, influence its
reactogenicity, or prevent the effectiveness of subsequent dosing with a homologous vector due to the
neutralization of the vector upon re-administration (Greig et al., 2016; Majowicz et al., 2017). Similarly,
in the context of AAV, the cross-reactivity of these antibodies may affect subsequent applications of
alternative AAV serotypes that could be neutralized via cross-reactive antibodies to AAVrh32.33, thus
potentially influencing future applications of gene therapy for subjects vaccinated with AAVCOVID. In
this rhesus study, Table S1 shows that AAVrh32.33 neutralizing antibodies did develop, albeit with slow
kinetics and to relatively low levels. Importantly, these modest AAV neutralizing responses did not
exhibit cross-neutralization of a panel of commonly used AAV gene therapy serotypes AAV1, 2, 5, 8, and
9 (Table S1 and Figure S7A). In addition, no significant increase in cellular responses against capsid
peptides were detected in PBMCs up to 2 months after vaccination (Figure S7B).

Vector is retained in the injection site and cleared over time in mouse
A biodistribution of the vector following AAVCOVID intramuscular injection was analyzed to establish
the kinetics of transgene expression and identify which tissues were transduced beyond that of the
intended muscle target (Figure S8). Previously, an AAVrh32.33 expressing a non-self-transgene, when
injected intramuscularly in mice, showed declining transgene expression over time that was associated
with increasing inflammatory infiltrates at the injection site several weeks after injection (Mays et al.,
16

2009; Mays et al., 2013). This is in stark contrast to other AAVs expressing the same transgene which led
to stable transgene expression and minimal local inflammation (Mays et al., 2009; Mays et al., 2013). In
the current experiment, C57BL/6 mice were injected with 1011 gc in the right gastrocnemius muscle.
Animals were euthanized 1, 4 and 8 weeks after vaccination and tissues were analyzed for vector genome
copies and transgene expression. As observed in Figure S8A, vector genome copies in the injected muscle
decreased more than 20-fold from week 1 to week 8. AC3 transgene expression declined in a manner
similar to the decline in DNA vector genome copy number. Remarkably, AC1 transgene expression was
lower than AC3 expression, close to background levels, possibly due to lower promoter activity (Figure
S8B). Gene transfer and transduction levels of the contralateral gastrocnemius muscle, liver, and spleen
demonstrated 10-100-fold less vector DNA at week 1 than measured in the injected muscle with a steady
decline of vector DNA and RNA, at times to undetectable levels (Figures S8A and S8C). A more
comprehensive biodistribution study in BALB/c mice that received the 1011 gc IM dose of AC3 and were
euthanized at week 8 further indicated that the predominant tissue of vector genome and transgene
expression was the injected muscle (Figure S8D).

AAVCOVID is stable and retains potency after one-month room temperature storage
To interrogate the cold chain requirements for storage and transportation of AAVCOVID, research grade
vaccine preparations were aliquoted and stored at different temperature conditions (-80⁰C, 4⁰C or room
temperature (RT)) for 1, 3, 7 or 28 days. Physical vector stability was assessed by titration of DNAse
resistant vector genomes and loss or degradation was assessed by comparison to vector aliquots stored at 80⁰ C (Figure 7A and Table S2). After being stored at 4⁰C or RT, neither AC1 nor AC3 show a reduction
of titers for at least one month. In addition, potency was assessed by injection of 5 x 1010 gc of AC1
aliquots in female BALB/c mice. Animals vaccinated with AC1 stored at 4⁰C or RT for up to 28 days
showed similar levels of antibody compared to a control group that received vaccine vectors stored at -

need to be performed to elucidate if potency can be maintained for longer periods.

DISCUSSION
The development of safe and effective vaccines is vital to the worldwide effort to reduce the burden on
global health and economic vitality that has been disrupted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An
unprecedented and remarkable effort has led several vaccine candidates to be authorized or approved for
commercial use in less than a year since the etiological agent was identified, and several others are
nearing that milestone. However, beyond safety and efficacy, other vaccines attributes will likely be
critical to achieving the desired long-lasting herd immunity at a global population scale. Many of these
considerations are logistical in nature and seek to reduce the cost, time, and complexity of vaccine
distribution using available infrastructure around the world. These considerations are particularly germane
to producing effective vaccine campaigns in developing nations. Biological features, such as potency
from a single dose, durability of protection, and stability at ambient temperature, are pivotal to these
logistical efforts. Vaccines addressing these challenges should substantially blunt the disproportionate
impact COVID-19 is having on the health and economic vitality of under-resourced communities in more
advanced economies and in nations with fewer financial resources.
Here, we report the development of two vaccine candidates, named AAVCOVID19-1 (AC1) and
AAVCOVID19-3 (AC3), based on a unique AAV vaccine platform. We hypothesized that this
methodology can address several limitations of first generation COVID vaccines. Indeed, both
AAVCOVID vaccine candidates were shown in mice and NHPs to elicit robust neutralizing antibody
responses following a single dose administration. This contrasts with front-runner vaccines, which require
2 injections spaced by 3 or more weeks (Folegatti et al., 2020b; Jackson et al., 2020; Logunov et al.,
2020; Walsh et al., 2020). Compared to a single dose vaccine, a multiple dose regimen complicates a
vaccination campaign by increasing cost, reducing compliance, and multiplying the manufacturing needs.
Similarly, durable vaccine responses prolong or prevent the need for boost injections over time, resulting
in similar benefits just described for single prime injection vaccines. AAVCOVID candidates have been
shown in NHPs to retain peak immunogenicity for at least 5 months following a single dose injection.

The durability of other vaccine candidates remains to be determined, although a recent report on the
Moderna follow up from a Phase 1 study reported the maintenance of a robust, albeit modestly declining,
antibody response in 34 participants across age groups (Widge et al., 2020).
While it remains difficult to project the efficacy of the AAVCOVID vaccines based on immunological
readouts alone, current data suggest an important role of neutralizing antibody responses in the prevention
or mitigation of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; McMahan et al., 2020;
Mercado et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). AAVCOVID in NHP leads to neutralizing antibody levels between
1:1,024 and 1:12,800, exceeding titers in convalescent, symptomatic, non-hospitalized patients and within
the range of hospitalized and ICU convalescent COVID-19 patients. Previously reported NHP SARSCoV-2 challenge studies indicate that neutralizing titers of greater than 1:100 are protective against
disease (McMahan et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Further studies of the AAVCOVID
vaccines are in progress that explore significant dose reductions from what is reported in this study as
well as SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies that will establish whether the immune responses achieved at
those lower doses laed to protective immunity.
Based on clinical observations and laboratory findings, local and systemic safety and reactogenicity was
minimal in the mouse and NHP studies at all the doses tested, indicative of a favorable safety and
reactogenicity profile of AAVCOVID candidates. If these findings bear out clinically, they may indicate a
more limited reactogenicity compared to those seen in mRNA and adenoviral COVID-19 vaccine
candidates (Corbett et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). However, AAVrh32.33 has never
been used in humans, and thus warrants additional scrutiny, particularly given the potential for use as a
preventative vaccine in a healthy population where the risk-benefit ratio may substantially differ from that
present in gene therapy trials. Safety concerns may be allayed given the extensive clinical experience with
AAV in gene therapy applications via local - including intramuscular - or systemic routes of
administration, the latter often at doses exceeding the doses proposed here by 100 to 1000-fold. These
systemic studies have highlighted the potential for moderate to severe dose-related events of

hepatotoxicity (Chand et al., 2020). Unlike most of the vectors pursued in gene therapy studies,
AAVrh32.33 is minimally hepatotropic, particularly with the low dose intramuscular injections presented
here (Figure S8D). Another concern in the use of AAV vectors as vaccines is the potential for persistent
antigen expression, which is the attribute that has made them so attractive as gene therapy vectors.
Persistent antigen could lead to desensitization of the host toward the antigen through mechanisms of
anergy or tolerance. Previously, in a heterologous prime-boost HIV vaccine study in NHPs, rh32.33
functionally recalled both B and T-cell responses to a greater extent than an analogous AAV8 vaccine
(Lin et al., 2009). The data supports the hypothesis that AAVrh32.33 has a vaccine appropriate
phenotype, unlike other AAVs, since upon IM injection, the AAV capsid acts as an adjuvant to establish a
pro-inflammatory local environment that leads to extinction of transgene expression (Figure S8). The data
presented in this study indicates that the biodistribution data of AAVCOVID make systemic liver toxicity
following an IM injection very unlikely. Furthermore, the transgene expression data provide reassuring
evidence that persistent antigen expression will also not be a limiting feature of AAVCOVID use. Taken
together, these findings substantially de-risk the platform and ongoing toxicology and safety experiments
are intended to further address these important issues.
An important attribute of any vaccine is its efficacy across all possible treatment populations enabling
protection of the most vulnerable and thereby maximizing the potential to achieve population immunity.
Here, we build on the minimal pre-existing immunity to AAVrh32.33, which should preclude significant
numbers of individuals from failing to respond, as has been demonstrated for AAVs and other viral
vectors for which pre-existing immunity rates are much higher (Fausther-Bovendo and Kobinger, 2014;
Lin et al., 2009). Moreover, AAVCOVID induces only low-level anti-capsid responses in NHP,
potentially permitting subsequent homologous boosts, as a prior study demonstrated AAV IM readministration to be unaffected by serum AAV neutralizing antibody titers that do not exceed 1:160
(Greig et al., 2016). In addition, capsid antibody responses appear to be serotype specific and do not
cross-neutralize alternative AAV serotypes that are commonly used in gene therapy. Thus, AAVCOVID

immunization is unlikely to alter eligibility for a future gene therapy treatment should that ever be
relevant. Lastly, AC1 enables the induction of a potent humoral immune response in mouse models of
obesity and age, which in humans are associated with increased vulnerability to COVID-19 and generally - reduced vaccine efficacy (Cuschieri and Grech, 2020; Karlsson et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2020;
Park et al., 2014). While responses were reduced in 2-year-old mice as compared to younger mice of the
same strain, it remains unclear how these models predict the immunogenicity in older humans, nor have
studies in these models been reported elsewhere for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. Interestingly,
however, AC1 potency was qualitatively distinctly higher in these models compared to that of AC3.
Some logistical attributes of the AAVCOVID vaccines that may initially seem less important biologically
may, in fact, represent some of the more important advantages of this platform. Once the AAVrh32.33
vector has been proven safe in humans, its rapidly re-engineered transgene structure combined with its
adaptation to large scale manufacturing and minimal cold-chain storage requirement are features that
could enable its swift deployment for use in future non-COVID epidemic infections. No novel technology
beyond what exists today in the AAV gene therapy manufacturing sphere is required to produce clinical
grade vaccines in millions of doses. This rapid synthesis and manufacturing deployment in concert with
the thermostability of AAV particles, are attractive for vaccine campaigns launched worldwide, and may
be essential for those required in nations lacking transportation and sophisticated refrigeration
infrastructure.
In summary, AAVCOVID is a preventative vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 capable of inducing
robust immunogenicity in both rodents and primates following a single injection. The safety profile in the
animals studied and the level of immunogenicity compare favorably with the findings reported in studies
of the COVID vaccines that have recently reported human efficacy in clinical trials. AAVCOVID
vaccines are amenable to large scale production, utilizing the extensive know-how and capacity of current
commercial AAV manufacturers. Biophysical properties of the vaccines indicate that a more facile
distribution program can be used with AAVCOVID given the minimal cold-chain infrastructure needed.

Altogether, these data suggest that AAVCOVID is a promising preventative vaccine for SARS-CoV-2
that warrants progression to testing in human populations.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Vaccine candidates:
Two AAV-based vaccine candidates were tested: AAVCOVID19-1 (AC1) and AAVCOVID19-3 (AC3)
(Figure 1A) (plasmid sequences submitted to GenBank, submission ID #2410698). AC1 is an
AAVrh32.33 vector that expresses the codon optimized, pre-fusion stabilized (furin cleavage site mutated
to G682SAS685 and P986P987 substitutions) full length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein under the control of an
SV40 promoter. AC1 carries a short SV40 polyadenylation signal (poly-A). AC3 is an AAVrh32.33 that
carries the secreted S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Spike with the tissue plasminogen activator signal
peptide (tPA-SP) whose expression is driven by the CMV promoter. AC3 has two more regulatory
elements: a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) and the bovine
growth hormone polyadenylation signal (poly-A).
Small-scale production of vaccine candidates:
Research-grade, high-titer vectors were produced, purified, and titrated by the MEEI/ SERI Gene Transfer
Vector Core (https://www.vdb-lab.org/vector- core/). Small-scale vector preparations were generated by
polyethylenimine or PEI (Polysciences, Cat #24765-2) triple transfection of AC1 or AC3 ITR-flanked
transgene, pKan2/rh32.33 (AAV2 rep and AAVrh32.33 capsid construct), and pALD-X80 adenoviral
helper plasmid in a 1:1:2 ratio, respectively, in HEK293 cells. DNA was transfected in 10-layer
HYPERFlasks using a PEI-Max/DNA ratio of 1.375:1 (v/w). 3 days after transfection, vectors were
harvested from the HYPERFlasks using Benzonase (EMD Millipore, catalog no. 1016970010) to degrade
DNA/RNA. 24 hours after harvesting, the vectors were concentrated by tangential flow filtration and
purified by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described (Lock et al., 2010). Vaccine
candidates were quantified by ddPCR according to a previously published protocol (Sanmiguel et al.,
2019). Capsid stability was assessed by AAV-ID (Pacouret et al., 2017).

Large-scale manufacturing of vaccine candidates:
AAVCOVID candidates were produced at larger scale via standard AAV production processes by
Novartis Gene Therapies, following their stablished protocol with only minimal modifications to adjust to
the AAVrh32.33 technology. Briefly, AC1 and AC3 were produced via three plasmid transfection (AC1
or AC3 ITR-flanked transgene, pKan2/rh32.33 (AAV2 rep and AAVrh32.33 capsid construct), and
pALD-X80 adenoviral helper plasmid) in an iCellis500 bioreactor (Pall Biosciences). Following cell lysis
and lysate clarification, tangential flow filtration (TFF) was conducted to achieve volume reduction. The
TFF retentate was next enriched for AAV particles on a cation exchange chromatography column (BIA
Separations, Sartorius). The eluate was concentrated, and buffer exchanged through an additional TFF
step, before CsCl ultracentrifugation to separate genome containing versus empty AAV particles. Finally,
formulation (buffer: 20 mM tris (pH 8.1 ± 0.1), 1 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl2), 200 mM sodium
chloride (NaCl) and 0.005% poloxamer 188) was achieved through TFF before bulk drug substance was
filtered.
TaqMan Assay Design for SARS-CoV-2 Spike detection:
The codon optimized SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of AAVCOVID vaccine candidates
was used as a target for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)/real-time PCR (qPCR) quantifications. The
sequence was checked for secondary structures using the mfold application of the UNAfold software
package (Zuker, 2003) at the PCR annealing temperature and TaqMan buffer salt concentrations.Internal
repeats were avoided by maping against the entire codon optimized SARS-CoV-2 S gene of AAVCOVID
candidates using the REPuter application (Kurtz et al., 2001). The 5’-end of the gene was selected as PCR
target based on these analyses. The oligo sequences used were the following: forward primer,
GTGCAGCCAACCGAG (0.43M final concentration); reverse primer, ACACCTCGCCAAATGG
(1.125M final concentration), and TaqMan probe 6FAM- TCTATCGTGCGCTTTC-MGBNFQ

(0.25M final concentration). The final concentration and Tm’s of primers were determined using the
DINAMelt application of the UNAfold software package (Markham and Zuker, 2005, 2008) and set to
hybridize the target with a Tm of just under 60C (59.0-59.9C) for high specificity. The PrimerExpress
software (Applied Biosystems) was used to determine the Tm of the MGB probe (Kutyavin et al.,
2000). The resulting 67 bp amplicon was inspected for specificity via NCBI BLAST using the
somewhat similar algorithm in the suite against human, NHP, mouse, ferret, and betacoronavirus
databases and determined to be highly specific for our vaccine candidates. No significant matches were
found against the RBD oligonucleotides used.
In vitro expression studies:
105 HEK293 cell/well were seeded in 12-well plates (Corning, MA, USA) plates and incubated at 37°C
overnight. The following day, cells were transfected with 2 µg of AAVCOVID19-1 (pAC1) and
AAVCOVID19-3 (pAC3) plasmids using PEI-Max. Cells were harvested 24 and 72 hours after
transfection for mRNA and western blot (WB) expression analyses, respectively. In addition, 5x104 HuH7
cell/well were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. On the following day,
adenovirus 5 WT (Ad5) was added to the cells at a MOI of 20 pfu/cell. 2 hours later, media was removed
and cells infected with a MOI of 5x105 of AC1 or AC3. Cells were harvested 72 hours later for WB
analysis.
Transfection and transduction samples were also collected for RNA gene expression analyses. Total RNA
was extracted via Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified using a Qubit fluorometer
(Invitrogen). 7.5µg of Total RNA was DNase-I treated using the Turbo DNA-free kit (Invitrogen).
About 1.4µg of DNase-treated total RNA was set aside for reverse transcription against (-)RT controls
using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher). Codon optimized RBD gene
expression was assessed against a cells only control using qPCR and normalized to human 18S rRNA
gene levels by the delta delta Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).

Detection of Spike antigens by Western Blot (WB):
Cell lysates were obtained by diluting cell pellets in NuPAGE™ LDS Sample Buffer (4X) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Cat# NP0007) and incubating at 99°C for 5 minutes,, separated by electrophoresis in
NuPAGE 4-12% polyacrylamide gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#NP0321PK2) and then transferred
to PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD rabbit polyclonal
antibody (Sino Biological Inc., 40592-T62) followed by a goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# A16110, RRID AB_2534782). Membranes were developed by
chemiluminescence using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Cat#
WBKLS0500) and recorded using ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). An anti-GAPDH antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 2118, RRID:AB_561053) was used as loading control.
Mouse studies:
All the mouse studies were performed in compliance with the Schepens Eye Research Institute IACUC.
BALB/c, C57BL/6 or C57BL/6 diet-induced obese (DIO) animals were intramuscularly (right
gastrocnemius muscle) treated at 1010 gc/mouse or 1011 gc/mouse. Animals were kept in standard diet and
C57BL/6 DIO were fed a high-fat diet (Research Diets, Cat#D12492i). Serum samples were obtained by
submandibular bleeds for humoral immune response analyses. At necropsy, several tissues were collected
for analysis of vector presence and transgene expression.
NHP study:
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that screened negative for viral
pathogens including SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), STLV (simian-T- lymphotrophic virus), SRV
(simian retrovirus), and B virus (macacine herpesvirus 1) were enrolled on the study. Animals were
housed in an AAALAC International-accredited nonhuman primate research in stainless-steel squeeze

back cages, on a 12-hour timed light/dark cycle, at temperatures ranging from 64-79°F (18-26°C).
Animals received varied enrichment such as food treats, visual and auditory stimuli, manipulatives, and
social interactions throughout the study. Four 3 to 7 year-old Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were
treated with the clinical candidates (n=2/vector, 1 female and 1 male) intramuscularly at a dose of 1012
gc/animal. Serum and PBMC samples were obtained in regular intervals for several analyses of
immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike and AAVrh32.33. Serum chemistry, hematology, and
coagulation analyses were performed by Antech Diagnostics. Serum was also collected for cytokine
analyses which were performed by the University of Pennsylvania’s Human Immunology Core using a
Non-Human Primate Cytokine Panel kit (MilliporeSigma, Cat# PCYTMG-40K-PX23) on a Bio-Plex 200
instrument (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Human samples:
Blood was collected from 60 patients with nasopharyngeal PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
stratified by disease severity. Plasma was separated and stored at negative 80°C until assessed. Human
subject investigation was approved by the institutional Review Board of the Massachusetts General
Hospital.
SARS-CoV-2 Spike-binding antibody detection ELISA:
Nunc MaxiSorpTM high protein-binding capacity 96 well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 44-240421) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1µg/ml SARS-CoV-2 RBD, SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain
(LakePharma, Cat# 46328) or SARS-CoV-1 RBD diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The next
day the plates were washed with PBS-Tween 20 0.05% (Sigma, Cat# P2287-100ML) using the Biotek
405 TS Microplate washer. Each plate was washed five times with 200 µl wash buffer and then dried
before the next step. Following the first wash, 200 µl of Blocker Casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Cat# 37528) were added to each well and incubated for 2 hours at RT. After blocking, serum
samples were serially diluted in blocking solution starting into 1:100 dilution. After an hour of incubation,

the plates were washed and 100 µl of secondary Peroxidase AffiniPure Rabbit Anti-Mouse IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, Cat# 315-035-045, RRID: AB_2340066) antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution
or rabbit Anti-Monkey IgG (whole molecule)-Peroxidase antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A2054,
RRID:AB_257967) were added to each well. After one hour of incubation at room temperature, the plates
were washed and developed for 3.5 min with 100 µl of Seracare SureBlue ReserveTM TMB Microwell
Peroxidase Substrate solution (SeraCare, Cat# 53-00-03). The reaction was then stopped with 100 µl
Seracare KPL TMB Stop Solution (SeraCare, Cat# 50-85-06). Optical density (OD) at 450 nm was
measured using a Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader. The titer was the reciprocal of the highest dilution with
absorbance values higher than four times the average of the negative control wells. For mouse serum
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody isotyping, the same ELISA was performed but using the secondary
antibodies from SBA Clonotyping System-HRP kit (SouthernBiotech, 5300-05, RRID:AB_2796080)
diluted accordingly to manufacturer’s instructions.
For NHP isotyping ELISA, plates were coated overnight at 4°C with 20ng/well of SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein ectodomain (LakePharma, Cat# 46328) as the capture antigen. Then, the wells were blocked with
5% milk in PBS-Tween 20 0.05% for 2h and incubated for additional 2h with 50 μl serially diluted serum
samples. Then, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody against rhesus IgG1 (NIH
Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource supported by AI126683 and OD 010976 Cat# PR-7110,
RRID:AB_2819310) and IgG4 (NIH Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource supported by AI126683 and
OD 010976 Cat# PR-7180, RRID:AB_2819322) for 1 h. After every incubation step, the plates were
washed three times with PBS-Tween 20 0.05%. After color development, OD at 450nm was determined
using Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader. The titer was the reciprocal of the highest dilution with absorbance
values higher than four times the average of the negative control wells.
Lenti-SARS2 pseudovirus production and titration:
Lenti-SARS2 was produced based on a published protocol (Crawford et al., 2020). Specifically, 50%
confluent HEK293T cells were seeded 24 hours prior to transfection in 15 cm plates. The next day, 18µg

of psPAX2, 9µg of pCMV-SARS2-RRAR_ILR_gp41 and 29µg of pCMV-Lenti-Luc plasmids were
mixed in 3.6mL of Opti-MEM™ I Reduced Serum media (Gibco, Cat# 31985070) along with 144 µL of
PEI Max 40K (1 mg/mL, pH: 6.9-7.1) and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was incubated for 20 minutes
at room temperature. Media on cells was aspirated and serum-free DMEM was added to the cells. After
20 mins, the DNA-PEI mixture was added dropwise to the plate and incubated overnight at 37°C with 5%
CO2. The next day, media was replaced with DMEM with 10% FBS. After 48 hours, the media was
collected in a 50 mL conical and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm at 4°C for 5 minutes to remove cell debris. The
supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.45 µm filter, aliquoted and stored at -80°C.
For titration of the pseudovirus, HEK293T cells expressing ACE2 were seeded at 1.5x104 cells/well in
poly-L-Lysine (0.01%) coated 96-well black plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 3904) one day before
titration. On the next day, the media was changed to 50 µL DMEM+10%FBS containing filtered
Hexadimethrine bromide at a final concentration of 10 µg/mL. 2-fold serial dilutions (up-to 15 dilutions)
of the viral stocks (50µL) were added to the plate in 6 replicates each and incubated for 48 hours. After 48
hours, cells were lysed with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Cat# E4030). These plates were frozen at 80°C for 60 minutes. Thereafter, they were thawed at 37°C for 20 mins before starting the luciferase
readout. For luciferase substrate buffer the following reagents were mixed; Tris-HCl buffer at 0.5 M, ATP
at 0.3 mM, MgCl2 at 10 mM, Pierce™ Firefly Signal Enhancer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#16180),
D-luciferin 150µg/mL (PerkinElmer, Cat# 122799). Biotek Synergy H1 Plate reader was used for
luminescence readout. For pseudovirus neutralization assay, a final dilution of the virus stock targeting
relative luminescence units (RLU) of 1800-1100 was used which was approximately 200-fold higher than
background signal obtained in untreated cells.
Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay:
HEK293T cells expressing ACE2 were seeded at 1.5x104 cells/well in poly-L-Lysine (0.01%) coated 96well black plates. The following day, 50µL of DMEM+10% FBS media containing Hexadimethrine
bromide (final concentration 10 µg/mL) was added to the cells. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at

56°C for 1 hour. Serum samples were then serially diluted (2-fold) for 10 dilutions in DMEM with 10%
FBS with initial dilution of 1:40 for mouse serum and 1:10 dilution for NHP serum. Thereafter, LentiSARS2 pseudovirus was added to each dilution and incubated at 37°C for 45 minuntes. The serum and
virus mixture was added to the cells and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 hours. An anti-SARSCoV-2 Spike monoclonal neutralizing antibody (GenScript, Cat# 6D11F2) was used as a positive control.
Cells without serum and virus were used as negative control. After 48 hours, cells were lysed and
luciferase measured as described above. Neutralizing antibody titers or 50% inhibitory concentration in
the serum sample (EC50 or ID50) were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing less
RLU signal than half of the average RLU (maximum infectivity) of Virus Control group (cells + virus,
without serum).
Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) of SARS-CoV-2
Depending on the volume available, mouse or NHP sera were serially diluted two-fold from an initial
dilution of either 1:12.5 or 1:25 for ten dilutions in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS,
Gibco). Each dilution was incubated at 37℃ and 5% CO2 for 1 hour with an equal volume of 1000
plaque forming units/ml (PFU/ml) of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA‐WA1/2020) diluted in DMEM (Gibco)
containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco). Controls included DMEM
containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco) only as a negative control,
1000 PFU/ml SARS-CoV-2 incubated with DPBS, and 1000 PFU/ml SARS-CoV-2 incubated with
DMEM. Two hundred microliters of each dilution or control were added to confluent monolayers of NR‐
596 Vero E6 cells in triplicate and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and 5% CO2. The plates were gently
rocked every 5-10 minutes to prevent monolayer drying. The monolayers were then overlaid with a 1:1
mixture of 2.5% Avicel® RC‐591 microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium (DuPont
Nutrition & Biosciences) and 2X Modified Eagle Medium (Temin’s modification, Gibco) supplemented
with 2X antibiotic‐antimycotic (Gibco), 2X GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco).
Plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 2 days. The monolayers were fixed with 10% neutral

buffered formalin and stained with 0.2% aqueous Gentian Violet (RICCA Chemicals) in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 30 minutes, followed by rinsing and plaque counting. The half maximal inhibitory
concentrations (EC50 or ID50) were calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.
IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISPOT assay and cytokine secretion in murine splenocytes:
Splenocytes were obtained by grinding murine spleens with 100 μm cell strainers, followed by treatment
with Ammonium Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysis buffer (Gibco) to lyse the red blood cells. The isolated
cells were then suspended in complete RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and
counted for the following experiments.
IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISPOT for mice was measured as previously described (Wang et al., 2019). Briefly,
96-well PVDF plates (Millipore) were pre-coated with 10 μg/ml anti-mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT capture
antibody (BD Biosciences Cat# 551881, RRID:AB_2868948) or 4 μg/ml anti-mouse IL-4 ELISPOT
capture antibody (BD Biosciences Cat# 551878, RRID:AB_2336921) at 4°C overnight, and then blocked
with complete RPMI-1640 medium for 3 hours at 37°C. One million of freshly isolated splenocytes were
seeded into the precoated plates and stimulated with S1 and S2 peptides pools (GenScript) with a final
concentration of 1 μg/ml of each peptide diluted in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and
incubated for 48 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. Each peptide pool, consisting of 15-mers peptides
overlapping by 10 amino acids, spanning the entire SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein S1 or S2 subunits.
Control wells contained 5x105 cell stimulated with DMSO diluted in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10%
FBS (negative control) or 2 μg/ml concanavalin A (positive control). Subsequently, the plates were
washed and incubated with biotin-conjugated mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT Detection Antibody (BD
Biosciences Cat# 551881, RRID:AB_2868948) and 4 μg/ml biotin-conjugated mouse IL4 detection
antibody (BD Biosciences Cat# 551878, RRID:AB_2336921) at room temperature for 3 hours and
followed by streptavidin-HRP (dilution 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 18-152) for 45 minutes. After
washing, 100 μL/well of NBT/BCIP substrate solution (Promega, Cat# S3771) were added and developed

for 15–30 min until distinct spots emerged. The cytokine-secreting cell spots were imaged and counted on
AID EliSpot reader (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH).
2x106 freshly isolated splenocytes were seeded into 96-well plates and stimulated with 1 µg/ml of
peptides from S1 and S2 pool as described previously at 37 °C for 48 hours. Then the supernatants were
collected and cytokine levels were measured by a Luminex cytokine assay by SBH Sciences.
Detection of circulating S1 in NHP sera by Sandwich ELISA:
A monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD capture antibody (GenScript, Cat# 5B7D7) was coated on Nunc
Maxisorp ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 44-2404-21) at 2.5 µg/mL final concentration in
Sodium Bicarbonate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# SRE0034). The plate was incubated at 4°C overnight.
All washes were performed 5X with PBS-Tween-20 0.05%. On the following day, plates were washed
and blocked for 2 hours with Casein Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 37528). Then, NHP sera were
added in duplicates at 1:5 dilution in blocking buffer. A blank consisting of the blocking buffer and a
standard curve ranging from 5000 pg/mL to 78.25 pg/mL of S1 antigen (GenScript, Cat# Z03501) in
blocking buffer were also added in duplicates on the plate followed by incubation at room temperature for
1 hour. Then, biotinylated detection antibody (GenScript, Cat# 5E10G8-Biotin) was added at 1 µg/mL
final concentration in blocking buffer and plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Finally,
1:5000 final dilution of Streptavidin-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 18-152) was added to the plate. After
completing incubation of 1 hour at room temperature, the plate was washed. 100 µL of TMB substrate
(SeraCare, Cat# 5120-0081) was added to plates and color was developed for 3 mins 30 secs, after which
100 µL of Stop Solution (SeraCare, Cat# 5150-0021) was added to stop the reaction and plates were read
at 450 nm and 670 nm using Biotek Synergy H1 hybrid plate reader. Absorbance at 670 nm was
subtracted from 450 nm, and then corrected with absorbance of the blank. Linear regression was used to
calculate the standard curve formula and S1 concentration (pg/mL) was calculated by extrapolation.

Peripheral blood T cell responses against AC1, AC3 and the AAVrh32.33 capsid were measured by
interferon gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays according to previously
published methods (Calcedo et al., 2018). Peptide libraries specific for AAVrh32.33 capsid as well as the
AC1 and AC3 transgenes were generated (15-mers with a 10 amino acid overlap with the preceding
peptide; Mimotopes, Australia). More specifically, the AAVrh32.33 capsid peptide library was divided
into three peptide pools, A, B and C. Pool A contained peptides 1-50, Pool B peptides 51-100 and Pool C
peptides 101-145. For the AC1 and AC3 peptide libraries, peptides specific to each protein were pooled
separately from those peptide sequences shared between the two proteins. The AC1 peptide library
contained Pool A (peptides 1-2, 136-173); Pool B (peptides 174-213); and Pool C (peptides 214-253).
The AC3 Peptide Library consisted of Pool A only (peptides 254-257). The AC1 & AC3 Shared Peptides
also contained three peptide pools; Pool A (peptides 258-259; 3-44), Pool B (peptides 45-90) and Pool C
(peptides 91-135). Peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 100
mg/mL, pooled, aliquoted and stored at -80°C. They were used at a final concentration in the assay of
approximately 2 µg/mL. The positive response criteria for the IFN-γ ELISPOT was greater than 55 spot
forming units (SFU) per million cells and at least three times greater than the negative control values.
PBMC stimulation, flow cytometry and gating strategy:
Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were thawed and rested overnight in sterile
R10 media (RPMI 1640, Corning), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products),
Penicillin/Streptomycin and L-Glutamine; plus 10 U/mL DNAse I (Roche Life Sciences) at 37°C, 5%
CO2 and 95% humidity incubation conditions. PBMC were stimulated at 200 ul final volume in sterile
R10 media. Peptide concentrations for stimulation conditions were 2 µg/ml for AC1/AC3 shared peptide
pool A, B and C and AAVrh32.22 peptide pool A, B and C. Co-stimulation was added with peptides:
1μg/mL anti-CD49d (Clone 9F10, BioLegend Cat# 304301, RRID:AB_314427) and CD28-ECD (Clone
CD28.2, Beckman Coulter Cat# 6607111, RRID:AB_1575955) at the start of stimulation. Positive control
samples were stimulated using Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB, List Biological Laboratories) at

1μg/mL. CD107a BV650 (clone H4A3, BioLegend Cat# 328643, RRID:AB_2565967) was added at the
start of stimulation. Brefeldin A (1μg /mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) and monensin (0.66μL/mL) (BD
Biosciences) were added one hour after initiation of stimulation. Cells were incubated under stimulation
conditions for a total of 9 hours.
All following incubations were performed at room temperature. Cells were stained for viability exclusion
using Live/Dead Fixable Aqua for 10 minutes, followed by a 20-minute incubation with a panel of
directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies diluted in equal parts of fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) buffer (PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and 1% bovine serum albumin) and Brilliant stain
buffer (BD Biosciences). Fluorophore-conjugated recombinant RBD protein produced by the Hensley
Lab (University of Pennsylvania) was used to identify RBD-binding B cells during the surface antibody
stain. Cells were washed in FACS buffer and fixed/permeabilized using the FoxP3 Transcription Factor
Buffer Kit (eBioscience), following manufacturer’s instructions. Intracellular staining was performed by
adding the antibody cocktail prepared in 1X permwash buffer for 1 hour. Stained cells were washed and
fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at 4°C in the dark until
acquisition. All flow cytometry data were collected on a BD LSR II or BD FACSymphony A5 cytometer
(BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (versions 9.9.6 and 10.6.2, Tree Star).
The following antibodies were used: PD1 BV421 (clone EH12.2H7, BioLegend Cat# 329919,
RRID:AB_10900818), CD14 BV510 (clone M5E2, BioLegend Cat# 301842, RRID:AB_2561946) and

First, to ensure that only live single cells were analyzed from PBMCs, forward scatter height (FSC-H)versus-forward scatter area (FSC-A) and side scatter area (SSC-A)-versus-FSC-A plots were used to
exclude doublets and focus on singlet small lymphocytes. Dead cells were excluded by gating on cells
negative for the viability marker Aqua Blue. For T cell function analysis, monocytes, B cells and NK cells
were excluded via the CD14/19/16 dump gate. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were gated within CD3+
cells. To determine the memory phenotype, CD28 versus CD95 were used, and naïve T cells were
excluded from the analysis.
For B cell analysis, B cells were identified as CD20+ and CD3/CD14/CD16-. Memory B cells were
defined as CD27+ or CD27-IgD-.
AAV Neutralizing Antibody (NAb) Assay:

NAb responses against AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh32.33 capsids were measured in
serum using an in vitro HEK293 cell-based assay and LacZ expressing vectors (Vector Core Laboratory,
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) as previously described (Calcedo et al., 2018). The NAb
titer values are reported as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which AAV transduction is
reduced 50% compared to the negative control. The limit of detection of the assay was a 1:5 serum
dilution.
Biodistribution/Gene Expression Studies:
Tissue collection was segregated for genomic DNA (gDNA) or total RNA work by QIASymphony
nucleic acid extraction with the aim of filling up 96-well plates of purified material. A small cut of frozen
tissue (~ 20 mg) was used for all extractions with the exception of gDNA purifications from spleen (1-2
mg). Tissues were disrupted and homogenized in QIAGEN Buffer ATL (180 L) and lysed overnight at
56C in the presence of QIAGEN Proteinase K (400 g) for gDNA, or directly in QIAGEN Buffer
RLT-Plus in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and a QIAGEN anti-foaming agent for total RNA
purification. Tissue lysates for gDNA extraction were treated in advance with QIAGEN RNase A (400
µg), while tissue homogenates for RNA extraction were DNase-I treated in situ in the QIASymphony
during the procedure. Nucleic acids were quantified only if necessary, as a troubleshooting measure.
Purified gDNA samples were diluted 10-fold and in parallel into Cutsmart -buffered BamHI-HF (New
England Biolabs) restriction digestions in the presence of 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (50L final volume) that
ran overnight prior to quantification. Similarly, DNase-I-treated total RNAs were diluted 10-fold into
cDNA synthesis reactions (20 L final volume) with or without reverse transcriptase using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher). For ddPCR (gDNA or cDNA) or qPCR
(cDNA), 2 L of processed nucleic acids were used for quantification using Bio-Rad or Applied
Biosystems reagents, respectively, in 20 L reactions using default amplification parameters without an
UNG incubation step. All the studies included negative control (PBS) groups for comparison. The

significantly small variance of multiple technical replicates in ddPCR justified the use of a single
technical replicate per sample and no less than three biological replicates per group, gender, or time point.
coRBD signal for ddPCR and vector biodistribution (gDNA) was multiplexed and normalized against the
mouse transferrin receptor (Tfrc) gene TaqMan assay using a commercial preparation validated for
copy number variation analysis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Likewise, coRBD signal for ddPCR and gene
expression analysis was multiplexed and normalized against the mouse GAPDH gene, also using a
commercial preparation of the reference assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Target and reference
oligonucleotide probes are tagged with different fluorophores at the 5’-end which allows efficient signal
stratification. For qPCR, coRBD and mGAPDH TaqMan assays were run separately to minimize
competitive PCR multiplexing issues prior to analysis and delta delta Ct normalization (Livak and
Schmittgen, 2001). The limit of detection of the assay was 10 copies/reaction, therefore, wells with less
than 10 copies were considered negative.
Phylogenetic Analysis:
First, fourteen representative AAV capsid sequences were aligned by Clustal Omega (Sievers and
Higgins, 2018). Substitution models and model parameters were statistically compared (120 in total)
through ProtTest3 (Darriba et al., 2011; Guindon and Gascuel, 2003), and the Le, Gascuel Model (Le and
Gascuel, 2008) was selected based on the Aikake Information Criterion (AIC). Additionally, amino acid
frequencies were determined empirically through the alignment (+F parameter) and evolutionary rates
among sites were allowed to vary within five categories by modeling variability with a discrete Gamma
distribution (+G parameter), again selected through AIC. A maximum-likelihood approach was then used
to infer the evolutionary relationships among the included sequences using MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018)
and the resultant phylogeny rooted along the midpoint of the branch between AAV4 and AAV5 for
purposes of visualization. A sequence identity matrix was computed, and the resultant table was used to
annotate the phylogeny by percent identity.

GraphPad Prism 8 was used for graph preparation and statistical analysis. Data were represented as mean
± standard deviation (SD). Groups were compared between them by One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests
in studies with more than two groups and n≥10, and Kruskal Wallis and Dunn’s testes were used if n<10.
Two groups were compared between them using Student’s t test (if n≥10) or Mann Whitney’s U (if
n<10). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated to assess correlation.
