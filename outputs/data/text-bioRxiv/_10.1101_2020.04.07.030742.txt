ABSTRACT (239 words):

In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV, the
agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for
viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.
Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also
function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.
To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the
respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515
healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120
distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects,
immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human
lung samples.
We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples
and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell
populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in
the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the
presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm
broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.
Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2
expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that
alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.

INTRODUCTION:
In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak caused by the SARS
coronavirus (CoV) resulted in 8096 probable cases with 774 confirmed deaths[1, 2] In patients
with SARS, deaths were attributed to acute respiratory distress associated with diffuse bilateral
pneumonia and alveolar damage[3]. In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing the
COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is spreading at a much more rapid rate than SARS-CoV [4–
6]. Similar clinical reports of diffuse bilateral pneumonia and alveolar damage have been
reported[7–9]. Severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with infections of the lower
respiratory tract with detection of the virus throughout this tissue as well as the upper respiratory
tract[7–9]. The biological mechanisms that may govern differences in the number of SARS and
COVID-19 cases remain undefined. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 possesses distinct
molecular mechanisms that impact the virulence through viral proteins, greater susceptibility of
host cells to infection, permissivity of host cells to virus replication, or some combination of
these and other potentially unknown factors[10–13]. Understanding SARS and SARS-CoV-2
virus similarities and differences at the molecular level in the host may provide insights into
transmission, pathogenesis, and interventions.
The seminal report identifying the receptor for SARS-CoV used a HEK293 cell overexpression system to identify angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor by coimmunoprecipitation with SARS-CoV spike domain 1[14]. Subsequently, spike protein of SARSCoV was identified as the viral interacting partner of ACE2. Host protease activity by TMPRSS2
facilitates ACE2 ectodomain cleavage and fusion of SARS-CoV membrane with host cell
membrane[15–17]. ADAM17 has also been demonstrated to cleave ACE2 ectodomain, but this
was not required for SARS CoV infection[18–20]. Mechanisms of SARS CoV entry distinct from
ACE2 have also been reported and include activation by endosomal cathepsin L and cell
surface expression of CD147 or GRP78[21–23] Each of these receptors were mechanistically
interrogated and suggest that SARS CoV could initiate host cell entry and infection using

multiple mechanisms. Recent in vitro reports have demonstrated that similar host proteins are
involved in facilitating cell entry by SARS-CoV-2, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2[5, 24]
Biophysical and structural evidence strongly support an interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2
spike protein, similar to SARS-CoV spike protein[12, 13]. Molecular docking studies have also
suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can interact with cell-surface GRP78[25]. Indirect
evidence for a role of CD147 in SARS-CoV-2 binding has been demonstrated in vitro with the
use of an anti-CD147 intervention that prevented virus replication[26]. Furthermore, a clinical
study with an anti-CD147 intervention reduced symptoms and duration of hospital admission for
COVID-19 patients[27]. In summary, although there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV both utilize ACE2 as a receptor to facilitate virus entry, it is possible that differences in
host-entry mechanisms play a role in the large epidemiological differences between the two
viruses, which may include additional unidentified receptors.
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were identified as cellular entry determinants for SARS-CoV using
mechanistic studies. The original report of in situ human lung ACE2 expression described
positive immunohistochemical staining for alveoli and airway epithelial cells, and
immunocytochemical staining in A549 type II alveolar epithelial cells[28]. ACE2 protein
expression is also present in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3[29]. Similar to
ACE2, the original report describing the expression of TMPRSS2 in human respiratory mucosa
described expression in airway epithelium and type II alveolar epithelial cells[30]. The specificity
of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 antibodies used for analysis of expression patterns in human lung
tissues remains to be addressed.
To address the uncertainties related to SARS-CoV-2 receptors in human lung, we
performed gene expression and in situ protein profiling of candidate receptors in human airway
epithelial cells and lung tissue. Our computational analysis used publicly available microarray
gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 unique subjects, single cell
sequencing data from 10 subjects, and the FANTOM5 dataset for promoter activities of 74 lung-

related cell and tissue types. For our in situ protein profiling, we performed
immunohistochemical analysis of 98 human lung tissue samples. To determine antibody
specificity, we performed immunoblots on protein isolated from Calu-3 cells, primary human
airway epithelial cells, primary type II alveolar epithelial cells, the human bronchial epithelium
cell (HBEC)-6KT cell line, the A549 type II alveolar epithelial cell line, and HEK cells.
Collectively our data contrast previous reports, demonstrating rare ACE2 protein expression in
the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. Our protein expression data are consistent with
low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene
expression in both microarray and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. We
present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in
vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the
respiratory mucosa. Our data suggest that the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating
ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or that
alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection in lung tissue.

METHODS:
Human ethics: Procurement of primary human airway epithelial cells used for immunoblots and
lung tissue for immunohistochemistry was approved by Hamilton integrated Research Ethics
Board (HiREB 5099T, 5305T, 11-3559 and 13-523-C). UBC Research Ethics Office approved
heart tissue archives and primary human airway epithelial cell collection.
Upper and lower airway gene expression analysis: Public microarray experiments using
Affymetrix chips (HuGene-1.0-st-v1 and HG-U133 Plus 2) on airway epithelial cell samples
collected from nasal (GSE19190) or bronchial (GSE11906) brushings of healthy, non-smokers
were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [31, 32]. This
resulted in a total of 80 individual samples from the two different experiments which includes 11
upper airway samples (Nasal: 11) and 69 lower airway samples (Trachea: 17, Large Airway: 17,
Small Airway: 35). For all dataset samples, raw intensity values and annotation data were
downloaded using the GEOquery R package (version 2.52.0)[33] from the Bioconductor project
[34]. Probe definition files were downloaded from Bioconductor and probes were annotated
using Bioconductor’s annotate package. All gene expression data were unified into a single
dataset that was then RMA-normalized, and only genes present in both of the Affymetrix
platforms (N = 16,013) were kept for subsequent analyses. Correction of experiment-specific
batch effects was performed using the ComBat method[35] implemented using the sva R
package (version 3.32.1)[36]. RMA-normalized expression levels for conventional (ACE2,
TMPRSS2, ADAM17, and CTSL) and non-conventional (CD147, and GRP78) SARS-CoV-2
receptor genes were compared across the four defined airway levels, with CDH1 expression
level included as a positive control with known expression in lung tissue. Gene expression
levels were tested for significant differences via pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests with
Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction using the stats R package (version 3.6.1). Gene
expression box plots were generated with the ggplot2 R package (version 3.2.1).

Analysis of Curated Bronchial Epithelial Cell Brushing Dataset:
A total of 1,859 public microarray experiments using Affymetrix chips (HG-U133 Plus 2 and
HuGene-1.0-st-v1) on airway epithelial cell samples were selected from the NCBI GEO
database. These samples were further filtered by removing individuals with asthma or COPD,
resulting in a total of 504 individual healthy samples (GSE4302, 28 samples; GSE67472, 43
samples; GSE37147, 159 samples; GSE108134, 274 samples). Within this dataset, sex and
age information was included for 310 samples with 86 females/106 males.
For all dataset samples, raw intensity values and annotation data were downloaded as
described above. Probe definition files were retrieved as described above. All gene expression
data were unified into a single dataset that was then RMA-normalized, and only genes present
in both of the Affymetrix platforms (N = 16,105) were kept for subsequent analyses. Correction
of experiment-specific batch effects was performed as described above.
Analysis of promoter activity from the FANTOM5 dataset: The FANTOM5 promoterome
dataset[37] for the hg38 assembly[38] was used to examine promoter activity of SARS-CoV-2related human genes, namely ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, CTSL (cathepsin L1), CD147 and
GRP78. Using the ZENBU genome browser[39], the nearest cap analysis of gene expression
(CAGE) peak upstream and on the same strand as each of the aforementioned genes was
extracted and analyzed. The dataset consists of CAGE promoter activity data for 1,886 primary
cells, cell lines, and tissues from humans, and quantified as normalized transcripts per million
(TPM). A subset of FANTOM5 CAGE data (120 samples) is presented considering only
samples related to lung, gut, heart, and prostate tissues (consisting of 74, 19, 15, and 12
samples, respectively). Normalized TPM values for each CAGE peak, an approximation for
promoter activity, were log10 transformed and separated according to tissue and cell type, and
the radius of each point is proportional to these transformed normalized TPM values.

Analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data: Data preprocessed using the Cell
Ranger pipeline (10x Genomics) were obtained from GSE135893. Samples from 10 control
subjects and 12 IPF patients were downloaded and post-processed with Seurat package in
R[40]. Cell populations were defined using the markers provided in the source paper[41]. Cells
belonging to the 10 control subjects were used for further analysis. Visualizations of violin plots
were created using Seurat.
Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cells: The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3, was
grown under culture conditions defined by the supplier (ATCC-HTB-55). Primary human airway
epithelial cells isolated via bronchial brushings from consented healthy individuals were grown
in PneumaCult ExPlus (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver Canada) under submerged
monolayer culture conditions and used in between passage 1 and 4. The human bronchial
epithelial cell line, HBEC-6KT, was grown under submerged monolayer culture conditions in
keratinocyte serum free media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (0.4ng/ml) and
bovine pituitary extract (50μg/ml)[42–45].
Immunoblots: Cell protein was isolated using RIPA lysis buffer (VWR, Ontario, Canada)
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, Ontario, Canada) with quantification
performed using Bradford assay reagents (Bio Rad, Ontario, Canada). Immunoblots were
performed using stain free 4-20% pre-cast gradient gels and imaged on a ChemiDoc XRS+
Imaging system (Bio Rad, Ontario, Canada). For each immunoblot, 20μg of protein was added
per lane. ACE2 (R&D Systems - MAB933 – Monoclonal - Clone 171606 – 2μg/ml), TMPRSS2
(Atlas Antibodies - HPA035787 – Polyclonal – 0.4μg/ml), CD147 (Abcam – ab666 – Monoclonal

0.25μg/ml) primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk/Tris buffered saline with 0.1%
Tween-20 and incubated overnight on a rocker at 4°C with detection performed the following
day using an anti-mouse-HRP (ACE2, CD147, GRP78) or anti-rabbit-HRP (TMPRSS2)

Danvers, MA, USA). Visualization of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 was performed using was
performed using Clarity™ Western enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Substrate, while ACE2
was visualized with Clarity Max™ ECL Substrate (Bio Rad, Ontario Canada). Total protein
loading images were collected as a confirmation of equal protein loading between sample
types[46]. The immunogen for ACE2 primary antibody is mouse myeloma cell line NS0-derived
recombinant human ACE2 Gln18-Ser740 (predicted). The immunogen for TMPRSS2 primary
antibody is the recombinant protein epitope signature tag antigen sequence,

antibody is human BiP/GRP78 amino acids 525-628.
Independent immunoblot analysis (L.O, C.J. A.J. and G.J) were performed on A549,
HEK, and immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells. Equal amounts of protein (20µg) were
loaded on to 4-12%, Bis-Tris gradient gels (ThermoFisher, NP0326BOX) with anti-ACE2
(Abcam – ab108252 – Rabbit monoclonal – Clone EPR4435(2) – 1/500 dilution of stock
antibody). A loading control of GAPDH was used to demonstrate protein loading (Abcam –

was performed with ECL Clarity (Biorad, UK) on a Licor C-DiGit.
Immunohistochemistry: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human lung tissue from non-diseased
regions were obtained from archived tissue blocks from patients who had undergone lung
resection for clinical care. Human heart tissue was from the UBC Cardiovascular Tissue
Registry. Four-micron thick sections were cut and stained for ACE2 (15μg/ml), TMPRSS2

RESULTS:
Candidate genes important in SARS-CoV-2 infection are detectable at varying levels in
human airway epithelial cells and lung tissue
We performed a targeted analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2, ADAM17, CTSL, CD147, and GRP78
gene expression as candidates important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human airway epithelial
cells. Here and throughout gene expression analyses, CDH1 (E-cadherin) was used as a
control for lung epithelial cell phenotype. We first examined these genes in a curated dataset of
upper and lower airway epithelial cell gene expression from the nasal sinus to the 12th
generation of airway in the lung (Figure 1A).
In the upper airways, all candidates were expressed with the highest levels observed for
GRP78 and the lowest level observed for ACE2. Analysis along multiple generations of the
lower airways (trachea, large (4-6th generation), and small airways (10-12th generation) revealed
identical relative expression patterns with ACE2 being the least expressed and GRP78 being
the highest expressed. ACE2 gene expression showed the greatest variability along the upper
and lower airways, with greatest expression observed in the trachea samples and the lowest
expression in the small airway (Figure 1B).
Following our observation of consistent expression along the upper and lower airways of
candidate genes important in SARS-CoV, we determined if sex or age impacted gene
expression levels in healthy individuals using a curated dataset of bronchial brushings from 504
healthy subjects (Table 1). The expression levels for the candidate genes in healthy subjects
paralleled the patterns observed in the smaller survey of upper airways, trachea, large, and
small airways (Figure 2). Median ACE2 gene expression was the lowest, while GRP78 gene
expression was the highest (Figure 2A). No gene candidate demonstrated sex dependence for
expression levels (Figure 2B). No microarray chip dependent effects were observed for
relationships between sex and gene expression. For quantitative analyses related to age and
gene expression our curated database was divided into datasets that used either the HG-U133

Plus 2 or HuGene-1.0-st-v1 microarray due to differences in age distributions. In the HuGene1.0-st-v1dataset (n=181) which included a greater proportion of older (>50) individuals, we
observed reduced ACE2 gene expression with age (Figure 2C, p < 0.05).
Promoter activity data of each of the candidate genes important in SARS-CoV-2 binding
and infection were extracted and analyzed from the FANTOM5 dataset, which includes 1,886
primary cells, cell lines, and tissue sample types (Figure 3). We selected all samples formats
that included “lung”, “nasal”, “airway”, “olfactory” to identify lung-specific sample types. Gut,
heart, and prostate tissue samples were analyzed as controls. Consistent with our observed
gene expression analysis along the upper and lower airways, normalized TPM values for each
CAGE peak demonstrate that CD147 promoter activity was elevated relative to ACE2 promoter
activity across airway epithelial cells and lung tissue samples. Cathepsin L promoter activity was
the lowest of all candidate genes, which contrasted the modest expression observed at the
gene level (Figure 2A). Both microarray gene expression analysis and promoter activity were
consistent with results of candidate gene expression in a scRNAseq dataset of 10 healthy
subjects (Supplementary Figure 1).
Collectively, our gene expression analysis of the upper and lower airways of healthy
males and females of diverse ages suggests that ACE2 gene expression is low relative to all
other candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptor genes analyzed in human airway epithelial cells.
Furthermore, we observe no sex-dependent or age-dependent expression patterns of any
candidates at the gene level.
In vitro and in situ protein profiling reveals distinct expression patterns for candidates
important in SARS-CoV-2 infection
Analysis of transcriptional data may not be indicative of in situ protein expression levels[47]. To
extend our gene expression observations, we performed in vitro immunoblots on human airway
epithelial cell lysates and in situ protein immunohistochemistry on human lung tissue using the
same antibodies for each method.

An anti-ACE2 antibody detected only a single band in Calu-3 cells at the predicted
molecular weight (~110kDa) of ACE2 protein. The anti-ACE2 antibody required the use of a
super-sensitive ECL solution (Figure 4A – Top panel - Lanes 1-3). No ACE2 protein was
detected in primary airway epithelial cells or the HBEC-6KT cell line despite confirmation of
protein loading (Figure 4A – Lanes 4-9, bottom panel confirms protein loading). Independent
immunoblotting with a distinct anti-ACE2 primary antibody was performed, with a single band
observed in HEK cells, but not in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells or A549 cells
(Supplement Figure 2).
An anti-TMPRSS2 antibody detected multiple bands in all airway epithelial cell samples
with a dominant band at the predicted molecular weight of ~55kDa (Figure 4B – Top panel).
These patterns were conserved across all cell types that were analyzed.
An anti-CD147 antibody detected a single band in all airway epithelial cell samples with
a dominant band at the predicted molecular weight of ~55kDa (Figure 4C – Top panel). The
immunoblot bands were consistent with the heavy glycosylation of CD147[48].
An anti-GRP78 antibody detected a single band in all airway epithelial cell samples with
a dominant band at the predicted molecular weight of ~78kDa (Figure 4D – Top panel).
The immunoblots using anti-ACE2, CD147, and GRP78 demonstrated a single band of
predicted molecular weight, suggesting that observed immunohistochemical staining should be
specific to the protein of interest based on the target epitope, as both methods detect denatured
proteins[49]. The same anti-ACE2 and CD147 antibodies were validated for
immunohistochemistry. The anti-TMPRSS2 was used for immunohistochemistry, although the
multiple bands observed by immunoblot caution the specificity of any observed in situ staining.
Attempts to optimize anti-GRP78 antibody application for immunohistochemistry were

with chronic lung diseases (Figure 5). A single healthy human sample contained one positive
airway epithelial cell with additional positive staining in the peripheral lung in cells with type II
alveolar epithelial cell morphology (Figure 5A – second row). A representative image of a
sample from a smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Figure 5B – second row)
shows no ACE2 protein staining in the airway epithelium and a rare positive cell in subbasement membrane tissue. Lung microvasculature and human heart tissue stained had
positive staining (Supplementary Figure 3-4) consistent with previously described reports for
ACE2 protein staining patterns [50, 51].
TMPRSS2 immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse staining in the airway epithelium and
in immune cells in the lung periphery, with greater staining in smokers with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) (Figure 5A-B – third row). These observations were consistent in
the majority of the 98 human samples examined.
CD147 immunohistochemistry revealed strong membrane restricted staining in the
airway epithelium and diffuse staining in immune cells in the lung periphery, with greater
staining in smokers with COPD (Figure 5A-B – fourth row). These observations were
consistent in the majority of the 98 human samples examined.
Collectively, our in vitro and in situ protein profiling is consistent with our gene
expression analysis with CD147 protein expression dominant over TMPRSS2 and ACE2. ACE2
protein expression is rare in human lung tissue and found in select cells in both healthy
individuals and those with chronic lung diseases. TMPRSS2 and CD147 protein expression are
potentiated in individuals with a history of tobacco smoking and a diagnosis of COPD.

DISCUSSION:
The global COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in late 2019 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. The
possible host receptor(s) for SARS-CoV-2 have not been exhaustively surveyed in human lung
tissue at the gene and protein level. Understanding the expression levels and localization of
candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in host lung tissue may provide insights into therapeutic
interventions that might reduce disease spread, viral replication, or disease pathology. To
address this knowledge gap, we performed gene expression and in situ protein profiling of
candidate receptors in human airway epithelial cells and lung tissue (summarized in Figure 6).
Collectively our data demonstrate rare ACE2 protein expression in human airway epithelial cells
in vitro and in situ. Our protein expression data are consistent with low ACE2 promoter activity
in a panel of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in bronchial epithelial
cells (microarray) and lung cells (scRNAseq). We present confirmatory evidence for the
presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm
broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa. Our data suggest that for
ACE2 to be an integral receptor for SARS-CoV-2, mechanisms are likely to exist that
dynamically regulate expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2
infection[52]. It is also possible that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 are important in initial
host cell infection.
Using a curated microarray gene expression dataset generated from bronchial brushings
of 504 healthy subjects that considers the limitations of merging multiple datasets from distinct
sources, we observed that sex did not correlate with gene expression of any candidate host
molecule involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were the lowest
expressed genes of interest examined. In one dataset, ACE2 gene expression modestly
decreased with age, although protein level confirmation was not possible. The low level of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 gene expression in bulk bronchial epithelial cell gene expression samples
suggests low levels of cells expressing both of these genes within this lung tissue.

Advances in transcriptomics have enabled scRNAseq that has identified unique and rare
cell types in human lung that may have importance in health and disease[53, 54]. scRNAseq
provides an opportunity to look at transcriptional profiles in subsets of cell populations, which
may isolate a cell signal from a bulk sample. We therefore utilized scRNAseq data from healthy
human lung samples as a parallel approach. The resolution of scRNAseq for subpopulations of
epithelial cells revealed low or absent expression of ACE2 gene in all populations examined,
whereas CD147 and GRP78 were present in all populations. Our results are consistent with
current publicly available data that discuss the presence of a rare ACE2/TMPRSS2 positive
cells[52]. Using lung samples from eight individuals (four HIV and active tuberculosis double
+ve, two HIV +ve and tuberculosis -ve, and two double -ve controls), Ziegler et al. [52] have
reported in humans that only 0.8% of type II alveolar epithelial cells expressed both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 genes. Further analysis of ciliated cells found that 5.3% of these cells expressed
both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes. In vitro models with SARS-CoV, are consistent with this
finding as ciliated cells are preferentially targeted by this coronavirus[55]. Most intriguing is that
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expressing cells were only identified in the HIV and tuberculosis
double +ve samples. These observations were replicated in the upper airways, with only a rare
population of secretory epithelial cells (0.3% of this population) co-expressing ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. The reported scRNAseq results are consistent with a focused analysis looking at
only ACE2 gene expression in a variety of lung cell types[56]. Importantly, these elegant
transcriptomic analyses confirm our observations in bulk tissue microarray datasets.
Consortium based publicly available datasets represent another parallel approach to
confirm our data. We have used the FANTOM5 dataset containing CAGE promoter activation
data for 1,866 primary cells, cell lines, and tissue samples from humans[37] to examine the level
of promoter activity for each candidate SARS-CoV-2-receptor genes. The FANTOM5 CAGE
data provides an additional and complementary approach to quantifying gene expression since
a given gene’s shared promoter can yield multiple transcripts at different expression levels, as

well as being partially independent of any given transcript’s half-life in the cell. In general, the
promoter activity of ACE2 in airway-related tissues is low or absent; only a single sample
originating from an adult lung yields a normalized CAGE promoter expression level above one
transcript per million, while expression was observed in gut cells, consistent with known patterns
of ACE2 expression[57]. Consistent with the microarray data, CD147 promoter activity is
elevated relative to ACE2 across airway-related cells and tissues, although the relatively low
CTSL (cathepsin L1) promoter activity is incongruent with modest levels of gene expression.
The expression of genes does not always correlate with protein expression[47]. With this
in mind we performed immunoblot analyses on three distinct airway epithelial cell sample types.
We used the human Calu-3 adenocarcinoma cell line as this cell is susceptible and permissive
to SARS-CoV-2 infection and expresses ACE2, an observation we confirm[24, 29]. We also
used primary human airway epithelial cells and the bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC-6KT). We
performed immunoblots for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as these have been highlighted as interacting
with SARS-CoV-2, while we probed CD147 as recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have
provided proof of concept as a candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptor[26, 27]. Lastly, GRP78 was
dominantly expressed throughout transcriptomic studies and was selected as a positive control
as previous expression has been confirmed in human airway epithelial cells[58]. Cathepsin L
was excluded from the present analysis due to low promoter activity (Figure 3), while ADAM17
was excluded as the proposed function in coronavirus infections is via ACE2[5, 24], which was
included in analysis. Immunoblot analysis with all antibodies revealing dominant bands of
predicted molecular weight, with the anti-TMPRSS2 polyclonal antibody revealing additional
minor bands in all cell samples examined. The identity of these other bands remains unclear
and suggest downstream immunohistochemical analysis may be confounded by the specificity
of this antibody. In contrast, antibodies for ACE2, CD147, and GRP78 were specific and could
be used for immunohistochemistry without concerns of specificity. Interestingly, ACE2 protein
could only be detected with a supersensitive ECL solution and only in Calu-3 cells, suggesting

absent protein in primary human airway epithelial cell and the HBEC-6KT cell lines. Our data
are consistent with previous immunoblots of primary human airway epithelial cells grown under
submerged monolayer conditions using the same primary antibody, where ACE2 protein was
absent, and only expressed under air-liquid interface culture conditions[59]. The observation
that CD147 and GRP78 are also expressed in Calu-3 cells encourages further interrogation into
these host proteins, as they may contribute to function of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in SARS-CoV-2
binding and fusion in this cell type. Collectively, the profiling of antibodies by immunoblot of
airway epithelial cells revealed distinct band patterns demonstrative of antibody specificity for
ACE2, CD147, and GRP78, and to a lesser extent for TMPRSS2.
Immunohistochemical analysis has been performed for localization of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 in human lung[28, 30]. The observation of positive staining in human lung tissue for
these proteins was not accompanied by companion immunoblot or complementary approaches
to define the specificity of the antibody used[49]. In the absence of determination of antibody
specificity, the historical data presented should be interpreted with caution. To address the issue
of antibody specificity for immunohistochemical staining, we used the same antibodies we
validated by immunoblot. We again focused on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as these are candidate
proteins important for SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells. We performed parallel analysis of
CD147, but not GRP78, as the latter antibody was not validated for immunohistochemistry at
varying experimental conditions. Our immunohistochemical staining patterns of ACE2 were
consistent with transcriptional profiling and immunoblots with only 1 of 98 human samples
demonstrating rare staining in the airway and alveolar epithelium. Positive ACE2 staining in
heart tissues and areas of lung microvasculature suggest our staining protocol was successful.
These results directly contrast those reported with antibodies that lacked validation for
specificity[28, 30]. TMPRSS2 was expressed more frequently across all samples examined with
variability in the airway epithelium, associated with history of smoking and/or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease status. In contrast, CD147 expression was observed in airway epithelium of

all samples. Similar to TMPRSS2, elevated CD147 expression was associated with history of
smoking and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease status, consistent with previous
reports[48].
Our study has several limitations that have not already been addressed above. Our
observation of differences in gene expression between upper and lower airways and along the
airway tree were not corroborated at the protein level. It remains possible that entirely different
protein expression profiles for the candidate molecules examined exist in the upper airway,
presenting a different environment for SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the respiratory mucosa.
Nasal pharyngeal swabs are capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus[60] and this anatomical
region likely is important for subsequent infection in the lower airways[8]. Related to this
potential temporality of effect, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 induces the expression of
receptors on host cells following infection[52]. Our study is also limited by examining candidate
molecules important in SARS-CoV-2 infection under basal conditions, in the absence of viral or
environmental stimuli which may regulate gene transcription and protein translation.
SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. An
understanding of the receptors used by SARS-CoV-2 for host cell infection and the parallel
characterization in human samples is required to inform development of intervention strategies
aimed at mitigating COVID-19. Our data demonstrate rare ACE2 protein expression in human
airway epithelial cells in vitro and in situ, consistent with low ACE2 promoter activity and ACE2
gene expression in bronchial epithelial cells. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence
of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in
situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa. Due to the overwhelming evidence
that SARS virus interacts with ACE2, there are likely to be alternate mechanisms regulating
ACE2 in the respiratory mucosa in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and/or, perhaps other
co-receptors, beyond what is expressed under basal conditions at the protein level.
