Abstract

25
26

In previous work, Hsieh and Higgins presented a novel structure of antibodies identified from

27

malaria-exposed individuals, in which the extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of

28

leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1) is presented on the third

29

complementarity determining regions (CDR3) of the Ig heavy chain. Here we develop an

30

Antibody Display technology based on this LAIR1-containing antibody, by grafting proteins of

31

interest (POI) onto the heavy chain CDR3 while retaining the biological properties of the POI.

32

As a proof of principle, we displayed the second extracellular domain of Tetraspanin12

33

(Tspan12EC2) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the

34

heavy chain CDR3. Our data revealed that Antibody Display Tspan12EC2 bound to Norrie

35

Disease Protein (Norrin) and Antibody Display SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to angiotensin-

36

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neutralizing nanobodies. Collectively, Antibody Display

37

technology offers the general strategy of designing novel antibodies by grafting POI onto the

38

CDR3.

Introduction

48
49

Antibodies are crucial reagents for biomedical research, diagnostics, and therapeutics. The

50

conventional antibody, immunoglobulin G (IgG), has a highly conserved architecture that is

51

composed of two heavy chains and two light chains (Owen et al., 2013). Each chain contains

52

three hypervariable loops, known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), that form the

53

antigen-binding site, which determines the binding specificity for antigens (Chothia et al., 1989).

54

Unexpectedly, a group of unusual antibodies were identified recently from malaria-endemic

55

regions of Africa (Tan et al., 2016). These antibodies have a remarkable feature of the antigen-

56

binding site in which an intact collagen-binding domain, adopting the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like

57

fold, from leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1) was inserted into the

58

CDR3 of the heavy chain (Figure 1A). The LAIR1 insert carrying multiple somatic mutations

59

interacts with the repetitive interspersed families of polypeptides (RIFIN) that are expressed on

60

the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (Tan et al., 2016). A detailed

61

structural analysis of this LAIR1-containing antibody (MGD21) has been reported (Hsieh and

62

Higgins, 2017). Pieper et al., further found that malaria-exposed individuals had two additional

63

types of LAIR1-containing antibodies in which the LAIR1 insert was located between the

64

variable domain of the heavy chain (VH) and the constant domain of the heavy chain (CH1) or

65

fused to the FC fragment (Pieper et al., 2017).

66
67

The Tetraspanin (Tspan) receptor family contains 33 members in humans and play central roles

68

in diverse biological processes (cell-cell fusion, immune response, and vascularization) and

69

diseases (pathogen infection and tumorigenesis) (Charrin et al., 2014; Hemler, 2014; Vences-

Catalan and Levy, 2018). Previous structural analyses revealed that Tspan receptors adopt a

71

conserved architecture composed of four transmembrane helices (TM1–TM4), intracellular N-

72

and C-termini, a first and smaller extracellular domain (EC1; 13-30 residues) between TM1 and

73

TM2, and a second and larger extracellular domain (EC2; 70-130 residues) between TM3 and

74

TM4 (Kitadokoro et al., 2001; Oosterheert et al., 2020; Umeda et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020b;

75

Zimmerman et al., 2016). Functional studies showed that EC2 of Tspan receptors is typically a

76

critical domain for the interactions with partner proteins or pathogens on the cell surface (Green

77

et al., 2011; Rajesh et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2002). Tspan12 is important in central nervous system

78

(CNS) blood vessel development and blood-brain/retina barrier formation (Junge et al., 2009; Lai

79

et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Genetic studies revealed that (1) deficiency

80

of Tspan12 results in familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), a hereditary disorder

81

charactered by abnormal development of the retinal vasculature, often leading to retinal

82

detachment and vision loss (Junge et al., 2009; Nikopoulos et al., 2010; Poulter et al., 2010), and

83

(2) Tspan12 is a co-activator of Norrie Disease Protein (also named Norrin) mediated β-catenin

84

signaling (Junge et al., 2009; Luhmann et al., 2005; Stenman et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2004).

85

Norrin, a secreted cystine-knot growth factor, activates β-catenin signaling by binding to the

86

extracellular cystine-rich domain (CRD) of Frizzled4 (Fz4) and the N-terminal domains of low-

87

density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (Lrp5/6) (Chang et al., 2015; Ke et al., 2013;

88

Smallwood et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2004). Deficiencies of Fz4 and Lrp5 also result in FEVR

89

(Robitaille et al., 2002; Toomes et al., 2004). Recently, Lai et al. suggested that the EC2 of

90

Tspan12 (Tspan12EC2) is a critical region for Norrin binding (Lai et al., 2017). However, whether

91

Tspan12EC2 interacts with Norrin directly remains obscure because of the technical challenge of

obtaining recombinant Tspan12EC2 without its conserved transmembrane helices (Junge et al.,

93

2009; Lai et al., 2017).

94
95

The worldwide spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) causing by severe acute

96

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic (Zhou et al.,

97

2020a; Zhu et al., 2020). The surface of the SARS-CoV-2 particle is decorated with the heavily

98

glycosylated trimeric spike (S) protein protruding from the virus membrane envelope (Fung and

99

Liu, 2019; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Watanabe et al., 2020;

100

Wrapp et al., 2020b; Yao et al., 2020). Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains the

101

receptor-binding domain (RBD) which mediates the interaction with a virus entry receptor,

102

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is an attractive

103

target for therapeutic and vaccine development (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Zhou

104

et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020b). SARS-CoV-2 S protein is immunogenic and the major target

105

of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent individuals (Barnes et al., 2020; Baum

106

et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Walls et

107

al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020b). Furthermore, Piccoli et al., showed that more

108

than 90% of these neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent plasma target the RBD

109

of SARS-CoV-2 S protein for protective humoral responses (Piccoli et al., 2020). However,

110

recent studies showed that mutations in the RBD present in the current circulating SARS-CoV-2

111

variants decrease the potency of neutralizing antibodies (Greaney et al., 2021; Starr et al., 2021;

112

Weisblum et al., 2020). Therefore, understanding how the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

113

responds to ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies is critical for ongoing vaccine development,

117

In this report, we have developed an antibody-based display approach, termed Antibody Display,

118

by grafting proteins of interest (POI) onto the heavy chain CDR3 to generate biological active

119

and stably folded chimera antibodies. As a proof of principle, we used the structure-guided

120

protein design approach based on the structure of LAIR1-containing antibody (Hsieh and

121

Higgins, 2017) to display the EC2 of Tspan12 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as

122

insertions at the tip of the heavy chain CDR3. We showed that Antibody Display Tspan12EC2

123

(Tspan12EC2-AD) bound to Norrin and Antibody Display SARS-CoV-2 RBD (RBD-AD) bound

124

to ACE2 and two neutralizing nanobodies (VHH-72 and H11-D4). We also designed a

125

humanized and engineering variable domain of the heavy chain alone to display the RBD of

126

SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed its binding properties.

Design, expression and purification of Antibody Display Tspan12EC2

140

The design of the Antibody Display was informed by structural studies of LAIR1-containing

141

antibody (Figure 1A) (Hsieh and Higgins, 2017). We hypothesized that POI could graft onto the

142

heavy chain CDR3 via two short peptide linkers to generate chimeric antibodies while retaining

143

the biological features of the POI. To test this concept, we focused initially on Tspan12EC2,

144

because (1) Tspan12EC2 protrudes from two transmembrane helices of Tspan12 suggesting that

145

the N- and C-termini of Tspan12EC2 could be linked to b-strands G and F of the heavy chain in a

146

manner that preserves their native spacing (Figure 1B) and (2) the biomedical importance of

147

Tspan12 in retinal vascular diseases.

148
149

We began our design by searching for homologous structures and conducting a multiple

150

sequence alignment of Tspan25 (CD53) (Yang et al., 2020b), Tspan28 (CD81) (Kitadokoro et

151

al., 2001; Zimmerman et al., 2016), and Tspan29 (CD9) (Oosterheert et al., 2020; Umeda et al.,

152

2020) with Tspan12, as shown in Figure 1–Figure supplement 1A. The obtained information

153

led us to generate constructs having different boundaries of Tspan12EC2 for expression trials in

154

HEK293T cells (Figure 1–Figure supplement 1B). The constructs contained an N-terminal

155

signal peptide and C-terminal monomeric Venus (mVenus) and 12xHis tags. To assess the level

156

of secreted mVenus fusion protein expression, we used a time- and cost-efficient method,

157

immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by in-gel fluorescent imaging

158

(Chang et al., 2020). Variations in the location of the Tspan12EC2 N- and C-termini produced

159

large effects on protein yield (Figure 1–Figure supplement 1C). Construct 4 (Tspan12 residues

160

116-220) exhibited the highest yield, somewhat less than 0.1 mg/L, consistent with previous

161

studies showing the technical difficulties in producing recombinant Tspan12EC2 (Junge et al.,

162

2009; Lai et al., 2017). As the secretory pathway in mammalian cells has stringent protein

163

quality-control machinery to ensure that secreted proteins are folded correctly (Trombetta and

164

Parodi, 2003), the expression trials imply that residues 116-220 corresponds to a core folding

165

unit of Tspan12EC2.

166
167

We next generated a three-dimensional model of Tspan12EC2 and designed Antibody Display

168

Tspan12EC2 (Tspan12EC2-AD) model in a Fab format, Fab (Tspan12EC2), by computationally

169

grafting the Tspan12EC2 onto the heavy chain CDR3 based on the structure of LAIR1-containing

170

antibody (Figure 1C). We designed constructs based on these principles: (1) placing the core

171

folding unit of Tspan12EC2 at the tip of the heavy chain CDR3 to maximally expose its binding

172

regions for ligand binding, (2) preventing steric clashes between the Tspan12EC2 and the CDR

173

loops of the heavy chain and light chain, and (3) testing variations in the length and flexibility of

174

the connecting linkers between the Tspan12EC2 and the heavy chain. Five designs of these

175

chimeric heavy chain constructs (Figure 1–Figure supplement 2A) were co-transfected with

176

light chain constructs in HEK293T cells to yield secreted Fab proteins and were assessed for

177

expression level using IMAC followed by in-gel fluorescent imaging (Figure 1–Figure

178

supplement 2B). Interestingly, only two of these designs (construct 1 and 5) could be expressed

179

as secreted Fab proteins by passing the protein quality-control machinery in mammalian cells

180

(Figure 1–Figure supplement 2B). Specifically, Tspan12EC2-AD (construct 5) with the highest

181

yield contained Tspan12 residues 115-220 and had the shortest connecting linkers (Figure 1–

182

Figure supplement 2B). This Tspan12EC2-AD was produced at 1 mg/L, a yield close to that of

the LAIR1-containing antibody (Hsieh and Higgins, 2017), and showed a 10-fold higher

184

expression level than Tspan12EC2 (Figure 1–Figure supplement 1C).

185
186

Functional analyses of Antibody Display Tspan12EC2

187

Next, to assess if Tspan12EC2-AD adopted the correct fold of Tspan12EC2, we tested the ability of

188

recombinant Tspan12EC2 to bind to Norrin as measured by a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase

189

(AP) reaction-based protein-protein interaction assay using an AP-Norrin fusion protein as a

190

probe (Xu et al., 2004). Each bait protein had a biotinylated C-terminal Avi-tag and was captured

191

on a streptavidin coated micro-well. Tspan12EC2 bound to AP-Norrin (Figure 1D and Figure 1–

192

Figure supplement 3), as did the CRD of Fz4 (Fz4CRD) and the leucine-rich repeat domain of

193

Leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4LRR), extracellular domains

194

that are known to bind to Norrin (Chang et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2015; Xu et

195

al., 2004). As expected, AP-Norrin did not bind to Fz5CRD (Figure 1D) (Chang et al., 2015;

196

Smallwood et al., 2007). Importantly, Tspan12EC2-AD bound to AP-Norrin as did Tspan12EC2

197

(Figure 1D). Taken together, these results show that (1) EC2 of Tspan12 mediates Norrin

198

binding, in agreement with previous genetic studies using domain swaps within full-length

199

Tspan12 together with co-immunoprecipitation (Lai et al., 2017), and (2) correctly folded

200

Tspan12EC2 can be grafted onto the heavy chain CDR3 without losing Norrin binding.

Design, expression and purification of Antibody Display SARS-CoV-2 RBD

203

To assess whether the design principle of the Antibody Display can apply to other protein folds,

204

we tested the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We began the design of the Antibody Display

205

SARS-CoV-2 RBD (RBD-AD) by searching the three-dimensional RBD structures of SARS-

CoV-2 S protein (Barnes et al., 2020; Huo et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls

207

et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Wrapp et al., 2020b; Yuan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). As

208

shown in Figure 2A, we computationally grafted the RBD structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

209

onto the heavy chain CDR3 of LAIR1-containing antibody to generate a model in in a Fab

210

format, Fab (RBD), by using the same design principles as Tspan12EC2-AD.

211
212

Furthermore, we hypothesized that a single VH domain could serve as a scaffold to display

213

SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the absence of light chains. Indeed, human single VH domain mimicking

214

nanobodies from camels has been developed as a minimum size of antigen recognition unit in the

215

absence of light chains (Davies and Riechmann, 1995; Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993), although

216

specific hallmark mutations are required to maintain the solubility and the binding property of

217

the single VH domain (Davies and Riechmann, 1995; Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993;

218

Muyldermans, 2013). More recently, Wu et al., identified a highly soluble and stable single VH

219

domain from the human germline Ig heavy chain variable region 3-66*1 (IGHV3-66*1) allele

220

(Wu et al., 2020a). Therefore, we next designed an engineered single VH domain (eVH) based on

221

the IGHV3-66*1 for the display of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, eVH(RBD), as shown in Figure 2–

222

Figure supplement 2.

223
224

Functional analyses of Antibody Display SARS-CoV-2 RBD

225

To verify whether RBD-AD retained binding to ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, we generated

226

AP fusion proteins with the extracellular domain of ACE2 (ACE2ECD-AP) and two anti-RBD

227

nanobodies (NBVHH-72-AP and NBH11-D4-AP) (Huo et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020a) (Figure 2–

228

229

eVH(RBD) constructs had a C-terminal mVenus and biotinylated Avi-tag, immobilized on

230

streptavidin-coated wells (Figure 2B and Figure 2–Figure supplement 3), and (2) an

231

eVH(RBD) construct contained the human IgG Fc fusion at the C-terminus, immobilized on a

232

protein G-coated well (Figure 2C). As measured the binding by AP reaction-based assays, Fab

233

(RBD) and eVH(RBD) bound robustly and specifically to ACE2ECD-AP, NBVHH-72-AP, and

234

NBH11-D4-AP (Figure 2B-C and Figure 2–Figure supplement 3). We conclude that RBD of

235

SARS-CoV-2 S protein can be displayed on the heavy chain CDR3 in functional form.

Discussion

253
254

We present a novel antibody engineering approach, named Antibody Display, by grafting POI

255

onto the heavy chain CDR3, which were designed through a structure-guided approach built on

256

the architecture of LAIR1-containing antibodies naturally occurred in malaria-exposed

257

individuals (Hsieh and Higgins, 2017; Tan et al., 2016). Most importantly, each POI retained its

258

biological properties by taking advantage of the structural conservation and stability of the

259

antibody Ig fold. As a proof of principle, we showed that the design and production of

260

Tspan12EC2-AD and RBD-AD were successful. Colorimetric AP reaction-based binding assays

261

further revealed that Tspan12EC2-AD bound to Norrin and RBD-AD bound to ACE2 and NBs

262

(VHH-72 and H11-D4). Our findings suggest a generic design principle of the Antibody Display,

263

particularly for the POI adopting a non-Ig like fold: (1) a known structure or a computational

264

model derived from homologous protein structures, (2) N and C termini in proximity to graft

265

onto the b-strands G and F of the heavy chain, and (3) prevention of steric clashes with the

266

antibody. At present, the limitations for selecting POI for Antibody Display such as protein

267

shape and size remain unclear; further studies will be required to address these questions.

268

Comparing with conventional Fc fusion proteins in which the POI is fused to the N terminus of

270

Fc usually including the flexible hinge region, we reasoned that the Antibody Display, which

271

grafts the POI onto the b-strands G and F of the heavy chain, provides several potential

272

advantages: (1) design and production of a more conformationally constrained chimeric protein,

273

(2) reduction of proteolysis with the POI inserted into a stable antibody Ig fold, and (3) extension

274

of the current antibody engineering toolkit for generating bispecific and chimeric antibodies.

275

Further studies will be needed to explore these potential advantages.

276
277

An intriguing feature of using the Antibody Display for Tspan12EC2 is with a better yield of

278

protein production than Tspan12EC2. Our functional assays demonstrated that Tspan12EC2 bound

279

to Norrin directly, in agreement with previous genetic studies (Lai et al., 2017). As Tspan12

280

playing critical roles in CNS vascular development (Junge et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2018) and

281

tumorigenesis (Knoblich et al., 2014; Otomo et al., 2014), Tspan12EC2-AD may be a useful

282

reagent for these studies. Moreover, Tspan proteins are well known for their important roles in

283

regulating tumor migration, invasion and metastasis (Charrin et al., 2014; Hemler, 2014; Vences-

284

Catalan and Levy, 2018). Antibodies targeting Tspan29 (CD9), particularly on its EC2 region,

285

have been shown to inhibit the progression of colorectal and gastric cancers (Nakamoto et al.,

286

2009; Ovalle et al., 2007). Furthermore, Tspan proteins are used by several pathogens for

287

infection (Charrin et al., 2014). For example, Hepatitis C Virus and P. falciparum use Tspan28

288

(CD81) for infection of hepatocytes (Pileri et al., 1998; Silvie et al., 2003). However, research on

289

Tspan receptors has been hampered by the lack of an efficient approach to produce recombinant

290

EC2 proteins. So far, only Tspan25 (CD53), Tspan28 (CD81), and Tspan29 (CD9) have been

291

produced for biochemical and structural analyses among 33 Tspan receptors (Kitadokoro et al.,

292

2001; Oosterheert et al., 2020; Umeda et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020b; Zimmerman et al., 2016).

293

More studies will be required to investigate whether the Antibody Display can apply to other

294

Tspan proteins.

SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and several types of COVID-19 vaccines such as

297

nucleic acids, viral vectors, and protein subunits have been developed for vaccinations globally

298

(Connors et al., 2021). Ongoing studies have shown that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is

299

the major target of neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent individuals (Barnes et

300

al., 2020; Baum et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Piccoli et al.,

301

2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020b), consistent

302

with recent findings showing that the RBD, particularly decorated on nanoparticles, can induce a

303

protective humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Cohen et al., 2021; Tan et

304

al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020a). In this report, we demonstrated that the Antibody Display can be

305

used to display the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the heavy chain CDR3 without losing its

306

binding properties. It is not yet known whether RBD-AD can induce neutralizing antibodies, but

307

it would be an interesting test case and it could be relevant for the future preparedness and

308

response capacity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Construct design and molecular cloning

322

The human complementary DNA clones of Fz4, Fz5, and Tspan12 were gifts from Jeremy

323

Nathans and the human ACE2 clone (Shang et al., 2020) was obtained from Addgene (code

324

145033). Synthetic DNA fragments of engineered VH containing SARS-CoV-2 RBD (resi 333-

325

527; with a P527A mutation; UniProtKB code P0DTC2; Figure 2–Figure supplement 2),

326

NBVHH-72 (PDB code 6WAQ), and NBH11-D4 (PDB code 6YZ5) were obtained from Integrated

327

DNA Technologies. Expression plasmids of MGD21 heavy chain pOPINVH and MGD21 light

328

chain pOPINVL were described Hsieh and Higgins, 2017. The AP fusion Norrin construct was

329

described in Xu et al., 2004.

330
331

The following five backbone constructs used for the Fc fusion or biotinylated baits and AP

332

fusion probes were derived from the pHLsec vector (Aricescu et al., 2006). (1) The pHLsec-3C-

333

Fc (C103A)-8H vector contains a C-terminal Human Rhinovirus (HRV)-3C protease cleavage

334

site followed by the human immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (resi 102-330; having a

335

C103A mutation to remove an unpaired cysteine; UniProtKB code P01857) and an 8xHis tag. (2)

336

The pHLsec-Fc-Avi-6H vector contains the human immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1

337

(resi 101-330; UniProtKB code P01857) followed by an Avi tag that can be biotinylated by BirA

338

ligases and a 6xHis tag. (3) The pHLsec-3C-mVenus-Avi-8H vector derived from pHLsec-

339

mVenus-12H (Chang et al., 2015) was tagged with a C-terminally HRV-3C protease cleavage

340

site followed by a mVenus fusion protein, an Avi tag and finally an 8xHis tag. (4) The pHL-N-

341

AP-Myc-8H vector was constructed N-terminally with the human alkaline phosphatase (AP; resi

343

The pHLsec-C-Myc-AP-8H vector contains a C-terminal Myc tag followed by the human AP

344

(resi 18-506; NCBI code NP_001623) and finally an 8xHis tag.

345
346

Tspan12 coding segments for the EC2 were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pHLsec-

347

mVenus-12H (Chang et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2015). Tspan12EC2 inserts were grafted into a

348

modified MGD21 heavy chain vector containing a C-terminal HRV-3C protease cleavage site

349

followed by a mVenus fusion protein and finally an 8xHis tag (pHLsec-mMGD21-3C-mVenus-

350

Avi-8H), by using three-fragments overlapping PCR experiments. The MGD21 light chain

351

mutant (C91A and C93A) vector was generated by using a two-step overlapping PCR method. A

352

DNA segment coding for CRD of Fz4 (resi 40-179) was constructed into the pHLsec-Fc-Avi-6H

353

and pHLsec-3C-mVenus-Avi-8H. The CRD of Fz5 (resi 31-181) were cloned into the pHLsec-

354

Fc-Avi-6H, pHLsec-3C-mVenus-Avi-8H, and pHL-N-AP-Myc-8H vectors. The Lgr4LRR was

355

constructed into the pHLsec-3C-mVenus-Avi-8H vector. SARS-CoV-2 RBD insert was grafted

356

into the pHLsec-mMGD21-3C-mVenus-Avi-8H vector. An engineered VH containing SARS-

357

CoV-2 RBD was constructed into the pHLsec-3C-mVenus-Avi-8H and pHLsec-3C-Fc (C103A)-

358

8H vectors. ACE2ECD (resi 19-615), NBVHH-72, and NBH11-D4 were cloned into the pHLsec-AP-8H

359

vector. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

361

Computational modeling and structure-based design

362

The HHpred server (Soding et al., 2005; Zimmermann et al., 2018) was used to search for

363

homologs of Tspan12EC2 in the protein structure database of the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The

364

structures of Tspan28 (CD81; PDB codes 1G8Q and 5TCX) were selected to generate an initial

computational model of Tspan12EC2 with Modeller (Eswar et al., 2006). Notably, the structures

366

of Tspan25 (CD53; PDB code 6WVG), and Tspan29 (CD9, PDB codes 6RLR and 6K4J) were

367

not available during the HHpred search. For the protein design of Antibody Display Tspan12EC2,

368

LAIR1 insert was removed from the model of MGD21 Fab fragment (PDB code 5NST) and the

369

Tspan12EC2 model was docked into the MGD21 VH manually by using COOT (Emsley et al.,

370

2010) and PyMOL Molecular Graphic System (Schrödinger, LLC). For the structure-guided

371

design of Antibody Display SARS-CoV-2 RBD, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD

372

(PBD code 6YLA) was selected and docked into the VH region of the antibody manually by

373

using COOT (Emsley et al., 2010).

375

Protein expression and purification

376

HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) cells were maintained and transfected with the DNA using

377

polyethylenimine (MilliporeSigma 408727) following the established procedures (Aricescu et

378

al., 2006; Chang et al., 2015; Hsieh and Higgins, 2017; Hsieh et al., 2016). For Antibody Display

379

Tspan12EC2, DNA constructs expressing heavy chain and light chain were mixed into a 1 to 1

380

ratio and co-expressed in HEK293T cells. For the biotinylated bait preparations, bait constructs

381

were mixed with a pHLsec-BirA-ER vector (Chang et al., 2015) into a 3 to 1 ratio and co-

382

transfected in HEK293T cells in the presence of 0.1 mM Biotin (MilliporeSigma B4639). The

383

biotinylated baits were purified from conditioned media by the immobilized metal affinity

384

chromatography (IMAC) method as previously described in (Chang et al., 2020). IMAC method

385

was also used for the purification of His tagged Fc fusion and AP fusion proteins. To evaluate

386

the expression level of secreted mVenus fusion proteins from conditioned media, IMAC

Alkaline Phosphatase based binding assay

391

The purified Fc fusion baits were captured on 96-well protein-G coated plates (Thermo Fisher

392

Scientific 15131). The biotinylated baits were immobilized on 96-well streptavidin-coated plates

393

(Thermo Fisher Scientific 15500). The wells were then washed three times with wash buffer (10

394

mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween-20) and incubated with a 10-fold

395

dilution of Blocker bovine serum albumin (BSA; Thermo Fisher Scientific 37525) in wash buffer

396

for 1 h at 25 °C. The wells were washed with wash buffer and incubated with conditioned media

397

containing AP probes at 4 °C overnight. The wells were subsequently washed three times with

398

wash buffer and incubated with BluePhos phosphatase substrate solution (Kirkegaard and Perry

399

Laboratories 50-88-00) to visualize the bound AP probes.

Figure 1. Antibody Display Tspan12EC2 (Tspan12EC2-AD). (A) Schematic representation of a
LAIR1-containing antibody. Each Fab region is composed of variable domains of the heavy
chain (VH) and the light chain (VL), constant domains of the heavy chain (CH1) and the light
chain (CL), and a LAIRI insert on the VH. The Fc region contains constant domains of the heavy
chain (CH2 and CH3). (B) Diagram representation of a LAIRI insert on the VH and the construct
