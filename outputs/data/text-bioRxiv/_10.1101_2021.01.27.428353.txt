Abstract

18

Spontaneous and selection-pressure-driven evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has started to pose more

19

challenges to controlling the pandemic. Here, we first investigated cross-species receptor

20

usage of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerged during the pandemic. We found that, in

21

contrast to an early isolate WHU01, the circulating variants B.1.1.7/501Y.V1,

22

B.1.351/501Y.V2, and P.1/501Y.V3 were able to use rat and mouse Ace2 orthologs as entry

23

receptors, suggesting that rats and mice might be able to harbor and spread these variants. We

24

then evaluated in vitro sensitivity of these variants to three therapeutic antibodies in clinics

25

(etesevimab/LY-CoV016, casirivimab/REGN10933, and imdevimab/REGN10987) and an

26

ACE2-Ig variant we developed recently. We found that all the tested SARS-CoV-2 variants

27

showed reduced sensitivity to at least one of the tested antibodies but slightly increased

28

sensitivity to the ACE2-Ig protein. These data demonstrate that the ACE2-Ig is a good drug

29

candidate against SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.

Introduction

31

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of

32

the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has already caused about 100

33

million confirmed infections and over 2 million documented deaths across 224 countries,

34

according

35

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

36

triggered unprecedentedly extensive worldwide efforts to develop countermeasures against

37

COVID-19, and a number of encouraging progresses have been achieved in developing

38

prophylactic vaccines and antibody therapeutics1-9. So far, there are at least six prophylactic

39

COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved by different countries for clinical use. These

40

include two mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, US; Moderna, US)1,2, two inactivated vaccines

41

(Sinopharm, China; Sinovac, China)3-5, and two adenoviral vectored vaccines (Sputnik V,

42

Russia; AstraZeneca-Oxford, UK)6,7.

43

antibodies that have been approved for clinical use, such as Regeneron’s antibody cocktail

44

consisting of casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987)8.

45

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that has broad host ranges10-13. We recently found that

46

SARS-CoV-2 can use human ACE2 and a wide range of animal-Ace2 orthologs, but not rat or

47

mouse Ace2, for cell entry 11. However, a single amino-acid change within the Spike receptor-

48

binding domain (RBD; Q498H, Q498Y, or N501Y) could be sufficient to confer SARS-CoV-

49

2 the ability to utilize mouse Ace2ref.14-17. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus with

50

moderate mutation and recombination frequencies18,19. Spontaneous and selection-pressure-

51

driven mutations, especially those within the Spike RBD region, might alter cross-species

52

receptor usage by SARS-CoV-2, or compromise the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies and

53

vaccines based on the Spike sequence of early SARS-CoV-2 strains, posing additional

54

challenges to controlling the pandemic. Therefore, in this study, we investigated cross-species

receptor usage, as well as neutralization sensitivity, of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that

56

emerged during the pandemic.

Results

58

Spike RBD is the major determinant of viral receptor usage and neutralization sensitivity, we

59

thus primarily focused on RBD mutations found in different variants, especially the Variants

60

of Concern (VOC) that emerged from the UK (VOC202012/01, also known as B.1.1.7 or

61

501Y.V1), South Africa (VOC202012/02, also known as 501Y.V2 or B.1.351), and Brazil

62

(VOC202101/02, also known as P.1 or 501Y.V3), respectively. These include an N439K

63

mutation from the circulating variant B.1.141ref.20, an N501Y mutation from B.1.1.7/501Y.V1

64

21,22

65

mutation from two mink-associated variants that emerged in Netherlands and Denmark mink

66

farms25-27 (Figure 1). We further included a Spike Y453F-Q498H double mutant that has not

67

been detected in patient samples yet, but could evolve from the early isolate WHU01 through

68

adopting only two nucleotide mutations, or from the mink-associated Y453F variant through

69

adopting a single nucleotide mutation. To evaluate Spike protein-mediated viral entry of the

70

above-mentioned variants, we constructed Spike expression plasmids for these variants and

71

produced luciferase reporter retroviruses pseudotyped with one of these different Spike variants.

72

As rats and mice are rodent species that have huge population size and could have close

73

contacts with human and domestic animal populations, it’s important to monitor SARS-CoV-

74

2’s ability to utilize rat and mouse Ace2 as receptor. We therefore used the Spike variant-

75

pseudotyped reporter viruses to infect 293T cells transfected with an expression plasmid of

76

human, rat, or mouse ACE2 ortholog.

77

transfected with an empty vector plasmid were included as controls. Consistent with our

78

previous report, the early strain WHU01 only infected 293T cells expressing human ACE2, but

, E484K and N501Y mutations from B.1.351/501Y.V223 and P.1/501Y.V3 24, and a Y453F

not rat or mouse Ace2 (Figure 2A). Though the variant carrying Δ(69-70)-N439K mutations

80

and the mink-associated variant carrying Δ(69-70)-Y453F mutations did so too (Figures 2B

81

and C), the mink-associated variant that carries Δ(69-70)-Y453F-F486L-N501T-M1229I

82

mutations also infected 293T cells expressing mouse Ace2, albeit with much lower efficiency

83

than infecting cells expressing human ACE2 (Figure 2D). It is of note that, in addition to the

84

Y453F-Q498H variant, all the variants that carry an N501Y mutation efficiently utilized all the

85

three Ace2 orthologs (Figures 2E-H).

86

mutations utilized rat Ace2 even more efficiently than using human ACE2 (Figure 2G). These

87

data suggest that the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7/501Y.V1, B.1.351/501Y.V2,

88

and P.1/501Y.V3 may be able to efficiently infect mice and rats, adding one more concerning

89

factor to these VOC strains.

90

We then performed neutralization assays to evaluate sensitivity of these SARS-CoV-2 variants

91

to three therapeutic antibodies in clinics (etesevimab/LY-CoV016, casirivimab/REGN10933,

92

and imdevimab/REGN10987)8,9 and an ACE2-Ig variant we developed recently11. When

93

tested against the early strain WHU01, the Regeneron antibody casirivimab neutralized the

94

virus with the best potency, about 3-fold more potent than our ACE2-Ig, and about 20-fold

95

more potent than the monoclonal antibody etesevimab (Figure 3A and Table 1). When tested

96

against the variants, all the antibodies in general showed decreased sensitivity to at least one

97

variant (Figures 3B-H). Specifically, variants carrying an N501Y or N501T mutation were

98

found to be highly resistant to etesevimab (Figures 3D-G). Variants carrying a Y453F mutation

99

were found to be highly resistant to casirivimab (Figures 3C and D). It is of note that the Δ(69-

100

70)-Y453F-F486L-N501T-M1229I mutations carried by mink-associated variants and the

101

K417N-E484K-N501Y mutations carried by the South Africa VOC strain B.1.351/501Y.V2

102

made the virus highly resistant to both etesevimab and casirivimab, adding another concerning

103

factor to these two variants (Figures 3D and G). In addition, the Spike Y453F-Q498H double

mutation made the virus partially resistant to etesevimab and highly resistant to both of the

105

Regeneron antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab (Figure 3H).

106

neutralization data, structural data analysis revealed contact of etesevimab with RBD residues

107

K417 and N501, casirivimab with RBD residues Y453, E484, and F486, and imdevimab with

108

RBD residues N439 and Q498 (Figures 3I-K). On the other hand, when tested against the

109

variants, ACE2-Ig protein did not lose efficacy at all. Rather, it seems that ACE2-Ig gains

110

potency along with the course of the pandemic, consistent with the neutralizing mechanism of

111

this protein (Figures 3A-G and Table 1).

112

Discussion

113

The Spike protein is the major host-range determinant and neutralizing antigen of SARS-CoV-

114

2. It has been undergoing a number of mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic

115

in the end of 2019ref.10,20-25,27-29. With more and more SARS-CoV-2 variants being identified

116

to carry diverse Spike mutations within the RBD region, especially the Variants of Concern

117

initially identified in the UK (B.1.1.7 lineage)21,22, South Africa (501Y.V2 lineage)23, and

118

Brazil (P.1 lineage)24, it is critical to understand whether the host range and neutralization

119

sensitivity of these variants have changed. In this study, we first investigated cross-species

120

receptor usage of an early SARS-CoV-2 isolate and multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants that

121

emerged during the pandemic (Figure 2). A mink-associated variant that carries Δ(69-70)-

122

Y453F-F486L-N501T-M1229I mutations was found also able to utilize mouse Ace2. In

123

addition, all the variants that carry an N501Y mutation, a shared feature of the UK, South

124

Africa, and Brazil VOC strains, were found able to efficiently use rat and mouse Ace2

125

orthologs for entry (Figures 2E-G), consistent with the identification of N501Y as the mouse-

126

susceptibility determinant of a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain16. Moreover, the K417N-

127

E484K-N501Y mutations found in the South Africa variant 501Y.V2 even enable the virus to

128

utilize rat Ace2 more efficiently than using human ACE2. These data suggest that rats and

129

mice may be able to harbor and spread these variants. Rats and mice are vaccine-inaccessible

130

rodent species that have large population size and could have close contacts with both human

131

and domestic animal populations. It is possible that the N501Y-associated circulating variants

132

might have emerged as an adaptation to rats before being passed back to humans. It is therefore

133

critical to closely monitor cross-species transmission and evolution of these SARS-CoV-2

134

variants.

135

We also evaluated sensitivity of these variants to three therapeutic antibodies in clinics

136

(etesevimab/LY-CoV016, casirivimab/REGN10933, and imdevimab/REGN10987) and an

137

ACE2-Ig variant we developed recently (Figure 3 and Table 1). We found that all the tested

138

Spike mutations were able to confer resistance to at least one of the three tested antibodies. A

139

mink-associated strain and the South Africa VOC strain 501Y.V2 are highly resistant to both

140

etesevimab and casirivimab. The South Africa VOC strain 501Y.V2 and the Brazil VOC strain

141

P.1/501Y.V3 are identical within the RBD region except that 501Y.V2 RBD adopted a K417N

142

mutation and P.1/501Y.V3 RBD adopted a K417T mutation, it’s therefore likely that the Brazil

143

VOC strain P.1/501Y.V3 is also highly resistant to both etesevimab and casirivimab. More

144

importantly, two simple amino-acid mutations in the Spike, Y453F-Q498H, made the virus

145

partially resistant to etesevimab and highly resistant to both casirivimab and imdevimab, the

146

two monoclonal antibodies constituting Regeneron’s FDA-approved antibody cocktail. The

147

Y453F-Q498H double mutant has not been detected in patient samples yet. However, it could

148

easily evolve from the early isolate WHU01 through adopting only two nucleotide mutations,

149

or evolve from mink-associated Y453F variant or mouse-adapted Q498H variant through

150

adopting a single nucleotide mutation. Potential cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2

151

variants, such as the South Africa VOC strain 501Y.V2, from humans to rats or mice, to

152

domestic animals, and then back to humans, might accelerate the emergence of new variants.

153

Immune pressures, such as clinical applications of non-broadly neutralizing antibodies or

154

vaccines, or patients’ immune reactions to SARS-CoV-2 infections, are also prone to drive

155

more and more immune-evasion mutations. These mutation-driving factors altogether will

156

likely accelerate the loss of efficacy of the therapeutic antibodies and possibly the vaccines in

157

clinics, posing additional challenges to the ongoing devastating pandemic. Indeed, during

158

preparation of this manuscript, multiple preprint reports have shown that the 501Y.V2 variant

159

significantly reduced the potency of vaccine-induced neutralization antibodies30-32.

160

therefore urgent to develop broadly anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics or vaccines.

161

Soluble ACE2 protein, which neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection through competitive blocking

162

the interaction between viral Spike protein and cell-surface receptor ACE2, represents a good

163

candidate that will be hardly escaped by SARS-CoV-2 variants. It could also be a good

164

alternative anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent to the populations who are reluctant to take, not responsive

165

to, or don’t have access to any prophylactic vaccines. Recently we have developed a panel of

166

ACE2-Ig variants that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 early isolate at picomolar range, and

167

have demonstrated that the protein is broadly effective against four distinct coronaviruses,

168

suggesting that the protein could be used to protect from SARS-CoV-2 and some other SARS-

169

CoV-2-like viruses that might spillover into humans in the future11.

170

demonstrated that the ACE2-Ig protein is broadly effective against all the tested SARS-CoV-2

171

variants, including the ones simultaneously resistant to two or three neutralizing antibodies.

172

Perhaps more importantly, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 evolution tend to reduce sensitivity to

173

neutralizing antibodies while increasing sensitivity to ACE2-Ig (Figure 3 and Table 1). These

174

data suggest that ACE2 is still likely an essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and that ACE2-Ig

175

could be used to treat and prevent infection of any SARS-CoV-2 variant that emerges over the

176

course of the pandemic. Animal studies to test and optimize pharmacokinetics, as well as in

177

vivo anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy, of the ACE2-Ig protein are ongoing.

348

transfected with 100 µg plasmid in complex with 250 µg PEI MAX 4000 (Polysciences, Inc,

349

Cat. No. 24765-1). Cell culture supernatants were collected at 48 to 72 hours post transfection.

350

Human IgG1 Fc-containing proteins were purified using Protein A Sepharose CL-4B (GE

351

three anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Virus-inhibitor mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for

389

30min, then added to HeLa-hACE2 cells in 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

390

Virus-inhibitor-containing supernatant was then removed and changed with 150 µL of fresh

391

DMEM (2% FBS) and incubated at 37 °C. Cell culture supernatants were collected for Gaussia

392

luciferase assay at 48 h post infection.
