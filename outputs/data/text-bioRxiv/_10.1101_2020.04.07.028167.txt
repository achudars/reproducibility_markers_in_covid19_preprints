Detection of pathogenic sequences or variants in DNA and RNA through a
point-of-care diagnostic approach is valuable for rapid clinical prognosis. In
recent times, CRISPR based detection of nucleic acids has provided an
economical and quicker alternative to sequencing-based platforms which are
often difficult to implement in the field. Here, we present FnCas9 Editor Linked
Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that employs a highly accurate enzymatic
readout for detecting nucleotide sequences, identifying nucleobase identity
and inferring zygosity with precision. We demonstrate that FELUDA output can
be adapted to multiple signal detection platforms and can be quickly designed
and deployed for versatile applications including rapid diagnosis during
infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19.

The rise of CRISPR Cas9 based approaches for biosensing nucleic acids has
opened up a broad diagnostic portfolio for CRISPR products beyond their standard
genome editing abilities1,2. In recent times, CRISPR components have been
successfully used for detecting a wide variety of nucleic acid targets such as those
obtained from pathogenic microorganisms or disease-causing mutations from
various biological specimens3-10. At the heart of such a detection procedure lies the
property of CRISPR proteins to accurately bind to target DNA or RNA, undergo
conformational changes leading to cleavage of targets generating a reporter-based
signal outcome11-15. To enable such a detection mechanism to be foolproof, sensitive
and reproducible across a large variety of targets, the accuracy of DNA interrogation
and subsequent enzyme activity is extremely critical, particularly when clinical
decisions are to be made based on these results1,2.
Current technologies relying on using CRISPR components for nucleic acid detection
can sense the identity of the target either through substrate cleavage mediated by an
active CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or by binding through a catalytically
inactive RNP complex. Cleavage outcomes are then converted to a reporter-based
readout with or without signal amplification. Among the CRISPR proteins that have
been used so far, Cas9 and Cas12 or their inactive forms have been predominantly
employed for detecting DNA sequences while Cas13 has been used for both DNA
and RNA sequences. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and
limitations that are related to sensitivity, specificity and read-out modes for an
accurate diagnosis. The primary focus of these platforms is towards detection of low
copy numbers of nucleic acids from body fluids of patients where signal amplification
through collateral activity of fluorescent reporters has been proven to be
advantageous. For genotyping individuals with high confidence, including careers of
a single nucleotide variant (SNV), Cas12 requires individual sgRNA design and
optimization for every variant and Cas13 requires conversion to an RNA template
prior to detection, both of which increases the complexity and thus the time taken for
diagnosis. Taken together, development of a detection pipeline based on a highly
specific CRISPR protein with a direct binding or cleavage based readout can
significantly increase the sensitivity of detection and reduce the time and cost of
CRISPR based diagnostics (CRISPRDx), This is especially crucial for point-of-care
(POC) applications where complex experimentation or setup of reaction components
are not feasible.

We have recently reported a Cas9 ortholog from Francisella novicida (FnCas9)
showing very high mismatch sensitivity both under in vitro and in vivo conditions16-18.
This is based on its negligible binding affinity to substrates that harbor mismatches, a
property that is distinct from engineered Cas proteins showing similar high
specificity19. We reasoned that FnCas9 mediated DNA interrogation and subsequent
cleavage can both be adapted for accurately identifying any SNVs provided that the
fundamental mechanism of discrimination is consistent across all sequences (Figure
1A). We name this approach FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay
(FELUDA) and demonstrate its utility in various pathological conditions including
genetic disorders and infectious diseases including disease outbreaks like COVID1920-22.
To identify a SNV with high accuracy, we first sought to investigate if FnCas9 can be
directed to cleave the wild type (WT) variant at a SNV by placing an additional
mismatch in the sgRNA sequence specific to the SNV. To test this, we selected
sickle cell anemia (SCA), a global autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by
one point mutation (GAG>GTG)23-24. We identified an sgRNA that can recognize the
main disease causing point mutation (GAG > GTG) on account of a PAM site in the
vicinity (Figure 1B). We then fixed the position of this mutation with respect to PAM
and changed every other base in the sgRNA sequence to identify which combination
led to complete loss of cleavage of a wild type substrate in an in vitro cleavage (IVC)
assay with FnCas9 (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1A). We found that two
mismatches at the 2nd and 6th positions away from the PAM completely abrogated
the cleavage of the target (Figure 1B). Similarly other combinations (2 and 7, 2 and
8, 2 and 9, and 2 and 12, numbers referring to positions away from PAM) also
abolished the cleavage, although to slightly lower levels (Figure 1B). Notably, on the
SCA substrate, the 2 and 6 mismatch combination produced near complete cleavage
suggesting that this combination may be favorable for discriminating between WT
and SCA substrates (Figure 1B).
Importantly, the same design principle can guide the allelic discrimination at every
SNV that appears in these positions upstream of the trinucleotide NGG PAM in DNA.
We performed FELUDA with 4 synthetic sequences corresponding to SNVs reported
for the Mendelian disorders like Glanzman’s Thrombasthenia, Hemophilia A (Factor
VIII deficiency), Glycogen Storage Disease Type I and X linked myotubular
myopathy and observed an identical pattern of successful discrimination at the SNVs

(Supplementary Figure 1B). Taken together, these experiments suggest that
FELUDA design can be universally used for detection of SNVs and and would not
require extensive optimization or validation steps for new SNVs. To aid users for
quick design and implementation of FELUDA for a target SNV, we have developed a
webtool JATAYU (Junction for Analysis and Target Design for Your FELUDA assay)
that incorporates the above features and generates primer sequences for amplicon
and sgRNA synthesis (https:// jatayu.igib.res.in, Supplementary Figure 2).
We next tested FELUDA in DNA from 6 SCA patients and a healthy control and
found that in every case, the SC mutation containing substrates were cleaved to give
a distinguishable signature while the WT substrate remained intact (Supplementary
Figure 3A). To establish that enzyme specificity for position-specific mismatches with
respect to PAM site is the fundamental reason for this discrimination, we designed
the mismatch combinations such that cleavage will occur only for the WT substrate
and observed identical results thus confirming our hypothesis (Supplementary Figure
3B). Notably, a simple agarose gel electrophoresis can be employed for this
discrimination suggesting that FELUDA can be used in routine molecular biology
labs to establish the presence of an SNV in a DNA sequence.
In recent times fluorescence based nucleic acid detection has been widely used for
several CRISPRDx platforms, particularly where collateral cleavage of reporters has
been employed. Although FELUDA results can be precisely determined by agarose
or capillary electrophoresis, we envisioned fluorescence or chemiluminescence as
alternate end-point readouts to expand the scope of devices that can suit FELUDA
based detection. To implement this, we first investigated if FELUDA can be adapted
to a non-cleavage, affinity-based method of detection which works with single
nucleotide mismatch sensitivity.
To develop such a readout, we tested FELUDA with a catalytically dead FnCas9
(dFnCas9) tagged with a fluorophore (GFP) and investigated if its mismatch
discrimination is regulated at the level of DNA binding (Supplementary Figure 1A).
We performed microscale thermophoresis (MST) assays to measure the binding
affinity of inactive FnCas9-GFP RNP complex with WT or SCA substrates. We
observed that the SCA substrate showed moderately strong binding (Kd = 187.2 ±
3.4 nM) whereas the WT substrate exhibited very weak binding (Kd = 1037.4 nM ±
93.3 nM) consistent with the absence of cleavage on the IVC readout (Figure 2A).
We then developed a pipeline to adapt FELUDA for an affinity-based fluorescent

read-out system, where the amplification step generates biotinylated products which
can then be immobilized on magnetic streptavidin beads. Upon incubation with
fluorescent components in FELUDA, the absence or presence of a mismatch guides
the binding of FnCas9 molecules to the substrate leading to loss of fluorescence
signal in the supernatant (Figure 2B). We tested FELUDA using WT or SCA
substrates and observed distinct signatures that distinguished between the two
alleles suggesting that FELUDA can be adapted for a fluorescence-based readout
(Figure 2B).
Next, we investigated if FELUDA detection can be extended to a quick point of care
diagnosis of SNVs using lateral flow strips for instrument-free visual detection.
Although such read-outs have been demonstrated with CRISPR effectors that have
collateral activity, they rely on a secondary signal amplification step where
fluorescent oligos are added to the reaction setup. We designed an assay using
FAM labelled RNP complex and biotin labelled amplicons on commercially available
paper strips. In such a reaction, RNP-bound substrate molecules in a solution can
lead to aggregation of the complex on a distinct test line of the strip while anti-FAM
antibody linked gold nanoparticles accumulate on a control line on the strip (Figure
2C). To enable FAM labelling of sgRNA, we first validated the successful activity of
chimeric FnCas9 sgRNAs by altering the length of overlap between crRNA:tracrRNA
and observed that 19nt overlap can efficiently cleave the target (Figure 2D). Since a
single FAM labelled tracrRNA is compatible with multiple crRNAs, this design also
reduces the time and cost of a FELUDA assay. Next, we performed this assay with
the HBB target and were able to detect up to femtomolar levels of target DNA in a
solution suggesting that even without signal amplification, FELUDA reaches
sensitivity similar to that reported for CRISPRDx platforms employing collateral
activity (Figure 2E). Finally, we tested FELUDA using WT and SCA samples and
obtained clear distinguishing bands for either condition validating the feasibility of
visual detection for FELUDA diagnostics with complete accuracy (Figure 2F).
Genotyping carrier individuals with heterozygosity though non-sequencing PCR
based methods is often complicated and requires extensive optimization of primer
concentration and assay conditions. Although sickle cell trait (SCT) individuals are
generally non-symptomatic, carrier screening is vital to prevent the spread of SCA in
successive generations and is widely employed in SCA control programs in various
parts of the world19. We speculated that the high specificity of FELUDA can be

extended to identifying carriers since FnCas9 would cleave 50% of the DNA copies
carrying SCA mutation and thus show an intermediate cleavage pattern (Figure 3A.)
We also investigated the use of saliva instead of blood as a non-invasive source of
genomic DNA that would allow genotyping children and aged subjects where
drawing blood may not be feasible. We obtained a clear, distinguishable signature of
DNA cleavage in an SCT subject that was intermediate between normal or SCA
individuals suggesting that FELUDA can be successfully used for determining
zygosity at a specific SNV (Figure 3A). Although this reinforced the inherent
sensitivity of FELUDA for genotyping targets with 1bp mismatches, obtaining the
three distinct readouts would necessitate significantly robust reaction components
and high reproducibility across multiple subjects. We performed a blinded
experiment using DNA obtained from 49 subjects with all three genotypes from a
Tertiary care center. Remarkably, the FELUDA results perfectly matched with the
sequencing data from the same samples performed in a different laboratory (CSIR
Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Chandak Lab) and thus identified all three
genotypes with 100% accuracy (Figure 3B).
Although several pathogenic SNVs are located close to a NGG PAM and can be
accurately targeted by FELUDA, these form only a small subset of the total number
of disease-causing SNVs catalogued in ClinVar database (Supplementary Figure
4)25. To detect the non-PAM proximal SNVs we designed an in-built PAM site in the
amplification step of FELUDA. We tested this approach using 2 SNVs (A2142G and
A2143G) present in Helicobacter pylori 23s rRNA gene and which do not have a
NGG PAM in the vicinity. These SNVS confer variable clarithromycin resistance in
patients with gastric ulcers and clinically pose a serious concern for physicians26. We
validated that PAM-mer based amplification can be successfully used for FnCas9
based IVC by targeting synthetic DNA sequence containing the H. pylori 23s rRNA
gene (Figure 3C). We then isolated bacteria DNA from patient gut biopsy samples
and successfully distinguished the antibiotic resistance genotype from another
closely matched synthetic wild type sequence (Figure 3C). Importantly, this
procedure takes a few hours from obtaining sample to diagnosing the variant, a
significant improvement over existing regimens which rely on antimicrobial
susceptibility tests that can take several days to complete27.
Since our design incorporates the need for fixing the SNV at either 2nd or 6th position
proximal to PAM, this limits the possibility of discriminating substrates using a single

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.028167; this version posted April 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

FELUDA reaction. To overcome this, we explored single mismatches in the sgRNA
sequence that might lead to abrogation of cleavage or binding from the substrate
particularly at positions 16-19 at PAM distal end, since these showed minimum
cleavage from our previous study. Remarkably, we found that FnCas9 shows
negligible cleavage

at each of these positions (Supplementary Figure 5A). In

particular, mismatch at PAM distal 16th base shows complete absence of cleavage
and negligible binding affinity to mismatched substrate (Figure 3D). To confirm this
strategy, we targeted the SNV rs713598 which is associated with either G or C or
G/C (heterozygous) variants in different individuals28. Using our single base pair
mismatch approach we could successfully distinguish individuals with each of these
genotypes (Supplementary Figure 5B).
FELUDA detection can be customized with other features of current CRISPRDx
methods such as detecting SNVs in RNA or compatibility with isothermal
amplification of substrate29. At the level of RNA, by appending a Reverse
Transcription (RT) step prior to amplification, we could successfully distinguish two
Dengue virus serotypes (West Pac/74 and P23085, designated 1 and 2) that lead to
variable mortality rates in patients (Supplementary Figure 6)30,31. To circumvent the
need of complex instrumentation for preamplification, we optimized Recombinase
Polymerase Amplification (RPA) for generating amplicons that can contribute to a
field deployable assay prototype (Supplementary Figure 7A-B)32. Importantly,
FELUDA detection can occur in a wide temperature range (10 oC – 50 oC) and up to
3 days post thawing (at room temperature) suggesting that field studies using
FELUDA can be conducted in diverse climatic conditions and reaction components
can be successfully used following cold chain transportation (Supplementary Figure
8A-B).
During the preparation of this manuscript, a sudden outbreak of Corona virus
disease 19 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection broke out and has led to
an ongoing public health emergency in most countries of the world. In addition to
general social distancing, identification of infected individuals and screening their
contacts for possible quarantine measures is one of the major steps in reducing
community transmission of the virus33. It is postulated that rapid and accurate testing
protocols can significantly aid in this process34. We explored FELUDA as a simple
alternative to quantitative PCR based detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus since it does
not need complex instrumentation (Figure 4A). We designed sgRNAs targeting PAM

containing conserved regions (NSP8 and Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) across all
strains in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome (229 sequences deposited till 30th March
2020) and sgRNAs targeting conserved regions across the Influenza virus H1N1
genome (45 complete genome sets deposited till 15th March 2020) since both
infections have overlapping symptoms. Additionally, we selected human ACTB as a
positive control for human DNA traces that typically accompany the viral DNA
extracted from nasal or buccal swabs. Using FELUDA, we obtained clear signatures
of SARS-CoV-2 sequence in synthetic DNA using a specific RNP that is
distinguishable from non-specific RNP (such as H1N1 or HBB ) (Figure 4B).
Importantly FELUDA was also able to distinguish between two SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1 sequences that differ by a single nucleotide (Supplementary Figure
9A)35. Remarkably, FELUDA based lateral flow assay could distinguish SARS-CoV-2
synthetic DNA on a paper strip only when SARS-CoV-2 specific RNP was used to
interrogate the substrate (Figure 4C). Finally, we confirmed the applicability of such
lateral flow device as a rapid, cost effective and machine-independent alternative to
current testing protocols by successfully detecting the presence of viral signature
from low amounts of total RNA obtained from COVID-19 patients within one hour
(Figure 4D, Supplementary Figure 9B). We have compiled a standardized protocol
for performing this test on clinical samples (Supplementary Note 1).
In this report, we present the versatile applications of FELUDA for rapid and accurate
detection of nucleic acids at a low cost (Supplementary Figure 9C-D). Leveraging the
highly specific binding and subsequent cleavage properties of FnCas9 as distinct
enzymatic steps, FELUDA couples sensitivity with broad spectrum of read-out
possibilities that can be carried out in the lab or in the field. Detection of low copy
numbers of nucleic acids usually involves signal amplification through collateral
cleavage of reporter molecules on other CRISPRDx platforms but FELUDA is highly
accurate in diagnosing SNVs without them. Its strength lies in unbiased identification
of nucleobases and their variants. The affinity based FELUDA assays can be used
for designing panels of mutation-scanning sgRNAs on a microchip that can give rise
to rapid readouts from patient samples for multiple targets simultaneously
(Supplementary Figure 10A). The combination of single mismatch sensitivity and the
possibility of tagging different fluorophores to the RNP can allow identifying each of
the 4 nucleobases in a target at a given position. This can potentially expand the
applications of CRISPR in the domain of affinity based target sequencing

(Supplementary Figure 10B). Its ease of design and implementation, as exemplified
by its urgent deployment during the COVID-19 health crisis offers immense
possibilities for rapid and wide-spread testing that has so far proven to be successful
in spreading the progression of the disease in multiple countries.

buffer (100mM NaCl, 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1mM MgCl2), mix was heated at
95C for 2-5 minutes and then allowed to cool at room temperature for 15-20
minutes. Chimeric gRNA-dead FnCas9 RNP complex (500nM) was prepared by
mixing them in a buffer (20mM HEPES, pH7.5, 150mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 10%
glycerol, 10mM MgCl2) and incubated for 10 min at RT. RPA or PCR amplified
biotinylated amplicons were then incubated with the RNP complexes for 15 minutes
at 37°C. Dipstick buffer was added along with the Milenia Hybridetect paper strip
(TwistDx) was added as per instructions, producing dark colored bands over the strip
within 2-10 min.
FnCas9 activity in a temperature range:
FnCas9-sgRNA complex (500nM) was prepared by mixing them in a buffer (20mM
HEPES, pH7.5, 150mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 10mM MgCl2) and incubated
for 10 min at RT. The reconstituted RNP complexes along with PCR amplified DNA
amplicons were then used for IVC assays at different temperatures ranging from
10°C to 50°C for 30 minutes. The reaction was inhibited using 1µl of Proteinase K
(Ambion). After removing residual RNA by RNase A (Purelink), the cleaved products
were visualized on agarose gel.
Stability of the FnCas9 protein:
FnCas9-sgRNA complex (500nM) was prepared by mixing them in a buffer (20mM
HEPES, pH7.5, 150mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 10mM MgCl2) and incubated
for 10 min at RT. Linearized plasmid used here as a substrate was incubated with
reconstituted RNP complexes at different time points starting from 0 h to 100 h with
or without 10% sucrose in the reaction buffer respectively. Further, cleaved products
were visualized on agarose gel.

MST Method:
For the binding experiment, dFnCas9-GFP protein was used along with PAGE
purified respective IVT sgRNAs. Notably, IVT sgRNAs were purified by 12% UreaPAGE. The binding affinities of the dFnCas9 protein and sgRNA (ribonucleoprotein)
complexes with targets were calculated using Monolith NT. 115 (NanoTemper
Technologies GmbH, Munich, Germany). RNP complex (Protein:sgRNA molar
ratio,1:1) was formed at 25 oC for 10 mins in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH7.5,

150mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 10mM MgCl2). For the target DNA constitution, duplex was
formed using HPLC purified 30bp ssDNA oligo (Sigma) by annealing for 5 mins at 95
o

C and then by slowly cooling down at 25 oC. 30 bp dsDNA of different genomic

targets with varying concentrations (ranging from 0.7nM to 25μM) were incubated
with RNP complex at 370 C for 60 min in reaction buffer. NanoTemper standard
treated capillaries were used for loading the sample. Measurements were performed
at 25°C using 40% LED power in blue filter (465-490nm excitation wavelength; 500550nm emission wavelength) and 40% MST power. All experiments were repeated
at least three times for each measurement. All Data analyses were done using
NanoTemper analysis software. The graphs were plotted using OriginPro 8.5
software.

Sanger Sequencing:
The sequencing reaction was carried out using Big dye Terminator v3.1 cycle
sequencing kit (ABI, 4337454) in 10μl volume (containing 0.5μl purified DNA, 0.8μl
sequencing reaction mix, 2μl 5X dilution buffer and 0.6μl forward/ reverse primer)
with the following cycling conditions - 3 mins at 95°C, 40 cycles of (10 sec at 95°C,
10 sec at 55°C, 4 mins at 60°C) and 10 mins at 4°C. Subsequently, the PCR product
was purified by mixing with 12μl of 125mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and incubating at RT for 5
mins. 50μl of absolute ethanol and 2μl of 3M NaOAc (pH 4.8) were then added,
incubated at RT for 10 mins and centrifuged at 3800rpm for 30 mins, followed by
invert spin at <300rpm to discard the supernatant. The pellet was washed twice with
100μl of 70% ethanol at 4000rpm for 15 mins and supernatant was discarded by
invert spin. The pellet was air dried, dissolved in 12μl of Hi-Di formamide (Thermo
fisher, 4311320), denatured at 95°C for 5 mins followed by snapchill, and linked to
ABI 3130xl sequencer. Base calling was carried out using sequencing analysis
software (v5.3.1) (ABI, US) and sequence was analyzed using Chromas v2.6.5
(Technelysium, Australia).
Disease selection from ClinVar Database:
ClinVar dataset (version: 20180930) was used to extract disease variation spectrum
that can be targeted by FELUDA25,36. Only Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were
analyzed. Further, SNVs which are situated 2 bp upstream of the PAM sequence

were extracted. Next, SNVs with Pathogenic effects and valid OMIM ID were used
for further analysis. Finally, variations with higher frequency in Indian Population
were selected for the validation. Custom python script was used for the whole
process.

sgRNA design for CoV-2, CoV-1 and H1N1:
To differentiate between CoV-2 (MN908947.3) and CoV-1 (NC_004718.3)
sequences37-38 the FELUDA pipeline with 16th base (PAM distal) mismatch was
followed. Overall, 5 sgRNAs were extracted which show different single nucleotide
variation between CoV-2 and CoV-1. To find out sgRNAs specific to strain/region,
229 sequences (Gene sequence and full genome) of CoV-2 were extracted and
custom python script and SeqMap were used to design strain specific sgRNAs. For
H1N1, Influenza Virus Databases were used39. Sequences of virus with human host
and Indian region were extracted. Overall, 45 genomes set with 360 sequences were
downloaded. Next, the common sgRNA among all the sequences were fetched using
custom python script and SeqMap40.
JATAYU:
JATAYU (jatayu.igib.res.in) is a web tool which enables users to design sgRNAs and
primer for the detection of variations. Users need to provide a valid genomic
sequence with position and type of variation. JATAYU front-end has been created
using Bootstrap 4 and jQuery. In the back-end, python-based Flask framework has
been used with genome analysis tools BWA (Burrows-Wheeler aligner) and
bedtools41-42.
All oligos used in the study are listed in Table 1.

target (ACTB) from up to 50 pg of starting RNA. C, FELUDA reaction for CoV-2
detection can be done within 1h (45 min with one-step RT-PCR or 32 min with RTRPA reaction). D, Cost for a single FELUDA assay for CoV-2 detection is less than 6
USD.
Supplementary Figure 10: Applications of FELUDA beyond in vitro diagnosis.
A, A microchip containing immobilized FELUDA RNPs, each specific to an SNV can
capture only desired substrates producing distinct signal patterns. This will allow
multiplexed detection of SNVs from a sample. B, By using 4 different fluorescently
tagged RNPs and coupling them with sgRNAs containing single mismatches, the
identity of a nucleobase at a given position on a DNA sequence can be determined.
Only one fluorescent RNP will bind to the target while the other RNPs will dissociate.
The process can be iteratively performed to identify each nucleobase in a sequence.
