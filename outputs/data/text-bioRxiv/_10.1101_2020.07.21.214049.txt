Summary

27

To develop a vaccine candidate against COVID-19, we generated a Lentiviral Vector (LV), eliciting

28

neutralizing antibodies against the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Systemic vaccination by this

29

vector in mice, in which the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor hACE2 has been induced by

30

transduction of respiratory tract cells by an adenoviral vector, conferred only partial protection, despite

31

an intense serum neutralizing activity. However, targeting the immune response to the respiratory tract

32

through an intranasal boost with this LV resulted in > 3 log10 decrease in the lung viral loads and

33

avoided local inflammation. Moreover, both integrative and non-integrative LV platforms displayed a

34

strong vaccine efficacy and inhibited lung deleterious injury in golden hamsters, which are naturally

35

permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and restitute the human COVID-19 physiopathology. Our

36

results provide evidence of marked prophylactic effects of the LV-based vaccination against SARS-

37

CoV-2 and designate the intranasal immunization as a powerful approach against COVID-19.

Introduction

51

The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome beta-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in

52

late 2019 in Wuhan, China, is extraordinarily contagious and fast-spreading across the world (Guo et

53

al., 2020). Compared to the previously emerged SARS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)

54

coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 causes unprecedented threat on global health and tremendous socio-

55

economic consequences. Therefore, the development of effective prophylactic vaccines against SARS-

56

CoV-2 is an absolute imperative to contain the spread of the epidemic and to prevent the development

57

of CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated symptoms such as deleterious inflammation and

58

progressive respiratory failure (Amanat and Krammer, 2020).

59

Coronaviruses are enveloped, non-segmented positive-stranded RNA viruses, characterized by their

60

envelope-anchored Spike (S) glycoprotein (Walls et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 S (SCoV-2) is a

61

(180  kDa)3 homotrimeric class I viral fusion protein, that engages the carboxypeptidase Angiotensin-

62

Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on host cells. The monomer of SCoV-2 protein possesses an

63

ectodomain, a transmembrane anchor domain, and a short internal tail. SCoV-2 is activated by a two-step

64

sequential proteolytic cleavage to initiate fusion with the host cell membrane. Subsequent to SCoV-2-

65

ACE2 interaction, through a conformational reorganization, the extracellular domain of SCoV-2 is first

66

cleaved at the highly specific furin 682RRAR685 site (Guo et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020), a key factor

67

determining the pathological features of the virus, linked to the furin ubiquitous expression (Wang et

68

al., 2020). The resulting subunits are: (i) S1, which harbors the ACE2 Receptor Binding Domain

69

(RBD), with the atomic contacts restricted to the ACE2 protease domain, and (ii) S2, which bears the

70

membrane-fusion elements. Similar to SCoV-1, the shedding of S1 renders accessible on S2 the second

71

proteolytic cleavage site 797R, namely S2' (Belouzard et al., 2009). Depending on the cell or tissue

72

type, one or several host proteases, including furin, trypsin, cathepsins or transmembrane protease

73

serine protease-2 or -4, can be involved in this second cleavage step (Coutard et al., 2020). The

74

consequent “fusogenic” conformational changes of S result in the exposure of a Fusion Peptide (FP),

75

adjacent to S2'. Insertion of FP to the host cell/vesicle membrane primes the fusion reaction, which in

76

turn leads to the viral RNA release into the host cytosol (Lai et al., 2017). The facts that the SCoV-2-

77

ACE2 interaction is the only mechanism thus far identified for the host cell infection by SARS-CoV-

78

2, and that the RBD contains numerous conformational B-cell epitopes (Walls et al., 2020), designate

79

this viral envelope glycoprotein as the main target for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).

80

Compared to: (i) attenuated or inactivated viral vaccine candidates which require extensive safety

81

testing, (ii) nucleic acid with moderate immunogenicity in human linked to the difficulty of their

82

delivery to targeted immune cells (Hobernik and Bros, 2018), (iii) protein vaccines which require the

83

use of adjuvants and boosting, viral vector vaccines such as adenoviral vectors are interesting vaccine

84

candidates that generate strong immune responses. However, adenoviral vectors are target of pre-

85

existing immunity in the human population, which largely reduces their immunogenicity (Rosenberg

86

et al., 1998; Schirmbeck et al., 2008). Non-replicative lentiviral vaccinal vectors (LV) possess a large

87

potential at eliciting strong and long-lasting adaptive immunity, including Ab responses (Di Nunzio et

88

al., 2012; Hu et al., 2011; Ku et al., 2020; Zennou et al., 2000). These vectors induce very minor

89

inflammation (Lopez et al., in preparation) and their safety has been demonstrated in human in a phase

90

1 HIV-1 vaccine trial (2011-006260-52 EN). In addition, LV are pseudo-typed with the envelope

91

glycoprotein of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV-G), to which human population is barely exposed.

92

This minimizes the risk of vaccine efficacy reduction linked to a pre-existing cross-reactive immunity

93

(Hu et al., 2011).

94

To develop a vaccine candidate able to induce NAbs specific to SCoV-2, we generated LV coding for:

95

(i) S1 alone (LV::S1), (ii) S1-S2 ectodomain, without the transmembrane and internal tail domains

96

(LV::S1-S2), or (iii) full-length, membrane anchored form of S (LV::SFL). We established that LV::SFL

97

gave rise to elevated amounts of NAbs, which inhibit ACE2+ host-cell invasion by SCoV-2-pseudo-typed

98

virions. Anti-SCoV-2 CD8+ T cell effectors were also efficiently induced in LV::SFL-immunized mice.

99

Moreover, in a mouse model in which the expression of human ACE2 (hACE2) was induced in the

100

respiratory tracts by instillation with an adenoviral vector serotype 5 (Ad5), as well as in SARS-CoV-

101

2-susceptible golden hamsters, we demonstrated a strong prophylactic effect of LV::SFL immunization

102

against the replication of a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate, accompanied by the reduction of infection-

103

related inflammation in the lungs. Importantly, boost/target immunization with LV::SFL via nasal route

104

was instrumental in the protection efficacy. Our virological, immunological and histopathological

105

criteria in two preclinical animal models provided the proof-of-principle evidence of marked

106

prophylactic effects of LV-based vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2, and requirement for mucosal

107

immunization to reach vigorous protective lung immunity against COVID-19.

Results

109

Induction of antibody responses by LV encoding SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants

110

To develop a vaccine candidate able to induce NAbs against SCoV-2, we generated LV harboring,

111

under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter, codon-

112

optimized sequences encoding for: (i) S1 alone (LV::S1), (ii) S1-S2 ectodomain, without the

113

transmembrane and C-terminal short internal tail (LV::S1-S2), and (iii) full-length, membrane

114

anchored form of S (LV::SFL), which all harbor the RBD (Figure 1A, Figure S1), albeit with potential

115

conformational heterogeneities (Yuan et al., 2020). To evaluate the humoral responses induced by these

116

vectors, C57BL/6 mice (n = 4/group) were immunized by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 1

117

× 107 Transduction Units (TU) of either LV, or an LV encoding GFP as negative control. Anti-SCoV-2

118

Ab responses were investigated in the sera at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 post immunization (Figure 1B). In

119

LV::SFL or LV::S1-S2-immunized mice, anti-SCoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) were detectable as early

120

as 1 week post immunization and increased progressively until week 6 post immunization, achieving

121

mean titer (1/dilution) ± SEM of (4.5 ± 2.9) × 106 or (1.5 ± 1) × 106, respectively. In comparison, anti-

122

SCoV-2 IgG titers were 2 orders of magnitude lower, i.e., (7.1 ± 6.1) ×104, in their LV::S1-immunized

123

counterparts.

124

Sera were then evaluated for their capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, using a reliable

125

neutralization assay based on NAb-mediated inhibition of hACE2+ cell invasion by non-replicative LV

126

particle surrogates, pseudo-typed with SCoV-2 (Sterlin et al., 2020). Such SCoV-2 pseudo-typed LV

127

particles, harbor a luciferase reporter gene, which allows quantitation of the hACE2+ host cell invasion.

128

In this assay, the luciferase activity is inversely proportional to the neutralization efficiency of NAbs

129

present in biological fluids. Fine comparison, by 50% Effective Concentrations (EC50) assays of the

130

sera from the LV::S1-, LV::S1-S2- or LV::SFL-immunized mice clearly established that LV::SFL was

131

the most potent vector at inducing anti-SCoV-2 NAbs (Figure 1C). Moreover, neutralization activities

132

were correlated with anti-SCoV-2 IgG titers only in the sera of LV::SFL-immunized mice (Figure 1D).

133

These results suggest that in the S1-S2 or S1 polypeptides, the conformations of relevant B-cell

134

epitopes are distinct from those of the native SFL and that the blocking action of NAbs is linked to their

135

specific recognition of the native conformational epitopes. Comparison of the sera from the LV::SFL-

136

immunized mice and a cohort of mildly symptomatic infected individuals living in Crépy-en-Valois,

137

one of the first epidemic zones to appear in France, revealed similar mean neutralizing activities (Figure

138

1E). These data predict a potentially protective humoral response induced by LV::SFL.

139

LV::SFL-immunized C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) also displayed strong anti-SCoV-2 T-cell responses, as

140

detected at week 2 post immunization by IFNg ELISPOT-based epitope mapping, applied to

141

splenocytes stimulated with distinct pools of 15-mer peptides spanning the full-length SCoV-2 (Figure

142

2A). Significant amounts of responding T cells were detected for 6 out of 16 peptide pools.

Establishment of a murine model expressing hACE2 in the respiratory tracts

153

As SCoV-2 does not interact well with murine ACE2, wild-type laboratory mice are not permissive to

154

replication of SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates. Therefore, we sought to develop a murine model in which

155

human ACE2 (hACE2) expression was induced in the respiratory tracts and pulmonary mucosa to

156

evaluate the LV::SFL vaccine efficacy. This method has been successfully used to establish the

157

expression of human DPP4 for the study of mouse infection with MERS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2014) and

158

also for hACE2 during the preparation of this manuscript (Sun et al., 2020). We generated an Ad5

159

vector to deliver the gene encoding for hACE2 under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter

160

(Ad5::hACE2) in an episomal form. We first checked in vitro the potential of the Ad5::hACE2 vector

161

to transduce HEK293T cells by Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR (Figure 3A). To achieve in vivo

162

transduction of respiratory tract cells, we instilled intranasally (i.n.) 2.5 × 109 Infectious Genome Units

163

(IGU) of Ad5::hACE2 into C57BL/6 mice. Four days later, the hACE2 protein expression was

164

detectable in the lung cell homogenate by Western Blot (Figure 3B). To get more insights into the in

165

vivo expression profile of a transgene administered under these conditions, we instilled i.n. the same

166

dose of an Ad5::GFP reporter vector into C57BL/6 mice. As evaluated by flow cytometry, 4 days post

167

instillation, the GFP reporter was expressed not only in the lung epithelial EpCam+ cells, but also in

168

lung immune cells, as tracked by the CD45 pan-hematopoietic marker (Figure 3C), showing that

169

through this approach the transduction was efficiently achieved in epithelial cells, although not

170

restricted to these cells.

171

To evaluate the permissibility of such hACE2-transduced mice to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4 days

172

after i.n. pretreatment with either Ad5::hACE2 or an empty Ad5 control vector, C57BL/6 mice were

173

inoculated i.n. with 1 × 105 TCID50 (Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose) of a SARS-CoV-2 clinical

174

isolate (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020), which was isolated in January 2020 from a COVID-19

175

patient by the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France)

176

(Lescure et al., 2020). The lung viral loads, determined at 2 days post inoculation (dpi) by reverse

177

transcription and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), were as high as (4.4 ± 1.8) × 109 copies of

178

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Ad5::hACE2-pretreated mice, compared to only (6.2 ± 0.5) × 105 copies in

179

empty Ad5-pretreated mice, or (4.0 ± 2.9) × 105 copies in un-pretreated mice (Figure 3D). In the latter

180

two control groups, these copy numbers corresponded to the input viral RNA, as determined in

181

Ad5::hACE2-pretreated mice, inoculated with equivalent amounts of heat-killed viral particles (Figure

182

3D). At 4 dpi, the lung viral loads were maintained in Ad5::hACE2-pretreated mice (2.8 ± 1.3 × 109

183

copies), whereas a drop to (1.7 ± 2.3) × 104 or (3.9 ± 5.1) × 103 copies was observed in empty Ad5-

184

pretreated or non-pretreated mice, respectively. In Ad5::hACE2-pretreated mice, the viral loads were

185

still detectable at 7 dpi ((1.33 ± 0.9) × 106 copies).

186

Ad5::hACE-2 i.n. instillation induced CD45+ cell recruitment to the lungs (Figure 3E). However,

187

no pro-inflammatory effect was seen with a lower dose of 4 x 108 IGU/mouse (Figure 3E), which still

188

conferred full permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 3F), and this dose was therefore

189

chosen for the subsequent experiments described below. In this model of permissive mice, SARS-CoV-

190

2 infection resulted in widespread infiltration of the lung interstitium by mononuclear inflammatory

191

cells, i.e., lymphocytes and macrophages, at 3 dpi (Figure S2).

192

These results show that pretreatment of mice with appropriate doses of Ad5::hACE2 can render

193

mice permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication without inducing Ad5-mediated inflammation, thus

194

providing a valuable model for vaccine or drug studies.

195

Intranasal boost with LV::SFL protects strongly against SARS-CoV-2 in mice

196

To investigate the prophylactic potential of LV::SFL against SARS-CoV-2, C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-

197

5/group) were injected i.p. with a single dose of 1 × 107 TU of LV::SFL or a negative control LV (sham).

198

At week 7 post immunization, mice were pretreated with Ad5::hACE2, and 4 days later, inoculated i.n.

199

with 1 × 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S3A). At 3 dpi, the lung viral loads in LV::SFL-vaccinated

200

mice were reduced by ~ 6.5 folds, i.e., mean ± SD of (5.5 ± 3.8) × 108 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies

201

compared to (3.1 ± 1.9) × 109 or (4.3 ± 3.0) × 109 copies in the un- or sham-vaccinated mice,

202

respectively (Figure S3B). Therefore, a single i.p. LV::SFL injection provided partial protection in the

203

lung, despite intense serum NAb activity.

204

To further improve the prophylactic effect, we evaluated the prime-boost or prime-target

205

approaches. C57BL/6 mice (n = 4-5/group) were primed i.p. with 1 × 107 TU of LV::SFL or a control

206

LV at week 0, and then boosted at week 3 with: (i) 1 × 107 TU of the same LV via the i.p. route

207

(“LV::SFL i.p.-i.p.”, prime-boost), or (ii) with 3 × 107 TU via the i.n. route (“LV::SFL i.p.-i.n.”, prime-

208

target) to attract the mediators of systemic immunity to the lung mucosa (Figure 4A). Systemic

209

boosting with LV::SFL via i.p. resulted in a significant increase in the anti-SCoV-2 IgG titers, which was

210

more obvious when the binding was evaluated against the foldon-trimerized full-length S (Figure 4B,

211

left) than against the S1 or RBD fragments (Figure S4A). This observation may suggest that the

212

concerned B-cell epitopes are of conformational type. In contrast, mucosal targeting with LV::SFL via
7

213

i.n. did not lead to a statistically significant improvement of anti-SCoV-2 IgG titers at the systemic level

214

(Figure 4B left, Figure S4A). In terms of serum neutralization potential, even though a trend to increase

215

was observed after i.p. or i.n. boost, the differences did not reach statistical significance (Figure 4B

216

right).

217

All mice were then pretreated with Ad5::hACE2 and challenged i.n. with 0.3 × 105 TCID50 of

218

SARS-CoV-2 at week 4 post prime. At 3 dpi, the lung viral loads were significantly lower in LV::SFL

219

i.p.-i.p. immunized mice, i.e., mean ± SD (2.3 ± 3.2) × 108, than in sham-vaccinated mice (13.7 ± 7.5)

220

× 108 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, (Figure 4C). This viral load reduction was similar to that obtained

221

with a single LV::SFL administration (Figure S3B). Most importantly, after i.n. LV::SFL target

222

immunization, > 3 log10 decrease in viral loads was observed and 2 out of 5 mice harbored undetectable

223

lung viral loads as determined by qRT-PCR assay. Anti-SCoV-2 IgG were detected in the clarified lung

224

homogenates of the partially (LV::SFL i.p.-i.p.) or the fully (LV::SFL i.p.-i.n.) protected mice. In contrast

225

anti-SCoV-2 IgA were only detectable in the fully protected LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. mice (Figure 4D). Higher

226

neutralizing activity was detected in the clarified lung homogenates of LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. mice than of

227

their LV::SFL i.p.-i.p. counterparts (Figure 4E). Therefore, increasing the titers of NAb of IgG isotype

228

at the systemic levels did not improve the protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, a mucosal i.n.

229

target immunization, with the potential to attract immune effectors to the infection site and able to

230

induce local IgA Abs, correlated with the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

231

Because of the importance of innate immune hyperactivity in the pathophysiology of COVID-19

232

(Vabret et al., 2020), we investigated the lung innate immune cell subsets in the non-infected controls,

233

sham-vaccinated or LV::SFL-vaccinated mice inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5A). At 3 dpi, we

234

detected no difference in the proportions of basophils or NK cells versus total lung CD45+ cells among

235

the experimental groups (Figure 5B). In sharp contrast, we detected higher proportions of alveolar

236

macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, Ly6C+ or Ly6C- monocytes/macrophages or neutrophils

237

versus total lung CD45+ cells, in sham-vaccinated mice. These observations demonstrate that in this

238

mouse model, lung SARS-CoV-2 loads correlate with the expansion of several inflammation-related

239

innate immune cell subsets, while vaccine-mediated protection dampens or prevents the inflammatory

240

reaction.

241

This was corroborated by the reduced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine contents in the RNA

242

extracted from total lung homogenates of mice immunized with “LV::SFL i.p.-i.n.” (Figure 5C, Figure

243

S5A) or “LV::SFL i.p.-i.p.” (Figure S5B) and protected against SARS-CoV-2. Significant reductions

244

248

vaccinated and challenged mice (Figure S5B). The expression of the other mediators tested was not

249

significantly changed (Figure S5A, C). Therefore, the conferred protection also avoided pulmonary

250

inflammation mediated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, as demonstrated by cytometric or qRT-PCR

251

approaches.

Intranasal vaccination with LV::SFL strongly protects against SARS-CoV-2 in golden
hamsters

254

Outbred Mesocricetus auratus, so-called golden hamsters, provide a suitable pre-clinical model to

255

study the COVID-19 pathology, since the ACE2 ortholog of this species interacts productively with

256

SCoV-2, supporting host cell invasion and viral replication (Sia et al., 2020). We thus investigated in this

257

model the protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection of vaccination by LV::SFL and by an

258

integrase deficient, non-integrative version of this vector (NILV), with the prospect of application in

259

future clinical trials.

260

To assess the prophylactic effect of vaccination following prime-boost/target regimen, M. auratus

261

hamsters (n = 6/group) were: (i) primed i.p. with 1 × 106 TU of LV::SFL and boosted i.n. at week 5 with

262

4 × 107 TU of LV::SFL, (“int LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. Low”), (ii) primed i.p. with 1 × 107 TU of LV::SFL and

263

boosted i.n. at week 5 with 4 × 107 TU of LV::SFL (“int LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. High”), or (iii) primed

264

intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1 × 108 TU of NILV::SFL and boosted i.n. at week 5 with 1 × 108 TU of

265

NILV::SFL (“NILV::SFL i.m.-i.n.”) (Figure 6A). Sham-vaccinated controls received the same amounts

266

of an empty LV via i.p. and then i.n. routes. Strong and comparable anti-SCoV-2 IgG Abs were detected

267

by ELISA in the sera of hamsters from the three vaccinated groups, before and after the i.n. boost

268

(Figure 6B). Post boost/target serology detected neutralization activity in all groups, with the highest

269

EC50 average observed in “int LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. High” individuals. Such levels were comparable to

270

those detected in COVID-19 cases or healthy contacts in humans (Figure 6C). All hamsters were

271

challenged i.n. with 0.3 × 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 at week 5. Up to 16% weight loss was

272

progressively reached at 4 dpi in sham-vaccinated individuals, compared to a non-significant loss in

273

the LV::SFL-vaccinated groups (Figure 6D). As assessed by qRT-PCR, at 2 dpi, decreases of ~ 1.2-to-

274

2 log10 were observed in the lung viral loads of “int LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. Low”, “int LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. High”

275

and “NILV::SFL i.m.-i.n.” groups, compared to sham-vaccinated hamsters (Figure 6E). At 4 dpi, the

276

magnitude of viral load reductions in the vaccinated groups were much more important and reached

277

>3 log10, compared to the sham-vaccinated individuals. Using the Plaque Forming Unit (PFU) assay,

278

at 2 and 4 dpi, we detected (6.56 ± 1.88) and (2.94 ± 3.16) × 106 PFU/lung of sham-vaccinated controls.

279

At 2 dpi, the decrease in the viral loads were largely statistically significant in all of the LV::SFL-

280

vaccinated hamsters and at 4 dpi, with the exception of one “NILV::SFL i.m.-i.n.” hamster, no

281

vaccinated individuals possessed detectable infectious viral particles (Figure 6F).

282

As evaluated by qRT-PCR in the total lung homogenates of the protected “int LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. Low”,

283

“int LV::SFL i.p.-i.n. High” and “NILV::SFL i.m.-i.n.” groups, substantial decreases were observed at 4

284

dpi in the expression of inflammatory IFN-g and IL-6 cytokines, anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine,

285

and CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL10 chemokines, compared to their unprotected sham-vaccinated

286

counterparts (Figure 7A). The other inflammatory mediators tested were not significantly modified

287

(Figure S6).

288

In sham-vaccinated and challenged hamsters, overall marked multifocal degenerative changes of

289

the bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium, moderate effacement of the epithelium, associated with mild to

290

moderate mixed inflammation in the airway lumen, and minimal multifocal interstitial mononuclear

291

cell inflammation at both time-points (Figure 7B). At 4 dpi, effacement of the respiratory epithelium

292

and mixed inflammation in the alveoli were more severe; moderate fibrin deposits were also noted. In

293

vaccinated hamsters, regardless of the regardless of the vaccine dose, lung lesions were clearly of lower

294

incidence and severity (Figure 7C). In these animals, only minimal to mild degenerative lesions and

295

minimal effacement of the bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium and occasionally mixed inflammation in

296

the airway lumen of alveoli and mononuclear infiltrates in the interstitium were observed. These

297

microscopic findings were similar after vaccination with the int LV or NILV.

298

Altogether, based on a complete set of virological, immunological and histopathological data, the

299

LV::SFL vector elicited anti-SCoV-2 NAbs and T-cell responses and provided robust protection against

300

SARS-CoV-2 infection in two pertinent animal models, and particularly when mucosal i.n.

301

administration was included in the vaccinal scheme.

Discussion

304

Prophylactic strategies are necessary to control SARS-CoV-2 infection which, 6 months into the

305

pandemic, still continues to spread exponentially without signs of slowing down. It is now

306

demonstrated that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques leads to protective

307

immunity against re-exposure (Chandrashekar et al., 2020). Numerous vaccine candidates, based on

308

naked DNA (Yu et al., 2020) or mRNA, recombinant protein, replicating or non-replicating viral

309

vectors, including adenoviral Ad5 vector (Zhu et al., 2020), or alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus (Gao

310

et al., 2020) are under active development for COVID-19 prevention. Our immunological rationale for

311

selecting LV to deliver gene encoding SCoV-2 antigen was based on its potential to induce in situ

312

expression of heterologous genes, and on the ability of this immunization platform to elicit sustained

313

humoral and cell-mediated responses. Unique to LV is the ability to transduce proliferating as well as

314

non-dividing cells such as dendritic cells (Esslinger et al., 2002; Firat et al., 2002; He et al., 2005),

315

thereby serving as a powerful vaccination strategy (Beignon et al., 2009; Buffa et al., 2006; Coutant et

316

al., 2012; Gallinaro et al., 2018; Iglesias et al., 2006) to provoke strong and long-lasting adaptive

317

responses (Cousin et al., 2019; Ku et al., in revision.). Notably, in net contrast to many other viral

318

vectors, LV do not suffer from pre-existing immunity in populations, due to their pseudo-typing with

319

the glycoprotein envelope from Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, to which humans are barely exposed. We

320

recently demonstrated that a single injection of an LV expressing Zika envelope provides a rapid and

321

durable sterilizing protection against Zika infection (Ku et al., 2020). Our recent comprehensive

322

comparison of LV to the gold standard Ad5 immunization vector also documented the superiority of

323

LV in inducing multifunctional and central memory T-cell responses in the mouse model, and its strong

324

immunogenicity in outbred rats (Ku et al., in revision.), underlining the suitability of LV for vaccinal

325

applications.

326

Because laboratory mice are not naturally susceptible permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we set

327

up an in vivo transduction murine model in which the hACE2 expression is induced in the respiratory

328

tracts by an i.n. Ad5::hACE2 pretreatment prior to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. Our system, very close

329

to a recently published protocol (Sun et al., 2020) confirmed that mice become largely permissive to

330

SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs and thus represent a model for assessment of vaccine or drug

331

efficacy against this virus. Even though the Ad5::hACE2 model may not fully mimic the physiological

332

ACE2 expression profile and thus may not reflect all the aspects of the pathophysiology of SARS-

333

CoV-2 infection, it provides a pertinent model to evaluate in vivo the effects of anti-viral drugs, vaccine

334

candidates, various mutations or genetic backgrounds on the SARS-CoV-2 replication. By using a low

335

dose of Ad5::hACE2, no CD45+ cell recruitments were detectable at day 4 post instillation, indicative

336

of an absence of Ad5-related inflammation before the inoculation of SARS-CoV-2.

337

We first evaluated the efficacy of several LV each encoding for one of the variants of S, i.e., the S1

338

domain alone (LV::S1), the S1-S2 ecto-domain, devoid of the transmembrane and C-terminal short

339

internal tail (LV::S1-S2), or full-length, membrane anchored protein (LV::SFL). Even though a single

340

administration of each of these LV was able to induce high anti-SCoV-2 Ab titers, only LV::SFL induced

341

highly functional Nabs with neutralizing activities similar to those found in a cohort of symptomatic

342

SARS-CoV-2 patients. This finding predicted a protective potential of the humoral responses induced

343

by the LV::SFL vector. In addition, strong anti-SCoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses were also observed in the

344

spleen of mice as early as 2 weeks after a single LV::SFL injection, as detected against numerous MHC-

345

I-restricted immunogenic regions that we identified in C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice.

346

In the transduced mouse model which allows high rates of SARS-CoV-2 replication, vaccination by

347

a single i.p. administration of 1 x 107 TU of LV::SFL, 6 weeks before virus inoculation, was sufficient

348

to inhibit the viral replication by ~ 6 folds. Further boosting via the systemic route did not afford

349

improved protection rate when compared to a single administration. However, systemic priming

350

followed by a mucosal boost inhibited efficiently viral replication and prevented lung inflammation.

351

This protection was correlated with high titers of anti-SCoV-2 IgG and IgA and a strong neutralization

352

activity in sera. Additional experiments in appropriate transgenic mice or adoptive immune cell transfer

353

approaches will be necessary to identify the immunological pathways that contribute to disease severity

354

or protection against SARS-CoV-2. NAbs and cell-mediated immunity, very efficaciously induced

355

with the LV-based vaccine candidate, may synergize to block infection and viral replication.

356

M. auratus golden hamsters are naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication and recapitulate

357

the human COVID-19 physiopathology (Sia et al., 2020). In hamsters immunized with the prime-target

358

regimen, either with integrative LV or NILV::SFL, we observed substantial degrees of protection

359

against SARS-CoV-2, as judged by: (i) the drastic reduction of the lung viral loads (determined by

360

qRT-PCR) or infectious particle clearance (determined by PFU assay), (ii) the significant reduction in

361

the expression of inflammatory mediators in the lung, and (iii) the efficient prevention of lung tissue

362

damage. Confirmation, in this highly sensitive species, of the protection results further supports the

363

LV::SFL vaccine, especially in its non-integrative form, as a candidate for future introduction into

364

clinical trials.

365

Ab-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of coronavirus entry to the host cells has been evoked as a

366

potential obstacle in vaccination against coronaviruses. With DNA (Yu et al., 2020) or inactivated

367

SARS-CoV-2 virus (Gao et al., 2020) vaccination in macaques, no immunopathological exacerbation

368

has been observed. Long term observation even after decrease in Ab titer could be necessary to exclude

369

such hypothesis. In the case of MERS-CoV, it has been reported that one particular RBD-specific

370

neutralizing monoclonal Ab (Mersmab1) could mediate in vitro ADE of MERS-CoV into the host cells

371

by mimicking the viral receptor human DPP4 and inducing conformational rearrangements of SMERS

372

(Wan et al., 2020). We believe that it is difficult to compare the polyclonal Ab response and its paratope

373

repertoire complexity with the singular properties of a monoclonal Ab which cannot be representative

374

of the polyclonal response induced by a vaccine. In addition, very contradictorily, results from the same

375

team reported that a single-dose treatment with a humanized version of Mersmab1 afforded complete

376

protection of a human transgenic mouse model from lethal MERS challenge (Qiu et al., 2016).

377

Therefore, even with an Ab which might facilitate the cell host invasion in vitro in some conditions,

378

not only there is no exacerbation of the infection in vivo, but also there is a notable protection.

379

It is noteworthy that all vaccine candidates currently under clinical development are planned to be

380

administered via the i.m. route and will thus induce systemic - but not mucosal - immunity. Our results

381

evidenced a strong correlation between the presence of mucosal anti-SCoV-2 IgA, local NAb activity in

382

the respiratory tracts and very robust pulmonary protection. Therefore, vaccine administration via the

383

i.n. route, which is the main entry door of SARS-CoV-2, has to be taken into the account when

384

establishing the COVID-19 vaccination protocols, especially since this route is non-invasive and

385

particularly suitable for mass vaccination of children and elderly people.

386

The fact that the current vaccine candidates do not take advantage of i.n. immunization is certainly

387

related to the pro-inflammatory properties of most of the vaccination vectors or the requirement of

388

encapsulation/adjuvantation of nucleic acids or inactivated vaccines, which rise safety concerns.

389

Unlike most of the other vaccination viral vectors, LV are non-replicative, non-inflammatory, do not

390

suffer from pre-existing immunity in human populations, and are effective under their non-integrative

391

variant. Therefore, LV are particularly safe and favorable for use in mucosal immunization through the

392

i.n. route, which is essential in immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. Prophylactic vaccination is

393

the most cost-effective and efficient strategy against infectious diseases in general and against

394

emerging coronaviruses in particular. Our results firmly established that the LV encoding for SCoV-2,

395

used in a prime-target protocol is a prominent vaccine strategy against COVID-19.

Methods

509

Construction of transfer pFLAP plasmids coding for SFL, S1-S2, or S1 proteins

510

A codon-optimized full-length S (1-1273) sequence was amplified from pMK-RQ_S-2019-nCoV

511

and inserted between BamHI and XhoI sites of pFlap-ieCMV-WPREm. Sequences encoding for S1-

512

S2 (1-1211) or S1 (1-681) were amplified by PCR from the pFlap-ieCMV- SFL-WPREm plasmid and

513

sub-cloned into pFlap-ieCMV-WPREm between the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites (Figure S1).

514

Each of the PCR products were inserted between the native human ieCMV promoter and a mutated

515

Woodchuck Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (mWPRE) sequence, in which the atg starting

516

codon was mutated to avoid transcription of the downstream truncated “X” protein of Woodchuck

517

Hepatitis Virus, in order to improve the vector safety. Plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli

518

DH5a in Lysogeny Broth supplemented with 50 µg/ml of kanamycin and purified using the

519

NucleoBond Xtra Maxi EF Kit (Macherey Nagel) and resuspended in Tris-EDTA Endotoxin-Free

520

buffer overnight. Plasmid were quantified with a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Ficher,

521

Illkirch, France), aliquoted and stored at -20°C. Plasmid DNA were verified by enzymatic digestion

522

and by sequencing the region proximal to the transgene insertion sites.

523

Production and titration of LV

524

Non-replicative LV were produced in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)-293T cells, as previously

525

detailed (Zennou et al., 2000). Briefly, lentiviral particles were produced by transient calcium

526

phosphate co-transfection of HEK293T cells with the vector plasmid pTRIP/sE, a VSV-G Indiana

527

envelope plasmid and an encapsidation plasmid (p8.74 or pD64V for the production of integration-

528

proficient or integration-deficient vectors respectively). Supernatants were harvested at 48h post

529

transfection, clarified by 6-minute centrifugation at 2500 rpm at 4°C. LV were aliquoted and stored at

530

-80°C. Vector titers were determined by transducing 293T cells treated with aphidicolin. The titer,

531

proportional to the efficacy of nuclear gene transfer, is determined as Transduction Unit (TU)/ml by

532

qPCR on total lysates at day 3 post transduction, by use of forward 5’-TGG AGG AGG AGA TAT

533

GAG GG-3’ and reverse 5’-CTG CTG CAC TAT ACC AGA CA-3’ primers, specific to pFLAP

534

plasmid and forward 5’-TCT CCT CTG ACT TCA ACA GC-3’ and reverse 5’-CCC TGC ACT TTT

535

TAA GAG CC-3’ primers specific to the host housekeeping gene gadph as previously described

536

(Iglesias et al., 2006).

537

Mouse and hamster studies

538

Female C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Le Genest Saint Isle, France) were used between the age of 6

539

and 10 weeks. Male Mesocricetus auratus golden hamsters (Janvier, Le Genest Saint Isle, France) were

540

purchased mature, i.e. 80-90 gr weight. At the beginning of the immunization regimen they weighed

541

100 to 120 gr. Experimentation on animals was performed in accordance with the European and French

guidelines (Directive 86/609/CEE and Decree 87-848 of 19 October 1987) subsequent to approval by

543

the Institut Pasteur Safety, Animal Care and Use Committee, protocol agreement delivered by local

544

ethical committee (CETEA #DAP20007) and Ministry of High Education and Research

545

APAFIS#24627-2020031117362508 v1. Animals were vaccinated with the indicated TU of LV and

546

sera were collected at various time points post immunization to monitor binding and neutralization

547

activities. Previous to i.m. or i.n. instillations, animals were anesthetized by i.p. injection of a mixture

548

of Ketamine (Imalgene, 50 mg/kg) and Xylazine (Rompun, 50 mg/kg).

549

SARS-CoV-2 inoculation

550

Hamsters or Ad5::hACE2-pretreated mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of mixture Ketamine

551

and Xylazine, transferred into a biosafety cabinet 3 where they were inoculated i.n. with 0.3 or 1 × 105

552

TCID50 of the BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (Lescure et al., 2020),

553

amplified in VeroE6 cells. The strain BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 was supplied by the National

554

Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) and headed by Pr.

555

Sylvie van der Werf. The human sample from which strain BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 was

556

isolated has been provided by Dr. X. Lescure and Pr. Y. Yazdanpanah from the Bichat Hospital, Paris,

557

France. The viral inoculum was contained in 20 µl for mice and in 50 µl for hamsters. Animals were

558

then housed in an isolator in BioSafety Level 3 animal facilities of Institut Pasteur. The organs and

559

fluids recovered from the animals infected with live SARS-CoV-2 were manipulated following the

560

approved standard operating procedures of these facilities.

561

Recombinant SCoV-2 proteins

562

Codon-optimized nucleotide fragments encoding a stabilized foldon-trimerized version of the

563

SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (a.a. 1 to 1208), the S1 monomer (a.a. 16 to 681) and the RBD subdomain

564

(amino acid 331 to 519) both preceded by a murine IgK leader peptide and followed by an 8xHis Tag

565

were synthetized and cloned into pcDNA™3.1/Zeo(+) expression vector (Thermo Fisher). Proteins

566

were produced by transient co-transfection of exponentially growing Freestyle™ 293-F suspension

567

cells (Thermo Fisher) using polyethylenimine (PEI)-precipitation method as previously described

568

(Lorin and Mouquet, 2015). Recombinant SCoV-2 proteins were purified by affinity chromatography

569

using the Ni Sepharose® Excel Resin according to manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher).

570

Protein purity was evaluated by in-gel protein silver-staining using Pierce Silver Stain kit (Thermo

571

Fisher) following SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-reducing conditions using NuPAGE™ 3-8% Tris-

572

Acetate gels (Life Technologies). Purified proteins were dialyzed overnight against PBS using Slide-

573

A-Lyzer® dialysis cassettes (10 kDa MW cut-off, Thermo Fisher). Protein concentration was

574

determined using the NanoDrop™ One instrument (Thermo Fisher).

575

ELISA

576

Ninety-six-well Nunc Polysorp plates (Nunc, Thermo Ficher) were coated overnight at 4 °C with

577

100 ng/well of purified SCoV-2 proteins in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The next day, plates

578

were blocked with carbonate buffer containing 1% BSA for 2 h at 37°C. Wells were then washed with

579

PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), 1:100-diluted sera or 1:10-diluted lung homogenates in

580

PBS-T containing 1% BSA and four serial ten-to-ten dilutions were added and incubated during 2h at

581

37°C. After PBS-T washings, plates were incubated with 1,000-fold diluted peroxydase-conjugated

582

goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom) for 1

583

h. Plates were revealed by adding 100 µl of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic substrate

584

(Eurobio Scientific). Following a 30 min incubation, reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of 2N

585

H2SO4 and optical densities were measured at 450nm/620nm on a PR3100 reader.

586

NAb Detection

587

Serial dilutions of heat inactivated sera or clarified lung homogenates were assessed for NAbs via

588

an inhibition assay which uses HEK293T cells transduced to stably express human ACE2 and non-

589

replicative SCoV-2 pseudo-typed LV particles which harbor the reporter luciferase firefly gene, allowing

590

quantitation of the host cell invasion by mimicking fusion step of native SARS-CoV-2 virus (Sterlin et

591

al., 2020). First, 1.5 × 102 TU of SCoV-2 pseudo-typed LV were pre-incubated, during 30 min at room

592

temperature, in U-bottom plates, with serial dilutions of each serum in a final volume of 50µl in

593

DMEM-glutamax, completed with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml

594

streptomycin. The samples were then transferred into clear-flat-bottom 96-well-black-plates (Corning),

595

and each well received 2 × 104 hACE2+ HEK293-T cells, counted in a NucleoCounter NC.200 system

596

(Chemometec, Denmark) contained in 50 µl. After 2 days incubation at 37°C 5% CO2, the transduction

597

efficiency of hACE2+ HEK293-T cells by pseudo-typed LV particles was determined by measuring

598

the luciferase activity, using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega) on an EnSpire plate reader

599

(PerkinElmer), as detailed elsewhere (Sterlin et al., 2020). Results are expressed as percentages of

600

inhibition of luciferase activity compared to the maximum of luciferase activity in the absence of NAbs.

601

Serum samples from COVID-19 cases have been recently described elsewhere (Grzelak et al.,

602

2020). Each participant provided written consent to participate in the study, which was approved by

603

the regional investigational review board (IRB; Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile‐de‐France VII,

604

Paris, France), according to European guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was

605

registered as ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04325646).

606

SFL T-cell epitope mapping

607

In order to map the immuno-dominant epitopes of SCoV-2, peptides spanning the whole SFL

608

(Mimotopes, Australia) were pooled by 16, each containing 15 a.a. residues overlapping by 10 a.a.

609

Peptides were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and diluted before use at 1 µg/ml for

610

ELISPOT or 2-5 µg/ml for ICS (Intracellular Cytokine Staining) in RRMI-1640 medium supplemented

611

with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 x 10-4 M non-essential amino-acids,

612

1% vol/vol HEPES, 1 x 10-3 M sodium pyruvate and 5 × 10-5 M of b-mercapto-ethanol. IFN-g

613

ELISPOT and ICS assays were performed as described previously (Bourgine et al., 2018; Sayes et al.,

614

2016). For ICS, cells were acquired in an Attune NxT Flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher) and the data

615

were analyzed by FlowJo Software (TreeStar Inc.).

616

Generation of Ad5 gene transfer vectors

617

The Ad5 gene transfer vectors were produced using the ViraPower Adenoviral Promoterless

618

Gateway Expression Kit (Thermo Fisher). The sequence containing CMV promoter, BamH1/Xho1

619

restriction sites and WPRE was PCR amplified from the pTRIPΔU3CMV plasmid, by use of: (i)

620

forward primer, encoding the attB1 in the 5’ end, and (ii) reverse primer, encoding both the attB2 and

621

SV40 polyA signal sequence in the 5’ end. The attB-PCR product was cloned into the gateway

622

pDONR207 donor vector, via BP Clonase reaction. The hACE2 was amplified from a plasmid

623

derivative of hACE2-expressing pcDNA3.1, while egfp was amplified from pTRIP-ieCMV-eGFP-

624

WPRE (Ku et al., in revision.). The amplified PCR products were cloned into the pDONR207 plasmid

625

via the BamH1 and Xho1 restriction sites. To obtain the final Ad5 plasmid, the pDONR207 vector,

626

harboring hACE2 or gfp genes, was further inserted into pAd/PL-DESTTM vector via LR Clonase

627

reaction (Figure S7).

628

The Ad5 virions were generated by transfecting the E3-transcomplementing HEK-293A cell line

629

with pAd CMV-GFP-WPRE-SV40 polyA or pAd CMV-hACE2-WPRE-SV40 polyA plasmid

630

followed by subsequent vector amplification, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ViraPower

631

Adenoviral Promoterless Gateway Expression Kit, Thermo Fisher). The Ad5 particles were purified

632

using Adeno-X rapid Maxi purification kit and concentrated with the Amicon Ultra-4 10k centrifugal

633

filter unit. Vectors were resuspended and stored à -80°C in PIPES buffer pH 7.5, supplemented with

634

2.5% glucose. Ad5 were titrated using a qPCR protocol, as described (Gallaher and Berk, 2013).

635

Western blot

636

Expression of hACE2 in the lungs of Ad5::hACE2-transduced mice was assessed by Western

637

Blotting. One million cells from lung cell suspension were resolved on 4 – 12 % NuPAGE Bis-Tris

638

protein gels (Thermo Fisher), then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad, France). The

639

nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in 5 % non-fat milk in PBS-T for 2 hours at room temperature

640

and probed overnight with goat anti-hACE2 primary Ab at 1 µg/mL (AF933, R&D systems).

641

Following three wash intervals of 10 minutes with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 1 hour at

642

room temperature with HRP-conjugated anti-goat secondary Ab and HRP-conjugated anti-b-actin

643

(ab197277, Abcam). The membrane was washed with PBS-T thrice before visualization with enhanced

644

chemiluminescence via the super signal west femto maximum sensitivity substrate (ThermoFisher) on

645

ChemiDoc XRS+ (Biorad, France). PageRuler Plus prestained protein ladder was used as size

646

reference.

647

Determination of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in the lungs

648

Half of each lung lobes were removed aseptically and frozen at -80°C. Organs were thawed and

649

homogenized for 20 s at 4.0 m/s, using lysing matrix M (MP Biomedical) in 500 µl of ice-cold PBS.

650

The homogenization was performed in an MP Biomedical Fastprep 24 Tissue Homogenizer. The

651

homogenates were centrifuged 10 min at 2000g for further RNA extraction from the supernatants.

652

Particulate viral RNA was extracted from 70 µl of such supernatants using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini

653

Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Viral load was determined following reverse

654

transcription and real-time quantitative TaqMan® PCR essentially as described (Corman et al., 2020),

655

using SuperScriptTM III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) and primers and

656

probe (Eurofins) targeting SCoV-2 gene as listed in Table S1. In vitro transcribed RNA derived from

657

plasmid “pCI/SARS-CoV envelope” was synthesized using T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA

658

production system (Promega), then purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and two successive

659

precipitations with isopropanol and ethanol. RNA concentration was determined by optical density

660

measurement, then RNA was diluted to 109 genome equivalents/µL in RNAse-free water containing

661

100µg/mL tRNA carrier, and stored in single-use aliquots at -80°C. Serial dilutions of this in vitro

662

transcribed RNA were prepared in RNAse-free water containing 10µg/ml tRNA carrier and used to

663

establish a standard curve in each assay. Thermal cycling conditions were: (i) reverse transcription at

664

55°C for 10 min, (ii) enzyme inactivation at 95°C for 3 min, and (iii) 45 cycles of

665

denaturation/amplification at 95°C for 15 s, 58°C for 30 s. Products were analyzed on an ABI 7500

666

Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). PFU assay was performed as recently described

667

(Case et al., 2020).

668

Cytometric analysis of lung cells

669

Lungs from individual mice were treated with 400 U/ml type IV collagenase and DNase I (Roche)

670

for a 30-minute incubation at 37°C and homogenized by use of GentleMacs (Miltenyi Biotech) mAbs.

671

Cells were filtered through 100 µm-pore filters and centrifuged at 1200 rpm during 8 minutes. Cells

672

were then treated with Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer (Sigma) and washed twice in PBS. Cells were

673

qRT-PCR Detection of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of the mice and
hamsters

691

Lung samples from mice or hamsters were added to lysing matrix D (MP Biomedical) containing 1

692

mL of TRIzol reagent and homogenized at 30 s at 6.0 m/s twice using MP Biomedical Fastprep 24

693

Tissue Homogenizer. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher) according to the

694

manufacturer’s procedure. cDNA was synthesized from 4 µg of RNA in the presence of 2.5 µM of

695

oligo(dT) 18 primers, 0.5 mM of deoxyribonucleotides, 2.0 U of RNase Inhibitor and SuperScript IV

696

Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher) in 20 µl reaction. The real-time PCR was performed on

697

QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher). Reactions were performed in

698

triplicates in a final reaction volume of 10 µl containing 5 µl of iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Biorad,

699

France), 4 µl of cDNA diluted 1:15 in DEPC-water and 0.5 µl of each forward and reverse primers at

700

a final concentration of 0.5 µM (Table S2, S3). The following thermal profile was used: a single cycle

701

of polymerase activation for 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 15 sec at 95°C and

702

30 sec 60°C (annealing-extension step). Mice b-globin or hamster ribosomal protein L18 (RLP18) was

703

used as an endogenous reference control to normalize differences in the amount of input nucleic acid.

704

The average CT values were calculated from the technical replicates for relative quantification of target

705

cytokines/chemokines. The differences in the CT cytokines/chemokines amplicons and the CT of the

706

endogenous reference control, termed DCT, were calculated to normalize for differences in the quantity

707

of nucleic acid. The DCT of the experimental condition compared relatively to the PBS-immunized

708

individuals using the comparative DDCT method. The fold change in gene expression was further

709

calculated using 2−ΔΔCT.
