Abstract
The technique RT-qPCR for viral RNA detection is the current worldwide strategy
used for early detection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. RNA extraction is a key
pre-analytical step in RT-qPCR, often achieved using commercial kits. However, the
magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing disruptions to the global supply chains
used by many diagnostic laboratories to procure the commercial kits required for RNA
extraction. Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing
countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative
procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology
laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to
complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA
extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal
swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with
commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any
molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient
management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic.
Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit
shortages.

Introduction
SARS-CoV2, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is the etiological agent of the current
COVID-19 pandemic that has generated an international public health emergency. As of
May 3rd, 2020, the virus has infected more than 3.3 million individuals and killed over
238,000 people worldwide (Situation Report 104 of the World Health Organization).
Testing for the presence of the virus is of utmost importance for containment strategies
aiming to reduce dissemination of the virus and prescription of appropriate clinical
practices for affected patients. However, understanding and managing the full extent of
the outbreak has remained a challenge for most countries due to significant bottlenecks
imposed by diagnosis1.
Early detection of infection by SARS-CoV2 relies on the efficient detection of the viral
genome using RT-qPCR. Several RT-qPCR-based tests are being used in clinical
settings2, and novel approaches are constantly being reported3-10. All methods require an
RNA extraction step to isolate the viral genetic material before its detection.
Unfortunately, RNA extraction has become a serious bottleneck for COVID-19 diagnosis
around the world due to shortages in RNA-extraction kits customarily used to process
patients samples. This is particularly troublesome in developing countries lacking the
infrastructure and capacities to produce these kits locally. Before the kit-era, which
contributed to standardize and simplify molecular biology work, several RNA extraction
methods were routinely used in research laboratories around the world. RNA isolation

procedures typically involve three general steps: cell lysis, separation of RNA from other
macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, followed by RNA concentration. To
prevent RNA degradation, cell lysis must be conducted under conditions that inhibit
RNase activity, which is abundant in many cellular compartments11,12. RNA separation
from other macromolecules is often achieved by a combination of pH and organic
solvents, such as phenol/chloroform13-16. RNA concentration is most commonly achieved
by high salt and isopropanol or ethanol precipitation11,12,17-20.
We reviewed the published literature to search for procedures of RNA extraction that
could potentially be used to replace commercial kits. Many different protocols and
variations have been published over the years that optimize or simplify the RNA
extraction process from various types of samples. We tested five types of procedures to
identify an efficient procedure for extracting RNA from clinical samples that is compatible
with downstream RT-qPCR analysis. Of the procedures evaluated, a simple method
based in acid pH separation of RNA was found the most suitable. It can be carried out in
approximately 40 min for ten samples, and is not more laborious than current methods
using commercial kits. This procedure requires reagents and equipment that can be
found in any standard molecular biology laboratory, thus avoiding supply chain issues.
The resulting RNA can be used to detect SARS-CoV2 by standard RT-qPCR testing
protocols with robust results comparable to those obtained using commercial RNAextraction kits.
Results
Screening of alternative procedures for RNA extraction
For validation of the RNA extraction procedures, the RNase P target was amplified in a
one-step RT-qPCR reaction, as quality control for the extraction method. As shown in
Figure 1, three of the five procedures evaluated yielded enough RNA to amplify the
target gene, whereas two of them did not. The TRIzol approach was most effective,
exhibiting the highest yield when amplifying the human RNase P target (Figure 1). The
BSA-based protocol also allowed for amplification of the RNase P target, albeit with a
lower yield and significant variability among replicates (Figure 1). Acid pH-based method
also allowed amplification of the RNase P target, though with lower yields when
compared to the TRIzol method (Figure 1). The direct method and high-temperature
method did not yield enough RNA to amplify the RNase P gene under our experimental
conditions. While TRIzol appears to be the best experimental procedure in terms of yield,
it is not easy to use for a diagnostics laboratory setting as it requires a chemical hood for
the organic extraction step. Biosafety cabinets class II (BSL-2) necessary for operator
protection are not appropriate for working with organic solvents. BSA, TRIzol, and acid
pH procedures provided comparable yields, but the acid pH method was more consistent
among replicates. Based on these considerations, we decided to validate the acid pH

method to extract RNA from clinical samples, using High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) as
the gold standard.
Validation of the acid pH RNA extraction method in clinical samples
To validate the acid pH method of RNA extraction, RT-qPCR using TaqMan probes and
primers recommended by the CDC were used21. The nucleocapsid viral proteins N1 and
N2 were amplified as viral targets, and RNase P was also amplified as a control. We
analyzed 50 clinical samples: 22 were positive, 11 were undetermined, and 17 were
negative according to RT-qPCR recommended by CDC21, using RNA extracted with High
Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). Undetermined samples are described as having a viral load
around the limit of detection (LOD) of the RT-qPCR method that was reported as 100.5
RNA copies / µl21. This means that the RT-qPCR method can detect 16 RNA copies per
PCR reaction. The PCR test used detects 2 targets of the virus: N1 and N2. The mean
Cq value for N1 target reported for sets of ut s t t r ≥ 95% p s t v s r u
3621. Therefore we analyzed the efficiency of both extraction methods in two different
groups of samples: those with Cq N1 ≤36
t s wt
q N1 >36 The results for the
50 samples are shown in Table 1. For samples with Cq N1 ≤36 there were no
differences in Cq values for N1 and N2 obtained using High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche)
or the acid pH method (Figure 2A). In contrast, for samples with Cq N1 >36, Cq values
for N1 and N2 were higher for High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) than those obtained with
acid pH method (p=0.026 and p=0.022 respectively) (Figure 2B). For samples with Cq
N1 ≤36 Cq values for RNase P were slightly higher for acid pH method (p=0.021),
whereas for samples with Cq N1 >36 there was no significant difference between both
methods. The % of agreement between both methods was calculated considering
samples whose report changed from positive, undetermined or negative. In total, 8
samples changed their report. The 17 negative samples were also negative using RNA
extracted with the acid pH method. Out of 22 positive samples, 21 were also positive
using RNA extracted with the acid pH method, whereas one sample was undetermined.
Out of 11 undetermined samples analyzed, 4 were still undetermined using RNA
extracted with the acid pH method. However, 3 of them were negative and 4 of them
were positive. Agreement for negative samples was 100%. The percentage of agreement

samples with Cq N1 >36 was only 57%.
Importantly, the processing time and laboriousness of the acid-pH method is similar or
less than that of High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) method. A detailed scheme of the
method is shown in Figure 3.

Discussion
Here we tested several kit-free RNA extraction methods compatible with RT-qPCR
analysis and selected one simple procedure based on RNA extraction using acid pH. We
validated this method using 50 clinical samples with results comparable to those

obtained with commercial kits. There are three key aspects of this method that must be
pointed out. First, the acid pH-based methods that we reviewed12,14,22 are intended for
RNA extraction from tissue, cultured cells, and cell-associated virus. Therefore, the first
step of these protocols is centrifugation with subsequent lysis of the cell pellet. However,
we need to recover free viral particles in solution, which do not sediment after routine
centrifugation at 15,000 g. For this reason we used the uncentrifuged sample directly
mixed with lysis buffer, with subsequent precipitation of viral RNA in the whole mix
volume. Using uncentrifuged sample is the key step for efficient RNA recovery because
when centrifuged sample was used in preliminar tests, Cq values were much higher than
those obtained with High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche). Second, the acid pH method uses
the anionic detergent Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that can lyse cells and viral coats
through disruption of noncovalent bonds in proteins causing them to lose their native
conformation12. Third, low pH and high concentration of salt make possible the selective
recovery of RNA. Within the pH range of 5.5 to 6.0, RNA degradation is minimized22.
RNA phosphodiester bond is more stable at acidic than alkaline pH, where it is
susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis at pH greater than 623. Acid hydrolysis can only occur
at pH lower than 212,24. Moreover, DNA and RNA have different solubility at different pH,
mainly due to the 2' hydroxyl group of RNA, which increases the polarity of this nucleic
acid25,26. Therefore, it is essential to adjust the Lysis Buffer to pH 5, as described in
Materials and Methods.
It is worth mentioning that all of the samples that changed their report had Cq values that
were around the cutoff value of 40. These changes occurred in both directions, meaning
that some Cqs increased and some Cqs decreased. It would have been very clarifying to
perform triplicated RNA extractions, in particular for undetermined samples, whose viral
load is around the detection limit. Because of the above exposed information we consider
the acid pH method robust and reliable. In fact, it is currently being used in our diagnostic
laboratory since the 3rd week of April 2020 for routine detection of SARS-CoV2 in clinical
samples.
The RNA extraction procedure with acid pH described here has many advantages over
commercial kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 in the context of the current pandemic. This
experimental procedure utilizes low cost reagents and equipment that can be found in
standard molecular biology laboratories. The cost of extraction is a critical issue in most
clinical laboratories, and the cost of our in-house method is around ten times lower than
extraction kits. Moreover, DNase treatment is not necessary because SARS-CoV-2
detection is not altered in the presence of DNA. In fact, residual DNA may serve as the
template for RNase P gene amplification. Because of current environmental concerns,
we would also like to highlight the lower plastic contamination generated by this in-house
method. Column-based extraction kits use several disposable tubes per sample,
columns, bottles of buffer solutions, and plastic bags. Our in-house extraction method is
by far, much more environmental friendly; it requires only two Eppendorf tubes per
sample. Finally, our in-house method is comparable in hands-on time to commercial kits:
it can be carried out in approximately 40 minutes for a set of 10 samples. However, it is

important to mention that additional care must be taken in handling to avoid crosscontamination between samples.
In conclusion, the RNA extraction procedure with acid pH described here is an excellent
alternative to commercial systems to test for SARS-CoV2. Our results support a new
method for RNA extraction from swab samples that can be used to detect SARS-CoV2
by standard RT-qPCR testing protocols. This procedure can be a helpful alternative for
laboratories facing supply-chain disruption and commercial kit shortages.
Materials and Methods
Biological samples
Two types of biological samples were used. For preliminary evaluation of the RNA
extraction methods we used saliva samples obtained from two asymptomatic volunteers.
Saliva is routinely collected for the initial assessment of viral infection. Two saliva
samples were obtained from each volunteer and at least three independent RNA
extractions were performed from each sample, obtaining a minimum of six RNA
preparations to test each experimental procedure. For validation of the RNA extraction
method selected, we used nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM).
Swabs were obtained from 50 patients that attended the outpatient service of Red Salud
UC-CHRISTUS (Santiago, Chile) because of suspected coronavirus infection. Only one
sample was obtained per patient: one portion of the sample was extracted using the High
Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche), and another portion of the same sample was extracted using
the acid pH method. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their
legal guardians. Samples were processed in the Laboratory of Diagnostic Microbiology of
the same institution. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant
guidelines and regulations. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
RNA extraction methods evaluated
The following experimental procedures were tested in this study. Saliva samples were
centrifuged before taking an aliquot of supernatant for processing as described below.

(2) BSA-based method. Previous reports show that BSA has positive effects on RTqPCR results when added to samples in the presence of inhibitors27,28. Based on the

(3) Acid pH-based method. Under acidic pH, RNA can be separated from DNA and
other molecules due to the differential polarity given by its hydroxyl groups, which
maintains it in solution12,22,25,26,29. Based on the methods described by Heath (1999)22,
Sambrook and Russell (2001)12, and Chomczynski and Sacchi (2006)14, 300 µL of pH 5
Lysis Buffer (69,4 mM SDS, 68 mM sodium citrate dihydrate, 132 mM anhydrous citric
acid and 10 mM EDTA, then adjust the buffer to pH 5) were added to 200 µL of
uncentrifuged sample and mixed by pipetting three times. Then, 150 µL of Precipitation
Buffer (17 mM sodium citrate dihydrate, 33,3 mM anhydrous citric acid, and 4 M NaCl)
were added and mixed by inversion 10 times. Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min
and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 3 min at room temperature. 600 μL of the supernatant

Supernatant was discarded and tubes were inverted in paper towel. The pellet was dried,
leaving the tubes open for 10 min. Finally, the pellet was resuspended i 50 μL
nuclease-free water pre-warmed at 70°C.
NOTE: If the buffer is stored for later use, it precipitates at 4°C, so it needs to be heated
for 5 minutes at 60°C for its use.
(4) High temperature-based method. Based on the method described by Fomsgaard
and Rosenstierne (2020)30, 50 µL of the sample were directly heated at 98°C for 5 min
and cooled at 4°C. Then 19 µL of the sample were mixed with 1 µL of BSA (20 mg/mL)
and kept on ice for immediate use or at -80 °C for later use.
(5) Direct use of the samples. An aliquot taken from the original sample was directly
used to perform RT-qPCR analysis31.
The 50 nasopharyngeal swabs used for the validation of the RNA extraction method
selected, were extracted using High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche) according to instructions
provided by the manufacturer. This RNA extraction method was considered as the gold
standard for comparison purposes, and It is based in capture of RNA using columns with
silica filters.

RT-qPCR analysis
For preliminary evaluation of RNA extraction procedures, we used RT-qPCR against the
human RNAse P gene with primers and a Taqman probe previously described 32. RP1-F:
AGATTTGGACCTGCGAGCG, RP1-R: GAGCGGCTGTCTCCACAAGT, and RP1-probe:
TTCTGACCTGAAGGCTCTGCGCG. The RNase P gene is used as an internal control
because many copies of it exist in the human genome, and it is readily detectable. The
source of RNase P comes from the human cells that are present in every sample used. It
is assumed that if human nucleic acids were extracted to detect the human gene RNase
P, viral nucleic acids were also successfully extracted. The RNase P target is also
amplified as a quality control for the extraction method and to corroborate the absence of
PCR-inhibitors in the sample.

-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
For validation of the selected RNA extraction procedure, RT-qPCR using Taqman probes
and primers recommended by the CDC was used 21. Two viral targets were amplified: the
nucleocapsid viral proteins N1 and N2. Primers and probe for N1 were N1-F:
GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT, N1-R: TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG, and N1probe: FAM-ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ1. Primers and probe for N2
were N2-F: TTACAAACATTGGCCGCAAA, N2-R: GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA, and N2probe: FAM-ACAATTTGCCCCCAGCGCTTCAG-BHQ1. Primers and probe for RNase P
were RP2-F: AGATTTGGACCTGCGAGCG, RP2-R: GAGCGGCTGTCTCCACAAGT,
and RP2-probe: FAM–TTCTGACCTGAAGGCTCTGCGCG–BHQ1. A one-step RT-qPCR
reaction was performed in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Cutoff points for Cq values (Cycle of quantification, or Cycle Threshold) required to
decide whether a result is COVID-19 positive or negative were those specified by CDC
as follows. To report a positive result, both viral targets N1 and N2 must be Cq<40. To
report a negative result both viral targets must be Cq≥40 I

Cq<40 and the other is Cq≥40 t r su t ust b reported as undetermined. The RNase

Statistical analysis
Mean Cq values obtained through both methods for each target gene were analyzed in
pairwise comparisons using a p r Stu

GraphPad Prism 8 software.
