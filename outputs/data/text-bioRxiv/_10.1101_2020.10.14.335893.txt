Abstract

20

The upcoming flu season in the northern hemisphere merging with the current COVID-19

21

pandemic raises a potentially severe threat to public health. Through experimental co-

22

infection of IAV with either pseudotyped or SARS-CoV-2 live virus, we found that IAV

23

pre-infection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell

24

types. Remarkably, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were

25

observed in mice co-infected with IAV in vivo. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-

26

CoV-2 infectivity was not seen with several other viruses probably due to a unique IAV

27

segment as an inducer to elevate ACE2 expression. This study illustrates that IAV has a

28

special nature to aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection, and prevention of IAV is of great

29

significance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

31

The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at

32

the end of 2019 has become pandemic worldwide. Up to date, there had been more than 36

33

million confirmed infected cases and 1 million deaths globally (https://covid19.who.int/).

34

The ending time and the final severity of the current COVID-19 pandemic wave are still

35

uncertain. Meanwhile, the upcoming seasonal influenza merging with the current pandemic

36

might bring more challenges and pose a bigger threat to public health. There are many

37

debates on whether seasonal flu would impact the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and

38

whether massive influenza vaccination is necessary for the coming winter. However, no

39

experimental evidence is available concerning IAV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.

40

It is well known that disease symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections are quite

41

similar, such as fever, cough, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, etc(1, 2).

42

Moreover, both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV are airborne transmitted pathogens that infect the

43

same human tissues such as the respiratory tract, nasal, bronchial, and alveolar epithelial

44

cultures(3, 4). Besides, alveolar type II cells (AT2 pneumocytes) appeared to be

45

preferentially infected by SARS-CoV-2, which were also the primary site of IAV

46

replication(5, 6). Therefore, the overlap of the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal influenza

47

would pose a large population under the high risks of co-occurrent infection by these two

48

viruses(7).

49

Unfortunately, during the last winter flu season in the southern hemisphere, there was

50

little epidemiological evidence about the interaction between COVID-19 and flu, probably

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.335893; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

51

due to a low IAV infection rate resulted from social distancing(8, 9). A case report showed

52

that three out of four SARS-CoV-2 and IAV co-infected patients rapidly develop to

53

respiratory deterioration(10). On the contrary, other reports only observed mild symptoms

54

in limited co-infection outpatients(11). Thus, the clinical co-infection outcomes are still

55

unclear when a large population will face the threats of both viruses.

56

In this study, we tested whether IAV infection could affect the subsequent SARS-CoV-2

57

infection in both infected cells and mice. The results demonstrate that the pre-infection of

58

IAV strongly enhances the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by boosting viral entry in the cells

59

and by elevating viral load plus more severe lung damage in infected mice. These data

60

suggest a clear auxo-action of IAV on SARS-CoV-2 infection, which implies the great

61

importance of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection to public health.

Results

63

IAV promotes SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity.

64

To study the interaction between IAV and SARS-CoV-2, A549 (a hypotriploid alveolar

65

basal epithelial cell line) cells that are susceptible to IAV infection but usually do not

66

support SARS-CoV-2 infection were applied to test whether IAV pre-infection would

67

modulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Pseudotyped VSV luciferase-reporter particles

68

bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (pSARS-CoV-2) were used to reflect the virus entry

69

activity(12). The cells were firstly infected with IAV (A/WSN/1933[H1N1]) or mock-

70

infected for 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h respectively, and then infected with the pSARS-CoV-2 virus

71

for another 24 h (experimental scheme shown in Fig.1A). The data in Fig. 1B showed that

72

A549 was converted to be highly sensitive (up to 10,000-fold) against the pSARS-CoV-2

73

virus after different doses of IAV infections (from low MOI of 0.01 to high MOI of 1, also

74

shown by pSARS-CoV-2 with mCherry reporter in Fig. S1). In contrast, the pre-infection

75

of IAV had no impacts on pseudotyped VSV particles bearing VSV-G protein (Fig.1C). We

76

further tested more cell lines to show that the enhancement of the pSARS-CoV-2 infectivity

77

by IAV was a general effect although the increased folds were different (lower basal level

78

of infectivity, higher enhancement fold) (Fig.1D).

79

To validate the above results, we substituted the pSARS-CoV-2 with the SARS-CoV-2

80

live (experimental scheme shown in Fig.1E). We found that the pre-infection of IAV

81

strongly increased the copy numbers of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (E and N genes) in both

82

cell lysates and supernatants of A549 (~15 folds) (Fig.1F). Notably, in Calu-3 (Fig.1G) and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.335893; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

83

NHBE (Fig.1H) cells that are initially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, IAV pre-infection could

84

further increase >5 folds of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

85

Collectively, these data suggest an auxo-action of IAV on SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range

86

of cell types.

87

IAV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in mice results in increased SARS-CoV-2 viral

88

load and more severe lung damage.

89

The hACE2 transgenic mice were applied to study the interaction between IAV and

90

SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Mice were infected with 3x105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 with or without

91

2000 PFU of IAV pre-infection and were then sacrificed two days later after SARS-CoV-2

92

infection (the experimental scheme is shown in Fig. 2A). The viral RNA genome copies

93

from lung homogenates confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected both groups

94

(more than 4x108 N gene copies) (Fig. 2B), while the influenza NP gene was only detected

95

in IAV pre-infection group (Fig. 2B). Intriguingly, a significant increase in SARS-CoV-2

96

viral load (12.9-fold increase in E gene and 6.6-fold increase in N gene) was observed in

97

lung homogenates from co-infection mice compared to that from SARS-CoV-2 single-

98

infected mice (Fig. 2C). The histological data in Fig. 2D further illustrated that IAV and

99

SARS-CoV-2 co-infection induced more severe lung pathologic changes with massive

100

infiltrating cells and obvious alveolar necrosis as compared to SARS-CoV-2 single

101

infection or mock infection.

102

IAV components specifically facilitate the entry process of SARS-CoV-2.

103

We further tested if several other viruses on hand had similar effects to promote SARS-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.335893; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

104

CoV-2 infection. To our surprise, neither Sendai virus (SeV) (Fig. 3A), human rhinovirus

105

(HRV3) (Fig. 3B), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) (Fig. 3C), human respiratory

106

syncytial virus (HRSV) (Fig. 3C) nor human enterovirus 71 (EV71) (Fig. 3C) could

107

stimulate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

108

To explore how IAV promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection, we transfected A549 cells with

109

eight individual viral genome segments of IAV to test if any of them could promote SARS-

110

CoV-2 infectivity. The data in Fig. 3D and Fig. 3E showed that IAV segment-2 expression

111

strongly stimulated SARS-CoV-2 multiplication in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cell lysates

112

and supernatant.

113

IAV infection induces elevated ACE2 expression.

114

As IAV strongly increased the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined the

115

viral entry process. It was reported that the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting

116

enzyme 2 (ACE2)(13, 14), together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)

117

(15), Furin(16) and cathepsin L (CatL)(17, 18), mediated SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. In IAV-

118

infected cells, we found that the mRNA level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but not Furin and

119

CatL were increased around three folds (A549 in Fig. 4A, Calu-3 in Fig. S2). An obvious

120

switch of intracellular ACE2 expression was triggered at 12 h post-IAV-infection (Fig. 4C).

121

In the meantime, influenza NP, Mx1, and ISG54 increased accordingly confirming a

122

successful infection of IAV (Fig. 4B).

123

Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA level increased more dramatically in IAV and SARS-CoV-2

124

co-infection cells with 28 folds in A549 (Fig. 4D), 5 folds in Calu-3 (Fig. 4E), 6 folds in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.335893; this version posted October 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

125

NHBE (Fig. 4F) respectively. The mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4G) of ACE2 also

126

increased accordingly in lung homogenates from co-infection mice.

127

When the cell mixture was transduced by lentivirus coding ACE2-sgRNA to knockdown

128

ACE2 expression (Fig. 4H), the IAV-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection was

129

totally abolished (Fig. 4I). Consist of this, ACE2 mRNA levels increased 13.8-fold in

130

SARS-CoV-2-infected cells expressing segment-2 compared to that in control cells

131

transfected with vector (Fig. 4J). Again, the enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity mediated

132

by segment-2 could be blocked in ACE2 knock-down cells (Fig. 4K).

133

The data indicated that IAV permitted increased SARS-CoV-2 infection through the up-

134

regulation of ACE2 expression.

135

Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is independent of IFN signaling.

136

ACE2 was reported to be an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in human airway epithelial

137

cells(19). IAV infection will also stimulate type I IFN signaling. We, therefore, tested

138

whether the augment of ACE2 expression is dependent on IFN or not. For this, cells were

139

firstly pre-treated with different doses of IFNα (Fig. 5) and IFNγ (Fig. S3 A-C) and then

140

infected with pSARS-CoV-2. The data showed that IFNα could not promote the pSARS-

141

CoV-2 infectivity in A549 cells (Fig. 5A), but rather significantly inhibit pSARS-CoV-2

142

infectivity in Calu-3 (Fig. 5D) and Huh-7 (Fig. 5G) cells. Compared with the mRNA levels

143

of ISG54 (Fig. 5 B, E, H), the mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were only mildly

144

increased around 1-3 folds under IFN treatment (Fig. 5 C, F, I). The data indicated that

145

ACE2 could not robustly respond to IFN in these cells, which in turn suggested that ACE2

146

mediated viral entry was not affected by IFN.

147

Moreover, in IFNAR-/- A549 cells, the enhanced infectivity of pSARS-CoV-2 under IAV

148

co-infection remained (Fig. 5J). By contrast to the decreased levels of ISG54 in IFNAR-/-

149

A549 cells (Fig. S3D and Fig. 5K), the mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 still

150

increased in IFNAR-/- A549 cells under IAV infection (Fig. 5L). The results strongly

151

suggested that SARS-CoV-2 responded to IAV infection rather than IFN signaling for a

152

favorable viral infection.

153

Discussion

154

Recently, there are many discussions about the possible impacts of the upcoming flu

155

season on the current COVID-19 pandemic. Speculations have been raised that infection

156

of IAV could induce more severe disease for the secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection, or co-

157

infection of these two viruses cause more serious illness. However, no experimental data

158

are available to show the relationship between IAV and SARS-CoV-2 yet. In this study, we

159

provide the first experimental evidence that the pre-infection of IAV strongly promotes

160

SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and infectivity in co-infected cells and animals. It emphasizes

161

that influenza prevention during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic season is of great importance.

162

Co-infection of viruses frequently occurs in nature. Some studies showed positive

163

interaction between the dengue virus and the Zika virus via antibody-dependent

164

enhancement(20). Other studies showed negative interactions between the common cold

165

virus and SARS-CoV-2 via pre-existing immunity(21). By co-infection with IAV and

166

pseudotyped or live SARS-CoV-2, we observed a great enhancement of SARS-CoV-2

167

infectivity both in cell culture and in vivo in infected mice. Such enhancement was

168

associated with the increased expression level of ACE2 which is a major receptor for

169

SARS-CoV-2 to enter a host cell. We detected a 2-3 folds increase in ACE2 mRNA level

170

post-IAV-infection (A549 cells). However, a much higher increase (28 folds) in the ACE2

171

mRNA level could be detected under IAV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. We suspected

172

that IAV infection induced a mild expression of ACE2 to permit SARS-CoV-2 virus entry

173

so that the subsequent multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 would further enhance ACE2

174

expression in a positive feedback pattern(19).

175

Intriguingly, among all the viruses tested on hand, only IAV but not SeV, HRV3, HPIV,

176

HRSV, or EV71 promoted SARS-CoV-2 infection. The three viruses of HRV3, HPIV, and

177

HRSV are all prevalent pathogens to cause common cold in humans but had no effects on

178

SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. EV71 is a major causative agent for hand-foot-and-mouth disease

179

in young children, but again had little influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore,

180

we confirmed the effects of IAV by H1N1 and H3N2 natural isolates (Fig. S4A), and the

181

infectivity of the current D614G mutant SARS-CoV-2 can also be stimulated by IAV pre-

182

infection (Fig. S4B). The unique feature for IAV to augment SARS-CoV-2 infectivity

183

indicates that the influenza virus is the key pathogen of prevention and control during the

184

current coronavirus pandemic.

185

Among the eight segments of IAV, segment-2 encoding PB1 promotes ACE2 expression

186

and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity at the highest level. The detailed molecular mechanism

187

underlying PB1 mediated SARS-CoV-2 enhancement needs further study. Nevertheless,

188

the IAV PB1 segment encodes multiple viral proteins including PB1, PB1-F2, PB1-N40 to

189

modulate host cells(22). PB1-F2 is a pro-apoptotic factor and can regulate innate

190

immunity(23). PB1-N40 interacts with many host factors and contributes to viral

191

pathogenicity(24). After all, the fact that the IAV PB1 segment could promote SARS-CoV-

192

2 infection further confirms a unique positive interaction between IAV and SARS-CoV-2.

193

Importantly, the enhancement phenotype in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection is

194

independent of IFN signaling. Therefore, influenza vaccination should be recommended to

195

people under the high risk of co-infection. Our findings remind the society that surveillance

196

of co-infection is encouraged in the coming winter. And for sure, social distance and mask-

197

wearing are beneficial to protect people from attacks of either or both the influenza virus.

For IFN treatment, recombinant human IFNα 2a (Beyotime, P5646) and IFNγ (Beyotime,

250

P5664) were dissolved in 0.1% BSA and diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS, and then

251

admitted to cells for 12 hours at indicated doses.

252

Real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction

253

The mRNA levels of indicated genes were quantified by quantitative PCR with reverse

254

transcription (qRT–PCR). Purified RNAs extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen™,15596018)

255

were subjected to reverse transcription with oligo dT primer (using Takara cat#RR037A

256

Kit), and then the corresponding cDNAs were quantified using Hieff qPCR SYBR Green

257

Master Mix (Yeason). Thermal cycling was performed in a 384-well reaction plate

258

(ThermoFisher, 4343814). Gene-specific primers were shown in Supplementary Table 1.

259

All the mRNA levels were normalized by β-actin in the same cell.

261

Taqman RT-PCR Kit (Yeason). To acutely quantify the absolute number of SARS-CoV-2

262

genome, a standard curve by measuring the SARS-CoV-2 N gene constructed in the pCMV-

263

N plasmid was applied. All the SARS-CoV-2 genome copy numbers were normalized by

264

GADPH in the same cell.

265

Western blot analysis.

266

For western blots, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer on ice for 30 minutes and were separated

267

by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and subjected

268

to western blot analysis. For mice experiments, half lung tissue from each mouse was

269

homogenized in PBS followed by boiling in SDS lysis buffer (GE) at 100°C, 30 minutes.

270

Rabbit monoclonal antibody against ACE2 (Abclonal, A4612, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal

271

antibody against SARS-CoV Nucleoprotein (Sino Biological, 40143-MM05, 1:1000), anti-

272

ACE2 knocking-down cells

285

Two sgRNAs targeting the hACE2 gene were designed under the protocol in

286

http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no and commercially synthesized to clone in lenti-Cas9-blast

287

vector (kindly provided by Prof. Hongbing Shu). The control sgRNA lentivirus construct

288

was also provided by Prof. Hongbing Shu. In brief, A549 cells were plated at 6-well plates

289

and transduced with lentivirus encoding CRISPR-Cas9 system including either ACE2

290

sgRNA or control sgRNA. The cell mixtures were selected by blasticidin for one week to

291

obtain ACE2 knocking-down cells. The gene knocking-down efficiencies were confirmed

292

by measuring the ACE2 mRNA level through qRT-PCR analysis.

293

Mice

294

The K18 hACE2 transgenic mice purchased from Gempharmatech were housed in ABSL-

295

3 pathogen-free facilities under 12-h light-dark cycles with access to food and water. Mice

296

were male, age-matched, and grouped for SARS-CoV-2 infection or IAV and SARS-CoV-

297

2 co-infection. At day 0, mice were intranasally infected with PBS or 2000 PFU of WSN

298

respectively, and then both groups were intranasally infected with 3 x105 PFU of SARS-

299

CoV-2 at Day 2. Another two days later, mice were sacrificed to determine viral loads and

300

submitted to histological assay.

A549 (A), Calu-3 (B), and Huh-7 (C) cells were pre-treated with indicated doses of IFNγ

476

for 12 hours. Cells were then infected with pSARS-CoV-2 for another 24 hours followed

477

by measuring luciferase activity. (D) WT, and IFNAR-/-A549 cells were treated with IFNα

478

at 1000 IU/mL for 12 hours, and the mRNA expression levels of indicated genes were

479

measured. Values are mean ± s.d. of three independent results. (A-C) P values are from

480

unpaired One-way ANOVA. *P≤0.05, **P≤0.01, ***P≤0.001, ****P≤0.0001.

(A) MDCK cells were pre-infected with WSN (MOI=0.1), H1N1(MOI=1), or H3N2

483

(MOI=1) for 12 hours and were then infected with pSARS-CoV-2 for another 24 hours

484

followed by measuring luciferase activity. (B) A549 cells were pre-infected with WSN at

485

MOI 0.1 for 12 hours and were then infected with D614G mutant pSARS-CoV-2 for

486

another 24 hours followed by measuring luciferase activity. Values are mean ± s.d. of three

487

independent results. *P≤0.05, **P≤0.01, ***P≤0.001.
