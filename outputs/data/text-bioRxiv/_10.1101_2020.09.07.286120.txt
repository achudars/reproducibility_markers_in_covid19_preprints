Abstract

42

After the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a second zoonotic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, emerged late

43

2019 in China and rapidly caused the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a public health crisis of an

44

unprecedented scale. Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV,

45

transmission and pathogenesis of both viruses seem to be quite distinct. A remarkable feature of the

46

SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site, which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike.

47

The viral spike protein not only attaches to the entry receptor, but also mediates fusion after cleavage by

48

host proteases. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike multibasic cleavage site increases infectivity

49

on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered

50

faster into the lung cell line Calu-3, and more frequently formed syncytial cells in differentiated organoid-

51

derived human airway cells. Moreover, the multibasic cleavage site increased entry speed and plasma

52

membrane serine protease usage relative to endosomal entry using cathepsins. Blocking serine protease

53

activity using the clinically approved drug camostat mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and

54

replication in differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Our findings provide novel information

55

on how SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells and highlight serine proteases as an attractive antiviral

56

target.

Significance Statement

59

Highly pathogenic coronaviruses have spilled from animals to humans three times in the past two

60

decades. Late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China and was declared a pandemic by March 2020. The

61

other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged in 2002 and 2012,

62

respectively, but did not attain sustained human-to-human transmission. Given the high diversity of

63

coronaviruses in animals, urbanization and increased air travel, future coronavirus pandemics are likely to

64

occur intermittently. Identifying which factors determine pandemic potential and pathogenicity are

65

therefore of key importance to global health. Additionally, there is an urgent need to rapidly translate

Introduction

72
73

The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory

74

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in central China late 2019 (1). Within months this

75

virus spread globally and as of August 26, 2020, over 24 million cases have been reported, including over

76

800,000 deaths. Halting SARS-CoV-2 spread has shown to be highly complex, putting great strain on

77

health systems globally. SARS-CoV-2 is the third zoonotic coronavirus to emerge from animal reservoirs

78

within the past two decades, after SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-

79

CoV), in 2002 and 2012, respectively (2-5). In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have

80

not attained sustained human-to-human transmission. These coronaviruses belong to the

81

Betacoronavirus genus (family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae), which is thought to

82

ultimately originate from bats, but can spread to humans via intermediate hosts (6-8).

83
84

Currently it is largely unknown what factors determine coronavirus transmission to and between humans,

85

but one important determinant may be the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which is the main glycoprotein

86

incorporated into the viral envelope. Enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, deposit their genomes

87

into host cells by coalescing their membranes with the cell. This function is executed by S protein trimers,

88

which fuse viral and cellular membranes after binding to the entry receptor (9). In addition, coronaviruses

89

can spread from cell to cell when coronavirus S proteins traffic to the plasma membrane of infected cells

90

and fuse with neighboring cells, generating multinucleated giant cells (syncytia). Coronavirus S proteins

91

are synthesized in infected cells in a stable and fusion-incompetent form and are activated through

92

cleavage by host proteases. Proteolysis controls the timely release of the S protein’s stored energy

93

required to fuse membranes, which allows virions to be stable in the environment yet fusogenic after

94

contacting entry receptors on host cell membranes.

95
96

Cleavage is essential for coronavirus infectivity and can occur in the secretory pathway of infected cells or

97

during viral entry into target cells (9, 10). Several groups of host proteases, including type II

98

transmembrane serine proteases (hereafter referred to as serine proteases), proprotein convertases and

99

cathepsins, can cleave the S protein. Specific sites in the S protein regulate protease usage and therefore

100

play an important role in determining cell tropism. Similarly, tropism can be determined by the availability

101

of proteases that can activate the S protein (10-14). The S protein consists of two domains, the receptor

102

binding (S1) domain and the fusion (S2) domain. These domains are separated by the S1/S2 cleavage

103

site, which in some coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, forms an exposed loop that harbors multiple

104

arginine residues and is therefore referred to as a multibasic cleavage site (15, 16). Cleavage of this site

105

can occur in secretory systems of infected cells by proprotein convertases, including furin. S1/S2

106

cleavage does not directly trigger fusion but may facilitate or regulate further cleavage (17). A second

107

proteolysis step takes place at a more C-terminal site within the S2 domain, notably the S2′ site. S2′

108

cleavage is thought to occur after the virus has been released from producing cells and is bound to host

109

cell receptors on receiving cells. The S2′ site is processed by serine proteases on the plasma membrane

110

or by cathepsins in the endosome. Whereas S2′ cleavage appears to be crucial for coronavirus infectivity,

111

not all coronaviruses contain a multibasic S1/S2 site and little is known of its function (9). Until recently, all

112

viruses within the clade of SARS-related viruses, including SARS-CoV, were found to lack a multibasic

113

S1/S2 cleavage site. However, SARS-CoV-2 contains a PRRA insertion into the S protein, precisely N-

114

terminally from a conserved arginine, creating a multibasic RRAR cleavage motif. Exchanging the SARS-

115

CoV-2 S multibasic cleavage site for the SARS-CoV monobasic site was recently shown to decrease

116

fusogenicity on a monkey kidney cell line (VeroE6) and infectivity in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell

117

line (Calu-3) (18, 19). However, cancer cells often poorly represent untransformed cells and thus the

118

question remains whether the multibasic cleavage site would affect infectivity on relevant lung cells.

119

Another study showed that entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles into both Calu-3 cells and primary

120

airway cultures could be blocked using a clinically approved serine protease inhibitor (camostat

121

mesylate), but no effects on authentic virus entry and replication were shown (20). Here we investigated if

122

the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site affects entry into relevant human lung cells (i), if the multibasic

123

cleavage site can alter protease usage during entry (ii), and if authentic SARS-CoV-2 entry and

124

replication can be inhibited using camostat mesylate (iii).

125
126

Results

127
128

Entry into lung adenocarcinoma and differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells is

129

facilitated by the SARS-CoV-2 S multibasic cleavage site. Recently, Hoffmann and colleagues (2020)

130

showed that the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage motif increases entry into Calu-3 cells by exchanged

131

this motif and several N-terminally flanking amino acids with the monobasic S1/S2 site found in SARS-

132

CoV or in a related bat virus RaTG13 (18). Building on these observations, we generated several SARS-

133

CoV-2 S protein mutants and used these to generate vesicular stomatitis virus- (VSV) based

134

pseudoparticle stocks (PPs) expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Instead of exchanging

135

cleavage sites, we mutated the minimal RXXR multibasic cleavage motif by deleting the PRRA insertion

136

(Del-PRRA), changing the last arginine to an alanine (R685A), or to a histidine (R685H) in order to

137

preserve the positive charge at this site (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting revealed that wild type and mutant PPs

138

were produced at similar levels (Fig. 1B). S1/S2 cleavage was observed for the wild type SARS-CoV-2

139

PPs and abrogated by the PRRA deletion and the R685A and R685H substitutions, which is in agreement

140

with studies showing that the SARS-CoV-2 S is cleaved by proprotein convertases, possibly furin (18,

141

19). Next, we assessed the infectivity of these viruses and found that the SARS-2-Del-PRRA and SARS-

142

2-R685A mutants were 5-10 fold more infectious on VeroE6 cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, on the lung

143

adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3 the SARS-2-Del-PRRA, SARS-2-R685A, and SARS-2-R685H PPs were

144

approximately 5-10 fold less infectious compared with the wild type PPs (Fig. 1D). These data show that

145

the PRRA deletion and single point mutations could functionally destroy the multibasic cleavage site and

146

suggest that this site enhances lung cell entry. Next, we assessed the effect of the multibasic cleavage

site in a relevant cell culture system, using airway organoids (21) that were dissociated, seeded onto

148

collagen coated Transwell inserts and differentiated for 10-11 weeks at air-liquid interface in Pneumacult

149

ALI medium (Stemcell). After differentiation, cultures contained ciliated cells, club cells and goblet cells

150

(Fig. S1A-C). Moreover, they expressed the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme

151

2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a serine protease previously shown to

152

mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry when overexpressed (Fig. S1D-E) (20). For infection experiments, the

153

differentiated pseudostratified epithelial layer was dissociated into small clumps, infected in suspension

154

and then re-plated into basement membrane extract (BME), in which it formed spheroids. SARS-CoV-2

155

PPs successfully infected airway spheroids, as observed by fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 1E). SARS-

156

CoV-2 PPs were approximately 2 times more infectious on these cells compared with the SARS-2-Del-

157

PRRA and SARS-2-R685A mutants, and 8 times more infectious than the SARS-2-R685H mutant (Fig.

158

1F), demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates entry into relevant human

159

airway cells.

160
161

SARS-CoV-2 enters Calu-3 cells faster than SARS-CoV and entry speed is increased by the

162

multibasic cleavage site. As SARS-CoV lacks the multibasic cleavage site, we compared its infectivity

163

to SARS-CoV-2 and found that both PPs readily infected Calu-3 cells, indicating that the SARS-CoV S

164

has adaptations other than the multibasic cleavage site to facilitate airway cell infection (Fig. 2A).

165

Likewise, inserting the PRRA motif into SARS-CoV S and thereby generating a multibasic cleavage site

166

did not increase PP infectivity on Calu-3 cells (Fig. S2). To investigate this further, we compared the entry

167

route taken by these viruses in Calu-3 cells. For this purpose, we used inhibitors of two major coronavirus

168

entry pathways (9). Serine proteases are known to mediate early coronavirus entry on the plasma

169

membrane or in the early endosome, whereas cathepsins facilitate entry in late, acidified endosomes.

170

Concentration ranges of either a serine protease inhibitor (camostat mesylate; hereafter referred to as

171

camostat) or a cathepsin inhibitor (E64D) were used to assess the entry route into Calu-3 cells. Entry of

172

SARS-CoV-2 PPs was not inhibited by E64D, but could be inhibited by camostat, indicating that SARS-

173

CoV-2 exclusively uses serine proteases for entry into these cells (Fig. 2B-C). For SARS-CoV PPs, entry

174

was inhibited slightly by E64D (~10%), but camostat had a far stronger effect (~90%), indicating that

175

SARS-CoV mainly uses serine proteases to enter Calu-3 cells but that a small fraction of virions enter via

176

cathepsins (Fig. 2B-C). Previously, Calu-3 cells have been suggested to have low levels of cathepsin

177

activity (16). The observation that some SARS-CoV PPs use cathepsins suggests that this virus less

178

efficiently uses the surface serine proteases encountered early during entry, resulting in particles

179

accumulating in the endosome, where they are cleaved by cathepsins. To test this, we measured the

180

serine protease-mediated entry rate of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by blocking entry on Calu-3 cells at

181

different time points post infection using camostat. Cells were pretreated with E64D to prevent any

182

cathepsin-mediated entry. Using both PPs and authentic virus (Fig. 2D-E) we observed that SARS-CoV-2

183

entered faster than SARS-CoV via serine proteases. Next, we assessed whether the presence of a

184

multibasic cleavage site could increase the serine protease-mediated entry rate into Calu-3 cells. For this

185

purpose, we used SARS-CoV S PPs containing the PRRA insertion (SARS-PRRA) (Fig. 2F).

186

Immunoblotting revealed that, in contrast to SARS-CoV PPs, SARS-PRRA PPs were partially cleaved

187

(Fig. 2G). Whereas wild type SARS-CoV PPs used cathepsins, SARS-PRRA PPs did not (Fig. 2H-I). The

188

serine protease-mediated entry rate of SARS-PRRA PPs on Calu-3 cells was higher compared with

189

SARS-CoV PPs (Fig. 2J), and it was lower for SARS-2-Del-PRRA PPs compared with SARS-CoV-2 PPs

190

(Fig. 2K). These findings show that the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates serine protease-

191

mediated entry on Calu-3 cells.

192
193

Cell-cell fusion is facilitated by the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site and SARS-CoV-2 is more

194

fusogenic than SARS-CoV on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. Next, we used a

195

GFP-complementation cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. S3) to determine whether entry rate was associated

196

with fusogenicity. In this assay, S and GFP-11 co-transfected HEK-293T cells fuse with GFP1-10

197

expressing Calu-3 cells, resulting in GFP complementation and fluorescence. In HEK-293T cells,

198

multibasic cleavage site containing S proteins were more cleaved than S proteins without this site (Fig.

199

3A). We observed that SARS-CoV-2 S was more fusogenic than SARS-CoV S on Calu-3 cells (Fig. 3B-C)

200

and in addition, the insertion of the multibasic cleavage site into SARS-CoV S increased fusion, whereas

201

mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S multibasic cleavage site decreased fusion. To investigate differences in

202

fusogenicity in a relevant cell system, we infected 2D differentiated organoid-derived human airway air-

203

liquid interface cultures with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and assessed the formation of syncytial cells

204

at 72 hours post infection using confocal microscopy. Cells were termed syncytial cells when at least two

205

nuclei were present within a single viral antigen positive cell that lacked demarcating tight junctions.

206

SARS-CoV-2 frequently induced syncytia, whereas SARS-CoV-infected cells rarely contained multiple

207

nuclei (Fig. 3D; and E for quantification).

208
209

The SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site increases serine protease usage and decreases

210

cathepsin usage. The findings above indicate that SARS-CoV-2 S is more fusogenic and mediates

211

faster entry through serine proteases compared with SARS-CoV, indicating that the multibasic cleavage

212

site alters protease usage. To investigate this, cells that contain both serine and cathepsin protease-

213

mediated entry should be used. Therefore, we focused on VeroE6 cells, which have an active cathepsin-

214

mediated cell entry pathway, as on these cells both SARS-CoV-2 PP and SARS-CoV PP entry was

215

blocked by E64D, and not by camostat (Fig. 4A-B). To generate a cell line in which both entry pathways

216

are active, we stably expressed TMPRSS2 in VeroE6 cells. In these cells, SARS-CoV-2 PP entry was

217

inhibited ~95% by camostat, whereas SARS-CoV PPs were only inhibited ~35% (Fig. 4C-D). In

218

accordance, E64D did not block SARS-CoV-2 PP entry, while it decreased SARS-CoV PP entry ~30%.

219

These findings indicate that despite a functional serine protease-mediated entry pathway, a significant

220

part of SARS-CoV PPs still retained cathepsin-mediated entry whereas SARS-CoV-2 PPs only used

221

serine proteases for entry. This phenotype was found to be linked to the multibasic cleavage site as

222

SARS-CoV-2 PPs containing mutations in this site entered less through serine proteases and more

223

through cathepsins (Fig. 4E-F). In accordance, the introduction of the multibasic cleavage site into SARS-

224

CoV PPs increased serine proteases usage, while decreasing cathepsin usage (Fig. 4G-H).

225
226

SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication is dependent on serine proteases in differentiated organoid-

227

derived human airway cells. Altogether, our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially uses serine

228

proteases for entry, when present, and that the multibasic cleavage site increases fusogenicity and

229

infection of human airway cells. Hence, serine protease inhibition could be an attractive therapeutic

230

option. Therefore, we assessed whether camostat could block SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication using

231

differentiated organoid-derived human airway spheroids. In these differentiated spheroids the apical side

232

of the cells was facing outwards (Fig. 5A-B), facilitating virus excretion into the culture medium. These

233

cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2, but pretreatment with

234

camostat efficiently blocked virus infection as evidenced by confocal microscopy on spheroids fixed at 16

235

hours post infection (Fig. 5A). Cathepsin inhibition did not affect entry. At 24 hours post infection, SARS-

236

CoV-2 infection spread in organoids treated with DMSO or E64D, but only rare single cells were observed

237

after camostat treatment (Fig. 5B). Next, we tested whether virus replication was affected by camostat

238

pretreatment of the airway spheroids. After infection at a MOI of 2, replication was assessed at 2, 24, and

239

48 hours post infection by RT-qPCR and live virus titration. In the control spheroids, SARS-CoV-2

240

replicated to high titers, while camostat reduced replication by approximately 90% (Fig. 5C-E). We also

241

tested the effect of camostat in 2D differentiated airway cultures at air-liquid interface using a low MOI of

242

0.1. Here, viral titers in apical washes did not increase after camostat pretreatment (Fig. 5F), whereas

243

replication to moderate titers was observed in the control wells. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2

244

utilizes serine proteases for efficient entry into relevant human airway cells and serine protease inhibition

245

decreases replication.

246
247

Discussion

248
249

SARS-CoV-2 harbors a remarkable multibasic cleavage site in its S protein. Recent findings show that

250

replacing this site with the SARS-CoV monobasic cleavage site decreases PP infectivity on the

251

adenocarcinoma cell line Calu-3, suggesting that this motif is a human airway adaptation (18). This raised

252

the question whether similar findings would be obtained in relevant lung cells. In this study, we found that

253

the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site alters tropism by increasing infectivity on differentiated

254

organoid-derived human airway spheroids. Furthermore, we report that the multibasic cleavage site

255

increases S protein fusogenicity, entry rate and serine protease usage. Blocking serine protease activity

256

in organoid-derived differentiated human airway spheroids using the clinically approved drug camostat

257

mesylate effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication, suggesting that serine protease-

258

mediated entry is the main entry route in vivo.

259
260

In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV does not contain a multibasic cleavage site, yet infects Calu-3

261

cells with similar efficiency. Introducing a multibasic cleavage site to SARS-CoV S did not increase

262

infectivity, indicating that the SARS-CoV S has other adaptations to enter airway cells. These data are in

263

agreement with a study that observed no benefit of furin cleavage on SARS-CoV infectivity (22). Whereas

264

SARS-CoV-2 appears to have adapted to increase fusogenicity and serine protease-mediated S

265

activation for rapid plasma membrane entry, SARS-CoV may have specific adaptations to enter these

266

cells more slowly. Slower viral dissemination may explain why most SARS-CoV patients entered the

267

infectious phase of the disease after symptom onset (23, 24). This could have played a role in the 2003

268

SARS-CoV epidemic, allowing strict public health interventions including quarantining of symptomatic

269

people and contact tracing to halt viral spread. For SARS-CoV-2, however, several studies have reported

270

that individuals can transmit the virus to others before they become symptomatic (25-29). Whether

271

differences in entry rate allow SARS-CoV-2 to spread more efficiently in the human airway compared with

272

SARS-CoV remains to be investigated. It will be interesting to assess this using authentic SARS-CoV-2

273

containing multibasic cleavage site mutations, which requires a reverse genetic system, not available to

274

this study at present. Whether cell-cell fusion also plays a role in virus dissemination needs to be

275

determined. In a cell-cell fusion assay and in organoid-derived human airway cells cultured at air-liquid

276

interface we show that SARS-CoV-2 is more fusogenic than SARS-CoV and that fusogenicity is

277

increased by the SARS-CoV-2 S multibasic cleavage site. The role of cell-cell fusion in coronavirus

278

transmission and pathogenesis has not been investigated in detail, but it could be a strategy to avoid

279

extracellular immune surveillance and may increase the viral dissemination rate in the airways in vivo.

280

Whether the multibasic cleavage site also affects entry into cells of other organs needs to be investigated

281

further. Although SARS-CoV-2 symptoms are mainly respiratory, recent reports indicate frequent

282

extrapulmonary manifestations, including but not limited to thrombotic complications, acute kidney injury,

283

gastrointestinal symptoms, and dermatologic complications (30). Of note, acute kidney injury was

284

uncommon during the SARS-CoV epidemic (31). It is unclear at this moment whether these

285

manifestations are the result of extrapulmonary viral replication.

286
287

Using VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells that have both active serine protease- and cathepsin-mediated entry

288

pathways, we show that the multibasic cleavage site increases serine protease-mediated S activation,

289

while decreasing cathepsin-mediated S activation. This indicates that the multibasic cleavage site could

290

be an adaptation to serine protease-mediated entry. Whether this site improves S activation by any

291

protease or by serine proteases specifically remains to be tested. Encountering serine proteases first may

292

result in more plasma membrane entry over endosomal entry. More efficient fusion of multibasic motif

293

containing S proteins may be caused by increased S2’ cleavage due to higher accessibility of a S1/S2

294

cleaved S compared with an uncleaved S. S1/S2 cleavage was recently shown to increase the binding of

295

S to ACE2 (32). Structural changes caused by S1/S2 cleavage may affect protease accessibility as well

296

and may increase subsequent S2’ cleavage.

297
298

While mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site decreased airway cell infectivity, they

299

increased infectivity on VeroE6 cells. Several groups have reported mutations or deletions in or around

300

the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site that arise in cell culture on VeroE6 cells (33-35), indicating that

301

the lack of a multibasic cleavage site creates a selective advantage in cell culture on VeroE6 cells. The

302

mechanism behind this remains unknown. The increased infectivity of multibasic cleavage site mutants

303

was not observed by Hoffmann and colleagues (2020), but in that study complete cleavage motifs

304

including four amino acids N-terminally from the minimal RXXR cleavage site were exchanged between

305

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (18). In contrast, we mutated single sites or removed/inserted only the

306

PRRA motif. Importantly, a cell culture adapted virus containing a complete deletion of the multibasic

307

cleavage site was recently shown to be attenuated in hamsters (35). These studies support our findings

308

that the SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site affects tropism, facilitates airway cell entry and show that

309

proper characterization of virus stocks is essential.

310
311

Entry inhibition has been proposed as an effective treatment option for SARS-CoV-2. Chloroquine can

312

block SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro into VeroE6 cells (36, 37), but does not block entry into

313

cells expressing serine proteases (Calu-3 and Vero-TMPRSS2) (38). This is expected, as chloroquine

314

acts in the endosome, while the endosomal entry pathway is not utilized in serine protease expressing

315

cells. As lung cells express serine proteases, inhibitors that block endosomal entry are likely to be

316

ineffective in vivo. These findings highlight that drug screens should be performed directly in relevant cells

317

to prevent wasting resources. Our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway spheroids

318

infected with a high MOI is inhibited ~90% by camostat, suggesting that this drug may be effective in vivo.

319

Future studies assessing the efficacy and safety of camostat in animal models should be conducted. For

320

SARS-CoV, camostat improved survival to 60% in a lethal mouse model (39). In the same study,

321

inhibition of cathepsins using a cysteine protease inhibitor was ineffective, supporting a critical role for

322

serine proteases in viral spread and pathogenesis in vivo. In Japan, camostat has been clinically

323

approved to treat chronic pancreatitis, and thus represents a potential therapy for respiratory coronavirus

324

infections.

325
326

Overall, our findings indicate that the multibasic cleavage motif in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein facilitates

327

serine protease-mediated airway cell entry, increasing pandemic potential. In addition, our findings using

328

authentic SARS-CoV-2 in a relevant human airway model suggest that serine protease inhibition is an

329

effective antiviral strategy, as either a therapy or prophylaxis.

361

interphase was 10-11 weeks. For this study, we used carefully dissected out bronchial material for the

362

generation of bronchial airway organoids. Bronchiolar organoids were generated from distal lung

363

parenchymal material. Tracheal stem cells were collected from tracheal aspirates of intubated preterm

364

infants (<28 weeks gestational age) (41) and cultured as described before (21). For the tracheal

365

aspirates, informed consent was obtained from parents and approval was given by the Medical Ethical

Authentic virus infection of primary airway cells

369

To assess differences in syncytium formation, 2D air-liquid interface differentiated airway cultures were

370

washed three times with 500 μL advanced DMEM/F12 (AdDF+++ , Gibco) before inoculation from the

371

apical side at a MOI of 1 in 200 μL AdDF+++ per well. Next, cultures were incubated at 37°C 5% CO 2 for

372

2 hours before washing 4 times in 500 μL AdDF+++. Cultures were washed daily from the apical side with

373

300 μL AdDF+++ to facilitate virus spread. At 72 hours post infection, cells were fixed for

374

immunofluorescent staining.

375
376

To determine the effect of camostat on SARS-CoV-2 entry, we incubated bronchial or bronchiolar cultures

377

that were differentiated at air-liquid interface for 10-11 weeks with 100% dispase in the basal

378

compartment of a 12 mm Transwell insert. After a 10 minute incubation step at 37°C 5% CO 2, dispase

379

was removed and cold 500 μL AdDF+++ was pipetted onto the apical side of the Transwell to dislodge

380

the pseudostratified epithelial layer, which was subsequently mechanically sheared by pipetting using a

381

P1000 tip. The resulting epithelial fragments were washed twice in 5 ml AdDF+++ before treatment with

382

10μM camostat, 10μM E64D or carrier (DMSO) in Pneumacult (PC) ALI medium (Stemcell) on ice for 1

383

hour. Next, fragments were infected at a MOI of 2 for 2 hours at 37°C 5% CO2 in the presence of

384

inhibitors or DMSO. Subsequently, fragments were washed three times in 5 ml cold AdDF+++ before

385

being embedded in 30 μL BME (Type 2; R&D Systems) per well in a 48-well plate. Approximately 200000

386

cells were plated per well. After solidification of the BME, 200 μL PC was added per well and plates were

387

incubated at 37°C 5% CO2.

389

To assess SARS-CoV-2 replication in the presence of camostat, bronchiolar airway spheroids or 2D air-

390

liquid interface differentiated tracheal airway cultures were infected as described above. For spheroids,

391

culture medium was collected at the indicated time points and frozen at -80°C. After culture medium

392

collection, BME droplets containing spheroids were resuspended in 200 μL AdDF+++ and samples were

393

frozen at -80°C to lyse the cells. To assess 2D air-liquid interface differentiated airway culture replication

394

kinetics, apical washes were collected at the indicated time points by adding 200 μL AdDF+++ apically,

395

incubating for 15 minutes at 37°C 5% CO2 and collecting the sample before storage at -80°C. For virus

396

titrations using RT-qPCR (38) or TCID50 determination, samples were thawed and centrifuged at 500 x g

416

and deparaffinized as described before prior to staining (42). Samples were imaged on a LSM700

GFP-complementation fusion assay

427

HEK-293T cells were grown in 6-well format to 70-80% confluency and were transfected with 1.5 μg

428

pGAGGS-spike (all coronavirus S variants described above) DNA and pGAGGS-β-Actin-P2A-7xGFP11-

429

BFP DNA or empty vector DNA with PEI in a ratio of 1:3 (DNA:PEI). Beta-actin was tagged with 7xGFP11

430

expressed in tandem and blue fluorescent protein (BFP). The two genes were separated by a P2A self-

431

cleaving peptide. Two variants of this construct were used. One variant contained a GSG linker located

432

N-terminally from the P2A site to improve self-cleavage and this construct was used in qualitative

433

confocal microscopy experiments. A variant lacking the GSG linker was less efficiently cleaved as

434

indicated by both cytoplasmic and nuclear localized GFP, but this generated an equal distribution of GFP

435

throughout the cell and therefore it was used for all fusion assays in which the sum of all GFP+ pixels

436

was calculated. Transfected HEK-293T cells were incubated overnight at 37°C 5% CO2. GFP1-10

437

expressing cells were seeded in a 12-well plate to achieve 90-100% confluency after overnight incubation

438

at 37°C 5% CO2 and medium was refreshed with Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX. HEK-293T cells were

439

resuspended in PBS by pipetting to generate a single cell suspension and added to GFP1-10 expressing

440

cells in a ratio of 1:80 (HEK-293T cells : GFP1-10 expressing cells). Fusion events were quantified by

Coronavirus S pseudotyped particle production

452

For the production of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S PPs, as well as multibasic cleavage site mutant

453

PPs, HEK-293T cells were transfected with 15 µg S expression plasmids. Twenty-four hours post-

454

transfection, the medium was replaced for Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX, and cells were infected at a MOI

455

of 1 with VSV-G PPs. Two hours post-infection, cells were washed three times with Opti-MEM I (1X) +

456

GlutaMAX and replaced with medium containing anti-VSV-G neutralizing antibody (clone 8G5F11;

457

Absolute Antibody) at a dilution of 1:50000 to block remaining VSV-G PPs. The supernatant was

458

collected after 24 hours, cleared by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 5 minutes and stored at 4°C until use

459

within 7 days. Coronavirus S PPs were titrated on VeroE6 cells as described in the supplementary

460

information (SI) appendix.

Entry speed assay

470

Calu-3 cells were seeded as for entry route assays and pre-treated with 10µM E64D. After one hour, PPs

471

were added per well to achieve 1000 infected cells in the control well. At the same time as addition of

472

PPs, 10µM camostat was added into the first set of wells (t=0). DMSO was added to controls. The same

473

inhibitor was added in the next sets of wells in triplicate 2, 4 and 6 hours post infection. Plates were

474

incubated overnight at 37°C 5% CO2 before scanning for GFP signal as described above.

475
476

Authentic virus entry speed was performed in the same manner, by infecting Calu-3 cells with 1x104

477

TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 and 5x104 TCID50 SARS-CoV. After 12 hours, plates were fixed and blocked as

478

above for transwell inserts. Cells were incubated with mouse-anti-double stranded RNA (Clone J2, 1:500,

479

Scicons) in blocking buffer for 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed twice

480

with PBS and stained with Alexa488 conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 Invitrogen) in blocking buffer

481

for an hour at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed twice with PBS and scanned in PBS on the

487

at 4°C in Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX to achieve 100-fold concentration. PPs were titrated and aliquots

Figure 3. The SARS-CoV-2 multibasic cleavage site facilitates cell-cell fusion and SARS-CoV-2 is
more fusogenic than SARS-CoV on differentiated organoid-derived human airway cells. (A) Proteolytic
cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV S, and S mutants was assessed by overexpression in HEK-293T
cells and subsequent western blots for S1. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (B and C) Fusogenicity of
SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV S, and S mutants was assessed after 18 hours by counting the number of nuclei
per syncytium (B) and by measuring the sum of all GFP+ pixels per well (C). Statistical analysis was
performed by one-way ANOVA on SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated fusion compared with its
respective mutants. * P<0.05 (C). (D) Differentiated airway cultures were infected at a MOI of 1 with SARSCoV or SARS-CoV-2. 72 hours post infection they were fixed and stained for nucleoprotein (NP; green) and
tight junctions (ZO1; red) to image syncytia. Nuclei were stained with hoechst (blue). Scale bars indicate 20
μm. Arrows indicate syncytial cells. (E) Percentage of syncytial cells of total number of infected cells per field
of 0.1 square mm. 5 fields were counted. T-test was performed for statistical analysis. * P<0.05. Error bars
indicate SEM. Experiments were performed in triplicate (C). Representative experiments from at least two
independent experiments are shown.
