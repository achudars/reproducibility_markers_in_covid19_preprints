Abstract

33

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as an

34

international health emergency. Current diagnostic tests are based on the reverse transcription-

35

quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method, the gold standard test that involves the

36

amplification of viral RNA. However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and

37

quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low

38

amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied

39

according to the sequence of primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as

40

templates, whereas the copy number of viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT

41

RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were

42

assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be significantly higher

43

than RT-qPCR. These findings suggest that ddPCR could be used as a highly sensitive and compatible

44

diagnostic method for viral RNA detection.

Introduction

60

Coronaviruses have caused several notable respiratory disease outbreaks in humans, such as severe

61

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS coronavirus was the first fatal pathogenic human

62

coronavirus to be identified and caused 8,096 infections and 774 deaths in 26 countries (“WHO |

63

Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003,”

64

2015). Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV, only two HCoVs (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) were

65

known, both of which caused mild respiratory symptoms (Fung & Liu, 2019). Bats were the natural

66

hosts of SARS-CoV and civet cats were regarded as the intermediate host (Li et al., 2006). Extensive

67

studies on bat coronaviruses showed that such coronaviruses could be potential human pathogens (Ge

68

et al., 2013; Wu, Peng, Wilken, Geraghty, & Li, 2012). MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and

69

caused 2,494 infections and 858 deaths in 27 countries as of November 2019 (“WHO | Middle East

70

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),” in press). MERS-CoV also originated from bat

71

coronaviruses and camels were the intermediate host (Ashour, Elkhatib, Rahman, & Elshabrawy,

72

2020).

73

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the WHO China Country Office was informed

74

of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, on December 31st, 2019

75

(World Health Organization (WHO), 2020). The novel coronavirus, currently termed SARS-CoV-2,

76

was officially announced as the causative agent by the International Committee on Taxonomy of

77

Viruses (ICTV) (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses,

78

2020; Gorbalenya, 2020). SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has

79

resulted in 2,114,269 laboratory-confirmed cases and 145,144 deaths as of April 17th, 2020 (da Costa,

80

Moreli, & Saivish, 2020). A viral genome sequence was released for immediate public health support

81

via the community online resource virological.org on January 10th (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession

82

number MN908947) (Li et al., 2006), followed by four other genomes that were deposited on January

83

12th in the viral sequence database curated by the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data

84

(GISAID). The genome sequences suggest the virus is closely related to the members of a viral

85

species termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV, a species defined by the agent

86

of the 2002/03 outbreak of SARS in humans (Ge et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012). The species also

87

comprises of a large number of viruses mostly detected in rhinolophid bats in Asia and Europe.

88

For the past several decades, quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) have become the gold

89

standard for quantifying relative gene expressions. On the other hand, the recently developed digital

90

polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) enables the highly sensitive measurement and absolute quantitation

91

of nucleic acids (Hindson et al., 2011, 2013). dPCR does not require calibration with qualified

92

standards for comparison. However, DNA or RNA quantities should be metrologically traceable to a

93

reference (Bhat & Emslie, 2016; Whale et al., 2018). As of this writing, multiple nucleic acid

94

quantitation methods have been developed, such as chemical analysis methods based on isotope-

95

dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), capillary electrophoresis (CE), and enumeration-based flow

96

cytometric method (FCM) counting (Kwon, Jeong, Bae, Choi, & Yang, 2019; Yoo et al., 2016). These

97

methods can be accurately calibrated with solutions of nucleic acids. In addition, an international

98

comparison study was performed between national metrology institutes (NMI) using the dPCR

99

method (Corbisier et al., 2012). Recently, the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method has emerged as a

100

powerful analytical technique for clinical utility (Miotke, Lau, Rumma, & Ji, 2014; Pinheiro et al.,

101

2012). For example, ddPCR can be used for the rapid enumeration of viral genomes and particles

102

(Americo, Earl, & Moss, 2017; Hayden et al., 2013; Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2019).

103

In the present case of SARS-CoV-2, virus isolates or samples from infected patients have yet to be

104

made available to the international public health community. In this study, we conclude that optimized

105

conditions are required to increase the precision of ddPCR to develop reference materials with matrix

conditions.

142

strain KNIH/002_05_2015 (Kim et al., 2016) was obtained from KNIH and inoculated into cultured

143

Huh-7 Cells. After 3 days of incubation, the viral RNA was extracted from the culture medium using

144

the QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's

145

instructions. Human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture

146

147

supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% Sodium Pyruvate, 1%

148

penicillin, and 1% non-essential amino acids. The cell lines were cultured in a T75 flask in a

149

humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The subcultures were produced with a ratio of 1:2 when

150

the cell confluency reached 80%–90% every 3 or 4 days. HCoV OC43 (ATCC VR1588) was obtained

151

from ATCC and was inoculated into a virus growth medium (MEM with 2% heat-inactivated FBS, 1%

152

penicillin, and 1% non-essential amino acids) and propagated to the MRC-5 cells with 90%

153

confluence. The flasks were maintained at 33 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. When the

154

cells reached 50%-60% confluence, the supernatant was harvested, filtered, and stored at -80 °C

Primer and probes

170

The primer-probe sets used in this study are listed in Table 1. For the detection of SARS-CoV-2,

171

primer-probe sets of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA), The University of

172

Hong Kong (HKU, Hong Kong), the National Institute of Infectious Disease Department of Virology

173

III (NIID, Japan), and the National Institute of Health (NIH, Thailand) were selected according to

174

laboratory guidance from WHO (Jung et al., 2020). The specific primer-probe sets for MERS-CoV

175

and OC43 were used for the quantification of the viral RNA genomes (Corman et al., 2012; Vijgen et

176

al., 2005). All primers and probes were synthesized by Neoprobe (Daejeon, Korea). All probes were

177

labeled with the reporter molecule 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5'-end and with the quencher

cDNA synthesis of viral RNA genomes

181

The cDNAs of the clinical and cultured (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and OC43) viral

182

RNA genomes were synthesized using the LunaScript RT SuperMix Kit (New England Biolabs,

Ipswich, MA, USA). The reaction mixture had a volume of 20 µL and comprised of 4 µL of 5X

184

LunaScript RT supermix, 1 µL of cDNA template, and 15 µL of distilled water. The reactions were

185

carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The synthesized cDNAs were serially diluted

195

(BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The reaction mixture had a volume of 20 µL and

196

comprised of 10 µL of ddPCR supermix for probes (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA),

201

Data analysis

202

The qPCR data were initially analyzed using the StepOne software (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

203

Waltham, MA, USA). Raw data (i.e., the fluorescence values for CT) were exported from the StepOne

204

software to Microsoft Excel 2016. A series of diluted templates were used to determine the CT value,

205

which can establish a standard curve for evaluating the reaction efficiency. Droplet fluorescence data

206

were initially analyzed using the QuantaSoft software (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

207

Raw data (i.e., the fluorescence values for the droplets) were exported from the QuantaSoft software

208

to Microsoft Excel 2016. Depending on the separation of positive and negative droplets, an objective

209

separation value k was automatically calculated.

Quantification of viral and IVT RNAs

213

In this study, the primer-probe sets of each E gene were used to quantify the viral genomic RNA of

214

SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses (Table 1) (Corman et al., 2012, 2020a; Jung et al., 2020;

215

Vijgen et al., 2005). The clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients with symptoms are

216

summarized in Table 2.

217

The copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, and OC43 viral RNA were measured using

218

ddPCR, and the measured values of viral genomic RNA were 8.04 x 105, 6.52 x 105, 9.37 x 104 and

219

9.57 x 104 copies/µL, respectively (Table 3). To assess the quantification of viral genomic RNA and

220

partial synthetic viral RNA, in vitro transcript (IVT) N and E gene RNA were measured via qPCR and

221

ddPCR. The copy numbers of N IVT RNA and E IVT RNA were measured as 1.8 x 109 and 3.47 x 109,

222

respectively. The amplification efficiencies were calculated from standard curves of SARS-CoV-2

223

viral RNA and IVT RNAs.

224
225

IVT RNAs as a standard for RT-qPCR

226

The R2 values of viral RNA and IVT N IVT RNA were calculated as 0.9973 and 0.9987, respectively,

227

whereas the R2 values of viral RNA and IVT E IVT RNA were calculated as 0.9956 and 0.9993,

228

respectively (Tables 3 and 4). These values indicate that the standard curves of both viral and IVT

229

RNAs are linear and accurate. The amplification efficiency of both viral and IVT RNAs were

230

calculated from the slopes of the standard curves. The efficiencies of both viral and IVT RNAs

231

according to the target genes were similar (Tables 3 and 4). The similar amplification efficiencies

232

show that the quantified IVT RNA can be used as a standard for RT-qPCR measurement of viral RNA.

233
234

Comparison of qPCR and ddPCR assays for COVID-19 clinical samples

235

According to the qPCR and ddPCR results, all patient samples were positive when we used 0.1 ng of

236

extracted RNA for the template. The non-template control did not produce any signals from both the

237

qPCR and ddPCR assays. The result of the serially diluted sample showed that the CT value was

238

undetermined. On the other hand, all ddPCR signals were detected in all of the diluted samples (Table

239

5). Furthermore, the positive copies (P2 for 0.67 and P3 for 0.60) from the two samples were

240

exceptionally low compared to the other specimens, but still only produced positive signals in the

241

ddPCR results. This suggests that the ddPCR method can be applied to detect ultra-low amounts of

242

sample with high sensitivity.

Discussion

245

The outbreak of COVID-19 is a pandemic threat caused by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a newly

246

discovered human coronavirus (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has four structural

247

proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins (Walls

248

et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with

249

high-affinity, which leads to clinical features of pneumonia in many patients (Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhu

250

et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has quickly spread across the world, which

251

further emphasizes the essential role of diagnostics in the control of communicable diseases (Winter

252

& Hegde, 2020).

253

Currently, a reliable test (also the most widely used) for detecting acute infections of SARS-CoV-2 is

254

the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method (Lu et al., 2020).

255

Multiple national laboratories have developed assays targeting conserved regions that could

256

potentially detect pan-sarbecovirus (Chu et al., 2020; Corman et al., 2020b). A previous study

257

provided information such as the specific primer and probe sequence, thermal profile, and reagents for

258

RT-qPCR to optimize the reaction conditions for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Bustin, 2020).

259

ddPCR is a method that improves upon conventional PCR methods that can individually amplify and

260

directly quantify pathogen RNA or DNA (Li et al., 2018). Several studies have compared RT-qPCR

261

and ddPCR for the quantification of viral genomes (Abachin et al., 2018; Dobnik et al., 2019;

262

Kiselinova et al., 2014).

263

In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were measured using the qPCR and ddPCR

264

methods (Table 3). The qPCR results showed that the CT value of a given template was greatly

265

dependent on the individual primer-probe sets. However, the copy numbers determined via ddPCR

266

were stable and reliable in the quantification of low-viral RNA samples, regardless of the primer-

267

probe sets. A previous study reported that qPCR and ddPCR results were consistent for 95 positive

268

samples and that there was a high correlation between the CT values of qPCR and the copy number

269

values of ddPCR among patient samples (Yu et al., 2020). Although the CT values of each primer-

270

probe set exhibited variance, the copy numbers from ddPCR showed that N genes are more abundant

271

than E genes. These findings are also consistent with another previous study, indicating N genes are

272

good targets for diagnostics (Kim et al., 2020).

273

The qPCR method requires the use of a standard curve to obtain quantitative measurements of an

274

unknown sample (Adamski, Gumann, & Baird, 2014). However, in the case of ddPCR, the

275

distribution of target-specific amplification into partitions is calculated using the Poisson distribution,

276

enabling the absolute quantification of the target gene based on the ratio of positive against all

277

partitions at the end of the reaction without dependence on an external standard (Gutiérrez-Aguirre,

278

Rački, Dreo, & Ravnikar, 2015). In addition to these advantages, our results revealed that ddPCR is a

279

more sensitive and accurate method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral copies (Table 5). Further

280

experiments should be performed even if patients are cured of COVID-19, and such tests should be

281

conducted using ddPCR to lower the limit of detection (LOD) to be able to detect low amounts of

282

viral RNA.

283

The Coronavirus Standards Working Group led by the Joint Initiative for Metrology in Biology (JIMB)

284

is conducting international collaborative experiments to develop guidelines for the purpose of

285

evaluating and establishing the availability of common and appropriate standards, diverse reference

286

materials, validation tests, and reference measurement protocols that can enable reliable COVID-19

287

testing (“Coronavirus Standards Working Group — The Joint Initiative for Metrology in Biology,” in

288

press; “ISO - COVID-19 response: freely available ISO standards,” in press). Our results serve as a

289

guide for the standardization of analytical methods and the development of reference materials that

290

are required for accurate COVID-19 diagnosis based on both RT-qPCR and ddPCR. Consequently,

291

ddPCR-based diagnostics can serve as a companion method to the current standard RT-qPCR to

292

provide sensitive and accurate quantitative results for emergency testing that can be adopted for

293

clinical use.

294
295

Conclusion

296

Our study demonstrated that CT values of samples from qPCR assays were significantly variable

297

depending on the sequence of primer and probe sets, whereas copy numbers of samples from ddPCR

298

assays were hardly affected by the sequence of primer and probe sets. These results indicate that

299

ddPCR can be performed with sub-optimal primer-probe sets without the loss of sensitivity. A

300

comparison of the standard curves of viral RNA and IVT RNA showed that IVT RNA quantified via

301

ddPCR could be used as a standard for the absolute quantification of qPCR assays. The results from

302

the clinical samples showed that the ddPCR method could result in highly sensitive and quantitative

303

diagnostics. Although qPCR produced different CT values using different primer-probes sets, the

304

ddPCR results obtained using different primer-probe sets were compatible with each other. Therefore,

305

the deployment of ddPCR-based diagnostics could produce highly sensitive and quantitative results

306

that are compatible between different laboratories.
