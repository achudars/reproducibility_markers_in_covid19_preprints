Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human cells upon
binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to ACE2 receptors and causes the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly
focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not
well understood. By performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified
an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen
bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis
of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average
work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as
the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking this
site via neutralizing antibody or nanobody could prove an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2
interactions.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is a positive-sense single-stranded
RNA betacoronavirus. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 genome
shares ~79% sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV), and ~52% with the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)1.
Despite these similarities, SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious and fatal than SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV together2.
SARS-CoV-2 consists of a 30 kb single-stranded RNA genome that is encapsulated by a lipid
bilayer and three distinct structural proteins that are embedded within the lipid membrane:
envelope (E), membrane (M), and spike (S). Host cell entry is primarily mediated by
homotrimeric S glycoproteins located on the viral membrane (Fig. 1a)3. Each S protomer
consists of S1 and S2 subunits that mediate binding to the host cell receptor and fusion of the
viral envelope, respectively3, 4. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes a large
rigid body motion to bind to ACE2. In the closed state, all RBDs of the S trimer are in the down
position, and the binding surface is inaccessible to ACE2. The switching of one of the RBDs
into a semi-open intermediate state is sufficient to expose the ACE2 binding surface and
stabilize the RBD in its up position (Fig. 1b)5.
The S protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a
homodimeric integral membrane protein expressed in the epithelial cells of lungs, heart,
kidneys, and intestines6. Each ACE2 protomer consists of an N-terminal peptidase domain
(PD), which interacts with the RBD of the S protein through an extended surface (Fig. 1a, c)6,
7, 8

. Upon ACE2 binding, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by the serine protease TMPRSS2

separates the S1 and S2 subunits9. The S2 protein exposes fusion peptides that insert into the
host membrane and promote fusion with the viral membrane4.
To prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a global effort to design neutralizing antibodies10,
nanobodies11, peptide inhibitors12, and small molecules13 that target the ACE2 binding surface
of the S protein. Yet, only a limited number of studies were performed to investigate critical
interactions that facilitate S-ACE2 binding using MD simulations. Initial studies have
constructed a homology model of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2, based on the
SARS-CoV crystal structure8, 14 and performed conventional MD (cMD) simulations totaling
10 ns15, 16 and 100 ns17, 18 in length to estimate binding free energies15, 16 and interaction scores18.
More recent studies used the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2 to
perform coarse-grained19 and all-atom20, 21, 22, 23 MD simulations. The effect of the mutations

that disrupt close contact residues between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 on binding free
energy was investigated by post-processing of the MD trajectories15,

16, 21, 22

or by using

bioinformatic methods20. The work required to unbind the S protein from ACE2 would provide
a more accurate estimate of the binding strength, but this has not been performed under low
pulling velocities using the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with ACE2. In addition,
systematic analysis of critical residues that stabilize S-ACE2 binding and how mutagenesis of
these interaction sites reduces the binding strength and alters the way the S protein detaches
from ACE2 under force have not yet been performed.
In this study, we performed a comprehensive set of all-atom MD simulations totaling 16.5 µs
in length using the recently-solved structure of the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in
complex with the PD of ACE27. Simulations were performed in the absence and presence of
external force to investigate the binding characteristics and estimate the binding strength. These
simulations showed additional interactions between RBD and PD domains to those observed in
the crystal structure7. An extensive set of alanine substitutions and charge reversal mutations of
the RBD amino acids involved in ACE2 binding were performed to quantify how mutagenesis
of these residues weaken binding in the presence and absence of force in simulations. We
showed that the hydrophobic end of RBD primarily stabilizes S-ACE2 binding, and targeting
this site could potentially serve as an effective strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Results
Interaction sites between the S protein and ACE2. To model the dynamic interactions of the
S-ACE2 binding interface, we used the co-structure of RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in
complex with the PD of human ACE27 (Fig. 1c). The structure was solvated in a water box that
contains physiologically-relevant salt (150 mM NaCl) concentration. Two sets of cMD
simulations, each of 100 ns in length, were performed to determine the formation of a salt
bridge24 and a hydrogen bond, as well as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between
RBD and PD (Supplementary Table 1). A cutoff distance of 6 Å between the basic nitrogens
and acidic oxygens was used to score a salt bridge formation24. For hydrogen bond formation,
a maximum 3.5 Å distance between hydrogen bond donor and acceptor and a 30° angle between
the hydrogen atom, the donor heavy atom, and the acceptor heavy atom was used25. Interaction
pairs that satisfy the distance, but not the angle criteria were analyzed as electrostatic
interactions. For hydrophobic interactions, a cutoff distance of 8 Å between the side chain
carbon atoms was used26,

27, 28

. Using these criteria, we identified eleven hydrophobic

interactions (Fig. 2a), eight hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2b), two salt bridges and six electrostatic
interactions (Fig. 2c) between RBD and PD. Observation frequencies were classified as high

and moderate for interactions that occur in 49% and above and between 15-48% of the total
trajectory, respectively. F486 and Y489 of RBD formed hydrophobic interactions with F28,
L79, M82, and Y83 of PD, while L455, F456, Y473, and A475 of RBD formed hydrophobic
interactions with T27 of PD at high frequencies (Fig. 2d). Salt bridges between K417-D30
(RBD-PD) and E484-K31, and hydrogen bonds between N487-Y83, T500-D355, and Q493E35 were observed at high frequencies, whereas hydrogen bonds Y449-D38, Q498-K353,
T500-Y41, Y505-E37, and Q493-E35 were observed at moderate frequencies (Fig. 2d).
Residue pairs Y453-H34, N487-Q24, T500-Y41, N501-K353, Q493-K31, and Y449-Q42
exhibited electrostatic interactions throughout the simulations (Fig. 2d).
The interaction network we identified in our cMD simulations were mostly consistent with
reported interactions in the RBD-PD crystal structure7. However, our simulations identified
four hydrogen bonds (Q498-K353, T500-D355, Y505-E37, and Q498-Q42), one hydrophobic
interaction (L455-T27), and two electrostatic interactions (Y453-H34 and N501-K353) that are
not present in the crystal structure. In turn, we did not detect frequent hydrogen bonding
between G446-Q42, G502-K353, and Y505-R393 and an electrostatic interaction between
G496-K353 observed in the crystal structure7. This discrepancy may be due to radically
different thermodynamic conditions between crystallization solutions and cMD simulations29.
We divided the RBD-PD interaction surface into three contact regions (CR1-3, Fig 2A-C)23.
The contact region 2 (CR2) comprised significantly fewer interactions than the ends of the RBD
binding surface (CR1 and CR3). Remarkably, 10 out of 13 interactions we detected in CR1
were hydrophobic, which were proposed to play a central role in anchoring of RBD to PD23.
Unlike CR1, CR2 formed only a single hydrophobic interaction with PD, whereas CR3 did not
form any hydrophobic interactions.
Unbinding of the S protein from ACE2 under force. To estimate the binding strength of the
S protein to ACE2, we performed steered MD (SMD) simulations to pull RBD away from PD
at a constant velocity of 2 Å 𝑛𝑠 −1 along the vector pointing away from the binding interface
(Fig. 3a). Steering forces were applied to the Cα atoms of the RBD residues on the binding
interface, whereas Cα atoms of PD residues at the binding interface were kept fixed. These
simulations were also repeated in the absence of ACE2 to account for the work done against
viscous drag of water (Supplementary Fig. 1). The calculated average work against viscous
drag was subtracted from all SMD work values reported in this study. Because part of the work
applied is lost to the irreversible processes as we pull RBD away from PD at a finite velocity,
the second law of thermodynamics indicates that unbinding free energy difference between the
initial and final states cannot be larger than the average work required for unbinding. Therefore,

our calculations report relative changes in the binding free energy of wild-type (WT) and mutant
RBD under the same velocity and thermodynamic conditions. In 20 SMD simulations (each 15
ns, totaling 300 ns in length, Supplementary Table 1), the average work applied to unbind
SARS-CoV-2 RBD from PD was 64.0 ± 6.0 kcal/mol (mean ± s.d.), demonstrating that the S
protein binds stably to ACE2 (Fig. 3b).
Mutagenesis of the S-ACE2 binding interface. To investigate the contribution of each of the
16 interactions we identified to the overall binding strength, we introduced point mutations on
the RBD. Salt bridges were eliminated by charge reversals (K417E and E484K). We also
replaced each interaction amino acid (except A475) with alanine (Supplementary Table 1) to
disrupt the pairwise interactions30, with minimal perturbations the protein backbone31. Two sets
of cMD simulations (a total of 3.4 µs in length) were performed for each point mutant. We first
quantified the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the Cα atom of the RBD residues located
on the PD binding surface (Fig. 3c). The rigid body motions were eliminated by aligning the
RBD interaction surface of PD for each conformer (see Methods). 13 out of 17 mutations
increased the residue fluctuations compared to WT (Supplementary Fig. 2a), suggesting that
disrupting the interactions between RBD and PD results in floppier binding. Largest
fluctuations were observed for 2 mutations in CR1 (F486A, and N487A), 2 mutations in CR3
(Y449A and Y505A) and 1 mutation in CR2 (L455A) (Fig. 3c). Mutation of these residues also
increased the fluctuations in their neighboring region. While mutations in CR1 increased
fluctuations in CR3 significantly, mutations in CR3 had little to no effect on the fluctuations in
CR1 (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 2b).
We next performed SMD simulations modeling the unbinding of RBD of each point mutant
from PD (20 simulations for each mutant, a total of 5.1 µs in length, Supplementary Table 1).
F486A, Y489A, N487A, Y473A, E484K and Y505A mutations decreased the work
requirement to unbind RBD-PD by 9-15% (Fig. 3e, f and Supplementary Fig. 3). We note that
most of these mutations also led to the largest increase in residue fluctuations on the binding
surface (Fig. 3c). 5 of these residues (F486, Y489, N487, Y473, and E484) are located in CR1,
whereas Y505 is located in CR3. These results highlight the primary role of hydrophobic
interactions in CR1 to stabilize the S-ACE2 binding.
To further characterize critical interactions of the S-ACE2 binding interface, we introduced
double mutants to neighboring residues of RBD that form critical interactions with PD. We
performed a total of 2.8 µs of cMD and 4.2 µs of SMD simulations for 14 double mutants
(Supplementary Table 1). In particular, double mutants in CR1 resulted in 4 out of the 6 highest
increase in RMSF (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 2). The F486A/N487A mutation at CR1

resulted in the largest increase in fluctuations in both CR1 and CR3 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 2). In SMD simulations, 12 out of 14 double mutations also further decreased the average
work to unbind RBD from PD (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 4). Similar to the RMSF
analysis, double mutants in CR1 (F486A/N487A, E484A/Y489A, E484A/F486A, and
L455A/F456A) resulted in 4 out of the 6 largest decreases in average work (Fig. 4d). A charge
reversal of K417E in combination with either Q493A or Y453A also resulted in a large decrease
in work values (Fig. 4d). We also used Jarzynski equality32, 33 to construct the free energy
profiles as a function of a reaction coordinate, referred to as the potential of mean force (PMF)34.
Based on the estimated PMF (Supplementary Fig. 5), double mutants in CR1 resulted in the
largest decrease in the binding energy by 31-21% compared to WT. Collectively, these results
show that two salt bridges (E484-K31 and K417-D30) and the network of hydrophobic
interactions in CR1 involving F486, Y489, Y473 and F456 residues are the most significant
contributors of binding strength between the S protein and ACE2.
The hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site for ACE2 binding. To test
whether CR1 anchors RBD to PD23, we investigated the order of events that result in
detachment of RBD from PD in SMD simulations. The unbinding process appears to perform
a zipper-like detachment starting from CR3 and ending at CR1 in 85% of the simulations (Fig.
5a). In only 15% of the simulations, CR3 released last from PD (Fig. 5a). Because unbinding
simulations can reveal features characteristic for the reverse process of binding35, 36, 37, 38, 39,
these results suggest that CR1 binding is the first and critical event for the S protein binding to
ACE2. Mutagenesis of the critical residues in CR1, in general, resulted in a substantial decrease
in the percentages of unbinding events that terminate with the release of CR1 from PD. In
alanine replacement of the hydrophobic residues (F486A, F487, and Y489), CR1 was released
last for 60%, 55%, and 65% of the SMD simulations, respectively (Fig. 5b). The probability of
CR1 to release last under force was further reduced in double mutants of E484A/F486A (50%)
and L455A/F456A (55%) (Fig. 5b). Unlike these mutants, F456A and E484K mutants in CR1
increased the probability of CR1 to release last, but this could be attributed to a large increase
in fluctuations in CR3 upon these mutations (Supplementary Fig. 2b). These results indicate
that single and double mutants of the critical residues in CR1 substantially reduce the binding
free energy of this region to ACE2.
S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have similar binding strength to ACE2. It
remains unclear whether higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV can be attributed
to stronger interactions between S and ACE2 in SARS-CoV-22, 15. To test this possibility, we
performed two sets of MD simulations for the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein bound to the PD

of ACE2 (PDB ID: 2AJF8), and compared these results to that of SARS-CoV-2. Similar to
SARS-CoV-2, RBD of SARS-CoV makes an extensive network of interactions with PD. We
identified eleven hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 6a), six hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6b), and seven
electrostatic interactions (Fig. 6c). Out of these 15 interactions, only 6 are conserved in SARSCoV and the following mutations have taken place: L443/F456 (SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2),
F460/Y473, P462/A475, P470/E484, L472/F486 V404/K417, N479/Q493, Y484/Q498, and
T487/N501. Similar to SARS-CoV-2, L472 and Y475 of SARS-CoV RBD formed a total of
seven hydrophobic interactions at a high frequency with the hydrophobic pocket of ACE2 (Fig.
6d). Unlike SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV RBD did not form any salt bridges with ACE2.
We next modeled the unbinding of RBD of SARS-CoV from PD by performing 20 SMD
simulations (totaling 300 ns in length, Supplementary Table 1). The average total unbinding
work of SARS-CoV (64.5 ± 12.2 kcal/mol, mean ± s.d., Fig. 6e) was identical but more broadly
distributed than that of SARS-CoV-2 (64.0 ± 6.0 kcal/mol, Fig. 3b). Unlike SARS-CoV-2, CR1
released last from PD in only 40% of the unbinding events of RBD of SARS-CoV, whereas the
unbinding of CR3 was the last event in the remaining 60% (Fig. 6f). These results indicate that
the S protein binds stably to ACE2 in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and the higher
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be explained by an increase in binding strength. Higher
variability in unbinding work values and the absence of a clear order in unbinding events of
RBD of SARS-CoV suggest that SARS-CoV has a more variable binding mechanism to ACE2
than SARS-CoV-2.
Discussion
We performed an extensive set of in silico analysis to identify critical residues that facilitate
binding of the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the human ACE2 receptor. Mutagenesis
of these residues and pulling the RBD away from PD at a low velocity enabled us to estimate
the free energy of binding and the order of events that result in the unbinding of RBD from PD.
Our simulations showed that the PD interacting surface of RBD can be divided into three
contact regions (CR1-3). Hydrophobic residues of CR1 strongly interact with the hydrophobic
pocket of PD in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. CR1 of SARS-CoV-2 also forms a salt
bridge with ACE2 that is not present in SARS-CoV. Based on our SMD simulations, we did
not observe a major difference in binding strength of the S protein to ACE2 between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is not due to tighter
binding of S to the ACE2 receptor. These results are consistent with a recent MD simulation
that applied the generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation approach (MMGBSA)22, coarse-grained simulations19, and biolayer interferometry2.

Our analysis suggests that CR1 is the main anchor site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2,
and blocking the CR1 residues F456, Y473, E484, F486, N487, and Y489 could significantly
reduce the binding affinity. Consistent with this prediction, llama based nanobodies H11-H4
and H11-D4 neutralize SARS-CoV-211 by each interacting with 50% of the critical residues we
identified in each of CR1 and CR2. Furthermore, alpaca based nanobody Ty1 was shown to
neutralize SARS-CoV-240 and among its primary interactions are E484 in CR1, and Q493 and
Y449 in CR3, which were also determined as critical residues in our study. Similarly, the human
neutralizing antibodies CV3041, B3841, CB641, and VH3-5342, 43 are interacting with 50-100%
of the critical residues identified in our study.
Experimental studies revealed that antibodies against SARS-CoV induce limited neutralizing
activity against SARS-CoV-210, 23. This may be attributed to the low sequence conservation of
the CR1 region between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the S protein of SARSCoV-2 contains critical phenylalanine (F486) and glutamate (E484) residues not present in
SARS-CoV, that form hydrophobic interactions and a salt bridge with ACE2, respectively. It
remains to be determined whether this difference plays a role in higher infectivity of SARSCoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
Our simulations show that single and double mutants of CR1 are not sufficient to disrupt the
binding of RBD to ACE2, but reduce the binding free energy of this region. Because RBD
makes multiple contacts with ACE2 through an extended surface, small molecules or peptides
that target a specific region in the RBD-ACE2 interaction surface may not be sufficient to
prevent binding of the S protein to ACE2. Instead, blocking of a larger surface of the CR1
region with a neutralizing antibody or nanobody is more likely to introduce steric constraints to
prevent the S-ACE2 interactions.
Methods
MD simulations system preparation. For cMD simulations, the crystal structure of SARSCoV-2 S protein RBD bound with ACE2 at 2.45 Å resolution (PDB ID: 6M0J)7 was used as a
template. The chloride ion, zinc ion, glycans, and water molecules in the crystal structure were
kept in their original positions. Single and double point mutants were generated using the
Mutator Plugin in VMD44. Each system was solvated in a water box (using the TIP3P water
model) having 35 Å cushion in the positive x-direction and 15 Å cushions in other directions.
This puts a 50 Å water cushion between the RBD-PD complex and its periodic image in the xdirection, creating enough space for unbinding simulations. Ions were added to neutralize the
system and salt concentration was set to 150 mM to construct a physiologically relevant

environment. The size of each solvated system was ~164,000 atoms. All system preparation
steps were performed in VMD44.
Conventional MD simulations. All MD simulations were performed in NAMD 2.1345 using
the CHARMM3646 force field with a time step of 2 fs. MD simulations were performed under
N, P, T conditions. The temperature was kept at 310 K using Langevin dynamics with a
damping coefficient of 1 ps-1. The pressure was maintained at 1 atm using the Langevin NoséHoover method with an oscillation period of 100 fs and a damping time scale of 50 fs. Periodic
boundary conditions were applied. 12 Å cutoff distance was used for van der Waals interactions.
Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald method.
For each system; first, 10,000 steps of minimization followed by 2 ns of equilibration was
performed by keeping the protein fixed. The complete system was minimized for additional
10,000 steps, followed by 4 ns of equilibration by applying constraints on C α atoms.
Subsequently, these constraints were released and the system was equilibrated for an additional
4 ns before initiating the production runs. The length of the equilibrium steps is expected to
account for the structural differences due to the radically different thermodynamic conditions
of crystallization solutions and MD simulations29. MD simulations were performed in Comet
and Stampede2 using ~8 million core-hours in total.
RMSF calculations. RMSF values were calculated as 〈∆𝑅𝑖2 〉1/2 = 〈(𝑅𝑖 − 〈𝑅𝑖 〉 )2 〉1/2, where,
〈𝑅𝑖 〉 is the mean atomic coordinate of the ith Cα atom and 𝑅𝑖 is its instantaneous coordinate.
SMD simulations. SMD47 simulations were used to explore the unbinding process of RBD
from ACE2 on time scales accessible to standard simulation lengths. SMD simulations have
been applied to explore a wide range of processes, including domain motion5, 48, molecule
unbinding49, and protein unfolding50. In SMD simulations, a dummy atom is attached to the
center of mass of ‘steered’ atoms via a virtual spring and pulled at constant velocity along the
‘pulling direction’, resulting in force F to be applied to the SMD atoms along the pulling

In SMD simulations of SARS-CoV-2, Cα atoms of ACE2 residues S19-S43, T78-P84, Q325N330, G352-I358, and P389-R393 were kept fixed, whereas Cα atoms of RBD residues K417I418, G446-F456, Y473-A475, and N487-Y505 were steered (Fig. 3a). Steered atoms were

the same ACE2 residues were kept fixed. However, two slightly different steered atoms
selections were applied: i) Using the same residue positions as for SARS-CoV-2, which are
V404-I405, T433-L443, F460-S461, and N473-Y491, and ii) selecting the region comprising
the interacting residues, which areT433-L443, F460-D463, and N473-Y491. The total number
of fixed and steered atoms were identical in all simulations. The pulling direction was selected
as the vector pointing from the center of mass of fixed atoms to the center of mass of steered
atoms. The pulling direction also serves as the reaction coordinate ξ for free energy calculations.
Each SMD simulation was performed for 15 ns using a 2 Å 𝑛𝑠 −1 pulling velocity. At a spring
constant of 100 𝑘𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑜𝑙 −1 Å −2 , the center of mass of the steered atoms followed the dummy
atom closely while the spring was still soft enough to allow small deviations. For each system,
20 conformations were sampled with a 10 ns frequency from their cMD simulations (10
conformers from each set of the cMD simulations listed in Supplementary Table 1 MD1-33 ab). These conformations served as 20 separate starting conformations, 𝐑 0 , for each set of SMD
simulations (Supplementary Table 1 MD1-33 c-d).
Potential of mean force for unbinding of RBD. Work values to unbind RBD from ACE2 at
low pulling velocities along the reaction coordinate were analyzed using Jarzynski equality,
which provides a relation between equilibrium free energy differences and the work performed
through non-equilibrium processes32, 33, 34:
𝑒 −∆𝐹/𝑘𝐵 𝑇 = 〈𝑒 −𝑊/𝑘𝐵 𝑇 〉

(3)

where ΔF is the Helmholtz free energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
Because work values sampled in our SMD simulations differ more than1 kBT (Supplementary
Figs. 3,4), the average work calculated in equation (3) will be dominated by small work values
that are only rarely sampled. For a finite (N) number of SMD simulations, the term
−𝑊𝑖 /𝑘𝐵 𝑇 ⁄
−𝑘𝐵 𝑇ln(∑𝑁
𝑁) did not converge to 〈𝑒 −𝑊/𝑘𝐵 𝑇 〉. Thus, equation (3) provides an
𝑖=1 𝑒

upper bound on ΔF, which was used as an estimate of the PMF.
