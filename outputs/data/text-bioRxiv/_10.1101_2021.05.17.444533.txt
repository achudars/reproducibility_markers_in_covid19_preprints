Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to more than 222
countries and has put global public health at high risk. The world urgently needs safe, a costeffective SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine, therapeutic and antiviral drugs to combat the
COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2
infections, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target in COVID-19 patients. In this
study, we report high level production (about ~0.75 g /kg leaf biomass) of glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of recombinant human truncated ACE2 in Nicotiana benthamiana plant. The

plant produced recombinant human truncated ACE2s successfully bind to the SARC-CoV-2
spike protein, but deglycosylated ACE2 binds more strongly than the glycosylated counterpart.
Importantly, both deglycosylated and glycosylated forms of AEC2 stable at elevated
temperatures for prolonged periods and demonstrated strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro.
The IC50 values of glycosylated and deglycosylated AEC2 were 0.4 and 24 g/ml, respectively,
for the pre-entry infection, when incubated with 100TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, plant
produced truncated ACE2s are promising cost-effective and safe candidate as a potential
therapeutic targets in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus, which has caused an outbreak in
Wuhan city, China in 2019, and then soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other countries
and the world, which resulted hundreds of thousands of deaths all over the world. Head of the
United Nations has described this humanity's worst crisis since World War II. Although several
COVID-19 vaccines are currently available and a number of candidate vaccines are under
development, only limited data are available on the effectiveness and safety of these vaccines.
The world urgently needs effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccines, antiviral and
therapeutic drugs to combat the pandemic that kills thousands of people every day. The
development of therapeutic drugs can be a useful and alternative approach to suppress the virus
entering and spread of the virus. Since angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARSCoV-2 (COVID-19) receptor, is a critical molecule in the entry process of the virus into host
tissue cells, it could be a potential therapeutic agent. ACE2 is a zinc containing metalloenzyme,
present in most organs, attached to the cell membranes of cells in the lungs, heart, kidney,
arteries and intestines1. ACE2 enzyme has multiple function and its primary function is to cleave

the angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.ACE2 is a transmembrane
protein, and serves as receptors for some coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and
HCoV-NL63 2-7. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to its functional
receptor ACE2 via receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as an initial
step for entry into the cell8,9. It has been demonstrated that the binding affinity between ACE2
and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is much stronger than that of SARS-CoV9, which can be logically
explained the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 versus SARS-CoV. It has been demonstrated
that, ACE2 serves not only the entry receptor for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 but also can
protects from lung injury4,5,10-12.Therefore, ACE2 has been proposed as potential therapeutic
target to be used for SARS-CoV-2 infection3,14. Soluble ACE2 has also been described as a
therapeutic candidate, which could neutralize the infection by acting as a decoy15.
Recombinant human ACE2 is also proposed as a novel treatment to improve pulmonary
blood flow and oxygen saturation in piglets16. Based on reported pathological findings17-19, it has
been shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with lung failure and acute respiratory distress
syndrome. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) is a devastating lung disease, which is
characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation20. From this point of view, the
introduction of soluble recombinant human ACE2 into the human body has been proposed for
the treatment of Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary arterial
hypertension21. It should be noted that the Phase I (NCT00886353) and Phase II (NCT
01597635) clinical trials for recombinant human ACE2 have been successfully completed. The
administration of soluble recombinant ECE2 has demonstrated safety and efficacy for the
treatment of ARDS and without clinically significant changes in healthy people, as well as in
patients with ARDS22-23. During the period of taking the drug, there were no serious adverse

events no antibodies to recombinant human ACE2 detected22. Recently, it was shown that
recombinant human ACE2 was significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells24
and can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in human kidney organoids25, Human Capillary and
Kidney Organoids24. It was previously proposed that SARS-CoV may deregulate a lung
protective pathway4,10. Thus, recombinant AEC2 might not only reduce lung injury, but also
could block early the entry of SARS-CoV-2 infections in target cells. Therefore, the
development of a cost-effective, safe, and functionally active recombinant ACE2 could be very
important in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Recent studies have shown plant
expression systems as promising expression platforms for the rapid, safe and cost-effective
production of various recombinant proteins. Plant expression systems have a number of
advantages compared to other expression systems currently used, and have the ability to
accumulate hundreds of milligrams of target protein per kilogram of biomass in less than a week.
This system has been successfully used for rapid and cost-effective production of a variety of
recombinant proteins such as vaccine candidates26-30 and complex mammalian proteins, enzymes
such as furin and Factor IX30. Notable, using transplastomic technology human ACE2 was
produced in plant chloroplasts31. It was demonstrated that the delivery of human ACE2 (fused
with CTB) by oral gavage in mice resulted in increased circulating and retinal levels of ACE2
and reduced eye inflammation 31. Expression of ACE2 fused with the Fc region of human IgG1
in Nicotiana benthamiana plant using transient expression platform has been recently reported32.
The expression level of ACE2 fusion protein was 100 mg/kg plant leaf. It was reported that this
plant-produced fusion protein exhibited potent anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro.
ACE2 enzyme were also produced in various mammalian cells such as HEK293, CHO,
insect cells etc. (https://www.mybiosource.com/search/Angiotensin‑converting+enzyme+2).

However, mammalian expression systems are extremely expensive and difficult to scale up. In
addition, there is a risk of contamination of mammalian pathogens in recombinant proteins
produced using the mammalian expression systems. Here we describe the engineering,
expression and production at high level of truncated form of ACE2 in N. benthamiana plant
using transient expression system, for the first time. The expression levels of both glycosylated
and in vivo Endo H deglycosylated forms are ~0.75 g/ kg leaf biomass. The purification yields of
recombinant plant produced ACE2 protein glycosylated and deglycosylated forms calculated
as~0.4 or 0.5 g/kg leaf biomass, respectively. Expression of ACE2 proteins and purification
procedures can be optimized to increase their purification yield. Our results demonstrated that
the plant-produced truncated ACE2 proteins bind successfully to RBD of the SARC-CoV-2
spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In addition, our results demonstrate that
both glycosylated and deglycosylated AEC2 proteins are stable at an elevated temperature for
prolonged periods.

Results
Engineering and production, purification of recombinant ACE2s in N. benthamiana plants
We engineered and produced a truncated version of human ACE2 in N. benthamiana plant as
described in Materials and Methods. To understand the role of glycosylation, we produced both
glycosylated and non-glycosylated variants of ACE2 protein in N. benthamiana plant. Figure 1
demonstrates the confirmation of the production of glycosylated and non-glycosylated variants
of ACE2 in N. benthamiana by western blot analysis. N. benthamiana leaf samples were
harvested at different post infiltration days (dpi) and expression levels of glycosylated and nonglycosylated variants of ACE2 reached the maximum level at 6 dpi. For purification, a vacuum
infiltration was used for large-scale production of glycosylated and non-glycosylated variants of

ACE2. Glycosylated and deglycosylated variants of ACE2 were purified using HisPur™ NiNTA resin. The purification yields of recombinant plant produced glycosylated or
deglycosylated forms were ~0.4 or 0.5 g/kg leaf, respectively. The purity of glycosylated and
deglycosylated variants of ACE2 enzyme was higher than 90% or 95%, for glycosylated or
deglycosylated, respectively, as estimated based on SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis
(Figure 2). Molecular masses were 80 or 90 kDa for deglycosylated or glycosylated AEC2,
respectively (Figure 2).
Binding affinity of plant produced recombinant ACE2 protein with spike protein
The binding activity of plant produced recombinant ACE2 protein was confirmed by measuring
the binding activity of ACE2 with spike protein of SARC-CoV-2 as described in Materials and
Methods. The results presented at Figure3 demonstrate that plant produced, glycosylated and
non-glycosylated ACE2s successfully bind to commercial or plant produced spike proteins of
SARC-CoV-2. Deglycosylated ACE2 variant binds to the deglycosylated plant-produced Sprotein more strongly than the glycosylated counterparts.
Stability assessment of plant produced ACEs
The stability of plant produced glycosylated and in vivo deglycosylated forms of AEC2 were
examined after incubation at 37°C for a prolonged time period: 24, 48, 96 and 144 hours (Figure
4). Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that plant produced glycosylated ACE2 had almost no
degradation at 37oC for 144 h and degradation of in vivo Endo H glycosylated ACE2 at the same
condition was less than 5 %. These results demonstrate that plant produced, both glycosylated
and deglycosylated AEC2s are stable at an elevated temperature for prolonged periods.

Anti -SARS-CoV2 activity of plant produced ACE2s
Anti -SARS-CoV2 activity of plant produced glycosylated and deglycosylated forms were
evaluated as described in Materials and Methods. Figure 5 demonstrate apparent activities of
plant produced recombinant truncated glycosylated and deglycosylated ACE2 variants to RBDs
plotted against IC50 of authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralizationat the pre-infection phase. The half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for glycosylated and deglycosylated AEC2 were
0.4 and 24 g/ml, respectively, when they mixed with 100TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5).
Discussion
The new coronavirus COVID-19 disease is currently responsible for the pandemic, created huge
global human health crisis with significant negative impacts on health and economy worldwide.
Given the high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, there is an urgent
demand for the development of effective, safe and affordable therapeutics, vaccines and
inhibitors to control the epidemic. A number of studies performed with SARS-CoV and SARCCoV-2 have been demonstrated the ACE2 enzyme as a potential therapeutic target and
alternative treatment option in COVID-19 patients. Recombinant human ACE2, developed by
APEIRON Biologics (https://www.apeiron-biologics.com/tag/ace2/), is currently in pilot clinical
trials in China. Thus, the high-level production of safe and affordable recombinant human ACE2
with high anti SARS-CoV-2 activity would be a challenge task. Therefore, the aim of this study
is to produce an affordable, safe and functional active recombinant human ACE2 using the plant
transient expression system for use in the treatment of COVID-19. Plant expression systems is
promising expression platform for cost-effective, fast and safe production of a variety of
recombinant proteins, vaccines, antibodies, therapeutic proteins and enzymes. Plant expression

systems have several advantages over other expression systems currently in use, including rapid
and high production with the ability to accumulate grams of target protein per kilogram of
biomass in less than a week. This system have been successfully used for production functional
active complex proteins such as full length Pfs48/45 of Plasmodium falciparum30, human Furin,
Factor IX30, glycohormone erythropoietin33, latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)34, and also PA83 of Bacillus anthracis27, 28, HIV gp140 and other viral glycoproteins35,36.
The goal this study is to develop safe, cost effective plant produced ACE2 enzyme with antiSARS-CoV-2 activities for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
ACE2 is zinc-metalloproteinase type 1 transmembrane protein with molecular mass of
120 kDa and composed of 805 amino acids. 3D structure analysis of ACE2 protein was revealed
that enzyme molecule contains a signal peptide sequence (1-17 aa) and extracellular sequence
(18-740) which contains the active carboxy peptidase domain, a transmembrane domain (aa 741–
761) and a cytoplasmic domain (aa 762–805). The ACE2 enzyme has been intensively studied
since 2002 as it was identified as a cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and
SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses.
In this study, we engineered and expressed a truncated form of human ACE2 gene in N.
benthamiana plant, for the first time. Spike-glycoprotein of SARC-CoV-2 has 22 potential Nglycosylation sites. Human ACE2 is glycoprotein, which has 7 potential N-glycosylated sites.
The virus (SARS-Cov-2) and receptor (ACE2) binding affinity on the surface of human cells
could be critical step in viral entry into the susceptible cells. To understand the role of Nglycosylation, we produced both glycosylated and non-glycosylated variants of ACE2 protein in
N. benthamiana plant. Deglycosylated ACE2variant was produced using the in vivo
deglycosylation strategy, by co-expression of human ACE2 with bacterial Endo H, which we

recently developed28. The expression level of glycosylated and deglycosylated variants was
about ~0.75g/kg plant biomass. Notable, the production of soluble human ACE2 as a fusion
protein with immunoglobulin Fc domain has been recently reported 32.The expression level of
ACE2-Fc fusion reported was 100 mg/kg plant leaf. The expression levels of the truncated ACEs
developed in this study are 7.5 times higher than the ACE2-Fc fusion. Both glycosylated and
deglycosylated truncated ACE2 variants were purified using Ni-column affinity chromatography.
The purification yield of glycosylated and deglycosylated ACE2 variants were ~0.4 and ~0.5
g/kg plant leaf. The purities of glycosylated or deglycosylated AEC2s were 90% or 95 %,
respectively.
Our results showed that plant produced glycosylated and non-glycosylated ACE2 variants
successfully bind to RBD of SARC-CoV-2 spike protein. However, the deglycosylated ACE2
variant binds to the deglycosylated plant-produced S-protein more strongly than the glycosylated
counterparts. Moreover, the plant produced glycosylated and non-glycosylated ACE2 variants
exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. However, the IC50 values of glycosylated
ACE2 (0.4 g/ml) was 60 -fold lower compared to deglycosylated form of ACE2 (24 g/ml), for
the pre-entry infection, when culture medium was mixed 100TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2. Notable,
IC50 values of ACE2-Fc fusion protein at the pre-entry stage was reported as 94.66 g/ml at
25TCID5032.Thus, the inhibition efficacy of plant produced glycosylated, truncated form ~947
fold higher than ACE2-Fc.
Generally, it has been supposed that soluble form of ACE2 in excessive forms, may
negatively affect the virus entering and spreading37. Based on above descriptions plant produced
recombinant ACE2 could be as a potential therapeutic target in COVID-19 patients to slow down
the virus entering, spread of the virus and protect the lung from injury. Like other respiratory

diseases, COVID-19 can cause permanent damage the lungs, heart, and other organs. A possible
explanation is the blocking of the binding domain of the ACE2 receptor (RBD) by SARC-CoV2. Therefore, recombinant ACE2 could be a promising bio-mimicking molecule facilitating to
attenuate and/or prevent COVİD-19 related cellular injury. Thus, development of safe, functional
active and a cost-effective production of recombinant ACE2 could be very useful for the
treatment of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, all above findings demonstrate that plant
produced glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of truncated ACE2 could be a potential
therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 to slow down the virus entering, spread of the virus and
protect the lung from injury.
Conclusion
A number of studies have been shown recombinantACE2 as a potential therapeutic target in
COVID-19 patients. At this point, the development and production of recombinant ACE2 protein
at high levels with high anti SARS-CoV-2 activity could be a challenging task. In this study, we
show that recombinant ACE2 that exhibit a potent anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity with the IC50
values of 0.4 g/ml, can be produced rapidly, at high level (~ 0.75 g/kg plant leaf) in N.
benthamiana plant using plant transient expression system. These findings demonstrate plant
produced ACEs as a cost effective, safe and promising therapeutic target for the treatment of
COVID-19 patients.
Materials and Methods
Cloning, expression, and screening of recombinant ACE2 in N. benthamiana plants
The sequences of ACE2 was optimized for expression in N. benthamiana plants and synthesized
de-novo. The constructed ACE2 gene was inserted into the pEAQ binary expression vector 38 to

strain AGL1. AGL1 carrying the pEAQ-ACE2 plasmid was then infiltrated into 6-7-week old N.
benthamiana plants. To produce deglycosylated ACE2, ACE2 gene was in vivo co-expressed
with Endo H28. To confirm the expression of His6 tagged ACE2 protein variants, a leaf tissue
was harvested at 6 dpi (day post infiltration) and homogenized in three volumes of extraction
buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) as described previously29.

Purification of recombinant ACE2 from N. benthamiana plants

To produce the AEC-2 protein (both glycosylated and deglycosylated variants) in N.
benthamiana, plants were infiltrated with ACE2 (glycosylated) or ACE2 + Endo H
(deglycosylated) genes and harvested at 6 dpi. For purification, twenty grams of frozen plant
leaves from each variant infiltrated with AEC-2 gene were ground in extraction buffer with 3
times volume of plant weight and the extract was centrifugated for 20 minutes at 4°C at 13,000
g. The supernatant was loaded onto a disposable polypropylene column (Pierce) with 1 ml
HisPur™ Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with 10 column volume binding buffer, by gravity-flow
chromatography. The column was washed with 10-15 column volumes (CV) of wash buffer until
reaching to the baseline. Proteins were eluted with 10 CV of elution buffer. Elution fractions
were collected as 0.5 ml/eppendorf and protein concentrations in the eluted fractions were
measured by BioDrop. According to the concentration, the combined fractions were
concentrated, and buffer exchanged against PBS with a 10K MWCO Millipore concentrator (Cat
No: UFC801096, Merck) to a final volume of 1.2 ml. The concentrated protein was stored at –
80°C until use.

Study of binding activity of plant produced recombinant ACE2 protein with commercial
or plant produced spike protein
Binding activity of plant produced recombinant ACE2 protein with commercial or plant
produced spike proteins was performed by ELISA. Briefly a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One
GmbH, Germany) was coated with 100 ng of plant produced39 or commercial available Spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 (RBD, His Tag, Arg319-Phe541, MM~ 25 kDa,
MBS2563882,MyBioSource, USA) in 100 mM carbonate buffer for overnight. Next day wells
were blocked with blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking various
concentrations of plant produced glycosylated and deglycosylated ACE2 proteins (100 -2000 ng)
were added into wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After 2 h, anti-His tag mouse mAb was
added into each wells. The plate was washed three times with blocking solution (200 μl/well).
After washing, wells were incubated with anti-mouse HRP -IgG antibody (BioLegend). The
plate was washed three times with washing solution (200 μl/well for 5 minute). 200 μl of
substrate solution (Sigma) was added to each well. Afterwards plate was incubated in the dark,
for 30 minutes at RT. After the incubation period, the plate was read at 450 nm on a multi well
plate reader.
Stability assessments of different variants of ACE2

Stability assessments of different variants of ACE2 were performed using similar procedure as
described previously28,30. Plant produced glycosylated and deglycosylated variants of ACE2
were diluted to 1,0 mg/mL with PBS, and were aliquoted into low-binding tubes. Proteins were
then incubated at 37 °C for 48, and 96 hours. After incubation, samples were analyzed by SDSPAGE. For SDS-PAGE analysis, the samples were mixed with SDS loading dye (5X) and stored

at −20 °C until use. All samples were then run on SDS-PAGE. The degradation of ACE2
variants were quantified using highly sensitive Gene Tools software (Syngene Bioimaging, UK)
and ImageJsoftware (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij).
SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis
SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis of plant produced glycosylated and non-glycosylated
variants of ACE2 were performed as described previously30. The His tagged ACE2 variants
were detected using anti-His mAb (Cat. No. 652505, BioLegend).
Anti -SARS-CoV2 activity of plant produced ACE2s
Anti SARS-CoV2 activity of plant produced ACE2s was monitored in vitro. The neutralizing
ability of glycosylated and deglycosylated ACE2 variants was analyzed at different incubation
periods. dACE2 and gACE2 (3.055 and 2.542 mg/mL, respectively) was 5-fold diluted in high
glucose DMEM in a U-bottomed plate. After combining with equal volume (100 µL)
100TCID50 of SARC-CoV-2 (104,25/0.1 mL), the mixtures were incubated at room temperature
for 30 minutes. A total of 150 µL incubated mixture was then inoculated on Vero E6 Cells
grown in a 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plate (Greiner, Germany). The highest
concentrations of deglycosylated ACE 2 and glycosylated ACE2 without the virus was involved
as a toxicity control, and serum-free High Glucose DMEM was added to each plate as a cell
control. A total of 75 µL of 100TCID50 SARS-CoV2 Ank1 virus was also used as virus control.
All tests were performed in a quadruplicate. The plates were incubated at 37°C in a humidified
incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere until virus control wells had adequate cytopathic effect
(CPE) readings. The test was evaluated when the virus control wells showed 100%
cytopathogenic effect (CPE) at daily microscopy. To do precise calculations based on OD

crystal violet (CV - 0.075% in ethanol) for 20 minutes. The dye washed away by repeated
washing and retained CV was released by adding 100 µL ethanol (70%). Ten minutes after, the
plate was read on ELISA reader using 295 nm filter (Multiskan Plus, MKII, Finland). The 50%
effective dose (EC50) was calculated as described elsewhere40.
