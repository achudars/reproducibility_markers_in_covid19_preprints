Abstract

We here describe the development and validation of IMMUNO-COVTM, a high-throughput
clinical test to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, the specific subset
of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that block viral infection. The test measures the capacity of
serum or purified antibodies to neutralize a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)
encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. This recombinant virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S19CT) induces fusion in Vero cell monolayers, which is detected as luciferase signal using a
dual split protein (DSP) reporter system. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT infection was blocked by
monoclonal α-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibodies and by plasma or serum from SARS-CoV-2
convalescing individuals. The assay exhibited 100% specificity in validation tests, and across all
tests zero false positives were detected. In blinded analyses of 230 serum samples, only two
unexpected results were observed based on available clinical data. We observed a perfect
correlation between results from our assay and 80 samples that were also assayed using a
commercially available ELISA. To quantify the magnitude of the anti-viral response, we
generated a calibration curve by adding stepped concentrations of α-SARS-CoV-2-spike
monoclonal antibody to pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum. Using the calibration curve
and a single optimal 1:100 serum test dilution, we reliably measured neutralizing antibody levels
in each test sample. Virus neutralization units (VNUs) calculated from the assay correlated
closely (p < 0.0001) with PRNTEC50 values determined by plaque reduction neutralization test
against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
the IMMUNO-COVTM assay accurately quantitates SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in
human sera and therefore is a potentially valuable addition to the currently available serological
tests. The assay can provide vital information for comparing immune responses to the various
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in development, or for evaluating donor eligibility in
convalescent plasma therapy studies.

Introduction
At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from Wuhan, China. The virus causes a variety of signs
and symptoms, including most commonly cough, fever, and shortness of breath. While some
individuals are asymptomatic or experience only mild illness, many experience severe
symptoms and require hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly around the globe and was
declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization. As of May
26, 2020, the virus has infected over 5.5 million people worldwide causing more than 346,000
deaths. PCR assays that detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection are playing an important role in
tracking disease spread, while serological tests that detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are
being used to measure past rates of infection and identify individuals who may be immune to
SARS-CoV-2. However, the availability of serological tests that can specifically measure SARSCoV-2-neutralizing antibodies is severely limited.
Generation of virus-neutralizing antibodies is essential for blocking subsequent viral
infections, and the presence of neutralizing antibodies correlates with protective immunity
following vaccination (1). Yet, only a subset of virus-specific antibodies are neutralizing (2). It is
not currently understood how total antibody levels to the virus or even to the Spike protein relate
to neutralizing activity for SARS-CoV-2, and improved testing of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibody responses is urgently needed. Early convalescent plasma therapy trials have shown
promising results (3–5), but screening of plasma donors is inadequate if acceptance criteria are
based on total anti-SARS2-CoV-2 antibody levels and not specifically on neutralizing antibody
levels. Likewise, efficacy studies of new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines must consider not only total
antibody responses, but neutralizing antibody responses.
Laboratory assays to detect SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies have been developed
using clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (6–8), pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (9,10), pseudotyped

Vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) (11), and, most recently, recombinant VSVs (12,13). We
describe here IMMUNO-COVTM, a high-throughput, scalable clinical assay for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies using a recombinant VSV engineered to express the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in place of the VSV-G glycoprotein. Several groups have generated
VSVs encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, which are being explored as potential
vaccine candidates (World Health Organization website) or used in laboratory assays and
research (12,13). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-2
(Ace-2) on the cell surface to initiate virus entry (14–16). As the primary surface-exposed viral
protein, the coronavirus spike is a major target of the host immune system (11,17–19). Blocking
the interaction of spike with Ace-2 prevents virus entry, making spike the primary target of
neutralizing antibodies (9,13,15). Therefore, detection of antibodies capable of neutralizing VSV
expressing spike glycoprotein is expected to directly reflect the level of SARS-CoV-2neutralizing antibodies present. Importantly, using spike-expressing VSV in place of SARS-CoV2 significantly increases assay safety and scalability.
Our assay exploits the fusion phenotype of spike-expressing VSV by using a dual split
protein (DSP) luciferase reporter system to quantitate virus-induced cell fusion and thereby the
level of virus neutralization (Figure 1). The DSP system uses a chimeric split green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and split Renilla luciferase (EF446136.1) (20,21). Fusion between two cell lines
expressing complementary pieces of the split reporter facilitates reassociation of fully functional
GFP and Renilla luciferase. Thus, luciferase activity can be used to measure virus-induced cell
fusion in a high-throughput 96-well plate format. Here, we describe the development of
IMMUNO-COVTM, including optimization of assay conditions and validation of the final clinical
assay. An excellent correlation was observed between our assay results, clinical symptoms, and
results from other serological tests. In particular, quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibody levels correlated closely with plaque reduction neutralization EC50% reduction values

from an assay using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (22). Thus, IMMUNO-COVTM accurately
quantitates SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, making it a valuable tool for assessing plasma
therapies and immune responses to new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Figure 1: Overview of the IMMUNO-COVTM assay. A VSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (VSV-SARSCoV-2-S-19CT) is incubated with test sera samples. In the absence of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing
antibodies (top) the virus retains infectivity and infects Vero-DSP1/DSP2 monolayers. If the test sample
contains SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (bottom), the antibodies bind to the spike protein causing
virus neutralization by blocking cell entry. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT induces syncytia formation in VeroDSP1/DSP2 monolayers, which reconstitutes a fully functional luciferase reporter that is used to quantitate
virus-induced syncytia formation. High luciferase signal means the test sample did not neutralize the virus,
while decreased luciferase indicates the presence of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in the test
sample.

Results
Measurement of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT fusion through luciferase assay: Biosafety
level 3 contaminant and practices are required to safely perform neutralization assays utilizing
SARS-CoV-2, making widespread testing of patient samples using these assays impractical.

We therefore sought to develop a safer, scalable assay that could be used to detect SARSCoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in blood samples. To this end, we designed an assay in which
syncytia formation in Vero cells, induced by infection with spike-expressing VSV, is detected
using a dual split protein (DSP) luciferase reporter (Figure 1). Using reverse genetics, we
generated a recombinant Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in which the VSV glycoprotein (G)
was replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (Figure 2A). Deletion of the last 19 amino
acids in the C-terminal (cytoplasmic) domain of spike was required for efficient virus rescue and
amplification. The resulting virus (VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT), induced syncytia formation in
Vero cell monolayers (Figure 2B). Virion incorporation of spike was confirmed in viral
supernatants by immunoblot analysis (Figure 2C). Spike protein, but not VSV-G, was detected,
confirming efficient replacement of VSV-G with SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT in the recombinant virus.
Since Vero cells were infected by VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT and expressed both Ace-2
and TMPRSS2 (Figure 2D&E), they were chosen as the reporter cell line for our assay. Parental
Vero cells were transduced with self-inactivating lentiviral vectors encoding DSP1 (DSP1-7) or
DSP2 (DSP8-11) and a puromycin resistance gene, and reporter-expressing cells were selected
using puromycin. When mixed monolayers of Vero-DSP1 and Vero-DSP2 cells seeded at a 1:1
ratio were infected with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT, we observed syncytia formation and
readily detected luciferase activity at 24 h post infection (Figure 2F). In contrast, luciferase
activity was not detected in infected monolayers of Vero-DSP1 alone or Vero-DSP2 alone, or in
mock-infected Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers. Thus, luciferase activity was specific to
virus-induced cell fusion of mixed Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers.

infection at 100X magnification. C) Immunoblot analysis. Viral supernatants from mock-infected Vero cells
or cells infected with VSV-GFP (encodes VSV-G) or VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT were subjected to
immunoblot analysis using α-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (left) and rabbit α-VSV antiserum (right). Arrows

proteins. D and E) Flow cytometry. Monolayers of Vero-DSP1 cells were dislodged with versene,
permeabilized (TMPRSS2 staining only), stained with isotype control (grey), α-Ace-2 (D, black) or αTMPRSS2 (E, black) antibody, fixed, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. F) VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S19CT induced luciferase activity. Monolayers of Vero-DSP1, Vero-DSP2, or mixed Vero-DSP/Vero-DSP2
cells were mock-infected or infected (10,000 TCID50 units/well) with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT.
Luciferase activity was measured as a marker of cell fusion at 24 h after infection. Values represent the
average (mean) RLU ± standard deviation from duplicate wells.

Optimization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT fusion: Syncytia formation is required to
produce functional luciferase in our assay. However, complete destruction of the cell monolayer
following syncytia formation reduces luciferase activity due to loss of cell viability. We therefore
determined the optimal time after VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT infection to measure luciferase.
EnduRenTM Live Cell Substrate (EnduRenTM) is an engineered “pro-substrate”, which must be
cleaved by cellular esterases to produce the Renilla luciferase substrate coelenterazine.
Because the pro-substrate is highly stable, luciferase activity can be measured repeatedly at
any time between 2 and 24 hours after EnduRenTM addition. By 15 h after infection, luciferase
activity in infected Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers was readily distinguished from
background signal in mock-infected cells (Figure 3A). Luciferase activity continued to rise,
reaching peak levels around 26 hours after infection. Thus, optimal luciferase readout in the
assay was between 24 and 30 hours after infection.

Figure 3: Optimization of luciferase signal. A) Kinetics of virus-induced luciferase activity. VSV-SARS-CoV2-S-19CT (2360 TCID50 units/well) or OptiMEM alone (mock) was overlaid onto monolayers of VeroDSP1/Vero-DSP2 cells. Luciferase substrate EnduRenTM was added to wells and luciferase activity was
measured at the indicated times (h) thereafter. Values represent the average (mean) RLU ± standard
deviation from duplicate wells. B) Optimization of cell density. The indicated numbers of Vero-DSP1/VeroDSP2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. The following day, VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT was diluted in
OptiMEM to the indicated dilutions and overlaid onto the cell monolayers. EnduRen TM was added to wells
and luciferase activity was measured 28 h after infection. Values represent the average (mean) RLU ±
standard deviation from two experiments run in duplicate.

To enhance cell fusion and luciferase activity, and thereby increase assay sensitivity, we
also determined the optimal cell density and virus concentration to use for assay. To this end,
we seeded Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 cells at increasing cell densities and after 24 hours infected
the monolayers with increasing concentrations of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT. At all virus
dilutions, increasing cell density improved luciferase signal (Figure 3B). We concluded that
4x104 cells/well should be used for the assay. As expected, syncytia formation and luciferase
activity also increased when more virus was used to inoculate the monolayers. To ensure lot-tolot consistency between different virus preparations, an appropriate concentration of virus to use
for assay was determined for each lot of virus based on performance against a set of contrived
controls (see below).
Detection of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT neutralization: To demonstrate that virus
neutralization could be detected using our assay, we first tested the capacity of several purified
proteins to inhibit virus-induced fusion. Affinity-purified polyclonal α-SARS-CoV-spike antibody
and soluble recombinant Ace-2 protein bind spike on the virus surface and block entry into cells.
Similarly, monoclonal α-Ace-2 antibody blocks the cellular receptors and limits virus entry. All
three inhibitors successfully blocked VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT-induced fusion in a dosedependent manner (Figure 4A), demonstrating that our assay could detect inhibition of VSVSARS-CoV-2-S-19CT infection. Importantly, we also detected VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT
neutralization by plasma acquired from a SARS-CoV-2 convalescing individual known to have
contracted and exhibited COVID-19 disease (referred to as NL1). Compared to pooled plasma
from three presumed SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals, heat-inactivated NL1 plasma
neutralized VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B), providing
proof-of-concept for our assay.

Figure 4: Neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT-induced luciferase activity. A) Inhibition by purified
molecules. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT was incubated with media alone or the indicated concentrations of
α-SARS-CoV-2-spike antibody, α-Ace-2 antibody, or recombinant Ace-2. After 1 h at 37oC, the virus mixes
were overlaid on Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers. Control wells received media alone (no virus).
Luciferase substrate EnduRenTM was added to wells and luciferase activity was measured 24 h after
infection. Values represent the average (mean) RLU ± standard deviation from duplicate wells. B) Inhibition
by COVID-19 convalescing plasma. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT was incubated with the indicated dilutions
of plasma from a COVID-19 convalescing individual (NL1) or pooled plasma from three presumptive SARSCoV-2 seronegative individuals. Plasma dilutions represent final dilutions after addition of virus. After 1 h
at 37oC, the virus mixes were overlaid on Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers. EnduRenTM was added to
wells and luciferase activity was measured 28 h after infection. Values represent the average (mean) RLU
± standard deviation from duplicate wells.

Optimization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT neutralization time: In an early experiment we
observed that even in the absence of any neutralizing serum or inhibitors, incubation of VSVSARS-CoV-2-S-19CT at 37oC for 1 hour resulted in loss of luciferase activity (Figure 5A). This
loss was partially abrogated at higher concentrations of virus. Nevertheless, we explored
whether a shorter incubation time at room temperature was sufficient for virus neutralization.
Two-fold serial dilutions of neutralizing NL1 plasma were prepared and incubated with VSVSARS-CoV-2-S-19CT for 60 minutes at 37oC or for 15, 30, or 60 minutes at room temperature.
Relative to the other conditions, luciferase activity was slightly higher at the 1:160 dilution in the

sample that had been incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature (Figure 5B), suggesting
that this condition may not be sufficient for complete neutralization. However, NL1 neutralized
VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT as well, if not more efficiently, when incubated at room
temperature for 30 or 60 minutes relative to incubation at 37oC for 1 hour. We concluded that a
30-minute incubation at room temperature is sufficient for virus neutralization.
Heat inactivation is not necessary for assay compatibility: To further streamline our assay
workflow and reduce the burden of pre-analytical sample processing, we determined whether
heat inactivation of samples is necessary to achieve reliable results. Serum samples were used
for testing due to their greater availability compared to plasma samples. We initially tested three
presumptive SARS-CoV-2 seronegative samples and a commercially available sera pool
(generated before fall of 2019) at a 1:100 dilution. In the sera pool, and two of the three negative
sera, heat-inactivation led to a modest decrease in luciferase activity (Figure 5C), possibly due
to low-levels of virus inactivation by complement. Yet overall, heat-inactivation had little effect
on VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT-induced cell fusion. When three additional presumptive
seronegative sera were tested at multiple dilutions, we again saw little difference in luciferase
activity between heat-inactivated and non-heat-inactivated samples (Figure 5D). In contrast, we
noted that in one sample heat inactivation reduced the capacity of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescing
serum to neutralize VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT (Figure 5E). We therefore concluded that using
non-heat inactivated samples is preferred, as it streamlines assay workflow and increases
assay sensitivity.
Determination of the minimum recommended dilution: Sample interference is common in
serological assays at high sample concentrations. Therefore, we sought to define the minimum
recommended dilution for assay samples, in which false positives due to sample interference
are nearly eliminated. To this end, we assayed thirty-nine presumptive SARS-CoV-2
seronegative samples at 2-fold serial dilutions ranging from 1:10 through 1:320. As expected,

Figure 5: Optimization of neutralization conditions. A) Incubation of
virus decreases fusion. VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT was thawed and
diluted to the indicated TCID50 units/100 µL in OptiMEM. Duplicate
samples were prepared; one set was immediately overlaid onto VeroDSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers, while the other was incubated at 37oC
for 1 h before being overlaid onto Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers.
Luciferase substrate EnduRenTM was added to wells and luciferase
activity was measured 27 h after infection. Values represent the

convalescing plasma were prepared convalescing
and incubated with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT for the times and at
the temperatures indicated before being overlaid onto Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers. Dilutions
represent NL1 dilutions in the final virus/plasma mixes. EnduRenTM was added to wells and luciferase
activity was measured 25 h after infection. Values represent the average (mean) RLU ± standard deviation
from duplicate wells. C&D) Effect of heat inactivation on negative sera. Presumptive negative serum
samples A, B, C, D, E, F, and a commercial SARS-CoV-2 seronegative pooled sera (Pool) were prepared
as duplicate aliquots. One aliquot was stored on ice while the other was incubated for 30 min at 56oC. Each
aliquot was then diluted in OptiMEM and mixed with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT to a final dilution of 1:100
(C) or the dilutions indicated (D). Following a 30 min incubation at room temperature, the virus/sera mixes
were overlaid onto Vero-DSP1/Vero-DSP2 monolayers. EnduRenTM was added to wells and luciferase
activity was measured 23 h after infection. Values represent the average (mean) RLU ± standard deviation
from duplicate wells. E) Effect of heat inactivation on COIVD-19 convalescing serum. A presumptive SARSCoV-2 seropositive sample was thawed and assayed as described in Panel D at a 1:40 final dilution.

interference with virus fusion and luciferase activity was observed at higher serum
concentrations (Figure 6A), but disappeared as the samples were further diluted. Statistical
analyses indicated that the minimum recommended dilution was approximately 1:100. At this
dilution there is greater than 95% confidence that the luciferase signal from a negative serum
sample will be ≥ 50% relative to a pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative sera control. In all future
studies, therefore, we used 1:100 as the dilution for both test serum samples as well as pooled
SARS-CoV-2 seronegative controls.
Development of a contrived positive control: Due to the limited availability of large quantities
of qualified SARS-CoV-2 seropositive sera, we developed a contrived positive control for the
assay. To this end, we spiked various concentrations of mAb10914, a monoclonal antibody that
binds to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, into pooled SARS-CoV2 seronegative serum or media alone. As a control, isotype antibody was also used. As
expected, mAb10914 caused dose-dependent neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT in
both media and pooled negative sera (Figure 6B&C). In contrast, the isotype control antibody
did not significantly alter virus-induced luciferase activity, indicating that neutralization by
mAb10914 was specific to spike binding. To establish appropriate concentrations to use for
contrived controls in validation studies, we tested a total of nine 3-fold serial dilutions of
mAb10914 (from 10 µg/mL through ~0.0015 µg/mL) in duplicate on three separate runs
performed by three separate analysts. Because of plate-to-plate variability in raw RLU (relative
light unit) values, we normalized results as percent luciferase signal relative to the luciferase
signal in control wells containing pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative sera. The average (mean)
percent luciferase signal at each concentration was plotted, and a non-linear regression curve
was generated (Figure 6D). The linear range of the assay was between approximately 10% to
80% luciferase signal or 0.01 to 0.6 µg/mL mAb10914. We selected 2 µg/mL mAb10914 as a
contrived positive control high (CPC High), which consistently reduces signal to < 20%. Based

signal below 50% was calculated as 0.18 µg/mL, which thus represents an approximate limit of
detection of the assay.

Examination of assay specificity and sensitivity: Having established a CPC High value, we
used it to define assay specificity and sensitivity. To measure specificity, we tested thirty
presumptive SARS-CoV-2 seronegative samples alone (matrix) or spiked with 2 µg/mL (CPC
High) of mAb10914. This evaluation was conducted to verify that at the optimized 1:100 serum
dilution no false positives were obtained and that all contrived positive controls showed virus
neutralization. In two separate analytical runs performed by different analysts, no false positives
or negatives were observed (Table 1). One negative sample was resulted as indeterminant in
the first assay due to one replicate having signal < 50%. However, in the second assay the
sample was correctly identified as negative. Thus, in this validation assay specificity was 100%.

To evaluate assay sensitivity, we performed a similar but single-blinded analysis using the
same 30 presumptive SARS-CoV-2 seronegative samples. Duplicate samples were assayed,
where one replicate sample was spiked with mAb10914 at 2 µg/mL (CPC High) or 0.35 µg/mL
(borderline inhibition), before being assigned blinded IDs. Of the 30 un-spiked samples, 26 were
identified as negative and 4 as indeterminant (Table 2). We detected 10 of the 11 CPC High
samples as positive, and sample preparation error was suspected in the single positive not
identified. From the 19 borderline samples, 13 were identified as positive, 4 as negative, and 2

Demonstration of Clinical Agreement: Given that our assay performed well with the contrived
controls, we proceeded with blinded studies to determine whether results correlated well with
clinical symptoms. To this end, we acquired serum samples from negative donors
(symptomless, negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, or SARS-CoV-2 seronegative by ELISA),
positive donors (positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or SARS-CoV-2 seropositive by ELISA), and
contact positive donors (not tested, but in direct contact with someone positive for SARS-CoV-2
by PCR). A total of 230 samples were received and blinded to the assay analysts until after
testing was complete. Of the 125 negative samples received, all 125 tested negative in the
assay (Table 3), providing further evidence of our assay’s excellent specificity. All 38 of the
known SARS-CoV-2 seropositive samples also tested positive in our assay. Of the 34 samples
obtained from donors that had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, neutralizing
antibodies were identified in 31 samples. Upon closer examination, one sample was collected
only 8 days after positive PCR test and was expected to be negative in our assay due to

insufficient time for a strong antibody response to develop. From donors who had contact with
someone positive for SARS-CoV-2, we identified 13 of 33 samples (39.4%) as positive for
neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, our data indicated that our assay has excellent clinical
agreement.

Correlation between VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization: The
strong clinical agreement observed for our assay supported our premise that neutralization of
VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT accurately reflects neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. In order to
directly demonstrate this correlation, twenty of the serum samples from above were also tested
against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (22) in a BSL-3 plaque reduction neutralization test
(PRNT). Each of the 5 samples that tested negative in our assay, including the sample acquired
eight days after a SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test, were also below the limit of detection in the
PRNT assay (Table 4). Likewise, the 15 samples that tested positive in our assay were also
positive in the PRNT assay. Moreover, quantitative virus neutralizing units (VNUs) determined in
our assay correlated closely with PRNTEC50 values (Table 4 and Figure 7A). To

our assay. The percent luciferase signal for each dilution was plotted and the resulting curves
were used to determine the VNTEC50 values. Statistical comparison of the VNU and VNTEC50
indicated excellent correlation (Spearman RS = 0.8327, p < 0.0001) between the two values
(Figure 7B), providing additional demonstration of the accuracy of the VNU values. We
concluded that neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT closely replicates neutralization of
SARS-CoV-2 and that VNUs provide an accurate method to quantitate the strength of the antiSARS-CoV-2 antibody response.

mixes for the calibration curve were 3, 1, 0.33, 0.11, and 0.037 µg/mL. The percent signal for each test
sample and calibration curve point were determined. A virus neutralizing unit (VNU) was determined for
each sample based on its percent signal relative to the calibration curve, where a VNU equals the
concentration of mAb10914 for the given percent signal multiplied by 100. A) Comparison with PRNT EC50.

Discussion
Numerous ELISA and rapid diagnostic tests have been developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, and several are approved in various countries for diagnostic testing. Yet, an easily
scalable clinical assay for detecting antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 has
remained relatively elusive. In particular, studies of vaccine efficacy and evaluations of
convalescing plasma therapies require high-throughput quantitative testing for anti-SARS-CoV2-neutralizing antibodies. Here, we describe our assay IMMUNO-COVTM for high-throughput,
quantitative, and clinically-validated measurement of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies at low
biocontainment (BSL2). We predict IMMUNO-COVTM will play a key role in screening donor
samples for SARS-CoV-2 convalescing plasma therapy trials and evaluating immune responses
to candidate vaccines, as well as offering further insights into SARS-CoV-2 immunity.
Our assay exploits the fusion phenotype of recombinant VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT to
produce quantitative luciferase signal in 96-well plate format, where virus neutralization by test
serum samples is detected as a reduction in luciferase activity (Figure 1). Importantly, results
from IMMUNO-COVTM correlated closely with plaque reduction neutralization EC50 values (p <
0.0001) determined using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 4 and Figure 7A). Thus,
neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT accurately reflects neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.
Recently, strong correlation was also observed between neutralization of other SARS-CoV-2
spike-expressing VSVs and SARS-CoV-2 (12,13), providing further evidence that inhibition of
replicating VSVs encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike mimics SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.
IMMUNO-COVTM is a validated laboratory developed test. In validation and verification
studies, the assay had 100% specificity, and no false positives were detected in any of the
testing performed (Tables 1, 2, and 3). All samples that tested positive by ELISA also tested
positive by IMMUNO-COVTM, which provided additional quantitation of the neutralizing antibody
levels. Two samples collected from donors that previously tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2

were negative in our assay. Because medical histories were self-reported, we were unable to
verify the accuracy of the PCR test results. Yet regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 status,
negative results in the IMMUNO-COVTM assay indicate that the neutralizing antibody response
is weak. Both samples were collected less than 3 weeks from the self-reported SARS-CoV-2
positive test, and certain factors can dampen or delay the development of robust antibody
responses. Moreover, neutralizing antibody responses represent a gradient of strengths.
Because it is not known at which point on the continuum an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody
response becomes adequately neutralizing to be considered protective, it is important to have
quantitative measures of neutralizing antibody responses, and it is difficult to conclusively define
an assay sensitivity. Using a borderline contrived control, 68.4% of samples were positive for
SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (Table 2). However, based on agreement with clinical
symptoms, assay sensitivity was at least 97.2% in tested serum samples (Table 3).
Additional validation studies are ongoing to define the long-term stability of critical reagents
and matrix samples. Early results from these studies are promising and indicate that serum
samples are stable under a variety of storage conditions and are not affected by up to three
freeze-thaw cycles. While our formal validation did not include plasma samples, experiments
with NL1 (Figure 4B, Figure 5B, and data not shown) indicated IMMUNO-COVTM is also
compatible with plasma samples.
Traditionally, assays that measure virus neutralizing antibodies rely on a series of serial
sample dilutions to quantitate the level of anti-viral antibodies present in each test sample as a
virus neutralizing titer or EC50 neutralizing titer (VNTEC50). A unique feature of IMMUNO-COVTM
is that quantitation of virus neutralization is performed without a full sample dilution series. By
testing samples at fewer dilutions, assay throughput is increased, and up to 41 samples can be
assayed in duplicate on a single 96-well plate with necessary controls (see example plate layout
in Figure 8). To improve assay sensitivity, testing is performed at the minimum recommended

dilution, which we determined during validation studies to be 1:100 (Figure 6). At this dilution,
approximately 83% of the samples tested fell within the linear range, though approximately 38%
of positive samples fell above the linear range. To extend the quantitation range for samples
containing high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, a second dilution, perhaps
1:1000, can be tested in a follow-up assay.

Figure 8: Example assay plate layout. All controls and samples are assayed in duplicate. A total of 41
samples (S1 to S41) can be run on a single plate using a single dilution for each sample. BC (background
control) consists of pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum at 1:100 without virus. NC (negative control),
consists of pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum at 1:100 with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT. NC is used
to determine 100% luciferase signal in the assay. St1 through St5 are standards for the calibration curve.
All standards are pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum at 1:100 with VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT and
mAb10914 spiked into each standard at different concentrations: Std1 is 3 µg/mL, Std2 is 1 µg/mL, Std3 is
0.33 µg/mL, Std4 is 0.11 µg/mL, and Std5 is 0.037 µg/mL.

Virus neutralization units (VNUs) are the unit of quantitation used in the IMMUNO-COVTM
assay. VNUs are calculated as 100X the amount of mAb10914 that yields the same percent
luciferase signal as the test sample based on a standard curve. The quantifiable range for
seropositive VNUs is approximately 20 to 200, which corresponds to concentrations of 0.2 to 2
µg/mL mAb10914. Because VNUs are an arbitrary value, it is useful to compare them to VNTs
when interpreting results in the context of traditional assays. VNUs and VNTEC50 values

correlated well (p < 0.0001) in the IMMUNO-COVTM assay (Figure 7B), providing a means for
relating VNUs to VNTs. As additional test samples are analyzed and data generated, the
comparison of VNUs and VNTs will be further refined.
Quantification of the strength of neutralizing antibody responses is absolutely required to
accurately assess immune responses to new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Strong antibody
responses are required for protective immunity, but concerns have also arisen regarding
potential antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. Studies with MERS and SARS-CoV
have demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in vitro (16,23–25). Studies in
non-human primates also suggest possible disease augmentation with increasing antibody
levels for SARS-CoV (26), and some evidence supports antibody-dependent enhancement in
clinical cases of SARS (27,28). Yet early studies using COVID-19 convalescing plasma to treat
severe cases of COVID-19 have shown great promise (3–5). How the ratio of total anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies may shift potential outcomes between
disease enhancement and resolution is not fully understood. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed
that strong neutralizing antibody responses are desirable for both vaccine responses and
convalescent plasma therapies. IMMUNO-COVTM offers the capacity for widespread clinical
testing of neutralizing antibody levels, which can accelerate evaluation and further development
of candidate vaccines and convalescing plasma therapies. Thus, IMMUNO-COVTM is a valuable
addition to the currently available repertoire of clinical tests.

37oC/5% CO2. To generate Vero-DSP1-Puro (Vero-DSP1) and Vero-DSP2-Puro (Vero-DSP2)
were generated by transducing Vero cells with lentiviral vectors SFFV-DSP1-7-P2A-Puro or
SFFV-DSP8-11-P2A-Puro encoding the Renilla Rluc8 luciferase-GFP split reporter DSP1 or
DSP2 (GenBank EF446136.1) (20) under control of the spleen focus forming virus (SFFV)
promoter and linked to the puromycin resistance gene via a P2A cleavage peptide. Transduced
cells were selected using 10 µg/mL puromycin. Following selection, Vero-DSP cells were
maintained in complete media supplemented with 5 µg/mL puromycin. Puromycin was excluded
when cells were seeded for assays.
Generation of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT: Full-length human codon-optimized SARS-CoV2 Spike (S) glycoprotein (NC_045512.2) in pUC57 was obtained from GenScript
(MC_0101081). The plasmid was used as a PCR template to generate a cDNA encoding
SARS-CoV-2 Spike with a deletion in the nucleotides encoding the C-terminal 19 amino acids
(S-19CT) and 5’ MluI and 3’ NheI restriction sites. To generate the viral genome, the amplified
PCR product containing S-19CT was cloned into pVSV-M51R in place of VSV-G using the
MluI and NheI restriction sites (Figure 2A). Plasmid was sequence verified and used for
infectious virus rescue on BHK-21 cells as previously described (30). VSV-G was co-transfected
into the BHK-21 cells to facilitate rescue but was not present in subsequent passages of the
virus. The virus was propagated in Vero-αHis cells by inoculating 80% confluent monolayers in
10-cm plates with 1 mL of virus. Viruses were harvested 48 hours after inoculation, aliquoted,
and stored at -80oC until use. Aliquots were used for tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)
assay on Vero-αHis cells.
Infections: Vero monolayers in 6-well plates were inoculated with OptiMEM alone (mock) or
2 mL of passage 3 VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT in OptiMEM. After 4 h at 37oC/5% CO2, fresh
OptiMEM was added to wells. Cells were returned to the 37oC/5% CO2 incubator until 20 h after
infection, when they were photographed at 100x magnification using an inverted microscope.

Reagents: EnduRenTM live cell substrate was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega #E6482). For inhibition studies, mouse α-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody
(GeneTex #GTX632604), affinity-purified polyclonal α-human-Ace-2 antibody (R&D Systems
#AF933), and recombinant human Ace-2 (R&D Systems #933-ZN-010) were diluted in
OptiMEM to the desired concentrations. mAb10914 is a human α-SARS-CoV-2 Spike
neutralizing monoclonal antibody that was prepared and scaled up using methods previously
described (31) by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (manuscript submitted).
Luciferase Assays: Assays were performed in 96-well black-walled plates with clear
bottoms. EnduRenTM substrate was added to wells (final concentration of 7.5 µM) at various
times after infection, but at least 2 hours before reading bioluminescence on a Tecan Infinity or
Tecan M Plex instrument (2000 ms integration, 200 ms settle time). For kinetic experiments,
repeated bioluminescence reads were performed without the addition of more EnduRenTM for up
to 24 hours after initial EnduRenTM addition; at later time points, additional EnduRenTM was
added to wells at least 2 hours prior to reading bioluminescence.
Collection of plasma and sera samples: A clinical protocol to collect blood samples for assay
validation was reviewed and approved by Western IRB (study ID: VYR-COV-001). Serum
samples were collected from patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
infection by a PCR test, from patients who had known exposure to individuals infected with
SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as a cohort of patients of were presumed
negative for antibodies, i.e. individuals who never had symptoms of COVID-19 disease and
were likely never exposed. Clinical information was self-reported. A total of 150 adults were
enrolled at BioTrial based in Newark, New Jersey and Olmsted Medical Center in Rochester,
Minnesota. Eighty additional sera aliquots from samples that had been tested using the
EPITOPE IgG ELISA (validated assay) were obtained from Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN.

Blinded sample testing: Sera samples were assigned a random ID prior to being given to
analysts for testing. Samples were assayed in batches, with an unknown number of positive and
negative samples in each batch. Each sample was assayed at a 1:100 dilution, with all positive
and some negative samples being further assayed in a dilution series including 1:100, 1:200,
1:400, 1:800, 1:1600, and for some samples 1:3200.
PRNT Assay: Sera was heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56oC and serially diluted 2-fold in
Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum. SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) (22) was diluted to approximately 200 PFU/mL and
mixed with an equal volume of diluted sera (final dilutions of serum with virus were 1:20, 1:40,
1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640, 1:1280, 1:2560, 1:5120, 1:10240, 1:20480, 1:40960). Virus mixed
with an equal volume of media alone was used as a control. After a 1 h incubation at 37oC, 250
µL of virus/serum or virus/media mixes were used to inoculate Vero-E6 monolayers in 6-well
plates. Inoculations proceeded for 1 h at 37oC with occasional rocking, before monolayers were
overlaid with 4 mL of 1.6% low-melting agarose in Minimal Essential Media supplemented with
4% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Plates were incubated at 37oC for 2 days when plaques
appeared, then fixed with 10% formaldehyde, and stained with 2 mL of 0.05% neutral red,
incubated for 6 h at 37oC. Plaques were counted and the number at each dilution was plotted
and used to determine the PRNT EC50 value for each sample by a nonlinear regression model.
Plaque counts greater than 30 were too numerous to count and were considered as equivalent
to the virus/media control.
Flow cytometry: Vero-DSP1-Puro cells were dislodged using Versene, counted, and
transferred to microcentrifuge tubes (5x105 cells/tube was used for Ace-2 staining and 1.5x106
cells/tube was used for TMPRSS2 staining). For Ace-2 staining, cells were pelleted and
resuspended in 100 µL FACS buffer (2% FBS in DPBS) containing 0.2 µg goat-α-human Ace-2
(R&D Systems #AF933). After 30 min on ice, cells were rinsed with 1 mL FACS buffer and

resuspended in 100 µL FACS buffer containing 5 µL donkey-α-goat IgG-PE secondary antibody.
After 30 min on ice, cells were rinsed with 1 mL FACS buffer and fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer, resuspended in
500 µL FACS buffer and analyzed on a CYTOFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). For
TMPRSS2 staining cells were resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold 70% ethanol in DPBS and
incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were centrifuged, washed once with 1 mL FACS buffer, and
resuspended in 100 µL of a 0.5% saponin solution containing 4 µg rabbit α-TMPRSS2
(Invitrogen #PA5-14264). After 30 min on ice, samples were washed twice with 1 mL FACS
buffer and resuspended in 100 µL of a 0.5% saponin solution containing 2 µL goat α-rabbit IgGAF647 secondary antibody. After 30 min on ice, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and
fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer,
resuspended in 500 µL FACS buffer and analyzed on a CYTOFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter). For both Ace-2 and TMPRSS2 staining, secondary antibody only controls were used
for isotype.
Immunoblot: Total cells and culture supernatants of Vero cells infected with VSV-GFP or
VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S-19CT or mock-infected were harvested 48 h after infection. Virus was
released from the cell membranes by freeze-thaw and cell debris was removed by
centrifugation. Samples were diluted in duplicate in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen #B0007) and
reducing agent (Invitrogen #B0009) according to the manufacturer’s directions, incubated at
70oC for 10 min, and 40 µL of each sample was ran on duplicate 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen
#NW04125Box) along with precision plus protein dual color standard (Bio-Rad #161-0374).
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Power Blotter XL. Membranes
were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST, washed three times with TBST, and incubated for
1 h at room temperature with primary antibody mouse α-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (1:1000, GeneTex
#GTX632604) or rabbit polyclonal α-VSV (1:5000, Imanis Life Sciences #REA005). Membranes

were washed three times with TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary
antibody goat α-mouse IgG-HRP (Prometheus #20-304) or goat α-rabbit IgG-HRP (Prometheus
#20-303) at 1:20,000. Membranes were washed three times with TBST, and protein bands were
developed for 2 min at room temperature using ProSignal® Dura ECL Reagent (Prometheus
#20-301). Protein bands were imaged using a BioRad ChemiDoc Imaging System.
Determination of percent luciferase signal and virus neutralization units: Raw relative light
unit (RLU) values for each well were blank corrected using the mean RLU value from
background wells receiving pooled SARS-CoV-2 seronegative serum at 1:100 but no virus. The
percent signal was determined for each sample well as the corrected RLU value divided by the
mean corrected RLU value from negative control wells receiving virus and pooled SARS-CoV-2
seronegative serum at 1:100. Samples with a percent signal < 50% for both sample replicates
were classified as positive. Samples with a percent signal ≥ 50% for both sample replicates
were classified as negative. When one replicate exhibited a positive response and the other a
negative response, the sample was classified as indeterminant and testing was repeated. Virus
neutralizing titers (VNUs) were determined for positive samples based on a calibration curve.
The calibration curve was run on each plate and consisted of mAb10914 spiked into pooled
SARS-CoV-2 seronegative sera at 3, 1, 0.33, 0.11, and 0.037 µg/mL. From the calibration
curve, the equivalent concentration of neutralizing antibody for a given percent signal was
determined. To convert to VNU, the antibody equivalent concentration was multiplied by 100.
Statistical Analyses: Descriptive statistics, comparisons, and regression analyses were
performed in Graph Pad Prism, v8.4.0 (San Diego, CA). Tests for normality of variance were
conducted, and whenever possible parametric comparisons were used. For non-normal
datasets, non-parametric approaches were used. A four-parameter non-linear regression was
used for the calibration curve of the virus neutralizing units within the assay. For correlation
analyses, Spearman’s or Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted.
