Abstract
The newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is closely related to SARS-CoV which emerged in 2002. Studies on
coronaviruses in general, and SARS in particular, have identified the virus spike protein (S) as being central to virus
tropism, to the generation of a protective antibody response and to the unambiguous detection of past infections. As a
result of this centrality SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a role in many aspects of research from vaccines to diagnostic
tests. We describe a number of recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 S expressed in commonly available expression
systems and their preliminary use in diagnostics and epitope mapping. These sources may find use in the current and
future analysis of the virus and the Covid-19 disease it causes.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19, Spike protein, expression, receptor, antibody, ELISA
Introduction
The appearance of Covid-19 in late 2019 and its subsequent
development to a pandemic have been widely reported [1].
Bioinformatics shows that the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, is
closely related to SARS, a beta coronavirus that caused an
epidemic in 2002/3 and probably emerged by zoonotic transfer
from an animal species [2, 3]. The basis of immunity for many
coronaviruses is the Spike protein (S), a 140kDa type I membrane
glycoprotein found on the surface of the virus. The SARS and
SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are >75% homologous at the amino acid
level and have many features in common, not least the use of the
same receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), for
virus entry. Recently determined structures of S in complex with
ACE2 have confirmed the same folded receptor binding domain
(RBD) in both S proteins, albeit slightly offset when compared
with each other [4, 5]. The SARS-CoV-2 S has a polybasic site
upstream of the S fusion peptide and preliminary experiments
show that proteolytic processing of S is required for cell entry [6,
7]. S is the principle neutralizing determinant of the virus and is
composed of two domains, S1 and S2. The S1 domain
encompasses the RBD while the S2 domain encodes the fusion
peptide, heptad repeats and transmembrane domain. Many
previous studies on SARS S have shown that while the full-length
molecule is sufficient for protection [8], S1 or the RBD alone offer
similar protection without the possibilities of enhancing
antibodies which have been reported in some cases [9, 10]. Thus,
S, or fragments of S encompassing the RBD, constitute candidate

vaccines for SARS-Cov-2 as well as being useful for the detection
and mapping of anti-S serum responses in convalescent or
vaccinated individuals [11, 12]. We describe a range of SARSCoV-2 S protein fragments produced in expression systems
available in most laboratories which may find application for
these purposes and for others investigating S structure-function
relationships.
Results
Expression of SARS-CoV-2 S and S fragments
A full-length sequence verified SARS-CoV-2 S construct acted as
template for a number of smaller fragments made by amplification
of the requisite sequence by high fidelity PCR. These fragments
were designed to encompass the known domains of S or to span
the entire S coding region as ~200 amino acids overlapping by
100 amino acids (Figure 1).

present (Figure 2B). However, direct IMAC of the S1 containing
supernatant in the presence of 0.5mM nickel sulphate resulted in
S1 that was ~85% pure (Figure 2B) with a yield of ~1mg/L (109
cells).

Figure 1. Cartoon representation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with
biological domains identified and the fragments used for S protein
expression in insect cells and E.coli.
The original full length constructs and all smaller fragments were
cloned into the multi-phylum expression vector pTriEx1.1 such
that the encoded S sequence was appended at the C-terminus with
a vector resident sequence encoding a polyhistidine tag for
detection and purification, as used elsewhere [13]. To provide
expression resilience and to facilitate different uses, two
expression systems were used to generate recombinant S proteins
and fragments thereof. Constructs encoding the full-length S and
the S1 domain were transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9)
with linearized baculovirus DNA for the generation of
recombinant baculoviruses [14]. In addition, all clones were
transformed into BL21 related strains for T7 polymerase driven
expression in E.coli.
Recombinant baculovirus stocks were used to infect small scale
cultures (1 x 106 cells) for confirmation of S protein expression.
Analysis of infected insect cells and culture supernatant at 3 days
post infection by western blot with an anti-His antibody showed
expression of S and S1 in cell extracts and, as expected, S1 in the
supernatant (Figure 2A). There was no evidence of an S2 band
(~70kDa) in the S expressing cells suggesting that the S protein is
not processed in insect cells, consistent with the requirement to
engage the receptor [4] or incompatibility with insect cell furin
[15]. Expression of S protein was also clear for full length S by
immunofluorescence (permeabilized cells) or on the surface of
cells as assessed by flow cytometry, both using an S reactive
human monoclonal antibody (Figure 2 C & D). Larger scale
cultures of S related proteins were expressed in T.nao38 cells [16]
and were purified following detergent lysis (S) or, in the case of
S1, clarification of the infected cell supernatant. Single passage
IMAC for the full length S protein enriched the non-glycosylated
and glycosylated forms of the protein which were confirmed by
western blot but also had a range of other insect cells proteins

Similar western blot analysis of total protein extracts following
induction of logarithmic phase E.coli cultures with IPTG
confirmed the expression of His-tagged S antigen of the predicted
molecular weight in all cases (Figure 3, upper panel). In general,
the shorter overlapping set of S fragments, including those that
spanned the RBD, were produced at higher levels than larger
fragments following a 3 hr induction. Further analysis of the Srelated proteins showed all well-expressed fragments to be
produced as inclusion bodies which remained the case following
low temperature induction (15OC). Retransformation of
SoluBL21 (AMS Biotechnology) and LOBSTR [17] strains did
not result in soluble protein expression despite titration of the
IPTG concentration used for induction and further work is
required on rescue strategies commonly in use to solubilize
inclusion bodies (e.g. [18]). Nevertheless, we found that S protein
fragments prepared for gel electrophoresis using non-reducing
loading buffer could be used successfully for epitope mapping of
2 S reactive monoclonal antibodies, 3G9, an unpublished mouse
mAb generated to SARS S, and CR3022, a human mAb also
isolated originally to SARS [19] but shown to cross-react with
SARS-CoV-2. A structure of the latter HuMAb in complex with
the RBD has recently been solved [20]. By blot 3G9 bound to
overlapping fragments c and d spanning resides 200-500, overlap

300-400 (Figure 3, middle panel) while CR3022 bound only to
fragment c (Figure 3, lower panel). CR3022 was previously
mapped to residues 369-519 which, in the modelled S trimer, are
only exposed in certain conformations [20]. Our mapping
suggests core binding by CR3022 can occur to a smaller region
than that suggested by the structural footprint, within residues
369-400, in keeping with its reported non-sensitivity to mutation
P462L [19].

cultures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with an anti His
antibody (top panel), mouse monoclonal antibody 3G9 (middle
panel) or CR3022 (lower panel). The lower two panels are
cropped but showed no reaction to RBD or S1 despite their
presence at detectable levels (upper panel).

Configuration and use
The principal purpose in generating SARS-CoV-2 S protein or
protein fragments were for studies of antibody binding or
antibody generation. Accordingly, we used S1 expressed and
purified from insect cells as an antigen for serum binding. 36
donated human sera from individuals, including some who had
experienced Covid-19-like symptoms, were assessed for S
reactivity. Preliminary titration experiments using an antibody to
the His tag determined that S1 coating at 4Î¼g per ml saturated the
plastic surface. In addition, assays using CR3022 spiked into
normal human plasma determined that, of several blocking
buffers assessed, blocking the plate with steelhead salmon serum
(Sea Block, Thermo Scientific), provided the lowest backgrounds.
Standard ELISA of the sera with these conditions led to the
identification of 5 sera (14%) as positive and 28 sera (77%) as
negative and these were discriminated clearly at either the 1:40 or

1:80 dilution points (Figure 4, inset). Three sera gave intermediate
binding curves and could not be unambiguously scored. The
titration curves for the 5 positives were similar with anti S1 titres
of ~500 in all cases (Figure 4).

on purified S1 protein starting at a dilution of 1:10. Inset:
Scatterplot of all sera (n=36) at 1:40 and 1:80 dilution points with
positives identified.
To provide an additional level of validation and to add epitope
specificity to the data, 2 of the sera scoring positive by S1 ELISA
were used as probes on western blots using full length S expressed
in insect cells (cf. Figure 2) and also on the overlapping set of S
fragments expressed in E.coli (cf. Figure 3). Both sera reacted
with full length S antigen (Figure 5A) and showed binding to
overlapping S fragments c and d, encompassing the RBD (Figure
5B). These data suggest that a second tier positivity test based on
western blot could be used as confirmation of past infection and
that, at least for antibodies able to bind to gel resolved antigen,
antibodies to the RBD are present in convalescent individuals.

Discussion
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 and its pandemic spread has led
to the reported expression of the virus encoded proteins, notably
the S protein, for structural study [4, 5], for immunisation [21] and
for diagnostics [22]. We have described recombinant sources of
several S related polypeptides from two common expression
systems, recombinant baculoviruses and E.coli and used the
proteins expressed for the analysis of seroconversion and for
epitope mapping. The particular properties of the insect cell
system, yield, robustness and the ability to perform at scale are
discussed elsewhere [23], similarly the use of the T7 system in
E.coli [24]. Using a set of overlapping S fragments we
demonstrated epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies 3G9 and
CR3022 to residues 300-400 of S. Interestingly, neither antibody
reacted with the RBD itself in the western blot format used despite
it encompassing the residues recognised. This suggests that each
fragment of S may adopt a variable level of refolding on the
membrane following transfer and emphasizes the value of the
overlapping fragment approach to enable epitope identification.
Of 28 residues in the RBD shown to interact with CR3022, 20 lie
within residues 369-393 [20] and this core region alone is
evidently sufficient to allow binding, as shown by interaction with
S fragment c here. The overlapping fragment set allowed mapping
of two human sera which also showed binding to the same region.
It remains to be determined how widespread this serum response
is in exposed individuals and if there is any correlation between
the epitope specificity of a serum and the titre or level of
neutralization.

The globular S1 domain of several coronaviruses is the preferred
antigen for sero-surveillance [6, 22, 25, 26] and purified SARSCoV-2 S1 was used similarly here. Full length S protein has been
used elsewhere [11] but the S2 domain which it includes can lead
to cross reaction as a result of previous coronavirus infections
[27]. Although we used purified S1, we have shown previously
that glycosylated antigen from infected insect cells captured to the
plate by a mannose specific lectin (GNA) can also be an effective
antigen, avoiding the need for protein purification in resource
limited situations [28]. We found evidence for ~14%
seroconversion in a set of random samples, some of which were
confirmed by western blot. The titre of all these sera was similar
and as no other information on the samples was available no
correlation with symptoms was possible although none of the
samples were from hospitalised individuals. The level of
seroconversion in the UK population is currently unknown
although unpublished data suggest a range of 5-10% [29].
Oxfordshire has a demonstrated positivity rate of 269 per 100,000
(Office for National Statistics) which, using a 50-fold factor for
non-tested but exposed individuals suggested from other studies
[30], would suggest an infection rate of ~13%, very close to our
observed positivity. Several studies of seroconversion have been
reported, in hospitalised individuals [22] and in the population
generally [27] but the general relationships among disease
severity, antibody titre, neutralisation, epitope profile and
longevity of response remain to be determined. The set of S
resources described here may contribute to studies in these areas.
Materials and Methods
Constructs
The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S (accession no. NC_045512) was
codon optimised for Spodoptera frugiperda cells and the resident
signal peptide exchanged for that of honeybee melittin [31] before
being ordered as two overlapping fragments (IDT Europe)
flanked by 18bps at the 5â and 3â ends homologous to the intended
expression vector, pTriEx1.1 (EMD Millipore). The 3â flanking
nucleotides were also designed to fuse the S open reading frame
in-frame to the vector resident polyhistidine encoding sequence (6
His residues). The gene was assembled at the same time as
recombination into the vector using infusion technology (NEB)
and the assembly reaction used to transform E.coli (NEB 10 beta).
Colonies positive by PCR screening using primers that flank the
cloning site were sequenced across the entire S coding region and
a single positive isolate adopted for all further manipulations.

Cell culture
Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and T.niao38 cells were maintained
in EX-CELL 420 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal
bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, at 27ËC with
shaking. Virus growth used exclusively Sf9s while protein
expression used predominantly T.niao38.
Baculovirus expression
Linearized baculovirus DNA was used to produce recombinant
baculoviruses [14]. Small-scale protein expression was performed
by infection of a 6-well plate seeded with 1 x 106 Sf9 cells per
well using 200Î¼l of a high titre stock of the recombinant
baculovirus, typically passage 3, and incubated for 5 days at 27Â°C.
After incubation, cells were harvested and used for antigen
detection.
E.coli expression
Constructs were transformed into E.coli T7 Express lysY (NEB)
and isolated by ampicillin resistance. Cultures were grown at
37OC to an OD600=0.6 and induced by the addition of IPTG to
0.4mM. Growth was continued at 27OC for 3 hr and cells
harvested and disrupted for gel or purification as required. SDSPAGE analysis used the equivalent of 50 Î¼l of culture per lane.
Solubility was gauged after lysis in Bugbuster (EMD) and gel
analysis of the soluble and pellet fractions. Alternate hosts used
were SoluBL21 (AMS Biotechnology) and LOBSTR [17].
Immunofluorescence
Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were dislodged by pipette
and washed twice with cold PBS for 5 minutes, then incubated in
fix and permeabilization buffers for 1hr at room temperature
(eBioscienceâ¢). Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated
with CR3022 at 2 Î¼g per ml for 1 hr at room temperature. They
were washed in PBS 3% BSA and then incubated with anti-human
AlexaFluor 555 conjugate for a further 1hr. The cells were washed
twice with TBS for 15 min each at room temperature mounted
with a drop of Slowfadeâ¢ Gold reagent before being imaged
using an EVOS-FL digital fluorescence microscope (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Cells for flow cytometry were processed
similarly, but without permeabilization, and data acquired using a
BD Accuri C6 Plus and analysed by FC Express v7 (De Novo
software).
Protein Purification
Infected insect cells were disrupted with CytoBusterâ¢ protein
extraction reagent (Merck) and clarified by centrifugation at 4,300

x g for 20m before column loading. For S1, the supernatant of
infected cells was clarified by centrifugation as above followed
by passage through a 0.8 micro filter. The clear supernatant was
adjusted to 0.5mM nickel sulphate to avoid stripping the IMAC
column before loading. In both cases IMAC chromatography was
done using a pre-prepared 5ml IMAC column (GE) operating at a
flow rate of 2.5 ml.min-1 with a gradient elution of 0.05-0.25M
imidazole over 60 minutes.
SDS-PAGE
Proteins were disrupted in NuPAGE loading buffer (Thermo) and
separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-12% precast Tris-Glycine SDS
polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for 30min at 200V. After
electrophoresis, gels were either stained with Coomassie blue
R250 or transferred to PVDF membranes for Western blot
analysis. For epitope mapping using overlapping S fragments,
inclusion bodies were disrupted in 3% SDS loading buffer without
reducing agent.
Western blot
Following semi-dry transfer to PVDF membranes, membranes
were incubated in TBST blocking buffer consisting of (5% of
skimmed milk powder, 0.2% Tween-20, 1 x TBS) for 1 hr.
Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody at 1:1,000
in 1x TBST buffer for 1hr followed by 3 x washes for 5 minutes
each in TBST buffer and if necessary with a secondary
horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) antibody conjugate (Sigma)
diluted 1:1,000 in 1x TBST for 1hr followed by 3 x washes for 5
minutes each with TBST buffer. The membrane was finally
washed with TBS and HRP activity detected using
chemiluminescence imagery.

ELISA
Microtitre plates (Nunc Maxisorb) were coated with S1 antigen at
4Î¼g per ml in 50mM sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH
9.6) for a minimum of 1 hour at room temperature. Excess antigen
was removed by washing three times with Super block (Thermo
Scientific) and unbound sites blocked using non-diluted Sea
Block. Samples were added at 1/10 dilution and diluted in a 2-fold
series thereafter, followed by 1 hr at room temperature. The plates
were washed five times with TBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween20 and polyclonal anti-human antibody conjugated to HRP
(Sigma) added for one hour at room temperature. Following
washing the chromogenic substrate TMB (Europa Bioproducts)
was added and colour development stopped by the addition of a
