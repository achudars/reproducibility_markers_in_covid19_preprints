Abstract

20

SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic in early 2020 and has resulted in more than 8,000,000

21

infections as well as 430,000 deaths in the world so far. Four structural proteins, envelope (E),

22

membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein, play a key role in controlling the

23

entry into human cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2. However, how these genes evolve

24

during its human to human transmission is largely unknown. In this study, we screened and

25

analyzed roughly 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from GenBank database. The distribution of the four

26

gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic

27

analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades

28

based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isn’t detected

29

among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these

30

genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8,

31

M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S

32

glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation

33

is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal

34

fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy

35

package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of

36

the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant

37

expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with

38

the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is

39

located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural

40

modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein

monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening,

42

virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F

43

mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first

44

evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a

45

better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for

46

developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation

sites.

Introduction

50

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of an

51

emerging coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has caused more than430,000 deaths, is still a

52

serious global pandemic currently. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is consisting of a single-stranded

53

and positive-sense RNA of around 30 kb in length with a 5’ cap and 3’-polyA tail. It shows that

54

SARS-CoV-2 genome possesses six major open reading frames (ORFs) that encodes 27 different

55

proteins, in which four are structural proteins named Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid

56

(N) and Spike (S). Many studies have demonstrated important functions of these proteins in virus

57

entry, transcription and virion particle assembly of SARS-CoV-2. The E protein is a small

58

envelope protein with 75 amino acids. Given that a close genetic relationship between

59

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, functions of this protein may include virion assembly and

60

morphogenesis[1]. In addition, induction of apoptosis of host cells might be another crucial

61

function of SARS-CoV-2 E protein, thus making it a potential determinant of viral pathogenesis

62

[2]. M protein, consisting of 222 amino acids, is the most abundant component of the viral

63

envelope and plays a key role in the virion assembly[3]. N protein, composed of 419 amino acids,

64

may form complexes with genomic RNA, interact with the viral membrane protein, and play a

65

critical role in enhancing the efficiency of virus transcription and assembly[4]. S protein,

66

consisting of 1,273 amino acids, is the most important factor that mediates virus entry and a

67

primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2[5].

68

Many studies demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 underwent the evolution and some genetic evolutionary

69

features have been reported[6]. The whole genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has 79.6% identity

70

with SARS-CoV and 96% with a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), RaTG13.

71

Although no positive time evolution signal was found between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the

72

SARS-CoV-2 shows a strong positive temporal evolution relationship with bat-SL-CoVZC45,

73

which has a slightly less identical genomic sequence (87.5%) than RaTG13 [7]. Combining the

74

phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes of coronaviruses, a potential bat origin of

75

SARS-CoV2 is indicated [8]. A recent study reported that spike (S) gene (coding gene of S protein)

76

of SARSr-CoVs from their natural reservoir host, the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus),

77

has coevolved with R. sinicus angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via positive selection[9].

78

A single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus as it is, SARS-CoV-2 causes global pandemic within

79

half a year, suggesting it may evolve rapidly. However, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 based on

80

structural genes from human to human transmission has not been investigated in detail. The

81

primary purpose of this work is to study the evolutionary pattern of the four structural genes of

82

SARS-CoV-2 derived from a global isolate collection including the E, M, N and S. Various

83

molecular evolution and selection analysis approaches were employed to identify the phylogeny of

84

the four structural proteins and potential selection effects on these genes. Hereby, our study

85

reveals that intragenic recombination does not contribute to the evolution of these genes while

86

purifying selection is the main evolutionary force. Moreover, a D614G mutation in the S protein is

87

operated by strong positive selection and may be responsible for the quick spread of SARS-CoV-2

88

globally. Additionally, another potential L5F mutation may also be operated by positive selection,

89

but with relatively less strong pressure as compared to D614G.

93

Complete full-length genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from 2019 Novel

94

Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) in China National Center for Bioinformation. All of which

95

were also uploaded to the NCBI GenBank database. The sequences were manually checked and

96

finally a total of 3090 isolates were selected and verified for the present study. These isolates were

97

collected from December 24, 2019 to April 24, 2020 in the different geographical locations

98

including China, USA, Japan, Pakistan, Australia, Greece, German, Peru, Turkey, Kazakhstan,

99

Iran, Serbia, Thailand, Nederland, Sri Lanka, Czech, Malaysia, India etc. Detailed information of

100

these isolates including the GenBank accession number or biosample number is summarized in S1

103

Sequence analysis of the four structural genes and proteins

104

The E, M, N, S gene sequences were extracted from SARS-CoV-2 global isolate collection and

105

aligned by the MEGA X package using Muscle (codons) parameters [10]. Because some regions

106

of genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 couldn’t be exactly identified, in which nucleic acid bases

107

are shown as degenerate bases (e.g. N, R, Y), we were unable to obtain all of the four structural

108

gene sequences from an isolate sometimes. Allele type and DNA sequence polymorphism analyses

109

were performed using DnaSP 6.12.03[11]. The protein sequences and polymorphism loci of these

110

isolates were also aligned and analyzed with the MEGA X.

111
112

Molecular evolution analysis

113

An unrooted phylogenetic tree of the four structural proteins was constructed using the MEGA X

114

package [10], and the evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method,

based on the JTT matrix-based model for E protein sequences, General Reversible Chloroplast +

116

Freq. model for M, JTT matrix-based model for N and Jones et al. w/freq. model for S protein

117

sequences. Model selection was conducted in MEGA X. Bootstrap values were estimated by 1000

118

replications. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying

119

Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using each model

120

mentioned above. The tree is drawn to scale, and FigTree V1.4 was utilized to form cladogram

121

branches (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). The aligned DNA sequences were also

122

screened using RDP4 software to detect intragenic recombination among the alleles of each

123

structural gene[12]. Six methods implemented in the RDP4 were utilized. These methods are RDP

124

[12], GENECONV[13], BootScan [14], MaxChi[15], Chimaera [16], and SiScan [17]. Common

125

settings for all methods include considering sequences as linear and setting statistical significance

126

at the P < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and requiring phylogenetic

127

evidence and polishing of breakpoints. Potential recombination events (PREs) were considered as

128

those identified by at least two methods. Reticulate network tree of alleles of the four structural

129

genes of SARS-CoV-2 was also generated by Splitstree4 [18]. Phi test implemented in Splitstree4

130

was used to define probable recombination events. Tajima’s D, Fu and Li’s D* and F* tests were

131

employed to test the mutation neutrality hypothesis of the whole gene as previously described by

132

our research group[19]. These analyses were carried out using DnaSP 6.12.03[11]. A statistical

133

significance level with P < 0.05 is acceptable. The false discovery rate and 1000 replications in a

134

coalescent simulation were applied for correcting multiple comparisons. Non-neutrality evolution

135

was considered when identified by at least two out of three tests. Nonsynonymous and

136

synonymous mutations of the alleles of the four structural genes were also calculated using MEGA

137

X package [10].

138
139

Analysis of positive selection based on codon

140

The selection pressure operating the four structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 was searched by using

141

the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. Analyses were performed using a visual tool of codeml

142

program, named EasyCodeML algorithm with site model [20]. Three nested models (M3 vs. M0,

143

M2a vs. M1a, and M8 vs. M7) were compared and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were applied to

144

access a better fit of codes. Model fitting was also performed using multiple seed values for dN/dS

145

and assuming the F3x4 model of codon frequencies. Positive selection is inferred when individual

146

site or codon with ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS ratios) is greater than

147

one (ω>1). When the LRT is significant (p <0.05), Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) (M8 model) and

148

Naive Empirical Bayes (NEB) methods (M3 and M2a model) are further employed to identify

149

amino acid residues that likely evolve under positive selection based on a posterior probability

150

threshold of 0.95. Results from M8 model were taken as the standard as Yang et al. reported. M3

151

model was used for the frequency distribution of codon class analysis as Yang et al.

152

recommended[21]. HyPhy package was used to validate the result obtained by ML method[22].

154

Structural modeling of the protein with positive selection sites

155

Three-dimensional structures of proteins with positive selection sites were modeled using

156

SWISS-MODEL (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) according to the most fitted protein template.

Model quality was evaluated by QMEAN while the structure of the model was visualized by using

Results and Discussion

161

Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, structural gene and protein

162

sequences

163

The 3090 SARS-CoV-2 isolates harbor only 16 unique alleles of E and 40 alleles of M, but an

164

abundant number of alleles of N and S genes, which contain 131 and 173, respectively. These

165

alleles correspond to 10, 14, 88 and 99 different amino acid sequences of E, M, N, and S proteins,

166

respectively. Protein sequence comparisons of WH01 isolate with SARSr-CoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45

167

isolate show 100% (75/75) identity in E, 98.65% (219/222) identity in M, 94.27% (395/419)

168

identity in N and 80.06% (1171/1273) in S proteins, respectively. These results imply a close

169

kinship between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARSr-CoV, especially on E and M proteins. On the other

170

hand, it indicates an extreme conservation of E and M proteins and their functions among

171

coronaviruses[24].

172

Further analysis revealed that there are 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of E gene, but

173

only 5 single amino acid polymorphic (SAP) loci in the E protein. Similar result was observed on

174

M gene and protein, with 37 SNPs and 9 SAPs. In contrast, 126 SNPs and 75 SAPs are detected

175

on N gene and protein, respectively. S protein, the most important factor that mediates virus entry

176

by receptor binding and membrane fusion and determines the infection ability of SARS-CoV-2

177

[25], harbors 155 SNPs on the alleles and 90 SAPs in the protein. Considering the size of

178

nucleotides and amino acid residues, N gene has the maximum sequence variability with 10.02%

179

(126/1257) SNPs and 17.90% (75/419) SAPs, respectively. However, S gene has most pairwise

180

nucleotide differences among the four structural genes, indicating a more genetic diversity of S

181

gene (Table 1). A key player in the virus transcription and assembly as N protein is [26, 27] , high

182

sequence variability of the N protein may indicate a vast adaption of the virus during host

183

transmission. Previous study shows that high genetic variance has been found among bat

184

SARSr-CoVs, particularly in the S gene[9]. Similar, higher nucleotide diversity ( π, a major

185

parameter to define genetic diversity) of S gene is also detected on SARS-CoV-2 isolates,

186

suggesting this may benefit virus survival in the host of human beings.

Distinct phylogenetic patterns of the four structural genes

199

The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all SARS-CoV-2 E proteins form three clusters. Similar to

200

E protein, phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 M proteins is formed by three clusters with few

201

branches (Figs 1A and 1B). The results suggest both E and M genes may display a relatively high

202

conservation during coronavirus evolution. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins show

203

distinct phylogenetic pattern as compared with that of E and M. Four and three main phylogenetic

204

clusters with various branches are identified in the N and S proteins, respectively (Figs 1C and D).

205

Given the crucial roles of N and S proteins in virus transcription, assembly, and entry to host cells,

206

whether SARS-CoV-2 isolates harbor different N and S variants (such as those clustered into

207

different clades) may influence their infection efficiency remains unknown, and requires further

208

study.

209

Purifying selection drives the evolution at whole structural gene

210

levels of SARS-CoV-2 during its human to human transmission

211

Although many studies demonstrated that recombination plays an important role on the emergence

212

of SARS-CoV-2 and its contribution to admit SARS-CoV-2 as a human infectious pathogen

213

[28-30], how this virus evolves during its global transmission has not been profiled yet. Therefore,

214

we first analyzed intragenic recombination events of each structural gene using RDP4. The results

215

indicate there were no recombination events occurred among the alleles of each gene (data not

216

shown). Recombination event were also assessed through reticulate network tree by phi test in

217

SplitsTree4. Although some internal nodes are noticed in N and S alleles, no significant evidence

218

for recombination is validated of each gene by Phi test (p>0.05) (Fig 2). It indicates a relative

219

stable state of SARS-CoV-2 during its transmission although a possible genetic interaction of

220

different isolates might have occurred when it became a global pandemic [31, 32]. In addition,

221

Tajima’s D, Fu and Li’s D* and F* statistics were calculated to examine the mutation neutrality

222

hypothesis of the four structural genes of SARS-CoV-2. The results reveal that the evolution of all

223

four genes does not match the neutral hypothesis, but favor purifying selection (Table 2 and Fig 3).

224

The average of all pairwise dN/dS ratios (ω) among the alleles of each structural gene of

225

SARS-CoV-2 is 0.5443 in E, 0.1562 in M, 0.07978 in N, and 0.4980 in S gene, respectively.

226

together, these results suggest that at the whole gene level, inconsistent purifying selection is the

main evolution force (Table 2).

228

of strong purifying selection in the S and other genes among bat, pangolin and human

229

coronaviruses, indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species [33].

230

Similarly, our results suggest purifying selection drives the evolution at the whole structural gene

231

level of SARS-CoV-2 during its transmission from human to human. This result also implies that

232

in general, the genetic variation on these structural genes will not confer a significant disadvantage

233

on the virus survival, and ratios reflect general variability of these genes and proteins. Considering

234

that no recombination happened, nonsynonymous mutations would be removed at a great rate

235

during the virus transmission [34].

codon located at the C-terminal portion of S1 subunit and a potential

codon located at the signal sequence

242

Guo et al. reported that the S gene of SARSr-CoV populations in their natural host, Chinese

243

horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), has evolved through positive selection at some codons[9]. As

244

mentioned above, at the whole gene level, purifying selection is the main force driving the

245

evolution of studied genes. Whether positive selection pressure accelerates the diversification of

246

the structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Therefore, we used codon-substitution

247

models to estimate the ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), also

248

known as ω. The role of recombination in the polymorphism of four genes is excluded because no

249

intragenic recombination was detected (Fig 2). By using ML model, we don’t find any codon of E

250

and M gene subjecting to positive selection obviously (data not shown). However, a potential

251

positive selection site 208A in N gene is identified by using M3 model, but not by any other

252

models especially the M8 model, suggesting a limited amount of evidence of positive selection in

253

N gene (S1 Table). For the S gene, we found the average

254

the codeML package, suggesting that purifying selection was a major force operating the

255

evolution of the S gene during its transmission among human beings. In three LRTs, all alternative

256

models (M3, M2a, M8) are significantly better fit (P<10-4) than relevant null models (M0, M1a,

257

M7), indicating that some sites of S were subjected to strong positive selection

258

(ω=18.22175-20.61283) (Table 3). A single positive selection site (614D) is identified in the S

259

gene with posterior probability of 1.000 in all the three models [21], a clear evidence showing that

260

this site is still experiencing positive selection when the virus transmitted from human to human.

261

The result is also validated using internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary

262

Fingerprinting methods implemented in HyPhy package (Fig 4) [35-37]. To our surprise, the

263

positive selection site is not located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) or receptor binding

264

motif (RBM) as we anticipated, which play the most important role in virus-receptor interaction

265

and virus entry into host cells [38]. This result suggests that a relatively genetic stability of this

266

motif would benefit the virus survival. Intriguingly, the site under positive selection pressure

ω is 0.37199 calculated by M0 model of

267

always has a D614G (for the S gene is 1841A>G) mutation, implying such mutation may enhance

268

virus adaptability in human hosts. Another potential positive selection site at codon 5 is also

269

identified, and a L5F mutation (for the S gene is 13C>T) is always found, with posterior

270

probabilities greater than 0.95, 0.93 and 0.92 (critical values) calculated by M3, M2a and M8

271

models (Table 3), respectively. Similar result was also confirmed by Evolutionary Fingerprinting

272

method (S1 Fig). Considering signal sequence (SS) is a short hydrophobic peptide that plays an

273

important role in guiding viral protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for proper folding and

274

assembly [39], we postulate that L5F mutation may increase hydrophobicity of the SS, thus

275

facilitating the entry of S protein into ER for folding and assembly, and in turn secretion of the

276

virus.

Evolutionary relationship of S gene alleles with or without D614G

285

and L5F mutation

286

Phylogenetic tree of S gene alleles was derived to test the evolutionary relationship among the

287

alleles with or without D614G mutation. As shown in Fig 5A, the 173 alleles of the S gene could

288

be clustered into four clades. Alleles with D614G mutation could be found in all 4 clades, among

289

which a dominant one contains 79 out of 85 alleles with such mutation. The remaining 6 mutated

290

S alleles are distributed in other 3 clades. The result suggests a potential common ancestor for the

291

majority of S alleles with D614G mutation, while some other maybe derived from alternative

292

ancestors. This result is also supported by the parsimony network of S gene alleles using PopART

293

(http://popart.otago.ac.nz) [40]. Two central alleles (representative virus isolates are WH01 and

294

GZMU0019) and associated alleles around them form a star scattering network, suggesting that

295

the S gene may have two potential origins (Fig 5B). All S alleles with D614G mutation are closely

296

related (with a few point mutations), and comprise a scattered star structure, suggesting the

297

expansion of SARS-CoV-2 population with D614G mutation on S gene. In contrast, alleles of the

298

N gene show a single ancestor analyzed by parsimony network though 3 phylogenetic clades are

299

identified (S2 Fig).

300

A total of 5 alleles with L5F mutation are found and all of them are in one clade, accounting for

301

83.33% of all alleles in the clade (S3A Fig). Further parsimony network analysis reveals that S

302

alleles with L5F mutation are not closely related, but distribute in both WH01 and GZMU0019

303

haplotype groups (S3B Fig). No scattered star structure of these alleles can be formed, indicating

304

L5F mutation might arise from independent origins other than that of D614G mutants. Limited

305

number of alleles with L5F mutation identified so far also suggests that L5F might subject to

306

relatively less strength of the pressure and is still at early stage of positive selection.

307
308

Frequency of S allele with D614G mutation increased in SARS-CoV-2

309

isolates during human to human transmission

310

Considering that mutation of a positive selection site should be beneficial to the survival of the

311

individuals carrying the mutation, we postulate that the D614G (1841A>G) mutation may help the

312

spread of SARS-CoV-2. Some evidence has been obtained from the haplotype network of S alleles

313

mentioned above (Fig 5B). S gene haplotypes (alleles) with D614G mutation (representative

314

isolate GZMU0019) have evolved many subtypes and comprise a star structure with GZMU0019

315

in the center. This starburst pattern with one haplotype in the center and many other haplotypes

316

surrounding the central haplotype suggests a signature of rapid population expansion [41]. To

317

further study whether SARS-CoV-2 isolates with D614G mutation have advantage in survival

318

during its transmission among human beings, we calculated the frequencies of S alleles carrying

319

D614G mutation in each week from the collected SARS-CoV-2 isolates from December 24, 2019

320

to April 20, 2020 (17 weeks). Detailed information of these isolates including collection date,

321

collection region and accession or biosample numbers is summarized on S3 and S4 Tables.

322

In 173 S gene alleles, 85 carry D614G mutation, accounting for 49.13% of all. Similarly, 47 out 99

323

S proteins carry D614G mutation, accounting for 47.47% of all. The first two isolates,

324

GWHABKF00000001 and WH01 (isolated in December 24, 2019 and December 26, 2019,

325

respectively), carry 614D in the S protein, while the first SARS-CoV-2 isolate with a D614G

326

mutation is GZMU0019 in our collected dataset, isolated from a patient with COVID-19 on

327

February 5, 2020 (week 7 in our dataset). After that, except for week 9 and week 10 (possibly due

328

to the small number of samples and sampling deviation), a spread trend that more and more

329

proportion of isolates carry the D614G mutation in the S protein stands out. In the week 17, the

330

last week of our dataset, 91.11% of SARS-CoV-2 isolates carry this mutation (S3 Table, Fig 6A).

331

Further analysis reveals that the frequency of D614G mutation in the S gene was steadily

332

increasing when combining data from week 6 to 17 (S3 Table, Fig 6B). To exclude the influence

333

of sample size on the result (in some weeks, only 4-6 isolates were collected in the dataset), we

334

reorganized the dataset by taking both the sample size and sampling time into account. Various

335

panels of 200-300 isolates were studied and similar results were observed (S4 Table, Figs 6C and

336

D). Taken together, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 isolates with D614G mutation may

337

increase their ability to transmit, and contribute to the rapid spread of this virus to the world.

338
339

D614G mutation of S gene may destabilize S protein trimer and

340

promote receptor binding and membrane fusion

341

The positive selected D614G mutation might play an important role for the adaptability of

342

SARS-CoV-2 in both the host and the virus population[42]. Another explanation is that the

343

mutation is driven by specific interaction between high level of virus sequence divergence and

344

polymorphic host receptors or interacting proteins[43]. S protein is the key determinant for the

345

tissue tropism and host range and specificity of coronavirus such as SARS-CoV-2. The virus

346

infects host cells through the interaction between the S protein and its cellular receptor, named

347

ACE2 [8]. In this process, virus entry requires the precursor S protein cleaved by cellular

348

proteases including trypsin, furin, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), or endosomal

349

cathepsin L, which generate the receptor binding subunit S1 and the membrane fusion S2 [44-46].

350

From structural studies in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, receptor binding domain (RBD)

351

located at the C-terminal of S1 and the adjacent N-terminal domain (NTD) are relatively flexible,

352

which is the feature required for receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion[47, 48].

353

We found that the D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) that at the C-terminal of

354

RBD and close to the two potential cleavage sites between S1 and S2 [48] (Fig 7A). Considering

355

that positive selection is usually beneficial to the survival of the individual carrying the mutation,

356

we speculate that the D614G mutation may facilitate structural conformation change to promote

357

receptor binding or membrane fusion[5, 44], and in turn improving the infection efficiency. From

358

the latest cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, the negatively

359

charged sidechain of D614 points towards the positively charged sidechain of K854 from the

360

neighboring monomer (Fig 7B) [48] . The distance between the closest atoms of the two residues

361

is 2.6 Å, which is an optimal distance to form salt bridge (Fig 7C). From the modelled structure

362

with D614G mutation, the distance is increased to 5.2 Å (Fig 7D), which would potentially abolish

363

the salt bridge and destabilize the integrity of the S trimer in wild type. It has been reported that

364

human receptor ACE2 binds to an “open” conformation of S protein, where RBD move away from

365

the core structure and expose its receptor binding surface. The entire S trimer then undergoes a

366

serial of dramatic conformation changes, including cleavages between S1 and S2, disassociation

367

of S1 and post-fusion transformation of S2 [49, 50]. Changes including mutations at cleavage sites

368

and adding internal crosslinks in S trimer would keep the protein in a stable and “closed”

369

conformation where the receptor binding surface of RBD is inaccessible [48, 51]. Therefore, we

370

hypothesize that the highly transmissible D614G mutation driven by the positive selection through

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.170688; this version posted June 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

371

evolution promotes accessibility of RBD by losing a critical salt bridge between the S protein

372

monomers, which subsequently triggers membrane fusion upon ACE2 binding.

373
374

Conclusions

375

We present modern molecular evolution analyses on a large and comparative set of SARS-CoV-2

376

structural gene sequences, derived from an international collection of SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

377

Distinct phylogenetic patterns of four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are depicted. Protein

378

sequence comparisons show E and M genes exhibit a relatively close relationship to bat

379

SARSr-CoV, suggesting the evolution conservation of these two genes. In contrast, relatively high

380

genetic variation is observed in N and S proteins among SARS-CoV-2 isolates, implying extensive

381

adaptability of N and S genes. No clear intragenic recombination is detected of these four genes,

382

suggesting that it is not the major force to drive the evolution of the four genes. However, our

383

analyses show purifying selection pressure may be the main force operating the evolution at whole

384

gene levels of SARS-CoV-2 during its human to human transmission. We also identify a codon in

385

S gene definitively experiencing positive selection pressure, and always leads to the D614G

386

mutation in S proteins. S alleles with D614G mutation have expanded rapidly among

387

SARS-CoV-2 isolates. D614G mutation significantly extends the distance between monomers in

388

the S protein trimer, which may disrupt the salt bridge formed by D614 and K854 between

389

monomers, promote RBD opening, and facilitate the entry of the virus into host cells, thus

390

contributing to the diffusion of this mutated alleles. Codon 5 of S gene is another potential positive

391

selection site. Although a limited number of alleles with L5F mutation is identified, it may

392

potentially affect the assembly and secretion of SARS-CoV-2. A close eye on L5F mutation may

393

be required in case another expansion occurs. As S protein is a key target for SARS-CoV-2

394

vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics, the D614G mutation of S should be paid more

395

attention. Owning that the exact mechanism remains unclear, further study should focus on the

396

exact function of these mutation sites and how they affect the expansion of these mutated alleles

397

on SARS-CoV-2.
