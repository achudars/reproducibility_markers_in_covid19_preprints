Abstract
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans leads to the disease COVID-19, has caused global
disruption and more than 1.5 million fatalities since it first emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection
rates are currently at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to
more infectious variants. The primary viral target is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predicts that many nonhuman primates are also
likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order.
Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit
high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2
sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades
despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual
strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results and finds
additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high
potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and
Endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and
Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates
at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their
health should be a conservation priority. All feasible actions should be taken to limit their exposure to
SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

On Tuesday September 22, 2020, the one-millionth human death officially attributed to COVID-19 was
documented by the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center (BBC News, 2020). Since
this date the rates of infection by the virus responsible for this disease, SARS-CoV-2, have increased in
most countries. As we write, we are reaching new global highs in active cases and witnessing the spread
of new, more transmissible variants (Mahase, 2020; World Health Organization, 2020). As coordinated
efforts within and across institutions, countries, and continents seek to identify treatments, develop
vaccines, and curb the spread of this highly contagious virus, attention has also turned to the potential
risks posed to nonhuman species (Damas et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Melin et al., 2020; Wu et al.,
2020). Zoonotic transfer of diseases from humans to nonhuman primates poses a major risk given the

many physiological and genetic similarities shared within the Order Primates, and is a potentially grave
risk to already endangered and fragmented populations (Gillespie & Leendertz, 2020).

In recent studies, the susceptibility of primates and other mammals to potential SARS-CoV-2 infection
has been assessed by analysis of the gene sequences that code for the primary viral target, angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE2; (Damas et al., 2020; Delgado Blanco et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Melin et
al., 2020)). Receptor-virus interaction models, including by members of the present authorship, have
highlighted the likely susceptibility of many species, especially of apes and monkeys of Africa and Asia
(Parvorder Catarrhini); meanwhile, monkeys in the Americas (Parvorder Platyrrhini) are predicted to
exhibit lower susceptibility (Liu et al., 2020; Melin et al., 2020). One striking feature of these analyses is
the uniformity within these parvorders. Across the identified primary viral binding sites, all catarrhines
exhibit one set of amino acid residues, and all platyrrhines another. Surprisingly, although gene sequences
are only publicly available for a few strepsirrhine species (four lemurs and one galago), ACE2 variation
in that suborder far exceeds variation present in the rest of the primate taxa examined to date (24 species
spanning 21 genera and including tarsiers (1), platyrrhines (6), and catarrhines (14)). Of particular
concern is the high sequence similarity at binding sites to human ACE2 of some lemur ACE2 proteins,
including aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and Coquerel’s sifakas (Propithecus coquereli),
which exhibited residues that are far more similar to those of humans and other catarrhines than to those
present in platyrrhines (monkeys of the Americas) (Melin et al., 2020).

These findings raise questions about the variability and molecular evolution of the ACE2 gene across
Strepsirrhini, as well as about the potential susceptibility to initial infection by SARS-CoV-2 of different
species across the suborder. Here, we expand substantially on previous reports of strepsirrhine ACE2
variation (Damas et al., 2020; Melin et al., 2020). We report 71 ACE2 gene sequences, including 66 from
unpublished strepsirrhine genomes, spanning 39 lemuriform and 12 lorisiform species. For residue
variants that have not been previously identified and assessed, we model the interactions between the
translated ACE2 protein and the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to predict the
susceptibility of species to initial infection by SARS-CoV-2. In doing so, we seek to improve our
understanding of ACE2 variation and evolution, and to identify which strepsirrhine species are likely to
be most at risk from the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that disease development, progression and
pathogenesis in any given species will also be impacted by factors influencing the efficacy of viral
cellular entry and taxon-specific immune responses (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Lukassen et
al., 2020). Nonetheless, our hope is that our analysis of the initial susceptibility of different lemur and

loris species to SARS-CoV-2 infection will help to inform decisions on how best to proceed with
strepsirrhine research and management programs.

Methods

Study Species
We examined the ACE2 gene sequence of 71 individual strepsirrhines - 66 newly sequenced individuals
as part of the Primate Variation Genome Consortium (in preparation, Supple. Table 1), plus five obtained
from publicly available genomes 6: Otolemur garnettii (Northern greater galago), accession no:
XM_003791864.2, gene ID: 100951881; Propithecus coquereli (Coquerel's sifaka), accession no:
XM_012638731.1, gene ID: 105805773; Microcebus murinus (gray mouse lemur) accession no:
XM_020285237.1, gene ID: 105882317; Eulemur flavifrons (blue-eyed black lemur), accession no:
LGHW01000591.1, scaffold 590 (gene identified via BLAST); Daubentonia madagascariensis, (aye-aye)
accession no: PVJZ01006595.1, scaffold 13170, (gene identified via BLAST). In total, we analyze the
ACE2 gene and protein sequences of 51 species (39 Lemuriformes and 12 Lorisiformes) and 19 genera
(12 Lemuriformes and 7 Lorisiformes) (Table 1; Supple. Table 1). In addition, we model the impact of
residues at binding sites recently reported for Indri indri ACE2 protein (Damas et al., 2020), adding
another genus of lemur to our survey.

Gene Alignments
We mapped reads from whole-genome sequence (WGS) data to the closest available annotated reference
assembly from among the set of partially unpublished (unp.) references (Daubentonia madagascariensis,
(unp.) Galago moholi (unp.), Propithecus coquereli (GCF_000956105.1), Lemur catta (unp.), Loris
tardigradus (unp.), Microcebus murinus (unp.), Nycticebus pygmaeus (unp.) and Otolemur garnettii
(unp.). Briefly, after removing adapter sequences using cutadapt, we mapped the reads using bwa mem
and processed and sorted alignments using samtools. We removed duplicates using biobambam, and
added read groups for variant calling using picard. We called variants using GATK4 HaplotypeCaller (v
4.1.6) following best practice pipelines (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org). After applying a set of standard
hard filters, we extracted the coding regions of ACE2 gene sequences and introduced homozygous
alternative calls to create the putative coding sequence of each individual. We extracted and aligned
ACE2 gene sequences from the variant call files, which were then translated into protein sequences. The
consensus sequences were manually inspected and corrected where needed to remove gene-flanking
regions. We manually verified the absence of indels and premature stop codons for each individual. We

then aligned these 66 amino acid sequences using MAFFT with default settings with those extracted from
publicly available genomes (Melin et al., 2020). The full nucleotide and amino acid alignments used here
are provided as a data table in the Supporting Information. Following alignment, we examined amino acid
sequence variation within and across species along the length of the ACE2 protein, and specifically at the
sites that are critical for SARS-CoV-2 binding.

Variation in ACE2 sequences at critical sites and impact on SARS-CoV-2 binding
Our method for identifying critical contact sites between the ACE2 protein and the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is detailed in (Melin et al., 2020). Briefly, we conducted
alanine scanning mutagenesis to assess the contribution of each human ACE2 residue to protein-protein
complex formation with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Bogan & Thorn, 1998; Kortemme & Baker, 2002;
Massova & Kollman, 1999). Alanine scanning is a commonly used method, and alanine is chosen
because it is the smallest residue that may be incorporated without significantly impacting the protein
backbone conformation (Kortemme et al., 2004). We defined critical residues as those that upon mutation
to alanine decrease the binding energy by a threshold value ΔΔGbind

≥1.0 kcal/mol. Nine sites meet this

criterion (Supple. Table 2). To be conservative, we also examined amino acid variation at additional sites
that were identified as important by different but complementary methods - cryo EM and X-ray
crystallography structural analysis (Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al.,
2020). While some of these sites overlap with the critical sites we identified using alanine scanning, three
do not - alanine scanning also identifies these as binding sites, but with ΔΔGbind <1.0 kcal/mol. For the
present analyses, and as in Melin et al. 2020, we added these three sites suggested by other methods to be
especially important binding sites to our nine sites for a total of 12 critical sites (Supple. Table 2). All
computational alanine scanning mutagenesis analyses were performed using Rosetta (Jochim & Arora,
2010; Kortemme et al., 2004; Raj et al., 2013).

To model how variation in the ACE2 amino acid sequences across species affects the relative binding
energy of the ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 interaction, we used the SSIPe program (Huang et al., 2019). This
algorithm mutates selected residues and compares the resulting binding energy to that of human ACE2
bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD as a benchmark (PDB 6M0J). We modeled the full suite of amino acid
changes occurring at critical binding sites for all unique ACE2 sequences. We further examined the
predicted effect of each individual amino acid change (in isolation) on protein-binding affinity to better
understand each residue’s contribution to variation in binding affinity.

Variation in ACE2 sequences at critical sites and impact on SARS-CoV-2 binding
We examined variation along the length of the ACE2 protein sequence for the 66 newly sequenced
individuals and the ACE2 sequences from the five genomes available at NCBI. Sequences are conserved
within, but are variable across, strepsirrhine genera. The mean pairwise amino acid sequence identity
along the length of the ACE2 protein within genera is 99.25% (mean amino acid substitutions = 5.85).
The mean amino acid sequence identity between lemur genera was 91.67%, and between lorisiform
genera was 92.72%. When we focused solely on the critical binding sites, the pairwise amino acid identity
at binding sites within genera was 100%, indicating an absence of any amino acid variation among
species in the same genus in our study. Differences between genera are also present at the critical binding
sites (Figure 1), especially among lemurs, where the mean pairwise amino acid sequence identity is
83.18%. The mean pairwise amino acid sequence identity at binding sites between lorisiform genera is
95.04%.

We found three novel variants not previously reported for any primate at three critical binding sites: H24
(Arctocebus, Perodicticus), F83 (Galagoides), and Q353 (Cheirogaleus)). The remaining binding site
variation is consistent with previous reports. The combination of residues (E24, T82) previously reported
for Eulemur flavifrons, is also found in other species of Eulemur, as well as in Hapalemur, Lemur, and
Prolemur. The critical binding site composition found in Indri indri (Damas et al., 2020) is not found in
any of the genera we sequenced here. The residues at binding sites 37, 42, 355 and 357 are invariant
across all strepsirrhines examined. None of the strepsirrhine ACE2 proteins are modeled to have higher
binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 than the human (catarrhine) form (Table 1A). Among the 12 critical
sites, the substitutions causing the starkest drop in viral-receptor binding affinity relative to the human
sequence are Y41H and M82N (Table 1B). The former substitution is found in all lorisoids and in
sportive, dwarf, mouse, and giant mouse lemurs. The latter substitution is only identified in Indri indri,
although a different substitution at the same site occurs in all other strepsirrhines (M82T); other mutations
had lesser effects (Table 1B).

Looking at taxon-specific predictions based on the entire complement of amino acids at critical binding
sites, the species predicted to be most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection are in the genera Avahi,
Propithecus, and Daubentonia (Table 1A). These taxa differ from humans at only one critical binding
site, M82T, which is predicted to lower the binding affinity between the ACE2 receptor and the SARSCoV-2 virus by 5-fold. These genera are followed by species in the genera Eulemur, Lemur, Prolemur
and Varecia, which differ in one additional (Q24E) substitution, which should further lower the binding

affinity by 2-fold. In potentially promising results, we predict that the lorises, galagos, and the dwarf,
mouse, giant mouse, and sportive lemurs are far less susceptible to infection than humans. This is
primarily due to a Y41H mutation, although additional changes in amino acids at binding sites further
lower the affinity between their ACE2 and the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The decreases in
the modeled binding affinity range from 0.9 ΔΔG (kcal/mol) (Avahi, Propithecus, Daubentonia; predicted
most susceptible) to 5.0 ΔΔG (kcal/mol)a (Cheirogaleus, predicted least susceptible), relative to human
ACE2 (Table 1A).

Discussion

We report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 19 genera of strepsirrhine primates, spanning 51 species
and 71 individuals, and examine these together with the Indri indri ACE2 protein. We confirm previous
reports of the amino acid residue composition at viral binding sites for Daubentonia, Propithecus,
Eulemur, Microcebus, and Otolemur (Damas et al., 2020; Melin et al., 2020). Additionally, we identified
three novel variants at the following key binding sites: H24, F8, Q353. These variants are modeled to be
protective and not found in species reported in the previous analyses of a small subset of strepsirrhine
species (Melin et al. 2020), and were also not found among previous analyses of primates more generally.
Relative to variation seen in catarrhines and platyrrhines, strepsirrhine ACE2 variation across genera at
critical binding sites is remarkably high, especially among lemurs. In addition to reporting new ACE2
sequences spanning many strepsirrhine species, we also provide the first examination of intraspecific
variation in ACE2 sequences outside of humans and vervet monkeys (Cao et al., 2020; Schmitt et al.,
2020; Stawiski et al., 2020). We find that ACE2 proteins are highly conserved within species and within
genera, at least for the taxa examined. Although our intraspecific and intrageneric sample sizes are small,
this indicates that members of the same species and closely related species are likely to share similar
initial susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This allows predictions to be made regarding the likely
susceptibility of species that are not included in our analyses, but that are closely-related to studied
species.

As with all studies based on predictive modeling, our results should be interpreted with caution,
especially those results which predict that some strepsirrhines might be at lower risk. Our results require
experimental validation. Additional limitations include that our study examined variation at sites
identified to be critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral binding, but did not assess the impact of residues that are
not in direct contact with the virus and which may still affect binding allosterically. In addition, we did
not examine genetic variation or model the function of the protease (TMPRSS2) that facilitates viral entry

post binding (Hoffman et al. 2020), which is anticipated to impact disease progression. We also
emphasize that our approach investigates the likely initial susceptibility of species to SARS-CoV-2
infection. The severity of viral infection responses may differ between species and is related to variation
in immune and other responses (Lukassen et al., 2020). Nonetheless, the results of in vivo infection
studies conducted on haplorrhine primates and other mammals strongly support the predictions of proteinprotein interaction models about the susceptibility of different species to SARS-CoV-2 and the
development of COVID-19-like symptoms (Blair et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2020; Shan et
al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020), supporting the applicability of our results. An additional tangible contribution
of our study is that it provides novel sequence data that can be used in site-directed mutagenesis to
recreate taxon-specific ACE2 proteins for cellular assays (Guy et al., 2005). At the same time, results
predicting high susceptibility among a large number of genera are sufficiently alarming as to warrant
special care and attention when interacting with these species in wild and captive management settings,
including zoological parks, where humans frequently come into contact with vulnerable species (for
example, in walk-through lemur exhibits).

The predictions of our study suggest that, among the strepsirrhines, the lemurs of the families Indriidae,
Daubentoniidae, and to a lesser extent, Lemuridae are likely to be particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2
infection. Lemurs are considered to be among the most threatened vertebrates globally, with over 94% of
extant species being threatened with extinction (Schwitzer et al., 2014; IUCN, 2021). High rates of
deforestation that result from changing land-use patterns coupled with high human population growth are
among the most potent threats to lemur populations (Elmqvist et al., 2007; Harper et al., 2007). Besides
habitat loss, these human-induced disturbances are exposing wild lemur populations to novel interactions
with humans and domestic animals, and in so doing increasing risks of disease outbreaks (Barrett et al.,
2013). Current knowledge on the disease ecology of wild lemurs suggests that populations that are found
in disturbed habitats and/or those with a high volume of tourists are at elevated risk of bearing pathogens
that are found in humans, livestock, and domestic animals (Bublitz et al., 2015; Junge, Barrett, and Yoder,
2011; Rasambainarivo et al., 2013). Furthermore, lemurs in general, including many of the larger bodied
species that are predicted to be most at risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2, are highly vulnerable to new
diseases because they are considered to be immunologically naïve, and unlikely to persist through a major
epidemic outbreak (Junge 2007).

Historically, conservationists in Madagascar have strived to implement integrative conservation programs
to protect the biological uniqueness of the island while leveraging the sustainable development of local
communities (Corson, 2017). Conservation programs on the island implement strategies that include

ecological research, monitoring, and restoration, agricultural intensification, alternative income sources
such as ecotourism, and education (e.g., Wright et al., 2012; Birkinshaw et al., 2013; Dolins et al., 2010).
In addition to the considerable conservation obstacles exacerbated by frequent political unrest and
extreme poverty (Schwitzer et al., 2014), initiatives in Madagascar now have the concern of a viral
pandemic in the human population, which appears likely to pose a direct and serious risk to many lemurs.
Recently, there has been an emergence of integrated conservation programs that include a human health
component e.g. (Mohan and Shellard, 2014; Garchitorena et al., 2018), a likely necessary shift in a
country with one of the lowest levels of financing for the healthcare system (Barmania, 2015). This is
particularly urgent given that COVID-19 could potentially infect up to 30% of the human population
(Evans et al., 2020). Furthermore, Madagascar lacks a legal framework to guide best research practices to
limit exposure of lemur population to diseases, in contrast, for example, to their great ape counterparts
(see Gilardi et al. 2015). It is important that all stakeholders involved in the conservation of lemurs
coordinate to draft such guidelines, which should include safeguards against relatively close contacts
between people and lemurs that emerge as part of the successful and widespread community-based
conservation programs. At a minimum these concerns should be carefully considered for the species
identified as most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

In potentially more promising news, our results indicate that the vulnerability of the lorisoids – and
indeed of many of the small-bodied lemurs, e.g. mouse lemurs – to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be
substantially lower. Although the lorisoids as a group are more geographically widespread and (in relative
terms) of lower conservation concern than the lemurs, many remain threatened and face critical
challenges to their survival. Their cryptic, nocturnal habits may make the impact of emerging infectious
diseases especially difficult to monitor in wild populations. Nonetheless, a lower predicted susceptibility
to SARS-CoV-2 is a potentially positive result.

Our results are also likely to be of interest and significance for zoos and captive research facilities around
the world that house lemurs, lorises, and galagos. Given the close contact with humans in such
environments (often indoors), extra precautions may be necessary, especially when interacting with the
likely most at-risk lemurs. These may include many of the measures suggested for those interacting with
great ape and other catarrhine populations (Gilardi et al., 2015; Melin et al., 2020), such as regular testing
for SARS-CoV-2, requiring face masks for human researchers and caretakers, imposing quarantines on all
individuals ahead of contact, and disinfecting clothes and footwear. The risk of COVID-19 to nonhuman
primates has been recently exemplified when members of a captive gorilla group tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 after exposure to an asymptomatic keeper (San Diego Zoo, 2021). Regardless of where

species fall in the continuum of potential risk that we have presented here, we stress that it is prudent to
take all feasible precautions when interacting with any primate.

Over the past year, scientists have mobilized with remarkable speed and effectiveness to address the
COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts on humans, from developing and rolling out new tests, to designing and
trialing vaccine candidates. The pandemic also raises major new challenges for field primatologists and
other biologists, zookeepers, conservationists, and all those interested in the survival and welfare of
primates (Douglas et al., 2020; Olival et al., 2020; Bales, 2020). Conservation efforts have already been
severely impeded by the pandemic. National and global lock-downs have made it difficult or impossible
for conservationists, primatologists, and wildlife patrol teams to enter their field sites. Governments are
preoccupied with efforts to curb the pandemic, and in some cases conservation funding support has been
reduced due to financial difficulties and new priorities. While avoiding all contact with wild primates may
be ideal from a zoonotic disease containment perspective, it is unlikely to be possible in practice, nor in
the overall interest of their conservation. While we hope that our results will serve to inform conservation
efforts, resolving the pressures that have resulted from the pandemic will require input from stakeholders
with complementary ethical, scientific, and socioeconomic perspectives. It is our hope that as a
community, we can rise to the challenge.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Amino acid composition of the ACE2 protein at sites that are critical for interacting with the
SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain across examined strepsirrhine genera, with respect to the human
ACE2 sequence.
Figure 2. Model of human ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD is presented in panel A. Three of
the key ACE2 interfacial residues are highlighted in panel B. The dashed lines indicate predicted
hydrogen bonding interactions. Interactions at three of the critical binding sites (41, 42, and 82) are shown
for humans and other catarrhines (i.e. apes and monkeys in Africa and Asia). Changes in amino acids
diminish these binding interactions. For example, substitution of tyrosine with histidine at site 41 in panel
C decreases the viral-RBD binding affinity by removal of the potential hydrogen bonding interactions
with T500 and N501.
