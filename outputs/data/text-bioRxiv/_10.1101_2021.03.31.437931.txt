Abstract:

Since late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has infected 128
million people worldwide. Although several vaccine candidates have received
emergency use authorization (EUA), there are still a limited number of vaccine
doses available. To increase the number of vaccinated individuals, there are
ongoing discussions about administering partial vaccine doses, but there is still
a paucity of data on how vaccine fractionation affects vaccine-elicited immunity.
We performed studies in mice to understand how the priming dose of a SARS
CoV-2 vaccine affects long-term immunity to SARS CoV-2. We first primed
C57BL/6 mice with an adenovirus-based vaccine encoding SARS CoV-2 spike
protein (Ad5-SARS-2 spike), similar to that used in the CanSino and Sputnik V
vaccines. This prime was administered either at a low dose (LD) of 106 PFU or at a
standard dose (SD) of 109 PFU, followed by a SD boost in all mice four weeks
later. As expected, the LD prime induced lower immune responses relative to the
SD prime. However, the LD prime elicited immune responses that were
qualitatively superior, and upon boosting, mice that were initially primed with a
LD exhibited significantly more potent immune responses. Overall, these data
demonstrate that limiting the priming dose of a SARS CoV-2 vaccine may confer
unexpected benefits. These findings may be useful for improving vaccine
availability and for rational vaccine design.

Introduction

Several vaccines are currently being used in humans to prevent COVID-19. Among
these, adenovirus-based vaccines have shown potent protection against severe
COVID-19. These vaccines are based on adenovirus serotype 5, adenovirus serotype
26, and chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1). However, there is not a sufficient number
of vaccine doses available to immunize the entire world population, which has motivated
discussions about administering partial vaccine doses to increase the number of people
who receive the vaccine. Nevertheless, there is little information on how vaccine
fractionation affects long-term immunity to SARS CoV-2.

Phase I vaccine trials typically involve dose-escalation studies comparing a range of
vaccine doses in groups of people who receive the same dose of the vaccine during the
prime and the boost. However, they do not typically evaluate “intra-group dose
escalation,” in which individuals would first receive a prime with a low dose, and then a
boost with a higher dose. We performed studies in mice to determine the immunological
effect of intra-group vaccine dose escalation. Our data show that limiting the priming
dose of a SARS CoV-2 vaccine may confer an unexpected qualitative benefit to T cell
responses and antibody responses.

Results
Low dose (LD) vaccine prime elicits T cells with high anamnestic capacity.
We first primed C57BL/6 mice intramuscularly with an adenovirus vector expressing
SARS CoV-2 spike protein (Ad5-SARS-2 spike), either at a low dose (LD) (106 PFU) or
a standard dose (SD) (109 PFU). After four weeks, mice were boosted with the standard
dose and CD8 T cell responses were analyzed by MHC tetramer binding assays (Fig.
1A). We tracked a CD8 T cell response against an epitope (VNFNFNGL) that is highly
conserved among bat and SARS-like coronaviruses, including SARS CoV-1, SARS
CoV-2, RatG13, HKU3, WIV1, WIV16, RsSHC014, Rs3367, Shaanxi2011, Rm1/2004,
YN2018B, SC2018, HuB2013, GX2013, and BM48-31/BGR/2008/Yunnan2011, among
other coronaviruses. We will refer to this conserved CD8 T cell response as SARS CoV2 specific response, or Kb VL8 for simplicity purposes, where V represents the first
amino acid, L represents the last amino acid, and 8 represents the number of amino
acids in the sequence.

Initially, priming with a LD resulted in lower SARS CoV-2 specific CD8 T cell responses,
relative to priming with a SD (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with the notion that the
level of adaptive immune responses following adenovirus vaccination is dosedependent (1). However, an unexpected effect was observed after the booster
immunization four weeks after. Mice that were initially primed with a LD exhibited
significantly greater CD8 T cell expansion upon boosting, relative to mice that were

initially primed with the higher SD (Fig. 1B-1C). More robust CD8 T cell recall expansion
in the LD/SD regimen was also observed in tissues (Fig. 1D-1E).

SARS CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells induced by the LD/SD regimen exhibited enhanced
CD107a degranulation and IFNg expression (Fig. 2A-2C). Moreover, there was a pattern
of improved CD4 T cell responses in the LD/SD regimen relative to the SD/SD regimen,
but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 2D). SARS CoV-2-specific CD8 T
cells induced by the LD/SD regimen showed more robust granzyme B and Ki67
expression relative to the SD/SD regimen (Fig. 2E-2G), suggesting enhanced
cytotoxicity and proliferation upon boosting. Collectively, these results demonstrate that
limiting the priming dose elicits SARS CoV-2-specific T cell responses with superior
anamnestic and functional capacity.

Effects of vaccine dose on T cell differentiation.

The data above suggested qualitative differences in T cell responses following a single
shot with either a low or a standard dose of vaccine. It is known that after an initial
antigen encounter, T cells differentiate into distinct subsets, including short-lived effector
cells (Teff), effector memory cells (Tem), and central memory cells (Tcm). Teff and Tem
subsets exhibit rapid cytotoxicity, but are short-lived. On the other hand, the Tcm subset
is long-lived and exhibits enhanced recall capacity (2). To evaluate if the priming dose
affected the differentiation of these T cells subsets, we FACS-sorted SARS CoV-2specific CD8 T cells at week 4 post-vaccination (prime only), and performed single-cell

RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Interestingly, SARS CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells elicited
by a LD and a SD clustered differently, suggesting unique transcriptional signatures
(Fig. 3A). CD8 T cells after a LD prime showed lower transcription of genes associated
with effector function, such as Prdm1, Tbx21, Id2, Ifng, Gzmb, Gzma, Prf1, and genes
associated with terminal differentiation, such as Klrg1 and Zeb2 (Fig. 3B). Overall, the
LD was associated with lower expression of genes associated with terminal effector
differentiation (Fig. 3C)(3). Importantly, CD8 T cells elicited by a LD showed higher
transcription of genes associated with long-lived memory T cells, such as Tcf7, Id3,
Bcl2, Ccr7, Sell (CD62L) and Il7r (CD127) (Fig. 3B). Taken together, although the LD
prime elicited a lower number of CD8 T cells, most of those CD8 T cells exhibited a Tcm
signature with low terminal effector differentiation.

These data suggested that limiting the priming dose has a profound effect on T cell
differentiation, and we then interrogated whether these effects on T cell differentiation
could be due to distinct TCR usage. To answer this question, we performed single-cell T
cell receptor (TCR)-seq on SARS CoV-2 specific CD8 T cells at week 4 post-prime, and
then we compared TCR clonotypes in the two groups. In both LD and SD, TCR usage
and diversity were similar and characterized by an oligoclonal expansion and a major
bias for Vb11 usage (encoded by TRBV16 gene) (62.15% or 80.68%, respectively) (Fig.
4A-4B). Of note, we observed the presence of a dominant public clone TCRa7 TCRb11
(TRAV7-5/TRBV16),

(TCRa7 TCRb11), which will allow one to more rigorously study CD8 T cell responses
across multiple sarbecoviruses in mice. Overall, our scTCR-seq data suggested that
vaccine dose did not significantly alter TCR clonotypes and viral epitope recognition at
the TCR level.

Next, we immunophenotyped SARS CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells at week 4 post-prime to
confirm the gene expression profile results. Consistent with the gene expression
profiling, CD8 T cells generated by a LD prime exhibited more pronounced central
memory markers, such as CD62L and CD127 (Fig. 5A-5D). In addition, CD8 T cells
induced by a LD prime showed higher levels of the CD44 activation marker (Fig. 5E)
and lower levels of the inhibitory PD-1 receptor (Fig. 5F), relative to CD8 T cells induced
after a SD prime. Taken together, our functional data, transcriptomics data, and
phenotypic data show that an initial antigen encounter has profound long-term effects
on T cell differentiation following SARS CoV-2 vaccination.

Pre-existent immunity to adenoviral vectors can negatively affect vaccine-elicited
immunity. We also reasoned that since mice that were primed with a SD harbor higher
levels of virus-specific T cells and antibodies, this may result in more stringent
competition for antigen during a subsequent booster immunization. To rule out these
possibilities, we evaluated recall CD8 T cells in the absence of other pre-existing
responses, by performing adoptive transfers of low numbers of purified SARS CoV-2specific CD8 T cells into naïve hosts. Four weeks after priming mice with a LD or a SD,
we FACS-purified splenic SARS CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells, and transferred these at

equal low numbers (500 cells) into congenically distinct naïve mice. One day after
adoptive transfer, all recipient mice were vaccinated with the SD (109 PFU) of the SARS
CoV-2 vaccine, and secondary CD8 T cell expansion was assessed by flow cytometry
(Fig. 6A). We show that donor CD8 T cells from mice that were primed with a LD
exhibited more robust secondary expansion compared to those primed with a SD (Fig.
6B-6E). These data show that a “gentle” antigenic prime elicits CD8 T cells that are
intrinsically superior on a per-cell basis, and better able to mount a secondary response
upon a booster immunization, irrespective of whether there are pre-existing vector or
transgene-specific immune responses in the host. The adoptive transfer experiment
above with normalized numbers of CD8 T cells was also consistent with our earlier
scRNA-seq data showing that on a per-cell basis, a LD vaccine prime elicited less
terminal differentiation with a superior Tcm differentiation.

LD/SD elicits superior antibody responses relative to SD/SD.

Our analyses so far have been focused on T cell responses, but we also report
profound differences in antibody responses. After a single prime immunization, the LD
elicited antibody responses that were expectedly lower compared to the SD. However,
antibody responses elicited by the LD expanded more robustly upon boosting (Fig. 7A).
The LD/SD regimen exhibited superior germinal center B cell responses upon boosting,
relative to the SD/SD regimen (Fig. 7B-7C). Generation of germinal center (GC) B cells
after SARS CoV-2 vaccination is associated with potent SARS CoV-2 neutralizing
antibody responses (4). Therefore, we performed neutralization assays using SARS

CoV-2 pseudovirus to measure the ability of vaccine-elicited antibodies to block viral
entry. Consistent with the profound increase in GC B cells, the LD/SD regimen elicited a
43-fold improvement in neutralizing antibodies compared to SD/SD (Fig. 7D).

Currently, there are concerns about emerging SARS CoV-2 variants, and their potential
to evade vaccine-elicited immune responses. A critical question is whether the current
vaccines would protect against these variants or different coronaviruses that may
appear in the future. We therefore interrogated whether changing the priming dose of
our SARS CoV-2 vaccine could affect immune cross-reactivity against another
coronavirus. To answer this simple question, we measured antibody responses to a
distinct SARS coronavirus (original SARS CoV-1). Interestingly, the LD/SD regimen
resulted in 5-fold improvement in cross-reactive antibody responses, relative to the
SD/SD regimen (Fig. 7E). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the anamnestic
potential of antibody responses is also enhanced when the initial vaccine dose is
reduced. In conclusion, we show that reducing the prime dose of an Ad5-based SARS
CoV-2 vaccine confers an unprecedented advantage to T cell responses and antibody
responses.

Discussion:

vaccine,

AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, CanSino vaccine, and the Sputnik V vaccine. These
vaccines have already been administered to millions of people, and have shown potent
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy against severe SARS CoV-2 infection. The
CanSino and Sputnik V vaccines specifically utilize Ad5, which is the same vector
platform used in our studies. Ad5 is among the most well-studied vaccine vectors, due
in part to its extraordinary immunogenicity (5, 6). Although SARS CoV-2 vaccines
prevent severe disease and death, they do not always confer sterilizing immunity,
warranting further optimization of current vaccine regimens. Another issue is that there
is still an insufficient number of vaccine doses available to immunize the entire
population, motivating health authorities to administer half doses of vaccines in order to
double the number of vaccinated people, but there is little knowledge of how vaccine
fractionation could affect vaccine-elicited immunity.

Here, we show that fractionating the priming dose of an adenovirus-based SARS CoV-2
vaccine confers an unexpected immunological benefit. However, a possible trade-off of
fractionating the priming dose is that it may initially result in lower immune responses,
which may render the host transiently more susceptible to infection. Notwithstanding
this potential concern, It is unclear what is the minimum level of immune responses
required to protect against severe COVID-19, but a recent study demonstrated that

even a low dose single-shot of an adenovirus-based SARS CoV-2 vaccine is sufficient
to confer protection against severe disease in primates (7). Similarly, a single dose of a
DNA-based SARS CoV-2 vaccine, which is ~1000-fold less immunogenic than a LD
single-shot of our Ad5-based vaccine, was able to protect macaques from a SARS CoV2 challenge (8). These prior data suggest low levels of immune responses are sufficient
to protect against severe COVID-19, which can explain the extraordinary success of
multiple experimental SARS CoV-2 vaccines in the last year.

There are historical examples of vaccine dose fractionation, also known as dosesparing, as a way to allow more people to get vaccinated. For instance, prior studies
have shown that administering a fifth of the recommended dose of the yellow fever virus
vaccine results in comparable immune responses relative to the recommended dose
(9). Similar results have been reported for influenza, measles, polio and typhoid
vaccines (10-12), which has led to discussions of whether SARS CoV-2 vaccine doses
should be fractionated to allow more people to get vaccinated. A rationale for
fractionating SARS CoV-2 vaccines is that it may result in wider herd immunity even if
vaccine efficacy is only partial, and that this could have a more striking effect in blocking
transmission at the population level. However, an argument against vaccine
fractionation is that it has not been rigorously tested with SARS CoV-2 vaccines.

Conceptually, our findings are contrary to conventional wisdom, because we show that
when it comes to the immune system, sometimes “less is more.” Antigen is the first
signal required for the activation of the adaptive immune system. However, the amount

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.31.437931; this version posted April 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

of antigen during a vaccine prime is not always proportional to the long-term magnitude
and quality of the immune response, especially if the immune response is subsequently
boosted. A prior study by Ahmed and colleagues in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV) system showed that the duration of initial antigenic stimulation impacts T
cell differentiation. This earlier study showed that CD8 T cells primed at the early stage
of the infection preferentially differentiate into Tem, whereas CD8 T cells primed during
the end of the infection preferentially differentiate into Tcm. Furthermore, we have
previously shown that protracted acute infections favor Tem differentiation (13).
Altogether, these prior reports suggest that a protracted antigen stimulation after a
prime imprints a Tem phenotype, whereas a shortened antigen stimulation after a prime
imprints a Tcm phenotype. Similar to this notion, we show that a LD prime favors Tcm
differentiation, characterized by high expression of CD127, the IL-7 receptor a chain,
which allows the T cell to survive long-term. Tcm CD8 T cells also exhibit enhanced
recall capacity, which can explain the improved secondary expansion that was observed
in our LD/SD regimen.

The LD/SD regimen also induced superior antibody responses compared to the SD/SD
regimen, suggesting that a “gentle” antigen prime also generates memory B cell
responses with significantly superior anamnestic capacity. Strikingly, the LD/SD
regimen generated a 43-fold improved neutralizing response, compared to the SD/SD
regimen. Thus, the effect of a LD prime on antibody responses is substantially more
striking compared to its effect on T cell responses. Most of our mechanistic studies
involve CD8 T cells, and our future studies will be aimed at understanding how a LD

prime affects memory B cell differentiation. In vitro antibody neutralization is directly
correlated with in vivo protection against SARS CoV-2 challenges (8), but we did not
perform in vivo SARS CoV-2 challenges to compare immune protection, because in our
pilot studies in k18-ACE2 mice, even a single-shot of our Ad5-SARS-2 spike vaccine
provided near sterilizing protection; most animals that received a single shot of our Ad5SARS-2 spike vaccine and were then challenged with SARS CoV-2 showed RNA levels
that were undetectable or near the limit of detection. It is possible that our LD/SD
regimen may confer a protective advantage relative to the SD/SD regimen at later times
post-vaccination when vaccine-elicited responses wane. Therefore, in the long-term, a
LD/SD regimen may potentially obviate the need for a third boost. The LD/SD regimen
may also be useful to improve vaccine efficacy in individuals who develop suboptimal
immune responses to vaccines, and who may benefit from having a higher level of
immune responses.

There are growing concerns about new SARS CoV-2 variants and their ability to evade
immune responses elicited by vaccination or natural infection. There are also concerns
about re-emerging coronaviruses, such as SARS CoV-1, as well as novel coronaviruses
that may enter the human population in the future, and an important question is whether
the current vaccines would protect against future coronavirus pandemics. We
investigated this issue of “immune coverage” by analyzing cross-reactive antibody
responses (SARS CoV-1-specific), and we show that the LD/SD regimen resulted in
improved cross-reactive antibody responses compared to SD/SD. Note also that the
CD8 T cell response that we measured in these studies was specific for a highly

conserved epitope (VNFNFNGL) that is present across multiple coronaviruses. There
have been reports of re-infections caused by SARS CoV-2 variants, such as the B1.1.7
and B.1.351 variants, which are also thought to evade antibody responses elicited by
vaccination (14). Interestingly, a study of recovered COVID-19 patients showed that
virus-specific CD8 T cells are still able to recognize these variants, highlighting a critical
role for CD8 T cells in providing broad protection against emerging variants (15).
Altogether, the LD/SD regimen may be particularly effective in the context of universal
coronavirus vaccines, because this regimen induces potent levels of cross-reactive
immune responses.

The extent to which our results generalize to humans has not been determined, but a
recent clinical trial with an adenovirus-based SARS CoV-2 vaccine (ChAdOx1, nCoV19), in which the priming dose was accidentally reduced to half, reported superior
efficacy relative to standard dose (90% efficacy for LD/SD, versus 62% efficacy for
SD/SD) (16). However, in those studies it was unclear whether the improvement in the
LD/SD group was due to prolonging the prime-boost interval or due to the priming dose
itself. Our results bring more clarity to this confounding issue, as we show that the
priming dose alone can have a substantial qualitative effect on immune responses.
Historically, phase 1 vaccine trials compare a range of vaccine doses among different
groups of individuals. However, they do not typically analyze the effect of doseescalation within the same individual. The data presented here make a case for
exploring intra-group vaccine dose escalation in future clinical trials. In summary, our
results warrant a re-evaluation of current vaccine trial design, and most importantly,

consideration during times of vaccine scarcity.

Materials and Methods
Mice and vaccinations:
6-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used. Mice were purchased from Jackson
laboratories (approximately half males and half females). Mice were immunized
intramuscularly (50 µL per quadriceps) with an Ad5 vector expressing SARS CoV-2
spike protein (Ad5-SARS-2 spike) diluted in sterile PBS. Mice were housed at the
Northwestern University Center for Comparative Medicine (CCM) in downtown Chicago.
All mouse experiments were performed with approval of the Northwestern University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Reagents, flow cytometry and equipment:
Single cell suspensions were obtained from PBMCs and various tissues as described
previously (17). Dead cells were gated out using Live/Dead fixable dead cell stain
(Invitrogen). SARS CoV-2 spike peptide pools used for intracellular cytokine staining
(ICS) and these were obtained from BEI Resources. Biotinilated MHC class I monomers
(Kb VL8, sequence VNFNFNGL) were obtained from the NIH tetramer facility at Emory
University. The VNFNFNGL epitope is highly conserved among many multiple
coronaviruses, representing a cross-reactive CD8 T cell response. It is located in
position 539-546 of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, or position 525-532 of the SARS
CoV-1 spike protein. Cells were stained with fluorescently-labeled antibodies against
CD8α (53-6.7 on PerCP-Cy5.5), CD44 (IM7 on Pacific Blue), TNFα (MP6-XT22 on PECy7), IL-2 (JES6-5H4 on PE), IFNγ (XMG1.2 on APC), peanut agglutinin or PNA
(conjugated to fluorescein), Fas (Jo2 on PE), IgD (11-26 on Pacific Blue), IgM (RMM-1

on PECy7), B220 (RA3-6B2 on PerCP-Cy5.5), and CD3 (145-2c11 on FITC).
Fluorescently-labeled antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen, except for antiCD44 (which was from Biolegend). Flow cytometry samples were acquired with a
Becton Dickinson Canto II or an LSRII and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar).

Homologous (SARS CoV-2) and heterologous (SARS CoV-1) virus-specific ELISA:
Binding antibody titers were measured using ELISA as described previously (18, 19),
but using spike protein instead of viral lysates. In brief, 96-well flat bottom plates
MaxiSorp (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 0.1μg/well of the respective spike
protein, for 48 hr at 4ºC. Plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20. Blocking
was performed for 4 hr at room temperature with 200 μL of PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 +
bovine serum albumin. 6μL of sera were added to 144 μL of blocking solution in first
column of plate, 1:3 serial dilutions were performed until row 12 for each sample and
plates were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed three
times followed by addition of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated
(Southern Biotech) diluted in blocking solution (1:5000), at 100 μL/well and incubated
for 90 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed three times and 100 μL /well
of Sure Blue substrate (Sera Care) was added for approximately 8 minutes. Reaction
was stopped using 100 μL/well of KPL TMB stop solution (Sera Care). Absorbance was
measured at 450 nm using a Spectramax Plus 384 (Molecular Devices). SARS CoV-2
spike protein was made at the Northwestern Recombinant Protein Production Core by

Glycoprotein Gene (soluble, stabilized), NR-52394. SARS CoV-1 spike protein was
obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-CoV Spike (S) Protein deltaTM,
Recombinant from Baculovirus, NR-722.

Pseudovirus neutralization assays:
A SARS CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped lentivirus kit was obtained through BEI Resources,
NIAID, NIH (SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Wuhan-Hu-1 Spike-Pseudotyped Lentiviral
Kit V2, NR-53816). We used Human Embryonic Kidney Cells (HEK-293T) expressing
Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, also known as HEK-293T-hACE2, which are
susceptible to SARS CoV-2. This cell line was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID,
NIH NR-52511. Serial dilutions of sera were incubated with the SARS CoV-2 Spike
pseudotyped lentivirus, following a protocol by Balazs and Bloom (20). Cells were lysed
using luciferase cell culture lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase reaction was performed
using 30 μL of cell lysis (Promega). The reaction was added to 96-well black optiplates
(Perkin Elmer). Luminescence was measured using Perkin Elmer Victor3 luminometer.

Ad5-SARS-2 spike vaccine:
This non-replicating Ad5 vector is E1/E3 deleted and expresses the SARS CoV-2 spike
protein (strain 2019-nCoV-WIV04) within the putative E1 site. This vector contains a
CMV (Cytomegalovirus) promoter driving the expression of SARS-CoV-2-Spike protein.
These vaccines were propagated on trans-complementing HEK293 cells (ATCC),

purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, titrated, and then frozen at
−80 °C.

Single cell RNA-Seq Data Acquisition and Analysis:
C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a LD (106 PFU) or a SD (109 PFU) of Ad5-SARS-2
spike, and at day 28, splenic CD8 T cells were MACS-sorted with a MACS negative
selection kit (STEMCELL). Purified CD8 T cells were stained with Kb VL8 tetramer, live
dead stain, and flow cytometry antibodies for CD8 and CD44 to gate on activated CD8
T cells. Live, CD8+, CD44+, Kb VL8+ cells were FACS-sorted to ~99% purity on a
FACS Aria cytometer (BD Biosciences) and delivered to the Northwestern University
NUSeq core for scRNA-seq using Chromium NextGem 5’ v2 kit (10X Genomics). After
the library was sequenced, the output file in BCL format was converted to fastq files and
aligned to mouse genome in order to generate a matrix file using the Cell Ranger
pipeline (10X Genomics). These upstream QC steps were performed by Drs. Ching
Man Wai and Matthew Schipma at the Northwestern University NUSeq core. Further
analyses were performed in R using the Seurat package v4.0 (PMID: 30638736), as
previously described (21). Terminal effector gene signatures were derived using the
edgeR package (22), comparing effector memory to terminal effector CD8 T cells (3).
Clusters representing less than 4% of each population were excluded from downstream
analyses. TCR analyses was performed using the scRepertoire package (23). Only cells
expressing both TCRa and TCRb chains were selected. For cells with more than 2 TCR
chains, only the top 2 expressed chains were used.
