Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has caused over 5,000,000
cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with significant fatality rate.1-3 Due to the urgency of
this global pandemic, numerous therapeutic and vaccine trials have begun without customary
safety and efficacy studies. 4 Laboratory mice have been the stalwart of these types of studies;
however, they do not support infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the inability of its spike (S)
protein to engage the mouse ortholog of its human entry receptor angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (hACE2). While hACE2 transgenic mice support infection and pathogenesis,5 these
mice are currently limited in availability and are restricted to a single genetic background. Here
we report the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno associated virus
(AAV)-mediated expression of hACE2. These mice support viral replication and antibody
production and exhibit pathologic findings found in COVID-19 patients as well as non-human
primate models. Moreover, we show that type I interferons are unable to control SARS-CoV2
replication and drive pathologic responses. Thus, the hACE2-AAV mouse model enables rapid
deployment for in-depth analysis following robust SARS-CoV-2 infection with authentic patientderived virus in mice of diverse genetic backgrounds. This represents a much-needed platform
for rapidly testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.

To overcome the limitation that mouse ACE2 does not support SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and
infection6,7, we developed a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis by
delivering human ACE2 (hACE2) into the respiratory tract of C57BL/6J (B6J) mice via adenoassociated virus (AAV9) (Fig.1a). Control (AAV-GFP or mock) and AAV-hACE2 mice were
intranasally infected with 1x106 PFU SARS-CoV-2 (passage 2 of isolate USA-WA1/2020). Mice
were sacrificed at 2, 4, 7, and 14 days post infection (DPI). During the 14-day time course, mice
were monitored daily for weight loss. None developed significant weight changes or died.
Compared to control, AAV-hACE2 mice supported productive infection indicated by >200-fold
increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig.1b) as well as the presence of infectious virus as indicated
by plaque assay (Fig.1c).
We next performed histopathologic examination of lung sections from 2- and 4-days post
infection (DPI). We found mild diffuse peribronchial infiltrates in AAV-hACE2 mice, which was
minimal in control mice (Fig.1e,f). Immunofluorescence staining (Fig.1d) of lung sections
revealed diffuse infection (SARS-CoV-2 N protein/Red) within alveolar epithelia
(EpCAM/Green). Similar to findings in COVID-19 patients8, we found an expansion of
pulmonary infiltrating myeloid derived inflammatory cells characterized by Ly6Chi monocytes
and inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (CD64+CD11c-CD11b+Ly6C+) (Fig 1g;
Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Additionally, we observed relative increases of activated lymphoid
cells in lung tissue, including increased percentages of CD69+(recent activation) and
CD44+(recent antigen exposure) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig 1g; Extended Data Fig. 1b,c).
Lastly, the population of activated (CD69+) NK cells also expanded during early infection.
The role of adaptive immunity and specifically antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is particularly
important in the development of safe and effective vaccines. To assess the capacity for B6J
AAV-hACE2 mice to mount an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 challenge, we quantified antispike protein IgG titers by ELISA9,10. We found that while control infected mice did not develop
anti-spike antibodies, AAV-hACE2 B6/J mice mounted a significant antibody response between
4- and 7- DPI, which continued to increase at 14 DPI (Fig. 1h). Next, to assess the
neutralization potential of these antibodies, we performed plaque reduction neutralization assay
(PRNT) using SARS-CoV-2, and found PRNT75 at a serum dilution of 1:1024 as early as 7 DPI
(Fig 1i).

Interferon stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines are acutely upregulated during
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In a recent study, Blanco-Melo et. al. showed cytokine signatures that are out of proportion to
the interferon response in autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients, infected ferrets, and
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in culture11. However, others have reported elevated interferon
signatures in the lungs of COVID-19 patients12. To assess both the cytokine and interferon
response to SARS-CoV-2 infected AAV-hACE2 mice, we performed RNA sequencing from
infected lung at 2 DPI. In contrast to the control infected mice, AAV-hACE2 mice developed
clear signatures of cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In fact, the majority of the
differentially expressed upregulated genes were either ISGs or cytokines (Fig. 2a). Interestingly,
neither type I, nor type II, nor type III interferons seemed to be upregulated. Using the
Interferome database (http://www.interferome.org/), we mapped the top upregulated genes to
their transcriptional regulation by either type I, II, or III IFNs (Fig. 2b). We found that while most
of the genes shared regulation by type I and type II (and some by all 3 IFNs), a distinct subset of
45 genes that were specific to type I interferon signaling was elevated in the infected lung. We
next performed gene ontology analysis of the top upregulated genes, which revealed
enrichment of gene clusters in virus-host interaction, immune response, as well as immune cell
recruitment and activation (Fig. 2c), consistent with the proinflammatory immune cell infiltrates
seen in patients. To analyze the concordance between our model and the recently published
patient lung autopsy gene expression from Blanco-Melo et.al., we found that 73% of our shared
upregulated genes were ISGs (Fig 2d, e). These results indicated that our mouse model largely
recapitulated the transcriptome changes observed in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.

Type I interferon signaling is required for recruitment of proinflammatory cells into the
lungs and ISG expression, but not for viral clearance.
To further investigate the role of type I interferon signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
transduced interferon alpha receptor deficient B6/J mice (IFNAR-/-) and interferon regulatory
transcription factor 3/7 double knockout B6/J mice (IRF3/7-/-) two key transcription factors
needed to induce IFNs and ISGs 13, with AAV-hACE2 and infected them intranasally with 1x106
PFU SARS-CoV-2. We found modest elevations (~10 fold) in viral RNA of IFNAR-/- but not

IRF3/7-/- relative to WT B6/J AAV-hACE2 at 2 DPI, though these differences were lost at later
time points during infection (Fig. 3a). Viral replication was only slightly enhanced in IFNAR-/- or
IRF3/7-/- mice over wild type mice, similar to what has been previously been shown in SARSCoV-114. In contrast, we found a loss of recruitment of Ly6Chi monocytes and monocyte-derived
macrophages in mice deficient in IFNAR or IRF3/7 (Fig. 3d,e). Additionally, we found reduced
activation of CD4+, CD8+, or NK cells in IRF3/7-/- infected mice, and a complete loss of activation
of these cell populations in IFNAR-/- infected mice (Fig. 3f-h). In contrast, we observed robust
recruitment of neutrophils in the infected IFNAR-/- mice (Fig. 3i). This may reflect the loss of IFNmediated regulation of inflammasomes leading to neutrophil recruitment 15-17. These results
were consistent with previous reports of pulmonary type I interferon signaling representing a
major driver of both recruitment and activation of proinflammatory immune cells in viral
infections including SARS-CoV-114 and other respiratory viral infections18. RNA sequencing at 2
DPI from the lungs of infected WT, IFNAR-/-, and IRF3/7-/- mice reveal markedly elevated ISGs
and cytokines profile. Heat map analysis of the top 100 upregulated genes showed significant
elevation of antiviral ISGs (Rsad2, IRF7, OASL, Ifit, STAT2, MX2) as well as monocyte
recruiting chemokines (Cxcl10, Ccl7, and Ccl2), which were not upregulated in either IFNAR-/- or
IRF3/7-/- infected mice (Fig. 3c).
Discussion
In this study, we describe the development of a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 using AAVhACE2 delivery to the mouse respiratory tract. This model develops productive SARS-CoV-2
infection as well as inflammatory pulmonary infiltrates that are characteristic of COVID-19 in
humans. We found an acute inflammatory immune response characterized by infiltrating
monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, as well as activated T and NK cells. We also found
gene signatures of acute ISG response which clusters most closely with type I interferon
response. In addition to the acute inflammatory response, these mice develop rapid SARS-CoV2 S-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies between 4- and 7- DPI. While none of the mice
exhibited infection-related mortality, this may reflect the immune status of the challenged mice,
which were 6-12 weeks old healthy adult mice. Future studies in aged, immunocompromised,
and/or obese mice may elicit more dramatic phenotypes, similar to the effect of these
comorbidities in human COVID-19 disease.
To better understand the role of type I interferon signaling we infected both IFNAR-/- and IRF3/7/-

and showed that despite similar kinetics of viral clearance, there was significant blunting of

ISG response, suggesting that viral replication is resistant to interferon signaling as was
previously show with SARS-CoV-114 and has been suggested in SARS-CoV-2 given its vast
array of interferon antagonists19. While endogenous type I interferon signaling seems to have
little effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, it clearly orchestrates a proinflammatory immune
response and may cause immunopathology in patients. Type I interferon signaling is important
in protecting against viral infections20. Despite the use of type I interferon in the treatment of
both MERS and SARS-CoV-1, its endogenous role is less clear with reports of protective effects
for MERS20 and pathogenic effects for SARS-CoV-114. Notably, overactive or unregulated
interferon signaling causes pathology in influenza21,22, congenital Zika23, and SARS-CoV-114,24
infection. The role of type I interferon signaling in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is critically
important to understanding the protection provided by both the innate and adaptive arms of the
immune system and to elucidate any pathogenic effects. These data are especially concerning
given current use of type I interferon as a therapeutic for the treatment of COVID-19. Our results
indicate a pathological role of type I IFN in COVID-19 respiratory inflammation.
Here we present clear evidence of both the lack of antiviral activity as well as the potential
harms of endogenous type I interferon responses in COVID-19 patients. While a similar
technique was previously used to develop the first MERS mouse infection system25, to our
knowledge this is the first report that vector based hACE2 delivery to the mouse respiratory tract
is sufficient to enable robust SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the preparation of this manuscript,
two publications5,26 reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis in different transgenic
hACE2 expressing mice. Additionally, infectious models in both hamsters27, ferrets11 and nonhuman primates28 have also been reported. These models are valuable and have provided
much-needed tools for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease. The hACE2-AAV mouse model
described here offers a broadly-available, highly adaptable animal model to understand critical
aspects of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, replication, pathogenesis, with authentic patient derived
virus. This model provides a vital platform for testing prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to
combat COVID-19.

To generate SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks, Huh7.5 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 isolate
USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources #NR-52281) to generate a P1 stock. To generate a working
VeroE6, cells were infected at an MOI 0.01 for four days to generate a working stock.
Supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (450g x 5min) and filtered through a 0.45 micron
filter. To concentrate virus, one volume of cold (4 °C) 4x PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution
(40% (w/v) PEG-8000 and 1.2M NaCl) was added to three volumes of virus-containing
supernatant. The solution was mixed by inverting the tubes several times and then incubated at
4 °C overnight. The precipitated virus was harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 60
minutes at 4 °C. The pelleted virus was then resuspended in PBS then aliquoted for storage at 80°C. Virus titer was determined by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells.
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mice were anesthetized using 30% v/v Isoflurane diluted in propylene
glycol. Using a pipette, 50μL of SARS-CoV-2 (3x107 PFU/ml) was delivered intranasally.
Viral RNA analysis. At indicated time points mice were euthanized in 100% Isoflurane. ~33%
of total lung was placed in a bead homogenizer tube with 1ml of PBS+2%FBS. After
homogenization 250ul of this mixture was placed in 750ul Trizol LS (Invitrogen), and RNA was
extracted with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer protocol. To quantify SARS-CoV-2
RNA levels, we used the Luna Universal Probe Onestep RT-qPCR kit (New England Biolabs)
with 1 ug of RNA, using the US CDC real-time RT-PCR primer/probe sets for 2019-nCoV_N1.
Viral titer. Lung homogenates were cleared of debris by centrifugation (3900g for 10 minutes).
Infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells in MEM
supplemented NaHCO3, 4% FBS 0.6% Avicel RC-581. Plaques were resolved at 48hrs post
infection by fixing in 10% formaldehyde for 1 hour followed by staining for 1 hour in 0.5% crystal
violet in 20% ethanol. Plates were rinsed in water to visualize plaques.
PRNT assay. Serum samples were heat-inactivated by incubation at 56 ℃ for 30 min before
use. Mouse plasma was serially 4-fold diluted from 1:4 to 1:4096, and then an equal volume of
SARS-CoV-2 virus was added (~30PFU) and incubated at 37 ℃ for 30minutes. After incubation,
100 ul mixtures were inoculated onto monolayer Vero E6 cells in a 12-well plate for 1 hour. Cells
were overlayed with MEM supplemented NaHCO3, 4% FBS 0.6% Avicel mixture. Plaques were
resolved at 48hrs post infection by fixing in 10% formaldehyde for 1 hour followed by staining for
1 hour in 0.5% crystal violet.

Immunofluorescence microscopy. Tissue was collected and fixed in 4% PFA overnight.
Samples were then dehydrated in a 30% sucrose solution. OCT-embedded 10-mm cryostat
sections were blocked in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer with 0.3% Triton and 1% FBS before staining.
Slides were stained for EpCAM (G8.8, Biolegend) with fluorochrome-labeled primary antibody.
The primary antibodies rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (GeneTex) and rabbit anti-ACE2
(Abcam) or rabbit IgG isotype control were used and detected with secondary antibodies donkey
anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor Plus 488/555 (Invitrogen). Slides were stained with DAPI (Sigma) and
mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Thermo fisher). All slides were analyzed by
fluorescence microscopy (BX51; Olympus) with 10x lens. Imaging data were analyzed with Imaris
7.2 (Bitplane).
Immunohistochemistry. Yale pathology kindly provided assistance with embedding, sectioning
and H&E staining of lung tissue. A pulmonary pathologist reviewed the slides blinded and
identified immune cell infiltration and other related pathologies.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ELISAs were performed as previously described9. In
short, Triton X-100 and RNase A were added to serum samples at final concentrations of 0.5%
and 0.5mg/ml respectively and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 3 hours before use to
reduce risk from any potential virus in serum. 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific
#442404) were coated with 50 μl/well of recombinant SARS Cov-2 S1 protein
(ACROBiosystems #S1N-C52H3-100ug) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in PBS and were
incubated overnight at 4 °C. The coating buffer was removed, and plates were incubated for 1h
at RT with 200μl of blocking solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, 3% milk powder). Serum was
diluted 1:50 in dilution solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, 1% milk powder) and 100μl of diluted
serum was added for two hours at RT. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T (PBS with
0.1% Tween-20) and 50μl of mouse IgG-specific secondary antibody (BioLegend #405306,
1:10,000) diluted in dilution solution added to each well. After 1h of incubation at RT, plates
were washed three times with PBS-T. Plates were developed with 100μl of TMB Substrate
Reagent Set (BD Biosciences #555214) and the reaction was stopped after 15 min by the
addition of 2 N sulfuric acid. Plates were then read at a wavelength of 450 nm and 570nm.
Isolation of mononuclear cells and flow cytometry. Tissue was harvested and incubated in a
digestion cocktail containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase A (Roche) and 30 μg ml−1 DNase I

(Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI at 37 °C for 45 min. Tissue was then filtered through a 70 μm filter.
Cells were treated with ACK buffer, and resuspended in PBS with 1% BSA. At this point cells
were counted using an automated cell counter (Thermo fisher). Mononuclear cells were
incubated on ice with Fc block and Aqua cell viability dye for 20 minutes. After washing, primary
antibody staining was performed on ice for thirty minutes. After washing with PBS, cells were
fixed using 4% PFA . Cell population data were acquired on an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer and
analyzed using FlowJo. Software (10.5.3, Tree Star)
RNA-seq. Libraries were made with the kind help of Yale Center for Genomic Analysis (YCGA).
Briefly, libraries were prepared with an Illumina rRNA depletion kit and sequenced on a
NovaSeq. RNA-seq data was aligned using STAR (STAR/2.5.3a-foss-2016b, mm10 assembly)
with parameters: --runThreadN 20 --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --limitBAMsortRAM

Figure 1 AAV-hACE2 transduction allows for productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. a,
Schematic of experimental plans. C57BL/6J mice were transduced intratracheally with an adenoassociated vector coding for hACE2 (AAV-hACE2) or control (AAV-GFP or PBS) and infected with
SARS-CoV-2 two weeks after. Lung and blood samples were collected at days 2, 4, 7, and 14
days for analysis. b, Viral RNA from lung homogenates were measured using qPCR against
SARS-CoV-2 N (CDC N1 primers). c, Viral titer from lung homogenates were performed by plaque
assay on VeroE6 cells. d, Frozen lung tissue was stained for SARS-CoV-2 N protein (red) and
epithelial cells (EpCAM, green). e, Fixed lung tissue was paraffin embedded and stained with
H&E. f, Images from e were scored by a pulmonary pathologist for perivenular score. g, At two
days post infection, single cell suspensions of lung were analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are
shown as frequency of CD45+ cells (monocyte-derived macrophages, Ly6Chi monocytes, and
neutrophils), frequency of parent cells (CD44+CD69+ CD4+ T cells, CD44+CD69+ CD8+ T cells,
and CD69+ NK cells), or mean fluorescence intensity of CD64 (Ly6Chi monocytes). h, Serum
antibodies were measured against spike protein using an ELISA. i, Day 7 and 14 sera from h was
used to perform a plaque reduction neutralization assay on VeroE6 cells incubated with SARSCoV-2.

Figure 2 AAV-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 show similar interferon signatures as
COVID19 patients. a, Volcano plot showing differential expression of genes from whole lungs of
mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 with and without AAV-hACE2 at day two post infection. Gray
indicates significantly differentially upregulated genes, and blue indicates subsets of genes that are
known ISGs. b, Significantly upregulated genes were put into Interferome (www.interferome.org) to
identify how many genes are stimulated by type I, type II, or type III interferons. Subset of
differentially expressed genes in a that were significantly upregulated in lungs of COVID19 patients
(from Blanco-Melo et al 2020)., d, Upregulated gene list from human samples (Blanco-melo et. al.
2020) was graphed (left panel) and used to perform hierarchical clustering for differentially
expressed genes from lungs of AAV-hACE2 SARS-CoV-2 infected mice (blue, mouse ISGs; gray,
other genes)., e, Go Enrichment Analysis was performed on significantly upregulated genes to
identify enriched cellular processes.
