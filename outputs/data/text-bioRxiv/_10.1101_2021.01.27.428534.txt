Abstract

26
27

Patients who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infections produce antibodies and antigen-

28

specific T cells against multiple viral proteins. Here, an unbiased interrogation of the anti-

29

viral memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients has been performed by generating

30

large, stable hybridoma libraries and screening thousands of monoclonal antibodies to

31

identify specific, high-affinity immunoglobulins (Igs) directed at distinct viral components.

32

As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a

33

majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific

34

antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the

35

six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble

36

form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-

37

Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more

38

than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including

39

structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading

40

frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having

41

variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a

42

diversity of VL and VH gene usage. These findings demonstrated that an unbiased,

43

function-based approach towards interrogating the COVID-19 patient memory B cell

44

response may have distinct advantages relative to genomics-based approaches when

45

identifying highly effective anti-viral antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

49
50

As the one-year mark approaches since its emergence in Wuhan, China in late 2019 [1],

51

the prolonged spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

52

CoV-2) virus has resulted in one of the most devastating global health challenges of the

53

last century [2–4]. With greater than 45 million confirmed cases and nearly 1.2 million

54

deaths world-wide (WHO, as of November 2020 [5]), the virus continues to pose an

55

extraordinary challenge to the scientific community, consequently becoming an

56

unprecedented socio-economic disaster and burdening healthcare systems around the

57

world. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a myriad pathologies [6] collectively referred

58

to as COVID-19 [3]. While a majority of individuals who become infected with the virus

59

are capable of generating a productive anti-viral response, for many their anti-viral

60

humoral response will not be sufficient to shield them from a potentially deadly infection.

61

Therefore, as the global community braces for the next spike in infection and mortality

62

rates, the urgency to develop effective therapeutics recapitulating the productive anti-viral

63

response to combat the swelling health crisis has never been greater.

64
65

SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA contains a large viral replicase gene, genes encoding non-

66

structural proteins at its 5’ end, and a region encoding four major structural and multiple

67

accessory proteins at the 3’ end. Structural proteins include Spike or Surface glycoprotein

68

(S), Membrane protein (M), Envelope protein (E) and Nucleocapsid protein (N) [7]. The

69

membrane surface glycoprotein S consists of two subunits, S1 and S2, that mediate viral

3

70

binding to the host receptor ACE2 and fusion with the host cell membrane, respectively.

71

The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with

72

ACE2 and is a target of multiple neutralizing antibodies currently in clinical trials [8,9].

73

Genetic analyses of immune effector cells from convalescent patients who had effectively

74

cleared the SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed that these individuals often had robust T and B

75

cell responses to multiple other viral antigens beyond S protein [10–14], suggesting that

76

the recognition of multiple antigens beyond the S protein may be important for viral

77

clearance and the efficient resolution of infection. Included among the targets of the

78

adaptive immune response were N and M proteins, as well as proteins encoded by the

79

viral open reading frame (ORF). As such, a multi-targeted mixture of high-affinity anti-

80

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, more reflective of the broad humoral response seen in

81

high-titer, mild to moderate COVID-19 convalescent patients, may be a more effective

82

therapeutic strategy than using S-specific antibodies alone.

83

This report describes studies to elucidate the memory B cell antibody response in

84

convalescent patients, using a method that enables the generation of large, stable

85

hybridoma libraries from primary human B cells. This approach was previously used to

86

identify a panel of monoclonal antibodies from convalescent patients infected with natural

87

polio virus (PV), oral PV-vaccinated and inactivated PV-boosted healthy subjects [15–

88

17], and, most recently, an anti-amyloid antibody with the anti-biofilm activity [18] from a

89

hybridoma library generated with memory B cells from an Alzheimer’s Disease patient

90

[19]. In the current report, eleven hybridoma libraries were generated from the memory B

91

cells of six COVID-19 patients. These libraries were comprised of more than 150 distinct

92

monoclonal antibodies that were selected on the basis of their binding to multiple SARS-

93

CoV-2 proteins in both cell-based and target-based screens. Characterization of these

94

antibodies revealed broad responses to diverse viral antigens. Fewer than half of the

95

antibodies were directed at S protein, while the remainder were directed at other viral

96

proteins including N and ORF-encoded proteins. Even though the antibodies were

97

directed at highly diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens, they were generally characterized as

98

having variable levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and a diversity of VL and VH gene

99

usage. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were successfully confirmed in a

100

pseudovirus neutralization assay. These results indicate that an unbiased interrogation

101

of COVID-19 patient B cell repertoires is an effective approach to identifying specific anti-

102

viral antibodies and antibody mixtures with the desired binding and functional properties.

103

Antibodies identified and characterized in this manner could be recombinantly produced

104

to yield therapeutic or prophylactic products to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The

105

rapidity with which antibodies from convalescent patients can be identified and

106

characterized suggests that this platform could be a useful component of a rapid response

107

to future pandemics.

116

convalescent patients who demonstrated a high (2880) antibody titer to N and/or S

117

proteins. More than 17,000 hybridomas were generated from the memory B cells of six

118

patients (Table 1), and the naturally occurring human antibodies (IgM, IgG, and IgA

119

isotypes) secreted by those hybridomas were screened for reactivity against a panel of

120

SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Antibody screening assays were developed for three structural

121

proteins (S, N, M) and a panel of accessory ORF proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). The

122

screening assays included a rapid and sensitive homogeneous time resolved

123

fluorescence (hTRF) assay that used soluble recombinant viral proteins (Figure 1), as

124

well as a selective, cell-based flow cytometry assay that allowed probing of antibodies to

125

126

127

selective and saturable binding in both assays. The dynamic ranges varied among the

128

specific targets and between assays (Figure 1 and Figure 2) within a 10 pM-100 nM

129

window. Viral protein expression in the cell-based assay was additionally confirmed by

130

Western blot. For cell-based assays, using commercially available controls, the

163

Consistent with previous reports [12,14], S protein was identified as the major antigen for

164

antibody responses in these patients. As shown in Figure 3A, S represented the single

165

most frequently identified target: 76 (44%) of the mono-specific antibodies bound

166

selectively to S protein. As expected, the epitopes for anti-Spike antibodies were

167

distributed across the RBD, non-RBD S1, and non-S1 regions of the Spike protein (Figure

168

3B). However, consistent with the hypothesis that patients would be mounting antibody

169

responses to a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, more than half (56%) of identified

170

antibodies bound to non-Spike viral antigens (Figure 3). ORF8 - (28 antibodies, 17%) and

171

N - (23 antibodies, 14%) specific antibodies represented the second and third most-

172

frequently identified targets, respectively. Of note, the antibodies identified in the hTRF

173

assay were biased toward the IgG class (>80%) (Figure 4A). This bias was likely due to

174

lack of sensitivity in the assay for either IgA or IgM, as demonstrated in the control

in the cell-based screening, IgA (~20%) and IgM (~30%) antibodies were also well-

193

We evaluated Ig gene usage in memory B cells of six COVID-19 patients, using an NGS

194

analysis of identified and sequenced 134 hybridoma hits (Figure 5). Two thirds of

195

identified clones used the kappa locus, while the remaining clones used the lambda locus

196

(Figure 5A). Most of the identified VH regions of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies belonged to

197

IGHV3 gene family (59%), and the rest were from IGHV4 (15.8%), IGHV1 (14.5%), IGHV5

198

(7.2%), IGHV2 (2.9%) and IGHV7 (<1%) gene families (Figure 5B). Although there was

199

no dominant V gene variant, IGHV3-21 (8.6%), IGHV3-33 (7.1%) and IGHV3-48 (6.5%)

200

were among the most abundant identified sequences. The most frequent light chain V

201

regions were IGKV3 (26.6%), IGKV1 (22.3%), IGLV3 (13.67%) and IGLV2 (12.2%)

202

(Figure 5C). Furthermore, sequence analysis of hybridoma hits targeting SARS2 S

203

protein (Figure 5D, E) revealed the significant heterogeneity for V gene usage among B

204

cells that produced anti-viral antibodies. This observation is consistent with the parallel

205

expansion of B cell clones targeting multiple components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and

206

points to distinct successful strategies employed by the host adaptive immune response

207

during its co-evolution with the virus.

222

We next analyzed heavy and light chain pairs from 103 clones from which we determined

223

productive immunoglobulin RNA sequences. Strikingly, there was a lower-than-expected

224

rate of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the anti-S antibodies (Figure 6A) and a higher

225

SHM rate in antibodies specific to other viral proteins (ex. N, M, ORF8 and ORF10)

226

(Figure 6A). Of note, even a relatively modest rate of germline mutations in anti-S

227

antibodies resulted in the high affinity Spike-specific antibodies that potently neutralized

228

both S-pseudovirus (Figure 7) and SARS-CoV-2 live virus (manuscript in preparation).

229

Further, a combined analysis of Ig isotype and their level of SHM of virus-specific

230

antibodies revealed several key properties of the productive antiviral response. First,

231

among all “mutated” Igs that had more than 2% of their nucleotide sequence deviated

232

from the closest germline, there was an unusually high (26.4%) proportion of mutated

233

IgMs (Figure 6B), having a mean SHM rate of 5.73%. The functional basis of this

234

phenomenon is not known, but one could speculate that these IgMs came from non-

235

switched memory B cells that had undergone affinity maturation. Second, a subset of

236

such somatically hypermutated IgMs recognized full-length Spike, but not the soluble

237

RBD or S1 subunit of Spike protein. And third, while the predominant isotype among

238

class-switched antibodies was, as expected, IgG (Figure 6C), we were able to capture a

239

panel of fairly mutated virus-specific IgAs. It is plausible that these antibodies play a major

240

role in mucosal neutralization of the incoming virus and may be of particular use for

241

prophylaxis of viral infection and for vaccine design (Figure 6D).

We tested the functional properties of identified anti-Spike antibodies (Figure 7) in a WT

and D614G pseudovirus neutralization assay. Spike-expressing pseudoviruses were

260

generated using a lentiviral system and used to infect HEK293 cells overexpressing

supernatants, 3-4 log dilutions of 26 unique anti-Spike antibodies were tested for their

264

commercially available anti-Spike positive control. Several antibodies, including Ab#3

265

and Ab#26, potently neutralized pseudovirus infection with EC50 <500 ng/mL (Table 3).

266

Indeed, a full dose response of purified antibodies confirmed strong neutralizing activity

267

of both antibodies (Figure 7A). In addition to the WT (Wuhan) reference strain, various

268

mutations in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are prevalent throughout the population,

269

with the D614G variant being the dominant strain at the moment of writing of this

270

manuscript [29]. Thus, identified neutralizing antibodies were tested against and

271

neutralized the D614G S pseudovirus with comparable EC50 values (Figure 7B). To

272

further enhance neutralizing activity, combinatorial studies looked for any additive

273

effects seen with the addition of anti-Spike antibodies to Ab#3. Ultimately, Ab#1 at

274

various doses was able to enhance neutralizing activity above that of Ab#3 alone

275

(Figure 7C, D).

DISCUSSION

281
282

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has stimulated extraordinary efforts to study anti-viral

283

response and to develop means for treatment and prophylaxis, in both the academic and

284

the biopharmaceutical research communities. By the end of October 2020, a mere 11

285

months after the virus was first identified, the Clinicaltrials.gov database listed more than

286

3500 distinct clinical trial activities directed at patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There

287

is significant diversity among these efforts, from the assessment of existing drugs, to the

288

use of convalescent plasma from recovered patients, to the use of specific vaccines and

289

antibodies directed at the viral S protein. It is not yet apparent that there will be a single

20

290

approach that will prove to be uniformly effective at preventing viral infections or

291

accelerating viral clearance in all groups of COVID-19 patients.

292
293

It is possible that even the most effective approaches will have limited or unsustainable

294

efficacy. The vast majority of the ongoing efforts are all targeting the S protein. Both

295

passive (therapeutic antibodies) and active (vaccine) approaches directed at S protein

296

are expected to promote virus neutralization, that is, inhibition of viral entry into healthy

297

cells. Unfortunately, a mutation in S protein has already been reported [20,21] and further

298

mutations may ultimately limit the effectiveness of therapies directed at this single protein

299

[22].

300

Given the multiplicity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that induce antigen-specific T and B cell

301

responses in humans, it is reasonable that an unbiased interrogation of the memory B

302

cells generated by high-titer, convalescent COVID-19 patients could identify high-affinity

303

Igs directed at specific viral antigens. As an outcome of this approach, there was not a

304

single dominant V gene LC/HC combination specific to a particular viral protein among

305

characterized 134 Igs from convalescent patients. In fact, sequence analysis revealed a

306

lower rate of SHM of anti-Spike Igs than of antibodies directed at other viral proteins (N,

307

M, ORF8 and ORF10). Remarkably, even a modest rate of germline mutations in anti-S

308

antibodies resulted in potent neutralization of both S-expressing pseudovirus (Figure 7)

309

and SARS-CoV-2 live virus (manuscript in preparation). To our surprise, these Spike-

310

specific antibodies included an atypically high proportion of well-mutated anti-viral IgMs

311

(26.4% with a mean mutation rate of 5.73%) suggesting that non-switched memory B

312

cells also undergo affinity maturation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, a

21

313

subset of such mutated IgMs targeted the full-length Spike, but not soluble S1 or RBD

314

domains. The identification of IgG and IgA antibodies specific for the full range of targets

315

screened, including the RBD domain of S, highlights the requirement of additional events,

316

such as immunoglobulin class switching, for the development of a productive neutralizing

317

antibody response. Finally, and perhaps not unexpectedly, we have identified a group of

318

polyreactive antibodies (data not shown). A relatively high rate of SHM in these

319

polyreactive antibodies may suggest a secondary maturation event that redirected

320

immature B cell clones toward SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

321
322

The majority of anti-S antibodies, as expected, recognized a full-length S protein (Table

323

3). Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced antibodies to

324

a soluble receptor-binding domain of S protein (RBD). Of note, while most of the RBD-

325

and S1-specific antibodies were less mutated than those specific to the full-length S

326

protein, we identified several highly mutated RBD-specific outliers. Lower rate of SHM in

327

the S-specific antibody group may connote limited rounds of affinity-maturation for a high

328

antigenic protein. These anti-Spike antibodies demonstrated functional activity in a

329

pseudovirus neutralization assay. In fact, there were several potent neutralizing

330

antibodies (e.g., Ab#3, Ab#26), that had EC50 in 100 ng/mL range. One of these two

331

antibodies demonstrated a combinatorial effect with Ab#1 in pseudovirus (Figure 7C, D)

332

neutralization assays. The selectivity, affinity, and functional activity of the anti-Spike

333

antibodies suggest that they were a part of the successful anti-viral responses mounted

334

by the patients from which they were derived. By extension, the antibodies identified

335

against other viral targets may have also contributed to the viral clearance through

22

336

mechanisms other than neutralization (i.e., activators of complement and/or effector

337

cells).

338
339

In summary, an unbiased interrogation of the B cell repertoires of convalescent COVID-

340

19 patients demonstrated that these patients make a strong humoral response against a

341

broad array of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These responses included high affinity antibodies

342

of multiple Ig isotypes. The natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2 among these

343

patients stands in stark contrast to the anti-S focused approaches being taken to develop

344

therapeutic antibodies to treat COVID-19. An alternative approach should include

345

targeting a breadth of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with a cocktail of antibodies, with the

346

anticipation that a multi-targeted mixture will be more effective at inducing robust viral

347

clearance via neutralization and Fc-mediated activation of complement and effector cells.

360

washed twice in PBS and stained with a goat anti-human ACE2 polyclonal antibody

361

(R&D Systems, Cat # AF933) or isotype goat polyclonal isotype control (R&D Systems,

362

Cat # AB-108-C) at 1:100 dilution for 30 minutes on ice. Next, cells were washed twice

363

and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (Jackson

364

ImmunoResearch, Cat #705-545-147) at 1:200 dilution for 30 minutes on ice. Finally,

365

cells were washed twice and run on the Attune NxT (ThermoFisher). Data were

have their blood drawn and authorized the unrestricted use of their blood samples by

376

Immunome. The samples were deidentified and the B cells were isolated from those

377

deidentified blood samples. Immunome did not seek IRB approval of a “research project”

378

because analysis of peripheral blood samples that are obtained with consent,

379

deidentified, coded or anonymized are not believed to be subject to human tissue

Generation of hybridoma libraries

385

Hybridomas were generated following protocols for isolating and expanding primary B-

386

cells as well as electrofusion methods described in U.S. patents [24,25]. Hybridomas

387

stably expressing human mAbs were generated by electrofusion of expanded B-cells to

388

the B5-6T myeloma cell line, which expresses an ectopic human telomerase gene that

389

stabilizes human chromosomes in the hybrid cells created. Fused hybridomas were

390

plated into 96-well plates in growth medium with HAT selection of stable hybridomas for

391

7 days. After 7 days, growth media were switched to media with HT for stable selected

392

hybridoma growth. Hybridomas were cultured in a 37°C incubator for 14-21 days during

393

which time they were imaged for monoclonality and monitored for isotype-and sub-class-

394

specific Ig secretion. Supernatants from monoclonal wells expressing measurable levels

395

of Ig were cherry-picked and submitted for target-based screening.

396

HTRF Screening Assays

397
398

A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (hTRF) assay [26] comprised of terbium-

399

labeled anti-human IgG (H+L) (Cisbio, custom label) donor and AF488-labeled anti-HIS

400

(Cell Signaling, Cat # 14930S) acceptor antibodies was used to screen patient-derived

401

antibodies for their binding to recombinantly produced SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The assay,

402

adapted for high-throughput screening, was optimized so that a number of recombinant,

403

HIS-tagged SARS-CoV-2 target proteins could be substituted interchangeably. This

404

recombinant target panel consisted of two full-length viral structural proteins, S (FL,

405

trimer-stabilized, LakePharma) and N (GenScript); two truncated S protein domains, S1

406

(GenScript, Cat # Z03485-1) and RBD (aa 319-591, LakePharma); and two ORF proteins,

407

ORF3a (ProSci, Cat # 10-005) and ORF8 (ProSci, Cat # 10-002). Commercially available

Spike S1 (RBD) chimeric mAb (Sino Biological, Cat # 40150-D001), SARS CoV-2

410

Nucleocapsid human chimeric mAb (GenScript, Cat # A02039-100), or in-house

411

antibodies to ORF3a and ORF8 served as positive controls. Assay background was

412

determined by averaging the signal of wells containing only the donor and acceptor

413

cocktail. Hybridoma supernatants exhibiting signals greater than 2-fold over background

414

were reported as positive HITs and are submitted for Ig sequence analysis.

SARS-CoV-2 antigen sequences were cloned into pcDNA3.4 plasmids and transfected

419

into 293F cells utilizing the Expi293 Expression System (Life Technologies, Cat #

420

A14635) per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 N, ORF6, ORF8,

421

and ORF10 proteins were transferred into Expi293 Expression medium (Life

422

Technologies, Cat # A1435103) under antibiotic (Geneticin) selection (Gibco, Cat #

423

10131027) for 3-5 days following transfection to establish individual stable cell pools. The

424

stable cells were maintained under selection in the presence of Geneticin. Protein

427

SARS-CoV-2 S (S delta 19aa), M, ORF3a, and ORF7a were included in the screening

428

panel. Optimal protein expression was achieved two days post-transfection for ORF3a

429

and ORF7a and three days post-transfection for S and M proteins.

430
431

For both the cell-surface binding and intracellular detection assays, cells were incubated

432

with LIVE/DEAD Cell Stain kit (ThermoFisher, Cat # L34960) per the manufacturer’s

433

instructions. For cell surface binding, live cells expressing S delta 19aa were suspended

434

in QSol Buffer (IntelliCyte Corporation) to which a cocktail of Fc-specific secondary

435

antibodies was added: AF647 goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat #

436

109-605-008), AF488 goat anti-human IgA (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat # 109-115-

437

011) and BV650 mouse anti-human IgM (BioLegend, Cat # 314526).

438
439

For the permeabilization assay, stained cells were first fixed with paraformaldehyde

440

(BioLegend, Cat # 420801) at a final concentration of 1%. Fixed cells were then

441

permeabilized with Intracellular Permeabilization Buffer (BioLegend) according to the

442

manufacturer’s instructions. A cocktail of Fc-specific secondary antibodies consisting of

443

AF647 goat-anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.), PE goat-anti-human IgA

444

(Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.), and BV650 mouse-anti-human IgM (BioLegend) was

445

added to cell suspension.

446
447

For each assay, the cell suspensions were dispensed into 384-well plates, followed by

448

the addition of hybridoma supernatant at a 1:10 final dilution. The reaction was allowed

449

to incubate for 90 minutes at room temperature. For the permeabilization assay, plates

450

were centrifuged, and cell pellets were suspended in QSol Buffer (IntelliCyte

451

Corporation). Cells for each assay were fixed with a final concentration of 1%

452

paraformaldehyde and analyzed with IntelliCyte iQue Screener (IntelliCyte Corporation).

453

Positive binding gates for detection of each secondary antibody were established using

454

cells plus secondary antibody cocktail as a negative control. Binding of hybridoma

455

supernatant antibodies to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins was quantified as percent

456

positive relative to the secondary only control. To calculate percent positive, live events

457

that shifted into detection channels were divided by the total live events.

458
459

RNA isolation and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)

460

Hybridoma RNA was isolated using RNAqueous-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen,

461

Cat # AM1920). Isolated RNA samples were submitted to iRepertoire (Huntsville, AL) for

462

NGS. Hybridoma-derived RNA samples were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq

463

system at iRepertoire (Huntsville, AL). Sequencing runs were performed using the MiSeq

464

Nano Kit V2 following bead-based cleanup of RNA. Immunoglobulin sequences

465

containing CDR1, 2 and 3 and framework regions were amplified using IgG and IgA-

466

specific mixes for IgH, and kappa and lambda-specific primers for IgL. IgM-expressing

467

hybridoma samples, from which IgG or IgA heavy chains were not amplified using this

468

approach, were sequenced using the iRepertoire iPair system. Final sequences were

469

exported using iPair software.

470

The analysis of primary NGS data was performed by iRepertoire. Immunoglobulin

471

sequences were analyzed for predicted CDR sequences, % identity to appropriate

472

germlines, isotype of the constant regions and read counts. Sequence pairing was

473

performed based on the read count information. In the event more than one LC:HC pair

474

was discovered in a single well, each LC:HC combination was analyzed as a separate

475

antibody. In wells exhibiting 5’ truncation in the V region, the germline sequence was used

476

to create an expression construct. Final sequences were translated and analyzed for

477

potential stop codons and frame shifts.

478

Production of paired light and heavy chains

479

Variable domains yielding productive uninterrupted protein sequences were analyzed for

480

number of reads and the degree of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in comparison to the

481

closest immunoglobulin germline. Hybridoma hit sequences with at least one chain that

482

had more than 2% of SHM were advanced to HC/LC pairing and the recombinant

483

production of antibodies. Immunoglobulin expression fragments were cloned into the

484

pcDNA3.4-based vectors and expressed in 293F cells. Affinity and binding pattern of

485

recombinant antibodies were compared to the original antibody-containing hybridoma

486

supernatants in BLI, HTRF and cell-based assay. Antibody-containing supernatants or

487

purified antibodies were advanced to downstream assays. If multiple heavy or light chain

488

sequences were detected within one well, their CDRs were aligned and compared for

489

potential PCR errors. In cases where multiple sequences within a well were different, i.e.,

490

originated from separate clones, all potential combinations of light and heavy chains were

491

recombinantly produced and tested in downstream assays. Wells that yielded a single

492

HC/LC pair were advanced to recombinant expression and downstream assays. 5’

493

fragments of the constant regions were sequenced to identify the isotype of the antibody

494

and compared to the experimentally identified isotype of hybridoma supernatants. The

resulting isotype of the heavy or light chain was assigned based on two or more positive

496

readings from experimental (ex. ELISA and FACS) assays and sequencing.

500

Spike-expressing pseudovirus was generated with System Bioscience’s pPACK-SPIKE

501

packaging system (System Biosciences, Cat # CVD19-50A-1) as per manufacturer’s

502

protocol. Briefly, 8x106 293TN Producer cells (System Biosciences, Cat # LV900A-1)

503

were plated in T150 flasks overnight. Plasmids encoding lentiviral packaging proteins

504

and Spike were added 1mL of plain DMEM for each T150 being transfected. 55 mL of

505

PureFection reagent (System Biosciences; Cat # LV750A-1) was added to each 1mL

506

tube, vortexed for 10 seconds, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The

507

plasmid and PureFection mixture was added to a T150 flask containing 293TN cells and

508

placed in a 37°C incubator containing 5% CO2 for 48 hours. Pseudovirus-containing

509

supernatants were harvested at 48 hours and passed through a 0.45-micron PVDF filter

510

to remove cellular debris. 5x PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences,

511

Cat # LV810A-1) was added to supernatants and incubated 4°C overnight.

512

Pseudovirus-containing supernatants containing 1x PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution

513

were then spun at 1500 x g for 30 minutes. Pseudovirus-containing pellets were

514

resuspended in plain DMEM to achieve at 10x concentration and frozen at -80°C in

515

single use aliquots.

Pseudovirus infection and neutralization assays were performed by adapting

established protocols [27, 28]. In summary, 104 ACE2-293T cells were plated in the

519

inner 60 wells of a 96 well flat bottom plate in 100uL of ACE2-293T media overnight in a

pseudovirus-containing supernatants were thawed from -80°C and two-fold dilutions

were performed. 100 mL of pseudovirus at various dilutions was added to ACE2-293T

523

cells. To test neutralization activity of antibodies, indicated antibody concentrations

524

were pre-incubated with pseudovirus for 1 hour in a 37°C incubator containing 5% CO2.

525

Then, 100 mL of antibody/pseudovirus mixture was added to ACE2-293T cells. After 72

526

hours, cells and media were equilibrated to room temperature for 20 minutes. 100 mL

527

of media was removed and replaced with 100 mL of Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay

528

Reagent (Promega, Cat # E2620). Luciferase activity was measured on the EnSpire

529

Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). Percent neutralization was calculated using RLUs with the

530

equation [(RLU of Virus + cells) – (RLU of Experimental Sample)] / [(RLU of Virus +

531

cells) – (RLU of cells only)].
