Abstract

15

SARS-CoV2 is a single strand RNA virus member of the type 2 coronavirus family,

16

responsible for causing COVID-19 disease in humans. The objective of this study was to

17

test the ivermectin drug in a murine model of coronavirus infection using a type 2 family

18

RNA coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV2, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). BALB/cJ

19

female mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (Group Infected; n=20) and

20

immediately treated with one single dose of 500 µg/kg of ivermectin (Group Infected +

21

IVM; n=20), or were not infected and treated with PBS (Control group; n=16). Five days

22

after infection/treatment, mice were euthanized to obtain different tissues to check general

health status and infection levels. Overall results demonstrated that viral infection induces

24

the typical MHV disease in infected animals, with livers showing severe hepatocellular

25

necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated

26

with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while ivermectin administration showed a

27

better health status with lower viral load (23,192 AU; p<0.05) and few livers with

28

histopathological damage (p<0.05), not showing statistical differences with control mice

29

(P=NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine

30

aminotransferase) were significantly lower in treated mice compared to infected animals.

31

In conclusion, ivermectin seems to be effective to diminish MHV viral load and disease

32

in mice, being a useful model for further understanding new therapies against coronavirus

33

diseases.

Introduction

38

SARS-CoV2 is a beta-coronavirus recently identified to be responsible for the severe

39

acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19. This new pandemic virus is causing huge losses

40

in terms of human lives and macroeconomic consequences worldwide. Tremendous

41

efforts are being carried out to stop the pandemic that is affecting nowadays millions of

42

people, and in that sense early and accurate diagnosis, effective vaccines or proven

43

treatments are being developed. However, experimental conditions with SARS-CoV2 are

44

not easily available in research laboratories due to biosecurity reasons, thus having in vivo

45

preclinical data is not always easy. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a similar single strand

46

RNA coronavirus (Fan et al., 2020) affecting different mouse organs (Weiss and

47

Leibowitz, 2011), also highly contagious with natural transmission occurring by

48

respiratory or oral routes, showing high morbidity and low mortality rate, with no vaccine

49

or treatment available, whose control requires to sacrifice the entire laboratory mice

50

colony when an infection occurs. It has been proposed that MHV could be an interesting

51

model to test new therapies for COVID 19 in animal models, since it has been recently

52

demonstrated that the mechanism of infection has some similarities with SARS-CoV-2

53

(Körner et al., 2020). After entry into the host cell, both coronaviruses require a similar

54

nuclear transport system mediated by the importin α/β1 heterodimer (Timani et al., 2005;

55

Wulan et al., 2015), making this system an interesting target for the development of

56

candidate therapies against the viral infection.

57
58

Ivermectin is an efficient and non-expensive drug usually applied to treat parasite

59

infestations, FDA-approved for animal and human use and available worldwide. It has

60

been proved to have a wide margin of safety with a DL50 of 30 mg/kg in mice and is used

61

in humans at a therapeutic dose of 150-200 µg/kg as antiparasitic treatment (Crump and

62

Ōmura, 2011). This drug acts on the cells at different levels, and in some cases has shown

63

an in vitro effect against RNA and DNA virus infection (Heidary and Gharebaghi, 2020)

64

by the suppression of a host cellular process related with the inhibition of nuclear

65

transport of specific proteins required for viral replication (Wagstaff et al., 2012).

66

Recently, in June 2020, it was reported in an in vitro cell model that ivermectin was

67

effective against SARS-CoV2, showing an inhibition of the virus replication and making

68

it a possible candidate for COVID-19 as a repurposing drug (Caly et al., 2020).

69

Information on the in vivo antiviral effect of ivermectin against coronavirus has not been

70

published yet, something needed in order to progress on the development of new

71

therapeutic strategies for the control of these types of coronavirus.

73

The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo effect of the ivermectin drug in a

74

murine model of a type 2 family RNA coronavirus, the MHV, in terms of general health

75

profile and hepatic viral load and functionality. We hypothesize that the administration

76

of a single dose of ivermectin in recently infected mice decreases viral load and impairs

77

the action of the virus on the host organism.

Materials and Methods

80

Animals and management

81

A total of 56 BALB/cJ female mice (6-8 weeks old) were bred at the Transgenic and

82

Experimental Animal Unit of Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, under specific pathogen

83

free conditions in individually ventilated racks (IVC, 1285L, Tecniplast, Milan, Italy).

84

During the experimental procedure, females were housed in groups of seven in negative

85

pressure microisolators (ISOCageN, Tecniplast) with aspen wood bedding chips (Toplit

86

6, SAFE, Augy, France), paper towels and cardboard tubes as environmental enrichment.

87

They had ad libitum access to autoclaved food (5K67, LabDiet, MO, USA) and filtered

88

water. Housing environmental conditions during the experiment were as follow: 20±1°C

89

temperature, 30-70% relative humidity, negative pressure (biocontainment) and

90

light/dark cycle of 12/12 h. Experimental protocols were opportunely approved by the

91

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #008-16) and were performed

92

according to national law #18.611 and international guidelines. All procedures were

93

performed under Biosafety level II conditions.

94

Female mice were randomly distributed in three experimental groups: Infected (n=20),

95

Infected + IVM (n=20) and Control (n=16). Experiments were conducted in three

96

independent replicates.

97
98

MHV-A59 preparation

99

MHV-A59 (ATCC® VR-764™) viruses were expanded in murine L929 cells

100

(ATCC® CCL-1™) to reach a concentration of 1×107 plaque forming unit (PFU)/mL. The

101

virus-containing supernatants were stored at -80°C until further use.

102
103

Infection and treatment

104

Before the infection, mice were weighed and bled from the submandibular vein for basal

105

blood determinations. Mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 diluted in 100

106

µL of sterile PBS administered by intraperitoneal route. Immediately after, mice from

107

Infected + IVM group were treated with one single dose of 500 µg/kg of ivermectin

108

(Ivomec 1%, Merial, France), diluted in 50 µL of PBS via s.c. The other two groups

109

(Infected and Control) received 50 µL of PBS via s.c. Five days after infection/treatment,

110

mice were weighed and 300 µL of blood were retrieved for plasma cytokines

111

quantification, metabolic and hematological profile from submandibular vein. Mice were

112

immediately euthanized by cervical dislocation to dissect liver and spleen for weight

113

recording, histological and qPCR analysis. At necropsy, liver appearance was blindly

114

scored (0 to 3) by an independent trained technician considering the main pathologic

115

pattern of MHV infection (Macphee et al., 1985; Perlman, 1998). Briefly, gross hepatic

116

lesions were identified as multifocal to coalescent whitish spots of less than 1mm

117

diameter, defined as hepatic granulomas.

119

Histological analysis

120

Immediately after necropsy, liver and spleen were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin

121

(pH 7.4) for further processing. For evaluation, they were embedded in paraffin, sectioned

122

at 4 µm and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), according to (Kyuwa et al., 2002).

123

Specimens were whole examined under light microscope (Olympus BX41, Japan) at 10X

124

in three randomly selected areas, or in the highest incidence areas of each specimen, by

125

three different pathologists, to establish a histopathological score in each case, with a

126

previously defined semi-quantitative microscopic grading centered in the identification

127

of the typical histopathologic changes caused by MHV (characterized by the presence of

128

hepatocellular necrotic areas and granulomatous inflammatory reaction), according to the

129

following criteria: 0 = normal (no necrotic areas identified in the whole specimen); + = <

130

10 necrotic areas; ++ = 10-20 necrotic areas; +++ = > 20 necrotic areas.

131
132

Hepatic viral load

133

After dissecting and trimming the whole liver, two samples (0.5x0.5cm, each) of the

134

hepatic right lobe were retrieved for qPCR analysis. Samples were loaded in cryotubes

135

with TRI Reagent® (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, US) and immediately plunged

136

into liquid nitrogen until analysis. Total RNA was isolated according to the

137

manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2µg total RNA, employing M-

138

MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and random primers

139

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sample analysis was performed with a QuantStudio 3

140

Real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher) using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master

141

(Rox) (Roche, Basel, CH). Primers employed sequences were MHV Forward primer (5’6

ACCACAAGATTATCATTTTCACAACATA. The reactions were performed according

144

to the following settings: 95°C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, followed by

145

60°C for 1 min. The quantification of viral loads was performed with a relative standard

146

curve method.

147
148

Blood biochemistry profile

149

Individual whole blood (100 µL) was analyzed for liver and kidney profile using the

150

Pointcare V2 automatic device (Tianjin MNCHIP Technologies Co, China) at the

151

beginning (preinfection determination) and at the end of the experiment (postinfection

152

determination). Analyzed parameters included total proteins (TP), albumin (ALB),

153

globulin (GLO), ALB/GLO ratio, total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),

154

aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamiltranspeptidase (GGT), blood urea

155

nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), BUN/CRE ratio and glucose (GLU).

156
157

Hematological parameters.

158

For hematologic analysis, aliquots of 20 µL of blood were collected into 0.5 mL

159

microtubes containing EDTA potassium salts (W anticoagulant, Wiener lab, Rosario,

160

Argentina) in a ratio of 1:10 (EDTA: blood) at pre and postinfection stages. All

161

measurements were conducted within four hours after collection. Total white blood cells

162

(WBC) count, differential WBC count and percentage, red blood cells (RBC) count,

163

hemoglobin (HGC), hematocrit (HCT), and platelet (PLT) count, were evaluated using

164

the auto hematology analyzer BC-5000Vet (Mindray Medical International Ltd.,

165

Shenzhen, China).

Cytokines quantification and flow cytometry analysis:

168

Bead-based multiplex assays were employed to quantify cytokines (LEGENDplex™

169

mouse Inflammation Panel, BioLegend Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) in plasma samples

170

obtained from mice at pre and postinfection stages, according to manufacturer's

171

instructions. Briefly, blood samples with EDTA as anticoagulant were centrifuged for 10

172

min at 1000 x g, and plasma was recovered and stored at -20 °C until use. For the assay,

173

25 µL of 2-fold diluted plasma samples, diluted standards, and blanks were added into

174

the corresponding tubes; 25 µL of pre-mixed beads and detection antibodies were added

175

to all the tubes. Tubes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. After

176

this, and without washing, 25 µL of StreptAvidin- PhycoErythrin (SA-PE) conjugate was

177

added, and the tubes were incubated for 30 min and finally washed and suspended in 200

178

µL of wash buffer. Data were acquired in a BD AccuriTM C6 (BD Biosciences, USA)

179

flow cytometer. BD AccuriTM C6 software was used for data acquisition. Beads

180

excitation was achieved using 488 and 640 nm lasers and emission was detected using

181

530/30 and 665/20 nm bandpass filters, respectively. For each analyte to be detected,

182

4,000 beads gated on a forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) dot plot were

room temperature. After washing in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin,

191

nucleated cells were incubated on ice for 15 min with an antibody mixture. The following

192

fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were used: Anti-CD4-FITC (#11004181, clone

193

GK1.5) and anti-CD8-PE-Cy7 (#25008182, clone 53-6.7) from eBioscience™ (San

194

Diego, CA, USA) and anti-CD19-PerCP-CyTM 5.5 (#551001, clone ID3), from BD

195

Pharmingen (San Diego, CA, USA). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using an

196

AttuneTM Nxt Acoustic Focusing Cytometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a 488 nm

197

laser. Emissions were detected using 530/30, 695/40 and 780/60 nm bandpass filters, for

198

FITC, PerCP-Cy5.5 and PE-Cy7, respectively. FlowJoTM software, version 10.6.1 (Tree

199

star, Ashland, Oregon, USA) was used for data analysis. Unstained controls, single-color

200

controls and fluorescence- minus-one controls were used to compensate and to establish

201

baseline gate settings for each respective antibody combination.

202

Lymphocytes were gated based on their FSC and SSC dot plot profile, and FSC area vs

203

FSC height dot plot was used to exclude doublets. B lymphocytes were defined as CD19-

204

PerCP-Cy5.5 positive cells. For T lymphocyte analysis, a gate was placed on CD19-

205

negative population and based on PE-Cy7 vs FITC dot plot, CD8-PE-Cy7 positive cells

206

and CD4-FITC positive cells were defined as CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes,

207

respectively. A minimum of 10,000 events in a single cell region were collected. Results

208

were expressed as % of specific cell type from analyzed single cell population

214

random variables. Data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance by

215

histograms, q-q plots, and formal statistical tests as part of the univariate procedure. The

216

type of variance-covariance structures was chosen depending on the magnitude of the

217

Akaike information criterion (AIC) for models run under heterogeneous compound

218

symmetry, unstructured, autoregressive, spatial power, and first-order ante-dependence.

219

The model with the lowest AIC was chosen. Data are presented as mean ± SEM and the

220

significance level were defined for a p-value of 0.05.

Results

223

Body and organ weight, macroscopic liver appearance

224

Body weight determined at the beginning and at the end of the experiment (i.e., pre and

225

postinfection, respectively) was affected by the viral infection. While those animals from

226

Control and Infected + IVM groups gained weight during the experimental period

227

(p<0.05), those mice from the Infected group did not show statistical differences pre and

228

postinfection (P=NS). Both liver and spleen from Infected and Infected + IVM groups

229

were heavier than Control group at necropsy (p<0.05). Liver macroscopic appearance

230

was impaired in the Infected group when compared to Infected + IVM or Control group

231

(p<0.05). Results are shown in Figure 1 and 2.

232
233

Histological analysis

234

As observed, livers of mice from the Infected group were characterized by a severe

235

hepatocellular necrosis, with high incidence of specimens (15/20) with more than 20

236

necrotic areas, surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration. The

237

typical hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory infiltration were present, but in all the

238

cases of lesser grading in the Infected + IVM group (6/20). Mice from Control group did

239

not show any hepatocellular or spleen lesions (0/16). Representative histological liver

240

images are shown in Figure 1.

241
242

Hepatic viral load

243

Results obtained from qPCR analysis showed a significantly higher viral load in the livers

244

of Infected group vs. Infected + IVM or Control group (p<0.05), with a load of 52,158 ±

245

15,235 arbitrary units (AU) for the infected animals (Figure 3). Ivermectin treatment

246

significantly lowered the viral load (23,192 ± 6,796 AU; p<0.05), which is in well

247

accordance with other disease features observed.

248
249

Blood biochemistry profile

250

To check liver and kidney health profile, several biochemical parameters (TP, GLO,

251

ALB, A/G, TB, ALT, AST, GGT, BUN, CRE, BUN/CRE and GLU) were analyzed at

252

the beginning (preinfection) and at the end of the experiment (postinfection) from

253

complete blood. Total proteins decreased after infection in the Infected and Infected +

254

IVM groups when compared with basal profile determinations (p<0.05) (Figure 4A).

255

Albumin levels decreased in all experimental groups, being lower for Infected and

256

Infected + IVM groups (p<0.05) (Figure 4B). On the contrary, globulin levels increased

257

after infection for both infected groups, showing statistical differences when compared to

258

Control group (p<0.05) (Figure 4C). The A/G ratio showed a decrease between basal and

259

final stages for the three groups, again being lower for both infected groups (p<0.05)

260

(Figure 4D). Total bilirubin did not show statistical differences among the groups for

261

basal and final determinations (Figure 4E).

262

Hepatic transaminases such as ALT and AST showed an important increase in animals

263

from the Infected group when compared with animals from the Infected + IVM or Control

264

group (p<0.05) (Figure 5A and B). GGT levels were similar among groups and pre or

265

postinfection (P=NS) (Figure 5C). BUN levels decreased after infection/treatment

266

(p<0.05). CRE levels were lower for the animals of the Infected group at the end of the

267

experiment when compared with animals from the Infected + IVM group (p<0.05).

268

BUN/CRE ratio was similar among groups and blood determinations (P=NS), and GLU

269

levels decreased in animals from the Infected group after infection when compared with

270

Control group (p<0.05). Results are shown in Figure 6A, B, C and D.

271
272

Blood profile

273

Hematological parameters obtained from peripheral blood samples at pre and

274

postinfection stages are summarized in Table 1. A significant decrease in the number of

275

WBC was found in animals from both virus-infected groups (Figure 7A), whereas no

276

changes in RBC, HGC, HCT, or platelets were found, compared with control or pre-

277

infection values (Table 1). Absolute WBC and lymphocyte counts were increased in the

278

control group, comparing pre and postinfection time points.

279

Regarding WBC differential, the percentage of neutrophils and monocytes significantly

280

increased in animals from both infected groups. In contrast, the percentage and counts of

281

pre-infection values (Figure 7C). Moreover, animals from the infected group that received

284

ivermectin treatment showed an increase in the number of neutrophils compared with

285

animals from the infected group (Figure 7D).

286

To further characterize the reduction of lymphocyte population observed in animals from

287

the infected groups, B and T lymphocytes were analyzed by the detection of specific cell

288

surface markers: CD19 (B lymphocytes) or CD8 and CD4 (T lymphocytes), at the

289

endpoint of the experiment. Results showed that both B and T lymphocytes percentages

290

were reduced in mice from virus-infected groups, compared to control group (Figure 7B),

291

being the CD8+ cells the subpopulation with the highest reduction (64 % and 66% of

292

depletion for Infected and Infected + IVM groups, respectively).

293
294

Proinflammatory cytokines

295

Cytokines obtained from plasma samples at the endpoint of the experiment (five days

296

after the viral inoculation) were measured in the three groups. From the panel of 13

297

inflammatory related cytokines, only IFNɣ and MCP-1 were significantly increased in

298

both infected groups (p<0.05), compared with the control values, regardless ivermectin

299

treatment. On the other hand, TNFα values, which were increased in mice from the

300

Infected group, were reduced in the animals that received ivermectin treatment, the latter

301

being not statistically different from the control mice (Figure 8).

302

No statistically significant differences were observed for other analyzed cytokines (IL-

303

1b, IL-1a, IL-23, IL-12p70, IL-10, or IFNβ) and for other cases (IL-6, IL-27, IL-17A and

304

GM-CSF) proteins could not even be detected as their values were below the detection

305

limit of the assay.

Discussion

308

This study proposes a mouse experimental model for in vivo evaluation of

309

pharmacological therapies against coronavirus diseases. It is well known that preclinical

310

animal models are of utmost relevance when developing new therapies or vaccines that

311

will be applied in humans. The need to develop animal models to study SARS-CoV2 has

312

been recently proposed by many researchers (Johansen et al., 2020). Our study is based

313

in the already tested in vitro reports of the use of ivermectin against several other RNA

314

and DNA human and animal viruses (Heidary and Gharebaghi, 2020), such as influenza

315

A virus, West Nile virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Zika, chikungunya,

316

Newcastle disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, HIV-1, dengue

317

virus, yellow fever and tick-borne encephalitis virus, pseudorabies, porcine circovirus,

318

parvovirus and bovine herpesvirus. However, most of these studies reported only in vitro

319

results and the information of the effect of this drug used in in vivo models is scarce.

320

Regarding the recent appearance of SARS-CoV2, although several ongoing studies are

321

being conducted, no information has been published yet on the in vivo effect of ivermectin

322

administration on infected individuals with this kind of virus.

323
324

In our model, mice infected with MHV and immediately treated with ivermectin showed

325

a lower hepatic viral load five days after infection, and a better general health status when

326

compared with infected animals with no ivermectin treatment. At the moment of the

327

necropsy and histological analysis, the liver of infected and untreated mice showed the

328

worst appearance, with several animals with severe hepatocellular necrosis and

329

lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration. Treated group showed lesser grading of

330

anomalies, although liver and spleen weight were heavier for both infected groups when

331

compared with the control group. The organ weight increase following the infection is

332

indicative of the immune reaction (Robinson et al., 2016), something that cannot be

333

evaluated in an in vitro model. These findings are commonly found in MHV infected

334

mice (Barthold, 1997) and the generalized immune reaction can be confirmed with the

335

cytokine’s levels found in our study in both infected groups. Viral load was significantly

336

lower in those infected animals that received ivermectin, probably due to an impairment

337

in virus entrance to the cell since this drug has been shown to inhibit nuclear import to

338

the host cell (Kosyna et al., 2015).

339
340

The liver and kidney serum biochemical outcomes showed a clear impairment of

341

metabolic profile mainly due to liver damage. Both groups of infected mice showed

342

hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia, with a decrease in A/G ratio when compared

343

with the control group. Variation in both proteins are indicative of hepatic damage

344

(Carvalho and Machado, 2018). Serum concentration of transaminases such as AST and

345

ALT, which are also indicative of liver function (Smith et al., 2013), were significantly

346

higher in those virus infected mice that did not receive ivermectin, and associated with

347

the rest of the studied variables suggest liver injury. A considerable decrease in serum

348

creatinine levels was found in infected mice, again representing a major liver damage in

349

sick animals. Glucose levels also showed a significant decrease in infected mice, probably

350

due to the fasting of animals related to an impairment in general health status. All in all,

351

this metabolic profile shows a major liver damage mostly in infected animals, in

352

concordance with the rest of data analyzed during the study. The treatment with

353

ivermectin was effective to reduce the effect of the virus infection, encouraging proposing

354

novel therapies against coronavirus diseases.

355
356

The most relevant hematological findings were an increase in neutrophils and monocytes

357

percentages and a reduction in WBC and lymphocytes (B and T) in both infected groups,

358

regardless of ivermectin treatment. Neutrophilia and lymphopenia have been well

359

documented in viral respiratory infection diseases in mouse models and humans (Camp

360

and Jonsson, 2017; Feng et al., 2015; Preusse et al., 2015). The increase in the percentage

361

of neutrophils in the virus-infected groups could be associated with the acute-phase viral

362

infection. On the other hand, the reduction in lymphocytes might be due to

363

migration/retention of these cells in the liver and/or lymphoid tissue. The rapid

364

development of lymphopenia was also observed in COVID-19 patients with adverse

365

outcomes, whereby CD4+ T-cells are more severely reduced than CD8+ T-cells (Chen

366

and Subbarao, 2007; Guan et al., 2020). Neutrophils count was the only hematological

367

parameter that differed among the virus-infected animals, being higher in mice from the

368

ivermectin treated group. Nevertheless, this difference did not impact the WBC

369

differential values. Moreover, in both infected groups, neutrophils counts were increased

370

compared with the corresponding preinfection time point, and ivermectin treatment alone

371

did not differ from control values (data not shown). Taking hematological data together,

372

it seems that differences observed between groups would be related to the viral infection

373

itself, rather than to an ivermectin effect. Studies about immunomodulatory effects of

374

ivermectin are variable (Sajid et al., 2006), making it difficult to clearly define its

375

function. On this regard, the in vivo mouse model of MHV infection would not support a

376

modulatory action of ivermectin on the immune response. On the other hand, these results

377

are in accordance with various reports demonstrating that the broad-spectrum antiviral

378

potential of ivermectin against several RNA viruses is due to its ability to specifically

379

bind to and destabilize the importin α/β heterodimer, thereby preventing importin α/β

380

from binding to the viral protein, which in turn blocks the nuclear trafficking of viral

381

proteins (Jans and Wagstaff, 2020; Sharun et al., 2020; Caly et al., 2020).

382

Regarding cytokines analysis, only IFN-ɣ and MCP-1 were increased in mice from the

383

viral-infected groups, compared to mice from the Control group. These increases are in

384

line with the general immune response associated with a viral infection. On the other

385

hand, ivermectin treatment seemed not to exert a significant effect in the modulation of

386

most of the inflammatory cytokines. An exception was TNF-α, whose value was

387

significantly reduced in the ivermectin treated animals when compared with mice from

388

the infected group. It has been reported that ivermectin can exert anti-inflammatory

389

effects in in vitro cell models by downregulating NF-kB signaling pathways and

390

regulating TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 (Ci et al., 2009), and in in vivo models by decreasing

391

the production of TNF-α, IL-1ß and IL-6 (Zhang et al., 2008).

392

In the present work, neither IL-1β nor IL-10 or IL-6 were modulated by ivermectin. It is

393

possible that differences regarding the experimental model, the route of infection and the

394

time window of the measurements could account for these discrepancies, since in a living

395

organism the immune response is influenced by more than one cellular component of the

396

immunological system. Moreover, the similar hematological profiles of both infected

397

groups suggest that the main antiviral effect of the ivermectin would not be through

398

immunomodulatory actions.

399

Conclusion

401

This study demonstrates that ivermectin administration reduces MHV liver viral load in

402

infected mice, enhancing general health status. This preclinical model can be suitable to

403

further study the effect of ivermectin in coronavirus infection, as a possible murine

Figure 2: Body weight at the beginning and the end of the experiment (A), and organ

552

weight and liver appearance at necropsy five days postinfection (B, C and D,

553

respectively). Both liver and spleen of infected animals were heavier than control group

554

(p<0.05). Liver macroscopic appearance was impaired in mice from the Infected group

555

when compared with mice from the Infected + IVM or Control group (scale 0-3) (p<0.05)

556

(Mean ± SD). Different letters indicate significant differences (p<0.05) between pre and

557

post infection time for A, and significant differences (p<0.05) between indicated groups

558

for B, C and D.
