Abstract
There is intense interest in antibody immunity to coronaviruses. However, it is unknown if
coronaviruses evolve to escape such immunity, and if so, how rapidly. Here we address this
question by characterizing the historical evolution of human coronavirus 229E. We identify
human sera from the 1980s and 1990s that have neutralizing titers against contemporaneous
229E that are comparable to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or
vaccination. We test these sera against 229E strains isolated after sera collection, and find that
neutralizing titers are lower against these “future” viruses. In some cases, sera that neutralize
contemporaneous 229E viral strains with titers >1:100 do not detectably neutralize strains
isolated 8–17 years later. The decreased neutralization of “future” viruses is due to antigenic
evolution of the viral spike, especially in the receptor-binding domain. If these results
extrapolate to other coronaviruses, then it may be advisable to periodically update SARS-CoV-2
vaccines.
Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused an urgent need to determine how well antibody
immunity protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evidence so far is promising.
Neutralizing and anti-spike antibodies elicited by natural infection correlate with reduced
SARS-CoV-2 infection of humans (Addetia et al., 2020; Lumley et al., 2020), and vaccines that
elicit such antibodies protect humans with high efficacy (Polack et al., 2020). These findings in
humans are corroborated by a multitude of animal studies showing that neutralizing antibodies
to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protect against infection and disease (Alsoussi et al., 2020; McMahan
et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020).
However, humans are repeatedly re-infected with the “common-cold” coronaviruses
229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 (Edridge et al., 2020; Hendley et al., 1972; Schmidt et al., 1986).
For instance, serological studies suggest that the typical person is infected with 229E every 2–3
years (Edridge et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 1986), although a lower infection rate and no 229E
re-infections were reported in a 4-year study that identified infections by the criteria of a

positive PCR test in the context of respiratory illness (Aldridge et al., 2020). In any case, the fact
that common-cold coronavirus re-infections occur at some appreciable rate has led to concerns
that coronavirus immunity is not “durable.” These concerns initially focused on the possibility
that the immune response itself is not durable (Ibarrondo et al., 2020). This possibility now
seems less likely, as SARS-CoV-2 infection induces neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells
with dynamics similar to other respiratory viruses (Crawford et al., 2020a; Gaebler et al., 2020;
Rodda et al., 2020; Wajnberg et al., 2020).
But there is another mechanism by which viruses can re-infect even in the face of
long-lived and effective antibodies: antigenic evolution. For example, infection with influenza
virus elicits antibodies that generally protect humans against that same viral strain for at least
several decades (Couch and Kasel, 1983; Yu et al., 2008). Unfortunately, influenza virus
undergoes rapid antigenic evolution to escape these antibodies (Bedford et al., 2014), meaning
that although immunity to the original viral strain lasts for decades, humans are susceptible to
infection by its descendants within about 5 years (Couch and Kasel, 1983; Ranjeva et al., 2019).
This continual antigenic evolution is the reason that the influenza vaccine is periodically
updated.
Strangely, the possibility of antigenic evolution by coronaviruses has received only
modest attention, perhaps because coronaviruses have lower mutation rates than other RNA
viruses (Denison et al., 2011; Sanjuán et al., 2010). However, mutation rate is just one factor that
shapes antigenic evolution; influenza and measles virus both have high mutation rates, but only
the former undergoes rapid antigenic evolution. Furthermore, the assumption of minimal
coronavirus antigenic evolution is not supported by the limited evidence to date. In the 1980s,
human-challenge studies found that individuals infected with one strain of 229E were resistant
to re-infection with that same strain, but partially susceptible to a different strain (Reed, 1984).
Additional experimental studies suggest that sera or antibodies can differentially recognize
spike proteins from different 229E strains (Shirato et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2017). From a
computational perspective, several studies have reported that the spikes of 229E and OC43
evolve under positive selection (Chibo and Birch, 2006; Kistler and Bedford, 2020; Ren et al.,
2015), which is often a signature of antigenic evolution.
Here we experimentally assess whether coronavirus 229E escapes neutralization by
human polyclonal sera by reconstructing the virus’s evolution over the last several decades. We
show that historical sera that potently neutralize virions pseudotyped with contemporary 229E
spikes often have little or no activity against spikes from 229E strains isolated 8–17 years later.
Conversely, modern sera from adults generally neutralize spikes from a wide span of historical
viruses, whereas modern sera from children best neutralize spikes from recent viruses that
circulated during the children’s lifetimes. These patterns are explained by antigenic evolution of
the spike, especially within the receptor-binding domain. If SARS-CoV-2 undergoes similarly
rapid antigenic evolution, then it may be advisable to periodically update vaccines to keep pace
with viral evolution.

We focused our studies on the viral spike protein because it is the main target of neutralizing
antibodies (Tortorici and Veesler, 2019), and because anti-spike antibodies are the immune
parameter best established to associate with protection against coronavirus infection in humans
(Addetia et al., 2020; Callow, 1985; Callow et al., 1990; Lumley et al., 2020; Polack et al., 2020).
Because SARS-CoV-2 has circulated in humans for less than a year, we needed to choose
another coronavirus with a more extensive evolutionary history. Of the four human-endemic
common-cold coronaviruses, the two alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63 are similar to
SARS-CoV-2 in binding a protein receptor via the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD, also
known as S1-B) (Hofmann et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2020; Yeager et al., 1992). In contrast, the two
betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 bind glycan receptors via the spike’s N-terminal domain
(NTD, also known as S1-A) (Hulswit et al., 2019). Antibodies that block receptor binding
dominate the neutralizing activity of immunity elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Abe et al.;
Piccoli et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020), so we reasoned that even though SARS-CoV-2 is a
betacoronavirus, its antigenic evolution is more likely to be foreshadowed by the two human
alphacoronaviruses that also use their RBD to bind a protein receptor. Of these two viruses, we
chose 229E since it has circulated in humans for >50 years (Hamre and Procknow, 1966),
whereas NL63 was only identified in 2003 (van der Hoek et al., 2004).
We inferred a phylogenetic tree of 229E spikes from direct or low-passage human
isolates (Figure 1A), excluding​ ​older strains passaged extensively in the lab (Hamre and
Procknow, 1966). There are several important features of the tree. First, it is clock-like, with
sequence divergence proportional to virus isolation date (Figures 1A and S1). Second, the tree is
“ladder-like,” with short branches off a single trunk (Figure 1A). The ladder-like shape of the
229E phylogeny has been noted previously (Chibo and Birch, 2006; Hodcroft, 2020; Kistler and
Bedford, 2020), and is a signature of viruses such as influenza for which immune pressure
drives population turnover by selecting for antigenic variants (Bedford et al., 2011; Fitch et al.,
1997). Third, sequences group by date rather than country of isolation (in Figure 1A, sequences
from different countries but the same year are nearby). Phylogenies that organize by date rather
than geography indicate fast global transmission, another signature of human influenza virus
(Lemey et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2007). Finally, although there is some intra-spike
recombination, it is among closely related strains and does not affect the broader topology of
the tree (Figure S2). For our study, the key implication of the above observations is that date of
virus isolation is a good proxy for evolutionary position, since 229E evolves primarily along a
single trajectory through time.
For our experiments, we chose five spikes from 229E viruses spaced at roughly 8-year
intervals spanning 1984 to 2016 (Figure 1A). We synthesized genes encoding all five spikes,
truncating the last 19 residues of the cytoplasmic tail since this improves titers of
spike-pseudotyped viruses (Crawford et al., 2020a; Kawase et al., 2009; Rogers et al., 2020).
These five spikes differ by up to 4% in amino-acid sequence over their entire lengths, but are
vastly more different in their RBDs, with 17% RBD divergence between 1984 and 2016 (Figure
1B). We generated lentiviral particles pseudotyped with each spike, and found that all five
supported high infectious titers in cells expressing 229E’s receptor aminopeptidase N (Yeager et
al., 1992) and the activating protease TMPRSS2 (Bertram et al., 2013) (Figure S3). Any major

antigenic evolution by 229E since the 1980s should be captured by differences among these five
spikes.
Neutralizing titers of historical sera drop rapidly against spikes from “future” viruses
To test if the 229E spikes had evolved to escape neutralization by human immunity, we used
historical sera collected from adults between 1985 and 1990. Since the typical person is infected
with 229E every 2–5 years (Aldridge et al., 2020; Edridge et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 1986), many
of these individuals should have been infected with 1984-like viruses within a few years
preceding sera collection. None of the individuals would have been infected with any of the
later viruses, since those viruses did not yet exist at the time of sera collection.
Nearly all sera collected from 1985–1990 had at least some neutralizing activity against
viral particles pseudotyped with the 1984 spike (25 of 27 sera had titers >1:10; Figures S4 and
S5). We focused further analysis on the roughly 30% of sera (8 of 27) that had neutralizing titers
against the 1984 spike of >1:90 (Figure S5). Our reason for focusing on these sera is that their
anti-229E neutralizing titers are comparable to anti-SARS-CoV-2 sera neutralizing titers several
months after recovery from COVID-19 (Crawford et al., 2020a; Wajnberg et al., 2020) or receipt
of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine (Widge et al., 2020).
All sera that potently neutralized virions pseudotyped with the 1984 spike had reduced
titers against more recent spikes (Figure 2A). In some cases, the drop in neutralization of more
recent spikes was dramatic. For instance, serum collected from a 28-year old in 1990 neutralized
the 1984 spike at a titer of 1:125 but did not neutralize the 1992 spike at our limit of detection of
1:10 (Figure 2A). Similarly, serum collected from a 24-year old in 1987 neutralized the 1984
spike at 1:120 but barely neutralized the 1992 spike and did not detectably neutralize spikes
more recent than 1992 (Figure 2A). Only 2 of 8 sera that potently neutralized the 1984 spike
detectably neutralized all subsequent spikes, and only at greatly reduced titers against the most
recent spikes.
To confirm that these results reflect antigenic evolution rather than some unique
neutralization susceptibility of the 1984 spike, we repeated similar experiments using sera
collected from 1992–1995 and initially screening for neutralization of the 1992 spike. Again,
nearly all (18 of 19) sera detectably neutralized the 1992 spike, with about a quarter (5 of 19)
having titers >1:90 (Figures S4 and S5). These potent sera also neutralized the older 1984 spike
with high titers, but again generally had lower activity against spikes from viruses isolated after
the sera were collected (Figure 2B). Together, the results from the two sera collection timeframes
indicate that the 229E spike is evolving antigenically, such that immunity elicited by infection
with prior viruses is often ineffective at neutralizing future viruses.
To quantify the rate of antigenic evolution, for all sera in Figure 2A,B we computed the
drop in neutralization titer against spikes from one and two timepoints later relative to the
contemporaneous spike. The median drop in titer was 4-fold against viruses from 8–9 years in
the future, and >6-fold for viruses 16–17 years in the future (Figure 2C). However, these
medians mask substantial serum-to-serum variation in neutralization of antigenically evolved
future viruses. Neutralization by some sera is eroded >10-fold by just 8–9 years of viral
evolution, whereas neutralization by a few sera is unaffected even by 16–17 years of evolution.

Modern sera neutralize viruses that circulated throughout an individual’s lifetime
The above results show that viral antigenic evolution erodes the capacity of anti-229E immunity
to neutralize the future descendants of the viruses that elicited the immunity. We next
addressed a related question: does serum immunity durably retain the capacity to neutralize
historical 229E strains that an individual was exposed to many years ago?
To address this question, we used modern sera collected in 2020 from children and
adults. The adults were alive during circulation of all five 229E spikes in our panel (i.e., they
were born before 1984), but the children could only have been exposed to the more recent
spikes. We screened 31 modern sera against the 2016 spike, and found that 25 of 31 detectably
neutralized at a threshold of 1:10 (Figures S4 and S5). We again focused further analysis on the
more potent sera with titers >1:90 (7 of 31 sera, Figure S5).
Modern adult sera that potently neutralized the 2016 spike also neutralized all prior
spikes dating back to 1984 (Figure 3). In contrast, the children’s sera neutralized spikes from
viruses that circulated during the children’s lifetimes but often had reduced activity against
spikes from before the children were born (Figure 3). However, neutralization by children’s sera
generally extends further “back in time” to viruses that preceded birth than neutralization by
adult sera in Figure 2A,B extends “forward in time” to viruses that circulated after the sera was
collected. Similar time asymmetry in antigenic evolution has been described for influenza virus
(Sandbulte et al., 2011). Overall, the results in Figure 3 show that neutralizing immunity can
encompass the entire spectrum of spikes an individual has been exposed to, consistent with the
notion that reduced neutralization of future viruses is due to antigenic evolution rather than a
lack of durability in immunity itself.
Much of the antigenic evolution is due to mutations in the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD)
We next sought to identify the region(s) within the 229E spike where mutations drive antigenic
drift. Coronavirus spikes consist of two subunits, S1 and S2, and it is well known that S2 is
relatively conserved whereas S1 is more rapidly evolving (Liò and Goldman, 2004; Tortorici and
Veesler, 2019). The S1 subunit itself consists of several domains, and we were inspired by
several excellent papers by Rini and colleagues to pursue the hypothesis that 229E’s antigenic
drift might be driven by amino-acid substitutions within the three loops in the S1 RBD that bind
the receptor (Li et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2017).
We first calculated the protein sequence variability at each residue across an alignment
of 229E spikes isolated between 1984 and 2019 (Figure 4A). As expected, most sequence
variability was in the S1 subunit, with particularly high variability in the three receptor-binding
loops within the RBD (Figure 4A). However, there was also substantial variability within some
portions of the N-terminal domain (NTD) as well as other parts of the S1 subunit.
To experimentally test the extent that mutations in the RBD explained antigenic
evolution, we created chimeras consisting of the 1984 spike with the RBD replaced by that of
each of the four subsequent spikes. All these RBD-chimeric spikes supported efficient entry by
pseudotyped viral particles (Figure S3). We performed neutralization assays using the chimeric
spikes against the sera from 1985–1990 that potently neutralized the 1984 spike (Figure 4B). For
all sera with neutralizing activity that was rapidly eroded by antigenic evolution, the drops in
titer against more recent spikes were paralleled by drops in titer against the RBD-chimeric

spikes (e.g., 26 and 24-year olds in Figure 4B). However, this trend did not hold for some sera
that were more resistant to antigenic evolution: for instance, serum from the 29-year old did not
neutralize the 2016 spike, but neutralized the chimera with the 2016 RBD (Figure 4B). Overall,
these results suggest that when the neutralizing activity of potent human sera is rapidly eroded
by viral evolution this is often due to mutations within the RBD, but that antigenic evolution
also occurs elsewhere in the spike. In this respect, it is worth noting that while the neutralizing
activity of SARS-CoV-2 immunity elicited by infection primarily targets the RBD (Piccoli et al.,
2020), mutations to the NTD also reduce neutralization by some antibodies and sera (Chi et al.,
2020; Kemp et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; McCarthy et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2019)—and some regions of the NTD undergo significant sequence evolution in 229E (Figure
4A).
Discussion
We have experimentally demonstrated that the spike of a human coronavirus evolves
antigenically with sufficient speed to escape neutralization by many polyclonal human sera
within one to two decades. This finding suggests that one reason that humans are repeatedly
re-infected with seasonal coronaviruses may be that evolution of the viral spike erodes the
immunity elicited by prior infections.
How does the rate of antigenic evolution of 229E compare to that of influenza virus?
Remarkably, we could find no studies that measured how quickly influenza evolution erodes
neutralization by human sera. However, numerous studies examine influenza antigenic
evolution using hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assays with sera from ferrets infected with
single viral strains (Smith et al., 2004). The rate at which 229E escapes neutralization by human
sera is several fold slower than the rate at which influenza A/H3N2 escapes HAI by ferret sera,
but comparable to the rate of such escape by influenza B (Bedford et al., 2014; Neher et al.,
2016). However, the sera of ferrets infected by a single influenza virus strain tend to recognize
fewer viral strains than sera from humans who have been repeatedly infected with many strains
(Fonville et al., 2014, 2016; Li et al., 2013). Therefore, ferret sera HAI may overestimate how
quickly influenza evolution erodes neutralization by actual human sera. For this reason, further
work is needed to enable head-to-head comparisons of antigenic evolution across these viruses.
The rapid antigenic evolution of the 229E spike might seem puzzling given that
coronaviruses have a lower mutation rate than other RNA viruses (Denison et al., 2011; Sanjuán
et al., 2010). But the rate of phenotypic evolution is not equal to mutation rate; evolution also
depends on the effects of mutations and how selection acts on them. These other factors explain
why influenza undergoes rapid antigenic evolution while measles does not, despite having a
similar mutation rate. Specifically, mutations to influenza hemagglutinin are often well
tolerated (Thyagarajan and Bloom, 2014), and single hemagglutinin mutations can have huge
effects on escaping polyclonal sera (Lee et al., 2019). In contrast, measles surface proteins are
less tolerant of mutations (Fulton et al., 2015), and the single mutations that are tolerated never
more than modestly affect measles neutralization by polyclonal sera (Muñoz-Alía et al., 2020).
In these respects, coronaviruses unfortunately seem more similar to influenza than measles. The
neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is often focused on just a small portion of spike
(Barnes et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b; Piccoli et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020), and key

receptor-binding loops are mutationally tolerant in the spikes of both 229E (Li et al., 2019; Wong
et al., 2017) and SARS-CoV-2 (Starr et al., 2020a). Therefore, even though mutations to
coronaviruses occur at a lower rate, they are acted on by selection in a fashion more similar to
influenza than measles (Kistler and Bedford, 2020).
A striking aspect of our results is the extreme person-to-person variation in how rapidly
neutralizing immunity is eroded by the evolution of coronavirus 229E. Some sera that potently
neutralize contemporaneous virus have no detectable activity against viral strains isolated 8+
years later. But other sera maintain neutralizing activity against strains isolated over two
decades later. This finding is reminiscent of how mutations to influenza virus can have vastly
different effects on neutralization by sera from different individuals (Lee et al., 2019).
Identifying what factors determine how rapidly an individual’s coronavirus immunity is
eroded by viral mutations is an important area for future work, as it would obviously be
desirable for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to elicit immunity that is relatively robust to viral evolution.
The biggest question is what our work implies about possible antigenic evolution by
SARS-CoV-2. While it is impossible to know if SARS-CoV-2 will evolve similarly to 229E, it is
ominous that mutations affecting neutralization by antibodies or sera are already present at low
frequencies among circulating SARS-CoV-2 (Greaney et al., 2020; Kemp, 2020; Liu et al., 2020b;
McCarthy et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2020b; Thomson, 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020) even though
most of the human population is still naive and so presumably exerting little immune pressure
on the virus. But two facts provide hope even in light of our observation that human
coronaviruses evolve to escape neutralizing immunity. First, the level of immunity required to
prevent severe COVID-19 may be low (Polack et al., 2020), perhaps because the slower course of
disease provides more time for a recall immune response than for “quicker” viruses such as
influenza. An optimistic interpretation is that disease might often be mild even if viral antigenic
evolution allows re-infections. Second, many leading SARS-CoV-2 vaccines use new
technologies such as mRNA-based delivery (Krammer, 2020) that should make it easy to update
the vaccine if there is antigenic evolution in spike. For this reason, we suggest that SARS-CoV-2
evolution should be monitored for antigenic mutations that might make it advisable to
periodically update vaccines.

Phylogenetic analysis of 229E spikes

ta.yaml​). We also identified a few sequences that were clear outliers on the date-to-tip regression in the
analyses described below, and so are probably mis-annotations; these accessions were excluded (see
https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/blob/master/data/accessions_to_include_exclude
_annotate.yaml​).
We parsed full-length human-isolate spikes encoding unique proteins from this sequence set (see
https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/blob/master/results/get_parse_spikes.md​), used
mafft​ (Katoh and Standley, 2013) to align the protein sequences, and used a custom Python script
(​https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/blob/master/prot_to_codon_alignment.py​) to
build a codon alignment from the protein alignment (File S1). We used GARD (Kosakovsky Pond et al.,
2006; Spielman et al., 2019) to screen for recombination (see tanglegram in Figure S2 and code at
https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/blob/master/results/gard_tanglegram.md​).
The phylogenetic tree topology was inferred using IQ-TREE (Minh et al., 2020) using a
codon-substitution model (Muse and Gaut, 1994) with a transition-transversion ratio and F3X4 empirical
codon frequencies. We then used ​TreeTime​ (Sagulenko et al., 2018) to root the tree (Figure S2) and also
re-scale the branch lengths for the time tree in Figure 1A. The tree images were rendered using ETE 3
(Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016).
To compute the variability at each site in spike (Figure 4A), we used the same alignment as for
the phylogenetic analysis. We then computed the amino-acid variability at each site as the effective
number of amino acids, which is the exponential of the Shannon entropy (Echave and Wilke, 2017). The
domains of spike were annotated using the definitions in (Li et al., 2019), which are provided at

Plasmids encoding 229E spikes and RBD chimeras
The protein sequences of the spikes used in the experiments are in File S2. We deleted the last 19 amino
acids of the spike’s C-terminus (in the cytoplasmic tail) as this modification has been reported (Crawford
et al., 2020a; Kawase et al., 2009; Rogers et al., 2020) and validated in our hands (Figure S3) to improve
titers of virions pseudotyped with spike. For the 1984, 1992, 2001, 2008, and 2016 spikes, the protein
sequence matches the Genbank sequences for these viral strains (Figure 1A and File S1) except for the tail
deletion. For the RBD chimeras, we annotated domains of spike as in (Li et al., 2019); see
https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/blob/master/data/AAK32191_hand_annotated.g
p​. We then designed the RBD-chimera proteins by replacing the RBD of the 1984 spike with the RBD of
each of the 1992, 2001, 2008, and 2016 spikes.
We designed human-codon-optimized gene sequences encoding each of these spike proteins
using the tool provided by Integrated DNA Technologies, had the genes synthesized commercially, and
cloned them into a CMV-driven expression plasmid. Genbank sequences of the resulting plasmids are at
https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/tree/master/exptl_data/plasmid_maps​. The
names of the plasmids are listed below (note how the names include “delta19” or “d19” to indicate the
C-terminal deletion as well as the year for that viral strain and whether it is a chimera; note also that we
created a plasmid for the 2016 spike that did not have the C-terminal deletion for the experiments in
Figure S3 that validated the benefits of the deletion):

Generation and titering of 229E spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles encoding luciferase and ZsGreen
We generated spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles using the same approach that we have recently
described for SARS-CoV-2 (Crawford et al., 2020a, 2020b). This approach involves creating pseudotyped
lentiviral particles by transfecting cells with a plasmid expressing spike, a plasmid expressing a lentiviral
backbone encoding luciferase and ZsGreen, and plasmids expressing the other lentiviral proteins
necessary for virion formation (Crawford et al., 2020a, 2020b). The only modifications for this study are
that we used the plasmids expressing the 229E spike described above rather than plasmids expressing the
SARS-CoV-2 spike, and that after producing the pseudotyped lentiviral particles we infected them into
target cells engineered to be infectable by the 229E spike.
Specifically, the 229E spike binds to human aminopeptidase N (APN) to initiate viral entry
(Yeager et al., 1992). To make 293T cells infectable by 229E, we therefore transiently transfected them with
an APN protein expression plasmid (SinoBiological, NM_001150.2) prior to seeding the cells for infection.
To further promote lentiviral infection, we simultaneously transiently transfected them with a plasmid
encoding transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which facilitates 229E-spike mediated viral entry
by cleaving and activating the spike (Bertram et al., 2013). We used the TMPRSS2-expressing plasmid
pHAGE2_EF1aInt_TMPRSS2_IRES_mCherry (Lee et al., 2018).
For titering the spike-pseudotyped particles in these cells, we used the following procedure. To
mitigate any possible well-to-well differences in transfection efficiency in a 96-well plate format, we first
bulk transfected a dish of 293T cells, followed by seeding the 96-well plates routinely used in
neutralization assays and viral titering. Specifically, an approximately 90% confluent 10 cm dish of 293T
cells was transfected with 8.5 µg APN-expressing plasmid, 1 µg of TMPRSS2-expressing plasmid, and 0.5
µg of carrier DNA (Promega, E4881) to achieve an 8.5:1 ratio of APN:TMPRSS2. We found that this ratio
gave sufficient TMPRSS2 expression, while maintaining low levels of cell toxicity. Cells were transfected
using the Bioland Scientific BioT transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol but
incubating transfection complexes for 15 minutes at room temperature instead of the recommended 5
minutes as we have anecdotally observed that this extended incubation increases transfection efficiency.
After 5–6 hours, transfection supernatant was removed and the APN and TMPRSS2-transfected 293T cells
were trypsinized (Fisher, MT25053CI). Cells were then seeded in clear bottom, black-walled,
poly-L-lysine coated 96-well plates that were either professionally pre-coated (Greiner, 655936) or
hand-coated (Greiner, 655090) with poly-L-lysine solution (Millipore Sigma, P4704) at 1.75x10e4 cells per
well in 50 µL D10 growth media (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin). Plates were incubated at 37℃ with 5% CO​2​ for 20–24 hours, and
cells were infected with serial 2-fold serial dilutions of the pseudotyped lentiviral particles. These viral
dilutions were made in TC-treated “set-up” 96-well plates and then transferred to the pre-seeded
293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells from the previous day.
Approximately 50–52 hours later, we quantified infection by reading the luminescence signal
produced from the luciferase encoded in the lentiviral backbone. Specifically, 100 µL of media in each
well was removed—while being sure to leave the cells undisturbed—leaving approximately 30 µL of
media left over. Then an equal volume of Bright-Glo reagent (Promega, E2610) was added to the
remaining 30 uL of media in each well and the solution was mixed up and down to ensure complete cell
lysis. In order to minimize the potential for premature luciferase excitation, special care was taken to
protect the assay plates from light. Mainly, assay plate preparation was performed in a biosafety hood
with the lights off and plates were covered in tin foil after the addition of the luciferase reagent. The

luminescence was then measured on a TECAN Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader with no attenuation and a
luminescence integration time of 1 s. Figure S3 shows the titers achieved for each 229E spike variant, and
also demonstrates the importance of the spike cytoplasmic tail deletion and the expression of APN and
TMPRSS2 for efficient viral infection. Note that for one panel in Figure S3, we instead determined the titer
by using flow cytometry to detect the fraction of cells expressing the ZsGreen also encoded in the
lentiviral backbone.
Human sera
All sera used in this study, along with relevant metadata (e.g., collection date, patient age, and the
measured neutralization titer against each assayed virus) are listed in File S3, which is also available at
https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/blob/master/exptl_data/results/all_neut_titers.cs
v​.
Most of the historical human sera from the 1980s and 1990s are identified by the prefix SD in File
S3 (e.g., SD85_1). These sera were obtained from the Infectious Disease​ Sciences Biospecimen Repository
at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division (VIDD) of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in
Seattle, WA, and were collected from prospective bone marrow donors with approval from the Human
Subjects Institutional Review Board​. A few of the historical sera are residual samples obtained from
Bloodworks Northwest that were collected from adults in Seattle; these sera are identified by the prefix
FH in File S3 (e.g., ​FH007TR). ​A few of the sera were collected from subjects with exact ages that were
unknown, but were adults old enough to have been alive in 1984 (the isolation year of the first spike in
our panel).
The modern children’s sera from 2020 are identified by the prefix POP_ in File S3 (e.g.,
POP_0007), and are residual sera collected at Seattle Children’s Hospital in Seattle, WA, in March of 2020
with approval from the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board​. Each of these serum samples is from
a unique individual who was confirmed to be seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 by an anti-RBD ELISA
(Dingens et al., 2020).
The modern adult sera from 2020 are identified by the prefix AUSAB (e.g., AUSAB-01) in File S3,
and are residual sera from University of Washington Lab Medicine that were collected for testing for
HBsAb (for which they tested negative).
For a negative control, we used serum from a goat that had not been infected with the 229E
human coronavirus; namely WHO goat serum (FR-1377) procured from the International Reagent
Resource.
All sera were heat inactivated prior to use by incubation at 56℃ for approximately 30 minutes.
Neutralization assays
The 293T cells used for our neutralization assays were transfected to express APN and TMPRSS2 and
seeded as for the viral titering described above. The neutralization assays were set up at 20–24 hours after
seeding of the cells into 96-well plates. First, the heat-inactivated serum samples were diluted 1:10 in D10
growth media followed by 3-fold serial dilutions in TC-coated 96-well “set-up” plates, ultimately giving
seven total dilutions per sample. These dilutions were done in duplicate for each serum sample. Each
229E spike-pseudotyped lentivirus was then diluted to achieve luciferase readings of approximately
200,000 RLUs per well (the exact dilution factor varied among viruses due to differences in titers; see
Figure S3). An equal volume of virus was then added to each well of the virus plus sera “set-up” plates,
and these plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37℃ with 5% CO​2​, after which 100 uL of each virus plus
sera mixture were transferred to the 293T-APN-TMPRSS2 cell plate that had been seeded the day prior.
Plates were incubated at 37℃ with 5% CO​2​ for approximately 50-52 hours, and then the luciferase signal
was read as described above for viral titering.

Each neutralization plate contained a column of positive control wells consisting of cells plus
virus incubated with D10 media but no sera, and a negative control consisting of virus but no cells (we
also confirmed that using a cells-only negative control gave similar results). The fraction infectivity was
computed at each serum dilution as the fraction of the signal for the positive control (averaged across the
two positive control wells for each row) after subtracting the background reading for the negative control.
We then fit 2-parameter Hill curves with baselines fixed to 1 and 0 using neutcurve
(​https://jbloomlab.github.io/neutcurve/​). Note that the serum concentration reported in these curves is the
concentration at which the virus was pre-incubated with the sera for 1 hour. All of the neutralization
curves are plotted in Figure S4. All of the IC50s are tabulated in File S3. See
https://github.com/jbloomlab/CoV_229E_antigenic_drift/tree/master/exptl_data​ for raw and processed
plate reader data and all of the computer code used for the fitting. Note that all assays were done in
duplicate, but some sera-virus pairs have additional readings as we re-ran selected sera-virus pairs to
confirm that results remained consistent across different assay days. In all cases the day-to-day
consistency was good, and the reported values are the mean IC50s across all assays.

serum was collected. Box plots show the median and interquartile range, and each point is the
fold change for a single serum. For a few sera (triangles), the fold change is censored (as an
upper bound) because the titer against the future virus was below the limit of detection.

Figure 4. ​Antigenic evolution is primarily due to changes in the spike’s receptor binding
domain (RBD). (A) At top is a schematic of the 229E spike. Within the S1 subunit, the schematic
indicates the N-terminal domain (NTD, also known as S1-A) and the RBD (also known as S1-B).
The three loops in the RBD that bind the virus’s APN receptor are indicated (Li et al., 2019).
Below the schematic is a plot of sequence variability across the alignment of 229E spikes in
Figure 1A. Variability is quantified as the effective number of amino acids at a site (Echave and
Wilke, 2017), with a value of one indicating complete conservation and larger values indicating
more sequence variability. (B) Neutralizing titers of sera collected between 1985 and 1990

Figure S2. ​Although there is some evidence of recombination among closely related 229E
spikes, this recombination does not alter the relative phylogenetic relationships among the
spikes used in the experiments. Specifically, GARD (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006; Spielman et
al., 2019) was used to analyze the same set of 229E spike sequences used in Figure 1 with a
nucleotide substitution model and three gamma-distributed rate classes. The best-fitting model
had a single recombination breakpoint at nucleotide 1089 that improved the AIC by 60 units.
The trees for each partition were then rooted and branch-re-scaled using TreeTime (Sagulenko
et al., 2018), and the resulting tanglegram was rendered using dendextend (Galili, 2015). As can
be seen above, the recombination is all between closely related sequences and does not alter the
relative position of the 1984, 1992, 2001, 2008, and 2016 spikes used in the experiments. See

efficiently infect 293T cells expressing the spike’s receptor aminopeptidase N (APN) and the
activating protease TMPRSS2. (A) Titer in transduction units per ml as determined using flow
cytometry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the full-length 2016 spike or that spike with a
deletion of the last 19 residues in spike (the end of the cytoplasmic tail) on 293T cells transfected
with a plasmid expressing APN. The dotted gray line is the limit of detection, and the titers in
the absence of spike were below this line (undetectable). (B) Efficient entry by the pseudotyped
virions depends on expression of APN and to a lesser extent TMPRSS2. Virions pseudotyped
with the 2016 spike with the C-terminal deletion were infected into 293T cells transfected with
plasmids expressing one or both of APN and TMPRSS2, and titers were determined by
luciferase luminescence. Titers are normalized to one. (C) All of the 229E spikes and chimeras
used in this study mediated efficient viral entry. Lentiviral particles were pseudotyped with the
indicated spike (in all cases with the C-terminal deletion) and titers were determined using
luciferase luminescence on 293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing APN and TMPRSS2.

that were then used for the rest of the studies described in the paper. Each sera was tested
against the most-recent virus isolated prior to the serum collection date: in other words, sera
collected between 1985–1990 was tested against the 1984 spike, sera collected between
1992–1995 was tested against the 1992 spike, and sera collected in 2020 was tested against the
2016 spike. Each point shows the neutralizing titer for a different serum (see Figure S4 for full
neutralization curves). Sera above the cutoff of 1:90 (blue dashed line) was then used for further
studies against the full panel of viruses (e.g., Figures 2, 3, and 4). The numbers at the top of the
plot indicate the number of sera above the cutoff out of the total sera tested in each timeframe.
