Abstract
New strains of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged, including B.1.351 and P.1, that demonstrate increased transmissibility and the
potential of rendering current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines less effective. A concern is that existing SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit
vaccines produce neutralizing antibodies to three dimensional spike epitopes that are subject to change during viral drift. Here
we provide an initial report on the hypothesis that adaptive T cell based immunity may provide a path for a pan-COVID-19
vaccine that is resilient to viral drift. T cell based adaptive immunity can be based on short peptide sequences selected from
the viral proteome that are less subject to drift, and can utilize multiple such epitopes to provide redundancy in the event of
drift. We find that SARS-CoV-2 peptides contained in a mRNA-LNP T cell vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 are immunogenic in mice
transgenic for the human HLA-A*02:01 gene. We plan to test the efficacy of this vaccine with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 challenge
trials with HLA-A*02:01 mice.

1 Introduction

23

Concern has been raised by the observations that new strains of SARS-CoV-2 are more transmissible (Davies et al., 2021;
Tegally et al., 2021), and observed spike variants tested as pseudoviruses are more resilient to neutralization by sera produced
by spike subunit vaccines (Liu et al., 2021b; Wu et al., 2021), and more resilient to neutralization by convalescent sera (Wibmer
et al., 2021). The ultimate clinical implications of these findings are at present unclear, but they have motivated a search for
vaccination methods that are resilient to new strains of SARS-CoV-2.
We hypothesize that an alternative to vaccine-induced antibody-based viral neutralization is the production of a robust
cellular immune response to protect an individual against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have proposed T cell
vaccines that are predicted to produce both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses (Liu et al., 2020, 2021a), and here we present the
initial immunogenic evaluation of such a vaccine in a HLA-A*02:01 human transgenic mouse model.

2.1 Vaccine peptide selection
MHC Class I Eight peptides from SARS-CoV-2 were selected as a subset of the MHC class I de novo MIRA only vaccine
design of Liu et al. (2021a). We filtered this set of 36 peptides to the 8 peptides predicted to be displayed by HLA-A*02:01 by
a combined MIRA and machine learning model of peptide-HLA immunogenicity (Liu et al., 2021a). The combined model
predicts which HLA molecule displayed a peptide that was observed to be immunogenic in a MIRA experiment, and uses
machine learning predictions of peptide display for HLA alleles not observed or peptides not tested in MIRA data. Thus, all
eight MHC class I peptides in our vaccine were previously observed to be immunogenic in data from convalescent COVID-19
patients (Liu et al., 2021a; Snyder et al., 2020). We further validated that all peptides are predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01
with high (≤ 50 nM) affinity using the NetMHCpan-4.1 (Reynisson et al., 2020) and MHCflurry 2.0 (O’Donnell et al., 2020)
machine learning models. For inclusion in the assembled construct, the eight vaccine peptides were randomly shuffled, and
alternate peptides were flanked with five additional amino acids at each terminus as originally flanked in the SARS-CoV-2
proteome.
We selected two additional peptides from the MIRA only vaccine design as negative controls that were not predicted to be

immunogenic in HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice, including by endogenous C57BL/6 mouse model MHC alleles (H-2-Kb and

Three peptides from SARS-CoV-2 were optimized for predicted binding to H-2-IAb. We scored all SARS-CoV2 peptides of length 13–25 using the sliding window approach of Liu et al. (2020) and a machine learning ensemble that outputs
the mean predicted binding affinity (IC50) of NetMHCIIpan-4.0 (Reynisson et al., 2020) and PUFFIN (Zeng and Gifford,
2019). We selected the top three peptides by predicted binding affinity using a greedy selection strategy with a minimum edit
distance constraint of 5 (Liu et al., 2021a) between peptides to avoid selecting overlapping windows. All three peptides were
flanked with an additional five amino acids per terminus from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.
Table 1 shows the start and end amino acid positions of each peptide in
its origin gene, including flanking residues for flanked vaccine peptides. For SARS-CoV-2, peptides are aligned to reference
proteins in UniProt (Consortium, 2019) (UniProt IDs: P0DTC2 (S), P0DTC3 (ORF3a), P0DTC5 (M), P0DTC9 (N), P0DTD1
(ORF1ab)). We note that none of the SARS-CoV-2 peptides included in this vaccine were found to be mutated in the B.1.1.7,
B.1.351, or P.1 SARS-CoV-2 variants (Rambaut et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2021; Tegally et al., 2021; Faria et al., 2021).
Suitability for Protection Against Novel Variants

2.2 Construct design
Vaccine peptides were joined into a single polypeptide construct for mRNA-LNP delivery. Peptides were prepended with a
secretion signal sequence at the N-terminus and followed by an MHC class I trafficking signal (MITD) at the C-terminus (Kreiter
et al., 2008; Sahin et al., 2017), and joined by non-immunogenic glycine/serine linkers from Sahin et al. (2017). The construct
also included positive control peptides previously shown to be immunogenic in HLA-A*02:01 and H-2-IAb mouse models
(CMV pp65: NLVPMVATV for HLA-A*02:01 and Human CD74: KPVSKMRMATPLLMQAL for H-2-IAb). The assembled
vaccine construct for our mouse experiments is shown in Figure 1.
Codon optimization for mouse expression of the vaccine construct was performed using the IDT Codon Optimization Tool
(Integrated DNA Technologies), and the resulting nucleic acid sequence is provided in Figure S1.

2.3 mRNA-LNP vaccine formulation
RNA was synthesized by Trilink Biotechnologies as a modified mRNA transcript with full substitution of 5-Methoxy-U, capped
(Cap 1) using CleanCap® AG and polyadenylated (120A). RNA containing lipid nanoparticles were prepared by dropwise
adding an ethanol solution containing the mixture of active lipidoid, cholesterol (Chol), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC),
and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG) at defined weight ratio to 25 mM sodium
acetate solution. The Lipid : Cholesterol : DSPC : DMG-PEG weight rations were ALC-0315 16:7.44:3.35:1.86, Lipid
Tufts-113 16:4.76:3:2.4. The mixed solution was then dialyzed using Thermo Scientific™ Slide-A-Lyzer™ MINI Dialysis
Device (3.5K MWCO) to obtain the blank LNPs. The LNP/mRNA for vaccination was prepared by mixing 150 µg of blank
LNP with 10 µg of mRNA.
2.4 Vaccine administration
A total of nine HLA-A*02:01 human transgenic mice (Jackson Laboratories Number 003475) were used. Three mice were
unvaccinated controls, three mice were vaccinated with RNA formulated with the ALC-0315 lipid, and three mice were
vaccinated with the same RNA formulated with the Tufts-113 lipid. The mice received their prime vaccination at Day 0
and a boost vaccination at Day 21. Each vaccination consisted of 100 µL of mRNA-LNP containing 10 µg of RNA injected
subcutaneously at the base of the tail. Mice were sacrificed 14 days after the boost vaccination, and spleens were collected for
ELISpot assay.

Table 1. Immunogenicity of vaccine peptides. MHC class, ELISpot query peptide, control, peptide source, ELISpot wells,
fraction of mice with positive ELISpot results out of 3, fraction of convalescent patients immunogenic for peptide (MIRA and
MCMT). mRNA-LNP vaccines were formulated with either LNP-1 (ALC-0315) or LNP-2 (Tufts-113). Start and end values
indicate peptide positions in the specified gene, including flanking residues if the peptide was flanked in the vaccine construct
(see Methods). Two MHC class II vaccine peptides were not tested for immunogenicity during ELISpot. MIRA and MCMT are
the fraction of convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients that had an immunogenic response to each peptide in either a Multiplex
Identification of T-cell Receptor Antigen Specificity (MIRA) assay (Snyder et al., 2020) or by mass cytometry–based
multiplexed tetramer staining (MCMT) (Kared et al., 2021).

2.5 ELISpot analysis
Splenocytes were isolated, and 5 × 105 splenocytes were placed in each well of a 96-well plate. Query peptides were obtained
from GenScript at ≥ 95% purity. Query peptides were added at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, and the cell peptide mixture was
incubated for 16 hours. Detection of interferon gamma positive spots was performed with a Cellular Technologies Limited CTL
S6 FluoroSpot reader, and analyzed with ImmunoSpot 5.1.36 software.

2.6 MIRA and MCMT data analysis
Selected peptides were tested by other studies for their immunogenicity in convalescent COVID-19 patients whose HLA type
included HLA-A*02:01. The study by Snyder et al. (2020) included 80 HLA-A*02:01 convalescent COVID-19 patients and
tested peptides individually or in small pools with the Multiplex Identification of T-cell Receptor Antigen Specificity (MIRA)
assay. Query peptides were first filtered to only consider those with predicted HLA-A*02:01 binding affinity ≤ 25 nM. The
MIRA fraction in Table 1 is the number of individuals positive for a pool containing a query peptide divided by 80. The Kared
et al. (2021) study evaluated 16 HLA-A*02:01 convalescent COVID-19 patient by mass cytometry–based multiplexed tetramer
(MCMT) staining. The MCMT fraction in Table 1 is the number of individuals positive for a query peptide divided by 16.

We tested the Figure 1 mRNA vaccine design and found that three vaccine SARS-CoV-2 peptides and the two control peptides
were immunogenic (Table 1). The lack of normalization standards did not permit statistical analysis of the faction of T cells
that were activated, or the difference, if any, of immunogenicity induced by mRNA-LNP 1 (ALC-0315) and mRNA-LNP 2
(Tufts-113). All positive control peptides were immunogenic. ELISpot wells corresponding to the data in Table 1 can be found
for the control group, vaccine mRNA-LNP 1, and vaccine mRNA-LNP 2 in Figures S2, S3, and S4, respectively. The best
ELISpot results from Group 2 (LNP 1, ALC-0315 formulated vaccine) are shown in Figure 2.

While we found two SARS-CoV-2 MHC class I peptides to be immunogenic, one highly so, five MHC class I peptides were
not observed to be immunogenic in this study despite being immunogenic in certain HLA-A*02:01 convalescent COVID-19
patients. The lack of immunogenicity for these five peptides could be possibly a result of (1) incomplete processing of
vaccine peptides in mouse HLA transgenics, as noted for other nucleic acid vaccines (Street et al., 2002), (2) the very high
immunogenicity of YLYALVYFL may have competed against the immunogenicity of other peptides, (3) limitations in the T
cell repertoire in the inbred HLA-A*02:01 mouse strains, and (4) the vaccine construct we created is too long for the vaccine

to be optimally effective. However, we note that peptides both at the beginning and end of the construct were found to be
immunogenic.
The observed immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides YLYALVYFL and TVYSHLLLV (MHC class I), as well as
PLYAFASEAARVVRSI (MHC class II) suggests that the vaccine may provide protection against high titers of SARS-CoV-2
viral infection.
