Abstract

25

The global COVID-19 pandemic has sparked intense interest in the rapid development of

26

vaccines as well as animal models to evaluate vaccine candidates and to define immune correlates

27

of protection. We recently reported a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus strain (MA10) with the

28

potential to infect wild-type laboratory mice, driving high levels of viral replication in respiratory

29

tract tissues as well as severe clinical and respiratory symptoms, aspects of COVID-19 disease in

30

humans that are important to capture in model systems. We evaluated the immunogenicity and

31

protective efficacy of novel rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vaccines against MA10

32

challenge in mice. Baseline seroprevalence is lower for rhesus adenovirus vectors than for human

33

or chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, making these vectors attractive candidates for vaccine

34

development. We observed that RhAd52 vaccines elicited robust binding and neutralizing

35

antibody titers, which inversely correlated with viral replication after challenge. These data support

36

the development of RhAd52 vaccines and the use of the MA10 challenge virus to screen novel

37

vaccine candidates and to study the immunologic mechanisms that underscore protection from

38

SARS-CoV-2 challenge in wild-type mice.

We have developed a series of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using rhesus adenovirus serotype 52

(RhAd52) vectors, which exhibits a lower seroprevalence than human and chimpanzee vectors,

43

supporting their development as novel vaccine vectors or as an alternative Ad vector for boosting.

44

We sought to test these vaccines using a recently reported mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10)

virus to i) evaluate the protective efficacy of RhAd52 vaccines and ii) further characterize this

mouse-adapted challenge model and probe immune correlates of protection. We demonstrate

47

RhAd52 vaccines elicit robust SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses and protect against

48

clinical disease and viral replication in the lungs. Further, binding and neutralizing antibody titers

49

correlated with protective efficacy. These data validate the MA10 mouse model as a useful tool to

50

screen and study novel vaccine candidates, as well as the development of RhAd52 vaccines for

51

COVID-19.

Introduction

54

A critical component of the evaluation of vaccine candidates for COVID-19 has been the

55

development of pre-clinical challenge models. Transgenic mice [1-5], hamsters [6-9], and non-

56

human primates [10-12] have been shown to support viral replication and, to varying degrees,

57

clinical disease following infection with SARS-CoV-2 [13]. We recently described a mouse-

58

adapted virus (MA10) to enable challenge of standard, wild-type laboratory mice and recapitulate

59

several key features of human disease, such as viral replication in respiratory tract tissues and

60

severe infection-associated weight loss [14]. This model has been explored to evaluate small

61

molecule antivirals and candidate monoclonal antibodies for prophylactic or therapeutic

62

applications, as well as prototype vaccine candidates [14-17]. For example, initial studies using

63

viral replicon particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein demonstrate the capacity of

64

vaccines to restrain MA10 infection and disease [14].

65

This model has not yet been utilized to study the characteristics of vaccine-elicited immune

66

responses that protect against clinical disease and viral replication. Thus, we sought to test a series

67

of candidate rhesus adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) [18] vector-based vaccines expressing

68

engineered versions of SARS-CoV-2 Spike. RhAd52 vectors have lower seroprevalence in human

69

populations than Ad26 vectors, which recently received FDA Emergency Use Authorization as a

COVID-19 vaccine [19, 20]. We aimed to probe correlates of protection, including whether similar

71

immune parameters such as neutralizing antibody titers emerge in the mouse model as predictors

72

of challenge outcome, as has been observed in hamsters and nonhuman primates [9, 10, 21]. These

73

data will inform applications of the MA10 virus to study key questions about clinical disease,

74

infection, or both.

Results

77

Immunogenicity of RhAd52 vectors

78

We designed a series of replication incompetent viral vector vaccines using rhesus

79

adenovirus serotype 52 (RhAd52) vectors [18, 22] that encode variations of the SARS-CoV-2

80

Spike (S) protein (Fig 1A). Similar to our previous reports with human adenovirus serotype 26

81

(Ad26) vectors [9, 23, 24], inserts included: i) unmodified S, ii) truncations of the cytoplasmic tail

82

(S.dCT) or the transmembrane region (S.dTM), or iii) select fragments, including the S1 domain

83

and the receptor binding domain (RBD). In some cases, immunogens were modified with mutation

84

of the furin cleavage site and the addition of proline mutations to stabilize protein prefusion

85

conformation (PP) [25-27]. To explore the potential of candidate RhAd52 vaccines to elicit

86

humoral immune responses, groups of wild-type BALB/c mice were immunized with 109 viral

87

particles (VPs) of these vaccines via the intramuscular route (Fig 1B). Peripheral blood was

88

collected on a biweekly basis to monitor antibody responses in serum.

89

At week 2 following the initial immunization, 100% of mice immunized with RhAd52

90

vaccines, irrespective of the immunogen insert, exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-specific binding

91

antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig 1C). These responses generally

92

increased over the time frame of 2-8 weeks post-prime. At week 8, RBD-specific binding

93

responses were also observed in 100% of mice immunized with RhAd52 candidates (Fig 1D).

94

Furthermore, antibody function was assessed using in vitro assays to quantify the potential to

95

neutralize either a pseudotyped virus [10, 28, 29] (Fig 1E) or live SARS-CoV-2 virus [10, 28, 30,

96

31] (Fig 1F). Similar to the binding results, neutralizing titers were elicited by several of the

97

RhAd52 candidate vaccines, with the lowest responses observed following immunization with the

98

S1 domain insert, in which a subset of mice exhibited no detectable neutralizing responses at week

99

8. Mice received a second identical dose of the respective RhAd52 vectors at week 8. Two weeks

100

following the boost immunization, median S-specific ELISA titers were found to increase by

101

approximately 10-fold for all the vaccine candidates (Fig 1G). These data demonstrate the

102

immunogenicity of a homologous boost with a second immunization of a RhAd52 vector.

103

We next designed a series of immunization regimens that we hypothesized would i) allow

104

direct comparison of protective efficacy of single-shot versus two-dose prime-boost schedules, and

105

ii) generate a range of binding and neutralizing antibody responses that could enable analyses of

106

correlates of protection following challenge [21, 24, 28]. Briefly, groups of mice were immunized

107

with a prime and a matched boost with the seven candidate RhAd52 vaccines, as in Fig 1B. At the

108

time of boost (i.e., week 8), additional groups of mice were immunized with a single dose of select

109

vaccines, RhAd52.S, RhAd52.S.dCT, and RhAd52.S.PP. At week 12, serum was collected to

110

assess antibody responses prior to viral challenge. Expansion of S-specific (Fig 2A) and RBD-

111

specific (Fig 2B) binding antibody titers was again observed in all vaccinated mice. Groups of

112

mice that received the two-dose regimens exhibited approximately one-log higher median titers

113

compared with groups administered a single immunization. Furthermore, consistent with our

114

previous data using a DNA vaccination platform in non-human primates [28], the S1 insert drove

115

the lowest binding responses.

116

In evaluating neutralizing antibody activity elicited by these vaccine regimens, similar

117

patterns were observed with pseudovirus (Fig 2C) and live virus (Fig 2D) assays. Among the

118

groups administered prime-boost dosing schedules, high neutralizing antibody titers were

119

observed across all vaccines with the exception of the S1 immunogen, for which 50%

120

neutralization titer (NT50) values were below the assay limit of detection for several mice. Groups

121

that received only one dose of select inserts exhibited lower neutralizing titers compared with

122

boosted mice, with detectable responses in a subset of mice that, on average, were approximately

123

one log lower than the boosted groups that received full length or truncated (e.g., S.dCT) vaccines.

124

As consistent trends were observed across binding and neutralizing titers in the relative magnitude

125

of responses elicited by various candidate vaccines, correlation analyses were performed to assess

126

the relationship between these immunologic readouts (Fig 2E). Highly significant (P<0.0001,

127

Spearman correlation) strong positive correlations were observed between binding ELISA titers to

128

S and RBD proteins and capacity to neutralize either pseudovirus or live SARS-CoV-2 virus.

129
130

Protective efficacy of RhAd52 vector vaccines against MA10 challenge

131

At week 12, all groups of mice were challenged to evaluate whether vaccine-elicited

132

responses protected from clinical disease and viral replication in this mouse-adapted model [14].

133

Vaccinated mice were challenged on day 0 with 104 PFU SARS-CoV-2 MA10 via the intranasal

134

route (Fig 3A). Half of the mice were followed through day 4 post-challenge and body weight was

135

monitored daily for signs of clinical disease. At the terminal time point, lung tissue was collected,

136

and outgrowth assays were performed to quantify replication-competent virus (i.e., plaque forming

137

units (PFU) in this key respiratory tract tissue. In parallel, half of the mice were sacrificed at day

138

2 post-challenge to measure virus in the lungs. We hypothesized this approach would allow

139

evaluation of the potential to restrain clinical symptoms of disease as well as enable a virologic

140

endpoint at the time of typical peak viral load (i.e., day 2 post-challenge).

141

As expected, the sham control group exhibited significant weight loss following MA10

142

challenge, with a median loss of 15.2% of body weight at day 4 post-challenge (Fig 3B-3C). All

143

vaccine regimens provided robust protection from clinical signs of infection in terms of body

144

weights (P<0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test), with body

145

weight generally remaining stable irrespective of the RhAd52 insert or whether a single or two-

146

dose vaccine regimen was employed. Analyses of lungs revealed differences in the level of

147

replication-competent virus detected in respiratory tract tissues among mice largely protected from

148

weight loss (Fig 4A). In sham control mice at day 2 post-challenge, high levels of virus were

149

recovered from lung, with a median titer of 3.1 x 107 PFU/lung (Fig 4B). In contrast, two-dose

150

regimens with full-length (i.e., S, S.PP) or truncated (i.e., S.dCT, S.dTM, S.dTM.PP) S

151

immunogens provided a dramatic reduction in viral titer, with a greater than a 6 log drop in median

152

titer. In nearly all mice in these groups, no replication competent virus was recovered from the

153

lungs (i.e., PFU<100/lung). Immunization with two doses of the S fragment immunogens –

154

RhAd52.S1 and RhAd52.RBD – restrained the level of virus in the lung, with a median titer of 3.9

155

x 105 and 5.0 x 103 PFU/lung, respectively. Similarly, in the single-shot groups, RhAd52.S and

156

RhAd52.S.dCT provided significant but incomplete protection, reducing the viral burden in the

157

lung to 3.3 x 102 and 1.0 x 104 PFU/lung, respectively. Finally, a single shot of RhAd52.S.PP

158

dramatically reduced viral load, with no detectable viral outgrowth from lung tissues in 100% of

159

mice. Of note, the S.PP insert previously proved optimal in nonhuman primates [24] and was

160

advanced into clinical trials [19, 20].

161

Similar analyses at day 4 revealed the level of virus in lung tissue was several logs lower

162

(median 4.4 x 104 PFU/lung) than at day 2 post-challenge (Fig 4C), consistent with our previous

163

finding that tissue viral loads peak at day 1-2 post-challenge and gradually resolve over

164

approximately 7 days [14]. Across vaccine regimens, virus levels were largely below the limit of

165

detection of the outgrowth assay, with low levels observed in a subset of mice in the RhAd52.S

166

and RhAd52.S1 two-dose groups. Together, these data suggest that all vaccines led to a reduction

167

in respiratory tract tissue viral loads at the typical peak of infection as well as significantly

168

decreased the persistence of virus in the lungs.

169
170

Exploration of immune correlates of protection

171

We next evaluated possible correlations between vaccine-elicited immune responses prior

172

to challenge and peak viral levels following challenge. A highly significant (P<0.0001) correlation

173

was observed between pre-challenge S ELISA titers and peak (i.e., day 2) lung PFU (Fig 4D).

174

Furthermore, the resulting Spearman correlation coefficient (R=-0.7499) suggests a strong inverse

175

relationship between pre-challenge binding antibody levels and virologic outcome post-challenge.

176

Similar highly significant (P<0.0001) inverse correlations were observed between three additional

177

pre-challenge immunologic metrics and viral replication in the lung: i) RBD ELISA titers (R=-

178

0.7234), ii) pseudovirus neutralization titers (R=-0.7446, and iii) live virus neutralization titers

179

(R=-0.7744). Together, these data suggest that multiple vaccine-elicited humoral immune

180

responses are inversely correlated with viral replication in respiratory tract tissue following MA10

181

SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

182

Discussion
Our data indicate that RhAd52 vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 S antigens elicit robust

185

and protective humoral immune responses in mice. Based on baseline seroprevalence as well as

186

the expanded global use of Ad5, Ad26, and ChAdOx1 vaccines [19, 20, 32-35], developing

187

additional adenoviral vectors for COVID-19 vaccines is critical. This approach could be important

188

for developing future boosting vectors or to tune the innate immune signatures induced [36].

189

Similar to our recent reports in hamsters [9], non-human primates [24, 28], and humans [19], a

190

robust correlation was observed between binding and neutralizing antibody responses.

191

Furthermore, although single-shot vaccines were highly protective, we observed increased

192

immune responses using a homologous prime-boost strategy. In particular, the expansion of

193

neutralizing antibody responses, as measured by both pseudovirus and live virus assays, in mice

194

is encouraging, as this metric has emerged as a potential correlate of protection in hamster and

195

non-human primate challenge models [9, 10, 21, 24, 28].

196

Importantly, the MA10 virus has previously been shown to drive significant clinical disease

197

(i.e., weight loss) as well as replication localized in respiratory tract tissues, characteristics of

198

interest for modeling severe COVID-19 disease. In contrast, nonhuman primate models for

199

COVID-19 generally do not develop severe clinical disease [10-13]. The MA10 mouse model has

200

proven useful for screening candidate therapeutics, but it remains relatively unexplored for testing

201

vaccines [14-17]. The results from our challenge studies using RhAd52 vaccines suggest that

202

candidate vaccines significantly protected against clinical disease and virus replication in lung

203

tissue. However, only select immunization regimens drove full suppression of replicating virus in

204

the lungs, as measured by viral outgrowth assays. Moreover, our data show that the recently-

205

reported mouse-adapted virus MA10 exhibits robust humoral immune correlates of vaccine

206

protection [9, 10, 21], which will prove useful in future studies of vaccines and other interventions

207

using this model.

208

Future studies could further explore mechanistic correlates of protection, such as defining

209

how vaccine candidates tune systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion typically triggered by

210

viral infection, as well as exploring the role of T cell responses in the context of MA10 challenge.

211

No signs of disease enhancement (e.g., enhanced weight loss) were observed with sub-protective

212

immune responses, an important finding due to concerns of antibody-dependent enhancement.

213

Together, these data support the MA10 mouse-adapted virus as a tool to screen vaccine candidates.

214

This approach could help to test novel immunogens, delivery systems, or dosing regimens,

215

harnessing a relatively high throughput, tractable small animal model, wild-type mice. These

216

studies could be employed to identify promising approaches to advance to large animal pre-clinical

217

and, subsequently, early clinical trials. Moreover, similar mouse challenge models could be

218

developed for the newly described SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

222

RhAd52 vectors were constructed with seven variants of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)

produced in HEK 293B-55K.TetR cells as previously described [23], with the E1 region replaced

232

controls (N = 10 per group). Animals received a single immunization of 109 viral particles (VPs)

233

of RhAd52 vectors by the intramuscular route without adjuvant. In some cases, eight weeks later,

234

mice received a homologous boost immunization. At indicated timepoints, peripheral blood was

235

collected via the submandibular route to isolate serum for immunologic assays. For viral challenge,

236

mice were administered 1 x 104 PFU MA10 SARS-CoV-2 in a volume of 50µL via the intranasal

237

route [14]. Following challenge, body weights were assessed daily. Subsets of animals were

238

euthanized on days 2 and 4 post-challenge for viral outgrowth assays. All animal studies were

conducted in compliance with all relevant local, state and federal regulations and were approved

[10, 28]. Briefly, plates were coated with 1 µg ml−1 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Sino Biological)

246

or SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (Aaron Schmidt, Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen

Readiness), diluted in 1× PBS, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, plates were

washed once with a wash buffer (0.05% TWEEN-20 in 1× PBS) and blocked with 350 µl of casein

per well. The block solution was discarded after 2-3 hours of incubation at room temperature and

250

plates were blotted dry. Three-fold serial dilutions of mouse serum in casein block were added to

251

wells and plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed three

252

times and rabbit anti-mouse IgG HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted 1:1000 in casein block,

253

was added to wells and incubated at room temperature in the dark. After 1 hour, plates were washed

three times, and 100 µl of SeraCare KPL TMB SureBlue Start solution was added to each well.

255

Development was halted with the addition of 100 µl of SeraCare KPL TMB Stop solution per well.

256

The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded using a VersaMax microplate reader. ELISA endpoint

257

titers were defined as the highest reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an absorbance > 0.2. The

258

raw OD values were transferred into GraphPad Prism for analysis. A standard curve was

259

interpolated using a sigmoidal four-parameter logistic (4PL) fit. To quantify the endpoint titer, the

260

interpolation function was used to calculate the dilution at which the OD value would be equal to

261

a value of 0.2.

A SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus expressing a luciferase reporter gene was generated in an

approach similar to as described previously [10, 28, 29]. Briefly, the packaging construct psPAX2

266

(AIDS Resource and Reagent Program), luciferase reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc

267

(Addgene) and S protein expressing pcDNA3.1-SARS CoV-2 S.dCT were co-transfected into

HEK293T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 48 hours, supernatant

269

was collected and pseudotype viruses were purified by filtration with a 0.45-µm filter. To

270

determine the neutralization activity of the antisera from vaccinated animals, HEK293T-hACE2

271

target cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1.75 × 104 cells per well and

272

incubated overnight. Three-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum were prepared and

273

mixed with 50 µl of pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour before adding to

274

HEK293T-hACE2 cells. 48 hours after infection, cells were lysed in Steady-Glo Luciferase

275

(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Neutralization titers were defined as the

276

sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in relative light units was observed relative to the average

Live virus neutralization assay.

280

Live virus neutralization of sera was determined using a nanoLuciferase-expressing SARS-

281

CoV-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2nLuc), bearing wild-type spike protein, as described [37, 38], with

282

slight modification. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded at 2 x 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate

283

24 hours before the assay. 90 PFU of SARS-CoV-2-nLuc virus were mixed with serial diluted sera

284

at 1:1 ratio and incubated at 37 °C for 1hour. An 8-point, 3-fold dilution curve was generated for

285

each sample with starting concentration of 1:20. Virus and serum mix was added to cells and

286

incubated at 37 °C + 5% CO2 for 48 hours. Luciferase activity was measured by Nano-Glo

287

Luciferase Assay System (Promega) following manufacturer protocol using SpectraMax M3

288

luminometer (Molecular Device). Fifty percent neutralization titer (NT50) was calculated in

289

GraphPad Prism by fitting the data points to a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) curve.

292

Lung viral titers were determined by plaque assay. Briefly, right caudal lung lobes were

293

homogenized in 1mL PBS using glass beads and serial dilutions of the clarified lung homogenates

294

were added to a monolayer of Vero E6 cells and overlayed with a solution of 0.8% agarose and

295

media. After three days, plaques were visualized via staining with Neutral Red dye and counted.

of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (S.dTM), iv) the S1 domain with a foldon
trimerization tag, v) the receptor binding domain (RBD) a foldon trimerization tag, vi) deletion of
the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, with mutation of the furin cleavage site (red X),
addition of stabilizing proline mutations (red lines), and a foldon trimerization tag (S.dTM.PP),
and vii) S with mutation of the furin cleavage site (red X) and addition of stabilizing proline
mutations (red lines) (S.PP). B) To explore the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates, wildtype BALB/c mice were immunized at week 0 with 109 viral particles (VPs) of candidate RhAd52
vaccines or sham. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline and every two weeks following
vaccination to monitor antibody responses in serum. Eight weeks post-prime, mice were
administered a homologous boost to explore the potential to boost responses. C) For each RhAd52
insert, as well as sham controls, S-specific binding antibody responses were quantified through
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum every two weeks post-prime. D) The
distribution of RBD-specific ELISA titers at week 8 across candidate RhAd52 vectors. Red lines
indicate the median titer of each group. Neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibody responses
were assessed through E) pseudovirus or F) live SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro neutralization assays.
The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) is displayed, with the median of each vaccine regimen
indicated with a red line. G) The distribution of S-specific ELISA titers at week 8 (open circles)
and week 10 (two weeks post-boost, closed circles) was measured to characterize the
immunogenicity of a homologous boost with candidate RhAd52 vaccines. Red lines indicate the
median titer of each group. For panels C-G, N=9-10 mice/group and endpoint binding titers are
reported. Representative data from one of two similar experiments are shown.
