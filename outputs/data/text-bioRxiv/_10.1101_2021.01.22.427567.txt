Summary

42

Neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike

43

(S) are among the most promising approaches against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1,2.

44

We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) based on two antibodies derived from

45

COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C1353. CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent

46

sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable S binding to Angiotensin-

47

Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes

48

SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as the escape mutants generated by the parental

49

monoclonals. In a novel animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-

50

X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, simultaneous targeting of non-

51

overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, combining

52

into a single molecule the advantages of antibody cocktails.

54

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented effort to develop effective countermeasures

55

against SARS-CoV-2. Pre-clinical data and phase III clinical studies indicate that monoclonal

56

antibodies (mAbs) could be effectively deployed for prevention or treatment during the viral

57

symptoms phase of the disease1,2. Cocktails of two or more mAbs are preferred over a single

58

antibody for increased efficacy and prevention of viral escape. However, this approach requires

59

increased manufacturing costs and volumes, which are problematic at a time when the supply chain

60

is under pressure to meet the high demand for COVID-19 therapeutics, vaccines and biologics in

61

general4. Cocktails also complicate formulation5,6 and hinder novel strategies like antibody

62

delivery by viral vectors or by non-vectored nucleic acids7-9. Instead, multispecific antibodies

63

embody the advantages of a cocktail within a single molecule.

64

To this avail, we employed structural information10 and computational simulations to

65

design bispecifics that would simultaneously bind to (i) independent sites on the same RBD and

66

(ii) distinct RBDs on a S trimer. Out of several designs evaluated by atomistic Molecular Dynamics

67

simulations, 4 were produced and CoV-X2 was the most potent neutralizer of SARS-CoV-2

68

pseudovirus, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 0.04 nM (5.8 ng/mL) (Extended

69

Data Fig.1). CoV-X2 is a human-derived, CrossMAb-format IgG1-like bispecific antibody11

70

resulting from the combination of the Fragment antigen binding (Fab) of mAbs C121 and C135,

71

two potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizers3. Structural predictions showed that CoV-X2, but not its

72

parental monoclonals, can bind bivalently to all RBD conformations on the S trimer, preventing

73

ACE2 access (Fig.1a and Extended Data Fig.2)12.

74

CoV-X2 bound with low nanomolar affinity to RBD, S trimer, and to several mutants,

75

including the naturally occurring variants B.1 (D614G in S protein), B.1.1.7 (N501Y in RBD) and

106

that both of its arms are functional (Fig.1b,c). Next, an avidity assay by Surface Plasmon

107

Resonance (SPR) was used to experimentally confirm the computational prediction that CoV-X2

108

can simultaneously engage two sites on the same RBD (Methods, Fig.1d and Extended Data Fig.6).

109

Avidity occurs when IgGs bind bivalently to antigens, resulting in slower dissociation rates (kd)

110

(Extended Data Fig.6a). Accordingly, C121 and C135 IgG showed avidity at high antigen

111

concentrations due to inter-molecular binding of adjacent RBDs; at lower antigen concentrations

112

the dissociation rate was instead faster since inter-molecular binding was prevented by the

113

increased distance between RBD molecules, resulting in loss of avidity. Intra-molecular avidity is

114

not possible for C121 and C135 since a single epitope is available on each RBD molecule. By

115

contrast, CoV-X2 maintained avidity even at low antigen concentrations, indicating bivalent, intra-

116

molecular binding (Fig.1d and Extended Data Fig.6). ELISA assays were then performed to

117

evaluate the ability of CoV-X2 to inhibit the binding of recombinant ACE2 to the S trimer

118

(Fig.1e,f). In line with the structural information10, C135 did not affect the ACE2/S interaction.

119

C121, which occupies the ACE2 binding site on the RBD, prevented ACE2 binding but only

120

partially. By contrast, ACE2 binding was not detected in the presence of CoV-X2, suggesting a

121

synergistic effect by the two moieties composing the bispecific.

CoV-X2 also bound to pre-formed C121/RBD and C135/RBD complexes, thus confirming

122

To assess the neutralizing ability of CoV-X2 in vitro, we first used SARS-CoV-2

123

pseudoviruses16. The bispecific neutralized pseudovirus carrying wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S at sub-

124

nanomolar concentrations (IC50 = 0.04 nM (5.8 ng/mL); IC90 = 0.3 nM (44 ng/mL)), which was

125

similar or better than the parental IgGs and >100-fold better IC50 than the parental Fabs (Fig.1g).

126

CoV-X2 remained effective against pseudoviruses bearing escape mutations that made them

127

resistant to the individual mAbs (Fig.1g)15 and against a pseudovirus with RBD mutations found

128

in the B.1.351 variant (first reported in South Africa, IC50 =1.3 nM (191 ng/mL); Extended data

129

Fig. 5). To confirm CoV-X2 efficacy, we performed plaque reduction neutralization assays with

130

infectious virus. CoV-X2 efficiently neutralized: SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 0.9 nM); the D614G variant

131

first appearing in Europe (B.1, IC50 = 0.2 nM); the B.1.1.7 variant first observed in the United

132

Kingdom (IC50 = 0.2 nM); the B.1.1.248 variant first isolated in Brazil (IC50 = 2.1 nM) and B.1.351

133

first isolated in South Africa (IC50 = 12 nM; Fig.1h). The latter two have almost identical mutations

134

in the RBD, the only difference being N vs. T at position 417, which does not interact with

135

CoV-X2. Nonetheless, neutralization of B.1.351 was lower, suggesting either some

136

conformational differences in the RBD or long-range effects deriving from other mutations in the

137

S protein. A similar behavior is seen with the wild-type sequence (D614), which has lower

138

neutralization than G614 even if no other difference is present; a plausible explanation is that G614

139

makes the CoV-X2 epitopes more accessible by favoring the RBD ‘up’ conformation.17 We

140

conclude that the in vitro binding and neutralizing properties of CoV-X2 make it preferable over

141

its parental antibodies.

142

To assess the clinical potential of CoV-X2, we investigated its ability to protect animals

143

from infection and disease. We first developed a novel mouse model in which human ACE2

169

This approach enables rapid production of large cohorts of animals and has the advantage of being

170

applicable to wild-type and mutant mouse colonies, independently of age and gender. Moreover,

171

since AAV vectors are only weakly immunogenic and cytotoxic, the system allows for prolonged

172

expression of hACE218-21 (Extended Data Fig.7). SARS-CoV-2 infection of ACE2 humanized

173

mice results in progressive weight loss, respiratory pathology and disease requiring culling on day

To evaluate the protective effect of antibodies, hACE2 mice were treated with antibody

and infiltrations by activated macrophages with foamy cytoplasm (Fig.2i). In contrast, animals

185

treated with CoV-X2 maintained their body weight (P<0.0001 at 4–8 dpi when compared to

186

isotype; Fig.2e; P values between all groups in Extended Data Table1), had reduced viral RNA in

187

the spleen (Fig.2g) and displayed neither macro- nor histopathological changes (DAD <5-10%,

188

Fig.2h,i). While infectious virus could be readily recovered from controls (5 of 6), it was only

189

recovered from 1 out of 10 CoV-X2 treated animals at 5 dpi (Fig. 2f) and could not be recovered

190

from any of 13 animals at 8 dpi (data not shown). Since none of the CoV-X2 treated mice exhibited

191

symptoms at any time, we conclude that CoV-X2 protects mice from infection and disease.

192

Since monotherapy with C121 or C135 mAbs leads to virus escape in vitro15, we treated

193

hACE2 mice with the individual antibodies and sequenced the virus. Only wild-type RBD

194

sequences were obtained from controls (n=10). Instead, the virus in mice treated with C121

195

selected for a mutation resulting in E484D (5 of 5 mice that were analyzed at 8 dpi). C121 escape

196

mutations at E484 were previously observed in vitro15 and changes at this residue (present also in

197

the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 variants) reduce neutralization by human sera by more than 10-fold23.

198

E484D affects intermolecular H-bonds at the core of the C121/RBD interface and it is suggested

199

to increase the RBD affinity for ACE224. Virus with D484 is pathogenic, since 7 out of 9 mice

200

treated with C121 developed disease (Fig.2e) and only D484 virus was found in their lungs. In

201

contrast, and unlike the in vitro results15, no virus evasion or pathology was observed in mice

202

treated with C135 (n=5; Fig.2e and data not shown). In CoV-X2 treated animals, even though no

203

infectious virus was retrieved (8 dpi, n=13) and no symptoms ever noticed, low levels of residual

204

viral RNA could be detected in some animals after 40 cycles of PCR amplification: in 6 of 13

205

animals the virus sequence was wild-type and in 2 mice overlapping sequencing traces were

206

consistent with coexistence of wild-type and D484. Thus, in those 2 of 13 animals with D484 CoV-

207

X2 remained protective even if the mutation diluted the effective antibody concentration,

208

presumably leaving only the C135 moiety active. Finally, CoV-X2 was protective also when

209

administered 12 hours after SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Extended Data Fig.8)

210

Monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S are in advanced clinical trials and

211

show promise against COVID-191,2. Concomitant use of multiple antibodies is preferred for

212

increased efficacy and added resistance against viral evasion. Indeed, the virus can escape pressure

213

by a single antibody in vitro and, as shown here, also in animals. Moreover, RBD mutations

214

threatening the efficacy of single monoclonals have already been detected in virus circulating in

215

minks and humans25, including mutations at the C121 and C135 epitopes (Extended Data Fig.9).

216

One disadvantage of antibody cocktails is the requirement for twice or more the development and

217

production capacity than for single mAbs, which is a significant challenge in light of the

218

augmented demand due to COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics on top of the need to

219

maintain production of biologics for other diseases.4

220

Multispecific antibodies offer the advantages of cocktails in a single molecule. Indeed, we

221

have shown that the CoV-X2 bispecific is more effective than the related monoclonals at inhibiting

222

ACE2 binding; it has sub-nanomolar IC50 against a broader array of viral sequences; and it protects

223

animals from SARS-CoV-2 even when C121, its potent parental mAb, fails due to the insurgence

224

of viral escape. C135, the other parental mAb, did not generate escape in our animal experiment

225

but readily generated them in vitro15. CoV-X2 is expected to be more resistant to viral escape

226

compared to monoclonals. Indeed, we have shown that CoV-X2 binds and neutralizes mutants not

227

recognized by its parental mAbs as well as variants of concern that recently emerged in United

228

Kingdom13, South Africa14 and Brazil26.

229

CoV-X2, unlike other multispecifics27, is a fully human IgG-like molecule. As such, it has

230

favorable developability and could be further engineered to alter effector functions. For example,

231

the Fragment crystallizable (Fc) of CoV-X2 was already modified to modulate its interaction with

232

Fc receptors and complement (LALA-PG mutations)28 without affecting its antigen-binding

233

properties. The LALA modification prevents Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of

234

flavivirus infection29,30 and it may be a desirable modification also in the context of SARS-CoV-

235

2, since cellular and animal experiments with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV31-33, support

236

the possibility of ADE. Other modifications, like LS28 for increased half-life, are easily achievable.

237

Finally, CoV-X2 is human-derived and produced in a format (CrossMab) already shown to be safe

238

in clinical trials34, which further supports its developability. Thus, IgG-like bispecifics are worth

239

adding to the arsenal employed to combat SARS-CoV-2 and its plausible future mutations.

Extended Data Fig.2 | CoV-X2 engages its epitopes on all RBD conformations on the S trimer. a–d,
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the complex between the CoV-X2 bispecific and S trimers with
RBD in either all down, all up or mixed up/down conformations show that CoV-X2 can engage a single
RBD with both arms (a,b), two adjacent RBDs in the down conformation (c), and two RBDs in the up/down
conformation (b,d). The complexes were subjected to up to 400 ns of fully atomistic MD simulations to
assess feasibility and stability of the bound conformations. Root-mean-squared deviations (RMSD) values
are shown to indicate structural stability. S trimer is in shades of grey, RBDs in yellow (down conformation)
and orange (up), the C121 and C135 moieties of CoV-X2 are in green and blue, respectively. e, Schematic
representation of the computationally predicted binding modes of CoV-X2, C121 IgG and C135 IgG on the
S trimer, colored as in a–d. Antibodies are represented by connected circles; ACE2 is in red on the RBD if
it can bind directly to a given conformation; it has an arrow pointing to the RBD if ACE2 binding is
achieved after an allowed switch to the up conformation. For example, in the 3-up conformation (left),
CoV-X2 can engage all the RBDs with bivalent binding, whereas C121 and C135 can only achieve
monovalent binding. C135 binding does not prevent interaction with ACE2. The situation is similar in the

Extended Data Fig.6 | SPR-based avidity assays confirm that CoV-X2 can engage bivalently on a
single RBD. a, CoV-X2 and monoclonal IgGs (C121 or C135) have different binding modes available
when high or low quantities of RBD are immobilized on the surface of the SPR chip. mAbs have avidity
effects at high RBD concentrations due to intermolecular binding, which results in slower dissociation rate
(kd), but not at low RBD concentrations, since bivalent binding to a single RBD is impossible. In contrast,
the bispecific has avidity at both high and low concentrations, since bivalent binding to its two epitopes on
a single RBD is possible. ka is not affected by avidity. b, Experimental confirmation that CoV-X2 engages
bivalently on a single RBD. SPR traces used to determine ka and kd of mAbs, Fab and bispecific at different
concentrations of immobilized RBD (see Fig.1d) are shown. c, Table summarizing the SPR results plotted
in Fig.1d. ka and kd were normalized against the values at the highest RBD concentration. ka and Fab kd were

unaffected by the RBD concentration, as expected. kd became faster for the monoclonals (loss of avidity)
but less so for the bispecific (avidity maintained due to simultaneous binding to two sites on a single RBD).

quantification (bottom). c, Preparation of concentrated AAV-hACE2. AAV-hACE2 plasmid was cotransfected with pHelper and AAV Rep/Cap 2/9n vectors into 293AAV cells (see Methods). In order to
increase viral titers, viral particles from both cell lysate and PEG-precipitated growth medium were
ultracentrifuged in discontinuous iodixanol gradient. The silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel shows 14
consecutive fractions: 1-9 represent enriched AAV fractions used for experiments, whereas fractions 10–
14 are contaminated with proteinaceous cell debris. Iodixanol was chosen as a density gradient medium
due to its low toxicity in vivo and its easy removal by ultrafiltration. M is protein marker, * are AAV capsid
proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. d, The amount of AAV particles was estimated by qRT-PCR. The number of
genome copies (GC) expressed as log was calculated from a standard curve. From one 15 cm2 dish, 75 µl
with 2.0x1012 GC/ml were prepared, which is sufficient for hACE2 humanization of 37 mice. e, Kinetic of
lung histopathology in SARS-CoV-2 infected ACE2 humanized mice. Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained
sections showed inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and
fibroblasts replacing the alveoli. The size of the affected areas increased over time (area of diffuse alveolar
damage: control <5-10%, 2 dpi <10-30%, 5 dpi 20-80 %, 8 dpi 50-90%). Alveolar septa were thickened in
areas close to infiltrates. In samples collected at 5 and 8 dpi, an increased number of activated macrophages
with foamy cytoplasm (black arrowheads) was seen. AAV-hACE2 transduced, SARS-CoV-2 uninfected
mice were used as control and showed no significant pathology.

250 µg/mouse of either isotype control antibody (n=3) or CoV-X2 (n=2) 12 hours later. Weight loss and
pathological signs were apparent in control but not in CoV-X2 treated animals.

Extended Data Fig.9 | Natural SARS-CoV-2 variants in the C121 and C135 epitopes. Summary of
naturally occurring mutations in the C121 (a) or C135 (b) epitopes reported in circulating SARS-CoV-2
(as of January 1, 2021). The location of the mutated residues is shown in red on the RBD structure. C121
and C135 variable regions are in green and blue (PDB ID: 7K8X and 7K8Z respectively).

Extended Data Table 1 | Summary of the P values for the mouse protection experiment. Statistical
comparison of body weight differences in animals treated with the individual monoclonal antibodies (C121
or C135), the CoV-X2 bispecific or isotype control at 8 dpi (related to Fig. 2e). P values were determined
with the ANOVA test. Comparison of the entire curves (Fig. 2e) by the One Sample Wilcoxon Test or by
the ANOVA followed by Turkey-Kramer post-test reveals that the isotype control treated group is
statistically different from any of the other groups (CoV-X2, C135, or C121; P<0.05).
