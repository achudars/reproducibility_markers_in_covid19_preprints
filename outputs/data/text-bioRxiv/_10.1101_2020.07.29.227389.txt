Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection. At low pH,
binding of SARS-CoV and its ACE2 receptor has a tight interaction that catalyzes
the fusion of the spike and endosomal membranes followed by genome release.
Largely overlooked has been the role of neutral pH in the respiratory tract, where
we find that SARS-CoV stabilizes a transition state that enhances the off-rate
from its receptor. An alternative pH-switch is found in CoV-2-like coronaviruses
of tropical pangolins, but with a reversed phenotype where the tight interaction
with ACE2 is at neutral pH. We show that a single point mutation in pangolinCoV, unique to CoV-2, that deletes the last His residue in their receptor binding
domain perpetuates this tight interaction independent of pH. This tight bond, not
present in previous respiratory syndromes, implies that CoV-2 stays bound to the
highly expressed ACE2 receptors in the nasal cavity about 100 times longer than
CoV. This finding supports the unfamiliar pathology of CoV-2, observed virus
retention in upper respiratory tract1, longer incubation times and extended
periods of shedding. Implications to combat pandemics that, like SARS-CoV-2,
export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates due to
retention in nasal epithelium and their evolutionary origin are discussed.

Although accurate assessments are still evolving, reports from the world health organization
indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) is significantly different from infection with
previous respiratory viruses. The biggest distinctions are a longer incubation period and increased
viral shedding (both likely responsible for higher rates of transmission), strong correlation of
infected-fatality rates (IFR) with age and comorbidities, higher IFR for males relative to females,
and minimal impact in young children. While this complex pathology could be due to complex
genomic changes triggered by the virus in cells, tissues, and organs2, longer incubation and
infectivity time scales also suggest that differences could have a biophysical origin.
Work on SARS-CoV (CoV1) has already determined that the virus enters cells via receptormediated endocytosis in a pH-dependent manner3 that is characterized by co-translocation of the
viral spike glycoprotein and its specific functional receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), from the cell surface to early endosomes. Key steps that control the fate of the virus in
the early and late endosome are driven in part by lowering the pH from 6.5-to-6.0 and from 6.0to-5.04, respectively; exposure to low pH triggers a spike catalyzed fusion between the viral and
endosomal membranes followed by viral genome release. The cell machinery is then hijacked to
replicate and assemble new virus particles that eventually exit the cell, primarily through budding.
Broadly speaking, this is the same pH-dependent endocytic path followed by the influenza virus5,6,
and likely all other coronaviruses (including MERS-CoV).
Cell surface receptor engagement is a critical aspect of viral infection and life cycle. While
infections by CoV1 and CoV2 are mediated by the ACE2 receptor, MERS-CoV (MERS) gains
entry to cells through dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4)7. Fig. 1 shows structures for the receptorbinding domains (RBD) in complex with their receptors for all three viruses. Surprisingly and
likely significantly, while the RBD of CoV18 and MERS9 have one Histidine on opposite ends of
their binding interface, CoV210 does not have His residues in this domain. As we have been able
to determine to date, all known strains of CoV2 have mutated away their last His residue that is
still present in the RBD of CoV1/MERS and related zoonotic viruses (see Table 1). His protonation
is important in the low endosomal pH for spike fusion with the membrane, however, little is known
on the purpose of His in neutral pH that is relevant for the virus to establish an initial foothold in
the respiratory system. Here we set to decipher the mechanistic role of the remaining His residue
that distinguishes the RBDs of CoV1 and CoV2. We discovered that deletion of the pH-switch in
the RBD of CoV2 results in a tighter bond to ACE2 than CoV1, retaining the virus in the nasal

cavities for significantly longer time scales. More interestingly, we discover that this mechanism
is fully reconciled by a single point mutation in the sequence of related coronaviruses in Sunda
pangolins11.
pH-switch reveals distinct binding landscapes
We studied the role of pH in the RBD of the spike proteins by performing three independent 500
ns unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) of CoV1 (PDB 2DD812) and CoV2 (PDB
6LZG10) at both physiological and low pH ~ 5.0 conditions (See Methods). At neutral pH, the
equilibrium binding affinity of the RBD of CoV2 and ACE2 has been shown to be slightly stronger
than that of CoV113,14. No such measurements exist at low pH, which in practice should protonate
His residues from neutral to positively charged (His+) by the addition of an extra hydrogen. Of
note, although not studied here, the RBD of MERS-CoV has previously been shown to have two
distinct conformations at neutral and low pH15.
At neutral pH, MDs revealed important differences between the RBD of CoV1 and CoV2. For
CoV1, the dynamics of the binding interface (Fig. 2A) is divided between (a) a loop
(F460SPDGKPCTPPALNCY475) that displays not-bound-like conformations (~ 5.8 ‚Ñ´), and (b) the
remainder of the binding interface that consistently adopts bound-like conformations (~ 1.1 ‚Ñ´)
relative to its co-crystal (PDB 2AJF). Simulations for tautomer NŒµH at His445 are shown in Fig.
S1. Remarkably, pH-independent CoV2, which mutates the last Histidine, His445, in CoV1 to
Lys458 in CoV2, yields almost exclusively bound-like conformations for the whole binding
interface (Fig. 2B).
Of note, independent molecular dynamics of neutral pH CoV1 and CoV2 RBD bound to ACE2
had been previously performed by the D. E. Shaw Research group.16 Consistent with our unbound
MDs, the loop in CoV1 is found to move away from the co-crystal structure, sampling not-boundlike conformations significantly more than the homologous loop in CoV2. As in Fig. 2, the
remainder of the binding interface (not including the loop) is stable around the bound-state
throughout the 10 ùúás MDs.
Low pH is critical for the activation of the spike fusion with the endosomal membrane17. Hence,
one would expect that both CoV1 and CoV2 interaction with ACE2 to be similar. Strikingly, our
MDs showed that a protonated His445+ in Cov1 (Fig. 2C) switches the dynamics of the loop from
not-bound- (~ 5.8 ‚Ñ´) to bound-like (~ 1.9 ‚Ñ´), establishing the same phenotype as the one observed

in CoV2. As shown in the representative Supplementary Movies 1, the interactions of His445+
relative to His445 with the switching loop are more stable, and resemble Lys458 that consistently
engages seven conserved nearby residues T470EIYQAG476 (Table 1) to stabilize the bound-like
phenotype. Low pH should also protonate His34+ in ACE2 (Fig. 1). However, His34+ should only
increase the overall binding affinity for both CoV1 and CoV2 since their corresponding co-crystal
structures suggest that they should form the same intermolecular hydrogen bond network (Fig.
S2).
Implications of these findings in the binding free energy landscape of CoV1 and CoV2 are
sketched in Fig. 3. Namely, at low pH, the similar dynamics and affinity of both CoV1 and CoV2
with their specific ACE2 receptor is drawn as a deep well in the binding landscape. This reflects
the fact that breaking the complex should entail detaching all the contacts at once since the full
binding interfaces for both viruses are stabilized around the bound conformation before and after
binding ACE2. However, at neutral pH the binding landscape of CoV1 is different due to the pHswitch in its RBD. Specifically, Fig. 2A reveals a higher free energy transition state characterized
by a bound-like behavior for most of the binding interface except for a distal loop that switches to
a not-bound-like state. Of note, equilibrium thermodynamics alone cannot distinguish between the
different landscapes shown in Fig. 3. In fact, the presence of a transition-state can only be revealed
by studying the dynamics of the interaction.
Slip-bond enhances CoV1 off-rate
What are the implications of this transition state found in CoV1 but not in CoV2 at neutral pH? To
answer this question, we need to consider that viral particles in the respiratory system are under
small external strains from, e.g., the ever-present shear flow in the respiratory airways, when
engaging cell surface receptors. This shear flow generates tensile forces that pull and push on the
chemical bonds between the RBD and ACE2 shifting their behavior from equilibrium to out-ofequilibrium kinetics. Specifically, while the association rate of CoV1 and ACE2 was found to be

This problem is well understood both theoretically18,19, and experimentally20,21. Based on

and, k 3##5 is the ‚Äúspring‚Äù constant associated with the tensile forces exerted on the loop domain

It is clear that the spring approximation is exact for small deformations and in quasi-equilibrium
conditions where the ramp rate for the force must be slow. In general, shear flow will twist around
its long-axis to reach the transition state from the bonded state. And, since k 3##5 > 0, whether
pulling or pushing on the chemical bond, this motion always loosens "tightness". This corresponds
to a typical slip-bond19-21, whose lifetime is shortened by tensile forces acting in the bond.

diffusing 1 ¬µùëö in 0.5 s.
Tensile forces triggered by the shear stress in the respiratory airways shorten the lifetime of the
CoV1 RBD/ACE2 bond at physiological pH to about 3 s (Table 2), i.e., CoV1 particles bound to
cell surface receptors should detach in time scales that are much faster than the time needed for
other receptors to bind and stabilize virus attachment. This observation implies that CoV1 will not
be able to efficiently engage ACE2 receptors in the upper respiratory tract since after each
detachment particles will drift due to normal breathing and gravity down the respiratory tract or
be exhaled out (see Supplementary Movie 2). On the other hand, deletion of the pH switch allows
CoV2 to have a tighter RBD/ACE2 bond with dwelling times of about ~ 300 s (Table 2),
commensurate with the diffusion time scales needed to recruit other ACE2 receptors to stabilize
virus attachment (see Supplementary Movie 3).
Tight-binding at neutral pH found in pangolin-CoV
Further supporting the observation that CoV2 is unique among other coronaviruses, Table 1
compares sequence alignments of pH domains in RBDs of both CoV1, CoV2, MERS, as well as
other closely related zoonotic viruses. CoV2-related coronaviruses in pangolin and bats specific
strains are missing the pH-switch present in CoV1; instead, they share the Lys458 stabilization
motif. However, these zoonotic viruses still have pH-switches that co-localize with the pH-switch
in the RBD of MERS (Fig. 1).

Interestingly, as for CoV1, pangolin-CoV species are also one mutation away from losing the last
Histidine residue in their corresponding RBD. In order to investigate whether this histidine plays
a similar role as His445 in CoV1, we replicated the analysis performed for the RBD of CoV1 in
simulations of a homology model of the RBD of pangolin-CoV, and compared the MDs to the cocrystal structure of CoV2 that given their high sequence similarity we used as template for our
model (see Methods). Strikingly, we found that neutral (Fig. 4A) and protonated His498 (Fig. 4B)
in pangolin-CoV resulted in almost identical phenotypes as for CoV1 but in reverse. Namely, the
dynamics of the RBD at neutral pH for NdH consistently displays a bound-like phenotype over the
whole simulation time, the same was observed for NeH (Fig. S3). On the other hand, protonation
of His498+ activates a not-bound-like dynamics in the same switching loop discovered in CoV1
(Fig. 2A), with bound-like behavior for the remaining binding interface (Fig. 4B).
The observation that, at neutral pH, pangolin-CoV has the same phenotype as CoV2 led us to test
a single point mutation at His498 in pangolin-CoV that corresponds to Gln498 in the CoV2
sequence (Table 1). Significantly, we found that this mutation, which makes the RBD of pangolinCoV pH-independent, is enough to retain the same tight-binding phenotype that we found applies
for CoV2, with the dynamics of the whole interface becoming consistently bound-like (Fig. 4C).
Viruses adopt different mechanisms for cell entry
Molecular dynamics of unbound and bound complexes of the RBD of CoV1 and its specific
receptor ACE2 revealed that a pH-switch in the RBD of CoV1 stabilizes a transition state that
enhances the off-rate of the RBD/ACE2 bond. In conjunction with the higher diffusion of viral
particles relative to cell surface receptors, this ‚Äústick-and-slip‚Äù mechanism allows the virus to
efficiently search the cell surface for random clusters of receptors to stabilize virus attachment and
trigger endocytosis in the lower respiratory tract. In principle, ‚Äúbouncing around‚Äù trying to stick
to a suitable receptor is also a powerful approach for respiratory viruses to evolve bonds with
receptors that are found in abundance in epithelial cell surfaces such as sialic acids for influenza
and the ACE2 receptor for SARS (See Supplementary Movie 2).
The newly discovered deletion of the pH-switch in the RBD of CoV2 and its impact on receptor
binding reveals a different mechanism (See Supplementary Movie 3) that allows CoV2
internalization to take advantage of the high expression of ACE2 in the nasal epithelium by holding
to ACE2 receptors for about 100 times longer than CoV1.

Viral infection and its pathology
The stick-and-slip molecular mechanism is consistent with CoV1 being mainly a lower respiratory
tract disease25,26. And, the tighter-bond evolved by CoV2 agrees with recent experiments1 that
showed robust replication of CoV2 in the primary nasal cells compared to peripheral lung.
Viral replication in human mucous gland cells should release viruses back into the same area27
where they can infect new cells until the supply of ACE2 receptors is depleted below the critical
threshold needed for binding and internalization. This process will trap viral particles in the upper
respiratory tract, naturally leading to longer incubation times. Similarly, accumulation of viral
particles in the nasal mucosa will lead to extended periods of viral shedding.
Based on our findings, the distinguishable feature of CoV2 having a higher retention rate in the
nasal cavity of adults is a higher transmission rate than CoV1. Interestingly, children do not have
well developed sinuses until adolescence28. Thus, large areas for viral retention and replication
will not be available in young children, which might result in shorter incubation times due to the
faster diffusion down to the lower respiratory tract. Something similar could apply to females who
have smaller nasal cavities relative to males29. Shorter times in the nasal cavity would lead to a
lower viral load in the upper airways and could explain the lower transmission observed in young
children. Moreover, in light of the new findings by Hou et al.1, a weaker replication in this area
might impact disease prognosis.
Evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV2
While we have not yet found the species or strain where the loss of the pH-switch first occurred,
relationships shown in Table 1 point at the possible zoonotic origin of CoV2. In particular, the
recent finding that the RBD of coronaviruses in tropical pangolins seized in China three years
ago1122 share a high sequence similarity with the RBD of CoV2 suggests pangolins as a host.
Mechanistically, we found that different pH-switches in SARS-CoV-like viruses regulate the
dynamics of the same loop between bound-like and not-bound-like conformations. While
pangolin-CoV has the same Lys458 motif of CoV2 that eliminated the pH-switch present in CoV1
at His445, a different pH-switch at His498 stabilizes the bound-state of the RBD at neutral pH, but
not at low pH as the CoV1 pH-switch did. However, a single point mutation His498Gln in
pangolin-CoV not only eliminates the pH-switch but also retains the bound-like conformations of
the RBD operational at both neutral and low pH, i.e., the same tight binding phenotype as that

observed in CoV2. This molecular mechanism reveals a direct functional link that supports
coronaviruses in pangolins species as the zoonotic origin of CoV2.
Outlook
While the evolutionary advantage of higher infectivity by SARS-CoV2 in the nasal area is clear,
this property comes at the expense of an important regulatory mechanism. Namely, simply based
on diffusion, the life-cycle of SARS-CoV2 is significantly slower than that of SARS-CoV because
CoV2 is essentially immobilized at its initial cell receptor contact.
The pH-switch in SARS-CoV, which originated in temperate Asia, stabilizes a transition state that
enhances the off-rate from its receptor. On the other hand, Sunda pangolins, which originate in a
tropical climate, show a tighter bond to ACE2 at neutral pH. These observations suggest that
coronaviruses of tropical pangolins smuggled to temperate Wuhan could have undergone
adaptive relief in adopting a different binding strategy to their receptors, highlighting the need to
better understand the consequences of niche shifts driven by global movement of virus strains.
Collectively, our studies provide insight pertinent to the molecular basis of viral infectivity and, at
the same time, validate this form of thermodynamic and molecular modeling as an approach to
probe the evolution of the next SARS-mediated pandemic. From a therapeutic perspective, our
findings linking viral pathology with long-term viral infection/retention in nasal epithelium of the
upper respiratory tract suggest that vaccine development should not just concentrate on fighting
systemic infection through induction of IgG responses, but should instead aim to elicit high titers
of secretory IgA antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus in the nasal mucosa. Therefore,
intranasal delivery of a vaccine with strong IgA producing potential is a logical approach to
consider as the next step in countering the current and future pandemics that, like SARS-CoV2,
export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates.

Figure 1. Deletion of Histidine residues in receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV2. Cocrystal structures of the RBD (blue) and their specific receptor (green) for (A) SARS-Cov (PDB
2AJF; CoV1), (B) SARS-CoV2 (PDB 6LZG; CoV2) and (C) MERS-CoV (PDB 4L72; MERS).
RBD binding interface is shown in red. RBD‚Äôs of Cov1 and MERS have one histidine each
(yellow), H445 and H486, respectively. Key residues K458 and Q498 in CoV2 are indicated in
yellow. H34 (in blue) is the only histidine in the binding interface of ACE2.

‚Ñ´ cluster in last 300 ns of the MD (% of cluster size relative to simulation time is indicated); Three
independent MDs showing RMSD relative to co-crystal of (a) 16 amino acid loop (or its homolog)
as a function of time, and (b) the remaining of the binding interface (or its homolog) that stays in
a bound-like conformation for 100% of the simulation time, for (A) CoV1 at neutral pH (His445),
(B) CoV2, and (C) CoV1 at low pH (His445+). Loop in CoV1 switches between not-bound-like
(~ 5.8 ‚Ñ´) to bound-like (~ 1.9 ‚Ñ´) for His445 and His445+, respectively. Bound-like behavior of
His445+ resembles CoV2.

Figure 3. Free energy binding landscapes of RBD of SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 and
ACE2 receptor. At neutral pH, CoV1 dynamics reveals a transition-state that gives rise to a slipbond in the presence of external forces such as shear flow. At low pH, this state is eliminated, and
similar to CoV2, the landscape is depicted as a deep well corresponding to a tight-bond. Low pH
curves are shown with lower binding free energies to reflect the role of His34+ in ACE2.

Figure 4. Role of pH switch in binding interface of pangolin-CoV and H498Q mutant. Caption
is equivalent as in Fig. 2. Dynamics of three independent MDs show that, at neutral pH, (A)
pangolin-CoV stays in a bound-like conformations for 100% of the simulation time, and the single
point mutation (C) His498Gln preserves the same bound-like binding phenotype. (B) RMSD of
16 amino acid loop shifts to not-bound-like (~ 6 ‚Ñ´) at low pH (His498+).

Methods
Atomic coordinates for starting structures were acquired from the Protein Data Bank1: 2DD8 was
used for CoV1 RBD and 6LZG was used for the CoV2 RBD. The RBD from 2DD8 (bound to
neutralizing antibody) was chosen instead of that in PDB ID 2AJF (bound to ACE2) as a starting
structure as it includes otherwise missing portions of the domain. Modification of His to different
tautomeric or protonation states was done with PyMol‚Äôs Mutagenesis Wizard.2 Molecular
dynamics simulations (MDs) were carried out with pmemd.cuda from AMBER183-5 using
AMBER ff14SB force field6 and Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF).7 We used tLeap binary
(part of AMBER18) for solvating the structures in a cubed TIP3P water box with a 10 √Ö distance
from structure surface to the box edges, and closeness parameter of 0.75 √Ö. The system was
neutralized and solvated. Simulations were carried out after minimizing the system, gradually
heating the system from 0 K to 3 00K over 50 ps, and equilibrating the system for 1 ns at NPT.
500 ns of production was then carried out using NPT at 300 K with the Langevin thermostat, a
non-bonded interaction cut off of 8 √Ö, time step of 2 fs, and the SHAKE algorithm to constrain all
bonds involving hydrogens.
Clustering was completed using CPPTRAJ8 and H-bond and RMSD calculations were done with
VMD.9
Homology models of RBD of pangolin-CoV were done making point mutations using PyMOL in
CoV2 RBD from PDB 6LZG.
All figures were drawn using PyMOLand GNUPLOT.

Figure S2. Protonation of the Human ACE2 H34 further stabilizes binding interface.
Protonated state of H34+ is predicted to form the same stable H-bond network with D30 in ACE2,
and Y440 and Y453 in (A) CoV1 and (B) CoV2, respectively. H-bond network is based on
rotamers already observed in co-crystals of the unprotonated forms: (C) PDB 2AJF for CoV1, and,
(D) PDB 6LZG for CoV2 (see also PDB 6M0J). Unprotonated co-crystal structures of CoV2
assigned the tautomer of H34 to be NdH making a bond with backbone oxygen of D30, which is
already making a bond in the a-helix. Our MDs suggest that even in the unprotonated form the
rotamer should be rotated 180o having Nd and Ne interacting with D30 and Y453 (as shown in
panels C and D).
