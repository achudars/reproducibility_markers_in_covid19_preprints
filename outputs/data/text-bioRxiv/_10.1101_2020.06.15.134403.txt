Abstract
Older aged adults and those with pre-existing conditions are at highest risk for severe COVID19 associated outcomes. Using a large dataset of genome-wide RNA-seq profiles derived from
human dermal fibroblasts (GSE113957) we investigated whether age affects the expression of
pattern recognition receptor (PRR) genes and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Older age
was associated with increased expression of PRR genes, ACE2 and four genes that encode
proteins that have been shown to interact with SAR2-CoV-2 proteins. Assessment of PRR
expression might provide a strategy for stratifying the risk of severe COVID-19 disease at both
the individual and population levels.

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, Pattern recognition receptors, Toll-like receptor 4, Aging, Skin
fibroblasts

Background
Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will have mild to moderate cold and flu-like symptoms,
or even be asymptomatic (1). Older aged adults, and those with underlying conditions such as
diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease are at highest risk for severe
COVID-19 associated outcomes (2). The highest case fatality rates are in the 80 years and
older age group (7.8%), with the lowest in the 0–9 years age group (0.00161%) (3). The
reasons for these markedly different outcomes at the extremes of age and for the occasional
death that occurs in apparently healthy younger patients remain poorly understood.

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play crucial roles in the innate immune response by
recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and molecules derived from
damaged cells, referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (4-6). PRRs are
coupled to intracellular signaling cascades that control transcription of a wide spectrum of
inflammatory genes. Humans have several distinct classes of PRRs, including Toll-like
receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin
receptors (CLRs) and intracellular DNA sensors. PRRs play a critical role in the inflammatory
response induced by viruses and are important determinants of outcome (7-9).

In this study, we examined whether age affects the expression of PPR genes, ACE2 and
proteins that have been shown to interact with SARS-CoV-2. We found older age to be
associated with increased expression of PRR genes, ACE2 and several genes that encode
proteins known to interact with SAR2-CoV-2.

Results and discussion
Dermal fibroblast RNA-seq data set
Dermal fibroblast cultures retain age-dependent phenotypic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic
changes (10-13). As such, fibroblast cultures have been proposed as a model for studying
aging and related diseases (14). We leveraged this approach to investigate the affect aging has
on PRR and ACE2 gene expression. For our analysis we used a large dataset of genome-wide
RNA-seq profiles derived from human dermal fibroblasts (GSE 113957) that was previously
used to develop an ensemble machine learning method that could predict chronological age to a
median error of 4 years (14). The dataset includes samples from 133 “apparently healthy
individuals” aged between 1 to 94 years. Given that COVID-19 disease has markedly different
outcomes at the extremes of age, we first examined the gene expression differences between
the oldest (≥80 years) and the youngest (≤10 years) age groups (see “Methods” section). After
filtering out genes with low expression (cpm >0.5 in at least two samples), a total of 1252 genes
were differentially expressed between the oldest relative to the youngest age group (Fig. 1a,
Additional file 1: Suppl Table 1a). Differentially expressed genes were enriched in KEGG
pathways involved in Cell Cycle and DNA replication, among others (Fig. 1b, Additional file 2:
Suppl Table 2).

Age is associated with broad changes in PRR gene expression
We next focused on whether the expression of individual PRR genes change with age.
Between the oldest (≥80 years) and the youngest (≤10 years) age groups we found three
differentially expressed PRR genes (TLR3, TLR4, and IHIF1) that had a log2FC >1.0 (Fig. 1c
and d, Additional file 1: Suppl Table 1b). Age was correlated with the expression of 20 out of
21 PRR genes (Fig. 2a, Additional file 3, Suppl Table 3a-c). Normalized gene counts for TLR3,
TLR4 and IHIF1 expressed as a function of age are shown in Fig. 2b. Of these, TLR4 had the
greatest fold change increase (log2FC = 2.6) and the highest correlation coefficient with age

(Pearson r 0.60, Adj. P Value 2.05E-14) (Additional files 1 and 3: Suppl Tables 1b and 3a-c).
Plots of the other TLR genes counts are provided in Additional file 4: Suppl Figure 1.
The expression of two PRR genes were negatively correlated with age, Nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) (log2FC = -0.27; Adj. P Value = 0.01;
Pearson r -0.18, Adj. P Value 0.04) and Cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (CGAS) (log2FC = -0.56,
Adj. P Value 7.89E-05; Pearson r -0.34, Adj. P Value 6.6E-5). Both genes encode proteins that
activate the immune response to viruses (15, 16).
To explore our findings further, we performed a differential gene expression analysis on the
dermal fibroblast cell lines that had high (>75th percentile) and low (<25th percentile) expression
of TLR4 (Additional file 5: Suppl Table 4). Curiously, enrichment analysis of the 789
differentially expressed genes showed cell cycle (KEGG: hsa04110) to be the canonical
pathway with the greatest enrichment (FDR 1.55E-06), similar to the enrichment of the
differentially expressed genes between oldest and youngest groups (Fig. 1b and 2c, Additional
file 6: Suppl Table 5). TLR4 is known to act via the adaptor molecule TRIF to regulate the
expression of type I interferons. TLR activation of TRIF can also induce the cell cycle, an effect
which is antagonized by type I interferons (17). Our finding of both high levels of TLR4 and
elevated cell cycle could thus imply changes in the expression of type I interferons.
ACE2 expression increases with age
We then examined whether the expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, changes
with age. ACE2 expression was detected in 35 of the 133 cell lines (26.3%) and showed a
marked increase in the 80+ age group (Fig. 2b right). ACE2 expression was correlated with the
expression of 19 of the 21 PRR genes (Fig. 2a and Additional file: Suppl Table 3a-c). Of note,
ACE2 was expressed at much lower levels than TLR4, with variable expression in the 80 year
and over age group. Whether the latter reflects the biological state of the individuals who
donated the skin samples or is a consequence of ex vivo culture will require further study.
Age-related interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins
We also asked the question if the differentially expressed genes between the oldest and
youngest age groups encode proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 (see “Methods” section).
Our analysis revealed eleven differentially expressed genes between the oldest and youngest
age groups that encode proteins known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3d). Four of these

genes (ADAM9, FBLN5, FAM8A1, CLIP4) have increased expression in the older compared to
the younger age groups. Interestingly, the SAR-CoV-2 proteins to which they bind relate to lipid
modifications and vesicle trafficking. Host interactions of Orf8 (endoplasmic reticulum quality
control), M (ER structural morphology proteins), and NSp13 (golgins) may facilitate the dramatic
reconfiguration of ER/Golgi trafficking during coronavirus infection (18). Whether age-related
increases in the expression of host proteins that bind SARS-CoV-2 protein predispose to
COVID-19 disease or change its clinical course deserves further study.

Discussion
The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) pandemic is presenting unprecedented challenges
to health care systems and governments worldwide. As of June 15, 2020 there have been
7,949,073 confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in 434,181 deaths (19). COVID-19 disease is
caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded enveloped RNA virus, with viral entry depending upon binding
of its spike protein to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme II (ACE2), a transmembrane protein
present on the surface of multiple types of cells (20). Infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 disrupts
cellular metabolism and compromises cellular survival by triggering apoptosis. Given the rapid
spread of the virus and its associated mortality, there is a critical need to better understand the
biology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In this study, we used RNA-seq data from a large collection of dermal fibroblasts to demonstrate
that PRR genes and ACE2 vary with age. Further, we show that aging is associated with
increased expression of several genes that encode proteins known to bind to SARS-CoV-2.
Whether these gene expression differences contribute to the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2
infection will require further study. Nevertheless, overexpression of PRR genes, TLR4 in
particular, is an intriguing mechanism to explain the relationship between age and SARS-CoV-2
infection, and potentially the TLR-mediated cytokine storm that characterizes the morbidity and
mortality in COVID-19 disease. TLR4 has been previously suggested to have a role in the
damaging responses that occurs during viral infections, acting via both PAMPs and DAMPs
(21). Diabetes, obesity and coronary artery disease are some of the conditions in which
increased TLR4 expression has been reported (22-24). Notably, when blood from individuals
with stable coronary artery disease and obese patients with atherosclerosis are stimulated with
TLR ligands there is an increased cytokine response (25, 26). Platelet TLR4 also has an
important role in thrombosis (27), thus potentially linking toll-receptor expression to the

hypercoagulability observed in COVID-19 patients (28). Considered together, changes in the
expression of TLRs and other PRRs could have a key role in mediating the age-related
inflammatory response during SARS CoV-2 infection.

Our study does have some limitations. Foremost, is that health information was not available
for the individuals donating skin samples to the dermal fibroblast collection. Although, the skin
samples are reported to be from “apparently healthy individuals”, we believe it is unlikely that
individuals in the oldest age group were completely free of chronic diseases. Another limitation
was that minority groups are inadequately represented in the collection. The dermal fibroblast
collection includes samples from one American Indian (<1%), one Hispanic (<1%), two Asians
(1.5%), and nine Blacks (6.7%)—way too few to draw any meaningful conclusions on the ethnic
groups that have been the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, as the scientific community ramps up research in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the dermal fibroblast model could prove useful for investigating SARS-CoV-2 biology.
Fibroblasts have been previously used to investigate host antiviral defenses during Coronavirus
infection (29). The potential strength of the dermal fibroblast model is that skin samples can be
easily obtained from donors of different ages, sex, and ethnicities, and those with varying
comorbidities such a high blood pressure and diabetes; and from smokers and non-smokers.
Such a model would also have an advantage over transfection models as these cells would not
only have increased expression of ACE2 and TLR4, but also have an aged transcriptome which
could be important for the infectivity and outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The critical role
PRRs play in mediating host-pathogen interactions, and their increased expression in some comorbidities associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes, make them an attractive target for
developing tools to predict risk for and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection at both the individual
and population levels.

Conclusions
Using a large dataset of genome-wide RNA-seq profiles derived from human dermal fibroblasts
we show that expression of PRR genes and ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 vary with age.
Advanced age was also associated with increased expression of several genes that encode
proteins which interact with SARS-CoV-2. Given that PRRs function as a critical interface

between the host and invading pathogens, further research is needed to better understand how
changes in PRR expression affects the susceptibility to and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Human dermal fibroblast dataset
Our analysis was done using RNA-seq data (GSE113957) from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA). Normalized TMM gene counts per
million for the individual dermal fibroblast cell lines were downloaded from the GEO RNA-seq
Experiments Interactive Navigator (GREIN) (30, 31).

Identification of differentially expressed genes and enrichment analysis
Limma-Voom (32, 33) was used to identify differentially expressed genes between the oldest
(≥80 years, N=33) and youngest (≤10 years, N=14) age groups. Differentially expressed genes
were defined as those with an Adjusted P value <0.05 after multiple testing correction and an
absolute log2Fold Change >1.0. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes was
performed with ToppGene (34).
Correlation analysis
Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the normalized gene counts
of the 21 PRR genes, ACE2 and age, over all 133 samples using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.
Age related interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins
Protein-protein interactions linking differentially expressed genes and SARS-CoV-2 proteins
were identified by overlaying differentially expressed genes in the oldest and youngest age
groups on to the SARS-CoV-2 human protein-protein interaction map reported by Gordon, et al
(18). Network visualization was performed using Cytoscape (35) the NDEx v2.4.5 (36).
