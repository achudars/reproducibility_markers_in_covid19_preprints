Abstract
Objective: The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has become the main target for antiviral and
vaccine development. Despite its relevance, there is scarce information about its evolutionary
traces. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversification patterns of the spike for
each clade of SARS-CoV-2 through different approaches.
Methods: Two thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the
SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary
rate were estimated for the spike genomic region.
Results: The haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few
nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy nine different
haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1,
was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype
(named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V
(70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08 x 10-3 nucleotide
substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of
pandemic was similar for each clade.
Conclusions: In conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant since the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this
protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of
vaccines. Moreover, the evolutionary characterization of clades improves knowledge of
SARS-CoV-2 and deserves to be assessed in more detail since re-infection by different
phylogenetic clades has been reported.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
emerged and shocked the entire world (Zhu et al. 2020). After 10 months of worldwide
circulation, more than 55 million cases and 1.4 million deaths have been reported globally
(WHO, 2020a). Seven genetic clades (S, L, O, V, G, GR, and GH) have been described over
time that are spread throughout different countries (Alm et al. 2020). These clades represent
a challenge for public health as re-infection cases with different clade strains have been
reported (Grupta et al. 2020; To et al. 2020; Van Elslande et al. 2020). In fact, more than 200
candidates for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and several antivirals are already being
developed (Hu et al. 2020; WHO, 2020b). Most of vaccines and therapeutic drugs are directed
towards the spike glycoprotein (S) that is responsible for entering the host cell through
recognition of the receptor ACE2 with the receptor binding protein (RBD) (Alexpandi et al.
2020; Olaleye et al. 2020; Shang et al. 2020; Trezza et al. 2020; WHO, 2020b). Even though
some studies have determined the nucleotide evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 using the
entire genome (Giovanetti et al. 2020; van Dorp et al. 2020), those values are slower and do
not represent the real mutation capacity of the S region alone. Only one study has reported
the nucleotide evolutionary rate of the S genomic region in the first four months of the
pandemic, but without differentiating the seven viral clades, which can be relevant in
therapeutics and re-infections (Pereson et al. 2020). Thus, the aim of this study was to
determine the nucleotide evolutionary rate and the haplotype network of the S region for
SARS-CoV-2 in general and for each of the seven genetic clades during the first nine months
of pandemic.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Datasets
In order to generate datasets representing different geographic regions and time evolution for
each of the seven clades of SARS-CoV-2, from December 2019 to September 2020, data of
complete genome sequences available at GISAID (https: //www.gisaid.org /) on September
2020 were randomly monthly collected for several geographic regions. Data inclusion criteria
were: a.- complete genomes, b.- high coverage level, and c.- human host only (no other
animals or environmental samples). Complete genomes were aligned using MAFFT against
the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (NC_045512.2, EPI_ISL_402125). The resulting multiple
sequence alignments were split in a dataset corresponding to the S region [3,822nt (21,56325,384)] and RBD (included in S) [762nt (22,550-23,311)].

2.2 Phylogenetic and statically analysis / Genetic characterization
Patterns of genetic diversifications for both genomic regions S and RBD for each clade were
analyzed using the median-joining reconstruction method at the PopART v1.7.2 software
(Leigh & Bryant, 2015). Haplotypes shared among all clades were analyzed in Arlequin 3.5.2.2
software (Excoffier & Lischer, 2010). Polymorphism indices were calculated separately for
each clade with DnaSPv. 6.12.01 (Rozas et al. 2017).

2.3 Nucleotide evolutionary rate
The estimation of the nucleotide evolutionary rate for the entire S-coding region datasets were
carried out with the Beast v1.8.4 program package (Suchard et al. 2018) at the CIPRES
Science Gateway server (Miller et al. 2010). The temporal calibration was established by the
samples’ date of sampling. The best nucleotide substitution model was selected according to
the

Bayesian

information

criterion

(BIC)

method

in

IQ-TREE

v1.6.12

software

(Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017). The analysis was performed under a relaxed (uncorrelated
lognormal) molecular clock model recommended previously by Duchene & col., (Duchene et
al. 2020) with an exponential demographic model (Grassly & Fraser, 2008) [23]. Analyses were
run for 8x106 generations and sampled every 8x105 steps. The convergence of the
"meanRate" and “allMus” parameters [effective sample size (ESS) ≥ 200, burn-in 10%] was

verified with Tracer v1.7.1 (Rambaut et al. 2018). The obtained substitution rate was probed
against 10 independent replicates of the analysis with the time calibration information (date of
sampling) randomized as described by Rieux & Khatchikian, 2017 (Rieux & Khatchikian,
2017).

3. Results
3.1 Datasets
Three-hundred sequences were randomly selected for each clade. Two thousand and one
hundred sequences were curated and selected for the analysis. Table 1 shows the SARSCoV-2 sequences included for every month and clade.

3.2 Phylogenetic and statically analysis / Genetic characterization
The haplotype networks (Figure 1) reflect the diversity indices results as a star shape with
multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences that diverge from a common ancestor. In
all cases, the RBD diversification is lower than the spike one, being the lowest for clades S
and V. For the S-coding region, 479 different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed
clades. The number of haplotypes observed among clades ranged from 53 for the V clade to
89 for the GH and GR clades (Table 2). The major haplotype 1 (Hap-1), defined by amino
acids S12, L18, R21, A222, N439, S477, T478, A522, E583, G614, Q675, E780, D936, V1068,
and P1263 was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%). However,
other 10 haplotypes with amino acid changes respect to the Hap-1 were also observed. On
the other hand, haplotype 252 (Hap-252), defined by amino acids L5, L8, H49, V367, A575,
D614, A829, A846, D1084, and A1087 was the most frequent for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%),
S (51.7%), and V (70%). In addition, other 10 haplotypes showed one amino acid change
respect to Hap-252. Table 3 shows the frequency of each haplotype with amino acid changes.
The haplotype diversity was moderate to high in every clade, ranging from Hd = 0.507 to 0.793
(Table 2). In contrast, nucleotide diversity was relatively low for each clade, ranging between
π = 0.0018 for V and π = 0.0040 for O (Table 2). Although overall diversity was similar among
different clades, haplotype and nucleotide diversities were both the lowest for V. On the other
hand, haplotype and nucleotide diversity was higher for G, GH, GR, and O (Table 2). The RBD
region showed indices with a similar trend but with lower values compared to the S region.

3.3 Evolutionary rate
After nine months of pandemic, the estimated evolutionary rate for the S genomic region of
SARS-CoV-2 was 1.08 x 10-3 nucleotide substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) (95% HPD

interval 7.94 x 10-4 to 1.41 x 10-3 s/s/y). Additionally, the nucleotide evolutionary rate for the
different genetic clades ranged between 1.06 x 10 -3 and 1.69 x10-3 s/s/y (Table 4). A daterandomization analyses showed no overlapping between the 95% HPD substitution-rate
intervals obtained from real data and from date-randomized datasets for all clades (Figure 2).
Dataset for the clade L did not reach convergence (ESS<200). To verify the reliability of the
result, 10 independent runs were performed. All of them converged in a similar posterior
distribution. Likewise, for many of the random sample datasets, convergence was not
achieved (ESS between 100 and 200). For those datasets that did not reach convergence,
two independent runs were carried out and concatenated (Lemey et al. 2009).
When the evolutionary rate was analyzed according to the emergence of each clade, founding
clades (L, O, S, and V) tended to present evolutionary rates slightly slower than the more
recent clades (G, GH, and GR), (p = 0.157).

4. Discussion
The evolutionary characterization of spike genomic region of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to
estimate the course that re-infections, vaccines, and therapeutics would have in the
pandemic’s future. In this study, the evolutionary rate of the most important SARS-CoV-2
protein for vaccine development was estimated in general and separately for each genetic
clade described in GISAID. In this context, the spike haplotype network showed a founding
central paternal haplogroups from which multiple sequences with modest changes derived.
Overall, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of pandemic was similar for each
clade.
At the beginning of the pandemic, the most prevalent clades were L, O, V, and S. Later, with
the appearance of the D614G mutation in the S protein, clade G emerged and remained with
a high and stable prevalence. After this initial step, the GR clade has emerged and grown until
it became the most prevalent. Finally, the GH clade peaked at 30% in May 2020 and then
began to decrease (Alm et al. 2020). In this sense, it is important to highlight that clades with
the mutation D614G in the S protein (clades G, GH, and GR) have been suggested to present
a higher transmission efficiency although they would not be associated with a more severe
pathogenesis (Korber et al. 2020).
Therefore, in order to describe the evolution of the S protein variants, the study of haplotypes
network in all seven clades and for both regions (S and RBD alone) was performed. This
analysis showed several identical sequences grouped together resulting in a star-shaped
network, which is characteristic of viral outbreaks (Liu et al. 2020). For the spike, this general
analysis was supported by statistics that show a large number of haplotypes with a small
number of nucleotide changes (low nucleotide diversity). However, for the RBD region, an
increase in identical haplotypes was observed, which translates into a decrease in other
parameters (H, Hd, and Π). This may be due to the conserved nature of the cell receptorbinding region, which is necessary for the infection of target cells. It is noteworthy that the
lowest gene and nucleotide diversities observed for clade V, in both S and RBD, could be the
result of fewer sequences available for this clade during the nine months analyzed here. In
this way, it can be observed that more than 90% of the V clade sequences were distributed in

four months (February to May). On the other hand, the highest nucleotide diversity observed
in clade O is the result of a less clearly defined pattern of mutations (Mercatelli & Giorgi, 2020).
Several amino acid changes detected in the haplotypes present in our analysis are part of the
RBD (V367F, S477N, N439K, T478I, and A522S). From these amino acid changes, positions
367 and 439 were associated with the binding affinity of RBD (Teng et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020).
Additionally, the mutation L5F in the signal peptide was present in 3.3% of members belonging
clade V (Korber et al. 2020). Other changes associated to relevant functions (Korber et al.
2020; Teng et al. 2020) such as H49Y in clade L (associated with monomer stability), A829T
in clade S (fusion peptide), D936Y in clade GH [Heptad repeat 1 (HR1) associated with
monomer stability], and P1263 in clade G (present in the cytoplasmic tail), were also detected
in 1% to 3.4%.
The evolutionary characterization of the wide spectrum of haplotypes contributes to determine
the haplotype significance and its association with disease severity, response to antivirals,
development of vaccines, and host genetic factors.
The evolutionary rate of S protein estimated for all together clades was significantly higher
than that previously reported by analyzing the entire genome (van Dorp et al. 2020; Liu et al.
2020). This is expected since the complete genome includes several genomic regions with a
high degree of conservation, while the S region is one of the most rapidly evolving in the
SARS-CoV-2 genome (Pereson et al. 2020). Nonetheless, the spike evolution rate was quite
similar to that obtained by analyzing this region during the first four months of the pandemic
(Pereson et al. 2020). Although the evolutionary rate of all clades was similar, the founding
clades (L, O, V, and S) showed evolutionary rates slightly lower than the most recent and
currently more distributed ones (G, GH, and GR). This could be endorsed to the spread
process in human populations since they are the most widely disseminated clades around the
world.
This study provides substantial data on the evolutionary process of S protein in the different
clades of a virus that infects a susceptible population where a massive active immunization
process has not yet been carried out. However, as it was aforementioned, the evolutionary
rate of the S region remained stable throughout the nine considered months. In coming
months, this scenario may modify and it would be necessary to re-evaluate the results from

this study. In fact, a new clade named GV was described last months (Hadfield et al. 2018).
The inclusion in the study of only 2,100 of the 73,393 available sequences on September 2020
is a limitation that imply a bias in the obtained results, although the sequence selection process
was carefully carried out in order to generate a representative dataset from different time
courses and a wide geographic range.

5. Conclusions
Since the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the entry in the host cell and is the target for
most therapeutic candidates, it is essential to know the way this genomic region is evolving,
given that changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response
to antivirals, and efficacy of vaccines. On this basis, the results obtained in this work about the
evolutionary rate of the spike protein during the first nine months of pandemic are very
significant. Furthermore, the evolutionary study of each separate clade ads to the virus
knowledge and deserves to be assessed in more detail since re-infection by a different
phylogenetic clade has been reported.
