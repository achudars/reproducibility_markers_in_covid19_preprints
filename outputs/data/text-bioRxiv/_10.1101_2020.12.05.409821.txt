Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the likelihood of future coronavirus pandemics, has
rendered our understanding of coronavirus biology more essential than ever. Small
molecule chemical probes offer to both reveal novel aspects of virus replication and to
serve as leads for antiviral therapeutic development. The RNA-biased amiloride scaffold
was recently tuned to target a viral RNA structure critical for translation in enterovirus 71,
ultimately uncovering a novel mechanism to modulate positive-sense RNA viral
translation and replication. Analysis of CoV RNA genomes reveal many conserved RNA
structures in the 5’-UTR and proximal region critical for viral translation and replication,
including several containing bulge-like secondary structures suitable for small molecule
targeting. Following phylogenetic conservation analysis of this region, we screened an
amiloride-based small molecule library against a less virulent human coronavirus, OC43,
to identify lead ligands. Amilorides inhibited OC43 replication as seen in viral plaque
assays. Select amilorides also potently inhibited replication competent SARS-CoV-2 as
evident in the decreased levels of cell free virions in cell culture supernatants of treated
cells. Reporter screens confirmed the importance of RNA structures in the 5’-end of the
viral genome for small molecule activity. Finally, NMR chemical shift perturbation studies
of the first six stem loops of the 5’-end revealed specific amiloride interactions with stem
loops 4, 5a, and 6, all of which contain bulge like structures and were predicted to be
strongly bound by the lead amilorides in retrospective docking studies. Taken together,
the use of multiple orthogonal approaches allowed us to identify the first small molecules
aimed at targeting RNA structures within the 5’-UTR and proximal region of the CoV
genome. These molecules will serve as chemical probes to further understand CoV RNA
biology and can pave the way for the development of specific CoV RNA-targeted
antivirals.
Introduction
A new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was
reported in November 2019 from Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of
the COVID-19 respiratory disease, the largest scale respiratory virus pandemic the world
has witnessed since the 1918 Spanish flu1 and that has claimed more than 1.4 million
lives worldwide.2 Coronaviruses (CoV family) generally cause mild flu-like symptoms3 in
humans but have caused two smaller scale pandemics in the last two decades: SARSCoV (2003) and MERS (2012)4. Recent phylogenetic mapping traced all human
coronaviruses to animal origins.5 While the middle zoonotic carrier of the virus between
the animal of origin and humans seem to vary between CoVs, the chronological surfacing
of human CoV pandemics seems to follow a dangerous trend of increasing lethality of
each pandemic, thereby underscoring the need to a better understanding and targeting
of the current and future CoV etiologic agents.
After more than a year since the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 human infection, this virus is
expected to remain a global threat until vaccines are available and adopted worldwide.
While recent treatments have been approved for use within hospital settings,6 there are
no known FDA approved cures for the infection. Current candidates for treatment have
limited approval for emergency use in severe COVID-19 cases. Remdesivir, for example,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.05.409821; this version posted December 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (RdRp) initially developed during the
Ebola outbreak and revisited at the start of the pandemic.7 The compassionate use of the
candidate antiviral across many countries reported mixed results, with overall faster
recovery time from the virus but no difference in mortality rates.8 While more randomized
trials are needed for a final verdict on the efficacy of Remdesivir in critical patients, its
stereospecific multi-step synthetic process highlights the need for new, scalable and more
efficacious antivirals. Baricitinib has been recently approved for emergency use for
COVID-19 treatment in conjunction with Remdesivir. Also known as Olumiant, this small
molecule was approved in 2018 as treatment for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.9
It is proposed that the anti-inflammatory effects of the drug help in decreasing
inflammatory cascades associated with COVID-19. While promising, Baricitinib has yet
to receive approval as a stand-alone treatment and, so far, has been shown to improve
recovery time by one day when compared to Remdesivir alone treatment.6 Overall,
SARS-CoV-2 is not the first and, most likely, will not be the last CoV pandemic. The
current limited tools and lack of novel cures underscore the need for a new approach in
developing antivirals that would not only provide novel routes to combat the current
pandemic but also provide invaluable information on targetable structures that can aid in
the prevention of and fight against future CoV outbreaks.
Several steps in the coronavirus replication cycle offer potential therapeutic targets for
viral inhibition (Figure 1). Coronaviruses are enveloped positive single-stranded RNA
genomes of approximately 30 kilobases, making them the largest genomes of RNA
viruses.4 SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by engagement of the ACE2 receptor by the
viral spike (S) protein followed by membrane fusion at the plasma membrane or
endosomal membranes depending on the availability of host cell proteases that cleave
and prime S for entry. Fusion results in the release of its positive sense genome and
associated proteins in the host cell cytosol. The genome is translated into two large
polyproteins, 1a and 1b, which are then processed into individual proteins by the viral
protease. Synthesis of full length negative strand RNA by products of 1a/1b creates a
template to synthesize multiple positive strand copies encapsidated by the viral
nucleoprotein into virions.4 The negative RNA strand also serves as a template for the
synthesis of shorter sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNA) that include the essential structural
proteins and thus also constitute an attractive therapeutic target.10

binding the ACE2 receptor and releasing its positive-sense RNA genome. The virus
exploits the host machinery to facilitate efficient viral replication, which ultimately leads to
progression of infection.11

CoV antivirals to date have been developed to target viral proteins, including to prevent
endocytosis, assembly of viral protein for export, and condensation of viral genome for
packaging.12 While this protein-centric approach has proven successful in a few cases,
the sequence and structural conservation of RNA structural motifs pose an attractive
complementary target13 for small molecule antiviral development, a strategy that has
shown promise against a plethora of viruses.14 Recently published data on genome-wide
secondary structure of the virus obtained by in vitro and in vivo SHAPE 15-17 and DMS1719
probing on SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells, as well as NMR characterization,19
recapitulates the computationally predicted stem loops (SL) at the 5’ region of the genome
(Figure 2) as well other relevant frameshifting and replication-related structures.
Conserved elements at the 5’ and 3’-ends have been identified across many members of
the coronavirus family and function as cis acting elements regulating viral replication.20
Specifically, studies on murine and bovine coronaviruses showed that phylogenetically
conserved stem loops in the 5’-UTR are capable of long-range RNA-RNA and proteinRNA interactions responsible for optimal viral replication.21,22 More recently, studies
aimed at uncovering the pathway that leads to viral protein synthesis via host cell
translation machinery revealed that the presence of the full length 5’-UTR of SARS-CoV2 leads to a five-fold increase in translation of viral proteins. This preliminary data
corroborates the importance of the 5’-UTR region, and the structures within, for efficient

viral translation and provides context for the viral hijacking of the host cell translational
machinery.23

Drug-like small molecules offer the ability to develop chemical probes that reveal function
and to design bioavailable clinical candidates for treatment. While RNA targeting has
lagged behind protein targeting, recent successes in both the laboratory and the clinic
support its potential role. The first US FDA approved small molecule targeting RNA other
than the ribosome was approved for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in August of
2020.24 Effective small molecule targeting in the laboratory has also been observed for a
plethora of disease relevant RNAs, including viral RNAs. Specifically, small molecules
targeting structures within the 5’-UTR region have shown antiviral activity for a number of
positive-sense RNA viruses such as HCV25, FMDV26, and EV71.27 At the same time,
recent studies have begun evaluating the potential of small molecules against the
frameshifting elements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the coding region. These recent studies
include evaluation of known SARS-CoV pseudoknot binders28 as well as development of
a small molecule binder to the attenuator hairpin preceding the pseudoknot.29 Coupling
of the latter to the known ribonuclease targeting chimera (RIBOTAC) technology results
in recruitment of cellular ribonucleases leading to viral genomic RNA degradation. While
the anti-replicative activity of these molecules has not been published, these preliminary
results, combined with known RNA-targeted antivirals for other positive sense RNA
viruses, stand as proof-of concept of the targetability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA motifs.
Successful efforts to target viral 5’-UTR structures have often leveraged the synthetic
tuning of a known RNA binding scaffold.25, 27, 30 We recently employed this approach to
develop RNA-targeted antivirals based on dimethylamiloride (DMA) that target the
internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) region in the 5’-UTR of EV71. The DMA scaffold had
been previously reported to be poised for tuning for specific RNA constructs via a facile
three-step synthesis.31 Further investigation and functionalization of the scaffold resulted

in a bioactive antiviral analogue that formed a repressive ternary complex with IRES stem
loop II RNA and the human AUF1 protein, ultimately inhibiting translation and
compromising viral replication. The successes in DMA exploration highlight the scaffold’s
potential for tuning as well as broad applicability as an antiviral scaffold.31 Herein we
report DMA analogues that show promising antiviral properties by reducing SARS-CoV2 viral titer in a dose-dependent manner in infected Vero E6 cells. In addition, dual
luciferase reporter assays confirmed the antiviral activity of the small molecules to be
dependent on the 5’-UTR and proximal region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Investigation
of possible conserved RNA binding sites of the lead small molecules revealed putative
bulge-like binding sites in stem loops 4 and 5a, located in the 5’-UTR of the SARS-CoV2 genome, as well as in the adjacent stem loop 6 located in ORF1a, supporting both the
targetability of 5’-region stem loops and the combination of interdisciplinary methods used
here as a promising approach to novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 small molecules.
Results
I. Phylogenetic conservation of RNA structural elements
As the functional significance of the 5’-end stem loops (SLs) is still being elucidated, we
examined sequence conservation in the 5’-end region across the Betacoronavirus genus
as a preliminary approach to assessing the suitability of the known structures in this region
as therapeutic targets. We constructed a multiple sequence alignment spanning the
5’UTR and the adjacent region including representatives of all five betacoronavirus
subgenera (Figure 3). Alignments disclosed the highest degree of conservation in the
region encoding SLs 2-3, both of which are relatively short and contain stretches of 5-6
nucleotides that are 100% conserved. By contrast, SL1 and SLs 4-6 are less conserved,
but notably, four of the five SLs that span the 5’UTR contain stretches of relatively highly
conserved nucleotide sequence (i.e. 70-100% conservation across the genus). The
position of these SL’s within or adjacent to the 5’UTR (which is relatively conserved in
length across all betacoronaviruses) indicates these conserved regions are likely to
represent homologous nucleotides and suggests they are to some degree functionally
equivalent.

We pursued targeting of the 5’-end stem loop structures with the DMA scaffold, which has
been previously reported as an RNA binding scaffold that can be successfully optimized
for selectivity for distinct RNA elements.31 To quickly assess potential CoV antiviral
activity, human OC43 betacoronavirus was used due to its lower virulence and thus
suitability for use in standard cell culture facilities.3 Vero E6 cells were infected with
human coronavirus OC43 at an MOI=1. After a one-hour adsorption, a panel of twentythree DMAs at 50 µM or 100 µM were added to the cells and incubated for 24 hours at
33°C. Virus titers were determined by plaque formation on Vero E6 cells, and DMA-132,
-135, and -155 (Figure 4) reduced virus titer by ~ 1,000-fold at 100 µM concentration
(Figure S1). The same experiments were repeated three times with DMA-132, -135, and
-155 and shown to be reproducible (Figure S2). The results further suggest DMA-132, 135, and -155 reduce virus titer in a dose-dependent manner. The parent scaffold,
dimethylamiloride (DMA-1), demonstrated no activity and is used as an inactive control
moving forward.

To determine the antiviral activity and potency of the lead small molecules against SARSCoV-2 we utilized a simplified Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA levels
in supernatants of infected Vero E6 cells.32 Similar to Remdesivir, DMA-135 and 155 led
to a dose dependent 10-30-fold decrease in cell-free viral RNA levels within 24 hours of
infection with an approximate IC50 of 10 and 16 µM, respectively (Figure 5).

Antiviral activity of the two most active DMA leads (DMA-132 and -135) was confirmed
using Vero E6 cells infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2; DMA-155 was not tested. Small
molecule treatment was performed at 10 µM and 50 µM, respectively. DMA-132 and 135
showed significant dose-dependent reduction in viral titer compared to DMSO, as
measured by median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, without measurable
effect on cellular viability as measured by ATP content (Figure 6). Notably, DMA-132 and
135 have improved activity when compared to DMA-01, the parent scaffold, thereby
corroborating the potential for synthetic tunability of DMAs for SARS-CoV-2 targeting.

Figure 6. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by DMA leads without significant cellular
toxicity: VeroE6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.1) in the presence of DMSO
or the indicated compounds for 3 days followed by TCID50 measurement of viral titer in
culture supernatant (black bars). Results were generated with two independent experiment,
each with two replicates. Cellular viability was assayed by measuring cellular ATP content
in uninfected VeroE6 cells after 3 days of treatment with the indicated compounds (grey
bars).

DMA-132, 135, and 155 were tested for longer term (96 hour) toxicity in Vero E6 cells.
Small molecules do not significantly reduce cell viability < 10 µM, supporting a potential
therapeutic window, though more extensive cytotoxicity studies are warranted. In
particular, Figure S3 shows the CC50 of DMA-132 and -135 in Vero E6 cells were > 100
µM. CC50 of DMA-155 was about 90 µM.
IV. Investigation of small molecule activity against CoV-2-luciferase reporter gene
expression

To assess the effect of DMAs on reporter gene expression directed by SARS-CoV-2
sequence elements, a reporter plasmid, pCoV2-5′UTR-FLuc-3’UTR was used as
template for in vitro synthesis of CoV-2-5′UTR-FLuc-3’UTR RNA (Figure 7A). This
plasmid contains the 5’-end 805 nucleotide (nt) segment from the virus genome and the
3’UTR. Thus, the 805 nt segment spans the genomic RNA 5’UTR (SL 1-5) and ORF1a
encoding a portion of nsp1 (including SL 6-8) fused in-frame with the firefly luciferase
ORF. Plasmid pRL was used as template for the synthesis of control Renilla luciferase
reporter RNA lacking SARS-Cov-2 sequences. The RNAs were co-transfected and
various concentrations of DMAs were added with the transfections. Two days after
transfection, RLuc and FLuc activities were measured using a dual-luciferase reporter
assay. As shown in Figure 7A, addition of 10 µM DMA-132 or -135 reduced FLuc activity,
which is under the control of SARS-CoV-2 5’-end and 3’UTR, by approximately 50%.
Addition of 10 µM DMA-155 reduced FLuc activity by ~ 90%. FLuc activity was reduced
90% with 100 µM of DMA-132, -135 or -155. Activities of the control RLuc remained
relatively constant for all DMAs across all concentrations tested; this control indicates that
decreases in FLuc were not simply due to any putative cytotoxic effects. To test whether
the CoV-2 3’UTR contributes to DMA-mediated translational repression, we repeated the
experiment using a FLuc reporter, CoV-2-5’UTR-FLuc RNA, in which the CoV-2 3’UTR
was replaced with vector-encoded sequence; thus, the CoV-2 5’-ends of both FLuc
reporter RNAs are the same (Figure 7B). The effects of DMAs on translational repression
were virtually identical to those in Figure 7A. Importantly, these results clearly
demonstrate that DMA-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 luciferase reporter
activity requires only 5’-end sequences of the virus.

V. NMR Profiling of 5’-Stem loop-DMA interactions
Towards understanding potential mechanisms by which the DMAs inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication, we carried out single-point 13C-1H TROSY HSQC titrations of DMA-132, -135
and -155 into stem loops 1-6 (SL1-6) of the 5’-region. We reasoned that the DMAs
selectively bind the 5’-region stem loops at non-canonical structural elements such as
bulge, internal or apical loops. Therefore, we in vitro transcribed isolated SL domains
using 13C/15N rNTPs that would maximize NMR signal detection for the non-canonical
elements over the base paired regions (Figure S5). For example, SL1 was prepared as
a C(13C/15N)-selectively labeled construct because cytosines are the most abundant
nucleobases within its apical and internal loops. Using this strategy, we are able to
efficiently profile each 5’-region SL to determine if the DMAs bind with reasonable affinity
and specificity. Figure S5 summarizes the effects that the addition of excess (5:1) DMAs
have on the NMR spectra of each major SL domain. First, we observed that the DMAs
induced differential chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) for each SL with the largest CSPs
observed in spectra recorded for SLs 4, 5a and 6 (Figure 8). Each of these 5’- domains
contain large internal loops. Second, only a subset of the 13C-1H correlation peaks is
perturbed in the spectra providing evidence that the DMAs interact through specific
surfaces of the 5’-region. Third, the extent of the CSPs are also differential with some
DMAs inducing shifts of the correlation peaks to new positions within the spectra, and
others inducing complete broadening of the NMR signals. These variable CSPs reveal
that the DMAs interact with different binding affinities and binding modes. Of note, none
of the DMAs caused significant changes to spectra recorded on SL2, which contains a 5nt CUUGU apical loop. Taken together, the single-point 13C-1H TROSY HSQC titrations
provide compelling evidence that the DMAs make specific interactions with the SARSCoV-2 5’-region via surfaces composed of non-canonical structural elements.

Figure 8. Single-point 13C-1H TROSY HSQC titrations reveal DMA-132 -135 and -155 bind with moderate
affinity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2 5’-region stem loops. The spectra were recorded at 900 MHz in
100% D2O buffer of 25mM K2HPO4, 50mM KCl at pH 6.2. Temperatures (298, 303 or 308K) were
optimized for each RNA construct to maximize the number of observed correlation peaks. The total RNA
concentrations were set to 100 µM while titrating 5-fold excess DMA.

VI.
In silico ligand screening of DMA focused library against 5’-UTR and
adjacent RNA structures
To generate potential 3D models of each SL, we used Fragment Assembly of RNA with
Full-Atom Refinement (FARFAR). We chose FARFAR to generate preliminary models as
it has consistently been demonstrated to be the most accurate RNA 3D prediction
algorithm.33 We generated between 5,000 and 100,000 models for each SL and then
generated ~10 representative clusters.
The lowest energy conformation of each cluster was used to generate an ensemble for
each SL that was submitted to ICM pocket finder to find and characterize possible binding
pockets (Table S1). Notably, SL2, which showed no change in 13C -1H HSQC NMR
chemical shifts upon small molecule addition, did not have any identifiable binding pocket.
SLs 1, 3, and 5b presented binding pockets with low to intermediate scores in terms of
volume, area, hydrophobicity, burriedness and druggability score (DLID) parameters
often used to describe a binding pocket’s fitness. These three structures presented minor
chemical shift perturbations upon small molecule addition. 13C-1H TROSY HSQC NMR
experiments showed significant changes upon small molecule binding to SL4, SL5b and
SL6 (Figure 8), all of which had the highest scores in all parameters (Figure 9). Most
importantly, the structure that presents the highest chemical shift perturbations upon
binding to the small molecule leads, SL6, is the only SL to have a binding pocket with
positive DLID score (0.45, Table S1). DLID score has been found as a good predictor of
druggability of protein binding pockets34 but often presents highly negative scores in RNA
due to the charged backbone of RNA.35 Overall, this binding pocket analysis strongly
correlates with NMR experimental data.

We then docked our published 55 member DMA library against the clustered FARFARgenerated stem loop structures (Figure S6-S11). In line with the results from the pocket
analysis and NMR experimental data, the overall number of hits across constructs is
highest for SL4, SL5a, and SL6, corroborating their potential as therapeutic targets. Hit
ligands DMA-132, 135, and 155 were among the top predicted binding ligands.
Furthermore, if the docked structures are limited to the sub-library of DMAs tested against
OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 the three hit ligands score in the top 5 of every stem loop.
Notably, when analyzing the binding location that yielded the best docking scores of the
three hit molecules against SL6 we note that while DMA 135 and 155 bind best in one
binding pocket (Figure 9C in blue), DMA 132 docks best in the adjacent binding pocket
(Figure 9C red). When comparing the NMR profiles of the three small molecules we note
that DMA 135 and 155 have a similar perturbation pattern, while DMA 132 has a slightly
different profile, suggesting a possible different binding mode. This trend is recapitulated
with SL5a where all three hits dock in three separate but adjacent binding pockets (Figure
9E,F) and, while all three perturb some common signals, all three molecules have a
distinct NMR profile. While preliminary, this docking analysis corroborates the NMR data
and the fitness of these ligands for SARS-CoV-2 5’-stem loop targeting and supports its
utility as a tool in the identification of new SARS-CoV-2 RNA-targeting ligands.

Discussion
Screening of synthetic RNA-focused libraries in recent years has provided the field with
many RNA-binding bioactive small molecules and some of the highest hit rates among
small molecule screening approaches.36 Amiloride, a known RNA-binding scaffold, has
been synthetically tuned for a range of RNA secondary structures and recently yielded a
novel antiviral lead for the treatment of enterovirus 71. In this case, amiloride inhibited
viral translation by binding the viral 5’-UTR and modulating RNA:host protein interactions.
SARS-CoV-2 also contains a highly conserved 5’-end37 that is reported to play a crucial
role in viral replication and hijacking of host cell translational machinery. The presence of
multiple bulge or internal loops, the secondary structural elements that amilorides have
been reported to bind most effectively, makes the 5’-UTR and the adjacent SL6 ideal
therapeutically relevant targets for small molecule probing. An initial DMA focused library
screen against OC43-infected Vero E6 cells allowed for the identification of three lead
compounds, namely DMA-132, -135, and -155 that significantly reduced viral titer. Initial
structure-activity relationships could also be resolved, highlighting the critical substitution
of the dimethylamine group at the C5 position and rigid aromatic substituents at the C6
position. These molecules were also found to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in both
screening-format qRT-PCR assays and authentic antiviral titers. Luciferase assays
revealed the presence of the 5’-UTR and proximal region as necessary and sufficient for
translation inhibition upon small molecule treatment.

NMR profiling of leads DMA-132, -135 and -155 against each of the major 5’UTR and
adjacent stem loop domains revealed that the DMAs bind preferentially to SLs that
contain large internal or bulge loops. Notably SL6, which contains a moderately
conserved and weakly paired ~16-nt bulge loop, showed the most significant CSPs when
titrated with DMAs. Interestingly, the 5’-side of the SL6 bulge loop has been proposed to
interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein under phase separation
conditions and may also impact genome packaging.38 We will investigate the modulation
of the N protein:SL6 interaction as a potential antiviral mechanism in future work.
Finally, in silico analysis corroborated the experimental trend observed with NMR
experiments, identifying some of the stem loops with predicted bulges (SL4, SL5a, SL6)
as those with binding pockets with highest druggability. Furthermore, the small molecules
that showed highest antiviral activity, namely DMA-132, -135, and -155 scored highest in
the stem loops that reported significant chemical shift perturbations upon small molecule
binding.
Summary and Outlook
In summary, we herein identified drug-like small molecules that reduce SARS-CoV-2
replication and are the first antivirals to target the conserved RNA stem loops in the 5’end region of SARS-CoV-2. Work is underway to further characterize the mode of action
of these ligands, particularly putative impacts on RNA:protein interactions and specific
steps in the viral replication cycle. Once characterized, we expect these amiloride-based
ligands to serve as chemical biology tools to help understand CoV RNA molecular
biology, such as N-dependent genome packaging and other cellular stages of the viral
RNA replication process. Importantly, we have established an efficient framework to
identify novel RNA-targeted CoV antivirals that will serve not only the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic but future coronavirus pandemics.
Materials and Methods
Analysis of sequence conservation
Representative betacoronavirus sequences were selected according to official taxonomy
as represented by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses.39 Multiple
sequence alignments of coronavirus sequences were constructed using BLAST40] and
MAAFT41 as implemented in GLUE.42 Alignments were manually inspected and adjusted
using Se-Al. Position coverage and percentage identity were calculated and visualized
using JalView.43
Cells and virus
Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney; ATCC CRL-1586) cells were cultured in MEM
medium supplemented with 10% FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific) and maintained at 33°C.
Cells were infected with human coronavirus OC43 (ATCC VR-1558) at indicated MOI
(multiplicity of infection) and incubated 1 hr at 33°C for adsorption. Unbound virus was
removed, and cells were refed fresh medium with various concentrations of DMAs. Media
from infected cells were harvested 24 hrs post-infection, and virus titers were determined

by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 strain; BEI Resources)
was propagated and titered on VeroE6 cells, with sequence confirmation of a P2 stock to
confirm stability of the viral genome.
Effects of SARS-CoV-2 5’- and 3’-end sequence elements on luciferase reporter
activity
The reporter plasmid pCoV-2-5′UTR-FLuc-3’UTR contains the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR and
adjacent coding sequences in ORF1a fused in-frame with the firefly luciferase open
reading frame, followed by the SARS-CoV-2 3’UTR. For plasmid pCoV-2-5’UTR-FLuc,
the Cov-2 3’UTR as replaced with vector-encoded sequence. The plasmids were kindly
provided by Dr. Shin-Ru Shih (Chang-Gung University, Taiwan; manuscript submitted).
Plasmid pRL, the Renilla luciferase control reporter vector, was purchased from Promega.
CoV-2-5’UTR-FLuc-3’UTR, Cov-2-5’UTR-FLuc, and RLuc RNAs were in vitro
synthesized from these plasmid templates using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit
(ThermoFisher Scientifc).
Vero E6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates. Two hundred ng of reporter RNA, 5µl of
SuperFect (Qiagen), and 400µl of MEM with 10% FBS were combined and added to one
well of cells. Cells were incubated at 33°C for 4 hrs and media were changed and various
concentrations of DMAs were added. Two days after transfection, IRES activity was
determined by measuring Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and firefly luciferase (FLuc) activities
using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Cytotoxicity assays
Various concentrations of DMAs were added to Vero E6 cells in culture. The cells were
incubated at 33°C for 96 hrs. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and measured
at 570 nm according to the manufacturer’s instructions (EMD Millipore). All experiments
were performed in triplicate. The concentration of DMAs required to reduce cell viability
to 50% of the control cells was expressed as CC50.

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assays
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants was performed using a
simplified RT-qPCR assay as explained before.32 In brief, Vero E6 cells were infected
with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 i.u./cell in 96-well plates, virus inoculum was removed
1 hour post-adsorption and replaced with media containing serial dilutions of the DMA
compounds. 5 µL of cell culture media containing released virions were collected at 24
hpi and processed as detailed in previous studies.32 Viral RNA levels were quantitated by
RT-qPCR using primers specific to SARS-CoV-2 N gene and a standard curve derived
from in vitro synthesized RNA encoding N.
In addition, antiviral activity was tested against SARS-CoV-2 using a TCID50 assay,
VeroE6 cells were seeded at 1 x 105 per well in a 24-well plate at 37˚C for 24 hours. Cells
and samples were then transferred to a Biosafety Level 3 facility. Stocks of SARS-CoV-2
were diluted in DMEM/2% FBS for a solution of 20,000 pfu/mL. Growth media was

aspirated from 24-well plates and replaced with 495 µL of DMEM/2% FBS containing
20,000 pfu/mL SARS-CoV-2 for an M.O.I. of 0.1. 5 µL of DMSO or compound were then
immediately diluted into each well for final concentrations of 50 µM and 10 µM. Plates
were incubated at 37˚C for 72 hours. Media was then harvested, centrifuged at RT for
10‘ at 1,500 x g, then used for TCID50 assay. Serial dilutions of supernatant from the
treated cells were added to VeroE6 cells in 96 well plates and cells are monitored for
cytopathic effect (CPE). Viral titer was calculated from the numbers of positive wells using
a modified Reed and Muench method.

Synthesis and purification of RNA stem loop constructs present at 5’-end
SL1 through 6 of the 5’-end were in vitro transcribed using a standard protocol,44, 45 from
synthetic DNA templates from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The 3-6 ml
reactions involved the use of purified recombinant T7 RNA polymerase expressed in
BL21 (DE3) cells. Depending on the labeling scheme of each RNA, double labeled, 13C
and 15N, rNTPs and unlabeled rNTPs were utilized in the reaction. Nucleotide labeling of
the SLs was based on the abundance of nucleotides in bulges and loops. The labeling
pattern was as follows: SL1 C(13C,15N)-labeled, SL2 U(13C,15N)-labeled, SL3 AU(13C,15N)labeled, SL4 A(13C,15N)-labeled, SL5a AU(13C,15N)-labeled, SL5b AU(13C,15N)-labeled,
and SL6 AC(13C,15N)-labeled.
Next, the SLs were purified on denaturing gels, ranging from 8 to 16%, and extracted
using electroelution. After desalting with a Millipore Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter, the
RNAs were annealed by heating for 2 min at 95 °C and flash-cooled on ice. The samples
were thoroughly washed and concentrated down with a 100% D2O buffer of 25mM
K2HPO4, 50mM KCl at pH 6.2. Using the NanoDropTM 2000 software (Thermo Fisher),
the theoretical extinction coefficients of the SLs were calculated in order to determine
RNA concentrations. Samples for NMR titrations contained 100µM of RNA in D2O buffer
with a final volume of 200µL.
NMR profiling of DMA interactions with 5’ end structures
A 900 MHz spectrometer was used to record all NMR data. The 1H-13C HSQC titrations
were recorded with 100 µM of selectively labeled SL1 through 6 in a 100% D2O buffer of
25mM K2HPO4, 50mM KCl at pH 6.2 with a 200µL sample volume. Titrations of the DMA
molecules into the different SLs were collected at a molar ratio of 5:1, DMA to RNA, at a
temperature of either 298, 303, or 308K. For each construct, temperature optimization
experiments were done in order to determine the optimum temperature to conduct the
titrations with. The NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipie/NMRDraw46 and
analyzed with NMRView47 J or Sparky48

Virtual Ligand Screening against SARS-CoV-2 5’-end RNA structures
FARFAR model generation

FARFAR is part of the Rosetta 3 software package can be obtained for free academic
usage (https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download). Each SL was
generated through the following protocol.
rna_helix.py is a python wrapper for the Rosetta executable rna_helix. rna_helix.py is
available in $ROSETTA/tools/rna_tools/bin, where $ROSETTA is the Rosetta installation
path. Below are the commands to generate SL1.
rna_helix.py -seq gguu aacc -resnum 1-4 24-27 -o helix_1.pdb
rna_helix.py -seq acc ggu -resnum 8-10 17-19 -o helix_2.pdb
For each helix in a SL other than the nucleotides that flank bulges and loops we prebuild
as idealized A-form helices with the above commands. Modeling helical residues as
idealized A-form significantly reduces computational time allowing for more models to be
built.
FARFAR modeling is performed through the rna_denovo executable.
rna_denovo -nstruct 1000 -s helix_1.pdb helix_2.pdb -fasta input.fasta -secstruct_file
input.secstruct -minimize_rna true -out:file:silent farfar.out
where -nstruct is the max number of models requested, -fasta is the path of a fasta file
containing the RNA sequence, -secstruct is the path of a file (input.secstruct) containing
the RNA secondary structure in dot-bracket notation, -minimize_rna true minimizes the
RNA after fragment assembly, -s specifies the path to the pdb files that contain static
structures of our helices, and -out:file:silent specifies the output file path to store all
generated models. Each SL was run on 100 cores for 24 hours, the number of
generated models is reported in table FARFAR (Table SX).
To reduce the number of models to dock against we performed fixed-width clustering
using the rna_cluster executable.
rna_cluster -in:file:silent farfar.out -nstruct 15 -cluster:radius RADIUS
Where -in:file:silent is a silent file of all models for a given SL, -nstruct is the max
number of clusters requested, and -cluster:radius is max distance in heavy-atom RMSD
between members of the same cluster.
Small molecule docking
Virtual docking simulations were performed using ICM49 (Molsoft LLC. La Jolla, CA).
employing the SARS-CoV-2 5’-UTR structures obtained from FARFAR modeling and
clustering. RNA structural elements’ binding pockets were defined using ICM Pocket
Finder module and all the small molecules protonation states were adjusted to pH=7.0
using ChemAxon© (www.chemaxon.com). RNA ensembles were then combined into
conformational stacks using ICM’s “impose conformations.” Then, to create “flexible
receptors” to dock against that would reflect all of the conformations of each structure,
ICM’s “create 4D grid” function was used for each docking project. Each of the structures

was then docked against a library of 55 DMA molecules. The DMA library was saved
in .sdf file format, which was indexed for VLS using ICM-Pro. The virtual screening
simulation was implemented with a conformational search and optimization with a limit of
10 conformers per molecule. The thoroughness was left at level 10.
