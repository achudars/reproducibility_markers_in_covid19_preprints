Abstract
The results of experimental investigations of the effect of high-intensity
pulsed UV radiation on the influenza virus type A (H1N1) are presented. The
research methodology is developed and the structure of the experiments is
described. An end-face plasma accelerator was used as a radiation source, which
provides a power pulsed discharge in an open atmosphere. The high efficiency of
inactivation of the infectiousness of the virus was shown within a short period of
time. The possibility of providing urgent 100% sterilization of a viral infection has
been shown for the first time. A model for calculating the efficiency of pulse
sterilization has been developed. The prospects for the application of pulse
sterilization technology to combat coronavirus infection are considered.
Introduction
The large-scale pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has largely
updated research in the development and creation of methods and means of antiepidemic protection of the population. Along with pharmacological agents and
vaccination, physical methods of antiviral antibacterial treatment of the human
environment, based on the use of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, open up broad
prospects [1-4].
The vast majority of UV sources of continuous radiation flux have a number
of fundamental disadvantages due to their low power. So, for example, the power
flux density created by the most widespread mercury germicidal lamps is of the
order of milliwatts per square centimeter [5]. This leads to a significant increase in
the duration of the process of antiviral and / or antibacterial processing, which is
caused by the need to accumulate a bactericidal dose of UV radiation required to
achieve a given level of sterilization. And, what is more dangerous, prolonged
exposure to low intensity is to a certain extent mutagenic, which leads to the
formation of a clinical infection in the case of bactericidal microflora, or to the
preservation of residual virulence of the treated infectious environment [6,7].

In such conditions, the advantages of pulsed UV radiation of high and ultrahigh power levels are manifested, providing the effect of complete destruction of
bactericidal microflora and viruses. For the first time, the effect of 100%
sterilization was considered in [8-10].
This paper presents the results of an experimental study of the antiviral
efficiency of a pulsed source of broadband UV radiation based on an open
discharge in the atmosphere at the exit of an end-face plasma accelerator.
1. Preparing the experiment
1.1. Cultivation and preparation of cells
Cells were grown in sterile plastic flasks (Sarstedt, Germany) in a nutrient
medium consisting of 45% DMEM (Sigma, USA), 45% RPMI 1640 (Sigma,
USA), and 10% fetal calf serum (FBS) (Sigma, USA), inactivated by heating for
30 min at T = 56°C and the antibiotic gentamicin (100 μg/ml). The cells were
passaged until a monolayer was formed, namely, they were disintegrated from the
surface of the vials using 0.02% Versen solution (BioTestMed, Ukraine) and
0.025% trypsin solution (BioTestMed, Ukraine), resuspended in a nutrient
medium, after which their concentration in the suspension was brought to (2− 2.5)
×105 cells/ml. The seeding ratio was established after counting the number of cells
in the Goryaev chamber using an inverting microscope (Carl Zeiss Jena, Germany)
with a magnification of 70x. After that, a cell suspension in a volume of 200 μl
was introduced into the wells of a 96-well plate of the scanner, and then the plates
with cells were cultured in a thermostat at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. After
24 h of cultivation, the state of the cell monolayer in the plates was monitored
using a microscope. For the research, we used samples in which the formation of
cells of about 90% of the monolayer was observed in the absence of bacterial and
fungal contamination. In all other cases, cells were excluded from the study. A
mixture of 50% DMEM (Sigma, USA) and 50% RPMI 1640 (Sigma, USA) was
used as a supporting medium for the cells.
1.2. Preparation of virus
The studies used influenza virus type A (H1N1) strain A / FM / 1/47, obtained
from the collection of the State Institution of the Institute of Epidemiology and
Infectious Diseases named after L.V. Gromashevsky NAMS of Ukraine. The virus
was cultured in an MDCK cell culture and stored in aliquots at -70°C.
A monolayer of cells in 650 ml vials for 24 hours of growth was washed with
sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH = 7.4), after which the virus was introduced
into the cell medium in an amount sufficient to cover the monolayer at a dilution of
1:10000. Then, after adsorption for 1.5 h at room temperature, the required amount
of a supporting medium and cells with viruses were added, incubated at 37°C for 4
− 5 days until an intense cytopathic effect (CPE) appeared. To isolate the virus
from the cellular material, 3-fold freezing-thawing was carried out until the cells
were completely destroyed, and the cell detritus was removed by centrifugation at
3000 rpm for 30 min. Finally, the titers of the virus in the supernatants were

determined using the MTT method; the blanks were poured into cryovials of 1–5
ml and stored at T = -70˚C. In the study, a virus pool with a titer of 5×106
TCID50/ml was used.
1.3 Pulse radiation source
An end-type plasma accelerator was used as the radiation source, which
forms a plasma-dynamic discharge in an open atmosphere. As is known, in such
sources with a high-current discharge, the current exceeds 105 A and the brightness
temperature is about 15000 K [11]. The large energy input in the mode of
microsecond pulses provides the value of the plasma flow enthalpy, which is much
higher than the values achieved in other sources. The radiation power in the
bactericidal band of the spectrum was about 1-10 MW, which makes it possible to
implement the radiation dose necessary for the complete destruction of the
infection during one pulse at a distance of tens of centimeters from the emitter [810].
The brightness temperature of plasmodynamic radiation sources is
proportional to the square of the current; therefore, in the design of the radiator, a
busless circuit was used to minimize parasitic inductance [12,13]. The block
diagram of the installation is shown in Fig. 1.

In fig. 2a shows a photograph of the discharge taken through an optical
ultraviolet filter with a transmission band of 300 − 400 nm. As a result of image
processing, the temperature distribution of the emitting region can be obtained
(Fig. 2b) and the directivity characteristics of the radiation source can be estimated,
similarly to [14].

2. Experiment and Results
The virus suspension in the cultivation medium was introduced into dishes,
which were divided into 4 groups, and in the open state were placed in the
irradiation zone of a pulsed UV radiation source (Fig. 3), after which they were
irradiated. The radiation pattern of the emitter is close to uniform in the
hemisphere, so each cup received the same radiation dose per pulse. Each of the
groups of cups was irradiated with 1, 5, 10, and 16 UV pulses, respectively.
Control sample - control virus (CV) was not exposed to radiation. Subsequently,
the titers of infectivity of the control and experimental (exposed to irradiation)
samples were investigated. For this, a 1-day 100% monolayer of sensitive cells was
grown in a 96-well plate, which were infected with tenfold serial dilutions of the
control and irradiated virus samples, 50 μl per well. The adsorption of the virus
was carried out at a temperature of 37°C for 2 hours, after which 150 µl of the
supporting medium was added to the wells. Cells not infected with the virus were
used as control cells. Plates were incubated for 3 days in an atmosphere of 5% CO2
at 37°C until the appearance of pronounced CPE of the virus in the control sample.
Crystal violet C25N3H30Cl was used for coloring. The absorption
coefficient was measured using a Multiskan FC flatbed spectrophotometer

(ThermoScientific, USA) at a wavelength of 538 nm. Using the measured values of
optical density, the percentage of inhibition of cell viability under the influence of
the virus (or % CPE of the virus on cells) was determined by the formula:
% inhibition of vitality or % CPE = 100 – (А×100/В),

(1)

where A is the average optical density of the sample, and B is the average
optical density of the control cells.

Fig. 3. Experiment scheme
After that, the dilution of the virus was determined, which reduces the optical
density of the sample under study compared to the optical density of the control
cells by 50%, which is the titer of the virus and is expressed in TCID50/50 μl.
Multiplying the obtained value by 20, the titer of the virus in 1 ml − TCID50/ml
was determined, and then, expressing the obtained value in logarithms, the
generally accepted expression of the titer of the virus logTCID50/ml was
calculated.
The calculation of the index of suppression of the virus reproduction under
the influence of radiation was carried out according to the formula:
logTCID50/ml of control virus
Inhibition index =

(2)
logTCID50/ml of irradiated virus

According to the effectiveness criteria, a decrease in the virus titer less than
1.25 is considered a relative effect, from 1.5 to 2.0 − a moderate effect, and more
than 2.0 − a pronounced antiviral effect [15]. The results of the measurements and
calculations are presented in table 1.
The experimental dependence of the H1N1 virus inhibition index on the
number of pulsed exposures is shown in Fig. 4.
As can be seen from the results of the study, as a result of irradiation with 1
pulse, the titer of the influenza virus significantly decreased (inhibition index

1.57), which corresponds to a sterilization efficiency of about 94%. After exposure
to 5 or more pulses, the virus completely lost its infectivity, that is, the effect of
complete sterilization is provided.

4. Discussion
When simulating the effect of continuous UV radiation, it is also assumed
that the photobiological reaction of microorganisms and viruses is cumulative, as a
result of which the bactericidal effect is determined by the radiation dose.
Analytical models describing the dependence of bactericidal efficacy on the
radiation dose are asymptotic in nature [16]. Sterilization efficiency, which is equal

to the ratio of the number of microorganisms N s that survived after irradiation
during exposure t, to their initial number N 0 may be calculated
I = N s N 0 = e − at .

(3)

Formula (3) is usually written as

log I = −kH bac ,

(4)

to show the dependence of bactericidal efficacy on the dose of radiation. The
parameter k [m2/J] included in (4) characterizes the rate of sterilization and is
determined by the power of the radiation source and the resistance of the irradiated
microorganisms [17]. As can be seen, formula (4) expresses the Bouguer-WeberFechner law, which establishes a connection between physical impact and the
reaction of a biological object [18].
Sterilization is a threshold effect, i.e. complete destruction of pathogenic
microflora and/or viral infection occurs as a result of exposure to radiation, the
dose of which is equal to H th . Thus, as follows from (3), (4) in a continuous mode
to achieve a dose H bac = H th , the exposure time is infinite t = ∞
In the pulse mode, an expression for describing the kinetics of bacterial and
viral populations under UV irradiation is described by the formula
dn = −bdt ,

(5)

whence the bactericidal efficacy for the pulsed regime follows
I = N s N 0 = 1 − bt p .

(6)

Here, the parameter b characterizes the duration of exposure at which
complete destruction of the irradiated microorganisms takes place, and depends on
the power of the radiation source, t p is the exposure time in the pulsed mode.
Thus, according to [17], the parameter k in the model (4) determines the slope of
the logarithmic curve of bactericidal efficiency.
Formulas (3), (4) and (6) make it possible to estimate the gain in processing
time, which is provided in the pulse mode

In fig. 5 a comparison of the exposure required for complete sterilization in
continuous and pulsed modes is shown.
In the pulsed mode, the concentration of energy in a short time interval
excludes the cumulative virucidal effect characteristic of continuous low-power
exposures, and, more importantly, allows the required dose to be provided during
one pulse. The action of a single pulse with a duration of tp = 30 μs provides a
sterilization efficiency of about 94%. Complete sterilization is achieved with 5
pulses. Thus, the value of the gain (7) is v p ≈ 14222. In the calculations, we used

k = 0.15 m2/J, H bac0.94 = 10 J/m2 [17.19], and the power of a continuous source
Pr = 30 W, r = 1 m.

Fig.: 5. Comparison of exposure in continuous and pulsed modes
Calculations and experimental measurements of the exposure time required
to inactivate coronavirus infection seem to be very relevant today. The data on the
resistance of viruses to UV radiation are very contradictory. For example, the
known results of dose measurements of 99.9% inactivation of the SARS virus
belonging to the same family as SARS-CoV-2 is 10–20 mJ/cm2 [20]. In [21], for
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the average dose of UV radiation, which provides a
bactericidal efficiency of 90%, is H bac = 67 J/m2. On the other hand, in [22] the
value of the threshold dose of UV radiation H bac = 36144 J/m2 is given, at which
the destruction of SARS-CoV-2 with an efficiency of 99.999% is provided.
Naturally, such significant discrepancies in the experimental data indicate the need
for additional research. At the same time, such doses can be realized using one or
several exposures of a pulsed radiation source used in this work.

Conclusions
The results of the development and creation of a source of pulsed optical
radiation based on a plasmodynamic system that forms a high-current discharge in
an open atmosphere are presented. With such discharges, the power flux in the
bactericidal band of UV radiation significantly exceeds the values that can be
realized with the help of other sources of ultraviolet radiation.

Experimental studies of high-intensity pulsed UV radiation for influenza
H1N1 virus have been carried out. Shown is the effect of reducing the level of
infectivity of the virus during a short period of treatment. The basic principles of
the mechanism of pulsed bactericidal and antiviral effects have been developed.
For the first time, the effect of complete inactivation of a viral infection
under pulsed irradiation was obtained. The possibility of significant inhibition of
viruses as a result of exposure to a single pulse of UV radiation with duration of 30
μs has been experimentally shown. The infection was completely inactivated by
repeated pulsed irradiation. The results obtained open up broad prospects for the
development of a pulsed technology for fighting infections, in particular, the
development and creation of radiation sources that ensure the destruction of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus.
