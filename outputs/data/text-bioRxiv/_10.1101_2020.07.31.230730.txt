ABSTRACT
The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a devastating impact across the world. SARSCoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral
surface spike (S) protein to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor
expressed on many human cell types. The RBDACE2 interaction is a crucial step to mediate the
host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARSCoV-2 S protein has higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of
SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the biophysical
mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is unclear. This study utilizes a combined
single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation approach
to quantify the specific interactions between CoV-2 or CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the
loading rates, the unbinding forces between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range from 70 to 110 pN, and
are 30-50% higher than those of CoV-1 RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results
indicate that CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90 of ACE2. This interaction
is mostly absent in the CoV-1 RBDACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra RBDN-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and prolonged interaction lifetime. The
observation is confirmed by our experimental force spectroscopy study. After the removal of Nlinked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar
level of the CoV-1 RBDACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism behind
the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and could aid in the
development of new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
This study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular
dynamics simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or
SARS-CoV-1 receptor-binding domain and human ACE2. The study reveals the mechanism

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused
by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). First reported in
Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread to the entire world and become
a devastating pandemic. As of now, there is no FDA-approved antiviral or vaccine for COVID-19.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the family
Coronaviridae (2). They are classified in four genera (α, β, γ, and δ). Both SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1 (which caused the 2002-2004 outbreak) belong to the β-CoV genus. The genomes
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 share 76% sequence identity (2). Both genomes encode four
structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The M protein
maintains the viral lipid membrane integrity. The E protein facilitates assembly and release of the
virus and the N protein encapsulates and protects the viral genome (3).
The S protein (∼150 kDa) is a heavily N-linked glycosylated homo-trimer projecting 20
nm from the surface of the CoV (3). The trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein and
mediates attachment to the host receptor. The S1 portion contains the large receptor-binding
domain (RBD), and S2 portion forms the stalk of the spike molecule. The atomic structures of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein in a trimeric form (4) as well as the RBD-receptor complex have been
determined (5). These structures are similar to the previously reported structures of SARS-CoV-1
S protein (6-8), indicating that the two proteins might function in a similar fashion.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The major physiological function of ACE2 is to hydrolyze angiotensin
II (a vasoconstrictor) into angiotensin-(1-7) (a vasodilator) , and thereby to lower blood pressure
(9, 10). ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein expressed in a wide variety of organs including
the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestine (11, 12). Recent structural studies show that ACE2 is a

homodimer with each monomer consisting of an N-terminal peptidase domain, a C-terminal
Collectrin-like domain, a single-pass transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic region (8).
The RBD binding region on ACE2 is located in its N-terminal peptidase domain with major contact
regions located in the α1 and α2 helixes, as well as the linker between β3 and β4 strands (8).
The binding interactions between ACE2 and CoV S proteins have been widely studied
recently. Although there are variations among different binding assays reported, majority of
reports show that a higher binding affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S compared to the
binding between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-1 S (13, 14). However, the mechanism behind such
difference is still unclear. In addition, little is known about the biomechanical strength of ACE2S interaction that drives viral adhesion and helps withstand the force exerted during viral entry.
In this work, using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force
spectroscopy, a method where a single bond rupture (i.e., interaction) between two molecules can
be measured directly, we have quantified the mechanical strengths between ACE2 and SARSCoV-1 RBD (shortly RBDCoV1) or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (shortly RBDCoV2). As AFM can measure
forces in the pico-Newton (pN) range, it is possible to detect inter-molecular forces, and allow for
weak interactions between tip-bound ligands and surface-bound receptor molecules to be
quantified in terms of their affinities and rate constants (15). Furthermore, AFM has been recently
adopted by us and others to study the interactions between viruses and host cells (16-18). We also
used all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations to pull the RBDCoV1-ACE2 or
RBDCoV2-ACE2 complexes with or without N-glycans. Both AFM and SMD confirmed a stronger
force/energy associated with the dissociation of RBDCoV2-ACE2 complex, and that this enhanced
mechanical strength stems from an additional interaction of RBDCoV2 with an N-linked glycan of
ACE2 Asn90.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression
Immortalized HEK 293T cells purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
were cultured in DMEM medium (ATCC), and supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine, 4500 mg/L
glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1500 mg/L sodium bicarbonate, 1% penicillin streptomycin, and
10% fetal bovine serum. RBD proteins were expressed as previously described with some
modifications (19). Briefly, genes encoding SARS-CoV-1 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins
containing a C-terminal Fc tag were amplified by PCR using codon-optimized SARS-CoV-1 or
SARS-CoV-2 S plasmid, and inserted into a human Fc expression vector (Invitrogen). The proteins
were expressed in HEK293T cells, and purified by protein A affinity chromatography (GE
Healthcare).

Cantilever preparation/ coverslip preparation
To functionalize AFM cantilevers (MLTC, Bruker Nano) with RBD, the cantilever was
first silanized with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate to obtain surface thiol groups.
RBDCoV1, RBDCoV2, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (RBDMERS-CoV, as a
negative control) were immobilized onto a (3-aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane sinalized AFM
cantilever (MLTC, Bruker Nano) using a heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG)
crosslinker, Acetal-PEG-NHS (Creative PEGworks), according to the protocol developed by Dr.
Hermann J. Gruber, Johannes Kepler University (17). Soluble recombinant ACE2 (ACRO
Biosystems) was attached to the silanized glass coverslips using the same crosslinking approach.
Functionalized cantilevers and glass surfaces were stored in PBS (3 × 5 min) and used for AFM
experiment within 8 hours.

Single-molecule force measurements
All single-molecule force measurements were conducted using a custom-designed AFM
apparatus. AFM measurements were collected at cantilever retraction speeds ranging from 0.19 to
7.5 µm/s to achieve the desired loading rate (5,000-20,000 pN/s). All measurements were
conducted at 25C in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The contact time and indentation force
between the cantilever and the sample were minimized to obtain measurements of the unitary
unbinding force.

To enable measurement of a single molecular interaction, the contact between the
cantilever tip and the substrate was minimized by reducing both the contact duration (<50 ms) and
the compression force (100-200 pN). The brief contact duration was chosen to ensure that, for the
majority of contacts (67% or greater), no adhesion (rupture force) was observed between AFM tip
and surface. Assuming the adhesion bond formation obeyed Poisson statistics, an adhesion
frequency of ~33% in the force measurements implies that among the observed unbinding events,
the probabilities of forming a single, double, and triple adhesion bonds between AFM tip and
surface were 81%, 16%, and 2%, respectively (20). Therefore, our experimental condition ensured
there was a >80% probability that the adhesion event was mediated by a single bond (21).

Statistical analysis
For each pulling speed, over 500 force curves were recorded, which yielded 40 to 200
unbinding forces. Curve fitting was performed using IGOR Pro or Origin software by minimizing
the chi-square statistic for the optimal fit. Unless otherwise stated, the data is reported as the mean
and the standard error of the estimate. Statistical analyses between groups were performed using
an unpaired t-test or ANOVA, with a p-value less than 0.05 considered to be statistically
significant.

Steered molecular dynamics simulation
All SMD simulations were performed using NAMD (22) The CHARMM36(m) (23, 24)
force field was used for protein and carbohydrates. PDB ID 2AJF (6) from Protein Data Bank was
used for an RBDCoV1-ACE2 complex structure and PDB ID 6VW1 (5) for an RBDCoV2-ACE2
complex structure. We used a TIP3P water model (25), and K+ and Cl- ions with a concentration
of 0.15 M were added to neutralize the system. All simulation systems and parameters were set up
through CHARMM-GUI Solution Builder (26, 27). Analysis were done with CHARMM (28) and
visualization through VMD (29).
PDB:6VW1 has five N-linked glycans in ACE2 (Asn53, Asn90, Asn103, Asn322, and
Asn549) and one N-glycan in RBDCoV2 (Asn343), and PDB:2AJF has four N-linked glycans in
ACE2 (Asn53, Asn90, Asn322, and Asn549) and one N-glycan in RBDCoV1 (Asn330). Similar to
other crystal or cryo-EM structures, all N-glycan structures in both PDB structures are incomplete,
as they are truncated in experiment or not observable due to low resolution and high structural

flexibility. Since we did not know glycoforms of the ACE2 glycosylation sites at the time of this
study, we used the N-glycan core pentasaccharide (a minimum structure of all N-glycans: Fig. S1)
in all N-glycosylation sites including Asn103 of ACE2 in PDB:2AJF. Glycan Reader & Modeler
(30-32) in CHARMM-GUI was used to model N-glycan core pentasaccharide in all glycosylation
sites using the templates from GFDB (33) (Glycan Fragment Database). To compare the receptorbinding affinity between RBDCoV1 and RBDCoV2 and to explore influences of N-glycans on binding
affinity, we made four systems: SCoV1+G (RBDCoV1-ACE2 with N-glycans), SCoV1-G (RBDCoV1ACE2 without N-glycans), SCoV2+G (RBDCoV2-ACE2 with N-glycans), and SCoV2-G (RBDCoV2ACE2 without N-glycans).
For the SMD simulations, the protein complex structures were initially aligned along the
X-axis in a cubic water box with an initial size of 171 Å for SCoV1±G and 172 Å for SCoV2±G; a total
number of atoms is about 470,000. The pulling forces were applied to the center of mass (COM)
of each protein (i.e., RBD and ACE2). In the pulling process, the spring constant was set to 5
kcal/mol/Å2 and its moving speed to 0.5 Å/ns in the opposite directions along the X-axis. Gentle
restrains with a force constant of 5 kcal/mol/Å2 were applied to each protein’s COM to restrict
their movement along the Y/Z directions during the pulling process. The SMD simulations stopped
at 30 ns when two proteins were detached from each other. 9 independent simulations for each
system were performed for better statistics.
The van der Waals interactions were smoothly switched off over 10-12 Å by a force-based
switching function (34). The electrostatic interactions were calculated by the particle-mesh Ewald
method with a mesh size of 1 Å for fast Fourier transformation and sixth order B-spline
interpolation. SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bond lengths involving hydrogen atom (35)
and the simulation time-step was set to 2 fs. We first relaxed the system in an NVT (constant
particle number, volume, and temperature) ensemble at 303.15 K with harmonic restraints to all
solute atoms. The constant temperature was controlled by Langevin dynamics with a damping
frequency of 50 fs-1. 100-120 ps NPT (constant particle number, pressure, and temperature)
simulation was then applied to adjust the solvent density. The Langevin piston method was used
to control the pressure. A dihedral restraint with a force constant of 1 kcal//mol/rad2 was applied
to carbohydrates to keep the carbohydrate chair conformation during these equilibration steps. To
perform the SMD simulation, a COLVARS method was used (36), and the COMs of two proteins
were calculated first and used as the external forces’ initial positions. The effective spring potential

the selected protein COM, and n is the unit vector along the protein COMs. As a result of this
spring potential, the spring-connected protein would move following the energy well, so that two
proteins are pulled apart.

RESULTS
RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds ACE2 stronger compared to SARS-CoV-1
First, we characterized the mechanical interaction between the RBD of SARS-CoV S
proteins and ACE2 using AFM. We have attached RBDCoV1, RBDCoV2, or RBDMERS-CoV (negative
control) to a micro-cantilever, the force probe, via an established protocol using polyethylene
glycol coupling chemistry (17, 18). The cantilever-bound RBD was controlled to interact with
surface-immobilized soluble ACE2 via AFM force scans (Fig. 1A).

system. The micro-cantilever is functionalized with RBD. Soluble human ACE2 is immobilized on the
opposing surface using established protocols. (B) The upper panel shows two sample AFM pulling traces of
the RBDCoV2-ACE2 interaction. The first (upper) trace had no interaction and the second (lower) trace
shows the rupture force of the protein-protein complex. Fu is the unbinding force. ks is the system spring
constant that is derived from the slope of the force-displacement trace. ks is used to derive the loading rate
for individual unbinding events. The lower panel illustrates the four stages of stretching and rupturing of a
single RBD-ACE2 complex using the AFM. (C) Interaction specificity was shown by the adhesion
frequency measurement for different interacting pairs. Contact force, contact time, and retraction speed for
all the interacting AFM tip and surfaces were set at 150 pN, 0.1 s, and 3.7 μm/s, respectively. Error bars are
Poisson errors (i.e., the square root of the adhesion number). (D) The dynamic force spectra (i.e., the plot of

All single-molecule force measurements were conducted using a custom-built AFM
designed for operation in the force spectroscopy mode (38-42). Using a piezoelectric translator,
the functionalized cantilever was lowered onto an ACE2-functionalized surface to allow possible
binding between RBD and ACE2 to occur. After a brief contact, the cantilever was retracted from
the surface. Any binding interaction between tip and substrate would lead to an adhesive pull-off
force determined from the deflection of the cantilever via a position-sensitive two-segment
photodiode. (Fig. 1A and 1B, lower panel). Fig. 1B shows two typical pulling traces. The first
(upper) trace represents a majority (65-70%) of all the pulling curves, showing no interaction (i.e.,
no adhesive force) between the AFM tip and sample surface. The second (lower) trace,
representing approximately 30% of the pulling curves in our single-molecule assay, shows the
unbinding (i.e., pull off) force of the tip-substrate interaction. The unbinding force (Fu) of the
receptor-ligand complex is derived from the force jump that accompanies the unbinding of the
complex. ks is the system spring constant derived from the slope of each pulling trace.
Interaction specificity was shown by the adhesion frequency measurement under the same
measurement conditions. Fig. 1C shows a significant decrease in adhesion when either RBDCoV1,
RBDCoV2, or ACE2 was absent, confirming that the vast majority of the recorded unbinding forces
stemmed from specific interactions. RBDMERS-CoV and BSA were used here as negative control
proteins, as RBDMERS-CoV does not bind ACE2 and its known receptor is dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(43).
The biophysical properties of RBD-ACE2 interactions were studied by the means of a
dynamic force spectrum (DFS), and the results are shown in Fig. 1D. The DFS is the plot of most
probable unbinding force as a function of loading rate. The loading rate is obtained by multiplying
the system’s spring constant (Fig. 1B) and the pulling speed of each force curve. The unbinding
forces of each RBD-ACE2 interactions were first grouped into 5 groups by their loading rates. The
distribution of forces within the same group was analyzed by histograms (see inset for one example
in Fig. 2D). The most probable unbinding forces were then determined from the modes of each
histograms. Fig. 2D shows that the unbinding force of both RBD-ACE2 complexes increased
linearly with the logarithm of the loading rate. However, the unbinding forces of RBDCoV2ACE2
are stronger, ranging from 70 to 110 pN over a loading rate of 5,000 to 20,000 pN/s, whereas the
RBDCoV1ACE2 unbinding forces are 30-50% lower under similar loading rates.

A more detailed analysis of the biophysical properties of RBD-ACE2 interactions was
conducted by fitting the acquired DFS data to the Bell-Evans model. The model describes the
influence of an external force on the rate of bond (i.e., complex) dissociation (44). According to
this model, a pulling force (F) distorts the intermolecular potential of a ligand-receptor complex,
leading to a lowering of the activation energy and an increase in the dissociation rate k(f) (or a
decrease of bond lifetime t(F)) as follows:
1

𝐹𝛾

𝑘(𝐹) = 𝑡(𝐹) = 𝑘 0 exp (𝑘 𝑇)

(1)

B

where k0 is the dissociation rate constant in the absence of a pulling force, γ is the position of the
transition state, T is the absolute temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. For a constant
loading rate (𝑟𝐹 ), the model can be described as:
𝐹∗ =

𝑘𝑏 𝑇
𝛾

𝛾

ln (𝑘 0 𝑘 𝑇) +
𝑏

𝑘B 𝑇
𝛾

ln(𝑟𝐹 )

(2)

Hence, as predicted by the model, the most probable unbinding force F* is a linear function of the
logarithm of the loading rate. Experimentally, F* was determined from the mode of the unbinding
force histograms. Fitting the DFS of RBDCoV2ACE2 interaction to the Bell-Evans model (Eq. 2)
yielded a k0 of 0.15 s-1, and a γ (i.e., activation barrier width) of 0.33 nm. The best-fit parameters
for RBDCoV1ACE2 are tabulated in Table 1. Clearly, compared to RBDCoV2, RBDCoV1 binds
ACE2 with a 12-fold larger k0 and the same γ, indicating that the RBDCoV2ACE2 interaction is
stronger with a much slower dissociation rate.

simulations on the following four systems: SCoV1+G (RBDCoV1-ACE2 with N-glycans), SCoV1-G
(RBDCoV1-ACE2 without N-glycans), SCoV2+G (RBDCoV2-ACE2 with N-glycans), and SCoV2-G
(RBDCoV2-ACE2 without N-glycans). To compare RBDCoV2-ACE2 interactions with RBDCoV1ACE2 interactions, pulling force analysis was performed as a function of distance (DRBD-ACE2)
between the COMs of RBD and ACE2. In addition, to investigate how many residues between
RBD and ACE2 interact as a function of DRBD-ACE2, the number of contacts analysis was performed,
where a contact was counted if any heavy atom of RBD was within 4.5 Å from any heavy atom of
ACE2.
As shown in Fig. 2A, the overall force profile of SCoV2+G shows higher forces than SCoV1+G
due to greater numbers of RBDCoV2-ACE2 contacts compared to RBDCoV1-ACE2 (Fig. 2B).
Initially, SCoV2+G has more contacts than SCoV1+G and the difference in the number of contacts
between SCoV2+G and SCoV1+G is about 20 at DRBD-ACE2 of 52 Å (Fig. 2B). The difference decreases
to about 17 starting from 55 Å and to 9 at 65 Å, where ACE2 Asn90-glycan maintains its
interactions with RBDCoV2, whereas such interactions are lost in SCoV1+G (Fig. 2C). Note that the
force profile in SCoV2+G has a plateau around 60 Å and a small peak around 66 Å, which are
attributed to the interactions between ACE2 Asn90-glycan and RBDCoV2 from 55 Å to 65 Å (Fig.
2C). Because of relatively negligible interactions between ACE2 Asn90-glycan and RBDCoV1, the
plateau is not observed around 60 Å in SCoV1+G. This indicates that the interaction between ACE2
Asn90-glycan and RBDCoV2 somewhat blocks the direct contact between RBDCoV2 and ACE2 at
55 Å < DRBD-ACE2 < 65 Å, suggesting that ACE2 Asn90-glycan can hinder the association of
RBDCoV2 to ACE2 more than RBDCoV1, but makes RBDCoV2 -ACE2 dissociation harder than
RBDCoV1 -ACE2.
Using SCoV2+G as an example, the overall RBD and ACE2 dissociation during the pulling
simulation can be divided into three states: state I (<55 Å, Fig. 2D), state II (56~70Å, Fig. 2E, F),
and state III (>70 Å, Fig. 2G). In state I, RBDCoV2 -ACE2 has a number of interactions. As DRBDACE2

increases to 56 Å (state II), RBDCoV2 and ACE2 start to lose some of its polar interactions

(RBDCoV2-ACE2: Gln493-Glu35 and Tyr449-Asp38), but the interaction between Gln498 and
Glu42 is intact. Note that ACE2 Asn90-glycan has polar interactions with Gln409 and Thr415
(Fig. 2E). At 65 Å (Fig. 2F), Asn487 and Try489 of the RBDCoV2 loop can still interact with ACE2
Tyr83 and Gln24 due to flexibility of the loop, and Asn487 can also contact Gln24 time to time.
At this period, Asn90-glycan loses its contacts with RBDCoV2. In state III, RBDCoV2 and ACE2 are

fully detached with no close interactions (Fig. 2G). While the average forces show a subtle
difference in between SCoV1+G and SCoV1-G when RBDCoV1 and ACE2 start to detach at DRBD-ACE2
= 56 Å (Fig. S2A), SCoV2+G clearly has higher forces over 56 Å to 70 Å than SCoV2-G (Fig. S2B).
And, RBDCoV2 shows slightly higher forces than RBDCoV1 even with no glycans, although the

In light of the SMD results, we tested the effect of ACE2 N-linked glycan on the
mechanical strength of RBD-ACE2 interactions. To remove the ACE2 N-linked glycans, surfaceimmobilized ACE2 was incubated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) for one hour at 37 C.
The effect of PNGase F treatment was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). After one hour of
treatment, the molecular weight of ACE2 was visibly reduced from approximately 115 to 95 kDa.
Assuming each N-linked glycosylation adds 2.5 kDa of molecular mass, the result is consistent
with seven N-glycosylation sites on ACE2.

Next, AFM unbinding experiments were performed between tip-immobilized RBD and
surface immobilized, PNGase F-treated ACE2. As shown in Fig. 3B, N-linked glycan removal
resulted in a significant decrease of the unbinding forces between RBDCoV2 and ACE2, from 70110 pN to 30-60 pN. The unbinding forces between RBDCoV1 and ACE2 also decreased, but to a
lesser extent. The DFS of RBDCoV2 and RBDCoV1 are almost overlapped with each other. This trend
is also similar to the SMD results, showing that the force profiles of SCoV1-G and SCoV1-G are within
the error bars t (Fig. S2C). The Bell-Evans model fit confirmed that after N-glycan removal, the
k0 of RBDCoV2ACE2 interaction increase by 105 fold (from 0.15 s-1 to 15.8 s-1), whereas the k0
of RBDCoV1ACE2 interaction increase by only 7 fold.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Interactions between viral protein and host receptors require direct physical contact
between viral and host cell membranes. Unlike interactions in solution (3D), which have at least
one interacting molecular species in the fluid phase, the interactions between receptors and ligands
anchored on two opposing membranes (2D) are constrained in molecular movement or transport
and are under common tensile force. Hence, the 2D reaction kinetics are oftentimes different from
3D kinetics (45, 46). In order to study the mechanism underlying virus-cell interaction, therefore,
it is necessary to probe the interaction between anchored molecules using 2D binding assays such
as the single-molecule AFM used in this study. Using this method, we found that the dissociate
rate for RBDCoV2ACE2 and RBDCoV1ACE2 bonds (or interactions) are significantly different.
The one order magnitude slower dissociation rate could partially account for the greater infectivity
of SARS-CoV-2.
The Bell-Evans model allows estimation of bond lifetime at different constant pulling
forces. Taking the lifetimes and barrier position parameters from Table 1, we compared the
lifetime time of RBD-ACE2 bonds as a function of force (Fig. 3C). At no force, the lifetime of a
RBDCoV2ACE2 bond is estimated to be 6.7 s, and is approximately one order of magnitude longer
than the lifetime of a RBDCoV1ACE2 bond. Under pulling forces, the lifetimes of both bonds
decrease exponentially with force, though the ~10 fold difference between the two bonds remains.
This indicates that compared to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 can stay much longer on an ACE2
expressing surface due to stronger RBD-ACE2 binding. After N-glycan removal on ACE2, the
unstressed lifetime of both RBDCoV2ACE2 and RBDCoV2ACE2 bonds decreases to 0.06-0.07 s,
suggesting that N-glycans may be required for stable SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 much more
than SARS-CoV-1.
Using the k0 values from Table 1, we were able to estimate the activation energy
differences among different scenarios. Estimates of the energy difference between the transition
states were calculated as G12 = kBT ln(k1/k2) where k1 and k2 are the dissociation rate constants
of transition of two interactions used for comparison, respectively. Using this equation, the
activation energy barrier for RBDCoV1ACE2 bond dissociation is estimated to be 2.5 kBT lower
than that of the RBDCoV2ACE2 bond. After deglycosylation of ACE2, the activation barrier
heights are lower by 4.6 (RBDCoV2) and 2 kBT (RBDCoV1), compared to the binding of glycosylated
ACE2.

SMD simulations provide molecular-level insight into RBDCoV-ACE2 interactions and
help us to interpret the AFM data. The SMD simulations manifest that RBDCoV2 interacts stronger
with ACE2 than RBDCoV1 because the former has more direct contacts with ACE2 than the latter.
In particular, ACE2 Asn90-glycan appears to have an important role in having stronger
interactions with RBDCoV2 than RBDCoV1 by retaining contacts with residues of RBDCoV2, Gln409
and Thr415, even when the original contacts of RBDCoV2-ACE2 start to lose (Fig. 2E). This
additional interaction implies that ACE2 Asn90-glycan can have effects on association and
dissociation of RBDCoV2-ACE2. In other words, ACE2 Asn90-glycan could hinder the association
of RBDCoV2 with ACE2 more than RBDCoV1, but make RBDCoV2 -ACE2 dissociation harder than
RBDCoV1 -ACE2. In addition, based on the SMD simulations, we propose a three-step dissociation
mechanism of RBDCoV2-ACE2 complex.
It should be noted that the current models utilize only RBD out of trimeric SARS-CoV-2
S protein and the N-glycan core structure for all N-glycans. Having a fully-glycosylated SARSCoV-2 S protein and ACE2 models would provide further insight into the RBD-ACE2 interactions.
With a recently modeled fully glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein model (47) and recentlydetermined glycosylation patterns of ACE2 (48), we plan to study the RBD-ACE2 interactions in
a more realistic model.
In conclusion, the study shows the biomechanical parameters important for CoV to attach
to host cells. Our results reveal important viralhost cell interaction through ACE2 Asn90-glycan,
which could be a potential target for antiviral intervention.
