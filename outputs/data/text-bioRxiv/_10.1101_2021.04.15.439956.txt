ABSTRACT

20

To confront the global threat of coronavirus disease 2019, a massive number of the severe acute

21

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences have been decoded, with the

22

results promptly released through the GISAID database. Based on variant types, eight clades have

23

already been defined in GISAID, but the diversity can be far greater. Owing to the explosive increase

24

in available sequences, it is important to develop new technologies that can easily grasp the whole

25

picture of the big-sequence data and support efficient knowledge discovery. An ability to efficiently

26

clarify the detailed time-series changes in genome-wide mutation patterns will enable us to promptly

27

identify and characterize dangerous variants that rapidly increase their population frequency. Here,

28

we collectively analyzed over 150,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand their overall features

29

and time-dependent changes using a batch-learning self-organizing map (BLSOM) for

30

oligonucleotide composition, which is an unsupervised machine learning method. BLSOM can

31

separate clades defined by GISAID with high precision, and each clade is subdivided into clusters,

32

which shows a differential increase/decrease pattern based on geographic region and time. This

33

allowed us to identify prevalent strains in each region and to show the commonality and diversity of

34

the prevalent strains. Comprehensive characterization of the oligonucleotide composition of SARS-

35

CoV-2 and elucidation of time-series trends of the population frequency of variants can clarify the

36

viral adaptation processes after invasion into the human population and the time-dependent trend of

37

prevalent epidemic strains across various regions, such as continents.

INTRODUCTION

44
45

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rampantly

46

worldwide since it was first reported in December 2019, and its momentum is still ongoing (WHO.

47

2020). To address the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in detail, genome sequencing has been performed on a

48

global scale and published by GISAID (Elbe et al. 2017), the SARS-CoV-2 genome database, having

49

more than 780,000 viral sequences as of March 2021 (https://www.gisaid.org/). SARS-CoV-2 is an

50

RNA virus with a fast evolutionary rate that has already been classified into eight clades by GISAID,

51

and epidemics caused by new variant have been known to occur (Benvenuto et al. 2020; Gorbalenya

52

et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020; Hu et al. 2021; Kirby 2021; Wang et al. 2021). Because the number of

53

registered genome sequences is increasing explosively, it has become difficult to cope with the

54

current and future situation using only the conventional phylogenetic tree method based on multiple

55

sequence alignment, which requires an enormous amount of computation time for a massive number

56

of sequences. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a sequence alignment-free method that will

57

enable us to easily grasp the whole picture of the big-sequence data and support efficient knowledge

58

discovery from it.

59

By focusing on the frequency of short oligonucleotides (e.g., tetra- and penta-nucleotides) in a

60

large number of genomic fragments (e.g., 10 kb) derived from a wide variety of species, we have

61

developed an unsupervised explainable AI (batch-learning self-organizing map; BLSOM), which

62

enables separation (self-organization) of the genomic sequences by species and phylogeny and

63

explains the causes that contribute to this separation (Abe et al. 2003 ). In the analysis of genomic

64

fragments of a wide range of microbial genomes, over 5 million sequences can be separated by

65

phylogenetic groups with high accuracy (Abe et al. 2020).

66

In a prior analysis of all influenza A strains, viral genomes were separated (self-organized) by host

67

animals based only on the similarity of the oligonucleotide composition, although no host

68

information was provided during BLSOM learning (Iwasaki et al. 2011). On a single map, all viral

69

sequences could be separated, and notably, BLSOM is an explainable AI that can explain diagnostic

70

oligonucleotides, which contribute to host-dependent clustering. When studying the 2009 swine-

71

derived flu pandemic (H1N1/2009), we could detect directional time-series changes in

72

oligonucleotide composition because of possible adaptations to the new host, namely humans

73

(Iwasaki et al. 2011), showing that near-future prediction was possible, albeit partially (Iwasaki et al.

74

2013).

75

We have previously revealed lineage-specific oligonucleotide compositions for a wide range of virus

76

lineages and established a method to identify and classify viral-derived sequences in tick intestinal

77

metagenomic sequences (Qiu et al. 2019). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed time-series

78

changes in mono- and oligo-nucleotide compositions and found their time-dependent directional

79

changes that are thought to be adaptive for growth in humans, which allowed us to predict candidates

80

of advantageous mutations for growth in human cells (Ikemura et al. 2020; Wada, Wada & Ikemura.

81

2020; Iwasaki Abe & Ikemura. 2021). Furthermore, we recently performed BLSOM analysis on di- to

82

penta-nucleotide compositions in approximately 150,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Because the

83

accuracy of separation by clade increased as the oligonucleotide length increased, in this report, we

84

present the BLSOM results for the pentanucleotide composition. BLSOM could serve as a powerful

85

tool for elucidating comprehensive characterization of the oligonucleotide composition of SARS-CoV-

86

2 and time-series trends of prevalent epidemic strains across various regions, such as continents.

91

The full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the GISAID database on

92

November 4, 2020. The total number of sequences was 170,190. From these sequences, those with a

93

length of more than 27 kb after removing the polyA-tail sequences were selected.

94
95

Oligonucleotide frequency and odds ratio

96

Pentanucleotide frequencies and odds ratios were used in the present study. The pentanucleotide odd

97

ratios (observed/expected values) were calculated using the formula PVWXYZ = ƒVWXYZ/ƒVƒWƒXƒYƒZ,

98

where ƒV, ƒW, ƒX, ƒY and ƒZ denote the frequencies of mononucleotides V, W, X, Y and Z,

99

respectively, and ƒVWXYZ denotes the frequency of pentanucleotide VWXYZ (Karlin et al. 1998).

100
101

BLSOM

102

Kohonen’s self-organizing map (SOM), an unsupervised neural network algorithm, is a powerful

103

tool for clustering and visualizing high-dimensional complex data on a two-dimensional map

104

(Kohonen, 1990; Kohonen et al., 1996). We modified the conventional SOM for genome informatics

105

on the basis of batch learning, aiming to make the learning process and the resulting map

106

independent of the order of data input (Kanaya et al. 2001; Abe et al. 2003). The newly developed

107

SOM, BLSOM, is suitable for high-performance parallel computing and, therefore, for big data

108

analysis. The initial weight vectors were defined using principal component analysis (PCA), based

109

on the variance-covariance matrix, rather than by using random values. The weight vectors (wij)

110

were arranged in a two-dimensional lattice denoted by i (= 0, 1,…, I-1) and j (= 0, 1,…, J-1) and

111

were set and updated as described previously (Kanaya et al. 2001; Abe et al. 2003). A BLSOM

112

program suitable for PC cluster systems is available on our website (http://bioinfo.ie.niigata-

113

u.ac.jp/?BLSOM).

115

RESULTS and DISCUSSION

116
117

BLSOM for pentanucleotide composition and their odds ratio

118

It should be mentioned here that SARS-CoV-2 genomes have changed their mononucleotide

119

composition during the course of the epidemic in humans, reducing C and increasing U, regardless

120

of clade (Mercatelli et al. 2020; Wada, Wada & Ikemura. 2020; Iwasaki Abe & Ikemura 2021), a

121

process which is thought to be caused by the APOBEC family enzymes (Mangeat et al. 2003;

122

Simmonds 2020). Considering this clade-independent tendency, we performed BLSOM analysis of

123

not only the pentanucleotide composition but also their odds ratio, which can reduce the effects

124

caused by changes in the mononucleotide composition. Additionally, to check the robustness of

125

sequence accuracy, we used datasets with different sequence accuracies: 167,905 sequences with less

126

than 10% unknown nucleotides other than ATGCs in the genome sequence and 130,753 sequences

127

with less than 1% unknown nucleotides; for each sequence dataset, the number of cases by region

128

and clade is shown in Table 1.

129

First, we constructed BLSOM for sequences with less than 10% unknown nucleotides, using the

130

pentanucleotide composition and their odds ratios (Figure 1A and B). BLSOM utilizes unsupervised

131

machine learning, and the genome sequences are clustered (self-organized) on a two-dimensional

132

plane, based only on the difference in the vector data in a 1024 (=45)-dimensional space. Lattice

133

points that include sequences from more than one clade are indicated in black, those that contain no

134

genomic sequences are indicated by blank, and those containing sequences from a single clade are

135

indicated in the color representing the clade. The odds ratio (Figure 1B) gave more accurate

136

separations (a smaller percentage of black grid points), possibly by excluding effects owing to the

137

clade-independent time-series change in the mononucleotide composition (Iwasaki Abe & Ikemura.

138

2021), which affected all SARS-CoV-2 clades. Even for the sequences with low-sequence accuracy,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.15.439956; this version posted April 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

139

clade-dependent separation occurs, allowing us to understand characteristics of the oligonucleotide

140

composition that are specific to each clade; thus, oligonucleotide-BLSOM is thought to be a robust

141

method. However, it is clear that BLSOMs for sequences with less than 1% unknown nucleotides

142

(Figure 1C and D) gave more accurate separation than those listed in Figure 1A and B, and the

143

highest resolution was obtained for the BLSOM for the odds ratio (Figure 1D).

144

Clades have been defined by the statistical distribution of phylogenetic distances in tree

145

construction based on multiple sequence alignments (Han et al. 2019; Tang et al. 2020), whereas

146

BLSOM is a sequence alignment-free analysis that is suitable for the analysis of massive data.

147

Because sequences at different locations on BLSOM have different oligonucleotide compositions,

148

clustering according to clades means that sequences belonging to different clades have different

149

oligonucleotide combinations, that is, differential combinations of mutations.

150
151

3D display of the data for different continents

152

Using BLSOM (Figure 1D) for the pentanucleotide odds ratio, Figure 1E examines the classification

153

according to four continents (Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania) that have large numbers of

154

sequences. Here, the lattice points containing sequences of different continents are displayed in

155

black, and those containing only sequences of a single continent are displayed in the color specifying

156

each continent. Although not as clear as clade-dependent separations, regional differences have been

157

observed, which should reflect differential shares of prevalent variants among continents. However,

158

it is apparently difficult to obtain sufficient information from the results shown in Figure 1E alone.

159

BLSOM is equipped with various visualization tools for analysis results; therefore, we next show the

160

number of sequences belonging to each lattice point with a 3D display.

161
162

Again, using the BLSOM shown in Figure 1D, Figure 2 shows the number of sequences
belonging to each lattice point for each clade in each continent as a vertical bar, which is colored by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.15.439956; this version posted April 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

163

continent, as shown in Figure 1E. Looking laterally at a particular clade, each clade consists of

164

several subclusters, each consisting of several high peaks surrounded by many low peaks. Different

165

subclusters observed in each clade are distinguished by numbering in each figure, but if they are

166

located in the same zone on BLSOM, the same number is given even if they are of different

167

continents. Looking vertically at a particular continent, sequences of different subclusters of

168

different clades exist in different amounts, and some subclusters are only in a particular continent,

169

that is, the prevalent variants for each continent can be visualized in an easy-to-understand manner.

170

In Supplementary Figure S1, the data shown in Figure 2 are displayed in 2D, and referring to the

171

quantitative results in Figure 2, we defined sequences attributed to each subcluster in each clade.

172
173

Time-series analysis

174

The fact that sequences belonging to one clade were clearly separated on BLSOM indicates the

175

importance of subdivision of each clade, and the separation on BLSOM is thought to be a good

176

indicator of this subdivision. To further examine the biological significance of the subclusters of

177

each clade on BLSOM, we visualized the number of sequences collected in each month in each

178

region as a vertical bar differentially colored according to clade (Figure 3). Looking laterally at a

179

continent, the time-series quantitative changes among different clades or different subclusters of one

180

clade are clear. Looking at the results for a particular collection month for different continents

181

longitudinally, quantitative changes among different clades or different subclusters of one clade are

182

again clear, depending on the continent.

183

Next, for each clade in each continent, we quantitatively analyzed the time-series changes in the

184

proportion of its subclusters using a 100% stack bar graph (Figure 4). The percentage of sequences

185

in different subclusters are distinguished by different colors, and when a total number of sequences

186

for a certain month is more than 100, the data for that month is indicated by a thick horizontal bar.

187

We focused mainly on such months.

188

In the clade S/L/V detected in the early stage of the epidemic (December 2019– March 2020),

189

three major subclusters of each clade were observed and distinguished by suffix numbers, and most

190

sequences belonged to the two subclusters: S1/L1/V1 and S2/L2/V2. In Asia, many sequences

191

belonging to S1/L1/V1 were detected in December 2019, but in Europe and other regions, S2/L2/V2

192

were more abundantly detected in March and April 2020 than S1/L1/V1, and the proportion became

193

more pronounced in April than in March. In March and April in Europe, a remarkable number of

194

sequences belonging to S3/L3/V3 were also detected, showing three different variants prevalent at

195

the beginning of the epidemic in Europe. Far fewer than 100 sequences were detected after May;

196

sequences belonging to S1/L1/V1 were mainly detected in Asia and those belonging to S2/L2/V2

197

were shown in other regions, presenting differential trends in prevalent variants among continents.

198

For clade G, which started the epidemic in Europe in February, we defined five subclusters. In

199

February, roughly equal amounts of sequences belonging to G1 and G2 were detected in Europe and

200

North America, but as the epidemic progressed, those belonging to G2 were mainly detected in

201

Europe, whereas those belonging to both G1 and G2 were prevalent in North America. In Asia, only

202

sequences belonging to G1 are detected; in Oceania, those belonging to G2 accounted for about 10%

203

in the early stage, but afterward, those belonging to Oceania-specific G5 accounted for the majority.

204

For GH, we defined seven subclusters, including GH1 and GH2, which dominated in North

205

America and Europe, respectively. In North America, in addition to GH1, several months contain

206

approximately 20% of the sequences belonging to GH3, GH5, and GH6. In Asia, only GH1 has been

207

detected. In Oceania, only GH4 and GH7, which were specific to this region, were detected; initially,

208

GH4 was dominant, but after July, GH7 was primarily detected.

209
210

For GR, we defined five subclusters, including GR1 and GR2, which dominated in North America
and Europe, respectively. Moreover, in Europe, GR1 was detected to the same extent as GR2 in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.15.439956; this version posted April 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

211

February, but as the epidemic progressed, GR2 began to predominate. In North America, the

212

occupancy of GR1 and GR2 varied to some extent depending on the collection month. In Asia, GR1

213

was mainly detected, and in Oceania, only region-specific subclusters have been detected.

214

These temporospatial changes in subclusters show that the subcluster is the separation (self-

215

organization) that reflects biological significance and is fundamental information for understanding

216

the overall picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

217
218

CONCLUSION and PERSPECTICES

219
220

Based on the phylogenetic tree construction by multiple sequence alignments, GISAID has defined

221

seven clades of SARS-CoV-2, giving a total of eight if clade O corresponding to others is included.

222

However, these classifications are clearly inadequate to understand the current status of SARS-CoV-

223

2 because this RNA virus evolves at a high speed. Using only the oligonucleotide composition of

224

many genomic sequences, the unsupervised machine learning, BLSOM, could separate viral

225

sequences according to not only clades but also subclusters within each clade. The separation (self-

226

organization) that AI can accomplish without any hypothesis or model is thought to be a

227

classification from a new perspective. BLSOM is equipped with various tools that allow us to

228

visualize the analysis results in an easily understandable way and to visualize differences in the

229

number of subcluster sequences among continents (Figure 2) and their time-series changes (Figure

230

3), i.e., the distinct variations in the resulting subclusters depending on the region and the collection

231

time.

232

Herein, we focused on pentanucleotide composition, but similar separations were obtained for

233

other lengths of oligonucleotides (Ikemura et al. 2020). BLSOM is an explanatory AI that can clarify

234

combinatorial patterns of oligonucleotides that contribute to the separation according to clades and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.15.439956; this version posted April 15, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

235

their subclusters. BLSOM is a powerful method for elucidating comprehensive characterization of

236

the oligonucleotide composition in a massive number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Next, it

237

will be important to know the relationship between the strains isolated in clades and their subclusters

238

and the causative mutations. When it comes to oligonucleotides as long as 15-mers, most are only

239

present in one copy in the viral genome; therefore, changes in 15-mer sequences can be directly

240

linked to mutations, and we have already started analysis from this perspective (Ikemura et al. 2020).

241

The implementation of time-series oligonucleotide analysis of variants with rapidly expanding intra-

242

population frequencies has enabled the identification of candidates for advantageous mutations for

243

viral infection and growth in human cells (Wada, Wada & Ikemura. 2020).

244

Phylogenetic methods based on sequence alignment have been widely used in evolutionary studies

245

(Hadfield et al. 2018; Kumar et al. 2018), and these methods are undoubtedly essential for studying

246

the phylogenetic relationships between different viral species and variations in the same virus at the

247

single-nucleotide level. In contrast, AI can analyze a massive number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences at

248

once without difficulty, potentially reaching a level of one million in the near future. The AI method

249

for oligonucleotide composition has become increasingly important as a complement to the

250

phylogenetic tree construction method in preparing for future outbreaks of various infectious RNA

251

viruses.
