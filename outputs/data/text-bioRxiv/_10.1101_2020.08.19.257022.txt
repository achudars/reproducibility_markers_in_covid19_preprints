Abstract
It becomes more and more obvious that deregulation of host metabolism play an important
role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis with implication for increased risk of severe course of
COVID-19. Furthermore, it is expected that COVID-19 patients recovered from severe disease
may experience long-term metabolic disorders. Thereby understanding the consequences of
SARS-CoV-2 infection on host metabolism can facilitate efforts for effective treatment option.
We have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells undergo a shift towards glycolysis
and that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we show that also
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is remarkably deregulated. Since PPP supplies
ribonucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 replication, this could represent an attractive target for an
intervention. On that account, we employed the transketolase inhibitor benfooxythiamine and
showed dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in non-toxic concentrations. Importantly,
the antiviral efficacy of benfooxythiamine was further increased in combination with 2DG.

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in millions of infected people worldwide. Though
the majority of patients exhibit mild to moderate symptoms, around 20% of patients develop
severe disease. Effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are currently lacking.
Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic disorders are associated with an increased risk of
severe COVID-19. Increased amounts of glucose in the sera of COVID-19 patients were
correlated with poor prognosis in individuals both with and without pre-existing diabetes (Shen
et al., 2020). At the cellular level, SARS-CoV-2 induces a shift of the host cell metabolism
towards glycolysis in infected cells, and the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG),
which targets hexokinase (the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis), interferes with SARS-CoV-2
infection in colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells and monocytes (Bojkova et al., 2020; Codo
et al., 2020). Hence, agents that antagonize virus-induced changes in the host cell metabolism,
especially glycolysis, are candidates for COVID-19 therapy.
Using a proteomics dataset derived from SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco-2 cells (Bojkova et al.,
2020), we identified further metabolic changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular
levels of key drivers of glycolysis including hexokinase 1 and 2 (HK1 and HK2) were increased
in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, while negative regulators such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
1 and 2 (FBP1 and FBP2) were reduced (Figure S1A). Changes in glycolysis can also affect
other metabolic pathways. Metabolic intermediates generated by the glycolytic enzymes
supply both the oxidative and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) with intermediates (Stincone et al., 2015). Notably, transketolase (TKT) and
transaldolase 1 (TALDO1), two constituents of the non-oxidative PPP branch (Stincone et al.,
2015), displayed increased levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Figure S1A), suggesting that
the non-oxidative PPP branch is also regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The non-oxidative PPP branch converts glycolytic intermediates into ribose-5-phosphate,
which is required for the synthesis of nucleic acids, and sugar phosphate precursors, which
are necessary for the synthesis of amino acids (Stincone et al., 2015). TKT, a key enzyme of
the non-oxidative PPP, becomes activated by the binding of one molecule of thiamine
diphosphate and of a bivalent cation (Zhao and Zhong, 2009). Recently, it has been shown

that TKT activity may be strongly increased by the formation of a heterodimer with
transketolase like 1 (TKTL1) (Li et al., 2019).
Irreversible inhibitors of TKT such as oxythiamine (an inactive analogue of thiamine) have been
developed (Tylicki et al., 2018). To investigate whether TKT inhibitors affect SARS-CoV-2
replication, we used benfooxythiamine (BOT), a prodrug of the TKT inhibitor oxythiamine,
currently evaluated in pre-clinical experiments (Coy, 2017). Indeed, non-toxic BOT
concentrations inhibited the replication of two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates (FFM1 and
FFM7) in a concentration-dependent manner, as indicated by immunostaining for the SARSCoV-2 Spike (S) protein and the detection of genomic RNA by qPCR (Figure S1B-S1D).
The antiviral effects of BOT were further increased by the glycolysis inhibitor 2DG (Figure S1DS1F), indicating that the combined inhibition of ribose-5-phosphate production via the nonoxidative PPP branch and glycolysis is more effective in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication
than the inhibition of either metabolic pathway alone. Mechanistically, 2DG inhibits the
glycolysis enzymes hexokinase and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), both required for
synthesis of fructose-6-phosphate, which serve as glycolytic intermediate for generating
ribose-5-phosphate in non-oxidative PPP branch (Stincone et al., 2015).
Furthermore, ribose-5-phosphate can be also generated in the oxidative PPP branch through
the metabolic conversion of glucose-6-phosphate (Stincone et al., 2015). Since 2DG
decreases cellular levels of glucose-6-phosphate, it may additionally lower ribose-5-phosphate
levels by reducing its availability for metabolizing in the oxidative branch of PPP. Importantly,
the oxidative PPP branch seems also be activated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as indicated
by increased 6-phoshogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) levels (Figure S1A). PGD catalyzes
the conversion of 6-phosphogluconate into ribulose-5-phosphate, a precursor of ribose-5phosphate, in the oxidative PPP branch (Stincone et al., 2015).
Hence, 2DG could increase the effects of BOT by further reducing ribobose-5-phosphate
synthesis through interrupting the supply of glycolytic intermediates into both oxidative and
non-oxidative branch of PPP.

In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with changes in the regulation of the PPP,
which has potential implications for antiviral therapy. The TKT inhibitor BOT inhibited SARSCoV-2 replication, indicating a role of the non-oxidative PPP branch in the virus replication
cycle. The addition of the glycolysis inhibitor 2DG further enhanced the antiviral activity of BOT,
which may result from the interruption of supply of glycolytic intermediates into PPP. The
findings also demonstrate that the simultaneous inhibition of different metabolic pathways has
potential as an antiviral treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (Figure S1G).
Notably, uncontrolled glucose and pentose phosphate levels correlate with worse prognosis
and higher mortality in COVID-19 patients (Deng et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2020; Zhu et al.,
2020), and reports show that a number of COVID-19 survivors suffer from metabolic disorders
including abnormal glucose metabolism (Ayres, 2020). Therefore, targeting the host cell
metabolism may prevent the metabolic derailment of immune cells in addition to the inhibition
of SARS-CoV-2 replication and thus contribute to recovery in severe COVID-19 disease
(Ayres, 2020).

Methods

Proteomics data
The LC–MS/MS proteomics data with the dataset identifier PXD017710 have been previously
published (Bojkova et al., 2020). Proteins derived from Caco-2 cells infected with SARS-CoV2 after 24 h post infection and matching search terms “glycolysis” and “pentose phosphate
pathway” in KEGG database were selected for further analysis. Significantly deregulated
proteins (p value ≤ 0.5) in mock versus infected cells were plotted using the heatmaps2
function of the gplots package of the R suite. Briefly, raw enrichment values were used to
calculate per row Z scores. Maximum and minimum Z score were attributed the colour red and
blue respectively. Scripts available upon request.

Cell culture and virus production
Caco-2 cells, a colon carcinoma derived cell line, was maintained in MEM (Minimal Essential
Medium) containing 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum,10,000 U penicillin/streptomycin and 2%
(v/v) L-glutamine (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). Both SARS-CoV-2/FFM1 and SARS-CoV2/FFM7 were isolated as previously described (Hoehl et al., 2020; Toptan et al., 2020). The
viral stocks were produced by passaging virus on Caco-2 cells at MOI 0.1. Both strains
underwent two passages. The virus titer was determined as TCID50.

Antiviral and cytotoxicity assay
Caco-2 cells were seeded in 96-well plate. After reaching confluency, cell were pre-treated
with benfooxythiamine (BOT, Zyagnum AG) for 24 h. Then the cells were additionally treated
with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) or let untreated and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.01. 24
h later, cells and supernatants were harvested to determine viral load. The cytotoxic effect of
BOT alone or in combination with 2DG was evaluated my MTT assay as previously described.

Viral infection was assessed by staining of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 24h post infection, cells
were fixed with acetone:methanol (40:60) solution followed by incubation with a primary
monoclonal antibody directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (1:1500,
Sinobiological). Primary antibody was detected with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (1:1000, Dianova), followed by addition of AEC substrate. The
quantification of spike positive area was performed by BIOREADER®-7000-F-z-I (Bio-Sys).

qRT-PCR of viral genome in supernatants
RNA from cell culture supernatant was isolated using the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amount of viral RNA was detected by primers

using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs) and a CFX96 RealTime System, C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. Number of viral copies was determined from
standard curves generated by plasmid DNA (pEX-A128-RdRP) containing the corresponding
amplicon regions of the RdRP target sequence.

Statistics
All experiments were performed under similar conditions in three independent replicates.
GraphPad Prism 8 software was used to plot the graphical representation and to perform
statistical analysis. Statistical significance was calculated by two sided unpaired t-test as
described in the figure legends (ns – not significant, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.005).
