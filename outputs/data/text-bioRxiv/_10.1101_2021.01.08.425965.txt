Abstract
Since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the causative agent of the current COVID19 pandemic, considerable effort has been spent characterizing the interaction between the Spike
protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor. This has provided a detailed picture of the end point structure of the RBDACE2 binding event, but what remains to be elucidated is the conformation and dynamics of the
RBD prior to its interaction with ACE2. In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations
to probe the flexibility and conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the receptor-binding
domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have found that the unbound RBD has a
localized region of dynamic flexibility in Loop 3 and that mutations identified during the
COVID-19 pandemic in Loop 3 do not affect this flexibility. We use a loop-modeling protocol to
generate and simulate novel conformations of the CoV2-RBD Loop 3 region that sample
conformational space beyond the ACE2 bound crystal structure. This has allowed for the
identification of interesting substates of the unbound RBD that are lower energy than the ACE2bound conformation, and that block key residues along the ACE2 binding interface. These novel
unbound substates may represent new targets for therapeutic design.

1. Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2),
first detected in Wuhan, China in late 2019 1. The CoV2 genome encodes 29 proteins. Among
these proteins is the membrane-anchored spike glycoprotein, a class I membrane fusion protein.
The spike protein complex is composed of a homo-trimeric assembly of monomers containing
1273 residues and 22 N-linked glycans 2 and is responsible for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and
entry into host-cells. The virus attachment to human host-cells is mediated by the interaction of
the viral Spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the host-cell angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Fig. 1). Disruption of the binding interface between the
Spike protein RBD and host-cell ACE2 receptor would provide a means of preventing SARSCoV-2 infection at the very first step.
Several key aspects of the binding interaction between the Spike protein RBD and the human
ACE2 receptor have been characterized for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (CoV1), the
coronavirus responsible for a previous pandemic in 2002/2003 3. These include determining the
identity of the binding residues that mediate the interaction between the viral Spike RBD and
ACE2, the nature of these residue-level interactions, and the overall strength of the interaction.
Both the CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD binding sites for ACE2 adopt a similar interface (Fig. 1),
consisting of long, unstructured stretches of 14 residues which form a range of stabilizing
hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and salt bridges with ACE2 4-6. The RBD binding
interface in general contains 4 loops (Fig. 2a) that have the potential to be dynamic and flexible,
both in an unbound state as well as after binding to the ACE2 receptor. Several groups have
previously investigated the conformational dynamics and flexibility of the RBD when in
complex with the ACE2 receptor through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, identifying that
residues 472-490 (Loop 3) and residues 495-506 (Loop 4) near the binding interface within the
receptor binding motif (RBM) as the most flexible regions within the Spike RBD 5,7,8. In the case
of CoV2, three residues within the flexible Loop 3 of the RBD (F486, N487, and Y489) were
identified to participate in stabilizing interactions with ACE2 4. Interestingly, several antibodies
developed to target the RBD have also been found to bind to the flexible Loop 3 (Fig. S1a).
When antibodies interact with Loop 3, the distribution of Loop 3 conformations is greater than
when Loop 3 is not part of the binding interface (Fig. S1b). This suggests that Loop 3 has an
inherent conformational flexibility that is not observed from static structures of the RBD-ACE2
complex. The role that protein dynamics play in mediating protein-protein binding is not only of
great importance to understanding the basic mechanisms of binding, but also plays a crucial role
in the design of protein binding therapeutics 9,10.
Although much progress has been made in understanding the interaction between the Spike RBD
and ACE2, what remains to be elucidated is the flexibility and conformational dynamics of the
RBD in an unbound state. The internal motions of proteins play a key role in their interactions
and functionality, a fact that is often lost in static structures derived from electron microscopy
and X-ray crystallography. Understanding the conformational ensemble of RBD states without a
binding partner may reveal novel targets not observed in static structures of the RBDs, which
will aid in the design of therapeutics targeting this important binding domain. In this work we
utilize molecular dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and conformational sampling of
the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains in an unbound state. We focus on
the Loop 3 region of the RBD, which contains several residues that participate in stabilizing

interactions with ACE2 and is a hot-spot of several common single amino acid mutations that
have been identified during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We find that Loop 3 represents a
localized area of dynamic flexibility in an unbound state, and our simulations suggest that this
flexibility is resilient to perturbation by mutations. Finally, using loop-modeling to probe novel
conformations of the Loop 3 region, we have identified interesting substates of the unbound
RBD that block the binding interface and are lower energy than the conformation of the RBD
bound to ACE2, and thus may represent enticing targets for therapeutic intervention.
2. Results
Microsecond Timescale MD Simulations of Wild-Type CoV1 and CoV2 RBDs Reveal
Localized Flexibility in Loop 3
Multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations were recorded in order to explore the
conformational flexibility and dynamics of the wild-type spike protein RBDs from CoV1 and
CoV2. The initial coordinates used in the MD trajectories were taken from the high-resolution
structures determined by X-ray diffraction of CoV1-RBD in complex with a neutralizing
antibody (PDB: 2dd8) and of CoV2-RBD in complex with the human ACE2 receptor (PDB:
6m0j) (Fig. 1). While it contains a well ordered b-sheet core, much of the RBD is
unstructured (Fig. 1) and in particular 4 different loops make up the binding interface (Fig. 2a,
green and pink) of the RBD with ACE2. Residues 438-450 (CoV2) or residues 425-437 (CoV1)
make up Loop 1, residues 455-470 (CoV2) or residues 442-457 (CoV1) make up Loop 2,
residues 471-491 (CoV2) or residues 458-477 (CoV1) make up Loop 3, and residues 495-508
(CoV2) or residues 481-494 (CoV1) make up Loop 4. An assessment of the residue level
propensity for disorder, using the Protein Disorder prediction System (PrDOS) webserver 11,
indicates that while none of these regions is considered intrinsically disordered, the loop regions
of both CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD do show an increased disordered propensity (Fig. 2b)
relative to the rest of the RBD. PrDOS was used without template-based prediction and thus
reports only on the disorder probability of the local amino acid composition. A prediction false
positive rate of 5% was used, and values above the 50% threshold (dotted line) indicate regions
of predicted disorder.
As observed from an analysis of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the
starting structure from 4 µs MD trajectories (Fig. S2a) both CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD
remain in a stable equilibrium conformation over the time-course of the MD trajectories, with
average RMSD values of 1.42 Å for CoV1 and 1.39 Å for CoV2. However, the RMSD of
CoV1-RBD shows several large fluctuations, suggesting that CoV1-RBD is more
conformationally flexible than CoV2-RBD. Indeed, this is observed in the calculated per
residue root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF) profiles (Fig. 3a) and in snapshots along the
MD trajectory (Fig. 3b). The RMSF profiles indicate that the CoV1-RBD overall is more
flexible than CoV2-RBD. However, the CoV2-RBD does show a localized area of increased
flexibility in residues 369-373 relative to CoV1-RBD. Both CoV1 and CoV2 RBDs have
substantial flexibility in the Loop 3 region from ~471-491 (Fig. 3a, inset), which is part of the
large ACE2 binding interface. The average conformations obtained from the MD simulations
of CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD are quite similar (Fig. 3c), with the major differences
localized to Loop 3 centralized around the conserved disulfide bond between residues 480 and
488 (Fig. 3c, enlargement).

Conformational Flexibility of Loop 3 in the Free RBD
In order to understand the interaction mechanisms of the RBD with binding partners and for
design of therapeutics, one needs to understand the conformations accessible in the free state of
the RBD prior to binding. The MD simulations starting from the crystal structures show that
while Loop 3 does display the highest flexibility within the RBD, on average there is not a large
deviation from the starting structure. This might result from being trapped near the starting point
of the crystallized ACE2-bound state of the RBD. To better probe the conformational flexibility
of the RBD in the free state, we conducted MD simulations of several unique loop-model
structures of the Loop 3 region (Fig. 4). The KinematicMover algorithm within pyRosetta was
used to generate 100 new conformations of the Loop 3 region of the CoV2 RBD (PDB: 6m0j)
and 100 new conformations of the Loop 3 region (residues 458-477) of the CoV1 RBD (PDB:
2dd8), making sure to maintain the disulfide bonds (CoV2: C480-C488, CoV1: C467-C474).
Five of these new conformations were then chosen at random, and subjected to energy
minimization and relaxation protocols in pyRosetta as described in the Methods section. The 5
energy minimized loop-models were used as starting structures for 750 ns of MD simulation, and
snapshots from these simulations are shown along the outer edges of Fig. 4, along with the
average structures from each of the 5 simulations overlaid in the center of the figure and an
enlargement of the Loop 3 region shown in the boxes at the bottom.
The loop modeling shows that Loop 3 can take on a vast range of conformations. In general the
loop models represent an increase in free energy, but both CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD have one
loop model that represents an average conformation with lower free energy compared to the
crystal structure. The average difference in free energy between the conformations sampled in
the simulations from crystal structures versus the simulations of the different loop-models is
summarized in Table 1. These DG values were calculated as the difference between the average
Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy for each loop
model simulation and the average MM/GBSA free energy from the 4 µs simulations described in
the previous section. The RMSDs of the conformations sampled during the MD simulation with
respect to the starting structure show large variation between different loop models for both
CoV2 (Fig. S2c) and CoV1 (Fig. S2d), although the CoV1 loop models (1.8–2.7 Å) are clustered
at a smaller RMSD average than the CoV2 loop models (2.0–4.8 Å). To better deconvolute the
contribution of Loop 3, the backbone RMSD with respect to the starting structure was recalculated ignoring the Loop 3 residues (Fig. S2c,d) and also by only considering the Loop 3
residues (Fig. S2c,d). When viewed in this fashion, it becomes clear that the increase in RMSD
observed in the loop-modeled simulations relative to the crystal structure simulations is a result
of the increased flexibility of the new loop-conformations. Indeed when viewed on a per-residue
basis (Fig. S3), the overall RMSF profiles of the loop-models maintains the same topology as the
wild-type simulations, while displaying drastic increases in the RMSF values of Loop 3 for both
CoV1 and CoV2 (maximum RMSF ~8-9 Å, compare to Fig. 3a). The range of conformations
probed in the loop modeling, some of which were more energetically favorable than the
crystal structure, suggests that Loop 3 is capable of sampling a variety of conformations in
solution. Future experimental studies will be necessary to further probe and define the
conformational dynamics of the RBD, and especially the Loop 3 region.

It is important to consider how mutations perturb the conformation and dynamics of the RBD,
especially during an ongoing pandemic as mutations continue to accumulate 12,13. Continued
identification and evaluation of mutants is crucial in order to better understand the evolving
nature of the pandemic, and to ensure that the treatments and vaccines whose primary target is
the Spike protein continue to be effective. As part of a large collaboration to review and
characterize the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome in three-dimensions, an analysis of the
SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited into the GISAID database 14 at the end of June 2020 was
conducted. A full description of the methods used to analyze the mutations of all of the SARSCoV-2 proteins, including the Spike protein, can be found elsewhere 15, and the raw data is made
freely available 16. Based on that analysis of 33,290 viral genomes, there are several interesting
trends in the mutations accumulated in the Spike protein RBD. First, 444 (1.3%) contained a
mutation in the RBD of the Spike protein; of these, 144 unique sequence variants were
identified. The identified mutations account for substitutions of 78 individual residues in the
RBD (residues: 330-527), with the top 5 substitutions listed in Fig. 2c. Among the flexible loop
regions, Loop 1 (residues 438-450) contains 5 unique mutations, Loop 2 (residues 455-470)
contains 9 unique mutations, Loop 3 (residues 471-491) contains 21 unique mutations, and Loop
4 contains 3 unique mutations. While all of the flexible regions of the RBD have residues that
have been found to be mutated in the current COVID-19 pandemic, Loop 3 seems to be a
particular hotspot of mutation, with 13 out of 20 residues having at least 1 mutation identified.
The top 4 most common mutants of Loop 3, based on number of genomes containing these
mutants, were chosen to be studied in more detail: T478I, S477N, V483A, G476S (Fig. 2d).
MD Simulations Reveal that the Flexible Loop 3 of CoV2-RBD is Resilient to Localized
Mutations.
Based on the 4 common mutations identified in Loop 3 of the RBD, MD simulations of the
single mutants G476S, S477N, T478I, or V483A were performed to observe how they affect
the RBD’s conformation and dynamics. Using the same starting crystal structure as the wildtype simulation (PDB: 6m0j), 4 new starting structures were created by mutating the relevant
residue in pyRosetta 17. These new structures were then subjected to the same energy
minimization and equilibration conditions as the wild-type structure (see Methods), before
collecting 2 µs-long MD simulations for each under the same conditions as used for the wildtype simulation. Analysis of the backbone RMSD over the time-course of each simulation
(Fig. S2b) shows that all of the mutant structures remain in a relatively stable equilibrium
from their respective starting points (average RMSD: G476S 1.65 Å; S477N 1.48 Å; T478I
1.46 Å; V483A 1.44 Å). A closer look at the fluctuations of the backbone atoms again
illustrates similar conformations as observed for the wild-type simulation through the MD
snapshots (Fig. 5a). The per-residue RMSF profiles of the mutant simulations show that there
is no significant difference in backbone flexibility between the 4 mutants in Loop 3 (Fig. 5b),
although T478I appears to be marginally more perturbative than the other mutants, slightly
increasing the flexibility of the Loop 3 region. The average structures show that there is
virtually no difference between the backbones of the wild-type or mutants (Fig. 5c). This
suggests that the conformational flexibility of Loop 3 is resilient to single mutations, and this
resiliency may account for the higher number of mutations observed in this region.

To better examine the conformational states of the RBD binding interface that were sampled
during the MD simulations, and to identify binding and non-binding conformational states, we
performed a cluster analysis on each of the wild-type and mutant simulations using a
hierarchical agglomerative (heiragglo) algorithm 18. Using an epsilon (e) cutoff of 1.9 Å, the
22500 conformations of the CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD were separated into 51 and 14
clusters respectively, whereas the CoV2-RBD mutants clustered into fewer? groups (G476S: 4
clusters, S477N: 4 clusters, T478I: 2 clusters, V483A: 7 clusters). The average RMSD of the
residues in the RBD binding interface with respect to the starting crystal structure was then
calculated for each cluster. Clusters with low RMSD then represent conformations that are
very similar to the crystal structures of RBD bound to ACE2, while clusters with large RMSD
correspond to conformations that are very different from these receptor bound states. Figure 6
shows the RBD binding interface of the average conformation of each cluster with the
smallest RMSD (ie. most similar to the bound state) in blue and the largest RMSD (ie. least
similar to the bound state) in pink for each of the MD simulations presented. Interestingly, the
biggest difference in conformation is observed with the structures of the largest RMSD
clusters of the loop-models from both CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD, where a large portion of
Loop 3 is curled back over the binding interface (Fig. 6a,b). This conformation of the free
RBD may block the binding interface and prevent interactions with ACE2.
3. Discussion
Because of the importance of the spike RBD in the initial binding of the SARS-CoV2 viral
particle to a host cell, it is important to have an understanding of the conformation and dynamics
at all stages of the binding event, including in the unbound state. In particular, modeling and
identifying conformations of the free state are informative on a range of conformations that can
be targeted by therapeutics. However, many of the RBD structures that have been determined
and deposited into the PDB are either incomplete, mainly missing residues in the loop sections of
the RBD, or are in a bound state in complex with the ACE2 receptor or various neutralizing
antibodies. Much of the large binding interface of the RBD does not adopt strong secondary
structure elements, but are rather random coil loops. These loop regions (Fig. 2a) are not
predicted to fall under the definition of intrinsically disordered regions (Fig. 2b). However, it is
interesting to note that the loops tend to have higher predicted disorder propensity than the rest of
the RBD (Fig. 2b), a propensity that may be evolutionarily conserved 19. In addition, the missing
residues of these loop regions in many cryo-EM structures of the spike protein suggest that these
loops may be dynamic and sample a conformational ensemble distinct from the bound state.
Indeed, in all of the structures investigated in this work the residues within the loop regions show
large RMSF values, with Loop 3 having the largest. The fact that Loop 3 is so flexible is quite
interesting since this loop is directly adjacent to the binding interface with ACE2, and even
provides some stabilizing contacts to residues on ACE2. In order to probe the conformational
flexibility of Loop 3 and characterize the unbound conformational space of the RBD beyond the
ACE2 bound state, it was necessary to perturb the loop away from the stable low-energy state of
the RBD-ACE2 crystal structure. These loop models again showed very high flexibility of Loop
3 (ie. large RMSF), while maintaining the same average flexibility in other regions of the RBD
as observed in the simulation starting from the CoV1 or CoV2 crystal structures (compare Fig.
S3 with Fig. 3a). This indicates that the bulk of the RBD structure is resilient to change even in
the presence of large conformational flexibility of Loop 3. In addition, some of these loop
models represent conformations that are more energetically favorable for the unbound RBD in

solution (Table 1) on average.
The large and relatively flat binding interface between the RBD and ACE2 represents an
interesting protein-protein interaction that provides a challenging target for traditional small
molecule therapeutics that typically bind to well-defined binding pockets on targets such as
enzymes. Instead, with the conformational flexibility afforded to the binding interface of the
RBD the identification of lowly populated or transient cryptic binding sites should be considered.
Cryptic binding sites are difficult to determine in the unbound apo state of a protein, but are
generally found in and around dynamic and flexible protein regions, where the inherent
conformational fluctuation allows for cryptic sites to become accessible 20-23. By comparing the
conformations that the CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD sampled during our MD simulations to the
corresponding crystal structure of ACE2 bound RBD, we were able to identify conformations of
the dynamic and flexible loop regions that were distinctly different from the bound state of the
RBD. In particular, the MD simulations of the different loop models sampled conformations of
the CoV2-RBD that contained stabilizing interactions between the sidechain of Q493 and the
backbone of F486, helping to fold Loop 3 over the binding interface of the RBD (Fig. 6b) and
which would block the normal RBD binding interface with ACE2. Such examples of
conformations that can be sampled by the RBD ensemble in solution, which provide natural
interruption of the protein-protein binding interface between RBD and ACE2, represent potential
targets that create transient and/or cryptic binding sites that can be exploited by therapeutic
design.
The impact of mutations on the structure and conformational flexibility of the spike protein,
especially during an ongoing pandemic, is of particular concern when designing therapeutics
against SARS-CoV-2. For example, based on recent structures of the D614G spike protein
obtained by cryo-EM it is now becoming clear that the D614G mutation interferes with a
stabilizing interaction between monomers of the trimeric assembly 24, providing increased
infectivity of the virus by ensuring that all three of the RBDs in the spike protein have the
flexibility to adopt binding-competent, open conformations 24-26. There is thus a persistent need
to maintain a current understanding of the impact of mutations that are manifesting during the
course of the current pandemic. Several common RBD mutants have been identified previously
and their effects on binding to ACE2 have been probed, including N439K, T478I, V483A,
G476S, S494P, V483F, and A475V 12. Ghorbani et al. characterized these mutants in the context
of the full RBD-ACE2 complex (PDB: 6m0j) through molecular dynamics simulations, showing
a stable and overall similar RMSD among the wild-type and mutants in the extended loop
forming the binding interface with ACE2 12. The binding free energy between the RBD and
ACE2 was also found to be consistent between the wild-type and the mutants with the exception
of T478I, which had a binding free energy 6 kcal/mol higher than the wild-type. These results are
consistent with experimental data from deep mutational scanning and flow cytometry, which
found that all naturally occurring mutants have a similar degree of expression and a similar
binding affinity for ACE2 as in the wild-type 13. Our own analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome
evolution 15 during the current pandemic has identified G476S, S477N, T478I, and V483A as
mutations that have appeared in the RBD and are clustered within Loop 3 (Fig. 2d). Similar to
the simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex 12, the MD simulations of the mutants of the
unbound RBD in this work do not show large perturbing effects on the average conformational
state. This suggests that while these mutants may have an impact on the stability of the binding

interface with ACE2, they do not greatly perturb the conformational state of the RBD in solution
and may even serve to reduce the conformational sampling of the unbound RBD.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has focused the collective scientific
community to quickly provide both knowledge and action to help alleviate the effects of this
crisis. In this work, our data indicate that common mutations identified in the Loop 3 region of
the CoV2-RBD are fairly non-perturbing and do not affect its conformational flexibility and
sampling in an unbound solution state, suggesting a therapeutic designed to target this region
may be broadly applicable to RBDs with mutations in this region. In addition, we have identified
unique conformations of the unbound CoV2-RBD in solution that naturally block the binding
interface with ACE2 and may be interesting targets for drug design to interfere with RBD-ACE2
binding. We hope that these results will help to catalyze future identification of therapies relevant
to CoV2 or to future coronaviruses that may emerge.
4. Materials and Methods
Preparation of Initial Structural Models
The structures used to model the wild-type RBD’s were taken from the Coronavirus Structural
Taskforce (https://github.com/thorn-lab/coronavirus_structural_task_force), which further
refined the high-resolution structures determined by X-ray diffraction of CoV1-RBD in
complex with a neutralizing antibody (PDB: 2dd8) and of CoV2-RBD in complex with the
human ACE2 receptor (PDB: 6m0j). In order to isolate the RBD for subsequent MD
simulations, the protein modelling platform Pyrosetta 17 was employed to remove the ACE2
receptor residues and RBD glycans from the model, leaving only the clean RBD residues. The 4
selected mutants (G476S, S477N, T478I, V483A) were then generated from the clean wild-type
RBD structure by creating a decoy of the wild-type structure in Pyrosetta and restricting for the
selected mutation. These mutant decoys were then relaxed based on the ref2015_cst score
function within Pyrosetta 27. One-hundred energy minimized decoys for each mutant were
generated in this protocol, and the lowest energy decoy for each mutant RBD was selected as the
starting structure for MD simulation.
Rosetta Loop Modelling
Loop 3 variant structures of the wild-type RBD were generated using the lowest energy decoy of
the wild-type RBD, using the same protocol as described for the mutant models. The loop being
modelled was defined from residues 472-490 in Pyrosetta with jumps in the foldtree introduced
at residue 470, 481, and 492. The Pyrosetta KinematicMover 17,27 was then used to search for a
different conformation in the loop carbon backbone with residues 472 and 490 as pivots. Only
conformations maintaining the critical disulfide between C480 and C488 were selected to output
a decoy, and this protocol was run until 100 decoys had been generated. All 100 decoys were
then relaxed based on the ref2015_cst score function using Pyrosetta 27. Once again, 100 energy
minimized structures for each initial loop decoy were generated and 5 loop structures were
chosen at random for Molecular Dynamics simulations. The lowest energy decoy of each of the 5
loop structures was used for MD simulation.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
All of the water molecules in the initial X-ray structure were removed. Each protein was
immersed in a truncated octahedral box of OPC water molecules 28 with the box border at

least 20 Å away from any atoms of the RBD. Each system was neutralized by adding counter
ions (Cl- or Na+). The protein was treated with the ff19SB force field 29. The simulations were
performed with the GPU-enabled CUDA version of the pmemd module in the AMBER 2018
package 30. Prior to MD simulation, the systems were subjected to energy minimizations and
equilibration. The minimization started with 1000 steps of steepest descent minimization
followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. The system was heated from 0 to
300 K over 100 ps with protein position restraints of 10 kcal mol-1 A-2. Then a series of
equilibrations (each lasting 10 ns) were performed at constant temperature of 300 K and
pressure of 1 atm with protein position restraints that were incrementally released (10.0, 1, 0.1
and 0 kcal mol-1 A-2). Periodic boundary conditions were used, and electrostatic interactions
were calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method 31,32, with the non-bonded cutoff set to 9
Å. The SHAKE algorithm 33 was applied to bonds involving hydrogen, and a 2 fs integration
step was used. Pressure was held constant at 1 atm with a relaxation time of 2.0 ps. The
temperature was held at 300 K with Langevin dynamics and a collision frequency of 5.0 ps-1.
The production runs for wild-type CoV1-RBD and wild-type CoV2-RBD are 4 µs, for the
CoV2-RBD mutants are 2 µs, and for the CoV1-RBD and CoV2-RBD loop models are 750
ns.
All analysis of MD trajectories, including the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), rootmean-square fluctuation (RMSF), hierarchical agglomerative clustering, Molecular
Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy calculation, and the
extraction of representative structures from trajectories were performed using CPPTRAJ 34 as
implemented in AMBER18. Visualization of structures was performed with UCSF Chimera
35
. Cluster analysis was performed on the binding interface towards ACE2 of SARS-CoV-RBD
and SARS-CoV2-RBD (residues 432-492 for SARS-CoV-RBD and residues 445-506 for
SARS-CoV2-RBD, respectively) using the average-linkage hierarchical agglomerative
method 18. Coordinate RMSD was used as the distance metric. The critical distance ε value
was set to 1.9 Å and the sieve value was set to 10. Only the backbone C, CA, and N atoms
were used in the clustering.

Figure 2. Four loops in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD form the binding interface with ACE2 and
harbor several single amino acid substitutions identified during the COVID-19 pandemic.
(a) The CoV2-RBD (PDB 6m0j) showing the 4 different loops that make up the binding
interface (green and pink). Residues 438-450 (CoV2) or residues 425-437 (CoV) make up Loop
1, residues 455-470 (CoV2) or residues 442-457 (CoV) make up Loop 2, residues 471-491
(CoV2) or residues 458-477 (CoV) make up Loop 3, and residues 495-508 (CoV2) or residues
481-494 (CoV) make up Loop 4. (b) Prediction of natively disordered regions using the Protein
Disorder prediction System (PrDOS) webserver 11 for CoV-RBD (left) and CoV2-RBD (right).
PrDOS was used without template-based prediction and thus reports only on the disorder
probability of the local amino acid composition. A prediction false positive rate of 5% was used,
and values above the 50% threshold (dotted line) indicate regions of predicted disorder. (c) The 5
most common mutations of the RBD identified during the first 6 months of the COVID-19
pandemic, with 4 of these being located in the loop regions of the binding interface. A complete
list of RBD mutants can be found in Table S1. (d) Depictions of the side-chains of the mutant
residues contained in Loop 3 that are studied in the current work.

RBD. (Left Side) Snapshots from 750 ns of MD simulations of 5 different loop model structures
of the SARS-CoV RBD are shown on the periphery, with the average structure from each
simulation overlaid in the center. The bottom box shows the sampling of Loop 3 conformational
space from overlaid average structures. (Right Side) Snapshots from 750 ns of MD simulations
