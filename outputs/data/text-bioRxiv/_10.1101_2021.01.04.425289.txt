Summary

2

Drugs targeting host proteins can act prophylactically to reduce viral burden early in disease and limit

3

morbidity, even with antivirals and vaccination. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a human

4

protease required for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and may represent such a target.1-3 We hypothesized drugs

5

selected from proteins related by their tertiary structure, rather than their primary structure, were likely to

6

interact with TMPRSS2. We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool 3DPhyloFold to

7

systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated

8

effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo.4,5 Several candidate compounds, Avoralstat,

9

PCI-27483, Antipain, and Soybean-Trypsin-Inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection

10

assays. Avoralstat, a clinically tested Kallikrein-related B1 inhibitor,6 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and

11

replication in human airway epithelial cells. In an in vivo proof of principle,5 Avoralstat significantly reduced lung

12

tissue titers and mitigated weight-loss when administered prophylactically to SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice

13

indicating its potential to be repositioned for COVID-19 prophylaxis in humans.

Main

2

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread

3

globally causing over 1,740,000 deaths (WHO). Prophylactic and early-stage therapies are needed for high-

4

risk populations. Even with vaccines, adjunctive therapies that mitigate viral entry or replication may attenuate

5

disease severity and reduce viral spread by asymptomatic and early-stage patients. In response to the urgent

6

need for therapeutics, there is investigation into repositioning existing drugs towards viral proteins (e.g.,

7

Remdesivir). An alternative strategy is to target human proteins utilized by viruses with small molecules. This

8

approach can synergistically with vaccination and may be especially important for individuals where

9

vaccination is contraindicated or deferred, to prevent viral transmission that may occur after vaccination, for

10

front-line workers exposed to repeated high viral load, in countries where sophisticated vaccine delivery and

11

storage is unavailable, and potentially for protection from viral mutation and other viruses using similar host

12

mechanisms.

13
14

Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a human serine protease that is a priming protease for the

15

Spike glycoprotein found on the surface of all coronaviruses.2,3 TMPRSS2’s S1-peptidase domain is required

16

for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host epithelial cells in the upper- and lower-respiratory tract,1,7 but it is not

17

necessary for development or homeostasis in mice, making it an attractive drug target.8 It is yet to be

18

determined whether TMPRSS2 inhibition mitigates SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Camostat, a serine protease

19

inhibitor originally developed for acute pancreatitis, inhibits TMPRSS2 in vitro and is in clinical trials

20

(NCT04321096).4,9 However, Camostat’s plasma half-life is less than one minute, and its efficacy for COVID-

21

19 is yet to be determined.1,10,11 Thus, identification of inhibitors targeting TMPRSS2 with improved

22

pharmacokinetic properties remains important.

23
24

Conventional methods for identifying drug candidates typically employ high-throughput screening (HTS) or in

25

silico screening using compound libraries previously tested in humans.12 In silico screening for TMPRSS2 has

26

been challenging as there is no high-resolution TMPRSS2 molecular structure. Although HTS methods can

27

rapidly screen thousands of compounds, there are certain limitations. HTS methods utilize only a few,

28

generalized experimental parameters with technical limitations, such as narrow dose range and experimental

29

conditions, which may not account for the unique features of each compound. This can lead to false positives

30

and negatives. While false positives are filtered out in subsequent experiments, false negatives may overlook

31

valuable compounds. Because HTS uses shotgun rather than hypothesis-driven approaches, it may be difficult

32

to ascertain the mechanism-of-action, and this may slow the downstream development of candidate drugs into

33

human therapies. Hypothesis-driven screening methods, utilizing protein structures and a limited number of

34

compounds, remains a valuable and complementary strategy for drug-repositioning. One approach to rational-

35

based drug repositioning is to identify proteins with preexisting drugs that are similar to the target protein.

In silico drug repositioning by 3DPhyloFold

2

To identify drug repositioning candidates, we created a computational/hypothesis-driven drug repurposing

3

method called 3DPhyloFold that identifies structurally similar proteins to rationally select candidate inhibitors.10

4

A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of 600 S1-peptidases sequentially related to the TMPRSS2 S1-

5

peptidase domain (TMPRSS2-S1P) showed TMPRSS2-S1P clustered closely to canonical TMPRSS family

6

members, like Hepsin, as well as proteases outside of the TMPRSS subfamily: Coagulation Factor XI and

7

Kallikrein-related B1 (KLKB1; Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). TMPRSS2-S1P was closest to Hepsin, and a

8

homology-based model was generated (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Next, 3DPhyloFold determined the 3D

9

relationship of TMPRSS2-S1P to other S1-peptidase structures (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 2). Using

10

structural quality metrics (see Methods), 74 S1-peptidases and TMPRSS2-S1P were aligned by conventional

11

sequence phylogenetic analysis. TMPRSS2-S1P clustered closely with KLKB1, Factor XI, and Complement

12

Factor I (CFAI) (Fig. 1b). The Kallikrein- and Trypsin-like clades clustered further away, indicating TMPRSS2-

13

S1P was sequentially divergent (Fig. 1b). In 3DPhyloFold, pairwise structural comparisons of the

14

representative tertiary structures were used to calculate a structural dissimilarity matrix (SDM) based on the

15

root mean square deviation between protein alpha-carbons (Ca RMSD; Fig. 1a). A structure-based

16

phylogenetic tree was then generated from the SDM (Fig. 1c). Clustering of the structure-based tree was

17

distinct to that of the sequence-based tree. Proteins close in the primary sequence analysis (e.g., CFAI and

18

CTRB1) were much farther away in the 3DPhyloFold structure-tree (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Although distant

19

in the sequence-based tree, the Trypsin-like clade and Factor VII moved much closer to TMPRSS2-S1P in the

20

structure-based tree (Fig. 1c). This suggested that, while divergent in sequence, TMPRSS2-S1P adopts a

21

three-dimensional fold closer to Trypsin and Factor VII. We prioritized the six S1-peptidases with the highest

22

structural similarity to TMPRSS2-S1P: Hepsin, Acrosin, Trypsin, Factor VII, Factor XI, and KLKB1.

23
24

Using these six proteases, we sought known small-molecules and peptidomimetic inhibitors containing a

25

guanidine, or structurally related groups (see Methods), since S1-peptidases are inhibited by compounds

26

containing a 4-amindinobenzylamide moiety, a key specificity feature of their substrates where the first N-

27

terminal residue at the cleavage site (P1) forms a strong interaction with an aspartate in the corresponding S1

28

subpocket (Fig. 2a).13 This search curated ninety experimental compounds and four small molecules

29

previously tested in human clinical trials, which docked well to TMPRSS2-S1P (Fig. 2b, c; Supplementary

30

Table 3-4; Extended Data Fig. 3). In addition, 3DPhyloFold analysis revealed a natural Trypsin-inhibiting

31

protein based on the structure of porcine-Trypsin with Soybean-Trypsin-Inhibitor (SBTI; PDBID 1AVW; Fig.

32

2c). Since the porcine Trypsin binding pocket was similar to that of TMPRSS2-S1P (~68% sequence identity),

33

we modeled the TMPRSS2-S1P/SBTI complex and identified a conserved inhibitory motif (PYRIRF), with

34

favorable docking suggesting SBTI might bind and inhibit TMPRSS2-S1P (Extended Data Fig. 4;

35

Supplementary Table 4-5).

1

Biochemical evaluation of 3DPhyloFold inhibitors

2

We focused on the inhibitory potential of human drugs available for repositioning, including Avoralstat, PCI-

3

27483, and Antipain, along with SBTI. A biochemical inhibition assay using the extracellular compartment of

4

purified recombinant TMPRSS2 (residues 106 – 492) was utilized to test compounds inhibition.4 The rank

5

order potency against TMPRSS2 was Avoralstat (IC50 = 2.73 ± 0.19 nM), SBTI (IC50 = 121 ± 4 nM), Antipain

6

(IC50 = 748 ± 63 nM), and PCI-27483 (IC50 = 1.41 ± 0.04 µM; Fig. 2d). Inhibition by Avoralstat was as potent as

7

Camostat (IC50 = 1.01 ± 0.10 nM) which targets TMRPSS2 and is currently under clinical investigation for

8

SARS-CoV-2 treatment.4 We further explored the selectivity profile of the four 3DPhyloFold inhibitors and

9

Camostat as a positive control by testing them against six S1-peptidases identified in 3DPhyloFold (i.e.,

10

KLKB1, Trypsin, Factor VIIa, Factor Xa, KLK1, and KLK7), three other proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2

11

infection (i.e., Furin, Mpro, and PLpro), and a negative control Papain. As expected, each 3DPhyloFold

12

compound displayed potent inhibition of its original target-proteases, and there was no inhibition of non-S1-

13

proteases. Strikingly, Avoralstat was more than 18-fold selective towards TMPRSS2 than other S1-protease

14

(Fig. 2e; Supplementary Table 6). Camostat was not as selective as Avoralstat. We further characterized

15

Avoralstat specificity by expanding the protease screen to include additional 60 structurally distant proteases,

16

including MMPs, Caspases, Cathepsins, and cysteine- or aspartyl-proteases.1,14-16 Avoralstat displayed potent

17

inhibition of other S1-proteases consistent with their proximity to TMPRSS2 in the 3DPhyloFold tree, while

18

displaying no inhibition of non-S1-proteases (Fig 2f; Supplementary Table 7), suggesting inhibition was

19

specific and not due to protein aggregation effects. Notably, Avoralstat inhibited several proteins that were

20

structurally similar to TMPRSS2, including Factor VIIa and Tryptase b2, despite being distant in primary

21

sequence (Fig. 2f). Conversely, Avoralstat was less effective at inhibiting proteases that clustered further from

22

TMPRSS2 on the 3DPhyloFold tree: Chymotrypsin (IC50 = >1 µM) and Elastase, (IC50 = >1 µM; Fig. 2g),

23

despite their proximity in the sequence phylogenetic tree. To further confirm that the compounds target the

24

protease domain of TMPRSS2, we tested inhibition using recombinant S1P domain (residues 252 – 489) and

25

found similar inhibition trends (Fig. 2h). Taken together, these results suggested Avoralstat was highly

26

selective for TMPRSS2, consistent with the predictions by structural phylogenetic analysis.

27
28

Cellular evaluation of 3DPhyloFold inhibitors

29

Inhibition of full-length TMPRSS2 (TMPRSS2-FL) proteolytic activity was then tested in cells. TMPRSS2-FL

30

contains an autoproteolysis motif (residues 252-257), which is subject to cleavage and can be used to probe

31

the activity of TMPRSS2 in cells.17 Cells were transfected with either wild-type (WT) or loss of function

32

TMPRSS2-S441A mutant (Fig. 3a; Extended Data Fig. 6). Compared to the inactive S441A mutant,

33

TMPRSS2-WT showed reduced signal by immunoblot as previously reported (Fig. 3a).17 Inhibitor treatment

34

prevented TMPRSS2-FL autoproteolysis and significantly increased the TMPRSS2-FL band intensity (Fig. 3a).

1

To test whether the compounds specifically inhibit the molecular entry-pathway, transduction and infection

2

assays were performed using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirions bearing the SARS-CoV-2

3

Spike glycoprotein and a firefly luciferase reporter. Human Calu-3 2B4 airway cells were incubated with

4

Camostat, Avoralstat, PCI-27483, Antipain, and SBTI. Pseudovirions harboring the pantropic VSV glycoprotein

5

(VSV-G) served as controls since they transduce cells independent of TMPRSS2.18 Indeed, no compounds

6

were toxic to cells and none prevented VSV-G pseudovirus entry, since the luciferase signal remained

7

constant (Fig. 3b). Camostat inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry (EC50 = 0.7 ± 0.2 µM), and Avoralstat

8

displayed similar inhibition (EC50 = 2.8 ± 0.7 µM). PCI-27483, Antipain, and SBTI displayed modest inhibition

9

but were too weak to determine reliable EC50 values (Fig. 3c).

10
11

Next, inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2 was tested in Calu-3 2B4 cells by measuring viral genomes.

12

Camostat, Avoralstat, and Antipain significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication (the amount of nucleocapsid

13

gene [viral RNA] compared to vehicle, respectively; p<0.0001). PCI-27483 and SBTI showed less inhibition

14

(Fig. 3d). A dose-response of Camostat and Avoralstat displayed significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2

15

infection beginning at 100 nM. Camostat and Avoralstat showed more than a ten-fold decrease in viral RNA

16

signal with a 1 μM dose (Fig. 3e). SARS-CoV-2 showed more sensitivity to Avoralstat and Camostat than

17

MERS-CoV, another coronavirus that also uses TMPRSS2 to facilitate entry (Extended Data Fig. 7).9

18
19

Avoralstat inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry in vivo

20

No therapy targeting host sensitizing proteases has been validated in an in vivo model of COVID-19. There is

21

no known viral infection dose or animal model that fully recapitulates human disease, so the critical in vivo

22

measure for testing prophylactic efficacy is the reduction of viral load. Using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2

23

lung infection (Ad5-hACE2 transduced wild-type BALB/c mice5), we compared the efficacy of Avoralstat and

24

Camostat in modifying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cohorts of mice were infected intranasally with either 3 x 103 or

25

1 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Mice were treated with Avoralstat, Camostat (30 mg/kg

26

intraperitoneal injection), or vehicle (DMSO). Lungs were harvested 1 day after infection and viral titers

27

measured by plaque assay. Both Avoralstat and Camostat significantly reduced the lung tissue titers in both

28

cohorts (Fig. 4a-b). In a third cohort of mice, Avoralstat or Camostat was administered 4 hours prior and 4

29

hours after a 1 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Mice were given twice daily drug doses for

30

three days post infection (dpi). Lungs harvested at 5-dpi showed both drugs significantly reduced the viral

31

titers. Strikingly, the lung tissue virus titers were below the limit of detection in 3 of 4 Avoralstat-treated mice

32

(Fig. 4c). Changes in weight, indicating the severity of illness, was monitored. Beginning at 4-dpi, there was

33

significant weight loss in the vehicle- and Camostat-treated mice, while the weight of the Avoralstat-treated

34

mice remained relatively constant suggesting a significant protective effect (Fig. 4d). Even though there was

35

significant weight-loss in Camostat group, an Avoralstat therapeutic effect was observed later at 7-dpi

36

compared to the vehicle-treated groups (Fig. 4d). In a fourth cohort of mice, a biological dose-response was

strongly supported after we further increased the SARS-CoV-2 challenge dose to 1 x 106 PFU. Avoralstat or

2

Camostat were administered 4 hours prior and 4 hours after a SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Mice were

3

then given two drug doses daily for 3-dpi. At the higher challenge dose, an early viral titer reduction was not

4

observed as seen in lower titers (i.e., 3 x 103 or 1 x 105 PFU). Yet a significant decrease of viral titer was

5

observed at 4-dpi for both Avoralstat- and Camostat-treated groups (Fig. 4e). Moreover, Avoralstat still showed

6

a significant weight rescue effect beginning from 7-dpi while Camostat did not show any rescue effect

7

compared to the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 4f). Thus, the inhibitory effect of Avoralstat observed in

8

biochemical and cell assays, extended to prophylactic treatment of mice infected with escalating doses of

9

SARS-CoV-2.

10
11

Drug repositioning is an important strategy to address human disease at a faster pace than conventional drug

12

development, especially in the setting of a global viral pandemic. Avoralstat, a clinically tested oral KLKB1

13

inhibitor evaluated for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, successfully inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection

14

and illness in mice. Avoralstat is orally bioavailable, which could facilitate prophylactic administration to people

15

at high risk for COVID-19, particularly where specialized transport, cold storage, and medically skilled delivery

16

staff are not available. Avoralstat possess a favorable plasma half-life of 12-31 hours, compared to the short

17

half-life of Camostat due to an easily cleavable ester bond, giving it a terminal half-life of roughly 1 hour.

18

19,20,6,21

It is possible that the observed efficacy of Avoralstat compared to Camostat in our in vivo study is due

19

to its longer plasma half-life. Avoralstat has relatively minor and manageable side effects. No grade 3 adverse

20

events were observed in phase 1 through phase 3 clinical trials for Avoralstat and no serious adverse events

21

were more prevalent than those treated compared to placebo groups 6,21.The doses we tested in mice were a

22

significantly lower dose than previously administered to humans in clinical trials, 22 suggesting an appropriate

23

dose of Avoralstat for treating COVID-19 may be readily achievable with reasonable safety.

24
25

The application of a targeted structure-based phylogeny approach allowed us to identify and rationally prioritize

26

several candidate TMPRSS2 inhibitors not considered by other drug repositioning strategies: 3DPhyloFold

27

pointed to closely related proteins missed by primary-sequence comparisons, supporting a mechanism-

28

based/hypothesis-driven selection of curated inhibitor candidates. Many of the small molecules tested in this

29

study could be further developed for alternative routes of administration and for more potency and selectivity

30

against TMPRSS2. The SBTI protein might serve as a cheap and natural source inhibitor for TMPRSS2, since

31

it has been widely used in biomedical research.23 Interestingly, Avoralstat and PCI-27483 were both

32

represented in high throughput screens but may have been missed due to the lack of sufficient testing

33

conditions (e.g. dosage or cell line).24

34
35

Our in vivo studies underscore that targeting TMPRSS2 is a tenable strategy for COVID-19 treatment. A

36

reduction of viral load achieved by an alternative mechanism to that of vaccination could act synergistically to

reduce illness and transmission. In addition, TMPRSS2 is implicated in the cleavage of the envelope-

2

glycoproteins of many other viruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-

3

HKU1, and HCoV-NL63; Influenza viruses; Parainfluenza viruses; and human Metapneumovirus.10 Thus,

4

targeting this host machinery could be applied as a long-term strategy for future zoonotic coronaviruses and

other respiratory viruses. This may be especially important if targeting viral proteins are only partially effective,

natural infection does not confer long-lasting immunity, and combination therapies are needed to reduce the

likelihood of resistance.25

Methods

2

Experimental model and subject details: mice, virus, and cells

3

Specific pathogen-free 6-week-old male and female BALB/c mice and were purchased from Envigo and

4

maintained in the Animal Care Facilities at the University of Iowa. All protocols were approved by the

5

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Iowa. The human serotype 5 adenoviral

6

vector expressing human ACE2 under the control of the CMV promoter was previously described (VVC-

7

McCray-7580; University of Iowa Viral Vector Core).5 The SARS-CoV-2 strains (SARS-Related Coronavirus 2

8

Isolate USA-WA1/2020) were obtained from BEI (Cat. # NR-52281) and Calu-3 2B4 cells (obtained from the

9

Perlman Laboratory, University of Iowa). pVSV-∆G-Luc was previously described.18 Calu-3 2B4 cells were

10

grown in MEM (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20% FBS.

11
12

Database search and sequence alignment

13

We first searched the UniProt database for reviewed entries denoted as transmembrane serine proteases

14

(containing an S1-peptidase domain). This initial search yielded 9 manually curated sequences. A seed

15

multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of S1-peptidase domains was then constructed using MAFFT v7

16

(alignment strategy: FFT-NS-1).26 Using HMMER-3.1 and the seed alignment, we produced an HMM profile

17

and used it to broaden the search against the UniProt database (search restricted to reviewed sequences).27

18

This search yielded a total of 828 S1-peptidase sequences. We discarded fragmented sequences (<200 amino

19

acids) that appeared too short to truly represent the S1-peptidase fold and redundant proteins were further

20

filtered using CD-HIT v4 (100% threshold).28 This resulted in a pool of 742 proteins that were aligned using

21

MAFFT v7 (alignment strategy FFT-NS-2).26 Sequences producing many gaps in the alignment were removed

22

using MaxAlign, resulting in 600 S1-peptidase sequences.29

23
24

Phylogenetic tree reconstruction

25

We used the IQ-TREE-1.6.2 algorithm to generate a maximum likelihood tree of the 600 S1-peptidase

26

sequences.30 The IQ-TREE model finder tool was used to determine the best substitution model to fit the data.

27

The Whelan & Goldman (WAG) substitution model was determined to be the best fit to the data. Bootstrap

28

analysis was performed using the ‘ultra-fast’ method in IQ-TREE-1.6.2 with 1,000 replicas.

29
30

Structural modeling of TMPRSS2-S1P

31

Briefly, a BLAST search of human TMPRSS2-S1P against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) returned the structure

32

of human Hepsin (PDB 1Z8G) as the top hit. Other close matches were KLKB1 (PDB 6ESO), Plasminogen

33

(PDB 4DUR), and Prostatin (PDB 3E16). A TMPRSS2-S1P model was generated with the Hepsin template

34

(41% sequence identity) using Phyre2, MODELLER, and SWISS-Model. The models were in agreement and

35

aligned well with minor variations in surface-exposed loop regions. The TMPRSS2-S1P model was then

36

analyzed by ConSurf as previously described.31 The 600 sequences from our sequence-based phylogenetic

analysis underwent MSA using MAFFT and conservation scores were calculated using the Bayesian method

2

option in ConSurf. The TMPRSS2-S1P binding pocket was inferred by comparison to the structure of Hepsin

3

bound to a peptidomimetic inhibitor (PDB 1Z8G) in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version

4

1.8 Schrödinger, LLC.).

5
6

Structure-based phylogenetic analysis

7

There are over 2,000 structures of S1-peptidase domains represented in the PDB. We therefore searched the

8

Pfam database for structures of mammalian peptidases and selected 74 representative structures

9

(representing the wild-type protein) with an atomic resolution 3.2 Å or better (Supplementary Table 2).32 One

10

structure per unique protein, fitting the above criteria, was selected. Structures (with reflection data deposited

11

in the PDB) were evaluated by their reported global validation metrics in PDB-REDO.33 Re-refined structural

12

models were used for further analysis. Structures were superimposed using PyMOL to calculate the pairwise

13

root mean square deviation (RMSD) between protein alpha carbon atoms (Ca). A structural dissimilarity matrix

14

(SDM) was constructed using the Ca RMSD values in order to generate a phylogenetic tree as previously

15

described.31 To expedite the pairwise alignment process, we developed a Python-based script (named

16

3DPhyloFold) to perform the pairwise alignment of protein structures and generate an SDM. The phylogenetic

17

tree was constructed using the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) method in

18

MEGAX software as previously described.31 For comparison, the sequences from the corresponding structures

19

were also analyzed by sequence-based phylogeny. The 75 S1-peptidase sequences were aligned with MAFFT

20

v7 26 and analyzed in IQ-TREE-1.6.2.30 The Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model was determined to

21

be the best fit to the data. Bootstrap analysis was performed in IQ-TREE-1.6.2 (1,000 replicas). A TMPRSS2-

22

S1P structure similarity score for each analyzed protease was calculated by dividing the pairwise sequence

23

identity (to TMPRSS2-S1P) by the Ca RMSD of the pairwise alignment (Extended Data Fig. 2).

24
25

Database search for S1-peptidase inhibitors

26

We first searched for inhibitors designed for the related proteins. We filtered for cases where a strong

27

Structure-Activity-Relationship (SAR) between the ligand and protein was studied, where applicable. We

28

discarded studies where the inhibitors displayed low potency, focusing on groups of inhibitors that displayed

29

sub-micromolar inhibition for their intended protein. We focused on cases where the inhibitors studied

30

contained a guanidine, or guanidine-like, functional group to interact with the S1 specificity pocket. Inhibitors

31

were then prepared and docked against our TMPRSS2-S1P model.

32
33

In silico docking calculations

34

Published crystal structures of inhibitor-bound Trypsin-3 (PDB 1H4W), KLKB1 (PDB 6O1S), and Factor VII

35

(PDB 1W7X) were loaded into Maestro software (Schrödinger Release 2019-3). The TMPRSS2-S1P model

36

described above was used. The protein preparation wizard was used to prepare the proteins for docking and

simulations. The default parameters were used for the optimization of hydrogen-bond assignment (sampling of

2

water orientations and use of pH 7.0). Waters molecules beyond 3 Å of heteroatoms or with fewer than three

3

hydrogen bonds to non-waters were removed. Restrained energy minimization was applied using the OPLS3e

4

force field. Prepared protein systems were further checked by Ramachandran plots, ensuring there were no

5

steric clashes. To generate receptor grids for small molecule docking, the co-crystalized ligand was selected

6

as the grid-defining ligand for each system. Default van der Waals radius scaling parameters were used

7

(scaling factor of 1, partial charge cutoff of 0.25). For peptides, the grid size was made suitable for peptides to

8

be docked. Default van der Waals radius scaling parameters were used (scaling factor of 1, partial charge

9

cutoff of 0.25). For docking of the ligands into the various prepared proteins, the 3D structure was loaded into

10

Maestro. Ligprep was used to prepare the ligands (by generating possible states at pH 7.0 ± 2.0 and retaining

11

the specified stereochemical properties). The prepared small molecule ligands and peptide fragments were

12

then docked using the most stringent docking mode (extra precision, “XP”) of Glide. Parameters and output

13

files for the Glide runs can be found in Mendeley Data under the dataset identifier (DOI):

14

10.17632/h3pmycddwc.1.

15
16

Docking Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor to TMPRSS2

17

The HADDOCK 2.4 online docking tool was used to generate TMPRSS2-S1P/SBTI complex structure model

18

34

. The TMPRSS2-S1P homology model and the SBTI structure (PDB 1AVW) were used for docking. To define

19

the potential interaction surface between TMPRSS2 and SBTI, the TMPRSS2-S1P homology model was

20

superimposed to the wild boar trypsin structure in complex with SBTI (PDB 1AVW) using PyMOL. The

21

following residues of SBTI were designated as active residues: 501-502, 510, 512- 514, 560-572, and 616-617.

22

The overall Ca RMSD between the two models was 0.54 Å. SBTI was also docked to porcine Trypsin (PDB

23

1AVW), human Factor VII (PDB 1W7X), and human KLKB1 (PDB 6O1S). The HADDOCK scores represent

24

the average score of the best cluster. The parameters and output files for the HADDOCK run can be found in

25

Mendeley Data under the dataset identifier (DOI): 10.17632/h3pmycddwc.1.

Protease activity array

28

Avoralstat, SBTI, PCI-27483, and Antipain were assessed for inhibition against TMPRSS2 and a panel of

29

recombinant proteases by commercial services from Reaction Biology Corp. The Reaction Biology Corp profile

30

tested in a 10-dose IC50 with, in triplicate, a 4-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μM against 11 proteases in Fig.

31

3e and a 3-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μM against 70 proteases in Fig. 3f. Compounds exhibit no

32

fluorescent background that could interfere with the assay. The protease activities were monitored as a time-

33

course measurement of the increase in fluorescence signal from fluorescently labeled peptide substrate, and

34

initial linear portion of slope (signal/min) was analyzed.

1

The human TMPRSS2-S1P sequence (residues 252 - 489) was cloned into a pET28a vector with a N-terminal

2

6x-His tag. Plasmids were amplified and isolated from DH5a cells and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3).

3

BL21 cells expressing TMPRSS2-S1P were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. Cell pellets were resuspended in 35 to

4

50 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole pH 8.0, one tablet of EDTA-free protease

5

inhibitor [Roche; Product # COEDTAF-RO], DNaseI [Roche; Product #11284932001]) and lysed and

6

centrifuged for 30 minutes at 18,000 x g at 4 °C. Pellets were denaturated (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 6 M

7

Guanidinium Chloride, 1 M L-Arginine, 2 mM DTT pH 8.0), resuspended, and filtered with 0.22 µm filter.

8

Refolding buffer-1 (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 M Guanidinium Chloride, 1 M L-Arginine pH 8.0) was applied

9

to SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing (10,000 MWCO; Thermo Scientific™) and underwent refolding by dialyzing in 2 L

10

of refolding buffer-1 at 4 °C. After the over-night refolding, the sample was filtered with 0.22 µm filter to remove

11

aggregates and went through another step of dialysis in 2 L of refolding buffer-2 (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,

12

250 mM L-Arginine pH 8.0) for 1.5 hours at room-temperature. Sample was concentrated with a 10 kDa NMWL

13

spin concentrator and passed over a HiLoad® 16/600 Superdex® 200 pg (GE Healthcare, Cat. # 28-9893-35)

14

size-exclusion (SEC) column connected to an ÄTKATM pure fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system

15

(GE Healthcare Inc.). The column was equilibrated with SEC buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). The

16

final purity of recombinant TMPRSS2-S1P used for in vitro assays were >95% (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

17
18

Measurement of TMPRSS2 activity

19

TMPRSS2-S1P proteolytic activity was confirmed by hydrolysis of the synthetic urokinase substrate, Cbz-

20

GGR-AMC (Echelon Biosciences; Product #869-25). An enzyme titration in the presence of 50 µM Cbz-GGR-

21

AMC revealed that maximal TMPRSS2-S1P activity occurred at high nanomolar (250 – 500 nM) protein

22

concentrations (data not shown). The remaining assays were performed as followed: Briefly, 250 nM of purified

23

TMPRSS2-S1P was added to a reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 150 mM NaCl in

24

black-bottom 96-well plates (100 µL per reaction). Inhibition experiments were carried out in the presence of 50

25

µM Cbz-GGR-AMC in the presence 10 to 500 µM compound: Camostat (Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. # SML0057),

26

Avoralstat (MedChemExpress; Cat. # HY-16735), PCI-27483 (Cayman Chemical; Item #21334), Antipain

27

(Sigma-Aldrich; Product #A6191), Leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich; Product #L2884), MDL-28170 (Sigma-Aldrich;

28

Product #M6690), Ritonavir (Sigma-Aldrich; Product #SML0491), or 5% DMSO (as a negative control). DMSO

29

caused SBTI (Roche; Product #10109886001) to precipitate out of solution (unpublished observation).

30

Inhibition experiments with SBTI (2 to 150 µM) were therefore performed in the absence of DMSO. Reactions

31

were run at 37 °C for 30 minutes on a fluorimetric plate reader (Tecan Spark, Männedorf Switzerland).

32

Proteolytic activity was measured as change in raw fluorescence units (∆RFU; λexc = 373 nm, λem = 455 nm) at

33

30-second intervals. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The initial velocity (RFU/sec) of the reaction

34

was measured by calculating the slope of the fluorescence data from the first three minutes. Kinetic

35

parameters were then calculated by direct fitting to the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equation in GraphPad Prism 8

TMPRSS2 autoproteolysis assay

5

HEK 293T cells (ATCCÒ Cat. # CRL-3216) were obtained from the Viral Vector Core Facility at the University

6

of Iowa. Cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine

7

serum (Gibco), penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, WT15140-122) and were maintained in a humidified

8

atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plasmid pEGFPN1 was obtained from Clontech. TMPRSS2-FL cDNA

9

(pcDNA3.1-SARS-2-S-C9; obtained from the Gallagher Laboratory, Loyola University Medical Center, Illinois).

10

Briefly, TMPRSS2-FL cDNA, containing a C-terminal anti-FLAG epitope tag, were amplified with PCR using

11

pCMV-Sport6-TMPRSS2 template. The amplificates were cloned into pCAGGS.MCS via SacI and XhoI sites.

12

The enzymatically-inactive pCAGGS-TMPRSS2(S441A)FLAG mutant cDNA was generated using

13

QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit per manufacturer instructions (Agilent Technologies). Transient

14

transfections of HEK-293T cells were performed using PolyFect transfection reagent per manufacturer

15

instructions (Qiagen). For transfection, 2 μg of each plasmid (GFP [served as negative control], TMPRSS2 WT

16

and S411A mutant) were dissolved in serum free media. PolyFect (20 μL) was added to the DNA solution

17

followed by 10-minute incubation at room temperature. Growth media (0.6 mL) was then added to the reaction

18

tubes and the transfection mix was immediately added onto the cells. 24 hours post-transfection, cell lysates

19

were prepared using HNB buffer containing 0.1% protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, #P2714), incubated on ice

20

for 20 minutes and centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes. Supernatants were collected and protein

21

concentration determined by DC protein assay reagent kit (BioRad). After separation by SDS-PAGE (4 to 12%

22

Bis-Tris gradient gel), proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked for 1-hr at room

23

temperature using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST. Membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-Flag

24

antibody (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich; Cat. #F3165) for 16 hours at 4° C. Blots were then washed three times with

25

TBST (10 minutes/wash) and subsequently incubated with immunoglobulin-G labelled with horseradish

26

peroxidase conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:5,000; Thermo Scientific™; Cat. #31432). Proteins

27

were visualized by SuperSignalTM West Pico PLUS chemiluminescence reagent on a MyECL imager (Thermo

28

Scientific™). Membranes were re-probed with β-actin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. #A2228) as a loading

29

control. The TMPRSS2-FL band intensity of each lane was normalized using the band intensity of

30

corresponding β-actin loading control. Then, the normalized intensity of each lane was converted to the relative

31

band intensity by comparison to the normalized band intensity of TMPRSS2-S441A in the same gel. The

32

analyzed densitometry data from the total of 5 gel runs in Fig. 3A and Extended Data Fig. 6 were combined.

33

Data were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism

34

8.0. Differences of p<0.0332 were considered statistically significant.

1

HEK-293T cells were transfected to express either the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (with the cytoplasmic tail

2

removed; residues 1 - 1255) or the full-length Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-G protein. Then, these cells

3

were transduced with a VSV vector expressing luciferase (VSV-∆G-Luc), and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2

4

spike protein or VSV-G. After 2 hours at 37° C, the cells were washed 3 times to remove residual virus.

5

Supernatant containing pseudovirus was harvested 3 times at 24-hour intervals and centrifuged to remove

6

cellular debris. Pseudovirus from the 3 collections was pooled and ultracentrifuged through a 20% sucrose

7

cushion for purification and concentration (100x). For the transduction assays, Calu-3 2B4 cells were grown in

8

96-well plates until confluent. Cells were incubated with the respective compounds for 1 hour at 37° C. After 1

9

hour, cells were transduced with pseudovirus, maintaining the same concentration of compounds, and

10

incubated overnight. Transduction efficiency was assessed by quantifying luciferase activity in cell lysates

11

using a commercial kit (Luciferase Assay System, Promega, Cat. #E1500) and a plate-reading luminometer

12

(SpectraMax i3x, Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple

13

comparisons test using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Differences of p<0.0332 were considered statistically significant.

Infectious SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay

16

The 2019n-CoV/USA-WA1/2019 strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Accession number: MT985325.1) used in these

17

studies was passaged on Calu-3 2B4 cells and sequence verified. Calu-3 2B4 cells were plated in 48 well

18

plates. Cells were incubated with medium containing indicated compounds or vehicle for 1 hour at 37° C. The

19

medium was removed and SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.1) in medium containing indicated compounds were added

20

into each well. The cells were incubated with viruses for 1 hour at 37 °C. Next, the viruses were removed, and

21

cells were rinsed with PBS once to remove remaining viruses. After that, cells were incubated with medium

22

containing indicating compounds overnight. Following day, Total cellular RNA was isolated using Directzol

23

RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, Cat. # R2052) from TRIzol (Invitrogen; Cat. #15596018). A DNase

24

treatment step was included. Total RNA (500 ng) was used for cDNA syntheses by High-Capacity cDNA

25

Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems; Cat. # 4368814). Realtime PCR was applied to quantify viral

26

genomic RNA and HPRT mRNA levels (SARS-2-N1-F primer: GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT; SARS-2-N1-R

27

primer: TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG; Human HPRT-F primer: AGGATTTGGAAAGGGTGTTTATTC;

28

Human HPRT-R primer: CAGAGGGCTACAATGTGATGG; Integrated DNA Technologies). The relative

29

abundance of viral genomic RNA normalized to HPRT was calculated and presented as 2-ΔCT. All the data were

30

analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple

31

comparisons test. Differences of p < 0.0332 were considered statistically significant.

Transduction and infection of mice

34

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (87.5 mg/kg ketamine/12.5 mg/kg xylazine) and transduced

35

intranasally with 2.5 x 108 FFU of Ad5-ACE2 in 75 mL DMEM. Five days post transduction, mice were infected

36

intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 (3 x 103 or 1 x 105 PFU) in a total volume of 50 mL DMEM. Infected mice were

either four hours before and after being challenged by virus, or two doses per day (8 to 9 hours apart) for three

3

days post infection. Virus titers were measured in harvested lungs by plaque assay 1-day post infection. The

4

weight was monitored for 6 days post infection. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s

SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay

8

Lung homogenate supernatants were serially diluted in DMEM. Vero E6 cells in 12 well plates were inoculated

9

at 37 ºC in 5% CO2 for 1 hour with gentle rocking every 15 minutes. After removing the inocula, plates were

10

overlaid with 1.2% agarose containing 10% FBS. After further incubation for 3 days, overlays were removed,

11

and plaques were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Viral titers were calculated as plaque forming

12

units (PFU) per lung. All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in the Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) Laboratories

13

of the University of Iowa. These studies were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and

14

Use Committee.
