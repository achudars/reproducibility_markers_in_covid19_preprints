Abstract
The novel ​coronavirus ​disease 2019 (​COVID​-​19​) pandemic has disrupted modern societies and their
economies. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases as part of the second wave is observed across Europe
and the Americas. The scientific response has enabled a complete structural characterization of the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the most relevant
proteins required by the novel coronavirus to facilitate the cell entry mechanism is the spike protein
trimer. This protein possesses a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds the cellular
a​ngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ​and then triggers the fusion of viral and host cell
membranes. In this regard, a comprehensive characterization of the structural stability of the spike
protein is a crucial step to find new therapeutics to interrupt the process of recognition. On the other
hand, it has been suggested the participation of more than one RBD as a possible mechanism to
enhance cell entry. Here we discuss the protein structural stability based on the computational
determination of the dynamic contact map and the energetic difference of the spike protein
conformations via the mapping of the hydration free energy by the Poisson-Boltzmann method. We
expect our result to foster the discussion of the number of RBD involved during recognition and the
repurposing of new drugs to disable the recognition by discovering new hotspots for drug targets apart
from the flexible loop in the RBD that binds the ACE2.
INTRODUCTION
Each year numerous diseases are caused in humans by life-threatening viruses (as classified by the
World Health Organization (WHO), e.g., the seasonal flu (influenza A and B), yellow fever, ebola,
rabies, coronaviruses (CoVs), among others). Although CoVs were only associated with a common
cold, for the first time in 2002, a new kind of CoV led to the medical condition known as the severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). This new disease was discovered in southern China and
infected more than 8000 people in 27 countries, causing 774 deaths worldwide​1​. Later, in 2011 a more

deadly coronavirus emerged in the middle east and was named the Middle East Respiratory Diseases
(MERS) as it mostly affected people in Saudi Arabia (infected 4985 cases and 858 deaths) with a high
fatality rate of 34% that was almost four times larger than the previous outbreak​2​. However, neither of
those previous outbreaks stressed the worldwide health system and economy 3​ more than the novel
coronavirus. The WHO has labeled the novel coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2 due to its structural
similarity with SARS-CoV, and the disease caused by it as COVID-19. On March 11, 2020, the
WHO officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic.. As of October 30, 2020, almost
45M confirmed cases with a death toll over 1M around the world have been reported. Thus, there is an
urgent need to understand the molecular features of each of the proteins that are assembled into the
virion. The characterization of the conformational changes related to proteins that compose the
structure of the virus and its connection with the high spreading of the disease are crucial steps, which
in turn will permit the development of more effective therapeutics for fighting against the disease,
early prevention as well as controlling future outbreaks.
The fast spread of COVID-19 around the globe has triggered the immediate response of the scientific
community that aims to understand the pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus and in particular the
molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 during cell entry which can aid to devise viral deactivation
strategies prior to cell recognition or block the viral replication mechanism, among others 4​​ . A key
component in all coronavirus associated with cell entry is the spike protein (S) and thus its structural
characterization is an essential step 5,6​
​ . The typical spike protein is a homotrimer system responsible
for the “corona” (Latin word for crown) appearance in all coronaviruses, and it plays a crucial role in
the interaction between the virion and the host human cell membranes. The spike protein attaches
itself to specific cellular receptors (i.e., human angiotensin-converting enzyme–ACE2) 7,8
​ and
undergoes several conformational changes that engage different protein domains (e.g. receptor
binding domain-(RBD), N-terminal domain-NTD, S1, and S2 subunits) (see Figure 1). The first
process that is believed to occur relates to the transition from down to up receptor-binding domain
conformation. This transition prepares the virus for binding to the ACE2 receptor and the subsequent
internalization of the virus through the formation of the endosome, later fusion of the viral and cell
membranes, and the final release of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm 9​​ . It is clear that the spike
protein is a crucial component in each aspect of the cell entry mechanism. Several studies 5,10–14
​
have
elucidated how the novel coronavirus takes advantage of the spike protein structure to outperform
SARS-CoV. For instance, the characterization of the mechanical stability of the RBD of
SARS-CoV-2 has shown it to be stiffer (greater by 50 pN) compared to SARS-CoV 15​
​ . This result has
important consequences during binding ACE2 (pre-fusion state) 16​
​ , as it can withstand Brownian and
cellular forces and ​yet maintain close contact while priming of the spike protein by transmembrane
protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) occurs as part of S1 dissociation from S2 that enables the post-fusion

mechanism 16,17​
​ . In addition, ​in silico ​studies found a space correlation between the ​polybasic furin

cleavage ​site ​Q677​
​ TNSPRRAR↓SV​687 ​and surface residues located in the RBD region that recognize

the ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2. Such effect was mediated by a long-range electrostatic interaction 10 nm
apart 18​
​ . Furthermore, the mutant D614G (a single aa change, D = aspartic acid by G =

glycine) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence, which began spreading in Europe in
February and became the dominant form globally at the end of March, displayed stronger
transmissibility 19​
​ . Also, this mutation correlated residues that are located about 7–10 nm
from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD 18​
​ . Certainly, ​it has also been suggested that those features in the
spike protein could enhance its transmissibility and facilitate the post-fusion machinery in
SARS-CoV-2 20​
​ . The intrinsic flexibility of the full ectodomain dictated by three hinges was
characterized by cryo-EM and large-scale MD simulation 21​
​ . It shows the flexibility of the spike
protein and the ability of the spike head to ​explore different orientations in space which allows it to
scan the host cell surface in search of ACE receptors​. A recent cryo-EM study has found a free fatty
acid pocket in each RBD 22​
​ . The binding of the linoleic acid (LA) ​stabilizes a locked conformation
giving rise to reduced ACE2 interaction in vitro​. The sugar coating of the surface in the spike protein
by glycans are not only shielding to evade the immune system response as commonly believed 23​
​ , but
also they may play a structural role by ​modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike’s RBD
that is responsible ​for cell recognition ​24​.
In order to fight against COVID-19 several medical strategies are developed by targeting the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein such as the development of viral vector and protein-based vaccines 25
​ and
monoclonal antibodies treatment such as regeneron cocktail that blocks the virion by binding to RBD
26​,​27​

. New efforts in novel therapeutics employing short peptides, proteins, and natural resources such

as plant derivatives are yet new ways for disabling the virion at the level of the spike protein 28–31​
​
. In
this regard, ​a stabilized form of spike protein with all RBD in down or one (or two) RBD in the up
conformation is desirable for vaccine and therapeutic development because this conformation displays
most of the neutralizing epitopes that can be targeted by antibodies to prevent cell entry 6,32​
​ . These
stabilized structures contain two consecutive proline substitutions in the S2 subunit in a turn between
the central helix (CH) and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) that is important during the transition to a single,
elongated α-helix in the postfusion conformation. Prefusion-stabilized spikes in closed and open states
have been used to determine high-resolution spike structures by cryo-EM 5​​ ,​7 that has been crucial for
large-scale MD simulation restricted to microsecond time scale. ​However, even with these

substitutions, the SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain is unstable without the ACE2 receptor and
typically difficult to express on mammalian cells, hampering biochemical research and search
for novel vaccines. A recent smFRET study characterizes the ensemble of conformations

occurring in the spike which seems to be part of a dynamic equilibrium 33​
​ , but it does not lead
to a quantitative assessment of the relative stability between conformers. A multiscale
modeling that employs structure-based coarse-graining has shown the existence of a dynamic
asymmetry that triggers the change in conformation of the closed to open states and the
characteristic free-energy landscape shows the closed conformation as the ground state 33,34​
​ .
Here we show an analysis of the relative stability taking into account dynamic contact map
analysis. ​Our study shows the correlation between different conformations of the spike protein and its
RBD, NTD, and S2 subunits and highlights the role of destabilization in order to get access to other
conformations. ​This tool also allows determination of stable “hotspots” across the amino acid

sequences and possible new targets for therapeutics. In addition, we obtain free energy
differences between states of the spike protein without ACE2.

Modeling of the full SARS-CoV-2 spike structures
The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein conformations in the closed and open states were modeled with
all RBD in down conformation and with one or two RBD in the up position. The different
conformations studies correspond to three RBD in the down position (3down), one RBD in the up and
two RBD in the down positions (1up2down) and two RBD in the up and one RBD in the down
position (2up1down). They were reconstructed based on cryo-EM structures with PDB codes 6VXX,
6VSB and 6X2B respectively. The wild-type (WT) sequences that describe the spike protein come
from QIQ50172.1 stored in the GenBank database for SARS-CoV-2. The trimeric cryo-EM structures
comprise mainly the sequence A27-S1147. In order to stabilize the cryoEM pre-fusion state several
mutations were implemented, e.g. P986K and P987V​5​. In structure files (PDB), however, there are
missing residues that must be fulfilled to get the correct WT model, as well as, some residues that
must be mutated to reconstruct the WT type. In particular, using as reference QIQ50172.1 starting at
residue MET 1, residues ALA 570, THR 572, GLN 607, GLY 614, ARG 682, ARG 683, ARG 685,
PHE 855, ASN 856, LYS 986, and VAL 987 were replaced from original PDB structures to
reconstruct the WT sequence. The standard Needleman–Wunsch algorithm was used as implemented
by Chimera visualization software to align the sequences and the missing loops were modeled by
homology using MODELLER 35
​ and a few steps of energy minimization algorithms. The disulfide
bonds were the ones prescribed by the PDB files and 14 per single chain of the spike homotrimer.

force fields. System energy was minimized using the CPU version
of pmemd, while heating, equilibration, and production simulation stages used GPU pmemd.
SARS-CoV-2 systems 3down, 1up2down, and 2up1down were solvated in octahedral water shells of
14 ​Å​, 12 ​Å​, and 16 ​Å​, respectively. Disulfide bonds (DBs) were added between cysteine residues
identified in the initial models as being close enough for a DB bond to form. The DBs were added
using tLeap. The NaCl concentration for all simulations was 0.150 M NaCl. In order to use a 4 fs time
step, the hydrogen mass repartitioning was applied to the protein​39​. SHAKE was applied to hydrogens,
and an 8 ​Å real-space cutoff ​was used. For long-range electrostatics we utilized PME with periodic
boundary conditions. Minimization included 2000 steps of steepest descent followed by 3000 steps of
conjugate gradient method. The heating protocol used : (1) Heating from 0 to 100 K (50 ps) in NVT,
and (2) heating from 100 to 300 K (100 ps) in NPT. During minimization and heating restraints of 10
kcal mol​-1 ​Å-2​ ​were applied to C​α atoms. Subsequently, equilibration at 300 K was carried out and C​α

restraints were gradually reduced from 10 kcal mol​-1 ​Å-2​ ​to 0.1 kcal mol​-1 ​Å-2​ over 6 ns. For the
production simulations, restraints were released and 200 ns and 320 ns unrestrained production

simulations were carried out for 3down and 1up2down SARS-CoV-2 conformations respectively and
100 ns for 2up1down case. Production simulations started from the final equilibrated coordinates, and
for each system five replicas were simulated. Pressure of 1 atm was maintained using the Monte Carlo
barostat, and a temperature of 300 K was maintained during production using the Langevin thermostat
(collision frequency 1 ps​-1​), as implemented in Amber18 36​
​ . In aggregate, 2.3 ​μ​s of all-atom MD
simulation data was used for this work. Snapshots from the MD simulations can be found in a Zenodo
repository ​40​.
Differential Contact Map (dCM) analysis
The contact map (CM) determination considers the VdW interaction between residues that are
typically captured by a geometric based-approach denoted by extended overlap (OV) of the VdW
spheres, which has been successfully used before to describe single proteins 41–44​
​
. Furthermore, the
chemical character of the residues can be also included as an additional part of the CM determination.
The latter is denoted as the rCSU approach, which considers the chemical character of each atom, and
respective possible bonds between two residues, into categories that count the number of stabilizing
and destabilizing contacts per residue, defining a contact when both residues have a net stabilizing
character. Together they form a robust CM methodology known as OV+rCSU contact map 45
​ that has
been validated in the dynamic of large protein complexes 46–50​
​
. This approach is used to get structural
information from a specific geometry. This methodology is reliable enough to describe relatively
small globular protein molecules. However, when applying it at a larger complex system, we may
include contacts between residues that are not relevant to the system, e.g., contacts that belong to
solvent-exposed flexible loops are less structurally relevant to describe a protein than the ones
between residues of ​α-helices and ​β​-strands. To get only the most structural relevant contacts, we can
use the information available from the molecule's dynamics. Computing the contact maps for each
frame from a subset of MD frames, we can count how many times a given contact was identified.
Then, a contact has a ​frequency​, freq, defined by the number of frames where it was found over the
total number of frames analyzed. This procedure gives a low frequency for contacts between flexible
parts of the protein, while highly stable structures exhibit high frequency.
Here, we use this methodology to sweep evenly distributed frames of the equilibrium MD trajectory
of each system studied in this article to dynamically determine the high frequency contacts (freq> 0.9)
between amino acids. In particular, from 10,000 frames of the closed conformation, we obtained a
total number of 29,334 ± 82 contacts, 8,000 frames for the 1up2down conformation showing 29,320 ±
741 contacts, as well as 8,340 frames for 2up1down case with 29,055 ± 718 contacts, which is a
robust standard deviation of less than 3% from the total number of contacts. The source of contact
fluctuations are essentially flexible loops that account for approximately 1772 amino acids based on

secondary structural analysis, while helices and strands are approximately represented by 712 and 819
residues, respectively. The whole spike protein has a total of 3363 residues. Our objective is to discern
between relevant and not relevant contacts, and a moving coil that eventually creates a contact is
obviously less stable than a secondary structure. These small deviations in the number of contacts, and
the consequent contacts frequencies, allow us to differentiate between relevant and not relevant
contacts for the system’s structural stability, which is the main advantage of this methodology
compared to a static analysis based on only one frame mostly taken from X-ray/NMR crystallography.
To be able to compute such a large amount of contact maps, we implemented our own contact map
software that implements the OV+rCSU approach, as detailed in Ref. 45​
​ , and available via Zenodo
repository ​40​.
Poisson Boltzmann calculations for the spike protein energetic characterization
Rather than considering water molecules explicitly, an implicit solvent model averages their influence
in a continuum dielectric description​51​. Then, a dissolved molecule is represented as a multi-dielectric
infinite domain with, at least, two regions ---the solute and the solvent--- interfaced by the
solvent-excluded surface (SES). This situation in the case of the spike proteins is divided in two
regions:
●

Coronavirus spike protein structures (𝛀​1​).

●

External (𝛀​2​), representing the solver.

Each region is characterized by its dielectric constant (𝛆​1​, 𝛆​2​), and salt concentration (​C1​ ,​ ​C​2​), which is
considered as zero in the solute. For simplicity, we will use parameters that are proper for a solvent in
the external region (𝛀​2​).
The partial charges in the solute are represented as static point charges at the locations of the atoms,
whereas the salt ions in the solvent are considered as mobile point charges that arrange according to
Boltzmann statistics. Applying continuum electrostatic theory on this arrangement gives rise to a
system of coupled partial differential equations, where the potential inside the solute is governed by
Poisson, and in the solvent by Poisson-Boltzmann:
∇​2​ϕ​1​ = ∑​kq​ k​ ​δ(​ ​r​k)​

Here, 𝚽 is the electrostatic potential, 𝛋 is the inverse of the Debye length (which depends on the salt

SES on the outside of the Spike protein, interfacing 𝛀​1 with 𝛀​2​. The unit vector ​n is normal to the
SES, and points away from the region enclosed by the surface.
The most common quantity of interest is the solvation energy, which is the work required to bring the
solute from vacuum into the solvent. Considering that the charges inside the solute are Dirac delta
functions, this energy becomes

In this work, we use the Poisson-Boltzmann solver PyGBe​52 to compute the electrostatic potential and
energy in equations Eq. 1 and Eq. 3. PyGBe formulates the system of partial differential equations in a
boundary integral form, requiring to mesh the SES only, and solves the resulting system with a
boundary element method (BEM)​53​. From a viewpoint of MD simulation trajectories, we based the PB
initial structures to be meshed on the final snapshots of the MD trajectories for the three studied spike
proteins. In addition to the structural positions the charges and vdW radii are also required by the PB
solver to calculate solvation and Coulomb energies, mostly given in a pqr format. . Here, we remark
that PB-energies provide a static picture of the solvation and Coulomb energies at a certain point of
the MD simulations trajectory. In this case we employed the final MD conformation snapshots of the
different simulation replicas​40​ corresponding to the three systems under consideration.
RESULTS
Relative stability analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein conformation
The characterization of the full space of conformations of the spike protein and the intrinsic stability
by MD dynamics simulation is still limited by the length and time scales needed to sample the
conformational space of the spike protein. In a recent study carried out by smFRET 33
​ the closed and
open conformations were sampled by tagging certain amino acids in the NTD and RBD regions and
monitoring their positions in space. In particular, this methodology allows the reconstruction of a

restricted free energy landscape that shows a high stability for the closed state over the open, as it is
believed in the absence of the ACE2 receptor. However, it does not highlight the amino acid regions
or the hotspots of stability which can be used for therapeutics by developing small drugs that bind
those regions and disrupt the stability associated with them. In MD simulation the transition from
closed to open states is only possible via large forces acting on the RBD in a nonequilibrium fashion.
This protocol captures the transitions but it is only thermodynamically consistent in the limit of a large
number of pathways through the Jarzynski equality 51​
​ . In this section we define the local stability of
the homotrimer spike protein defined by the difference of the number of native contacts associated
with single amino acids between two conformations. The change of the number of contacts under a
conformational change shows a measure of the loss or gain of the local stability. We test our dCM
methodology on three different conformations of the spike protein. As a result we report the number
of destabilizing residues and contact set for each conformation in Table 1. Based on our analysis the
1up2down conformation shows less number of destabilizing residues than the 2up1down
conformation. However, the stabilizing aa residues per protomer in up conformation seems to be
comparable. Here we prove that among the two studied conformations of the open state the most
stable is the 1up2down system. In Table 1 we report the number of the destabilizing and stabilizing
residues and their corresponding high-frequency (​freq > 0.9) contacts. At first, we observe the large
number of destabilizing residues 92 and 502 which account for 3% and 15% of the total system for
3down to 1up2down and 3down to 2up1down respectively. This is an indication that a transition from
closed state to 1up2down implies the destabilization of a small number of native contacts. However,
such a type of transition is more serious as it destabilizes several parts of the protein once it exposes 2
RBD in up conformation. Note that a small gain in stability is reported in very key places of the spike
protein such as flexible loops that are engaged in cell recognition at the RBD (chain B) and stabilized
by formation of new intrachain contacts. In the absence of ACE2 our study renders the open state less
stable than the closed state which is in agreement with smFRET study 33
​ that identifies the closed state
as the most populated state in the lack of ACE2. Moreover, our study shows an additional structural
stability associated with almost twice more high-frequency contacts in 1up12own than 2up1down
conformations (see Table 1).

forming 40 contacts (see Fig. 4B). Such conformational transition emerges through the rearrangement
of certain residues located at the bottom of the RBD, close to the hinge region (H519-S530) in chain
B that change conformation and breaks 10 high-frequency contacts between hinge region and S2 in
chain A in order to transit to the new position. By considering a range of energy values for native
contacts in protein, i.e. 1.0-1.5 kcal/mol. The energy associated with the hinge regions in the 3down to
1up2down transition will be in the range of 10-15 kcal/mol. The identification of the residues that
create contacts to stabilize a conformation is of great importance for novel therapeutic methods that
can target binding to enhance or disrupt the established contacts for a given purpose. For instance, the
​ has unveiled a free fatty acid (FFA) binding a hydrophobic pocket that
work by ​Toelzer, C. ​et al​. 21
locks the structure of the spike in the closed state (see Figure 4C). Such a process is achieved by
establishing additional contacts between two nearest RBDs through the FFA. Indeed, such a process is
possible due to few pre-existing native contacts in the vicinity of those two RBDs. Those contacts
engage the RBD segment (R408-Q409) in chain B and a gating helix (Y365-Y369) in the other RBD
in chain A. The latter motif is crucial for the transition from apo conformation to FFA conjugated with
protein that has been reported to lock the RBD in the closed state. Our analysis shows the presence of

other stabilizing contacts among the gating helix in a given chain and the next chain namely,
Q409-Y369, Q414-Y369, ​T415-Y369 ​,​G416-Y369, K417-N370, ​K417-Y369 and D420-Y369. Due
to the symmetry in the closed state, the set of contacts are similarly distributed among all chains. In a
recent study by Casalino ​et al. 23
​ has been elucidated the stabilization of the open conformation by two
additional N-glycan at positions N165 and N234, that are located at the NTD in chain A and
according to all-atom MD simulations they modulate the RBD conformational dynamics. Our analysis
further shows the stabilization of the RBD in chain B in up conformation through residues located at
the NTD in chain A, which are close to N165. Here we get ​T167(A)-R357(B), ​F168(A)-R357(B),
E169(A)-R357(B),

and close to N234 we have P230(A)-T523(B), P230(A)-A520(B) and

P230(A)-P521(B). In addition, we also found few residues in RBD in chain A interacting with the
RBD in chain C, both considered in down conformation. Those contacts are K417(A)-Y369(C),
R403(A)-A372(C), T415(A)- P384(C), K417(A)-N370(C) and L455(A)-N370(C) and more
interestingly, we observe an interaction between RBD in up conformation and the closer RBD in

are responsible for stabilization by dashed black lines.

Energetic calculations of the spike protein conformations
The role of electrostatic interactions in the spike proteins have been calculated by the well known
Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) method​51​. It is composed by two contributions, namely, the solvation
energies and a complementary term originated by coulomb interactions. The solvation energies which
have been calculated by capturing the spike proteins structure from the MD trajectory 40​
​ , and they
depend on the solvent-excluded surface (SES) and the partial charges of the solute. A second
contribution arises from the point charges distribution in the solute, given by the Coulomb energy,
(see the Methods section for the theoretical background). The PB scheme has several advantages,
when tackling large biggish protein assemblies of different structures and trajectories provided, as it is
the case of the coronavirus spike proteins PDBs. One of the key advantages is the computational
feasibility when tackling protein assemblies in the order of 100 thousands of atoms in just an hour ​52​.
In Table 2, we have calculated the PB-energy differences between the spike proteins with at least one
RBD up and with the closed spike configuration as a reference. Assuming physiological conditions
given by a pH of 7 and ionic-strength of 150mM, we observed that the ground energy state is the
spike conformation with 3down. In addition, the most favorable open conformation is given by the
1up2down conformation, followed by the 2up1down conformation. Interestingly the energy barrier to
reach a 2up1down conformation seems to have an energetic penalty much higher compared to as the
first transition, i.e. 3down to 1up2down. Here, we remark that PB-energies provide a static picture of
the solvation and Coulomb energies at a certain point of the MD simulations trajectory. Table 2,
shows the calculation of the ​Δ​G of energy for 3 MD snapshots corresponding to a tuned mesh
refinement (4.16 elements/ Å 2​) set of the three system ending conformations​40​.

However given the relevance of the recognition process, we are not providing a final assessment of
the ​Δ​Gs. In fact, we suggest extending this study and comparing results between different free-energy
calculation methods​53 applied to the spike protein including a reconstruction of the envelope
membrane. The inclusion of a reconstructed membrane may provide further insight into the large and
flexible conformational space of the spike proteins in a more robust and accurate manner.

CONCLUSIONS
In the current COVID-19 pandemic the development of novel diagnostics and antiviral therapies is of
high priority. We expect our structural and energetic studies can provide additional information
regarding the space of interactions mapped by certain key residues that are crucial for stabilization of
the spike protein during an apparent dynamic equilibrium mediated by transitions from close to open
conformations prior to ACE2 recognition. In particular we found several high-frequency contacts
formed between the NTD (in chain A) and RBD (in chain B) that are responsible for the local
conformational stability, and our data suggest that these high-frequency contacts play a role during the
transition from closed to open state. Our analysis shows that ​this transition occurs at the energetic cost
of breaking very high-frequency contacts between the RBD hinge and the S2 region in chain B and A
respectively. The rearrangement of those residues has an energetic cost in the range of 10-15 kcal/mol
which is consistent with the PB analysis that quantifies the change in free energy on the order of 10.4
kcal/mol for 3down to 1up2down. ​Our studies also show the large energetic cost required to transit
from closed to 2up1down conformation (~ 30 kcal/mol) in the absence of the cellular ACE2. This
results indicates the propensity of the spike protein to be found likely in the 1up2down conformation
prior to interacting with the cell surface. Further studies based on single molecule force spectroscopy
can help to differentiate spike protein conformation according to their mechanical properties (e.g
Young modulus).
In perspective, we aim to provide enough information about possible target sites to destabilize the
spike conformations of the closed and open state (i.e. 1up2down or 2up1down). One possibility is that
our work can be combined with other studies on the binding of natural compounds derived from plant
sources 54​

antidepressant, nootropic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-stress, anticonvulsant,

used to target inhibition of spike protein conformation. Recently, it has been approved to use them as
the alternative antiviral inhibitor for COVID-19 patient treatment 28,29​

considerations, in the future, we plan to investigate and determine the efficacy of the potential herbal

candidates along with FDA approved drugs (e.g. Remdesivir, Lopinavir, favipiravir and
Hydroxychloroquine) 4​ against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by destabilizing the RBD interactions with
ACE2. This can be accomplished by combining in-silico docking and molecular dynamics simulation
in order to determine the destabilizing residues and how their contacts with the RBD are broken upon
ligand binding. From this work, we will be able to propose possible computationally promising
compounds that can be further probed experimentally.
