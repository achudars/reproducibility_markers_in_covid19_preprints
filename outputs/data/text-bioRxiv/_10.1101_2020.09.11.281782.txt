Abstract:

27

regulatory cytokine, plays an important role in the cytokine storm of COVID-19. Multiple trials

28

are therefore looking at the effects of Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody that inhibits IL-6

29

activity, on treatment of COVID-19, with promising findings. As part of a clinical trial looking

30

at the effects of Tocilizumab treatment on kidney transplant recipients with subclinical

31

rejection, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of comparing stimulated PBMCs before

32

and after Tocilizumab treatment. We leveraged this data to create an in vitro cytokine storm

33

model, to better understand the effects of Tocilizumab in the presence of inflammation.

34

Tocilizumab-treated cells had reduced expression of inflammatory-mediated genes and

35

biologic pathways, particularly amongst monocytes. These results support the hypothesis that

36

Tocilizumab may hinder the cytokine storm of COVID-19, through a demonstration of biologic

37

impact at the single-cell level.

COVID-19 has posed a significant threat to global health. Early data has revealed that IL-6, a key

1. Introduction

48

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

49

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a significant threat to global health since emerging at

50

the end of 2019. Although the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges significantly, and most

51

infections are not severe1–3, the overall global burden of the disease has been significant with

52

up to nearly 20% mortality in certain geographic/demographic groups4,5. While notable

53

progress has been made in the understanding the virology and disease process, the abrupt

54

onset and lack of effective vaccination has made treatment of COVID-19 difficult6,7.

55
56

Interleukin (IL)-6 is a key regulatory cytokine for the innate and adaptive immune response and

57

is a growth factor for B cell proliferation and differentiation, an inducer of antibody production,

58

and a regulator of CD4+ T cell differentiation8,9. Early data from the COVID-19 outbreak has

59

shown that the complications from the disease are partly due to increases in various cytokines,

60

including IL-610–13, and that elevated IL-6 levels may be associated with worse outcomes13–15.

61

Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antibody, which binds to both the membrane-bound and

62

soluble forms of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), thereby inhibiting the action of the

63

cytokine/receptor complex and interfering with the cytokine's effects16. It is a well-studied

64

and accepted therapy for rheumatoid arthritis17–19, and has also been studied in giant cell

65

arteritis20 and organ transplantation9,21,22. As such, multiple global investigators are currently

66

undertaking clinical trials to further assess the efficacy of Tocilizumab in the treatment of

67

COVID-19 and its complications (ClinicalTrials.gov). Thus far, it has been shown that COVID-19

68

patient plasma inhibits the expression of HLA-DR which may be partially restored by

69

Tocilizumab treatment, and that treatment with Tocilizumab may also improve lymphopenia

70

associated with COVID-1923. Preliminary data for Tocilizumab treatment on COVID-19

71

outcomes has shown improvement in clinical outcomes24. While the clinical effects of

72

Tocilizumab in inflammatory and autoimmune disease has been well-studied, there is a

73

paucity of data on the mechanistic/biologic impact of the drug on our immune system.

74
75

Given the current state of the COVID-19 epidemic and possible efficacy of IL-6/IL-6R inhibition

76

with the use of Tocilizumab, we believed a deeper analysis of the mechanistic/biologic effects

77

of Tocilizumab could further elucidate the effects of the drug on our immune system. Herein we

78

present an analysis of the impact of Tociluzimab on immune cells using single-cell RNA

79

sequencing (scRNA-seq). We map the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)

80

subsets to cellular activation using CD3/CD28 stimulation25–29. Relevant to understanding the

81

impact of Tociluzimab in suppressing immune activation and inflammation, as seen in the

82

COVID-19 response, we additionally examine the effect of Tociluzimab on unstimulated and

83

stimulated cells, as part of an investigator-initiated clinical trial in kidney transplant (KT)

84

recipients with subclinical rejection (NIAID U01 AI113362-01). We provide a resource

85

characterizing the effect of Tociluzimab on immune cells at a single-cell level, and demonstrate

86

the unique and unexpected impact of Tociluzimab on monocytes, and how its effect on

87

suppressing inflammation may be further augmented based on the resting versus activated

88

state of PBMCs before exposing the cells to IL-6R inhibition.

94

single cells, we compared scRNA-seq data from anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated cells from control

95

(patients not treated with Tocilizumab) PBMCs, to unstimulated PBMCs after 3 to 6 months of

96

Tociluzimab treatment. After filtering cells, a total of 57,737 cells remained for analysis. These

97

cells were put through our analysis pipeline described (see Methods). After UMAP clustering,

98

there were a total of 21 distinct clusters representing major PBMC groups, inclusive of naïve

99

CD4+ T/CD8+ T, activated CD4+ T/CD8+ T, memory CD4+ T/CD8+ T, B, Natural Killer (NK, both

In order to examine the impact of Tocilizumab on the composition and expression of circulating

100

CD56+ dim and bright cells39), dendritic (DC) cells, and monocytes. Clusters were annotated

101

according to canonical cell type markers (Figure 1A). Clusters 2, 4, and 5 expressed markers of

102

memory T cell expansion (S100A4, IL7R40,41) while clusters 0, 8, and 16 expressed markers of

103

CD4+ T cell activation (TNFRS4, CD6942). One cluster of doublets (cluster 20) was removed to

104

give the final annotated clusters (Figure 1B).

106

Feature plots showing the expression of “cytokine storm”43 related pro-inflammatory genes are

107

cell-type specific, with predominance for expression in T cell and monocyte clusters (Figure 1C).

108

Although many genes are known to be involved in the cytokine storm of COVID-1937,38, we

109

demonstrate that some of the key pro-inflammatory genes (cytokines, interferons, and tumor

110

necrosis factor) are also noted as part of the inflammatory profile in control (no Tocilizumab)

111

patients (Figure 1C, control cells). Overall, stimulated PBMCs not exposed to Tociluzimab show

112

a dominant signal for T cell activation. After 6 months of treatment with Tociluzimab there is a

113

shift in peripheral blood subset frequencies observed across no treatment (control) vs.

114

treatment (Tocilizumab) groups. In comparison to changes in overall cell types, there was little

115

observed effect on frequencies of naïve CD4+/CD8+ T cells, DC, or NK cells, but with a marked

116

reduction of activated CD4+ T cells (approximately 12.5% of control PBMCs were activated

117

CD4+ T cells, while there were essentially no activated CD4+ T cells in the Tocilizumab group,

118

Figure 1D). Within these different cell subsets, Tociluzimab therapy results in significant

119

polarization of gene expression based on UMAP presentation (Figure 1E), with notable

120

polarization by treatment status observed in monocytes.

121
122

Given Tocilizumab’s function as an IL-6R blocker, we looked at the expression of IL6, IL6R, as

123

well as SOCS1 (feedback inhibitor of IL-6 signaling, expressed upon IL-6 pathway activation44),

124

and PRDM1 (activated by the JAK/STAT3 pathway via activation of the IL-6 pathway 45,46) in

125

Tocilizumab-treated cells (Figure 1F). Tocilizumab-treatment resulted in the expected reduction

126

of IL6R, SOCS1 and PRDM1 expression, in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and unexpectedly also in

127

monocytes. IL6 expression did not appear to be affected by Tocilizumab treatment.

We looked at the top 30 most differentially expressed genes (highest log2-fold changes) for

151

control vs. Tocilizumab monocytes (Figure 2D), with some notable differences as would be

expected. Control monocytes were enriched in chemokines such as CXCL9, various HLA genes

153

involved in antigen processing48 (HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5), CD40 (member of the TNF-receptor

154

superfamily49), and SOCS1 (downstream gene activated by IL-6R pathway, as previously

155

discussed44). PA revealed enrichment of many inflammation-related pathways, including

156

interferon, interleukin, T cell receptor (TCR), and PD-1 signaling in control PBMCs, suggesting

157

the relative suppression of these pathways in cells exposed to Tocilizumab.

We then looked at the top 30 most differentially expressed genes (highest log2-fold changes)

In addition to the effect of Tociluzimab on T cells, we also observed an unexpected polarization

179

of monocytes after Tocilizumab treatment (Figure 1E). Notably, the Tocilizumab monocyte

180

cluster was enriched for CD14, suggestive of an increased presence of classical monocytes47,

while CD16/FCGR3A expression was more evenly expressed between the two clusters (Figure

effect, utilizing Monocle. This revealed six distinct cell trajectory branches, with two of the

184

branches containing nearly all control cells not exposed to Tocilizumab, and the other four

185

branches containing nearly all Tocilizumab-exposed PBMCs (Figure 3B), supporting the

186

presence of unique PBMC trajectories after patient exposure to IL6-R blockade. We utilized

187

Monocle’s BEAM function to perform branched expression analysis modeling of the distinct cell

188

trajectory branches for Tociluzimab-exposed PBMCs (circled branch, Figure 3B), which showed

189

distinct clusters of cells based on treatment status (Figure 3C).

206

The results of this study showed that in PBMCs undergoing a cytokine storm signal in

207

rejection50, with overlapping signatures of IFNG, CCL3, and TNF expression, along with TCR

208

signaling also seen in the cytokine storm of COVID-1937,38, there is suppression of these

209

inflammatory pathways after Tocilizumab treatment. This is inclusive of suppression of

210

downstream signaling of IL6-R pathway genes in both monocytes and T cells.

211
212

Monocytes have been shown to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of COVID-1951.

213

A significant expansion of populations of monocytes producing IL-6 has been observed in the

214

peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 in ICUs compared with those patients who did not

215

require ICU hospitalization52, with similar findings of increased IL-6 production from monocytes

216

also seen by scRNA-seq analysis of PBMCs53. Our findings are from the first clinical trial utilizing

217

Tocilizumab for transplant rejection recipients and the first scRNA-seq analysis for such a study.

218

We show a separation of cell clustering based on treatment status, reduced enrichment of

219

inflammatory pathways in Tocilizumab patients, and relatively reduced expression of IL-6R

220

pathway genes in Tocilizumab-treated cells. As would be expected, we did not observe any

221

differences in IL-6 gene expression between control and Tocilizumab cells (as Tocilizumab is an

222

IL-6R blocker), but rather only effects on the subsequent function of that cytokine’s pathways.

223

We also show an enrichment of CD14 expression (associated with classical monocytes) in

224

Tocilizumab-treated monocytes, which are believed to be phagocytic, but with reduced

225

inflammatory attributes47. This is consistent with our PA described above that shows

226

enrichment of inflammatory pathways in control cells, but not Tocilizumab-treated cells

227

(possibly due to the increased presence of non-inflammatory classical monocytes in

228

Tocilizumab-treated cells).

229

Our findings, in conjunction with the available data on clinical outcomes of Tocilizumab

230

treatment24 and ongoing trials, show promise for the use of Tocilizumab in the treatment of

231

patients with COVID-19. The results of our study support the belief that Tocilizumab may be

232

effective in reducing the inflammatory burden that results in the adverse outcomes of COVID-

233

19. Future studies will need to be undertaken to look at outcomes of Tocilizumab treatment for

234

COVID-19 in a clinical trial setting, ideally in conjunction with scRNA-seq analysis of these

235

patient’s blood samples to achieve a greater understanding of the transcriptomic effects of

236

infection and treatment at a single-cell level.

Sample collection

241

This study was performed as part of an ancillary to a randomized controlled clinical trial of 15

242

KT recipients that were diagnosed with subclinical rejection on their 6-month post-transplant

243

protocol biopsy and randomized to either continue standard of care (Tacrolimus,

244

mycophenolate, and steroid) immunosuppression (control arm, 8 patients) or standard of care

245

plus Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab treatment arm, 7 patients). Patients in the treatment arm were

246

given Tocilizumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks, for a total of 6 doses. Patients in both

247

arms of the study had blood collected at baseline prior to the initiation of Tocilizumab (in the

248

treatment arm patients), then at 3, 6, and 12 months after the start of the study, for a total of 4

249

blood samples per all 15 patients in the study. PBMCs were isolated from blood samples by

250

Ficoll-PaqueTM PLUS density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) and frozen in

251

fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Waltham, MA) containing 10% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-

253

they were used directly for in vitro stimulation.

254
255

Stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies

256

Frozen PBMCs were thawed, four vials at a time to ensure maximum cell recovery, in a water

257

bath at 37 Celsius. Cells were counted using a hematocytometer, split in half, and were then

258

adjusted to 2x105 cells/well and triplicate plated in multiscreen 96-well plates (Falcon, Corning,

259

NY). Cells were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 (5 μg/mL; MabTech, Cincinnati, OH) and anti-

260

CD28 antibodies (10ug/mL; MabTech, Cincinnati, OH) at 37 Celsius, 5% CO2 for 24 hours.

261

Unstimulated PBMCs were incubated under identical conditions to reduce any confounding

262

from incubation conditions other than stimulation. Since all PBMCs were split in half prior to

263

any downstream processing, all samples from control and Tocilizumab-treated patients at all

264

study time points were both stimulated and not stimulated as part of the study design.

265
266

Sample processing

267

After overnight stimulation/incubation, the cells were harvested and counted using a

268

hematocytometer and orange acridine solution. Any cell suspension that was less than 25

269

cells/uL was disqualified from multiplexing due to low cell counts. Multiplexing cell pools were

270

designed such that no pair of stimulated and unstimulated samples from the same patient were

271

in the same pool and such that no samples from the same collection time point were in the

272

same pool. The same number of cells from each patient and experimental condition were

273

multiplexed into their respective pools to make a final total of 300,000 cells per pool. Any

274

remaining non-pooled cells were resuspended in RNAlater (Thermo-Fisher, West Sacramento,

275

CA) and saved for SNP array. Cell pools were then centrifuged at 400g for 5 minutes and media

276

was aspirated. Cell pellet was resuspended in a small volume of Wash Buffer (0.4% BSA in

277

1XPBS) and the suspension was filtered through a 40uM cell strainer (Falcon, Corning, NY).

Library construction and sequencing

280

scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the 10X Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits

281

v3, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the isolated cells were washed once

282

with PBS + 0.04% BSA and resuspended in PBS + 0.04% BSA to a final cell concentration

283

of 1000 cells/µL as determined by hematocytometer. Cells were captured in droplets at a

284

targeted cell recovery of 4000-8000 cells, resulting in estimated multiplet rates of 0.4-5.4%.

Following reverse transcription and cell barcoding in droplets, emulsions were broken and

min; 72°C for 1 min). Amplified cDNA was then used for 3’ gene expression library construction.

289

For gene expression library construction, 2.4-50 ng of amplified cDNA was fragmented and end-

290

repaired, double-sided size selected with SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, West

291

Sacramento, CA), PCR amplified with sample indexing primers (98°C for 45 sec; 14-16 cycles of

292

98°C for 20 sec, 54°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 20 sec; 72°C for 1 min), and double-sided size selected

293

with SPRIselect beads. Pooled cells were loaded in a 10X chip in three replicate wells such that

294

each well contained 50,000 cells. Given the large number of cells and large number of patient

295

samples, the entire experiment and sequencing was performed in 2 separate batches to

296

prevent cell death during counting. Each day resulted in 4 unique pools with each pool run in

297

triplicate wells for sequencing. Sequencing single-cell RNA libraries were sequenced on an

298

Illumina NovaSeq S2 to a minimum sequencing depth of 50,000 reads/cell using the read

299

lengths 26bp Read1, 8bp i7 Index, 91bp Read2.

301

Demultiplexing

302

To assign cells to donors of origin in our multiplexed design, we leveraged the genetic

303

demultiplexing tools demuxlet30 and freemuxlet, both a part of the popscle suite of population

304

genetics tools (https://github.com/statgen/popscle). These tools leverage the genetic

305

polymorphisms present in transcripts to assign the cells found in each droplet to their donor of

306

origin. Demuxlet uses the genotype calls from a genotyping SNP array to classify cells in

307

droplets according to their donor of origin, while freemuxlet “learns” the genotypes of a pre-

308

defined number of donors from the transcripts themselves, and assigns the droplets to a

309

respective anonymous donor according to those learned genotypes. Upon first receiving

310

sequencing data, demuxlet was run with input genotypes from all the patients in the cohort.

311

While demuxlet was able to assign most droplets to donors of origin, it revealed that two

312

patients in the genotyping SNP array appeared to have identical genotypes (likely due to human

313

error) and that cells from some patients seemed to drop out (likely due to low viability cells or

314

inaccurate cell counting or mixing). Therefore, to validate demuxlet results, freemuxlet was run

315

using an independent list of SNP sites: exonic SNPs with a minor allele frequency > 0.05 as

316

observed in the 1000 Genomes Project. In order to leverage the droplets across multiple

317

microfluidic reactions, which may enable higher confidence in the learned genotypes, we

16

318

merged the BAMs from multiple experiments containing the same patients into a single BAM

319

and input this merged BAM into freemuxlet. The droplet assignments from the anonymous

320

donors output by freemuxlet were then compared to those from demuxlet, showing very high

321

concordance. Moreover, comparing the VCF generated from freemuxlet (using the SNPs present

322

in the droplets) to the VCF generated from the SNP genotyping array yielded a 1:1

323

correspondence of anonymous individuals to patients, barring those few problematic patients.

324

Through comparing VCFs and the presence/absence of individuals in each multiplexed

325

experiment, we were able to definitively assign a detected genotype to all detected individuals.

326

Droplet barcodes were then filtered to remove heterotypic droplets containing cells from

327

multiple individuals, and the remaining homotypic droplets were analyzed downstream.

328
329

Data analysis

330

Raw FASTQ files were processed using CellRanger (v 3.0.1) to map reads against human genome

331

38 as a reference, filter out unexpressed genes, and count barcodes and unique molecular

332

identifiers (UMIs). Subsequent analyses were conducted with Seurat (v 3.1.2)31 in R (v 3.6.2).

333

We compared PBMCs from all anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated cells from the study baseline, to

334

unstimulated Tocilizumab-treated cells from 3 to 6 months post-treatment with Tocilizumab.

335

Utilizing Seurat, we first filtered cells to only keep those that had less than 10% mitochondrial

336

genes and cells with numbers of features greater than 200 and less than 2,500. Cells were

337

assigned patient identification based on the demuxlet/freemuxlet output described above, and

338

once patients were identified, additional treatment/stimulation/time metadata could be

339

applied. Given that our experiment was divided over 2 days given the high number of

17

340

samples/cells, we applied Seurat’s SCTransform function for data integration to account for any

341

possible batch effects from experiment days32,33. Once the data was integrated, we continued

342

downstream data processing. We first determined the principal components (PCA), then

343

constructed a shared nearest neighbor graph (SNN), identified clusters with a resolution of

344

0.75, and finally visualized the cells using uniform manifold approximate and projection

345

(UMAP), per the typical Seurat workflow31. Clustering was achieved by using 15 components

346

from the PCA dimensionality reduction.

347
348

To identify cluster-specific markers following the creation of UMAP plots, we utilized

349

normalized RNA counts of all clusters, scaled the data, and performed differential gene

350

expression (DE) testing by applying the Wilcoxon rank sum test using Seurat’s FindMarkers

351

function31. We also plotted normalized and scaled gene expression of canonical markers in

352

conjunction with DE testing to determine identities of each cluster. To compare cell clusters of

353

stimulated vs. unstimulated cells, or control vs. Tocilizumab-treated cells, we once again utilized

354

normalized/scaled RNA counts and performed DE testing with FindMarkers.

355
356

To perform pathway analysis (PA) for any specific comparison we performed, we filtered for all

357

differentially expressed genes with an adjusted (based on the Bonferroni correction) p-value <

358

0.05, and then selected the top 10 percentile of genes with the highest log-fold changes. These

359

top genes were used to perform the PA utilizing the Reactome database34 with the

360

clusterProfiler package35. To perform cell trajectory analysis, we first subset our clusters and cell

361

types of interest from our Seurat workflow, then performed dimensionality reduction and cell

362

ordering with Monocle36 (v 2.14.0). We were then able to plot specific cells by their trajectory

363

branches based on their pseudotime values assigned by Monocle. DE of individual cell trajectory

364

branches was then performed with Monocle’s BEAM (branched expression analysis modeling)

365

function, followed by visualization of these differentially expressed branches with Monocle’s

366

heatmap visualization tool.
