ABSTRACT The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more
fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle. The causative agent of the disease,
SARS-CoV-2, is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight
into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival. Contained within the untranslated
regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are
believed to function in RNA replication, viral protein translation, and discontinuous
transcription. While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence, a 41-nucleotide s2m
element within the 3’ UTR is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral
families. In this study, we demonstrate that the s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 dimerizes by
forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted
to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation. This process is aided by the viral
nucleocapsid protein, potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host
cellular miRNA-1307-3p. Taken together, our results highlight the potential significance of the
dimer structures formed by the s2m element in key biological processes and implicate the motif
as a possible therapeutic drug target for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.

INTRODUCTION
In late December 2019, a novel respiratory infection emerged in Wuhan, China and was
consequently termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health
Organization. The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic approximately 3 months later
and has, to date, spread to over 200 countries with more than 71 million confirmed cases and
over 1.6 million deaths (1). Symptoms of COVID-19 include those commonly seen in other
respiratory diseases, such as fever, cough, and fatigue, though various neurological symptoms,
including headache and dizziness, have also been reported (2). Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, is proposed to
have originated by homologous recombination events between bat and pangolin coronaviruses,
which most likely enabled its transmission to humans (3, 4). Though high rates of homologous
recombination have been reported for coronaviruses, the mechanism by which this process
occurs remains elusive (5).
SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family, and
Betacoronavirus genus, lineage B (6). Similar viruses, such as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, resulted in high fatality rates

among infected individuals during the SARS and MERS outbreaks in 2002 and 2012,
respectively (7). Members of the Coronaviridae family are enveloped, single-stranded RNA
viruses with positive polarity and large genomes of approximately 30 kilobases (8, 9). These
viruses contain similar genomic RNA (gRNA) composition, including two open reading frames
(ORF1a and ORF1b), which encode for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and
nonstructural proteins (10). Interestingly, members of the Coronaviridae family of viruses
harbor the unique ability to produce “nested” subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA), which serve as the
templates for translation of the virion’s structural spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and
nucleocapsid (N) proteins (10, 11). The latter of these proteins, N, forms ribonucleoprotein
particles with the gRNA, termed the nucleocapsid complex, which is enveloped by a membrane
consisting of S, E, and M proteins during the virion maturation process.
The genomes of Coronaviridae viruses contain multiple structurally conserved elements within
the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) that have been suggested to play roles in viral gRNA
and sgRNA replication. These elements include three stem-loops (SL1, SL2, and SL3) within
the 5’ UTR, as well as a bulged stem-loop (BSL), pseudoknot (PK) stem-loop, and
hypervariable region (HVR) within the 3’ UTR. Recent structural studies utilizing NMR
spectroscopy, SHAPE mutational profiling, and various other characterization metrologies
have confirmed the conservation of these elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (12–14).
Moreover, a recent investigation of the short- and long-range interactions within the SARSCoV-2 genome suggests these elements additionally function in genome cyclization and
interactions with the frame-shifting elements of the gRNA ORF regions, indicating potential
mechanistic roles in discontinuous transcription and viral protein translation events as well
(15).
While the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 3’-UTR is variable in sequence, it contains a highly
conserved 41-nucleotide (nt) stem-loop II motif (s2m) within the terminal portion of the HVR
(Figure 1) (16). This element has previously been shown to be conserved not only among
Coronaviridae viruses, but also within the distantly related Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, and
Picornaviridae families of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (16, 17). The exact
function of the s2m element has yet to be elucidated, but given its presence in several families
of viruses, it has been suggested to confer a selective advantage. Proposed hypotheses for the
role of the s2m element include hijacking of host protein synthesis, involvement within RNA
interference pathways, and RNA recombination events (16, 18, 19). Nonetheless, the broad
conservation of the s2m element in multiple families of viruses highlights the potential
significance of the motif in virus detection and therapeutic drug targeting (20).
In this study, we identified a 4-nt palindrome (GUAC) within the terminal loop of the SARSCoV-2 s2m element, which we show is involved in homodimeric RNA-RNA kissing complex
formation. Furthermore, we show that this kissing dimer is able to undergo subsequent
conversion into a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation, facilitated by the chaperone
activity of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, a process that may stabilize a dimerized form of the
gRNA. This mechanism has been described previously in both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), suggesting potential roles of the s2m element in
viral replication and homologous recombination events (21–24). Moreover, recent studies, as
well as our own bioinformatic analysis, have identified multiple binding sites within the SARSCoV-2 s2m element for the host miRNA-1307-3p, which has the potential to regulate the
production of various interleukins and interleukin receptors that have been linked to the
“cytokine storm” reported in severe COVID-19 patients (25). Given these potential host-virus
RNA interactions, we further proposed that the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element is able to hijack

miRNA-1307-3p for its own advantage. Our results advance the breadth of knowledge
surrounding the highly conserved s2m element, as well as highlight its potential significance
as a therapeutic target for both COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.

Nondenaturing Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
Oligonucleotides were diluted in ½x Tris-Boric Acid (TB) buffer and annealed at 95 °C,
followed by snap-cooling using dry ice and ethanol. To test the effect of magnesium on kissing
complex formation, 500 nM or 1 µM RNA samples were incubated for either 60 minutes or 24
hours at 22 °C with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 in the range of 1-10 mM. Conversion
of the s2m kissing complex to an extended duplex by the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (RayBiotech)
was monitored by incubating 1 µM RNA samples with 1 mM MgCl2 and 2 µM of the protein
for 45 minutes, followed by the addition of proteinase K for 15 minutes to digest the N protein.
To monitor complex formation of the s2m RNA with miRNA-1307-3p, 500 nM or 1 µM RNA
was incubated with 1 mM MgCl2 for 30 minutes, followed by addition of increasing
concentrations of miRNA for an additional 30 minutes. Following incubation, samples were
split and electrophoresed in Tris-Boric Acid-EDTA (TBE) or Tris-Boric Acid-Magnesium
(TBM) gels for 2-hours and 4-hours, respectively. TBM gels contained 5 mM MgCl2 in both
the gel and the ½x TB running buffer. Gels were subsequently stained with the cyanine dye
SYBR® Gold and visualized by UV transillumination using an AlphaImager equipped with a
537 nm emission filter. Experiments were performed at least in duplicate.

NMR Spectroscopy
One-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed at 19 °C on a 500 MHz Bruker
AVANCE NMR spectrometer equipped with TopSpin3.2 acquisition software. RNA samples
at a concentration of 250 µM were prepared in 10 mM cacodylic acid, pH 6.5, in a 90:10
H2O:D2O ratio. Samples were annealed at 95 °C and snap-cooled using dry ice and ethanol
prior to data acquisition. Water suppression was carried out using the Watergate pulse sequence
(26).
A 1H -15N SOFAST-HMQC at 15N natural isotopic abundance was collected on a 900 MHz
NMR AVANCE III spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) equipped with triple resonance
cryogenically-cooled probe with a z-axis gradient system. The experiment was recorded with
the 1H and 15N carriers placed at 4.694 ppm and 150 ppm, respectively, with a sweep width of
22.04 ppm and 30 ppm, respectively. The recycle delay was set to 0.4 s, 25,600 scans per
transient with acquisition times of 50 ms and 8.8 ms in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively.
Selective excitation and refocusing of the amide resonances was achieved using a 90° PC-9
and 180° Reburp shaped pulses, respectively, applied at 11.5 ppm with a bandwidth of 6.0 ppm.
The experiment, processed in NMRPipe, was apodized with a shifted sine-squared bell, zerofilled to quadruple the points in 1H and NUS-zero filled to twice the points in 15N using iterative
soft thresholding (27). The spectrum was visualized with NMRFAM-Sparky 3.19 (28).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The s2m region in the 3’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 forms a homodimeric kissing complex
From the proposed SARS-CoV-2 s2m stem-loop structure, a 4-nt palindrome GUAC was
observed within the loop, suggesting a possible site for the formation of a homodimeric kissing
complex that could be implicated in genome dimerization (Figure 2) (12). To investigate this
proposed interaction, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis studies were carried out both in the
presence and absence of Mg2+ ions (Figure 3). Samples of the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element at
concentrations of 500 nM and 1 µM were prepared in the presence of 1, 5, and 10 mM MgCl2,
conditions which stabilize the kissing dimer conformation, and subsequently split to be run in
parallel in TBE and TBM gels (29, 30). As the TBM gels contain 5 mM MgCl2, kissing dimer
conformations are retained, whereas these ions are chelated by EDTA in the TBE gels, resulting
in kissing dimer dissociation (24, 29, 30). In the TBM gel, we observed three distinct bands at
all concentrations of Mg2+ ions investigated (Figure 3A, right), with the lower band (arrow 1)
attributed to the monomeric species and the higher bands (arrows 2 and 3) to two distinct
dimeric species. In contrast, upon chelation of Mg2+ ions by the EDTA in TBE buffer, the two
dimeric bands collapse into a single band, indicating that the motif exists primarily in its
monomeric state (Figure 3A, left panel, arrow 1). As has been noted previously, the s2m
element monomer bands are observed to migrate differently on the TBE and TBM gels due to
the effect of the Mg2+ ions on the monomeric structure.
We hypothesized that one of the dimer bands observed in the TBM gel corresponded to a
homodimeric kissing complex, while the other arose from the spontaneous conversion of the
kissing complex to a stable, extended duplex (Figure 2, bottom) which occurred during the
incubation with MgCl2 and subsequent 4-hour run through the TBM gel. Spontaneous
conversion of labile palindromic kissing dimers to their extended duplex conformation has
been reported for the dimerization initiation site of other viruses, such as HCV and HIV-1 (21–
24). The process, which involves strand exchange between the two monomers, is dependent on
the intrinsic stability of the monomeric stem-loop structures (31, 32). The conversion of the

s2m kissing dimer to duplex following the 1-hour incubation with Mg2+ ions was likely
hindered by chelation of the ions by EDTA in the TBE gel, resulting in a band too faint to be
detected. To test this hypothesis, 1 µM SARS-CoV-2 s2m samples were incubated in the
presence of increasing concentrations of MgCl2 at room temperature for 24-hours and
subsequently examined by TBE and TBM gel electrophoresis. Both dimer bands are present in
the TBM gel (Figure 3B, right panel, arrows 2 and 3) with the uppermost dimer band (arrow 3)
increasing in intensity at higher MgCl2 concentrations. Similarly, a dimer band which increases
in intensity as the MgCl2 concentration increases is now clearly visible in the TBE gel (Figure
3B, left panel, arrow 3), indicating that the band corresponds to an extended duplex, which is
stable even following chelation of Mg2+ ions by EDTA. Notably, both dimer bands are more
intense in the TBM gel (compare Figures 3A and 3B, right panels), with the intensity of the
uppermost dimer band increasing as concentration of MgCl2 in the sample is increased,
indicating stabilization of the kissing complex intermediate followed by conversion to the
duplex conformation during the 24-hour incubation time (Figure 3B). Our results support the
hypothesis that the s2m element in the 3’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2 forms a homodimeric kissing
complex stabilized by Mg2+ ions and that this structure can serve as an intermediate in the
spontaneous rearrangement into a stable, extended duplex structure.
Bioinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed the s2m element differs in
sequence from that in SARS-CoV by only 2 nucleotides (U5C and G31U, Table 1). To
determine whether these minor variations in the motif have an effect on its ability to dimerize,
we incubated both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements in the presence of 1, 5, and 10
mM MgCl2 for 1-hour, followed by electrophoresing in TBE and TBM nondenaturing gels
(Figure 4). In the absence of Mg2+ ions, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements exist
primarily in their monomeric state (Figure 4, left panel). Surprisingly, in the presence of Mg2+
ions in the TBM gel, the equilibrium is shifted more significantly towards the dimeric state for
SARS-CoV s2m as compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 s2m (Figure 4, right panel, arrow 2).
Additionally, while two dimer bands of lower intensity are present for the SARS-CoV-2 s2m
(Figure 4, right panel, arrows 2 and 3), only a single dimeric conformation is evident for SARSCoV (Figure 4, right panel, arrow 2). Incubation of the SARS-CoV s2m with 1, 5, and 10 mM
MgCl2 for 24-hours at room temperature revealed no upper dimer band present in the TBE gel
(Supplemental Figure S1, left panel), confirming the inability of the element to convert from
the kissing dimer to the stable duplex structure. Thus, our results suggest that SARS-CoV s2m
exists primarily in a kinetically trapped kissing dimer structure that does not spontaneously
convert to a stable duplex. To minimize the spontaneous conversion of the SARS-CoV-2 s2m
kissing dimer to duplex conformation, RNA samples were incubated in the presence of 1 mM
MgCl2 for 1-hour in all subsequent experiments.
The difference in dimerization properties of the s2m elements is significant, considering that
the SARS-CoV-2 s2m sequence differs from that of SARS-CoV only at two positions, U5C
and G31U (Table 1). The nucleotide at position 5 in the s2m element is variable; however, that
at position 31 remains invariant in all viruses in which the element has been identified (16, 17,
33). According to the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV s2m, U5 is located in the lower
stem and base-paired to G37, whereas G31 is located in the middle stem, base-paired with C12
(Figure 5A) (18). The secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element was recently
solved by NMR spectroscopy and is conformationally different from that of SARS-CoV s2m
(12). These conformational variations were additionally confirmed by our 1.5 µs molecular
dynamic simulations (manuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal, Special Issue:
Biophysicists Address COVID-19 Challenges). However, it should be noted that while C5
remains base-paired to G37 and retains its position in the lower stem, U31 in SARS-CoV-2
s2m is part of a smaller middle stem, forming a base pair with A13 (Figure 5B). The terminal

loop region in SARS-CoV s2m is bent into a 90° kink facilitated by a base quartet interaction,
leaving G20 and U21 exposed and possibly orienting them in the right conformation for kissing
dimer formation (18). In contrast, the terminal loop of SARS-CoV-2 is larger, with the entire
GUAC palindrome left exposed. Selective 2’ hydroxyl acylation by primer extension (SHAPE)
analysis of the s2m element in SARS-CoV-2 confirms the lability of all four nucleotides (13,
14). Thus, we postulate that the higher flexibility of the entire GUAC loop results in a greater
entropic penalty upon SARS-CoV-2 s2m kissing dimer formation. These observations
potentially explain why SARS-CoV s2m more easily forms a stable kissing complex structure
as compared with SARS-CoV-2, which prefers its monomeric conformation even in the
presence of MgCl2 (Figure 4, right panel).
To determine whether the structural differences and altered dimerization properties of SARSCoV-2 s2m are due to both nucleotide variations, we investigated two mutated SARS-CoV
sequences in which a single nucleotide mutation was introduced at a time (U5C and G31U,
respectively, Table 1 and Figure 5). We employed one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy to
analyze the secondary structures of these mutants to determine if they resemble the SARS-CoV
s2m or SARS-CoV-2 s2m secondary structure. The SARS-CoV-2 s2m imino proton resonance
region (Figure 6A, top spectrum) matched that of its previously determined secondary structure,
allowing us to assign its resonances (12). It should be noted, however, that our analysis focused
on a synthesized 41-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element,
whereas the previous characterization included two additional G-C base pairs introduced in the
lower stem for transcriptional purposes. In the SARS-CoV (G31U) s2m spectrum, the imino
proton resonances corresponding to U31, G30, G32, and G28 have similar chemical shifts as
compared with the corresponding ones in SARS-CoV-2 s2m (Figure 6A). However, those
resonances corresponding to base pairs in the lower stem appear to be broader, potentially due
to the fact that in wild-type SARS CoV, the G-C base pair formed by C5-G37 is replaced by
the less stable U5-G37 (compare Figure 5). As expected, the U31 imino proton resonance is
absent from both wild-type SARS-CoV s2m and SARS-CoV (U5C) s2m mutant, and while we
cannot make unambiguous assignments for these imino proton resonances, we noted that the
overall spectra corresponding to wild-type SARS-CoV s2m and its U5C mutant appear to be
similar (Figure 6A, bottom two spectra). We noted that the imino proton resonances for both
SARS-CoV s2m and its U5C mutant are broader than those for SARS-CoV-2 s2m and SARSCoV (G31U), which could be due to the formation of kissing dimer structures even in the
absence of Mg2+ ions at the high RNA concentrations used in NMR spectroscopy experiments.
Based on these 1H NMR spectroscopy results, we predicted that the dimerization of the SARSCoV (G31U) s2m mutant will be similar to that of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 s2m, whereas that
of the SARS-CoV (U5C) s2m mutant will resemble that of wild-type SARS-CoV s2m. Thus,
we performed nondenaturing PAGE for these mutants in the presence of 1 and 10 mM MgCl2.
In the TBM gel (Figure 6B, right panel), the SARS-CoV (U5C) s2m mutant, like the wild-type
SARS-CoV s2m, shows a single dimer band (arrow 2). In contrast, the SARS-CoV (G31U)
s2m mutant, like SARS-CoV-2 s2m, shows two distinct, albeit more intense, dimer bands
which correspond to kissing dimer (arrow 2) and extended duplex (arrow 3). Additional higher
molecular weight bands above the 100-bp marker are also evident for the SARS-CoV (G31U)
s2m at 10 mM MgCl2, indicating the formation of higher-order complexes for this mutant
(Figure 6B, right panel, arrows 4 and 5).
Upon chelation of Mg2+ ions in the TBE gel, all four s2m elements exist primarily in their
monomeric conformation (Figure 6B, left panel). However, a distinct dimer band is also
apparent for the SARS-CoV (G31U) s2m mutant at both 1 and 10 mM MgCl2 (Figure 6B, left
panel, arrow 2), indicating that this mutant kissing dimer converts more readily to the stable,

extended duplex conformation, as compared to SARS-CoV-2 s2m. This is likely due to a less
stable lower stem, which is capped by the U5-G37 base pair in SARS-CoV (G31U) s2m, as
compared with the C5-G37 base pair in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 s2m. These results, which
also corroborate the 1H NMR data, indicate similar dimerization properties between wild-type
SARS-CoV s2m and SARS-CoV (U5C) s2m mutant (Figure 6A, bottom two spectra), as both
exist primarily in a kissing dimer conformation in the presence of Mg2+ ions (Figure 6B, right
panel, lanes 1-4).
Taken together, these results indicate that the different nucleotide at position 31, a previously
100% conserved G in the s2m element of SARS-CoV which is mutated to U in the SARSCoV-2 s2m, is the single driving force in the drastic difference in dimerization properties of
this motif. To gain additional higher resolution information about the U31 nucleotide in SARSCoV-2 s2m, we performed 1H-15N SOFAST-HMQC NMR spectroscopy experiments on a 900
MHz spectrometer. Although the U31 imino proton gives rise to a single, sharp resonance in
the one-dimensional 1H spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 s2m acquired at 500 MHz (Figure 6A, top
spectrum), three distinct cross peaks are apparent in the two-dimensional 1H,15N SOFASTHMQC spectrum acquired at 900 MHz (Supplemental Figure S2A), indicating that this position
is conformationally dynamic. This could lead to the destabilization of the middle stem region
of the s2m element in SARS-CoV-2, allowing it to more readily convert to the extended duplex
conformation (Figure 6B) as compared to SARS-CoV s2m.

The viral N protein converts the SARS-CoV-2 s2m kissing dimer to a stable, extended
duplex
During the viral life cycle of coronaviruses, the N protein is primarily responsible for packaging
the viral RNA(+) genome into compact ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes during virion
assembly (34, 35). Previous work on HIV-1 and HCV has elucidated additional roles for the
nucleocapsid protein, demonstrating that it acts as a molecular chaperone, converting kissing
complex formations into stable, extended duplexes (23, 24, 36–38). Given our finding that the
s2m element of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 form homodimeric kissing complexes, we
proposed a similar chaperoning ability by the N protein. To test this hypothesis, nondenaturing
TBE and TBM gel electrophoresis was employed to monitor the formation of a
thermodynamically stable duplex, as previously described (23, 24).
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements were incubated in the presence of 1 mM
MgCl2 to pre-form kissing complex structures, followed by addition of the SARS-CoV-2 N
protein in a 1:2 ratio and incubation for an additional 30-minutes. To monitor chaperone
activity, proteinase K was subsequently added to the samples to degrade the N protein prior to
electrophoresing. Upon chelation of Mg2+ ions in the TBE gel, a distinct dimer band was
present in SARS-CoV-2 s2m, indicating the formation of a stable duplex (Figure 7, left panel,
arrow 3). Surprisingly, no distinct dimer band was present in the SARS-CoV s2m sample
incubated with the N protein. In order to ensure the observed effect was not due to non-specific
interactions, both RNAs were incubated with 2 µM bovine serum albumin (BSA) under similar
conditions, and in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m samples, the BSA protein had no
effect on duplex formation (Figure 7, left panel). The increased intensity of the top dimer band
of SARS-CoV-2 s2m after the action of the N protein (Figure 7, right panel, arrow 3) and
concomitant decrease in the monomer band (Figure 7, right panel, arrow 1) in the TBM gel
confirm our previously established hypothesis that an equilibrium exists between the monomer
and two dimer conformations, with the N protein shifting the equilibrium towards the stable

duplex structure. Additional time-dependent studies monitoring the chaperone activity of the
N protein revealed no change in duplex band intensity after incubation for 1.5-hours for SARSCoV-2 and no apparent duplex band for SARS-CoV s2m (Supplemental Figure S3, arrow 3).
To determine if the N protein has an effect on the SARS-CoV s2m conversion from the kissing
dimer to duplex conformation at physiological temperatures, we performed studies at 37 °C.
Similar to the results seen in Figure 7, no distinct dimer band was present for SARS-CoV s2m
following incubation with the N protein (Supplemental Figure S4, left panel, arrow 3), but the
higher temperature accelerated the spontaneous conversion from kissing complex to duplex
conformations for SARS-CoV-2 s2m, as bands corresponding to extended duplex are clearly
apparent even in the absence of the N protein (Supplemental Figure S4, left panel, arrow 3).
The finding that the SARS-CoV s2m kissing dimer is not converted to a stable duplex
conformation is surprising considering that the two sequences differ only by two nucleotides
(Table 1 and Figure 5). In these experiments, we used the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, whose
RNA-binding domain has a high sequence and structural homology with that of the SARSCoV N protein (Supplemental Figure S5). Nonetheless, we performed nondenaturing PAGE in
the absence of proteinase K to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 N protein can bind to both the
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements, and as seen in Figure 8 (arrows 2-4), the protein
binds both RNA sequences. We further demonstrated in control experiments that the N protein
binds specifically to these particular RNA stem-loop structures, as it did not bind to the SARSCoV-2 5’ UTR SL2 and SL3 stem-loops and bound weakly to the SARS-CoV-2 3’ UTR
pseudoknot (PK) stem-loop (Supplemental Figure S6). Thus, we propose that the lack of
conversion from the kissing dimer to a duplex conformation in SARS-CoV s2m is due to the
fact that its structure lacks the large internal bulge (compare Figures 5A and 5B), which makes
it too stable for N protein unfolding. Previous studies of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein
chaperone activity suggested that the presence of bulges in the lower stem of the dimer
initiation site monomeric stem-loop is essential for the conversion of the kissing dimer to
duplex conformation (39, 40).

The s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with cellular miRNA-1307-3p
In recent years, it has become increasing evident that coronaviruses utilize various host cell
components for their own replicative benefit (6, 41, 42). Previous studies have shown that RNA
viruses may also harbour the ability to hijack the functions of host cellular miRNAs to their
advantage. The HCV virus, for example, sequesters miRNA-122 in order to stabilize its RNA
and facilitate replication (43, 44). Similarly, hijacking of miRNA-142-3p by the North
American eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) results in repression of innate immune
responses and subsequently, increased severity of disease (45). In most circumstances, the
location of naturally-occurring miRNA-binding sites occurs within the 3’ UTR of viral RNA
genomes (46).
The bioinformatics analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome by us and others has revealed various
potential miRNA-binding sites within both the 5’ and 3’ UTRs, including two potential binding
sites for miRNA-1307-3p within the s2m element (47–49). Under normal cellular conditions,
miRNA-1307-3p is predicted to regulate the translation of various interleukins (IL18, CCLS),
interleukin receptors (IL6R, IL10RA, IL10RB, IL2RB, IL17RA, IL12RB2), and interferon
alpha receptor (IFNAR). Upregulation of these factors have been linked to the onset of the
“cytokine storm” found in severe COVID-19 patients and thought to be involved in the
development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (25, 50, 51). ARDS is caused by

immuno-inflammatory injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane, which forms the blood-air
barrier in the lungs. Alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells are the primary targets of SARSCoV-2 as they express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on their surface,
which are bound by the S protein (52). Interestingly, ATII cells have been shown to have
immunomodulatory response properties. They are known to secrete IL6, IL10, and IL18, as
well as various cytokine receptors (53–55). Given the potential relevance of miRNA-1307-3p
regulating these various elements of the “cytokine storm” within ATII cells, as well as the
potential for multiple binding sites within the s2m element, we sought to investigate their
interactions, and moreover, to determine if the dimerization of the s2m element affects these
interactions.
Binding studies were completed for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using nondenaturing TBE
and TBM gel electrophoresis (Figure 9). Samples were incubated in the presence of 1 mM
MgCl2 and increasing ratios of s2m RNA:miRNA-1307-3p for 1-hour at room temperature,
after which they were separated and electrophoresed in TBE (Figure 9A) and TBM (Figure 9B)
nondenaturing gels. Two upper bands (Figure 9A, left panel, arrows 4 and 5) that increase in
intensity with the concomitant decrease intensity of the monomer s2m band (Figure 9A, left
panel, arrow 2) are present at all miRNA-1307-3p concentrations investigated in the SARSCoV-2 TBE gel. We assign these bands to the complex of the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element with
one (arrow 4) and two (arrow 5) miRNA-1307-3p molecules, respectively. The free miRNA1307-3p migrates as a mixture of monomer (22-nt) and dimer (44-nt) (Figure 9A, both panels,
arrows 1 and 3). Nonetheless, the bands corresponding to the monomeric SARS-CoV-2 s2m
(41-nt) (arrow 2) and the dimeric miRNA-1307-3p (44-nt) (arow 3) are clearly distinguishable,
as with increasing concentrations of miRNA-1307-3p, the monomeric SARS-CoV-2 s2m band
decreases in intensity upon their complex formation (Figure 9A, left panel). Similarly, SARSCoV s2m also forms a complex with two miRNA-1307-3p molecules, as a clear upper band is
present in its TBE gel performed in the presence of increasing miRNA concentrations (Figure
9A, right panel, arrow 5). The band corresponding to the complex formed by SARS-CoV s2m
and a single miRNA-1307-3p molecule (Figure 9A, right panel, arrow 4) is not clearly visible
in this gel, as the studies were performed at a constant RNA concentration of 500 nM, and we
assumed it is under the limit of detection. This band becomes visible when a similar TBE gel
was run at 1 µM RNA with a 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of miRNA-1307-3p for both SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 (Supplemental Figure S7, arrow 4). Notably, the bands corresponding to the
complexes formed by SARS-CoV s2m with miRNA-1307-3p are less intense compared to
those of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 9A, arrows 4 and 5). This results in the inability to distinguish
between the dimeric miRNA-1307-3p and the monomeric SARS-CoV s2m (Figure 9A, right,
arrows 2 and 3).
The interpretation of the TBM gels is more complex since they contain Mg2+ ions which
stabilize the dimeric conformations of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements
(Figure 9B). The kissing dimer bands in both s2m elements are visible even upon incubation
with miRNA-1307-3p up to 1:4 ratios (Figure 9B, both, arrow 4). The band corresponding to
the monomeric conformation of SARS-CoV-2 s2m (Figure 9B, left panel, arrow 2) decreases
in intensity as the concentration of the miRNA is increased, whereas for SARS-CoV s2m, like
in the TBE gel, this is not as clear to distinguish as the s2m monomer band (Figure 9B, right,
arrow 2) is overlapping with that of the miRNA-1307-3p dimer band (arrow 3). These results
indicate either increased propensity of miRNA-1307-3p binding to the s2m monomeric
conformations or constant equilibria shift between monomeric and dimeric conformations upon
miRNA binding. We observed two distinct bands for the SARS-CoV-2 s2m RNA:miRNA1307-3p complexes, with one migrating under and the second migrating above the 100-nt
marker band (Figure 9B, left panel, arrows 5 and 6). Similar to the main complex band we

observed in the TBE gel (Figure 9A, left panel, arrow 5), we assign the band indicated by arrow
5 (Figure 9B, left panel) to the complex formed by one s2m element and two miRNA-1307-3p
molecules. In contrast to the TBE gel, where Mg2+ ions present during incubation with miRNA1307-3p are chelated by EDTA, the Mg2+ ions remain present in the TBM gel, allowing the
s2m element to dimerize even after binding to one miRNA-1307-3p molecule, as in this
complex the palindromic sequence in the terminal loop becomes fully exposed. Thus, we assign
the higher molecular weight band we observe in the TBM gel (Figure 9B, left panel, arrow 6)
to the dimer formed by two s2m elements, each of which is additionally bound to a single
miRNA-1307-3p molecule. The s2m conformation in which two miRNA-1307-3p molecules
are bound cannot dimerize since its palindromic sequence is engaged in interactions with the
second molecule of miRNA-1307-3p. Like in the TBE gels, we noted that the s2m
RNA:miRNA-1307-3p complex bands have higher intensity in the case of SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 9B, left panel, arrows 5 and 6) compared to those in SARS-CoV (Figure 9B, right panel,
arrows 5 and 6). Interestingly, the band corresponding to the SARS-CoV s2m kissing complex
with each element bound by a single miRNA-1307-3p molecule (Figure 9B, right panel, arrow
6) is barely visible.
These differences in the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements to miRNA1307-3p cannot easily be explained based on the two-nucleotide difference between the
sequences. The first binding site for miRNA-1307-3p in SARS-CoV has a single nucleotide
difference from that of SARS-CoV-2, which results in a G:U base pair being replaced with a
G:C base pair in its complex with the miRNA (U5C, Figure 5), and a predicted difference in
the binding free energy of only 2.6 kcal/mol as determined by the RNAstructure software (56).
The second binding site for miRNA-1307-3p differs in the nucleotide at position 31, G in
SARS-CoV and U in SARS-CoV-2. However, given its location in an internal bulge, the
predicted binding free energy is the same for both s2m elements and is not expected to make a
difference in miRNA-1307-3p binding at this site. Thus, we hypothesized that the difference
in miRNA-1307-3p binding between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements is due to
their different dimerization properties. We proposed that, when in its monomeric conformation,
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements bind similarly to miRNA-1307-3p, but that these
interactions are inhibited by the s2m kissing dimer formation.
To test this hypothesis, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m samples were incubated with
increasing concentrations of miRNA-1307-3p in the absence of MgCl2, where both elements
exist in their monomeric state, followed by electrophoresing on a TBE gel (Figure 10, lanes 16). For comparison, two samples were incubated in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2, conditions
in which SARS-CoV s2m exists mostly as a kissing dimer, whereas SARS-CoV-2 s2m is
mostly monomeric (Figure 4, right panel) prior to the electrophoresing in the TBE gel where
the Mg2+ ions are chelated by EDTA. As predicted, the bands corresponding to the s2m element
complex formed with two miRNA-1307-3p molecules (Figure 10, arrow 5) have similar
intensities, indicating that the affinity for miRNA-1307-3p does not differ between the two
monomeric s2m elements (Figure 10, arrow 5, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 5 and 6).
However, similar to Figure 9A, in the presence of Mg2+ ions, the band corresponding to the
SARS-CoV s2m complex with two miRNA-1307-3p molecules is clearly less intense than that
of SARS-CoV-2 s2m (Figure 10, compare lanes 8 and 9). We attribute these differences to the
equilibria that exists between monomeric and dimeric conformations of each s2m element in
the presence of Mg2+ ions (Figure 4, right panel). SARS-CoV-2 s2m exists primarily in its
monomeric state, allowing for increased binding to miRNA-1307-3p. In contrast, SARS-CoV
s2m exists primarily in a kissing dimer complex in the presence of Mg2+ ions, presumably
inhibiting its interactions with miRNA-1307-3p. Nonetheless, the presence of Mg2+ ions during
the 1-hour incubation promotes the formation of the complexes between the monomeric s2m

and miRNA-1307-3p, as indicated by the increased complex band intensities for both SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements as compared to those incubated in the absence of any
MgCl2 (Figure 10, arrow 5, compare lanes 1-6 with lanes 8 and 9). Upon chelation of these
ions by EDTA in the TBE gel, both s2m elements dissociate to become fully monomeric, but
the monomeric miRNA-1307-3p (22-nt) is no longer available for binding as it will migrate
faster through the gel. Thus, we attribute the difference in intensity between the SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV s2m:miRNA-1307-3p complex bands (Figure 10, lanes 8 and 9, arrow 5) to
the fact that during the their incubation in the presence of Mg2+ ions, SARS-CoV s2m was
mostly dimeric, which inhibited its binding to miRNA-1307-3p. We conclude from these
results that the s2m dimerization affects its interactions with miRNA-1307-3p.
While the specific role of the s2m element in coronaviruses remains unresolved, it has been
proposed to be involved in viral replication, hijacking of host protein synthesis, and RNA
interference pathways (16, 18, 57). Here, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of the
isolated SARS-CoV-2 s2m element to form an intermediate kissing dimer which is converted
to a stable duplex conformation. Moreover, our results suggest that while the SARS-CoV-2
s2m element may spontaneously convert to the thermodynamically stable duplex over time,
the viral N protein exhibits chaperone activity to accelerate this conversion. In contrast, while
the SARS-CoV s2m element readily forms kissing dimers, these complexes are not converted
to the stable duplex conformation, even in the presence of the N protein. The conversion
mechanism discovered here for SARS-CoV-2 s2m is similar to that seen in HIV-1, in which
viral N protein acts as a molecular chaperone to convert transient kissing dimer complexes into
a stable, extended duplex structures (22, 38, 58). This process in the Retroviridae family of
viruses, to which HIV-1 belongs, is believed to facilitate dimerization of two genomic RNA
copies for packaging in the virion, a function which does not occur in Coronaviridae viruses.
However, an identical mechanism of monomeric stem-loop destabilization and conversion to
thermodynamically stable duplex structures by the N protein has been demonstrated for HCV,
another single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus (24, 59, 60). Furthermore, the mechanism
in HCV was proposed to modulate the interactions of the dimer initiation site with additional
open reading frame stem-loops, which are essential for RNA replication, suggesting similar
functions within SARS-CoV-2 (61, 62). It is possible that in SARS-CoV-2, this dimerization
mechanism may also function in genome frameshifting and subsequent sgRNA and gRNA
synthesis. A three-stemmed pseudoknot structure within the open reading frame (ORF) of the
SARS-CoV genome has been shown previously to act as a ribosomal frameshift stimulating
signal (63, 64). One of the stem-loop structures within this signal contains a 6-nt palindrome
within its terminal loop region which has been demonstrated to form homodimeric kissing
interactions, and disruption of these interactions resulted in reduced frameshifting (65). Thus,
it is possible that the s2m dimerization may facilitate the alignment of multiple gRNA
molecules, in coordination with the kissing loop interactions in the ORF, to allow for proper
frameshifting and RNA synthesis. Lastly, we speculate on the role of genome dimerization
with respect to recombination events. The origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is proposed to be
the result of homologous recombination between bat and pangolin coronaviruses, likely
triggering the cross-species transmission to humans (3, 4). High recombination rates among
coronaviruses have been well documented, though the exact mechanism by which this occurs
is unknown (5). Similarly, this high rate of recombination has been studied extensively in other
viral families, such as Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, and Picornaviridae (66–68). Interestingly,
all of these viral families also contain the conserved s2m element within their 3’ UTR (16, 19,
69). Given the high degree of similarities between recombination events and conservation of
the s2m element within these additional viral families, we speculate whether this element may

be involved in genomic dimerization and potentially contribute to subsequent homologous
recombination events. However, further studies are required to explore such functions.
Our study subsequently investigated the proposed hijacking of cellular miRNA-1307-3p by the
s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 (47–49). Here, we have shown for the first time experimentally
that the SARS-CoV-2 s2m binds multiple copies of miRNA-1307-3p, and furthermore, that
this interaction is affected by the state of s2m dimerization. The role of host cellular miRNA
hijacking by viruses has been demonstrated extensively in previous studies, typically
benefitting the viral life cycle. Bovine viral diarrhea virus, for instance, interacts with miRNA17 upon infection, resulting in enhanced replication, translation, and genomic RNA stability
(70). Similarly, miRNA-133a is bound by the 3’ UTR of the Dengue virus, essentially
“sponging” it from its normal function of regulating the polypyrimidine tract-binding (PTB)
protein (71). This interaction results in an upregulation of the PTB protein, leading to increased
viral replication and translation. Here, through analogy to these other systems, we suggest a
similar mechanism with SARS-CoV-2 hijacking cellular miRNA-1307-3p through the s2m
element. Further experiments are required to test this mechanism, but if proven correct, this
would result in upregulated expression levels of its target mRNAs, including those that encode
for various interleukins (IL18) and interleukin receptors (IL6R, IL10RA, IL10RB) linked to
the “cytokine storm” involved in ARDS development in severe COVID-19 patients (25, 50,
51). Interestingly, IL6, IL10, and IL18 are secreted by ATII epithelial cells, the primary targets
for SARS-CoV-2 infection (53). The latter of these cytokines, IL18, has further been suggested
to be at the “eye of the cytokine storm”, acting synergistically with various other primary
cytokines in a proinflammatory manner to modulate the expression of secondary cytokines,
such as IFN𝛾 (72–74). Moreover, overproduction of IL18 has been linked to a predisposition
for macrophage activation syndrome, resulting in an overactive immune response, as well as
Kawasaki disease and systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune diseases which present
symptoms similar to those seen in critically ill paediatric COVID-19 patients (75, 76). In
addition to its role of promoting increased inflammatory response, high levels of IL18 have
been also shown to be correlated with COPD, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and
gestational diabetes mellitus, all of which enhance patient risk of experiencing severe COVID19 symptoms (75, 77). Thus, we contemplate the implications of a fine-tuned molecular switch
from s2m element dimerization to miRNA-1307-3p binding, with the latter mechanism
potentially aiding in severe COVID-19 symptom development. Altogether, the results of this
study implicate dimerization of the highly conserved s2m element of SARS-CoV-2 as a
potentially significant molecular target for antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19 as well as
future coronavirus-related disease outbreaks.

are highlighted: BSL (purple), PK stem-loop (pink), and s2m element (green). Dashed lines
denote pseudoknot interactions.

Figure 2. Schematic depiction of proposed s2m dimerization mechanism. Kissing complex
formation is mediated by a 4-nt GUAC palindromic sequence located within the loop region
of the motif. The viral N protein acts as a molecular chaperone to aid conversion of the kissing
dimer conformation (top) to a thermodynamically stable extended duplex structure (bottom).

Figure 3. Mg2+-dependent nondenaturing TBE and TBM gel electrophoresis of SARS-CoV-2
s2m. Samples at RNA concentrations of 500 nM and 1 µM were incubated for 1-hour in the
presence of 1, 5, and 10 mM MgCl2 (A) prior to being split and electrophoresed. In the absence
of Mg2+ ions, the s2m element exists primarily in a monomeric conformation (left panel, arrow
1), while the presence of Mg2+ ions promotes the formation of both a kissing complex (arrow
2) and stable, extended duplex (arrow 3), which exists in equilibrium with the monomeric s2m
(right panel). Similarly, samples at an RNA concentration of 1 µM were incubated in the
presence of 1, 5, and 10 mM MgCl2 for 24-hours (B) prior to being split and electrophoresed.
Extended incubation time promoted the spontaneous conversion from the kissing dimer
conformation (arrow 2) to a stable, extended duplex (arrow 3) which is present even upon
chelation of Mg2+ ions (left panel). Degradation of s2m RNA occurred during 24-hour
incubation, as denoted by an asterisk (*).

Figure 4. Mg2+-dependent comparison of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements by
nondenaturing TBE and TBM gel electrophoresis. Both s2m elements at RNA concentrations
of 1 µM were incubated in the presence of 1, 5, and 10 mM MgCl2 for 1-hour prior to being
split and electrophoresed. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements exist primarily in
their monomeric states upon chelation of Mg2+ ions in the TBE gel (left panel, arrow 1). In the
presence of Mg2+ ions in the TBM gel, SARS-CoV exists primarily in dimeric kissing complex
conformation (right panel, arrow 2), whereas SARS-CoV-2 exists in equilibrium between its
monomeric (arrow 1) and two dimeric conformations (arrows 2 and 3).

Figure 5. Schematic representation of SARS-CoV (A) and SARS-CoV-2 (B) s2m element
secondary structures. Structures are adapted from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements
experimentally characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, respectively
(12, 18). Locations of nucleotide differences are highlighted in green (U5C) and red (G31U).
Structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV 2 s2m elements were created using RNAstructure
software and edited using StructureEditor software (56).

Figure 6. Characterization of the s2m element mutant constructs and their dimerization
properties. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments were performed for all four
s2m constructs in the presence of 0 mM MgCl2 (A), with resonances being assigned within the
SARS-CoV-2 s2m spectrum based on the previously characterized secondary structure (12).
All four s2m sequences were additionally incubated in the presence of 1 and 10 mM MgCl2,
followed by electrophoresing in TBE and TBM nondenaturing gels (B). In the presence of

Mg2+ ions (right panel), wild-type SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV (U5C) constructs exist
primarily in a kissing dimer conformation (arrow 2), whereas SARS-CoV (G31U) and SARSCoV-2 s2m constructs exist in equilibrium between monomeric (arrow 1) and two dimeric
conformations (arrows 2 and 3). Higher-order complexes within SARS-CoV (G31U) s2m are
denoted by arrows 4 and 5.

Figure 7. Conversion of the SARS-CoV-2 s2m kissing complex to a stable, extended duplex
by the viral N protein. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements were incubated in the
presence of 1 mM MgCl2 for 1-hour, followed by addition of the N protein in a 1:2 ratio and
additional incubation for 30-minutes at 22 °C. Proteinase K was added to digest the N protein
prior to samples being split and electrophoresed by TBE and TBM nondenaturing PAGE. The
kissing complex formed by SARS-CoV-2 s2m (arrow 2) is converted to a thermodynamically
stable extended duplex (arrow 3) by chaperone activity of the N protein, whereas SARS-CoV
s2m is unable to undergo similar conversion. Control samples in which both s2m elements
were incubated in the presence of BSA in a 1:2 ratio revealed no changes in conversion to
stable duplex conformation.

Figure 8. Binding of both s2m elements to the viral SARS-CoV-2 N protein. SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements were incubated in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2 and the SARSCoV-2 N protein in a 1:2 ratio for 1-hour, followed by electrophoresing in a TBE
nondenaturing gel. The formation of s2m:N protein complex bands (arrows 2-4) was apparent
with a concomitant decrease in s2m monomeric bands (arrow 1) for both s2m elements. Control
samples of each s2m element incubated in the presence of BSA at a 1:2 ratio revealed no
binding, indicating the s2m:N protein complexing was protein-specific.

Figure 9. Interaction of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements with miRNA-13073p. Both s2m elements at concentrations of 500 nM were incubated with 1 mM MgCl2 and
miRNA-1307-3p at increasing ratios (up to 1:4) for 1-hour. Samples were split and analyzed
by TBE and TBM nondenaturing PAGE. Upon chelation of Mg2+ ions in the TBE gel (A), both
SARS-CoV-2 (A, left panel) and SARS-CoV (A, right panel) s2m elements bind to one (arrow
4) and two (arrow 5) molecules of miRNA-1307-3p. Both complex bands of SARS-CoV-2
increase in intensity with a concomitant decrease of the band corresponding to monomeric s2m
(arrow 2). In the presence of Mg2+ ions in the TBM gel (B), both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 exist in equilibrium between their monomeric and dimeric conformations, with each able to
form kissing dimer conformations (arrow 4) that can bind to one (arrow 5) or two (arrow 6)
molecules of miRNA-1307-3p. In all gels, miRNA-1307-3p migrates in both monomeric
(arrow 1) and dimeric (arrow 3) conformations.

Figure 10. Dimerization of the s2m element affects miRNA-binding ability. SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 s2m elements were incubated in the presence of miRNA-1307-3p at 1:0, 1:1,
and 1:2 ratios in the absence of MgCl2 and electrophoresed by nondenaturing TBE PAGE.
Binding affinity to the miRNA does not appear to differ between the two s2m elements, as
indicated by similar complex band intensities (lanes 1-6, arrows 4 and 5). Control samples in
which each s2m element was incubated with 1:2 miRNA-1307-3p in the presence of 1 mM

MgCl2 resulted in increased complex band intensity for SARS-CoV-2 s2m compared to SARSCoV s2m, suggesting dimerization affects miRNA-binding ability. In the absence of MgCl2,
miRNA-1307-3p exists solely in its monomeric conformation (lane 7, arrow 1), whereas
incubation with 1 mM MgCl2 results in the formation of a dimeric conformation as well (lanes
8 and 9, arrow 3).
