Modeling the frequency and number of persons to test to detect and control COVID-19 outbreaks in

21

congregate settings

22

Abstract (238 words)

23

Background: Congregate settings are at risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks.

24

Diagnostic testing can be used as a tool in these settings to identify outbreaks and to control

25

transmission.

26

Methods: We used transmission modeling to estimate the minimum number of persons to test and the

27

optimal frequency to detect small outbreaks of COVID-19 in a congregate facility. We also estimated the

28

frequency of testing needed to interrupt transmission within a facility.

29

Results: The number of people to test and frequency of testing needed depended on turnaround time,

30

facility size, and test characteristics. Parameters are calculated for a variety of scenarios. In a facility of

31

100 people, 26 randomly selected individuals would need to be tested at least every 6 days to identify a

32

true underlying prevalence of at least 5%, with test sensitivity of 85%, and greater than 95% outbreak

33

detection sensitivity. Disease transmission could be interrupted with universal, facility-wide testing with

34

rapid turnaround every three days.

35

Conclusions: Testing a subset of individuals in congregate settings can improve early detection of small

36

outbreaks of COVID-19. Frequent universal diagnostic testing can be used to interrupt transmission

37

within a facility, but its efficacy is reliant on rapid turnaround of results for isolation of infected

38

individuals.

Background
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a highly transmissible

42

pathogen that spreads easily in shared environments (1). Thus, congregate settings, such as long-term

43

care facilities, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, and high-density workplaces, are at increased

44

risk for outbreaks of COVID-19 (2-9). Diagnostic testing to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in congregate

45

settings may achieve at least two key public health objectives: 1) testing can identify outbreaks,

46

triggering the application of intervention measures and further testing, and 2) testing can identify

47

infectious individuals who need to isolate to prevent further transmission.

48

We developed and applied models related to SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness, test sensitivity and

49

specificity, and time to test results to estimate both the number of people and frequency of testing

50

needed in congregate settings to achieve: 1) early detection of outbreaks and 2) transmission

51

interruption. These estimates can inform testing strategies designed to protect people living or working

52

in congregate settings and the communities in which they reside.

Materials and Methods

55

Testing for early detection of outbreaks

56

Outbreak detection was defined as identifying at least one positive test, regardless of true

57

underlying prevalence. We defined “early” detection to mean identifying at least one positive result

58

before case counts surpass a set number; here we chose 2, 5, and 10 true cases. For this purpose, the

59

number of people that need to be tested in a congregate setting is dependent on the true underlying

60

prevalence of infection, and the sensitivity and the specificity of the test. We estimated the number of

61

randomly-selected individuals (n) needed to test for detection of an outbreak based on an expected

62

number of infections (𝑛0, commensurate with prevalence 𝑝), a minimum detection sensitivity 𝑆, and a

3

63

minimum positive predictive value. When the 𝑛 required exceeded the facility size 𝑁, then the outbreak

64

was considered too small to be detected.

65

If 𝑛 individuals are randomly selected for testing (test sensitivity 𝜖, specificity 𝜋) from a facility of

66

size 𝑁 where the prevalence of infections is 𝑝, and presence of an outbreak is indicated by at least one

67

positive test result, the probabilities of four possible outcomes are:

68

•

Detection of outbreak and an outbreak exists (true positive): 𝑇𝑃 = 1 ― (𝐹𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 + 𝑇𝑁)

69

•

Detection of an outbreak but no outbreak exists (false positive): 𝐹𝑃 = (1 ― 𝑝)𝑁(1 ― 𝜋𝑛)

70

•

No detection of an outbreak but outbreak exists (false negative): 𝐹𝑁 = [𝑝(1 ― 𝜖) + (1 ― 𝑝)𝜋]𝑛

71

―𝑇𝑁

72

•

73

For the facility level, outbreak detection sensitivity is 𝑆 = 𝑇𝑃/(𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁) and positive predictive value is

74

𝑃𝑃𝑉 = 𝑇𝑃/(𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃).

75

The true underlying prevalence of infection, 𝑛, was determined by the rate of introduction, (𝜂 =

76

community incidence × facility size) and the doubling time (𝜏) within the facility as:

No detection of an outbreak and no outbreak exists (true negative): 𝑇𝑁 = (1 ― 𝑝)𝑁𝜋𝑛

𝑑𝑛

77
78

𝑑𝑡

= (ln2)𝑛/𝜏 + 𝜂

Solving for the expected number of infections at time 𝑡 after first introduction (i.e., with n(0)=1) gives:
𝑒𝑡 ln2/𝜏 + (𝜂𝜏/ln2) (𝑒𝑡 ln2/𝜏 ― 1).

79
80

At a facility where the rate of introduction is 𝜂 and the doubling time is 𝜏, the expected number of

81

infections at time 𝑡 after first introduction is:

82

𝑒𝑡 ln2/𝜏 + (𝜂𝜏/ln2) (𝑒𝑡 ln2/𝜏 ― 1).

83

We assumed a community incidence of 100 cases per 100,000 people and doubling time for congregate

84

settings of 3.4 days (4). Expressions were calculated using R software v3.6.2.

86

To interrupt transmission (i.e., achieve a basic reproduction number below one), a successful

87

testing strategy may need to achieve at least 60% reduction in transmission (10). We estimated the

88

percent reduction in transmission for two scenarios of facility-wide testing: 1) both test-positive and

89

symptomatic individuals are isolated, and 2) only test-positive individuals are isolated (appropriate in

90

settings where symptom ascertainment is difficult). Expressions were also calculated using R 3.6.2.

91

We used the infectivity profile of COVID-19 estimated by He et al. (11). We also used an

92

assumption that presymptomatic infections account for 50% of transmission and 40% of infections are

93

asymptomatic (12). In our model, test sensitivity ranged 85%–95%, depending on both the test type and

94

time since exposure (i.e., more sensitive during times of high viral load) (13).

95

If the infectiousness of an infected individual is 𝐼(𝑡) (normalized to unity), where 𝑡 is the time

96

since exposure, and the fraction of infected individuals who have already shown symptoms at 𝑡 is 𝜎(𝑡),

97

then the proportion of transmissions eliminated on isolation of symptomatic individuals, 𝑃𝑠, is:

Testing for early detection of outbreaks

114

We estimated the number of individuals needed to test for early outbreak identification for 18

115

scenarios (Table 1), which required testing between 16% and 90% of individuals, depending on facility

116

size and true cluster size. For a facility of 100 people, 47 individuals would need to be tested to identify

117

at least one positive result if there were truly 5 cases (5% prevalence) with test sensitivity of 85%, and

118

greater than 95% outbreak detection sensitivity.

100,000 daily, an introduction from the community can be expected to occur on average every 10 days,

127

and a 5% prevalence would be attained 6 days after introduction (Table 2). Therefore, the interval

Testing to interrupt transmission

136

With no testing, isolation of symptomatic individuals at symptom onset alone would achieve a

137

33% reduction in transmission (Figure 1A). When symptom-based isolation and testing with immediate

138

results (within 15 minutes) were combined, a 60% reduction in transmission (i.e., R0 <1) (1) would be

139

achieved if tests were administered at least every 3 days. A 60% reduction in transmission would also be

140

achieved by administering tests every 2 days if there was a 24-hour delay in results reporting, and by

141

administering tests daily with a 36-hour delay in results.

142

Using testing alone without additional isolation of symptomatic individuals (Figure 1B) would

143

require more frequent testing to achieve a 60% reduction in transmission. Daily testing would be

144

required if results were available in 24 hours and testing every 2 days required if there was a 12-hour

145

delay in test results.

Discussion
Numerous COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in congregate settings, sometimes with high

152

morbidity and mortality (2-9). In this modeling study, we found that early identification of an outbreak

153

of 5 cases in a facility could be achieved by testing from 21% to 57% of individuals, depending on facility

154

size. Minimal testing intervals were estimated (e.g., every 6 days for a 100 person facility), but more

155

frequent testing would increase the likelihood of early detection. Testing frequency should take into

156

account facility size. Detection of cases among a sample of the facility population would indicate a need

157

for facility-wide testing and other intervention measures to interrupt transmission.

158

Using testing as a tool to interrupt transmission required a much higher frequency of testing,

159

generally every 3 days or fewer, particularly if there are reporting lags in receiving test results (i.e., 1–3

160

days vs. 15 minutes). Findings regarding testing frequency align with another recent modeling study

161

focused on institutes of higher education (14). Ultimately, the frequency of testing at a facility will

162

depend on the balance between risk tolerance, frequency of introducing infections, and resource

163

availability.

164

One limitation of this analysis is that we applied general formulas that did not account for

165

specific characteristics of individuals residing in and working in these congregate settings. Furthermore,

166

uncertainties in the modeling parameters introduce imprecision in derived estimates. These values can

167

provide starting points for consideration for testing strategies but should not be considered definitive.

168

As additional data become available, parameter estimates can be refined and models can be fitted to

169

the best available data.

170

To reduce transmission, testing should always be used in combination with other prevention

171

measures including social distancing, wearing masks and cloth face coverings, hand hygiene, cleaning

172

and disinfection, screening, and isolation of individuals that are symptomatic or test positive, and

173

quarantine of their close contacts. In coordination with these measures, testing strategies may reduce

174

morbidity and mortality among individuals in congregate settings, prevent further spread into the

175

community, and decrease strain on healthcare systems.
