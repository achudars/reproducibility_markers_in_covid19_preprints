Abstract
Convenient, repeatable, large-scale molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 would be a key weapon to help control
the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, standard SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols are invasive and rely on
numerous items that can be subject to supply chain bottlenecks, and as such are not suitable for frequent
repeat testing. Specifically, personal protective equipment (PPE), nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, the associated
viral transport media (VTM), and kits for RNA isolation and purification have all been in short supply at various
times during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets and aerosols
transmitted through person-to-person contact, and thus saliva may be a relevant medium for diagnosing SARSCoV-2 infection status. Here we describe a saliva-based testing method that bypasses the need for RNA
isolation/purification. In experiments with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into saliva, this method has a
limit of detection of 500-1000 viral particles per mL, rivalling the standard NP swab method, and initial studies
also show excellent performance with 100 clinical samples. This saliva-based process is operationally simple,
utilizes readily available materials, and can be easily implemented by existing testing sites, thus allowing for
high-throughput, rapid, and repeat testing of large populations.

Background
The slow roll-out and inconsistent availability of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has hobbled efforts
to control the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. Testing protocols based on the use of nasopharyngeal
(NP) swabs as the collection agent, placed in a tube containing viral transport media (VTM), followed by RNA
isolation/purification and subsequent analysis by RT-qPCR is currently the most common method (Figure
1A).1,2 While some variant of this process has been implemented worldwide, there are multiple challenges with
this workflow. Sample collection using NP swabs requires healthcare workers wearing personal protective
equipment (PPE) to collect samples, the swabs can be uncomfortable for the patients during collection, and
the swabs and the associated VTM have been in short supply at many times and in most locations. In addition,
RNA isolation/purification is another significant bottleneck, both in the time and labor required for this process,
and in the availability of the equipment and reagents. All of these components also add to the cost of the
testing process.
There is emerging consensus that widespread, frequently repeated testing is necessary for a safer
return to activities that are important for society. Given the data suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can be spread
by pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic carriers,3-6 localized outbreaks could be dramatically reduced or prevented
if individuals shedding SARS-CoV-2 could be readily identified and isolated. For example, imagine a testing
bubble placed over a group that desires face-to-face interaction – employees of a company, members of a
sports team, extended family networks, etc. If all members of the group could be tested for SARS-CoV-2, then
isolated, then tested again after an appropriate time increment (likely ~4-5 days, in line with the incubation
period for SARS-CoV-27,8), two negative tests would provide confidence for a safer return to activities. Of
course, in practice there are challenges with total self-isolation and avoidance of others outside the testing
bubble, but the above scenario represents one promising path forward, allowing positive cases to be identified
and contained, and reducing the probability that pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic virus shedders unknowingly
transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. Unfortunately, as the size of a group grows larger, widespread and frequent
testing for SARS-CoV-2 using the standard testing protocol depicted in Figure 1A becomes impractical. For
example, it would be untenable to repeatedly test all members of a university in a short time period using this

process, and thus we were motivated to develop a streamlined, cost-effective, SARS-CoV-2 testing platform
that can be realistically scaled to test thousands of individuals a day.

When considering various sample collection possibilities, saliva is attractive due to the known detection
of SARS-CoV-2 through oral shedding, and the potential for rapid and easy self-collection,9-11 thus minimizing
the need for direct healthcare provider-patient contact and consequent conservation of PPE. In addition, a
number of recent reports have detailed the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva through the workflow in Figure
1B, including a report showing higher viral loads in saliva when compared to matched NP swabs from the
same patients.12 Importantly, saliva (expelled in aerosols and droplets) may be a significant factor in personto-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2,10 and it has been suggested that NP swab tests remain positive long
after patients are infectious (potentially due to detection of inactive virus or remnants of viral RNA in the NP
cavity),13 whereas SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in saliva are highest during the first week of infection, when a
person is most infectious. These data suggest that viral loads in saliva may be a good reflection of the
transmission potential of patients infected SARS-CoV-2.13-15
While we are unaware of direct SARS-CoV-2 detection from saliva that bypasses RNA
isolation/purification, there are several reports of detection from swab/VTM that bypasses RNA
isolation/purification (Figure 1C).16-23 With the ultimate goal of providing convenient, scalable, and costeffective molecular diagnostic testing for >10,000 individuals per day using a single COVID-19 testing center,
here we report the discovery of a sensitive saliva-based detection method for SARS-CoV-2 that bypasses RNA
isolation/purification (Figure 1D). This SARS-CoV-2 testing process and workflow is convenient, simple, rapid,
and inexpensive, and can be readily adopted by any testing facility currently using RT-qPCR.

Results
Development of a direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR process for detection of SARS-CoV-2
While SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the nasopharynx, collecting NP samples is neither trivial nor
innocuous, and for repeat testing to track disease progression within a given patient this method may prove
unreliable, due to inconsistencies in repeated sampling and potential formation of scar tissue, altogether
resulting in possible false-negatives.24 Compounding these anatomic limitations, the procedure for NP sample
collection is invasive, further reducing patient compliance for repeated and serial sampling. Saliva may serve
as an important mediator in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 between individuals via droplets and aerosols,25-27 and

thus viral loads in saliva may serve as a highly relevant correlate of transmission potential. However, saliva is
comprised of constituents that may hinder virus detection by RT-qPCR, such as degradative enzymes. As
such, we sought to identify conditions that could take advantage of the many positives of saliva while
overcoming potential limit of detection challenges with this collection medium. For the optimization phase of
this work we utilized two versions of inactivated SARS-CoV-2, one inactivated through gamma(γ)-irradiation
(5x106 RADs) and one inactivated through heat (65oC, 30 min). For the detection of SARS-CoV-2, we utilized
the commercially available TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit, developed and marketed by Thermo Fisher
Scientific. This multiplex RT-qPCR kit targets the ORF1ab (replication), N-gene (nucleocapsid), and S-gene
(spike) of SARS-CoV-2. To reduce cost and extend reagent usage, we performed RT-qPCR reactions at half
the suggested reaction mix volume.28
Heat treatment. Up-front heating of freshly collected saliva samples is attractive as a simple method
to inactivate the virus without having to open the collection vessel. Indeed, heat treatment is often used to
inactivate saliva patient samples,29,30 thus conferring added biosafety by decreasing the likelihood of viral
transmission via sample handling by personnel. Common conditions for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation are heating
at 56-60°C for 30-60 min,30,31 although other temperature and times have been examined.30 Using intact, γirradiated SARS-CoV-2 spiked into fresh human saliva (that was confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative), we
observed dramatic time- and temperature-dependent improvement in SARS-CoV-2 detection by direct RTqPCR, without the use of RNA extraction. When incubated at ambient temperature (no heat treatment), no
SARS-CoV-2 genes were detectable (Figure 2). As temperature and incubation time were increased,
substantial improvement in virus detection was observed, with 100% identification of all SARS-CoV-2 genes,
in all replicate samples, being detected following a 30 min incubation at 95°C. Importantly, a short heating
time (5 minutes) at 95oC (as has been examined by others29,32) does not allow for sensitive detection; the 30
minute duration is essential, as it is likely that this extended heating inactivates components of saliva that inhibit
RT-qPCR. Thus, proper heating of patient samples allows for virus detection without the need for RNA
extraction, with the added benefit of inactivating the samples, thus substantially reducing biohazard risks.

Figure 2. The effect of heat on SARS-CoV-2 detection. γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (from BEI, used at 1.0x104
viral copies/mL) was spiked into fresh human saliva (SARS-CoV-2 negative). Samples diluted 1:1 with 2X Trisborate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (0.5 mL in 50 mL conical tubes) were incubated at 25°C (ambient temperature), or
in a hot water bath at 65°C, 75°C, or 95°C, for 1, 5, 15, or 30 min. All saliva samples were spiked with purified
MS2 bacteriophage (1:40 MS2:sample) as an internal control. Virus-spiked saliva samples, a positive control
(pos; SARS-CoV-2 positive control, 5.0x103 copies/mL, no MS2) and a negative control (neg; water, no MS2)
were directly analyzed by RT-qPCR, in triplicate, for SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab (green triangle), N-gene (red
square), and S-gene (blue circle), and MS2 (open circle). Undetermined Ct values are plotted at 0.
Saliva collection buffer. We next sought to evaluate saliva collection buffers as a means to enhance
viral RNA stability, but also to increase uniformity between saliva samples and to decrease sample viscosity.
In conjunction with RNA isolation/purification, other groups have utilized protocols whereby saliva was provided
by a patient and soon thereafter combined with the collection buffer; reported collection buffers include
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS),33 DNA/RNA Shield,34 and Tris-EDTA (TE).35 Using intact, γ-irradiated
SARS-CoV-2 spiked into fresh human saliva, which was then heat treated at 95°C for 30 min, we observed
outstanding virus detection when saliva samples were combined with either Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) or TE
buffer (Figure 3A). Comparable Ct values were observed between TBE and TE buffer, but TE yielded greater
variability between individual gene replicates, whereas TBE buffer yielded highly clustered data. In stark
contrast, combining saliva with PBS or two commercially available buffers (DNA/RNA Shield, SDNA-1000),

completely abrogated viral detection, including the MS2 bacteriophage internal control, indicating that these
buffers directly interfere with the RT-qPCR reaction itself. TBE, TE, and PBS were further titrated with different
concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, where similar trends were observed, namely, greater replicate variability with
TE buffer, and no virus detection with PBS (Supporting Figure 1). Thus, when saliva samples are combined
with TBE buffer to a final working concentration of 1X, SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in saliva without RNA
extraction; TE buffer is also suitable but more variability is observed. These findings further suggest that while
PBS and commercially available buffers may be appropriate for samples that are processed via RNA
extraction, these agents are incompatible with direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR.

was 1X. Samples (0.5 mL in 50 mL conical tubes) were incubated in a hot water bath at 95°C for 30 min. (B)
Detergent optimization. γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (1.0x104 viral copies/mL) was spiked into fresh human saliva
(SARS-CoV-2 negative) and combined 1:1 with TBE buffer at a final working concentration of 1X. Samples
were treated with detergents (Triton X-100, 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%; Tween 20, 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%; NP-40, 2%, 1%,
0.5%) after heating at 95°C for 30 min. All saliva samples were spiked with purified MS2 bacteriophage (1:40
MS2:sample) as an internal control. Virus-spiked saliva samples, a positive control (pos; SARS-CoV-2 positive
control, 5.0x103 copies/mL, no MS2) and a negative control (neg; water, no MS2) were directly analyzed by
RT-qPCR, in triplicate, for SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab (green triangle), N-gene (red square), and S-gene (blue
circle), and MS2 (open circle). Undetermined Ct values are plotted at 0.
Sample additives. In addition to saliva collection buffers, various additives have been explored for
their ability to enhance SARS-CoV-2 detection.1,36-38 Therefore, detergents, including Triton X-100, Tween 20,
and NP-40 (Figure 3B), as well as various RNA stabilizing agents, including RNase inhibitor, carrier RNA,
glycogen, TCEP, proteinase K, bovine serum albumin (BSA), RNAlater, and PBS-DTT (Supporting Figure 2)
were examined. Notably, modest improvements in viral detection were observed with all detergents tested (~2
Ct, Figure 3B) and with addition of carrier RNA, RNase inhibitor, and BSA (Supporting Figure 2), These
additives slightly improve virus detection, without interfering with RT-qPCR; in addition, if clinical saliva
specimens are especially viscous, addition of detergent may improve ease of sample handling. However,
inclusion of detergents prior to heat treatment inhibited viral detection, emphasizing the importance of adding
detergents after heat treatment, if they are to be included (Supporting Figure 3). Of the detergents tested,
Tween 20 was chosen for incorporation into the standard sample processing protocol, given its ease of
handling and cost. When samples were treated with Tween 20 and TBE (alone or in combination, either before
or after heating) the ideal workflow for virus detection, as defined by the lowest Ct values with the greatest
clustering of individual replicates, was TBE buffer before heating, and Tween 20 after heating (Supporting
Figure 3). However, it is important to note that comparable results were obtained when TBE was added after
heating (Supporting Figure 3), suggesting flexibility in when TBE buffer can be included during sample
processing. Altogether, the safest and most streamlined protocol would be: collection of saliva samples, heat
at 95oC for 30 min, add TBE buffer and Tween 20, followed by RT-qPCR.
Limit of detection. Using the optimized protocol of addition of TBE (or TE) buffer at a 1:1 ratio with
saliva, followed by heat treatment at 95°C for 30 min and addition of Tween 20 to a final concentration of 0.5%,
the limit of detection (LOD) was determined. Other reports have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is shed into

saliva at a remarkably wide range from 10,000-10,000,000,000 copies/mL.12,26 While the LOD of SARS-CoV2 approved diagnostic methods can vary considerably (500-80,000 viral copies/mL39) and are not always
reported, the best LOD values for SARS-CoV-2 using RNA extraction protocols appear to be approximately
1000 copies/mL.28 Similarly, a LOD of 5610 copies/mL was found for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva using
RNA purification.12 To determine the LOD for this new direct protocol (salivaRT-qPCR), a side-by-side
comparison was conducted of intact, γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 spiked into fresh human saliva compared to a
process that includes RNA isolation/purification. As shown in Figure 4, comparable LOD measurements were
observed, with LOD of ~500 viral copies/mL for both the direct process with addition of Tween 20 and TBE
buffer, and the process using RNA purification. Similar results were observed with heat-inactivated SARSCoV-2, whereby the LOD was measured to be 5000 viral copies/mL for both RNA extraction of saliva samples
and direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR, with greater detection if the virus was directly analyzed in water (Supporting
Figure 4).

spiked into fresh human saliva (SARS-CoV-2 negative), with or without TBE buffer(1X) at 1.0x102, 5.0x102,
1.0x103, 2.5x103, 5.0x103, 1.0x104, 5.0x104, 1.0x105, and 5.0x105 viral copies/mL. Samples were incubated at
95°C for 30 min, then combined with or without Tween 20 (0.5%). All saliva samples were spiked with purified
MS2 bacteriophage (1:40 MS2:sample) as an internal control. Virus-spiked saliva samples were either
processed for RNA extraction followed by RT-qPCR (purified RNA), or directly analyzed by RT-qPCR (direct
saliva). All samples, including a positive control (pos; SARS-CoV-2 positive control, 5.0x103 copies/mL, no
MS2) and a negative control (neg; water, no MS2) were analyzed by RT-qPCR, in triplicate, for SARS-CoV-2
ORF1ab (green triangle), N-gene (red square), and S-gene (blue circle), and MS2 (open circle). Undetermined
Ct values are plotted at 0. The limit of detection (LOD) is indicated by the dotted vertical line.
As the TaqPath/MasterMix RT-qPCR reagents from ThermoFisher provide the necessary specificity for
SARS-CoV-2 detection in a simplified workflow, this system was utilized for all the experiments described
above. However, we have also assessed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved
primers and probes for SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 genes, and the human RNase P (RP) gene control in this
direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR protocol, and the results show that these primers give comparable LOD values, with
5000 viral copies/mL using heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2, and 500 viral copies/mL using γ-irradiated SARSCoV-2 (Supporting Figure 5). These findings further illustrate that our optimized protocol may be used with
comparable detection across multiple analytical platforms. Altogether, these findings indicate that the optimized
protocol (heat treatment of saliva samples at 95°C for 30 min / addition of TBE buffer and Tween 20) yields a
LOD that is comparable to reported clinical viral shedding concentrations in oral fluid, thus emphasizing the
translatability of the protocol to detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples.
Sample handling optimization. In preparation for clinical samples and real-world testing, we first
evaluated the ability to detect spiked inactivated virus in samples that were stored at varying temperatures
(ambient (25°C), 4°C, -20°C, and -80°C), for varying lengths of time (≤24 hrs). Most importantly, at room
temperature and at 4oC samples processed after 1 hr showed little difference from those processed after 24
hr storage, suggesting considerable flexibility in processing time (Supporting Figure 6). Some increased
variability between individual gene replicates and loss of signal was observed with prolonged storage and
freeze/thaw cycles (Supporting Figure 6).
Next, evaluation was made of the effect of sample volume in the saliva collection vessels (50 mL conical
tubes) on viral detection, after heating at 95°C for 30 min in a hot water bath, due to concerns of evaporation
of smaller samples and incomplete heating of larger samples. No appreciable difference was observed across
11

the anticipated range of clinical saliva sample volumes (0.5-5 mL), indicating that sample volume does not
impact virus detection (Supporting Figure 7). Furthermore, if samples are transferred to smaller vessels for
more efficient long-term cold storage (1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes), no appreciable differences in virus
detection between different volumes is anticipated (Supporting Figure 7). Finally, as clinical saliva samples
can sometimes contain particulates, we next evaluated whether removal of the particulates via centrifugation
affected viral detection (Supporting Figure 8). Notably, if samples were centrifuged, with the resultant
supernatant being used for direct RT-qPCR, the LOD was approximately 10-fold worse, with fewer individual
gene replicates being detected at lower viral copy numbers (Supporting Figure 8). Therefore, we recommend
avoiding centrifugation of samples if possible. Altogether, these findings suggest that (1) saliva samples are
stable under varying storage conditions, (2) the volume of sample heated with collection vessels does not
affect viral detection, and (3) centrifugation of samples should be avoided for direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR testing
of SARS-CoV-2.
LOD reproducibility. In order to evaluate the robustness of the optimized direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR
approach, the LOD of 1000 SARS-CoV-2 viral copies/mL was measured in 30 independent replicate samples
(Figure 5). γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into fresh saliva from two healthy donors, and two
commercially available saliva sources. Across all replicates, these samples with 1000 viral copies/mL were
consistently detected (all three viral genes), further testifying to the ability of direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR to detect
SARS-CoV-2. In order to validate the specificity of our detection system to SARS-CoV-2, saliva was spiked
with or without SARS-CoV-2 (γ-irradiated virus, synthetic N-transcript), two other human coronaviruses (OC43,
229E), SARS and MERS synthetic RNA, and human RNA (extracted from HEK 293 cells). Among these
samples, SARS-CoV-2 genes were only detected in the positive control, and SARS-CoV-2 samples, further
supporting the specificity of the detection platform for SARS-CoV-2 (Supporting Figure 9).

Undetermined Ct values are plotted at 0.
Clinical validation of direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
Our findings support an optimized SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic approach that increases accessibility to
testing by using saliva (rather than NP swabs) and eliminates the need for RNA extraction (thus saving time
and resources). We next sought to assess our protocol with clinical samples. Although the changes in viral
load in the NP cavity and in saliva over time are unknown, there is reason to believe they are different,40,41 so
exact concordance between the two samples might not be expected; detection in saliva can provide
complementary information to that in the NP cavity.

To evaluate the ability of the direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical
patient specimens, saliva was collected contemporaneously with NP swabs from 100 individuals using the
following protocol: After saliva collection, TE was added at a 1:1 ratio, and samples were frozen for over a
week before processing. For the evaluation, samples were thawed, 10X TBE buffer was added to a final
concentration of 1X, heated at 95°C for 30 min, cooled to room temperature, and Tween 20 was added to a
final concentration of 0.5%, followed by direct RT-qPCR. Given biological complexity in clinical samples,
variabilities in signal detection based on viral load and gene target length (ORF1ab > S > N) may occur;
therefore, a given result was interpreted as positive if one or more gene targets were detected, and negative if
no gene targets were detected. Furthermore, a result was considered valid if all gene targets were detected
in the SARS-CoV-2 positive control and no gene targets were detected in the negative control. A notable power
in the context of a multiplex system is the ability to evaluate three independent viral genes in a single reaction,
rather than relying upon multiple probes across different reactions for a single viral gene (as is used in other
systems). One of the benefits of saliva-based testing is the possibility of frequent and easy retesting of samples
and of individuals, and as such duplicate testing (testing of the same saliva sample two different times) was
utilized for this study.
Of the 100 samples analyzed, 9 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 as assessed by NP swab, and upon
duplicate testing the direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR process identified the same 9 samples as positive, with 8 of 9
saliva samples positive in both of the replicates. All 91 samples identified as negative by NP swab were also
negative via saliva testing, although in one of these samples one of the duplicate runs was positive, but was
negative upon re-tests (Figure 6, Table 1). Even though these samples were not run under the fully optimized
protocol, this initial testing of clinical samples using direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR showed excellent performance.
When testing samples a single time, it was 88.9% sensitive and 98.9% specific for SARS-CoV-2, with an 11.1%
false negative and 1.1% false positive rate, and 88.9% positive and 98.9% negative predictive value. Using
duplicate testing of samples, sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, all
increased to 100%, and the false negative and positive rates decreased to 0%.

Discussion
Comparison of NP swab and saliva-based testing. When seeking to develop a SARS-CoV-2 molecular
diagnostic protocol suitable for testing >10,000 individuals a day, the ease with which saliva can be collected,
and the known presence of the virus in saliva makes it highly desirable as the sample medium. As a diagnostic
tool, such testing has the additional advantage of making assessments directly from an oral fluid that may be
a culprit in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.10 Unfortunately, only a handful of studies have examined the viral
load dynamics over time for saliva and NP swab samples.40,41 While these studies support the notion that
SARS-CoV-2 tends to be at its highest level in saliva during the first week of infection, more information is
needed on this important topic. In contrast, studies have shown that while live virus can no longer be cultured
from patients 10 days after symptom onset,42 NP swabs continue to be positive after a patient is in the
convalescent phase and no longer infectious.13 As such, it is quite possible that differences observed in studies
comparing SARS-CoV-2 levels in saliva and NP swabs are real, and not an artifact of different testing
sensitivities; while in general concordance between the NP swab and saliva testing has been high in other
studies (87%,40 92%,14 100%43), results will likely depend on what point during infection a patient is sampled.
Direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR process, key advances and remaining limitations. The direct saliva-to-RTqPCR method described herein, bypassing NP swabs, VTM, and RNA isolation/purification, was enabled by a
handful of key discoveries. First, the time and duration of heating the saliva sample is critical. Standard
protocols for heat inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 call for heating at ~60oC for 30 minutes;30,31 while these
conditions inactivate the virus, they do not allow for successful SARS-CoV-2 detection via direct RT-qPCR,
likely because of the persistence of as-yet-unidentified factors in saliva that are inhibitory to RT-qPCR. Heating
at 95°C for 30 minutes likely inactivates these inhibitory components and allows for excellent SARS-CoV-2
detection in this direct process that bypasses RNA isolation/purification. Second, while TE buffer performs
well, consistent with another report successfully using TE to extract dry NP swabs,17 TBE buffer provides more
reliability and consistency in our direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the addition of
the non-ionic detergent Tween-20 also helped improve detection of SARS-CoV-2, possibly by facilitating the
opening of the viral capsid to allow the release of RNA to provide sufficient template for RT-qPCR detection.

Our preliminary assessment of clinical samples is very promising, especially given that these samples
were not collected and processed under the optimized protocol (they were collected before our discovery of
the benefits of TBE buffer and Tween 20); with these samples TE buffer was added to the sample, and they
were frozen for over a week before processing. However, even under this non-optimized workflow we were
able to identify all 9 NP swab positives with duplicate runs of the samples. Next steps are to perform similar
head-to-head comparisons between the NP swab-based method and our optimized workflow with additional
clinical samples.
Supply chain, costs, and next-generation technology. A major benefit of the simple workflow (see
Graphical Abstract) detailed herein is its ability to be adopted by any diagnostic laboratory currently using RTqPCR in SARS-CoV-2 testing. In addition to the time savings and major logistical benefits of using saliva and
bypassing RNA isolation/purification, our analysis of the costs of all reagents/disposables for this process
amounts to ~$10 per test, the bulk of which are the TaqPath/MasterMix. This cost could drop further if samples
are pooled before RT-qPCR. Pooling considerations will necessarily be informed by data on the expected
positive rate in the population to be tested, and also the relationship between viral load and infectivity;44-46 while
one recent study showed that live SARS-CoV-2 could not be cultured from samples containing less than
1,000,000 viral copies per mL,42 more information is needed.

And, while there is no indication that

TaqPath/MasterMix will be limited by the supply chain, we show that this process and workflow is also
compatible with other primer sets, such as the N1 and N2 primers and probes from the CDC. In the future,
development of analogous saliva-based processes that bypass RNA isolation/purification can be envisioned
for alternative back-end detection technologies, such as the LAMP method,2,47 which if successful would result
in an even shorter overall time from sample collection to results.
In summary, described herein is a sensitive diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 that is operationally
simple, bypasses supply chain bottlenecks, evaluates a clinically relevant infectious fluid, is appropriate for
large scale repeat testing, is cost effective, and can be readily adopted by other laboratories. Large scale
SARS-CoV-2 testing will be a powerful weapon in preventing spread of this virus and helping to control the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Foundation Hospital. We are grateful to Dr. Lois Hoyer for use of QuantStudio3 RT-qPCR instruments.

Materials and Methods
Acquisition and processing of clinical samples
All clinical samples from study participants were collected in accordance with University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) IBC-approved protocol number 4604 and IRB-approved protocol number
20CRU3150. Saliva in 1:1 1X TE buffer and discarded VTM samples collected from 100 adults at the Carle
Foundation Hospital Drive-thru COVID-19 testing center were collected and frozen at -80oC for over a week.
Upon thawing, 10X TBE buffer was added to the samples to a final concentration of 1X, heated at 95°C for 30
min, cooled to room temperature, and Tween 20 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. The optimized
direct saliva-to-RT-qPCR approach was compared to detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal (NP)
swab in VTM performed at the Carle Foundation Hospital. In all studies conducted, researchers were blinded
to the results obtained from clinical RT-qPCR tests performed on NP swabs at the Carle Foundation Hospital.

Collection and processing of fresh saliva from healthy donors
Fresh saliva was collected from healthy individuals in 50 mL conical tubes (BD Falcon) in accordance
with University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign IBC-approved protocol numbers 4604 and 4589. In some
experiments, pooled saliva from healthy donors was purchased from Lee BioSolutions, Inc. (CN 991-05-P) and
Innovative Research (CN IRHUSL50ML). Saliva was diluted at a 1:1 ratio with either TBE buffer (100mM TrisHCl pH8.0, 90mM boric acid, and 1mM EDTA) or TE buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH8.0 and 1mM EDTA) buffer. In
some experiments, Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research), and SDNA-1000

(Spectrum Solutions), were also tested at final working concentrations of 2X, 1.5X, 1X, and 0.5X. Known
amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated virus (BEI) were spiked into saliva samples. Samples were incubated
in a hot water bath at 95°C for 30 min. All saliva samples were spiked with purified MS2 bacteriophage (1:40
MS2:sample) as an internal control. In some experiments, RNA extraction was performed on 200 µL saliva (+/virus) using MagMax Viral/Pathogen II Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied Biosciences CN A48383) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted RNA was eluted from magnetic beads in 50µl UltraPure DNase/RNasefree distilled water (Ambion CN 10977023). RNA concentration of eluted RNA was measured using Qubit RNA
Broad Range (BR) assay kit (Fisher Scientific).

SARS-CoV-2 inactivated virus and human coronaviruses
In most experiments, fresh pooled saliva diluted 1:1 in TBE buffer (1x final concentration) were spiked
with either gamma-irradiated (BEI cat# NR-52287, Lot no. 70033322) or heat-inactivated (BEI cat# NR-52286,
Lot no. 70034991) SARS-CoV-2 virions. The reported genome copy number pre-inactivation for γ-irradiated
and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 are 1.7x109 and 3.75x108 genome equivalents/mL, respectively, for the
specified lot numbers. The following reagent was deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020,
Gamma-irradiated, NR-52287, and heat-inactivated, NR-52286. Seasonal human coronaviruses (OC43 and
229E strains) were obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at UTMB.
Genomic RNA for SARS-Related Coronavirus 2 (Isolate USA-WA1/2020), NR-52285, was obtained
from BEI Resources. In addition, the 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (CN 10006625), SARS-CoV Control (CN
10006624), and MERS-CoV Control (CN 10006623) synthetic RNA transcripts were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies.
All virus stocks and RNA transcripts were aliquoted in small volumes and stored at -70°C. Stocks were
serially diluted to the correct concentration in RNase-free water on the day of experimentation.

RT-qPCR assay
We performed a multiplex RT-qPCR assay using the TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher
CN A47814) together with the TaqPath 1-step master mix – No ROX (Thermo Fisher CN A28523). To reduce
cost, RT-qPCR reactions were prepared at half the suggested reaction mix volume (7.5 µL instead of 15 µL).
10 µL of either saliva in TBE buffer or extracted RNA were used as templates for the RT-qPCR reaction. All
saliva samples used for pre-clinical studies were spiked with purified MS2 bacteriophage (1:40 MS2:sample)
as an internal control prior to analysis by RT-qPCR. For clinical samples, MS2 was added to the preparation
of the reaction mix (1µL MS2 per reaction). COVID-19 positive control RNA at 25 genomic copies/µL was used.
Negative control is UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Ambion CN 10977023). All RT-qPCR
reactions were performed in 0.2 mL 96-well reaction plates in a QuantStudio 3 system (Applied Biosciences).
The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was performed by serial dilution of γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (05.0x105 viral copies/mL) used to spike pooled fresh saliva samples. The RT-qPCR was run using the standard
mode, consisting of a hold stage at 25°C for 2 min, 53°C for 10 min, and 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles
of a PCR stage at 95°C for 3 sec then 60°C for 30 sec; with a 1.6°C/sec ramp up and ramp down rate.
In some experiments, the CDC-approved assay was used to validate our data using the TaqPath 1step mix (Thermo Fisher CN A15300). Primers and probes targeting the N1, N2, and RP genes were purchased
from Integrated DNA Technologies as listed: nCOV_N1 Forward Primer Aliquot (CN 10006830), nCOV_N1
Reverse Primer Aliquot (CN 10006831), nCOV_N1 Probe Aliquot (CN 10006832), nCOV_N2 Forward Primer
Aliquot (CN 10006833), nCOV_N2 Reverse Primer Aliquot (CN 10006834), nCOV_N2 Probe Aliquot (CN
10006835), RNase P Forward Primer Aliquot (CN 10006836), RNase P Reverse Primer Aliquot (CN
10006837), RNase P Probe Aliquot (CN 10006838). The 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (IDT CN 10006625)
was used as positive control at 50 copies/µL dilution.

Detergent optimization
γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (1.0x104 viral copies/mL) was spiked into fresh human saliva (SARS-CoV-2
negative) and combined 1:1 with Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer (TBE) at a final working concentration of 1X.

Samples were treated with varying concentrations of detergents (Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific), Tween 20
(Fisher Scientific), NP-40 (Fisher Scientific)) before or after heating at 95°C for 30 min. All saliva samples were
spiked with purified MS2 bacteriophage (1:40 MS2:sample) as an internal control prior to analysis by RT-qPCR
(Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit, QuantStudio 3).

Sample volume heat treatment optimization
γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (1.0x104 viral copies/mL; BEI) was spiked into fresh human saliva (SARSCoV-2 negative) and combined 1:1 with Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer (TBE) at a final working concentration of 1X.
The sample was distributed into either 50 mL conical (BD Falcon) or 1.5 mL microfuge tubes (Ambion), at
either 10% (5 mL in 50 mL conical, 150 µL in 1.5 ml microfuge), 5% (2.5 ml in 50 mL conical, 75 µL in 1.5 mL
microfuge), or 1% (0.5 mL in 50 mL conical, 15 µL in 1.5 mL microfuge) the vessel storage capacity. Samples
were incubated in a hot water bath at 95°C for 30 min. All saliva samples were spiked with purified MS2
bacteriophage (1:40 MS2:sample) as an internal control prior to analysis by RT-qPCR (Fisher TaqPath COVID19 Combo kit, QuantStudio 3).

Sample buffer additive optimization
γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (1.0x104 viral copies/mL) was spiked into fresh human saliva (SARS-CoV-2
negative) and combined 1:1 with Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer (TBE) at a final working concentration of 1X in 50
mL conical tubes (BD Falcon). Samples (1.0 mL in 50 mL conical tubes) were incubated in a hot water bath at
95°C for 30 min. Following heat treatment, virus-spiked saliva was aliquoted in 1.5 mL tubes and combined
with various RNA stabilizing agents to a final volume of 40 µL. Additives include RNaseI (1 U/µL), carrier RNA
(0.05 µg/mL), glycogen (1 µg/µL), TCEP/EDTA (1X), Proteinase K (5 µg/µL), RNase-free BSA (1.25 mg/ml),
RNAlater (1:1 ratio in place of TBE), or PBS-DTT (6.5 mM DTT in PBS, diluted 1:1 in place of TBE). All saliva

Saliva stability optimization
Pre-aliquoted γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 (1.0x104 viral copies/mL) was spiked into pre-aliquoted fresh
human saliva (SARS-CoV-2 negative) and combined with Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer (TBE), at a final working
concentration of 1X. Samples (0.5 mL in 50 mL conical tubes) were stored at 25°C (ambient temperature),
4°C, -20°C, or -80°C for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours. All saliva samples were spiked with purified MS2
bacteriophage (1:40 MS2:sample) as an internal control prior to analysis by RT-qPCR (Fisher TaqPath COVID19 Combo kit, QuantStudio 3).

Data analysis
Following completion of RT-qPCR, data were processed using QuantStudio Design and Analysis
Software (version 1.2). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were plotted as single replicate values on a scatter plot,
using GraphPad Prism 8 (version 8.4.2). Sensitivity, specificity, false positive, false negative, positive predictive
values, and negative predictive values were calculated using the current standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection
(NP swabs in VTM with RNA extraction) as confirmation of true disease positive and disease negative status.
