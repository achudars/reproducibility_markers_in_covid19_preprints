Abstract

18

RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to

19

preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The

20

Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be the major

21

inhibitor of interferon production in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2

22

ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with the host mRNA export factors Rae1 and

23

Nup98. Here, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 strongly represses protein

24

expression of co-transfected reporter constructs and imprisons host mRNA in the

25

nucleus, which is associated with its ability to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98. These

26

protein-protein interactions map to the C-terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a

27

single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter

28

expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. We further identify an ORF6 mutant

29

containing a 9-amino acid deletion, ORF6 ∆22-30, in multiple SARS-CoV-2 clinical

30

isolates that can still downregulate the expression of a co-transfected reporter and

31

interact with Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98.

32

However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and

33

results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV

34

ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and pre-symptomatic

35

transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

37

Importance

38

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is an RNA virus with a large genome

39

that encodes accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for

40

growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. One of SARS-CoV-

41

2’s accessory proteins, ORF6, was recently shown to co-purify with two host proteins,

42

Rae1 and Nup98, involved in mRNA nuclear export. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2

43

ORF6 interaction with these proteins is associated with reduced expression of a

44

reporter protein and accumulation of poly-A mRNA within the nucleus. SARS-CoV

45

ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2

46

ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and co-purifies with Rae1 and

47

Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 to more

48

strongly disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport than SARS-CoV ORF6 may partially

49

explain critical differences in clinical presentation between the two viruses.

Introduction
Control over host protein expression allows viruses to suppress the host’s

52

immune response and hijack the host’s translational machinery for expression of viral

53

proteins (1–3). Numerous viruses exert translational control by encoding proteins which

54

target nucleocytoplasmic transport, including the nuclear export of host mRNA (4, 5).

55

The host proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport are targets of multiple viruses

56

including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), poliovirus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated

57

herpesvirus (KSHV) (6–8).

58

Nup98 is a component of the nuclear pore complex and interacts with the RNA

59

export factor Rae1 to bind single stranded RNA and facilitate the translocation of mRNA

60

through the nuclear pore complex (9, 10). The matrix (M) protein of VSV interacts with

61

the Rae1•Nup98 complex at the nucleic acid binding site to prevent single stranded

62

RNA from binding Rae1•Nup98 (6, 11). As a result, mRNA remains trapped within the

63

nucleus and global gene expression within host cells is significantly reduced (6). A

64

single methionine residue surrounded by acidic residues within VSV M is critical for

65

interactions with Rae1 and mutations at this residue impair VSV M’s ability to block

66

mRNA nuclear export (11, 12). ORF10 of KSHV also interacts with Rae1•Nup98 to

67

reduce nuclear export of specific mRNA transcripts (8). Similar to VSV M, ORF10 of

68

KSHV contains a conserved methionine residue surrounded by acidic residues which is

69

likely the interacting motif for the Rae1•Nup98 complex (13).

70

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative

71

agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a single stranded RNA virus

72

belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus (14). With their large genomes, coronaviruses

73

including SARS-CoV-2 encode accessory proteins that are not required for viral

74

replication, but can contribute the virus’s pathogenicity (15). One of SARS-CoV-2’s

75

accessory proteins, ORF6, was recently shown to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98 in an

76

affinity purification mass spectrometry screen (13). Similar to VSV M and KSHV ORF10,

77

SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 contains a methionine in its C-terminus that is surrounded by acidic

78

residues, which may facilitate an interaction with the nucleic binding site of the

79

Rae1•Nup98 complex (13). The impact of the putative ORF6-Rae1-Nup98 interactions

80

on export of host mRNA and protein expression has yet to be determined.

81

In the closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-

82

CoV), ORF6 was shown to block nuclear import of STAT1 by binding the importin

83

karyopherin alpha 2 (16). SARS-CoV ORF6 has also been shown to downregulate

84

expression of co-transfected constructs (17). However, it is unclear if SARS-CoV ORF6

85

mediates this repression by restricting mRNA nuclear export via interactions with Rae1

86

or Nup98.

Results

89

Identification of a 9 amino acid deletion in ORF6 independently arising in multiple

90

clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates and a serially passaged cultured isolate

91

While sequencing clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates, we identified a unique isolate (WA-UW-

92

4752, MT798143) containing a 27-nucleotide, in-frame deletion within ORF6. The

93

isolate was derived from a nasopharyngeal swab (CT 26.1, Hologic Panther Fusion)

94

from an individual who presented to the emergency room after 8 days of fever, cough,

95

and myalgias and was on no specific COVID-19 therapy. The resulting ORF6 protein,

96

referred to as ORF6 ∆22-30, contains a 9-amino acid deletion towards the N-terminus of

97

ORF6 (Figure 1A). The deletion was confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing

98

(Figure 1B).

99

We searched for similar ORF6 deletions in over 67,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes

100

present in GISAID (accessed July 17, 2020) and identified 6 other clinical isolates

101

collected in Virginia, California, Belgium, and the United Kingdom that contained the

102

same ORF6 deletion (Table S1). Additionally, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 isolate with

103

an identical deletion that arose after six serial passages in cell culture (Table S1) (18).

104

Notably, the original clinical isolate used to infect the cells had an intact ORF6 (18). We

105

next performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1C) to determine the genetic

106

relatedness of the 8 strains. The strains differed by 2 – 20 single nucleotide variants and

107

belonged to 4 different lineages, A, A.1, B.1, and B.1.5, as defined by Pangolin

108

109

(https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) (19), suggesting the ORF6 ∆22-30 deletion
arose independently in multiple lineages.

110

111

ORF6 downregulates expression of a co-transfected mCherry reporter

112

ORF6 putatively interacts with the nuclear export factor Rae1 and the nuclear pore

113

complex component Nup98 (13). VSV M and KSHV ORF10, which both interact with

114

Rae1 and Nup98, downregulate expression of fluorescent or luminescent reporters

115

when co-transfected in cell culture by preventing nuclear export of reporter mRNA (6,

116

8). We generated a series of N-terminal GFP-tagged ORF6 constructs (Figure 2A) and

117

co-transfected 293T cells with these constructs and a reporter plasmid encoding

118

mCherry. Similar to VSV M, cells expressing the GFP-ORF6 construct showed a

119

significant reduction in mCherry expression (Mean Fluorescent Intensity [MFI]: 0.31;

120

Standard Error [SE]: 0.01; p = 0.01) relative to the cells transfected with GFP alone

121

(MFI: 1.0; SE: 0.09) (Figure 2B-C). Subsequent western blotting and densitometry

122

(Figure 2D-E) further confirmed mCherry expression was downregulated in cells

123

expressing wild-type (WT) ORF6.

124

125

ORF6 constructs containing deletions in the protein’s N-terminus, ORF6 ∆1-16
(MFI: 0.23, SE: 0.03) and the clinical isolate variant ORF6 ∆22-30 (MFI: 0.31; SE: 0.01),

126

displayed a 3- to 4-fold reduction in mCherry expression (Figure 2B-C) similar to WT

127

ORF6, indicating the N-terminus of ORF6 is not involved in downregulating protein

128

expression. In contrast, mCherry expression was only reduced 1.4- to 1.5-fold in the

129

130

presence of ORF6 constructs with deletions in the C-terminus, ORF6 ∆38-61 (MFI:
0.71; SE: 0.08) and ∆50-61 (MFI: 0.66; SE: 0.03) (Figure 2B-C).

131

In VSV M, a motif consisting of a methionine residue surrounded by acidic

132

residues is critical for reducing expression levels of co-transfected reporters. The

133

methionine residue within the motif is conserved between VSV M and KSHV ORF10

134

and a similar motif with a methionine residue is present in the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 C-

135

terminus (Figure 1A). We substituted this methionine residue in ORF6 to an alanine,

136

generating the construct ORF6 Met58Ala (Figure 2A). Transfection of ORF6 Met58Ala

137

did not downregulate mCherry expression (MFI: 1.08; SE: 0.09) (Figure 2B-C)

138

suggesting Met58 is critical for the function of ORF6.

mRNA accumulates in the nucleus in the presence of ORF6

141

We next investigated whether the reduced mCherry expression observed in the

142

presence of ORF6 was due to the impairment of mRNA nuclear export. We transfected

143

cells with either GFP, GFP-tagged WT ORF6, GFP-tagged ORF6 Met58Ala, or GFP-

144

tagged VSV M and stained the cells with an oligo dT(30) fluorescent probe to visualize

145

mRNA distribution within the transfected cells (Figure 3). In cells transfected with GFP

146

or ORF6 Met58Ala, mRNA was distributed throughout the cell indistinguishable from the

147

mRNA localization pattern in un-transfected cells. In contrast, mRNA in cells expressing

148

WT ORF6 and VSV M was present in multiple foci within the nucleus suggesting the

149

mRNA in these cells was accumulating in the nucleus. The mRNA localization patterns

150

are consistent with the reporter expression (Figure 2B-D) indicating that the

151

downregulation in reporter expression is due to impairment of mRNA nuclear export.

152

153

The C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interacts with Rae1 and Nup98

154

In VSV M and KSHV ORF10, downregulation of co-transfected fluorescent and

155

luminescent reporters and impairment of mRNA nuclear export occurs due to

156

interactions with the nuclear mRNA export factor Rae1 and nuclear pore complex

157

component Nup98 (6, 8). VSV M displaces single stranded RNA in the Rae1•Nup98

158

complex to prevent nuclear export of host mRNA (11). We hypothesized the inability of

159

the ORF6 C-terminal deletions to downregulate mCherry expression in a similar manner

160

as WT ORF6 (Figure 2B-E) was attributed to the loss of the interaction between these

161

ORF6 constructs and Rae1 and Nup98. We transfected 293T cells with GFP-tagged

162

ORF6 constructs (Figure 2A) and rapidly affinity purified the GFP-tagged proteins.

163

Western blotting on the elutes confirmed WT ORF6, along with ORF6 constructs with N-

165

terminal deletions, interacts with Rae1 and Nup98 (Figure 4). The C-terminal deletion
constructs, ORF6 ∆38-61 and ORF6 ∆50-61, did not pull down Rae1 or Nup98 (Figure

166

4). These data suggest the C-terminus of ORF6 interacts with Rae1 and Nup98, while

167

the N-terminus is not essential for the observed interactions. This is consistent with the

168

observation that C-terminal deletion mutants of ORF6 did not dramatically reduce

169

expression of the mCherry reporter (Figure 2B-E).
The methionine residue in the Rae1-Nup98 interacting motif of VSV M forms

170

171

multiple intermolecular interactions with amino acid residues in the nucleic acid binding

172

site of Rae1 and facilitates the interaction between VSV M and the Rae1•Nup98

173

complex (11). We hypothesized Met58 of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is similarly responsible

174

for interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. Affinity purification of ORF6 Met58Ala revealed it

175

does not interact with Rae1 or Nup98 (Figure 4), confirming the importance of Met58 in

176

the ORF6-Rae1 and ORF6-Nup98 interactions.

177

178

Overexpression of Rae1 restores mCherry reporter expression in cells transfected with

179

ORF6

180

We next investigated whether we could restore mCherry expression in 293T cells

181

transfected with ORF6 by overexpressing Rae1. Rae1 overexpression restored

182

mCherry expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A-B). Subsequent western

183

blotting and densitometry confirmed this Rae1 dose-dependent rescue of mCherry

184

expression (Figure 5C-D). These data indicate ORF6’s interaction with Rae1 is

185

responsible for downregulating mCherry reporter expression in cell culture.

187

SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to

188

SARS-CoV ORF6

189

We next compared the relative ability of SARS-CoV ORF6 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 to

190

downregulate reporter expression. SARS-CoV ORF6 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 share

191

69% identity by amino acid, including the same methionine residue surrounded by

192

acidic residues (Figure 6A). SARS-CoV ORF6 has been shown to downregulate

193

expression of a co-transfected construct in a dose-dependent manner (19), suggesting

194

its C-terminus may also interact with the Rae1•Nup98 complex.

195

We co-transfected 293T cells with GFP-tagged SARS-CoV ORF6 or GFP-tagged

196

SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 and mCherry to assess the impact of these constructs on protein

197

expression. Compared to cells transfected with GFP alone, cells transfected with SARS-

198

CoV ORF6 displayed reduced mCherry expression (MFI: 1; SE: 0.08 vs. MFI: 0.71, SE:

199

0.03), however this difference was not significant (p = 0.06) (Figure 6B-C). Cells

200

transfected with SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 displayed a significant reduction in mCherry

201

expression compared to cells transfected with SARS-CoV ORF6 (MFI: 0.3; SE: 0.02; p

202

= 0.001) (Figure 6B-C). Western blotting also demonstrated decreased expression of

203

SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 relative to SARS-CoV ORF6, suggesting expression levels do not

204

explain the differential effects on reporter gene expression (Figure 6D).

205

We hypothesized the differences in mCherry expression between SARS-CoV

206

ORF6 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 could be attributed to differences in co-purification of

207

Rae1 and Nup98. We transfected 293T cells with the GFP-tagged constructs and

208

affinity purified the tagged-proteins. Western blotting revealed SARS-CoV ORF6

209

interacts with Rae1 and Nup98 similar to SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 (Figure 6E). Densitometry

on the ratio of prey-to-bait demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 co-purified with 1.3-fold

211

more Rae1 (Figure 6F) and 3.8-fold more Nup98 (Figure 6G) compared to SARS-CoV

212

ORF6. These data suggest SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 may more dramatically repress protein

213

expression via a stronger interaction with the Rae1•Nup98 complex compared to SARS-

214

CoV ORF6.

215

216

Discussion

217

Here, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 downregulates protein expression and

218

entraps mRNA in the nucleus through interactions with the mRNA nuclear export factor

219

Rae1 and the nuclear pore complex component Nup98. We show reporter repression,

220

mRNA nuclear export, and the host-viral protein-protein interactions are critically

221

dependent on a methionine residue in the ORF6 C-terminus. Additionally, we

222

demonstrate an ORF6 allele with a 9-amino acid deletion which has arisen in multiple

223

clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates and a serially passaged culture isolate maintains the

224

ability to downregulate expression of co-transfected reporter and interact with Rae1 and

225

Nup98. Finally, we found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter

226

expression and more strongly copurifies with Rae1-Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV

227

ORF6.

228

RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, that replicate in the cytoplasm have

229

mechanisms to suppress cellular translation, which allows these viruses use the host’s

230

translational machinery to preferentially express viral proteins (1–3). In SARS-CoV,

231

ORF6 is not required for growth in vitro, however, expression of SARS-CoV ORF6 can

232

increase the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV and the related murine hepatitis virus in

233

vitro (20, 21). In addition, recombinant SARS-CoV isolates containing ORF6 grow to

234

higher viral loads than recombinant isolates lacking ORF6 (20). This enhancement in

235

viral growth could be attributed to SARS-CoV ORF6’s ability to downregulate cellular

236

protein expression through interactions with the Rae1•Nup98 complex. As SARS-CoV-2

237

ORF6 similarly interacts with Rae1 and Nup98, we speculate ORF6 is required for

238

optimal growth of SARS-CoV-2.

239

In addition to enhancing viral replication, preventing the nuclear export of mRNA

240

can suppress the host’s antiviral response (1–3). The ability of the M protein of VSV to

241

bind Rae1 and Nup98 and prevent mRNA nuclear export is associated with suppressed

242

interferon-ß gene expression (22). Furthermore, VSV strains containing a mutation at

243

the residue responsible for the VSV M-Rae1-Nup98 interactions induce significantly

244

higher interferon-α protein levels than strains containing wild-type alleles of the M

245

protein (23). SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 has been shown to be an interferon antagonist (24)

246

and likely downregulates interferon expression and host antiviral responses in a similar

247

manner to VSV M through its interaction with the Rae1•Nup98 complex.

248

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused several thousand-fold more infections than

249

SARS-CoV in part due to the distinct clinical presentations between the two viruses.

250

COVID-19 patients display peak viral loads and maximum infectivity upon the onset of

251

symptoms rather than after the onset of symptoms which is typical in patient with SARS

252

(25). Furthermore, asymptomatic transmission was infrequently reported for SARS-CoV

253

(26, 27), however, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission have been a

254

defining challenge of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (28–30). Both the delayed

255

onset of clinical symptoms and pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of

256

SARS-CoV-2 could be attributed to increased potency of interferon antagonization in

257

SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. ORF6 has already been shown to be a major

258

interferon antagonist in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (16, 24, 31). ORF6 is one of

259

the least similar accessory proteins (69% identical by amino acid) between the two

260

viruses. Coupled with our demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly

261

downregulating protein expression and co-purifying with more Rae1 and Nup98 than

262

SARS-CoV ORF6, the differences between SARS-CoV ORF6 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6

263

could explain at least some of the differences in clinical presentations between SARS

264

and COVID-19.

265

Large-scale SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance projects have demonstrated

266

deletions can arise within the accessory genes of SARS-CoV-2 (32–34). Notably, none

267

of these deletions have arisen in multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages through multiple

268

independent genomic rearrangement events. Our identification of 7 unrelated clinical

269

isolates with the same ORF6 deletion suggests this deletion may be repeatedly selected

270

for in SARS-CoV-2. This is further evidenced by the identification of a cultured SARS-

271

CoV-2 that acquired the same deletion after successive passages in Vero cells (18).

272

Similar to wild-type ORF6 allele, the clinical allele, ORF6 ∆22-30, can repress

273

expression of a co-transfected reporter and still retains the Rae1•Nup98 interacting

274

motif of ORF6. Further work is required to understand the functional role of the ORF6 N-

275

terminus and determine the selective pressures which are repeatedly selecting for the

276

observed deletion.

277

278

Our study has a number of limitations. We relied on cellular overexpression
systems of ORF6 which rely on nuclear export, making study of a likely nuclear export

279

inhibition factor difficult. As such, our results may not perfectly reflect the degree to

280

which host mRNA nuclear export and protein expression is downregulated during

281

SARS-CoV-2 infection, which does not rely on nuclear export for ORF6 expression.

282

More comparative work between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV ORF6 is needed in the

283

context of viral replication. It would be intriguing to swap ORF6 between SARS-CoV and

284

SARS-CoV-2 isolates to test the hypothesis that ORF6 is the major determinant of

285

interferon antagonization and delayed symptom onset in animal models of SARS-CoV-

286

2. Furthermore, additional work is required to understand the degree of mRNA export

287

inhibition in both viruses.

288

In summary, our results demonstrate the accessory protein ORF6 of SARS-CoV-

289

2 strongly inhibits reporter protein expression and imprisons mRNA in the nucleus via its

290

interactions with the mRNA nuclear export factor Rae1 and the nuclear pore complex

291

component Nup98. As ORF6 is a major interferon antagonist in Sarbecoviruses,

292

differences in ORF6 sequence content may be major determinants of differences in

293

clinical presentation among these viruses that so clearly have the world’s attention.

medium. RNA was extracted from 140 µL of medium using the Qiagen Biorobot.

303

Sequencing libraries were prepared as previously described (32). Briefly, RNA was

304

treated with TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher) and first-strand cDNA was synthesized

305

using Superscript IV (Thermo Fisher) and random hexamers (IDT). Double stranded

306

cDNA was created using Sequenase Version 2.0 (Thermo Fisher) and purified using

307

1.6x volumes of AMPure XP beads (Beckman-Coulter). Multiplex amplicon sequencing

308

libraries were constructed using Swift Biosciences’ SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Primer Pool

309

and Normalase Amplicon kit and sequenced on a 2 x 300 bp run on an Illumina MiSeq.

310

712,394 sequencing reads were obtained for the clinical SARS-CoV-2 sample,

311

WA-UW-4752. Sequencing reads were quality- and adapter-trimmed using

312

Trimmomatic v0.38 (ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE-SNAP.fa:2:30:10:1:true LEADING:3

313

TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:30 MINLEN:75) (39) and aligned to the SARS-CoV-2

314

reference genome (NC_045512.2) using BBMap version 38.70

315

(sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). Sequence reads were then clipped of synthetic PCR

316

primers using Primerclip (https://github.com/swiftbiosciences/primerclip) and the final

317

sequence alignment was visualized in Geneious version 11.1.4 (40).

318

The deletion identified within ORF6 of WA-UW-4752 was confirmed by reverse

319

transcription PCR and Sanger sequencing. For reverse transcription, single-stranded

320

cDNA was constructed using Superscript IV. The resulting cDNA was used as template

321

for PCR with Phusion High-Fidelity Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) and the following

322

primers: 5’ ATCACGAACGCTTTCTTATTAC 3’ and 5’ CTCGTATGTTCCAGAAGAGC

323

3’. PCR was conducted using the following conditions: 98ºC for 30 seconds followed by

324

35 cycles of 98ºC for 10 seconds, 55ºC for 15 seconds, and 72ºC for 30 seconds

followed by a final extension at 72ºC for 5 minutes. The resulting amplicons were run on

326

a 2% agarose gel, extracted from the gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen),

327

and Sanger sequenced by Genewiz, Inc. with the same primers used for PCR.

328

Other strains with the same deletion in ORF6 were identified by querying GISAID

329

(accessed July 17, 2020). The genetic relatedness of these strains was assessed by

330

aligning the genomes of these strains as well as 110 other global clinical SAR-CoV-2

331

strains using MAFFT v7.453 (41). A phylogenetic tree was generated using RAxML

332

version 8.2.11 (42) and visualized with R (version 3.6.1) using the ggtree package (43).

333

Strains were further classified using the web-based lineage assigner, Pangolin

334

(https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/) (19).

336

Cloning

337

The wild-type, N- and C-terminal mutant SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 constructs were amplified

338

from double-stranded cDNA from a previously sequenced clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate

339

(WA12-UW8; EPI_ISL_413563) using the primers listed in Table S2. CloneAmp Hi-Fi

340

PCR Premix (Takara) and the following PCR conditions were used to generate the

341

amplicons: 98ºC for 2 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 98ºC for 10 seconds, 55ºC for

342

15 seconds, and 72ºC for 30 seconds followed by a final extension for 72ºC for 5

343

minutes. ORF6 ∆22-30 was amplified from WA-UW-4572 (MT798143) and the matrix

344

protein from vesicular stomatitis virus was amplified from pVSV eGFP dG (a gift from

345

Connie Cepko; Addgene plasmid #31842) as described above using the primers listed

346

in Table S2. A gBlock gene fragment (IDT) for ORF6 of SARS-CoV was synthesized

347

based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV isolate TW1 (AY291451.1). The

348

resulting amplicons and gene fragment were then cloned into a modified pLenti CMV

349

GFP Puro plasmid (a gift from Eric Campeau & Paul Kaufman; Addgene plasmid

350

#17448), which contains a 3’ WPRE sequence following the insert and a 3’ SV40

351

polyadenylation signal after the puromycin resistance cassette, with an N-terminal GFP

352

tag using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Takara).

353

For cloning of Rae1, RNA was extracted from 239T cells using the RNeasy

354

Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using Superscript IV and oligo dT

355

(IDT). Rae1 was then amplified from the resulting cDNA using the primers listed in

356

Table S2 and CloneAmp Hi-Fi PCR Premix under the following PCR conditions: 98ºC

357

for 2 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 98ºC for 10 seconds, 55ºC for 15 seconds, and

358

72ºC for 1 minute followed by a final extension for 72ºC for 5 minutes. The resulting

359

amplicon was cloned into a modified pcDNA4-TO vector with a C-terminal FLAG tag

360

using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit.

362

Cell culture and ORF6-mCherry transient co-transfections

363

293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (GE Healthcare Life

364

Sciences) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1x HEPES (Thermo Fisher),

365

and 1x GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher) (293T media). Transient co-transfections with GFP-

366

tagged constructs and a modified pLenti CMV Puro vector encoding the fluorescent

367

reporter mCherry were conducted in 6-well plates. The day prior to transfection,

368

500,000 293T cells were plated into each well of the 6-well plate and grown overnight

369

until they reached approximately 50% confluency. The cells were then transfected with

370

2 µg of GFP-tagged construct and 2 µg of mCherry using a 3:1 ratio of PEI MAX

371

(Polysciences) in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher). Cells were incubated for 24-48 hours

372

following transfection and visualized using the EVOS M5000 Imaging System (Thermo

373

Fisher) with GFP and Texas Red filter cubes.

374

mCherry fluorescence intensities were measured with ImageJ v1.53a by an

375

individual blinded to experimental design. All images were 8-bit grayscale and

376

2048x1536 (3.1 megapixels). Background thresholds were set at the same level across

377

all images, and mean fluorescence intensity of regions of interest greater than 200

378

pixels calculated. Three fields were analyzed for each experimental condition. The

379

mean fluorescent intensity for each field was calculated after adjusting for background

380

fluorescence signal and normalized to the control condition. Difference in mean

381

fluorescent intensities between experimental conditions were assessed in R using the

382

unpaired t-test.

383

Cell lysates were collected 24-48 hours after transfection using RIPA buffer

384

(Thermo Fisher). The total protein content was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein

385

Assay kit (Thermo Fisher) and 7.5 µg of lysate was run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris sodium

386

dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel with MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen) under

387

reducing conditions. The samples were then transferred to a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose

membrane using the XCell Blot II module (Invitrogen). Blotting was performed using the

389

following primary antibodies: 1:1,000 anti-GFP (Cell Signaling; clone 4B10), 1:500 anti-

390

mCherry (Cell Signaling; clone E5D8F), and 1:1,000 anti-alpha Tubulin (Cell Signaling;

391

clone DM1A), which was followed by staining with either 1:10,000 IRDye 680RD anti-

Oligo dT in situ hybridization

397

293T cells were plated in 48-well plates at a density of 60,000 cells per well and grown

398

overnight to approximately 50% confluency. Cells were transfected with 200 ng of

399

plasmid DNA as described above and incubated for 24 hours. The cells were then

400

washed with PBS (pH 7.4; without Ca2+ or Mg2+) (Thermo Fisher) and fixed with 4%

401

paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were permeabilized with methanol and rehydrated in

402

70% ethanol followed by 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (Invitrogen). The monolayer was then

403

covered with hybridization buffer (1 mg/mL yeast tRNA, 0.005% bovine serum, 10%

404

dextran sulfate and 25% formamide in 2x SSC buffer) containing an oligo dT(30) probe

405

with an Alexa Fluor 594 fluorophore (IDT) attached to the 5’ end of the probe and

406

incubate overnight at 37ºC. The hybridization buffer was removed and the cells were

407

washed once with warmed 4x SSC buffer (Thermo Fisher), once with warmed 2x SSC

408

buffer, and twice with room temperature 2x SSC buffer.

409

The cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum in PBS containing 0.1%

410

Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 hour. To detect the GFP-tagged proteins, the cells were

411

incubated with a FITC conjugated anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) for 1 hour. The antibody

412

was removed and the cells were washed three times with PBST. Nuclear staining was

413

completed by incubating the cells in a 300 nM DAPI solution (Thermo Fisher) for 5

414

minutes. The cells were washed twice with PBS and visualized on an EVOS M5000 with

415

the GFP, Texas Red, and DAPI filter cubes.

Affinity Purification of GFP-tagged constructs

418

The day prior to transient transfection, 10-cm plates were seeded with 4x106 293T cells

419

and grown overnight to approximately 50% confluency. The cells were transfected with

420

7 µg of plasmid DNA using a 3:1 ratio of PEI MAX in Opti-MEM. Forty-four to 48 hours

421

after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and collected using PBS containing

422

0.1 mM EDTA. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 500 μL TEN (50mM Tris 8.0,

423

150mM NaCl, and 1mM EDTA) buffer with 0.5% NP-40, and lysed by rotation for 45-60

424

minutes at 4ºC. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4ºC and

425

the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and cleared of residual IgG by rotation

426

with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 30 minutes at

427

4ºC. Cleared lysates were transferred to new tubes and incubated overnight at 4ºC with

428

anti-GFP Nanobody Affinity gel (BioLegend). The affinity gel was then pelleted and

429

washed twice using TEN buffer with 0.1% NP-40 and resuspended in equal volumes of

430

NuPage LDS Sample Buffer (Thermo) containing 143 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-

431

Aldrich). Western blotting using the elutes from affinity purification and the pre-purified

432

input lysates were performed as described above with the following primary antibodies:

compared to SARS-CoV ORF6 in 293T cells. E) Affinity purification of GFP-tagged
constructs demonstrates both ORF6 of SARS-CoV and ORF6 of SARS-CoV-2
interact with Rae1 and Nup98. Densitometry shows SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 copurifies
with relatively more F) Rae1 and G) Nup98 compared SARS-CoV ORF6. * p < 0.05;
** p < 0.01. Scale bar: 100 µm.
