An early analysis of SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequencing data that combined epidemiological and
genetic data to characterize the transmission dynamics of the virus in and beyond Austria
concluded that the size of the virus’s transmission bottleneck was large – on the order of 1000
virions. We performed new computational analyses using these deep-sequenced samples
from Austria. Our analyses included characterization of transmission bottleneck sizes across
a range of variant calling thresholds and examination of patterns of shared low-frequency
variants between transmission pairs in cases where de novo genetic variation was present in
the recipient. From these analyses, among others, we found that SARS-CoV-2 transmission
bottlenecks are instead likely to be very tight, on the order of 1-3 virions. These findings have
important consequences for understanding how SARS-CoV-2 evolves between hosts and the
processes shaping genetic variation observed at the population level.
In their recent research article (1), Popa, Genger et al. combined epidemiological and viral genetic data to
characterize the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria between February and April 2020. The
genetic data they analyzed comprised >500 deep-sequenced virus samples. Beyond using consensus-level
SARS-CoV-2 sequences to infer transmission clusters within Austria and to examine the role that Austria
played in seeding regional epidemics elsewhere in Europe, the authors used their sequenced samples to
characterize mutational dynamics within hosts and along short transmission chains. While we believe that
the findings from their consensus-level genetic analysis are robust, we here revisit their analyses of
mutational dynamics at the below-the-consensus level. From our reanalysis, we conclude that transmission
bottleneck sizes are not on the order of 1000 virions as concluded by the authors, but instead much smaller.
Our decision to revisit Popa, Genger et al.’s conclusions on transmission bottleneck sizes stems from
curious patterns present in some of their figures. First, inferred bottleneck size estimates using a 3% variant
calling threshold were bimodal, with 14 of the 39 transmission pairs having an inferred bottleneck size (Nb)
of <10 and the remaining 25 pairs having Nb estimates of 115-5000 (their Figure S4G). Further, when a 1%
variant calling threshold was used, only a single transmission pair retained an Nb estimate of <10 (their

Figure 5B). In an attempt to understand these patterns, we first reanalyzed their deep sequencing data and
recalled variants using their pipeline (Supplementary Methods). In the analyses presented below, we use
these recalled variant frequencies, which appear to be highly similar to those presented in Popa, Genger et
al. based on the “tv plots” published as part of their article (10.5281/zenodo.4247401).
As expected, re-estimation of transmission bottleneck sizes at variant calling thresholds of 1% and 3%
yielded similar results to those shown in (1) (Figure S1A,B). During this analysis, we noticed that bottleneck
size estimates dropped, sometimes precipitously, when going from a 1% cutoff to a 3% cutoff for every one
of the 13 transmission pairs that had donors with a maximum iSNV frequency of >6% (Figure 1A; p =
0.004 using a paired t-test). Since increasing the variant calling threshold would remove low-frequency
iSNVs from analysis, these consistent decreases in Nb estimates could come about if low-frequency donor
iSNVs indicated that bottleneck sizes were large while high-frequency donor iSNVs instead indicated that
bottleneck sizes were small. Examination of low-frequency iSNVs across donor-recipient pairs indeed
indicate high levels of congruence between their frequencies (Figure 1B inset; Figures S2), which would
suggest wide transmission bottlenecks. In contrast, high-frequency donor iSNVs rarely appeared to be
transmitted to their corresponding recipient (Figures S2), suggesting narrow transmission bottlenecks.
To come to terms with these conflicting patterns, we considered genetic variation that appeared de novo in
recipient hosts. This genetic variation appears in the “tv plots” as iSNVs absent from a donor but present
in a corresponding recipient. When a de novo variant is observed as fixed in a recipient sample, we should
not observe any shared iSNVs between a donor and a recipient that are present in the recipient at subclonal
(i.e., not fixed) frequencies unless within-host recombination occurred extremely rapidly or the fixed de
novo variant arose multiple times in different genetic backgrounds. However, in the transmission pairs
analyzed in Popa, Genger et al., shared subclonal iSNVs – at extremely similar frequencies - are observed
in several transmission pairs where there is also a fixed de novo variant present in the recipient. The
transmission pair CoV_162  CoV_161 provides an example (Figure 1B). This means that the lowfrequency iSNVs shared between CoV_162 and CoV_161 are either spurious or that they arose
independently in the recipient (that is, they are homoplasies). In either case, these shared low-frequency
iSNVs are highly unlikely to constitute transmitted genetic variation, and as such would need to be excluded
from a transmission bottleneck analysis involving this transmission pair.
While we can only conclude that the low-frequency shared iSNVs in transmission pair CoV_162 
CoV_161 are almost certainly not shared between donor and recipient as a result of transmission,
transmission pairs with de novo fixed variants in the recipient (here, defined as >94% in frequency),
transmission pairs with de novo high-frequency (6-94%) variants in the recipient, and transmission pairs
with only low-frequency variants (<6%) in the recipient exhibit highly similar distributions of lowfrequency (1-6%) shared iSNVs (Figure 1C). The similarity between these distributions indicates that these
iSNVs may be subject to the same interpretation as for CoV_162  CoV_161. Indeed, when we calculate
the probability that a low-frequency donor iSNV is observed in a corresponding recipient (at ≥1%) versus
observed in an epidemiologically unlinked recipient, we find that the distribution of these probabilities are
highly similar (Figure 1D). It is thus highly unlikely that these shared low-frequency iSNVs are transmitted
to their corresponding recipient; if this were the case, we would expect the probability of shared variants to
be higher for the corresponding recipient compared to an epidemiologically unlinked one.
Given these findings that shed doubt on low-frequency iSNVs constituting transmitted genetic variation,
we decided to quantify the extent to which particular iSNVs were present across the samples used in the
transmission pair analyses. We found that 5 iSNVs were present in 40 or more of the 43 samples analyzed,
at frequencies that fell into a very narrow range (1%-2.2%) (Figure 1E). Many other iSNVs were also
present across numerous samples (Figure 1E; Figure S3, Figure S4), with the frequencies of any particular

iSNV being highly similar across the samples that it appears in. This similarity in iSNV frequencies argues
against these low-frequency iSNVs being homoplasies.
Finally, a comparison between observed patterns of iSNV frequencies between donors and recipients versus
those expected under large transmission bottleneck sizes as inferred in Popa, Genger et al. further argues
against the transmission of the low-frequency shared iSNVs. Specifically, observed iSNV frequencies from
transmission pairs with inferred bottleneck sizes of Nb ≥ 1000 show that iSNVs are present in both donor
and recipient at highly similar frequencies or are observed exclusively in the donor or recipient (Figure 1F).
On this figure, we overlay simulated iSNV frequencies under the assumption of a bottleneck size of Nb =
1000 (Supplemental Methods). Juxtaposition of the observed versus theoretically-predicted iSNV
frequencies highlights an inconsistency: at Nb values of ~1000, we should expect almost all (at least 96.1%)
of the iSNVs present in the donor at ≥2% to be transmitted and also observed above the variant calling
threshold of 1% in the recipient. However, only 77.5% of donor iSNVs within the 2-6% frequency range
are observed in the corresponding recipients at ≥1% frequency. This inconsistency indicates that the lowfrequency iSNVs themselves show patterns that cannot be parsimoniously explained by large transmission
bottleneck sizes.
Given these findings, we re-estimated transmission bottleneck sizes using the beta-binomial method (2) at
a conservative variant calling threshold of 6% (Figure 1A; Figure S1C). Increasing the variant calling
threshold does not bias bottleneck size estimates, but it is does increase statistical uncertainty in the
estimated values. At this 6% cutoff, only 13 transmission pairs had one or more donor iSNVs remaining,
such that bottleneck sizes could only be estimated for these pairs. The maximum likelihood estimate for Nb
was 1 for 12 out of these 13 transmission pairs; for the remaining transmission pair (CoV_198 
CoV_230), the maximum likelihood estimate was Nb = 143 virions. This transmission pair was the only
one where a donor iSNV (at a frequency of ~22%) was transmitted to a recipient but remained subclonal
(at a frequency of ~17%). Since the confidence intervals around these maximum likelihood estimates were
large, we also estimated an overall transmission bottleneck size using the data from these 13 transmission
pairs (Supplemental Methods). We arrived at an estimate of a mean bottleneck size of 1.21, such that 99%
of successful transmissions are expected to result from 3 or fewer virions (Figure 2).
Our finding of a very tight transmission bottleneck from a reanalysis of the viral deep-sequencing data from
Popa, Genger et al. is consistent with conclusions from other (as yet not peer-reviewed) studies that have
quantified SARS-CoV-2 transmission bottleneck sizes in humans (3) and other mammals (4). These results
indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a narrow transmission bottleneck, similar in size to that of influenza A
viruses (5). Small bottleneck sizes also mean that infections generally start off with very little – if any –
viral genetic diversity, such that acute infections will likely be characterized by low levels of viral diversity
except in instances of superinfection, consistent with other recent (as yet not peer-reviewed) studies (6, 7).
Our reanalysis thus parsimoniously adds to a growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution between
and within infected individuals.

0.97]), and 6% ([0.06, 0.94]). Estimates are based on all iSNVs that pass the quality filtering thresholds.
Maximum likelihood estimates are indicated by a colored circle and vertical lines show 95% confidence
intervals. Estimates are plotted according to the maximum iSNV frequency observed in the donor of the
transmission pair. Estimates from the same transmission pair are offset slightly on the x-axis to aid in
visualization. iSNV frequencies (referred to in the figures as ‘AF’ for allele frequencies) are based on
variant calling relative to donor-specific reference sequences. Transmission bottleneck sizes quantify the
number of virions transmitted from donor to recipient that successfully establish infection. B) All iSNVs
observed in either the donor and/or the recipient of the epidemiologically confirmed CoV_162  CoV_161
transmission pair. Donor iSNV frequency is shown on the x-axis and recipient iSNV frequency is shown
on the y-axis. Note the de novo variant in the recipient (C26894U) that is fixed within individual 161 and
absent from individual 162. Inset highlights low-frequency iSNVs. Red-dotted lines show the 1% variant
calling threshold. iSNV frequencies are based on variant calling relative to donor-specific reference
sequences. Here, all iSNVs that pass quality filtering thresholds are shown, regardless of whether they fall
above or below the 1% variant calling threshold. C) Gaussian kernel density estimates of low-frequency
([0.01, 0.06]) iSNVs present in the donor that are also shared with the recipient. Lines are colored by the
maximum de novo iSNV frequency in the recipient. iSNV frequencies are based on variant calling relative
to donor-specific reference sequence. D) Probability that a given iSNV present in a donor is shared with a
recipient host. Blue dots show probabilities for epidemiology linked pairs while black dots show
probabilities for random, epidemiologically unlinked donor-recipient pairs. Random pairs are generated
such that the random recipient is not a member of the same family as the focal donor or recipient and is not
a known recipient of that donor sample. iSNVs are binned based on their frequency in the donor: [0.01,
0.02), [0.02, 0.03), [0.03, 0.06). Allele frequencies are based on variant calling relative to Wuhan/Hu-1.
Differences between the epidemiologically-linked and –unlinked probability distributions were assessed
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This test failed to find significant differences between these
distributions in the 1-2% donor frequency group (p = 0.389), in the 2-3% donor frequency group (p =
0.752), and in the 3-6% frequency group (p >0.999). E) Top 12 most abundantly shared iSNVs amongst
the 43 samples involved in the 39 transmission pairs. iSNVs are ordered by the number of samples in which
they were found. Each dot represents the allele frequency of that iSNV in a given sample. Red-dotted line
shows the 1% variant calling threshold. Allele frequencies are based on variant calling relative to
Wuhan/Hu-1. F) Patterns of shared viral genetic diversity between transmission pairs with a large
bottleneck. Block dots show all iSNVs observed in either the donor and/or recipient for all transmission
pairs with an estimated bottleneck size of ≥1000 at a variant calling threshold of 1%. Allele frequencies are
based on variant calling relative to donor-specific reference sequence. Red dots represent simulated data
assuming a transmission bottleneck of 1000.

variant-calling threshold of 6% and data from all 13 transmission pairs with one or more iSNV above this

exceeds 99%.
