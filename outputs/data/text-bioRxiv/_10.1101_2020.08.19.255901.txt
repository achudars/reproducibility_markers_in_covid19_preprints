ABSTRACT
Understanding and eliciting protective immune responses to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an urgent priority. To facilitate these objectives, we
have profiled the repertoire of human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II)-bound peptides
presented by HLA-DR diverse monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 spike
(S) protein. We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested
sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the
glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides revealed
substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely introduced during antigen
processing. Our data also highlight the receptor-binding motif in S1 as a HLA-DR-binding
peptide-rich region. Results from this study have application in vaccine design, and will aid
analysis of CD4+ T cell responses in infected individuals and vaccine recipients.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel beta-coronavirus
that first emerged as a human pathogen in the Hubei province of China in late 2019, and is
the aetiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although SARS-CoV-2 infection
is frequently asymptomatic or results in only mild illness, ~20% of symptomatically infected
individuals progress to develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
and/or sepsis, which can be fatal. By the 24th of July 2020 15,296,926 cases and 628,903
deaths had been reported worldwide1. The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and resulting
pandemic have placed tremendous pressure on healthcare services, had a huge societal
impact, and profoundly damaged the global economy, prompting an urgent need for vaccines
to prevent further spread of infection and avert disease development1.
Immune correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression to severe
disease are not yet well-understood, although infection was found to induce at least-shortterm protective immunity in a SARS-CoV-2 non-human primate (NHP) infection model,
indicating that immune responses are capable of mediating protection2. Passively transferred
neutralising antibodies (nAbs) protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in small animal models,
and convalescent sera has been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe disease,
suggesting the utility of nAb induction by vaccines3,4,5. Notably, the four seasonal common
cold-causing human coronaviruses and the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) and SARS coronaviruses typically elicit poorly-sustained nAb responses, putatively
enabling subsequent re-infection6. However, somewhat more durable T cell responses are
induced, which in animal models can prevent development of severe disease on challenge,
providing a rationale for vaccine-mediated induction of T cell as well as nAb responses7,8,9,10.

More than 150 candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are now in preclinical development or clinical
trials11.
The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein (comprised of S1 and S2 subunits) is the primary target
of vaccine development efforts. Homotrimers of the transmembrane S protein on the virion
surface mediate virion attachment and entry into host cells, making S a key target for nAbs12.
S is also highly immunogenic for T cells, with many studies suggesting that although infected
individuals mount CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to epitopes throughout the viral proteome,
S is often at the top of the antigenic hierarchy13,14,15. The relative roles of CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells in disease control or pathogenesis and impact of their protein and epitope specificity are
unknown; but given the importance of CD4+ T cells (particularly CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh)
cells) in providing help for antibody responses16, and the correlation of memory B cell/nAb
responses to S with circulating CD4+ Tfh responses in recovered COVID patients17, induction
of potent Tfh cell responses to the S protein is likely to be crucial for the success of nAbinducing vaccines.
CD4+ T cells are initially activated in response to recognition of specific peptides presented
with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules on professional antigen
presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs)18. The human MHC-II region encodes
polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRA/DRB1, -DRA/DRB3, -DRA/DRB4, DRA/DRB5, -DPA1/DPB1 and -DQA1/DQB1 molecules, with HLA-DRA/DRB1 being expressed
at the highest and HLA-DQA1/DQB1 at the lowest levels19,20. HLA-II polymorphisms dictate
the repertoire of peptides presented for CD4+ T cell recognition and shape the response
elicited, which can influence the outcome of infection or vaccination21. Here, we defined
SARS-CoV-2 S-derived peptides presented with diverse HLA-II alleles on DCs to facilitate

analysis of pre-existing, post-infection or vaccine-elicited S-specific CD4+ T(fh) cell responses
and their roles in protection, pathogenesis and prevention of re-infection.

RESULTS
Approach for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S HLA-II presentation by monocyte-derived DCs
(MDDCs)
To identify peptides in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with potential for targeting by CD4+ T cell
responses, a mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome profiling approach was employed
to define peptides presented by HLA-II on DCs, antigen presenting cells that play a key role in
in vivo CD4+ T cell priming (Figure 1A). MDDCs were generated from 5 HLA-DRB1heterozygous donors, selected to enable profiling of peptides presented with a total of 9
different HLA-DRB1 alleles (Table 1); these donors also expressed 7 distinct HLA-DPB1 alleles.
MDDCs from each donor were pulsed with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein vaccine
immunogen candidate22 (produced in a mammalian cell expression system, Figure S2) or a
recombinant viral glycoprotein from an unrelated virus that had been produced in the same
way (to provide a negative control dataset), and incubated for 18 hours to allow antigen
uptake, processing and presentation. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that, as anticipated,
the CD11c+ MDDC population had robust expression of HLA-I and HLA-DR, expressed high
levels of the lectin-type receptors DC-SIGN and DEC-205 and had a relatively immature
phenotype, expressing low levels of the DC maturation marker CD83 and moderate levels of
the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. Notably, no difference was observed in
the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and control protein-pulsed MDDCs, indicating that
the S protein had not altered the DC maturation state or HLA expression levels (Figure 1B,
Figure S1).

Immunopeptidomic profiling of HLA-II-associated peptides presented by MDDCs
Protein-pulsed MDDCs were lysed and sequential immunoprecipitations performed with a
pan-HLA-I-specific antibody (W6/32) for depletion of HLA-I complexes, followed by serial panHLA-DR (L243) and pan-HLA-DP (B721) immunoprecipitations for enrichment of HLA-DR- and
HLA-DP-peptide complexes. After peptide elution and sequencing by tandem mass
spectrometry, a total of 27,081 unique HLA-DR- and 2,801 HLA-DP-associated peptide
sequences were identified at 1% FDR, of which 147 (HLA-DR) and 12 (HLA-DP) mapped to the
S protein (Figure 2A-D, Table S1). None of these peptides were identified in the control
protein-pulsed MDDC samples (not shown), consistent with derivation from the S protein
antigen. The total number of identified peptides varied in each donor, and was influenced by
starting cell numbers (Figure 2A-E). The overall peptide length distributions were highly
characteristic of HLA-II-associated peptides, with a median amino acid length of 15 for both
human and S peptides (Figure 2F,G). As the HLA-DRA chain is invariant, differences in the
peptide binding repertoires of HLA-DR heterodimers are dependent on the HLA-DRB allele
expressed. Binding predictions (performed using NetMHCIIpan 4.0) suggested that 60-80% of
the peptide sequences identified in the HLA-DR immunopeptidome had a high predicted
binding affinity for the donor-specific HLA-DRA/B1 alleles23 (Figure 2H). When stratified by
HLA-DRB1 allele, ~80% of peptides were predicted to bind just 1 allele in donors C2, C460 and
C459, whilst for donors C491 and C493, peptides were more equally distributed between both
HLA-DRB1 alleles (Figure 2I). This was further reflected in an unsupervised Gibbs clustering
analysis, which revealed the distinct sequence motifs characteristic of at least one of the
donor's HLA-DRB1 alleles (Figure 2J). Prior to purifying class II complexes, we also purified
HLA-I ligands and identified 29,309 self-peptides. There was no evidence of MDDC HLA-I
cross-presentation of the pulsed S protein (data not shown).

Multiple regions of S are presented by HLA-DR in a genotype-dependent manner
Characteristic of HLA-II-bound peptides, many of the S peptides formed distinctive nested
sets around a common core. Two of the identified peptides originated from regions that were
altered to assist recombinant protein expression and purification (Figure S2C). The location
of the identified S peptides in the context of protein region and domain structure and relative
frequency with which particular sites are presented in each donor is summarised in Figure 3A.
Several “hotspots” from which a large number of unique peptides (typically different
members of a nested set) are presented in multiple donors are apparent across the length of
the full S protein, and two regions of S, spanning amino acids 24-49 and 457-485, particularly
stand out as the sites from which the highest number of unique HLA-II-bound peptides were
derived.
To explore the contribution of individual HLA-DR alleles to presentation of the S protein, we
investigated the likely allele to which each peptide was bound using HLA-II binding prediction
(NetMHCIIpan 4.0) (Figure 3B,C). 75-100% of the HLA-DR-bound S peptide sequences
identified in each donor were predicted to bind one or more of the donor’s HLA-DRB1 alleles
(Figure S3A). This stratification demonstrated a within-patient allele usage bias in S
presentation that in most donors mirrored the previously observed bias in the percentage of
all peptides presented by individual alleles (Figure 3B and Figure 2I). For example, in donor
C493 each HLA-DR allele (DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*03:01) had a similar propensity to present
both self and S peptides, whilst the majority of peptides were presented with the DRB1*04:01
allele in donor C459 (DRB1*02:01 and DRB1*04:01) and C460 (DRB1*04:01 and DRB1*12:01)
MDDCs. A strong correlation was observed between the DRB1*04:01-presented peptide
profile of donors C460 and C459, who both expressed the DRB1*04:01 allele (R=0.98), and

both donors shared by far the largest number of identical peptide sequences (23) found in
any pairwise comparison (Figures S3B,C and S4).
HLA-II-bound S peptides with N-linked glycosylation predominantly bear truncated
paucimannose glycans
To determine the glycosylation status of the S protein immunogen used in this study, a
proteomic approach was used to map the N-linked glycosylation sites, involving in vitro
digestion of the recombinant S protein, trimming of glycans from the generated peptides with
PNGaseF in the presence of heavy water (H218O), and peptide characterisation by mass
spectrometry24. This analysis revealed that the 22 N-linked glycosylation sites previously
described in S25 were occupied in the S protein employed here (Table S2). Notably, regions of
the S protein containing glycosites were devoid of peptides identified in our initial analysis of
the HLA-II-bound peptidome, raising the question of whether S-derived glycopeptides were
also presented by MDDCs (Figure 3A).
To enable glycopeptide analysis, non-PNGaseF-treated S digests were analysed using a wellestablished glycoproteomics strategy26. Using this approach, glycopeptides at 19 sites of S
were identified to carry oligomannosidic and complex/hybrid-type N-glycans (Figure 4A,
Table S3). Most sites displayed extensive glycan microheterogeneity arising from differences
in both glycan types and structural features including terminal sialylation and fucosylation in
agreement with the known site-specific glycosylation of S25.
Next, we applied the site-specific glycopeptide methodology to the mass spectra acquired
from samples eluted from HLA-II (Figure 4B). 80 distinct glycopeptide forms mapping to S
were identified, the majority of these (76) were derived from the HLA-DR-bound
immunopeptidome (Table S4). These glycopeptide forms mapped to 52 unique peptide
sequences that typically formed nested sets, were predominantly observed in datasets

generated from donors C459 and C460 (where the highest number of unique HLA-DR-bound
non-glycosylated peptides were also detected), and had a similar length distribution to Sderived non-glycopeptides (Figure 4C,D). 66% (20-100%) of all glycopeptide sequences were
predicted (using NetMHCIIpan 4.0) to bind to one or more of the donor’s HLA-DR alleles
(Figure 4C). The largest nested set consisted of glycopeptides from donor C459/C460 MDDCs
that mapped to position N801 located directly in the fusion peptide (FP, 788-806), a highly
conserved region which facilitates membrane fusion during viral entry (Figure 4E,F). In total,
we identified HLA-II-bound glycopeptides bearing glycans derived from 14 of the N-linked
glycosylation sites in S (Figure 4F). HLA-II-bound peptides carried predominantly short
paucimannosidic-type N-glycans while S carried oligomannosidic- and GlcNAc-capped
complex-type N-glycan structures at these sites (Figure 4B,F). The paucimannosylation of the
HLA-II bound peptides comprised both core-fucosylated (M1F, M2F, and M3F i.e. Man13GlcNAc2Fuc1)

and a fucosylated (M2, Man2GlcNAc2) species as supported by fragment

spectra analysis (Figure 4E).
In addition, utilising an open post translational modification (PTM) peptide identification
methodology, we identified peptides containing the other most common post translational
modifications (other than glycans) in the S immunopeptidome (Figure S5A). The most
modified residue was cysteine (C), which was found to have undergone cysteinylation,
oxidation to cysteic acid and conversion to glutathione disulphide (Figure S5B). A total of 27
peptides with modified C residues were identified that mapped to 6 positions in S. All peptides
contained a single modified C residue and are known to form disulphides in the tertiary
structure of S27.
Peptides derived from the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are
presented by multiple HLA-DR alleles

Altogether, a total of 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptides (differing in amino acid sequence)
derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected in this study. The locations and
putative presenting HLA-II alleles of these peptides (typically members of large nested sets)
are summarised in Figure 5. Partly overlapping nested sets of peptides predicted to be
presented by distinct HLA-DR alleles in different donors were identified in several regions of
the spike protein. One region in the RBD particularly stood out in this regard, as it contained
5 nested sets of peptides and an additional peptide that were predicted to be presented by 6
different HLA-DR alleles. At least one peptide within this region was found to be presented in
every donor studied (Figure 5, Figure 6A). In the donors analysed, a total of 21 unique peptide
sequences derived from this region were identified altogether (Figure 6A,B) and versions of
some of these post-translationally-modified at residues C480 and C432 also detected (Figure
6C). This region overlapped directly with the receptor binding motif (RBM), an extended insert
on the beta-6/5 strands that contains the contact points with the receptor ACE228.
To gain insight into the sequence conservation of this region in other coronaviruses infecting
humans, S protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (the other betacoronaviruses that have caused epidemics in humans in the past two decades) and the
endemic human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 were aligned (Figure 6D).
Although this region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed some sequence similarity with the
equivalent region of the SARS-CoV S protein, this is an indel-rich region of S that was much
less well conserved in the other coronaviruses examined. However, although residues that
are likely to constitute key anchors in the core regions of the nested peptide sets predicted
to bind to particular HLA-DRA/DRB1 molecules (SARS-CoV-2 F464 and S469, which match
anchor residue preferences in DRB1*04:01-, 07:01-, 13:03- and 15:01-binding peptides; F464
and D467, which match preferred anchors of DRB1*03:01-binding peptides; and I472 and

S477, which match those of DRB1*01:01-binding peptides) are not well conserved or not
appropriately positioned relative to one another in all coronaviruses, there appears to be
some potential for HLA-II-binding peptides to be generated from this region of other human
coronavirus S protein sequences.

DISCUSSION
Concurrently with the design and clinical evaluation of candidate immunogens in the race to
develop vaccines with prophylactic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated
disease, there is an urgent need to define T cell epitopes to facilitate analysis of the
contribution of T cell responses to protection and pathogenesis in infected individuals and
monitoring of immune responses elicited in human vaccine trials14. As the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein is the major target on the virus for neutralising antibodies29,3,4,30,5,31, 32, 33 and has also
been shown to be highly immunogenic for T cell responses in infected individuals13,14,15, 34, a
high proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in pre-clinical and clinical development focus on
eliciting immune responses to this protein. In this study, we have defined SARS-CoV-2 Sderived peptides presented by DCs (a cell type crucial for induction of immune responses
during infection and after vaccination21), following uptake and processing of exogenouslyacquired S protein. We identify a total of 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences,
including members of 27 nested peptide sets, demonstrating presentation of both
glycopeptides and peptides with other post-translational modifications. Notably, our analysis
reveals that nested peptide sets derived from a region of the RBD that overlaps with the RBM
are presented by diverse HLA-DR alleles, highlighting this as a region of the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein that could putatively be targeted by T cell responses in multiple individuals. The
peptides identified in this study provide an important resource that will expedite 1)

exploration of pre-existing T cell responses to other coronaviruses, 2) cross-comparison of
responses elicited by different vaccine immunogens and platforms, and 3) design of nextgeneration vaccines tailored to elicit enhance responses to nAb epitopes, or focus T cell
responses on selected epitopes.
The importance of defining SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides presented by diverse HLA alleles is
illustrated by the plethora of recent efforts to employ in silico approaches to predict putative
T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins35 36. Our data give key insight into the repertoire of
peptides that are in fact presented with HLA-II when exogenous S protein is internalised and
processed by DCs, mimicking a scenario occurring as T cell responses are induced during
natural infection or following vaccination with protein immunogens. Whether these peptide
profiles are also representative of those presented on DCs in which the S proteins is
endogenously-expressed (e.g. as may occur following antigen delivery with viral vectored or
nucleic acid-based vaccine platforms), which may lead to antigen processing and peptide
association with HLA-II in different intracellular compartments, remains to be determined18.
Furthermore, although no evidence of in vitro cross-presentation of S on HLA-I by MDDCs was
observed in this study, vaccine platforms that drive intracellular antigen expression would be
expected to result in HLA-I presentation of S-derived peptides, promoting induction of CD8+
T cell responses37,38.
Our analysis of naturally presented HLA-II-associated peptides from SARS-CoV-2 S protein
identified a total of 209 unique HLA-II bound peptides in the 5 donors analysed, including 193
HLA-DR-bound and a further 16 HLA-DP-bound peptides. ~75% of the HLA-DR bound peptides
identified were predicted to bind to at least one of the donor’s HLA-DRB1 alleles, consistent
with the higher expression and more dominant antigen presenting role of HLA-DRB1 versus
HLA-DRB3, 4 and 5 molecules17. Whilst HLA-II binding predictions suggested that the two HLA12

DRB1 alleles expressed in some donors made roughly equal contributions to the repertoire of
unique peptides presented, in other donors a much greater proportion of the unique peptides
detected were predicted to bind to one of their HLA-DRB1 alleles, with DRB1*04:01, a
prevalent allele in European populations, appearing to play a more dominant role in antigen
presentation in both of the donors expressing this allele. The depth of immunopeptidome
profiling achieved for different HLA-DR alleles could be influenced by protein expression
levels, but certain alleles may also present a more diverse repertoire of peptides due to a
preference for more common amino acids and/or ability to tolerate a greater number of
different amino acid residues at key anchor positions, and/or to differences in their
association with the peptide editor HLA-DM or the associated HLA-DO protein that modulates
its function18.
Our analysis identified multiple S-derived peptides in the HLA-II bound repertoire bearing
glycans or other post-translational modifications. Viral envelope proteins are often heavily
glycosylated and the SARS-CoV2 S protein is no exception39, with complex N-glycosylation
stemming from 22 sites25. Glycosylation of virion surface proteins acts to enhance viral
infectivity and also subvert recognitions by host adaptive responses (by shielding nAb binding
sites and impairing antigen processing for T cell recognition); but it is also targeted by host
innate immune recognition pathways40. S protein glycosylation is carried out by the host cell
glycan processing machinery, resulting in attachment of a range of oligomannosidic, complex
or hybrid structures that mimic mature surface glycoproteins of the host. We initially
confirmed that these patterns were present in the intact S protein used to pulse MDDCs.
Strikingly, we found that the HLA-II-bound S peptides were in contrast glycosylated at the
same site but with glycans rich in highly processed paucimannosidic-type structures. This
observation implies a significant modulation of the glycan phenotype upon internalisation,

processing, and presentation of the S glycoprotein in MDDCs. Paucimannosidic glycans are
defined as truncated α- or β-mannosyl-terminating N-glycans carried by proteins expressed
widely across the eukaryotic domain, but remains a poorly understood glycan class in human
glycobiology and virology41. We have recently reported that neutrophils42,

43

and

monocytes/macrophages44, but thus far not DCs, are paucimannose producing cell types in
the innate immune system. The paucimannosidic glycans have been proposed to be formed
via the sequential trimming facilitated by the N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase isoenzymes and
linkage-specific α-mannosidases residing in lysosomes or lysosomal-like compartments41.
Supporting our data suggesting an extensive DC-driven glycan remodelling ahead of viral
glycopeptide presentation, N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase and α-mannosidase, and several
other hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. cathepsin D) are known to be abundantly expressed and highly
active in MHC class II processing compartments (MIICs)45. Furthermore, MHC class II
immunopeptides carrying truncated N-glycans have previously been reported from other
cellular origins46,47. CD4+ T cell recognition of glycosylated peptides has been reported in
rheumatoid arthritis (O-linked)48 and cancer (N-linked)49, and CD4+ peptides in the melanoma
antigen tyrosinase require the presence of N-linked glycosylation to elicit a T cell response49.
A recent study also showed that immunization of mice with a recombinant human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) glycoprotein immunogen elicits CD4+
T cell responses to a glycopeptide epitope that provide help for induction of Env-specific
antibody responses50, suggesting that glycopeptide-targeting CD4+ T cell responses may
constitute an important and under-studied component of the immune response elicited
following infection or vaccination.
Further investigation of post-translational modifications in HLA-II bound S peptides revealed

cysteic acid). Specifically, we observed cysteinylation and glutathionylation of C479 and C432,
a cysteine pair that form two key disulphide bonds in the RBD28. Free cysteines are highly
reactive and during denaturation can readily become oxidised depending on the surrounding
environment51. The origin of cysteinylation and glutathionylation in HLA-II peptides is
uncertain, and reactions could occur within the endosome or extracellular medium with free
cysteine or glutathione, depending on where the peptides are loaded onto MHC molecules52,.
The existence of cysteine-modified viral epitopes has been explored previously for both class
I53,54 and class II55 epitopes and their presentation in the immunopeptidome is allele- and
context-dependent51. Biologically, cysteine modifications potentially reflect the redox status
of the cell51 and can alter T cell recognition of antigens in infection, vaccination and cancer52,
53, 54, 55. In agreement with our observations for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, a CD8+ T cell epitope

derived from the RBD (312-635) of the S glycoprotein following infection of mice with mouse
hepatitis virus (murine coronavirus), in was found to be S-glutathionylated51. In cancer,
cysteinylation of antigens can confer evasion from T cell recognition; but processing by the
IFNy-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) can remove antigen cysteinylation and induce
antigen processing and T cell responses in the context of melanoma56. In an antigen
presenting cell loading system similar to that used here, a requirement for peptide
endocytosis and processing of a spontaneously cysteinylated peptide was required to
establish T cell activation but not MHC binding and presentation55. Thus it will be important
to determine whether the cysteine-modified S peptides described herein are targeted by T
cells following vaccination or during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Notably, the RBM, an area of the RBD important for interacting with the host receptor ACE228,
was found to be a HLA-DR-binding peptide-rich region, with presentation of peptides derived
from amino acids 457-485 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein being detected in all of the HLA15

diverse donors studied. Analysis of the T cell responses elicited following vaccination of mice
with recombinant DNA (rDNA) based vectors encoding the S proteins from both SARS and
SARS-CoV-2 has shown that the epitopes targeted by CD4+ T cells include a site in the RBD
that encompasses the RBM57,58, suggesting that peptides derived from this region may be
presented in a cross-species manner. Little information is currently available about the
epitopes recognised by CD4+ T(fh) cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected or vaccinated
individuals, although CD4 T cell responses to an epitope at amino acids 449-461 in the SARSCoV spike (equivalent to, although having a number of sequence differences from amino acids
462-474 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) were detected in healthy donors not exposed to
SARS-CoV (or SARS-CoV-2)36; and a recent analysis of T cell responses in recovered SARS-CoV2 infected patients detected a response two overlapping peptides spanning amino acids 446465 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein59. More work is needed to determine how commonly
this region is recognised by CD4+ T cell responses, both in individuals exposed only to seasonal
human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 individuals, and also to explore the inter-virus crossreactivity of RBM-targeting CD4+ T cells; but our findings highlight this as a putatively
immunogenic region worthy of further study.
In summary, our data provide a detailed map of HLA-II-binding peptides in the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein that will facilitate the analysis of CD4+ T cell responses to both “conventional” and
novel post-translationally-modified epitopes in this important viral target protein. In addition
to the utility of our findings in dissection of pre-existing and post-infection responses to the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein and their impact on infection outcome, our results also have application
in the monitoring of vaccine-elicited immune responses and cross-comparison of the CD4
T(fh) responses elicited by different immunogens, vaccine platforms and immunization
regimes. Furthermore, they have important implications for the design of vaccines aiming to

target immune responses to specific sites on the S glycoprotein, e.g. indicating the potential
for RBD vaccines to elicit CD4+ T(fh) responses in HLA-diverse vaccine recipients, and
highlighting regions of the spike protein that may be poor sources of class II epitopes, where
linkage to exogenous CD4+ T(fh) epitopes such as broadly-presented peptides from tetanus
toxoid may be advantageous in future vaccine design.

METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Leukocyte cones obtained with appropriate ethical approval from healthy donors who
provided written informed consent were purchased from the NHS Blood and Transplant
Service, Oxford. All work was compliant with institutional guidelines. Mononuclear cells
were isolated from leukocyte cones by separation on a Histopaque-1077 gradient then
stored in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using the QIAamp DNA
Mini Kit (QIAGEN), then the HLA-DRB1, -DPB1, and -DQB1 loci were sequenced at the OUH
Transplant Laboratory by Sanger sequencing using an ABI-3730 DNA analyzer.
Protein expression and purification
The SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain constructs were produced and purified as described previously
22 60.

Briefly, the expression construct included residues 1−1208 of the SARS-CoV-2 S

(GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a “GSAS”
substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin
trimerization motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag.
Expression plasmids encoding the ectodomain sequence were used to transiently transfect
FreeStyle293F cells using Turbo293 (SpeedBiosystems). Protein was purified on the sixth day

post transfection from the filtered supernatant using StrepTactin resin (IBA), followed by
size exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column.
Differentiation of monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs)
To differentiate MDDCs, mononuclear cells were thawed and plated at 106 cells per cm2 in
20 ml RAB5 (RPMI with 5% human serum AB (Sigma), 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 10mM
HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50μg/ml streptomycin) per 175 cm2 flask for 2 hours at 37oC.
Non-adherent cells were removed by three gentle PBS washes. The remaining adherent cells
were cultured in RAB5 containing 300 IU/ml IL-4 and 100 IU/ml GM-CSF for 6 days. MDDCs
were harvested on day 6 by incubation in cell dissociation solution (Sigma) followed by
gentle scraping. Cells were resuspended in AIM V medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
incubated with 0.5 mg of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein or an irrelevant viral envelope
glycoprotein produced in the same way for 18 hours. Cells were then harvested by gentle
scraping then washed before lysis for HLA immunopurification.
Flow cytometry
Following differentiation and protein pulse, MDDCs were washed and stained with
antibodies specific for HLA-DR (L243, Biolegend), HLA-I (W6/32, Biolegend), DEC-205
(MMRI-7, BD Biosciences), DC-SIGN (9E9A8, Biolegend), CD86 (2331, BD Biosciences), CD83
(HB15e, Biolegend), CD80 (2D10, Biolegend), CD40 (SC3, Biolegend) and CD11c (S-HCL-3,
Biolegend) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed and fixed in 4%
PFA. Staining data were acquired on a LSRFortessa and analysis was performed on Flowjo
software version 10.6.2.
Enzymatic digestion of SARS-CoV-2 S protein
An equivalent of 5 ug of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was reduced by incubation with 5 mM DTT
for 30 minutes. Reduced S was incubated for 30 minutes with 20 mM iodoacetamide (IA)

followed by addition of DTT to 20 mM to react with residual IA. 0.2 µg of trypsin or elastase
was added per 5 µg of CoV2 S and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C. Sample clean-up was
performed with a C18 column (Waters Oasis SPE kit).
PNGaseF deglycosylation of digested SARS-CoV-2 S protein
Digested CoV2 S protein was dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 10 ul 20mM sodium
phosphate pH 7.5. Samples were divided equally, dried in a SpeedVac and then resuspended
in 18O-water (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) containing 200 U PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) or
buffer only. The protein was digested for 16 hours at 37°C. Sample clean-up was performed
with a C18 column (Waters Oasis SPE kit) and peptides were dried in a SpeedVac.
Production and purification of HLA-specific antibodies
Hybridoma cells (clones W6/32, L243, B721) were cultured in a CELLine CL 1000 Bioreactor
(Integra) as described in (31). B721 was kindly supplied by Prof. Anthony Purcell, Monash
University, Melbourne, Australia. Briefly, cells were cultured in serum-free Hybridoma-SFM
medium (Gibco) supplemented with hybridoma mix (2,800 mg/l of d-glucose, 2,300 mg/l of
peptone, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids,
0.00017% 2-mercaptoethanol). Supernatant containing antibody was harvested and stored
at -20. To purify antibodies, supernatants were thawed then centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 25
min at 4°C, filtered (0.2 µm SteriCup Filter (Millipore)) and incubated with protein A resin
(PAS) (Expedeon) for 18 hours at 4°C. Antibody-resin complexes were then collected by
gravity flow through chromatography columns, washed with 20 ml of PBS, and eluted with 5
ml 100 mM glycine pH 3.0. pH was adjusted to pH 7.4 using 1 M Tris pH 9.5 and antibodies
were buffer exchanged into PBS and concentrated with a 5 kDa molecular weight cut-off
ultrafiltration device (Millipore).
Preparation of immunoresin

Cross-linking of purified antibodies was performed as follows: 3 mg of antibody per 0.5 ml
PAS was incubated for 1 h at 4°C then washed with 15 ml borate buffer (0.05 M boric acid,
0.05 M KCl, 4 mM NaOH, pH 8.0), 15 ml 0.2 M triethanolamine pH 8.2 and cross-linked to
PAS with 15 ml of 40 mM dimethyl pimelimidate in 0.2 M triethanolamine pH 8.3. After 1 h,
crosslinking was terminated by addition of 15 ml of 0.2 M Tris pH 8.0, unbound antibody
was removed by washing with 15 ml citrate buffer pH 3.0 and three washes with 15 ml PBS.
HLA complex immunoprecipitation (IP) and peptide purification
Harvest MDDCs were washed in PBS then lysed by mixing for 45 minutes with 3 ml of lysis
buffer (0.5% (v/v) IGEPAL 630, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 1 tablet cOmplete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail EDTA-free (Roche) per 10 ml buffer) at 4°C. Lysate clarification
was achieved by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 10 mins followed by a 20,000 × g spin step
for 15 mins at 4°C. 3 mg of W6/32 antibody-PAS was incubated with lysate for at least 5 h at
4°C with gentle rotation. Resin was collected by gravity flow and flow-through lysate was
sequentially incubated with L243- and then B721-PAS. Antibody-resin-HLA complexes were
washed with 15 ml of 0.005% IGEPAL, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 15 ml
of 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 15 ml of 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 450 mM NaCl, and 15 ml of
50 mM Tris pH 8.0. 3 ml of 10% acetic acid was used to elute bound HLA complexes from
the PAS-antibody resin, which were then dried by vacuum centrifugation. Eluted peptides
were dissolved in loading buffer ( 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 1%(v/v) acetonitrile in
water), and then injected by a Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific) and
separated across a 4.6 mm × 50 mm ProSwift RP-1S column (Thermo Scientific). Peptides
were eluted using a 1 ml/min gradient over 5 min from 1-35% Acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and
fractions were collected every 30 seconds. Peptide fractions 1-15 were combined into odd
and even fractions then dried.

Mass spectrometric analysis
HPLC fractions were dissolved in loading solvent, and analysed by an Ultimate 3000 HPLC
system coupled to a high field Q-Exactive (HFX) Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific). Peptides were initially trapped in loading solvent, before RP separation with a 60
min linear acetonitrile in water gradient of 2-25 or 35% (HLA-I/HLA-II and trypsin analyses)
across a 75 µm × 50 cm PepMap RSLC C18 EasySpray column (Thermo Scientific) at a flow
rate of 250 nl/min. Gradient solvents contained additional 1%(v/v) DMSO and 0.1%(v/v)
formic acid. An EasySpray source was used to ionise peptides at 2000 V, which were
analysed by data-dependent acquisition. Initially a full-MS1 scan (120,000 resolution, 60 ms
accumulation time, AGC 3X106) was followed by 20 data-dependent MS2 scans (60,000
resolution, 120 ms accumulation time, AGC 5X105), with an isolation width of 1.6 m/z and
normalised HCD energy of 25%. For HLA-II charge states of 2–4 were selected for
fragmentation, for HLA-I 1+ ions were also included. Dynamic exclusion was set for 30 s. For
enzymatic digests of S protein normalised HCD was increased to 28%, only 2-4 charge states
were acquired.
Mass spectrometry peptide data analysis
Raw data files were analysed in PEAKS X software (Bioinformatic Solutions) using a protein
sequence fasta file containing 20,606 reviewed human Uniprot entries downloaded on
24/05/2018, supplemented with the sequence for SARS-CoV-2 full-length S protein cloned.
No enzyme specificity was set, peptide mass error tolerances were set at 5 ppm for
precursors and 0.03 Da for MS2 fragments. Additionally, post translational modifications
were identified utilising the Peaks PTM inbuilt de novo-led search for 303 common
modifications. A 1% false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using decoy database search
built into Peak data plotting. Data manipulation was performed in R and excel. NetMHCII

pan 4.023 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/) was installed locally and utilised to define
binding (rank score cut of 10) . Sequence logos were generated by Seq2logo2.0. Venn
diagrams and UpsetR plots were created using the online
http://www.interactivenn.net/index2.html61 and UpsetR program in R. Clustering of
sequences was done by GibbsCluster2.0 with defaults for MHC class II ligands and 1–5
clusters, the most obvious 1-2 clusters were selected. Peptides were aligned into nested
sets using Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) Epitope Cluster Analysis62 tool
http://tools.iedb.org/cluster/ and positions in proteins were determined by
http://tools.iedb.org/immunomebrowser/. A python script was written to calculate the
frequency of amino acids across the full length S protein. Jalview 2.11.1.0 63 was used for
multisequence alignment with MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform)
with default settings. Alignments were visualised in Jalview and colouring amino acids by
property based on CLustal_X definitions or identity. All graphs were plotted in R or Excel.
Glyco-site and glycopeptide analysis
Raw data for the de-N-glycosylated samples were analysed as described above with the
following modifications. A standard PeaksDB search was utilised with additional variable
post translational modifications set for 18O labelling (C-terminal +2.00 Da), 18O deamidation
(NQ, +2.99 Da), deamidation (NQ, -0.98 Da) and oxidation (M, +15.99 Da) and a fixed
modification for carboxyamidomethylation (C, +57.02). Each site was checked manually for
over-lapping peptides with consistent heavy deamidation present. Glycopeptides were
identified by Byonic v3.8.13 (Protein Metrics, CA, USA). Spectra were extracted and
searched against the same fasta file as above, but with unspecific cleavage sites and
allowing unlimited missed cleavages. A library of 132 possible N-glycan compositions was
utilized in a ‘rare’ variable modification search strategy. A fixed modification of

carboxyamidomethylation was included for digested S. Data was filtered at a 1% protein
FDR resulting in a 1.38 % peptide FDR in the combined dataset, glycopeptides were further
filtered to ensure that oxonium ions were present in the MS2 spectrum and that scores
were above 150 as described64. All reported glycopeptides were manually checked. Filtering
and spectral counting was performed in Byologic v3.8.11, spectra with the same precursor
mass and peptide identity was grouped and compositions determined as per the library.
