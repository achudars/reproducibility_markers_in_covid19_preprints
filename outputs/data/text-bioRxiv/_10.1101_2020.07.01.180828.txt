Abstract
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental requirement for life in
multicellular organisms, including humans, and a mechanism to maintain
homeostasis and prevent unwarranted cellular proliferations such as cancer. An
antisense gene in HIV-1 (Hap) induces apoptosis in human cells. Apoptotic T
cell death following HIV-1 infection leads to a compromised immune system and
eventually AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). A review of several
studies that focused on long-term survivors of HIV-1 reveals that these survivors
had deletion-mutations in Hap. A subset of these survivors changed course and
experienced CD4+ T cell death and progression to AIDS. These individuals had
virus that regained Hap gene sequence that had previously been deleted.
Analysis of the changes in the genetic sequences with in vivo progression of the
revertant HIV-1 virus allowed identification of a specific region in Hap we are
calling MORT. MORT, in Hap RNA forms a primary microRNA-like structure.
Potential human mRNAs targeted by MORT mi/siRNAs include gene/RNA
sequences of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and apollon, along
with many other human gene sites/RNAs. Thus MORT may be acting as an RNA
antagonist to cellular IAPs thereby inducing apoptotic cell death. Surprisingly,
additional potential MORT targets include viral sites in human SARS-CoV-2,
including the protease, nsp5 RNA. Future uses for RNA therapy and a
hypothesis for an HIV intrinsic mechanism utilizing MORT for viral anti-viral (or
anti-microbial) and HIV anti-immune cell defense are proposed.

To die or not to die: that is the question. The acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
has long been known to be associated with the death of the CD4 + T cell
(Kelleher and Zaunders, 2006)). While some controversy has been associated
with the mechanism of the demise of this central cell pivotal in both B and T cell
immunity, laboratory observations clearly reveal the depletion of thymocyte and
CD4+ T cell populations as HIV-1 infection progresses, except in rare individuals
(Barmania and Pepper, 2013; Liu, et al, 1996; Dean, et al, 1996; Samson, et al,
1996; Carrington, et al, 1999). If one puts aside the human host side of the
pathogenesis equation, such as those individuals lacking a competent coreceptor (the CCR5 deletion) (Barmania and Pepper, 2013; Liu, et al, 1996;
Dean, et al, 1996; Samson, et al, 1996; Carrington, et al, 1999) on the immune
cells to facilitate HIV entry who thereby acquire some resistance to infection by
the virus: what about the virus itself induces cell death? Is there a genetic
component of HIV-1 that has reliably been shown to be associated with T cell
death?
The human T cell intrinsically faces the decision for division, anergy, or apoptosis
at multiple stages, both in developmental processes and in ramping up (and
down) a response to infection (Kolb, et al, 2017; Kerr, et al, 1972; Clarke, et al,
1993; Schwartz and Osborne, 1993; Cohen, 1993). When it comes time to diewhat signal or signals must occur within the cell? More particularly, is there a
signal for cell death contributed by human immunodeficiency virus?
Here we propose that a specific region of the Hap antisense gene located within
the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is contributing to the programmed cell death
or apoptosis observed with HIV infection (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008).
Hap RNA initiates in the repeat (R) region of the HIV-1 provirus and is
transcribed in the reverse direction (antisense) to the other HIV genes,
overlapping the beginning portion of TAR region DNA, the TATA box, the SP1
sites and NFKb sites controlling HIV-1 sense transcription, as well as 200
nucleotides of the 3’ end of the nef gene (Figure 1B) (Ludwig, et al, 2006;
Ludwig, 2008). The introduction of this antisense gene into human cells induced
programmed cell death or apoptosis, as classically defined (Kerr, et al, 1972;
Clarke, et al, 1993; Schwartz and Osborne, 1993; Cohen, 1993). In most
experiments, performed over a decade between 1995 (the discovery of the HIV
antisense initiator (HIVaINR) (U.S. patent 5,919,677) and 2005, it was a race to
isolate the RNA or proteins(s) from human cells before apoptosis occurred.
Because of the enhanced apoptotic cell death observed with introduction of a
recombinant eukaryotic vector incorporating the Hap gene sequence (GenBank
CQ767337 nt 14-367), we undertook a reanalysis of observations in two “in vivo”
systems: a) a mouse model of AIDS (Lindemann, et al, 1994), with a nef/LTR
transgene containing near-identical sequence to that of the Hap gene, and b)
comparison of the genetic changes in the nef/LTR deleted viral species isolated
in a group of HIV-1-infected individuals who changed from long term nonprogressor (LTNP) status to progression to AIDS, so-called “slow progressors”

(Gorry, et al, 2007; Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill, et al,
2006; Dyer, et al, 1999; Dyer, et al 1997; Greenway, et al 1998; Rhodes, et al,
1999; Learmont, et al 1992; Oelrichs, et al 1998; Zaunders, et al 2011; Learmont,
et al, 1999).
The slow progressors within the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort (SBBC) remarkably
demonstrated both the “loss of function” as well as “gain of function” required for
T cell death, in a natural human system prior to the institution of anti-retroviral
therapy (Gorry, et al, 2007; Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill,
et al, 2006; Dyer, et al, 1999; Dyer, et al 1997; Greenway, et al 1998; Rhodes, et
al, 1999; Learmont, et al 1992; Oelrichs, et al 1998; Zaunders, et al 2011;
Learmont, et al, 1999). The original viral deletion within these slow progressors
(SP) encompassed a portion of the HIV antisense gene that was critical in the
formation of an RNA primary microRNA-like secondary/tertiary structure that we
are calling MORT.
The HIV antisense gene sequence (GenBank CQ767337) from 270-300 shares
14 to 23 nucleotides of sequence homology with sites in or bordering 177 human
genes, significant identity with seven human microRNAs (identified by BLAST on
MirGeneDB), and a proposed mi/siRNA forms complementary base-pairing
structures with multiple human genes important in the apoptosis pathway. Xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and Apollon are amongst some of
the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins potentially targeted by MORT. This suggests a
mechanism whereby the HIV-1 virus can induce apoptosis within the human host
cell, with MORT as an antagonist to IAPs, and has potential implications for AIDS
latency and applications for cancer. In yet another twist, the HIV antisense gene
shares 7 sites with 11-14 nt sequence identity or complementarity with the novel
coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2; implications of this will also be discussed.
Results
A transgenic mouse model of AIDS
Lindemann, et al, 1994 described a transgenic mouse model of AIDS in which
the transgene incorporated only the intact HIV-1 nef and long terminal repeat
(nef/LTR) genomic region (BRU, Genbank accession number K02013), and
thereby also the HIV antisense gene (Hap), under the control of mouse T-cell
receptor beta chain-specific promoter and enhancer elements (Figure 1 A).
Dramatic changes in the mouse lymphocyte populations were induced in the
transgenic mice along with a severe immunodeficiency (Lindemann, et al, 1994).
Transgenic mice demonstrating the most significant and severe changes in
lymphocyte populations (B6/338L) had a single aberrant copy of the transgene
integrated but also rearranged such that the mouse T-cell receptor (TCR) beta
chain enhancer was downstream, instead of upstream of the mouse TCR
promoter and HIV-1 nef/3’long terminal repeat sequences (Figure 1A),
(Lindemann, et al, 1994). This rearrangement situated the enhancer close to the
region of the HIV antisense gene in the LTR and in position to help drive
antisense transcription off the intrinsic HIV-1 antisense initiator (HIVaINR) in TAR

region DNA (Figure S1C) (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008). The transgene
construct contained HIV-1 BRU genome sequences from 7956 through 9484 and
thus contained the intact HIV antisense gene in its entirety. Blast comparison
(https://blast.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) of the BRU sequence in the mouse
transgene with the HIV antisense gene (GenBank CQ767337.1) showed that the
corresponding genetic regions were 99% identical (Figure 1A) (Ludwig, et al,
2006; Ludwig, 2008).
They were unable to demonstrate Nef protein production in this transgenic
mouse line, thereby suggesting the possibility some other genetic component
caused the phenotypic changes in these mice (Lindemann, et al, 1994). Mouse
CD4+CD8+ and CD4+CD8- thymocytes were depleted early in ontogeny and
offspring of line B6/338L were characterized by a profound immunodeficiency
and high mortality rate (Lindemann, et al, 1994). A 200-300 fold decrease in total
CD4+ thymocyte numbers in heterozygous B6/338L mice as compared to nontransgenic control littermates was described (Lindemann, et al, 1994). Thus
CD4+ T-cell death was occurring as a consequence of the introduction of the
transgene containing the nef/LTR and also HIV antisense gene sequences.
The HIV antisense gene could induce apoptosis
Our experience showed that vectors producing the HIV antisense gene RNA
from the intrinsic HIV antisense initiator (HIVaINR) sequences induced apoptosis
within three days, but with an alternate cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter driving
antisense RNA transcription, one had even less time before apoptosis occurred
(Figure 2A, see also Figure S1A) (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008).
Characterization of the Hap RNA and protein(s) has previously been described
(Ludwig, et al, 2006). Transfection of human cells with HIV-1 antisense gene
sequences (CQ767337 bp 14-367) directionally cloned into a recombinant vector
with a CMV promoter and a carboxyterminal FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitopeencoding sequence, called HAP-FLAG, induced apoptosis within 24-36 hours, or
even sooner in the absence of Tat (Figure 2), (Ludwig, et al, 2006). While the
HeLa (Maddon, et al, 1986), HL2/3 (Felber and Pavlakis, 1988; Ciminale, et al,
1990), and Clone69T1-RevEnv (Yu, et al, 1996) cells transfected with control
p15cxCAT (Durand, et al, 1988) and pCMVTag vectors demonstrated occasional
mitotic figures, the same cells transfected with the HAP-FLAG vector containing
the HIV antisense gene sequences demonstrated enhanced numbers of
apoptotic cells (Figure 2A, HAP-FLAG, top row).
The HeLa cell line was also transfected with the three separate vectors (HAPFLAG, p15cxCAT, and pCMVTag) under identical experimental conditions, and
then analyzed for protein expression using a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody
(+Ab) or control (-Ab) (Figure 2B). In addition to demonstrating the perinuclear
location of the HAP-FLAG protein (Figure 2B, HAP-FLAG, +Ab), in this
experiment the well coverslips had to be pulled early (within hours) because
under light microscopy the cells were already “balling up” and floating off the
coverslips (lbl, observation).

Figure 2 shows that apoptosis was enhanced by the HIV antisense gene
regardless of whether the human cell line already produced the HIV-1 Rev and
Env proteins (Clone69T1-RevEnv) (Yu, et al, 1996), all the HIV-1 proteins except
reverse transcriptase (HL2/3) (Felber and Pavlakis, 1988; Ciminale, et al, 1990)
or was the control cell line, HeLa. This evidence strongly suggests a contributing
agent for the apoptotic cell death (from the HIV-1 genome) is localized to the HIV
antisense gene in the long terminal repeat of HIV (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig,
2008). These experiments also demonstrate that all three human HeLa cell
lines, which are long-lived because they are immortalized cancer cell lines, can
be induced to undergo apoptosis with the introduction of a vector expressing the
HIV antisense gene.
Discovery of MORT in the HIV antisense gene
A vast literature exists involving research on human long term survivors (LTS)
infected with attenuated nef/LTR –deleted HIV-1 strains (Gorry, et al, 2007;
Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill, et al, 2006; Kirchhoff, et al,
1995; Mariani, et al, 1996; Dyer, et al, 1999; Dyer, et al 1997; Salvi, et al 1998;
Greenway, et al 1998; Rhodes, et al, 1999; Learmont, et al 1992; Oelrichs, et al
1998; Zaunders, et al 2011; Learmont, et al, 1999). Because the intact nef/LTR
region of the HIV genome, which also contains the HIV antisense gene,
appeared to be sufficient for inducing cytopathogenicity and an AIDS phenotype
in mice (Lindemann, et al, 1994), we reasoned that the virus isolated from human
long-term survivors might provide further clues as to the viral genetic regions
important for cell death. The separate issues of host genetic changes, such as
mutations/deletions in CCR5, a chemokine receptor on the host CD4 + T cell
important in viral entry, or viral defects affecting viral entry or infectious capability
are also important, but are not the subject of this paper.
The Sydney blood bank cohort (SBBC) included 8 individuals (C98, C54, C49,
C64, C18, C135, C83 and C124) infected with an attenuated, nef/LTR deleted
HIV-1 strain by blood products from a single HIV-1 infected donor (D36) (Gorry,
et al, 2007; Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill, et al, 2006; Dyer,
et al, 1999; Dyer, et al 1997; Greenway, et al 1998; Rhodes, et al, 1999;
Learmont, et al 1992; Oelrichs, et al 1998; Zaunders, et al 2011; Learmont, et al,
1999). The original deletion in the HIV-1 nef/LTR causing attenuation of the virus
was shown to be in a region of nef-long terminal repeat overlap (Figure 1B, blue
rectangle)( Greenway, et al 1998). Early studies demonstrated the absence of
antibody reactivity to a single peptide in an array of peptides corresponding to aa
162-177 of Nef protein (Figure 1B) (Greenway, et al 1998). They also reported
failure to amplify wild-type HIV-1 sequences with PCR primers in the conserved
deletion (Learmont, et al, 1999). The “accident of nature” represented by this
human cohort allowed study of the natural course of viral infection and host
immune responses, as well as the alterations in the genomic sequence of HIV-1
over time. Despite infection with the same D36 virus, the infected recipients had
a varied clinical course (Gorry, et al, 2007; Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al,
2004; Churchill, et al, 2006; Dyer, et al, 1999; Dyer, et al 1997; Greenway, et al

1998; Rhodes, et al, 1999; Learmont, et al 1992; Oelrichs, et al 1998; Zaunders,
et al 2011; Learmont, et al, 1999). Some cohort members had stable CD4+T-cell
counts and low plasma HIV RNA levels for up to 29 years without antiretroviral
therapy (C49, C64, and C135) and were called elite non-progressors (Gorry, et
al, 2007, Zaunders, et al 2011).
However, there were three slow progressors (SP) (D36, C54, and C98) that
experienced a profoundly different clinical course, with a decline in CD4+T cells
following many years of asymptomatic infections (Gorry, et al, 2007). Full-length
proviral sequence analysis showed the nef-LTR mutations were the only unusual
HIV-1 feature in these infected individuals (Oelrichs, et al 1998). The original
HIV-1 deletion of the SP donor and recipients completely overlapped the HIV
antisense gene sequence from nucleotides (nt) 237-284 (Figures 1B (blue
rectangle), 3, 4 (red arrows)) (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008).
Slow progressor viruses regain a portion of HIV antisense gene sequence
while losing nef sequence
Specific sequence comparisons of these SBBC SP HIV-1 genomic sequences
deposited in GenBank, and cloned prior to any anti-retroviral therapy, was
undertaken. Sequences were aligned with HIV-1 BRU (LAV-1) from the start of
Nef at 8390 through the repeat (R) region sequence at 9193 (Figure 1B) (Gorry,
et al, 2007; Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill, et al, 2006,
Oelrichs, et al 1998, Zaunders, et al 2011). This included the HIV antisense
initiator and start site at BRU 9156 (Figure 1B, as diagrammed) (Ludwig, et al,
2006; Ludwig, 2008). The original deletion of Nef aa 162-177 corresponding to
HIV-1 BRU sequence 8873-8920 and HIV antisense gene sequence 284-237
(overlapping in the reverse direction) was shared by D36 with the SBBC blood
product recipients (blue shaded rectangle, Figure 1B) (Greenway, et al 1998).
The D36 viral genome changed over time to regain some of the deleted
sequence (D36, Figures 1B, 3, 4) (Gorry, et al, 2007; Deacon, et al, 1995;
Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill, et al, 2006, Oelrichs, et al 1998, Zaunders, et al
2011). This regaining of sequence in the original deletion (blue rectangle) can
also be observed in the other SP C98 and C54 viruses (Figure 1B, Figure 3A).
Comparison of C54 viral genomic alterations between 1993 and 2001 (9 and 17
years post transfusion) most clearly illustrates the gain of sequence in the region
of the original SBBC deletion while more of the nef sequence is lost (C54, Figure
1B). The most significant decline in CD4+ T cells appeared 12-13 years posttransfusion, and co-incident with the gain of sequence in the original deletion
region (Learmont, et al, 1999). Nef deletions increased in all three individuals
who went from stable CD4+ T cell counts to SP status (Gorry, et al, 2007,
Churchill et al, 2004, Churchill, et al, 2006), making it difficult to postulate that
Nef was responsible for CD4+ T cell loss and disease progression in these
individuals. It is interesting also to note that C54 HIV-1 viral species acquired a
complete duplication of the entire enhancer and promoter region and thereby
also duplicated the HIVaINR with the potential for two antisense RNA initiation
sites (Figure 1B, C54 2001, reverse arrows: duplicated enhancer regions

indicated). In our experiments, only a single intrinsic start site from the HIVaINR
was observed (Figure S1C, Ludwig, et al, 2006).
A study of separate HIV-1 viruses isolated from D36, either in 1995 (prior to
progression to AIDS) or from 1999 (after disease progression) found that the
1999 isolate induced greater levels of CD4+ T cell cytotoxicity than the 1995
isolate in an ex vivo human lymphoid cell culture system (Jekle, et al, 2002). This
illustrates the enhanced cell death that occurred coincident with evolution of the
D36 viral genome. This is also consistent with our observations of apoptosis
induced by the introduction of the intact HIV antisense gene into human cells
(Figure 2 and data not shown).
Alignment of SBBC slow progressor viral sequences with the HIV antisense
gene reveals sequence nt 274-284 (originally deleted) is regained,
corresponding to sequence in a small noncoding antisense RNA (snc #208,
Althaus, et al, 2012 )
Others have analyzed the evolution of the nef/LTR sequences from SBBC
viruses (Gorry, et al, 2007; Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill, et
al, 2006, Oelrichs, et al 1998, Zaunders, et al, 2011). All of these studies viewed
the deletion from the genomic RNA strand (sense) direction, instead of bidirectionally, despite the fact that HIV-1 must replicate using a dsDNA proviral
form. Using the gene sequences from these studies (deposited in GenBank), we
re-aligned the sequences to the HIV antisense gene located in the proviral LTR
using BLAST and visual alignment (Figure 3A, Hap sequence 27, at top).
Sequence 27 (CQ767337) is identical to that cloned into the recombinant HAPFLAG vector used to produce RNA and proteins, as previously described in detail
(Ludwig, et al, 2006). Figure 3A illustrates the striking alterations in the derived
HIV antisense gene sequences of viruses isolated from the donor D36 and two
SP recipients, C54 and C98, as compared to the original SBBC deletion. The
region of the original SBBC deletion corresponds to HIV antisense gene
sequence 237-284 (Figure 3A, in red).
D36, C54, and C98 gained sequence from HIV antisense nucleotides (nt) 274284, which had previously been deleted. The regained sequence was part of the
previously proposed HIVaINR antisense RNA HAAmiRNA 2 site (underlined,
Figure 3A) (Ludwig, 2008). Particularly exciting was that a 22 nt small
noncoding RNA has been cloned and sequenced from HIV-infected cells
following selection for antisense small RNAs and corresponds to nt 274295 (Althaus, et al, 2012 ). In contrast, the SBBC SP genetic regions
overlapping the HIV-1 core promoter and enhancer elements (TATA box, Sp1
and NFkB sites) are predominantly conserved and are 93-96% identical to
corresponding HIV-1 BRU sequences (see region corresponding to HIV
antisense gene sequence 27.1 through 27.123 (Figure 3A). For simplicity, the
enhancer duplication regions of the SBBC SP are not shown in Figure 3A, but
are indicated as overlapping rectangles in Figure 1B.

The phylogeny of the SBBC progressor versus nonprogressor sequences as
compared to HIV antisense gene MORT primary (miRNA) sequence 252-363 is
shown in Figure 3B (NCBI Blast Tree View Widget). The in vivo progression of
the C98 viruses (below Query Hap MORT sequences (in yellow)) can be
compared to the elite non-progressor C49 (above Query sequence). C49
sequence did not appear to change in the MORT primary region between 1994
and 2001, and while closer to D36 1995 sequences is the furthest distance from
Hap MORT (seq 27 from patent EP1359221) (Figure 3B)
Figure 4 illustrates M-fold analysis (Zuker, 2003; Markham and Zuker, 2008) of
the HIV antisense gene RNA (CQ767337) used in our experiments. The original
deletion of SBBC/D36 viral species is indicated by red line, later deletions for
D36 viral species are outlined in yellow, and where D36 virus actually regained
sequence is indicated (purple lines) (Figure 4). Over time, between the original
infection in 1980 and genetic analysis of the virus in 1995 and 1997, the D36 viral
genome underwent significant changes in the HIV antisense gene sequence
region 274-345 (corresponding to BRU sequence 8882-8812).
The revertant changes in D36, C54 and C98 viral genomes to include the intact
HIV antisense gene region 274-284, while maintaining adjacent hairpin-forming
sequence up to nt 345 occurs along with alterations of the clinical status in these
individuals to progressors. The donor (D36) was infected in 1980, but by 19961998 six of seven CD4 lymphocyte counts were 500 or fewer cells per cubic
millimeter with the lowest value of 282 in Sept 1998 (Learmont, et al, 1999). He
was diagnosed with HIV dementia in 12/1998 and began antiretroviral therapy on
1/1999 (reviewed in Gorry, et al, 2007, Zaunders, et al, 2011). SP C54 and C98
experienced significant decreases in CD4+T cells averaging 58 and 73 cells per
cubic millimeter per year (Learmont, et al, 1999) and C98 went on antiretroviral
therapy in 11/1999 (Gorry, et al, 2007).
Thus a “regain of function” of CD4+T cell death was observed in vivo following
the reemergence of a specific genetic locus in the HIV antisense gene, a locus of
apoptosis. These genetic changes would clearly impact the formation of a RNA
secondary/tertiary structure, a 33 bp hairpin we are calling MORT (Figure 4).
MORT sequence is shared with human genes
NIH NCBI BLAST server and the GenBank database
(http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/GenBank/) was used to search the human genome
database against a small segment of the HIV antisense gene, CQ767337 nt 270300, that formed the 5p side of the 33 bp hairpin structure and included this locus
of apoptosis (Figure 4). This search revealed shared homology with a large
number of sites adjacent or in human genes (see also Table S1 and Figure S6).
A hairpin implies often complementary sequence and thus we also used Blast to
search the HIV antisense RNA from nucleotides (nt) 330-345 (3p), against the
human gene database (data not shown). HIV nef sequences are complementary

described. Thus it was a surprise to observe more than 177 human genomic
sites shared significant homology or identity, with 14/14 to 23/23 nt identical to
MORT 270-300 (Table S1, Figure S6).
This suggests that once again the human immunodeficiency virus has borrowed
from its human host, and also that the shared function of this bit of viral
DNA/RNA may have more universal implications (and applications) than
previously suspected.
How MORT might function
Mfold (Zuker, 2003) structure of the HIV-1 antisense RNA that was utilized in our
experiments (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008) demonstrates an intact 33 bp
hairpin with a 15 nt terminal loop from CQ767337 antisense RNA sequence nt
252-363, consistent with a primary microRNA (miRNA)-like structure (labeled
MORT, Figure 4). However, all the early SBBC SP viral RNA would be incapable
of forming this structure because of the original deletion in the SBBC viral dsDNA
genome corresponding to Hap gene nt 237-284 (Figures 3, 4). With biological
progression or evolution of the virus in vivo, the D36 (and other SP) viruses
regained sequence from MORT region 274-284, as well as maintaining
contiguous sequence such that a revertant hairpin structure with 19 base-paired
nucleotides was possible (Figures 3, 4). This reconstituted sequence (and
structure) was in evolution at the same time as other surrounding sequence in
the nef and nef/LTR region was lost (Figure 4, compare with Figure 1B, 3A).
Corresponding to this evolution of the HIV-1 virus, the donor D36, for example,
presented a phenotype of enhanced T cell loss and was diagnosed with AIDS
dementia (reviewed in Gorry, et al, 2007, Zaunders, et al, 2011).
If one presumes that at least 16 nt complementarity are required between the 5p
and 3p hairpin sequences to form a metazoan small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
microRNA, it seems that the revertant viral species would support this requisite
with a 5p arm (274-299 (26nt)) and 3p arm (321-343/345 (22nt)) (Fromm, et al,
2015; Elbashir, et al, 2001; Bartel, 2009).
As further confirmation, a unique small noncoding (nc) antisense RNA
(corresponding to the MORT sequence from 274-295) has previously been
identified by cloning and sequencing of small ncRNAs in HIV-1 infected human
cells (Althaus, et al., 2012, Sequence No 208). This suggests potential
parameters for both 5p and 3p intrinsic HIV si/miRNAs (Figure 5A, top,
underlined).
Conservation of MORT across HIV-1 but not HIV-2 clades
There is conservation of MORT sequences forming the 33 bp hairpin, as is
apparent when the precursor miRNA MORT hairpin is compared with the HIV-1
group M subtype or clade sequences (Figure 5A) (Kuiken, et al, HIV Sequence
Compendium 2001). Sequences forming part of the complementary base-paired
regions and necessary for the hairpin formation are more conserved between

subtypes than the terminal hairpin loop sequences or bulges (Figure 5A).
However, there are some significant strain differences, particularly in laboratory
adapted types such as pNL4-3, which could alter stability of MORT hairpin
formation (Figure S1B).
In contrast, with further distance on the lentiviral genome phylogenetic tree
(Kuiken, et al, 2001), the MORT region of sequence becomes much less
conserved. Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) sequences are much
more variable, to the extent that an identical MORT secondary/tertiary hairpin
structure could not form. The HIV-2 subtype G sequence has 18 nt mutated or
deleted in the region corresponding to MORT 5p sequence 271-299, and also
represents a much less pathogenic virus for humans (see 2G.AB, Figure 5A).
This is compelling because, as discussed above, the original D36 deletion that
was associated with an attenuated HIV and a non-progressor phenotype also
had sequence missing from HIV antisense sequence 237-284, of which 14 nt
correspond to this region. Revertant virus D36.1997 then regained 274-284, as
well as retaining adjacent sequence to 345 (as diagrammed below Figure 5A).
MORT shares sequence with human microRNAs
Finally, blast comparison on the database for robustly supported miRNAs,
MirGeneDB, (www.mirgenedb.org) yielded significant homologies (E value
between 0.51 and 1.8: Figure S3) between the proposed precursor miRNA
MORT and seven human microRNAs on the 5p side (Figure 5B, examples 1-6
and supplemental Figure S3), as well as their characterized homologues in three
other species (Fromm, et al, 2015). The previously identified sncRNA SEQ#208
from HIV-infected cells (Althaus, et al, 2012) is shown above MORT sequence
(example 1) with sequence corresponding to the original deletion of D36 shown
in red. MORT 272-284 shares 12/13 identical nucleotides (underlined) with MIR5586 3p mature microRNA. Precursor MORT shares 15/17 identical nucleotides
with MIR-7151 5p microRNA (MORT 287-302), 12/13 identical nucleotides with
MIR-3173 (MORT 284-296), 10/10 identical nucleotides with both MIR-138 P1
and P2 5p “seed” region microRNA (MORT 278-287), and 11/12 identical
nucleotides with MIR-10-P2C (MORT 275-286) (Figure 5B, identical sequence
underlined, examples 1- 6). The original D36 (and shared SBBC) HIV-1 deleted
sequence that was later regained is shown in red within the MORT sequence,
and is suggestive of how this deletion might have impacted MORT activity
(Figure 5B).
Furthermore, the 3p side of MORT, particularly between 325-353, demonstrates
sequence homology with human microRNAs 624 3p, 103-P2 (5p side) and
microRNA 29-P1a 3p (Figure 5B, underlined, examples 7-9) (Fromm, et al,
2015). The homology with human miRNA 29a 3p is of particular interest
because another retrovirus, Bovine Leukemia Virus, has been shown to produce
a microRNA, BLV-B4-3p, that shares partial sequence identity and shared
common targets with host miRNA 29a (Kincaid, et al 2012). BLV-B4-3p, with 8 nt
shared seed region, can be compared to MORT region 337-360 with 10 nt
shared sequence to human miRNA29a 3p seed region (Figure 5B, example 9).

This would support the notion of this MORT locus for apoptosis actually being a
site for miRNA generation. It also further implicates MORT in impacting the
genes regulated by these human microRNAs, allowing an amplification of MORT
gene effect. However, it should be pointed out that the entire HIV antisense gene
RNA is capable of forming an exactly complementary duplex with the 3’ end of
HIV sense mRNAs (such as nef mRNA) and genomic RNA. Thus Dicer could cut
at 21/22 nt intervals for the entire length, producing siRNA, as noted previously
(Ludwig, 2008).
MORT proposed as a regulatory small RNA or miRNA with target binding
sites that include X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and other
inhibitor of apoptosis protein gene mRNA/DNA
MicroRNAs act as regulators of gene expression by direct base-pairing, often to
specific target sites in messenger RNA 3’ untranslated regions (UTR), and
perform in conjunction with the human Argonaute (AGO) proteins in a miRNAinduced silencing complex (miRISC) (Bartel, 2009; Broughton, et al, 2016;
Berezikov, et al, 2007; Helwak, et al, 2013). Canonical animal mature microRNA
is formed from longer hairpin-bearing, primary transcripts following sequential
endonucleolytic cleavages by the RNase III enzymes Drosha, and then Dicer
(Lee, et al, 2003; Du and Zamore, 2005). For an early review of pivotal work on
miRNA and siRNA biogenesis see (Filipowicz, et al, 2005). The 33 bp MORT
hairpin (Figure 4) has both the requisite terminal loop (15 nt) and flanking
sequence for Drosha to identify and then cut about 22 bp away from the junction
of the terminal loop and the adjacent stem (Zeng, et al, 2005). This would
generate a precursor miRNA-like structure, as shown in Figure 5A, top,
(underlined) that could then presumably be further recognized and cut by Dicer in
conjunction with TRBP (Chendrimada, et al, 2005; Lee, et al, 2003; Du and
Zamore, 2005; Filipowicz, et al, 2005; Zeng, et al, 2005). However, alternative
pathways of biogenesis of small regulatory RNAs exist (Bogerd, et al 2010).
MiRNAs called mirtrons can derive from short introns cut by Dicer alone
(Berezikov, et al, 2007). More recently an alternative pathway bypassing Drosha
and Dicer but associated with Argonaute proteins and derived from short introns
(80-100 nucleotides) has also been described (Hansen, et al, 2016).
Human miRNA:mRNA duplexes selected on AGO have complex base-pairing
interactions possible (Broughton, et al, 2016; Helwak, et al, 2013). More than
60% of the seed region (6-8 nt at the 5’ end of miRNA) interactions had
mismatched or bulged nucleotides, and were also often accompanied by specific,
non-seed base-pairing (Helwak, et al, 2013). Furthermore, functional miRNAbinding sites were found in all areas of the human target mRNA (Helwak, et al,
2013). With this in mind, we utilized the NIH NCBI BLAST site to investigate
whether MORT region (5p) from 271-299 might have potential target sites in
genes important in apoptosis pathways, without specifying specific regions (such
as 3’ untranslated mRNA) of the genes. We paid special attention to the region nt
274-295, inasmuch as this has already been documented as an HIV-1 antisense

small ncRNA (Althaus, et al, 2012), as well as including the sequence regained in
revertant SP viruses (Figure 5C, D36.1997).
Remarkably, the HAP-FLAG MORT region 271-299 (CQ767337) demonstrated
significant alignments with 122 matches on the human X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis (XIAP) gene reference sequence NG_007264.1. These regions
matched either the coding or complementary strand and were identical from
13/13 to 7/7 nt (Figure 5C, supplemental Figure S2). MORT sequence on the 3p
strand, nt 322-350 also yielded 98 significant alignments with identities of 9/9 to
7/7 bases suggesting either 5p or 3p regions of MORT could be functioning
(Figure 5C and data not shown).
Significantly, investigation of the HIV-1 MORT region 274-300 from the SBBC
donor D36 virus in 1997 (D36.1997) demonstrated 247 BLAST hits with from
12/12 to 7/7 identities matched to the human XIAP sequence (supplemental
Figure S4).
One of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins shown to have a functional impact
on thymocyte development, and therefore potentially relevant for T cell
dysfunction observed in AIDS, was survivin (Ambrosini, et al, 1997; Okada, et al,
2004). BLAST analysis picked up 50 sites in the human apoptosis inhibitor
survivin gene (BIRC 5) (GenBank U75285) with between 7/7 to 9/9 nt identical
(+/+) or complementary (+/-) to MORT 271-300 (Figure 5C). Visual inspection of
the survivin gene sequence around these sites yielded multiple regions in
survivin that had sites with up to 21 base-pairs (including G:U) with MORT 271299 (Figure 5C). If one restricts the viable miRNA region to 274-295 (as with
documented SNCRNA 208) there are still up to 16/22 base-paired/MORT:survivin
segments, and multiple regions (5’UTR, 3’ UTR and coding) involved between
MORT:target, as was found by analysis of human miRNA:mRNA targets bound
to AGO (Helwak, et al, 2013). Target sites in the survivin gene also included
intronic regions, as well as 5’ and 3’ mRNA ends (Figure 5C).
Further investigation of MORT 271-299 sequences against other mammalian
genes encoding inhibitor of apoptosis proteins also suggested potential target
sites within Apollon, with BLAST analysis yielding 705 sites with 7/7-13/13
identity (Apollon, supplemental Figure S5). Of interest, many of these sites
appear to be in intronic regions (Figure S5). Because other investigators may find
other sites useful than those illustrated, we have included the raw data results of
BLAST searches for survivin, XIAP, and apollon genes versus MORT271.299
(supplemental Figures S2, S4, S5).
HIV antisense gene and SARS-CoV-2 shared or complementary sequences
We considered the possibility that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV1 might share strategies and/or sequences, despite disparate sizes and
replication mechanisms. We were surprised to find that the HIV antisense gene
(CQ767337) and SARS-CoV-2 (NC045512, MT007544) shared seven matches
of between 11/11 and 14/15 sequence identity (+/+ or +/-) on BLASTn analysis

(NCBI). Four of these HIV-1 sites represented identical sequence (+/+) (Figure
3, forward arrows) and three were capable of complementary base-pairing (+/-)
to SARS-CoV 2 sequence (Figure 3, backward arrow-CO). Curiously, two of the
sites are capable of base-pairing with an identical region in the RNA of nsp5, the
protease responsible for cutting much of the orf1ab polyprotein (Figure 5D), On
further inspection HIV MORT region 271-295 has the capacity for 17 contiguous
base-pairs with MT007544 SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 RNA seq.10392-10413 (Figure
5D.b.). This degree of complementarity could be associated with cleavage of a
target mRNA if accompanied by the RNA-induced silencing complex, RISC. HIV
Hap sequence 127-148 overlaps this same site in SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 RNA and
also represents the only HIV antisense gene sequence that is not situated in one
of the previously described HAAmiRNAs (Ludwig, 2008) or MORT region (Figure
5D) Of interest, while a similar portion of MORT 271-281 is complementary to
Bat Coronavirus MN996532 nsp5 seq 10381-10391, no such site with
complementary base-pairing is observed with human SARS NC004718 nsp5
RNA (Figure 5D.b.) The interaction between MORT and SARS appears to be at
disparate sites from that with SARS-CoV-2, with several sites focused on the
SARS (NC004718) SPIKE protein RNA (Figure 5D.a and b).
Discussion
There is still no cure for or vaccine to prevent HIV-induced human AIDS
(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Part of the problem appears to be an
inability to induce protective immunity in the human host. It would be impossible
to induce immunity if also inducing apoptosis of the respondent immune cells. A
major consequence of HIV infection has long been known to be the apoptotic cell
death of both directly infected CD4+ T cells and CD4+ cells in close proximity,
called uninfected bystander cells (reviewed in Gougeon and Montagnier, 1993;
Finkel, et al, 1995; Garg, et al, 2012; Garg and Joshi, 2016; Nardacci, et al,
2015; Kim, et al 2018). While the viral envelope glycoproteins gp120/gp41 (Env)
are important for binding to the target human cell CD4 and chemokine receptor
(CCR5/CXCR4) molecules, gp 41 is of particular importance in the fusion or
partial fusion (hemi-fusion) process and presumed Env-mediated bystander cell
death (Garg, et al, 2012).
Yet in vivo studies show that genetic mutations or deletions in the HIV envelope
gene do not abrogate an AIDS-like phenotype (Hanna, et al, 1998 a,b). In a
transgenic (Tg) mouse model where the HIV-1 genome was expressed under the
control of regulatory sequences for CD4 (CD4C), the same subset of cells in the
mouse thymus and periphery were found to be infected as in humans, with
subsequent development of a severe AIDS-like disease (Hanna, et al, 1998 a,b).
However, delivery of the intact HIV-1 envelope gene while gag, pol, vif, vpr, tat,
vpu and nef genes were mutated did not induce an AIDS-like or MAIDS
phenotype, and Tg mice bearing intact Env did not succumb early to a fatal
disease (Hanna, et al, 1998). The opposite strategy, with only Env mutated in the
HIV-1 proviral transgene, still led to a fatal disease very similar to that seen in the
intact CD4C/HIV wild-type Tg mice (Hanna, et al, 1998). Thus, the Env gene did

not contribute to the AIDS-like phenotype observed in the HIV transgenic mice in
vivo, although the transgene was targeted to the right cells by the CD4C
regulatory elements (Hanna, et al, 1998 a,b). However, a transgenic (Tg) mouse
line exhibited the AIDS phenotype in which only the nef/LTR region of the HIV-1
provirus was incorporated in the transgene, along with mouse T cell receptor
promoter/enhancer elements (Lindemann, et al, 1994). No nef protein was
demonstrated as being produced in the Tg mice (Lindemann, et al, 1994).
We noted that this DNA transgene incorporated sequence that contained all of
the HIV antisense gene, which is located within the HIV-1 LTR (Ludwig, et al,
2006; Ludwig, 2008). The incorporated viral transgene sequence was from the
BRU isolate, (GenBank K02013.1), and was 99% identical to the HIV antisense
gene (GenBank CQ767337) incorporated into vectors used in our studies
(Figures 1-5) (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008). Experiments over ten years in
our laboratory (from 1995-2005) continually ran the roadblock of cell death
induced by the HIV antisense gene. This was observed whether the HIV
antisense gene RNA was expressed off the intrinsic HIV-1 antisense initiator
(HIVaINR), or from a recombinant vector with a CMV promoter (Figure 2, Figure
S1 and as previously described (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008).
Morphologic studies demonstrated classical features of apoptosis that were
enhanced by the HIV antisense gene whether or not the cells also expressed
envelope (gp120/gp41) and rev, or all the other HIV-1 proteins except reverse
transcriptase (Figure 2, HAP-FLAG). The Hela cell line is a long-lived human cell
line from a patient who had cancer, so the HIV antisense gene was also inducing
apoptotic cell death in a cancer cell line not expressing any other HIV genes
(Figure 2).
The most compelling evidence in vivo for a specific region of the HIV-1 DNA
provirus as important in CD4+ T cell death and the AIDS phenotype, however,
comes from retrospective analysis of studies of the virus in evolution within the
human hosts of the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort (SBBC) (Gorry, et al, 2007;
Deacon, et al, 1995; Churchill et al, 2004; Churchill, et al, 2006; Dyer, et al, 1999;
Dyer, et al 1997; Greenway, et al 1998; Rhodes, et al, 1999; Learmont, et al
1992; Oelrichs, et al 1998; Zaunders, et al, 2011; Learmont, et al, 1999; Jekle, et
al, 2002). The SBBC individuals were infected by blood products from a single
donor with an attenuated, nef/LTR-deleted virus (D36 in Figures 1, 3). D36 virus
replicated in vivo in different human hosts, with different outcomes observed.
Some individuals, either because of innate host ability to resist infection or the
viral genetic changes with replication, have continued for 27 plus years without
immunodeficiency (reviewed in Gorry, et al, 2007; Zaunders, et al, 2011). Three
individuals, including the donor, with 17 plus years of infection, became
phenotypic “revertants” and progressed to AIDS (Gorry, et al, 2007).
These “revertant” viral genetic changes enabled identification of a “locus for
apoptosis”. Reanalysis using the GenBank data of the viral sequences and
alignment with the HIV antisense gene (GenBank CQ767337) showed a specific
region of the Hap antisense RNA was involved in the evolution of the viral

changes over time (abbreviated and summarized in Figure 3). The SBBC original
deletion would abrogate formation of a primary microRNA-like structure (MORT)
in the antisense gene RNA, whereas the revertant D36, C54, and C98 viral
species regained sequence necessary for hairpin formation (Figures 1, 3A, 3B,
and 4). In this process, these revertant viral species thereby regained sequence
that would enable formation of an antisense sncRNA already identified in HIVinfected cells (Althaus, et al, 2012). We must stress that no laboratory
experiment or set of experiments could possibly duplicate this “experiment of
nature” with the study of HIV-1 virus replicating (and mutating) in vivo over 17plus years within the human hosts, along with their progression to AIDS.
A role for regulatory sncRNAs in HIV
Some have proposed HIV-1 regulatory RNAs or microRNAs, all originating from
the sense HIV-1 RNA strand (Ouellet, et al, 2008; Omoto, et al, 2004; Klase, et
al, 2007; Bennasser, et al, 2004, Harwig, et al, 2016, Ouellet, et al 2013), whilst
others have found this unlikely (Whisnant, et al, 2013; Lin and Cullen, 2007;
Pfeffer, et al, 2005, reviewed in Balasubramaniam, et al, 2018,). The argument
that no retroviral miRNAs are made because cleavage by Drosha leads to
degradation of the primary-miRNA precursor, which would also be the HIV
genomic RNA, (Whisnant, et al 2013) assumes transcription occurs only in the
sense direction. This argument would not apply to Hap antisense strand RNA
encoding the HIVaINR antisense (HAA) miRNAs 1,2, and 3 previously proposed
(Ludwig, 2008), nor to the MORT primary miRNA-like structure, proposed herein
(Figure 4). Figure S1B shows the contribution of HIV strain differences to MORT
252-363 hairpin sequence and inferred stability, which may have a bearing on
different laboratories seeing different results. For instance, visual inspection of
readily available HIV laboratory isolates (of B subtype sequences) revealed that
some of the strains commonly used, when compared to HIV antisense gene
sequence (CQ767337), had alterations as follows: LAI was nearly identical,
HXB2 had 4 mutations (m) in the primary MORT hairpin and 9 m in antisense
gene, SF2: 6 m in MORT; 19 m in antisense gene, NY5: 9 m in MORT; 26 m in
antisense gene, and NL4-3: 13 m in MORT and 30 mutations in the HIV
antisense gene (HIV sequence database compendium 1995
(https://www.hiv.lanl.gov)). Strain sequence differences in the primary MORT
hairpin make it apparent that the capacity to base-pair in the stem and form a
stable precursor miRNA, and therefore MORT miRNA would be affected,
particularly for NL4-3 (see Figure S1B).
The Hap gene is unique and unlike the ASP (Miller, 1988; Michaels, et al, 1994;
Landry, et al, 2007; Cassan, et al, 2016). Hap has protein(s) encoded within the
LTR (not the Env region of the DNA), and antisense RNA begins off the HIVaINR
in TAR region DNA and terminates within the U3 region (Ludwig, et al, 2006;
Ludwig, 2008, Figure S1C)). We had previously proposed this represents an
intrinsic RNA regulatory system for the virus (see U.S. patent 5,919,677, Figures
1 and 2, filed in 1997, issued in 1999, also Ludwig, 2008). Others have found the
retrovirus, bovine leukemia virus (BLV), utilizes RNA polymerase III to transcribe

subgenomic transcripts encoding its miRNAs, demonstrating an alternative
mechanism that avoids genomic RNA alterations (Kincaid, et al, 2012).
We strongly believe that HIV-1 does make si/miRNAs but that this has been
missed for a variety of reasons based on strain, timing, and perhaps also
packaging (see hypothesis below). HIV-1 strain as well as changes that are
incurred by growth of isolates in vitro have been shown to have an impact on cell
mortality. Thus, viral microRNAs that impact cell mortality should be looked for
within hours, not days, when utilizing cells or cell lines (Peden, et al, 1991,
Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008). This notion of early apoptosis with HIV
infection is also suggested by studies showing that the CD4+ T cell half-life is 24
hours in vivo (Simon and Ho, 2003). Despite the original observations for small,
regulatory RNAs acting as antisense translational repressors for developmental
transitions in worm larvae in the C. elegans system (Lee and Ambros, 2001),
only a few studies have looked for antisense sncRNA in HIV-1 (Althaus, et al,
2012, Schopman, et al, 2012). Yet, with pre-selection for HIV-1 sequences in
either strand orientation, the yield of viral vs human sncRNAs was greatly
enhanced: 892 individual HIV-1sncRNAs with the selection strategy (Althaus, et
al, 2012) as opposed to 125 viral sncRNA clones amongst 47,773 human clones
(Yeung, et al, 2009). In addition, the JR-FL strain was utilized to select for small
sense and antisense HIV-1 RNAs in HIV-infected cells, and HIV-1 small RNAs
were found, including a small antisense 22 nt RNA (Seq. No. 208) mapping
exactly to the 5p hairpin region corresponding to MORT 274-295 (Althaus, et al,
2012) (diagrammed in Figure 5A, Figure S1B). This represents the identical
region regained (274-284) in revertant SP viruses D36, C54, and C98 (Figures 3,
4, 5A) as the individuals progressed to AIDS.
We believe these studies point the finger at MORT, a primary microRNA-like
structure found within the Hap antisense RNA (Figure 4), and suggest a
mechanism for the early apoptotic death observed in CD4+ T cells (and
surrounding bystander cells). The potential for target sites for MORT mi/siRNA in
the genes or RNAs of multiple human genes (Figure 5, Table 1, Figure S6), as
well as inhibitor of apoptosis protein genes/mRNAs such as X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and apollon (Figures S2, S4, S5) require further
analysis. The homology to human microRNA segments also implicates the
primary MORT hairpin as an RNA regulator (Figures 5B, S3). Studies to
elucidate the potential for MORT as an RNA antagonist for the inhibitor of
apoptosis protein(s) mRNAs might prove useful for future cancer therapeutics
and/or the issue of HIV-1 latency.
MORT, a mechanism to kill cancer utilizing apoptosis pathways?
Other viruses have been shown to have genes that impact their host cell survival
and apoptosis pathways (Clem, et al, 1991; Birnbaum, et al, 1994; Crook, et al,
1993; Clem and Miller, 1994). The baculovirus p35, Cp-IAP and Op-IAP genes
encode proteins that function as viral inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) (Clem, et al,
1991; Birnbaum, et al, 1994; Crook, et al, 1993; Clem and Miller, 1994). The
shared sequence of the Baculovirus Inhibitor of apoptosis-Repeat (BIR) domains

was utilized to search for and identify homolog IAPs in other species, including
drosophila and humans (Duckett, et al ,1996).
The link between evasion of apoptosis and cancer has been appreciated for a
long time (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011).
Cancer results as cells acquire genes that lead not only to aberrant cellular
proliferation, but also resistance to apoptosis. In this regard, it is interesting that
potential targets of MORT include X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (X-IAP), Apollon,
and the survivin gene/mRNA (Figure 5C). Survivin appears at the crossroads of
at least three mammalian homeostatic networks: control of mitosis, the cellular
stress response, and the regulation of apoptosis (Altieri, 2013). The inhibitor of
apoptosis (IAP) family contain several members that appear to play significant
roles in cancer, with antagonists of IAPs representing a modality for cancer
therapy in humans (Finlay, et al, 2017). With specific targeting to cancer cells
(instead of T cells), perhaps this MORT region of the HIV antisense gene might
prove useful as a RNA tool against the IAP proteins that are up-regulated in
cancer.
Hypothesis: What if HIV-1 utilizes the exosome generation pathway to
move Dicer, Ago, and primary/precursor/miRNAs, including MORT, in
“RNA grenade” packages to be released against attacking immune cells or
invading micro-organisms, including other viruses?
It has long been known that human cells release exosomes, which are less than
150 nm in diameter and consist of a variety of proteins and nucleic acids
protected by a lipid bilayer (reviewed in Hessvik, N P, et al, 2018). Valadi, et al.,
2007 showed that an array of microRNAs and mRNAs released by exosomes
were then taken up and functioned within recipient cells. Cancer cells can
release exosomes that contain Dicer, Ago 2, and TAR-RNA binding protein
(TRBP) along with pre-microRNAs. These exosomes display cell-independent
ability to process pre-miRNAs into miRNAs (Melo, S.A., et al., 2014). Thus,
cancer cells already demonstrate that exosomal release and up-take into other
cells can reprogram target cell transcriptome(s) (Melo, S.A., et al, 2014). This
would be a remarkably efficient mechanism whereby an HIV-1-infected cell could
mediate changes and genetic exchange with surrounding bystander cells.
MORT pre-miRNA or mi/siRNAs, prepackaged with the RISC-loading complex
proteins Dicer, TRBP, and Ago within the exosome, and then released and
taken-up by recipient cells could facilitate the bystander CD4+ T cell/other
immune cell death observed with HIV infection. The bulk of cells induced to die
are the surrounding “bystander” cells (Finkel, et al, 1995) and may represent
surrounding host cells specifically responding to HIV infection (CD4+ T cells,
cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells). We do not know the contribution of Hap gene
proteins or other HIV proteins to an exosomal-mediated process, but MORT
miRNA acting as an antagonist to IAP mRNAs via the RNA interference or
silencing pathways within cells could provide an explanation for the rapid
apoptotic cell death observed following introduction of a recombinant vector
containing the 252-363 MORT hairpin (Figures 2, 4, 5, S1). If the RISC loading

complex is associated early with MORT, packaged into late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVB), fused with the plasma membrane, and released as
exosomes, these associated miRNAs made by HIV may prove more difficult to
detect by standard methods.
This provides some insight into the inability to develop effective protective
immunity to HIV: if the surrounding, bystander immune cells (CD4 + T cell,
dendritic cell, etc.) that can recognize specific HIV epitopes in context of MHC
are killed off before they can even proliferate and amplify the immune response?
Viruses are great imitators and scavengers. If a host cell genetic element can be
implemented to further viral advantage, it often will be. Thus, it is not a surprise
that HIV-1 has “borrowed” genetic elements (including portions of MORT) from its
human host (Figure 5, Supplemental Table 1, Figure S6). However, it is more
puzzling to observe the shared homologies between the HIV antisense gene Hap
and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5D) Seven sites with between 11/11 to 13/15 nt +/+ or
+/- were identified by nBLAST (Figures 3, 5D). Two of the sites in Hap with
complementary sequence to SARS-CoV-2 are directed to the same region in
SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (protease) RNA (Figure 5Da,b). The protease nsp5 is
responsible for cutting much of the SARS-CoV-2 orf1ab polyprotein gene product
(Chan, J F-W, et al, 2020). Shared sequence between two viruses related to the
novel coronavirus (human SARS, and Bat coronavirus), reveal an interesting
pattern. Both Bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but not human SARS, could be
targeted within their orf1ab RNA by the HIV-1 antisense gene MORT 271- 287
region mi/siRNA. However an alternate sequence in SARS is targeted
corresponding to the Spike protein gene/mRNA (Figure 5D). The extensive (17
bp) complementary region between HIV-1 MORT and SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 mRNA
immediately suggests an RNA silencing method for use against the novel
coronavirus-2019. Why not use what cancer exosomes have taught us to
manufacture a RNA therapy: a MORT-mi/siRNA:Ago “slicer” against the nsp5
mRNA protease (protein dicer)? In addition, the “RNA therapy” exosomes could
incorporate specific targeting molecules such as SPIKE antibody (Fab2) so as to
only kill SARS-CoV-2- infected cells?
Here, we propose a strategy and/or functional mechanism for HIV-1 to have
evolved a death-inducing “regulatory” RNA or MORT. Viruses are not only
opportunistic, but they are “selfish”. When they take over cellular functions to
replicate, they turn off cellular functions for intrinsic cellular use. They may also
grab opportunities to prevent any outside intervention either from immune attack
or other micro-organisms (such as viruses) that also want to use the cell or cell
programs to replicate.

The following reagents and cell lines were obtained through the AIDS Research
and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: the HL2/3 cell
line containing stably integrated copies of the HIV-1 molecular clone HXB2/3gpt
from Drs. Barbara K Felber and George N. Pavlakis (Felber and Pavlakis, 1988;
Ciminale, et al, 1990); HeLa, a human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line from
Dr. Richard Axel (Maddon, et al, 1986), Clone69T1RevEnv from Dr. Joseph
Dougherty (Yu, et al, 1996) and pHIV-CAT from Drs. Gary Nabel and Neil
Perkins (Nabel and Baltimore, 1987). pHIV-CAT was used to amplify by PCR the
desired U3-R sequences for cloning of HAP-FLAG, and the HIV-1 sequences are
derived from the original French isolate BRU, also called LAV strain (WainHobson, et al, 1991). Clone 69T1RevEnv was a selected clone from the
transfection of HeLa-derived HtTa-1 with T1RevEnv, and could be induced to
express HIV-1 Rev and Env proteins by removal of tetracycline from the culture
medium (Yu, et al, 1996). HeLa and Clone 69T1RevEnv were used as control
cell lines for HL2/3 (Felber and Pavlakis, 1988; Ciminale, et al, 1990) in these
experiments. HL2/3 was selected for high-level production of Gag, Env, Tat,
Rev, and Nef proteins, but did not produce detectable reverse transcriptase or
mature virions (Felber and Pavlakis, 1988; Ciminale, et al, 1990). All cell lines
were maintained and propagated in cell cultures as recommended by the
contributor.
The HIV-1 antisense gene sequences corresponding to SEQ ID 27 nt 14-367 of
U.S. patents 7700725, 7700726, and 8765461, and European patent 1359221
(GenBank accession number CQ767337) were directionally cloned into the
mammalian expression vector pCMVTag 4a with a carboxyterminal FLAG
epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) (HAP-FLAG), as previously described (Ludwig, et al,
2006; Ludwig, 2008). The HIV antisense gene sequence and orientation were
confirmed by sequencing. The pCMVTag4a (GenBank accession number
AF073000) and pCMVTag 4 expression control plasmid containing the firefly
luciferase gene fused with the FLAG tag (luc-FLAG) were obtained from
Stratagene. The plasmid 15cxCAT contained the interleukin-2 (IL-2) enhancer
and promoter driving the CAT gene and was a kind gift from Dr. Gerald R.
Crabtree (Durand, et al, 1988).
Transfections of HeLa (Maddon, et al, 1986), Clone69T1RevEnv (Yu, et al,
1996), and HL2/3 (Felber and Pavlakis, 1988; Ciminale, et al, 1990) with HAPFLAG and the control vectors, pCMVTag4 (luc-FLAG) and p15cxCAT (IL-2-CAT)
were performed simultaneously with identical transfectam and solution reagent
concentrations, as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene) and as
previously described in detail (Ludwig, et al, 2006). The same number of each
cell type (5 x 105 cells) were plated in four 6-well plates with coverslips (within the
wells), grown overnight at 37 C, 5%CO2 and then underwent transfection four
ways (transfectam solution alone, or with either HAP-FLAG, IL-2CAT or lucFLAG vectors). Coverslips were removed from 6-well plates, transferred to 95%
ethanol, and then mounted on superfrost slides using cytoseal 60. After drying
ON, they either were submitted for H&E staining or immunoperoxidase staining,
as previously described (Ludwig, et al, 2006).

Analysis of apoptosis
Slides were surveyed at low power, then three areas selected for closer analysis
and counting (400x total magnification). Numbers represent data presented as
mean +/- SEM of three counts per hpf. The pathologist was unaware of
experimental conditions while performing this analysis. Histologically, apoptosis
is characterized by condensation and hyperchromasia of the cell’s nucleus,
followed by nuclear fragmentation and cell shrinkage. The nucleus and
cytoplasm eventually break apart into fragments called “apoptotic bodies” which
are eventually phagocytized by mononuclear cells (Kerr, et al, 1972).

Figure 1. Indications that a specific HIV-1 genetic locus contributes to cell
death.
A. Lindemann, et al, 1994 showed that the HIV-1 BRU nef and long terminal
repeat (LTR) genetic sequences linked to a mouse T cell receptor (TCR) beta
chain promoter and mouse TCR beta chain core enhancer were sufficient to
induce a phenotype of severe combined immunodeficiency and T cell loss in
mice incorporating the transgene. Remarkably, their transgene construct
rearranged in vivo, such that the B6/338L transgenic mouse locus had the mouse
TCR enhancer downstream of the mouse TCR promoter linked to the HIV-1 BRU
sequences. This situated the region of the HIV antisense gene (HIVasgene)
within the LTR close to the enhancer elements (which can function in either
direction). The HIV-1 BRU sequence (Genbank accession number K02013)
(Wain-Hobson, et al, 1985) used in their construct is 99% identical to the
corresponding region of the HIVas gene used in constructing the HAP-FLAG
vector, previously described (Genbank accession number CQ767337) (Ludwig,
et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008).
B. The HIV-1 nef and LTR sequences obtained from virus isolated from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three long-term survivors who became
progressors was aligned using BLAST and visual inspection (Blastn suite) on the
NCBI website (National Center for Biotechnology Information), U.S. National
Library of Medicine) with sequences from HIV-1 BRU (Genbank K02013) (WainHobson, et al, 1985) and the HIV antisense gene sequence 27 (from U.S.
patents 7700725, 7700726, and 8765461, and European patent 1359221
(Genbank CQ767337)) (Ludwig, et al, 2006; Ludwig, 2008). Black blocks
represent intact sequence, gaps represent deletions, and grey blocks show
altered/duplicated enhancer regions. The Sydney Blood Bank Cohort (SBBC)
individuals who became progressors are shown, including the original blood
donor who was infected in 1980 (D36) and blood recipients C98 and C54, who
received blood transfusions in 1982 and 1984, respectively (Gorry, et al, 2007).
The HIV-1 nef/LTR sequence data is from GenBank accession numbers: D36
1995 (U37271, sequence 1-513 (Deacon, et al, 1995)), D36 1997 (DQ287274,
sequence 1-505 (Churchill, et al, 2006)), C98 1993 (DQ287304, sequence 1-587
(Churchill, et al, 2006)), C98 1998 (DQ287309, sequence 1-483 (Churchill, et al,
2006)), C54 1993 (DQ287288, sequence 1-605 (Churchill, et al, 2006)), and C54
2001 (DQ287295, sequence 1-452 (Churchill, et al, 2006). With C54 2001
between sequence 200-452 there is complete duplication of the HIV-1
enhancer/promoter region, including the HIV antisense initiator (two reverse
arrows). The original common SBBC deletion of nef aa 162-177, corresponding
to BRU sequence 8873-8920 is indicated throughout by the blue filled rectangle
(Greenway, et al, 1998). The alignment is not to scale.

Figure 2. HIV antisense gene sequences incorporated into a recombinant vector
produce RNA and protein(s) and induce apoptosis. (See also supplemental
Figure S1.)
A. Recombinant HIV-1 antisense gene sequences linked to a carboxy-terminal
FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) (HAP-FLAG (Ludwig, et al, 2006)) were
transfected into three separate cell lines and increased cell death (apoptosis)
over cells transfected with control gene sequences (magnification 400X).
Identical starting numbers (5 x 105) of HL2/3 cells (Felber and Pavlakis, 1988;
Ciminale, et al, 1990), HeLa cells (Maddon, et al, 1986) and Clone69T1RevEnv
cells (induced to express Rev and Env by the withdrawal of tetracycline (Yu, et
al, 1996)) were cultured in 6-well plates with cover slips, stabilized overnight, and
then transfected with either the recombinant HIV-1 antisense gene-FLAG vector
(HAP-FLAG) (Ludwig, et al, 2006), the interleukin 2 enhancer-CAT vector
(Durand, et al, 1988) or the control luciferase-FLAG vector (Stratagene), as
indicated. The cells were incubated 18 hours, then the coverslips with cells
removed, fixed in 95% alcohol, placed on slides and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H & E).
A surgical pathologist, who was unaware of the experimental conditions,
independently assessed slides and counted apoptotic cells per high power field
(hpf). Apoptotic cells/hpf were as follows, SEM for 3 counts: For HeLa (HAPFLAG: 4.3 +/-0.6; IL-2 –CAT: 1.7+/-0.6: luc-FLAG: 1.7+/-1.5); for Clone
69T1RevEnv (HAP-FLAG: 10.3 +/-4.5; IL-2-CAT 1.3 +/-0.6; luc-FLAG 1.3 +/1.5); for HL2/3 cells (HAP-FLAG 8.3 +/- 2.5; IL-2 CAT 3+/-2.6; luc-FLAG: 4.7 +/2.9). Mitotic figures can be observed (see middle slide, HL2/3 transfected with
p15cxCAT control).
B. Duplicate sets of Hela cells (as above) were transfected with HAP-FLAG, or
control vectors p15cxCAT or pCMVTag, (as indicated) under identical
experimental conditions. Following (early) removal of coverslips from 6-well
plates, and fixing as above, they were either incubated with monoclonal antibody
to FLAG (+ Ab) or no Ab (- Ab), followed by immunoperoxidase staining for HAPFLAG detection (Ludwig, et al, 2006).

Figure 3.

sequence is regained in a specific locus of the HIV antisense gene seq 27
(CQ767337) nt 274-284 ( a genetic deletion originally shared by all the SBBC
donor and recipient viruses) while nef sequence is progressively lost.
The D36 and shared SBBC early deletion is indicated in red type (blue shading)
(X). The GenBank accession numbers are as indicated in Figure 1B, with the

sequence for each individual SP is indicated in brackets. Sequences are shown
from the beginning (HIVaINR start site) to the end of HIV antisense gene, with
the exception of the duplicated enhancer regions (diagrammed in gray blocks in
Figure 1B). Previously proposed HAAmiRNAs 1, 2, and 3 are underlined (Ludwig
2008). The region corresponding to the primary MORT RNA hairpin structure is
indicated ( ***). Potential Dicer cuts (double-underlined) of dsRNA are indicated
at 21 nt intervals (Ludwig 2008). Sites identical (forward blue arrow) or
complementary to (backward blue arrow) SARS-CoV-2 RNA (CO) are indicated
and were obtained by NCBI nBLAST comparison between CQ767337 and
MT007544.1 (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate
Australia/VIC01/2020). Seven sites with identities between 11/11 to 14/15 nt
were identified and are shown with arrows.

B. MORT phylogeny of slow progressor (D36, C98, and C54) and elite nonprogressor (C49, C64) SBBC sequences compared to MORT sequence 252-363
following BLASTn alignment (NCBI). GenBank accession numbers for each
sequence is indicated below tree.

Figure 4. Mfold (Zuker, 2003; Markham and Zuker, 2008) analysis of the HIV
antisense gene sequence 27 (CQ767337) reveals a 33 bp hairpin structure from
nt 252-363 resembling a primary microRNA structure. The original D36 deletion
is indicated in red, with the region of change in later sequence (D36.1997) in
purple. We are calling this 33 bp hairpin structure MORT.

Figure 5. MORT includes characteristics of a microRNA precursor, with
conservation across the M clades, sites of homology with human microRNAs,
and diverse potential human and viral targets, including SARS-CoV-2.
A. There is conservation across HIV-1 clades A-J in regions of MORT that would
require base-pairing between the 5p (5 prime) and 3p (3 prime) sides of a
precursor microRNA structure, but less conservation in less related species,
especially notable in HIV-2, A, B, and G (labeled 2AGW, 2B.C1, and 2G.AB)
(Kuiken, et al, 2001). A previously identified small noncoding antisense RNA
found in HIV-infected cells (Althaus, et al, 2012) is indicated in turquoise below
the CQ767337 sequence and suggests where Drosha cuts on the 5p side. An
example of the intrinsic antisense RNA (identical to CQ767337) made “in vitro” is
shown in supplemental Figure S1A, S1B, S1C.
B. MirGeneDB (Fromm, et al, 2015) shows that there is significant identity of
MORT on the 5p and 3p sides with human microRNAs. MORT 270-303 shares
homology regions with seven human microRNAs; MORT 318-350 with three
human microRNAs (identical sequence underlined). The presumed mature

C. BLAST comparison using NCBI website (National Center for Biotechnology
Information; U.S. National Library of Medicine) of MORT 271-300 (GenBank
CQ767337) with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins survivin (GenBank U75285), and
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP): GenBank accession NG_007264.
D36.1997 MORT (GenBank DQ 287274) also has sites of identity with XIAP. See
supplemental Figures S2, S4, S5, which includes additional BLAST against
Apollon (BIRC 6; NC 000002.12, with 705 matches).
D BLAST comparison using NCBI website (National Center for Biotechnology
Information; U.S. National Library of Medicine) of the HIV antisense gene
sequence (GenBank accession CQ767337) with SARS (GenBank accession
NC004718) and SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession NC045512, MT007544)
reveals interaction at disparate sites. Several of the Hap gene RNA
complementary sites are directed to the same region in SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 RNA
(a and b). The MORT region RNA complementary to SARS is instead directed to
the SPIKE protein RNA.

Blast Tree View
This tree was produced using BLAST pairwise alignments. more...

BLAST computes a pairwise alignment between a query and the database sequences searched. It does not explicitly compute an alignment between the different database sequences (i.e., does not perform a
multiple alignment). For purposes of this sequence tree presentation an implicit alignment between the database sequences is constructed, based upon the alignment of those (database) sequences to the query.
It may often occur that two database sequences align to different parts of the query, so that they barely overlap each other or do not overlap at all. In that case it is not possible to calculate a distance between
these two sequences and only the higher scoring sequence is included in the tree.

D.b. The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 (nonstructural protein 5: protease
responsible for multiple maturation cleavage events of the replicase polyprotein
in coronaviruses (Chan, J F-W, et al, 2020) could be targeted by two sites of the
HIVas gene RNA. The sites share sequence with sncRNA seq#208 (Althaus, et al.,
2012) isolated from HIV-infected cells.
