Abstract

26

SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging with potential increased transmissibility highlighting the great unmet

27

medical need for new therapies. Niclosamide is a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent that has advanced in

28

clinical development. We validate the potent antiviral efficacy of niclosamide in a SARS-CoV-2 human

29

airway model. Furthermore, niclosamide is effective against the D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Our

30

data further support the potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of niclosamide and highlights its great potential

31

as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19.

Main Body

37

Since its emerge in 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

38

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to over 3.1 million deaths worldwide as of April 26, 2021 (1).

39

A tremendous joint research effort led to the approval of several vaccines at unprecedented speed yet anti-

40

viral treatment options remain limited. At the same time, several viral variants harboring mutations in the

41

N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein gene, such as the B.1.1.7 (also

42

named 20I/501Y.V1), B.1.351 (also named 20H/501Y.V2) variants, are causing global concern as they have

43

been associated with enhanced transmissibility and possible resistance to vaccines and antibody

44

neutralization (2–6). The B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages have been linked to a ~50% increased transmission

45

of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the vaccine efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has been reported to be reduced

46

to 10.4% against the B.1.351 variant (6–9). Thus, despite the recent vaccine roll-out, there remains a high

47

unmet need for novel therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, which should be effective against circulating and

48

potentially emerging variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2.

49
50

Niclosamide has been identified as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo and its optimized

51

formulation for intranasal application and inhalation, was well-tolerated in healthy volunteers in a Phase 1

52

trial (10–13). Herein, we sought to further characterize the anti-viral properties of niclosamide by

53

determining its potency in a human epithelial airway model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and tested its efficacy

54

against several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2.

55
56

To strengthen the existing data on the potent antiviral activity of niclosamide with a preclinical model

57

resembling the human respiratory tract, we employed a trans-well bronchial human airway epithelium

58

(HAE) model infected with SARS-CoV-2. HAE cultured at an airway-liquid interface has been extensively

59

used as an in vitro physiological model mimicking the human mucociliary airway epithelium to validate the

60

effectivity of antivirals on infections in conducting airways (14–16). The effect of niclosamide on the

61

replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the HAE bronchial model (Eptihelix) was determined as previously described

62

by Touret et al. (17) and Pizzorno et al. (14).

63

Briefly, human bronchial epithelial cells were apically infected with the European D614G strain of SARS-

64

CoV-2 (BavPat1/2020; obtained from EVA-GLOBAL) at a MOI of 0.1 and cultivated in basolateral media

65

that contained different concentrations of niclosamide (in duplicates) or no drug (virus control) for up to 4

66

days. Media was renewed daily containing fresh niclosamide. Remdesivir was used as experimental positive

67

control and non-treated samples as negative control. On day 4, samples were collected at the apical side and

68

the viral titer was estimated with a TCID50 assay. Then, cells were lysed, and the intracellular viral RNA

69

was extracted and quantified by qRT-PCR. The viral inhibition was calculated with the infectious titers by

70

normalizing the response, having the bottom value as 100% and top value as 0%. The IC50 was determined

71

using logarithmic interpolation (Y=100/(1+10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope) in GraphPad Prims 7. Statistical

72

analysis was performed using the Ordinary One-way Anova with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test.

73
74

Niclosamide exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by reducing the infectious titer and intracellular RNA

75

levels in the HAE model in a dose-responsive manner. Niclosamide treatment with concentrations ≥ 1 µM

76

significantly reduced the infectious titer to below the level of detection at Day 4 post-infection, yielding an

77

IC50 of 0.96 µM (Fig. 1A and 1C). Furthermore, treatment with concentrations ≥ 1 µM of niclosamide

78

significantly reduced the intracellular viral RNA level reaching a maximum effect of a 3-fold reduction on

79

Day 4 (Fig. 1B). These data validate the substantial anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of niclosamide in a

80

reconstituted human airway model.

81
82

We then tested the activity of niclosamide against several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2, including

83

the BavPat1 strain (D614G), SARS-CoV-2 201/501YV.1 (UVE/SARS-CoV-2/2021/FR/7b; lineage

84

B.1.1.7, ex UK), SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan D614, and SARS CoV-2 SA lineage B.1.351 (UVE/SARS-CoV-

85

2/2021/FR/1299-ex SA) in VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells (ID 100978, CFAR). All viruses were obtained through

86

EVA GLOBAL. The IC50 were determined by RT-qPCR as previously described by Touret et al. (18).

87

Briefly, eight 2-fold serial dilutions of niclosamide in triplicate were added to the cells 15 min prior to viral

88

infection and incubated for 2 days at 37°C. Remdesivir was used as experimental positive control and non-

89

treated samples as negative control. The viral genome was quantified by real-time RT-qPCR from the cell

90

supernatant (17). The IC50 was calculated as described above. All data associated with this study are present

91

in the paper.

92
93

Niclosamide inhibited replication of the SARS-CoV-2 original strain (Wuhan D614) in VeroE6 TMPRSS2

94

cells with an IC50 of 0.13µM and IC90 of 0.16 µM which is in accordance with previous studies (10, 11).

95

Importantly, niclosamide also blocked the replication of the European BavPat D614G, UK B.1.1.7 and SA

96

B.1.351 variant with an IC50 of 0.06 µM, 0.08 µM and 0.07 µM, respectively (Fig. 2). Thus, niclosamide is

97

effective against all tested variants of SARS-CoV-2 having a similar potency across the different strains

98

compared to the original Wuhan D614 strain.

99
100

These data are in line with the host-targeted mode of action of niclosamide, which has been described to

101

interfere with basic cellular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication, such as autophagy, the

102

endosomal pathway and the TMEM16A chloride channel (11, 19–21). Accordingly, niclosamide is a potent

103

antiviral therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The molecule will also deserve further

104

investigations to assess its potential role in the chemotherapeutic armamentarium required for future

105

emerging infectious disease preparedness.

106
107

Taken together, our findings support niclosamide’s therapeutic potential as a potent anti-viral agent against

108

SARS-CoV-2, including its variants of concern. Trials in patients with COVID-19 are needed to substantiate

109

future clinical use.
