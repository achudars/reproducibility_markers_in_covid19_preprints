Abstract
At present, the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global threat to
human health and hence demands united research activities at different levels. Finding
appropriate cell systems for drug screening and testing molecular interactions of the
virus with the host cell is mandatory for drug development and understanding the
mechanisms of viral entry and replication. For this, we selected human cell lines
represented in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on RNA-seq data
determined transcript levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two membrane proteins that have
been identified to aid SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. mRNA and protein
expression of these host factors were verified via RQ-PCR and western blot. We then
tested permissiveness of these cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytopathic
effect, and viral replication finding limited correlation between receptor expression and
infectability. One of the candidate cancer cell lines, the human colon cancer cell line
CL-14, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data argue that SARS-CoV-2 in
vitro infection models need careful selection and validation since ACE2/TMPRSS2
receptor expression on its own does not guarantee permissiveness to the virus.

Author summary
In the midst of the pandemic outbreak of corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for
disease treatment are still to be tested and the virus-host-interactions are to be
elucidated. Drug testing and viral studies are commonly conducted with genetically
manipulated cells. In order to find a cell model system without genetic modification we

screened human cell lines for two proteins known to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. We
confirmed and quantified permissiveness of current cell line infection models, but
dismissed a number of receptor-positive cell lines that did not support viral replication.
Importantly, ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression seems to be necessary for viral entry but is
not sufficient to predict permissiveness of various cancer cell lines. Moreover, the
expression of specific splice variants and the absence of missense mutations of the host
factors might hint on successful infection and virus replication of the cell lines.

Introduction

1

It is of no debate that the overcoming of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 pathogen spreading
across the continents urgently needs joint efforts in the scientific community. Within a
few months in the midst of spring 2020 the pandemia is accompanied with a high case
fatality rate of up to 20% for vulnerable risk groups [1] and high excess mortality in
Europe monitored by EuroMOMO (https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps) [2].
To date no specific antiviral treatment to SARS-CoV-2 has been approved not to
mention vaccine treatment. However, promising antiviral drugs such as remdesivir [3],
camostat [4], and potential vaccines such as mRNA-1273 [5] are underway. Still, as long
as no clinically proven drugs and vaccines are at hand, screening and testing of potential
drugs is a major part of the current global research effort as well as studying the
molecular mechanisms of viral entry to the host cell. To this, our contribution to the
scientific progress is to validate human cell lines of the Leibniz Institute DSMZ for their
permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2. Cell lines serve as valuable and valid model systems to
study different diseases [6, 7] and have been used specifically for SARS-CoV-2 viral
entry [4, 8] or for antiviral activities against this virus [9]. Particularly the two surface
proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been shown to contribute to viral binding and
processing [4, 8] and are mainly expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells [10].
Interestingly, high gene expression of ACE2 is shown for other tissues such as myocardial
cells, esophagus epithelial cells, and enterocytes, which may hint at COVID-19 patients,
infected by SARS-CoV-2, exhibiting non-respiratory symptoms [11–14].
Here, in order to get hold of human cell lines helpful for SARS-CoV-2 studies, we
examined human cell lines with comparably high gene expression of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. The rich resource Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) provided publicly
available RNA-Seq data [15], which we screened for human cell lines expressing high
levels of these two surface proteins. Selected cell lines were picked for validation on
mRNA and protein levels and tested for the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect these cells.
With these cell lines we devise appropriate, non-overexpression cell model systems to
facilitate experimental SARS-CoV-2 work, further the understanding of viral entry and
support drug development.

Selection of cell model systems

32

Inspired by the publication of Hoffmann et al. pinpointing the host factors ACE2 as
SARS-CoV-2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as viral S protein priming serine protease [4], we
sought for identifying human cell lines enriched for these two proteins. Fortunately, the
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) provides large-scale sequencing data including
mRNA-seq expression data for over 900 cell lines [15]. Screening for gene expression of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in this data set enabled us to identify potential susceptible cell
cultures prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At first, we selected for 301 human cell lines
readily in stock at the DSMZ cell lines repository and visualised gene expression of

ACE2, which was shown to be the cellular receptor for the viral S protein [16], and
TMPRSS2 known to cleave SARS-CoV S protein [17] (Fig 1A). Gene expression for
these two proteins differed between and within the various tumour entities. Of these cell
lines, the colon carcinoma cell lines CL-14 and CL-40 and the breast carcinoma cell line
HCC-1937 belonged to the top 15 ACE2 expressing cell lines along with high expression
for TMPRSS2 (Table 1). Since the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract shows a
high virus replication in vivo [18], we additionally selected the tongue squamous cell
carcinoma cell lines CAL-27 and CAL-33, the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell
line KYSE-510, and the newly established oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines
UPCI-SCC-074 and UPCI-SCC-131. Since the lung carcinoma cell lines Caco-2, Calu-3
and the green monkey kidney cell line Vero E6 are shown to be permissive for
SARS-CoV-2 [4, 8], these were used as positive control cell lines.
Of note, gene expression of different splice variants of the ACE2 protein became
evident comparing the read numbers of the exons as seen in the CCLE RNA-seq data
for CAL-27, CAL-33 and KYSE-510 (Fig 1B). Furthermore, missense mutations were
detected in TMPRSS2 for CL-40, HCC-1937, CAL-33 and Calu-3 (Fig 1C). We assume
that these variations may have a considerable effect on the virus-host interaction.
Recently published data suggest, that cells need interferon stimulation to produce
ACE2, thereby changing the cell’s permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 and hinting on the
dynamic levels of this host factor [19] [20].
All selected cell lines exhibited marked ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression
according to CCLE data or/and RQ-PCR (Table 1 and Fig 2A). Beside qualitative
verification for mRNA expression via RNA-Seq data and RQ-PCR (Fig 2A) protein
occurrence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was confirmed via western blot (Fig 2B).

No co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found in the LL-100 data set, another
data set which comprises RNA-seq and WES data of 100 human leukemia and
lymphoma cell lines [6] (Table S1). This is reflected in the CCLE results, in which cell
lines of the hematopoetic lineages exhibited lower gene expression of both genes
compared to other cell lines of different origin (see Fig 1A, DLBC, LCLL and MM
tumour entities).
The presence of the viral host factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cell lines of various
origins is in accordance to previously published data, where ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were
detected in cells from multiple tissues including respiratory tract, esophagus and
colon [21] [22] [14] [12] and virus entry was evidenced in gastro-intestinal tissues [23].

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and permissiveness

75

Receptor ACE2 and surface proteinase TMPRSS2 have been shown to play a key role
for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Whether their co-expression is sufficient to allow entry
and whether alternative receptors may exist is still under debate. In order to shed light
on infectivity and permissiveness of the appointed cell lines in context of their
ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression, we subjected cells to experimental infection with wildtype
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Three key parameters of viral infection were quantified: cytopathic
effect (CPE), a hallmark of lytic coronavirus infections, viral gene expression, and
production of infectious viral progeny.
CPE summarizes a plethora of mechanisms accompanied with lytic viral infection
that can be quantified as loss of confluence in cell culture due to cell death [24]. Using
time-resolved phase contrast imaging of infected cell lines, we determined time course
and extent of SARS-CoV-2-mediated CPE for the cell lines CAL-27, CAL-33, CL-14,
CL-40, HCC-1937, KYSE-510, UPCI-SCC-074, and UPCI-SCC-131 (Fig 3A, Fig 3B,
data not shown). Cell confluence was reduced after infection for CL-14, Vero E6, and
Calu-3 in accordance with previously published data for SARS-CoV [4, 8, 25] and data
made available in pre-print [26]. The results show a clear onset of decreasing confluence
from two days post infection in Vero E6 cells, the most commonly used cell line to
experimentally generate SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks. The same was observed for the lung
cancer cell line Calu-3 as well as the colon carcinoma cell line CL-14 but not CL-40,
although the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was comparable according to RNA-seq
and western blot analysis or indicated even higher levels for CL-40 when determined by
RQ-PCR. Patterns of cytopathic disturbance of the cell culture monolayer were specific

for each cell line with most drastic effects seen in Calu-3 with a reduction to 80%
confluence within 4 days post infection (Fig 3B). Whereas the lacking permissiveness of
the selected cell lines CAL-27, CAL-33 and KYSE-510 for SARS-CoV-2 might be
explained by a shortened ACE2 transcript (Fig 1B), it is more challenging to elucidate,
why the candidate cell line CL-40 tested non-permissive. CL-40 as well as HCC-1937
hold a missense mutation in exon 6 (Fig 1C) causing an amino acid exchange at
position 197 (V197M) within the Scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain
responsible for protein-protein interaction and ligand binding (ExPASy) and is
described for various cancer types as well as cell lines (COSMIC). Hence, we speculate
that this mutation at V197M might disturb interaction with SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies
or pharmaceutic agents blocking this region of the receptor protein might be promising
candidates in preventing the infection of the cells with SARS-CoV-2.

Since CPE alone may not correlate directly with the frequency of infection in a cell
population, we sought to quantify viral gene expression by immunofluorescence staining
viral nucleic acids in form of double-stranded RNA [27] (Fig 3C). Double-stranded
(ds)RNA was found in the perinuclear space of infected cells consistent with earlier
findings on SARS-CoV [27], indicating active viral transcription and genome replication.
Calu-3, Vero E6, and CL-14 cells showed substantial amounts of infected cells with
dsRNA in perinuclear regions, but also Caco-2 cells – while showing no cytopathic effect
– displayed a limited number of dsRNA-containing cells. CL-40, in contrast, showed no
detectable dsRNA-containing cells consistent with the absence of CPE upon infection.
Interestingly, Vero E6 showed a more spot-like appearance of dsRNA signals compared
to human cells which could reflect a species-specific property of SARS-CoV-2
replication.
Finally, we assessed the permissiveness of these cell lines by assessing the release of
mature, infectious virions in a plaque assay (Fig 3D). Supernatants of infected cells were
taken 5 days post infection (dpi) and plaques were counted on Vero E6 cells. We found
that all tested cell lines, except CL-40, support the production of infectious
SARS-CoV-2 progeny to different extents – consistent with the presence of dsRNA in
Fig 3C. However, Caco-2 cells produced high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 infectious virions
without showing a CPE over the course of five days and also despite of low dsRNA
staining.
Cancer cell lines have been indispensable work horses of biological and clinical
research, including current global efforts to tackle SARS-CoV-2. Their further careful
evaluation as a non-overexpression based SARS-CoV-2 experimental systems is key to
future discoveries and their interpretation.

Conclusion

134

So far, clinically proven therapeutics specifically addressing SARS-CoV-2 are missing for
the treatment of COVID-19 patients. It is getting clear, that the virus attacks different
organs and cell types [14, 21, 22], which explains diverse symptoms of COVID-19 [11–13].
Many virus-host-interaction studies rely on ACE2/TMPRSS2-transfected cell lines such
as 293T and HeLa cells or non-human material such as green monkey cells Vero
E6 [4, 28, 29]. By screening RNA-seq data of human cell lines for higher levels of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 gene expression, we selected candidate cell lines, of which the human
colon carcinoma cell line CL-14 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 permissiveness. This
non-overexpressing cell line may represent a suitable cell line for SARS-CoV-2 studies.
In summary, we find that the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is necessary but not
sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 productive infection in human cell lines. Different ACE2
splicing variants and missense mutations in TMPRSS2 may be a reason for the
prevention of infections of receptor expressing cell lines.

CCLE RNA-Seq data set analysis

149

RNA-Seq data were retrieved and preprocessed as described [30]. Briefly, alignment files
were downloaded from CGHub via genetorrent, sorted (samtools 0.1.19) and converted
to fastq files (bedtools v2.21.0). Reads were trimmed via fastq-mcf (ea-utils 1.1.2-686).
STAR (2.5.3a) served as read mapper to the human genome Gencode 26, HTSeq
(0.11.3) was used as count tool. Raw counts were normalised and transformed to FPKM
(fragments per kilobase million) via R/Bioconductor (3.6.9) loading DESeq2 (1.26.0)
and visualised via ggplot2 (3.1.1). Different exon usage was discovered by visualising
the alignment files via IGV (2.8.0) [31]. For detecting mutations, mapped reads were
assigned to read groups (picard, 2.9.2 [www.broadinstitute.github.io/picard]); reads
were split, trimmed and reassigned (GenomeAnalysisTK, 3.7-0, SplitNCigarReads [32]);
mutations were called by the HaplotypeCaller (GenomeAnalysisTK, 3.7-0,) [32]; and
mutation effects were predicted via the Ensembl VEP (GRCh38, v90) [33]. Mutations
were filtered ≥10 depth and predicted missense mutations.

Cultivation of human cell lines

163

The continuous cell lines were provided for accessioning to the biological resource center
DSMZ by the original or secondary investigators [34]. Cell lines were grown at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of air containing 5% CO2. The basic growth media (Life
Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) were supplemented with 10–20% fetal bovine serum
(Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). No antibiotics were added to the cultures. All
cell lines were free of mycoplasmas and other bacterial, yeast and fungi contaminations
as tested by PCR and microbiological growth assays [35]. The authenticity of the cell
lines was determined by DNA typing [36]. The cells were first cultured in cell culture
flasks to confluence, detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS and pelleted for
RNA and protein preparation. For virus infection experiments the cells were seeded in
96-well plates at different densities starting with 0.25 – 1.5 x 105 cells per well as
highest cell number depending on the cell line. Optimal cell densities were determined
by observing the growth progression with an IncuCyte instrument (Essen Bioscience,
Hertfordshire, UK). Cells were then seeded at semi-confluence or complete confluence as
highest cell densities and three further dilutions each with half of the previous cell
densities. The cells were grown for one day before the virus infection experiments were
started.

RQ-PCR analysis

181

Real-time quantitative (RQ) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed
to quantify specific transcripts in the cells. Total RNA was extracted from cell line
samples using TRIzol reagent (Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). cDNA was
generated from 1 µg RNA by random priming using the Biozym cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Biozym, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany). RQ-PCR analysis was performed with the
7500 Real-time System, using commercial buffer and primer sets for the amplification of
ACE2 (Hs01085333m 1) and TMPRSS2 (Hs01122322m 1) transcripts (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). We analysed the transcript of TATA box binding
protein (TBP) for normalization of expression levels. Quantitative analyses were
performed in triplicate.

described previously [8]. Proteins on nitrocellulose membranes were visualized with the
biotin/streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase system (GE Healthcare; Little Chalfont, UK)
in combination with the “Renaissance Western Blot Chemoluminescence Reagent”
(Perkin Elmer; Waltham, MA, USA). Documentation was performed using the digital

Ischgl (hCoV19/Germany/FI1103201/2020, GISAID accession EPIISL 463008 was
taken from the strain repository of the Institute of Virology, Münster). If not indicated
otherwise, cells were seeded onto 96-well cell culture plates and infected 24-48 hours
later with 250 pfu/well using a 10 µl inoculum and 100 µl total well volume. In order to
monitor disturbances of the cell monolayer, images were taken automatically every 2
hours following infection using a Sartorius IncuCyte S3 (10x magnification, 4 images per
well) for a total of 7 days. Changes in confluence were analysed using the IncuCyte
GUI-inbuilt analysis tools (version 2019B, Rev1).

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 infectious units was done via a virus plaque assay.
Supernatants of infected cells were taken 5 dpi, serially diluted, and used to infect
confluent Vero E6 cells on 96-well cell culture plates for one hour. Then, the inoculum
was removed and cells were overlaid with cell culture medium (MEM, 10% FCS, 2 mM
glutamine) containing 1.5% methyl-cellulose. After 3 days, virus plaques were counted
from phase contrast microscopic images.

SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were fixed with 6% paraformaldehyde in PBS for one hour at
room temperature, followed by washing three times with PBS. Cell permeabilisation
was done with PBS containing 0.15% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT. Primary antibody
used to stain dsRNA was mouse anti-dsRNA, clone rJ2 (Merck Millipore, Cat. no.
MABE1134); secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit-Cy5 (Life Technologies, Cat. no.
A10523).
