ABSTRACT

25

SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is an important molecular biology tool performed to

26

support many aspects of the response to the pandemic. Freezing of primary clinical nasopharyngeal

27

swab samples and shipment to reference laboratories is usually required since RNA sequencing is

28

rarely available in routine clinical microbiology laboratories where initial diagnosis and support

29

to outbreak investigations occur. The cobas PCR Media transport medium developed by Roche

30

facilitates high throughput analyses on cobas multianalyzer PCR platforms. There is no data on

31

the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA after freezing and thawing of clinical samples in this transport

32

medium, but potential denaturing of the molecular template could impair test results. Our objective

33

was to compare the quality and results of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing when performed on

34

fresh or frozen samples in cobas PCR Media. Viral whole genome sequencing was performed

35

using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform. Genomic coverage and sequencing depth

36

did not significantly differ between fresh and frozen samples (n=10). For samples with lower viral

37

inoculum and PCR cycle threshold above 30, sequencing quality scores and detection of single

38

nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ either. Freezing of cobas PCR Media does not negatively

39

affect the quality of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequencing results and it is therefore a suitable transport

40

medium for outsourcing sequencing analyses to reference laboratories. Those results support

41

secondary use of diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab material for viral sequencing without

42

requirement for additional clinical samples.

INTRODUCTION

44

SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic sequencing plays an important role in the short and long-term

45

responses to the COVID-19 pandemic including global and national surveillance of the virus

46

evolution, understanding of SARS-CoV-2 natural history of disease and outbreak investigations

47

(1-4). Viral whole genome sequencing primarily occurs in reference laboratories and is rarely

48

performed where clinical diagnosis or outbreak investigations happen. Therefore, freezing of

49

primary samples is required prior to viral genomic amplification and sequencing.

50
51

cobas PCR Media is a transport medium developed by Roche that simplifies linkage between pre-

52

analytical sampling and analytical testing and is adapted for high throughput analyses on cobas

53

multianalyzer PCR platforms. It contains guanidine hydrochloride which is a denaturing agent

54

used to dissociate nucleoproteins and inactivate RNases. The manufacturer does not recommend

55

freezing the cobas PCR Media because of risks of molecular template denaturation (5). Freezing

56

of other transport media was previously shown not to negatively impact the detection of SARS-

57

CoV-2 by RT-PCR (6). However, it is unknown whether, and how, freezing of cobas PCR Media

58

indeed denatures SARS-CoV-2 RNA and if it negatively affects viral genomic sequencing.

59
60

In this study, we compared the quality and results of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing

61

between fresh and frozen samples obtained from combined oral and nasopharyngeal swabs

62

(ONPS). We used matched split samples collected in cobas PCR Media and either processed

63

following collection and storage at 4°C or frozen for one week at -80°C and thawed prior to

64

sequencing. Our protocol and analysis address the necessity for most clinical microbiology

66

reference laboratories in order to access viral genomic information.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

69

CLINICAL SAMPLES

70

Ten clinical samples were included in this study. All samples were a combined ONPS submitted

71

to our laboratory in cobas PCR Media initially found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 using the

72

FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) approved and validated cobas 8800 automated RT-PCR

73

system which simultaneously tests both the ORF1 a/b and E-gene viral molecular targets (7). To

74

assess the impact of viral load or initial amount of RNA template on sequencing, we purposively

75

included samples testing positive at a broad range of cycle threshold (Ct) from 14.4 to 34.7 for the

76

ORF1 a/b target. This strategy ensured inclusion of samples with low (high Ct) and high (low Ct)

77

viral loads.

78
79

FREEZING AND THAWING

80

Following initial positive RT-PCR testing, samples were split in equal volumes. The first half of

81

each samples was maintained at 4°C, according to manufacturer’s recommendation, and then

82

processed for whole genome sequencing as described below. The second half of each sample was

83

frozen at -80°C for 7 days and thawed. RT-PCR was then repeated using the same cobas 8800

84

system and viral genomic sequencing was performed using identical methods.

87

Viral RNA was extracted from 0.2 mL of cobas PCR Media using Maxwell® 16 instrument

88

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for final elution in 30µL. Viral whole genome sequencing was

89

performed using the ARTIC Network V3 protocol on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)

90

(Oxford, United Kingdom) MinION® long read sequencing platform. Since its initial publication

91

online in January 2020, the ARTIC protocol has become one of the most widely used approach to

92

SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing. This protocol has yielded a significant sequence contribution

93

to the GISAID global database and is currently used for surveillance by many public health

94

agencies (8, 9). Briefly, genome amplification was performed by reverse transcriptase multiplex

95

PCR using nCoV-2019 V3 primer combinations (Integrated DNA Technologies). This set of

96

primers was previously shown to produce high genomic coverage with low variance on the whole

97

viral genome (8). RT-PCR amplicons were assessed by Qubit® fluorometric DNA Quantification

98

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For samples with post RT-PCR DNA quantity

99

below 250 ng, we omitted the dilution step of the sample in 45 µL of molecular grade water before

100

library preparation as recommended in the ARTIC protocol. Such low inoculums were observed

101

in three samples with both ORF1 a/b and E-gene targets Cts over 30 (samples 1, 2, 3). Sequencing

102

libraries were prepared following ONT protocol for genomic DNA with native barcoding and

103

using 9.4.1 flow cells on the MinION® platform. Raw sequencing reads fast5 files were base called

104

with high accuracy using ONT proprietary software Guppy (v3.4.5). Reads were demultiplexed

105

and filtered using the online available ARTIC network bioinformatic pipeline solution (10). This

106

filtering process includes exclusion of sequencing reads respectively below 400 and above 700

107

base pairs which do not correspond to expected amplicons length resulting from the RT-PCR

108

primer set. Reads were mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GeneBank

109

accession number MN908947.3) using minimap2 (v2.17). Predominantly sequenced nucleotides

at positions for which a minimal depth of 20 reads had been achieved were used to generate

111

consensus viral genomic sequences. Potential subpopulations or mixed infections were not

112

considered, and hence a unique consensus sequence was generated for each isolate.

113
114

DATA ANALYSIS

115

We compared mean sequencing Q-scores with corresponding error rates and accuracy, single

116

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identification and diversity of sequenced alleles on identified

117

SNP genomic positions. We used those later metrics as surrogate markers of post-freezing viral

118

RNA integrity. Q-scores represent ONT’s sequencing platform and base calling software internal

119

assessment of sequencing read quality. The Q-score of a given base is defined as Q = 10log10(e)

120

where (e) is the estimated probability of the base call being wrong. We used a two-tailed paired

121

samples t-test with an alpha value of 0.05 to compare pre- and post-freezing variables. All

122

statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA USA).

123
124

To simulate prospective outbreak investigation, we supplemented the pre- and post-freezing

125

sequence datasets with a back catalog of 50 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from our institution

126

(unpublished data) hence generating two mocked nosocomial viral pangenomes. We

127

independently analyzed both augmented data sets as if searching for potential transmission

128

clusters. Consensus sequences were compared, and phylogenetic trees were built using UGENE

129

(v37) with the PHYLIP Neighbor Joining method without bootstrapping. To simulate national

130

surveillance and assessment of circulating viral clades, we independently compared the pre- and

131

post-freezing sequence datasets with published and well described SARS-CoV-2 reference

132

genomes submitted to Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/) (11).

RESULTS

144

RT-PCR

145

Upon initial testing after maintenance of clinical samples at 4°C in cobas PCR Media, RT-PCR

146

Cts ranged from 14.4 to 34.7 and 14.9 to 34.9 respectively for the ORF1 a/b and E-gene targets.

147

After freezing for 7 days at -80°C, RT-PCR Cts ranged between 17.8 to 31.8 and 17.9 to 33.8 for

148

the same targets. No statistically significant difference was observed between pre- and post-

149

freezing Cts for the ORF1 a/b target (p-value 0.64). One sample only became positive on the E-

150

gene target after freezing. Excluding this sample from the analysis, post-freezing Cts for the E-

151

gene target were 1.1 Ct higher after freezing (p-value 0.01) (Table 1).

156

mapped reads with pre- / post-freezing mean deltas of 11 Mb (p-value 0.57) and 938 reads (p-

157

value 0.31) for those key metrics. Also importantly, 20X sequencing depth, allowing for wild type

158

or variant allelic identification within our protocol, was achieved for an average of 83.9% and

159

83.7% of the viral genome respectively before and after freezing (p-value 0.90) (Table 2). Such

160

similarity was also observed for all other evaluated depth thresholds (1X, 5X, 10X, 50X). As

161

expected, sequencing data yield, depth and coverage were inversely correlated to the Ct value both

162

in pre- (p-value 0.0007) and post-freezing (p-value 0.0003) samples. Less sequencing data was

163

hence generated in the sub-group of low viral inoculum and high Ct samples 1, 2 and 3 but freezing

164

did not negatively impact sequencing yields in this subgroup either (Fig. 1).

165
166

No statistically significant decrease was observed in Q-scores (p-value 0.07) and base call

167

accuracy (p-value 0.10) after freezing (Table 3). Except for samples 1 (ORF1 a/b Ct 34.74) and 2

168

(ORF1 a/b Ct 32.16), freezing did not impact SNP detection and identified mutations were

169

identical in both sequencing analyses. Looking in more depth at each single read for those specific

170

mutation sites, the percentage of alternate bases leading to SNP calling did not significantly change

171

after freezing (p-value 0.31). This ratio of variant versus wild type alleles at each mutation site

172

was the same before and after freezing and suggests that the viral molecular template was not

173

significantly degraded by the freezing process in cobas PCR Media.

174
175

In the mocked outbreak investigation, samples with higher genomic similarity were identified.

176

Although our study was not a molecular epidemiology study and did not include clinical

177

correlation with putative transmission events, those molecular clusters were identical in both pre-

178

and post-freezing analyses (Fig. 2). For the surveillance clade typing simulated application,

179

phylogenetic placement was also identical in the pre- and post-freezing mocked data sets (Fig. 3).

180

For viral clade typing and comparison to reference genomes, samples 1 and 2 could not be included

181

in the analysis because of too small genomic coverage. All phylogenetic placement results were

182

expected and in agreement with previously described findings on identical SNP typing.

183
184

DISCUSSION

185

In our study, a single freeze - thaw cycle of ONPS clinical samples in cobas PCR Media did not

186

significantly impact analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on cobas 8800® automated

187

system on this limited set of samples. Although we observed a Ct increase of 1.1 (p-value 0.01)

188

after freezing for the E-gene target, one of our samples was also found to be positive for this target

189

only after freezing. Freezing the sample in cobas PCR Media did not degrade viral molecular

190

templates and did not negatively affect viral genomic sequencing analyses. Khiri et al had

191

previously shown that freezing of cervical samples in cobas PCR Media did not negatively impact

192

the sensitivity of PCR for human papillomavirus detection (12). Our study confirms this holds true

193

for SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to formally evaluate the impact of

194

freezing clinical samples in cobas PCR Media for downstream sequencing analyses either for

195

SARS-CoV-2 or for any other target pathogen or molecular template. Our study confirms the

196

ability of cobas PCR Media to maintain SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA at -80°C for subsequent

197

sequencing analyses. Note that the PCR amplicons generated in this study are relatively small

198

(~400 bp), so this protocol may be more robust to RNA damage than methods which require long,

199

intact starting molecules. Our results should also not be generalized to other transport media

200

without independent confirmation.

202

Our study included three samples with RT-PCR Cts above 30.0 which are considered to have a

203

lower viral load. For those samples, SNP calling showed variability and genomic coverage was

204

insufficient to allow detailed phylogenetic analyses. This phenomenon was observed both before

205

and after freezing and is hence believed to be due to low viral inoculum rather than transport

206

medium related viral RNA denaturation. Our study included only 10 samples but the extensive

207

comparability between pre- and post-freezing sequencing results suggests that a higher

208

denominator would not have led to different conclusions. It is possible that a freezing period longer

209

than 7 days would have led to worse sequencing results after thawing but our protocol did not

210

assess such longer-term effect. Seven days represents a sufficient delay for transportation to

211

reference laboratories performing viral sequencing and our study hence provides meaningful

212

information to clinical laboratories involved in routine diagnostic testing.

213
214

CONCLUSION

215

Our study demonstrates that the freezing of cobas PCR Media at -80°C does not affect viral

216

genomic sequencing quality and results for SARS-CoV-2. The consistent results between pre- and

217

post-freezing support potential secondary use of diagnostic oral and nasopharyngeal swab material

218

for viral sequencing without requirement for additional clinical sampling. Our findings will

219

simplify the collection and storage of samples in laboratories where this transport medium is

220

utilized.
