Abstract
Despite the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, serious illness and death induced by
coronavirus infection will remain a global health burden because of vaccination
hesitancy, possible virus mutations, and the appearance of novel coronaviruses.
Accordingly, there is a need for new approaches to limit severe illness stemming from
coronavirus infections. Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors
for GABA (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists
have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We previously showed
that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity and death rates in mice
following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1) which provides a potentially lethal model
of COVID-19. Here, we report that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs,
suggesting that GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary
coronavirus replication. Histopathological analysis revealed that GABA treatment
reduced lung inflammatory infiltrates and damages. Since GABA is safe for human
consumption, inexpensive, and available worldwide, it is a promising candidate to help
treat COVID-19.

Introduction
While GABA-Rs are well known for their role in neurotransmission in the CNS,
these receptors are also found on some cells in the periphery, most notably for our
studies, on some cells of the immune system and lung epithelia. The biological roles of
GABA-Rs on immune cells are not yet well understood, but there is a growing body of
evidence that the activation of these receptors has immunoregulatory actions. Rodent
and human macrophages and dendric cells express GABA-Rs and GABA-R agonists
inhibit their inflammatory activities (1-6). T cells also express GABA-Rs (4-8). The
administration of GABA-R agonists inhibits autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells while
promoting CD4+ and CD8+ Treg responses (5, 6, 9) and ameliorates autoimmune
disease in mouse models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid
arthritis, and also limits inflammation in murine type 2 diabetes (1, 5, 6, 10, 11). Human
immune cells also express GABA-Rs and GABA inhibits secretion of IL-6, TNF, IL-17A,
CXCL10/IP-10, CCL4, CCL20, and MCP-3 from anti-CD3 stimulated PBMC from T1D
patients (7). The ability of GABA-R agonists to inhibit the production of number of
inflammatory factors is of potential interest for helping to treat COVID-19 since high
levels of some of these inflammatory factors in patient sera is associated with the
development of severe COVID-19 (12-15).
Lung epithelial cells also express GABA-Rs, specifically the GABAA-R subtype.
GABA and GABAA-R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been shown to reduce
inflammation and improve alveolar fluid clearance and lung functional recovery in
different rodent models of acute lung injury (16-23), as well as limit pulmonary
inflammatory responses and improve clinical outcomes in ventilated human patients
(24-26). GABAA-R PAMs reduce macrophage infiltrates and inflammatory cytokine
levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and limit inflammatory responses by
rodent and human macrophages (3, 22, 27-31). GABA application reduces the secretion
of inflammatory factors from LPS-stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro
(17). Finally, GABA can inhibit platelet aggregation (32), which is important because
pulmonary thrombosis often occurs in critically ill COVID-19 patients (33, 34).

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 is a pneumotropic beta-coronavirus that is widely
used as a safe model of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection (35-38). Intranasal
inoculation with ³5 x 103 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MHV-1 in A/J mice induces
acute pneumonitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome with a high lethality rate.
The MHV-1-infected mice develop clinical symptoms and pathological features similar to
those in severely ill COVID-19 patients, including high levels of pulmonary edema,
pneumonitis, dense macrophage infiltrates, hyaline membranes, fibrin deposits,
accompanied by loss of body weight and respiratory distress (35-38). We previously
showed that GABA treatment just after MHV-1 inoculation, or after the appearance of
disease symptoms, very effectively protected the mice from severe illness and death
(39). Here, we report that GABA treatment also reduced viral loads and pathological
findings in their lungs. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying these observations.

Materials and methods
Mice. Female A/J mice (8 weeks in age) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory
and maintained in microisolator cages and fed with a standard diet and water ad libitum.
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocols
for all experiments using vertebrate animals were approved by the Animal Research
Committee at UCLA (approval # ARC-2020-122) and were carried out in compliance
with the ARRIVE guidelines.
Reagents. GABA (stock #A2129) was purchased from Millipore-Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
USA).
Virus. MHV-1, DBT cells, and HeLa-CECAM1 were generously provided by Dr. Stanley
Perlman (University of Iowa). MHV-I virus was prepared and titered as previously
described (35-39).
Viral infection and GABA treatment. At 9 weeks in age, individual A/J mice were
anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 5 x 103 PFU MHV-1 in 50 µl cold
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). The mice were immediately randomized
and provided with plain water (controls) or water that contained GABA (20 mg/mL) as
per (9, 39) for the entirety of the observation period. The mice treated with GABA on
day 0 are referred to as the GABA0 group. Some virus-inoculated mice were provided
with plain water for 2 days and treated with GABA beginning on day 3 post-inoculation
and are referred to as the GABA3 group. The mice were euthanized at 3 or 6 days postinfection and their right and left lungs were dissected for measurements of viral loads
and histology, respectively.
Viral titers. Frozen lung samples were dounce-homogenized into 1 mL of ice-cold
DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum and homogenized with 1 mm glass beads using a
Qiagen TissueLyser-LT at 50 Hz for 6x1 min. The viral titers in the supernatants were
determined by endpoint dilution (40) in HeLa-CEACAM1 cells (85% confluent, 5 x 104

cells/well) using the Spearman-Kärber formula (41) to calculate 50% tissue culture
infectious dose (TCID50).
Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung sections. Their left lungs were ﬁxed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and embedded in parafﬁn. Lung tissue sections (5 µm) were
routine-stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Five images from each mouse were
captured under a light microscope at 200 x magnification. The degrees of pathological
changes were scored, based on the number of hyaline membranes, % of pulmonary
areas with obvious inflammatory infiltrates in lung parenchyma, and the % of area with
inflammatory consolidation within the total area of the section. The total numbers of
hyaline-like membranes with, or without, cell debris or hyaline-like deposition in alveoli
of the lung tissue section were scored as 0: none detectable; 1: 1-5; 2: 5-10; 3: >10. The
areas of lung inflammation and hemorrhage in one lung section were estimated and the
severity of inflammation and hemorrhage in the section was scored as 1: mild, 2:
moderate; 3, marked, 4: severe. Accordingly, an inflammatory score in each mouse was
obtained by % of lung areas x severity score. The areas of lung consolidation were
estimated in the lung section and scored as 1: <10%; 2:11-25%: 3:26-50%; 4:>50%.
Finally, the pneumonitis score of individual mice = (% of inflammation areas x severity
score) + lung consolidation score + hyaline membrane score with a maximum score of
11.

Results
A/J mice were inoculated intranasally with MHV-1 (5 x 103 PFU) and then
randomized to receive plain water (controls) or water containing GABA (20 mg/mL, as in
(39)) for the remainder of the study. Mice from these groups were euthanized 3 or 6
days post-infection and the virial load in their lungs was determined. Concurrently,
another group of MHV-1 inoculated mice was given water containing GABA beginning
at 3 days post-infection and the viral load in their lungs was determined 6 days postinfection.
At three days post-infection the mean viral load in the lungs of mice given plain
water was about 7-fold higher than that in mice given GABA immediately after infection
(p<0.5, Fig. 1). Thereafter, the viral load in the lungs declined as expected, and by day 6
post-infection the viral load in the lungs of control mice were about twice that in the
lungs of mice given GABA either immediately or 3 days post-infection, although these
differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 1). Thus, early GABA treatment
reduced viral loads in the lungs of mice.
Histological evaluation of lung sections from mice given GABA immediately
following MHV-1 inoculation revealed reduced inflammatory infiltrates, hyaline-like
membrane formation and fibrin deposits in the alveoli at 3 days post-infection, relative to
that in control MHV-1 inoculated mice (Fig. 2A). Thus, GABA treatment limited the
MHV-1 induced lung damage in A/J mice.

Discussion
Our previous study showed that GABA treatment beginning just after MHV-1
inoculation or after the appearance of symptoms rapidly curtailed disease progression
(39). GABA-treated mice also had smaller lung coefficient indexes (indicative of less
inflammation and edema). Thus, GABA-R activation can limit a very acute and highly
lethal viral infection-induced pulmonary inflammation, a property that heretofore was
unknown. Here, we show that early GABA treatment reduced MHV-1 replication in the
lungs of mice when measured near the time of peak viral load in this model (35-37),
which may have contributed to the better outcomes observed in GABA-treated animals.
Hence, GABA-R agonists may provide a new approach to limit viral replication in the
lungs.
We can envision a number of ways that GABA may have limited viral replication,
including: 1) The lung alveolar cells of rodents and humans express GABAA-Rs (30, 42).
While the activation of GABAA-R’s Cl- channels on neurons leads to Cl- influx and
hyperpolarization, the activation of GABAA-Rs on ATII cells induces Cl- efflux and
greater membrane depolarization (30, 42). Because coronaviruses promote Ca2+ influx
to enhance their replication (43, 44), the activation of ATII GABAA-Rs and the ensuing
Cl- efflux and membrane depolarization may limit the influx of extracellular Ca2+, making
the cellular environment less conducive to viral replication. 2) Activation of GABAA-Rs
on lung alveolar and large airway epithelial cells may have A) altered the secretion of
immune signaling molecules from infected cells, B) altered alveolar surfactant
production/absorption, and/or C) altered inflammatory responses and autophagy (45)
and, D) reduced the expression of the MHV-1 receptor CAECAM1 in ways that limited
virus production. Further detailed studies are needed to evaluate whether these factors,
and/or others, contributed to the observed reduction in viral load.
Histopathological analysis of lungs from mice that received GABA just after MHV1 inoculation revealed that three days post-infection these mice had significantly
reduced lung inflammation and markers of lung damage relative to that in control mice.
There are a number of different biological processes through which GABA treatment
may have ameliorated the severity of pneumonitis: 1) GABA can inhibit macrophage
and dendritic cell inflammatory activities (1-3, 29, 46, 47). Likewise, GABAA-R PAMs

macrophages (22, 27-31). GABAA-R agonists also inhibit activated Th17 and Th1
responses and promote CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs, however, since adaptive immune
responses take time to arise, these abilities are unlikely to have contributed to GABA’s
ability to attenuate disease soon after MHV-1 infection. These effects on adaptive
immune responses may be relevant for treating COVID-19 which has a longer disease
course and in which high levels of circulating Th1, Th17, and Th2-secreted proteins are
associated with severe illness (12, 13). 2) By reducing viral loads in the lungs, GABA
treatment may have limited dysregulated inflammatory responses to the infection. 3)
GABA and GABAA-R PAMs reduce inflammation and improve alveolar fluid clearance
and lung functional recovery in animal models of acute lung injury (16-18, 20-23) and in
ventilated patients (24-26) and could have exerted similar actions in the MHV-1 infected
mice. 4) GABA and GABAA-R agonist treatments increase macrophage autophagy (45).
In murine models of pneumatic bacterial infections, GABAA-R agonists reduced
bacterial load and TNFa and IL-6 levels in the lungs and protected the mice against
illness (45). 5) GABA inhibits platelet aggregation (32)—this may be an important
property because pulmonary thrombosis is increased in critically ill COVID-19 patients
(33, 34). Thus, treatment with GABA may have led to better outcomes in MHV-1
infected mice through multiple and diverse pathways.
Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which GABA-R activation
protected MHV-1 infected mice from severe pneumonitis and whether these
observations extend to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Given that GABA can affect many
biological processes and that viral infection is a very dynamic process it is clear that
GABA-R agonist dosing needs to be carefully studied and optimized for different stages
of coronavirus infection. Our observations provide a spring board for future
investigations into whether the GABA system can be modulated to limit severe illness
due to SARS-CoV-2, future novel coronavirus outbreaks, and other respiratory
disorders.

Figure 1. GABA treatment reduces viral replication in MHV-1 infected mice. Mice
were inoculated with MHV-1 and immediately placed on plain water (control) or water
containing GABA and three or six days later their lungs were harvested for
determination of viral load. Concurrently, another group of MHV-1 inoculated mice was
given water containing GABA beginning three days post-infection and the viral load in
their lungs was determined 6 days post-infection. The data shown are the mean
TCID50/g of lung tissue ± SEM at the indicated days. GABA0 mice (blue square symbol)
received GABA immediately after inoculation and GABA3 mice (orange triangle symbol)
received GABA beginning three days post-infection. N=5 mice per group at each time
point. *p<0.05 by Student’s t-test.

Figure 2. Histopathological features in the lungs of untreated and GABA-treated mice
six days post-MHV-1 infection. Images are representative images of H&E stained lung
sections from A) untreated mice and B) GABA-treated (beginning immediately following
inoculation) mice six days post-infection. Red arrows point to hyaline-like membranes
and black arrows indicate local consolidation. Scale bar is 50 um.
