Abstract
Increasing evidence demonstrated that the expression of Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme type 2
(ACE2), is a necessary step for SARS-CoV-2 infection permissiveness. In the light of the recent data
highlighting an association between COVID-19 and diabetes, a detailed analysis aimed at evaluating
ACE2 expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we took advantage of
INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyse ACE2, both at mRNA and
protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies.
Using multiple reagents and antibodies, we showed that ACE2 is expressed in human pancreatic islets,
where it is preferentially expressed in subsets of insulin producing β-cells. ACE2 is also is highly
expressed in pancreas microvasculature pericytes and moderately expressed in rare scattered ductal
cells. By using different ACE2 antibodies we showed that a recently described short-ACE2 isoform is
also prevalently expressed in human β-cells.
Finally, using RT-qPCR, RNA-seq and High-Content imaging screening analysis, we demonstrated
that pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not palmitate, increases ACE2 expression in the β-cell line
EndoC-βH1 and in primary human pancreatic islets.
Taken together, our data indicate a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes through putative
infection of pancreatic microvasculature and/or ductal cells and/or through direct β-cell virus tropism.

Introduction

The expression of molecules that act as receptors for viruses determine tissue-specific tropism. SARScoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that leads to the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), uses its surface envelope Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to interact and gain access to host cells
through the Angiotensin-I converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. As such, S-protein-ACE2 binding is
the key determinant for virus entry, propagation and transmissibility of COVID-19-related disease
(1,2).
Artificially induced ACE2 de-novo expression in ACE2-negative cell lines is a necessary step to
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection (3,4). SARS-CoV-2 does not enter cells that do not express
ACE2 and does not use other coronaviruses receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4), thus being fully dependent on ACE2 presence in host cells (5). Additional host
co-factors, such as transmembrane protease TMPRSS2, cathepsin B/L and furin protease, have been
shown to enhance efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by processing the S-protein and eliciting
membrane fusion and syncytia formation (6). The central role played by ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2
infection has been further supported by evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection is driven by ACE2
expression level (6). SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets cells of the nasal, bronchial and lung epithelium,
causing respiratory-related symptoms; however, growing evidence shows that other tissues can also be
infected.
Several reports indicate a wide, although variable, distribution of ACE2 expression patterns among
different tissues (7–9), thus underlining a potential different virus infection susceptibility among cell
types. The fact that COVID-19 disease may lead to multiple organ failure (10,11) shows the crucial
relevance for understanding the molecular mechanisms of host cell factors used by SARS-CoV-2 to
infect their target tissues.

Recent studies showed that older adults and those with chronic medical conditions like heart and lung
disease and/or diabetes mellitus are at the highest risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Of importance, a yet unresolved conundrum relies on the recently hypothesized bidirectional
relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus (12,13). This concept is supported by reports in
which impaired glycaemic control is associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. Indeed,
elevated blood glucose concentrations and deterioration of glycaemic control may contribute to
increased inflammatory response, to abnormalities in the coagulation system and to impairment of
ventilatory function, thus leading to severe COVID-19 disease and to a worse prognosis (14).
Interestingly, acute hyperglycaemia has been observed at admission in a substantial percentage of
SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, regardless of the past medical history of diabetes (15–18). The same
observations were previously made in SARS-CoV-1 pneumonia during 2003 SARS epidemic (19).
A recently published case report described autoantibody-negative insulin-dependent diabetes onset in
a young patient who was infected by SARS-CoV-2 seven weeks before diabetes symptoms occurrence
(20). Additional previous studies further support such observation(21,22). This indicates the possibility
of a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and new-onset diabetes through potential direct infection of
pancreatic islets or additional indirect mechanisms. Indeed, an in-vitro infection model of human
pluripotent stem cells derived β-cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (23) showed permissiveness of these
pre-β-cells to the virus. However, whether fully mature primary beta-cells or other cells of the human
pancreas are indeed permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be clarified.
To address this question, we screened the ACE2 expression pattern in human pancreata obtained from
adult non-diabetic multiorgan donors and in the insulin-producing human β-cell line EndoC-βH1, using
different methodologies, multiple reagents, and publicly available or in-house generated RNA
sequencing datasets. Our data indicate that ACE2 is expressed by pancreas microvasculature, by
scattered ductal cells and by a subset of human β-cells. These different cell types are thus potentially

prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified a differential distribution of the two recently
discovered ACE2 isoforms (24,25). Exposure of EndoC-βH1 human beta-cell line and human
pancreatic islets to pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly increased ACE2 expression. Taken
together, our data suggest a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and new onset diabetes,
which deserves further investigation based on long-term follow up of patients recovered from COVID19 disease.

Materials and Methods

Human donors

Human pancreatic sections analysed in this study were obtained from pancreata of brain-dead adult
non-diabetic multiorgan donors within the European Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with
Diabetes (EUnPOD), a project launched in the context of the INNODIA consortium (www.innodia.eu).
Whole pancreata were processed following standardized procedures at University of Pisa. Formalin
fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) pancreatic tissue sections and frozen OCT pancreatic tissue sections
were obtained from n=7 adult non-diabetic multiorgan donors, and from n=1 longstanding T1D donor
pancreas (Table S1). In INNODIA EUnPOD network, pancreata not suitable for organ transplantation
were obtained with informed written consent by organ donors' next-of -kin and processed with the
approval of the local ethics committee of the Pisa University.

2.2

Human pancreatic islets

Human pancreatic islets were obtained from n=4 non-diabetic multi-organ donors (Table S1). Briefly,
purified islets were prepared by intraductal collagenase solution injection and density gradient
purification, as previously described (26). At the end of the isolation procedure, fresh human pancreatic
islets preparations were resuspended in CMRL culture medium (cat. 11-530-037, ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with L-Glutamine 1% (cat.G7513-100ML),
Antibiotic/Antimicotic 1% (A5955-100ML, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), FBS 10% and
cultured at 28°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.

Cell culture

EndoC-βH1 human β-cell line (27,28) was obtained by UniverCell-Biosolutions (Toulouse-France)
and used for all experiments between passages 78-88. EndoC-βH1 were cultured at 37 °C with 5%
CO2 in coated flask (coating medium composition: DMEM high-glucose cat. 51441C,
Penicillin/Streptomycin 1% cat. P0781, ECM 1% cat. E1270 and Fibronectin from bovine plasma 0.2%
cat. F1141 - all from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and maintained in culture in low-glucose
DMEM (cat. D6046) supplemented with 2% BSA fraction V (cat. 10775835001), β-Mercaptoethanol
50 µM (cat. M7522), L-Glutamine 1% (cat. G7513), Penicillin/Streptomycin 1% (cat. P0781),

(cat. S5261) (all from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2), passages 33-34, were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a 100 mm petri
plate and maintained in culture in high glucose DMEM (cat. 51441C) supplemented with L-Glutamine
1% (cat. G7513), Antibiotic/Antimycotic 1% (A5955-100ML, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
and FBS 10%.
In order to evaluate ACE2 expression in human β cells under diabetogenic stress conditions, EndoCβH1 cell line was subjected to palmitate-induced lipotoxic and inflammatory stress. Briefly, EndoCβH1 cells were plated at a density of 2,5˟105/well in 24-well plates or 5˟104/well in 96-well plates. After
48 h, palmitate and inflammatory stimuli were performed as previously described (29,30). In details,
palmitate and inflammatory stresses have been induced respectively by 2 mM of Sodium Palmitate
(cat. P9767-5G - Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or 0,5% EtOH (as control treatment) for 24 h,
or cytokines mix IL-1β (50 U/mL) (cat. #201-LB-005 - R&D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA), TNFα
(1000 U/mL) (cat. T7539 - Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and IFNγ (1000 U/mL) (cat.
11040596001- Roche, Basilea, Switzerland) for 24 h.

2.4

Laser capture microdissection (LCM)

Pancreatic human tissue samples (n=5) from EUnPOD multiorgan donors (Table S1) were frozen in
Tissue-Tek OCT compound and then 7-μm thick sections were cut from frozen O.C.T. blocks. Sections
were fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 s, dehydrated in 100% ethanol for 1 min, in 100% ethanol for 1 min,
in xylene for 5 min and finally air-dried for 5 min. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was performed
using an Arcturus XT Laser-Capture Microdissection system (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View,
CA, USA) by melting thermoplastic films mounted on transparent LCM caps (cat.LCM0214 ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on specific islet areas. Human pancreatic islets were
subsequently visualized through islet autofluorescence for LCM procedure. Thermoplastic films
containing microdissected cells were incubated with 10 µl of extraction buffer (cat. kit0204 ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 min at 42 ◦C and kept at −80°C until RNA
extraction. Each microdissection was performed within 30 min from the staining procedure. Overall
n=50 microdissected pancreatic islets from each case were analysed.

2.5

RNA extraction from LCM isolated human pancreatic islets

Total RNA was extracted from each LCM sample using PicoPure RNA isolation kit Arcturus (cat.
kit0204 - ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following manufacturer’s procedure. Briefly,
the cellular extracts were mixed with 12.5 µl of EtOH (100%) and transferred to the purification
column filter membrane. DNase treatment was performed using RNase-Free DNase Set (cat. 79254 Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA was eluted in 11 μl of DNase/RNase-Free Water and LCM
captures deriving from human sample were pooled and subjected to a subsequent concentration through
Savant SpeedVac SC100 centrifugal evaporator. Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer technology with RNA Pico
chips (cat. 5067-1513 Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed for each RNA
sample, in order to analyse RNA integrity (RIN) and concentration.

2.6

RNA extraction from cells and tissues

For gene expression evaluation, total RNA was extracted from approximately 3.0x105 EndoC-βH1 or
from fresh lung tissue (0.5x0.5x0.5cm), obtained from a lung tumor surgery donor by dissecting a not
affected portion of the tissue (obtained with informed written consent of the patient and approved by
the local Ethics Committee at the University of Siena). Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Kit (cat. R202-Zymo
Research, Irvine, CA, US) was adopted following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the pelleted
cells were resuspended in QIAzol (cat. 79306, Qiagen), mixed with equal volume of Ethanol 100%
and transferred to Zymo-Spin™ IICR Column. DNase digestion was performed using RNase-Free
DNase Set (cat. 79254). RNA was eluted in 30 µl of DNase/RNase-Free Water. Fresh lung tissue was
maintained in PBS1X on ice immediately after surgery, until ready for the RNA extraction.
Homogenization of the tissue was performed using 600 μl of QIAzol and Lysing Matrix latex beads
(MP Biomedicals, cat. 6913-100) in FastPrep-24 automated homogenizer (1min, full speed). The
homogenate was diluted with vol/vol Ethanol 100% and then transferred in Zymo-Spin™ IICR
Column. RNA extraction was performed following manufacturer's instructions.

2.7

RT-Real Time PCR analysis

Total RNA extracted from EndoC-βH1 and collagenase-isolated human pancreatic islets samples was
quantified using Qubit 3000 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), while those
extracted from LCM-islets were quantified using 2100 Bioanalyzer-RNA 6000 Pico Kit (cat.
50671513, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as well as RNA integrity (RIN). Samples
with RIN<5.0 were excluded. Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using SuperScript™
VILO™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (cat. 11754050-ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

cDNA deriving from LCM human pancreatic islets was then amplified using TaqMan PreAmp Master
Mix (cat. 4488593, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following manufacturer’s
instructions.
Real-Time PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays using primers (see
Resources Table) and SensiFast Probe Lo-ROX Kit (cat.# BIO-84020, Bioline) following
manufacturer’s recommendation. Data were collected and analysed through Expression Suite software
1.0.1 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using 2-ΔCt or 2-ΔΔCt method. ViiA7 Real-Time
PCR thermalcycler instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to perform
Real-Time PCR reactions.

ACE2 Immunohistochemistry analysis of human pancreatic sections

In order to evaluate the staining pattern of ACE2 in human pancreatic tissues, we analyzed FFPE
sections (7-μm thickness), prepared by using a microtome (cat. RM2125 RTS - Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar, Germany) and baked overnight at 37°C, from two different portions of pancreatic tissue for
each multiorgan donor (listed in Table S1).
After deparaffinization and rehydration through decreasing alcohol series (Xylene-I 20min, Xylene-II
20min, EtOH 100% 5min, EtOH 95% 5min, EtOH 80% 5min, EtOH 75% 5min) pancreatic sections
were incubated with 1X Phosphate-Buffered Saline with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS 1X) supplemented with
3% H2O2 (cat. H1009 - Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30min, to block endogenous
peroxidases. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed using 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 in
microwave (600W) for 10 minutes, maintaining boiling conditions. Sections were incubated with PBS
1× supplemented with 5% rabbit serum (cat. SCBD33ISV - Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to
reduce non-specific reactions. Then, sections were incubated overnight at +4°C with primary antibody

monoclonal mouse anti-Human ACE2 (cat.MAB933, R&D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA) diluted
1:33 (15 μg/ml) in PBS 1× supplemented with 5% rabbit serum. The next day, sections were incubated
with secondary antibody polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse HRP-conjugate (cat.P0260, Dako, Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in PBS 1× for 1h at room temperature (RT).
Subsequently, the sections were incubated with one drop of 3,3' Diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen
solution (cat.RE7270-K, Novolink MAX DAB, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for 5 minutes,
to trigger the chromatic reaction. Stained sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin
(cat.MHS31, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 minutes, for better visualization of the tissue
morphology. After the dehydration through increasing alcohol series, the pancreatic sections were
mounted with Eukitt mounting medium (cat.S9-25-37, Bio Optica, Milan, Italy) and covered with a
coverslip allowing them to dry. A negative control with only secondary antibody incubation (no
primary antibody control sample) was also included in order to exclude potential background artifacts
generated by the secondary antibody or the enzymatic detection reaction (Figure S1A).
In order to further evaluate ACE2 expression in pancreas sections, the same ACE2 IHC protocol was
applied to other 2 primary antibodies anti-Human ACE2: monoclonal rabbit anti-Human ACE2 (cat.
Ab108252, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:100 in PBS 1× supplemented with 5% goat serum; and
polyclonal rabbit anti-Human ACE2 (cat. Ab15348, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:2000 in PBS
1× supplemented with 5% goat serum. The secondary antibody in both cases was polyclonal goat antirabbit HRP-conjugate (cat. 111-036-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Philadelphia, PA, USA), diluted
1:1000 in PBS 1× for 1h at room temperature (RT).
All the 3 primary antibodies anti-Human ACE2, with respective secondary antibodies, were also used
to perform a positive control staining in FFPE human lung sections (7-μm thickness), in order to double
check the specificity of the primary antibodies.

Immunofluorescence staining for ACE2-Insulin-Glucagon and ACE2-CD31

FFPE pancreatic sections (see above) were analysed by triple immunofluorescence in order to
simultaneously evaluate the expression pattern of ACE2, insulin and glucagon. Briefly, after
deparaffinization and rehydration through decreasing alcohol series (see above), pancreatic sections
were subjected to heat induced antigen retrieval using 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 in microwave
(600W) for 10 minutes. Sections were incubated with PBS 1X supplemented with 3% Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA, cat. A1470-25G, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to reduce non-specific
reactions. Then, sections were incubated with primary antibody monoclonal mouse anti-human ACE2
(cat. MAB933, R&D System, Minneapolis, MS, USA) diluted 1:33 in PBS 1X supplemented with 3%
BSA, overnight at +4°C, followed by polyclonal Rabbit anti-human Glucagon (cat. A0565, Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) diluted 1:500 in PBS 1X supplemented with 3% BSA, and
prediluted polyclonal Guinea Pig anti-human Insulin (cat. IR002 - Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) as second and third primary antibodies for 1h at room temperature (RT). Subsequently,
sections were incubated with goat anti-guinea pig Alexa-Fluor 555 conjugate (cat. A21435, Molecular
Probe, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) diluted 1:500 in PBS 1X, goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 647 conjugate (cat. A21245, Molecular Probe, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
diluted 1:500 in PBS 1X and goat anti-mouse 488 conjugate (cat.A11029 - Molecular Probe,
ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) diluted 1:500 in PBS 1X, as secondary antibodies for
1h. Sections were counterstained with 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, cat.
D8517, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:3000 in PBS 1X, and then mounted with Vectashield antifade
medium (cat. H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and analysed immediately or
stored at +4°C until ready for confocal image analysis. A negative control with only secondary antibody
incubation (no MAB933 primary antibody control sample) was also included in order to exclude any
background artifacts or fluorochrome overlaps (Figure S1B).

For ACE2-CD31 double immunofluorescence staining, FFPE pancreas sections were incubated
overnight at +4°C with primary antibody monoclonal mouse anti-human ACE2 (cat. MAB933, R&D
System, Minneapolis, MS, USA) diluted 1:33 in PBS 1X supplemented with 3% BSA and with
polyclonal rabbit anti-CD31 (cat. Ab28364, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted 1:50 in the same blocking
buffer. Subsequently, sections were incubated with goat-anti rabbit Alexa-Fluor 594 conjugate (cat.

HeLa cells were immunostained for ACE2 as follows. The cells were first fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min,
washed for 10 min in 0.1 mol/L glycine, permeabilized in 0,25% Triton-X-100 for 5 min and blocked
in 3% BSA+0.05% Triton-X-100 in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 30 min. The cells were
subsequently washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and then incubated with monoclonal mouse
anti-Human ACE2 (cat. MAB933, R&D System, Minneapolis, MS, USA) diluted 1:33 in BSA 1% in
PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2 or with negative isotype control mouse IgG2a (cat. X0943 - Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Then, HeLa cells were rinsed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+
and were incubated with goat anti-mouse-488 1:500 in 1% BSA in PBS1X without Ca2+ and Mg2+, or
with goat anti-rabbit-488 diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA in PBS1X without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cells were
counterstained with DAPI and then mounted as described above.

mode capturing multiple focal planes (n=40) for each identified islet or selected representative islets.
Sections were scanned and images acquired at 40× or 63× magnification. The same confocal
microscope setting parameters were applied to all stained sections before image acquisition in order to
uniformly collect detected signal related to each channel.
Colocalization analysis between ACE2 and insulin and between ACE2 and glucagon were performed
using LasAF software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The region of interest (ROI) was
drawn to calculate the colocalization rate (which indicates the extent of colocalization between two
different channels and reported as a percentage) as a ratio between the colocalization area and the
image foreground. Evaluation of the signal intensity of ACE2 expression in human pancreatic islets of
EUnPOD donors was performed using the LasAf software (www.leica-microsystem.com). This
software calculates the ratio between intensity sum ROI (which indicates the sum ROI of the greyscale value of pixels within a region of interest) of ACE2 channel and Area ROI (µm2) of human
pancreatic islets. Both in colocalization and intensity measurement analysis, a specific threshold was
assigned based on the fluorescence background. The same threshold was maintained for all the images
in all the cases analysed.

Micro-confocal High-content Screening analysis

Cultured EndoC-βH1 cells were immunostained for ACE2 and insulin as reported above. Cytokinestreated or untreated cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, washed for 10 min in 0.1 mol/L glycine,
permeabilized in 0,25% Triton-X-100 for 5 min and blocked in 3% BSA+0.05% Triton-X100 in PBS
without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 30 min. EndoC-βH1 cells were incubated with antibody polyclonal Guinea
Pig anti-Human Insulin (cat. A21435 - Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) diluted 1:1740
in BSA 1% in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+and with monoclonal mouse anti-Human ACE2 (cat.

incubated with goat anti-mouse-488 (cat.A11029 - Molecular Probe, ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) and goat anti-guinea pig-555 (cat. A21435, Molecular Probe, ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) 1:500 in 1% BSA in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. EndoC-βH1 cells
were incubated with 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, cat. D8517, Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted 1:3000 in PBS 1X; then washed with PBS without Ca2+ and
Mg2+and analysed immediately. Fluorescence images of EndoC-βH1 cells were analysed using Opera
Phoenix High Content Screening System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) acquiring multiple
images using 63× magnification; nine microscopic areas per well were automatically selected.
Automated image analysis was performed using Harmony® High-Content Imaging (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA), and fluorescence intensity of treated or untreated cells were measured based on
Alexa-555 (insulin) and Alexa-488 (ACE2) fluorochromes. Images were first segmented into nuclei
and cytoplasm using the Find Nuclei building block on the DAPI channel and the Find Cytoplasm on
the 488 (ACE2) channel. To detect ACE2 signals, Find spots building block was applied to the 488
fluorescence channel inside the cytoplasm area previously detected. The intensity rate was obtained
from the average of the nine areas and values reported as Corrected Spot Intensity (which is the "Mean
Spot Intensity" minus "Spot Background Intensity") (31).

RNA sequencing processing and analysis

Total RNA of EndoC-βH1 cells and of pancreatic human islets exposed or not to IFNα or to IL-1β +
IFNγ for the indicated time points was obtained and prepared for RNA sequencing as described (32–

were analyzed. The obtained libraries were submitted to a second quality control before sequencing on
an Illumina HiSeq 2500. The Salmon software version 0.13.2 (35) was used to re-analyse our original
RNA-seq data (32–34) by mapping the sequenced reads to the human reference transcriptome from
GENCODE version 31 (GRCh38) (36) using the quasi-alignment model. Gene expression is
represented in Transcripts Per Million (TPM).
Differentially expressed genes were identified with DESeq2 version 1.24.0 (37). The estimated number
of reads obtained from Salmon were used to run the DESeq2 pipeline. In summary, in this approach
the DESeq2 normalizes samples based on per-sample sequencing depth and accounting for the
presence of intra-sample variability. Next, data were fit into a negative binomial generalized linear
model (GLM) and computed using the Wald statistic. Finally, obtained p-values were adjusted for
multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) by the Benjamini-Hochberg method (38).
Genes were considered significantly modified with a FDR < 0.05.

2.14 Western blot analysis
Total proteins from EndoC-βH1 cells were extracted using a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 137
mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) NP-40, 2mM EDTA) supplemented with 1X protease inhibitors (Roche). Total
proteins were quantified using Bradford assay, and 50-100 μg protein/lane were separated using SDSPAGE Tris-Glycine gradient Bis-Acrylamide gel 4-20%. Proteins were then transferred to
Nitrocellulose 0.2 μm membrane using wet electrophoresis system. Upon transfer onto nitrocellulose,
membranes were washed 3 times with TBST1X (Tris-HCl 25 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Tween 20 0,1%,
pH 7.4) and then incubated 2h with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST1X. To identify ACE2, three different
antibodies were used: #Ab108252, #Ab15348 (Abcam) and #MAB933 (R&D system) were
respectively diluted 1:1000, 1:500 and 1:250 in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST1X and incubated o/n at

washes with TBST1X and 1 wash in TBS1X, chemiluminescent signal was detected by using ECL
solution (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK-RPN2232). Chemiluminescent
analysis of immunoblot results was performed by using LAS400 analyzer (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK-RPN2232).

ACE2 targeted Mass Spectrometric (MS)-Shotgun proteomics analysis

To perform ACE2 targeted MS analysis, EndoC-βH1 cells were lysed with RIPA buffer 1X and protein
lysate concentration quantified through BCA assay. Then the protein lysate was mixed with 400 µL of
urea 8M in Tris-HCl 100nM pH 8,5 (UA), with the addition of 100 mM DTT. The mixture was charged
on a filter 10 K Pall, incubated 30min RT and centrifuged 13,800xg 30min. The filter was washed
twice with 400 µL of UA and centrifuged 13,800xg 30min, then incubated with 100 µL of 50 mM of
iodoacetamide (IAC) solution in a thermo-mixer for 1min 150 RPM and without mixing for 20min,
then centrifuged at 13,800xg for 20min. After these steps, the filter was washed twice with 400 µL of
UA and centrifuged at 13,800xg 30min, twice with 400 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
(AMBIC), and then centrifuged twice, a first time at 13,800xg for a30min and a second time at
13,800xg for 20min. Next, 40 µL of 50 mM AMBIC were added to the filter together with trypsin
(ratio trypsin/proteins 1:25) and incubated O/N 37°C. The sample was then transferred into a new
collecting tube and centrifuged at 13,800xg for 10min. Subsequently, 100 µL of 0.1% formic acid was
added on the filter and centrifuged 13,800xg 10min. Finally, filter the was discarded and the solution
was desalted with OASIS cartridges according to manufacturers’ instructions. The retrieved peptides
were concentrated through SpeedVac and the sample was resuspended in a solution of 3% acetonitrile,
96.9% H2O and 0.1% formic acid. The analyses were performed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass

spectrometer (Thermofisher Scientific), equipped with electrospray (ESI) ion source operating in
positive ion mode. The instrument is coupled to an UHPLC Ultimate 3000 (Thermofisher Scientific).
The chromatographic analysis was performed on a column Acquity UPLC Waters CSH C18 130Å (1
mm X 100 mm, 1,7 µm, Waters) using a linear gradient and the eluents were 0.1% formic acid in water
(phase A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (phase B). The flow rate was maintained at 100 μl/min
and column oven temperature at 50°C. The mass spectra were recorded in the mass to charge (m/z)
range 200-2000 at resolution 35K at m/z 200. The mass spectra were acquired using a “data dependent
scan”, able to acquire both the full mass spectra in high resolution and to “isolate and fragment” the
ten ions with highest intensity present in the full mass spectrum. The raw data obtained were analyzed
using the Biopharma Finder 2.1 software from ThermoFisher Scientific.
The elaboration process consisted in the comparison between the peak list obtained “in silico”
considering the expected aminoacidic sequence of human ACE2 protein (Uniprot ID: Q9BYF1),
trypsin as digestion enzyme and eventual modifications (carbamidomethylation, oxidation, etc.).

Results

3.1

ACE2 expression pattern in human pancreas

To determine the ACE2 protein expression pattern in human pancreatic tissue, we first performed a
colorimetric immunohistochemistry analysis to detect ACE2 on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
(FFPE) pancreatic sections obtained from seven (n=7) adult non-diabetic multiorgan donors collected
by the INNODIA EUnPOD biobank (Table S1). To specifically detect ACE2 protein in such context,
we initially used a previously validated monoclonal anti-human ACE2 antibody (R&D MAB933) (7)
which passed the validation criteria suggested by the International Working Group for Antibody
Validation (IWGAV) (7,40) (see Resources Table in Supplementary Material). For each pancreas,
two sections derived from two different FFPE tissue blocks belonging to different parts of the organ
(head, body or tail) were analysed. Based on pancreas morphometry and histological composition, we
identified three main cell types positive for ACE2 (Figure 1, panel-a to -f). In the exocrine pancreas
there was a marked and intense staining in a subset of vascular components (endothelial cells or
pericytes) found in inter-acini septa (Figure 1, panel-a and -b). We also identified ACE2 positive cells
in the pancreatic ducts, even though only some scattered cells with a clear ACE2 signal were detected
(Figure 1, panel-c and -d). Of interest, we observed a peculiar ACE2 staining pattern in the endocrine
pancreatic islets, showing a diffuse ACE2 signal in a subset of cells within islet parenchyma (Figure
1, panel -e and -f; Figure S2). However, the observed ACE2 expression in islets was lower than the
expression observed in microvasculature, the latter representing the main site for ACE2 expression in
the pancreas.
In all cases analysed, including different blocks of the same case, a similar expression pattern of ACE2
was observed, even though a certain degree of variability in terms of ACE2 staining intensity within
the islets was noted (Figure S2).

The highest signal of ACE2 within the pancreas was observed in putative association with
microvasculature (Figure 1, panel-a and -b). Of note, in such context, a lobular staining pattern of
microvasculature associated ACE2 was evident, as demonstrated by the presence of positive cells in
certain lobules and low or null expression in other lobules of the same pancreas section (Figure 2A).
ACE2 staining pattern in inter-acini septa suggested an overlap with cells associated to
microvasculature, most likely endothelial cells. In order to explore such possibility, we performed a
double immunofluorescent staining on pancreas FFPE sections for ACE2 and the endothelial cell
specific marker CD31. The results showed that ACE2 signal is associated, but not superimposed, to
the CD31-specific one, thus resembling the tight association of pericytes to endothelial cells and
strongly suggesting the presence of ACE2 in microvasculature pericytes (Figure 2B).

In order to confirm the ACE2 cellular distribution observed in the pancreas using MAB933 antibody,
we tested two additional anti-ACE2 antibodies from Abcam: Ab15348 and Ab108252 (see Resources
Table). According to the informations obtained by R&D and Abcam, while MAB933 and Ab15348
are reported to recognize the C-terminus portion of ACE2 (18-740aa and 788-805aa, respectively),
Ab108252 is specifically designed to react with a linear peptide located in the N-terminal ACE2 protein
sequence (200-300aa). It has been recently reported that a 459 aa short-ACE2 isoform (357-805aa of
ACE2 + 10aa at N-terminus) can be co-expressed alongside the full-length ACE2 protein (1-805aa)
(Figure 3A) (24,25); the short-ACE2 misses part of the N-terminal region targeted by Ab108252
antibody. We observed ACE2 islet-related signal using both MAB933 (Figure 3B) and Ab15348
(Figure 3C), but the Ab108252 antibody did not show any positivity within the islet parenchyma
(Figure 3D), raising the possibility that the most prevalent ACE2 isoform within pancreatic islets is
the short one. Of note, the three antibodies tested showed ACE2 positivity in the microvasculature,
thus suggesting a putative differential distribution of the two ACE2-isoforms in the human pancreas.

As a positive control for our immunohistochemistry method and ACE2 antibodies adopted, we
evaluated FFPE lung tissue sections. As previously shown (7,41,42), we observed scattered positive
cells (putatively AT2 pneumocytes) in the alveolar epithelium both using MAB933 and Ab15348
(Figure S3A and S3B). In contrast, we did not observe any signal using Ab108252 (Figure S3C).
Collectively, these results indicate that the same staining pattern were obtained by using 2 out of 3
antibodies that may recognize both ACE2 isoform (short-ACE2 and long-ACE2) thus confirming: (i)
a high ACE2 expression in microvasculature pericytes; (ii) rare scattered ACE2 positive ductal cells;
(iii) diffuse though weak ACE2 positive staining in a subset of cells within human pancreatic islets.

3.2

In human pancreatic islets ACE2 is preferentially expressed in β-cells

Using both MAB933 and Ab15348 we observed ACE2 signal in pancreatic islets which suggests that
ACE2 is expressed in endocrine cells. Therefore, we sought to determine which pancreatic islet cell
subset contributes to ACE2 signal in such context. To do so, we performed a triple
immunofluorescence analysis on the same set of FFPE pancreatic sections of non-diabetic multiorgan
donors, aimed at detecting glucagon-positive α-cells, insulin-positive β-cells and ACE2 signals
(Figure 4 and Figure S4).
Using R&D MAB933, ACE2 preferentially overlapped with the insulin-positive β-cells (Figure 4A,
panel-a to -m), being mostly colocalized with insulin and low/not detectable in α-cells (Figure 4A,
panel-e, -f, -l , -m). Such staining pattern was observed in all cases and was consistent between two
different FFPE pancreas blocks of the same case (Table S2). As expected, ACE2-only positive cells
within or around pancreatic islets were also observed (Figure 4A, panel g), potentially indicating the
presence of ACE2-positive pericytes interspersed in the islet parenchyma or surrounding it.

Intriguingly, in the β-cells a major fraction of ACE2 was observed in the cytoplasm and partially
overlapped with insulin positive signal, while in a subsets of them only a minor fraction of the ACE2
signal was attributable to several spots located on plasma membrane (Figure 4A; Figure S5A red
arrow, and Figure S5B). In microvasculature pericytes, the ACE2-positive signal was mainly
observed in plasma membrane (Figure 4A, panel g; Figure S5 green arrow) as previously described
(43). There were also some ACE2-negative β-cells (Figure S5, white arrow).
Colocalization rate analysis between ACE2-insulin and ACE2-glucagon, performed on a total of 128
single pancreatic islets from seven different adult non-diabetic cases, confirmed the significant
preferential expression of ACE2 in β-cells compared to α-cells (colocalization rate: ACE2-INS
57.6±19.3% vs. ACE2-GCG 6.8±5.4 % p<0.±0001) (Figure 4B and Figure S6A) The comparison of
colocalization rates between ACE2-insulin and ACE2-glucagon among all cases analysed, confirmed
the consistent preferential expression of ACE2 in β-cells in comparison to α-cells (Figure 4B). These
results were confirmed when comparing different blocks of the same case (Table S2). There was
however heterogeneity in terms of the ACE2-insulin colocalization rate among different islets (ACE2INS colocalization rate range: 0.6 – 91.4%). Such heterogeneity was also highlighted by the presence
of rare ACE2-negative pancreatic islets in the same pancreas section.
Inter-islets heterogeneity was also clearly observed regarding ACE2 islet-related signal intensity
analysis (Figure 4D).
Of note, some cases showed a lower ACE2-insulin mean colocalization rate and islet-ACE2 signal
intensity compared to the other ones (Figure 4D), thus suggesting a high degree of heterogeneity
among cases also in terms of islet-ACE2 expression. No significant correlation between ACE2-islets
signal intensity and Age, BMI or cold-ischemia time were observed in our donors cohort (Figure S6B).

3.3

A short ACE2 isoform is prevalently expressed in the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1

Using Western Blot (WB) and immunofluorescence analysis, we explored the expression of ACE2 in
the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1, a model of functional β-cells for diabetes research (27,44). To do
so we used R&D MAB933, Abcam Ab15348 and Ab108252 antibodies, as previously done in the
above described pancreas immunohistochemistry experiments. In WB analysis, MAB933 revealed the
presence of a prevalent 50 kDa band corresponding to the short-ACE2 isoform; use of this ab showed
the brightest signal in immunofluorescence staining among the three antibodies tested (Figure 5A).
Abcam Ab15348 worked better in WB for the recognition of both ACE2 isoforms, and indicated that
the most prevalent ACE2 isoform present in human β-cells is the short-ACE2 (50 kDa, blue arrow)
(Figure 5B). In contrast, Ab108252 recognized only the long-ACE2 isoform (>110 kDa- red arrow)
(Figure 5C). Of note, the results obtained through WB analysis are in line with the
immunofluorescence signal which revealed that Ab108252 only stained a minor fraction of EndoCβH1 and the obtained signal was mainly found on the plasma membrane (Figure 5C, panel-b).
Conversely, Ab15348 and MAB933, which recognized both ACE2 isoforms, showed a higher signal
and a different subcellular localization respect to Ab108252 (Figure 5A, 5B, panel-b). MAB933
ACE2-insulin double immunofluorescence staining confirmed the main punctuate and likely granular
cytoplasmic ACE2 signal which also partially overlapped with insulin-positive secretory granules
(Figure 5D, panel -a to panel -h). In addition, we also observed some spots putatively localised on
the plasma membrane (Figure 5D). Of note, the specificity of ACE2 MAB933 signal observed in
EndoC-βH1 was orthogonally tested in comparison to HeLa cells which showed very low/absent ACE2
mRNA expression (Figure S7A) and resulted indeed negative for ACE2 in immunofluorescence
(Figure S7B).
An additional evidence of the presence of ACE2 in EndoC-βH1 was provided by the shotgun proteomic
analysis, aimed at detecting specific peptides derived from ACE2 protein independently of the use of

specific antibodies. By this independent approach, we observed the presence of both N-terminal and
C-terminal unique ACE2-derived peptides (Figure S8), which further confirmed the presence of the
ACE-2 protein in human β-cells (Supplementary File 1a, 1b).

3.3

Total ACE2 mRNA is expressed in human pancreatic islets and in the human beta-cell

line EndoC-βH1
To confirm the ACE2 expression in human islets, we also evaluated its transcriptional activity both in
collagenase-isolated and in Laser-Capture Microdissected (LCM) human pancreatic islets, by
measuring its mRNA expression using TaqMan RT-Real Time PCR. In order to avoid detection of
genomic DNA, we used specific primers set generating an amplicon spanning the exons 17-18 junction
of ACE2 gene, thus uniquely identifying its mRNA (Figure S9A). Of note, the selected amplicon is
shared between short and long-ACE2 isoforms thus identifying total ACE2 mRNA.
First, as a positive control we analysed total ACE2 expression in RNA extracted from a lung
parenchyma biopsy tissue (Figure 6A and 6E). Collagenase-isolated human pancreatic islets obtained
from four different non-diabetic donors pancreata (Table S1) showed ACE2 mRNA expression, as
demonstrated by RT-Real-Time PCR raw cycle threshold (Ct) values, reporting a Ct range between
28-29 (Figure 6B and 6F). Since human pancreatic islets enzymatic isolation procedures may induce
some changes in gene expression (45), we microdissected human islets from frozen pancreatic tissues
obtained from five non-diabetic multiorgan donors recruited within INNODIA EUnPOD network (46)
and evaluated ACE2 mRNA levels. The LCM procedure (Figure S9B) allowed us to extract high
quality total RNA (Figure S9C) from human pancreatic islets directly obtained from their native
microenvironment, thus maintaining transcriptional architecture. ACE2 mRNA expression in LCM-

human pancreatic islets showed a consistent expression among cases, similar to isolated islets, as
shown by ACE2 mRNA raw Ct and normalized values (Figure 5C and 5G).
Finally, we analysed total ACE2 mRNA expression in the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1. Analysis of
ACE2 mRNA expression in these cells demonstrated a similar expression level in comparison to human
pancreatic islets (Figure 3D and 3H), with raw Ct values ranging from 28 to 30.

3.4

ACE2 expression is increased in EndoC-βH1 cells and in human pancreatic islets by pro-

inflammatory cytokines
In order to determine whether metabolic or inflammatory stress conditions modify pancreatic endocrine
β-cell expression of ACE2, we exposed the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1 and isolated human
pancreatic islets to metabolic or inflammatory stressors and subsequently evaluated ACE2 expression
levels.
Exposure to palmitate (2mM palmitate for 24 h) did not significantly modulate ACE2 expression
(Figure 6A). In line with these observations, neither primary human islets exposed to palmitate (47)
nor human islets isolated from patients affected by type 2 diabetes (48) and evaluated by RNA
sequencing showed any increase in ACE2 mRNA expression as compared to the respective controls
(respectively 0.9 control vs 0.5 palmitate and 2.4 control vs 3.5 T2D; data reported as Trimmed Means
of M values (TMM); not significant). On the other hand, upon 24 h exposure to a pro-inflammatory
cytokines mix (IL-1β- IFNγ and TNFα), EndoC-βH1 cells significantly upregulated ACE2 mRNA
levels (fold change: 12.3 vs. not-treated control, p=0.031) (Figure 6A). The same results were
confirmed through immunofluorescence analysis aimed at measuring ACE2 protein levels and
subcellular localization in EndoC-βH1 exposed or not to the same proinflammatory condition (Figure

6C). Indeed, we observed a significant increase in ACE2 mean intensity values upon cytokine
treatment, confirming the upregulation of ACE2 protein as well (Figure 6E). These results were
confirmed using an automated micro-confocal high content images screening system (31) which
allowed us to measure ACE2 intensity in cytokine-treated vs not-treated EndoC-βH1 cells (Figure 6D
and Figure 6F).
In support of the observed increase of ACE2 upon pro-inflammatory stress, RNA sequencing data
analysis of EndoC-βH1 cells exposed to IL-1β+IFNγ (48h) or to IFNα (18h) further confirmed such
increase (Table S3). Indeed, we observed a 24.5 and 55.2 fold-increase (p<0.0001) in total ACE2
mRNA [transcript (ENST00000252519.8)] (Table S3 and Figure S10A) expression in EndoC-βH1
cells treated with IL-1β+IFNγ or with IFNα, respectively. Importantly, the same expression pattern
was observed also in human pancreatic islets exposed to the same cytokines mix, as demonstrated by
a 2.4 and 5.1 fold-increase in ACE2 mRNA expression following IL-1β+IFNγ or IFNα treatment
respectively (p<0.0001) (Table S3 and Figure S10B).
Additionally, in order to strengthen such observations, we focussed on the ACE2 gene promoter by
analysing its upstream sequence (-1000 bp), from ACE2 transcriptional start site (TSS). Using two
different transcription factors (TF) binding motifs databases, we found several binding sites for TFs
related to cytokine signalling pathways such as STAT1 or STAT3 (Figure S11), thus reinforcing our
results of an association between inflammation and ACE2 expression, and confirming what previously
reported (65). However, the analysis of ACE2 expression distribution in FFPE pancreas sections from
a T1D longstanding donor (see Table S1) did not show remarkable changes in the levels or distribution
of ACE2 in infiltrated islets (Figure S12). This is in line with RNAseq analysis of whole islets from
two T1D patients and four controls, which indicated similar ACE2 expression (RPKM 1.2-1.7 in all
cases) (49). Analysis of additional recent-onset T1D donors is needed to evaluate potential changes in
ACE2 expression in β-cells of highly infiltrated pancreatic islets.

Collectively these results demonstrate that ACE2 is upregulated upon in vitro exposure to early and
acute inflammatory, but not metabolic, stressors both in EndoC-βH1 and in human pancreatic islets.

Discussion

In COVID-19 disease, clinical complications involving the metabolic/endocrine system are frequently
observed. These include critical alterations of glycaemic control in diabetic patients and new-onset
hyperglycaemia at admission in individuals without previous clinical history of diabetes. Although
multiple causes have been indicated for COVID-19-related hyperglycaemia, a recently published case
report described autoantibody-negative insulin-dependent diabetes onset in a young patient who was
infected by SARS-CoV-2 seven weeks before occurrence of diabetes symptoms. This suggests a
potential effect (direct or indirect) of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the pancreatic islet insulin
producing β-cells, but additional evidence is needed to allow solid conclusions.
Previous studies suggested that ACE2, the human host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,
which in other tissues has been shown to be a necessary component for infection permissiveness (6,50)
is expressed in pancreatic tissue (19). However, an in-depth analysis aimed at evaluating ACE2
expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we adopted multiple
technologies and reagents to thoroughly analyse presence of ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level,
in order to evaluate its expression and localization in pancreatic tissue samples obtained from adult
non-diabetic multiorgan donors from the INNODIA EUnPOD biobank collection, in enzymatic- and
LCM-isolated primary adult human pancreatic islets and in human β-cell line EndoC-βH1.
In human adult pancreas, we primarily observed ACE2 expression in microvasculature component
(endothelial cells-associated pericytes, both in endocrine and exocrine compartments). The expression
of ACE2 in the pancreatic microvasculature compartment was associated, but not superimposed, to the
endothelial cells specific marker CD31 (or PECAM-1). Such staining pattern strongly suggests the
presence of ACE2 in pancreatic vascular pericytes which are tightly associated to endothelial cells.

Of interest, although the exocrine pancreas and the pancreatic islets are highly vascularized (51), only
a subset of pancreatic pericytes cells markedly express ACE2. Additionally, ACE2 expression in
microvascular compartment is surprisingly lobular, resembling the heterogeneous staining pattern of
several inflammatory markers. Additional observations on multiple pancreatic lobules are required to
confirm such heterogeneous lobular patterning observed.
The presence of ACE2 in pancreatic pericytes is of sure interest. As a matter of fact, the vascular
leakage and endothelitis were reported as a typical sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various organs,
driving early local inflammation and the subsequent exacerbation of immune responses (52,53). Of
note, multiple studies addressed the importance of an intact islet microvasculature in order to render
pancreatic islets fully functional (54,55). Therefore, a pancreatic islet local vascular damage and
inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 direct infection of ACE2+ pancreatic pericyte cells is a potential
contributory factor for islet dysfunction. Of note, two recent preprint manuscripts also indicated the
presence of ACE2 expression in pancreatic microvasculature (56,57).
Our results indicate that ACE2 is expressed also in the pancreatic islets and this expression is mostly
located in β-cells as compared to α-cells. These results are in contrast with the two recent preprint
manuscripts (56,57) which failed to observe ACE2 expression in pancreatic islet endocrine cells. Such
discrepancies may be explained by a resulting sum of differences in primary antibodies sensitivity,
different epitopes targeted, tissue sections preparation and pre-treatment, as well as immunodetection
methodology sensitivity (immunohistochemistry vs. immunofluorescence). Such variables may be of
critical importance when detecting a low-expressed protein and may generate different results.
Furthermore, it should be taken into consideration that ACE2 expression may vary greatly among
individuals due to genetic or environmental factors (58). Such intrinsic ACE2 variability has been
previously observed also in other cellular contexts, with some authors reporting high ACE2 levels and
others low or absent (59).

In our study, localization of ACE2 in pancreatic islet endocrine cells was observed using two out of
three different antibodies tested. Surprisingly, we were not able to observe ACE2 pancreatic islets
positive signal using Abcam monoclonal antibody Ab108252, while signal was clearly evident in
microvasculature and scattered ductal cells. However, these results are in line with Kusmartseva et al
2020 (57). Of note, Ab108252 monoclonal antibody specifically targets an epitope located in the Nterminal domain of ACE2 protein (200-300aa) which is missing in the recently discovered truncated
ACE2 isoform (short-ACE2, 357-805aa) (24,25), thus being capable to recognize only the long-ACE2
isoform. On the contrary, by using two different antibodies (MAB933 and Ab15348) - which can
recognize the C-terminal domain shared between short- and long-ACE2 - we obtained clear and
concordant results, with identification of ACE2 in pancreatic islet endocrine cells in addition to the
microvasculature. As a positive control for the antibodies and our IHC procedure, MAB933 and
Ab15348 were also tested in FFPE lung tissue sections, showing overlapping results with previously
published studies (7,41,42).
Overall, these results suggest that the short-ACE2 isoform may be the prevalent one expressed in βcells. Indeed, ACE2 western blot analyses of the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1 support this hypothesis
by confirming that: (i) short-ACE2 is prevalent over long-ACE2, the latter being present but with low
expressed in β-cells; (ii) Abcam Ab108252 cannot recognize the short-ACE2 isoform. Based on these
results we suggest that in human β-cells both ACE2 isoforms are present, with a predominance of the
short-ACE2.
Although the presence of the short-ACE2 isoform, alongside with long-ACE2, is clearly evident in
human β-cells, its functional role remains to be established. A previous study suggested the ability of
the short-ACE2 isoform to form homodimers or heterodimer with the long-ACE2 isoform, thus
potentially being able to modulate both the activity and structural protein domains conformation of the
long-ACE2 (22). Significantly, short-ACE2 is missing the aminoacidic residues reported as

fundamental for virus binding; however, due to the lack of detailed data regarding its function we
cannot exclude that the short-ACE2 may modulate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility by interacting with
long-ACE2 or additional membrane proteins which may mediate the binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein [e.g. ITGA5, as previously observed (60)]. Of interest, nasal epithelium, reported to represent
the main reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 (61), showed higher levels of short-ACE2 vs. long-ACE2 (24).
As described above, we report that in human pancreatic islets ACE2 is enriched in insulin-producing
β-cells. This in-situ ACE2 expression pattern data are in line with three different bulk RNA-seq datasets
analysing human β- and α-cells transcriptome, reporting higher expression of ACE2 mRNA in β-cells
as compared to α-cells (62–64) (Figure S13D-F). Of note, such datasets rely on β- or α-cells bulk
RNA-seq and do not suffer from common limitations present in single-cell RNA seq (65), which
usually detects only 1,000-3,000 genes/cell, thus representing a minor fraction (25-30%) of the total
number of genes identified by bulk cells RNA sequencing (>20,000 genes). Another recent study
analyzed SARS-CoV-2 host receptors expression using two different methods (microarray and bulk
RNA-seq) and further confirmed that ACE2 is indeed expressed in human pancreatic islets, and also
demonstrated that ACE2 expression was higher in sorted pancreatic β-cells relative to other endocrine
cells (66). Additional evidence of ACE2 expression in endocrine pancreas and in β-cells derive also
from mouse studies, which demonstrated ACE2 expression in insulin-producing cells as well as its
critical role in the regulation of β-cell phenotype and function (67–70).
Collectively, our in-situ expression data alongside with multiple published datasets and reports both in
human and mouse show that ACE2 is expressed in pancreatic islets, albeit at relatively low levels.
ACE2 expression in human β-cells may render these cells sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 entry (23). Such
hypothesis is consistent with the known sensitivity of these cells to infection by several enterovirus
serotypes. Indeed, multiple evidence from our and other groups (71–74) showed that enteroviruses are
capable to competently infect β-cells but less so α-cells (75,76); these viruses are thus being considered

as one of the potential triggering causes of type 1 diabetes (T1D) (77). Of note, it has been previously
demonstrated that human β-cells exclusively express virus receptor isoform Coxsackie and adenovirus
receptor-SIV (CAR-SIV), making them prone to infection by certain viruses (78). Therefore, it would
not be surprising that, under particular conditions, human β-cells could be directly infected by SARSCoV-2. Importantly, a recent report showed that human pancreatic islets can be infected in vitro by
SARS-CoV-2 (23), supporting our observations of a specific tropism of the virus due to ACE2
expression.
Noteworthy, the subcellular localization of ACE2 in β-cells recapitulates what was previously found
for the virus receptor CAR-SIV (78). In our dataset, ACE2 protein signal is mostly
cytoplasmic/granular and partially overlaps with insulin granules. Additional spots are also localized
close to the plasma membrane, thus suggesting the existence of ACE2 isoforms in multiple
compartments within β-cells. Such subcellular localization was observed both in-vitro in EndoC-βH1
and ex vivo in β-cells of primary human pancreatic tissues. Although ACE2 has been primarily
observed on cell surfaces (42,79), some studies also described ACE2 granular localization in other cell
types of epithelial origin (9,80). A similar intracellular localization and putative trafficking was
observed for the viral receptor CAR-SIV (78), also expected to be mainly localized on the cell
membrane. Against this background, we speculate that: (i) upon activation, ACE2 can be internalized
through endosome/lysosome pathway (81); (ii) in β-cells, ACE2 trafficking to cell membrane may be
mediated by insulin granules; (iii) in β-cells the short-ACE2 isoform could be mainly localized in
cytoplasm, while long-ACE2 in the plasma membrane; (iii) ACE2 can be secreted and found in a
soluble form or within exosomes (82,83). Additional studies are needed to fully ascertain the
subcellular localization and trafficking of ACE2 isoforms in human β-cells, and to determine whether
ACE2 is indeed present in the secretome of β-cells.
Our data also indicate that in β-cells, total ACE2 mRNA expression is upregulated upon different proinflammatory conditions, but not following exposure to the metabolic stressor palmitate or to the T2D

environment. Importantly, these observations were obtained both in the human β-cell line EndoC-βH1
and in human primary pancreatic islet cells, as shown by qRT-PCR, RNA-seq datasets and
immunofluorescence. As a matter of fact, ACE2 has been previously indicated as an interferonstimulated gene (ISG) in a variety of cells (58). Of interest, a previous report suggested that the shortACE2 may represent the prevalent ACE2 isoform upregulated upon inflammatory stress (25).
However, whether this is the case also in human β-cells it should be examined in depth in future studies.
Although total ACE2 expression is increased upon inflammatory stress, in-situ analysis of ACE2 in
infiltrated pancreatic islets derived from FFPE sections of a pancreas from a longstanding T1D donor
did not reveal significant changes of SARS-CoV2 receptor expression. However, we recognize that a
high number of pancreatic islets with different degree of inflammation, and pancreata from recentonset T1D donors showing highly infiltrated islets are needed to adequately characterize ACE2
expression in the early stages of the disease and to determine whether changes in ACE2 expression
contribute to: (i) the observed alteration of glycaemic control at admission in SARS-CoV-2 individuals
without previous clinical history of diabetes; (ii) the increased severity of COVID-19 in those subjects
with previous inflammatory-based diseases.
In conclusion, the presently described preferential expression of ACE2 isoforms in human β-cells,
alongside with ACE2 upregulation under pro-inflammatory conditions in-vitro, identifies the putative
molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 tropism for pancreatic islets and uncovers a link between
inflammation and ACE2 expression levels in islet β-cells. Further mechanistic studies and
epidemiological evaluation of individuals affected by COVID-19, including long-term clinical follow
up and determination of islet autoantibodies, may help to clarify whether human β-cells are among the
target cells of SARS-CoV-2 virus and whether β-cell damage, with the potential induction of
autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals, occurs during and/or after infection.

Figure Titles and legends

Figure 1. ACE2 staining pattern in human pancreas. Immunohistochemistry for ACE2 in human
pancreatic tissue sections (case #110118) using R&D MAB933 antibody. ACE2 is markedly expressed
in microvasculature associated cells (panel-a and -b), in some rare ductal cells (panel-c and -d) and in
a subset of endocrine cells within pancreatic islets (panel-e and -f). Scale bars in panel-a, -c and -e: 150
µm. Scale bars in panel-b, -d and-f: 70 µm. Zoom-in images are reported in panel -b, -d and -f.

Figure 2. In microvasculature, ACE2 is putatively expressed in pericytes. (A) Representative
image of human pancreatic Formalin-Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) section stained for ACE2 in
case #301118. In panel-a, a representative image of a pancreatic section showing two adjacent lobules
(blue and red dotted lines) with different staining for ACE2 in endothelial cells/pericytes. A specific
segmentation of the two lobules with high (blue) (zoom-in, panel-b) and low or null expression of
ACE2 (red) (zoom-in, panel-c) is shown, suggesting lobularity of ACE2 expression in exocrine
endothelial cells/pericytes of human pancreas. Scale bar in panel-a: 100 µm. Scale bar in panel-b and
-c: 30 µm. (B) Double immunofluorescence staining of ACE2 (green) and CD31 (red) in FFPE
pancreas sections from Body01A of Case #110118 (panel-a to –d) and of Body01B of Case #141117
(panel-e to –i). Digital zoom-in overlay images are shown in panels -d, -h and –i. Scale bar in panel-d
and –g: 100 μm.
