Summary
T cells play pivotal roles in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2
infection. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells mediate the production of antigen-specific
antibodies; however, T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes used by SARS-CoV-2-specific
Tfh cells have not been well characterized. Here, we first identified and crystallized
public TCR of Tfh clonotypes that are shared and expanded in unhospitalized
COVID-19-recovered

patients.

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein epitopes which are conserved among emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants. These clonotypes did not react with S proteins derived from
common cold human coronaviruses, but cross-reacted with symbiotic bacteria, which
might confer the publicity. Among SARS-CoV-2 S epitopes, S864-882, presented by
frequent HLA-DR alleles, could activate multiple public Tfh clonotypes in
COVID-19-recovered

patients.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused
a worldwide pandemic with emerging mutations and continuous development of robust
vaccine is imperative. Neutralizing antibodies are a major component of a protective
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (Tay et al., 2020), and thus information about
virus-specific CD4+ T cells that help B cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies is
needed. Among CD4+ T cells, follicular helper T (Tfh) cells mediate germinal center B
cells maturation and production of high affinity antibodies (Crotty, 2019). Some
deceased COVID-19 patients exhibited incomplete Tfh cell development (Kaneko et al.,
2020), suggesting that efficient Tfh induction is a key to protective immunity against
SARS-CoV-2 (Gong et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Furthermore, the characterization
of SARS-CoV-2-specific Tfh cells bearing common TCR shared between different
individuals will help us to understand and predict host responses during infection.
However, such public Tfh clonotypes specific for SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been
reported.
Given that V(D)J recombination is a random process, presence of shared TCR
between individuals is generally thought to be a rare event (Soto et al., 2020; Venturi et
al., 2008). Common antigens are one of the reasons that maintain such public
clonotypes in the periphery (Li et al., 2012; Venturi et al., 2008). Recently, some T cells
recognizing common cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are reported to cross-react
with SARS-CoV-2 (Braun et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020; Woldemeskel et al., 2020),
whereas SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells that do not react with HCoVs are frequently

detected (Bacher et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020). Currently, other cross-reactive
antigens recognized by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have not been well examined.
In this study, using single cell-based paired TCR analysis together with a
rapid TCR reconstitution and epitope determination platform, we identified 1) public
TCRs of Tfh cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 expanded in convalescent patients, 2) their
epitope peptides and restricting HLA alleles, and 3) their cross-reactive proteins from
symbiotic bacteria.

Results
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific Tfh clones in convalescent
COVID-19 patients
We first analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell subsets and their clonotypes
using a single cell-based RNA sequencing platform. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) isolated from healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients (Table S1
and S2) were stimulated with antigens derived from SARS-CoV-2, including
inactivated virus, recombinant S protein, overlapped peptide pools derived from S
protein (S peptide pool) or membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (MN peptide
pool). Activation marker-positive T cells were sorted and analyzed for their T cell
receptor (TCR) sequences together with RNA expression by single cell TCR-seq and
RNA-seq analyses (Figure S1). UMAP embedding and clustering allowed identification
of a cluster (#8) consisting of CD4+ cells expressing Tfh-related genes, such as CD200,
PDCD1, ICOS, CXCL13, CD40LG and CXCR5, suggesting that cluster #8 includes
circulating Tfh cells (Crotty, 2019; Schmitt et al., 2014) (Figure 1A and 1B). Within
this Tfh cluster, we could identify 1735 TCRs (Table S3). Furthermore, in the
S-reactive Tfh cluster, we detected clones bearing TCRαβ pairs shared between
different patients, Ts-017 and Ts-018, who had antibodies against receptor binding
domain (RBD) of S protein and neutralizing antibodies (Table S1). Considering the cell
number of single cell TCR-seq, these are likely to be frequent public TCRs and we
designated them as TCR-017 and TCR-018, respectively. TCR-017 and -018 had the
same Vα, Jα, Vβ and Jβ usages and their complementarity-determining region 3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.436573; this version posted March 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

(CDR3) sequences were identical except for one amino acid in CDR3β (Figure 1C and
1D). TCR-018 was detected in patient Ts-018 as three different barcoded clones within
S protein/peptides-reactive Tfh cluster (Table S3).

Tfh clones derived from different patients recognized an identical S epitope
restricted by the same HLAs
To examine the antigen specificity of TCR-017 and -018, the respective
TCRα and β chains were reconstituted in a TCR-deficient T cell hybridoma bearing an
NFAT-GFP reporter (Figure 1E). TCR-transfectants were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2
antigens in the presence of transformed B cells derived from the same patients as
autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Cells expressing TCR-017 and -018
responded to recombinant S protein and S peptide pool, but not to MN peptide pool
(Figure 2A), which is consistent with the initial antigen specificity revealed in single
cell analysis (Table S3). Among two halves of pooled S peptides, #1 (S1-643) and #2
(S633-1273), only #2 pool reacted with both TCRs (Figure 2B). However, another
SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pool (S304-338, 421-475, 492-519, 683-707, 741-770, 785-802, 885-1273) did not
activate either clone (Figure S2A and Figure 2B). The above results suggest that the
antigen epitope(s) of TCR-017 and -018 is located in regions 633-682, 708-740,
771-784 or 803-884 of S protein (Figure S2A).
To further reduce the number of epitope candidates, we next determined the
HLA alleles that restrict TCR-017 and -018. Heterologous APCs from patient Ts-017
could activate TCR-018, and vice versa, demonstrating that these APCs are

DRA-DRB1*15:01, DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 or DPA1*02:02-DPB1*05:01 (shown
in red in Table S2), are likely to restrict this recognition. Since DRB1*15:01 and
DQB1*06:02 are genetically linked and would not be segregated from each other
(Begovich et al., 1992), these HLA alleles were separately transfected into HEK293T
cells to examine their ability to present S peptides to TCR-017 and -018. Only cells
transfected with DRA and DRB1*15:01 could activate both clones in the presence of S
peptide pool #2 (Figure 2C), suggesting that the reactivity is determined by
DRB1*15:01, as DRA is monomorphic. Two epitopes, S828-846 and S864-882, were
predicted as strong binders to DRA-DRB1*15:01 using NetMHC server software
(Reynisson et al., 2020) within the candidate regions described above (Figure S2A).
Among them, S864-882 was identified as the epitope for both clones (Figure 2D). Judging
from their dose-response curves, relative affinities of TCR-017 and -018 to this peptide
appeared comparable (Figure 2E). Furthermore, antigenic activities of serial
overlapping peptides indicated that S870-878 is a minimum epitope recognized by these
TCRs (Figure 2F). Taken together, both TCR-017 and -018 recognized the same epitope
on the same HLA with similar affinities, indicating that TCR-017 and -018 are
considered as one clonotype, clonotype-017/018, shared by different donors.
Among other HLAs predicted to strongly bind S864-882 (Reynisson et al., 2020),

Public clonotypes significantly expanded in recovered-COVID-19 patients
preferentially recognize conserved S epitopes
Consistent with the high frequency of DRB1*15:02 (10.6%) and *15:01
(7.7%) in the Japanese population (http:/hla.or.jp), bulk TCR sequencing of
pre-pandemic Japanese donors revealed that TCRα and β chains of clonotype-017/018
were broadly shared by 14.8% and 33.3%, respectively, of the population (Figure 2G).
As DRB1*15 are not minor alleles worldwide (Gonzalez-Galarza et al., 2020), we
analyzed TCR databases of healthy and convalescent COVID-19 cohorts containing
donors of various ethnicities (Emerson et al., 2017; Nolan et al., 2020) and found that
17% and 24%, respectively, possessed TCRβ-017/018 (Figure 2H). These results
suggest that clonotype-017/018 is a public clonotype in multiple ethnicities.
We therefore examined whether any of 1735 paired TCRs detected in our
sample pool are found in these cohorts. 855 out of 1735 were revealed to be public Tfh
TCRs (Table S3), indicating that TCR-017/018 is not an exceptional clonotype. Among
them, we identified 10 Tfh clonotypes which were significantly expanded in recovered
COVID-19 patients compared with the healthy cohort (Figure 3A, column J, asterisks).
Of note, a half of such clonotypes were indeed detected in multiple patients in our
sample pool by single cell TCR sequencing (Figure 3A, column A, #), and
TCR-017/018 was the fifth most significantly expanded clonotype (Figure 3A, column
A and J).
To efficiently determine the epitopes of these clonotypes, we established a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.436573; this version posted March 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

rapid epitope-determination platform (Figure S3A) and validated it using TCR-017/018
(Figure 3B, clonotype 5). By using this platform, we further determined the epitopes for
other COVID-19-expanded Tfh clonotypes (Figure 3B). Restricting HLAs of these
epitopes were determined using overlapped HLA alleles in the combination of
transformed B cells from different individuals, and individual HLA transfectants (Table
S2 and Figure S3B-S3F). These results indicate that the public Tfh clonotypes which
significantly expanded in unhospitalized, recovered patients preferentially recognized S
epitopes (Figure 3A and 3B). All identified epitopes were located in two major hotspots
within the conserved trimer-forming interface of S protein with low mutation rates
(Figure 3C)(Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Singer et al., 2020). In addition, the
donors of these clonotypes had anti-RBD and neutralizing antibodies (Table S1). These
results suggest that public Tfh clonotypes specific for conserved S epitopes have
expanded during SARS-CoV-2 infection and presumably contributed to the recovery
from mild symptoms (Emerson et al., 2017; Nolan et al., 2020).

Crystal structure revealed sequence flexibility of CDR3 that extends the publicity
of SARS-CoV-2-specific clonotypes
We demonstrated that TCRβ-017/018 is highly public and expanded in the
recovered patients (Figure 3A). Since the nonidentical amino acid, Q94 and P94 of
TCRβ-017 and -018, respectively, have distinct characteristics, we suspected that any
amino acid at this position allows epitope recognition. Indeed, any of 17 substitutions,
except for D94, retained the reactivity to S864-882 epitope on DRA-DRB1*15:01 (Figure

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.436573; this version posted March 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

4A). Indeed, crystallographic analysis of TCR-017 complex demonstrated that the
residue at position 94 in CDR3β is located away from CDR3α (Figure 4B and 4C) and
thus unlikely to contact with peptide-MHC. In addition, C90, A91, S92 and S93 were
more distant from CDR3α (Figure 4C), suggesting that this TCRβ may mainly utilize a
C-terminal half of CDR3β for recognition and allow diverse TCR sequence variants or
even other TRBVs.
This promiscuity within CDR3β sequence should expand the pool of this
public clonotype, which gives us a more precise expansion rate in recovered patients.
Indeed, the expansion of the extended clonotype in the COVID-19-recovered cohort
became much more significant (p = 1.6 × 10−6) (Figure 4D) than the value shown in
Figure 3A (p = 0.003). Furthermore, its occurrence became more than half in all three
cohorts (Figure 4E), suggesting that the extended clonotype 5 is broadly shared among a
large population.

Public Tfh clonotypes did not cross-react with HCoVs but with symbiotic bacteria
We next asked how these clonotypes, particularly clonotype 5, acquired
publicity. Cross-reactivity with the common cold coronaviruses is one of the possible
mechanisms (Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020). However,
none of the clonotypes identified in this study including TCR-017/018 reacted with S
proteins derived from common cold human coronavirus (HCoV) strains (Figure 3B and
Figure S3A, S4A and S4B). Indeed, these HCoVs do not have identical sequences to
SARS-CoV-2 epitopes determined in Figure 3B (Figure 5A). Furthermore, peptides in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.436573; this version posted March 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

the corresponding regions derived from these coronaviruses including severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were not recognized by TCR-017/018
(Figure S4C and S4D). Thus, these clonotypes are unlikely to acquire publicity by
cross-reacting with reported human coronaviruses present before the outbreak of
COVID-19. This raises a hypothesis that some other common antigen(s) may confer
publicity on these clonotypes. In line with this, BLAST homology search of S870-878 core
epitope revealed that oral commensal bacteria, Selenomonas noxia, express a protein,
multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family efflux transporter, that
includes the same epitope with S870-879, IAQYTSALLA (Figure 5A). Indeed, the
synthetic peptides (MATE241-260 and 242-256) were recognized by both TCR-017 and -018
on DRB1*15:01 (Figure 5B). In addition, if any amino acids within this S epitope are
replaceable, further cross-reactive proteins might be found. To identify such acceptable
substitutions, we performed Alanine/Glycine scanning of S870-878 peptides and found
that seven single substitutions, except for positions Q872 and T874, retained
antigenicity of the epitope (Figure 5C). Among these mutated epitopes, the sequence of
L877A (IAQYTSAAL) was found in a protein expressed by various bacteria, histidine
ammonia-lyase (HAL, EC 4.3.1.3)(Table S4 and Figure 5A).
Other 9 public Tfh clonotypes significantly expanded in patients were also
unresponsive to HCoVs (Figure 3B). Instead, homology searches for the epitopes of
these clonotypes (Figure 3B) revealed that S753-759, an epitope of clonotype 2, was
contained in proteins of various organisms including symbiotic bacteria, such as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.436573; this version posted March 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

Bacteroidales bacteria and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Atarashi et al., 2017; Sefik et al.,
2015) (Table S5 and Figure 5A). Indeed, these bacterial peptides, such as
TonB-dependent

and

transporter

ATP-binding/permease protein (YbtP)270-284, respectively, could activate T cells
reconstituted with clonotype 2 TCR (Figure 5D). Furthermore, E. coli transformed with
the expression vectors for these proteins could activate public clonotypes in the
presence of HLA-matched dendritic cells (Figure 5E), confirming that cross-reactive
antigenic epitopes are processed and presented by APCs. These observations suggest
that continuous priming via symbiotic bacteria might explain the high frequency of the
public clonotypes worldwide (Figure 4E). Further cohort studies will clarify the
etiological relationships between these bacteria and resistance against SARS-CoV-2
infection.

S864-882 could activate multiple public Tfh clonotypes
Among 1735 TCRs derived from Tfh cluster (Table S3), we identified another
clonotype from patient Ts-017 that recognizes the exact same epitope, S864-882, restricted
by DRB1*15:01, despite it had distinct V/J usages and CDR3 sequences/lengths from
TCR-017/018 (Figure S5). This clonotype was also public as it was detected in cohorts
(Table S3, Seurat barcode, DB2_CAAGAAAGTGCGGTAA). Thus, this epitope,
S864-882, could activate multiple public Tfh clonotypes even in the same patient.
To further examine the ability of this epitope to activate multiple Tfh
clonotypes,

DRB1*15:01/*15:02 were stimulated with S864-882 in vitro. After epitope-induced
expansion for 10 days, CD4+ T cells were subjected to single cell-TCR- and RNA-seq
to determine the antigen-responsive clonotypes (Figure 6A and Table S6). As a result,
we newly identified 104 public Tfh clonotypes that responded to S864-882 after filtering
by two criteria; 1) expanded during stimulation based on single cell sequencing (> 0.1%
of total CD4+ T cells) and 2) detected in cohort databases (Table S6, column K). Indeed,
bulk TCR sequencing demonstrated that both α and β chains of all 104 clonotypes were
expanded after S864-882 stimulation (Table S6, column I). For most of these clonotypes,
Tfh characteristics were observed even after in vitro stimulation (Table S6, column J).
These results indicate that S864-882 epitope is capable of expanding multiple public Tfh
clones in DRB1*15:01/02 donors.
To examine the presence of these S864-882-reactive clones in the periphery of
donors before in vitro expansion, we assembled all expanded TCRαβ pairs with bulk
TCR sequences of unstimulated peripheral T cells (Figure 6A, day 0). Approximately
20% of S864-882-reactive TCRα and β chains detected at day 10 (Table S6) were present
in the ‘day 0’ bulk TCR sequences from all recovered patients possessing anti-S protein
antibodies (Table S1), whereas none of such S864-882-reactive TCRs were detectable in
healthy control before stimulation (Figure 6B). This data provides an implication that
some S864-882-reactive Tfh clones have been expanded in recovered patients during
SARS-CoV-2 infection and maintained as a memory pool after infection.
To directly detect S864-882-reacting T cells in PBMCs, we generated
DRA-DRB1*15:01 tetramer loaded with this epitope, which was confirmed to bind to

recombinant soluble TCR-017αβ in vitro (Figure S6A and S6B). In healthy donors
possessing DRB1*15:01, tetramer-positive CD4+ T cells (approximately 0.005% of T
cells) expressed higher CXCR5 than tetramer-negative CD4+ cells (Figure 6C). After in
vitro activation by S864-882 peptide, the percentages of tetramer-positive CD4+ T cells
were markedly increased and CXCR5+ population was further accumulated (Figure 6C),
suggesting that S864-882 peptide is capable of generating activated CD4+ T cells with Tfh
profiles.
Discussion
Recently, public TCR for SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively studied
(Shomuradova et al., 2020). In this study, we report the first identification and structural
determination of SARS-CoV-2-specific public TCR of CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we
identified multiple public Tfh clonotypes that were significantly expanded in
COVID-19-recovered patients by preferentially recognizing conserved S epitopes.
These observations suggest that the individuals possessing such public Tfh
clonotypes could efficiently respond to S protein and produce antibodies against the
cognate antigen, which may contribute to the prevention of disease aggravation and
subsequent recovery (Table S1)(Emerson et al., 2017; Nolan et al., 2020). As these
public clonotypes were widely detected in multiple ethnicities, the precise monitoring of
the frequencies of public Tfh clonotypes using tetramer or clonotypic mAb could
provide a novel option for prognosis prediction. Furthermore, such common S epitopes
are candidates for next-generation vaccine that promote Tfh responses against
SARS-CoV-2 and prevent aggravation.

The current study still has several limitations. 1) We analyzed only PBMCs.
Although circulating Tfh cells in the periphery can reflect Tfh cells in germinal center
(Crotty, 2019; Heit et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2019; Locci et al., 2013; Schmitt et al., 2014),
the analysis of tissue resident Tfh cells of biopsy samples is ideal to fully characterize
Tfh clonotype. 2) Although the present study suggests that these Tfh clonotypes
contribute to amelioration of COVID-19 in patients recovered from mild symptoms,
additional studies on patients with severe symptoms are helpful for further aspects. 3)
The restricting HLA of the public clonotypes expanded in the patients were
DRA-DRB1*15:01 (8.8%), DRA-DRB1*15:02 (2.5%), DRA-DRB1*15:03 (2.0%),
DRA-DRB1*15:04 (0.02%), DRA-DRB4*01:03 (33.9% in local)(González-Quezada et
al.,

2019),

DPA1*01:03

(60.7%)-DPB1*04:02

(16.5%),

and

DPA1*02:02

(24.7%)-DPB1*05:01 (14.8%), which cover a large part of, but not all, population
worldwide (Gonzalez-Galarza et al., 2020).
Notwithstanding, the current study proposes that combination of single cell
paired TCR sequencing and public database is a potent tool to identify public
clonotypes which actually responded to SARS-CoV-2 in patients. The rapid
reconstitution and determination platform enables us to identify epitopes and
responsible HLA simultaneously. As the identified T cell epitopes are conserved among
emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Singer et al., 2020)
(Figure 3C), these peptides could become candidates for a robust vaccine against
mutants, such as B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), P.1 (Brazil) and presumably
other future variants (Faria et al., 2021; Rambaut et al., 2020; Tegally et al., 2020).

Furthermore, the identification of cross-reacting symbiotic bacteria in this study would
provide novel prognosis prediction and therapeutic options. To extend a peptide pool for
the vaccine development, identification of additional public clonotypes and their
epitopes is necessary and now under investigation.

Methods
Human subjects
The Institutional Review Boards of Osaka University (approval number 898-4) and
National Institute of Infectious Diseases (approval number 1137) approved blood draw
protocols for convalescent COVID-19 and healthy individuals. The Institutional Review
Board of nonprofit organization MINS (approval number 190210) approved the
analyses of blood samples from healthy individuals in KOTAI Biotechnologies. The
research was performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or designated healthcare
surrogates if participants were unable to provide informed consent. Study enrollment
criteria included subjects over 20 years old, regardless of disease severity and genders
(Table S1). Prior to enrollment in this study, all COVID-19 donors were confirmed to
be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Blood
from convalescent COVID-19 donors and healthy donors was obtained at Tokyo
Shinagawa Hospital and Osaka University. Samples were de-identified prior to analyses.
For PBMC preparation, whole blood was collected in heparin-coated tube and
centrifuged to separate the cellular fraction and plasma, followed by density-gradient
sedimentation. For neutralizing antibody assay, plasma samples from patients were
heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56°C. Plasma diluted at 1:5 followed by two-fold serial
dilutions was incubated with equal volume of solution containing 100 TCID50 of
SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C and added to VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. After
incubation for 5 days, the highest plasma dilution that protected 100% of cells from

cytopathic effect was taken as the neutralization titer. Disease severity was defined as
mild, moderate I, moderate II or severe in accordance with the Japanese COVID-19
clinical practice guideline ver. 2.2 (https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000650160.pdf).

SARS-CoV-2
For the preparation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 (KNG19-020) was
kindly supplied by Dr. Tomohiko Takasaki (Kanagawa Prefectural Institute of Public
Health). The virus was propagated in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (JCRB1819) and purified
by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Dent and Neuman, 2015). Concentrated virus was
then inactivated by ultraviolet light (0.6 J/cm2).

Antigens
Inactivated virus was used at 2.9 × 106 viral particles/ml (approximately 1 µg S
protein/ml) for stimulation. For the preparation of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein,
the ectodomain of S protein was cloned into a mammalian expression vector pCMV,
with a foldon sequence followed by 9 × His-tag and Strep-tag at the C-terminus.
Polybasic cleavage site (RRAR) of S protein was replaced by a single alanine, and
K986P and V987P mutations were introduced to stabilize the conformation as
previously described (Amanat et al., 2020). After transient transfection into Expi293F
cells (Gibco), secreted protein was purified from the culture supernatant 4 days post
transfection using TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) and Amicon Ultra 10K filter
device (Millipore). For the expression of S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43,

and resuspended with PBS and incubated at 95°C for 5 min for inactivation. The
expressions of the proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining. PepMix
SARS-CoV-2 (Spike Glycoprotein)(contains pool #1 and #2) was purchased from JPT
Peptide Technologies. PepTivator SARS-CoV-2 for S, M and N protein were purchased
from Miltenyi Biotec. Domains of SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed in Figure S2A was
previously described (Wrapp et al., 2020). All of other peptides were from GenScript.
3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB code: 6XR8) was depicted with program
PyMOL ver. 2.0 (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger,
LLC.).

In vitro stimulation of PBMCs
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and washed with RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma)
supplemented with 5% human AB serum (GeminiBio), Penicillin (Sigma), streptomycin
(MP Biomedicals) and 2-mercaptoethanol (Nacalai Tesque). 5 × 105 PBMCs were
stimulated in the same medium with inactivated SARS-CoV-2, 1 or 10 µg/ml of

recombinant S protein, 1 µg/ml of S peptide pool or 1 µg/ml of M + N (MN) peptide
pool for 20 hours, followed by staining with anti-human CD3, CD69, CD137, CD154
and TotalSeq-C Hashtags antibodies. CD69+, CD137+ or CD154+ cells within
CD3+-gated population were sorted by cell sorter SH800S (SONY) and used for single
cell TCR and RNA sequencing analyses. For epitope-specific clonal expansion, 1-5 ×
105 PBMCs were stimulated with 1 µg/ml of S864-882 for 10 days and recombinant
human IL-2 (1 ng/ml, Peprotech) was added at day 4 and day 7. CD4+ T cells were
sorted and analyzed by single cell TCR and RNA sequencing.

Single cell-based transcriptome and TCR repertoire analysis
Single cell capturing and library preparation were performed using following
reagents; Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v1.1, 16rxns,
PN-1000165; Chromium Next GEM Chip G Single Cell Kit, 48rxns, PN-1000120;
Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell, 96 rxns, PN-1000005;
Single Index Kit T Set A, 96 rxns, PN-1000213; Chromium Single Cell 5′ Feature
Barcode Library Kit, 16 rxns, PN-1000080; Single Index Kit N Set A, 96 rxns,
PN-1000212. Single cell suspension containing approximately 2 × 104 cells were loaded
into Chromium microfluidic chips to generate single-cell gel bead-in-emulsion using
Chromium controller (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA from the barcoded cells for each sample was subsequently reverse-transcribed
inside gel bead-in-emulsion using Veriti Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
and all subsequent steps to generate single-cell libraries were performed according to

the manufacturer’s protocol, with 14 cycles used for cDNA amplification. Then ∼50 ng
of cDNA was used for gene expression library amplification by 14 cycles in parallel
with cDNA enrichment and library construction for TCR libraries. Fragment size of the
libraries was confirmed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Libraries were
sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 as paired-end mode (read1: 28bp; read2: 91bp).
The raw reads were processed by Cell Ranger 3.1.0 (10x Genomics). Gene

10%, cells with less than 200 or more than 4,000 genes detected were considered
outliers (dying cells, empty droplets and doublets, respectively) and filtered out. The

hashtag UMI counts, and clonotypes were matched to the gene expression data through
their droplet barcodes, using Python scripts. Only cells assigned a single hashtag and a
beta-chain clonotype were retained for downstream analyses.

Bulk TCR sequencing and analysis
1-3 × 105 PBMCs were lysed in QIAzol (Qiagen). Full-length cDNA was then
synthesized using the SMARTer technology (Takara Bio), and the variable region of
TCRα and β genes were amplified using TRAC/TRBC-specific primers. After
sequencing of the variable region amplicons, each pair of reads was assigned a

complementarity-determining region 3) using the MiXCR software (Bolotin et al.,
2015). For each α/β clonotype, expansion was defined as the fraction of reads for that
clone divided by the total number of reads for the α/β chain, respectively, and fractions
were converted to log10 for plotting and statistical analyses.

HLA class II typing
For HLA class II typing, genomic DNA samples were isolated from PBMCs using QIA
DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). AllType FASTplex NGS 11 Loci Flex Kit (ONE LAMBDA)
was used to prepare DNA sequence libraries (DPA1, DPB1, DQA1, DQB1, DRB1 and
DRB3/4/5) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was performed on
Illumina MiSeq (Illumina). TypeStream Visual ver. 2.0 (ONE LAMBDA) was used to
analyze the DNA sequences. For DRB1*15:01/02 typing, genomic DNA was amplified
with a DRB1*15/16-specific forward primer (5’-CGT TTC CTG TGG CAG CCT AAG
AGG-3’) and a DRB1*15-specific reverse primer (5’-CCG CGC CTG CTC CAG
GAT-3’) followed by DNA sequencing.

Antigen-presenting cells
Recombinant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was produced as previously reported (Kanda et
al., 2015). Viral stocks were obtained by concentrating virus-containing culture
supernatants by ultracentrifugation at 32,000 rpm for 1 hour. 3 × 105 PBMCs were
incubated with an aliquot of the viral stock for 1 hour at 37°C. The infected cells were

cultured with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
CAPRICORN SCIENTIFIC GmbH) containing 0.1 µg/ml cyclosporine A (CsA,
Cayman Chemical). EBV-immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines were obtained after
3 weeks culture and used as APCs. To generate APCs expressing specific HLA,
HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HLA class II alleles as
previously described (Jiang et al., 2013). EBV experiments were approved by the
Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (approval number 539)
and the Institutional Review Boards of Osaka University (approval number 04658). To
generate monocyte-derived dendritic cells, CD14+ cells were isolated from PBMCs
using CD14 MicroBeads, human (Miltenyi Biotec), and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 mM Non-Essential Amino Acid Solution (Gibco),
1mM Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco), 10 ng/ml of human GM-CSF (Peprotech) and IL-4
(Peprotech) for 6 days.

TCR reconstitution and stimulation
TCRα and β chain cDNA sequences were synthesized and cloned into retroviral vectors
pMX-IRES-rat CD2 and pMX-IRES-human CD8, respectively. Two vectors containing
paired TCRα and β chains were transfected together into Phoenix packaging cells using
PEI MAX (Polysciences). Supernatant containing retroviruses was used for infection
into mouse T cell hybridoma with an NFAT-GFP reporter gene (Matsumoto et al., 2021)
to reconstitute TCRαβ pairs. TCRβ mutants were constructed by site-directed
mutagenesis. For antigen stimulation, TCR-reconstituted cells were co-cultured with

otherwise. After 20 hours, T cell activation was assessed by GFP or CD69 expression.

Rapid epitope-determination platform
For the preparation of pooled peptide matrix, 15-mer peptides with 11 amino acids
overlap that cover the full length of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 were individually
synthesized (GenScript). Peptides were dissolved in DMSO at 12 mg each peptide/ml
and 8-12 peptides were mixed to create 75 different semi-pools so that the responsible
epitopes can be determined from the reactivities of horizontal and vertical pools. Pooled
peptides were diluted 10 times with water, followed by adding 1 µl of the solution into
each corresponding well. S peptide pools and S864-882 peptide were also loaded as
controls. S peptide pools of common cold HCoVs were loaded to assess
cross-reactivities. For reporter cell assay, 100 µl of media containing T cells and APCs
were added to the wells so that T cells are stimulated with each peptide at 1 µg/ml.
After 20 hours, GFP reporter induction was assessed in T cell-gated population using
AttuneNxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Restricting HLA determination
For the clonotypes detected in more than one donor from our sample pool, reporter cells
were stimulated in the presence of HEK293T cells expressing individual pair of alleles
that shared by the donors. Otherwise, reporter cells were stimulated in the presence of
transformed B cells from various donors that have partial overlapped HLAs with the

original donor of the clonotype.

Tetramer staining
Freshly-isolated or in vitro-expanded PBMCs from DRB1*15:01 donors were stained
with S867-881 peptide-loaded DRA-DRB1*15:01 tetramer. For expansion, PBMCs from
DRB1*15:01-possessing donors were stimulated with 1 µg/ml of peptide S864-882 for 9
days. Cells were treated with 100 nM protease kinase inhibitor (dasatinib, Axon
Medchem) at 37°C for 30 min and stained with tetramer conjugated with PE (Medical
& Biological Laboratories) at 4°C for 1 hour. Cells were then stained with
biotin-conjugated anti-PE antibody together with antibodies for surface markers for
flow cytometric analysis using AttuneNxT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and FlowJo
10.5.2 (BD Biosciences).

Database analyses
Public repertoire datasets of pre-pandemic healthy donors (n = 786, Adaptive
ImmuneACCESS)(Emerson et al., 2017) or unhospitalized COVID-19 convalescent
donors who had mild symptoms (n = 1,413, Adaptive ImmuneRACE)(Nolan et al.,
2020) of various ethnicities from US, Italy, and Spain were downloaded from the
Adaptive Biotechnologies website and V gene names were renamed to match the IMGT
nomenclature. Finally, clonotypes and their expansion were defined in the same way as
in-house bulk TCR sequencing. TCR occurrence in a dataset was defined as the fraction
of patients whose repertoire contained the given TCR, regardless of its expansion.

Expression and purification of soluble TCRαβ heterodimer
Expression constructs encoding the extracellular domains of TCRα-017 (Q1-D207 in
mature protein) and TCRβ-017 (G1-G241) subunits were incorporated into pCold
vector including 6 × His-tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. For
crystallization, the point mutations (T159C in α and S166C/C184A in β) were
introduced to form artificial disulfide bond as described previously (Boulter et al., 2003).
The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 competent cells Champion21 and
Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen), respectively. The protein expression was induced by the
addition of 0.5 mM IPTG at 18°C. Cells were suspended with 500 mM NaCl-containing
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and disrupted with sonication. The inclusion bodies including
target proteins were collected by centrifugation. The inclusion body was then
solubilized by 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 6 M guanidine HCl, 10 mM
EDTA and 2 mM DTT at room temperature. The equal amount of solubilized TCRα
and TCRβ (35 mg each) was mixed and rapidly diluted with 1 L of 100 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 M urea, 0.4 M L-arginine, 5 mM reduced glutathione and
0.5 mM oxidized glutathione at 4°C. The diluted solution was further dialyzed against
10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 4°C for two days. The dialyzed solution was applied
onto 5 ml Ni-NTA agarose (Fuji-film Wako) and His-tagged TCRαβ were eluted with
elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole). After
removal of His-tag by TEV protease, the eluted protein was concentrated and further
applied to Superdex75 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)

buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. The TCRαβ heterodimer fractions were concentrated
up to 1.2 mg/ml by Amicon Ultra (molecular weight cut off: 10 kDa). The purity of the
proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining. The numbering of amino acids
in CDR3 sequences of TCRs was based on mature protein.

Biolayer interferometry analysis
Octet RED96 System (fortéBio, Pall Life Science) was used to detect the binding
kinetics of TCRαβ heterodimer to peptide-loaded HLA molecule (Medical & Biological
Laboratories). All assays were carried out at 25°C on a black 96-well plate with
agitation set at 1,000 rpm and 200 µl/well for all solutions. Super Streptavidin
biosensors (fortéBio, Pall Life Science) were dipped in PBS prior to use and reacted
with 5.8 µg/ml biotinylated peptide-loaded HLA molecule. The association of TCRαβ
heterodimer at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 µM was measured for 900 sec, and the
dissociation in PBS was measured for 900 sec. The obtained data was analyzed and
processed using Octet data analysis 11.1 software.

Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination of TCR-017 ectodomain
All crystallization trials were performed by sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Initial
crystallization conditions were screened using Index (Hampton Research), SG1 Screen,
and SG2 Screen (Molecular Dimensions). The best diffracted crystal was obtained
under the condition of 0.1 M HEPES-Na (pH 7.0) and 1.1 M sodium malonate at 20°C.
Prior to X-ray diffraction experiments, crystals were soaked in the reservoir containing

20% ethylene glycol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data sets
were collected at the beamline BL-1A in the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan).
Diffraction data were integrated with program XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and scaled with
program SCALA (Evans, 2006). The phases of datasets were determined by molecular
replacement method using program MOLREP (Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010) with the
coordinate of 1E6 TCR (PDB code: 5C0B)(Cole et al., 2016). After initial phase
determination, the model buildings were manually performed using program COOT
(Emsley et al., 2010). Refinement was performed using program REFMAC5 (Vagin et
al., 2004) at the initial step and Phenix.refine for final model (Afonine et al., 2012). The
stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed by program MolProbity
(Williams et al., 2018). Data collection and refinement statistics were summarized in
Table S7. Structural factors and the atomic coordinates of TCRαβ-017 ectodomain have
been deposited in Protein Data Bank under the accession code of 7EA6. All figures of
3D structure were depicted with program PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics
System, Version 2.0 Schrödinger, LLC.).

Fig. S1. Workflow for single cell-based analyses of SARS-CoV-2-responsive T
cells.
PBMCs from healthy donors and convalescent COVID-19 patients were stimulated with
SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens as indicated for 20 hours followed by staining with eight
different hashtag antibodies (#1-8), anti-CD3 and indicated activation marker antibodies.
Hashtagged cells from two patients were pooled and analyzed with cell sorter. Antigenresponded (CD69+ or CD137+ or CD154+) CD3+ T cells were sorted and immediately
subjected to single-cell TCR and RNA sequencing. Each collection day after diagnosis was
shown after sample ID.

Table S6. S864-882-reacted public Tfh clonotypes, related to Figure 6. Clonotypes excluding those
with Treg characteristics were assembled with in-house bulk TCR-seq data as well as those in
cohort databases. Clonotypes that satisfied following two criteria are shown: 1) expanded during
stimulation based on single cell sequencing (> 0.1% of total CD4+ T cells) and 2) detected in cohort
databases.
