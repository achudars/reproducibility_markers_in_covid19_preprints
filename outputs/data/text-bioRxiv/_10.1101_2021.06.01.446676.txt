Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy leads to an increased risk of adverse

37

pregnancy outcomes. Although the placenta itself can be a target of virus infection,

38

most neonates are virus free and are born healthy or recover quickly. Here, we

39

investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the placenta from a cohort of

40

women who were infected late during pregnancy and had tested positive for SARS-

41

CoV-2 by qRT-PCR at delivery. SARS-CoV-2 genomic and subgenomic RNA was

42

detected in 23 out of 55 placentas (41%). Three placentas with high virus content were

43

obtained from mothers who presented with severe COVID-19 and whose pregnancies

44

resulted in adverse outcomes for the fetuses, including intrauterine fetal demise,

45

stillbirth, and a preterm delivered baby still in newborn intensive care. Examination of

46

the placental samples with high virus content showed efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection,

47

using RNA in situ hybridization to detect genomic and replicating viral RNA, and

48

immunohistochemistry to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Infection was

49

restricted to syncytiotrophoblast cells that envelope the fetal chorionic villi and are in

50

direct contact with maternal blood. The infected placentas displayed massive infiltration

51

of maternal immune cells including macrophages into intervillous spaces, potentially

52

contributing to inflammation of the tissue. Ex vivo infection of placental cultures with

53

SARS-CoV-2 or with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein pseudotyped lentivirus targeted

54

mostly syncytiotrophoblast and, to a lesser extent, endothelial cells. Infection was

55

reduced by using blocking antibodies against ACE2 and against Neuropilin 1,

56

suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may utilize alternative receptors for entry into placental

57

cells.

Introduction

59

The global pandemic resulting from the novel coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory

60

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already taken a devastating toll, with over

61

170 million total cases and more than 3.5 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 which

62

causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significant clinical variability. In

63

severe cases SARS-CoV-2 causes the respiratory illness, whose defining features are

64

an imbalanced inflammatory host response, reduced innate antiviral defenses and an

65

inflammatory “cytokine storm”, endothelial damage, coagulopathies and thrombosis in

66

several tissues from infected patients (Blanco-Melo et al. 2020).

67

To date, our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts pregnancy,

68

including the health of COVID-19 positive mothers and their babies, remains

69

incomplete. Pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 infections are more likely to

70

be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and have statistically higher maternal death

71

rates when compared to non-pregnant infected women (Zambrano et al. 2020). While

72

preterm deliveries occur more often in women with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-

73

2 infection, no increase in stillbirth or early neonatal death was found (Mullins et al.

74

2021). Prospective and retrospective studies showed that pregnant women infected with

75

SARS-CoV-2 are at increased risk of adverse events, including higher rates of cesarean

76

section and increased post-partum complications (Woodworth et al. 2020; Prabhu et al.

77

2020; Marín Gabriel et al. 2020). While vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from

78

mother to fetus has been reported in a few cases (Hecht et al. 2020a; Vivanti et al.

79

2020; Taglauer et al. 2020; Facchetti et al. 2020; Woodworth et al. 2020; Hecht et al.

80

2020b; Alamar et al. 2020), most studies did not detect viral transmission (Penfield et al.

82

2020; Schwartz 2020; Della Gatta et al. 2020; Kimberlin and Stagno 2020).

83

Several studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 infection of the placentas from women

84

who tested positive for the virus at, or prior to, delivery. In some cases, the placenta

85

displayed signs of inflammation. These placentas were found to have increased

86

vascular malperfusion indicative of thrombi in fetal vessels (Baergen and Heller 2020;

87

Vivanti et al. 2020; Prabhu et al. 2020; Shanes et al. 2020) and infiltration of maternal

88

immune cells (Hosier et al. 2020; Facchetti et al. 2020; Debelenko et al. 2021; Garrido-

89

Pontnou et al. 2021; Lu-Culligan et al. 2021; Morotti et al. 2021; Schwartz et al. 2021).

90

Whether inflammation results from virus infection of the mother or direct infection of the

91

placenta remains unresolved, as this may depend on the gestational age of the fetus.

92

Virus infection is known to impair placental function. Virus-associated inflammation

93

during pregnancy can result in chronic cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity

94

later in life (Burton, Fowden, and Thornburg 2016). Little is known however about the

95

effect of SARS-CoV-2 placental function.

96

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as the primary

97

receptor (Hoffmann et al. 2020), and Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) as a coreceptor (Cantuti-

98

Castelvetri et al. 2020; Daly et al. 2020), in concert with the two proteinases TMPRSS2

99

(Transmembrane protease serine 2) (Hoffmann et al. 2020) and CTSL (Ou et al. 2020)

100

and the pro-protein convertase furin (Shang et al. 2020), amongst others (Wei et al.

101

2021; Daniloski et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021; Schneider et al. 2021) for cell entry. All of

102

the viral entry receptors are expressed at significant levels in first and second trimester

103

placentas. However, at term they are expressed at lower levels at the maternal-fetal

interface, including the placenta and the chorioamniotic membranes (Pique-Regi et al.

106

Culligan et al. 2021; Baston-Buest et al. 2011). Whether alternative entry mechanisms

107

are exploited by SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta is not known.

108

In this study we were interested to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection

109

late in pregnancy on placental function. Using a cohort of 55 women who tested positive

110

for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of delivery, we report on placental infections, placental

111

pathologies and in vivo inflammatory responses to infection. Furthermore, we present in

112

situ studies of infected placentas as well as ex vivo placental explant cultures that

113

investigate susceptibility of placental cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results

116

Clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers, fetal outcomes and

117

placental pathologies

118

A cohort of 55 women who were identified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR

119

from nasopharyngeal swabs at the time of admission for delivery at NY Presbyterian

120

Hospital-Weill Cornell was included in the present study (P1–P55). As controls, a

121

cohort of 5 women who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (C1-C5), and a cohort of 5

122

SARS-CoV-2 negative women who presented various placental inflammatory

123

pathologies (I1-I5) were also included in the study (Table 1).

124

The pregnant women ranged in age from 16 to 51 years, with a majority in their 20’s

125

and 30’s. Among the 55 women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 10 were

126

symptomatic for COVID-19 (18%), and several presented additional comorbidities

127

including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. None of the women required intensive

128

care. Four pregnancies resulted in intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) or stillbirth (P2, P3,

129

P7, P38), and one of the four (P38) presented with anencephaly. One fetus, delivered

130

preterm at 25 weeks of gestation, was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit

131

(NICU), where the infant has remained for 4 months (P1). All other neonates, including

132

3 sets of twins, had normal Apgar scores at 1 min and at 5 min after birth and were

133

healthy at initial follow up (Table 1). All neonates were tested by nasopharyngeal swabs

134

for SARS-CoV-2 at 24 hours, and none were positive. Among the placentas delivered

135

from mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 30% (17 cases) presented fetal

136

vascular malperfusion (FVM), 18% (10 cases) displayed maternal vascular malperfusion

137

(MVM), and 7% (4 cases) overlapped for both placental pathologies. None of the

138

healthy control placentas from SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers displayed FVM or MVM

139

(Table 1).

140

RNA was isolated from all placental samples and subjected qRT-PCR to determine

141

the presence of genomic and replicating SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 23 out of 55 placentas from

142

SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers showed presence of viral RNA (42%), 3 of those were

143

highly positive (5%), 10 positive (18%) and 10 were borderline positive (18%) (Table 1

144

and Figure 1A). Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta did not correlate with

145

observed FVM: Of the 23 positive placentas, 10 displayed FVM while 13 were without

146

FVM (Table 1).

147

Strikingly, all four pregnancies from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers that resulted in

148

IUFD, stillbirth or admission of the neonate to the NICU, delivered placentas that were

149

highly positive (P1-P3) or positive (P7) for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1, grey shaded rows).

150

Conversely, all other pregnancies from SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers resulted in the

151

delivery of healthy neonates, with the exception of one case with anencephaly (P38).

152

153

Placental syncytiotrophoblast are the primary target for SARS-CoV-2 infection of

154

pregnant females at term

155

To determine whether the placenta itself was infected by SARS-CoV-2, qRT-PCR

156

using primers against SARS-CoV-2-N was run on RNA isolated from FFPE patient

157

placenta slides. This provided us with 5 distinct cohorts for this study depicted in Table

158

1: High Positive (P1-P3; ddCT value > 9), Positive (P4-P13; ddCT > 4.5), and Borderline

159

Positive (P14-P23). We also ran qRT-PCR on RNA from patient placenta samples from

160

SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers (C1-C5) as well as SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers that

161

had unrelated inflammatory pathologies (I1-I5) (Figure 1A and Table 1). To confirm

162

presence of viral RNA, the presence of a distinct amplicon on PCR melt curve and on

163

gels run on RNA samples distinguished between the positive and negative samples

164

from all of the placenta samples obtained from COVID-positive mothers (data not

165

shown).

166

To identify the cells in the placental chorionic villi that were infected by SARS-CoV-2,

167

adjacent placental sample sections (10 microns apart) from the different cohorts were

168

stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), or for the presence of replicating viral RNA, for

169

the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (SARS-CoV-2-N), and for the

170

presence CD163+ Hofbauer cells (HBC) and macrophages using

171

immunohistochemistry. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by in situ hybridization in the

172

high positive samples, but not in negative control samples (Figure 1B). Presence of

173

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was restricted to the Keratin-7 (KRT7)-positive syncytial trophoblast

174

layer which anatomically encapsulate the chorionic villi structures (Figure 1B). Similarly,

175

expression of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was detected in adjacent sections within the

176

same villi. Localization of the N protein was restricted to the syncytiotrophoblast layers

177

in the high positive placentas. Interestingly, the syncytial trophoblast layer of the high

178

positive sample had significantly fewer nuclei and appeared damaged as indicated by

179

the hematoxylin counterstaining. Importantly, at low magnification, massive infiltration of

180

maternal immune cells, including CD163+ macrophages detected in the high positive

181

samples, but not in the controls (Figure 1B and not shown). This result is consistent with

182

the pathology report for the sample P3 of chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI) (Table

183

1). Intravilllous HBC and intervillous maternal macrophages did not show infection with

184

SARS-CoV-2, evidenced by the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and N protein. In

185

summary, these results indicate that syncytiotrophoblast are the primary targets for

186

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the placenta, and that the massive maternal immune cell

187

migration occurred in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection either in the mother or in

188

the placenta.

189

190

Placental explant and cell cluster cultures are permissive to pseudo-entry virus

191

and infection can be blocked by anti-ACE2 and anti-NRP1 antibodies

192

To determine the SARS-CoV-2 tropism and infection of term placentas, we used

193

fresh placental isolates from SARS-CoV-2 negative mothers obtained immediately post-

194

delivery. After removal of the fetal chorionic plate and maternal decidua, samples

195

containing terminal, intermediate and stem chorionic villi were used for the preparation

196

of placental villi explant cultures (Figure 2C). In addition, placental cell clusters were

197

prepared by enzymatic digestion of the chorionic villi, followed by filtration that allows

198

passage of small cell clusters. Placental cultures were infected with a dual

199

nanoluciferase/green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter lentiviral vector pseudotyped

200

with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) (Tada et al. 2020), and luciferase activity was quantified 72

201

hpi. Lentiviral reporter viruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein

202

(VSV-G) were used as a positive control for infection (Figure 2). A comparison of the

203

infectivity showed that both pseudotyped viruses infected the placental cultures at

204

similar levels. Explant cultures consistently showed an approximately 5-fold lower

205

infection as compared to clusters or single cells, likely due to the reduced surface

206

accessibility. Infectivity was significantly reduced by adding the human

207

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor nevirapine (NVP),

208

indicating that the luciferase activity was primarily due to viral entry and not carry-over

209

from residual viral particles in the cultures (Figure 2A). The major SARS-CoV-2 entry

210

factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the placenta, albeit their expression is

211

significantly decreased in the third trimester (Pique-Regi et al. 2020; Singh, Bansal, and

212

Feschotte 2020; Ouyang et al. 2021). Furthermore, NRP1 has been identified as a

213

novel host factor for SARS-CoV-2 (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al. 2020; Daly et al. 2020) and

214

is expressed on syncytiotrophoblast (Arad et al. 2017; Baston-Buest et al. 2011). To

215

determine if ACE2 and/or NRP1 facilitate infection in the placenta, we pre-treated

216

placental cell clusters with anti-ACE2 or anti-NRP1 blocking antibody prior to infection.

217

Both antibodies reduced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudotyped lentivirus in

218

placental cell clusters by about 50%, while anti-ACE2 blocking antibody did not reduce

219

infectivity of VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus. Pre-treatment with both antibodies did not

220

result in further reduction of infectivity, suggesting the possibility of alternative

221

receptor(s) (Figure 2B).

222

To determine which cells are targeted by the pseudotyped virus, placental explant

223

cultures were infected for 72 hours with lentivirus pseudotyped by SARS-CoV-2 spike

224

(S) protein, and live GFP could be visualized in the infected explant cultures, with a

225

more robust signal observed in the pseudotyped VSV-G infected cultures (Figure 2C).

226

Explant cultures were then processed for immunofluorescence staining and analyzed

227

for co-localization of the GFP reporter with KRT-7/Cytokeratin (trophoblast marker) and

228

CD31 (endothelial marker). GFP was detected in small patches of syncytiotrophoblast

229

cells located on the outer perimeter of the chorionic villi, but not in endothelial cells

230

(Figure 2D). Similar results were obtained after infection with VSV-G pseudotyped

231

lentivirus, with more robust infection visualized by live fluorescence microscopy on the

232

infected explant cultures, whereas no GFP signal was found in mock-infected explant

233

cultures (Figure 2D).

236

Primary placental cell clusters are permissive to SARS-CoV-2
To further determine the intrinsic susceptibility of placental cells to SARS-CoV-2,

237

primary placental cell clusters were infected ex vivo. Placentas were isolated from

238

healthy term deliveries as described above, digested into cell clusters of approximately

239

50-100 cells and plated on Matrigel-coated plates. Cell clusters were infected with live

240

SARS-CoV-2 virus (Isolate USA-WA1/2020, multiplicity of infection, MOI=1). Cells were

241

collected 24 hpi and virus load analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence

242

staining.

243

qRT-PCR analysis using primers targeting subgenomic N transcripts demonstrated

244

robust SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in primary human placental cell clusters at 24 hpi

245

(Figure 3A). To determine which cells of primary placental cell clusters were susceptible

246

to SARS-CoV-2 infection, infected cell clusters were immunostained for SARS-CoV-2

247

nucleocapsid protein (SARS-N) and cell type specific markers for trophoblast cells

248

(KRT7) and endothelial cells (CD31). Three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal

249

imaging confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2-N protein in KRT7+

250

syncytiotrophoblast (Figure 3B). Co-localization of SARS-CoV-2-N protein was found in

251

multiple clusters of KRT7+ syncytiotrophoblast cells (Figure 3C). In addition to the

Discussion
The placenta is a vital organ that provides the gestational interface between mother

257

and fetus. Compromised maternal health and environmental insults, such as viral

258

infections, can result in placental dysfunction and lead to pregnancy complications with

259

increased morbidity and mortality for the mother and fetus (Rossant and Cross 2001;

260

Maltepe, Bakardjiev, and Fisher 2010; John and Hemberger 2012). Impairment of

261

placental function can also developmentally program the fetus for chronic disease later

262

in life, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity (Burton, Fowden, and

263

Thornburg 2016).

264

The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of late pregnancy SARS-CoV-2

265

infection on maternal and fetal health and proper placental function. Within a cohort of

266

56 placental samples from women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery, 23

267

were positive for genomic and replicating viral RNA. The observed percentage of

268

positive samples was higher compared to other studies (Hecht et al. 2020b; Facchetti et

269

al. 2020; Debelenko et al. 2021; Lu-Culligan et al. 2021) and likely reflects the fact that

270

New York City was at the epicenter for COVID-16 in May-May of 2020. Furthermore,

271

many of the placental samples were obtained from deliveries where the mothers or

272

infants presented with clinical pathologies. Importantly, quantification of virus content in

273

the placental samples allowed us for the first time to uncover a striking correlation in 3

274

out of 3 cases between symptomatic COVID-19 of the mother at the time of delivery,

275

high SARS-CoV-2 presence in the placenta, and adverse fetal outcome, including fetal

276

demise and preterm delivery. In contrast, only 1 out of 10 pregnancies with medium viral

277

content resulted in intrauterine fetal demise, and this may have been triggered by poorly

278

controlled maternal T2D. Of the pregnancies with medium or low virus content in the

279

placenta, all 18 babies tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and were healthy at discharge.

280

It will be important to follow up on the health of these infants to investigate possible

281

long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2. None of the pregnancies of SARS-CoV-2 negative

282

healthy controls (n=5) or inflammation controls (n=5) resulted in fetal demise.

283

Upon examining sections from placentas with high virus content, we detected SARS-

284

CoV-2 RNA and protein in a large fraction of syncytiotrophoblast, the single cell layer

285

enveloping the fetal chorionic villi situated at the interphase to maternal blood. No virus

286

was detected in fetal macrophages (Hofbauer cells), other cell types inside the villi,

287

including stromal and endothelial cells, or outside the villi. Several recent reports also

288

provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection restricted to syncytiotrophoblast of

289

placentas from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers (Alamar et al. 2020; Mulvey et al. 2020;

290

Hecht et al. 2020b; Penfield et al. 2020; Hosier et al. 2020; Vivanti et al. 2020; Taglauer

291

et al. 2020; Facchetti et al. 2020). However, two reports on a preterm placenta and a

292

placenta from a newborn with vertically SARS-CoV-2 noted also presence of SARS-

293

CoV-2 in other cell types, including Hofbauer cells and stromal cells inside the villi, and

294

maternal macrophages and epithelial cells at the maternal-fetal interface (Verma et al.,

295

2021, Fachetti et al, 2020). It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection in these cases

296

occurred at earlier gestational stages and allowed for additional viral spread beyond the

297

syncytiotrophoblast layer.

298

Placentas in our study with high virus presence also displayed massive infiltration of

299

maternal immune cells, including macrophages into the intervillous space. However, we

300

did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the infiltrating immune cells. Several recent studies

301

reported similar findings; interestingly they were most prominently found in placentas

302

from live-borne and stillborn neonates that had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These

303

finding included intervillous infiltration by inflammatory immune cells, chronic histiocytic

304

intervillositis with trophoblast necrosis, and increased fibrin deposition (Debelenko et al.

305

2021; Facchetti et al. 2020; Garrido-Pontnou et al. 2021; Lu-Culligan et al. 2021;

306

Schwartz et al. 2021; Morotti et al. 2021; Verma et al. 2021). Furthermore,

307

transcriptome data presented in one of these studies showed localized inflammatory

308

responses to systemic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the placenta, even if SARS-CoV-2 virus

309

was not detected (Lu-Culligan et al. 2021).

310

Considering the low efficiency of placental infection by SARS-CoV-2, we decided to

311

complement our in vivo studies by using ex vivo placental explant and cell cluster

312

culture models to study virus entry. We showed infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus or

313

SARS-CoV-2 spike S pseudotyped lentivirus targeted predominantly

314

syncytiotrophoblast and, in rare instances, endothelial cells. Term placentas express

315

very low levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the co-factor TMPRSS2 (Pique-

316

Regi et al. 2020; Singh, Bansal, and Feschotte 2020; Ouyang et al. 2021). Recently, Lu-

317

Culligan et al. (Lu-Culligan et al. 2021) reported on increased levels of placental ACE2

318

expression in COVID-19 positive mothers; whereas a second publication reported on a

319

decrease of ACE2 expression and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system

320

(Verma et al. 2021). We asked here if alternative entry factors might be used by SARS-

321

CoV-2 to infect placental cells. One likely candidate is the transmembrane protein

322

NRP1, which has recently been identified as a host factor that facilitates SARS-CoV-2

323

cell entry and infectivity (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al. 2020; Daly et al. 2020). NRP1 was

324

originally identified as a co-receptor for Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on

325

endothelial cells but is expressed also at the maternal-fetal interface in decidual cells

326

and syncytiotrophoblast, and is thought to play important roles during pregnancy and in

327

the immune system (Arad et al. 2017; Baston-Buest et al. 2011). We show that infection

328

by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped lentivirus can be partially inhibited by using blocking

329

anti-ACE2 or anti-NRP1 antibodies, whereas infection by VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus

330

is not blocked, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may use NRP1 as an alternative entry

331

factor, and suggesting the existence of additional entry factors in the placenta.

332

The present study focused on late cohort infections from mothers who tested

333

positive at the time of delivery. It will be important to study the impact of early cohort

334

infections in mothers who are serologically positive at delivery but negative for viral

335

RNA, as infection during the first and second trimester may affect placental

336

development and morphogenesis and result in different placental pathologies and

337

clinical outcomes for mother and fetus.

swabs and RT-PCR. Placental samples were fixed for 48 hours in formalin and then

371

processed and embedded into formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks by the

372

pathology department. FFPE placenta samples from 5 healthy women who tested

373

negative for SARS-CoV-2 served as controls. An additional 5 FFPE placental samples

374

with inflammation pathologies, obtained from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, were also

488

2020). The viruses were concentrated 10-fold by ultracentrifugation and titers were

489

quantified by reverse transcriptase assay. Placental explant cultures and cell clusters

490

were infected with 10 μl SARS-CoV-2 S or VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus (Tada et al.

491

2020). To determine whether NRP1 or ACE2 facilitates the infection of placental cells,

492

placental cell clusters were pretreated for 30 min with anti-NRP1 mAb (R&D Systems,

493

AF3870) or anti-ACE2 mAb (Agilent, AG-20A-0032-C50). Infected placental clusters

494

were lysed 72 hours post-infection. Luciferase activity was measured using a Promega

495

Nano-Glo Assay Kit and read on an Envision microplate luminometer (Perkin Elmer).

496

Infection of Placental Clusters with Live SARS-CoV-2. Placental cell clusters

497

were infected with live SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) at an MOI of

498

0.1 and 1 or mock-infected at day-1 in culture as recently described (Yang et al. 2020).

499

At the indicated hpi, cells were washed three times with PBS. For RNA analysis cells

500

were lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence staining cells were fixed in

501

4% formaldehyde for 60 min at room temperature. All work involving live SARS-CoV-2

502

was performed in the CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility of the Icahn School of

503

IHC for SARS-CoV2 and Hofbauer Cells on FFPE Slides. Immunohistochemistry

518

(IHC) was performed on FFPE slides using ImmPRESS Reagent kit (Vector

519

laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). FFPE slides were dewaxed in a hybrid oven for 45

520

minutes at 55oC and then rehydrated using xylenes followed by a standard ethanol

521

gradient. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.1 in a

522
