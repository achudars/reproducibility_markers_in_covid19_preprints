The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 expression of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs by
single cell transcriptome study
Mengmeng Li*, Liang Chen*, Chenglong Xiong#, Xiangjie Li#

Recent studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 genes (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052), but our current work only focus on ACE2,
which is insufficient to support the conclusion of this paper. So the authors have withdrawn their
manuscript whilst they perform additional experiments and analysis to test some of their
conclusions further. Therefore, the authors do not wish this work to be cited as reference for the
project.
