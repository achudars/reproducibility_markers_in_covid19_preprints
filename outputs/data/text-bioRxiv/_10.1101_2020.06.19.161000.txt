Abstract
Rapid but yet sensitive, specific and high-throughput detection of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in clinical samples is key to diagnose infected people
and to better control the spread of the virus. Alternative methodologies to PCR and
immunodiagnostic that would not require specific reagents are worth to investigate not only
for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats.
Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker
peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota
present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic
data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. Simili nasopharyngeal
swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to
develop a nanoLC-MS/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the
nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be
obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions. These results pave the way for the
development of time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on mass spectrometry.

Introduction
The new severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
causative agent of COVID-19, the coronavirus disease that was first reported in December
2019 in the city of Wuhan, China (1). Due to its easy inter-human transmission, SARS-CoV-2
has since quickly spread worldwide, causing more than 8 million COVID-19 diagnosed
infections and more than 450 thousand deaths officially reported as off mid June 2020
(https://covid19.who.int/). The rapid, sensitive and specific detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
in large cohorts of clinical samples is of utmost importance to identify infected people and
control the propagation of the virus by specific containment measures. At the same time,
being able to catch the numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants represents an opportunity to identify
attenuated forms of the virus (2). However, the occurrence of specific mutations, especially
deletions, may challenge current molecular detection methodologies.
The research community has been placing great efforts in the development of quick and
accurate detection tests (3, 4). The gold standard in diagnostics relies on the amplification and
measurement of the viral RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RT-PCR is highly specific and achieves a good compromise between speed (90-300 min) and
sensitivity. However, due to the great demand for PCR-based testing, shortage of RNA
extraction kits and PCR reagents may have limited the testing capacity in some countries at
the early stage of the pandemic (5). Besides, RT-PCR testing of clinical samples may be in some
case less efficient due to nucleic acid variations in the targeted regions - primers or their close
vicinity - that could affect the amplification rate (6, 7). For these reasons, alternative detection
strategies that address these concerns should be developed to complement conventional
tools.
Immunoassays, whole-genome sequencing (8) and mass spectrometry (MS) (9) technologies
are commonly suggested alternatives to PCR-based assays. Among these, new generation MS
offers a highly sensitive technology that allows the rapid identification of thousands of
proteins present in a single sample. The typing of organisms by tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS), commonly referred to as “proteotyping”, is based on the identification of specific
peptide sequences that allow the unambiguous identification of organisms (9-11). The
uniqueness of the mass to charge ratios and fragmentation patterns measured in MS/MS
allows identifying peptides that differentiate organisms at the subspecies level. Although
classical MS-based identification of pathogens in the clinical setting is based on whole-cell
MALDI-TOF technology (12), the field has thrived with the increases in speed, sensitivity, and
accuracy of new MS instrumentation in the last decade. The coupling of new generation
instruments with the separation power of liquid chromatography makes LC-MS/MS a valuable
technology to implement in the routine of clinical laboratories. Despite their high potential,
the application of LC-MS/MS approaches for virus proteotyping is still scarce. Among the few
examples available in the literature, LC-MS/MS was shown to be able to detect purified
influenza virus (13) and human metapneumovirus in clinical samples (14).
Because of the considerable damages of the COVID19 pandemic, the mass spectrometry
community quickly proposed to mobilize its efforts at helping to understand the molecular
mechanisms of infection (15-17) and at improving detection methods (18). Several research
groups started investigating MS-based quantification of peptides for the detection of SARSCoV-2 in clinical samples, but these results are not yet published (19-22). These preliminary
results indicate that targeted MS, in which the mass spectrometer is programmed to precisely

detect and quantify a limited number of peptides of interest, can be successfully applied to
virus detection. Targeted MS is considered as the gold standard for peptide quantification due
to its higher sensitivity when compared to shotgun proteomics approaches. Nevertheless, this
approach has a much lower throughput and is commonly used to test hypotheses on a subset
of proteins of interest, in contrast to discovery shotgun proteomics. By being more flexible,
the latter provides a more comprehensive picture of the viral peptidome, including the
detection of variant sequences because of the possibility of detecting peptides without any
previous knowledge of their sequences.
Here we established the proof of concept of the use of MS/MS for the rapid proteotyping of
SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples. We recently published a dataset from a shotgun LC-MS/MS
experiment performed with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and proposed a list of specific viral
peptides that could be used for the development of targeted approaches (23). Interestingly,
we observed that some SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides eluted from the LC column at narrow
windows of retention time. Here, we used LC-MS/MS with an Orbitrap instrument (Q Exactive
HF) for analyzing the peptidome from nasal swabs spiked with different quantities of viral
material. By using a short LC gradient focusing on the region of interest identified in our
previous study, we tested the detection of the virus in samples containing different quantities
of viral peptides, as well as COVID-19 clinical samples, paving the way for the development of
time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on an alternative platform.

Materials and Methods
Nasopharyngeal swab collection and processing for reference matrices.
Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using a sterile polyester swab with semi-flexible
polystyrene handle (Puritan) from two healthy volunteers (swabs R1 and R2). Each swab was
soaked into a tube containing 200 µL of sterile water, incubated for 10 min at room
temperature, and then rinsed with 200 µL of sterile water. The biological material from the
400 µL of solution was precipitated with the addition of 100 µL of trichloroacetic acid at 50%
(w/v) and centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded. The hardly
visible pellet was dissolved into 50 µL of LDS1X containing 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, heated
for 5 min at 99°C, and centrifuged briefly. For each swab sample, a volume of 20 µL of LDS1X
sample was deposited on a SDS-PAGE gel and run for 5 min. After migration, the gel was rinsed
with water, stained with Simply Blue SafeStain (Invitrogen), and destained overnight in water.
The two polyacrylamide gel bands corresponding to the whole proteome of each matrix were
excised, processed as described (24), and then subjected to trypsin Gold proteolysis (Promega)
using 0.01% ProteaseMAX surfactant (Promega). The nasal matrix peptide fractions were 50
µL for each swab.
NanoLC-MS/MS characterization of the peptides extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab
matrices
Peptides from the nasal swab matrices were analysed with a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer
(Thermo) coupled with an UltiMate 3000 LC system (Dionex-LC) and operated in datadependent mode as previously described (25). A volume of 4 µL of peptides was injected,
desalted onto an Acclaim PepMap100 C18 pre-column (5 µm, 100 Å, 300 µm id x 5 mm), and

then resolved onto a nanoscale Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 column (3 µm, 100 Å, 75 µm id x 50
cm) with a 90-min gradient at a flow rate of 0.2 µL/min. The gradient was developed from 4
to 25% of CH3CN, 0.1% formic acid in 75 min, and then from 25 to 40% in 15 min, washed, and
re-equilibrated. Peptides were analysed with scan cycles initiated by a full scan of peptide ions
in the Orbitrap analyser, followed by high-energy collisional dissociation and MS/MS scans on
the 20 most abundant precursor ions (Top20 method). Full scan mass spectra were acquired
from m/z 350 to 1500 at a resolution of 60,000 with internal calibration activated on the m/z
445.12002 signal. Ion selection for MS/MS fragmentation and measurement was performed
applying a dynamic exclusion window of 10 sec and an intensity threshold of 5x104. Only ions
with positive charges 2+ and 3+ were considered.
Cell culture and Virus
Vero E6 (ATCC, CLR-1586) cells were cultured at 37°C in 9% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM, Gibco, ThemoFisher) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.5%
penicillin–streptomycin. The SARS-CoV-2 strains 2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1 (Genbank
MT066156) was provided by the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute of Infectious Diseases
(Rome, Italy) via the EVAg network (European Virus Archive goes global). SARS-CoV-2 stocks
used in the experiments had undergone two passages on Vero E6 cells and were stored at 80°C. Virus titer was 7.25x105 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL, as determined by standard
plaque assay (three dilutions in duplicates). All experiments entailing live SARS-CoV-2 were
performed in our biosafety level 3 facility and strictly followed its approved standard operating
procedures.
Infection and virus purification
Vero E6 cells (1x106) seeded into 150 cm2 flasks were grown to cell confluence in 15 ml DMEM
supplemented with 5% FCS and 0.5% penicillin–streptomycin for one night at 37°C under 9%
CO2. They were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. Cells were harvested at 3
days post infection (dpi) and viral suspension was recovered after centrifugation at 2,500 rpm
for 5 min to remove cell debris. 33 ml of the viral suspension were laid on 5 ml of 20% (w/v)
sucrose cushion prepared in NaCl 0.1 M, EDTA 1m M, 10 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4) (TNE
buffer) in Ultra-Clear 38 ml tubes (Beckman Coulter). Samples were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm
for 2h at 4°C. Pellets were solubilised in 150 L of cold TNE buffer and a volume of 1.5 ml was
laid on a five step 20 - 60% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared in Ultra-Clear 13 ml tubes
(Beckman Coulter). The tubes were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 2h at 4°C in a Beckman
SW41 rotor. After recovery of the virus band, the viral suspension was inactivated by
incubation with betapropiolactone at a final concentration of 0.5% for 72h at 4°C. Plaque assay
titration was used to quantify the purified virus and validate the viral inactivation.
Proteolysis of purified SARS-CoV-2 virus
The inactivated purified virus sample (equivalent to 7.25x105 PFU/mL) was quantified in terms
of protein concentration (0.614 mg/mL) by UV spectrophotometry. A volume of 60 µL was
mixed with 20 µL of LDS3X to obtain a protein fraction of 0.46 mg/mL. After denaturation at
99°C for 5 min, a volume of 25 µL (11.5 µg of proteins) was deposited on a NuPAGE 4-12% gel
(Invitrogen) and subjected to 5 min electrophoretic migration. The whole proteome was
excised as a single polyacrylamide gel band and subjected to trypsin proteolysis as previously

described (24). An aliquot of 50 µL of peptides was extracted. MS/MS analysis was performed
to confirm the high content of viral proteins in this sample (data not shown).
Preparation of simili SARS-CoV-2 contaminated swabs
SARS-CoV-2 viral peptides (3 µL) were diluted in 6 µL of H2O, 0.1% TFA. After mixing, 3 µL of
this tube was removed and diluted with 6 µL of H2O, 0.1% TFA. This was repeated several
times to obtain a one third dilution cascade of viral peptides. Two series of simili swabs were
prepared in parallel. The two peptide fractions obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs (35µL)
were diluted with 15 µL of H20, 0.1% TFA. A volume of 6 µL of this diluted matrix was added
to each simili swab samples, giving a final volume of 12 µL per sample. Thus, each simili swab
contained the equivalent of 8.4% of the proteins harvested by a nasal swab. Two biological
replicates were prepared using each nasal swab matrix. A volume of 10 µL per sample was
injected in the Q-Exactive HF tandem mass spectrometer. They were analysed in the same
conditions as above except that the gradient was developed from 8 to 12.5% of CH3CN, 0.1%
formic acid for 30 min at a flow rate of 0.2 µL/min. The 20 min MS/MS acquisition started 17
min after injection.
COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs and MS/MS measurements
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from COVID-19 diagnosed adult patients as routine
medical controls and tested by RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal
sample (swabs T1-T9). This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the
University Hospital of Nîmes, France (2020-05-01). Patients have been previously be informed
that part of these samples could be used for research purpose and agreed. Each swab was
soaked into a tube containing 5 mL of Phosphate Buffered Saline (pH 7.4) sterile solution and
transferred in the biosafety level 3 facility. The biological material was precipitated with the
addition of 1.25 mL of trichloroacetic acid at 50% (w/v). After centrifugation, the supernatant
was discarded and the pellet was dissolved into 25 µL of LDS1X containing 5% betamercaptoethanol, heated for 5 min at 99°C, and deposited on a NuPAGE 4-12% gel
(Invitrogen). The proteins were subjected to 5 min electrophoresis and treated as described
here above to obtain tryptic peptides. MS/MS acquisition was done as for the simili swabs.
The 20 min MS/MS acquisition started 17 min after injection with an inclusion list comprising
28 m/z values corresponding to 23 viral peptides.
Peptide assignation and proteomics data analysis
MS/MS spectra from the nasopharyngeal swabs were searched against the generalist NCBInr
database (108,307,546 sequences totalling 41,817,980,956 amino acids) with the MASCOT
Daemon 2.3.2 search engine (Matrix Science). The search parameters were as follows: fulltrypsin specificity, maximum of two missed cleavages, mass tolerances of 5 ppm on the parent
ion and 0.02 Da on the MS/MS, carbamidomethylated cysteine (+57.0215) as a fixed
modification, and oxidized methionine (+15.9949) and deamidation of asparagine and
glutamine (+0.9848) as variable modifications. PSMs with an FDR<1% were selected for
peptide inference. Peptides were assigned to taxa using the Unipept 4.3 web interface (26)
with default parameters (equate I/L, filter duplicate peptides).

MS/MS spectra from the simili SARS-CoV-2 contaminated swabs and from the COVID-19
nasopharyngeal swabs were assigned with the MASCOT Daemon 2.3.2 search engine (Matrix
Science) as follows: the spectra were first queried against the cRAP_contaminants_2020-0518.fasta file and then against the Swissprot_Human_ISL_410545_2020-05-18 database
(20,139 sequences totalling 11,330,214 amino acids) in follow-up mode and with the decoy
option activated. This last database is the merge of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and the
Swissprot Human proteome. The MASCOT search was performed with the same parameters
as above. All peptide matches presenting a MASCOT peptide score with a FDR lower than 1%
were assigned to protein sequences. MS1 peak areas were evaluated with Skyline (27). Briefly,
we created spectral libraries based on the DAT files from each MASCOT search (cut-of 0.99)
and uploaded the MS1 full scan information contained in the raw files. The protein database
previously used for the MASCOT search was used as background proteome. Only the viral
proteins were added to the target panel. Peptide settings were matched to those used in the
MASCOT search. Peak peaking was manually checked for all peptides.
Mass spectrometry and proteomics data
The mass spectrometry and proteomics data acquired on simili swabs have been deposited to
the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (28) with the dataset
identifiers PXD019686 and 10.6019/PXD019686.

RESULTS
A shotgun MS-based strategy elaborated with simili COVID-19 swabs.
To assess the performance of shotgun MS-based proteomics in detecting SARS-CoV-2 peptides
in a background matrix consisting of nasopharyngeal swab protein material, we
experimentally created tryptic peptidomes from i) a purified virus solution obtained from Vero
E6 cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 reference strain, and ii) nasopharyngeal swabs obtained
from two healthy volunteers (Figure 1). We first characterized the nasal peptidomes and
searched for the presence of detectable microorganisms by metaproteomic data analysis.
Then, the virus peptidome was serially diluted into nasopharyngeal swab peptidomes to
obtain two sets of seven tubes containing from 460 ng (equivalent to 544 infectious particles)
to 0.6 ng (equivalent to 1 infectious particle) of viral protein material. The fourteen samples
were subsequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A window of 20 min of acquisition within a 30 min
LC gradient was adjusted to target the region of elution of five previously identified virusspecific peptides (23). The rationale for focussing the mass spectrometry measurements on
these peptides was their remarkable sequence conservation amongst the numerous SARSCoV-2 strains sequenced to date or/and their specificity to the novel coronavirus (23). These
peptides were the following: EITVATSR, GFYAEGSR, HTPINLVR, IAGHHLGR, and ADETQALPQR.
While known variants exist for the latter, the other four peptides are conserved along the
several SARS-CoV-2 sequenced genomes.
Metaproteomics analysis of the two nasopharyngeal swabs excludes the presence of
abundant microorganisms.

The MS/MS spectra acquired over 90 min on the two nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to
infer the main microbial components present in these samples as such presence should be
taken into account for creating an ad hoc database for MS/MS interpretation. Swabs R1 and
R2 yielded 60,932 and 61,053 MS/MS spectra, respectively, from which 13,602 and 13,802
were attributed to 6,460 and 6,421 peptide sequences from organisms present in the NCBInr
database (FDR <1%). These peptide sequences were analyzed with the Unipept tool (26) to
assess the biodiversity present in each sample through their taxon-specificity characteristics
based on the lowest common ancestor approach. Only a small proportion of the peptide
sequences mapped by Unipept belonged to microorganisms (Table S2). A rather low number
(38 and 69) of peptides from the R1 and R2 swabs, respectively, were attributed to Bacteria,
Archaea or Fungi. These corresponded to 0.6 % and 0.9% of the mapped peptide sequences,
respectively. To exclude false positive identifications, we applied a threshold of at least threetaxon specific peptides for organism validation at the species level, corresponding to 0.5% of
the total number of species-specific peptides (405 and 454 in each sample), as suggested by
(29). Thus, one low-abundant Corynebacterium was identified in sample R1, namely
Corynebacterium accolens, with 6 specific peptides. In swab R2, Corynebacterium
propinguum, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and Dolosigranulum pigrum could be
identified at the species taxonomical rank with 4, 5 and 15 specific peptide sequences,
respectively.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral peptides in the simili swabs.
Simili swabs containing specific quantities of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the equivalent of 8.4% of
the nasal matrix protein material collected during sampling were analysed by MS/MS with a
short gradient. We first confirmed on the most diluted fraction that the bacterial signal was
negligible for both fractions, thus not to consider at the MS/MS attribution search stage. For
this, the two datasets were searched against the generalist database NCBInr to check for the
presence of non-human peptides in the swab peptidomes. The Unipept analysis of the
detected peptide sequences showed that only 3 and 2 peptides, from replicate 1 and 2,
respectively, were attributed to Bacteria and no bacterial species could be confidently
identified (Table S2).
The results from the short gradient MS analysis on the simili swabs against the specific
human/virus database yielded 139,404 MS/MS spectra recorded in the fourteen samples.
From these, 34,647 were attributed to 2,919 peptide sequences with a FDR below 1% (Table
S3). This data allowed for the identification of 1,094 protein groups (Table S4). A small fraction
of 173 peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSMs), corresponding to 0.5% of the total PSMs,
allowed identifying 18 different viral peptide sequences, including the five peptides of
interest. The 18 peptides report for 3 structural proteins from the virus: 8 peptides from the
nucleocapsid protein (N), 7 peptides from the spike protein (S), and 3 peptides from the
membrane glycoprotein (M).
At least one viral peptide was identified in all samples independently of the concentration of
the viral material, from 460 ng (544 PFU) to 2 ng (2 PFU). However, no peptide from the virus
was identified in the sample containing viral peptides corresponding to 0.6 ng (1 PFU). The
heatmap in Figure 2 displays the MS1 peak areas, the number of PSMs attributed to each
peptide in each sample, and the number of viral peptides identified in each sample. The five
peptides with the highest MS1 peak areas across samples were the following: EITVATSR,

GFYAEGSR, LNQLESK, ADETQALPQR, and KADETQALPQR. Among them, EITVATSR, GFYAEGSR,
and ADETQALPQR are between the five peptides of interest. Peptide HTPINLVR was the
seventh most abundant. Inversely, peptide IAGHHLGR was amongst the peptides with the
lowest MS1 peak areas, along with peptides MSECVLGQSK, LDDKDPNFK, and EIDRLNEVAK.
As expected, the number of identified peptides decreased with the decreasing viral load in the
sample. While all 18 peptides were identified in the initial dilution containing 460 ng of viral
proteins (544 PFU), in highly-diluted samples containing 6 ng of viral proteins (7 PFU) and 2 ng
(2 PFU), the virus was proteotyped with only 3 and 1 peptides, respectively. In these samples
only peptides from protein N were detected (ADETQALPQR, KADETQALPQR, and GFYAEGSR).
Generally, the peptides from protein N were the most consistently detected across samples.
Despite being among the peptides with higher peak areas in the chromatograms, peptides of
interest HTPINLVR and EITVATSR were only detected in the simili swabs containing an
estimated 460 ng of viral proteins (544 PFU). On the other hand, the two other peptides of
interest from protein N, GFYAEGSR and ADETQALPQR, allowed virus proteotyping in the
sample containing 6 ng of viral proteins (7 PFU). Of note, the peptide identified in the
condition with 2 ng of viral proteins (2 PFU) is a miss-cleaved version of the ADETQALPQR
peptide: KADETQALPQR. Peptide ASANLAATK, that had not been previously selected among
the “best” candidates for SARS-CoV-2 proteotyping (23), was detected in the dilution with 17
ng of viral proteins (20 PFU) and was the most sensitive peptide from protein S.
Figure 3 represents the retention times of viral peptides from 2 to 19 min of MS acquisition,
and their intensities in the samples with the highest concentration of viral proteins (460 ng,
544 PFU). Peptides of interest are squared and have well visible peaks. With the LC gradient
used in this experiment and the delay for starting the acquisition, the retention times of
peptides are minus 4-6 minutes compared to those described in our previous paper. Peptides
are generally well distributed along the gradient, with some exceptions of peptide pairs that
co-elute:
KADETQALPQR/RVDFCGK,
QLQQSMSSADSTQA/CYGVSPTK,
ADETQALPQR/GFYAQGSR, or HTPINLVR/EIDRLNEVAK. Six peptides elute in the first ten
minutes of the gradient: IAGHHLGR, KKADETQALPQR, ASANLAATK, LNQLESK, KADETQALPQR,
and RVDFCGK. Of the utmost interest, three of the most conserved and well-detected
peptides, EITVATSR, ADETQALPQR, and GFYAQGSR, elute in a 3-min window between 13 and
16 min of the gradient.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 diagnosed
patients.
Nasopharyngeal swabs were sampled from nine COVID-19 diagnosed patients with different
clinical manifestations (moderate symptoms and asymptomatic) and at different postdiagnostic stages (Table 1). Due to the complexity of the samples, an inclusion list of m/z
signals corresponding to the five peptides of interest as well as other SARS-CoV-2 peptides
detectable in this gradient region (17) was added to the acquisition method to increase the
likelihood of their detection. Table S1 reports this inclusion list which contained m/z values
for 28 different precursors from 23 different viral peptide sequences. The short gradient MS
analysis on these clinical samples yielded between 655 and 1,151 MS/MS spectra recorded
per sample. Sixty-five spectra were attributed to viral peptide sequences with a FDR below 1%
(Table S5). This data allowed for the detection of six peptides reporting for two viral proteins

protein N, and EITVATSR from protein M. The heatmap in Figure 4 displays the MS1 peak
areas, the number of PSMs attributed to each peptide in each sample, the number of viral
peptides identified in each sample, and the result from the PCR testing performed on the same
sample. The virus was confidently proteotyped in clinical swabs T7 and T8, with four and five
peptides respectively. Peptide EITVATSR was identified in swab T4 with two spectral counts,
but virus detection in this sample cannot be validated since this peptide is not specific to SARSCoV-2 (23). As shown in Table 1, swabs T7 and T8 correspond to patients that were diagnosed
as SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR with relatively clear viral loads (CT values of 28 and 25,
respectively) and were sampled 11 and 4 days after their diagnostic and confinement. MS/MS
samples were negative for swabs that yielded a relatively low PCR signal (CT of 35 and 36 for
swabs T9 and T5), with undetectable PCR signal (swabs T2, T3, T4, and T6) or 14 days after
their diagnostic (swab T1). The negative MS/MS signals for swabs T9, T5, and T1 patients are
explained by the very low viral load probably present in these samples.

DISCUSSION
To foster the development of alternative detection methods for SARS-CoV-2, we performed a
proof-of-concept study to assess the potential of MS/MS for proteotyping SARS-CoV-2: i) in
simulated nasal swabs containing different quantities of viral peptides; and ii) in
nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 diagnosed patients. The two nasal peptidomes
collected from healthy donors for the first experiment were first analyzed with a gradient of
90 min to check for the presence of detectable microorganisms from the natural microbiota.
A search against a generalist database such as NCBInr detected only trace levels of very low
abundant bacteria commonly found in the nasal tract (30), thus confirming the absence of a
measurable microbiome in the swab samples. Based on this metaproteomic analysis, we used
a human-only database as representative of the nasopharyngeal matrices for the subsequent
analysis.
The simili SARS-CoV-2 contaminated swabs contained a fixed amount of swab peptidome, plus
a precise amount of viral peptidome corresponding to the expected quantities extracted from
460 ng (544 PFU), 153 ng (181 PFU), 51 ng (60 PFU), 17 ng (20 PFU), 6 ng (7 PFU), 2 ng (2 PFU),
and 0.6 ng (1 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2. It is important to note that the virus produced in Vero E6
cells and purified on sucrose gradient is only partially infectious, and thus the data are also
presented in quantities of viral proteins. The real number of viral particles could be much
higher in these samples and could be roughly estimated as the molecular weights of each viral
protein are known and if the numbers of molecules per virus particle were documented for
SARS-CoV-2. Here, we refer to the infectious dose as this is the most important parameter in
terms of health concern, but the ratio of infectious particles in the nasopharyngeal swabs of
patients may drastically differ from the purified virus fraction used here, and could even
fluctuate during the course of the pathology. The strategy proposed for the analysis of these
simili swabs consisted in a shotgun MS analysis based on a short acquisition of 20 min with a
short LC gradient. For the clinical samples, we added an inclusion list of viral peptides in the
MS method. The inclusion list allowed forcing the fragmentation of candidate viral peptide
ions contained in the background matrix, even when they were not included in the top 20
from the data dependent acquisition method.
The shotgun strategy resulted in the detection of viral peptides in six out of the seven
conditions tested for the simili swab experiment. From the five peptides of interest,

GFYAQGSR and ADETQALPQR proved to be the most detectable and most sensitive in this
background matrix, allowing proteotyping the virus up to the condition of 6 ng of viral material
(7 PFU). One of the most interesting result was the omnipresence of peptide ADETQALPQR
and its two miss-cleaved versions KADETQALPQR and KKADETQALPQR. These peptides were
consistently detected in 30 out of 36 identifications in the six most abundant conditions from
the simili swab experiment. Peptide KADETQALPQR was identified in all simili swabs from
Figure 2. These results clearly show that ADETQALPQR, despite being prone to missedcleavages, is one the most abundant and ionisable peptides and should be the main target for
proteotyping SARS-CoV-2. This result was confirmed from the analysis of the clinical swab
samples, since peptides ADETQALPQR, KADETQALPQR, and KKADETQALPQR were
undoubtedly the most abundant in samples from COVID-19 patients (Figure 4 and Table 1). In
our previous work, we showed that this peptide sequence is also specific to SARS-CoV-2, but
presented several variants among the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes (23). Therefore, when
targeting this peptide for viral detection with MS/MS we can also take into account both its
missed-cleaved versions, and its different variants.
Surprisingly, the high intensity peptide EITVATSR was only identified in simili swabs with high
concentration of viral proteic material (Figure 2). By analyzing the MS and MS/MS spectra
from these samples, we confirmed that this peptide co-eluted with another intense precursor
from the background matrix that was fragmented simultaneously. The low MASCOT ion score
attributed to these spectra hindered the confident identification of this peptide. This coelution effect is most likely due to the use of the short chromatographic gradient, and one
way to tackle it would be to use smaller isolation windows for fragmentation. This parameter
was tested for the analysis of clinical swabs, but little or no improvement was observed. No
MS/MS spectra were validated at FDR 1% for this peptide in swabs T7 and T8, even with the
presence of a MS1 peak corresponding to this peptide in swab T8. This peptide is therefore
problematic in this type of matrix and probably not suited for tracking SARS-CoV-2 in nasal
swab samples with our specific experimental setup.
The distribution of the peptides along with the chromatogram from Figure 3 shows that the
two most detectable peptides GFYAQGSR and ADETQALPQR eluted in a narrow window of
retention time between 15 – 16 min in simili swab samples. For the clinical swab samples, we
observed that the retention time for these two peptides was 15.42±1.09 min for peptide
ADETQALPQR, and 15.93±1.06 minutes for peptide GFYAQGSR as established with Skyline
(Table S7). In the light of these new results, we argue that targeting peptides ADETQALPQR
and GFYAQGSR with an extra short LC gradient of 3 min coupled to the enrichment of these
hydrophilic peptides prior the LC injection could be one way to develop quick and robust
assays for detection of the virus in clinical samples and gain in signal/noise ratio. Besides their
high intensity, these peptides provide the needed specificity for a confident assay: peptide
GFYAEGSR is highly conserved among different SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and peptide
ADETQALPQR is specific to SARS-CoV-2. The simultaneous detection of these two peptides
could provide therefore unequivocal evidence for the presence of the virus. Interestingly, a
recent not yet published study showed the high potential of the same two peptides by using
a targeted proteomics assay (19). The authors report limits of detection in the mid-attomole
range corresponding to theoretically 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles in their specific
experimental set-up.
Besides shortening the LC gradient to less than three min, sample preparation can also be
optimized to develop more rapid peptidome preparation assays and remove too hydrophilic

and too hydrophobic peptides that could saturate the chromatography column. Here, we
performed a SDS-PAGE gel and in-gel proteolysis with trypsin to denature proteins and to
remove any mass spectrometry-chromatography deleterious compounds that could be
present in the nasal swab. This procedure is known to not be optimal as only 10% of the
peptide material deposited on the gel is recovered. The literature is becoming rich in
alternative sample preparation protocols for MS-based proteomics. For example, we recently
proposed a proteotyping assay based on SP3 magnetic beads for protein purification and
digestion in roughly 30 min (31). Being easily adapted to 96-well plates and robotization, SP3based digestion is the method of choice for quick, high-throughput, and highly reproducible
proteome digestions, as recently demonstrated (20, 32). Such sample preparation may further
significantly increase the sensitivity of the tandem mass spectrometry proteotyping proposed
in the present work. Furthermore, more sensitive instrument and MS acquisition modes could
be tested to gain further sensitivity.
In conclusion, we tested in this study the potential of LC-MS/MS based methods for
proteotyping SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. With a 20 min MS-acquisition window,
we were able to identify and quantify several virus-specific peptides that allowed proteotyping
the virus in simulated swabs and clinical swabs from COVID-19 patients. We argue that
peptides ADETQALPQR (and its variant forms) and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein
are of utmost interest to develop quick and robust targeted assays for proteotyping the virus
in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Further research must be done to validate their usefulness
and their limits of detection in clinical samples, and develop the shortest possible pipeline.

Figure 4. Heatmap of peptide intensities in the clinical nasopharyngeal swabs. Cell colour
corresponds to MS1 peak area, red being the highest and white the lowest. Numbered cells
correspond to the number of PSMs from the MS/MS search that identified the peptide; cells
with zero values mean that no MS/MS spectra was attributed to the peptide in that sample
(at FDR 1%). The number of identified peptides in each sample is indicated on the bottom of
the figure. Patients were numbered from “swab T1” to “swab T9”.
