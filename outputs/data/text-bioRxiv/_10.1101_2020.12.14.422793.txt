Abstract
COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is an emerging pneumonia-like respiratory disease of
humans and is recently spreading across the globe.
Objective: To analyze the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2) isolated from Rwanda with other viral strains from African countries.
Methods: We downloaded 75 genomes sequences of clinical SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID
(global initiative on sharing all influenza data) database and we comprehensively analyzed these
SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequences alongside with Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 sequences as the
reference strains.
Results: We analyzed 75 genomes sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in different African
countries including 10 samples of SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Rwanda between July and August
2020. The phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a strong
identity with reference strains between 90-95%. We identified a missense mutation in four
proteins including orf1ab polyprotein, NSP2, 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase and orf1a
polyprotein. The most common changes in the base are C > T. We also found that all clinically
SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Rwanda had genomes belonging to clade G and lineage B.1.
Conclusions: Tracking the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 over time is important to
understand viral evolution pathogenesis. These findings may help to implement public health
measures in curbing COVID-19 in Rwanda.

Introduction
COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus-2) a divergent RNA (ribonucleic acid) virus for the present devasting the world,
with over 60 million cases and more than 1.4 million deaths until November 25, 2020 (1). The
SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and how COVID-19 disease spread rapidly in the early phase
across the globe contributed to the genetic diversity inside the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2
including clades (2, 3). Scientists isolated the virus and named SARS-CoV-2, they found a high
nucleotide sequence homology with Betacorona viruses isolated from bats such as bat-SLCoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (88%) and Malayan pangolins Pangolin-CoV (85.5% to
92.4%)(4) . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 share similarity with other emerging human
coronaviruses: SARS-CoV (79.5%) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,
MERS (50%) (5, 6).
The family of coronaviridae under the betacoronavirus genus as an RNA virus causes various
diseases in birds and mammals, including SARS-CoV-2. It contains an RNA polymerase with
proofreading activity(7, 8). The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains ~29800 bp (9), therefore Sprotein (spike protein) covers the surface of SARS-CoV-2, and consists of 1273 amino acids
with a protein size between 180-200 kDa. The S-protein is composed of two subunits (S1 and S2)
which play a key role in the cell membrane fusion process and receptor recognition, hence Spike
protein becomes a target for vaccine development(10) (11, 12). The analysis of the SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence showed that Spike protein and RNA polymerase endure constant mutations
according to geographic location (Asia, Europe and America). The SARS-CoV-2 genome
analysis and generation of data have been a key component of discovering SARS-CoV-2

pathogenicity (13-15). Due to the frequent travels link between Rwanda to other geographic
regions like China, United Arab Emirates, Europe, America and other African countries. It
enhanced the chance to spot the first COVID-19 case on March 14, 2020; in Rwanda and the
initial period of total lockdown started seven days later on March 21, 2020 (16). We
hypothesized that the viral evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the mutations within
the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We aimed to track evolution and mutation within nucleotides
sequence and proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genome by phylogenetic analysis to understand the
pathogenesis and viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda.

Methods
In total, we downloaded 75 genomes sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from the global initiative on
sharing all influenza data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) database, such as 10 genomes
isolated in Rwanda, 3 genomes isolated in Code d’Ivoire, 2 genomes isolated in Zimbabwe, 1
genome isolated in Zambia, 4 genomes isolated in Uganda, 1 genome isolated in Tunisia, 3
genomes isolated in South Africa, 3 genomes isolated in Sierra Leone, 5 genomes isolated in
Senegal, 3 genomes isolated in Reunion, 3 genomes isolated in Congo, 3 genomes isolated in
Mozambique, 3 genomes isolated in Morocco, 2 genomes isolated in Madagascar, 3 genomes
isolated in Kenya, 2 genomes isolated in Gambia, 2 genomes isolated in Gabon, 3 genomes
isolated in Equatorial Guinea, 3 genomes isolated in Egypt, 3 genomes isolated in Democratic
Republic of Congo, 3 genomes isolated in Algeria, 1 genome isolated in Cameroon, 2 genomes
isolated in Botswana, 3 genomes isolated in Benin. These genomes sequences were analyzed
with 4 Wuhan genomes isolated in China using the MEGA software version 10.0.4 with default

parameters (17). All targeted genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples were aligned to the reference
strains using the Maximum Parsimony method by the Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting algorithm (18).
The nucleotide variants within the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the coding regions were performed
by Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool(19).
Results
Phylogenetic analysis
We compared the SARS-CoV-2 query sequences isolated in Rwanda from July to August 2020
to the other SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in Africa with Wuhan strains. The analysis of
phylogenomic indicated that SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Rwanda belongs to lineage B.1. We found
a significant sequence similarity of 90-95% between the WH-Human1_China_2019-Dec genome
sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 present in Rwanda. Our data add to important information about
the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Rwanda (Supplementary figure S1).
Mutational analysis
The lineage assessment among the different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B and B.1) indicated that
lineage B.1 dominant in the SARS-CoV-2 genome isolated from Rwanda. All SARS-CoV-2
genomes sequence from Rwanda presents a universal type of mutations.

DISCUSSION
The government of Rwanda implemented public health measures to reduce the spread of
COVID-19 like national lockdown, social distance between people, wearing face masks in public.
Therefore, the tracing showed that COVID-19 disease was maintained within the cities of
Rwanda and no further spread of SARS-Cov-2 in the entire population, which resulted in a lower
number of positive COVID-19 cases (16) (Fig. 1). The availability of the genome sequence of
SARS-CoV-2 supports valuable resources to understand the viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (20).
The genetic variation of the virus is classified into three clades (S, V, and G) (21); hence we note
that clade G appears to be predominant in ten clinical sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from
Rwanda. The clade G was mostly spread in North America and Europe (22, 23). The
phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Rwanda showed to be belonging to

phylogenetic lineage B.1, which is sharing a common ancestor with the SARS-CoV-2 strain
isolated in Europe, America, Asia and Australia (24). Further, the evolutional history was
inferred using the Maximum Parsimony method with 0.223 of consistency index (CI), 0.636 of
retention index (RI) and 0.142 of the composite index, therefore if CI is less than 0.5 designated
that much homoplasies has occurred which is similar to our findings (25). The percentage of
replicated tree taxa clustered indicated 90-95% (Supplementary figure S1). We performed a
mutational analysis by observing changes in bases within SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table 3) and
we found that all genomes sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Rwanda has a common type
of mutations (Table 4) such as non-coding variant at position 241 (C to T) which affect 5’-UTR
genome segment, 1746 (T to C), synonymous at position 3037 (C to T) which affect
ORF1ab/NSP3 protein, 7420 (C to T), 12439 (C to T), missense at position 14408 (C to T),
22524 (A to T), missense at position 23403 (A to G) which affect Spike protein, 25186 (G to T),
26017 (T to G). The open reading frames (ORF10, ORF6, PRF3a, ORF 7a, ORF7b and PRF1ab)
are predicted to encode for S-protein (S), NSP (non-structural proteins), (N) nucleocapsid
proteins, envelope (E) and membrane (M) (26, 27). Although the SARS-CoV-2 genomes
sequences used in this study indicated ten nucleotides difference compared to the reference
strains that belong to G clade. Similar results of the type of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 were
previously reported within the G clade (28). The genetic variations among the genome sequences
of SARS-CoV-2 from Africa could be linked with the different geographical locations of each
country.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic analysis shows genetic variation and the common genes or proteins but doesn’t
rule out the probability that the importation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus originates from Europe,
Asia or America. We recommend that the utility of epidemic surveillance based on genome
sequence analysis as a key factor in monitoring the evolution and origin of SARS-CoV-2 in
Rwanda.
