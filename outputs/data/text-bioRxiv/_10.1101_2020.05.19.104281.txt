Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) has caused currently ongoing global plague and imposed great challenges to
health managing systems all over the world, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths.
In addition to racing to develop vaccines, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to this virus have been extensively
sought and are expected to provide another prevention and therapy tool against this frantic pandemic. To
offer fast isolation and shortened early development, a large human naïve phage display antibody library,
was built and used to screen specific nAbs to the receptor-binding domain, RBD, the key for Covid-19 virus
entry through a human receptor, ACE2. The obtained RBD-specific antibodies were characterized by
epitope mapping, FACS and neutralization assay. Some of the antibodies demonstrated spike-neutralizing
property and ACE2-competitiveness. Our work proved that RBD-specific neutralizing binders from human
naïve antibody phage display library are promising candidates to for further Covid-19 therapeutics
development.

Introduction
Around December of 2019, pneumonia patients afflicted by an unknown type of coronavirus, which later
named as 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19 by WHO, had emerged in Wuhan China. In the past 5
months, the highly contagious virus has since then quickly spread to almost every nation in the world,
infecting more than 5 million people and resulting in more than 320,000 deaths1. To this date, this pandemic
marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus human infection in the 21st century, after the outbreak of
the deadlier Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1). The whole world was caught off guard to this challenge.
To flatten the incident curve, social measures such as quarantine, lockdown and distancing were widely
applied, leading to a sudden pause of most economic activities. Among all the measures mobilized to
combat the plague, like to many others, scientific approach is the decisive and ultimate answer.
In past months biological studies have found strong conservatives and resemblances between SARS-CoV1 and Covid-19 in genomic sequences, mode of infection and to certain extent, clinical pathology2,3,4. Like
dealing many infectious diseases, the first effective step whenever possible is always preventing the
initiation of an infection by isolation or prophylaxis measures such as antibody or vaccine. Vaccines
potentiating host immune responses and eliciting protective antibody production will quickly mobilize

humoral and cellular immunity defenses against subsequent viral invasion. When lack of vaccine, the
passive immunity conferred by specific monoclonal antibodies has well been recognized in the treatment
of many viral diseases, for example, FDA approved anti-RSV drug Synagis5,6. Based on the limited
scientific data, treating Covid-19 patients with convalescent plasma from recovered donors appears safe,
clinically effective and reduces mortality7. Significant efforts have been made to develop therapeutic antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV8 and MERS9. High viral biological similarities and promising animal
efficacy of these antibodies highlight the potential to obtain Covid-19 specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)
for its therapy and prophylaxis.
The entry of Covid-19 to human cells has been recently reported that Covid-19 virus binds to the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through it spike protein, or S-protein, which is almost identical
in the infection of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS4,10 . The portion in S-protein, called receptor binding domain
(RBD), is the exact motif that interacts with ACE211. Details of the molecular interaction between RBD
and ACE2 have been analyzed to atom level12, facilitating the design of blockade agents, including antibody
to intervene the entry process. In the meantime, in a race to win this unprecedented battle, every second
matters in the generation of lead antibody molecules. Instead of immunizing animals and screening
subsequent hybridoma, we took advantages of an in-house very large naïve human antibody phage display
library built in our lab. Here we summarized the construction of the library, the isolation and
characterization of RBD nAbs, providing strong basis for further development of potential antibody
arsenals for COVID-19.

Results
Human antibody phage display library
Human antibody phage display library has become the dominant route13, 14 to quickly obtain antibody leads
and develop antibody-based biotherapeutics to an almost given target. A large human naïve antibody phage
display library (Named as EHL Library) was built in-house based upon conventional phage display
technique, in a similar protocol reported earlier15. To ensure the library to be a high-value research resource,
we adopted multiple measures to achieve extensive diversity and super-size during the whole process.
PBMCs of 37 donors from a variety of ethnic groups and nationalities across the world, including Latinos,
African American, Caucasian, Chinese, Russians, Hindus, Vietnamese, Philippines, Native American,
Japanese and Jewish etc. were collected to enhance the diversity range of antibody variable genes to be
used in the scFv assembly. 7 subfamilies of variable heavy (VH) genes, 7 subfamilies of variable kappa
genes ( Vκ ) and 11 subfamilies of variable lambda genes ( Vλ) were separately amplified and recovered.
Two types of scFv libraries, VH-Vκ and VH- Vλ, were separately assembled and cloned into phagemid
pADL-10b, resulting two types of scFv libraries, each containing more than 5×1010 colony forming unit
(cfu) in size, after total 100 repeats of electroporation of ligated phagemid constructs. Random sequencing
of 100 colonies of each library revealed over 80% of correct scFv-coding and full usage of all antibody
subfamily genes (data not shown). The utility and quality of the EHL Library were validated by successful
screening of specific hits over a dozen of selected human targets, mostly tumor-associated antigens, with
average KD of two digits nM (data not shown).
Validation of Covid-19 spike-expressing cell line
A surrogate tool is essential to research on any very deadly contagious pathogens such as Covid-19, whose
spike protein is of great needs not only as purified form but also as membrane one. A cell membrane
protruding spike may not behave the same as it presents in its viral particle, the availability of such cell line
can serve most needs to some extent such as antibody binding examination and competition assays. A
mammalian cell line ID8 was generated by transfection of 293FT with a pseudo lenti vector that contains
gene encoding the full-length Covid-19 spike protein, a transmembrane motif (TM) and a 3xFLAG tag at

C-terminal (Fig. 1, A) and selected under Blasticidin S hydrochloride. To verify the spike expression,
structure and function, ID8 cells was stained by anti-FLAG-FITC (Fig. 1, B) or human ACE2-mFc,
followed by anti-mouse-FITC (Fig. 1, C). and analyzed by FACS. Results showed that both stains exhibited
significant right shift of ID8 population (Fig.1, B and C, red peaks), validated the ID8’s ability to bind
ACE2, indicating the spike is in trimeric membrane status and mimics the function of Covid-19 spike16.

Biopanning naïve phage antibody library yielded multiple RBD hits
Aiming to obtain antibodies that directly target to RBD of Covid-19 spike so that they have limited binding
sites, and great chance of interference to the interaction between spike and ACE2, we used RBD fusion
(RBD-mFc) instead of full-length or subunit of Covid-19 spike protein as bait in the biopanning from EHL
library in a solid phase approach17. 3 rounds of biopanning yielded vast enrichment as output titer increased
over 100 times (data not show) over that of 1st round. Upon monophage ELISA screening on the 3rd -round
output, more than 95% of clones were positive. After sequencing the scFv genes of positive hits, we found
very focused clone specificity (2 uniqueness among 90 available scFv sequences, data not shown). To
harvest diversified binders, we turned to 2nd round output for ELISA screening (Fig2, A). Among 160
positive hits we identified 42 unique clones, with many have minor differences in amino acids. Through
multi-alignment of the scFv primary sequences, a phylogenetic tree was generated (Fig 2, B) to measure
homology gap between them.

Fig.2 Monophage ELISA screening Covid-19 RBD phage antibodies
EHL library was panned with Covid-19 for 2 rounds. Single colonies form 2nd-round output was picked to prepare
monoclonal phage antibody solutions, examined by ELISA with RBD, mouse Fc and 293F cells. Only RBD positive
hits were resorted to DNA sequencing of scFv genes. A. Chart of absorbance (A450) on RBD plate ELISA. B. Amino
acid sequence multi-alignment of unique scFv clones positive for RBD binding.

By checking the amino acid sequences, we saw majority of the hit clones (37/42) belong to lambda scFv
and only five belong to kappa scFv (data not shown), though equal amount of kappa and lambda scFv
library aliquots were mixed before first panning. Among the lambda scFv hits, most of them (30/37) have
almost same complementarity-determining region (CDR) compositions in both VH and Vλ, with sporadic
differences in the framework region (FR), implying fast enrichment of antibody recognizing certain epitope.

Membrane spike bound antibodies are specific for Covid-19
Phage antibody hits tend to be false positive by ELISA detection, due to the stickiness of phage proteins 18
and epitope/conformation differences between purified/truncated protein and membrane/full-length
parental molecule19 or lose the reactivity because the once exposed epitopes in protein fragment become
inaccessible in native protein. This is very true because in current case, the panning bait is a dimeric and
fragmented RBD (RBD-mFc), while Covid-19 native spike is a trimer20. To verify the authenticity of the
phage antibody binders and check their ability to recognize cell membrane trimeric Covid-19 Spike, we
first generated soluble antibodies to facilitate further characterization of their properties. Since many clones
are highly similar in CDR residues and only differ by a few FR residues, to reduce the work we transferred
22 scFv genes (one of every two close members from above alignment) from phagemid to an in-house
mammalian expression vector pFP and expressed them as scFv-huFc (human Fc) fusion. Upon protein-A
purification and aggregates removal to make sure monomer achieved over 95%, the antibodies were tested
by FACS on above-generated ID8 cells to screen positive membrane covid-19 spike binders, which are the
potential neutralizing antibody candidates.
8 out of the 22 expressed scFv-huFc antibodies demonstrated significant ID8 cell-binding capabilities with
varied shifts by FACS (Fig.3). We tried to rank the binders roughly by the positive percentages, which is

the reflection of apparent affinity instead of intrinsic affinity. Clone 1B1 seems to be the strongest spike
binder among them. 1B11 and 5C2 are comparable intermediate ones and the rest five are close as mild
ones. Reviewing their amino acid sequences (data not shown), we noticed that 1B11 share almost the same
CDR compositions are the rest five hits except 5C2 and 1B1but differs in several FR residues, however
1B11 exhibited significant higher P2 than its cognate members, indicating affinity beneficial effect of those
different FR residues in 1B11. Future kinetics measurement should reveal the quantitative affinity gap.

Fig.3 FACS examination of RBD-binding antibodies to Covid-19 membrane spike on ID8 cells. Soluble scFv-huFc
of 22 hits that were RBD ELISA-positive were incubated with equal amount of ID8 cells, followed by goat anti-human
Fc (PE conjugated). Stained cells were analyzed to draw dot-plot by FACS. P2 Gating was set based on the background
of secondary antibody staining and considered positive. Only clones having positive percentages were shown.
Individual clone was labeled in each plot.

It is now known that the amino acid sequence homologies between MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2 are very high, especially the latter two, approximates to 75% for the spike proteins and are 73.7%
for RBDs3. More conserved in structure than primary sequence, the RBDs in both viruses bind the same
ACE2 in different affinities21. Genetically it has been revealed that in RBD, some area is conserved, and
some are hypervariable22. To investigate whether the 8 ID8 cell-binding positive antibodies from above
have any cross reaction to closely related spike proteins of SARS and MERS coronavirus, they were further
examined by ELISA across SARS spike protein (SARS-S), MERS Spike protein (MERS-S) and Covid-19
spike protein (Covid-19-S). As it showed in Fig.4, All 8 hits are exclusively specific for Covid-19 spike
and none of them has any cross reactivity to the other two spikes, indicating structurally conserved RBDs
are not quite immunogenic conservative among these coronaviruses.

Binding of 8 COVid-19 RBD-hits was examined
by ELISA to the spike proteins (named as SARSS, MERS-S and Covid-19-S) for SARS-COV-1,
MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 (Covid-19) and
measured by absorbance (A450). All hits
demonstrated strong positive to Covid-19-S
(yellow bars) and none cross-reacted to the other
two spikes (green and blue bars).

The Covid-19 RBD specific antibodies bind to different epitopes
Having obtained 8 Covid-19 spike specific human antibodies, we wondered how their binding epitopes
locating in its RBD and, more importantly, what is the potential impact on the binding of RBD to ACE2.
Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) based instrument Blitz offers a simple straight forward evaluation method of
antibody-receptor interaction at protein level23. Antibodies, RBD or ACE2 were loaded to appropriate
sensors sequentially, typically that the previous step has been well equilibrated. The ascending or flat
response curves recorded corresponding component incubated with sensors implied yes/no interaction
among proteins between adjacent layers (Fig.5). Some observations are clear to see from the Blitz results:
All hit clones bind to RBD by Blitz (Fig.5, A,B,C); 1B1 can concurrently bind to RBD with the other 6
antibodies (such as 1B11 etc.）except 5C2 (Fig.5 B,D); 1B1 mutually competes with 5C2 (Fig.5, C).
Consistent with the competition between 1B1 and 5C2, when RBD is bound by 1B1, it can no longer be
bound by 5C2, and vice versa. (Fig.5, D).

Combining the amino acid sequence information and this BLI study, we drew a putative Venn epitope map
of the 8 RBD-antibodies and ACE2 on Covid-19 RBD (Fig.6). For the convenience of description, we
categorized the epitope as group Ⅰ (1B1 antibody), group Ⅱ (5C2 antibody) and group Ⅲ (antibody 1B11,
1A5, 1A12, 1G6, 1H2 and 1C10).

Fig. 6 Venn map of Covid-19 hits and ACE2 on RBD
Epitope locations on RBD by the isolated 8 hit antibodies were deduced from the
above Blitz results and largely categorized into 3 groups (Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ). 1B1 and 5C2
have large overlapped sites in RBD and may block the most part of RBD-ACE2
interaction interface. The group Ⅲ hits (1B11, 1A5, 1G6, 1C10, 1A12 and 1H2)
binds to an independent site from 1B1 or 5C2, however may block a minor side of
ACE2-RBD interaction interface.

Spike+ cells are bound simultaneously by RBD-antibodies and ACE2
In silicon examined by Blitz done above on the obtained RBD-antibodies implied their potential varied
interferences to the ACE2 interaction with Covid-19 Spike. Since their epitopes/affinities are different, we
started to investigate whether competition exists, or how much is it, between these antibodies and ACE2 in
binding to ID8 cells. A preliminary experiment was done to check if there was dual binding when both
ACE2 and individual antibodies were added to ID8 cells. Equal concentration of ACE2-mFc fusion (mouse
Fc, MW 110KD) and any one of the 8 RBD-specific scFv-huFc (human Fc, MW 100KD) were mixed and
incubated with ID8 cells before appropriate 2nd fluorescent reagents were added for FACS analysis. Dotplots of PE and FITC channels were depicted (Fig.7) for every sample.

Fig.7 Dual binding examination of Covid-19 RBD-hit antibodies
All 8 RBD hits separately were incubated together and ACE2-mFc at around equal concentrations before adding to
ID8 cells. Both antibody binding and ACE2 binding were detected by corresponding specific secondary antibodies
(different fluorescent conjugation). Upper row from left: FITC-conjugated secondary control, 1A5, 1H2, 1C10, 5C2.
Lower row from left: ACE2-mFc (alone, positive control), 1A12, 1G6, 1B11 and 1B1

Dot-plots of all groups demonstrated strong ACE2 binding (FITC channel), which is consistent with earlier
study that ID8 expresses functional Covid-19 Spike. On one side, the fact that ACE2+ population in all
groups are greater than 95% (Fig.7) implied limited blockade of RBD-antibodies to prevent Covid-19 spike
from binding to ACE2 when both are present simultaneously at around equal concentration. On the other
side, all antibodies demonstrated positive binding to the ID8 cells as well, at varied extent from~11% (1H2)

to ~94% (1B1). Again, 1B1 championed the ranking, followed by 1B11 and 5C2. By the percentage of dual
positive population, we can easily rank the antibodies in order of 1B1>1B11>5C2>1G6 etc. for their
competitiveness against ACE2. Surprisingly the rest four antibodies (1H2, 1C10, 1A5 and 1A12), who
share the same CDR compositions (but not exact amino acids in FR) as 1B11 and 1G6 (thus the similar/same
epitope), showed significant less binding on cells, implying weaker affinities caused by the different FR
residues. Overall the data here proved that there is varied extent of competitiveness between these RBD
antibodies and ACE2 in binding to Covid-19 spike.
RBD nAbs preventively block interaction between Covid-19 spike and ACE2
Next we explored another scenario where antibodies are much abundant than ACE2 (this is possible since
antibody can be administered beforehand in large amount as prophylaxis measure). In this case we wanted
to find out if any of these RBD-hits can significantly reduce the binding of spike to ACE2, i.e., neutralize
the virus (here again we used Covid-19 spike-expressing ID8 as surrogate). We first titrated the
concentration of ACE2-mFc on fixed amount of ID8 cells. ACE2 is abundantly and widely expressed in
human epithelial cells, the total (the soluble and membrane) expression level is yet to know，although
ACE2 in the serum level has been reported24. We found that when ACE2-mFc was around 0.02 µg/ml ,
~100% ID8 cells were positive by FACS (Fig.8, green histograms), indicating very strong interaction
between Covid-19 spike and ACE2. For the neutralization assay, we set up a serial dilution (2 times down)
of every candidate antibody from the 10 µg/ml to ~0.31 µg/ml (a point where there was minimal impact on
ACE2-mFc binding to spike+ cells in a preparatory experiment) , added them individually to same fixed
amount of ID8 cells and incubated enough time to saturate the cells (spike). Next, the saturation
concentration of ACE2-mFc was loaded to compete out antibody. Finally, only signals from FITC channel
was collected, which were the MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) numbers of ACE2-mFc binding to ID8
cells. Histograms of part of the diluted sample concentrations (shown in Fig.8) clearly demonstrated that
some the RBD-hits, such as 5C2, can objectively block Covid-19 spike from binding to ACE2 at various
concentrations.

Fig.8 Competition FACS evaluation of neutralizing potentials of RBD-hit antibodies
Serial diluted RBD antibodies were preincubated separately with ID8 cells before adding of ACE2-mFc, whose
binding was analyzed by APC-conjugated secondary antibody. The FACS plot of ACE2-mFc with or without
antibody is shown. Negative control (red), no antibody ACE2-mFc control (green), and only histograms of three
antibody concentrations 10 µg/ml plots (pink), 2.5 µg/ml plots (yellow) and 0.31 µg/ml plots (aqua) were shown.
Upper row from left: 1B1, 1A12, 1B11, 1A5. Lower row from left: 1G6, 1C10, 1H2 and 5C2 .

When there is competition between any RBD hit antibody and ACE2 in binding to Covid-19 spike, an
increased antibody concentration would lead to reduced ACE2 attachment, quantitatively represented by
MFI. Indeed, after grouping the MFIs as shown in Fig.9, at 10 µg/ml (a clinically achievable serum
concentration) we observed among 8 of the antibodies, at least 3 hit antibodies (1G6, 1C10 and 5C2)
demonstrated significant ACE2 attachment reduction, decreasing the MFI of ACE2-mFc by as much as
60%, in comparing to negative antibody control. The rest 5 hits caused little to moderate inhibition at this
concentration. As antibody concentration lowered down (less antibody binding), MFI increased, more
ACE2-mFc occupied the ID8 cells. Overall a dose-dependent manner is observed for the antibody inhibition.
Among them, 5C2 performed the best in neutralizing Covid-19 spike protein in binding to ACE2-mFc
across all dilutions to the lowest point, with around 50% reduction of MFI. Surprisingly, contrary to the
previous ranks where 1B1 seemed to be best in binding to RBD and probably have large portion of
overlapped epitopes with 5C2, it demonstrated much mild inhibition of spike in binding to ACE2 in this
assay. This finding highlighted the importance of epitope location in order to be an efficient blocker besides
decent affinity.

Discussions
In the report we described the construction of a naïve human antibody phage display library and the usage
of it in isolation meaningful weapons against Covid-19. We have preliminarily characterized the epitopes,
specificity and neutralization potentials of the obtained human antibodies to Covid-19 spike. Our study
offered promising human nAb candidates for further development of antibody-based weapons against the
SARS-COV-2.

Antibody Phage display technology has contributed antibody drugs such as FDA-approved blockbuster
(Humira) and many clinical stage testing candidates25. Generally, immune libraries are preferred for the
generation of antibodies against infectious disease related targets due to the biased antibody repertoires as
a result of exposure and in vivo evolution of immune response to the infection26. However, the target
specific libraries must be constructed each time to get enriched antibodies against antigens from different
infections. A human PBMC-derived naïve phage naïve display antibody library is a ready-to-go tool, being
particularly valuable resources to general targets and shortened R&D process when developing antibodybased clinical therapeutics. Diversity and library size are the two most critical parameters in generating a
useful library for any given target27. In the study we first reported how such a library was built and became
a key resource to the R&D of antibody-based diagnostics and biotherapeutics .
With that advantage we quickly launched a campaign to screen hits, targeting Covid-19 spike (S) protein.
Since the outbreak of SARS, many reports have published to elucidate how the spike of corona virus is
responsible for interacting with host cell receptors, mainly human ACE2 to initiate infection 28,29.
Structurally, the receptor binding domain (RBD) locating from AA 321- 535 in S protein, is the exact
portion that interacts with ACE212,22. Aiming to have better chance in obtain potent nAbs that can efficiently
block RBD-ACE2 interaction, we used engineering expressed RBD as bait in solid phase biopanning.
Dozens of unique primary positive phage antibodies to RBD were selected by monophage ELISA and
proved to be very specific for Covid-19, with no cross binding to the other two closely related corona virus
members, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Through BLI analysis on Blitz these antibodies span at least two
independent groups of epitopes, each occupying part if not the complete ACE2 binding site in RBD.
Additionally, their viral neutralizing potency was evaluated by competition FACS. 3 of the 8 hits
demonstrated mild to significant competition in a concentration dependent mode to reduce spike binding
to ACE2, suggesting their preventative and therapeutic potentials in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.
One of the hits championed the competition assay, exhibited promising development value. Preliminary
microneutralization study on Covid-19 pseudo virus has proved some of the RBD-antibodies in this report
blocked viral infection (raw data).
Since outbroke last December to this date the Covid-19 viral destruction is still ongoing with no foreseeable
end. Without any validated medicines clinically available currently, diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic
remedies are desperately needed should the virus last long and come back soon. NAbs are historically
effective in fighting against viral pandemics as they effectively inhibit virus’s entry by preventing viral
attachment or membrane fusion30,31 and very likely to play a critical role to fight Covid-1932. As late as
from the outbreaking of SARS, MERS, Ebola to Zika, to Covid-19 convalescent plasma7, 33,34 which may
contain polyclonal nAbs collected from recovered patients have been tested to treat seriously ill people and
have shown certain reduction protection in some cases. Scientific studies of the nAbs to SARS, MERS on
animal models proved their protection effect. Currently researchers all over the world are racing to isolated
nAbs from Covid-19 immunized animals (llama)35, available SAR-Cov-1 neutralizing antibody36 and/or
human B cells of infected patients37 to develop potential therapeutics.
Classical antibody neutralization is strictly defined as the reduction in viral infectivity by the binding of
antibodies to the surface of viral particles (virions), thereby blocking a step in the viral replication cycle
that precedes virally encoded transcription or synthesis38,39. In that regard nAbs are the best correlate of
protection from viral infection after vaccination. Nabs offers the direct function of abolition of a pathogen’s
infectivity upon binding, with no participation of any other components of the innate or adaptive immune
system. So, neutralization is probably the most robust and powerful function that antibodies exert against
viruses. In a broadly sense antibodies can neutralize viral infectivity in several additional ways40,41. They
may block viral uptake into cells, prevent uncoating of the genomes in endosomes, cause aggregation of
virus particles, or lyse the viral membrane through by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These protective antibodies are targeting
components in other viral cycle steps, as well as utilizing human immune system to clear virus42.

While there is little doubt that clinical Covid-19 nAbs can be developed sooner or later, there is a big hurdle
in front of us to overcome, that is, strain coverage and escape. Diversities of collected 86 variant covid-19
genomes have been recently unveiled43. Of note, deletions in spike glycoprotein and mutations located in
RBD have been found. More mutations are likely to emerge as the virus continues to transmit across ethics
and global regions. Subsequently monoclonal antibody reacting to specific epitope in RBD is probably
vulnerable to the mutations and glycosylation modifications. Additional studies to dissect the exact
recognizing residues of any candidate neutralizing Covid-19 antibody are necessary before moving to
further development. Alternatively, as backup it’s rational to develop broad nAbs to more conservative
regions in spike44,45. In fact, nAbs targeting a highly conserved epitope in RBD has been isolated from
convalescent plasma of SARS patient46. Combination therapy with multiple non-competing nAbs
recognizing different epitopes on the RBD/spike may be another ideal direction to avoid immune escape
and increase coverage47.
In summary, we have reported here the isolation and characterization of nAbs to Covid-19 RBD from a
human naïve phage display library. Our work provided promising antibody candidates as potential
diagnostic, prophylaxis and therapeutic reagents for further development.

Materials and Methods
Construction of EHL human naïve phage display library
A very large naïve human single chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display library was constructed
similarly as previously reported15. Briefly, PBMCs (10 million/donor, purchased from BuyPBMCs,
Precision for Medicine, https://buypbmcs.com/) collected from healthy donors to extract the total RNA
(Cat#74104, RNeasy®, QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA was generated by using
SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermofisherScientific, cat#18080051) from
every RNA sample (5 µg RNA /rxn) with random hexamer primers or Anchored Oligo(dT)20
(ThermofisherScientific, cat#12577011) before pooling. Variable heavy (VH) and light (Vκ and Vλ) genes
were amplified separately from the pooled cDNA samples by two rounds of PCR using HotStarTaq (Qiagen,
Cat# 203443) and human antibody sequences primers derived from previous report15. A pair of SfiI sites
were incorporated into the 5’-end of VH primers and 3’-end of Vκ and Vλ primers to facilitate followed
phagemid cloning. Overlapping of VH-Vκ or VH-Vλ scFv genes were assembled separately. Amplified
scFv PCR fragments were purified with Gel Extraction kit (Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit, Cat# 28706,
QIAGEN), and subjected to SfiI (Fast Digest SfiI, ThermofisherScientific, cat# 1824) digestion.
To construct the scFv phagemid library, vector pADL-10b (Antibody Design laboratories, cat#PD0105)
was completely digested with SfiI (ThermoFisherScientific, cat#FD1824) followed by dephosphorylation
treatment (CIAP, ThermoFisherScientific, cat#18009027) before purification with PCR purification kit
(QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, cat#28104). Digested scFv and pADL-10b was ligated by the ratio of 3:1,
using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Cat#M0202) and incubation overnight at 12°C. Ligation mixture was purified
and electroporated into TG1 E. coli (Lucigen, Cat# 60502-2) over fifty shocks for each library. Combined
TG1 slurry culture was grown in non-expression (NE) media (2YT containing 1% glucose and 100 µg/ml
carbenicillin) at 37°C for one hour before a serial of 10 times dilutions were made to measure the
approximate size of the kappa or lambda scFv library. The rest culture was expanded in NE media, grew
to OD600 around 2, and aliquots of culture were frozen as seeds for future production of phage libraries.
Propagation of combinatorial phage libraries rescued by M13K07 helper phage (Antibody Design
laboratories, cat#PH010L) was performed as published procedures47. Phage antibody library aliquots were
stored at -70°C in a solution of 50% glycerol and named as EHL library.
Construction of Covid-19 spike-expressing cell line

To express the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in mammalian cells, a codon optimized cDNA
(GenBank:NC_045512.2) encoding the full-length S protein, a transmembrane motif (TM) and 3xFLAG
tag was synthesized and cloned into a pRRL-derived vector (R48) by XbaI/XmaI, yielding pRRL-19SFLAG-BSD. 293FT cells were transfected with lenti-viral made from SARS-CoV-2 S plasmid and other
vectors (pLP-1-Gag/Pol, pLP-2-Rev and pLP-VSVG, all in-house made) containing packaging elements.
Media was replaced once 12-16 hours after transfection. Pseudo virus stock (named as LV-19S) was
collected from the supernatant and filtered through 0.45 µm membrane.
To build stable cell line expressing Covid-19 S, ID8 cells (a gift from Institute of immunotherapy, Fujian
Medical University) was seeded at 10,000/well in DMEM (Gibco, cat#31600-034) +10% FBS (GeminiBio,
cat#100-500 ) in6-well culture plate and incubated overnight. The next morning, 1ml of LV-19S (and
vehicle control) was added and incubation continued 24 hours before changing the media with Screening
media (DMEM+10% FBS containing 10 µg/ml Blasticidin S hydrochloride (Invitrogen, cat#21001)).
Screening media was changed every 3 days until day 7 when non-infected cells all gone. Continue the
infected cell culture, which is the stable cell line, maintained in DMEM+10% FBS containing 8 µg/ml
Blasticidin S hydrochloride.
Panning of RBD and monophage ELISA
Solid phase biopanning of hits from a phage display antibody library was conducted as previously reported49
with minor modifications in library blocking. Briefly Covid-19 spike RBD (Sinobiological, cat#40592V05H，mouse Fc fusion) protein was coated at 2µg/ml in wells of a 96-well Nunc Maxisorp microplate
and placed in a refrigerator overnight. One each of Kappa and lambda EHL Library aliquots were mixed
and blocked with 4% milk PBS (MPBS), 10 million 293F cells (to deplete potential binders to residual
protein contaminated in vendor’s RBD) and 10µg/ml mouse IgG (to deplete mouse Fc binders) before
adding the library stock to the RBD-coating wells. The rest steps are standard protocol49. Two to three
cycles of biopanning were performed before ELISA screening was conducted to select the specific RBDbinding phage antibodies from the output libraries. Monophage ELISA was carried out essentially as
described50, 51 with RBD as coating antigen, mouse Fc and 293F cells as negative control.
Soluble expression and purification of scFv-Fc
Unique scFv clones from DNA sequencing analysis were selected for further subcloning and fusion
expression with human Fc. ScFv genes were cut and paste with SfiI and NcoI sequentially from the
phagemid vector into pFP vector (in-house made). Freestyle 293F (ThermoFisherScientific, Cat#R79007)
cell was transfected with purified miniprep plasmid DNA (QIAgen minipreps kit, Qiagen, Cat#29107) as
described (Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent, ThermoFisher Scientific,
Cat#13778500) in 30-ml volume. scFv-Fc product was purified by protein-A affinity Purification column
(HiTrap® Protein A High Performance, GE Life science, cat#GE17-0402-01) and size exclusion
chromatography (GE SEC, superdex 200, GE Life science, cat#GE17-0612-10) to remove aggregates,
whenever necessary. Monomer percentage was analyzed by HPLC-SEC52.
Blitz characterization of hits and epitope mapping
The binding sites of obtained antibodies to RBD was examined by Blitz system (ForteBio, Pall
Lifesciences). 10 µg/ml Biotinylated RBD protein was captured by streptavidin biosensor (ForteBio, cat#
18-5019), followed by sequential binding of 10 µg/ml RBD antibody A then 10 µg/ml antibody B, in the
presence of 10 µg/ml antibody A, or vice versa. Alternatively, 10 µg/ml antibody A was captured by antihuman Fc biosensor (ForteBio, cat# 18-5060) until saturation, followed by sequential binding of 10 µg/ml
RBD, antibody B. Interaction curves were collected and analyzed to determine the relative binding locations
of the antibodies on RBD.
FACS examination of hits binding to Spike

Spike expressing cell 1D8 was maintained in 1640 media. To examine if spike trimer was expressed, both
FITC conjugated anti-FLAG (CST, cat#8146) and ACE2-mFc (Sinobiologics, cat#10108- H05H) and
FITC-anti-mouse-IgG (Biolegend , cat#405305) were incubated with 1-2 million 1D8 cells following
standard FACS protocol and analyzed by Beckman.
To examine if the antibody hits from ELISA screening were still capable of binding to native spike trimer,
the individual antibody hit at 5 µg/ml and/or ACE2-mFc was incubated with 1-2 million 1D8 spike+ cells
and detected by anti-human-Fc PE (invitrogen , 12-4998-82) and FITC Goat anti-mouse-IgG (Biolegend ,
cat#405305 ) or APC Goat anti-mouse-IgG (Biolegend , cat# 405308 ) following standard FACS protocol
and analyzed by Beckman FACS (CytoFLEX, CytExpert2.0).
Neutralization assay of RBD-antibodies by FACS
To check whether ACE2-Spike interaction can be blocked by the isolated nAbs, individual titrated antibody
from 10 ug/ml down to 0.31 ug/ml (2 times down) was incubated with 1-2 spike+ cells for 1 hour at 4°C
before adding of 0.02 ug/ml ACE2-mFc followed by FITC conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Biolegend ,
cat#405305) and the MFI of FITC and positive percentage were collected.
