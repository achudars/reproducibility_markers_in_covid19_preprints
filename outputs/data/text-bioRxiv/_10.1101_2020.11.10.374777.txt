Abstract
Epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests that Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine
induced trained immunity protects against non-specific infections. Multiple clinical trials are
currently underway to assess effectiveness of the vaccine in the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). However, the durability and mechanism of BCG trained immunity remain unclear.
Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG
vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections, and transcriptomic alterations reported in
COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very
long-lasting transcriptomic changes that, unsurprisingly, mimic viral infections by upregulated
antiviral defense response, and, counterintuitively. oppose viral infections by downregulated
myeloid cell activation. These durability and mechanistic insights have immediate implications
in fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, besides conferring adaptive immunity against
tuberculosis, is considered to induce trained immunity, a general long-term stimulation of innate
immune response that provides nonspecific protection against pathogens, especially respiratory
tract viral infections (1-3). Insights from human vaccination and experimental infection models,
and animal models suggest that transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional reprogramming of
hematopoietic stem cells toward myelopoiesis, and epigenetic modifications of peripheral
myeloid cells drive BCG induced trained immunity (4-7). Currently, the prospect that the
vaccine may limit the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a subject
of immense interest (8-12). Epidemiological studies have shown that countries with childhood
BCG vaccination policy, compared to nations without the policy, faced lower prevalence and
mortality of COVID-19 (13, 14). However, at the same time,, no association between childhood
vaccination and protection from COVID-19 in adulthood has also been reported (15), fueling the
speculation that BCG induced trained immunity might be short-lived (16). Meanwhile, a recent
retrospective study of a cohort of adults who received or did not receive the vaccine in the
preceding 5 years has suggested that BCG vaccination is possibly associated with a lower
incidence of illness during the pandemic (16). Also, while interventional clinical trials are
underway to test whether BCG may have an immediate beneficial effect in COVID-19, a
randomized clinical trial has shown that BCG vaccination in the elderly lengthens the time to
first infection and reduces the incidence of new infection, especially of respiratory tract viruses
(3). Interestingly, both the above studies (3, 16) surprisingly found no evidence of excessive
systemic inflammation in vaccinated subjects, alleviating the concern that BCG trained
immunity, due to elevated innate immune response, may add to hyperinflammation in severe
disease and worsen the condition (3). The negative evidence of inflammation has been indirectly

explained by arguing that BCG vaccination may lower systemic inflammation through enhanced
antiviral defense response leading to decreased viral loads (3, 16). Taken together, an improved
understanding of both the durability and the mechanisms of BCG induced trained immunity is
urgently required, particularly in view of the concern that indiscriminate use of the vaccine may
jeopardize supply required for vaccination of children to protect them against tuberculosis, and
the possibility that BCG may produce deleterious effects in severe COVID-19 patients (10).
Given the potential for knowledge discovery from themed collection and integration of available
transcriptomic datasets (17), an integrative analysis of human epidemiological transcriptomic
data related to BCG vaccination and viral respiratory infections, along with COVID-19
transcriptomic data, is presented here toward understanding the durability and mechanism of
trained immunity.
Results
Clustering differentially expressed genes (DEG) in whole blood (WB) of infants 2, 6, 12, 18 and
26 weeks following BCG vaccination (18), compared to the baseline, show directionally
consistent expression changes across time points (Figure 1A). Similarly, clustering DEG in BCG
stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), compared to unstimulated PBMC, of
BCG naïve adults and BCG vaccinated adults - median time since vaccination, 10 years - before
and after 2, 7 and 14 days of an intradermal BCG challenge (19) shows directionally consistent
changes across time points in general, with vaccinated subjects exhibiting higher level of
transcriptomic alterations than naïve subjects (Figure 1B). Notably, clustering of common genes
between the above two clusters (Figure 1A, B) shows that genes that are up- or down-regulated
in WB weeks and months after vaccination are similarly regulated in PBMC after BCG
stimulation, more so in vaccinated individuals (Figure 1C). These results clearly suggest that,

consistent with the concept of trained immunity, BCG vaccination leads to persistent changes in
peripheral blood cell transcriptome. Next, clustering of DEG in WB of patients with varying
severity and time points, and in- and out-patient status of illness from infection with respiratory
viruses (20-23), compared to healthy or appropriate patient controls, shows transcriptomic
changes that are both common across viruses as well as virus specific, as expected, and differ in
magnitude in consonance with the variables (Figure 1D). Remarkably, clustering of DEG that
are common between the short-term BCG group (Figure 1A) and virus group (Figure 1D)
shows strikingly similar and contrasting pattern of altered gene expression between the BCG and
the virus group as a whole; (i) a major set of genes that are upregulated in both the groups, (ii)
another major set of genes that are downregulated in the BCG and upregulated in the virus
group, (iii) a minor set of genes that are downregulated in both the groups, and (iv) another
minor set of genes that are upregulated in the BCG and downregulated in the virus group (Figure
1E). Merging long-term BCG group (Figure 1B) further tightened this pattern (Figure 1F). The
gene regulation observed in the virus group (Figure 1F) is validated in general by an
independent cluster of DEG in WB or PBMC of adults, infants, and children with infection of
various respiratory viruses (24-26), compared to healthy controls (Figure 1G). Further
independent validation is obtained by clustering DEG in WB of adult patients in a cohort of
acute respiratory illness (ARI) from infection with various viruses (27), compared to the baseline
(Figure 1H); with day 0, representing up to 48 hours of ARI onset, resembling gene regulation
observed in the virus group (Figure 1F), and later time points showing absence of differential
expression of genes that were upregulated by both the BCG and the virus group (Figure 1F), and
reversal from up- to down-regulation for genes that were upregulated in the virus group and
downregulated in the BCG group. Another independent validation is observed with adult patient-

specific WB pattern of gene expression in COVID-19 (28); z-score transformed and normalized
gene counts in severe patient, especially at

time points of higher supplemental oxygen,

resembling the virus group (Figure 1F), and in the same patient during recovery or in mild
patients showing a trend toward opposite regulation (Figure 1I). Gene ontology analysis of all
the genes in the final BCG-virus cluster (Figure 1F) shows enrichment of various biological
process terms (Figure 1J); mainly, the genes that are upregulated in both the groups are
associated with terms related to type I interferon signaling, cytokine-mediated signaling, and
defense response to virus, whereas genes that are upregulated in the virus group and
downregulated in the BCG group are associated with myeloid leukocyte activation, myeloid
leukocyte mediated immunity, and other related terms. Next, genes in the final BCG-virus cluster
(Figure 1F) were examined for blood cell type distribution, with the results demonstrating a
clear myeloid bias for genes that are downregulated in the BCG and upregulated in the virus
group, and no gross bias for genes that are upregulated in both the groups (Figure 1K). Finally,
to validate this finding in disease setting, the BCG-virus cluster genes (Figure 1F) were
intersected with DEG identified in single-cell RNA-seq analysis of PBMC from severe and
severe-moderate patients of COVID-19 (29, 30), compared to healthy controls; as expected from
the above cell type distribution analysis (Figure 1F), a clear myeloid bias was found for the
genes that are downregulated in the BCG and upregulated in the virus group, whereas genes that
are upregulated in both the groups did not starkly differ in myeloid-lymphoid distribution
(Figure 1L). Also, unlike severe patients, severe-moderate cases did not show a clear
upregulation of genes that are downregulated in the BCG and upregulated in the virus group
(Figure 1F), consistent with observed differences (Figure 1D-F, H, I) among patients with
varying disease status including severity and time points.

Discussion
The present analysis suggests that BCG vaccination induces long-term changes in blood immune
cell transcriptome that partly mimic and partly oppose transcriptomic changes induced by viral
respiratory illnesses including COVID-19. The mimicking part relates to upregulation of defense
response to virus, and the opposing part to downregulation of myeloid cell activation in
vaccinated subjects, with upregulation of the same observed in patients. Given these, individuals
vaccinated with BCG in the near or distant past would be expected to have a higher basal level of
antiviral defense and a lower basal level of myeloid cell activation, rendering them less
susceptible to viral infections on account of the former, and to hyperinflammation, that
characterizes severe disease (16), on account of the latter. This prediction is consistent with the
epidemiological studies showing lower prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 in countries with
childhood BCG vaccination policy (13). Regarding mechanism, the present finding is in line
with the existing concept (2) that trained immunity involves reprogramming of myeloid cells,
and enhanced capacity for cytokine production and antimicrobial function. However, instead of
myeloid cell activation genes showing upregulation in vaccinated subjects, as might have been
possibly expected on account of enhanced innate immune response that is considered to
characterize trained immunity, these genes show persistent downregulation postvaccination.
Notably, a retrospective cohort study (16) and a randomized clinical trial (3) have recently
reported that BCG vaccination is not associated with systemic inflammation, alleviating the
concern that the vaccine may produce deleterious effects in severe COVID-19 by adding to
hyperinflammation. That BCG is not associated with inflammation (3, 16) has been indirectly
explained by arguing that BCG induced enhancement in antiviral defense would cause decreased
viral loads which in turn would lead to lower systemic inflammation (16). In contrast, the

analysis presented here would suggest that a suppressed level of myeloid cell activation may
directly limit innate immunity response from causing inflammation. In conclusion, the present
evidence suggesting high durability of BCG induced trained immunity provides a rationale
against possible indiscriminate use (10) of BCG vaccination as a measure to reduce the impact of
COVID-19 pandemic. Also, it offers a mechanistic reasoning to ease the concern (10) that BCG
induced trained immunity may escalate systemic inflammation and worsen the condition in
severe COVID-19 patients.
Materials and methods
Relevant publications and datasets were manually identified by extensively searching NCBI's
PubMed and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), with a preference for large and comparative
studies. Original author-identified gene sets were used, if available in full. Otherwise,
differentially expressed genes (DEG) with adjusted p value significance were identified from
GEO datasets by using GEO2R (31) for microarray or GREIN (32) for RNA-seq studies. DEG
were clustered and heatmaps produced using Heatmapper (33), with, wherever applicable, scale
type none, and average linkage and Euclidean distance. Gene ontology biological process
enrichment was determined using ToppGene Suite (34). The list of cell type elevated genes in
blood atlas (35) was used for cell type distribution analysis.

Integrative transcriptomics of BCG vaccination and viral respiratory diseases. (A-I)
Clustering of DEG identified under indicated conditions. Abbreviation: BCGv, BCG
vaccination; BCGvcs, BCG vaccination, challenge, and stimulation; BCGnc, BCG naïve and
challenged; BCGvc, BCG vaccination and challenged; S/T series, both severity and time series;
S3-S1, severity in decreasing order; T1-T3, sequentially from time of patient enrolment to
clinical resolution; S, severe; M, moderate; SM, severe compared to moderate; I, inpatient; O,
outpatient; IO, inpatient compared to outpatient; Mi, mild; SMi, severe compared to mild; IBV,
influenza B virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; IAV, influenza A virus, RSV-1 to -5, five
different RSV datasets; HRV, human rhinovirus; T series, time series; AR, both IAV and HRV;
BR, both ABV and HRV; MO, maximum supplemental oxygen. Clusters BCGvcs (B) and Virus
S/T series (D) are composed of most frequent DEG among samples. = indicates common genes
in the given clusters. Multicolored bar represent DEG directionality: red (42 genes), upregulation
in all BCG and all virus samples; green (5 genes), downregulation in all BCG and all virus
samples; orange (8 genes), upregulation in all BCG samples and downregulation in all virus
samples; purple (54 genes), downregulation in all BCG samples and upregulation in virus
samples. Sample specific details including original reference and data source, DEG identification
method, and cluster values are indicated in Supplementary Table 1. (J) Gene ontology
biological process (GO-BP) enrichment of genes in the final BCG-virus cluster (F, BCGv =
BCGvcs = Virus S/T series). Full results are presented in Supplementary Table 2. (K)
Distribution of genes in BCGv = BCGvcs = Virus S/T series cluster (F) among cell type elevated
genes. Distribution in tabular form is provided in Supplementary Table 3. (L) Clustering of
DEG identified in single cell RNA-seq analysis of severe (S) and severe-moderate (S-M)
