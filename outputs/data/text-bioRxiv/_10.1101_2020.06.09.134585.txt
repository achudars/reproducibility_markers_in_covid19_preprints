Abstract:

18

Background: The world is going through the critical phase of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by

19

human coronavirus, SARS-CoV2. Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes

20

across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However,

21

there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions

22

and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated

23

regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon.

24

Methods: To have an idea of the global changes in 5’ and 3’-UTR sequences, we downloaded

25

8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host

26

in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15

27

different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and

28

investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP)

29

and microRNA binding sites in these regions by ‘RBPmap’ and ‘RNA22 v2’ respectively.

30

Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue.

31

Results: We identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum

32

variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5’-UTR change

33

identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C , 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar

34

variants of 3’UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the

35

variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which

36

further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs.

37

Conclusion: Our results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk

38

between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the

Introduction:

58

Outbreak of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 has been proclaimed as a pandemic by the World

59

Health organization (WHO). From the first report of infection in Wuhan, China on December 31,

60

2019, the virus has infected 7.21M people worldwide till 9th June, 2020. SARS-CoV2 is an

61

enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA virus of genus Beta-coronavirus (β-CoVs) with

62

the entire genome size of approximately 30kb. This viral genome is composed of about 14 open

63

reading frames (ORF) which encodes both structural and non-structural proteins having a role in

64

their transmission, survival and pathogenesis (1). The main structural proteins translated from

65

sub-genomic mRNAs include spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane

66

glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) along with 16 non-structural proteins (nsp 1-16).

67

The genomic RNA element of SARS-CoV2 also includes 5’-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of

68

265bp length with a methylated cap and a 3’ polyadenylated UTR of length 229 bp, according to

69

the reference sequence from Wuhan.

70

Low fidelity of the RNA polymerase makes the RNA viruses prone to high frequency mutation

71

and the mutation determines the virus evolution (2). Systemic mutation analysis of the viral

72

genome revealed that the virus had mutated several times in spatio-temporal variation and has

73

evolved into numerous strains (3). This diversity of RNA strains might be correlated to severity

74

and mortality seen in COVID-19 (Corona Virus disease-2019). A recent phylogenetic network

75

analysis on 160 complete SARS-CoV2 genome reported that the virus appeared to evolve in

76

three distinct clusters A, B and C, with A being the ancestral type. Type A and C seemed to be

77

more prevalent in Americas and Europe, whereas type B was dominant in Eastern Asia (4).

78

During viral replication, subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized by a process of discontinuous

79

transcription with a common 5′-untranslated leader sequence [5’-UTR] and a 3’-noncoding

80

cotermini [3’UTR], identical to the viral genome (5). Hence, highly structured 3’ UTR of

81

positive-strand RNA viruses is indispensable control element in replication, transcription, and

82

translation of RNA viruses along with the 5’ UTR (6). Extent of structural and functional

83

conservation in the 5’-terminal of genomic RNA of different species of genus coronavirus has

84

been found to a distinctive magnitude (7). These terminal untranslated regions are thus

85

substantial site for RNA-RNA interaction and binding of viral and host cellular proteins for RNA

86

replication and translation (8).

87

Molecular evolution in the untranslated region i.e. the variation in the UTR region leads the virus

88

to evolve to a great extent. There are many studies which have considered the mutation in the

89

coding region with respect to geographical location. Here, we have enumerated the variants in

90

the 5’- and 3’-UTR regions of SARS-CoV2 genome. We have studied a total of 8595 viral

91

sequence samples worldwide for this purpose and found that there are some rare variants of UTR

92

that are distributed over a global spectrum, while some variants are specifically present in a

93

population at a comparatively higher frequency. This drove us to make a systemic catalogue of

94

the UTR variants across six continents of the world that could have a role in emergence of

95

different strains of SARS-CoV2. We have also looked at the possible regulation of viral genomic

96

RNA through binding of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and miRNAs in specific sequences

97

of the viral UTRs. There are experimentally validated evidences of human RBPs binding to the

98

regulated signals within the untranslated region of SARS-CoV RNA in order to control the viral

99

RNA synthesis and turnover. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is found to bind to the

100

leader sequence and HNRNPA1, HNRNPQ is bound to the 3’UTR of beta-coronavirus MHV.

101

Similarly, a host protein, MADP1 (zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA binding motif 1) interacts

102

with the 5′-UTR of SARS-CoV, influencing the RNA synthesis machinery (9). Likewise, there

103

are reports of miRNA binding to the viral genome, both in the coding and non-coding regions

104

(10). As the miRNA mediated decay of mRNA is observed mainly through the 3’UTR of the

105

gene in mammalian system, we are also interested to explore the host miRNA-mediated

106

regulation of the viral genome through the 3’-UTR of SARS-CoV2 via mRNA decay and

107

translational repression. This interplay of host RBP and miRNA in the untranslated region of

108

virus may delineate the role of UTRs in SARS-CoV2 virulence and survival and how variation in

109

the UTR can have an impact in the overall regulation.

Viral genome sequences retrieval/resource

114

We have downloaded complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence data in

115

FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), which is a

116

public repository of all influenza virus sequence. Our data involved only the human-host specific

117

viral sequence covering six continents of the world: Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America,

118

South America and Africa. From Asia, we have taken the viral sequence data from China

119

(n=197), India (n=205), Japan (n=123), Thailand (n=121) and Taiwan (n=102). From Europe,

120

the data is taken from Italy (n=109), Spain (n=671), England (n=2345), Russia (n=130) and

121

Germany (n=202). Viral sequence data is taken only from Australia (n=522), on behalf of

122

Oceania. Representative countries from North America include USA (n=3286) and Canada

(n=147). There are no further divisions for South America (n=281) and Africa (n=150). Initially

124

the plan was to retrieve viral sequences collected in a span of one month, just after an interval of

125

two month from the date of first report in the corresponding place, in order to catch the diversity

126

in the viral sequence in that region. But, unfortunately, due to less number of sequence

127

deposition in some countries, we had to deviate from the plan and retrieve all the available

128

sequences till May28, 2020 for them (Table 1). We have downloaded the sequences on 28th

Alignment to reference sequence

134

The reference sequence from Wuhan was taken as our reference from NCBI (NC_045512.2). All

135

the country specific sequences were aligned with the reference sequence separately using

136

Multiple Sequence Alignment Tool Clustal Omega (EMBL-EBI). As we were interested only in

137

the 5’- and 3’-untranslated region (UTR), and these positions are located at the two extreme ends

138

of the sequences, there is a chance of lower coverage and higher error-rate. To resolve this

139

ambiguity, we have put a high filtering cut-off of at least 70% coverage in a particular location of

140

that area.

141
142

Prediction of human RBP binding to viral UTR

143

For prediction of human RBPs bound to the UTR of a viral genome, we have used the web-tool

144

‘RBPmap’ that enabled prediction of RBP binding on genome sequences from a huge list of

145

experimentally validated motifs of RBPmap database. Weighted-Rank algorithm was used for

146

mapping the motifs (11). We have put the reference and mutated 5’- and 3’-UTR sequences

147

separately as query sequence with the in-built human RBP motifs of the database. From the

148

output, we have selected only the predicted RBPs with high z-score and p-value.

151

Prediction of human miRNA interaction with viral UTR

152

Putative human miRNA binding sites on viral UTR was assessed using the ‘RNA22 v2

153

microRNA target detection’ tool (12). As a target sequence input, we provided the reference and

154

mutated 3’-UTR sequences of virus genome. For input miRNA sequences, we have obtained a

155

list of all annotated human miRNAs with their sequences in FASTA format from miRBase

156

database (13). For all other criteria to be used for the prediction was given as per the default

157

settings and additionally homology with seed sequence and its complementary target sequence

158

were manually examined in the output file of interaction.

159
160

Validation of expression of concerned RBP and miRNAs

161

Expression of specific genes was obtained from ‘The Protein Atlas’ respective to normal lung

162

tissue. RNA-seq data from lung tissue generated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)

163

project was reported as mean pTPM (protein-coding transcripts per million), corresponding to

164

mean values of the different individual samples from each tissue. HPA RNA-seq data from lung

165

tissue was reported as mean pTPM (protein-coding transcripts per million), corresponding to

166

mean values of the different individual samples from each tissue. Tissue data for RNA

167

expression also obtained through Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) generated by the

168

FANTOM5 project, reported as Scaled Tags Per Million. GEPIA (14) web-tool was used to

169

obtain comparative expression of specific genes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and normal

170

lungs.

Results:

173

Worldwide cataloguing of prevalent UTR variants of SARS-CoV2

174

Sequence alignment of over 8500 virus samples collected from over 15 geographical locations

175

with the SARS-CoV2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) has yielded a total of 74 variants in the

176

5’ UTR and 83 variants in the 3’UTR. Among them, 28 unique variants have been summarized

177

in the Supplementary Table 1 based on a minimum variant percentage of 0.5. But for the

178

variants that are present in at least four populations, no such variant percentage cut off was taken.

179

The most common high frequency variant is the 241C>T, which lies in the leader sequence of

180

the SARS-CoV2 viral genome. China, being the ancestral domicile of the virus has a very low

181

percentage of this variant (Figure 1). Europe has the maximum frequency of this variant (Figure

182

2). Other than China, other countries in Asia also have a lower percentage of this variant (Figure

183

1). Thus, we can a see a clear effect of regional variation on the frequency of this variant.

184

Another study reported that this variant has co-evolved with three coding region mutations

185

(3037C > T, 14408C > T, and 23403A > G) of nsp3, RNA primase and spike glycoprotein. They

186

have also related this mutation with the increased transmissibility of the virus (15). Another

187

common variation in the 5’UTR is 187A>G, that is present in seven of our populations being

188

most prevalent in Italy and Canada. 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T are the most familiar variants

189

of 3’UTR among all the continents. 29742 variant has two alternative alleles with G>A being

190

more prevalent in India, USA and Africa, whereas G>T variant is more dominant in Thailand,

191

Taiwan, Germany, Australia and Canada. China and England has both the variants of almost

192

similar percentage. Hence, this variant seems not be associated with any specific region. Another

193

important variant of 3’UTR is 29734G>C, which is mostly seen in Europe and Australia, but

10

194

Italy has a quite high percentage of this variant than others (Figure 2). Most of the countries in

195

this study seem to have a moderate to significant variation in the 3’UTR of the viral genome.

196
197

Country-specific UTR variant patterns

198

All the 15 populations and sub-populations used in this study, has a definite pattern of UTR

199

variants of their own (Figure 1; Figure 2). Even countries in a single continent differ in their

200

UTR variation. Some variations are merely specific to a particular location with a quite

201

considerable percentage. The overall sequence of 5’UTR of SARS-CoV2 in Italy is

202

exceptionally variable, whereas the 3’UTR is substantially stable with a single variant in the

203

position 29701 (G>T). But England, also being a part of Europe, has a notable number of

204

variations in the 3’UTR having a relatively stable 5’-end. From our analysis, it is evident that

205

Russia had no such frequent variation in the UTR, except the 241C>T variant which was present

206

in 100% of the population. India had two striking variations in the 3’UTR, 29827A>T,

207

29830G>T, which was found nowhere in this global mutational landscape (Supplementary

208

Table 1). All the sequences under this study with these two variants are from Indian state of

209

Maharashtra, which has the highest number of SARS-CoV2 infected people within India. Most

210

interestingly, both of this variants occur simultaneously in majority of the cases. Similarly, South

211

America also had five unique mutations in the positions 29783G>T, 29786G>C, 29834T>C,

212

29838C>T and 29839A>G of 3’UTR.

215

Identification of host RBPs bound to viral 5’-UTR

216

RNA binding proteins belong to a class of proteins which bind to target RNA molecules through

217

characteristic binding motifs and perform a variety of functions. In fact, irrespective of the type

218

of RNAs, whether is coding or non-coding, specific RBPs get associated with RNAs right after

219

their birth and subsequently control the processing, stability, transport, translation, regulatory

220

function and turnover. As mentioned earlier, exogeneous viral RNA will also encounter host

221

RNA decay machinery when released into the cell and there are ample evidences that they

222

attempt to escape the process in order to maintain their successful propagation within the host.

223

One way to take care of the situation is to recruit host RNA stabilization factors into the

224

regulatory region, i.e. 5’ and 3’-UTRs (16). Table-2 lists the predicted host RBPs interacting

225

with the 5’-UTR of virus SARS-CoV2 as obtained using ‘RBPmap’.

226

In the next step, the logical exploration was to find out whether the most prevalent variations

227

identified in the 5’-UTR of the viral RNA genome could alter binding of any of these RBPs. The

228

‘A’ to ‘G’ change at position 187 coincided with the binding site of CUG-BP (also known as

229

CELF1) (Figure 3A), implicating that the variation might have some effect on CUG-BP binding.

230

In order to test that, we used the mutated sequence as ‘input’ and found that the single nucleotide

231

change didn’t have any effect on binding of CUG-BP to its target sequence. In other words, no

232

matter whether the virus has ‘A’ or ‘G’ at position 187 of its 5’-UTR, CUG-BP binds and

233

probably performs its function.

234

Then, we focused on the most important change in the 5’-UTR, the position at 241. Looking at

235

the distribution of this variation and the reports related to its association with virulence (15), we

236

had a belief that it might be giving some selective advantage to the virus. However, we didn’t

12

237

find any RBP binding site overlapping with this region. We changed the nucleotide at position

238

241 from ‘C’ to ‘T’ and used the mutated sequence in RBPmap. To our surprise, we found a

239

TARDBP binding site created upon this change (Figure 3B). TARDBP (also called TDP-43) is a

240

well characterized RBP which binds to specific ‘UG’ (and ‘TG’) rich sequences of RNA (and

241

DNA) and reported to facilitate translation when bound to 5’-UTR (17). From protein data bank

242

(PDB) we retrieved the co-crystal structure of TARDBP with single strand DNA (Figure 3C &

243

D) which indicated strong binding of the protein to that particular nucleic acid stretch. Hence,

244

our finding showed strong binding of TARDBP to viral 5’-UTR having ‘T’ at position 241. This

245

could be implicated in facilitating translation of viral proteins resulting in its effective

246

propagation within human host.

Identification of host RBPs bound to 3’-UTR of SARS-CoV2

253

Following the same principle and considering the fact that 3’-UTR is the most important site for

254

regulation of RNA stability and turnover, we also wanted to find out what are the RBPs

255

interacting with this region. The 3’-UTR reference sequence of SARS-CoV2 was fed into

256

RBPmap and we obtained a list of 3’-UTR binding RBPs selected on the basis of p-value and Z-

257

score (Table 2). As with 5’-UTR, here also we focused on the major variations in 3’-UTR to find

258

out if specific nucleotide change could interfere with the binding of specific RBPs. We found

259

that 3’-UTR variations at positions 29742 and 29774 could affect interaction of SRSF5 and

260

HNRNPA1 respectively. However, the regulation at 3’-UTR is not that simple. Another

261

important factor which needs be taken into account is whether there are host miRNA binding

262

sites present within the viral 3’-UTR region and how the combinatorial interaction of host RBPs

263

and miRNAs could dictate the viral RNA stability.

266

Finding of host miRNAs which could target viral 3’-UTR

267

In order to identify whether there are any host miRNA binding site present in viral 3’-UTR and if

268

so, what they are, we used the viral 3’-UTR sequence as ‘input’ in the miRNA prediction

269

software ‘RNA22 v2’. The algorithm predicts several of such miRNAs and we selected them

270

based on folding energy for heteroduplex formation and p-value (Table 3). As the most

271

important factor for the functional miRNA-target RNA interaction is to have the perfect

272

homology between the seed sequence of miRNA (2nd to 8th nucleotide from 5’ end) and the

273

corresponding target RNA sequence, we also explored the fact in the identified pairs.

274

Furthermore, whether the changes caused by the common variations interfere with the seed

275

sequence binding was also investigated. The interesting part in this scenario is that the reference

276

sequence at a particular position causes a mismatch in the seed resulting in inefficient binding of

277

a miRNA, but the variant base at that position creates a perfect binding site. However,

278

considering the complexity of the region, all these probabilities could not be assessed only in

279

terms of miRNAs and hence we set out to probe into the interaction between the host RBP-

280

miRNAs and viral sequence variants in 3’-UTR region in a comprehensive manner.

287

Interaction between RBPs and miRNAs

288

We investigated the interaction in a stepwise manner. The first situation explored was the case

289

where host miRNA miR-34b-5p targets viral RNA and no mutation has been identified in the

290

‘seed’-corresponding region. This means that all the viral sub-types will be vulnerable to

291

degradation by this miRNA, provided it is expressed in host lungs tissue. Careful scanning of the

292

binding site and also looking at the RBP binding information we identified a RBMS3 target

293

sequence actually overlapping with the miR-34b-5p seed corresponding region (Figure 4A).

294

This clearly indicated a prevalent competition between RBMS3 and miR-34b-5p-RISC complex

295

for their respective binding site, with one of them simply presenting a steric hindrance to the

296

other one by blocking the access. This is quite common scenario in regulation of mammalian

297

mRNA stability where the final verdict whether the mRNA is degraded or stabilized largely

298

depends on the spatio-temporal expression or the availability of both the molecules (RBP and

299

miRNA).

300

Second scenario was the variation in position 29774. In this case, we identified that change from

301

‘C’ to ‘A’ disrupted the binding of miR-9-5p to its corresponding target sequence at the ‘seed’
16

302

region (Figure 4B). This is clearly an advantage to the virus as the variation would help it to get

303

rid of the miRNA mediated degradation. As this overlapping region also had a binding site for

304

RBP HNRNPA1, we wanted to find out what happens to HNRNPA1 binding when there is a

305

change from ‘C’ to ‘A’. Interestingly enough, we discovered that HNRNPA1 binding is also not

306

affected, implicating an ensured protection of viral RNA by RBP HNRNPA1, no matter whether

307

miR-9-5p is functional or not. Again, this situation is also quite common in mammalian mRNA

308

regulation where we see some amount of degeneracy among the RBP target sequences, when

309

change of a single nucleotide is often tolerated. The virus uses this phenomenon to its benefit

310

where despite of UTR sequence variation protection from same RBP is ensured.

311

In case of the third incidence, we looked at position 29742, where the ‘G’ to ‘A’ change creates a

312

binding site for miR-3664-5p (Figure 4C), which means that the virus having the variant

313

nucleotide will be prone to degradation by this miRNA. We had already commented about the

314

possible binding of SRSF5 in this region and found that the variation under investigation had no

315

impact on SRSF5 binding. Again, it indicated that despite of creation of miR-3664-5p binding

316

site, the viral RNA is safe until SRSF5 is available to bind and compete with miR-3664-5p-RISC

317

complex. However, as evident from our 3’-UTR analysis, a significant proportion of viral

318

sequence had ‘G’ to ‘T’ change at position 29742. While SRSF5 binding site was still retained,

319

the miR-3664-5p site creation did not take place due to this change.

320

The fourth scenario was found to be very different from what have been mentioned so far. We

321

identified that change of ‘G’ to ‘C’ at position 29734 creates a binding site for miR-4701-3p, but

322

no RBP with a overlapping target sequence could be identified (Figure 4D). This means that

323

there is probably no host factor to protect viral RNA from miR-4701-3p mediated degradation

324

when the virus carries a ‘C’ at position 29734. However, this entirely depends on the expression

325

status of miR-4701-3p in host tissue and there are evidences that suppression of miRNA

326

expression falls under viral strategy to safeguard its genome.

327
328

Validation of our finding by checking expression patterns of key RBPs and miRNAs in host

329

tissue

330

The most important aspect of our study lies in the fact how we could validate our finding. The

331

phenomenon of viral RNA utilizing host stabilizing factors and escaping RNA decay machinery

332

is well-established. But, nothing is known so far for SARS-CoV2. As mentioned before, the

333

actual incident what is taking place after viral infection largely depends on the expression status

334

of the interacting RBPs and miRNAs in particular host tissue. Since, lungs is the primary site of

335

infection for SARS-CoV2, we wanted to find out what is the nature of expression of these

336

molecules in normal lungs tissue. In the first approach we tested their expression in ‘The Protein

337

Atlas’ portal (Figure 5 A, B) and in the second approach we used the TCGA dataset for lung

338

adenocarcinoma (LUAD) from GEPIA and compared the expression of the selected RBPs in

339

adjacent normal lung tissue (Figure 5 C, D). To our excitement, we found a decent to huge

340

expression of all the RBPs in normal lung tissues, clearly indicating their availability to protect

341

viral RNA from host decay machinery. As the viral infection will follow a huge inflammatory

342

condition in the lungs and by the time we know that in severe cases this prolonged inflammation

343

leads to pulmonary fibrosis, we also wanted to check whether there are supporting evidences

344

relating the expression of these RBPs and miRNAs to inflammation or more specific to

345

pulmonary inflammation. As shown in Table 4, almost all the RBPs under investigation were

346

either reported to have induced by inflammation or responsible for fibrosis in lungs or other

347

organ. Expression of some of them was also reported to be modulated by viral infection. This

348

finding supports our hypothesis and indicates that from the stages of early viral infection to

349

severe advanced conditions SARS-CoV2 could utilize the host stabilization factors for its own

350

benefit.

351

Following the same tune, we looked at the miRNAs also in greater details and several interesting

352

observations were noted. Apart from miR-3664-5p, other three miRNAs were detectable in lungs

353

tissue and even were closely associated with pulmonary inflammation. In case of miR-3664-5p

354

also, its involvement in breast cancer tumorigenesis and associated inflammation was quite

355

supportive. Most of these supporting studies mentioned here for both RBPs and miRNAs are

356

actually functional interrogations involving rigorous experimental procedures. Hence, we are

357

quite confident that that our predictions got validated by experimental reports asking the similar

358

type of questions in a similar set up.

Discussion

362

It has been more than six months we are experiencing one of the biggest pandemics of the world.

363

Investigation of the viral subtypes across the globe has identified several variants in the coding

364

region of the viral RNA possibly resulting in key structural or functional changes in spike

365

protein, nucleocapsid proteins or the RNA dependent RNA polymerase of the virus. As

366

compared to the coding region variants, there have not been so many changes identified in the 5’

367

or 3’ untranslated regions of the viral genome. This made us interested about these regions and

368

first we wanted to carry out a systematic exploration of the prevalent changes present in the

369

region using more than 8500 viral sequences isolated from all the continents and explore their

370

significance with respect to host RNA decay machinery as well. Despite of some specific

371

changes concentrated in some specific regions of the world, overall pattern of the 5’ and 3’-UTR

372

variants pinpoint on few predominant ones. The most important of it was at position 241, where

373

we see a clear change of distribution of reference to variant nucleotide from China to South-East

374

Asia to Europe and Americas. This change has also been implicated to higher mortality and/ or

375

infectivity of the virus (15). For the first time, we report the likelihood of TARDBP binding to

376

this region. TARDBP has been known to promote translation and RNA stability and it has also

377

been shown to play important role in viral infection (39, 40). Therefore, promotion of translation

378

of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins by TARDBP fits well with possible selection of ‘T’ base over time

379

and its correlation to infectivity.

380

The other RNA binding proteins identified in the study to be interacting with viral 5’ and 3’-

381

UTR also has reported evidences of functioning as RNA stabilizing factor or facilitator of

382

translation. CUG-BP has been shown to interact with eIF2A (41) and promote translation in

383

selected targets (42). RBMS3 is a very well-characterized RNA stabilizing factor and known to
21

384

increase half-life of target mRNAs as well as increase protein expression in many instances (26).

385

Similarly, HNRNPA1 is also a RBP known for its role in promoting mRNA stability after

386

binding to 3’-UTR specific target sites and as mentioned before, this RBP has been

387

experimentally identified to bind to SARS-CoV 3’-UTR (43, 44). SRSF5, although primarily

388

involved in splicing, has been attributed to functions like maintaining mRNA stability and

389

translation (45, 46).

390

The most significant aspect of this study was to identify miRNA binding site in the viral 3’-UTR

391

and deciphering the cross-talk between RBPs and miRNAs along with the nucleotide variations

392

at specific sites. Our results elaborated five distinct types of such interactions, as summarized in

393

Figure 6. We have seen CUG-BP binding site is retained and TARDBP binding site is created

394

upon change in viral nucleotide sequences at target positions of 5’-UTR, providing a continued

395

stability and translational advantage to the virus (shown in arm:A). On the other hand, there

396

exists multiple possibilities in case of 3’-UTR, where we first see direct competition over access

397

to target sites between RBMS3 and miR-34b-5p (arm:B). Lung inflammation causes induction of

398

miR-34b-5p (34) which could be a step to attenuate viral infection. However, the sustained

399

expression of RBMS3 in lungs tissue probably acts to prevent miR-34b-5p action after binding to

400

the viral RNA at overlapping site.

401

The effect of variation in viral sequence could either disrupt or create miRNA binding site,

402

keeping the RBP binding site intact. This result in non-functional miRNA site in one case

403

(arm:C) and competition between RBP and miRNA in the other (arm: D). Expression of both

404

HNRNPA1 and SRSF5 is high in lungs, further supporting their possible protective effect on viral

405

genome. The incidence described in arm: E is different as it creates a miRNA binding site

406

without an RBP protection. We have seen that expression of miR-4701-3p is less in lungs,

407

provoking the thought that despite having its site created, there might not be enough miRNA to

408

act on the viral RNA at this site.

409

Thereby, we, for the first time, characterized SARS-CoV2 5’ and 3’-UTR sequences for existing

410

variations in these regions prevailing at major countries of infection spread over all the

411

continents. We further identified interactions between host RBPs like CUG-BP, TARDBP,

412

RBMS3, HNRNPA1 and SRSF5 with host miRNAs miR-34b-5p, miR-9-5p, miR-3664-5p and

413

miR-4701-3p and showed how the interactions changed along with sequence variations at

414

specific positions of untranslated regions of viral genome. Our findings elaborate complex

415

relationship between host RNA stabilization/ decay factors and SARS-CoV2 RNA genome

416

highlighting how the virus could manipulate host machinery. The knowledge could also be used

417

to develop antiviral compounds following further experimental studies.
