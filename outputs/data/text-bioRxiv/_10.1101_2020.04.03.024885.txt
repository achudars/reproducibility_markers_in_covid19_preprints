machine learning and supercomputing1

Summary
Rapidly responding to novel pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, represents an extremely
challenging and complex endeavor. Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research
efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an
efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we
have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and
supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor
binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published
neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences
predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and
publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural
modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when
compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in
silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies
(known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2.
Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of -48.1 kcal/mol (± 8.3), our 20 selected first
round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
with free energies as low as -82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with
the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of -52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the
virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results
suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially
neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to
multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and
experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable
feedback to further improve the machine learning–driven designs. This technical report is a
high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based
structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263
mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.
Introduction
Numerous promising therapeutic [1,2] or vaccine [3,4] research efforts are underway for
COVID-19, yet a therapeutic or vaccine is not currently available. Traditional drug and biologic
development are experiment-driven, typically executed via large-scale screening in vitro and in

vivo. While traditional approaches have led to many effective and safe therapeutics, they
require years to complete and therefore cannot alone be relied upon to support a rapid
response to novel pathogens [5-7].
Data-driven (machine learning) methods are increasingly being explored for rapid therapeutic
development [8,9], potentially offering the promise of a very rapid design phase. However, a
purely data-driven machine learning system would be limited in rapid response scenarios due
to the inevitable insufficiency of available data on novel or emerging pathogens. Theory-driven
computational methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations, can provide virtually limitless
amounts of data for target systems, but still require experimental validation.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Vaccines Research
have developed a combined computational-experimental platform for vaccine antigen design
over the last two years. This combined platform combines experiment-driven, data-driven, and
theory-driven approaches to leverage the strength of each approach, while mitigating their
limitations. The initial predictions from this platform are driven by a computational component
based on integrating existing experimental data, structural biology/bioinformatic modeling, and
molecular dynamics simulations on high-performance computing systems. An active machine
learning model aims to optimize binding behavior by iteratively proposing mutations to the
amino acid sequence of an initial antigen. Proposed mutant antigens are evaluated with
existing computational binding estimation tools using known or estimated antibody-antigen
structures. The platform leverages a feature representation of the three-dimensional antigenantibody interface and a Bayesian optimization algorithm to propose computational evaluation
of mutants with high predicted performance and mutants that improve the machine learning
model itself. The computational platform further improves its predictions by proposing designs
that are evaluated with a high throughput experimental evaluation component, the results of
which are incorporated into the machine learning model in a feedback loop. This combined
computational-experimental antigen design platform, and results generated by it, will be
described in greater detail in a future joint publication with GSK, including details of the
machine learning model.
Our approach to designing therapeutic antibodies
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified and used our computational components
of the antigen design platform to propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies to
achieve and optimize binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. This approach is motivated and enabled by knowledge of existing antibodies specific to
the RBD of the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein that prevent SARS-CoV-1 from binding the human
ACE2 receptor and entering the cell, thus neutralizing the virus [10,11]. The high similarity of
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including the RBD [12], suggest that such an approach could
produce efficacious therapeutic antibodies. In 22 days (1/23-2/13/2020), we demonstrated that
our platform could generate antibody designs using only SARS-CoV-2 sequence information,
with support from antibody/antigen structures that had previously been experimentally
determined for SARS-CoV-1. We executed this entire workflow by constructing a homologybased structural model before any experimentally determined structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein were available.

Results
Homology-based structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produces accurate
structural estimates when compared to experimentally derived structures
In the absence of a known SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structure, we characterized the SARS-CoV2 surface glycoprotein sequence YP_009724390.1 [13] by constructing a homology-based
structural model using the AS2TS protein modeling system [14]. The structures of the spike
proteins from SARS-CoV-1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries: 5x58 [15], 6nb6 [10], 2dd8 [11],
and 3bgf [16]) were identified as the closest and most complete PDB structural templates to
use for modeling, with resolutions 3.2, 4.2, 2.3, and 3.0 Å respectively. Of the four templates,
the last three provide experimentally solved complexes with three antibodies, S230, M396, and
F26G19. As our main focus in constructed homology models was to achieve the highest possible
accuracy in the RBD-FAB (antigen-binding fragment) interfaces we used additional PDB
templates to refine models in corresponding regions. For example, PDB template 2ghw [17] was
used to improve accuracy in the modeled interface between RBD and FAB of neutralizing
antibody 80R.
A CryoEM-derived structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein became available on Feb. 19, 2020
and was publicly released Feb 26, 2020 [18] (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6vsb). X-ray
crystal structures (of the receptor-binding domain) became available starting March 4, 2020
FIGURE 1. Bar representation of structural alignments with 6w41_C x-ray structure is used as reference. Four currently

Rapidly generating 20 initial antibody designs for experimental evaluation
Details of our computational-experimental platform will be described in greater detail in a
future publication, including details on the active machine learning model, the feature space
used to represent the three dimensional antigen-antibody interface, and the antibody
optimization pipeline. Overall, to generate the initial 20 antibodies, we executed the following
steps:
1. Obtain structures for which experimentally-determined atomic coordinates were
previously deposited in the PDB for several SARS-CoV-1-neutralizing antibodies in
complex with the SARS-CoV-1 S-protein; obtain sequences from SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.
2. Map public SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences into structures. We estimated 10 costructures involving 3 antibodies. (Completed Jan 23, 2020; made publicly available Feb
3, 2020. We used two of these antibodies (M396 and S230) in our subsequent
calculations.
3. Define a set of residues for modification in each of the starting SARS-CoV-1-neutralizing
antibodies via automatic contact estimation.

deletions at this phase of our work.
4. Use machine learning module of computational design platform to iteratively propose
mutations to the original antibody (M396) and perform free energy calculations using
FoldX [21] on LLNL high-performance computing (HPC) to maximize estimated affinities
to our SARS-CoV-2 spike protein homology model. By Feb 13, 2020, we evaluated
89,263 mutant antibodies selected from a design space of 1040 (20 amino acids31 positions).
The primary template for this structure was PDB 2dd8.
5. Use HPC to perform additional free energy calculations on 110 selected antibody
sequences by performing free energy calculations using Rosetta [22] and 102 antibodies
with molecular dynamics simulations [23]; assess all sequences with the STATIUM
energy prediction tool [24]. (Completed by Feb 13, 2020)
6. Assess the developability of 139 selected antibody sequences using the 5 developability
metrics from the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler [25]. (Completed by Feb 13, 2020)
7. Select diverse batch of 20 M396-derived candidate antibodies for experimental based
on all calculations from steps 4-6. (Completed Feb 13, 2020).
During this 22-day period, we used two high-performance computers located at LLNL to
support over 200,000 CPU hours and 20,000 GPU hours, performing 178,856 in silico free
energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies in complex with the RBD. Given the 31
residues on M396 considered for mutation, the antibody design space has 1040 possibilities.
Supplementary Materials include all sequences and calculations performed for M396. From
these calculations, as well as from additional bioinformatic heuristics described in the Methods
section, we selected 20 initial antibodies for experimental evaluation.
Machine learning–driven computational design platform generates antibodies with improved
predicted binding to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)
We used the machine learning module of our computational design platform to iteratively
propose mutations to the original antibody (M396) and run FoldX [21] calculations on LLNL HPC
to estimate free energies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein homology model. FoldX binding
calculations estimate the change in free energy (ddG) of the antibody-antigen protein complex
resulting from the proposed mutations (to M396). We used this calculation as part of an
objective function to drive the antibody optimization via the machine learning model. We
evaluated 89,263 mutants with FoldX during the course of our search for improved antibodies
with estimated ddG values ranging from -10.1 to 19.2 kcal/mole. Figure 3 plots improvements
in the FoldX-estimated ddG values over the course of the machine learning-driven optimization
process. These results indicate that the machine learning model was effective in searching the
combinatorial space of possible antibody mutants to perform design optimization and identify
increasingly improved predicted antibody designs. We then selected a subset of these antibody
mutants for additional calculations using Rosetta [22], STATIUM [24], and molecular dynamics
calculations [23], as well as antibody developability estimates via the Therapeutic Antibody
Profiler [25] (see Methods section).

Figure 3 Scatter plot illustrating increasingly improved antibody mutants proposed as the machine learning-driven antibody
optimization progresses. A total of 89,263 antibody mutants were proposed by the machine learning model during the course of
the antibody optimization. Each antibody mutant was evaluated with FoldX with two different calculations; first to estimate
energy changes for the entire complex (y-axis) and second for the RBD-FAB interface only (x-axis). The first 4,462 (5% of the
total) antibody mutants proposed by the machine learning model are shown in red. The last 4,462 mutants proposed, shown in
blue, resulted in a distribution of mutants with much lower energies (more favorable FAB-RDB interaction), indicating that the
machine learning model was effective in searching the combinatorial space of possible antibody mutants to identify increasingly
improved predicted antibody designs. Note that FoldX Interface calculations were a major driver of the objective function for
optimization, and therefore show the most improvement.

While all in silico calculations performed were used to select our 20 first round antibodies, the
molecular mechanics/generalized Born solvent accessible surface area (MM/GBSA) molecular
dynamics calculations [23], described in the Methods section, are considered to be our most
accurate estimate. MM/GBSA calculates antibody/antigen interaction free energies using fully
solvated molecular dynamics (MD) for conformational sampling of the protein complex, but
estimates free energy by a computationally less expensive implicit solvent model (GBSA). M396,
our starting template for design, is known to neutralize SARS-CoV-1 by binding its RBD and
preventing the virus from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor; our MM/GBSA
calculations for M396 in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein yield -52.2 kcal/mole
(±7.2). M396 is known not to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [18] and yields -48.1
kcal/mole (± 8.3) in complex with SARS-CoV-2 via MM/GBSA, assuming the same conformation
as with SARS-CoV-1. Our 20 selected antibody designs, which are derived from M396, are
predicted to have improved interaction with the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with
MM/GBSA free energies as low as -82.0 kcal/mole, also assuming the same conformation as

with SARS-CoV-1. These results suggest that these M396-derived antibody mutants potentially
bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
Starting on Jan 23, 2020, we used two high-performance computers at LLNL over the course of
22 days to support over 200,000 CPU hours and 20,000 GPU hours, performing 178,856 in silico
free energy calculations of candidate antibodies in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We
performed this work using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing
antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1. Our predicted structures of SARS-CoV-2 proved to be
accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures
published weeks later. With our predicted SARS-CoV-2 structures, we used our in silico design
platform to evaluate 89,263 mutant antibodies by iteratively proposing mutations to SARS-CoV1 neutralizing antibodies to optimize binding within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We selected 20 initial
antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Starting from a baseline free
energy of -48.1 kcal/mol (± 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to
have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies ranging as low as -82.0
kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a
calculated free energy of -52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding
and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody
mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and therefore potentially neutralize the virus.
Additionally, our antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability
metrics via the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler.
These 20 antibody designs are now being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the
machine learning–driven designs. We are also continually improving our platform and
performing additional in silico calculations, which will be included in future updates to this
document. In addition, we are currently (1) performing higher fidelity molecular dynamics
calculations to increase the accuracy of predictions using [26, 27], (2) investigating binding
“hotspots” via single point mutation computational analysis, and (3) exploring any potential
impacts from glycosylation at the RBD site.
The Supplementary Materials to this document include (1) the 10 homology-based structural
models we developed of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies and
(2) all antibody mutant sequences and in silico free energy calculations performed for 89,263
mutant antibodies derived from the M396 SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibody, which we used to
select a first round of 20 candidate antibodies for experimental evaluation.

Methods
Homology-based structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein structure as a starting point for antibody
design
In the absence of a known SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
structure, we characterized the surface glycoprotein
sequence YP_009724390.1 [13] by constructing a
homology-based structural model using the AS2TS system
[14] and SARS-CoV-1. To assess regions of sequencestructure conservation or variability between SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2 (sequence similarity=71%), we created a
set of initial structural models using available templates.
The comparative analysis between constructed models and
all available templates from PDB was performed using the
StralSV algorithm [28], which identifies protein fragments
that exhibit structural similarities despite low primary
amino acid sequence similarity and regions where some
structure conformation uncertainties can be observed. We
used results from these searches for modeling missing
loop regions and assessment of possible structure
conformation diversity in preliminary models.

SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in complex with antiSARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibody S230
fragment: template PDB 6NB6.

In the constructed final models, the conformation of sidechain atoms was predicted using SCWRL [29] when
residue-residue correspondences did not match. Residues
that were identical between the template and the SARSCoV-2 spike protein were copied from the templates onto
the models. The structural and stereochemical quality of
the models was checked using a contact-dot algorithm in
the MolProbity software package [30], and the final
constructed models were finished with relaxation using
UCSF Chimera [31]. Figures 4 and 5 show two of our
constructed structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein in complex with a FAB (S230 and M396 in Figs. 3
and 4, respectively) of a SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibody.
A set of all provided models was constructed to help
assessment of possible different conformations in the
spike-antibody complexes.
Binding calculations with FoldX
For our ddG FoldX calculations of 89,263 mutant
antibodies in complex with the RBD, we started with
structure minimization using the "minimize structure"

the "RepairPDB" function in FoldX. We performed ddG calculations on the defined list of
mutations using the "BuildMODEL" procedure, which estimates stability (dg) defined by the free
energy of a protein. We used up to 46 runs in this procedure to check if calculated rotamers of
specified mutations converged to the optimal or trapped solution. A first set of our ddG
estimates was calculated as a difference in free energy (dg) between the mutant and wild-type
(labeled “FoldX ddG Average” in Supplementary Materials). Additional ddG estimates were
calculated using the "AnalyseComplex" algorithm for which we used the wild-type and mutated
models to calculate ddG based on energy changes in interface only within RBD-FAB complexes
(labeled “FoldX ddG Interface” in Supplementary Materials).
Binding calculations with Rosetta
To estimate ddG values using Rosetta, we started from structure minimization using the "relax"
procedure. For each S protein-FAB complex model, we made 10 relaxed structures from which
we chose the representative model with the lowest free energy. In these structures, we
calculated ddG estimates as change of stability using the "ddg_monomer" algorithm with 50
iterations and settings as described in [32] (labeled “Rosetta ddG Total Energy” in
Supplementary Materials). Additional ddG estimates were calculated using the "Flex_ddG"
protocol [33], which evaluates energy changes by focusing on interfaces within RBD-FAB
complexes only (labeled “Rosetta ddG Flex” in Supplementary Materials). In addition, Rosetta
calculations (Total Energy and Flex) were performed for all possible single-point mutations for
each of the 31 locations selected for mutation (19 amino acid mutation possibilities *31
locations = 589 total Rosetta single-point mutation calculations).
Binding calculations with molecular dynamics
We used molecular mechanics/generalized Born solvent accessible surface area (MM/GBSA)
calculations for antibody/antigen interaction free energies [19]. MM/GBSA uses fully solvated
molecular dynamics for conformational sampling of the protein complex but estimates free
energy by a computationally cheaper implicit solvent model (GBSA). All molecular dynamics
simulations were performed with OpenMM [34], a toolkit for molecular simulation, using the
AMBER force field [35]. Positional constraints (1 kcal/mole*Å2) were place on the backbone
atoms (C, N, and CA) during heating of the system. The system was heated in 50 K increments
for 100 ps at each temperature. Once the system was at 310 K, all constraints were removed
and equilibration was performed for 9 ns. Ten individual 5 ns dynamics simulations were
performed from the equilibrated system for conformational sampling. The last 1 ns of the
dynamics in 50 ps increments from each of the simulations was used for the MM/GBSA
calculation (200 total structures). The MM/GBSA calculations were performed using
MMPBSA.py that is part of the AMBER suite of programs.
Other decision-informing criteria
As a bioinformatic heuristic, we computed the number of mutations that are considered to be
“unlikely” (labeled “number of unconventional mutations” in the dataset provided in the
Supplementary Materials) for each mutant antibody considered. This heuristic describes
mutations that are low probability under a mutational probability distribution derived from the

Blosum62 substitution matrix [36]. This mutational probability distribution gives some
substitutions higher probabilities (e.g., A->S; 0.1168) and some lower (e.g., A->W; 0.00594),
where the total of the probabilities of the 19 “destination” amino acids is 1.0. If a given point
mutation is given a probability of < 0.052 (i.e., less than 1/19th) the mutation is declared
“unconventional” and this count is incremented by one. For example, for Alanine (A), 11 of 19
mutations are “unconventional” with this heuristic.
