ABSTRACT
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns the use of one-way valves or vents
in free masks for potential threat of spreading COVID-19 through expelled respiratory
droplets. Here, we have developed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with non-toxic
zinc oxide nanomaterial for potential use as membrane filter in the one way valve for the ease
of breathing without the threat of COVID-19 spreading. A detailed computational study
revealed that zinc oxide nanoflowers (ZnO NF) with almost two-dimensional petals trap
SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, responsible to attach to ACE-2 receptors in human lung
epithelial cells. The study also confirm significant denaturation of the spike proteins on the
ZnO surface, revealing removal of virus upon efficient trapping. Following the computational
study, we have synthesized ZnO NF on cotton matrix using hydrothermal assisted strategy.
Electron microscopic, steady-state and picosecond resolved spectroscopic studies confirm
attachment of ZnO NF to the cotton (i.e., cellulose) matrix at atomic level to develop the
nanoceutical fabric. A detailed antimicrobial assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria
(model SARS-CoV-2 mimic) reveals excellent anti-microbial efficiency of the developed
nanoceutical fabric. To our understanding the novel nanoceutical fabric used in one-way
valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure breathing comfort along with source control
of COVID-19 infection. The developed nanosensitized cloth can also be used as
antibacterial/anti CoV-2 washable dress material in general.

INTRODUCTION
The emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has imposed a global socioeconomic burden, particularly to public and private healthcare system due to unprecedented
morbidity, mortality and economic disruption [1]. At the time of writing, over 81.27 million
patients have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, with over 1.77 million deaths worldwide [2].
Recently, some of the vaccine candidates have received conditional approval from various
authorities around the world despite numerous issues like dose, interval between two shots
etc. Even after that, it will take several months to reach the common people due to challenges
like regulatory issues, large-scale production and mass distribution to the public [3].
Therefore, the sole line of defence recommended by almost all the apex medical bodies
throughout the world is ‘non-pharmacological interventions’ like the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., face mask, face shield, gloves etc.), and personal hygiene
(e.g., handwashing, cough and sneeze etiquette) [4-6]. As the world is ready to reopen, and
most of the countries are waiting for a second or third wave of virus outbreak, the PPEs
particularly face masks are becoming an integral part of day-to-day life. Although, face masks
are commonly used to provide protection to the wearer (e.g., first responders), they were
originally introduced to protect surrounding persons [7]. Generally, the term ‘face mask’
covers a broad range of PPEs that reduce the transmission of respiratory particles or droplets
[7].
Recently, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned against the use of oneway valves or vents in face masks for potential threat of spreading COVID-19 through
expelled respiratory droplets [8]. However, the face masks without valves or vents can cause
several health problems and severe discomfort to the wearer [9-11]. Some evidences suggest
that commonly available N95 face masks can lead to changes in blood oxygen (O2) and carbon
dioxide (CO2) levels when used for long periods, especially by people who are elderly, obese
or have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [10-14]. Other adverse health effects
range from increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, chest pain, and hypercapnia [1519]. One of the feasible solution to this problem is by covering the valve or vent with a porous
filter that can either trap or kill the microorganisms including viruses, alongside allow the air
to flow across. Unfortunately, no study has been performed till date to design such filters or
to address the problem by other means. In this regard, filters made up of natural fabrics (e.g.,
cotton) functionalized with antimicrobial agents could be an effective solution.
Although, a vast diversity of organic compounds with recognized antimicrobial activity have
been incorporated into polymers in order to develop antimicrobial fibers, they exhibit several
drawbacks related to their thermal and chemical instability, which could lead to difficulties
throughout the functionalization process and also produce fibrous mats with limited
antimicrobial activity due to partial decomposition of the antimicrobial agent [20]. Moreover,
the massive use of antibiotics has led to another global problem, the origination of antibiotic
resistance bacteria [21-24]. Thus, there is a growing need to explore novel antimicrobial agents
to functionalize the natural or synthetic fabrics not only to prevent COVID-19 spread, but
[4]

also for other applications like clothing materials for patients to stop hospital acquired
infections, which is also a global challenge.
Consequently, nanoscale materials with unique and tuneable physico-chemical properties
(i.e., higher chemical, mechanical and thermal stability) are interesting elements for
preparation of hygienic surfaces. For example, silver ions and silver-based nano-compounds
are highly toxic to microorganism showing strong biocidal effect various species of bacteria
[25-27]. Gold nanoparticles [28, 29], bimetallic nanomaterials (e.g., Ag/Au, Ag/Pt etc.) [30,
31], graphene based materials [32] and metal oxide nanoparticles (e.g., titanium dioxide
(TiO2), copper oxide (CuO), silica (SiO2) etc.) [33-35] are other examples. However, they all
suffer from the problem of inherent toxicity of the nanomaterials limiting their human use
[36-40]. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to design a nanoparticle functionalized fabric
(i.e., nanoceutical fabric) that can efficiently kill or trap microorganisms without any harmful
side effect to the user.
In this study, we have rationally designed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with
non-toxic zinc oxide (ZnO) nanomaterial for potential use as membrane filter in the one-way
valve or vent of face mask for the ease of breathing without the risk of COVID-19 spread. A
comprehensive computer assisted simulation study revealed the unique potential of ZnO
nanoflowers (ZnO NF) having nearly two-dimensional nanopetals in entrapment and
denaturation of coronavirus spike protein (resulting into eradication of the virus), which
mediates the viral pathogenesis through attachment to angiotensin converting enzyme-2
(ACE-2) receptors in human respiratory tract. Subsequently, we have synthesized ZnO NF
on natural cotton fiber matrix using a one pot hydrothermal assisted approach. In depth
electron-microscopic, steady-state and picosecond resolved spectroscopic studies confirm the
attachment of ZnO NF to the cellulose matrix of the cotton at atomic level to develop the
nanoceutical fabric filter. An exhaustive antimicrobial study using capsule containing virulent
Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a mimic of coronavirus (as the lectins in P. aeruginosa shares similar
homology to coronavirus spike protein) reveals excellent anti-microbial (bactericidal)
efficiency of the developed nanoceutical fabric filter. To our understanding, the novel
nanoceutical fabric used in one-way valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure
breathing comfort along with source control of COVID-19 infection. The developed
nanosensitized cloth can further be used as antibacterial (as well as anti SARS CoV-2) dress
material in general to stop hospital acquired infections.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Prediction of the potential antiviral nanostructure and model experimental organism.
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1a) generally initiates its infection process by binding to functional
receptors on the membrane of a host cell [41]. In case of humans, membrane bound ACE-2
(the functional host receptor) plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of COVID-19 providing viral
entry to human cells (Figure 1b, 1c) [42, 43]. The spike (S) protein present in the outer surface
of SARS‐CoV‐2 binds to human ACE-2 with a very strong affinity, and subsequently
mediates membrane fusion leading to host cell entry of the virus (Figure 1c) [42, 44, 45].
Computed binding energy for human ACE-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein from the crystal
structure (PDB ID: 6lzg; Figure 1d) of the complex was found to be -20.28 kcal mol-1.
Following minimization of the complex under OPLS (Optimized Potentials for Liquid
Simulations) [46] force field, the binding energy drops to -29.83 kcal mol-1. This strong binding
energy can be attributed to the large surface area at the protein-protein interface and several
favourable intermolecular interactions including hydrogen bonding, ionic and hydrophobic
interactions. Hence, it is difficult to develop small molecule competitive inhibitors that can
disrupt such an elaborate molecular recognition. Therefore, we looked into the prospective
nanomaterials having similar magnitude as ACE-2 protein along with the ability to compete
for the viral S-protein binding. In this regard, our primary choice was ZnO considering its
biocompatibility and known antimicrobial and antiviral effect [47-53]. In a computer
simulation, spherical ZnO nanoparticle (~30 nm diameter, similar dimension of ACE-2) was
constructed and its interaction with the viral S-protein was studied (Figure 1e). The spherical
nanoparticle provided a convex surface for interaction similar to the ACE-2 receptor protein.
Since, the geometry of the nanosurface at the binding region is known to affect the proteinnanomaterial interaction [54, 55], we further simulated the interaction of S-protein with the
flat sheet-like ZnO surface having various exposed crystal facets (<100>, <101> and <002>)
as observed in X-Ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (vide infra).
As evident from molecular docking study, the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein can bind favorably with
both the ZnO nanosphere as well as on the flat facets (<100>, <101> and <002>) of ZnO
nanostructure with binding energies: -17, -11, -21 and -16 kcal mol-1, respectively. Binding on
<101> ZnO nanosurface was very much comparable with that of ACE-2. After the energy
minimization of the docked complexes, the binding energies were found to be -21, -13, -40
and -22 kcal mol-1, respectively. Figure 1e-1i shows the bound conformations of spike protein
with the ZnO nanosphere and various facets on ZnO nanosurfaces. Interestingly, when
structural deviations (in terms of root mean square deviation, RMSD) were studied and
compared between the docked and the energy minimized conformations of the spike RBD
(Figure 1j), large structural perturbations become evident in the binding regions of SARSCoV-2 S-protein due to binding on ZnO nanofacets. Least change was observed in case of
nanosphere, whereas most change occurred on <101> facet of ZnO. Since, structure and
function of proteins are highly correlated, infliction of a large structural perturbation in
protein structure by an inhibitor, or ligand is generally associated with its loss of function [46].

The observed in silico structural changes, therefore, indicate that the viral S-protein may lose
its pathological function if it comes in contact with ZnO nanosurface.
Bearing in mind the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 as well as
unavailability of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and biosafety requirements for experimental studies,
we looked for similar organisms as an alternative model preferably of bacterial origin having
adhesion proteins analogous to viral S-protein. Lectin-A (LecA) protein of P. aeruginosa
(Figure 2a) was found to show high degree of similarity in the binding site residues as evident
from the amino acid sequence alignment depicted in Figure 2a-2e. In the largest 32 amino
acid overlap region (14-45:149-180), the two proteins showed 28.1% identity, and 62.5%
similarity with Waterman-Eggert score of 52. Detailed sequence alignments of the Spike RBD
and LecA protein are given in supporting information. Apart from the structural similarity,
LecA resembles the function of viral S-protein, and mediates bacterium-host cell recognition
and adhesion which are the critical steps in initiating P. aeruginosa pathogenesis [56].
Interestingly for both SARS-CoV-2 and P. aeruginosa, lungs are the primary target organs, and
both of them cause similar acute and chronic lung infection [56-58]. Therefore, considering
the structural and functional resemblances in a possible example of molecular mimicry, P.
aeruginosa LecA was chosen as an alternative to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein for subsequent
computational and experimental binding studies with the ZnO nano structures.
Molecular docking study illustrates that the P. aeruginosa LecA protein can bind favorably
with the ZnO <100>, <101> and <002> nanofacets as well as on the ZnO nanosphere with
comparable binding energies: -9, -11, -12 and -11 kcal mol-1, respectively. After the energy
minimization of the docked complexes, the binding energies were found to be -11, -14, -26,
and -17 kcal mol-1, respectively. Figure 2c-2f shows the bound conformations of LecA protein
with the ZnO nanosphere and nanofacets, respectively. Structural deviations in terms of
RMSDs were studied and compared between the docked and the minimized complexes and
graphically represented in Figure 2g. It is evident from Figure 2g that large structural
perturbation, similar to the viral S-protein, takes place in the binding regions of LecA protein
on the ZnO nanofacets.
Thus, the computational binding study shows that ZnO nano surface can trap the adhesion
proteins of SARS-Cov-2 as well as that of the P. aeruginosa. The sheet-like flat ZnO
nanostructures not only binds these adhesion proteins (i.e., viral S-protein and LecA), but also
impart large scale structural perturbation in the bound protein (i.e., denaturation) leading to
functional impairment and disinfectant effect. Therefore, based on the computational findings
P. aeruginosa (having LecA) was chosen as model SARS-CoV-2 mimic, and ZnO sheet-like
nanostructure was selected as anti-microbial agent for subsequent experimental validation.
Designing of natural cotton fabric functionalized with ZnO nanoflower featuring flat
sheet-like petals.
Encouraged by the in silico studies, we intended to decorate the natural cotton fabric with flat
ZnO sheet like structures, which eventually self-assembled into more complex rose-like ZnO
nanoflower during hydrothermal-assisted low-temperature one pot synthesis process (detailed

in ‘Methods’ section). The scanning electron micrographs (SEM) confirm the formation of
flower like morphology of ZnO on the surface of the cotton fiber (Figure 3a-3d). Figure 3e-3g
shows the SEM of the bare cloth. The flat sheet like petals of the flower have a length of ~600850 nm, and a diameter of ~150-300 nm with an aspect ratio of ~3 (schematically represented
in Figure 3h). It should be noted that the surface of the petals is not smooth, rather coated
with small granules of nanoparticles. The EDAX analysis confirms presence of ZnO in the
nanostructure (data not shown). TG-DTA analysis shows ~9% (w/w) loading of ZnO NF to
cellulose fibers (Supplementary Figure S1).
At the outset, we investigated the growth of ZnO phase on the cotton clothes using X-ray
diffraction (XRD) technique. With 5 hrs of intermediate growth time, the ZnO phase is not
distinguishable properly as the prominent XRD peaks are suppressed by the broad hump of
cellulose within the Bragg angle (2) range between 31º and 38º in Figure 4a. Nevertheless,
the signature of (1 0 1) plane of ZnO at ~36.2º can be traced from the XRD pattern. The
growth of ZnO becomes quite dominant when the growth time is increased to 15 hrs. In this
case, the diffraction peaks appearing at 2 of 31.8, 34.4, 36.1, 47.4, 56.6, 63.0, 68.0,
and 69.2 represent the (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (1 1 2), and (2 0 1) planes
of ZnO nanocrystals, respectively. The observed peaks are in good agreement with those for
hexagonal closed-packed ZnO having wurtzite structure (lattice constants a=3.249, c=5.206
Å; space group P63mc (186)) as reported earlier (JCPDS 36-1451) [59]. Sharp diffraction peaks
indicate good crystalline quality of the synthesized nanoflowers, and the absence of any
additional peak directs towards the high purity of the material. The highly intensified peak at
36.1º indicates the dominance of (1 0 1) plane in the material.
The TEM image (Figure 4b) shows the size of a single ZnO NF petal to be ~600 × 300 nm.
The HRTEM image taken at the centre of the petal indicates the presence of (101) plane
(Figure 4c). The presence of distinct bright spots in the SAED pattern (Figure 4d) corresponds
to the crystalline nature of the petals. Fast Furier transformation (FFT) shows that the
crystallite is dominated by (1 0 1) plane of ZnO, with an lattice fringe spacing of 0.25 nm
(Figure 4e & 4f). Further, as shown in Figure 5a, the formation of nanorod like morphology
can be observed when the reaction time is reduced (i.e., 5 hrs.). The surface of the nanorods
appears to be rough and can be originated from the presence of large number of crystallites.
The SAED pattern shows small spots within diffused ring and reveals the polycrystallinity of
the nanorods as each spot arises from the Bragg reflection from individual crystallites (Figure
5a-inset). The rings can be indexed as (101), (102) and (200) of wurtzite phase of ZnO, which
exactly correlates with the XRD pattern (Figure 4a). Next the close look of the nanorod at
different locations (marked as c, d in Figure 5b) reveal the presence of (101) and (002) planes
of ZnO with interplanar spacing ~ 0.25 and 0.26 nm respectively (Figure 5c-5g). The
exhibition of polycrystalline nature of the nanorods with various crystallites is different from
nanorods grown on crystalline surfaces (e.g. Si). Thus it can be anticipated that the use of
cotton substrate in the synthesis process play a big role in forming nanorods with exposed
crystallites on the surface (Figure 6). In fact, the functional groups present in the cellulose
fibres act as nucleation sites for the growth of nanorods (Step 1 in Figure 5). It can be noted
[8]

that in HMT based hydrothermal synthesis, Zn(OH)2 acts as the nucleation agent according
to the following equations [60]:
C6H12N4 + 4H2O →C6H12N4H4+ +4OH[Zn(C6H12N4)]2+ + 4OH → Zn(OH)42+ + C6H12N4
Zn(OH)42→ Zn2+ + 4OH
Zn2+ + 2OH →ZnO + H2O
Or, Zn2+ + 2OH → Zn(OH)2 →ZnO + H2O
In the present investigation, the abundant and random distribution of these functional groups
based nucleation sites on the cellulose fibre surface provides a continuous platform for ZnO
growth along the direction of fibres (Step 1 in Figure 6). As the nucleation and subsequent
growth process occurs on the outer circumference of the cellulose fibres, the fibre plays the
role of template to form nanorod like one dimensional structure (Step 2 in Figure 6). Now the
random distribution of the functional groups leads to the randomly oriented nucleation sites
and consequently the growth is evident to be different in different directions. The observation
of the rough surface with different crystallites of (101) and (002) planes, is the consequence of
such growth process.
Now it is well established that in ZnO crystals the surface energy (per mole) varies with
direction as γ[0001]˂ γ[11-20] ˂ γ[10-10] [61]. Hence, the growth of (002) plane along [0001] direction
is highly favourable from thermodynamic point of view. Thus, the nanorods with exposed
(002) planes offer chances for further growth. As a result, with increased reaction time, the
nanorods suffer two dimensional growth i.e. along horizontal as well as vertical directions to
the surface of the fibre leading to the development of petal like feature (Step 4 in Figure 6).
To ensure this fact, TEM analysis has been performed on four different edges of the fully
grown petal. In none of these areas, any signature of (002) plane has been found. It is wellknown that a plane with higher growth rate disappears quickly [62]. Thus the disappearance
of (002) plane confirms the speculated lateral growth of the nanorods to form the petals.
Subsequent self-assembly of such petal like features leads to the formation of flower like
morphology of ZnO at higher reaction time (Step 5 in Figure 6).
Figure 7a shows the absorbance spectrum recorded from bare cotton cloths and ZnO NF
decorated cotton cloths. As the constituent of cotton fiber is cellulose, the observed absorption
bands at 200–220 and 270–290 nm could be assigned to oxidized xylans and monocarboxyl
celluloses due to presence of carboxyl and carbonyl groups, respectively [63]. Furthermore,
the absorption bands at 230–250 and 290–320 nm could be assigned to heteroaromatics of the
furan and pyron type, and the low intensity absorption shoulder above 300 nm to conjugated
heteroaromatics [63]. Functionalization with ZnO NF lead to the appearance of characteristic
ZnO absorption edge at 365 nm which is blue shifted by 8 nm relative to the bulk exciton
absorption (373 nm) [64]. Correspondingly, the ZnO NF exhibited a slightly higher optical
energy gap (Eg) of 3.44 eV with respect to bulk ZnO (3.37 eV) (Figure 7a-inset). The slight
[9]

change in the absorption edge and Eg can be well explained by the oriented attachment of
multiple ZnO nanorods in flower like morphology [64, 65].
The fluorescence emission spectra of cotton cloth in the solid state (Figure 7b) shows an
intense peak around 430 nm and a broad shoulder ranging from 470-560 nm when excited at
375 nm. The observed emission pattern of cotton cloth exactly matches to the previously
reported photoluminescence characteristics of cellulose fibers [63, 66]. Gavrilov and
Ermolenko (1966) [67] who studied photoluminescence of cellulose in great details, have
suggested that the broad emission band of cellulose originates from three different types of
excitation centers. Presence of multiple excitation maxima (i.e., 265 nm, 350 nm, and 390
nm) in the excitation spectra of bare cotton cloth (Figure 7b-inset) further supports their
findings. Functionalization with ZnO NF significantly quenched the emission of cellulose
constituent (Figure 7b), which indicates possible interaction between ZnO NF and cellulose
fibers. The observed increase in the em 410 nm/em 450 nm ratio could be due to a possible
interaction between Zn-vacancy state of ZnO NF and the OH groups of cellulose fibers
(O=C–O–Zn), as previous studies suggests that the presence of carboxylic groups in the
anhydroglucose units shifts the emission maxima of cellulose to shorter wavelength (blueshift) [63, 66, 68]. A detailed computational study (i.e., molecular docking) further supports
the strong binding of ZnO NF with the cellulose fiber, mostly through hydrogen bonding. The
calculated binding energies per unit area of cellulose fiber with different facets of ZnO
nanostructure were found to be -21 kcal mol-1 nm-2 (sphere), -43 kcal mol-1 nm-2 ((002) facet),
-41 kcal mol-1 nm-2 ((100) and (110) facet), and -39 kcal mol-1 nm-2 ((101) facet) (Supplementary
Figure S2). The highly negative binding energies indicate stronger attachment between the
cellulose fiber and ZnO NF.
To get further insight of the quenching mechanism, we studied excited state fluorescence
lifetime of cellulose (i.e. cotton cloth) and ZnO NF decorated cellulose. Interestingly, the
fluorescence lifetime of both the samples remained unchanged at 450 nm (ex 375 nm) (Figure
7c), while a decrease was observed at 550 nm (ex 375 nm) upon ZnO NF decoration (Figure
7d). This could well be interpreted by the existence of several luminescent centers (originated
from the presence of conjugated chromophores of various origins) in the cellulose [67]. One
possible mechanism behind the observed decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of ZnO NF
decorated cellulose could be due to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the LUMO
level of the low energy excitation centers (near red end) of cellulose to the conduction band
of ZnO, resulting in the luminescence quenching of cellulose [69]. Presence of a very fast
component (i.e., 25 ps) in the excited state lifetime decay of ZnO NF decorated cellulose
further supports our conjecture. In contrast, due to the mismatch in the energy levels, the high
energy excitation centers (near blue end) of cellulose cannot undergo such electron or energy
transfers. The quenching in this region is static in nature and may be originated due to ground
state interaction between ZnO NF and cellulose which we explained in the earlier section. In
summary, the results of our optical studies confirms the attachment of ZnO NF to the
cellulose fibers of the cotton cloth.

Antimicrobial activity of ZnO NF functionalized cotton fabric
The antimicrobial activity of the ZnO NF decorated cotton fabric was evaluated against the
SARS-CoV-2 mimic pathogenic capsule containing (having LecA, the mimic of viral spike
protein; vide computational studies in the earlier section) gram negative model bacteria P.
aeruginosa. To directly assess the antimicrobial effect, after 1 hr of incubation (in dark, 37ºC)
over the ZnO NF decorated cotton cloth and bare cotton cloth, the P. aeruginosa was
transferred and cultured on a Luria–Bertani (LB) agar media (i.e., the plate count assay) for
12 hrs (at 37ºC). The original bacterial inoculum, which was employed over the fabrics for
initial incubation served as control. As shown in the photographs of the agar plates after 12
hrs (Figure 8a), a clear killing activity was observed in case of ZnO NF functionalized cotton
fabric resulting into very few colonies. Colony count shows (Figure 8b) that in ZnO NF
functionalized cotton fabric the bacterial growth was ~79% lower compared to control
(P<0.0001; F (2,15)=303.2, one-way ANOVA) and ~54% lower compared to bare cotton
fabric (P<0.0001; F (2,15)=303.2, one-way ANOVA).
Further, the antibacterial effect of ZnO NF decorated cotton cloth on the P. aeruginosa growth
kinetics was evaluated in liquid LB media. The bacterial growth was monitored by the
measurement of the optical density at 600 nm (OD600), as a reflection of the bacterial
concentration in the culture. After 1 hr of incubation over respective fabrics (inoculation at
1 × 106 CFU/mL), we started monitoring the growth kinetics. The original bacterial
inoculum, which was employed over the fabrics for initial incubation served as control. Figure
8c, clearly indicates that ZnO NF decorated cotton cloth caused complete inhibition of growth
and this was even continued for 14 hrs. The bare cotton cloth also showed a weaker growth
inhibition. The growth rate was ~10 times lower in case of ZnO NF functionalized cotton
fabric compared to both control (P<0.0001; F (2,15)=1062, one-way ANOVA) and bare
cotton fabric (P<0.0001; F (2,15)=1062, one-way ANOVA) (Figure 8c-inset).
Our computational studies have suggested that ZnO NF can simultaneously bind and
denature P. aeruginosa LecA (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mimic), resulting into disruption of
bacterial cell membrane, which eventually is responsible for the observed antimicrobial assay.
In order to confirm that ZnO NF disrupt the bacterial membrane, P. aeruginosa cells were
treated with PI after incubation with ZnO NF decorated cotton fabric. In is worth mentioning
here that PI is a small-molecule dye that upon binding to double-stranded DNA fluoresces
red upon excitation, and it cannot cross an intact cytoplasmic membrane [70, 71]. We
expected that ZnO NF-induced membrane disruption would lead to an increase in nucleic
acid staining by PI compared to that of control or bare cotton cloth treated ones. As shown
in Figure 8d & 8e, control bacteria, as well as bacteria incubated with bare cotton fabric
remained unstained to PI. In comparison, intracellular PI staining was clearly visible in
cultures exposed to ZnO NF decorated cotton fabric (Figure 8f). We further evaluated the
number of viable cells using differential staining with DAPI and PI. As discusses earlier, the
PI generally stains the membrane disrupted cells whereas, DAPI stains all nuclear material
irrespective of their viability. The differentially stained images of control and cotton fabric
inoculated bacteria shows more number of viable cells than dead cells (ratio ~1.2) (Figure 8g).

In contrast, the number of living cells were significantly reduced in case of ZnO NF
functionalized cotton fabric (~0.45) (Figure 8g).
Thus, our antimicrobial studies experimentally provide evidence that ZnO NF can induce
membrane damage, resulting into a loss of membrane potential leading to inhibition of PI
staining. It further depicts that ZnO NF is an effective anti-microbial agent particularly against
SARS-CoV-2 mimicking microorganisms.
Washability and reusability of the ZnO NF functionalized cotton fabric
For regular use as antimicrobial hospital dress material (or, PPE), washability and reusability
of the fabric are the two major factors. To address this issue, we have washed the fabric
material with a mild detergent, as well as with a harsh detergent in tap water. Even after 50
washes with mild, and 10 washes with harsh detergent, the ZnO NF coating of the cotton
fibers remained almost intact as observed under SEM (Supplementary Figure S3). The
antibacterial activity was also sustained in both the cases as compared to the original ZnO NF
functionalized fabric (Supplementary Figure S4). Therefore, the ZnO NF functionalized
cotton fabric was found to be highly reusable with sufficient washability.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we successfully functionalized the commonly available cotton fabrics with
ZnO nanoflowers (ZnO NF). The ZnO NF functionalized cotton fabrics showed significant
antimicrobial activities against SARS-Cov-2 mimic model pathogenic microorganism as
depicted in our detailed antimicrobial assays. The ZnO NFs were able to destroy both
microbial membrane leading to inhibition of infection. A detailed computational study along
with in vitro studies using viral spike protein mimicking protein and bacteria showed the
trapping ability of the fabric. As a proof of concept, we designed a laboratory grade prototype
respirator for using in common N95 masks using the ZnO NF functionalized cotton fabrics.
The porous respirator helped to solve the problem of CO 2 rebreathing and prevented spread
of microbes through the pores. The ZnO NF functionalized cotton fabrics can further be used
to design comfortable, washable anti-microbial PPE, which is an urgent need of today.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of ZnO NF functionalized cotton cloth
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2, 6H2O; Sigma-Aldrich), hexamethylenetetramine
(C6H12N4; Aldrich) were used as the starting materials for a low temperature hydrothermal
synthesis of ZnO NFs on cotton fiber matrix.
For synthesis of ZnO functionalized cotton cloth, at first, seed layer ZnO nanoparticles of ~5
nm in size were prepared in ethanol. In a typical synthesis process, to a 2 mM zinc acetate
(Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O; 20 mL in ethanol) solution heated at 55C, 4 mM sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) solution (20 mL ethanol) was dropwise added under continuous stirring condition.
The glass beaker was then covered tightly with aluminum foil and heated at 65°C for 2 hours
with continuous stirring. After 2 h, the resultant transparent ZnO nanoparticle colloidal
solution (seeding material) was allowed to cool down to room temperature and stored in a
refrigerator for further use.
For seeding of the 5 nm ZnO particles on the cotton cloth, the cloths (3 cm x 3 cm) were
dipped into the seeding solution for 10 mins, and then dried into a hot oven operating at 95°C
for 10 mins. The procedure was repeated for 11 times. Then the cloth was transferred to
autoclave vessel. An aqueous solution of zinc nitrate (20 mM) and hexamethylenetetramine
(20 mM) was used as the precursor solution for the ZnO NF growth, which was carried out
at 102 °C for 15 hrs. This led to the growth of ZnO NFs with a length of ~600-850 nm, and a
diameter of ~150-300 nm. To maintain a constant growth rate of the ZnO NFs during the
hydrothermal process, the old precursor solution was replaced with a fresh solution every 5
h. The as-obtained ZnO NF samples were then taken out of the reaction vessel and rinsed
thoroughly with DI water to remove unreacted residues. Finally, the samples were annealed
in air at ~110 °C for 3 h prior to the study.
Characterization methods
Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM, QUANTA FEG 250) was used to
investigate the surface morphology of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
was carried out using an FEI (Technai S-Twin) instrument with acceleration voltage of
200 kV. A drop of sample (obtained by scratching the ZnO NF decorated cotton cloth) was
placed on a carbon-coated copper grid and particle sizes were determined from micrographs
recorded at a high magnification of 100000X. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to
characterize crystal phase by a PANalytical XPERTPRO diffractometer equipped with Cu
Kα radiation (at 40 mA and 40 kV) at a scanning rate of 0.02° S−1 in the 2θ range from 20° to
80°. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of PDPB, PDPB-ZnO and ZnO solid powder was
performed under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C-min from 30 °C to 600 °C
by using a Perkin-Elmer TGA-50H. For optical experiments, the steady-state absorption and
emission were recorded with a JASCO V-750 spectrophotometer and a JASCO FP-8200

fluorimeter, respectively. Picosecond-resolved spectroscopic studies were carried out using a
commercial time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) setup from Edinburgh
Instruments (instrument response function, IRF = 82 ps, excitation at 375 nm). The details of
experimental set up and methodology were described in our earlier report [72]. The average

Computational study
Binding study: The optimized orthorhombic ZnO wurtzite unit cell (a=5.63, b=3.25, c=5.21)
with 8 atoms was taken to build a large supercell. For binding calculations on the <002>,
<100>, and <101> facets, slabs of atoms with the exposed <002>, <100>, and <101> phases,
respectively, were cut out of the bulk (supercell). For the calculation with a nanosphere, a
sphere or radius 15 Å was cut out from the bulk and then appropriate surface atoms were
removed to make it stoichiometrically neutral. ACE2 bound SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
structure (PDB ID: 6lzg) was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB). ACE2 protein was
removed before docking with the nanostructures. The structure of the lectin protein (PDB ID:
4ywa) of P. aeruginosa was also obtained from PDB. Molecular docking was performed using
AutoDock Vina [39] following previously published protocol [40]. The docked structures
were energy minimized under OPLS (optimized potential for liquid simulation) using
Desmond molecular dynamics program [41] as implemented in Schrodinger Maestro
(Academic release 2018-4) followed by rescoring with AutoDock Vina. Changes in the atomic
positions of the protein backbone after minimization was computed in terms of root mean
square deviation (RMSD).
Sequence analysis: Sequence of the cell surface adhesion lectin protein lecA of Pseudomonous
auregionosa was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4YWA). Structure and sequence
of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was also obtained from the PDB (ID:
6LZG). Sequence alignment was performed using Clustal Omega [73] with no end gap
penalty. Local alignments were performed with LALIGN [74]. Similar amino acids in the
binding sites of the two proteins are mapped using PyMOL molecular graphics software.
Antibacterial tests
The bacterial strains of gram-negative P. aeruginosa as used in this study were obtained from
Dey’s Medical Stores Mfg. Ltd., Kolkata, India. The glass wares, suction nozzles, and culture
medium were sterilized in an autoclave at a high pressure of 0.1 MPa and a temperature of
120°C for 30 min before experiments. Bacteria cultures were cultivated in sterilized LuriaBertani (LB) broth (Himedia, India) and incubation was done at 37°C with a shaking
incubator for 24 hrs.

The colony count method was used to estimate antibacterial properties through the
concentration of the survival colonies bacteria in co-cultured solution. First, original bacterial
suspensions were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) solution
to a concentration of 108 CFU/ml. Then, they were poured onto the ZnO NF functionalized
cotton fabric and incubated for 1 hour. Third, the incubated bacterial solution was diluted five
times to a certain concentration. The resulting bacterial PBS suspensions (100 L) were
spread on gelatinous LB agar plates, culturing at 37°C for 24 hours. The number of survival
colonies was counted manually. For growth curve analysis, the five times diluted bacterial
solution was added to LB and kept at 37°C. 600 nm absorbance (or, optical density; OD600)
was monitored at regular interval (1 h) to assess the growth kinetics.
The bacteria cells after proper incubation with the ZnO NF functionalized cotton fabric were
stained with DAPI and PI. The DAPI stains all cells while PI only stains the membrane
𝑅𝑒𝑑

disrupted cells. The (1 − 𝐵𝑙𝑢𝑒 ) ratio was obtained to assess the survivality of P. aeruginosa.
Non-functionalized cotton cloths and untreated bacterial cultures were used as control in all
the tests. All tests were repeated at least six times.
Statistics
Data are represented as Mean ± Standard Deviation (SD), unless otherwise stated. One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to calculated
differences between groups. P<0.05 was considered significant. For all statistical tests
GraphPad Prism (v8.0) software was used.
