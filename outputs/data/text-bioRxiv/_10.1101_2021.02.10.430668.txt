Abstract

48

Key immune signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection may associate with either adverse immune

49

reactions (severity) or simply an ongoing anti-viral response (temporality); how immune

50

signatures contribute to severe manifestations and/or temporal progression of disease and

51

whether longer disease duration correlates with severity remain unknown. Patient blood was

52

comprehensively immunophenotyped via mass cytometry and multiplex cytokine arrays,

53

leading to the identification of 327 basic subsets that were further stratified into more than

54

5000 immunotypes and correlated with 28 plasma cytokines. Low-density neutrophil

55

abundance was closely correlated with hepatocyte growth factor levels, which in turn

56

correlated with disease severity. Deep analysis also revealed additional players, namely

57

conventional type 2 dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, plasmablasts and CD16+ monocytes,

58

that can influence COVID-19 severity independent of temporal progression. Herein, we

59

provide interactive network analysis and data visualization tools to facilitate data mining and

60

hypothesis generation for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Introduction

71

The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute

72

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 25th January 2021, there are 100

73

million cases with more than 2 million deaths worldwide (Dong et al., 2020). While the

74

immunogenic responses in COVID-19 vaccinated individuals remain largely unknown, the

75

majority of the COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or have mild flu-like symptoms, some

76

develop severe diseases, which may lead to death from respiratory failure or even multi-

77

organ failure from a hyperactivated immune system (Manson et al., 2020). The

78

immunopathology in severe COVID-19 is characterized by lymphopenia, a sustained loss of

79

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, a dramatic increase in the number of immature neutrophils as well

80

as an altered myeloid cell compartment in severe COVID-19 cases (Carissimo et al., 2020;

81

Jouan et al., 2020; Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020). Another hallmark of

82

severe COVID-19 is the cytokine storm associated with elevated levels of cytokines (IL1,

83

IL1R, IL2, IL7, IL10, G-CSF, TNF), chemokines (IP10, MCP1, MIP1) and endogenous

84

neutrophil calprotectin (Ragab et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020; Barnaby E. Young et al., 2020).

85

Although many studies have independently identified different immunotypes and

86

cytokines associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19, their interplay is still

87

largely unknown for distinguishing active infection, severity and post-infection aberrations. In

88

this work, we analyzed the blood samples of 77 hospitalized patients and 10 healthy controls.

89

Also, to obtain a more full-bodied approach, we have compiled the data and provided a

90

comprehensive COVID-19 resource, which integrates high dimensional mass cytometry and

91

bead-based cytokine/chemokine arrays. Network analyses between the key immune subsets

92

and the associated cytokine levels in the plasma were used to correlate clinical states and

93

disease trajectory of COVID-19. One of the key findings is the identification of a link between

94

hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and low-density neutrophils (LD Neu). While both factors are

95

closely associated with disease severity, it represents only the tip of the iceberg; the network

96

of underlying pathways is complex and involves many players. By sharing these data

97

together with easy-to-use visualization tools, we provide a rich resource to study the

98

manifestation of COVID-19 as well as the particulars of the SARS-CoV-2 induced immune

99

response.

Results

101

Study design and clinical characteristics of the cohort

102

To determine the changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in peripheral blood

103

mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets, we assembled a comprehensive mass cytometry panel

104

of 40 antibodies against lineage-specific markers, adhesion molecules and other surface

105

molecules indicative of the functional state of the cells (Figure 1A). This panel divided the

106

entire PBMC population into 327 partly overlapping subsets, which consisted of both

107

extensively described immune cell populations such as T cells, B cells, dendritic cells,

108

monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, basophils, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells,

109

innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and LD Neu, as well as lesser-known immune cell populations

110

such as CD56+ monocytes, CD56+/- MAIT and the PD-L1+ LD Neu subsets (Villani et al.,

111

2017). Cytokine bead arrays based on Luminex™ and ultra-sensitive Quanterix™

112

technologies were used to quantify the changes of twenty-eight cytokines in patient plasma

113

(Figure 1A). The interconnected databases generated by these approaches were then

114

subjected to network analysis to determine immune signatures of the anti-SARS-CoV-2

115

response as well as the cellular and molecular drivers of severe COVID-19.

116

In order to establish a timeline on the SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response, 87

117

blood samples were collected from 77 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at varying time points

118

(Figure 1B). The state of infection was determined by SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse

119

transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described (Corman et al., 2020;

120

Barnaby E Young et al., 2020). PCR positive samples were grouped into early active

121

(median days post illness onset (PIO): 9) and late active (median days PIO: 20). PCR

122

negative samples were grouped into early convalescence (median days PIO: 25) and late

123

convalescence (median days PIO: 39) (Figure 1B). As a proxy for disease severity, the

124

samples were stratified based on treatment regime into three severity groups, namely mild

125

(symptomatic; n = 32), moderate (symptomatic with supplemental oxygen (suppl. O2); n = 24)

126

and severe (suppl. O2 and need for intensive care unit (ICU); n = 31). With the exception of

127

age and gender, most demographic variables did not differ significantly between COVID-19

128

patients and healthy donors, as well as between severity groups (Table S1). Severity was

129

associated with advanced age (p < 0.0001).

130

Temporal variations in PBMC subsets during active and convalescent COVID-19

131

Mass cytometry analysis allowed gating of total PBMCs into 38 non-overlapping basic

132

subsets from both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system (Figure 2A and Table

133

S2). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis segregated these cells

134

into distinct clusters of T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes and other antigen presenting

135

cells (Figure 2A, left). Surprisingly, large numbers of LD Neu were detected (Figure 2A, right).

136

Neutrophils are typically not present in the PBMC fraction of healthy donors but found in

137

abundance in COVID-19 samples. Subsequent analysis with a targeted mass cytometry

138

panel confirmed that these cells are indeed LD Neu by revealing an immunophenotype that

139

is consistent with neutrophils (CD66b+CD15+CD16highCD10+CD24+) (Table S2).

140

Generalized lymphopenia was observed in the active phase relative to convalescent

141

COVID-19 (Figure 2A, right), particularly in various CD4+ and CD8+ T cell, most B cell, NKT

142

and MAIT cell subsets. A significant reduction was also observed for non-classical

143

monocytes (NC. Mono), while increased frequencies were detected for plasmablasts,

144

classical monocytes (C. Mono) and LD Neu. Closer inspection of the temporal profiles for

145

various subsets revealed a number of interesting trends (Figure 2B). For LD Neu, the

146

increase was largely restricted to the late active phase, while the plasmablast frequency

147

increased during the early active phase. The frequency of C. and intermediate (Int.)

148

monocytes rose throughout active infection before declining in the convalescent phase. In

149

contrast, the frequency of NC. Mono in the blood dropped sharply during the early active

150

phase but increased gradually until late convalescence (Figure 2B).

151

The timeline of events is particularly evident in a heatmap display (Figure 3A, left).

152

Based on the increase in subset frequencies, the earliest responders were NK cells followed

153

by plasmablasts, C./Int. Mono and LD Neu. Further, there was also a sharp decrease in

154

numbers, which may indicate the mobilization of subsets such as NC. Mono, T regulatory

155

(Treg), T follicular helper (TFH) and CD4+ T cells to the lung mucosa as front-line responses.

156

Their frequencies increased later during convalescence (Figures 2B and 3A). We also

157

observed a loss in blood MAIT cell frequency during active infection that was restored to

158

healthy levels during convalescence (Figure 3A), which is in line with a previous study

159

suggesting active recruitment of MAIT to the lung mucosa (Parrot et al., 2020). Also the

160

robust increase in the frequency of circulating plasmablasts during the active phase is

161

consistent with previous single-cell analysis of patients with severe COVID-19 (Wilk et al.,

162

2020). In contrast, non-class-switched memory (NSM), class-switched memory (CSM) and

163

IgM+ memory B cells showed decreased frequencies, which increased during convalescence

164

but did not recover to healthy levels.

165

Activation and differentiation of immune cells during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection

166

were indicated by changes in the expression levels of surface markers (Figure 3A, right).

167

The profiles of more than 5000 immunotypes derived from the 38 basic immune subsets can

168

be assessed by an interactive online viewer (see Materials and Methods: Data and Code

169

Availability and Table S2). Although expression of functional markers was highly

170

heterogeneous across immune subsets and disease phases, we observed some notable

171

trends. CD38 was upregulated across diverse immune subsets during active infection,

172

indicative of widespread cell activation in response to viral infection. CD169, an adhesin that

173

binds sialic acid, was also selectively upregulated in all monocyte subsets during the early

174

but not late active phase. Many T and B cell subsets – Treg TEM, NSM and CSM cells –

175

downregulated the lymph node homing molecule CCR6 over the course of disease, primarily

176

during active infection, which may impede homing to inflamed tissues and development of

177

germinal center responses (Figure S1). A range of cell subsets exhibited elevated levels of

178

CD57 from early active infection to early convalescence, indicative of immune senescence

179

(Figure 3A). Finally, CD16 (FcRIII) was upregulated on MAIT cells in late active infection

180

and on LD Neu, all monocyte subsets and CD16+ NK cells during convalescence (Figure 3A).

181

Based on the observed phenotype variations, we defined and curated 327 partly

182

overlapping immunotypes and compared the frequencies of these subsets in each phase of

183

COVID-19 (Figure 3B and Table S3). High levels of CD169+ C. Mono were observed

184

exclusively during early active infection. The same also applied for CD38high plasmacytoid

185

dendritic cell (pDC) subsets and IgA+ plasmablasts, followed by IgA- plasmablasts. Notably,

186

four subsets of monocytes, namely CD141+HLADR- C. Mono, CD56+ C. Mono, CD45RA- Int.

187

Mono and CD56+ Int. Mono peaked during late active SARS-CoV-2 infection and may

188

portend recovery (Figure 3B). The increase in the LD Neu population from early to late active

189

infection is reflected in both its PD-L1+ and CD5+ subsets. The active-phase lymphopenia

190

affected virtually all CD8+ central (CD8 TCM) and effector memory T subsets (CD8 TEM)

191

(Figure 3B). Significant losses of CD56+CD8+ MAIT, CCR6+ CSM, HLA-DR+CD38- CD4+ T,

192

CD57-CD8+ and NKT subsets were also observed during active infection (Figure 3B). Next,

193

in convalescence, a frequency increase persisting into late phase was observed for T cells

194

(such as CD57+CD4+ T, HLA-DR+CD38+ CD8+ T, CD38+/ICOS+ TFH defined as circulatory

195

CXCR5+, Treg TCM/TEM), NC. Mono (IgA+, CD45RO- and CD16+CD169+) and CCR6- CSM

196

above healthy levels. Also in this phase, the loss of CD5- conventional type 2 DC (cDC2),

197

V2 TCM, V2 TEM, B cells memory CXCR5+, CCR6+ CSM and CD5- transitional B cells

198

persisted into late convalescence below healthy levels (Figure 3B). These late-convalescent

199

immunotypes, which do not recover to healthy levels, may represent post-infection

200

aberrations.

201

Alterations of immunotypes associated with disease severity

202

Depending on the treatment given, active and convalescent patients were stratified into ‘mild’

203

(symptomatic), ‘moderate’ (symptomatic with suppl. O2) and ‘severe’ (suppl. O2 and ICU

204

admission). Thus we obtained groups I, II and III denoting active mild, active moderate, and

205

active severe, respectively and groups IV (severe), V (moderate), and VI (mild) for patients

206

in the convalescent phase (Figure 1A). The global changes in the cell subset composition

207

are particularly evident in UMAP plots colored according to the fold change in reference to

208

healthy controls (Figure 3A). The most striking association was observed for LD Neu. While

209

a minor increase was observed in group I (active, mild), the numbers increased dramatically

210

in group II (active, moderate) and peaked in group III (active, severe). The numbers

211

persisted in group IV (conv., severe) and gradually declined from group V (conv., moderate)

212

to group VI (conv., mild) (Figures 4A, 4B and S2A). This was also reflected in the increased

213

LD Neu-to-lymphocyte ratios compared with group VI mild convalescent and healthy (Figure

214

S3A). The expansion of LD Neu was due to CD16+ neutrophils and CD16high neutrophils.

215

CD16high neutrophils (Figures S3B and S3C) described herein resemble pseudo-Pelger-Huet

216

cells, which were previously reported in other severe viral infections (Morrissey et al., 2020).

217

Two other immune cell subsets, which closely associated with severe COVID-19 are

218

V2 T and NKT cells (Figures 4B and S2A). Their frequencies sharply declined in group

219

II/III/IV patients. Further analysis revealed that the loss of V2 T is likely due to V2 TCM

220

and V2 TEM, which remained significantly reduced in frequency in groups IV/V compared

221

with healthy (Figures 4B, 5A and S4A). Similarly for NKT sub-populations, the CD57- NKT

222

cell but not CD57+ NKT cell subset was reduced in frequency in groups II/III/IV (Figure S4D).

223

The loss of the CD57- NKT cells included the CD4+, CD8+ and the double-negative (DN)

224

NKT sub-populations. Although reduced numbers were also detected for dendritic cell

225

subsets, the frequencies of pDC and cDC2 were only marginally suppressed across groups

226

II/III/IV/V (Figures 4B, S4B and S4C). For plasmablasts, a subtle increase in frequency was

227

observed in the active phase groups I to III but waned during convalescence (Figures 4A, 4B,

228

S5A, and S5B). Notably, IgA- plasmablasts showed a higher increase compared with its IgA+

229

counterpart (6.53-fold vs 2.89-fold compared with HD) in group III (Figures 4B and S5B).

230

Among the T cells, the strongest association with severity was observed for

231

HLADR+CD38+ CD8+ T cells. Unlike the frequencies of MAIT and NK cell subsets across

232

groups I/II/III and groups IV/V/VI, which were largely invariant across groups and thus did not

233

associate with severity (Figures S6A and S6B). The numbers of hyperactivated

234

HLADR+CD38+ CD8+ T cells peaked in severity groups III/IV, whereby the highest frequency

235

was detected in group IV during convalescence (Figures 4B and S7A). Also, a number of

236

emerging studies suggested a role of inflammatory monocytes in the pathogenesis of

237

COVID-19. In line with these results, although our data also showed elevated numbers of C.

238

Mono and Int. Mono during the active phase, the increase with regard to severity was only

239

marginal. The reverse trend was evident for NC. Mono, which declined in the active groups

240

I/II/III but increased during convalescence (Figures 4B, 5A, S2A and S3D).

241

The association of the frequencies of the 38 basic immune subsets with the six

242

severity groups as well as the associated surface marker expression is summarized in

243

Figure S2. Their phenotypes can be assessed by using the online viewer (see Materials and

244

Methods: Data and Code Availability). Figure 5A shows the subsets out of the 327 common

245

immunotypes, which exhibited the most significant frequency changes with regard to the six

246

severity groups. Based on the frequency distribution, they were divided into five different

247

clusters (Figure 5A, left). Immune subsets in the first cluster positively associated with mild

248

infection such as CD161+ NKT and CD5+ cDC2, which only increased in group I and may

249

thus play a potential protective role (Figure 5A). The second cluster is positively associated

250

with active SARS-CoV-2 infection across mild to severe groups I/II/II. Besides the

251

plasmablasts, CD169+/CD38+ C. Mono and CD86+/CD45RA-/CD38+ Int. Mono but not total

252

monocytes remained elevated in groups II/III. Also, like CD169+ C. Mono, both

253

CD38highCD45RA+ pDC and HLA-DR+CD56DIM NK peaked in group I and remained high in

254

groups II/III above healthy levels. Notably, HLA-DRLowCD141+ C. Mono, which has been

255

reported to be over-represented in ICU patients did not show a pronounced association with

256

the most severe group III but was rather increased throughout the active phase (Silvin et al.,

257

2020). This suggests that the aforementioned subset is unlikely to be a marker for severity.

258

The third cluster is positively associated with severe COVID-19. In this cluster, CXCR5+ B

259

cells memory subset was only increased in more severe groups II/III but various LD Neu

260

subsets were elevated in both severity groups III and IV (Figures 5A and 5B). PD-L1+ LD

261

Neu are most abundant in groups II/III while CD5+ LD Neu peaked in group IV. Within group

262

IV, hyperactivated HLA-DR+CD38+ CD8+ T cell subset was also elevated (Figures 5A

263

and,5B). The fourth cluster consisted of mixed frequency distribution during convalescence.

264

Various NC. Mono subsets (CD38+/CD123+/CD86+/CD45RO-/IgA+) and Treg TEM and TFH

265

subsets were increased in frequencies across groups IV/V/VI above healthy levels (Figures

266

5A and S3G). On the other hand, immune subsets of MAIT, CSM and NSM of more severe

267

COVID-19 patients often did not recover to healthy levels. Finally, the fifth cluster defined as

268

“severe inverse” included subsets exhibiting the greatest loss in frequency in patients with

269

most severe but not mild COVID-19. These were mostly cDC2, CD45RA+ pDC, CD57- NKT

270

and V2 memory T cells, which may indicate direct involvement in COVID-19 related

271

pathology (Figures 5A and S4).

272

The shifts in surface marker co-expression for some of the key populations are also

273

shown in Figure 5B. For LD Neu, besides the IgA+ marker, the PD-L1 co-expression was

274

particularly pronounced across the active and convalescent groups II to V. Additionally,

275

CD16high LD Neu was more abundantly expressed during convalescence, which was not

276

seen in healthy donors (Figures 5B and S3C). Similarly for NC. Mono, besides IgA+ and

277

CD86+ markers, CD16 co-expression was strongly increased in convalescent phase groups

278

IV and V (Figures 5B, S3E and S3G). And for hyperactivated HLA-DR+CD38+ CD8+ T cells,

279

the co-expression of CD45RO marker was highly elevated in groups III and IV. Similarly, a

280

concomitant increase in the co-expression of CD11b+ and CD24+ markers by CD56dimNK

281

was particular evident in groups III and IV (Figures 5B and S2B). Notably, this specific

282

immunotype has been reported to transdifferentiate into myeloid cells e.g. neutrophils (Song

283

et al., 2020).

Dynamics of plasma cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients

In order to correlate the shifts in frequency and phenotype with the cytokine/chemokine

286

environment, we have screened the corresponding COVID-19 plasma samples for 28

287

analytes using either Luminex or high-sensitivity Quanterix bead arrays. Of these, thirteen

288

cytokines showed statistically significant associations with the six severity groups (adjusted p

289

< 0.05) (Figure 6A). A comparison between the association with severity and the timing of

290

the immune response revealed that IFN, while abundantly found in the early active phase,

291

had very little prognostic value with regard to severity (Figure 6B). While the levels of IL6

292

seem to better match disease severity, this applied only for the active phase. Also, IL6 was

293

mostly detected during the early active phase. The association with severity however

294

substantially improved for IP10, TNF, HGF and VEGF-A. Especially the latter two were

295

detected in similar extent during both the active and convalescent phases.

296

To further identify the cytokine/immune cell associations during SARS-CoV-2

297

infection, we first correlated the cytokine levels with the frequencies of the 327 immunotypes.

298

The various plots for these correlations can be assessed in an interactive online viewer (see

299

Materials and Methods: Data and Code Availability). As the immune responses in different

300

phases of infection are vastly different, we carried out separate correlations for the active

301

and convalescent phases (Figure 6C, top). During active infection, IFN, IP10, IL6 and HGF

302

showed a pleiotropic effect on a variety of immune cells. IFN had a negative correlation

303

with various monocyte subsets such as NC. Mono but positively associated with ILC2,

304

CD38+ V2 TCM, IgM+CD38high B cells, CD5- transitional B cells, CCR6- transitional B cells

305

and CD25+ ILCs. IL6 was positively associated with B cells and various plasmablast subsets,

306

and HGF was positively associated with LD Neu but negatively with NKT.

307

During convalescence, a greater number of cytokines was associated with various

308

immunotypes, albeit the association was typically weaker as compared to the active phase

309

(Figure 6C, bottom). VEGF-A was strongly associated with HLA-DR+CD38+ CD8+ T cells but

310

negatively with CD8+CD56- MAIT cells. Interestingly, IgA+, CD5+ and PD-L1+ LD Neu

311

positively associated with TNF, which is known to promote neutrophil degranulation (Cross

312

et al., 2008; Salamone et al., 2001). Additionally, PIGF1 and IL17A positively associated with

313

CD38+ NKT and CXCR5- B cells, respectively, while negative associations of both

314

proinflammatory TNF and HGF with V2 T cells were observed, as well as negative

315

associations of both IL6 and HGF with CD8+CD56-MAIT.

316

As cytokines can also directly influence the surface expression of biomarkers, we

317

carried out a similar correlation for the surface molecules detected during the active phase

318

on the 327 immunotypes (Figure 6D). While there were fewer cytokines found significant,

319

they often correlated with the same surface marker on a number of different cell subsets.

320

IFN was positively associated with upregulated CD169+ on both C. and Int. Mono. The

321

same cytokine also triggered the upregulation of CD38 on various NC. Mono as well as

322

CD141-CD11b- C. Mono and various B cell subsets. IFN was also found negatively

323

associated with CD86 on B cells, while IL6 was negatively associated with CD4 on various C.

324

Mono populations. HGF was strongly associated only with the transdifferentiating

325

CD11b+CD56dim NK cells, which expressed CD24 (Song et al., 2020). Also, these data can

326

be visualized using the online viewer (see Materials and Methods: Data and Code

327

Availability).

328

Integrated network analysis of immune subsets and plasma cytokines

329

Current data analysis so far has revealed a number of subsets and cytokines clearly linked

330

to COVID-19 but the interaction of these components as well as the underlying pathways

331

appear to be very complex and under-appreciated. To obtain a comprehensive overview of

332

the interplay of these key players, we performed Bayesian network analysis using the

333

complete sets of the mass cytometry data of the 327 cell subsets as well as the

334

corresponding bead array measurements of the 13 cytokines (Figure 7 and Table S3). In

335

order to separate the immune signatures of COVID-19 severity from those involved in anti-

336

viral immune response, the fluctuations in these datasets were correlated independently with

337

regard to the time point of sampling during the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figures 7A and 7B)

338

and the severity score assigned to the respective patient (Figures 7C and 7D). Interactive

341

For the timing of the immune response in the active phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

342

the fold change of subset frequency and cytokine levels was determined independently for

343

the median day 9 PIO (“early active”; Figure 7A) and median day 24 PIO (“late active”;

344

Figure 7B). In the early active phase, the strongest correlation was observed for IFN

345

(Figure 7A). The increase in levels of IFN inversely correlated with a general decline in the

346

number of NC. Mono including the CD141+CD11b-, CD141-HLA-DR1-, CD45RO- and

347

CD16+CD11b- subsets. For these cells, the absolute fold change was between 5 to 8, and

348

the most pronounced reduction observed during the early active phase. The most substantial

349

increase was detected for CD38high CD45RA+ pDC and subsets of C. Mono expressing

350

CD169, a marker directly induced by IFN (compare Figure 6D). Other subsets positively

351

associated with the early phase of infection included several subsets of plasmablasts,

352

activated B memory and V2 T cells. Of these, IgA- plasmabasts positively correlated with

353

IL6, which is also significantly upregulated in the early phase. The increase in plasma IL6

354

was also associated with a loss of CD8+ T cells, MAIT and cDC2. In addition, elevated IP10

355

was a node associated with a depletion of MAIT and certain B cell subsets (NSM

356

CD27+CD38- and NSM CD27-CD38+). However, we did not find any nodal association with

357

V2 T cells, C. Mono and pDC populations to any of the cytokines, while SCF and IL1RA

358

were nonetheless early responders in the blood.

359

During the late active phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN levels dominating

360

the early phase strongly subsided (Figure 7B). Although the correlation with NC. Mono

361

nearly diminished, Int. and C. Mono strongly expanded in this phase, in particularly for the

362

CD169+ subsets with a 8-fold increase in frequency. Next, the correlation with IL6 levels

363

maintained at the late active phase but also two other cytokines, VEGF-A and TNF, begun

364

to show multiple cellular associations corresponding to significant losses of  T, ILC2 and

365

MAIT cells, while IL6 was a node associated with late increase in LD Neu and Int. Mono,

366

potentially linking these cytokines to the lymphopenia, neutrophilia and monocytosis, which

367

are characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

368

A strikingly different picture emerged when the network analysis was carried out in

369

reference to the severity of COVID-19 manifestation. Due to the different nature of the

370

immune response during active infection and convalescence, two independent networks

371

were generated for severity groups I to III (“active”; Figure 7C) and groups IV to VI (“conv.”;

372

Figure 7D). The degree of association was determined by a linear correlation of the subset

373

frequencies and cytokine levels in these groups and is expressed by their rho value. Notably

374

during the active phase, the strongest positive correlation was observed for LD Neu and its

375

CD38+, PD-L1+, IgA+ and CD5+ subsets (Figure 7C). With the exception of the latter, all of

376

them also positively correlated with HGF, which was also directly associated with disease

377

severity. While an increase in HGF correlated with an increased frequency of LD Neu

378

subsets, it was also associated with a loss of NKT cells, namely of the CD57- subsets.

379

Although their frequencies were inversely associated with disease severity, this does not

380

necessarily indicate a beneficial effect, as the disappearance of these subsets from the

381

blood may likely be a consequence of their redistribution towards the inflamed tissue. Other

382

subsets, which positively associated with severity are IgA- plasmablasts and CD16+CD11b-

383

C. Mono, possibly pointing to the role of IgG in the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Moreover,

384

plasmablast frequencies directly correlated with IL6 levels, which were also inversely

385

associated with cDC2. Similar to pDC and V2 T cells, their frequencies in the blood also

386

inversely correlated with disease severity.

387

The direct association of the LD Neu subsets with severity was also observed during

388

convalescence, and no significant negative correlation was detected for any of the immune

389

subsets (Figure 7D). Positive correlations were found for IgA+ NC. Mono, several CD8+ TEM

390

subsets, as well as CD38+, CD5+, IgA+ and PD-L1+ LD Neu. Of the cytokines, VEGF-A, HGF

391

and TNF correlated directly with severity, while fewer interactions between cytokines and

392

cell subsets were detected. At least during convalescence, the increase in TNF but not

393

HGF was positively associated with IgA+ LD Neu and PD-L1+ LD Neu subsets (Cross et al.,

394

2008). Additionally, elevated VEGF-A levels strongly associated with enriched HLA-

395

DR+CD38+CD8+ T cells(Voron et al., 2015), which are also directly associated with severity.

396

While especially the early response against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be dominated by IFN-

397

and IL6-driven immune responses (Figures 7A and 7B), network analysis did not provide any

398

evidence that the pathways and cellular components activated by these cytokines have a

399

major impact on the severity of the disease in either the active phase of infection (Figure 7C)

400

or during convalescence (Figure 7D).

401

Discussion

402

COVID-19 is triggered by viral infection whose pathology is mainly caused by

403

collateral or even autoimmune-like damage inflicted by a hyperactivated immune system. By

404

analyzing the blood samples of 77 hospitalized COVID-19 patients by mass cytometry and

405

cytokine bead arrays, we attempted to delineate the key factors driving the immune

406

pathology of COVID-19 from the genuine defense against SARS-CoV-2. To achieve this, we

407

segregated the PBMCs into 327 distinct immune cell subsets and determined the plasma

408

levels of 28 different chemokines and cytokines. The data were stratified with regard to

409

different phases of the viral infection and correlated with the severity score defined by the

410

clinical state of the patients. This generates a comprehensive data resource to analyze the

411

immune response triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection in an integrated and interactive

412

way.

413

A simplified timeline could be established by the breakdown of the infection into four

414

phases (early/late active and early/late convalescence). The time point of the given cell

415

subset was assessed by comparing their relative frequencies in these phases, and their

416

contribution to severity was quantified by the rho2 parameter of the disease score correlation

417

(Figure S8). Based on this, we propose the following immune progression: infection with

418

SARS-CoV-2 leads to early IFN-α production, as evidenced by an early upregulation of

419

CD169 on monocytes. This drives the disappearance of NC. Mono from the blood, which

420

together with V2 T, cDC2, pDC, NKT, CD8+ MAIT and CD8+ T cells appear to be recruited

421

to the inflamed tissues. In parallel, during this early active phase (median days PIO: 9) there

422

is also an expansion of activated memory B cells and importantly, antibody-producing

423

plasmablasts. The plasmablast frequency remains high during the late active phase, a

424

process associated with elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IP10 and

425

TNF.

426

The late active phase (median days PIO: 20) is also characterized by an expansion

427

of C. Mono, which likely differentiates into Int. and NC. Mono. The relative fraction of Int.

428

Mono remained high during convalescence, above healthy controls even at the late

429

convalescent phase (median days PIO: 39). In comparison, NC. Mono frequency was the

430

highest during convalescence (Figure 3A). The same applies for CD8+ TEM cells, in

431

particular for the HLADR+CD38+ subset, which has been found to be enriched in lungs of

432

deceased COVID-19 patients (Xu et al., 2020). Notably, major changes in the frequency of

433

NK subsets were only observed during convalescence, suggestive of a minor role during the

434

early phase of infection.

435

Disease resolution and convalescence usually result in the normalization of most cell

436

subsets. Notably, the late convalescent subsets, including hyperactivated HLADR +CD38+

437

CD8+ T cells, senescent CD57+ CD4+ T cells, Treg TCM/TEM, activated ICOS+/CD38+ TFH,

438

NC. Mono, V2 TCM/TEM, lymph node homing CCR6+ CSM B cells, NSM B cells and IL12-

439

producing CD5- cDC2 cells, persistently failed to recover to healthy levels, and may

440

contribute to the lingering symptoms associated to post-infection aberrations (Figure 3B).

441

Further studies would be needed to determine if alterations to these immune subsets

442

contribute to the long-term effects observed in some patients after recovery from severe

443

disease (Weerahandi et al., 2020).

444

While the involvement of immune cell subsets in anti-viral defense can be

445

heterogeneous, a clearer picture emerges when considering specific immunotypes related to

446

COVID-19 severity. Among the frequencies of subsets such as NC. Mono, V2 T, cDC2,

447

pDC, CD57- NKT, CD8+ MAIT, and CD8+ T cells showing depletion or enrichment for

448

plasmablasts during infection (Figures S3-S7), the most dramatic severity association was

449

observed for LD Neu (Figure S3). Although LD Neu is virtually absent in the blood of healthy

450

donors, extreme levels were often detected in the blood in the most severe group of patients

451

requiring supplemental O2 and/or ICU. Due to their high density, neutrophils are not

452

expected to be part of the PBMC fraction. However, processes like neutrophil degranulation

453

can reduce the cell density, which allows them to ‘contaminate’ the lymphocyte/monocyte

454

fraction during Ficoll separation (Hacbarth and Kajdacsy‐Balla, 1986). As degranulation is

455

an integral part of neutrophil biology, the number of LD Neu in the blood may indicate the

456

extent of ongoing neutrophil responses. Previous studies have reported increased numbers

457

of activated neutrophils inside the inflamed lung tissue (Barnes et al., 2020; Fox et al., 2020;

458

Wang et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) as well as elevated levels of immature neutrophils in the

459

blood circulation of COVID-19 patients (Carissimo et al., 2020). This is in line with another

460

recent study showing the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the lungs of

461

deceased COVID-19 patients (Radermecker et al., 2020). Notably, LD Neu seems to have a

462

heightened capacity to release NETs (Yu and Su, 2013). In fact, LD Neu and NET formation

463

have been reported in a number of autoimmune diseases, such as antiphospholipid

464

syndrome (Mauracher et al., 2020), systemic lupus erythematosus(Van Den Hoogen et al.,

465

2020), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasm autoantibody vasculitis (Ui Mhaonaigh et al., 2019),

466

potentially consistent with autoimmune-like features of COVID-19 pathology (Woodruff et al.,

467

2020).

468

As monocytes has been implicated in COVID-19 pathology (Bedin et al., 2020; Guo

469

et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), we further characterized the monocyte

470

population into about 90 different subsets. As expected, IFN is linked to the induction of

471

CD169+ C. Mono during the early active phase as well as the expansion of CD16hi monocyte

472

populations, however we failed to observe any significant association with disease severity.

473

The only exception may be the expansion of CD16+CD11b- C. Mono (Figure 7C) during the

474

active phase and possibly IgA+ NC. Mono during convalescence (Figure 7D). Here, we could

475

neither confirm the protective effect of CD169+ C. Mono nor the increase of CD141+HLADR-

476

C Mono in severe cases as reported by Hadjadj et al. (Hadjadj et al., 2020). A possible

477

explanation for the discrepancy may be the difference in the timeline of sample taking or in

478

the respective definition of severity; in Hadjadi’s study, ‘mild’ cases were essentially

479

asymptomatic but all of our patients were hospitalized.

480

Lastly, our study goes a step further by directly linking the neutrophil-specific immune

481

response to the pathology of COVID-19. One of the most striking results is the strong
20

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.10.430668; this version posted February 11, 2021. The copyright holder for this

482

association between LD Neu frequency and HGF plasma levels. Both factors are directly

483

associated with COVID-19 severity, suggesting that the cytokine may also play a key role in

484

the pathology. The associative nature of this study however does not allow us to draw direct

485

causal conclusions. Furthermore, the source of HGF is still controversial. While the bulk of

486

HGF seems to be released by mesenchymal cells, neutrophils may still play an important

487

role by acting as a source of matured HGF (Ohnishi et al., 2006; Small and Lung, 2006;

488

Wislez et al., 2003). HGF typically acts as anti-inflammatory and supports wound healing.

489

For instance, mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to alleviate acute lung injury via the

490

paracrine secretion of HGF (Lu et al., 2019). HGF and its receptor c-MET also play a crucial

491

role in various cancer where the neutrophil/HGF axis seems to mediate tumor growth by

492

eliciting immune-suppression (Glodde et al., 2017). However, depending on differentiation

493

and tissue environment, neutrophils can exert both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects

494

(Rosales, 2018). An earlier in vitro study even suggested that HGF stimulates neutrophil

495

degranulation (Kowanko et al., 1993). It is therefore likely that the presence of HGF in

496

severe COVID-19 may also promote the release of NETs (Radermecker et al., 2020). It may

497

thus be worth to evaluate existing HGF/c-MET drugs with regard to their ability to prevent or

498

stop deteriorating COVID-19 symptoms.

499

In summary, while the cellular and molecular interactions underlying COVID-19 are

500

very complex, we have identified some new candidates for potential treatment interventions.

501

Here, the HGF/LD Neu axis may represent a promising new lead for direct interventions, and

502

future studies have to show if HGF is actually a better pharmacological target than IFN and

503

IL6. The trials with IL6 inhibitors have already failed and there is acute demand for effective

504

treatments. In support of this hunt, this study generates a database that could be used as a

505

crucial resource to evaluate the pathways and to validate, identify or exclude candidate

506

targets that could help to control the ongoing pandemic.

respective institutional review boards (IRBs). All individuals involved in this study were over

516

the age of 21, comprising 66 males and 21 females. Additional demographic details can be

517

found in Table S1.

Sample collection

520

Blood from healthy adult donors and COVID-19 patients were collected in BD Vacutainer

521

CPT Tubes and processed according to manufacturer’s instructions to obtain the PBMC and

522

plasma fractions. Isolated PBMCs were then used for mass cytometry staining after two

523

washes with 1X phosphate buffer saline (PBS).

524
525

Cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) sample processing and data acquisition

526

Freshly isolated ficoll-density centrifuged PBMCs were plated at 0.5 – 1 x 106 in a 96-well V

527

bottom plates and stained for viability with 100 µL of 66 µM of cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5

528

minutes on ice. Cells were then washed with staining buffer (4% v/v fetal bovine serum, 0.05%

529

v/v sodium azide in 1X PBS) and stained with anti-γδTCR-PE and anti-Vδ1-FITC in 50 µL

530

reaction volume for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed with staining buffer

531

and then stained with 50 µL of metal isotope-labeled surface antibodies on ice. After 20

532

minutes, cells were washed with staining buffer, followed by PBS, and fixed in 4% v/v

533

paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) at 4°C overnight. On the following

534

day, cells were incubated in staining buffer for 5 minutes. Cellular DNA was labeled at room

535

temperature with 170 nM iridium intercalator (Fluidigm) in 2% v/v PFA/PBS. After 20 minutes,

536

cells were washed twice with staining buffer.

537

Prior to CyTOF acquisition, cells were washed twice with water before final re-suspension in

538

water. Cells were enumerated, filtered and diluted to a final concentration of 0.6 x 106

539

cells/mL. EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm) were added to the samples at a

540

final concentration of 2% v/v prior to acquisition. Samples were acquired on a Helios Mass

541

Cytometer (Fluidigm) at an event rate of < 500 events per second. After CyTOF acquisition,

542

data were exported in flow-cytometry (FCS) format, normalized to 300,000 PBMCs and

543

events with parameters having zero values were randomized using a uniform distribution of

544

values between minus-one and zero. Subsequently, manual gating was performed to

545

exclude residual beads, debris and dead cells.

546
547

Gating strategy for CyTOF

548

We have designed a 40-plex antibodies panel for mass cytometry and performed non-

549

supervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) or Triplet-constraint

550

(TriMAP) dimensionality reduction for larger dataset embedding of ficoll-density centrifuged

551

PBMCs obtained from both COVID-19 active and convalescent patients (Amid and Warmuth,

552

2019; McInnes et al., 2018). Iterative manual and UMAP clustering identified populations of

553

T cells, B cells, monocytes, NK, DC, ILCs, basophil as well as the LD neutrophils based on

554

their cell surface expression markers to generate 327 different immune cell subpopulations.

Plasma from COVID-19 patients, healthy controls, as well as standards were incubated with

570

fluorescent-coded magnetic beads pre-coated with respective antibodies in a black 96-well

571

clear-bottom plate overnight at 4˚C. After incubation, plates were washed 5 times with wash

572

buffer (PBS with 1% v/v bovine serum albumin (Capricorn Scientific) and 0.05% v/v Tween-

573

20 (Promega)). Sample-antibody-bead complexes were incubated with biotinylated detection

574

antibodies for 1 hour and washed 5 times with wash buffer. Subsequently, Streptavidin-PE

575

was added and incubated for another 30 minutes. Plates were washed 5 times again, before

576

sample-antibody-bead complexes were re-suspended in sheath fluid for acquisition on the

577

FLEXMAP® 3D (Luminex) using xPONENT® 4.0 (Luminex) software. Data analysis was

578

done on Bio-Plex ManagerTM 6.1.1 (Bio-Rad). Standard curves were generated with a 5-PL

579

(5-parameter logistic) algorithm, reporting values for both mean florescence intensity (MFI)

580

and concentration data.

581

Internal control samples were included in each plate to remove any potential plate effects.

582

Readouts of these samples were then used to normalize the assayed plates. A correction

583

factor was obtained from the median concentration values observed across the multiple

584

assay plates and this correction factor was then used to normalize all the samples. The

585

concentrations were logarithmically transformed to ensure normality. Analytes that were not

Plasma immune mediator levels in selected active and convalescence phase of COVID-19

591

patients were measured using SIMOA Cytokine 3-Plex B (C3PB) assay kit (Quanterix) and

592

SIMOA IFN-a assay kit (Quanterix). C3PB kit analyte detection included interleukin (IL) IL6,

593

IL17A and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF).

96-well plate before loading into the Simoa® HD-1 Analyzer (Quanterix) for data acquisition.

596

Reagents from the C3PB and IFN assay kits were prepared according to the kit manual

597

and loaded into the analyzer. Fully automated data acquisition was done on Simoa® HD-1

Quantification and Statistical Analysis

602

Active and convalescence phase samples were defined by PCR positivity and serve as time

603

based clinical end points. Active phase samples were further divided into early (PIO <= 14

604

days) and late (PIO > 14 days). Convalescence phase samples were also further divided

605

into early (PIO <= 28 days) and late (PIO > 28 days). These provide a more granular time

606

based clinical end points.

607

Severity based clinical end points were defined for active and convalescence phase samples

608

separately. Three severity groups were defined for each phase consisting of symptomatic

609

patients, patients requiring oxygen supplementation and patients requiring oxygen

610

supplementation and awarded into intensive care unit as shown in Figure 1A.

611

Mass cytometry and cytokine measurements were associated to the clinical end points (time

612

based as well as severity based) using Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Dunn's post hoc

613

tests. Correlations between mass cytometry and cytokine measurements were done using

614

Spearman Rank correlations. In the event that multiple samples from the same patient was

615

available for same time period, the earliest of the samples were used for analyses to ensure

616

that all samples used in the analyses are distinct. Multiple testing correction was done using

617

the method of Benjamini and Hochberg. P values less than 0.05 were deemed to be

618

significant. All statistical tests were two-sided (when appropriate) unless otherwise indicated.

800

respective day post illness onset (PIO), the severity (right panels) to the levels detected in

801

the 6 severity groups. Red colors refer to samples from the active phase, green to

the correlation coefficient (rho). Color indicated the direction (Red: positive, blue: negative).

806

Only associations abs(rho) > 0.3 and p < 0.05 are shown. Selected examples of these

810

that the correlation was carried out with the MMI values of the various cell surface marker

811

instead of the percentage value of the cell populations.

Figure 7. A node-edge interaction network of the cytokine level and immune cellular

823

frequencies in COVID-19 patients. Association are shown with regard to the timing (A, B)

824

and the severity (C, D). Nodes represent either cytokines (white) or immune subsets

825

(colored). The central node represents the “comparison of interest”. The edges represent

826

significant associations between two nodes with the thickness indicating the strength either

827

based on fold change or correlation coefficient (rho). Color indicates the direction (Red:

828

positive, blue: negative), dotted lines indicate associations with cytokines. For the central

829

node, only associations with abs(rho) > 0.3 and p < 0.05 are colored and shown as bar

830

charts on the right. For the timing (A, B) these bar charts indicate the fold changes in the

831

early active (A) and late active state (B) in reference to late convalescent state while for the

832

severity (C, D) they represent the correlation coefficient (rho) in reference to the severity

833

groups in the active (C) and convalescent state (D). The number code of the cell subsets is

834

listed in table S3, an interactive network viewer is available in the Materials and Methods:
