Abstract
In this study, we used an integrative computational approach focused on comparative
perturbation-based modeling to examine molecular mechanisms and

determine

functional

signatures underlying role of functional residues in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are
targeted by novel mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations. Atomistic simulations
and functional dynamics analysis

are

combined with alanine scanning and mutational

sensitivity profiling for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with the ACE2 host receptor
are REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail (REG10987+REG10933).

Using alanine scanning and

mutational sensitivity analysis, we have shown that K417, E484 and N501 residues correspond
to key interacting centers

with a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity that

allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity with ACE2. Through
perturbation-based network modeling

and community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike

protein complexes with ACE2 we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417 and N501 residues serve
as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major inter-molecular communities that
mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results provide support to a model
according to which mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations constrained by the
requirements for host receptor binding and preservation of stability may preferentially select
structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric centers

to differentially modulate

collective motions and allosteric interactions in the complexes with the ACE2 enzyme and
REGN-COV2 antibody combination. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may
function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits plasticity of
allosteric regulatory centers to fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising
activity of the spike protein.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic associated with the

severe acute

respiratory syndrome (SARS)1-5 has been at the focal point of biomedical research. SARS-CoV2 infection is transmitted when the viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the host cell receptor
leading to the entry of S protein into host cells and membrane fusion.6-8 The full-length SARSCoV-2 S protein consists of two main domains, amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit and carboxyl (C)terminal S2 subunit. The subunit S1 is involved in the interactions with the host receptor and
includes an N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and two structurally
conserved subdomains (SD1 and SD2). Structural and biochemical studies have shown that the
mechanism of virus infection may involve spontaneous conformational transformations of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein

between a spectrum of closed and receptor-accessible open forms,

where RBD continuously switches between “down” and “up” positions where the latter can
promote

binding with the host receptor ACE2.9-11 The crystal structures of the S-RBD in the

complexes with human ACE2 enzyme revealed structurally conserved binding mode shared by
the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins in which an extensive interaction network is formed
by the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the RBD region.12-16 These studies established that
binding of the SARS-CoV-RBD to the ACE2 receptor can be a critical initial step for virus
entry into target cells. The rapidly growing body of cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins detailed distinct conformational arrangements of S protein trimers in the prefusion
form

that are manifested by a dynamic equilibrium between the closed (“RBD-down”) and

the receptor-accessible open (“RBD-up”) form

required for the S protein fusion to the viral

membrane.17-34 The cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer demonstrated that
S protein may populate a spectrum of closed states by fluctuating between structurally rigid

locked-closed form and more dynamic, closed states preceding a transition to the fully open S
conformation.26

Conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in

complex with receptor ACE2 suggesting considerable conformational heterogeneity of ACE2RBD and continuous swing motions of ACE2-RBD in the context of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer.
According to these experiments, the associated ACE2-RBD is relatively dynamic, showing three
major conformational states with different angle of ACE2-RBD to the surface of the S trimer.33
Cryo-EM structural studies also mapped a mechanism of conformational events associated with
ACE2 binding, showing that the compact closed form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein becomes
weakened after furin cleavage between the S1 and S2 domains, leading to

the increased

population of partially open states and followed by ACE2 recognition that can accelerate
transformation to a fully open and ACE2-bound form priming the protein for fusion activation.34
These studies confirmed a general mechanism of population shifts between different functional
states of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimers, suggesting that RBD epitopes can become stochastically
exposed to the interactions with the host receptor ACE2.
The biochemical and functional studies using a protein engineering and deep mutagenesis have
quantified binding mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the host receptor.35,36 Deep
mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 RBD revealed constraints on folding and ACE2 binding
showing that many mutations of the RBD residues can be well tolerated with respect to both
folding and binding. A surprisingly large number of amino acid modifications could even
improve ACE2 binding, including important binding interface positions that enhance RBD
expression (V367F and G502D) or enhance ACE2 affinity (N501F, N501T, and Q498Y)35. This
comprehensive mutational scanning

of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues suggested the

evolutionary potential for compensation of deleterious mutations in the ACE2 interface

reminiscent of multi-step escape pathways and highlighted the energetic plasticity of the SARSCoV-2 interaction networks in which mutations may enhance binding affinity thus providing a
roadmap for quantifying map immune-escape mutations. Using deep mutagenesis, it was also
demonstrated that human ACE2 is only suboptimal for binding of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD as
ACE2 variants near the interface can result in the improved binding and simultaneously enhance
folding stability.36

Mutational landscape analysis showed a significant number of ACE2

mutations at the interface that enhance RBD binding, and the molecular basis for affinity
enhancement can be rationalized from the structural analysis.36 Functional studies characterized
the key amino acid residues of the RBD for binding with human ACE2 and neutralizing
antibodies, revealing two groups of amino acid residues to modulate binding, where the SARSCoV-2 RBD mutations
N501/T487 can result

N439/R426, L452/K439, T470/N457, E484/P470, Q498/Y484 and
in the enhanced binding affinity for ACE2.37 Additionally, A475 and

F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were identified as the key residues for the recognition of both
their common functional receptor ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, suggesting structural and
energetic plasticity of the RBM residues involved in ACE2 recognition may induce mutational
escape from the neutralizing antibodies targeting the RBD regions.
The rapidly growing structural studies of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Abs) have

delineated

molecular mechanisms underlying binding competition with the ACE2 host receptor, showing
that

combinations of Abs can provide a broad and efficient cross- neutralization effects

through synergistic

targeting

of conserved and variable SARS-CoV-2 RBD epitope.38-49

Structural studies confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein can feature distinct antigenic sites
and some specific Abs may allosterically inhibit the ACE2 receptor binding without directly
interfering with ACE2 recognition.44 The SARS-CoV-2 Abs are divided into several main

classes of which class 1 and class 2 antibodies target epitopes that overlap with the ACE2
binding site.50,51 The structural studies revealed binding epitopes and binding mechanisms for a
number of newly reported SARS-CoV-2 Abs targeting RBD regions and competing with ACE2
include B38 and H14 Abs,52 P2B-2F6,53 CA1 and CB6,54 CC12.1 and CC12.3,55 C105,56 and
BD-23 Ab.57 The crystal structure of a neutralizing Ab CR3022 in the complex with the SARSCoV-2 S-RBD revealed binding to a highly conserved epitope that is located away from the
ACE2-binding site but could only be accessed when two RBDs adopt the “up” conformation.42
Subsequent structural and surface plasmon resonance studies confirmed that CR3022 binds the
RBD of SARS-CoV-2

displaying strong neutralization by allosterically perturbing the

interactions between the RBD regions and ACE2 receptor.43

The crystal structure of an RBD-

EY6A Fab complex identified the highly conserved epitope located away from the ACE2
binding site, showing that EY6A can compete with CR3022 by targeting residues that are
important for stabilizing the pre-fusion S conformation.58
The B.1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2, a descendant of the D614G lineage, has originated in
UK and spread to 62 countries showing the increased transmissibility. 8 of the 17 mutations
observed in this variant are accumulated in the S protein, featuring most prominently N501Y
mutation that can increase binding affinity with ACE2 while eliciting immune escape and
reduced neutralization of RBD-targeting Abs.59-61 A new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) first
detected in South Africa is characterized by 21 mutations with 8 lineage-defining mutations in
the S protein, including three at important RBD residues (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that
have functional significance and often induce significant immune escape.62,63 Finally, the
recently discovered new lineage, named P.1 (descendent of B.1.1.28),

December in Brazil and contains a constellation of lineage defining mutations, including several
mutations of known biological importance such as E484K, K417T, and N501Y mutations.64,65

Functional mapping of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD that escape antibody binding
using deep mutational scanning showed that the escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of
the RBD and have large effects on antibody escape while a negligible negative impact on
ACE2 binding and RBD folding.66 This illuminating study demonstrated that escape sites from
antibodies can be constrained with respect to their effects on expression of properly folded RBD
and ACE2 binding, suggesting that escape-resistant antibody cocktails can compete for binding
to the same RBD region but have different escape mutations which limits the virus ability to
acquire novel sites of immune escape in the RBD without compromising its binding to ACE2.66
Comprehensive mapping of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that affect recognition by
polyclonal human serum antibodies revealed that mutations in E484 site tend to have the largest
effect on antibody binding to the RBD,67

and various functional neutralization assay

experiments indicated that E484 modifications can reduce the neutralization potency by some
antibodies by >10 fold.67-69 These studies also indicated that K417N and N501Y mutants can
escape neutralization by some monoclonal antibodies but typically only modestly affected
binding.67,70 At the same time, mutations in the epitope centered around E484 position (G485,
F486, F490) or in the 443–455 loop (K444, V445, L455, F456 sites) strongly affected
neutralization for several Abs.67-71 Functional mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues that
affect binding of the REGN-COV2 cocktail showed that REGN10933 and REGN10987 are
escaped by different mutations as mutation at F486 escaped neutralization only by REGN10933,
whereas mutations at K444 escaped neutralization only by REGN10987, while E406W escaped
both individual REGN-COV2 antibodies.70 This study confirmed that escape mutations at

Q493, Q498 and N501 sites may enhance binding affinity with ACE2 and that escape mutations
can also emerge in positions distant from the immediate proximity of the binding epitope,
highlighting structural and energetic plasticity of the RBD regions and potential allosteric-based
mechanism of immune escape.70

The REGN-COV2 cocktail (REG10987+REG10933)

demonstrated significant potential in preventing mutational escape,72

several other antibody

cocktails such as COV2-2130+COV2-2196,73 BD-368-2+BD-62974 and B38+H452 displayed
promising neutralization activities. Analysis of the molecular determinants and mechanisms of
mutational escape showed that SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly escapes from individual antibodies
but doesn’t easily escape from the cocktail due to stronger evolutionary constraints on RBDACE2 interaction and RBD protein folding.75 According to this study, the key RBD positions
critical for escape of antibody combinations include K444 which is important epitope residue
for CoV2-06, P2B-2F6, S309 and REG10987 Abs as well as E484/F486 sites that are central
for binding of CoV2-14 and REG10933. Functional analysis validated that mutations of these
residues are responsible for viral escape from the individual Abs and in combination with other
currently circulating variants (N501Y, K417N, E484K) may induce the reduced neutralization by
the antibody cocktails.75 The SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 lineage that includes one cluster in NTD
with four substitutions and a deletion (L18F, D80A, D215G, Δ242–244, and R246I), and another
cluster of three substitutions in RBD (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) can confer neutralization
escape from SARS-CoV-2 directed monoclonal antibodies and

significantly increased

neutralization resistance from individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.76
Moreover, three class 1 antibodies (CA1, CB6 and CC12.1) that target the ACE2-binding RBM
region showed a complete lack of binding for 501Y.V2 variant, suggesting that mutations in
the RBD and NTD clusters may to amplify the mutational escape from RBD-targeted Abs.

or

the

K417N/E484K/N501Y combination can be reduced by a small but significant margin, suggesting
that these mutations in individuals with compromised immunity may erode the effectiveness of
vaccine elicited immunity.77 Importantly, it was also shown that neutralization by 14 of the 17
most potent tested mAbs can be partly reduced or even abolished by either K417N, or E484K,
or N501Y mutations. Another latest study reported the preserved neutralization of N501Y,
Δ69/70 + N501Y + D614G and E484K + N501Y + D614G viruses by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited
human sera.77 Consistent with other studies, it was shown that the neutralization against the
virus with three mutations from the SA variant (E484K + N501Y + D614G) was slightly lower
than the neutralization against the N501Y virus

and

the virus with three UK mutations

(Δ69/70 + N501Y + D614G), but these differences were relatively small.78 SARS-CoV-2-S
pseudo-viruses bearing either the reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of
40 participants who were vaccinated with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 showed largely
preserved neutralization, indicating that the B.1.1.7 lineage will not escape BNT162b2-mediated
protection.79 The recent data demonstrate reduced but still significant neutralization against the
full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination.80 New SARS-CoV-2 variants that resist
neutralizing antibodies are now emerging in low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2
populations. In particular, recent reports presented evidence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 spike
N439K variants

evading antibody-mediated immunity, particularly

N439K mutation that

confers resistance against several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and reduces the activity of

recently discovered existence of allosteric sites on the SARS-CoV- 2 spike protein.95 By using
molecular simulations and network modeling we recently presented the first evidence that the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can function as an allosteric regulatory engine that fluctuates
between dynamically distinct functional states.96

Coarse-grained normal mode analyses combined with Markov model

and computation of

transition probabilities characterized the dynamics of the S protein and the effects of mutational
variants D614G and N501Y on protein dynamics and energetics.97 Using time-independent
component analysis (tICA) and protein networks, another computational study identified the
hotspot residues that may exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening, showing that
some mutations may

allosterically affect the stability of the RBD regions.98 Molecular

simulations reveal that N501Y mutation increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the
collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex while mutations K417N and E484K reduce the
ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing the

interfacial salt bridges.99 The growing body of

computational modeling studies investigating dynamics and molecular mechanisms of SARSCoV-2 mutational variants produced inconsistent results that propose different mechanisms.
The development of a more unified view and a working theoretical model which can explain the
diverse experimental observations is an important area of current efforts in the field.

mutational variants

in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

We combined coarse-grained (CG)

simulations and atomistic reconstruction of dynamics trajectories with dynamic fluctuation
communication analysis, mutational sensitivity analysis and network community modeling to
examine complexes of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and dissociated S1 domain of the S protein
formed with the ACE2 host receptor. Using distance fluctuations communication analysis and
functional dynamics analysis, we determine and compare the distribution of regulatory centers in
the RBD complexes with ACE2 and REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail (REG10987+REG10933).
Using alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity analysis, we show that K417, E484 and N501
residues correspond to key interacting centers

with a significant degree of structural and

energetic plasticity that allow mutants in these positions to afford the improved binding affinity
with ACE2.

Through perturbation-based network modeling and community analysis of the

SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes with ACE2 we demonstrate that E406, N439, K417 and N501
residues serve as effector centers of allosteric interactions and anchor major inter-molecular
communities that mediate long-range communication in the complexes. The results of the
comparative network analysis with antibody complexes, we show that mutations in these
positions can alter structural arrangements with antibodies and compromise their neutralization
effects. These results suggest that antibody-escaping mutations target allosteric mediating
hotspots with sufficient plasticity and adaptability to

modulate and improve binding and

allosteric signaling functions with the host receptor activity while

reducing efficiency of

antibody recognition and long-range communications. This analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2
S protein may function as a versatile and functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits
plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers to generate escape mutants that fine-tune response to
antibody binding without compromising activity of the spike protein.

Materials and Methods
Coarse-Grained Molecular Simulations
Coarse-grained (CG) models are computationally effective approaches for simulations of large
systems over long timescales.

In this study,

CG-CABS model100-104

was used for

simulations of the crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2 (pdb id
6M0J)15 and complexes formed by the dissociated S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike bound to
ACE2 (pdb id 7A91, 7A92)34 (Figure 1A-C). We also simulated the cryo-EM structure of the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD

complex with the Fab fragments of two neutralizing antibodies,

REGN10933 and REGN10987 (pdb id 6XDG)105 (Figure 1D-F).

In this high-resolution

model, the amino acid residues are represented by Cα, Cβ, the center of mass of side chains
and another pseudoatom placed in the center of the Cα-Cα pseudo-bond. In this model, the
amino acid residues are represented by Cα, Cβ, the center of mass of side chains and the
center of the Cα-Cα pseudo-bond. The CABS-flex approach implemented as a Python 2.7
object-oriented standalone package was used in this study to integrate a high-resolution
coarse-grained model

with robust and efficient conformational

sampling proven to

accurately recapitulate all-atom MD simulation trajectories of proteins on a long time scale.104
Conformational sampling in the CABS-flex approach is conducted with the aid of Monte
Carlo replica-exchange dynamics and involves local moves of individual amino acids in the
protein structure and global moves of small fragments.100-102
The default settings were applied in which soft native-like restraints are imposed only on pairs
of residues fulfilling the following conditions : the distance between their Cα atoms was
smaller than 8 Å, and both residues belong to the same secondary structure elements. A total
of 1,000 independent CG-CABS simulations were performed for each of the studied systems.

In each simulation, the total number of cycles was set to 10,000 and the number of cycles

Structure Preparation and Analysis
All structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank.106,107 During structure preparation
stage, protein residues in

the crystal structures were inspected for missing residues and

protons. Hydrogen atoms and missing residues were initially added and assigned according to
the WHATIF program web interface.108,109 The structures were further pre-processed through
the Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY) and included the check of
bond order, assignment and adjustment of ionization states, formation of disulphide bonds,
removal of

crystallographic water molecules and co-factors, capping of the termini,

assignment of partial charges, and addition of possible missing atoms and side chains that were
not assigned in the initial processing with the WHATIF program.

optimized by SCWRL4 tool.113 The shielding of the receptor binding sites by glycans is an
important common feature of viral glycoproteins, and glycosylation on SARS-CoV proteins
can camouflage

immunogenic protein epitopes.114,115

The atomistic structures from

simulation trajectories of the dissociated S1 domain complex with ACE2 (pdb id 7A92) were
elaborated by adding N-acetyl glycosamine (NAG) glycan residues and optimized.

The

glycosylated microenvironment for atomistic models of the simulation trajectories

was

mimicked by using the structurally resolved glycan conformations for most occupied Nglycans as determined in the cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S trimer in the
closed state (K986P/V987P,) (pdb id 6VXX) and open state (pdb id 6VYB).

Functional Dynamics and Collective Motions Analysis
We performed principal component analysis (PCA) of reconstructed trajectories derived from
CABS-CG simulations using the CARMA package116 and also determined the essential slow
mode profiles using elastic network models (ENM) analysis.117 Two elastic network models:
Gaussian network model (GNM)117,118 and Anisotropic network model (ANM) approaches119
were used to compute the amplitudes of isotropic thermal motions and directionality of
anisotropic motions. The functional dynamics analysis was conducted using the GNM in which
protein structure is reduced to a network of N residue nodes identified by Cα atoms and the
fluctuations of each node are assumed to be isotropic and Gaussian. Conformational mobility
profiles in the essential space of low frequency modes were obtained using ANM server119 and
DynOmics server.120

Local Structural Parameters : Relative Solvent Accessibility

We have computed the relative solvent accessibility parameter (RSA) that is defined as the ratio
of the absolute solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of that residue observed in a given
structure and the maximum attainable value of the solvent-exposed surface area for this
residue.121 According to this model, residues are considered to be solvent exposed if the ratio
value exceeds 50% and to be buried if the ratio is less than 20%. Analytical SASA is estimated
computationally using analytical equations and their first and second derivatives and was
computed using web server GetArea.121

Mutational Sensitivity Analysis and Alanine Scanning
To compute protein stability and binding free energy changes

in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

structures upon complex formation with ACE2 receptor and REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, we
conducted a systematic alanine scanning of protein residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1
domain. In addition, a complete mutational sensitivity analysis was done for binding free energy
hotspots and residues E406, K417, N439, K444, E484, F486, and N501 targeted by widely
circulating and antibody-escaping mutations. Alanine scanning and mutational sensitivity
profiling of protein residues was performed using BeAtMuSiC approach.122,123 If a free energy
change between a mutant and the wild type (WT) proteins ΔΔG= ΔG (MT)-ΔG (WT) > 0, the
mutation is destabilizing, while when ΔΔG <0 the respective mutation is stabilizing.
BeAtMuSiC approach is based on statistical potentials describing the pairwise inter-residue
distances, backbone torsion angles and solvent accessibilities, and

considers the effect of the

mutation on the strength of the interactions at the interface and on the overall stability of the
complex.122,123

The reported protein stability and binding free energy changes are based on

the ensemble averages of BeAtMuSiC values using equilibrium samples from

reconstructed

simulation trajectories.

Perturbation Response Scanning
Perturbation Response Scanning (PRS) approach124,125 was used to estimate residue response to
external forces applied systematically to each residue in the protein system. This approach has
successfully identified hotspot residues driving allosteric mechanisms in single protein domains
and large multi-domain assemblies.126-131 The implementation of this approach follows the
protocol originally proposed by Bahar and colleagues126,127 and was described in details in our

previous studies.96 In brief, through monitoring the response to forces on the protein residues,
the PRS approach can quantify allosteric couplings and determine the protein response in
functional movements. In this approach, it 3N × 3N Hessian matrix 𝑯 whose elements represent
second derivatives of the potential at the local minimum connect the perturbation forces to the
residue displacements. The 3N-dimensional vector 𝚫𝑹 of node displacements in response to 3Ndimensional perturbation force follows Hooke’s law 𝑭 = 𝑯 ∗ 𝜟𝑹. A perturbation force is applied
to one residue at a time, and the response of the protein system is measured by the displacement
vector ∆𝑹(𝑖) = 𝑯−𝟏 𝑭(𝒊)

that is then translated into N×N PRS matrix. The second derivatives

matrix 𝑯 is obtained from simulation trajectories for each protein structure, with residues
represented by 𝐶𝛼 atoms and the deviation of each residue from an average structure was
calculated by ∆𝐑𝑗 (𝑡) = 𝐑𝑗 (𝑡) − 〈𝐑𝑗 (𝑡)〉, and corresponding covariance matrix C was then
calculated by ∆𝐑∆𝐑𝑇 . We sequentially perturbed each residue in the

SARS-CoV-2 spike

structures by applying a total of 250 random forces to each residue to mimic a sphere of
randomly selected directions. The displacement changes, ∆𝑹𝒊 is a 3N-dimensional vector
describing the linear response of the protein and deformation of all the residues.
Using the residue displacements upon multiple external force perturbations, we compute the
magnitude of the response of residue k as

of a given residue node on the perturbations in other protein residues and can be used as proxy
for detecting allosteric regulatory hotspots in the interaction networks. In turn, the j th column

perturbations of all residues and its average is denoted as 〈(∆𝑹𝒊 )2 〉𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑜𝑟 .

The sensor profile

Network Modeling and Community Analysis
A graph-based representation of protein structures132,133 is used to represent residues as network
nodes and the inter-residue edges

to describe residue interactions.

The details of graph

construction using residue interaction cut-off strength ( I min ) were outlined in our previous
studies.96 We constructed the residue interaction networks using both dynamic correlations134
and coevolutionary residue couplings135 that yield robust network signatures of long-range
couplings and communications. The details of

this model were described in our previous

studies.135-137 The ensemble of shortest paths is determined from matrix of communication
distances by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.138 Network graph calculations were performed using
the python package NetworkX.139
The Girvan-Newman algorithm140-142 is used to identify local communities. An improvement of
Girvan-Newman method was implemented where all highest betweenness edges are removed
at each step of the protocol. The algorithmic details of this modified scheme were presented in
our recent study.143,144

The network parameters were computed using the python package

NetworkX139 and Cytoscape package for network analysis.145,146

Results and Discussion
Conformational Dynamics Profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD and Dissociated S1 Domain
Binding with ACE2 : Balancing Structural Rigidity and Plasticity at Binding Interfaces
Multiple CG-CABS simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 domain complexes with the
ACE2 host receptor were performed

to analyze similarities and differences in

th

conformational dynamics profiles of the RBD regions and specifically binding interface residues
(Figure 2). We combined CG-CABS simulations with atomistic reconstruction of simulation
trajectories to characterize regions of structural stability and plasticity at the ACE2 binding
interfaces and determine the effect of the complete S1 domain in the complex on flexibility of
the

interacting residues and functional RBD regions. To our knowledge this is the first

comparative computational analysis of S1 domain binding with ACE2 initiated to understand
structural and dynamic rearrangements of the S1 domain to form a stable monomeric complex
with ACE2. The conserved core of SARS-CoV-RBD consists of five antiparallel β strands
with three connecting α-helices (Figures 1,2). The central β strands

(residues 354-363, 389-

405, 423-436) in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are stable and, as expected, only small thermal
fluctuations were observed in these regions (Figure 2A). The anti-parallel β-sheets (β5 and β6)
(residues 451-454 and 492-495 in SARS-CoV-RBD) that anchor the RBM region to the central
core also displayed a significant stabilization in the complex with ACE2. The small α-helical
segments of the RBD (residues 349-353, 405-410, and 416-423) also displayed a significant
stability in simulations. These regions become even more rigidified in the complex formed by
the dissociated S1 domain (Figure 2B). Of special interest were the ACE2 induced changes in
the RBM region (residues 437–508) and particularly in a stretch of residues 471-503 involved in
multiple contacts with the ACE2 receptor. The overall similar RBM profiles in all systems were

seen but the greater stabilization of the interfacial residues in the ACE2 complex was observed
for the bound S1 domain structure (Figure 2A,B). The interfacial loop residues 436-455
containing

an important motif 444-KVGGNYNY-451

displayed significantly reduced

fluctuations. Among residues that experience a more pronounced stabilization in the complex
are K417, G446, Y449, Y453, L455, F456, Y473, A475, and G476 positions in the middle
segment of the RBM (Figure 2C-E). The analysis of the intermolecular contacts in the SARSCoV-2 RBD and S1 complexes with ACE2 (Supporting Information, Tables S1-S3) indicated
a significant number of RBM interactions formed by the middle segment of the interface (K417,
Y453, L455, F456, and Q493) with K31 and E35 of ACE2 which may explain a pronounced
stabilization of these positions in simulations. Indeed, K417 forms contacts with D30 and H34
hotspot ACE2 residues, L455 is involved in interactions with K31 and D30, and F456 forms
stabilizing contacts with D30, K31, and T27 ACE2 hotspots

(Supporting Information, Tables

S1-S3). Another group of residues in the RBM ridge involved in multiple binding contacts
included E484 and F486 sites that interact with K31, Q24, M82, and L79 of ACE2 (Supporting
Information, Tables S1-S3). Notably, this analysis showed that the interacting RBD motif 495YGFQPTNG-502 is involved in the most persistent interaction contacts with ACE2 that is
exemplified by stabilization of Y489, F490, Q493, Y495, G496, Q498, T500, and Y505 residues
(Figure 2). These RBD residues form the largest number of contacts with ACE2 (Supporting
Information, Tables S1-S3) and experienced the most significant stabilization in the complex
(Figure 2A,B). Importantly, not only these residues showed markedly reduced fluctuations, but
the large interfacial stretch of residues

across

entire binding interface (residues 486-

FNCYFPLQSYGFQ-498 ) including key Q493 and Q498 interacting sites exhibited even a
stronger stabilization in the complex formed by the dissociated S1 domain (Figure 2B).

id 7A91, 7A92 respectively). The stability profile for protein residues is shown as in (C) using a
coloring spectrum from blue to red to highlight changes from rigid to more flexible regions.

Structural maps of the conformational dynamics profiles highlighted these observations showing
a more uniform and broad stabilization of the RBD regions in the complex formed by the
dissociated S1 domain (Figure 2C-E). Although the overall fluctuation profile of the RBM
residues remained largely unchanged, we noticed small but important differences pointing to the
greater stability of the 495-YGFQPTNG-502 loop in the ACE2 complex with the dissociated
S1 domain. These observations are consistent with the latest structural studies showing that
ACE2 binding can induce disassembly of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and promote formation of
a stable dissociated monomeric S1 complex with ACE2 receptor.147 At the same time, a modest
mobility of the RBM positions N439, L452, T470, E484, Q498 and N501 was seen in the S1ACE2 complex (Figure 2B). Importantly, several of these positions N49, E484, and N501
correspond to sites that confer mutational variants with the increased binding to ACE2 and
elevated level of transmission and infectivity. The observed partial flexibility of this SARSCoV-2 RBM motif in the complex formed by the dissociated S1 domain may allow for tolerance
and adaptability of these sites to specific modifications resulting in the improved binding
affinity with ACE2.

We also report the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) ratio in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1
domain complexes with ACE2 that were obtained by averaging the SASA computations over the
simulation trajectories (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

The anti-parallel β-sheet regions

in the SARS-CoV-2 (residues 451-454 and 492-495) are deeply buried at the interface. The key
RBM residues in the central segment (K417, L456, F456, Y473, F490 and Q493) also showed
small RSA values, indicating that these positions are buried in the ACE2 complex. Of particular
interest were the average RSA values for functional sites E406, K417, N439, E484, and N501
that are central focus of our investigation. We found that E406, K417 and N439 showed
moderate RSA values (~20-30%) indicating that these positions could retain a certain degree of
plasticity in the RBD and S1 domain complexes with ACE2 (Supporting Information, Figure
S1).

The more extreme cases were exemplified by E484 that maintains significant solvent

exposure (RSA ~ 65%) in the ACE2 complexes, while N501 is largely buried with very small
RSA values (Supporting Information, Figure S1). However, conformational dynamics profiles
indicated that N501 may still maintain some level of plasticity in the ACE2 complex.
To compare

the differences in the local flexibility with experimental functional data, we

specifically analyzed a group of SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues L455, F456, S459, Q474, A475,
F486, F490, Q493 and P499 whose mutations to their SARS-CoV RBD counterpart positions
resulted in the abolished binding affinity.37 It could be noticed that in the S1 domain complex
with ACE2 these residues become appreciably more stable than residues from another group
(N439, L452, T470, E484, Q498, N501) that are more susceptible to affinity-improving
mutations. Functional studies showed that N439/R426, L452/K439, T470/N457, E484/P470,
Q498/Y484 and N501/T487 modifications of these

SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues to their

respective position in SARS-CoV-RBD can in fact result in the enhanced binding affinity for

ACE2.37 Our analysis allowed to capture these subtle differences showing that this group of
RBD residues may experience larger fluctuations (Figure 2A,B). Interestingly, these differences
become more evident only in the ACE2 complex with the dissociated S1 domain, suggesting
that the partial redistribution of mobility in the S1-ACE2 complex could provide more room for
structural adaptation of N439, E484, and N501 positions (Figure 2B). Hence, a moderate level
of residual fluctuations can be preserved even when RBM residues are involved in strong
stabilizing contacts with ACE2. Although E484 interacts with the K31 interaction hotspot
residue of hACE2, this residue retains a more significant degree of mobility and plasticity in the
RBM region which may be associated with the mutational variability and emergence of E484K
variant that can improve binding affinity with the host receptor. Interestingly, we found that
escape mutations and variants improving binding affinity with the ACE receptor may emerge in
sites that are moderately flexible in the S1-ACE2 complex. This suggested that although some
of these positions such as K417 and N501 are involved in multiple contacts with ACE2 there
should be a substantial energetic plasticity in the interaction network. According to our findings,
there may be more room for tolerant modifications of N439 and E484 positions, while potential
for favorable mutations at K417 and N501 sites could be more limited.
To summarize, the central finding of this analysis is that conformational dynamics profile for
the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD residues remained largely conserved among ACE2 complexes of the
S1-RBD and fully dissociated S1 domain. Another important observation is a consistent trend for
moderate residual mobility of RBD residues whose mutations may often lead to the enhanced
binding with ACE2. Conformational dynamics analysis also indicated that RBM residues
targeted by novel mutational variants may be adaptable and display a range of flexibility – from
more dynamic positions at N439 and E486 to more constrained K417 and N501 residues.

Essential Dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 S Complexes with ACE2 and the REGN-COV2
Cocktail Unveils Regulatory Roles of Functional Sites Targeted by Mutational Variants

and also

we performed PCA of trajectories derived

determined the essential slow modes using ENM

The reported functional dynamics profiles were averaged over the first three major

low frequency modes.

For comparison of ACE2-induced changes in the functional dynamics,

we first characterized the slow mode profiles for the unbound forms of the RBD and S1 domain
extracted from the crystal structures of the complexes (Figure 3A-C). For the unbound RBD
structure the local minima associated with local hinge points corresponded to W353, F374,
F400, L452, R466, Q493 and V510 residues. Some of these residues L452 and Q493 are
involved in the interactions in the complex and their immobilized hinge position in the unbound
form may be

important to induce the optimal inter-molecular association with ACE2.

Interestingly, none of the functional positions targeted by novel mutational variants that promote
infectivity and antibody resistance (E409, K417, N439, E484, and N501) corresponded to hinge
positions in the unbound RBD form. In fact, E484 residue is located in the moving region of the
unbound RBD structure in slow modes (Figure 3A). The unbound form of the dissociated S1
domain featured local hinge positions in residues F518 and V539, C538 and F592 (Figure
3B,C). Strikingly, these findings are consistent with our recent analysis of collective dynamics
in the open and closed forms of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer structures showing that these residues
correspond to major regulatory centers of functional motions and coordinate global
displacements of the S1 regions with respect to more rigid S2 subunit in distinct timer states.148

residues. The key functional residues E406, K417, N439, E484, and N501 are shown in spheres
colored according to the level of mobility in the low frequency slow modes.

Consistent with these studies, the functional movements of RBDs can be determined by the main
hinge centers located near F318, S591, F592, V539 residues. These results highlighted the
conserved nature of global hinges in the dissociated S1 domain and in the SARS-CoV-2 S
complete trimer. Notably, the RBD residues targeted by novel mutational variants are located in
the flexible moving regions of the unbound S1 domain.

The distribution of hinge sites is

altered in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2, and strikingly the sites subjected to
circulating variants and escape mutations often coincided with hinge clusters anchored by E406,
K417, N439 and N501 residues (Figure 3D). E484 is located near F486 that is aligned with
another local hinge position, while N501 together with T500 and Y505 can form a dominant
hinge center in the complex. Hence, a group of functional residues that include N439, F486,
T500, N501 and Y505 sites may form a network of regulatory centers coordinating global
movements of the RBD and ACE2 molecules. These findings are in line with studies of
conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein in complex with
ACE2 revealing these positions may be involved in regulation of continuous swing motions of
ACE2-RBD relative to the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer.33
The slow mode profiles obtained for complexes of the dissociated S1 domain with ACE2 further
highlighted the role of these functional residues in collective motions (Figure 3E,F). The entire

become largely immobilized in the S1 domain complex with ACE2 complex, while C-terminal
domain 2, CTD2 region (residues 592-686) can undergo large movements (Figure 3F). By
zooming on the RBD regions, one could see that local minima and corresponding hinge sites are
almost precisely aligned with residues E406, K417, N501 and Y505. Hence, the RBD residues
targeted by mutant variants may play an important role in coordinating the relative orientation
and approach angle of the ACE2 receptor in the complex, and consequently affect recognition
and signal transmission in the functional complex. Structural maps of functional dynamics
profiles illustrated these findings showing that the RBD regions that include functional positions
E406, N439 and N501 are aligned with immobilized in slow motions hinge centers, while K417
and E484 residues could be less constrained during collective movements (Figure 3G-I). The
central finding of this analysis is the unique role that positions targeted by novel variants (N439,
N501) and escape mutations (E406) could play in concerted functional movements of S-RBD
and S1 domain when bound to ACE2. Based on the results we argue that functional role of
these sites in controlling global motions and long-range interactions in ACE2 complexes could
be an important reason for mediating escape from antibody binding while maintaining and
enhancing binding with the host receptor.
To compare the slow mode profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD complexes with ACE2 and
neutralizing antibodies, we performed ENM-based modeling of slow mode profiles in the SRBD complex with REGN-COV2 cocktail of two antibodies REGN-10933 and REGN10987
(Figure 4). This analysis showed that sites E406 and K417

corresponded to local hinge

positions, while N439 and K444/G446 residues are now aligned with the dominant hinge center
of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with the REGN-COV2 cocktail (Figure 4A).

Importantly, antibody binding altered dynamic role of residues E484 and N501 that become
aligned with moving regions in the collective dynamics of the complex (Figure 4A). Structural
mapping of the essential profiles further illustrated this point, showing that functionally
immobilized in collective motions hinge centers are localized near E406, N439 and K444 sites,
while E484 and N501 positions could undergo some movements in the complex (Figure 4B).
In this context it is particularly interesting to compare our observations with functional studies
showing that K417 and F486 are sites of escape from RERGN10933, while mutations in K444
and G446 escape neutralization by REGN10987 and E406 is a unique site susceptible to
mutations escaping both antibodies.70 In line with these experiments, we found that E406 and
K444 positions may correspond to the antibody-specific unique hinge centers of collective
motions

that control relative orientation and rigid body movements of REGN10933 and

REGN10987 molecules (Figure 4B). This is in some contrast to SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes
with ACE2 in which N439 and N501 form the major hinge center of functional dynamics. As a
result, it is possible that mutations in K444 and E406 positions may perturb not only local
interactions with antibody molecules but alter the global collective movements and long-range
communication which may be sufficient to trigger mutational escape from antibody binding. At
the same time, these mutations could only moderately change the SARS-CoV-2 RBD local
interactions with ACE2 without affecting the collective movements in the complex.
To summarize, this analysis suggested that mutational variants and escape mutations may
preferentially target specific positions involved in regulation and coordination of functional
dynamics motions and allosteric changes in the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with ACE2 and REGNCOV2 antibody cocktail.

Mutational Sensitivity Profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Binding Interfaces Reveals
Energetic Plasticity in Sites Susceptible to Circulating Mutational Variants and Antibody
Escaping Modifications
We first performed a systematic alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV RBD S protein residues
(Figure 5A) and residues from the dissociated S1 domain in the complexes with the ACE2 host
receptor (Figure 5B,C). Using the equilibrium ensembles obtained from simulation trajectories,
we evaluated the average cumulative mutational effect of alanine substitutions on protein
stability and binding affinity with the host receptor. The alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD residues highlighted a significant destabilization effect caused by mutations of G446,
Y453, L455, F456, F486, Y489, Y495, T500, and Y505 residues (Figure 5A). These residues
also corresponded to the binding free energy hotspots in the complexes formed by the dissociated
S1 domain with ACE2 (Figure 5B,C). In particular, large destabilization effects were observed
upon mutations of Y453, L455, F456, Y489, and F490 residues in the S1-ACE2 complexes.
Notably, the largest destabilization changes were produced by alanine mutations of F456 and
Y489 residues, displaying clear and pronounced peaks of the profile and pointing to these
positions as key binding affinity hotspots in the S1-ACE2 complexes. (Figure 5B,C). Several key
binding energy hotspot sites (Y453, Y489, and Y505) are conserved between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 proteins and are located in the central segment of the interface. A detailed
analysis of the intermolecular contacts in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 complexes with ACE2
aided in understanding of the binding energy

preferences of RBD residues (Supporting

Information, Tables S1-S3). This analysis is particularly instructive by considering contact
distributions with two virus-binding hotspots on ACE2 formed by interacting residues K31 and
E35 as well as K353 and D38.

In particular, Y489 residue makes numerous favorable contacts with multiple ACE2 residues
K31, F28, Y873, L79 and T27 residues, while another hotspot position F456 forms interactions
with T27, D30 and K31 positions on ACE2 (Supporting Information, Tables S1-S3). L455
residue of the RBD makes favorable contacts with the key hotspots on ACE2 K31, H34, and D30
while Q493 contacts K31, H34 and E35 positions. The hydrophobic residue F486 forms
multiple interactions with M82, L79, Y83, Q24, while another hydrophobic RBD site F490
interacts with K31 and Y473 with T27 (Supporting Information, Tables S1-S3).

Overall, the

alanine scanning highlighted the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD interactions formed by
the middle segment of the RBM interface (K417, Y453, L455, F456, Y489 and Q493) as
mutations of these residues resulted in a significant loss of binding affinity (Figure 5A-C). These
results are consistent with recent functional studies, indicating that mutations of the SARSCoV-2 RBD residues (L455/Y442, F456/L443, F486/L472, F490/W476, Q493/N479) result in a
significant reduction of their binding affinity with ACE2.37
The alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues in the complex with REGN-COV2
antibody cocktail revealed large destabilization effects and strong peaks at positions K444,
V445, F456, F486, and Y489 ((Supporting Information, Table S4, Figure 5D). The largest free
energy changes exceeding 3 kcal/mol were observed for alanine modifications of F456 and
F486 residues which is consistent with the prominent role these residues play in eliciting
antibody-escaping mutations.70

We also specifically highlighted binding free energy changes

caused by alanine modifications in sites targeted by circulating and antibody-escaping variants

and N501 positions (Figure 5A-C). A slightly different pattern was seen in the RBD-REGNCOV2

complex where alanine modifications in K417, N439 and E484 residues led to

appreciable > 1.0 kcal/mol binding free energy loss, while mutations in E406 and N501 positions
produced only small destabilization effect. These patterns indicated that antibody binding may
induce changes in the binding interactions and distribution of the binding energy hotspots.
To further quantify the effects of the binding energy hotspots, we followed up with a complete
mutational sensitivity analysis of these RBD positions (Figure 6). The profiling showed that all
mutations in Y453, F456, F486 and Y505 positions were highly destabilizing (Figure 6A-D),

for L455 and F490 positions

Consistent with the deep mutational scanning experiments35,66 we found that E406, N439, and
E484 sites are energetically adaptable and can effectively tolerate different mutations without
incurring significant changes in protein stability and binding affinity (Figure 7 A,C,D).
Somewhat larger but still relatively tolerable were binding free energy changes induced by
mutations in K417 and N501 positions (Figure 7B,E). K417 is a unique ACE2-interacting
residue that forms favorable contacts with central residues of the ACE2 interface H34 and D30
(Supporting Information, Table S1-S3). However, an appreciable energetic plasticity could be
seen in mutational sensitivity profiling of K417 residue (Figure 7B). Although K417 mutations
to alanine or glycine produced fairly significant destabilization changes, K417N and K417D
mutations led to only small perturbations (~0.4-0.5 kcal/mol). Indeed, deep mutational scanning
suggests that the K417N mutation has minimal impact on binding affinity with ACE2.35
The results also predicted the marginal improvement in the binding free energy mediated by
E484K mutation and only very modest increase in the binding affinity upon K417N modification
(Figure 7D). The experimental studies indicated that the E484K mutation

may induce

a

moderate improvement in binding affinity and showed that other single mutations of E484 may
only slightly compromise spike folding stability and binding affinity for ACE2.35,70 According
to our analysis, several hydrophobic substitutions in this position (E484I, E484V, E484F,
E484W, and E484P) may in fact lead to the moderately improved affinity, while other mutations
appeared to

produce only marginal destabilization (Figure 7D). These results indicated a

significant plasticity of this important RBD position that is relatively exposed and may favor
hydrophobic residues in this position to improve both stability and binding. The mutational
sensitivity profiling at N501 position is

consistent with deep mutational scanning

experiments35,66 reproducing the improvements in binding mediated by N501F and N501Y

mutations (Figure 7E). Indeed, deep mutation scanning showed that N501F, N501T and N501Y
mutations may lead to moderate enhancement of binding with ACE2, while N501D is an
affinity-decreasing mutation.35 We observed only a small destabilization effect for N501T and
more significant destabilization upon N501D and N501A/G mutations (Figure 7E). Importantly,
these results supported the notion that N501Y mutational variant could be beneficial for ACE2
binding, while escaping neutralizing antibodies targeting the same region.

We also performed mutational sensitivity analysis of the key functional positions in the SARSCoV-2 RBD complex the REGN-COV2 (Figure 8A-D). The results revealed moderate
changes upon mutations at E406, E484, N501 and N439 positions. Interestingly, although
E406W escaped both individual REGN-COV2 antibodies,70

our results

indicate that this

mutation would not drastically perturb the RBD region and significantly affect binding
interactions with the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail (Figure 8A). Hence, antibody-escaping
effect of E406W substitution may not be trivially linked to the local interaction effects. In this
context, given the results of functional dynamics analysis, it is tempting to argue that mutations
at E406 position may instead alter collective movements and compromise long-range allosteric
couplings in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. This may ultimately affect neutralization activity of the
REGN-COV2 antibody combination. At the same time, a wide range of modifications at K417,
K444 and F486 sites resulted in significant destabilization changes and loss of the binding
affinity (Figure 8E-G). These results are in excellent agreement with functional mapping of the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues that affect binding of the REGN-COV2 cocktail showing that F486
mutations are predominant for escaping neutralization by REGN10933 and mutations at K444
evade binding of REGN10987 antibody.70

Consistent with the functional analysis of the immune-selected mutational landscape in the S
protein, we found that a wide spectrum of K444 modifications induced a significant loss of
binding free energy (Figure 8E) including K444E and K444N mutations that showed a broadrange resistance against multiple antibodies.69 The large destabilization changes caused by F486
mutations can be contrasted to fairly small changes incurred by E484 mutations, indicating that
E484 site is characterized by sufficient level of structural plasticity and energetic adaptability to
readily accommodate mutations in complexes with ACE2 and REGN-COV2 cocktail. These
findings may explain why single-site mutations of these residues can only slightly change
binding affinity for ACE2 and folding stability, while double-site mutations of proximal E484
and F486 can significantly weaken the fitness of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region and binding.66
To summarize, our results pointed to several interesting trends. First, mutational sensitivity
profiling of the conserved hydrophobic binding energy hotspots Y453, L455, F456, F486, and
Y505 consistently yielded large destabilization changes affecting folding stability and binding
to ACE2 receptor, making these positions unlikely candidates for antibody escaping mutations as
even small modifications in these positions could have a severe detrimental effect on the spike
activity. Second, we found that SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity could be strongly influenced by
the virus-binding hotspot K31 and H34 in the middle of the interface through an extensive
interaction network with K417, Y453, L455, F456, and Q493 residues. Finally, mutational
analysis of K417, E484 and N501 positions implicated in new mutational strains and antibodyescaping changes showed that these residues correspond to important interacting centers with
a significant degree of structural and energetic plasticity. Indeed, N501Y, E484K and K417N
mutations can result in the improved or only slightly decreased affinity with ACE2. These results
suggest a hypothesis that antibody-escaping mutations target residues with sufficient plasticity

and adaptability to preserve a sufficient spike activity while having a more detrimental effect
on antibody recognition. These findings are particularly interesting in light of recent

functional

studies66 showing that escape mutations target a subset of sites in the antibody-RBD interfaces
corresponding to binding energy hotspots. Importantly, these experiments suggested that escape
mutations are consistently those that have significant deleterious effects on antibody binding
but little negative impact on ACE2 binding and RBD folding. Based on our findings, we argue
that escape mutations constrained by the requirements for ACE2 binding and preservation of
RBD stability may preferentially select structurally plastic and energetically adaptable allosteric
centers at the key interfacial regions to compromise antibody recognition through modulation of
global motions and allosteric interactions in the complex.

Perturbation Response Scanning

Reveals Structurally Adaptable Allosteric Effector

Hotspots in Sites Targeted by Global Circulating Mutations
Using the PRS method124-127 we quantified the allosteric effect of each residue in the SARSCoV-2 complexes in response to external perturbations.

The effector profiles estimate the

propensities of a given residue to influence dynamic changes in other residues and can be
applied to identify regulatory hotspots of allosteric interactions as the local maxima along the
profile. First, we computed the residue-based effector response profiles for the SARS-CoV-2
RBD complex with ACE2 (Figure 9A) and the complexes formed by the dissociated S1 domain
with ACE2 (Figure 9B,C). By comparing the PRS profiles in the ACE2 complexes with SARSCoV-2 S1/RBD and REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail, we determined the distribution of
regulatory allosteric centers and highlighted a potential role of sites targeted by global circulating
mutations.

Strikingly, the effector profile of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2 featured two
major peaks corresponding to residues E606 and T500/N501, indicating that E406 and N501
positions are aligned with the regulatory centers that may control allosteric communications in
the complex (Figure 9A). Several other notable peaks corresponded to W353, K417, N439 and
L452 residues. Hence, all known positions targeted by novel circulating mutational variants
with the exception of E484 corresponded to the effector peaks and are involved in coordination
of allosteric communications in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2. Moreover, the
effector profiles indicated that these regulatory sites may function in a coordinated manner and
maintain an allosteric cross-talk to

control signal transmission “traffic” and long-range

interactions in the RBD-ACE2 complex. Interestingly, several of these effector centers L452,
N439 and N501 were among SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues whose mutations to the SARS-CoV
RBD counterparts N439/R426, L452/K439, and N501/T487 enhanced the binding affinity.37
The prominent role of these residues as regulatory effector centers becomes even more apparent
in the S1 domain complexes with ACE2 (Figure 9B,C). It is evident that E406, K417, N439 and
especially N501 positions corresponded to sharp peaks of the effector profile. This implies that
these sites may be collectively responsible for coordination of long-range communication in the
system. The central result of this analysis is that circulating and escape mutations appeared to
target residues corresponding to structurally and energetically adaptable regulatory control points
that can tolerate individual mutations and often enhance ACE2 binding, while at the same time
allowing for coordinated modulation of allosteric communications. We suggest that allosteric
signaling in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with ACE2 is adaptable where a mutation of a
regulatory control point can be functionally compensated through energetic rebalancing of
structurally plastic allosteric hotspots.

preferences of the RBD residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 complexes with ACE2.
The residue-based distance fluctuation communication indexes measure the energy cost of the
dynamic residue deformations and could serve as a robust metric for assessment of allosteric
propensities of protein residues.153-155 In this model, dynamically correlated residues whose
effective distances fluctuate with low or moderate intensity are expected to communicate with
the higher efficiency than the residues that experience large fluctuations. Notably, structurally
stable and densely interconnected residues as well as moderately flexible residues that serve as a
source or sink of allosteric signals could feature high value of these indexes.
The distance fluctuation profile of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 domain complexes with ACE2
showed a small but important redistriubution of major peaks, pointing to sites E406, W436,
N439, N501 and Y505 (Figure 9D). Notably, this group of residues is featured prominently
among peaks of the profile when the entire S1 domain monomer forms complex with ACE2
(Figure 9E,F). We also noticed that the overall shape and distribution of the peaks are similar
between the PRS effector profiles and distance fluctuation communication indexes profiles.
Notably, E406, N439 and N501 sites were featured as recurring peaks in both distributions,
strengening the proposed notion that positions targted by the emerging mutational variants can
cooperate and play a central role in regulation of long-range couplings and allosteric
communications in the complexes with the ACE2 host receptor. Hence, the distance fluctuation
profiling and analysis of communication indexes provide important supporting evidence to the
PRS modeling, suggesting that structurally stable positions and potential allosteric hotspot

residues only partially overlap, and allosteric hubs may exhibit a certain degree of structural
plasticity and energetic adaptability to enable balance between binding and signaling function.
To understand a potential role of the E484 residue, it is instructive to analyze the PRS sensor
profile (Supporting Information, Figure S2).

A comparison between sensor profiles obtained

for the unbound and bound forms of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD showed that E484 position is
aligned with the dominant peak of the sensor profile in the unbound form (Supporting
Information, Figure S2A). Interestingly, in the complex with ACE2, this site also corresponded
to a major sensor peak at the binding interface (Supporting Information, Figure S2B). Structural
mapping of sensor profiles in the unbound and bound RBD forms illustrated these observations,
pointing to role of E484 residue as a major receiver site of allosteric signaling in the RBD-ACE2
complex (Supporting Information, Figure S2C,and D).

Hence, the PRS analysis of the RBD-

ACE2 and S1-ACE2 complexes demonstrated that while E406, K417, N439 an N501 are
aligned with dominant effector positions representing source and regulatory points of allosteric
signaling, E484 corresponded to a major sensor/receiver site that may absorb signal information.
Collectively, these sites may represent key nodes of the allosteric interaction network in the
functional ACE2-bound complexes and determine the robustness and efficiency of signal
transmission.
We also computed the PRS effector profiles for the SARS-RBD complex with REGN-COV2
antibody combination (Figure 10). The effector profile revealed some redistribution of peaks,
featuring V401/E406, N439, K444/G446 and G496 positions as major effector centers (Figure
10A). At the same time, residues E484/F486 and N501 were aligned with the local sensor peaks
(Figure 10B). These results could provide a feasible rationale for a critical role of K444 and
F486 positions in escaping antibody combinations.

Indeed,

K444 is a central epitope residue for REG10987 while F486 residue is fundamental

for recognition of REG10933 antibody.70 Our findings also indicated that E406 and K444 are
the dominant effector centers in the RBD complex with REGN-COV2 (Figure 10A) and may be
functionally important not only for binding affinity but also for mediating signaling and longrange communications in the complex. In the context of perturbation-based PRS model, this
implies that

single mutations

at these positions could affect

collective movements and

allosteric couplings between many residues in the system and potentially compromise functional
activity of the REGN-COV2 cocktail. Interestingly, other positions targeted by antibodyescaping mutants E484 and F486 are the major sensor sites (Figure 10B). Based on these
observations, we suggest that allosteric control of the RBD-REGN COV2 complex is provided
through a cross-talk between major effector sites (E406, K444) and receiver sites (E484 and
F486).
To summarize, perturbation-based modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes

suggested

that functional residues targeted by global circulating variants and antibody-escaping mutants
could form a network of structurally adaptable allosteric hotspots that collectively coordinate
allosteric interactions in the system. These results bear some significance and support the latest
illuminating study suggesting a model functional plasticity and evolutionary adaptation of
allosteric regulation.156

This function-centric model of allostery revealed a remarkable

functional plasticity of allosteric switches allowing modulate and restore regulatory activity
through mutational combinations or ligand interactions. Our results similarly suggested that
functional plasticity and cross-talk of allosteric control points in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region
can allow for differential modulation of

recognition and long-range communication with

ACE2 and antibodies.

Network Modeling Reveals that Sites Targeted by Circulating Mutations are Mediating
Anchors of the Intermolecular Communities with ACE2 and REGN-COV2 Antibodies
Mechanistic network-based models allow for a quantitative analysis of allosteric molecular
events in which conformational landscapes of protein systems can be remodeled by various
perturbations such as mutations, ligand binding, or interactions with other proteins. The residue
interaction networks in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes with ACE2 and REGN-COV2
antibodies were built using a graph-based representation of protein structures in which residue
nodes are interconnected

through both dynamic134 and coevolutionary correlations.135 Using

community decomposition, the residue interaction networks were further divided into local stable
interaction modules in which residues are densely interconnected and highly correlated during
simulations, while different communities are connected through long-range couplings.
Using this network-centric description of residue interactions, we compared the organization of
stable local communities in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes with ACE2 (Figure 11) and
REGN-COV2 cocktail (Figure 12). In the RBD-ACE2 and S1-ACE2 complexes we found a
deeply interconnected community organization (Figure 11) where stable modules in the RBD
core are tightly linked

with the interfacial clusters.

A number of stable intramolecular

communities in the RBD core contribute to stability of the RBD regions. Some of these
communities are formed by hydrophobic core residues including F342-V511-F374-W436F347-R509 , W353-F400-Y423 as well as

E406-Q409-I418 and N439-443-P499 centered

around functional residues E406 and N439 (Figure 11). Of particular interest an importance was
a more detailed comparative analysis of the inter-molecular communities. In the RBD-ACE2 and
S1-ACE2 complexes, these modules are integrated around key anchor residues K417, F456,
Y489, N501, and Y505. The largest and most stable community in which each node is strongly

linked with each other is centered on N501 (K353-D38-Y41-Q498-N501-Y505) and engaged
ACE2 hotspots K353, D38, and Y41 (Figure 11A). This interfacial module anchored by N501
allows for persistent interactions by N501, Y505 and Q498 RBD residues. Moreover, this
community may be instrumental for signal transmission between RBD and ACE2 molecules,
highlighting the important role of N501 position. By introducing N501Y mutation, we rebuilt
the residue interaction network and

performed community decomposition which revealed

preservation of this major community. This observation supported our energetic analysis
indicating structural plasticity and stability of the key intermolecular communities in the RBDACE2 complex.

Another group of interfacial communities is anchored by K417 and F456 positions that couple
modules

Y489-F456-K31

and

D30-K417-F456

(Figure

11B).

Interestingly,

these

intermolecular communities are directly coupled through K417 with the intramolecular module
I402-I418-E406-Y495-Q409 centered

on

the

E406 residue.

Hence, the community

organization revealed strong interconnectivity between key functional sites E406, K417, F456,
and N501 that integrate the residue interaction network and enable allosteric couplings between
RBD and ACE2 molecules. The important revelation of this analysis is that only a fraction of
the RBD residues anchor the intermolecular community organization and mediate long-range
interactions in the RBD-ACE2 complex. Furthermore, the binding free energy hotspots are not
necessarily involved in community-mediating function. Instead, a group of structurally plastic
allosteric centers such as E406, K417, F456, and N501 play key roles in integrating local
communities into a robust and adaptable global network that can mediate signal transmission and
communication between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2.

residues of ACE2. The community residues are shown in spheres and annotated. Notably, these
two major intermolecular communities that mediate communications and stability of the
interface include several key functional sites K417, F456,

E484, and N501 targeted by

mutational variants and antibody-escaping mutations.

The REGN-COV2 antibody binding induced a partial and yet significant reorganization of the
interface communities (Figure 12A). We found that key RBD residues F486, Y489 and K417
anchor major intermolecular communities with REGN10933 including R100-Y50-F486-W47L94, Y32-T102-K417 and Y33-T52-Y489 (Figure 12B). Interestingly, K417 and another site of
escape mutations E406 are inter-connected in the local RBD community E406-Q409-K417I418. E484 is involved in formation of the inter-molecular contacts with T52, Y53, T57, Y59
residues of the heavy chain of REGN10933 and could bridge several interfacial communities
anchored by F486 and Y489 residues.

Among major interfacial communities formed by the

RBD with REGN10987 is W99-W47-V445-K444-Y59 module in which V445 and K444 play a
key role in mediating intermolecular communication. Another notable community is anchored by
T500 which engages N439, P499, K444 residues of the RBD and W99 of the heavy chain of
REGN10987 (Figure 12B). These findings are consistent with the experimental deep mutational
screening showing that K444 is a critical RBD residue for REGN10987, while F486 and Y489
sites are essential in
mutations F486I

inducing activity of REGN10933.

According to these experiments,

and Y489H escape REGN10933 and E484A/F486I combinations

evade

REGN10933. Interestingly, it was also established that mutations at F486 escaped neutralization
only by REGN10933, whereas mutations of N439 and K444 escaped neutralization only by
REGN10987.

E406 site is at the center of the largest intramolecular community in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(R403-Y453-V350-I418-N422-Y423-Y495-F497-E406-Q409) that connects the inter-molecular
interfaces with the RBD core (Supporting Information, Figure S3). This site could anchor large
communities in the core with the interfacial regions facing both antibodies. Based on these
observations, we suggested that unique escape mutations in E406 position may be largely
determined by its allosteric mediating role in interconnecting functional regions of the RBD.
Given the fact that E406 is only involved in several contacts with T28 of REGN10933, the
strong mutational escape effect may be mainly driven by long-range allosteric effects and
attributed to the strategic position of this residue in the global network. Noticeably, E406 is
closely connected with Y453 residue where another REGN10933 specific escape-mutant Y453F
was detected.70 Another key member of this community is F497 that effectively bridges local
intermolecular modules interacting with REGN10933 and REGN10987 antibodies (Supporting
Information, Figure S3). Recent studies indicated that SARS-CoV-2 neighbor residues G496 and
F497 are critical for the RBD–ACE2 interaction and F497 may play important role for enhancing
the RBD–ACE2 interaction for SARS-Cov-2 RBD. Our network analysis quantifies the
structural hypothesis offered in the experimental study according to which
mutation may affect

E406 escape

recognition by REGN10987 through cascading effect onto adjacent

structural elements across the RBD and propagating changes through aromatic residues Y453,
Y495, and F497.70 Importantly, network analysis revealed that these hydrophobic residues
belong to the tightly packed stable community anchored by the E406 residue.

Owing to the

modular interconnectivity where each of these residues is connected with every community
neighbor, it is likely that E406W mutation may simultaneously perturb multiple contacts and
alter couplings between these residues, thus adversely affecting the fidelity of allosteric

communication with REGN10987. Hence,

although this residue makes no persistent contacts

with either of the interacting antibodies, its position in the largest community anchored by E406
could be important for integrity of the network organization in the complex with antibodies.
The network analysis showed that not only these residues are involved in favorable contacts
with these antibodies but they also define key regulatory nodes that mediate stability and
connectivity of the inter-molecular communities and may be responsible for control of signal
transmission between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and REGN10933/REGN10987 antibodies. In
agreement with functional data, the network community analysis singled out N439, K444, F486
and Y489 sites as allosteric network hubs where mutations would result in weakening of the
entire interface and compromise the efficiency of allosteric interactions.
Conclusions
This integrative computational investigation combined molecular simulations and functional
dynamics analysis with mutational energetic profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding
and

network-based community modeling to delineate

specific allosteric signatures of

functionally important residues that are subjected to novel circulating variants. A comparative
perturbation-based modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes with ACE2 and REGN-COV2
antibody combination revealed several important trends and characterized the unique allostericcentric signatures of functional RBD residues. First, we found that the RBM residues targeted
by novel mutational variants may be fairly structurally adaptable and display a range of
flexibility – from more dynamic positions at N439 and E486 to more constrained K417 and
N501 residues.

Functional dynamics analysis of global motions and identification of major

hinge centers in the SARS-CoV-2 S complexes demonstrated that these sites play a central role
in regulation of collective movements and long-range couplings, explaining why mutations in

55

these positions could escape from antibody binding while maintaining and enhancing binding
with the host receptor. Through comprehensive mutational scanning and sensitivity analysis of
the SARS-CoV-2 RBD residues in the studied complexes, we accurately reproduced the binding
affinity changes for N501Y, E484K and K417N mutations. Moreover, this analysis strongly
indicated that these residues correspond to important interacting centers with a significant
degree of structural and energetic plasticity. As a result, we proposed a model according to
which circulating variants and antibody-escaping mutations tend to target residues with sufficient
plasticity and adaptability to

preserve a sufficient spike activity while

having a more

detrimental effect on antibody recognition. Our results also suggested that these functionally
important for spike activity residues correspond to structurally plastic and energetically
adaptable allosteric centers involved in modulation of global motions and allosteric interactions
in the complexes. Using PRS analysis and community modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 S
complexes, we characterized signatures of functional residues implicated in novel variants and
demonstrated that these sites form a network of energetically adaptable regulatory centers
modulating long-range communication of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD regions with ACE2 and
antibodies. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 S protein may function as a versatile and
functionally adaptable allosteric machine that exploits plasticity of allosteric regulatory centers
to generate escape mutants that fine-tune response to antibody binding without compromising
activity of the spike protein. This study provides a novel insight into allosteric regulatory
mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, showing that antibodies can modulate allosteric
interactions and signaling of spike proteins,

providing a plausible strategy for therapeutic

intervention by targeting specific hotspots of allosteric interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
