Abstract

27

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent for

28

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged as an ongoing global pandemic. Presently,

29

there are no clinically approved vaccines nor drugs for COVID-19. Hence, there is an urgent

30

need to accelerate the development of effective antivirals. Here in, we discovered Clioquinol (5-

31

chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol (CLQ)), a FDA approved drug and two of its analogues (7-bromo-5-

32

chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLBQ14); and 5, 7-Dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLCQ)) as potent

33

inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect in vitro. In addition, all three

34

compounds showed potent anti-exopeptidase activity against recombinant human angiotensin

35

converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) and inhibited the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike

36

(RBD) protein. CLQ displayed the highest potency in the low micromolar range, with its antiviral

37

activity showing strong correlation with inhibition of rhACE2 and rhACE2-RBD interaction.

38

Altogether, our findings provide a new mode of action and molecular target for CLQ and

39

validates this pharmacophore as a promising lead series for clinical development of potential

40

therapeutics for COVID-19.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel RNA

55

betacoronavirus, is the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has

56

emerged as an ongoing global pandemic1. Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rampantly to

57

more than 188 countries/regions and has resulted in 18,847,261 confirmed cases, 11,390,018

58

recovered, including 708,540 deaths (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Within the United

59

States alone, there are more than 4,825,742 cases, 1,577,851 recovered and a total of 158,300

60

deaths as of August 6th, 2020 according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard. About

61

80% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic2;

62

while a majority of symptomatic patients with moderate to severe symptoms have shown a

63

broad range of clinical manifestation and/or significant complications, including severe

64

pneumonia, multi-organ failure, acute cardiac injury, neurological damage, septic shock, acute

65

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)3–6. Recent reports revealed that, individuals with pre-

66

existing medical conditions have increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality7.

67

Currently, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for the

68

treatment of COVID-19; but several studies are investigating the potential utility of repurposing

69

clinically approved drugs as treatment options for COVID-198-12. To date, only Remdesivir, an

70

inhibitor of RNA dependent RNA Polymerase has been granted emergency use authorization

71

(EUA) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe cases of COVID-1913.

72

Historically, Clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinolinol (CLQ)) and its derivatives belonging

73

to the 8-hydroxyquinoline structural class, has shown potent broad-spectrum activity against

74

clinically relevant pathogens14-20. More recently, CLQ and its analogues have been extensively

75

investigated as potential treatments for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases21-28. Additional

76

studies have also shown the involvement of CLQ in the efflux mechanisms of ATP binding

77

cassette (ABC) transporters29,30 and the cellular autophagic pathway31,32, a critical process in the

78

host defense machinery against viral infections33. Furthermore, using a high-throughput screen

79

(HTS) and chemical genomics approach, Olaleye, O., et. al. identified and characterized CLQ

80

and certain analogues as potent inhibitors of methionine aminopeptidase17, a universally

81

conserved metalloprotease required for N-terminal methionine excision34,35. As an established

82

metal chelator and zinc ionophore, CLQ modulates underlying molecular and physiologic

83

machinery required for metal homeostatis 31, 32, 36-39. Altogether, these pharmacologic properties

84

of CLQ, makes it an attractive drug for potential targeting of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2

85

(ACE2).

86

ACE2 is a zinc metalloprotease and essential cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry

87

into host cells40-43. Therefore, rapid identification of potent and selective ACE2 inhibitors have

88

the prospects of accelerating the clinical development of preventative interventions and/or

89

treatment options for COVID-19. ACE2 is mainly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells of the

90

lungs, heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract44,45. Although, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for

91

SARS-CoV-2 40-43; ACE2 primarily functions as a carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the

92

conversion of a single residue from angiotensin (Ang II), generating L-phenylalanine and Ang

93

(1-7), a potent vasodilator, thus playing a critical role in controlling hypertension, renal disease,

94

cardiac function and lung injury46,47. The crystalline structure of the ACE2 shows two domains; a

95

N-terminal zinc metallopeptidase domain (MPD) capable of binding the viral envelope-anchored

96

Spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses, and a C terminal “collectrin-like” domain48-50. The

97

interaction of the MPD of ACE2 and S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the initial and critical step

98

in viral infection by receptor recognition and fusion of host and viral cellular membranes40-43. In

99

addition, viral entry requires priming of S protein by a host protease into S1 and S2 subunits,

100

which are responsible for receptor attachment and membrane fusion, respectively51-54. A

101

receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit specifically recognizes ACE2 on human

102

cells40-43. Binding of the S1 subunit to ACE2 receptor triggers a conformational change in S

103

glycoprotein from metastable pre-fusion state to stable post-fusion conformation, resulting in

104

shedding of S1 and transition of the S2 subunit to expose a hydrophobic fusion peptide42,55,56.

105

The initial priming at S1/S2 boundary promotes subsequent cleavage at the S2 site by host

106

proteases, which is critical for membrane fusion and viral infectivity54,57,58. Therefore, targeting

107

the interaction between human ACE2 receptor and the RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 could

108

serve as a promising approach for the development of effective entry inhibitors for potential

109

prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19.

110

In this study, we evaluated the effect of CLQ, and two of its analogues (7-bromo-5-

111

chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLBQ14); and 5, 7-Dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (CLCQ)) on SARS-

112

CoV-2 infection induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in vitro. In addition, we assessed the

113

cytotoxicity of these compounds. Furthermore, we determined the impact of all three

114

compounds on recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) interaction with the RBD on Spike protein

115

of SARS-CoV-2; and independently assessed their effects on the exopeptidase activity of

116

rhACE2. Here in, we discovered for the first time that CLQ, CLBQ14 and CLCQ effectively

117

inhibits the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE in vitro, inhibited rhACE2 and its

118

interaction with Spike protein and rhACE2 exopeptidase activity in the low micromolar range.

119

Thus, rapid optimization and pre-clinical development of CLQ and its congeners could

120

potentially accelerate their consideration for re-purposing as potential antiviral agents against

121

COVID19, first in non-human primate (NHP) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and

122

subsequently in clinical trials.

media to each well. The plates were passed into the BSL-3 facility where a 25µL aliquot of virus

160

innoculated cells (4000 Vero E6 cells/well) was added to each well in columns 3-22. The wells

161

in columns 23-24 contained virus infected cells only (no compound treatment). Prior to virus

Biochemical Screening Assays

186

ACE2 Inhibitor Screening Assay

187

An ACE2 Inhibitor screening assay kit with fluorogenic substrate (Catalogue #79923) was

188

purchased from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA), and adapted to measure the exopeptidase

189

activity of ACE2 in the presence and absence of inhibitors. The Fluorescence assay was

190

performed using a black flat-bottom 96-well plate with a final reaction volume of 50 µL following

191

the manufacturer’s instructions. We prepared 10mM stock solutions of the compounds in

192

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Next, we serially diluted the compounds in DMSO as follows: 100,

193

50, 10, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 µM for CLQ and CLBQ14; as well as 10 µM, and 1 µM for CLCQ. All

194

experiments were performed in triplicates. Each plate contained a positive control of enzyme-

195

treated with vehicle alone (2% DMSO), and a blank control with no enzyme. Briefly, each

196

reaction contained 24 µL of purified recombinant human ACE2 protein (0.42ng/µL) in ACE2

197

buffer, 1 µL of compound at serially diluted concentrations, and 25 µL ACE2 fluorogenic

198

substrate. The total reaction volume was 50 µL. The reaction mixtures were protected from light

199

and incubated for 2.5 hrs at room temperature (22°C). Thereafter, the fluorescence intensities

200

(λExcitation = 535nm, λEmission = 595nm) were measured using a Beckman Coulter DTX880

201

multimode plate reader. A similar experiment was conducted to measure and compare the

202

exopeptidase activity of ACE2, in the presence and absence of Zinc Chloride (ZnCl2) alone,

203

CLBQ14 alone and ZnCl2 in combination with CLBQ14 at concentrations ranging from 100µM to

204

100nM. ZnCl2 was serially diluted in water, and a positive control of enzyme-treated with vehicle

205

alone (water for ZnCl2 only; DMSO for CLBQ14 alone; and water plus DMSO for ZnCl2 and

206

CLBQ14) was carried out for this experiment. The background hydrolysis was subtracted and

The ACE2-Spike (RBD) Protein Interaction assay

211

A Spike-ACE2 binding assay kit (Cat # CoV-SACE2-1, Lot# 062320 7066) was purchased from

212

RayBiotech (Norcross, GA). The in vitro enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), was

213

and adapted and performed in a transparent flat-bottom 96-well plate. We prepared 10mM stock

214

solutions of the compounds in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with serially diluted the compounds

215

in DMSO as follows: 100, 50, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 µM for CLQ, CLBQ14 and CLCQ. All

216

experiments were performed in triplicates. Each plate contained positive controls (1% DMSO)

217

and blank controls with no ACE2. Briefly, 1 µL of serially diluted compounds were incubated

218

with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein, pre-coated on the

219

96 well plates in 49 µL of 1X assay diluent buffer for 31 mins, at room temperature (22°C) with

220

shaking at 180rpm. Next, we added 50 µL of ACE2 protein in 1X assay diluent buffer into the 96

221

well plate, and incubated for 2.5 hrs at room temperature (22°C) with shaking at 180rpm.

222

Thereafter, the solution was discarded and the plate was washed consecutively four times with

223

300 µL 1X wash buffer, followed by the addition of the detection antibody (anti-ACE2 goat

224

antibody). The reaction was allowed to go on for 1 hr at room temperature (22°C) with shaking

225

at 180rpm. Then, the solution was discarded and the wash step was repeated as described

226

above. Next, the HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG was added to each well, and the reaction plate

227

was further incubated for 1 hr at room temperature (22°C) with shaking at 180rpm. Again, the

228

solution was discarded and the wash step was repeated as described above. Then, 100µL of

229

3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) one-step substrate was added to each well, and reaction

230

mixtures were incubated in the dark at room temperature (22°C) with shaking at 180rpm for an

231

additional 30 mins and then stopped by the addition of 50µL stop solution. The absorbance was

232

read at 405 nm using a Beckman Coulter DTX880 multimode plate reader. The background

RESULTS

237

Efficacy of Clioquinol (CLQ) and Analogues against SARS-CoV-2 infection induced

238

Cytopathic Effect (CPE) in Vero E6 cells.

239

In our efforts to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection for potential treatment of COVID-19,

240

we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of CLQ, and two of its derivatives, CLBQ14 and CLCQ,

241

using a standard luminescent-based high-throughput screening (HTS) platform59,60 for SARS-

242

CoV-2 infection induced CPE in African Green Monkey Kidney Vero E6 cells. We found that all

243

three compounds inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE in vitro with 50% Inhibitory

244

Concentration (IC50) values in the low micromolar concentration (Figure 1). Amongst all three

245

analogues tested, CLQ displayed the most potent antiviral activity in the CPE assay (Figure 1).

246

Compared to its counterparts, CLBQ14 exhibited the highest maximum inhibition at about

247

102.96% inhibition at 30µM (Table 1). In addition, we compared the antiviral effects of CLBQ14

248

and its analogues with five other known inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro: Chloroquine,

249

Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Aloxistatin and Calpain Inhibitor IV. The dose-response curves

250

of the CLQ, CLBQ14, CLCQ and the reference compounds mentioned above were determined at

251

multiplicities of infection (MOI) of about 0.002. We found that the IC50 for CLQ (12.62 µM), and its

252

analogues [(CLBQ14, 14.69 µM) and (CLCQ,16.30 µM)] were slightly lower than the IC50 of

253

Aloxistatin (16.72µM); but moderately higher than Chloroquine (1.10µM), Hydroxychloroquine

254

(5.04µM), Remdesivir (4.42µM), and Calpain Inhibitor IV (0.41µM) (Table 2). These results

255

suggest a potential new mechanism of action for CLQ and its congeners. Notably, this is the first

256

report to our knowledge, revealing that CLQ and its analogues effectively inhibit the novel SARS-

257

CoV-2 infection induced CPE.

Cytotoxicity Effects of CLQ and Analogues in Vero E6 cells.

260

We determined the preliminary cytotoxicity of CLQ and its analogues (CLBQ14 and CLCQ),

261

using a Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay60. We assessed the cytotoxic effects of

262

the various compounds in Vero E6 cells and observed that, the 50% cytotoxic concentration

263

(CC50) of CLQ and its derivatives were all greater than 30 µM. However, in comparison to the

264

other reference compounds tested, CLQ and its analogues displayed lower percent minimum

265

viability at higher concentrations. On the other hand, we observed similar percent maximum

266

viability for CLQ pharmacophore and the other reference compounds at lower concentrations

267

(Table 3). This suggests that, the cytotoxic effects may not be a concern at lower concentrations

268

of CLQ and its analogues. Additional concentrations need to be tested in future studies to

269

determine the actual CC50 value (Table 3).

270
271

Effects of CLQ and its Analogues on rhACE2 Exopeptidase Activity

272

We determined the effect of CLQ, CLBQ14 and CLCQ on the exopeptidase activity of rhACE2

273

using an adapted fluorometric assay (https://bpsbioscience.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/79923.pdf).

We found that all three compounds inhibited rhACE2 activity with similar IC50 values in the low

275

micromolar concentration, with CLQ being the most potent amongst all three analogues tested,

276

at IC50 of 5.36µM (Table 4). To our knowledge, these results revealed for the first time that,

277

rhACE2 is a biochemical target of CLQ and its analogues. Because, the known metal cofactor

278

for ACE2 is Zinc48, 61, using the same fluorometric assay described above in the methods

279

section, we further assessed the exopeptidase activity of rhACE2, in the presence of Zinc

280

Chloride (ZnCl2) alone, CLBQ14 alone and ZnCl2 in combination with CLBQ14 at concentrations

281

ranging from 100µM to 100nM. In the presence of ZnCl2 alone, rhACE2 displayed increasing

282

exopeptidase activity. On the other hand, in the presence of ZnCl2 in combination with CLBQ14,

283

we observed an increased shift in IC50 value by over 28 fold compared to CLBQ14 alone (Figure

284

3). Interestingly, this data reveals that increasing concentrations of ZnCl2, titrates the inhibitory

285

effect of CLBQ14 on rhACE2 from concentrations ranging from above 5 - 10µM, consistent with

286

previous reports of the required optimal concentration range of Zinc for the exopeptidase activity

287

of ACE261. Taken together, these preliminary results reveal a new pharmacologic mode of

288

action and novel target for CLQ and its analogues.

Effects of CLQ and its Analogues on rhACE2 and Spike (RBD) Protein Interaction

291

The interaction of human ACE2 receptor with SARS-CoV-2’s Spike protein receptor binding

292

domain is a critical first step in the process required for viral entry into host cells40-43. Using an

293

adapted in vitro enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA)

294

(https://doc.raybiotech.com/pdf/Manual/CoV-SACE2_2020.07.09.pdf), we evaluated the effect

295

of CLQ, CLBQ14 and CLCQ on the binding affinity of rhACE2 and RBD of S protein at

296

concentrations ranging from 100 µM to 100 nM. Surprisingly, we observed a unique bell shaped

297

dose-response curve for all three compounds with higher inhibition of ACE2-Spike (RBD)

298

protein interaction at lower compound concentrations compared to higher concentrations

299

(Figure 4). The bell shaped curve generated two IC50 values (IC50_1 and IC50_2) as shown in

300

Table 4. We found that all three compounds had similar IC50 values in the low micromolar

301

concentration ranging from 0.85 µM to 2.76 µM for IC50_1; however CLQ displayed a higher

302

IC50_2 at 18.15 µM (Table 4). The unconventional dose response curve observed in this

303

interaction assay, could be an indicator of additional binding site(s) and/or target(s), for the CLQ

304

pharmacophore, such as other sites on ACE2 or the Spike (RBD) protein. Again, these findings

305

are the first report to reveal that CLQ and its analogues inhibit and interfere with the binding

306

between human ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD protein in vitro. These results

307

suggest that the CLQ and its derivatives might be promising leads for clinical development of

308

novel SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors and potential COVID-19 therapeutics.

DISCUSSION
Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging virulence of novel SARS-

313

CoV-2 strains, there is an urgent need to accelerate the development of effective therapeutic

314

agents as countermeasures against this pathogen. In this study, we applied three independent

315

approaches, to investigate the possibility of CLQ and its analogues as potential inhibitors of the

316

SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, and gathered strong evidence that this pharmacophore are

317

promising leads for the discovery and pre-clinical development of novel SARS-CoV-2 entry

318

inhibitors and potential COVID-19 therapeutics. To our knowledge, this is the first report

319

revealing rhACE2 as a novel target for CLQ and its analogues, a new pharmacologic mode of

320

action for an old antimicrobial. Taken together, our in vitro findings that CLQ significantly

321

inhibited binding of rhACE2 receptor with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein and SARS-CoV-2

322

infection induced CPE, strongly supports the notion that CLQ and its congeners could be

323

potential drugs and/or chemical probes in the development of counter measures against viral

324

entry into host cells.

325

The availability of simple, rapid, cellular high throughput screening and well-characterized

326

biochemical assays enabled us to quickly discover novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

327

vitro. We successfully identified and characterized CLQ, a known metal chelator and zinc

328

ionophore, as a novel inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE. Using two structural

329

analogues of CLQ (CLBQ14 and CLCQ) in hand, we were able to further explore the impact of the

330

active CLQ pharmacophore on the novel coronavirus infection, the exopeptidase activity of

331

rhACE2 and the interaction of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein, all critical

332

steps/processes in the pathogenesis of COVID19. All three analogues displayed similar potent

333

inhibition in the low micromolar range, against SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE, rhACE2

334

activity and its interaction with Spike Protein. In this study, we also compared the dose-response

335

curves of antiviral effects of CLQ and its analogues with five other known inhibitors of SARS-CoV-

336

2 in vitro: Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Aloxistatin and Calpain Inhibitor IV and

13

337

found that CLQ’s potency was better and comparable to Aloxistatin; but had lower efficacy than

338

the other reference inhibitors (Table 2). It is important to note that the Vero E6 cells used for the

339

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE assay were first sorted by flow cytometry by SRI for selection

340

of cells that had higher levels of ACE2 expression to increase the efficiency of infection.

341

Therefore, the observed IC50 values may be higher than the actual IC50 values in cells that do not

342

have high levels of ACE2 expression. Moreover, we observed that the IC50 values of the

343

compounds in the biochemical assays were much lower than the IC50 in the cellular antiviral

344

assay. We also assessed the cytotoxic effects of the compounds in Vero E6 cells and observed

345

that CLQ and its analogues displayed lower percent minimum viability at higher concentrations

346

compared to the other reference compounds tested. However, we observed similar percent

347

maximum viability for CLQ pharmacophore and the other reference compounds at lower

348

concentrations (Table 3). This suggests that, the cytotoxic effects may not be a concern at lower

349

concentrations of CLQ and its analogues. In addition, the observed IC50 values for inhibition of

350

rhACE2 exopeptidase activity and rhACE2-RBD interaction were in the low micromolar range,

351

suggesting that we may need lower concentrations for in vivo activity. Furthermore, we have other

352

preliminary cytotoxicity results from prior in vivo studies on CLQ and its analogues that reveal no

353

significant toxicity at much lower concentrations below nanomolar range (unpublished data).

354

Therefore, additional in vivo cytotoxicity studies for Vero E6 cells should be conducted at a wider

355

range of concentrations.

356

Throughout our study, we consistently observed a correlation between the high potency of

357

CLQ compared to its other two analogues in the antiviral screen, inhibition of rhACE2

358

metalloprotease activity, and its ability to disrupt the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike

359

(RBD) protein. Amongst all three compounds, CLQ displayed the highest potency in all three

360

independent assays; except for IC50_2. Hence, validating its potential as a therapeutic option for

361

the treatment of COVID19. Clioquinol and its derivatives belonging to 8-hydroxyquinoline

362

structural class, have been investigated extensively in basic, translational and clinical studies

363

because of their multiple activities as metal chelators and zinc ionophores, modulating underlying

364

molecular and physiologic switches required for metal homeostatis in vivo 14-32, 36-39. Previously,

365

CLQ was used to treat bacterial infections62; however, it was withdrawn from the clinic because of

366

untoward effects of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) mostly experienced in Japan in the

367

1950’s29,62,63. More recent studies revealed that SMON might be due to other biologic factors

368

and/or pharmacogenetics primarily linked to the Japanese population29, 62,64. Currently in the clinic,

369

CLQ is approved for use in combination with other agents for treatment of inflammatory skin

370

disorders and fungal infections in some countries14,65. More recently, CLQ and its newer structural

371

derivatives have gained renewed interest as potential drugs for the development of therapeutics

372

for neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases 14-32, 36-39. Furthermore in

373

previous studies, Olaleye O. et. al., serendipitously discovered CLBQ14, the bromine analogue of

374

CLQ and characterized CLQ and additional derivatives as potent inhibitors of replicating and non-

375

replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using a HTS assay designed to identify novel

376

metalloprotease inhibitors17. Altogether, the plethora of evidence on the broad pharmacologic

377

spectrum of activity and metal-chelation propensity of CLQ pharmacophore, combined with its

378

extensive clinical investigational profile, makes this structural class an attractive and promising

379

drugs for targeting ACE2, the important zinc metalloenzyme and essential cellular receptor for

380

SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells40-43.

381

ACE2, a carboxypeptidase, is a known type I integral membrane protein made up of about

382

805 amino acids belonging to the large family of Zinc metalloproteases with high level of structural

383

homology for a catalytic motif, containing one characteristic HEXXH + E zinc-binding consensus

384

sequence and binding sites for inhibitor or specific substrates respectively48. According to earlier

385

reports by Towler et. al., the first crystalline structures of the metallopeptidase domain of ACE2,

386

revealed “a large inhibitor-dependent hinge bending movement of one catalytic subdomain

387

relative to the other that brings important amino acid residues into position for catalysis,” similar to

388

observed subdomains on other zinc metalloproteases respectively48. The residues critical for

15

389

coordinating the binding of Zinc to ACE2 are His374, His378 and Glu402, according to earlier x-ray

390

strucutres48. Moreover, ACE2 is activated by monovalent anions and also known to contain an

391

inhibitor-specific anion binding site48,61. The reported optimal metalloprotease activity of

392

recombinant soluble human ACE2 was found to be in the presence of 10µM ZnCl261. This is

393

consistent with our findings of rhACE2 exopeptidase activity assay, in the presence of Zinc

394

Chloride (ZnCl2). In the presence of the newly identified potent metalloprotease inhibitors (CLQ or

395

CLBQ14 alone), we observed a significantly decreased exopeptidase activity for ACE2 in the low

396

micromolar concentrations (Figure 4). However, we found an increased shift in IC50 values when

397

we assessed exopeptidase activity in the presence of ZnCl2 in combination with CLBQ14 by over

398

28 fold compared to CLBQ14 alone (Figure 3), suggesting that CLBQ14, might be working

399

through zinc chelation, interaction and/or coordination. Our findings not only revealed a novel

400

target (rhACE2) and mechanism of action for the CLQ pharmacophore; but also provides insight

401

into potential reversibility of inhibition and one or more probable mode(s) of inhibition: 1) The

402

concentration of CLBQ14 is titrated with excess ZnCl2, thus pre-occupied and unavailable to

403

inhibit rhACE2 exopeptidase activity; and/or 2) potential competition for the similar binding sites

404

on rhACE2. Additional mechanistic kinetic studies will be required to ascertain this notion.

405

Moreover as mentioned earlier, ACE2, plays an essential role in the regulation of

406

cardiovascular and respiratory physiology 47,48. Its characterization as the functional host receptor

407

for entry of the novel SARS-CoV-2 into human cells40-43, has raised concerns about the potential

408

impact of newly discovered ACE2 inhibitors on cardiovascular and respiratory physiology66-68.

409

Recent studies have also shown that ACE2 plays a key role in protecting the lungs from

410

ARDS67,68, a severe complication of COVID-19 disease4. Therefore, one has to proceed

411

cautiously when targeting ACE266; without permanently inactivating its exopeptidase or other

412

cellular functions, to avoid potential adverse effects to heart and/or lung function. Our lead

413

compound CLQ is a weak metal chelator and zinc ionophore, that can shuttle free zinc across the

414

membrane31,69. Because of these properties, CLQ may temporarily or reversibly affect ACE2

16

415

function and prevent its interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein; without permanently inhibiting

416

its essential exopeptidase function. Because rhACE2 is a novel host target for CLQ and its

417

analogues, the potential effect of CLQ inhibition on heart and lung function needs to be further

418

explored in vivo and pre-clinical studies.

419

The crystal structure of full length human ACE2 revealed that the RBD on SARS-CoV-2

420

S1 binds directly to the metallopeptidase domain (MPD) of ACE2 receptor40,41, that consists of

421

amino acid residues that coordinates zinc, providing further support for the utility of zinc chelators

422

and/or ionophores such as CLQ and its congeners, as promising inhibitors of interaction and viral

423

entry inhibitors. Using a sensitive ELISA, we found that CLQ and its analogues potently disrupt

424

the interaction of ACE2 and Spike (RBD) protein, with CLQ being the most potent. Thus,

425

supporting our findings showing that CLQ and its derivatives binds to ACE2 and inhibits

426

exopeptidase activity. Interestingly unlike the CLQ pharmacopore, other studies revealed that

427

(S,S)-2-{1-Carboxy-2-[3-(3,5-dichloro-benzyl)-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-ethylamino}-4-methyl-pentanoic

428

acid (MLN-4760), a known potent inhibitor of ACE2 exopeptidase activity, belonging to a different

429

chemical class, does not disrupt ACE2-Spike interaction in coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-

430

CoV2, and NL63S 70,71 as its binding site on ACE2 is different than the site where RBD interacts

431

with ACE2 48,70,72. However, CLQ seems to affect ACE2 by reversibly chelating its zinc ion which

432

is essential for ACE2 activity, as well as interfere with ACE2-RBD interaction. Although zinc is

433

essential for stabilizing protein structures and altering the substrate affinity of different

434

metalloproteins32,73, the effects of zinc chelation on molecular structure of ACE2 and its effects on

435

its binding to the SARS-CoV-2 remains to be tested. Moreover, earlier molecular and structural

436

studies also revealed that mutations in the catalytic site required for exopeptidase activity of

437

ACE2, had no effect on Spike RBD binding to ACE248. Howbeit, the unconventional dose-

438

response bell shaped curve that we observed in our studies suggests that their may be additional

439

binding sites and/or modes of action for CLQ and its congeners, resulting in the potent inhibition

440

of interaction at lower micromolar concentrations; compared to higher concentrations. Although,

17

441

CLQ was found to be the most potent amongst all 3 analogs, except for IC50_2, preliminary SAR

442

revealed that the other two derivatives are comparable to CLQ, as they both show potent

443

inhibition of rhACE2-RBD interaction, as well as inhibition of antiviral and anti-rhACE2 activity.

444

Therefore, providing alternative analogues that might not have the same adverse effects

445

experienced with CLQ in the past, potentially alleviating some of the concerns with CLQ.

446

Additional biochemical and structural studies are required to explore other possible mechanisms

447

of action such as competition or interaction of CLQ with RBD for binding to MPD of ACE2, thereby

448

preventing zinc chelation and ionophore activity of CLQ. Future X-ray structures could help to

449

better understand mode of inhibition of this pharmacophore and rational design of more potent

450

drugs.

451

The strengths of our study includes, the use of a rapid multi-prong approach via three

452

sensitive independent assays, to identify and characterize an existing clinical drug as a novel

453

inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In addition, the availability of structural analogues of

454

CLQ, made possible a preliminary structure activity relationship studies (SAR), which revealed

455

similarity between the IC50 values of CLQ and its structural analogues. However, our study has

456

some limitations such as the use of Vero E6 cells that were selected for high expression of

457

ACE2 in the antiviral assay, a HTS designed to rapidly screen for inhibitors of infection induced

458

CPE. An additional limitation is that, the amount of zinc in the purified rhACE2 supplied from

459

BPS and RayBiotech assays were unknown. Future metal dependent studies with apoenzymes

460

will be required to determine the amount of zinc. Considering that CLQ is a known zinc chelator

461

and ionophore, an understanding of the physiologic amount of zinc required for inhibition will be

462

critical for optimal efficacy. Therefore, for these two limitations, the measured IC50 values for the

463

compounds may not be representative of the actual in vitro IC50, which may be lower. However,

464

the remarkable consistency in the observed strong correlation between CLQ and its congener’s

465

antiviral activity, in vitro rhACE2 inhibition and disruption of ACE2-RBD protein interaction,

466

reduces these concerns.

CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE

469

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on human health, healthcare systems, and the global

470

economy74 has imposed an urgent call/pressing need for the development of novel antivirals.

471

Rapid clinical development of anti-COVID19 treatments could be accelerated by discovery of re-

472

purposed clinically approved drugs with new mechanisms of action and/or multiple cellular

473

targets that could potentially disrupt viral pathogenesis/survival and/or prevent the viral

474

entry/interaction with host receptor, ACE2. The body of evidence on the broad pharmacologic

475

spectrum of activity, metal-chelation propensity and zinc ionophore activity of CLQ

476

pharmacophore, combined with its extensive clinical investigational profile, makes this structural

477

class, attractive and promising drugs for targeting rhACE2. Using a multi-prong approach, we

478

discovered and characterized CLQ, a clinical drug and two of its analogues (CLBQ14 and

479

CLCQ) as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection induced CPE in vitro; rhACE2

480

metalloprotease activity; and the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (RBD) protein.

481

Altogether, these novel findings provide insights into a new mode of action and molecular

482

target(s) for CLQ and its derivatives. Thus, validating this structural class as promising leads for

483

clinical development of novel SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors and potential COVID-19

484

therapeutics. Because rhACE2 is a host target, it reduces the concerns for development of drug

485

resistance, which is usually seen with drugs that target viral genes. Further SAR,

486

computational/molecular modeling and X-crystal structure studies will aid the rational design

487

and synthesis of more potent inhibitors in the CLQ-containing, 8-hydroxylquinoline structural

488

class. Our studies not only provides an additional new drug class with zinc chelating and

489

ionophore properties, in the pipeline for urgent quest for therapeutic management for anti-

490

COVID19, but also suggests that there could be the potential physiologic relevance of zinc

491

homeostatis in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID19 pathogenesis. In addition, CLQ and its

492

derivatives could be used as chemical probes to study the biology of host-pathogen interaction

19

493

in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the future, the functional importance of molecular

494

and cellular regulation of host and viral zinc dependent genes/proteins in SARS-CoV-2

495

pathogenesis and survival may be better understood and targeted with available zinc chelators,

496

ionophores, and transporters. Moreover, unlike MLN-4670 another known ACE2 inhibitor48,70,71,

497

our results not only show that CLQ and its analogues inhibits rhACE2, with antiviral activity, but

498

also suggests that CLQ pharmacophore, potently disrupts the interaction of rhACE2 and Spike

499

(RBD) protein. To this end, we provide strong cellular and biochemical evidence supporting the

500

notion that CLQ, CLBQ14 and CLCQ, could serve as a potential lead series for the pre-clinical

501

development of new anti-COVID19 treatments. The expectation is that the development of new

502

anti-COVID19 treatments with dual activity against viral and host entry target could help combat

503

the issue of emerging drug resistant strains, drug-drug interactions, reduction in the cost of

504

treatment, possibly increase patient compliance and improve patient care as well as reduce the

505

mortality rate due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we propose pharmacologic and clinical

506

studies to further explore CLQ and/or its derivatives as treatment options in the tool box for

507

combating this novel coronavirus, and be evaluated in conjunction with other available

508

therapeutics to reduce COVID19 morbidity and mortality as well as potential drug to drug

509

interactions75-78 encountered with other drugs.
