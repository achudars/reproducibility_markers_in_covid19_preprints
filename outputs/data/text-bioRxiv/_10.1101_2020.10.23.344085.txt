Abstract
The search for vaccines that protect from severe morbidity and mortality as a result of infection
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a race against the clock and the virus. Several vaccine
candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein
vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses
efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQPEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of
a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble
and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through
binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against
SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in
the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike
vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining
lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as
the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic
inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and
in vitro microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine
responses with control of virus replication in vivo, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARSCoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant
spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control
mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral
replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection.
In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently
licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEGCHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in
enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response.
Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given
a lethal influenza virus challenge. Our results underscore the potential use of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL
as an adjuvant to achieve protection after single immunization with recombinant protein and
inactivated vaccines against respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as the causative agent of
coronavirus disease 2019, also known as COVID-19, is a beta-coronavirus which belongs to the
family of Coronaviridae and is currently responsible for the third human coronavirus outbreak in
the past 20 years, after SARS (now often referred to as SARS-CoV-1) in 2002/03 and MERS
(Middle east respiratory syndrome) in 2012 (1). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China
in December 2019 (2,3). This COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented morbidity,
mortality and global economic instability. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic and is believed to
spread mainly through respiratory droplets and aerosols. The current preventive measures include
quarantine, isolation and physical social distancing. Thus far, therapeutic drugs are of limited use
in the clinic, and no specific vaccine is available yet, therefore calling for an urgent need for
development of effective vaccines to restrict disease as well as viral spread.
More than hundred candidate vaccines, consisting of multiple vaccine types such as recombinant
viral epitopes (surface glycoprotein), adenovirus-based vectors (e.g. recombinant replication
incompetent HAdV-C5), purified inactivated or live-attenuated virus, virus like particles (VLPs)
and DNA or RNA based vaccine formulations, are currently being investigated (4,5). At present
mRNA-based vaccines formulated in lipid nanoparticles, recombinant protein-based and
inactivated virus-based vaccines as well as viral vector-based vaccines have reached late stage of
clinical development, entering phase 3 testing. For these vaccines, pre-clinical data in animal
models has also been generated supporting the hypothesis that these vaccines can effectively
prevent viral infection. However, little is known about whether recombinant protein vaccines are
capable of conferring protective immunity. In contrast to the aforementioned mRNA and viral
vector-based vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines are simpler as they consist of a single entity
antigen and – in contrast to viral vectors – do not require antigen expression in the vaccinees.
Compared to mRNA vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines do not require complex (lipid)
nanoparticle formulations to overcome the formidable barrier of the endosomal membrane before
reaching the cytoplasm which is the subcellular target compartment for the antigen-expressing
mRNA. Moreover, thus far no mRNA-based vaccine has been licensed, which might pose
additional hurdles in view of mass manufacturing in world-wide immunization campaigns.
Hence, exploring the viability of a recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine might be of
considerable relevance. SARS-CoV-2 consists of over 30 kb single-stranded positive strand RNA
genome which encodes four major structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N)
and envelope (E). The spike protein comprises a homotrimeric structure which is present on the
surface of the virus and facilitates the viral attachment and entry into the host cells. Like SARSCoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 S protein gains entry into host cells via human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (hACE-2) receptors on the host cell surface via its receptor-binding domain (RBD)
(1)(6). Subsequently, membrane-associated serine proteases such as transmembrane protease,
serine 2 (TMPRSS2) or endosomal-associated proteases such as cathepsins cleave the S protein,
thereby promoting efficient fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane, followed by
release of viral content into the cell cytoplasm, where the virus subsequently replicates. The viral
infection usually begins in the oral/nasal cavity and once released, it gradually establishes itself in
type-II pneumocytes of the lower respiratory air tract and enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract
(7,8).
Due to its involvement in viral entry, the S protein is a major target for current vaccine
development against SARS-CoV-2 (5). Therefore, in this study we explored the recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a potential vaccine candidate. As recombinant protein antigens are
poorly immunogenic and are incapable of mounting antigen-specific immunity of sufficient
quality, amplitude and duration, co-administration of adjuvants that shape B cell and T cell
responses are indispensable. Adjuvants like alum and oil-in-water emulsions can act through a

multitude of mechanisms. More defined small molecule adjuvants that potently activate innate
immune cells by triggering specific innate immune receptors might be more relevant for anti-viral
vaccine design. The Toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLR7/8) are widely distributed amongst innate
immune cell subsets over a broad range of species (9). Akin to be an endosomal pattern recognition
receptor for viral RNA, triggering of these receptors provokes robust type I interferon production
that can skew a Th1-type adaptive immune response against co-administered antigen (10). The
latter are characterized by robust antibody titers capable of inducing viral neutralization through a
variety of mechanisms, including Fc-mediated innate immune killing as well as inducing CD4and CD8 T-cell based immunological memory. Moreover, vaccines adjuvanted with TLR7/8
ligands have been shown to confer enhanced protective immunity in both mouse and non-human
primate models (11,12).

bond formation between respectively cholesterylamine and PEG and PEG and IMDQ. (B) Schematic representation
of albumin hitchhiking-mediated lymphatic transportation.

Being well-defined small molecules, imidazoquinolines are a class of TLR7/8 agonists (13) that
hold a massive technological advantage in terms of production and physicochemical stability.
However, their pharmacokinetic profile is characterized by rapid systemic dissemination upon
local (e.g. subcutaneous or intramuscular) administration, thereby causing unwanted innate
immune activation at multiple distal tissues (14), which is currently a strong limitation for applying
imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonists in mass immunization campaigns. We and others have reported
on strategies to alter the bio-distribution of imidazoquinolines through chemical conjugation to a
synthetic carrier that limits systemic circulation but confers robust translocation to immuneinducing sites in sentinel lymph nodes (14–18). In the present work, we report on a novel
amphiphilic carrier for imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) TLR7/8 agonists with high translational
potential, based on conjugation of a single imidazoquinoline to the chain end of a cholesterylpolyethylene glycol macromolecular amphiphile (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL; Figure 1A). This design
mediates binding to serum proteins such as albumin (15,19) (Figure 1B) and in contrast to pure
lipidation, the conjugate is well water-soluble. As a result, mobility in tissue is achieved without
depot formation, with potential loss in adjuvant efficacy, hence avoiding the need for additional
formulation.

Here we report that IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is a potent adjuvant candidate which can enhance vaccine
efficiency and induce robust Th1 skewed antibody responses in mice when delivered as a single
shot with either admixed S protein (for SARS-CoV-2) or seasonal quadrivalent inactivated
influenza virus vaccine (QIV, for influenza) . Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was able to infer
protection in SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus (H1N1)-infected infected mice. In this context, it is
noteworthy to mention that a major limitation in COVID19-vaccine development is the lack of
susceptible small animal models for pre-clinical assessment and evaluation of its efficacy.
Reportedly, in contrast to human ACE-2, murine ACE-2 is not targeted by wild type SARS-CoV2 virus because of species-specific variations in ACE-2 receptors between mouse and human. Here
we made use of a mouse model where hACE-2 was introduced through an adenoviral vector (Ad5hACE2), which allows for subsequent replication of SARS-CoV-2 upon infection in the airways
of transduced mice (20).

Results and Discussion
IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces potent innate immune activation in lymph nodes
The imidazoquinoline 1-(4-(aminomethyl)benzyl)-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine
(IMDQ) (21) was conjugated to cholesteryl-poly(ethylene glycol) (CHOL-PEG), yielding IMDQPEG-CHOL. As a control, non-amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG was synthesized. (Figure 1A) PEG with
a molecular weight of 3 kDa was chosen as an optimal compromise between water solubility and
drug load. Characterization of the conjugate was performed by matrix assisted laser
desorption/ionization – time of flight (MALDI-ToF) (Supplementary Figure S1) analysis whereas
high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (Supplementary Figure S2) proved absence
of free soluble non-conjugated IMDQ. Both IMDQ-PEG-CHOL and IMDQ-PEG were watersoluble, but only IMDQ-PEG-CHOL showed affinity towards albumin as measured by biolayer
interferometry (Figure 2A). On the in vitro level, the presence of the CHOL motif dramatically
improved cellular uptake by DC2.4 (Figure 2B-C; note that for imaging purpose, IMDQ was
replaced by the fluorescent probe Cynanine5), a murine model mouse dendritic cell line, and was
more potent in inducing NF- kB activation in a reporter cell line (Figure 2D), while being nontoxic within the tested experimental window (Figure 2E). We attribute this to the ability of the
cholesterol motif to interact with the phospholipid cell membrane.
On the in vivo level, using a transgenic luciferase-reporter mouse model for IFN b-production (22),
we found that local administration (i.e. subcutaneous injection into the footpad) of IMDQ-PEGCHOL, in contrast to unformulated IMDQ, dramatically reduced systemic innate immune
activation, while focusing its activity to the site of injection and the draining (popliteal) lymph
node (Figure 3A). For quantification of the luminescence imaging data we refer to Supplementary
Figure S3. Interestingly, the CHOL motif appeared crucial for mediating lymphatic translocation
as the IMDQ-PEG control induced very limited activity in the draining lymph node. To further
support this, we performed microscopic (Figure 3B1) and flow cytometry (Figure 3B2) analysis
of popliteal lymph nodes of mice that received fluorescent Cyanine5-PEG-CHOL or CyaninePEG, respectively. These experiments revealed a dramatic increase in fluorescence when the
conjugates contained the CHOL motif. A more detailed analysis of immune cells subsets in the
draining lymph node revealed that vast percentages of lymphocytes, notably over 50% of dendritic
cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mf), as well as 40% of B cells, were targeted by Cyanine5-PEGCHOL (Figure 3C). In a similar experimental setting, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induced recruitment
(Figure 3D1) and robust activation (Figure 3D2) of immune cells. Taken together, these data
support our hypothesis that IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is a potent adjuvant that focuses its activity to
draining lymphoid tissue, combined with a promising safety profile.

IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces a balanced neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus
vaccine
We evaluated the potential of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant a licensed vaccine, i.e. the
quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), in a well-established preclinical vaccination-infection
model. Hereto we vaccinated BALB/c mice with each of 1.5 µg of QIV with or without 100 µg
of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL or PEG-CHOL as a control. The study protocol is outlined in Figure 4A.
Six mice in each group received a total of 100 µl vaccine-adjuvant mixture, intramuscularly,
divided over both hind legs and the blood was collected 3 weeks post vaccination, followed by
serological assays. For detection of influenza-specific antibodies induced by the QIV vaccines, we
used vaccine antigen to coat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. The total IgG
antibody titers in mice which received QIV only or QIV+ PEG-CHOL were very low as compared
to the mice vaccinated with QIV+ IMDQ-PEG-CHOL (also shown as area under curve (AUC) in
Supplementary Figure S4). Unadjuvanted QIV and PEG-CHOL admixed QIV resulted mainly in
vaccine-specific IgG1 antibodies, whereas IMDQ-PEG-CHOL resulted in a balanced IgG1/IgG2a
response as shown in Figure 4B. Interestingly, QIV + PEG-CHOL resulted in even lower antibody
responses than QIV alone, an observation we confirmed in an independent vaccination experiment
(data not shown). Four out of six mice that received QIV + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could efficiently
inhibit hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells (RBC) in vitro, by A/Singapore/gp1908/2015
IVR-180, the H1N1 virus component in QIV, with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers
outperforming those of the other immunized groups (Figure 4C).
Next, the immunized mice were challenged with a hundred-fold half-lethal dose (LD50) of IVR180 (H1N1) virus to examine the magnitude of protection against viral infection in vivo. The lungs
were harvested from three mice in each group 5 days post challenge to determine lung virus titers.
Consistent with the ELISA and HI data, mice immunized with QIV + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL
exhibited best reduction in viral lung titers as evidenced by an almost negligible number of plaques
when compared to other groups (Figure 4E). This was also reflected in the optimal protection
from body weight loss of QIV + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL mice after viral challenge (Figure 4D). In
conclusion, our novel adjuvant IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was able to offer excellent control of viral
infection and therefore, in combination with the right antigen, might also hold promise to confer
protective immunity against other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces a balanced neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2
immunization
We next investigated the potential of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant recombinant SARS-CoV-2
S protein. For this purpose, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with 6 µg of
recombinant trimeric spike protein either unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL or
with equivalent amounts of MF59-like water-in-oil vaccine AddaVax as a control established
vaccine adjuvant. The recombinant vaccine consisted of the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein from which the polybasic cleavage site was removed. Stabilizing prolines were added at
positions 986 and 987 and trimerization was promoted by fusion to a T4 trimerization domain (see
methods section for more details). The study protocol is outlined in Figure 5A. Serum was
collected after 21 days post immunization and analyzed for Spike protein specific IgG titers.
Whereas non-immunized mice evidently did not show any detectable Spike protein-specific titers
in their sera, immunization with S protein induced Spike protein-specific titers in all groups
(Figure 5B), also shown as area under the curve (AUC) titers in Supplementary Figure 54. The
total S protein-specific IgG titers were found to be the highest in the IMDQ-PEG-CHOL
adjuvanted group. Additionally, Spike protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL immunization resulted in a
higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, suggesting a more potent Th1 immune response and more efficient class
switching towards IgG2a as compared to spike protein only or spike protein + AddaVax
immunization.

Next, the sera from vaccinated mice were used to test the ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection
in vitro. Although immunization with non-adjuvanted S protein was able to induce some IgG titers,
it was found ineffective in neutralizing viral infection of Vero E6 cells in vitro in a
microneutralization assay (Figure 5C1-2). By contrast, serum of mice immunized with spike
protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was able to neutralize >50% of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in this
assay, which was also significantly higher than the serum of mice immunized with spike protein +
AddaVax.
IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induces protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model
Finally, we investigated to what extent S protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL immunization is able to
confer protection against a SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge. As mice do not express the hACE-2
receptor that is needed for the virus to infect the host, we first transduced immunized mice with an
adenoviral vector encoding for hACE-2 by intranasal installation. Four days later, mice we
challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus and again 4 days later, lungs were harvested, and the residual
viral infection was quantified by a plaque assay. Interestingly, whereas non-adjuvanted Spike
protein could not confer any protection, relative to the non-immunized group, Spike protein +
IMDQ-PEG-CHOL vaccination conferred sterilizing immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection
with plaque numbers below the detection limit (Figure 5D), and performed significantly better
than spike protein + AddaVax immunization, which correlates with the higher microneutralization
titers observed in the Spike protein + IMDQ-PEG-CHOL group (Figure 5C1-2).

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown in this work that IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is a potent adjuvant with
enhanced safety profile that induced innate immune activation in lymphoid tissue upon local
administration. Whereas IMDQ in soluble, unformulated form, rapidly enters systemic circulation,
conjugation to a lipid-polymer amphiphile prevents the latter while promoting translocation to the
draining lymph node, likely through binding to albumin in the interstitial flow. In mouse
vaccination/challenge models for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, we have demonstrated that a single
immunization with QIV or S protein adjuvanted with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL induced robust Th1
skewed antibody responses, as evidenced by higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratios. Importantly, vaccination
with QIV and S protein adjuvanted with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL resulted in virus-specific neutralizing
antibodies and control of viral infection after challenge with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses,

PEG-CHOL might be beneficial to promote such responses. Whereas we are aware of the
limitations of the present studies, we do believe that the overarching message that single
vaccination with a properly adjuvanted recombinant S protein based vaccine is able to induce
protective immunity in a mouse model, is of great relevance with regard to broadening the arsenal
of emerging COVID-19 vaccines. Safe adjuvants like IMDQ-PEG-CHOL described in our study
may help enhance vaccine efficiency if deemed necessary from ongoing clinical trials, similar to
the recent development of MF59-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccines for the elderly. Use of
efficient adjuvants may also reduce the amount of vaccine needed to induce a protective immune
response, which is important in case there is vaccine shortage, as is the case during this COVID19
pandemic.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All chemicals for synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI, unless noted otherwise.
Mice, Cell lines and reagents
6-8 weeks old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, MA and were
housed in a specified pathogen-free facility at Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai, with food
and water ad libitum, adhering to the guidelines from Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cells (MDCK, ATCC-CCL 34) and Vero-E6 (ATTC-CRL 1586,
clone E6) cells are routinely cultured in the laboratory. Both cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and additionally
with 1% non-essential amino acids for Vero-E6 cells. DC2.4 mouse dendritic cells were cultured
in RPMI-glutamax supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics (50 units/mL
penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Murine RAW blue 264.7
macrophages were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated FBS,
antibiotics (50 units/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin), 2 mM L-glutamine and 0.01 %
Zeocin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a controlled and sterile environment of 95 % relative
humidity and 5 % CO2.
Vaccines, Blood Collection and Serology
Quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (QIV) was the human Seqirus vaccine (20182019 formula) containing the antigens of the following influenza virus strains:
A/Singapore/GP1908/2015
IVR-180
(H1N1),
A/North
Carolina/04/2016
(H3N2),
B/Iowa/06/2017 and B/Singapore/INFTT-16-0610/2016. Vaccine was obtained from BEI
resources and mixed with adjuvant as described below. Vaccine was injected once via the
intramuscular route with a BD 300 μL insulin syringe in the hamstring muscles of the both hind
legs (50 μL/leg). The administered vaccine dose corresponds to 1.5 μg of each hemagglutinin type
in the vaccine per mouse.
Blood was collected twenty days post vaccination via submandibular bleeding and serum was
prepared by allowing the blood to clot at room temperature. Anti-HA antibody responses were
measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
assay. For quantification of HA-specific total IgG levels by ELISA, 96 well NUNC Maxisorp
plates were coated with QIV (2 μg/ml HA equivalent for each HA) in bicarbonate buffer at 4 °C
overnight. After washing and blocking with 4% milk for 1 h at room temperature, serum samples
3-fold diluted starting at 1/100 in PBS with 0.05% Tween20 were allowed to bind ELISA antigen
for 1.5 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS (0.05% Tween20) and

incubated with sheep-derived anti-mouse total IgG (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK), IgG1 or
IgG2a (Invitrogen) serum conjugated to horse-radish peroxidase. After a final washing step,
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to
estimate levels of HA-specific mouse IgG by measuring the OD450 with the OD650 as a reference
after stopping the colorimetric reaction with 1M H2SO4.
Hemagglutination inhibition was performed as previously described (23). Briefly, four volumes of
receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, Vibrio cholera filtrate, Sigma Aldrich, San Diego, CA, USA)
were added to each volume of mouse serum. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, sera were heatinactivated at 56 °C for 30 min in sodium citrate buffer. Four hemagglutination units of IVR-180
H1N1 virus were mixed with twofold dilutions of treated sera in a final volume of 50 μL. Mixtures
of virus and diluted serum were allowed to bind for 1h at room temperature before 50 μL of 0.5%
chicken red blood cell suspension was added. HI titers were read after 1h incubation on ice.
Trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was produced as previously described: only the
ectodomain of the spike protein (GenBank: MN908947.3) was cloned into a mammalian
expression plasmid and the cleavage site was removed and stabilizing prolines were added at
position 986 and 987 (24–26). A hexa-histidine tag as well as a T4 foldon trimerization domain
was present in the plasmid for ease of purification. The spike protein was expressed in 293F cells,
using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher). Supernatant was collected on day
3 post transfection and Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) was used to purify the protein. This protocol has
been described in much greater detail earlier (26). Vaccine (6 μg/mouse) was mixed with adjuvant
as described below and injected once via the intramuscular route with a BD 300 μL insulin syringe
in the hamstring muscles of both hind legs (50 μL/leg).
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ELISA was performed to estimate spike-specific antibody
responses upon vaccination. Briefly, maxisorp Nunc 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 50
µl per well of recombinant spike protein, diluted to a concentration of 2 µg/ml in
carbonate/bicarbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Three-fold serially diluted serum
samples, starting from 1:100, were added to the antigen-coated plates followed by overnight
incubation at 4°C. The plates were then washed in 1X PBS + 0.01% Tween20 and again incubated
with appropriate horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies targeting total
IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a antibodies (GE Healthcare). The plates were washed and developed with 50
µl of TMB substrate per well until blue color appeared. The reaction was terminated with 50 µl
1M H2SO4 and the absorbance was measured at 450nm with 650 nm as a reference.
In vitro microneutralization assay
To measure the neutralizing potential of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced sera, an in vitro
microneutralization assay was performed similar to the protocol described in (27). Briefly, the
Spike ± adjuvant-vaccinated mice sera were inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Serum samples were
serially diluted 2-fold starting from 1:10 dilution in infection medium (DMEM+ 2% FBS+ 1X
non-essential amino acids). The samples were incubated with 100 tissue culture infective dose 50
(TCID50) which equals 40 plaque forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV2 virus for 1 hour in an
incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 and then transfer on pre-seeded Vero-E6 cells in 96-well cell-culture
plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The cells
were washed with 1XPBS and blocked in 5% milk in 1XPBS+ 0.1% Tween20 for 1 hour at room
temperature. After blocking, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX100, washed and
incubated with anti-SARS-CoV-2-nucleoprotein and anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike monoclonal
antibodies, mixed in 1:1 ratio, for 1.5 hours at room temperature. The cells were washed again and
incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for 1 hour at room
temperature followed by a brief PBS wash. Finally, 50 µl tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate
was added and incubated until blue color appeared and the reaction was terminated with 50 µl 1M
H2SO4. Absorbance at 450nm was recorded and percentage inhibition calculated. Anti-mouse

SARS-CoV-2-nucleoprotein and anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies were obtained from
the Center for Therapeutic Antibody Development at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,
New York.
Adjuvants: AddaVax was purchased from Invivogen and mixed at a 3:1 ratio vaccine:AddaVax
per the manufacturer’s recommendation. IMDQ adjuvants were mixed with vaccine at an
equivalent of 10 μg core IMDQ (100 μg of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL, see below) per mouse.
Viruses and Infection
QIV vaccinated mice were infected 24 days post vaccination with 100 lethal dose 50 (18,000 PFU)
of egg-grown influenza IVR-180 H1N1 virus, a vaccine strain that contains the surface antigens
of influenza A/Singapore/gp1908/2015 (H1N1) virus. Morbidity and mortality were monitored for
eight days. A group of age-matched naïve animals was added to the experiment to confirm the
dose of virus was lethal to unvaccinated animals.
In order to make SARS-CoV-2 Spike-vaccinated BALB/c mice susceptible to challenge with wild
type SARS-CoV-2 virus, airway expression of human ACE-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was
obtained by intranasal transduction of mice with 2.5x108 PFU of adenovirus expressing h-ACE-2
(Ad5-hACE2), 4.5-weeks post-vaccination as described in (28). Five days after transduction with
Ad5-hACE2, mice were challenged with 5x104 PFU of SARS-CoV2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI
resources; NR-52281) per mice. Body weights were recorded to assess the morbidity during the
days post challenge.
Lung Virus Titration
Plaque assays were performed to quantify and compare the lung viral titers in vaccinated versus
unvaccinated mice. As described previously (23), whole lungs were harvested from the mice and
homogenized in 1 ml 1XPBS. After brief centrifugation, the tissue debris was discarded and the
supernatant was 10-fold serially diluted starting from 1:10 dilution. For IVR-180, MDCK cells
were incubated with the lung homogenate dilutions for 1 hour at 37°C, 5% CO2 and then overlaid
with a mixture of 2% oxoid agar and 2X minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with
1% diethyl-aminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran and 1 μg/ml tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloro-methyl
ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. After 48 hours of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2, the plates were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde and immune-stained with IVR-180-post-challenge polyclonal serum.
Similarly, For SARS-CoV-2, pre-seeded Vero-E6 cells were incubated with diluted lung
homogenates for 1 hour at room temperature and then overlayed with a 1ml mixture of 2% oxoid
agar and 2X MEM supplemented with 2% FBS. After 72 hours of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2,
the plates were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, followed by immune-staining of infected cells with
anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 spike monoclonal
antibodies. After incubation in primary antibodies, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary
antibody was added for 1 hour. Finally, the plaques were developed with TrueBlue substrate (KPLSeracare). The final viral titers were calculated in terms of plaque forming units (PFU)/ml.
IMDQ-PEG-CHOL synthesis
IMDQ was synthesized according to literature (18).
Synthesis of Cholesterylamine
First, the alcoholic hydroxyl group of cholesterol was transformed to an azide through a Mitsunobu
reaction in the presence of diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA). Cholesterol (2.0 g, 5.17 mmol) was
dissolved in a round bottom flask equipped with a stirring bar containing anhydrous THF (20 mL).
Triphenylphosphine (PPh3, 1.63 g, 6.21 mmol) and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD, 1.22 mL,
6.21 mmol) was added to the round bottom flask. Upon addition of DIAD, the reaction mixture
developed a yellow colour. After 10 minutes, DPPA (1.34 mL, 6.21 mmol) was added and the

mixture stirred overnight at room temperature under inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture was
reduced under vacuum and further purified by column chromatography (cyclohexane), to yield a
purified withe powder (yield = 60 %). The resulting product cholesteryl-N3 was analysed by 1HNMR and ATR-IR.
Next, a Staudinger reduction was executed to reduce the azide group to a primary amine function
with PPh3. The obtained cholesteryl-N3 (400 mg, 0.97 mmol) was transferred into a round bottom
flask containing a stirring bar and dissolved in anhydrous THF (2.0 mL) under inert atmosphere.
A solution of PPh3 (2.55 g, 9.72 mmol) in dry THF (5.0 mL) was added. After 30 min, 2 mL water
was added and the reaction mixture stirred overnight at room temperature equipped with a balloon
to trap the released nitrogen gas. The reaction mixture was diluted extensively with toluene before
being reduced under vacuum by 50 °C. The crude product was purified by column chromatography
using a gradient (from 95:5 DCM:MeOH to 95:5 DCM:MeOH + 1% ammonium hydroxide),
yielded a white powder which was characterized by 1H-NMR, ATR-IR and MS(yield = 98 %).
ESI-MS (Figure SX): m/z [M+H]+ = 386.37 (theoretical); found = 386.363

Synthesis of PEG-CHOL
A round bottom flask containing a stirring bar was loaded with Boc-NH-PEG-COOH (300 mg,
0.098 mmol) and dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 3 mL) under inert
atmosphere.
1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium
3-oxid
hexafluorophosphate (HATU) (40.84 mg, 0.107 mmol) was added to the stirring solution followed
by 20.4 µL of triethylamine (TEA, 0.146 mmol). After 5 min, a solution of cholesterylamine (56.4
mg, 0.146 mmol) in dry chloroform (1.5 mL) was added and stirred at room temperature for 2 h,
yielding a slightly yellow reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was co-evaporated with a large
excess of toluene to remove DMF. Subsequently, the crude product was purified by threefold
precipitation in ice cold diethyl ether followed by column chromatography (90:10 DCM: MeOH)
(yield = 86 %). The white PEG-CHOL-NH Boc powder was analyzed by 1H-NMR, DMAc-SEC
and MALDI-ToF.
Subsequently the Boc-group was removed by dissolving Boc-NH-PEG-CHOL (200 mg, 0.058
mmol) in 2 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) in a round bottom flask equipped with a stirring bar.
An equal amount of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 2 mL) was added and the solution was stirred for 2
h opened to ambient air and temperature. Prior to concentration under vacuum, a large excess of
toluene was added to the reaction mixture. Finally, the product was transferred to dialysis
membranes and dialyzed against 0.1 % v/v ammonium hydroxide solution in demineralized water
for multiple days and one day against demineralized water. After lyophilization, the white fluffy
powder NH2-PEG-CHOL was characterized by 1H-NMR and MALDI-ToF.
Synthesis of linker 1
In a round bottom flask equipped with a stirring bar, p-nitrobenzyl chloroformate (2.02 g, 10
mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DCM and cooled on ice. A mixture of diethylene glycol (424.5
mg, 4 mmol) and TEA (1.67 mL, 12 mmol) in 10 mL anhydrous DCM were added dropwise and
stirred for an additional 30 minutes on ice. After 2 h on room temperature, the reaction mixture
was concentrated under vacuum, dissolved in EtOAc and filtered. After evaporation of the solvent
under reduced pressure, the linker was analyzed by 1H-NMR and MS.
Synthesis of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL
First, linker 1 (65.3 mg, 0.15 mmol) was dissolved in 2.5 mL anhydrous DCM under inert
atmosphere. After addition of 2 equivalent of dry TEA (8.35 µL, 0.06 mmol), NH2-PEG-CHOL
(100 mg in 2 mL anhydrous DCM, 0.03 mmol) was added dropwise under stirring and a distinct
yellow color appeared indicating the release of p-nitrophenol. After overnight reaction,

purification was performed by double precipitation into a mixture of ice-cold hexane:acetone
(80:20). The resulting intermediate 1 was dried under vacuum and analyzed by NMR and SEC
with DMAc as mobile phase.
In the second step, intermediate 1 (50 mg, 0.014 mmol) and IMDQ (9.5 mg, 0.22 mmol) were
weighed into a round bottom flask with stirring bar. The compounds were dissolved in 2.3 mL
anhydrous 1,4-dioxane and anhydrous TEA (9.76 µL, 0.07 mmol) was added to solution under
vigorous stirring. After 3 h at room temperature, a few drops of dry methanol were added and the
reaction was stirred overnight. Next, the solution was transferred into a dialysis membrane (1 kDa)
and dialyzed for multiple days against demineralized water. After freeze drying, the with
fluffyIMDQ-PEG-CHOL powder was characterized by 1H-NMR, HPLC and MALDI-ToF. HPLC
conditions to verify absence of freely soluble IMDQ: LiChroCart® C18 column 250-4, mobile
phase H2O/ ACN 65:35 with 0.1% TFA, flow rate at 1 mL/min and detection at 250nm. Note that
IMDQ-PEG was synthesized in similar fashion, but omitting the conjugation of cholesterylamine.
Synthesis of Cyanine5-PEG-CHOL
NH2-PEG-CHOL (25 mg, 7.49 µmol) was weighted into a Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic
stirring bar and dissolved in 2.5 mL dry DMSO under inert atmosphere. Then, 0.21 mL of cyanine5
N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (stock solution of 25 mg/mL in anhydrous DMSO, 7.86 µmol) and
anhydrous TEA (5.2 µL,37.42 µmol) were added to the Schlenk tube and further stirred overnight
at room temperature. After dialyzed for three days against demineralized water, Cyanine5-PEGCHOL was isolated as a fluffy blueish powder after lyophilization.
Biolayer interferometry analysis
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was biotinylated by reacting it with 5:1 excess of biotin-NHS
followed by dialysis and lyophilization. Hydrated streptavidin sensors were dipped in PBS to
record a baseline for 60 seconds, followed by dipping into biotinylated BSA (12.5 nM, 66.5 kDa)
in PBS for 300 s, and dipping for 30 s in PBS for washing. Next, a second baseline was recorded
by dipping in fresh PBS for 120 s. Association of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was measured by dipping
into a solution of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in PBS for 600 s. Note that the experiment was ran in parallel
for different concentrations of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL. Dissociation of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL was
recorded by dipping in PBs for 600 s. The experiment was performed in a black flat bottom 96
well plate set at 30 °C by 1000 rpm, using an Octet RED96 model (Pall Fortébio). Data processing
was done by the FortéBio software package.
Cell cytotoxicity (MTT) assay
DC 2.4 cells were plated seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 8 000 cells per well in 200 µL
culture medium. 50 µL of sample (dilution series in PBS, ranging from 10-4 mg/mL to 0.5
mg/mL), PBS (negative control, 100 % viability) and DMSO (positive control, 0 % viability)
were added to the wells. After 72 h, the medium was aspirated and cells were washed with 200
µL PBS followed by addition of 100 µL of diluted MTT stock solution. After 1h, the solution
was removed and the formed formazan crystals were dissolved in 50 µL DMSO. Quantification
was done by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm using a microplate reader. Note, 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 50 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL
sterile PBS, filtrated (membrane 0.22 µm) and 1/5 diluted in culture medium prior to use in this
assay.
Confocal microscopy
DC 2.4 cells were seeded in Willco-Dish glass bottom at a concentration of 10 000 cells in 180 µL
culture medium and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were pulsed overnight with 20 µL of a 1
mg/mL Cyanine5-PEG-CHOL or Cynanine5-PEG solution in PBS. Next, the culture medium was
aspirated and cells were fixated with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min followed by washing

with PBS and confocal imaging using a Leica DMI6000B microscope (63x 1.40 NA objective)
coupled to an AndorDSD2 confocal scanner and a Zyla5.5 CMOS camera. Image processing was
done using the ImageJ software package.
Flow cytometry analysis of in vitro IMDQ-PEG-CHOL association
DC 2.4 cells were seeded out in 24-well plate at a concentration of 200 000 cells per well in 450
µL of culture medium. Cells were pulsed with samples and incubated overnight at 37 °C.
Afterwards, the supernatants were removed, cells were washed with PBS and detached with cell
dissociation buffer (0.5 mL, 15 min, 37 °C). The content of the wells was transferred to an
Eppendorf and centrifuged (5 min, 300 G, 4 °C). After aspiration of the supernatant, the cell pellets
were resuspended in PBS and analyzed using a BD Accuri Flow Cytometer. Data were processed
using the FlowJo software package.
RAW blue innate immune activation assay
RAW blue 264.7 macrophages were seeded in flat-bottom 96 well plate at a density of 70.000 cells
per well, suspended in 180 µL culture medium and pulsed with 20 µL of sample for 24h at 37 °C
at different concentrations of IMDQ-PEG-CHOL, IMDQ-PEG, IMDQ and PBS. Subsequently, 50
µL of supernatant was transfer to a new flat-bottom 96 well plate followed by addition of 150 µL
of QUANTI-BlueTM reagent solution, prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruction
(Invivogen). After 30 minutes at 37 °C, the SEAP levels were determined by UV-Vis
spectrophotometry at 620 nm using a microplate reader. Note, the colorimetric quantification of
the samples was obtained relative to the negative control and each concentration was performed
in fivefold.
Analysis of in vivo lymphatic drainage
20 μL (1 mg/mL in PBS) of Cyanine5-PEG-CHOL or Cyanine5-PEG were injected into the
footpad of female C57BL/6 WT mice. Two mice were used per group and injected in both
footpads. At the designated time point, mice where sacrificed and popliteal lymph nodes where
isolated for flow cytometry and confocal imaging. A single cell suspension was prepared from the
dissected popliteal lymph nodes for analysis by flow cytometry. Isolated lymph nodes were
collected in ice cold PBS, dissociated through 70 μm cell strainers, washed with PBS and stained
with a fixable dead/live-staining. 123count ebeads were added to determine cellularity prior to
analysis by a BD FACS Quanto flow cytometer. Data were processed using the FlowJo software
package.
For confocal imaging popliteal lymph nodes where frozen in OCT cryomedium (Sakura, 4583).
frozen sections (8-μm) were cut by cryostat. These sections where fixed for 4 min in PFA 2%
(v/v), and washed with PBS. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope
equipped with 488-nm, 561-nm and 633-nm lasers and with a tunable two-photon laser. Confocal
imaging was done using a Leica DMI6000B microscope (10x 0.70 NA objective) coupled to an
AndorDSD2 confocal scanner and a Zyla5.5 CMOS camera. Image processing was done using the
ImageJ software package.
In vivo immune activation imaging
Luciferase reporter mice (IFNβ+/Δβ-luc) with a Balb/c background, aged 7-9 weeks, were housed
in individual ventilated cages and given ad libitum access to food and water. 20 mL of IMDQPEG-CHOL, IMDQ-PEG or IMDQwere injected subcutaneously in the footpad (n=3) at an
equivalent IMDQ dose of 2 mg. For in vivo imaging at the given time points, mice were injected
subcutaneously with 200 μL D-luciferin and in vivo luminescence imaging was recorded 12 min
later using the IVIS Lumina II imaging system. Local (DLN and DLN + foot pad) luminescence
and full-body luminescence were quantified using the Living Image 4.4 software.
