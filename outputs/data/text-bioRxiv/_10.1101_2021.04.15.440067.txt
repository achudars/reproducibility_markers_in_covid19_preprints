Abstract (246 words)
Infection by SARS-CoV-2 generally causes mild symptoms but can lead to severe disease and
death in certain populations, including the immunocompromised. Drug repurposing efforts are
underway to identify compounds that interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication or the
immunopathology it can elicit. Rapamycin is among those being currently tested in clinical trials
for impacts on COVID-19 severity. While rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are FDAapproved for use as mTOR inhibitors in multiple clinical settings, including cancer, we previously
found that rapamycin can increase the susceptibility of cells to infection by Influenza A virus. In
this study, we tested the impact of rapalogs on cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We report that rapamycin and rapalogs increased SARS-CoV-2 titers in human cervical epithelial
and lung epithelial cell lines to different extents, and a similar pattern of enhancement was
observed using pseudovirus incorporating viral fusion proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,
MERS, and Influenza A Virus. Rapalogs also promoted cell entry driven by SARS-CoV-2 Spike
in nasal cells and primary small airway cells, representing proximal and distal ends of the human
respiratory tract, respectively. Interestingly, cell entry enhancement by the rapalog ridaforolimus
was cell type-dependent, revealing a previously unrecognized functional divergence between
rapalogs. The differential activity of rapalogs was associated with their capacity to induce the
degradation of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, restriction factors that
broadly inhibit virus infection. Our findings will spur the development of mTOR inhibitors that do
not suppress the cell’s first line of antiviral defense.
Significance (120 words)
Due to a lack of effective antivirals available to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease it
causes (COVID-19), existing drugs that are clinically-approved for use in humans are being
considered for deployment during this protracted pandemic. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant
that is administered to humans suffering from cancer, autoimmunity, atherosclerosis, and organ
transplant rejection. While generally recognized for its inhibitory effects on the adaptive immune
response, we previously showed that rapamycin can also impair intrinsic immunity, the immune
system present within all cells of the body. Here, we show that rapamycin and rapamycin analogs
(rapalogs) promote the first step of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle—entry into cells—by
inducing the destruction of antiviral proteins that stand guard during virus invasion.
Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 emerged in humans in
2019 following a species jump from bats and a possible intermediate animal host and is the cause
of COVID-19, a respiratory and multi-organ disease of variable severity [1, 2]. The
characterization of virus-host interactions that dictate SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19
severity is a major priority for public health [3]. Basic research aimed at identifying the cellular
factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection (host dependency factors) has provided targets for
antiviral drug development or repurposing [4-10]. In parallel, the identification of cellular factors
capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication (host restriction factors) has revealed intrinsic
antiviral defenses that should be maintained and bolstered in susceptible individuals, especially
those immunocompromised by age, immunodeficiency, or medical regimen [11-13]. Immune

impairment, such as that resulting from cancer, has been associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2
shedding and the seeding of “super-spreader” events [14-18]. As we consider host-directed small
molecules as candidates for antiviral therapies, it remains critically important to assess their impact
on both dependency factors and restriction factors before they are deployed to slow virus
transmission and/or prevent viral pathogenesis in humans.
One group of compounds being considered for the prevention and treatment of COVID19-related immunopathology are rapamycin (Rapamune, sirolimus) and rapamycin analogs
(rapalogs) [19-30]. As Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors of mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, these drugs are used therapeutically as immunosuppressants to inhibit
the processes of cancer, autoimmunity, graft versus host disease, atherosclerosis, and aging [31].
Rapalogs, including everolimus (RAD-001), temsirolimus (Torisel, CCI-779), and ridaforolimus
(AP-23573), were developed to alter the bioavailability and half-life of rapamycin for improved
pharmacodynamics in vivo [32-36]. Differing by only a single functional group appended to
carbon-40 of rapamycin (Figure 1), it is believed that rapamycin and rapalogs share the same
molecular mechanism of action to inhibit mTOR [35]. Rapamycin binds to FK506-binding protein
12 (FKBP12) and the resulting complex physically interacts with mTOR and disrupts its signaling
potential.
Activation of mTOR promotes cell growth, cell proliferation, and cell survival [37]. In
addition, mTOR activation promotes pro-inflammatory T-cell differentiation and mTOR inhibitors
have been used classically to block lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine storm [38]. Since
respiratory virus infections can cause disease by provoking hyper-inflammatory immune responses
that result in immunopathology, rapalogs are being tested as treatments to decrease viral disease
burden. At least three active clinical trials have been designed to test the impact of rapamycin on
COVID-19 severity (NCT04461340, NCT04341675, NCT04371640).
In addition to their potential utility for mitigating disease in individuals already infected by
SARS-CoV-2, there are also calls to explore the use of rapalogs as antiviral agents to prevent
infection itself [39]. It was previously reported that mTOR activation promotes infection by the
human coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) [40]. However,
the relationship between mTOR and virus replication is complex, varies from virus to virus, and
is dynamic according to a given step in the virus life cycle [41-43].
Rapamycin and temsirolimus have been shown to promote Influenza A replication in mice
and to exacerbate viral disease [44, 45]. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that acute
rapamycin treatment increases cellular susceptibility Influenza A virus infection by inducing the
selective degradation of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins [46]. IFITM
proteins are expressed basally in a variety of tissues and are important components of cell-intrinsic
immunity, the antiviral network that defends individual cells against virus invasion [47, 48]. We
showed that rapamycin triggers the sorting of endosomal IFITM2 and IFITM3 into lysosomes for
proteolytic degradation through a process that was independent of macroautophagy yet dependent
on ubiquitin and endosomal complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery [46]. These
findings revealed a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive feature of rapamycin acting on
intrinsic immunity. Since IFITM proteins broadly inhibit the cellular entry of diverse enveloped
viruses by disfavoring virus-cell membrane fusion in endosomes and at the plasma membrane [4954], rapamycin exposure may increase cellular susceptibility to infection by many viral pathogens.
We and others have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be inhibited by ectopic and
endogenous IFITM1, IFITM2, and/or IFITM3 in cell types that are permissive to infection [11,
13, 55, 56]. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms in IFITM3 known as ns12252 and

rs34481144, previously associated with severe outcomes in Influenza A infection, have been
associated with severe COVID-19 [57, 58]. Therefore, we tested the impact of rapamycin and
rapalogs (hereby collectively referred to as rapalogs) on SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterized
the stages of infection affected.
Results
Two cell lines, cervical epithelial cells transduced with human ACE2 and TMPRSS2
(HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2) and lung epithelial cells transduced with human ACE2 (A549-ACE2),
were pretreated with everolimus at varying concentrations for four hours prior to addition of
SARS-CoV-2. Cell culture media was harvested 24 hours after virus addition and infectious virus
titers were measured on Vero cells by plaque assay. We found that everolimus enhanced virus
titers in a dose dependent manner, with a 20 micromolar dose increasing infectious yields by 8fold in HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 (Figure 2A) and by 3.5-fold in A549-ACE2 (Figure 2B). The
effect of everolimus relative to other rapalogs was assessed by pretreating cells with 20 micromolar
amounts for four hours followed by addition of SARS-CoV-2. In HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells,
rapamycin and temsirolimus promoted infection to a similar extent as everolimus, while the effect
of ridaforolimus was negligible (Figure 2C). In A549-ACE2 cells, rapamycin and temsirolimus
enhanced infectious yield by 9- and 15-fold, respectively, while everolimus and ridaforolimus did
so to a smaller degree (Figure 2D). There results indicate that rapalogs generally increase the
infectious yield of SARS-CoV-2 from cells.
To identify the stage of virus replication that is promoted by rapalogs, we took advantage
of a pseudovirus system based on human immunodeficiency virus. This pseudovirus (HIV-CoV-2
S) is limited to a single round of infection, cell entry is mediated by SARS-CoV-2 Spike, and
infection of target cells is measured by luciferase activity. Rapalogs were tested for activity on
HIV-CoV-2 S in HeLa-ACE2 cells, since, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2, this pseudovirus does not
require TMPRSS2 for cell entry. Rapamycin, everolimus, and temsirolimus enhanced HIV-CoV2 S infection by up to an order to magnitude, while ridaforolimus had little effect (Figure 3A).
These results approximate those obtained using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, revealing
that rapalogs promote the Spike-mediated cell entry step in a drug-dependent manner. We also
tested the effect of tacrolimus (FK506), a compound with a chemical structure nearly identical to
that of the rapalogs but which does not bind mTOR. We found that tacrolimus did not promote
infection of HeLa-ACE2 by HIV-CoV-2 S (Supplemental Figure 1A).
Virus entry into cells is a concerted process involving virus attachment to the cell surface
followed by fusion of cellular and viral membranes. Therefore, we carried out a virus-cell fusion
assay in order to quantify the terminal stage of virus entry into single cells using flow cytometry.
We found that treatment of cells with rapamycin, everolimus, and temsirolimus resulted in
enhanced virus-cell fusion while ridaforolimus had no such effect (Figure 3B and 3C). These
findings suggest that rapalogs promote the cell entry process mediated by SARS-CoV-2 Spike by
facilitating virus-cell membrane merger. To measure whether rapalogs promote the cell entry
process driven by other coronavirus Spike proteins, we produced HIV incorporating Spike from
SARS-CoV (HIV-CoV S) or MERS (HIV-MERS S). Infections by both HIV-CoV S and HIVMERS S were elevated by rapalog treatment of HeLa-ACE2 and HeLa-DPP4, respectively,
although the extent of enhancement was lower than that observed with HIV-CoV-2 S (Figure 3D
and 3E). Consistently, ridaforolimus was the least active among the rapalogs tested and it did not
significantly promote pseudovirus infection. Since we previously showed that rapamycin promotes

the cell entry process of Influenza A virus, we also assessed infection of pseudovirus incorporating
hemagglutinin (HIV-HA). HA-mediated infection was enhanced 10-fold by rapamycin and
everolimus, while temsirolimus enhanced by more than 30-fold. In contrast, ridaforolimus was
inactive (Supplemental Figure 1B).
SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells via multiple routes, and sequential proteolytic processing of
Spike is essential to this process. SARS-CoV-2 Spike is cleaved at a polybasic motif (RRAR)
located at the S1/S2 boundary by furin-like proteases in virus-producing cells prior to release.
Subsequently, the S2’ site is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases such as TMPRSS2 on the target cell
surface or cathepsins B and L in target cell endosomes, activating the viral fusion peptide and
facilitating membrane fusion [59-61]. It was previously shown that deletion or mutation of the
polybasic RRAR motif in Spike promotes the endocytic, cathepsin-dependent entry pathway [4,
56], as has been shown for MERS Spike [62]. We found that inhibition of cathepsin activity by
E64d blocked pseudovirus infection in HeLa-ACE2 cells, while inhibition of TMPRSS2 activity
by camostat mesylate had little to no effect (Figure 4A), supporting the notion that an endosomal
entry pathway is predominantly used by SARS-CoV-2 Spike in these cells [63]. To directly test
whether rapalogs enhance Spike-mediated entry at the plasma membrane or in endosomes, we
produced pseudovirus with Spike mutated at the polybasic 682RRAR685 motif (RRAR à YSAS).
We confirmed that introduction of YSAS prevented cleavage of Spike into S1 and S2 subunits in
virus-producing cells (Supplemental Figure 2). Using pseudovirus incorporating mutant spike,
we found that the capacity for select rapalogs to promote infection was mostly intact (Figure 4B).
These results suggest that rapalog treatment facilitates endosomal Spike-mediated entry in HeLaACE2 cells.
We previously demonstrated that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin triggers a rapid
degradation of IFITM proteins in various cell types, including HeLa, primary human foreskin
fibroblasts, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells [46]. To compare and contrast the effects of
rapalogs on steady-state IFITM protein levels, we treated HeLa-ACE2 cells with rapamycin,
everolimus, temsirolimus, or ridaforolimus for four hours. We found that everolimus and
temsirolimus treatment reduced levels of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins to a similar
extent as rapamycin, while ACE2 levels were unaffected. However, ridaforolimus resulted in only
a modest reduction of IFITM proteins (Figure 5A). Rapalogs promote the proteolytic degradation
of IFITM proteins in endolysosomes, since this process was inhibited by bafilomycin A1
(Supplemental Figure 3). To formally address how rapalog-mediated depletion of IFITM proteins
impacts SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated entry, we used HeLa cells in which IFITM1, IFITM2, and
IFITM3 are knocked out (IFITM1-3 KO) and introduced human ACE2 by transient transfection
(Figure 5B). Relative to WT cells, where temsirolimus promotes infection by approximately 10fold, the enhancement effect was reduced to 1.5-fold in IFITM1-3 KO cells. Furthermore,
pseudovirus infection was approximately 50-fold higher in IFITM1-3 KO cells. These findings
indicate that endogenous IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 substantially restrict SARS-CoV-2 Spikemediated infection in HeLa-ACE2 cells and that rapalogs promote infection by lowering their
levels in cells. In order to better characterize the degradation program triggered by rapalogs and to
identify cellular proteins other than IFITM that are modulated following rapalog treatment, we
performed proteomics by mass spectrometry on HeLa-ACE2 cells treated with DMSO,
temsirolimus, or ridaforolimus. The complete list of over 7000 proteins detected is available in
Supplemental File 1. While the IFITM proteins themselves were not detected in our analysis, we
identified a select number of additional proteins whose levels were decreased significantly by
rapamycin and/or temsirolimus and, to a lesser extent, by ridaforolimus (Supplemental Figure 4).

To explore the impact of rapalogs on SARS-CoV-2 infection in additional cell types that
model the human respiratory tract, we used primary human small airway (lung) epithelial cells
(herein referred to as small airway cells) and partially transformed human nasal epithelial cells
(UNCNN2TS, herein referred to as nasal cells) [64, 65]. These cells were not permissive to HIVCoV-2 S pseudovirus, but we were able to infect them with a pseudovirus based on vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV-CoV-2 S) [66]. We found that small airway cells were highly permissive to
VSV-CoV-2 S and that rapalogs promoted infection to different extents. Specifically, rapamycin,
everolimus, and temsirolimus enhanced infection by up to 2.5-fold while ridaforolimus was less
active (Figure 6A). In order to draw parallels between the mechanism of action of rapalogs on
different cell types, we assessed the basal levels of IFITM proteins in small airway cells and tested
whether their levels were altered by the drugs. Endogenous IFITM3 protein was detected and was
reduced to different extents by rapalogs, while IFITM1 was found at lower levels and IFITM2 was
not detected at all (Figure 6B). We then asked whether IFITM3 in small airway cells was
consequential for VSV-CoV-2 S infection by using RNA interference. Interestingly, transfection
of control siRNA resulted in increased IFITM1 protein relative to basal levels, but not that of
IFITM2, and specific knockdown of IFITM3 resulted in a more than 3-fold enhancement of
infection (Figure 6C). These results suggest that rapalogs promote SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated
infection in small airway cells, at least in part, by downmodulating IFITM3. We performed a
similar series of experiments in nasal cells and found that, while these cells were relatively resistant
to VSV-CoV-2 S pseudovirus, infection levels were elevated in the presence of rapalogs (Figure
6D). Here, rapamycin, everolimus, and ridaforolimus treatment resulted in higher levels of
infection compared to temsirolimus treatment, indicating that the bioactivity of some rapalogs is
cell-type dependent. When we examined the extent to which endogenous IFITM proteins were
modulated by the drugs in nasal cells, we found that IFITM3 was abundantly expressed and was
differentially downmodulated by rapalogs, with temsirolimus exhibiting the lowest capacity to
decrease IFITM3 levels. In these cells, IFITM1 was barely detectable and IFITM2 was not detected
(Figure 6E). As seen in small airway cells, siRNA transfection induced IFITM1 protein in nasal
cells. Upon specific knockdown of IFITM3, infection was enhanced by more than 20-fold (Figure
6F). Overall, these data support a model whereby rapalog treatment of cells modeling the human
respiratory tract results in drug-dependent degradation of IFITM proteins and increased
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated infection.
Discussion
We previously demonstrated that treatment of cells with micromolar quantities of
rapamycin induces the lysosomal degradation of IFITM proteins via a pathway that is independent
of macroautophagy but dependent upon ESCRT-mediated sorting of IFITM proteins into
intraluminal vesicles of late endosomes [46]. Our understanding of how this degradation pathway
is mediated is incomplete, but it likely results from a form of non-canonical autophagy known as
microautophagy [67]. One type of microautophagy that has been described in yeast and
mammalian cells is characterized by ESCRT-dependent sorting of endolysosomal membrane
proteins into intraluminal vesicles followed by their degradation by lysosomal hydrolases.
Furthermore, there is evidence indicating that microautophagy is regulated by mTOR [68]. It was
recently shown in yeast that mTOR inhibition triggers a ubiquitin- and ESCRT-dependent turnover
of vacuolar (lysosomal) membrane proteins [69, 70]. Apart from our immunoblotting of IFITM
proteins, our proteomics analysis suggests that rapalogs differentially induce a program that turns

over a select group of cellular proteins (1% or less of proteins detected were reduced by 40% or
more following treatment with any rapalog). Ongoing work will identify whether these proteins
are co-regulated directly or indirectly by the same E3 ubiquitin ligase, and whether this ligase is
controlled by mTOR activity.
IFITM2 and IFITM3 are cell surface proteins which are targeted to endolysosomes via a
tyrosine-based endocytic motif (YxxL) in the amino terminus, and phosphorylation regulates this
process [71-75]. In contrast, it is often cited that IFITM1, which lacks the YxxL motif, is primarily
localized to the plasma membrane of cells. However, the carboxy-terminus of IFITM1 contains its
own sorting signal and is responsible for a proportion of IFITM1 being localized to endosomes
[76, 77]. Our previous efforts found that FLAG-tagged IFITM2 and IFITM3 were sensitive to
rapamycin-induced degradation while FLAG-IFITM1 was not [46]. In the current study, we find
that all three of the IFITM proteins, which are expressed at high basal levels in HeLa cells, are
degraded following rapalog treatment. This likely reflects a partial overlap in endolysosomal
localization between IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3. In support of IFITM1 being partially
localized to lysosomes is the fact that it inhibits the cell entry of Marburg and Ebola viruses, which
require lysosomal cathepsins for the final step of viral fusion [78]. There remains much to be
learned about the sequence determinants and cellular machinery required to carry out degradation
of IFITM proteins during rapalog treatment. It was previously discovered that NEDD4 E3 ligase
regulates the degradation of IFITM2 and IFITM3 [74, 79], but whether other E3 ligases mediate
the regulation of IFITM proteins during mTOR inhibition is unknown.
In addition to the degradation of basal IFITM3 expressed at steady-state, we previously
reported that rapamycin promotes the turnover of IFITM3 induced by type-I interferon [46]. While
our results indicate that rapalogs differentially impact basal levels of IFITM proteins in multiple
cell types, we did not assess how they affect those induced by infection. This would be required to
fully understand how rapalogs promote cellular susceptibility to infection, and to what extent
rapalog-mediated regulation of IFITM proteins is responsible. In contrast to HeLa cells, we did
not detect IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 protein in A549 cells under basal conditions. Nonetheless,
it has been shown that IFITM3 is among the most highly induced genes in primary human lung
epithelial cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [82, 83]. Therefore, it is possible that cell type-specific
patterns of virus-induced IFITM will need to be assessed in order to fully understand the effects
of different rapalogs on cellular susceptibility to virus infection. Nonetheless, it is notable that we
observed a relatively high level of basal IFITM3 present in nasal epithelial cells, and furthermore,
that specific knockdown of IFITM3 resulted in a more than 20-fold gain in cellular susceptibility
to SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated infection in this cell type. The upper airway, and the nasal
epithelium in particular, likely represents the initial site of infection by SARS-CoV-2 [84]. It was
reported that infected humans experiencing mild or moderative COVID-19 showed extensive
induction of antiviral genes, including IFITM1 and IFITM3, in their nasal epithelium compared to
individuals suffering from more severe COVID-19 [85]. This finding suggests that cell-intrinsic
immunity in the nasal epithelium plays a role in constraining virus-induced pathology in the lower
respiratory tract. Taken together, these results suggest that rapalog use and its downmodulating
effects on IFITM proteins may facilitate virus spread between humans. It would be interesting to
examine whether any of the other proteins differentially downmodulated or upmodulated by
rapalogs have an impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection in the various cell types studied here.
All of the rapamycin-derived compounds tested here are believed to act as allosteric mTOR
inhibitors by promoting a tertiary complex consisting of drug, FKBP12, and mTOR. In contrast,
tacrolimus (FK506) binds FKBP12 and calcineurin, but not mTOR [80]. The fact that tacrolimus

does not enhance SARS-CoV-2 Spike-mediated infection suggests that mTOR inhibition is
essential to this process. However, we also show that ridaforolimus enhances virus infection in
HeLa and A549 cells to a lesser extent than the other rapalogs, which suggests that binding to
mTOR and FKBP12 is insufficient to explain the phenotype. It is possible that enhancement of
infection results from interactions between rapalogs and cellular proteins other than mTOR and
FKBP12. Rapamycin has been shown to bind additional FKBPs, such as FKBP52, whose levels
may vary between cell types [81]. Our results warrant an in-depth analysis of the cellular proteins
directly bound by different rapalogs, and this should be carried out in different cell lines, since we
show that the impact of ridaforolimus on infection is cell-type dependent.
Overall, and in combination with our previous work [46], these results draw attention to a
novel immunosuppressive property of rapamycin and rapalogs that acts on intrinsic immunity and
impacts cellular susceptibility to infection by multiple viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Rapalogs
are traditionally used for their immunosuppressive effects on adaptive immunity in order to
mitigate systemic immunopathology, and this is one reason why they are being tested for
therapeutic benefit in COVID-19 patients suffering from respiratory distress syndrome. Further
work exploring how dosing of existing rapalogs in animal models impacts both the intended and
unintended consequences of mTOR inhibition is a priority. Furthermore, the development of new
mTOR inhibitors lacking this effect on intrinsic immunity are needed in order to minimize
unintended immunocompromised states in humans.

Ambion. Cells were transfected with 20 nM siRNA using Opti-MEM (Gibco) and Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher).
Virus and pseudovirus infections
SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) was provided by the Centers for Disease
Control. Virus propagation was performed in Vero E6 cells. Virus titers were calculated by plaque
assay performed in Vero E6 cells as follows: Serial 10-fold dilutions were added to Vero E6
monolayers in 48-well plates for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were overlayed with 1.5% carboxymethyl
cellulose (Sigma) in modified Eagle’s medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM
L-glutamine, 50 units per mL penicillin and 50 µg per mL streptomycin. Three days post-infection,
cells were fixed in 10% formalin and stained with crystal violet to visualize and count plaques as
previously described [86]. Titers were calculated as plaque forming units per mL and normalized
as described in the figure captions. HIV-based pseudovirus was produced by transfecting
HEK293T cells with 12 µg of pNL4-3LucR-E- and 4 µg of pcDNA3.1 Spike (CoV, CoV-2, or
MERS), or 2 µg of pPol1II HA and 2 µg of pPol1II NA using TransIT-293 (Mirus). Virus
supernatant was harvested 72 hours post-transfection and filtered through 0.22 µm filters.
Undiluted virus supernatant was added to target cells and incubated for 72 hours prior to lysis with
Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay
System (Promega). VSV-based pseudovirus was produced as previously described [66]. In brief,
HEK293T cells were transfected with 2 µg pcDNA3.1 and CoV, CoV-2, or MERS Spike using
Lipofectamine2000 (Thermo Fisher). At 24 hours post-transfection, culture medium was removed
from cells and 2 mL of VSV-luc/GFP + VSV-G was added. At 48 hours post-infection, virus
supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation at 500xG for 5 mins, and stored. 50-200
µL of virus supernatants were added to target cells for a period of 24 hours prior to fixation with
4% paraformaldehyde (for measurements of GFP+ cells with flow cytometry) or lysis with Passive
Lysis Buffer (for measurements of luciferase activity). E64d or camostat mesylate (25 µM) were
used to pretreat cells for 2 hours prior to virus addition and were maintained for the duration of
infection. For infections with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, rapamycin, everolimus,
temsirolimus, or ridaforolimus (20 µM) were used to pretreat cells for 4 hours and then drugs were
washed away prior to addition of virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. DMSO (Sigma)
was used as a vehicle control. At 1 hour post-virus addition, cells were washed once with 1X PBS
and overlayed with complete medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and titers were
determined on plaque assays performed in Vero E6 cells. For single-round infections using HIVor VSV-based pseudovirus, rapamycin, everolimus, temsirolimus, ridaforolimus, or tacrolimus (20
µM) were used to pretreat cells for 4 hours and were maintained for the duration of infection and

Whole cell lysis was performed with RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with Halt
Protease Inhibitor mixture EDTA-free (Thermo Fisher). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation
and supernatants were collected and stored. Protein concentration was determined with the Protein
Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad), and 10-15 µg of protein was loaded into 12% acrylamide Criterion XT
Bis-Tris Precast Gels (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis was performed with NuPage MES SDS Running
Buffer (Invitrogren) and proteins were transferred to Amersham Protran Premium Nitrocellulose
Membrane, pore size 0.20 µm (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with Odyssey Blocking
Buffer in PBS (Li-COR) and incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted in Odyssey
Antibody Diluent (Li-COR): anti-IFITM1 (60074-1-Ig; Proteintech), anti-IFITM2 (66137-1-Ig;
Proteintech), anti-IFITM3 (EPR5242, ab109429; Abcam), anti-actin (C4, sc-47778; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-hACE2 (ab15348; Abcam), and anti-CoV Spike (PA1-41165; Thermo
Fisher). Secondary antibodies conjugated to DyLight 800 or 680 (Li-Cor) and the Li-Cor Odyssey
CLx imaging system were used to reveal specific protein detection. Images were analyzed and
assembled using ImageStudioLite (Li-Cor).

FRET-based virus-cell fusion assay
HIV-based pseudovirus incorporating BlaM-Vpr and CoV-2 Spike was produced by transfecting
HEK293T cells with pNL4-3E- (15 µg), pCMV4-BlaM-Vpr (5 µg), and pcDNA3.1 CoV-2 Spike
(5 µg) using the calcium phosphate technique. Briefly, six million 293T cells were seeded in a T75
flask. Plasmid DNA was mixed with sterile H2O, CaCl2, and Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer, and the
totality was combined with Hepes-buffered saline (HBS). The transfection volume was added
dropwise, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation,
passed through a 0.45 µm filter, and stored. Titers were measured using an HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit
(XpressBio). 50 ng p25 equivalent of virus was added to HeLa-ACE2 cells for 2 hours. Cells were
washed and labeled with the CCF2-AM β-lactamase Loading Kit (Invitrogen) for 2 hours and
analyzed for virus-cell fusion by flow cytometry as described [87]. Rapamycin, everolimus,
temsirolimus, or ridaforolimus (20 µM) were used to pretreat cells for 4 hours prior to virus
addition and were maintained for the duration of infection. DMSO (Sigma) was used as a vehicle
control.
Western blot, flow cytometry, and antibodies

Proteomics by mass spectrometry
Protein Digestion and TMT labeling. Cell pellets were produced in triplicate from HeLa-ACE2
cells treated with 20 µM rapamycin, temsirolimus, ridaforolimus, or an equivalent volume of
DMSO and lysed in 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 and 8M urea followed by sonication. Lysates were
clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was quantified using BCA protein estimation
kit (Thermo Fisher). One hundred micrograms of lysate were alkylated and digested by addition
of trypsin at a ratio of 1:50 (Promega) and incubating overnight at 37oC. Digestion was acidified
by adding formic acid (FA) to a final concentration of 1% and desalted using peptide desalting
columns (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Peptides were eluted from the

columns using 50% ACN/0.1% FA, dried in a speedvac, and kept frozen at -20oC until further
analysis. For TMT labeling, 15 µg of each sample was reconstituted in 50 µL of 50 mM HEPES,
pH 8.0, and 75 µg of TMTpro label (Thermo Fisher) in 100% ACN was added to each sample.
After incubating the mixture for 1 hr at room temperature with occasional mixing, the reaction was
terminated by adding 8 µL of 5% hydroxylamine. The peptide samples for each condition were
pooled and cleaned using peptide desalting columns (Thermo Fisher). High pH reverse phase
fractionation. The first dimensional separation of the peptides was performed using a Waters
Acquity UPLC system coupled with a fluorescence detector (Waters) using a 150 mm x 3.0 mm
Xbridge Peptide BEMTM 2.5 um C18 column (Waters) operating at 0.35 mL/min. The dried
peptides were reconstituted in 100 µL of mobile phase A solvent (3 mM ammonium bicarbonate,
pH 8.0). Mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher). The column was washed with
mobile phase A for 10 min followed by gradient elution 0- 50% B (10-60 min) and 50-75 %B (6070 min). The fractions were collected every minute. These 60 fractions were pooled into 24
fractions. The fractions were vacuum centrifuged to dryness and stored at -80oC until analysis by
mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry acquisition and data analysis. The dried peptide fractions
were reconstituted in 0.1% TFA and subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography (Thermo
UltimateTM 3000RSLC nano LC system, Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Eclipse mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated using a low pH gradient using 5-50%
ACN over 120 minutes in mobile phase containing 0.1% formic acid at 300 nL/min flow rate. MS
scans were performed in the Orbitrap analyser at a resolution of 120,000 with an ion accumulation
target set at 4e5 and max IT set at 50ms over a mass range of 400-1600 m/z. Ions with determined
charge states between 2 and 5 were selected for MS2 scans in the ion trap with CID fragmentation
(Turbo; NCE 35%; maximum injection time 35 ms; AGC 1 × 104). The spectra were searched
using the Real Time Search Node in the tune file using human Uniprot database using Comet
search algorithm with TMT16 plex (304.2071Da) set as a static modification of lysine and the Ntermini of the peptide. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.0214 Da) was set as a
static modification, while oxidation of methionine residues (+15.9949 Da) was set up as dynamic
modification. For the selected peptide, an SPS–MS3 scan was performed using up to 10 b- and ytype fragment ions as precursors in an Orbitrap at 50,000 resolution with a normalized AGC set at
500 followed by maximum injection time set as “Auto” with a normalized collision energy setting
of 65. Acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against a human Uniprot protein database along
with a contaminant protein database, using a SEQUEST and percolator validator algorithms in the
Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software (Thermo Scientific). The precursor ion tolerance was set at 10
ppm and the fragment ions tolerance was set at 0.02 Da along with methionine oxidation included
as dynamic modification. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues and TMT16 plex
(304.2071Da) was set as a static modification of lysine and the N-termini of the peptide. Trypsin
was specified as the proteolytic enzyme, with up to 2 missed cleavage sites allowed. Searches used
a reverse sequence decoy strategy to control for the false peptide discovery and identifications
were validated using percolator software. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for the
impurities according to the manufacturer’s specification and the abundances of the proteins were
quantified using the summation of the reporter ions for all identified peptides. The reporter
abundances were normalized across all the channels to account for equal peptide loading. Data
from the first replicate of the DMSO, rapamycin, and temsirolimus conditions was excluded from
the analysis due to their being identified as outliers in Principal Component Analysis. As such,
mean abundance values for DMSO, rapamycin, and temsirolimus were calculated from two
replicates while mean abundance values for ridaforolimus was calculated from three replicates.

Figure 2: Rapalogs promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in cervical and lung epithelial cell lines
in a dose-dependent and drug-dependent manner.
(A) HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of everolimus for 4
hours and subsequently exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1. A volume of DMSO
corresponding to the highest dose of everolimus served as vehicle control. Virus-containing
supernatants were harvested at 24 hours and titered on Vero E6 cells by plaque assay and plaqueforming units (pfu) per mL was normalized to 100 in the DMSO condition. (B) A549-ACE2 cells
were treated as in (A) and pfu per mL was normalized to the DMSO condition in HeLa-ACE2TMPRSS2 cells. (C) HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were treated with 20 µM of rapamycin (Ra),
everolimus (Ev), temsirolimus (Te), ridaforolimus (Ri), or an equivalent volume of DMSO (D) for
4 hours and subsequently exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1. Virus-containing
supernatants were harvested at 24 hours and titered on Vero E6 cells by plaque assay and pfu per
mL was normalized to 100 in the DMSO condition. (D) A549-ACE2 cells were treated as in (C)
and pfu per mL was normalized to the DMSO condition in HeLa-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells. All error
bars represent standard error calculated from 3-5 experiments. Statistical analysis was performed
with one-way ANOVA and asterisks indicate significant difference from DMSO. *, p < 0.05; **,
p < 0.01.

decreased differentially by rapalogs.
(A) HeLa-ACE2 cells were treated with 20 µM of rapamycin (Ra), everolimus (Ev), temsirolimus
(Te), ridaforolimus (Ri), or an equivalent volume of DMSO (D) for 4 hours and whole cell lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting was performed with
anti-IFITM2, anti-IFITM3, anti-IFITM1, anti-ACE2, and anti-actin (in that order) on the same
nitrocellulose membrane. (B) Whole cell lysates from HeLa and HeLa IFITM1-3 KO cells
transiently transfected with ACE2 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.
Immunoblotting was performed with anti-IFITM2, anti-IFITM3, anti-IFITM1, anti-ACE2, and
anti-actin (in that order) on the same nitrocellulose membrane. Numbers and tick marks indicate
size (kilodaltons) and position of protein standards in ladder. (C) HeLa and HeLa IFITM1-3 KO
cells were transiently transfected with ACE2 for 24 hours and subsequently treated with 20 µM of
temsirolimus (Te), ridaforolimus (Ri), or an equivalent volume of DMSO (D) for 4 hours. Cells
were exposed to HIV-CoV-2 S pseudovirus and luciferase activity was measured 48 hours later.
Luciferase units were normalized to 100 in the DMSO condition of WT cells. All error bars
represent standard error calculated from 4 experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with
one-way ANOVA and asterisks indicate significant difference from DMSO. *, p < 0.05; **, p <

(A) Primary human small airway epithelial cells were treated with 20 µM of rapamycin (Ra),
everolimus (Ev), temsirolimus (Te), ridaforolimus (Ri), or an equivalent volume of DMSO (D) for
4 hours and subsequently exposed to VSV-CoV-2 S pseudovirus. Cells were fixed at 24 hours and
infection was scored by measuring GFP+ cells with flow cytometry. (B) Whole cell lysates from
primary small airway epithelial cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.
Immunoblotting was performed with anti-IFITM2, anti-IFITM3, anti-IFITM1, and anti-actin (in
that order) on the same nitrocellulose membrane. (C) Primary human small airway epithelial cells
were transfected with siRNA targeting IFITM3 or a non-targeting control siRNA and exposed to
VSV-CoV-2 S pseudovirus 48 hours later. At 24 hours post-virus addition, cells were lysed and
luciferase activity was measured. Luciferase units were normalized to 100 in the control siRNA
condition. siRNA-transfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with
