[Abstract]
We sequenced the genomes of 320 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19
patients in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with
seven million residents. These genomes were from the viruses causing
infections in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic affecting
Houston. Substantial viral genomic diversity was identified, which we
interpret to mean that the virus was introduced into Houston many times
independently by individuals who had traveled from different parts of the
country and the world. The majority of viruses are apparent progeny of
strains derived from Europe and Asia. We found no significant evidence of
more virulent viral types, stressing the linkage between severe disease,
underlying medical conditions, and perhaps host genetics. We discovered
a signal of selection acting on the spike protein, the primary target of
massive vaccine efforts worldwide. The data provide a critical resource for
assessing virus evolution, the origin of new outbreaks, and the effect of
host immune response.

Significance
COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a global pandemic.
To better understand the first phase of virus spread in metropolitan Houston,
Texas, we sequenced the genomes of 320 SARS-CoV-2 strains recovered from
COVID-19 patients early in the Houston viral arc. We identified no evidence that
a particular strain or its progeny causes more severe disease, underscoring the
connection between severe disease, underlying health conditions, and host
genetics. Some amino acid replacements in the spike protein suggest positive
immune selection is at work in shaping variation in this protein. Our analysis
traces the early molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in Houston, and will help
us to understand the origin and trajectory of future infection spikes.

[Introduction]
Pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is now responsible for massive human morbidity and
mortality worldwide (1-4). The virus was first documented to cause severe
respiratory infections in Wuhan, China, beginning in late December 2019 (5-7).
Global dissemination occurred extremely rapidly, and has affected major
population centers on many continents, especially in Asia, Europe, and North
America (8-10). In the United States, Seattle and the New York City region have
been especially important centers of COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
For example, as of April 15, 2020, there were 111,424 confirmed SARS-CoV-2
cases in NYC, causing 29,741 hospitalizations and 10,899 fatalities (11).
Similarly, in Seattle and King County, 4,620 positive patients and 303 deaths
have been reported as of April 15, 2020 (12).
The Houston metropolitan area is the fourth largest and the most
ethnically diverse city in the United States, with a population of approximately 7
million (13). The 2,000-bed Houston Methodist Health System has eight hospitals
and serves a large multinational and socioeconomically diverse patient
population throughout greater Houston. Although the city is well-known as the
energy capital of the world, Houston also has a very large port, and the George
Bush International Airport is a major transportation hub for domestic and
international flights to Asia, Europe, and Central and South America. Many of
these flights provide direct city-to-city service to diverse countries, including
global population centers. The first COVID-19 case in metropolitan Houston was

reported on March 5, 2020 (14). Community spread was suspected of occurring
one week later (14). Many of the first cases in our region were associated with
national or international travel, including areas known to have COVID-19 virus
outbreaks (14). These facts, coupled with the existence of a central molecular
diagnostic laboratory that serves all Houston Methodist hospitals and our very
early adoption of a molecular test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, permitted us to
rapidly interrogate genomic variation among strains causing infections in the
greater Houston area.
We here report that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to the Houston
metropolitan region many independent times from diverse geographic regions,
including Europe, Asia, and South America. The virus spread rapidly and caused
disease throughout the metropolitan region. We identified clear genomic signals
of person-to-person transmission. Some events were known or inferred based on
conventional public health maneuvers, but many were not. In addition, spatialtemporal mapping found evidence of rapid and widespread community
dissemination soon after COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston. Analysis of
the relationship between distinct genomic viral clades and hospitalization did not
reveal significant evidence of more virulent genome types, underscoring the need
for a better understanding of the relationship between severe disease, underlying
medical conditions, gender, and host genetics.

Results
Description of metropolitan Houston. Houston, Texas, is located in the
southwestern United States, 50 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. It is the
most ethnically diverse city in the United States (15). Metropolitan Houston is
comprised predominantly of Harris County plus parts of several contiguous
surrounding counties (Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Liberty,
Montgomery, and Waller). In the aggregate, the metropolitan area includes 9,444
sq. mi. The estimated population size of metropolitan Houston is 7 million (13).
Epidemiologic curve. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Houston
metropolitan region was reported on March 5, 2020 (14), and the first confirmed
case diagnosed in the Houston Methodist Hospital System was reported on
March 6, 2020. Through April 15, 5,602 COVID-19 cases have been reported in
Houston, including 1,097 cases in the Houston Methodist Hospital System (Fig.
1). During the study period (March 5 through March 30, 2020), the Molecular
Diagnostic Laboratory in the Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine
tested 3,080 specimens, of which 406 were positive (13.2%), representing 40%
(358/898) of all confirmed cases in metropolitan Houston. This large percentage
is likely due to the fact that the Houston Methodist Hospital laboratory was the
first hospital-based facility to have molecular testing capacity available.
Viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. We sequenced the
genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains dating to the earliest stages of confirmed
COVID-19 disease in Houston. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of
many diverse viral genomes that in the aggregate represent many of the major

clades identified to date (16) (Fig. 2). Clades A2a, B, and B1 were the three
more abundantly represented phylogenetic groups (Fig. 2).
Geospatial and time series. We examined the spatial and temporal mapping of
the genome data to investigate community spread (Fig. 3). The figure illustrates
evidence of widespread and rapid community dissemination soon after the initial
COVID-19 cases were reported in Houston. There is also evidence to suggest
there were multiple independent strains introduced into metropolitan Houston,
followed by local spread throughout all regions of the community.
Epidemiologically linked patients. We investigated the relationships among
some of the genomes that were obtained from patients known to share common
epidemiologic associations, such as living in the same household. In all
instances, individuals known to be epidemiologically associated had identical or
nearly-identical SARS-CoV-2 genomes, a finding consistent with person-toperson transmission of the virus.
Geospatial relationships of genetically similar isolates. We next tested the
hypothesis that genetically related viruses were constrained to particular
geographic areas of metropolitan Houston. Although in some instances this was
the case, an important observation was that most of the individual related
subclades were comprised of strains distributed over broad geographic areas
(Fig. 4). These findings are consistent with the known propensity of respiratory
virus SARS-CoV-2 to spread rapidly from person to person. Patients with shared
viral genomes likely constitute epidemiologic clusters, as a consequence of direct

transmission to one another, shared transmission through an unknown third
party, or via a reticulate network.
Relationship between viral clades, clinical characteristics of infected
patients, and other metadata. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 genetic subtypes
may have different clinical characteristics, analogous to what was thought to
have occurred with the Ebola virus (17-19) and is known for other infectious
agents. As an initial examination of this issue in SARS-CoV-2, we tested the
hypothesis that patients with disease severe enough to warrant hospitalization
were infected with a non-random subset of virus genotypes. We also tested the
hypothesis of non-random association between virus clades and disease severity
based on in-patient versus out-patient status, the need for mechanical ventilation,
and the number of days on a ventilator. We found no apparent simple
relationship between viral clades and disease severity using these indicators of
disease severity. Similarly, there was no simple relationship between viral clades
and other metadata, such as gender, age, or length of stay (Fig. S1-S7).
Machine learning analysis. Machine learning models were built to predict
mortality, length of stay, in-patient status, or ICU admission based on the viral
genome sequence. F1 scores (the evaluation metric used in classification
algorithms) for most classifiers ranged between 0.5 to 0.6, indicative of classifiers
that are performing similarly to random chance. Outcome (lived versus died) was
only weakly correlated with age in this data set (PCC = 0.318), and similarly
regression models built to predict age and length of stay based on the viral
genome sequence also had poor performance, with R2 values near zero.

Classifiers were also trained to predict host characteristic, gender and ethnic
group. The two largest ethnic groups in the patient population were African
American and Caucasian, as recorded in the electronic medical record. The
binary classification model had an F1 score of 0.67 [0.51-0.83, 95% CI], likely
reflecting social networks in early person-to-person transmission. A table of
classifier accuracy scores and performance information is provided as Table S1.
Analysis of the nsp12 polymerase gene. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes
an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) used to replicate this RNA virus.
Two amino acid substitutions (Phe476Leu and Val553Leu) in the nsp12 RdRp
have been reported to confer significant resistance in vitro to remdesivir, an
adenosine analog (20). Remdesivir is inserted into RNA chains by RdRp during
replication, resulting in premature termination and inhibition of virus. This
compound has shown prophylactic and therapeutic benefit against MERS-CoV
experimental infection in rhesus macaques (21). A recent publication describing
results from a compassionate use protocol reported that remdesivir may have
therapeutic benefit in some hospitalized patients (22). If efficacy is confirmed by
a randomized controlled trial, this drug may be be widely used in large numbers
of patients worldwide.
To acquire baseline data about allelic variation in the gene encoding
nsp12 RdRp, we analyzed the 320 sequenced viral genomes. The analysis
identified 12 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp12,
resulting in 11 amino acid replacements throughout the protein (Table 1). The
most common amino acid change was Pro322Leu, identified in 224 of the 320

10

Houston isolates. This amino acid replacement is present in genomes from the
A2a clade, and distinguishes the A2a clade from other SARS-CoV-2 clades. The
other amino acid changes in nsp12 were mainly present in single isolates from
individual Houston strains, and some have been identified in other strains in the
global GISAID collection (23, 24). A prominent exception was the identification of
29 strains with a Met600Ile polymorphism. All 29 strains were phylogenetically
very closely related members of the A2a clade, and they all also had the P322L
amino acid replacement characteristic of this clade (Fig. S8). These data indicate
that the Met600Ile change is the derived state among strains with the Pro322Leu
replacement. Importantly, none of the observed amino acid polymorphisms in
nsp12 were located precisely at the two sites associated with remdesivir in vitro
resistance (20), and 10 of the 11 polymorphic amino acids are located on the
surface of this RdRp. However, importantly, the Ala448Val replacement occurs in
an amino acid that is located directly above the nucleotide substrate binding site
that is comprised of Lys545, Arg553, and Arg555, as recently shown by structural
studies (25, 26) (Fig. 5). The Ala448 position is comparable to Val553 (Fig. 5),
and a Val553Leu mutation in SARS-CoV was identified to confer resistance to
remdesivir (20).
Analysis of the gene encoding the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 and related
coronavirus such as SARS-CoV and MERS gain entry into susceptible host cells
using a densely glycosylated viral-surface molecule knows as spike (S) protein.
The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its close coronavirus relatives binds
directly to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter host cells.

Thus, S protein is a major translational research target, including small molecule
inhibitors and extensive vaccine efforts globally (27, 28). Analysis of the gene
encoding the S protein identified 41 SNPs, including 25 that produce amino acid
changes (Table 2, Fig. 6A). Seven of these replacements (A263V, F456L,
S967R, T1027I, M1050V, K1157M, and Q1208H) are not represented in the
GISAID database as of April 15, 2020. F456 makes contact with the human
ACE2 receptor, occupying a pocket formed by ACE2 residues Thr27, Asp30 and
Lys31 (Fig. 6B) (29). The F456L substitution is expected to detrimentally affect
binding to ACE2, as the shorter Leu side chain would not fill the pocket well. We
note that seven of the amino acid replacements map to the periphery of the S1
subunit N-terminal domain (NTD). Four of these replacements (A27S, T29I,
G261V, and A263V) can be mapped to the recently determined cryo-EM
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (27), whereas three other amino acid
changes (L18F, T22I, and H69Y) are located in flexible NTD loops that could not
be modeled (Fig. 6A). The clustering of amino acid replacements to a distinct
region of the protein, together with the occurrence of two different amino acid
replacements occurring at the same residue is a strong signal of positive
selection. Inasmuch as infected patients make antibodies against the NTD
region, we favor the idea that host immune selection is a key force contributing to
amino acid variation in this region, resulting in an enhanced fitness phenotype of
virus variants. Also of note, the D614G replacement was observed in 70% (224
of 320 strains) of the strains sequenced in this study. Residue D614 is located in
subdomain 2 (SD-2) of the S protein, and it forms a hydrogen bond and

electrostatic interaction with two residues in the S2 subunit of a neighboring
protomer (Fig. 6C). Replacement of aspartate with glycine would eliminate both
interactions, thereby substantively weakening the contact between the S1 and S2
subunits. We speculate that this weakening produces a more fusogenic spike
protein, because S1 must first dissociate from S2 before the S2 subunit can
refold and mediate fusion of viral and cell membranes. Stated another way, virus
strains with the D614G variant may be better able to enter host cells, potentially
resulting in enhanced spread.

Discussion
We discovered substantial genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses causing
COVID-19 disease in Houston, Texas. The majority of cases studied are progeny
of strains that cause widespread disease in European and Asian countries. We
interpret these data as demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was introduced
into Houston many times independently, likely by individuals who had traveled to
different parts of the world. In support of this interpretation, the first cases in
metropolitan Houston were associated with a travel history to a known COVID-19
region (14). The data are consistent with the fact that Houston is a large
international city characterized by a multi-ethnic population.
The diversity present in our 320 viral genomes contrasts somewhat with
data reported recently by Gonzalez-Reiche et al. (30), who studied 84 SARSCoV-2 isolates causing disease in patients in the New York City region. Those
investigators concluded that the vast majority of disease was caused by progeny

of strains imported from Europe. Similarly, Bedford et al. (31) reported that much
of the COVID-19 disease in the Seattle, Washington area was caused by strains
that are progeny of a virus strain recently introduced from China.
The viral diversity present in metropolitan Houston permitted us to test the
hypothesis that distinct viral clades were nonrandomly associated with
hospitalized COVID-19 patients or disease severity. Although our sample size is
relatively small, we found little evidence to support this hypothesis. Clearly, this
important matter warrants further study with a larger sample size, and this
analysis is currently underway.
We used machine learning classifiers in an attempt to identify SNPs that
contribute to increased infection severity or otherwise affect virus-host outcome.
The models could not be trained to accurately predict these outcomes from the
viral genome sequence data, which may be due to the small sample size and
class imbalance. As such, no particular SNPs were identified that are predictive
of disease severity or infection outcome. Classifiers were also trained to search
for predictors of host characteristics such as age by decade, gender, and ethnic
group. We found that the African American versus Caucasian populations had a
predictive signal, and hence potentially significant SNPs, which may be borne out
with increased sampling in these two groups. However, examination of the
geographic distribution of the viral isolates classified using this model largely
coincided with the demographic distribution of ethnic groups in the Houston
metropolitan region. As such, the underlying SNPs found by the model may

reflect social networks present early in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Houston
metropolitan area, rather than distinct viral or human genetic factors.
Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog that has been reported to have activity
against MERS-CoV, a coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 (21). Recently, Grein
et al. (22) reported that this drug shows promise in treating COVID-19 patients in
a relatively small compassionate use protocol. Because in vitro resistance of
SARS-CoV to remdesivir has been reported to be caused by either of two amino
acid replacements in RdRp (Phe476Leu and Val553Leu), we interrogated our
data for polymorphisms in the nsp12 gene. Although we identified 11 different
inferred amino acid replacements in the 320 genomes analyzed, none of these
were located at the two positions associated with resistance in vitro. These
findings suggest that if remdesivir proves to be efficacious in COVID-19 patients,
and is deployed widely as a treatment, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 strains
currently circulating should be susceptible to this drug. However, the Ala448Val
polymorphism we identified occurs at an amino acid site that intriguingly is
located directly above the nucleotide substrate entry channel and nucleotide
binding residues Lys545, Arg553, and Arg555 (20, 25) (Fig. 5). One possibility is
that substitution of the smaller alanine residue with the bulkier valine may impose
structural constraints for the modified nucleotide analog to bind and thereby
disfavor remdesivir binding. This in turn leads to reduced incorporation of
remdesivir into the nascent RNA, increased fidelity of RNA synthesis, and thus
drug resistance. A similar mechanism has been proposed for a V553L change
(20). We also identified one strain with a Lys477Asn replacement in nsp12. This

substitution is located very close to a Phe476Leu replacement reported to
produce partial resistance to remdesivir in vitro in SARS-CoV patients from 2004,
although the amino acid positions are numbered differently in SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2. Structural studies have suggested that this amino acid is surfaceexposed, and distant from known key functional elements. Our observed
Lys477Asn change is also located in a conserved motif described as a finger
domain of RdRp (Fig. 5). One speculative possibility is that Lys477 is involved in
binding a yet unidentified cofactor such as nsp7 or nsp8, an interaction that could
modify nucleotide binding and/or fidelity at a distance. These data warrant
additional study in larger patient cohorts, especially individuals treated with
remdesivir.
Analysis of the gene encoding the spike protein identified many new
inferred amino acid replacements not present in available databases. These
data, coupled with structural information available for S protein, raises the
possibility that many of the amino acid variants have functional consequences.
For example, clustering of several amino acid changes to the NTD suggests
varying residues in this region bestow a fitness phenotype. Regardless, we are
now beginning to acquire critical information about the location and extent of
amino acid replacements occurring in the S protein in natural populations of
SARS-CoV-2. These data permitted generation of many biomedically relevant
hypotheses now under study.

Concluding statement
Our work represents analysis of the largest sample of SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequences to date from patients in the southern United States. This investigation
was facilitated by the fact that we had rapidly assessed the suitability and
performance of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test in January 2020,
more than a month before the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed in Houston.
Our large healthcare system has eight hospitals and many clinics located in
geographically diverse areas of the city. These facilities serve patients of very
diverse ethnicities and socioeconomic status, thus our data likely represent a
broad overview of virus diversity causing infections throughout metropolitan
Houston. We acknowledge that not every “twig” of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary
tree in Houston is represented in these data because the samples studied were
not comprehensive.
The genomes reported here represent the first strains documented to
cause COVID-19 disease in the Houston area. Thus, they are an important
resource that will underpin further and our ongoing study of SARS-CoV-2
molecular evolution and dissemination in Houston. As of April 15, 2020, there
were 5,602 reported cases of COVID-19 in metropolitan Houston, with the
number of cases growing daily. We are now sequencing virus genomes
essentially in real time from infected patients, which will permit us to provide
important data that can be exploited to facilitate an enhanced public health
response to this pandemic.

Several regions have reported a flattening of the COVID-19 infection
curve, for example the New York City area, China, Italy, and Iceland. This trend
suggests that public health and laboratory measures to decrease viral spread are
showing promise. In Houston, analogous epidemiologic data have recently been
reported. If a decreased virus dissemination rate is successfully maintained, it will
be especially important to combine traditional public health control approaches
(i.e., case identification and contact tracing) with genome sequence information
to deconvolute patterns of infection spread. The availability of extensive viral
genome data dating from the earliest reported cases of COVID-19 in
metropolitan Houston, coupled with the database we have now constructed, may
provide important insight into the origin of new infection spikes occurring as
social distancing constraints are relaxed and the region begins to re-open. The
genome data will also be useful in assessing ongoing molecular evolution in the
spike and other proteins, as herd immunity is generated, either by natural
exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or vaccination. The signal of positive
selection contributing to diversity in the spike protein is especially concerning and
warrants close, intense attention.

(https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medicaldevices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2#offeringtests). The assay follows the
protocol published by the WHO (https://www.who.int/docs/defaultsource/coronaviruse/protocol-v2-1.pdf) and uses the 7500 Fast Dx instrument
(ABI) and 7500 SDS software (ABI). Testing was performed on material obtained
from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs immersed in universal transport
media (UTM), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or sputum treated with dithiothreitol
(DTT). To standardize specimen collection, an instructional video was created for
Houston Methodist healthcare workers
(https://vimeo.com/396996468/2228335d56). Total viral RNA was extracted from
patient specimens and tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 with an EZ1 virus
extraction kit and EZ1 Advanced XL instrument with the Virus card (Qiagen), or
QIASymphony DSP Virus kit and QIASymphony instrument (Qiagen).
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. Libraries for whole viral genome
sequencing were prepared according to version 1 of the ARTIC nCoV-2019
sequencing protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). Long reads were
generated with the LSK-109 sequencing kit, 24 native barcodes (NBD104 and

NBD114 kits), and a GridION instrument (Oxford Nanopore). Short reads were
generated with the NexteraXT kit and a MiSeq or NextSeq 550 instrument
(Illumina).
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence analysis. Consensus viral genome sequences
from the Houston isolates were generated using the ARTIC nCoV-2019
bioinformatics pipeline. Publicly available genomes and metadata were acquired
through GISAID on April 13, 2020 (16). GISAID sequences containing greater
than 1% N characters, and Houston sequences with greater than 5% N
characters were removed from consideration. Identical GISAID sequences
originating from the same geographic location with the same collection date were
also removed from consideration to reduce redundancy. Nucleotide sequence
alignments for the combined Houston and GISAID strains were generated using
MAFFT version 7.130b with default parameters (32). Sequences were manually
curated in JalView (33) to trim the ends and to remove sequences containing
spurious inserts. Phylogenetic trees were generated using FastTree with the
generalized time-reversible model for nucleotide sequences (34). Trees were
parsed, annotated, and visualized using the R packages treeio and ggtree (3537). CLC Genomics Workbench (QIAGEN) was used to generate the trees in the
supplemental figures. Genomes from the Houston strains are available in the
EpiCoV collection on GISAID (gisaid.org).
Analysis of the nsp12 polymerase and S protein genes. The nsp12 viral
polymerase and S protein genes were analyzed by plotting SNP density in the
consensus alignment using Python (Python v3.4.3, Biopython Package v1.72).

The frequency of the SNP in the Houston isolates was assessed, along with the
amino acid change for nonsynonymous SNPs.
Epidemiologic curve. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases was
obtained from USAFacts.org (https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronaviruscovid-19-spread-map/) for Austin, Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston,
Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller counties. Positive cases for Houston
Methodist Hospital patients were obtained from the Laboratory Information
System and plotted using the documented collection time.
Geospatial mapping. The home address zip code for all SARS-CoV-2 positive
patients was used to generate a frequency heat map using the Microsoft Power
BI Filled map visualization. The home address for patients whose isolates were
sequenced was matched to a dictionary of addresses downloaded from
OpenAddresses.io (https://openaddresses.io/) to obtain the latitude and longitude
geocoding data. Because addresses are transcribed and subject to manual error,
the fuzzywuzzyR package was used to match the best address in the dictionary.
All address matches were manually reviewed for accuracy. The latitude/longitude
coordinates were plotted onto a map using the Microsoft Power BI Desktop Map
visualization.
To examine geographic relatedness among genetically similar isolates,
the geospatial maps were filtered to four small independent clades. The home
address of the patients was again visualized using the Microsoft Power BI
Desktop Map visualization.

Time series. The geospatial data were filtered into three time intervals
(3/5/2020-3/16/2020, 3/5/2020-3/23/2020, and 3/5/2020-3/30/2020) to illustrate
the spread of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients we identified over time.
Machine learning analysis. Machine learning models were trained to predict
patient metadata categories including mortality, length of stay, inpatient versus
outpatient status, ICU admission, overall outcome, gender, age, and ethnicity
from viral sequence data. Models were trained with the consensus whole
genome FASTA files by dividing each viral genome into 15-mer oligonucleotide
k-mers, which were used as features to train XGBoost models (38) as described
previously (39, 40). Models were assessed by computing F1 scores for classifiers
and R2 scores for regression models. Unless otherwise stated, data for the first 5folds of a 10-fold cross validation are shown.
