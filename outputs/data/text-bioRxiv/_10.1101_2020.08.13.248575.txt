Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a major threat across the globe. Here, we
developed machine learning approaches to identify key pathogenic regions in coronavirus genomes. We
trained and evaluated 7,562,625 models on 3,665 genomes including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARSCoV and other coronaviruses of human and animal origins to return quantitative and biologically
interpretable signatures at nucleotide and amino acid resolutions. We identified hotspots across the SARSCoV-2 genome including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp and other proteins. Finally, we
integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of
sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted
pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural and immunological features, providing
an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies. This metavirome-based framework can
also be applied for rapid characterization of new coronavirus strains or emerging pathogenic viruses.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become an unprecedented on-going global public health and economic
crisis since its emergence at the end of the year 2019

1,2

. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than

5.4 million people and caused over 340,000 deaths globally as of May 25th, 2020 3. Although pathogenic
coronaviruses have repeatedly emerged from the wild to become infectious to human populations, the
common genetic and molecular features that drive the disease-causing potential of these viruses are still
unclear. Identifying genetic elements and specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that make it
dangerous is critical for public health prevention and disease mitigation, as well as the development of
vaccines and therapeutics. To address the current lack of systematic understanding of the pathogenic
genomic features for coronaviruses, we developed a set of machine learning (ML) approaches focused on
unbiased scanning and scoring of key pathogenicity-linked regions in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and
other respiratory disease-causing coronaviruses 4 that distinguish them from non-pathogenic coronaviruses.
We also harness these toolkits to identify genetic elements at high resolution that interface with critical viral
protein functions and immunogenicity for vaccine development.
Results
Ensemble machine learning and statistical meta-model identifies high-resolution pathogenic features
in coronavirus genomes.
We developed a rigorous, integrative ML-based approach to identify regions that contribute to coronavirus
pathogenicity, incorporating Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bernoulli Naïve
Bayes (BNB), Gradient Boosting Classifiers (GBC) and Multi-layer Perceptron Classifiers (MLPC)
(Methods) (Figure 1A). First, we aligned 3,665 Coronaviridae family genomes obtained from the Virus
Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database

with diverse taxonomic and host features

(Figure 1B). We chose a set of five different supervised learning algorithms that have robust performance
and represent methodological diversity including ensembles of decision trees, Bayes’ theorem, and neural
networks. Then, we took an ensemble learning approach, where outputs from the multiple classifiers are
combined to give higher confidence predictions, to train and evaluate 7,562,625 advanced ML models. To
set up our predictor classes, we considered several classification strategies to capture signatures associated
with pathogenicity (Figure 1C). We hypothesized that sequence features that enable coronaviruses to jump
from animal populations to humans (strategy A) and that distinguish SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 from other coronaviruses (strategy B) to likely be important contributors to pathogenicity. We also

considered features that specifically distinguish SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that infect
human hosts (strategy C) from all other coronaviruses. After training and evaluating our base ML models
on six bp sliding windows tiled across the alignment (100,835 windows), we integrated performance
accuracy scores into a statistically rigorous meta-model based on minimum entropy windows (Methods)
to obtain biologically interpretable nucleotide-level coronavirus pathogenicity (NT-COPA) scores for every
nucleotide in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure 1D).
Empirically, ensemble approaches outperform single predictors and tend to yield better results when there
is significant diversity in models 6,7. In addition to the three classification strategies, our base ML models
covered five cross-validation folds (using 80% of samples for model training and 20% of samples for
validation for a given permutation) and five different machine learning methods comprising SVC, RF, BNB,
MLPC, and GBC. Because the samples in the standard dataset are ordered by alignment, individual models
for different cross-validation folds may have dissimilar training compositions and therefore accuracy scores
(Figure S2); however, this tradeoff may come with a greater diversity of biologically meaningful learned
features. For comprehensiveness, we also trained our models on a dataset where genome samples are
shuffled (Figure S3). While individual classifier performance increased, they also become more correlated
(reducing model diversity) and led to higher saturation of NT-COPA score signals (Figure S3D) compared
to results obtained from our standard dataset (Figure 1D). Since we pool together all cross-validation scores
with training coverage of all samples, no genomic information should be lost for our statistical meta-model
analyses with either method. We focused our subsequent analyses on results obtained from our standard
dataset for biological interpretability, but provide NT-COPA scores obtained from both methods as a
resource.
Identification of local pathogenic hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
Next, we looked at NT-COPA score distributions intersected with the annotated SARS-CoV-2 genome to
see if they can be used to identify potential pathogenicity hotspots. We found that the NT-COPA scores
reflected quantitative and high-resolution signatures for characterizing individual base pairs and amino
acids within SARS-CoV-2 features (Figure 2A). To address the challenge of systematically defining
hotspot regions from such high-resolution data, we considered that scores for a given base pair should reflect
local genomic information capture due to our sliding window based approach for training the base ML
models. Therefore, we considered kernel smoothing to be an appropriate nonparametric curve estimation
method for a region-based approach to identify hotspots (Methods). We calculated the kernel regression
estimate at each base pair using the NT-COPA scores, and used the estimates to determine local signal

maxima (peaks) within SARS-CoV-2 features. This approach yielded 2,473 peaks across the SARS-CoV2 genome, which mark local pathogenicity hotspots (Figure 2B). Limitations to the kernel smoothing based
approach include that identified peaks may have low NT-COPA scores as they only reflect local maxima
(which may be addressed by using score thresholds), and that high signal density regions may only return
a single peak. The advantage of the approach is that it is unbiased and systematic. Both systematic and
customized strategies can be applied to generate biologically meaningful insights from these pathogenicityassociated scores.
Spike protein pathogenic hotspots reveal a furin cleavage site and contact sites with ACE2.
To biologically validate the significance of our candidate hotspots, we performed a series of in-depth
evolutionary and structural analyses. There has been considerable focus on the spike protein as it facilitates
coronavirus entry into target cells 8,9. For SARS-CoV-2, interaction between the trimeric spike glycoprotein
and the human host ACE2 receptor triggers a cascade of events that leads to the fusion between cell and
viral membranes 10. We examined the NT-COPA score distributions and peaks for the spike protein and
found the strongest signal to be peak S-2044, corresponding to amino acid position 682 (Figure 2A). In
order to determine the evolutionary significance of this hotspot, we aligned the spike protein amino acid
sequences for Coronaviridae family viruses across various species and hosts and compared the alignment
with the NT-COPA score density for peak S-2044 and nearby residues (Figure 3B).
We find that this peak corresponds to a functional polybasic furin cleavage site (RRAR) at the junction
between the S1/S2 subunits, which has been reported to expand SARS-CoV-2 tropism and/or enhance its
infectivity 11. The leading proline that is also inserted at the site for SARS-CoV-2 (for PRRA insertion) has
been shown to result in addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678 and S686 which flank the cleavage site
by structural analysis

12

. Nucleotides for the T678 codon and the first nucleotide for the S686 codon

(corresponding to position S-2056) all have high NT-COPA scores and are included as part of the peak S2044 associated hotspot. More generally, this hotspot, which spans nucleotide positions 2,021 to 2,056
(amino acid positions 674 to 686, all with NT-COPA scores > 40), corresponds to amino acid insertions
that contribute to distinguishing betacoronaviruses from alpha- and gammacoronaviruses (Figure 3A-B).
The functional consequence of the polybasic cleavage site and the predicted O-linked glycans in SARSCoV-2 remains unclear, although possibilities for the latter include creation of mucin-like glycan shields
involved in immune evasion 12. These analyses showed that the ML-based approach independently learned
pathogenicity signals that correspond to important features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, several of which
have been previously validated or are under active investigation.

To see if ML-scored pathogenicity hotspots can offer functionally significant structural insights, we
examined the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interface with ACE2. We calculated the amino
acid resolution COPA scores (AA-COPA, or COPA for short) by averaging the NT-COPA scores for
codons. We then examined the high AA-COPA regions in the spike protein RBD, and identified two hotspot
regions comprising residues NNL at positions 439-441 and residues NCYF at positions 487-490 (Figure
3C). We then mapped the COPA scores onto a recently solved crystal structure of the wild-type SARSCoV-2 RBD bound to human ACE2 10, and found that the NCYF hotspot included contact site residues at
the RBD-ACE2 interface (Figure 3D). Of the 13 hydrogen bonds at the SARS-CoV-2 RBD - ACE2
interface identified from the wild-type structure (Figure S5B), 3 hydrogen bonds are included in the NCYF
hotspot: N487-Q24, N487-Y83, and Y489-Y83. Notably, all three of these SARS-CoV-2 - ACE2 hydrogen
bonds are conserved for the SARS-CoV RBD - ACE2 interface, as N473-Q24, N473-Q24, Y475-Y83 10.
Both of the coronavirus contact site residues in the SARS-CoV-2 NCYF hotspot (N487 and Y489) are
relatively conserved amongst proximal strains, but differ in less proximal strains (Figure 3A, 3E),
suggesting that acquisition of these sites were important evolutionary events in development of high affinity
coronavirus binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, an alternative, chimeric RBD-engineered
structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex demonstrated that structural changes in one of
the ridge loops that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV introduces an additional main-chain
hydrogen bond between residues N487 and A475 in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding motif (RBM),
causing the ridge to form more contacts with the N-terminal helix of ACE2 13. The COPA-structural joint
analysis suggested that the ML models automatically learned the SARS-CoV-2 NCYF hotspot as a
proximally conserved contributor to coronavirus pathogenicity.
We then examined the other hotspot region identified in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, comprising residues N439,
N440, and L441. Residue N439 was not identified to be involved in contacts between SARS-CoV-2 RBD
and ACE2 receptor in the wild-type structure (Figure S5C). However, its associated residue in the SARSCoV RBD, R426, forms a strong salt bridge with E329 on ACE2 and a hydrogen bond with Q325

10,13,14

(Figure S5D). Evolutionary analysis reveals that the NNL (SARS-CoV-2 coordinates) or RNI (SARS-CoV
coordinates) hotspot has substantial sequence divergence from other coronaviruses across species and hosts
(Figure S5A). While the significance for the NNL hotspot for SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, R426 is a
functionally important residue for ACE2 receptor binding in SARS-CoV, and scored highly in the
classification strategies focused on learning sequence determinants of pathogenicity that are generalizable
across respiratory disease-causing coronaviruses.

RdRp pathogenic hotspots reveal RNA contact sites and codon composition biases.
Another key component of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also
known as nonstructural protein 12 (NSP12). RdRp/NSP12 forms a complex with accessory factors
including NSP7 and NSP8, which increase template binding and processivity, to catalyze the synthesis of
viral RNA

15,16

. As this complex plays an important role in the viral replication and transcription cycle,

RdRp is currently being investigated as a target of nucleotide analog antiviral drugs such as remdesivir for
COVID-19 treatment

17,18

. To identify hotspot regions in RdRp associated with pathogenicity, we

intersected its sequence with the ML-generated COPA scores (Figure 4A). We then mapped the COPA
scores onto a recently solved cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex bound
to template-primer RNA and the triphosphate form of remdesivir (RTP) 16 (Figure 4B). We focus on two
structural regions of interest in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with high COPA score signal density. Region (1), which
comprises residues ERVRQ (positions 180-184) and DRY (positions 284-286), reflects a previously
uncharacterized feature of RdRp with a high density of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues.
Whether the hotspot residues in region (1) create networks of hydrophilic interactions that contribute to
pathogenicity require further experimental study; nevertheless, this region highlights pathogenicity features
that were learned from the ML models in an unbiased manner. Region (2), which comprise residues K500,
S501, W509, and I847, includes key residues involved in direct RdRp protein-RNA interactions. We
observed that the identified COPA hotspot residues generally exhibit high amino acid conservation amongst
proximal strains and differentiation in less proximal strains (Figure 4C and Figure S6B), with a notable
exception of residues K500 and S501.
We were surprised at this exception since initially it was unclear why our ML approach would assign
residues K500 and S501 high COPA scores if these positions exhibit such strong evolutionary conservation
across species and hosts, as these positions should then not be able to distinguish pathogenic coronaviruses.
To examine these regions at the nucleotide resolution, we returned to our aligned genome used for training
the base ML models, and generated nucleotide composition frequencies (presented as motifs of sequence
logos) for codons associated with the hotspot residues (Figure 4D). The ERVRQ motif reveals conservation
amongst the pathogenic coronaviruses that differentiate them from the high diversity of non-pathogenic
coronaviruses in this region. These results are expected given the goals of our methods. The KS motif,
however, reveals codon composition bias that differentiate SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at the nucleotide
level from MERS-CoV and non-pathogenic coronaviruses. This bias is particularly striking for residue
S501, where all three nucleotides differentiate the SARS strains from other coronaviruses, despite

conserving a serine residue. Whether these codon composition biases reflect selection, recombination, or
more generalized codon usage biases require further study. Nevertheless, these results highlight the learned
evolution signatures of critical features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome at different levels.
Integration of genomic pathogenicity profiles with B cell and T cell immunogenic features.
There is a dire need for rapid development of effective vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, but given
the novelty of the virus there are currently none approved specifically for SARS-CoV-2. Although a few
vaccine candidates are in active clinical trials (e.g. Moderna, Pfizer/BioNtech), most of the current
approaches use the spike glycoprotein as a target and primarily use full length or simple partial ORFs 19. It
is unclear if this single target will prove to be sufficient for mounting protective and prolonged immunity
for humans. More generally, limited information on which parts of the virus are recognized by human
immune responses is a major knowledge gap impeding effective vaccine design, although efforts are
currently underway to study patterns of immunodominance 20 and to identify conserved epitopes for crossreactive antibody binding 21. While current vaccine strategies focus on inducing B cell humoral responses,
T cell immunity comprises another dominant domain of immune responses essential for viral vaccines 22–
24

and may play an important role in eliminating SARS-CoV-2

20,25

. Therefore, it is important to examine

both B cell and T cell epitopes and consider more precise pathogenic and immunogenic regions that could
potentially induce a stronger immune response.
We thus set out to identify those regions by intersecting both pathogenic hotspots and immunogenic
hotspots. To identify regions in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that are predicted to be both pathogenic and
immunologically relevant, we ran B cell epitope analysis (Figure 5A) as well as T cell MHC-I and MHCII binder predictions, and then integrated them with the ML-generated COPA scores (Figure 5B, Figure
6B, and Figure 7A). Surprisingly, we found that for spike and nucleocapsid proteins, high COPA
pathogenic regions significantly overlap with potential B cell epitopes (hypergeometric test, p < 0.008 for
spike, and p < 0.0012 for nucleocapsid) (Figure 5A, Figure 6A). For T cell epitopes, we prioritize peptides
by counts of pathogenic hotspot peaks obtained from the kernel smoothing analysis. These convergent
regions may enrich for highly immune-reactive elements and help epitope prioritization to guide vaccine
target selection more precisely on functionally important regions of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5B, Figure 6B,
Figure 7A). In addition to potentially mounting stronger immunity, incorporating pathogenicity signals
may help developing vaccines that generate immune responses enriched in neutralization of the more
dangerous viral elements. We join other efforts for systematic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 features 26

and provide in this study all the regional hotspots as consensus regions for next-generation precision vaccine
development.
Discussion
This study developed a rigorous ensemble learning framework that integrates base ML models and a
statistical meta-model to distinguish pathogenic sequence features of coronaviruses down to base pair and
amino acid resolutions with quantitative and biologically interpretable COPA scores. By training and
evaluating a high number of diverse ML models on a large collection of coronavirus genomes of human
and animal origins, we identified pathogenic hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. Comparative
validation with previous work through in-depth, biologically-motivated investigation showed various
intersections of common key features, while the ML approach itself is fully unbiased in terms of scoring
and generation of a large number of previously unidentified candidate hotspots. For example, the
significance of these hotspots were shown with in-depth evolutionary and structural analyses of the spike
protein and RdRp, which are important SARS-CoV-2 genetic elements under active investigation. The
integrative analysis of pathogenicity-associated genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitopes converged
on regions of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that are predicted to be both pathogenic and immunologically
relevant, which provides a collection of feature-rich elements that potentially serve as candidates for
prioritization and enrichment of key sequence targets to guide vaccine development.
While we focused our downstream analysis here on spike protein and RdRp to demonstrate the
interpretability and functional significance of the COPA scores learned from our framework, we emphasize
that the learned features from this study are genome-wide and may provide insights into less characterized
SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural proteins. For example, we noticed that our framework identified
a high density of pathogenic peaks in ORF8 (Figure 2B), a protein whose function remains mysterious 27.
A recent pre-print has identified a 382-nt deletion variant that covers nearly the entirety of ORF8 from
strains isolated from hospitalized patients in Singapore 28, which were implied to lead to reduced virulence
of SARS-CoV-2 based on experimental data from SARS-CoV OFR8 deletion variants 29. Whether ORF8
is in fact an important driver of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity will require further study; meanwhile, the
pathogenicity signatures identified here may constitute an unbiased collection for regional dissection
through viral experiments.
Given the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to identify functionally
important features of SARS-CoV-2. While much effort is currently underway to characterize the spike

protein, RdRp, and other proteins suggested to be important from prior studies on coronaviruses, there has
been limited information on sequence determinants of pathogenicity at the global, metavirome-wide scale.
We demonstrate here how harnessing the predictive power of ML or other artificial intelligence algorithms
may be used to identify such features in a systematic manner. While our ML strategies are based on primary
sequences, future ML algorithms that incorporate 3D structures may generate additional insights that cannot
be obtained from linear sequence analysis alone, and further enhance the prediction of pathogenicity,
immunogenicity, or other important elements of viral proteins. This study demonstrates the development
and application of ML to coronavirus genomes with integrative analyses, which is not limited to
coronaviruses but can be broadly applied to other viral genomes or microbial pathogens to gain insights on
pathogenicity and immunogenicity.

for a given window were converted to binary vector representations using LabelEncoder and
OneHotEncoder from the Python scikit-learn library 31, for integer encoding of labels and one-hot encoding
respectively. Additional Python libraries used include BioPython 32, NumPy 33, and pandas 34.
Training and evaluating machine learning base models:
Genome metadata was converted to binary vector classifications with “1” representing predictor class
genomes depending on classification strategy and “0” representing all other genomes. Three different
classification strategies were used: (1) predictor class comprised coronavirus samples infecting human
hosts, (2) predictor class comprised all SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV samples, and (3)
predictor class comprised SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV samples specifically infecting

human hosts. Five supervised learning classifiers from scikit-learn were used for training and evaluation,
with seeds set at 17 for algorithms that use a random number generator. Support vector classifiers (SVC)
were trained with a linear kernel and regularization parameter of 1.0; random forest (RF) classifiers were
trained with 100 estimators; Bernoulli Naïve Bayes (BNB) were trained with alpha of 1.0 with the
“fit_prior” parameter set as true to learn class prior probabilities; multi-layer perceptron (MLPC) classifiers
were trained with “lbfgs” solver, alpha of 1e-5, 5 neurons in the first hidden layer, and 2 neurons in the
second hidden layer; gradient boosting classifiers (GBC) were trained with “deviance” loss function,
learning rate of 0.1, and 100 estimators. All estimators were trained and evaluated with stratified 5-fold
cross-validation on each window, using 80% of the data for training and 20% of the data for validation.
Statistical hypothesis test-based meta-model:
Accuracy scores obtained from machine learning base models were used as a proxy for “learned, predictive
information content” to determine coronavirus pathogenicity (COPA) scores using a statistical hypothesis
test-based meta-model. First, Shannon entropy values were calculated for each window across the
alignment. Windows with minimal entropy values (n = 10,383), typically found in highly gapped regions,
were used to define a biologically meaningful control group; i.e., we hypothesized that windows with low
information content in highly gapped regions should not be predictive of coronavirus pathogenicity. For
each position across the alignment (100,840 positions), scores associated with windows that overlap with
the position (typically ~six windows) were pooled and tested to see if statistically significantly different
from the minimal entropy control group using the nonparametric two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. This
procedure was performed across the alignment, and p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using
the Benjamini & Hochberg procedure. P-values were transformed to nucleotide resolution coronavirus
pathogenicity scores by negative log base 10 (also referred to as NT-COPA scores). Amino acid resolution
scores were obtained by averaging the NT-COPA scores for a given residue’s codon (referred to simply as
COPA scores).
Kernel regression smoothing for hotspot peak identification:
For a systematic strategy to identify pathogenicity hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome using COPA
scores, we combined kernel regression smoothing with local maxima identification. For each position across
the alignment, we determined the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimate using the ksmooth function
in R with a “normal” kernel and various bandwidth sizes. Peaks highlighted in this study are primarily based
on estimates calculated with bandwidth size of 3. Local peaks were determined from kernel regression
estimates using the “findpeaks” function with nups parameter set at 2, from the “pracma” R package.

Evolutionary analyses:
Protein sequences used for evolutionary analyses were aligned using MAFFT version 7 with the “L-INS-i”
strategy

30

. Alignments were visualized using Jalview 2.11.1.0

35

. Phylogenic analyses were performed

using MEGA10.1.8 software 36. Phylogeny trees were generated with the Maximum Likelihood statistical
method, Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model, uniform rates among sites, use of all sites,
Nearest-Neighbor-Interchange (NNI) heuristic method, and default NJ/BioNJ initial tree. For spike protein
analysis, all obtained sequences were used for alignment and phylogeny. For NSP12 analysis, all obtained
ORF1ab sequences and reference SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 (YP_009725307) were used for alignment, but only
ORF1ab sequences were used for phylogeny.
Structural analyses:
The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2 was obtained from
Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession code 6M0J 10. The cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP12NSP7-NSP8 complex bound to the template-primer RNA and the triphosphate form of remdesivir (RTP)
was obtained from PDB with accession code 7BV2

16

. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV spike RBD

bound with ACE2 was obtained from PDB with accession code 2AJF 14. Molecular graphics and analyses
including mapping of COPA scores onto structures were performed with UCSF ChimeraX version 0.94 37.
B cell epitope analysis:
FASTA sequences for reference SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins were used to predict B cell epitopes.
Linear B-cell epitopes probability scores were obtained using BepiPred-2.0 38. “Consensus Regions” were
defined as amino acid residues with epitope scores > 0.5 and COPA scores > 8. Hypergeometric test of
overlap of high COPA score (> 8) and high epitope score (> 0.5) residues was performed to determine the
statistical significance of consensus regions. “Compound Regions” were identified using k-means
clustering. Briefly, the R function “kmeans” was run with variable number of clusters and nstart parameter
25 on a dataset containing residue position, epitope score, and COPA score. Residues were marked as
compound regions if they belonged to clusters with epitope score centers > 0.5 and COPA score centers >
8. Flagged residues that did not belong to a contiguous run of amino acids ≥ 5 residues were filtered out.
T cell epitope analysis:
FASTA sequences for reference SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and select nonstructural proteins were
used to predict T cell epitopes. Prediction of peptides binding to MHC class I and class II molecules was

then performed using TepiTool 39 from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) Analysis Resource. MHC-I
binder predictions were made for the “Human” host species and the 27 most frequent A & B alleles in the
global population. Default settings for low number of peptides (only 9mer peptides), IEDB recommended
prediction method, and predicted percentile rank cutoff ≤ 1.0 were used for peptide selection. MHC-II
binder predictions were made for the “Human” host species using the “7-allele method” (median of
percentile ranks from DRB1*03:01, DRB1*07:01, DRB1*15:01, DRB3*01:01, DRB3*02:02,
DRB4*01:01, DRB5*01:01). Median consensus percentile rank ≤ 20.0 was used for peptide selection.
Pathogenicity associated peaks within the proteins with NT-COPA scores greater than 8 were then mapped
to the predicted peptides for prioritization.
