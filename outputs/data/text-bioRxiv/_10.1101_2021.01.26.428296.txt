Abstract

10

The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third

11

virus within the Orthocoronavirinae causing an emergent infectious disease in humans, the

12

ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19). Due to the high zoonotic

13

potential of these viruses, it is critical to unravel their evolutionary history of host species

14

shift, adaptation and emergence. Only such knowledge can guide virus discovery,

15

surveillance and research efforts to identify viruses posing a pandemic risk in humans. We

16

present a comprehensive analysis of the composition and codon usage bias of the 82

17

Orthocoronavirinae members, infecting 47 different avian and mammalian hosts. Our

18

results clearly establish that synonymous codon usage varies widely among viruses and is

19

only weakly dependent on the type of host they infect. Instead, we identify mutational bias

20

towards AT-enrichment and selection against CpG dinucleotides as the main factors

21

responsible of the codon usage bias variation. Further insight on the mutational equilibrium

22

within Orthocoronavirinae revealed that most coronavirus genomes are close to their

23

neutral equilibrium, the exception is the three recently-infecting human coronaviruses,

24

which lie further away from the mutational equilibrium than their endemic human

25

coronavirus counterparts. Finally, our results suggest that while replicating in humans

26

SARS-CoV-2 is slowly becoming AT-richer, likely until attaining a new mutational

27

equilibrium.

Introduction

30

The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause

31

of respiratory disease COVID-19, occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress

32

syndrome and eventually death (Zhu et al. 2020). With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and

33

with the presence of asymptomatic carriers, the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a public

34

health emergency of international concern. Before the 2019 zoonotic spillover, SARS-CoV-

35

2 had circulated unnoticed for decades in bats as well as in other intermediate hosts,

36

notably the Sunda pangolin Manis javanica (Boni et al. 2020). Cross-species

37

transmissions are common among coronaviruses (CoVs), as all human infecting-CoVs

38

(hCoVs) arose through zoonotic events, mostly from bats or rodents, with occasionally

39

domestic animals playing the role of intermediate hosts (Cui et al. 2019). Consequently,

40

given the high zoonotic potential of the Orthocoronavirinae (Olival et al. 2017; Dhama et al.

41

2020) and the vast repertoire of mammalian and avian hosts they infect, there is a need to

42

evaluate the potential zoonotic risk for each individual CoV. This knowledge will guide

43

virus discovery, surveillance and research to identify for each virus the differential risk to

44

efficiently infect humans and cause a new pandemic.

45

Due to their highly compact genomes, none of the viruses infecting vertebrates

46

encodes for any tRNA nor for any ribosomal protein, and CoVs are no exception. As a

47

result, the translation of viral proteins relies exclusively on the host tRNA repertoire and

48

translational machinery (Albers and Czech 2016). In order to efficiently support the

49

production of viral proteins, it has been proposed that viruses should use the set of

50

synonymous codons found overrepresented in their hosts, as the result of an adaptation to

51

their host cellular environment (Franzo et al. 2017; Simón et al. 2017; Rahman et al. 2018;

52

Tian et al. 2018). Such hypothesis is based on the fascinating discovery that codon usage

53

is subject to natural selection (Ikemura 1985a; Kanaya et al. 2001; Drummond and Wilke

54

2008; Hershberg and Petrov 2008; dos Reis and Wernisch 2009). This adaptive

55

hypothesis called translational selection proposes that the non-random usage of

56

synonymous codons and the abundance of tRNAs have co-evolved to optimize translation

57

efficiency. Experimental analyses have been successful to characterize how synonymous

58

substitutions influence the cellular fitness of an organism, by acting on a broad range of

59

cellular processes, including changes on transcription (Zhou et al. 2016), translation

60

initiation (Kudla et al. 2009; Goodman et al. 2013), translation elongation (Sørensen et al.

61

1989), translation accuracy (Akashi 1994; Drummond and Wilke 2008), RNA stability

62

(Presnyak et al. 2015), and splicing (Pagani et al. 2005).

63

Numerous works conducted essentially in certain phages and their bacterial hosts

64

have reported a strong match between the codon usage bias (CUB) of viral genes with

65

respect to their hosts (Lucks et al. 2008; Bahir et al. 2009; Wong et al. 2010). Similarly, the

66

CUB of human papillomaviruses has been associated to differential clinical presentations

67

of the infections (Félez-Sánchez et al. 2015), with a stronger virus-host match in CUB for

68

human papillomaviruses causing productive lesions than those causing asymptomatic

69

infections. However, such a trend has not been observed for SARS-CoV-2: most of the

70

highly frequent codons in SARS-CoV-2 are A- and U-ending codons (Gu et al. 2020; Tort

71

et al. 2020) overall showing a poor match with the average human CUB (Gong et al.

72

2020). Such mismatch has raised important questions on the nature of the CUB in CoVs,

73

the underlying mechanisms involved, and the impact on virus longer-term evolution.

74

Further, investigating the CUB match between viral and cellular genes constitutes a

75

challenge to support the use of synonymous mutations as biotechnological tools to

76

develop live attenuated vaccines (Lauring et al. 2010).

77

Besides been driven by constraints on tRNA abundance, CUB in viruses is also

78

shaped by dinucleotide abundance. It has been long established that many RNA viruses

79

infecting mammals have evolved CpG and UpA deficiency (Yap et al. 2003; Greenbaum et

80

al. 2008; Atkinson et al. 2014; Takata et al. 2017). In the mammalian RNA Echovirus 7, it

81

has been formally demonstrated that the severe attenuation of the virus replication is

82

attributed to the increase of CpG and UpA dinucleotides frequencies rather to the use of

83

rare codons (Tulloch et al. 2014). Viruses with high CpG/UpA frequencies may be more

84

likely to be recognized by pathogen innate immune sensors, preventing them from

85

replication initiation (Kumagai et al. 2008). Functionally, the inhibition of viral replication

86

and the degradation of the viral genome have been attributed to the zinc finger antiviral

87

protein (ZAP), a powerful restriction factor that specifically binds to CpG and UpA motifs

88

(Odon et al. 2019). It is hence critical when investigating CUB to disentangle confounding

89

effects of CUB and dinucleotide abundance.

90

Finally, non-adaptive evolutionary forces can also affect the viral genome

91

composition. Because fitness differences associated to individual codons are very small, it

92

requires very large population sizes (e.g. highly productive and highly prevalent viral

93

infections) for natural selection to act and lead to a significant impact on the global

94

genomic CUB. Such trend is verified in large organisms with small population sizes, such

95

as most mammals, where natural selection on CUB is weak (Duret 2002; Chamary et al.

96

2006) and CUB is instead primarily shaped by mutational biases (Lynch 2010) and GC-

97

biased gene conversion (Duret and Galtier 2009). Mutations are the fundamental substrate

98

for genotypic diversity, leading to phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection can

99

act. Point mutations are stochastic processes but they concur with certain deterministic

100

and directional biases: in bacteria (Hershberg and Petrov 2010) as well as in eukaryotes

101

(Petrov and Hartl 1999; Haddrill and Charlesworth 2008; Denver et al. 2009; Ossowski et

102

al. 2010), previous studies suggest that mutations occurring during genome replication are

103

universally biased towards AT. Similarly, for SARS-CoV-2, analysis of mutational profiles

104

indicates a strong mutation bias towards U (Rice et al. 2020; Simmonds 2020), however

105

the impact of such bias on CUB variation has not been characterized yet at the scale of

106

the whole Orthocoronavirinae.

107

Given the impact of the match between virus and host CUB in viral gene

108

expression, the key challenge is to determine whether a specific genome composition or

109

CUB could facilitate (or hamper) the initial zoonotic spillover from animals towards humans

110

and to eventually govern the risks of stable human-to-human transmission. Here we

111

investigated the CUB variability in Orthocoronavirinae, with an emphasis on CoVs infecting

112

humans. We aimed at determining whether CUB in CoVs is actively selected according to

113

the codon preferences of their hosts or if it reflects the action of other evolutionary forces.

114

We show that variation in CUB in Orthocoronavirinae mainly results from differences in

115

GC3-content and in CpG and UpA abundance, independently of the host infected.

116

Variation in GC3-content is primarily dictated by mutation biased towards AT, a trend

117

universally observed in all Coronavirinae genera, regardless of the host. Finally, selection

118

against CpG and UpA dinucleotides strongly impacts the CUB of CoVs. Altogether, we

119

conclude that variation in CUB plays a little role, if any, on the probability of the

120

establishment of a zoonotic spillover towards humans.

Results

123

Variation in codon usage bias among Orthocoronavirinae

124

To better understand the causes of CUB differences between CoVs, we

125

investigated a total of 82 distinct CoVs. Our sample spans viral and host taxonomical

126

diversity, covering the four viral genera within Orthocoronavirinae, and embracing a total of

127

47 different vertebrate host species within nine mammalian and five avian orders

128

(Supplementary Table 1). First, we explored the variation in the 59 synonymous codons

129

frequencies through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Figure 1A and Supplementary

130

Figure 1A). The PCA efficiently reduced information dimensionality as the first two

131

components capture respectively 34.9% and 20.1% of the variance, and the first four

132

dimensions contribute with above 70% of explanatory power. Interestingly, the 82 CoVs

133

were distributed scattered along the two first PCA axes without any obvious stratification

134

as a function neither of the viral taxonomy nor the host infected. This result contradicts our

135

initial hypothesis of a host-specific CUB signature in CoVs and suggests that translational

136

selection for convergence towards the host’s CUB is presumably weak.

137

The PCA results contribute further with information about the spreading of the

138

individual codons as well as their contribution to the total variance (Supplementary Figure

139

1B). The first PCA axis sharply splits the codons depending on their nucleotide in the third

140

codon position (often referred to as GC3), at the exception of UUG-Leu codon, which

141

stands alone among all other A- or T-ending codons. Strikingly, we found that variation in

142

genomic GC3 content perfectly correlated with variation on the first PCA axis (R2

143

adjust=0.94, pvalue<1e-50, Figure 1B). Note that variation in GC3 did not show any

144

correlation with any other of the main PCA axes (Supplementary Figure 2). In-depth

145

analysis of the frequency patterns for the 18 synonymous codons families showed that A-

146

or-U ending codons are systematically preferred over the G-or-C ending ones (Figure 1C).

147

Such trend was especially true for amino acids with multiplicity-two, but also confirmed for

6

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428296; this version posted January 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this

148

amino acids with multiplicity four: U-ending codons were systematically the most used

149

among the four codons, while A-ending codons were always preferred over the G-ending

150

one. For amino acids with multiplicity six, the overall scheme corresponds to the combined

151

patterns of a family of multiplicity four and a family of multiplicity two. Altogether, our

152

observations show that variation in GC3 is the main explanatory factor for variation CUB

153

between CoVs, with CoVs genomes being universally enriched in AT-ending over GC-

154

ending synonymous codons.

155

We aimed at quantifying further the proportion of the global variability in CUB that is

156

explained by the host and by the virus taxonomic stratification. Through a correspondence

157

analysis, we associated the 82 different viruses of our codon usage table into blocks

158

corresponding to the 13 host taxonomic orders, allowing us to split the total variability into

159

between-category and within-category variability. The top ten eigenvalues of such

160

decomposition are represented in Figure 1D showing that within-host differences in CUB

161

explain four times more of the overall variability than differences between-hosts

162

(respectively 80.3% vs 19.7%), the explanatory power of both levels being larger than the

163

randomly expected one from a homogeneous distribution (7.59%, pvalue < 9e-4). A similar

164

analysis was reproduced associating the viruses into blocks corresponding to the four viral

165

genera within Coronavirinae. We observed that within-genus differences in CUB explain

166

over five times more of the overall variability than between-genera differences

167

(respectively 85.6% vs 14.4%), %), the explanatory power of both levels being again larger

168

than the randomly expected one from a homogeneous distribution (3.72%, pvalue < 9e-4).

169

Together, our results are consistent with our initial PCA analysis, and suggest that both

170

host and virus taxonomy variables are not the main factors that drive variation in CUB

171

within Orthocoronavirinae.

172

The mutational spectrum in Orthocoronavirinae is AU-biased

173

Since variation in GC3 content is the main individual driver of the variation in CUB

174

between CoVs, we investigated next whether mutational biases are the underlying main

175

force driving nucleotide content. Population genetics studies show that in order to explore

176

mutational biases independently of the effect of natural selection, one should work at

177

shallow, short-term evolutionary periods, where natural selection is less powerful to impact

178

nucleotide polymorphism patterns (Hershberg and Petrov 2010). Consequently, we

179

estimated the frequencies of individual transition and transversions by narrowing down our

180

analysis to a subset of 18 different CoV metapopulations. From the public databases (see

181

Methods), we downloaded a total of 12,102 different viral genome entries to construct

182

these 18 different metapopulations (Supplementary Table 2). Prior to the identification of

183

SNPs for each metapopulation, we carefully preprocessed each dataset by removing

184

putative recombinant sequences (see Methods, Supplementary Figure 3A), as those

185

recombinant sequences violate the assumptions for the phylogenetic inference methods

186

used downstream. For each viral metapopulation we removed further the effect of

187

population structure by phylogeny-driven selection of one single homogeneous population

188

per viral species (Supplementary Figure 3B). Our final dataset was composed of a total of

189

10,373 viral genomes for the 18 metapopulations (median number of genomes per

190

metapopulation 31; range 9-9,588), for which a total of 57,059 SNPs were called (median

191

number of SNPs called per metapopulation 3,037; range 253-7,778; Supplementary Table

192

2). Despite the heterogeneous sampling size across our metapopulations, the number of

193

SNPs called was highly comparable, the exceptions being SARS-CoV-1 sequences from

194

humans and MERS sequences from humans and from camels, which exhibited a low

195

number of sequence polymorphisms, albeit large enough to grant sound analyses

196

(respectively 716, 621 and 253).

197

Under a maximum likelihood framework, we separately estimated for the

198

synonymous and non-synonymous compartments the frequencies of transitions and

199

transversions using the generalized time-reversible model for the phylogenetic

200

reconstruction fitting best the genomic data. Such analysis allows us to estimate the

201

frequencies of individual transitions and transversions after correcting for nucleotide

202

composition in each compartment. Our results show that for the synonymous substitutions

203

compartment and for all viral metapopulations studied, U<>C transitions were more

204

frequent than A<>G transitions, and U->C transitions were more frequent than the reverse

205

C->U (Figure 2A). These remarkable differences were of a larger magnitude for

206

substitutions occurring within the synonymous compartment than within non-synonymous

207

compartment, where the C->U changes were only slightly more common than the reverse

208

substitution. Consistent with these findings, stratification of substitutions into GC-enriching

209

(i.e. AU->GC) or AU-enriching (i.e. GC->AU) categories shows that for all metapopulations

210

AU-enriching substitutions occur at much higher rate than GC-enriching ones in both

211

synonymous and nonsynonymous compartments (respectively mean fold change=2.49, p-

212

value<7.6e-6; and mean fold change=1.38, p-value<7.6e-6; paired Wilcoxon signed rank

213

test; Figure 2B).

214

Finally, we tested whether for each viral metapopulation the nucleotide content is at

215

equilibrium in each compartment, by contrasting the observed GC content against the

216

expected GC one if the metapopulation lay at its inferred mutational equilibrium (GCeq)

217

(Figure 2C). We state first the very good correlation between observed and expected GC

218

composition in both synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs (respectively R2 adjusted =

219

0.93 and 0.86; p-values < 2e-10 and 4e-8). Notably, CoVs infecting the same host displayed

220

important differences in GC3% in the synonymous compartment, in the case of hCoVs

221

ranging from 18.7% (HKU1) to 30.6% (229E). Such variation indicates again that the host

222

is not the main factor governing the strength of the mutational bias. Altogether our results

223

suggest that the mutational spectrum in CoVs is biased towards AU-enrichment and that

224

the nucleotide content of the viral genomes is primarily determined by mutational biases.

225
226

Recent human-infecting coronavirus display greater mutational disequilibrium than

227

endemic hCoVs

228

Humans are the host to endemic CoVs, responsible for common respiratory

229

diseases, but it has been proposed that these endemic hCoVs have an ancient zoonotic

230

origin. Molecular dating studies have tried to evaluate the timing for host shift events for

231

endemic hCoVs, estimating an old emergence of several hundreds of years ago for NL63

232

and a more recent one in the 19th-20th century for 229E, OC42 and HKU1 (Vijgen et al.

233

2005; Pfefferle et al. 2009; Huynh et al. 2012; Al-Khannaq et al. 2016). This

234

epidemiological stratification among hCoVs, differentiating ancient zoonosis that became

235

endemic in humans and recently zoonotic hCoVs provided us with the unique opportunity

236

to characterize the impact that spillover and subsequent establishment in the new host has

237

on the mutational equilibrium of the virus genomes. Previous works have demonstrated

238

that a high-resolution estimation of the mutational equilibrium can be gained from the

239

simple property of the folded site frequency spectrum (SFS) of AT-to-GC mutations, in

240

which SNPs are not polarized (Glémin et al. 2015). The theory proposes that for

241

populations at demographic equilibrium the GC-content converges towards the mutational

242

equilibrium, yielding a perfect U-shape in the AT-GC allele frequency distribution, resulting

243

in a symmetrically folded SFS. Deviations from the U-shape distribution would thus reflect

244

that the genomic GC-content is not at its mutational equilibrium, a negative (or positive)

245

skewness indicating respectively higher (or lower) GC-content than expected under the

246

mutational equilibrium. We have applied this framework, computed the folded SFS for the

247

seven hCoVs lineages (Figure 3A) and quantified the deviation from the expected U-shape

248

distribution by calculating the skewness of each folded SFS as a proxy for the departure of

10

249

the GC-content from the expected mutational equilibrium (Figure 3B). Our results show

250

that for all four endemic hCoVs the observed skewness was not different from the null

251

expectation, while for the three recently emerged hCoVs (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and

252

SARS-CoV-2) we observed a significant depart from the expected GC content at

253

equilibrium. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 displayed a negative skewness, meaning

254

that their genomes were slightly GC-richer than the anticipated mutational equilibrium,

255

while SARS-CoV-1 displayed a positive skewness, reflecting an AT-richer genomic content

256

than expected for the mutational equilibrium. Finally, benefiting from the wealth of

257

sequence data generated on SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the dynamics of the GC-

258

content over the spread of the COVID19 pandemic (Figure 3C). We observed that the GC-

259

content of SARS-CoV-2 is very slowly albeit significantly decreasing with the progression

260

of the pandemic (Figure 3C, R=-0.11, pvalue<1e-49). This result of a trend towards an

261

overall AT-enrichment is consistent with the SFS observation of a viral genome far from

262

compositional equilibrium and suggests that during the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 in

263

humans, the virus population is experiencing a GC->AT mutational bias resulting in a slow

264

decrease of the GC genomic content compared to the viral genomes retrieved from

265

humans at the origin of the pandemic.

266

CpG dinucleotides are selected against in Orthocoronavirinae genomes

267

Our initial characterization demonstrated that variation in GC3 content is the

268

prevailing force shaping CUB among CoVs, explain one-third of the total variation in CUB.

269

We have thus tried to identify other evolutionary forces further shaping CUB in CoVs.

270

Previous works have identified that in several RNA viruses infecting humans certain

271

dinucleotides are under-represented, notably CpG and UpA, and that this low dinucleotide

272

frequency has a strong impact on codon-pair bias (Kunec and Osterrieder 2016). We

273

investigated thus the ratio of the observed over the expected dinucleotide frequency in the

274

CoVs coding sequences. Figure 4A shows that the observed/expected abundance of the

11

275

CpG dinucleotide in all CoVs lineages is significantly lower than the null expectation based

276

on the individual nucleotide frequency, while this is not the case for the UpA dinucleotide.

277

To a lesser extent, we identify CpA and UpG to be marginally more frequent than

278

expected, which can be linked to the strong decrease in CpG, as they correspond

279

respectively to the transitions CpG->CpA and CpG->UpG. We further state that the

280

observed/expected ratios for CpG and UpA correlated well with the second and third

281

dimension of our PCA analysis, respectively (R2 adjusted = 0.67 and 0.44; Figure 4B and

C). It is important to remind that these dinucleotide frequency values have been estimated

283

for the complete viral coding sequence but are not limited to the codons themselves, i.e.

284

we have also considered the presence of CpG and UpA dinucleotides in the codon

285

boundary context, so that this impact is not simply related to higher frequency of CG-rich

286

or AT-rich codons. This specific point will be addressed below. Overall, our results show

287

that variation in CUB between CoVs is associated with variation in CpG and UpA

288

dinucleotide content.

289

Next, in order to formally demonstrate the impact that CpG and UpA dinucleotide

290

frequency have on CUB, we compared the synonymous codon frequencies among codon

291

families either containing or lacking a CpG- or UpA-ending codon. Having previously

292

established that mutational bias modulates frequencies among synonymous codons, we

293

accounted for this confounding effect by calculating an expected ratio in synonymous

294

codon frequencies for codon pairs in the form of XXA/XXG. To this end we defined as our

295

reference set for comparison the three codon families with multiplicity-two lacking CpG and

296

UpA dinucleotides and ending by either A or G (i.e. Gln -CAA/G-, Lys -AA/G- and Glu -

297

GAA/G-, indicated as “XXpA/XXpG” in Figure 4D). For this reference set, we calculated an

298

overall fold change XXA/XXG ratio of 1.26, consistent with the AT-enriching mutational

299

bias described above. For amino acids encoded by CpG-ending codons (Ser4, Pro, Thr,

300

Ala, indicated as “XCpA/XCpG” in Figure 4D), we observed a 5.33-fold change XCA/XCG

301

ratio, significantly higher than the corresponding one for the reference amino acids set

302

(within-genome paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, p-value<1e-14). Such difference indicates

303

that regardless of the amino acid encoded, CpA-ending codons are systematically

304

preferred over their CpG-ending synonymous counterparts, at higher proportion than

305

expected under the pressure of A->G mutational bias alone. In the case of UpA-ending

306

codons (Leu2, Leu4, Val), we observed an overall XXA/XXG ratio of 1.04, slightly but

307

statistically significantly lower than the corresponding one for the reference amino acid set

308

(within-genome paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, p-value <1e-6). We interpret thus that

309

although the UpA-dinucleotide is not significantly depleted in CoV genomes, UpA-ending

310

codons are less frequent than their synonymous UpG counterparts. Consequently, the

311

genomic UpA dinucleotide-content is shaped by two antagonistic evolutionary forces: on

312

the one hand a mutational bias promoting the overall excess of G->A transitions and on

313

the other hand a selection for XUpA->XUpG transitions in synonymous codons. Indeed,

314

this interpretation supports again the finding of the UpG dinucleotide as being borderline

315

significantly more frequent than expected, as it also corresponds to the transition UpA-

316

>UpG.

317

Finally, we aimed at characterizing the impact that the pressure against CpG and

318

UpA dinucleotides imposes on CUB, when these dinucleotides are located at the codon

319

pair boundary, such as XXC-GXX or XXU-AXX. We thus computed the frequency ratio

320

XXU/XXC for synonymous codons depending on the nature on the downstream first

321

nucleotide: if a selection again CpG nucleotides existed, we would expect the XXU/XXC

322

ratio to be higher when the downstream codon starts with G; similarly, if a selection

323

against UpA dinucleotides existed, the XXU/XXC ratio should be lower when the

324

downstream codon starts with A. Our results confirmed indeed the depletion for CpG, as

325

we observe a significantly higher XXU/XXC ratio upstream a codon starting by a G

326

compared to codon starting with any other base (Figure 4E), avoiding the creation of CpG

327

at the overlap between two codons. Regarding the hypothesis of UpA depletion, the

328

median XXU/XXC ratio upstream a codon starting by A was the lowest of all bases, albeit

329

with a large variance and not different from the values for codons starting by C or U. This

330

result mitigates our previous finding of a slight intra-codon avoidance of the UpA

331

dinucleotide, but is concordant with the overall absence of significant avoidance of UpA

332

within the coding sequence.

333

Mutational bias and CpG/UpA depletion explain most of the variation in synonymous

334

codon usage of Coronaviruses

335

Having identified GC->AT mutational bias as well as CpG and possibly UpA

336

dinucleotide depletion as variables impacting CUB in Coronavirinae, we have aimed at

337

further quantifying the differential contributions of each of these factors on the overall CUB

338

variation. We therefore built a linear model quantifying the relative contribution of the

339

different variables (GC3, CpG, UpA, host taxonomy at the level of order, and virus

340

taxonomy at the level of genus) and their corresponding interactions that covary with the

341

projections of the first four main dimensions of the PCA for CUB. The analysis of variance

342

demonstrated that variation in GC3, CpG and UpA are respectively the best predictors of

343

the first three dimensions of the PCA (Figure 5), respectively explaining 94%, 67% and

344

56% of the variation of each dimension. By contrast, the integration of the host and virus

345

taxonomy stratification levels and their interactions with the compositional variables did not

346

contribute with any further improvement of the model fit to the data. Lastly, the fourth PC

347

dimension was only marginally explained by UpA content and by the UpA*viral taxonomy

348

interaction, which explained 19.3% and 18.2% of the PC4 dimension, respectively. Given

349

these results and considering the power of each PCA axis for explaining variation in CUB,

350

we conclude that variation in GC3 explains around 34%, variation in CpG frequency

351

explains around 14%, and variation in UpA frequency explains around 7% of the total

Discussion

356

With the COVID19 pandemic, the unprecedented wealth of sequence data

357

generated on human SARS-CoV-2 virus and the close relatives infecting pangolin and

358

bats provides with a unique opportunity to investigate the variability and the biological role

359

of synonymous codon usage among Orthocoronavirinae. Previous works in the field have

360

been successful at inventorying CUB in SARS-CoV-2 (Dilucca et al. 2020; Gu et al. 2020;

361

Tort et al. 2020), as well as at reporting the poor match in the observed CUB between

362

SARS-CoV-2 and humans (Ji et al. 2020). Together those studies raised important

363

questions on the nature of the CUB in CoVs, the underlying evolutionary mechanism

364

involved, and their impact on the virus longer-term evolution. Here we explored those

365

questions, by meticulously disentangling the effects that natural selection, dinucleotide

366

avoidance and neutral forces have on the variability in CUB in CoVs.

367
368

Mutational bias and CpG avoidance shape codon usage bias in CoVs.

369

We report a strong heterogeneity in CUB among CoVs mainly driven by a GC->AT

370

biased mutations. During analyses restricted to the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, previous

371

studies had identified C->U deamination as the main mutational contributor to

372

spontaneous mutation (Rice et al. 2020; Simmonds 2020). Our work conducted on the

373

largest diversity of CoVs investigated so far is a novel compelling piece of evidence

374

demonstrating that mutational bias toward AT is a universal feature among CoVs,

375

regardless of the viral taxonomy and of the host infected. We further report that for all

376

CoVs, C->U substitutions occur at a much higher frequency than G->A substitutions. Such

377

asymmetric substitution pattern has been proposed to be driven by a host APOBEC3-like

378

editing process, rather than occurring during virus replication and being associated to

379

mutational biases of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Di Giorgio et al.

380

2020; Simmonds 2020). The APOBEC3 locus in mammals consists of a series of tandem

16

381

copies of different APOBEC3 genes that have undergone a complex evolutionary history

382

of duplications, deletions and fusions, further complicated at the transcriptome level with a

383

large diversity of mRNA (Münk et al. 2012). The evolution of the APOBEC3 locus is tightly

384

linked to the viral infections via different arms race (Harris and Anderson 2016; Ito et al.

385

2020). The structure and synteny in the locus and the repertoire of APOBEC3 proteins

386

encoded by one genome are thus extremely lineage-specific: see for instance (Hayward et

387

al. 2018; Jebb et al. 2020) for Chiroptera or (Garcia and Emerman 2018; Yang et al. 2020)

388

for Primates. It is thus important to note that the mutagenic role of host APOBEC3

389

enzymes acting onto viral genomes and exerting strong evolutionary pressures in a

390

particular virus-host interaction may fuel viral adaptations, which facilitate viral

391

transmission and colonisation of novel host species, as suggested for lentiviruses infecting

392

Primates (Nakano et al. 2020).

393

In addition to the increased GC->AT substitutions, we remark that CoVs genomes

394

are strongly depleted in the CpG dinucleotide, resulting in the avoidance of synonymous

395

codons and of codon pairs containing this motif. Our results are consistent with previous

396

works demonstrating that the experimental increase of CpG frequencies impaired virus

397

fitness (Lauring et al. 2012; Tulloch et al. 2014; Moratorio et al. 2017). CpG depletion has

398

been observed across CoVs infecting a whole range of mammals and birds, indicating that

399

the attenuation mechanism might be fundamental to vertebrate eukaryotic antiviral

400

defense, evolutionarily conserved and active over three hundreds of millions of years of

401

evolution (Ibrahim et al. 2019). Surprisingly, we did not observe any statistically significant

402

depletion of the UpA dinucleotide in CoV genomes (Figure 4A), while underrepresentation

403

of UpA is a common trend among human RNA virus (Simmonds et al. 2013; Kunec and

404

Osterrieder 2016). Analogous to the host immune response to the presence of CpG in the

405

viral genomes, the increased presence of UpA dinucleotides has been formally identified

406

as preventing virus replication (Fros et al. 2017), potentially through the cleavage of viral

407

RNAs by RNase L (Cooper et al. 2015). Our investigation of the impact of UpA dinucleotide

408

on the synonymous codon frequency displayed mitigated results: avoidance of UpA

409

dinucleotide was observed when the UpA dinucleotide is located at the end of a codon

410

(Figure 4D) but not when the UpA dinucleotide is located at the codon pair boundary

411

(Figure 4E). Hence, we hypothesize that UpA sites in CoVs are at the center of the

412

antagonist effects of mutation bias (promoting the formation of new UpA sites through GC-

413

>AT mutational bias) and selection (directly acting against UpA sites). However, testing

414

such mutation-selection trade-off hypothesis goes beyond the power of our bioinformatics

415

analyses and should be properly addressed by actually modifying the UpA content of CoV

416

genomes, quantifying changes in viral fitness and following the evolutionary trajectories of

417

the modified genomes by means of experimental evolution. Altogether, our work fits well

418

with the mounting evidence supporting the biotechnological application of modifications in

419

CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies in viral genomes for the production of efficient,

420

safe and evolution-proof vaccines (Martínez et al. 2016; Stauft et al. 2019; Konopka-

421

Anstadt et al. 2020).

422

Lack of evidence for translational selection acting on CoVs

423

Mismatches between the mRNA characteristics and the translation machinery can

424

have a strong impact on the quality and quantity of protein production. Selection acting on

425

mutations leading to streamlined translation is known as translational selection. However,

426

studies on the distribution of fitness effect show that the selective advantage associated to

427

beneficial individual synonymous mutations is very low (Sanjuán et al. 2004; Peris et al.

428

2010; Jacquier et al. 2013; Fragata et al. 2018; Williams et al. 2020), implying that

429

translational selection could only be efficient in the case of organisms with large effective

430

population sizes. Indeed, strong phenotypic effects of codon usage on expression levels of

431

single genes have been experimentally reported in some metazoan species with large

432

population sizes (such drosophila or nematode) (Chamary et al. 2006; Plotkin and Kudla

18

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428296; this version posted January 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this

433

2011). Similarly, studies in vertebrates have established that translational selection is

434

much weaker in large-sized vertebrates compared to small-sized, because there are slow

435

growing organism with a small effective population size (Galtier et al. 2018). Additionally,

436

the physicochemical organization of vertebrate chromosomes may further hamper

437

translational selection from playing a strong role in vertebrates: chromosomes in

438

vertebrates are organized in long, consecutive regions enriched in AT or in GC

439

nucleotides, known as isochores (Caspersson et al. 1968), so that the factor with the

440

largest individual impact on CUB of vertebrate genes is its physical location along the

441

chromosome (Holmquist 1989).

442

Just like cellular genes, viral genes rely completely on the host cell apparatus for

443

translation. It has thus been proposed that selection could act to optimize the match

444

between the virus CUB and tRNA repertoire and abundance in its host, leading to

445

increased efficiency and accuracy of viral protein synthesis (Tian et al. 2018). In the case

446

of viruses, the large population sizes that many of them generate during productive

447

infections could allow translational selection to shape CUB. For bacteriophages, CUB has

448

been shown to match codon preferences in the bacterial host (Lucks et al. 2008), which in

449

their turn match the most abundant cognate tRNAs available in the cell (Rocha 2004). In

450

viruses infecting vertebrates, mounting experimental evidence suggests that modification

451

of viral codon usage leads to sharp changes in viral fitness, the necessary condition for

452

natural selection to act upon viral CUB (Martínez et al. 2016). However, the results here

453

presented show that host stratification explains only a minor fraction of the global

454

variability of CUB in CoVs, suggesting that for these viruses the variability of synonymous

455

codons is largely unrelated to the type of host infected. We conclude thus that,

456

translational selection based on a differential tRNA abundance as a function of the host is

457

not the main evolutionally driver of CUB in CoVs. Experimental results on ribosome

458

profiling for Murine coronavirus genes have reported that despite the poor match in CUB

19

459

between this virus and the mouse host, coronavirus mRNAs were translated with similar

460

efficiency than the host mRNAs (Irigoyen et al. 2016). Thus, the high frequency of U- and

461

A-ending synonymous codon in CoVs genomes, systematically departing from the CUB of

462

their host (Ji et al. 2020), would not negatively impact the synthesis of viral proteins.

463

In metazoans the interplay between the main factors shaping CUB, mutational

464

forces, GC-biased gene conversion and translational selection, have been finely analyzed

465

and interpreted as a function of effective population size (Ratnakumar et al. 2010; Galtier

466

et al. 2018). Notwithstanding, the same studies identify CUB trends, such as the

467

systematic preference of pyrimidines over purines at the third codon position for which we

468

still lack an interpretative framework (Galtier et al. 2018). In our analyses for CoVs, despite

469

the strong explanatory power of variation in nucleotide composition and CpG avoidance to

470

explain variation in CUB, over 40% of the overall variation in CUB still remains to be

471

explained. Given the impact of effective population size on the efficiency of translational

472

selection to shape CUB in metazoans, could translational selection contribute to explain

473

the proportion of the variation in CUB in CoVs that has not been attributed to any variable?

474

Here we report that the between-host variability of CUB in CoVs accounts for 19.7% of the

475

total variability in CUB, a fraction two times larger than the random expectation. Although

476

statistically significant, this contribution does not necessarily prove that differential

477

adaptation to the translational machinery of the different hosts is shaping CUB in CoVs.

478

Our analyses suggest instead that significant differences in GC3 and UpA occur between

479

CoVs infecting different hosts (Supplementary Figure 7 and 8), so that between-hosts

480

differences in CUB in CoVs could actually reflect again the impact of compositional

481

variation at shaping CUB. A proper answer to the question of the actual role of

482

translational selection in CoVs will require experimental work identifying differences in the

483

natural history of the infection (e.g. target tissue, productivity, clinical presentation) of

484

genetically close viruses upon host switch.

485

Composition of CoVs genomes tends to reach their mutational equilibria

486

In order to investigate mutational bias in CoVs and to disentangle it from the effect

487

of natural selection, we have analyzed mutations occurring during recent evolution in 18

488

viral metapopulations at different taxonomic host and viral levels. With this approach we

489

have aimed at comparing mutational biases and equilibria, while minimizing the impact of

490

natural selection. Notwithstanding, for all metapopulations the substitution rate in the

491

synonymous compartment was systematically higher than in the corresponding non-

492

synonymous compartment (Figure 2A-B). This result suggests that natural selection is still

493

able to prune deleterious mutations at shallow levels in CoVs. We hypothesize that such

494

an effect of natural selection may be linked to the viral life cycle allowing for within-host

495

competition between putatively generated variants, and/or to the presence of bottlenecks

496

or of differential variant success during within-host and during between-host transmission.

497

This verbal argument can obviously be addressed only through observational data,

498

quantifying the within-host viral diversity during the course of the infection, and its

499

connection with the observed between-host viral diversity, or through experimental data

500

using for instance mutation accumulation lines.

501

This metapopulation approach has allowed us also to address the extent to which

502

each of the 18 CoVs may have reached a mutational composition equilibrium. Our results

503

for all metapopulations show a very good correlation between the observed and the

504

expected GC3 contents at both the synonymous and non-synonymous compartments,

505

indicating that all CoVs were found at their GC-content equilibrium (Figure 2C). However,

506

when considering the more accurate folded site-frequency spectrum at the population

507

level, we observe that endemic hCoVs are closer to an equilibrium in the AT—GC allele

508

distribution than zoonotic, recently acquired hCoVs (Figure 3A-B). This suggests that

509

endemic hCoVs may have undergone a compositional drift towards a novel equilibrium

510

under the novel mutational pressures in the human hos upon host switch. Indeed, at the

511

short time scale that our analyses can explore for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in humans,

512

we verify a small albeit significant trend towards GC reduction (Figure 3C). Future work will

513

benefit from accessing a sufficient number of SARS-CoV-2 non-human strains collected

514

from different hosts (bats and pangolins in first instance, given the current knowledge) to

515

assess the population-level characteristics of the direction and intensity of mutational bias

516

in endemic host species. Additionally, endemic hCoVs exhibit a large variation in observed

517

synonymous GC3-content, ranging from 18.7% to 30.6%, which suggests that the strength

518

of the mutational bias causing C-to-U change is not similar among all hCoVs. We

519

hypothesize that such differences in mutational signature could be related to the

520

differences in the host mutator APOBEC3 repertoires, which vary between hosts, but also

521

between cell types within an organism, so that changes in the host tropism will have an

522

impact on the actual mutational intensity and direction that the viral genomes experience.

523

Conclusion: CUB is a poor proxy to predict zoonotic infection in CoVs.

524

SARS-CoV-2 is the third Coronavirinae zoonotic spillover, and the associated

525

COVID19 poses an unprecedented burden on human public health. Understanding the

526

drivers and facilitators of interspecies viral transmission in CoVs is a key public health and

527

fundamental research priority. Nucleotide composition and CUB are distinctive

528

characteristics of a viral, shaped by the global action of different pressures, including host

529

adaptation (Jenkins and Holmes 2003; Wong et al. 2010; Cristina et al. 2015). In the case

530

of SARS-CoV-2, the viral CUB is closer to that of humans than other hCoVs (Dilucca et al.

531

2020), which may have facilitated the establishment in humans following the zoonotic

532

transmission event. Here we have shown that the main drivers of CUB (low GC3 content,

533

strong CpG avoidance and slight UpA avoidance) are common to all CoVs, independently

534

of viral taxonomy and of the hosts they infect. We interpret that the role of CUB at

535

modifying the chances of a CoV zoonotic spillover to thrive in humans is negligible.

536

Notwithstanding, the available data suggest that upon colonization of humans endemic

hCoVs have experienced a compositional drift towards a novel compositional equilibrium

within the Orthocoronaviridae families from the Virus-Host database. Because the 212

545

virus entries present in the database are composed of a mixture of sequence classified at

546

different taxonomy levels, i.e. species (HKU1, HKU4, HKU5, …) or strains (HKU4-1,

547

HKU4-2, HKU4-3, …), we used CD-HIT (option –c 0.95 –n 5) to cluster together

548

sequences sharing over 95% of identify and selected from each group one single

549

representative strain.

550

For the intra-species diversity, we downloaded strains sequences from the Virus

551

Pathogen Resource database (VIRP). Sequences unusually long or short (>130% or

<70% of the median length of the reference sequence of a species) were filtered out. In

We concatenated the coding sequences of each CoV genome in order to compute

561

the total synonymous codon frequencies and GC-content. This analysis yielded a matrix of

562

82 (CoVs) x 59 (synonymous codons) which served as input for either our PCA analysis

563

(FactoMineR) and correspondence analysis (ade4). In parallel, we calculated the

564

dinucleotide observed/expected abundances in coding sequences by calculating the ratio

565

rXY = fXY/fXfY, where fXY denotes the observed frequency of the dinucleotide XY and

566

fXfY the product of the individual frequencies of the nucleotides X and Y in a sequence.

We used as significant lower and upper boundaries the thresholds of 0.78 and 1.25,

568

corresponding to p<0.001 for sufficiently long (>20kb) random sequences (Burge et al.

569

1992).

570

Sequence processing and SNP extraction

571

Prior to the SNP calling analysis, we identified and removed recombining sequence

572

from each dataset using fastGear (Mostowy et al. 2017). Short recombination segments

573

(<200 bp) identified by fastGear were not remove but those region were be mask in the

574

downstream analysis. Next, in order to work in a framework where population structure will

575

not interfere with our downstream analysis, for each species we generated a phylogenetic

576

tree root with an outgroup and selected monophyletic group having the most of sequence

577

for our downstream analysis. After those preprocessing sets, we finally performed using

578

mummer (Delcher et al. 2002), a genome-to-genome alignment on each virus species,

579

creating a pairwise alignment of each genome with a chosen reference, and performed a

580

SNP calling analysis. Finally, ML phylogenetic trees and substitution matrix were inferred

581

with RAXML (Stamatakis 2014), using the General Time Reversible (GTR) with an

582

ascertainment bias correction model.

Supplementary Figure 3: Representation of the steps we used to select strains for our
metapopulation analysis through the example of the avian coronavirus. (A) Representation of the
recent recombinations events happening within strains of the same metapopulation, inferred by
fastGear. Rows correspond to viral strains sequences, the columns to positions in the alignment, and
colors show the membership of each portion of sequences to lineage detected by fastGear.
Sequence colored in black on the left side represent sequence selected to generate the phylogenetic
tree. (B) Phylogenetic tree of the relationship among viral strains. The tree is rooted based on an
outgroup (grey) as indicated on Supplementary Table 2.

Supplementary Figure 7: Comparison of the CG3 content, CpG, and UpA dinucleotide relative
abundances across CoVs hosts. Variance analysis of normally distributed data was done using
ANOVA follow by a post doc Tukey test showing further individual pairwise differences. Non-normal
data were processed using Krustal-Wallis test follow by a rank Wilcoxon test with a Bonferroni
correction (code for p-value: * <0.05, ** <0.01, *** <0.001).
