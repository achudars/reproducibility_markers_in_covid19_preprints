ABSTRACT
The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic
pathogen that has rapidly mutated and become transmissible to humans. There is little existing
data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its
transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to
identify variants within the 3’UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide
genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The
research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human
SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary
structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of
bat/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its
escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes.
While this S2M sequence may not be omnipresent across all human SARS-CoV-2 models,
when present, its sequence is always highly conserved. It may be used as a potential target for
the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents.

Introduction
The emergence of new viral pathogens is a danger to public health (1). Three
emerging pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly
identified CoV (SARS-CoV-2), are zoonotic viruses, which utilize bats as their natural reservoir.
They are then transmitted through intermediate hosts, eventually infecting humans. The
pressure on host selection of SARS-CoV-2 in human models will have an effect on long term
conservation of mutations that enhance its transmissibility (2). However, the determinants
regulating strong trans-species evolution remain unknown due to challenges in recognizing viral
precursors and animal reservoirs (3). A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved
stem-loop II-like motif (S2M) has been reported in four groups of positive single stranded RNA
viruses; Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae (4).
The significance of S2M sequences in viral strains remains to be determined. However, it
appears to be important to viral transmissibility and will likely be found in future emergent
coronaviruses (5). Given that S2M is a highly conserved component of coronaviruses viral
genome and is absent from the human genome, it could become a potential target for antiviral
drug therapy (6). This study was performed in order to analyze coronavirus genomic sequences
isolated from human, bat, and pangolin models in order to identify variants within the structured
cis-regulatory RNA elements in the 3’UTR region, including the S2M loop.
2. Methods
2.1. Calculation of Allele Frequency and Occupancy
The SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients on a cruise ship in Japan (NCBI GenBank
Accession Number LC528232.1) was used as a reference genome. Identifying functional RNA
motifs and elements was performed using RegRNA 2.0 tools (filtered to human settings) (7).

The S2M motifs (43 nucleotides long) were aligned for bat/pangolin models (Fig. 1 (a)) and for
human models SARS-COVs (Fig. 1 (b)). A G to U amino acid transfer at position 32 and a G to
U/A amino acid transfer as position 16 (Fig. 1(b)) were found in human SARS-CoV-2. This profile
was used to search for all viral sequences in GenBank, while using different combinations of 32
G>U and 16 G>U/A nucleotide substitutions that occur in a conserved region within 3′ UTR,
known as the S2M motif.

2.2. Quantifying Similarities between Motifs and Structures
RNA sequences were aligned using 3´UTR (29,543–29,903), with queries in a BLASTn
search of the NCBI database for S2M motifs(8, 9). The 3` UTR stem-loop structures were
determined by using the RNAfold web server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/forna/). Additionally,
sequence and structural information of astrovirus S2M motifs was integrated for RNAfold design
to analyze a potential zoonotic precursor for coronaviruses from a hypothetical infectious
sequence (10). The PDB structure for S2M was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) (PDB ID: 1XJR) (6). All of the structures were visualized by PyMOL
(11) and analysis was performed as presented in previous studies (12, 13). RNAComposer was
used to model the three dimensional (3D) RNA structures (14, 15). Clustal Omega was used to
apply mBed algorithms for guide trees. ClustalW alignment tools were used to execute multiple
sequence alignments (16). The S2M RNA sequences were compared between members of the
coronavirus family (bat and pangolin CoVs, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2) as well as the
astrovirus family (avian, porcine, bovine, chicken, turkey, ovine, mink, tiger, human and
mamastrovirus). The S2M motifs were screened with miRBase tools in order to identify potential
miRNA binding sites (17).

2.3. Identification of Single Nucleotide Substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.280529; this version posted September 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. It is made
available under aCC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.

Only alignment positions which harbored defined A/T/G/C residues in 95% of their
genomes were considered for nucleotide substitutions (18). In order to be graphically
represented, sequence logos of the selected S2M motifs were then constructed using
WEBLOGO (19-21).
A nucleotide BLAST search of these sequence motifs was performed on the NCBI portal. S2M
containing sequences were identified for the following sequence:
5’-TTTCA

(G>U/A)CGAGGCCACGCGGAGTACGATCGAG(G>U)GTACAGTGAA(U>C)-3’.

This text string profile was used to search for all the viral sequences in GenBank available as
of August 14th, 2020, while using different combinations of the aforementioned nucleotide
substitutions. A phylogenetic tree was created by generating a genomic epidemiological map of
SARS-CoV-2 at position 29724 (S2M) using NextStrain tools (https://nextstrain.org/) (22). The
sequences of the different isolates were obtained from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (23).
3. Results
3.1. Calculation of Allele Frequency and Occupancy
Position 32 of S2M is a critical point of the sequence that is specific to the human
coronaviruses and variable for the bat/pangolin coronaviruses (Fig. 1 (a,c)). A second
polymorphism appears in human SARS-CoV-2 models at position 16 G>U/A (Fig. 1 (d)). A
previous polymorphism was found in SARS-CoV-1 at position 6 C>U (Fig. 1 (b)).
3.2. Calculation of Cis-Regulatory RNA structures and Minimum Free Energy
Rapidly emerging variations within the cis-regulatory RNA structures of the SARS-COV-2
genome were analyzed and characterized. The hotspot of S2M motif mutations was found to
occur at position 32 (G>U), where a single mutation occurred between bat/pangolin and human
stem-loop structures.

The impact of 32 G>U mutations decreased RNA secondary structure stability in both
MFE (-8.80 kcal/mol vs. -6.20 kcal/mol) and centroid structures (-8.80 kcal/mol vs. -0.80 kcal/mol)
when using RNAfold calculations (Fig. 2). The 16 G>U mutations in SARS-CoV-2 improved RNA
secondary structure stability in both minimum free energy (MFE) (-8.80 kcal/mol vs. -11.70
kcal/mol) and centroid structures (-8.80 kcal/mol vs. -9.90 kcal/mol) when using RNAfold
calculations (Fig. 2).
Interestingly, the MFE and centroid secondary S2M structures of SARS-CoV-2_2020 are
significantly different from human and bat/pangolin coronaviruses. As shown in Fig. 2, the G>U
base changes at residues 16 and 32 influence the folding of hairpin loops.
Additional analysis of canonical and MFE S2M steam-loop structures is shown by the dot
plot (Fig. 3). By superimposing various mountain plots, the bat/pangolin S2M secondary
structures appear to show equal distribution on both sides. However, the SARS-CoV-2 S2M
secondary structures shows non-uniform distribution (Fig. 3). The closer the two curves, the better
is the defined diffraction of the S2M structures in human and bat/pangolin coronaviruses.
The centroid structures of RNA S2M sequences with minimal base-pair distance are significantly
different in human MFE structures of astroviruses, and are similar in other astroviruses (Fig. S3,
S4).

3.3. The Tertiary Structures of SARS S2M RNA
3D structures of S2M sequences of coronaviruses in human and bat/pangolin models
were created based on the secondary structure in the dot-bracket format (Fig. 4). The mutations
at position 16 and 32 (G>U) impact tertiary structures and consequently cause conformational
changes. The human stem-loop structure is bent to the right side when compared to the stem-

loop structure in the bat/pangolin coronavirus (Fig. 5). The conformational changes within the
S2M loop may affect its binding to host proteins and enzymes.

3.4. Alignment and Clustering of S2M Stem-Forming Elements and Columns
ClustalW multiple sequence alignment was used to align secondary structures.
The great majority of the sequences were able to fold into the canonical S2M stem-loop structure.
Clusters of S2M sequences are highlighted. The clustering trees of coronavirus (Fig. 6) and
astrovirus (Fig. S2) are displayed. The 32 G>U mutation introduces changes in Watson–Crick
pairing, with resultant changes in the predicted secondary structures. ClustalW multiple sequence
alignment reveals that 32 G>U base-pairing exhibits complementary changes to the secondary
structures.

3.5. Potential Interaction of S2M motifs and Human miRNAs
Mirbase was used to screen human miRNA that could target S2M sequences. Additional
focus was put on miRNAs that have been reported as components of anti-viral miRNA-mediated
defense [28]. This study identified two potential binding sites within the S2M sequences of
bat/pangolin and SARS-CoV-1: hsa-miR-1304-3p & hsa-miR-1307-3p. Only one potential binding
site was found within the S2M of Australian and Iranian SARS-CoV-2 samples: hsa-miR-1307-3p
(Fig. 7).

3.6. Earlier mutations of 16 G>U/A S2M motifs

While analyzing all available sequences available up to August 14th 2020, a 16 G>U/A S2M motif
mutation was identified at position 29742 of SARS-CoV-2-2020 in Iran, Australia, Taiwan, Sir Lanka,
Bahrain, USA, Georgia, Bangladesh, Norway, Hong-Kong, Germany and Turkey (Fig. 8 and 9).
4. Discussion
The current study found that a consistent G>U mutation at the 32 position, of the 43 nucleotide,
long S2M sequence of SARS-CoV-2. This mutation has not been found in any bat or pangolin
CoV strains. We concluded that transmissibility to human from bat/pangolin was related to this
mutation.
The MFE1 and centroid secondary structures were found to be significantly different in
SARS-CoV-2 sequences in comparison to bat/pangolin coronavirus sequences. This appears
to be due to the mutation occurring at position 32 of S2M. There were also significant differences
in the MFE1 and centroid structures between the human SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV-2_2020
S2M sequences. The MFE and centroid secondary structures were observed to be similar in
S2M bat/pangolin coronavirus and SARS-COVs.
Ancestral recombination and genetic similarity between coronaviruses infecting
bats/pangolins and humans may have played a key role in the evolution of the strain that led to
the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in humans (24).
The analysis of Australian SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed clustering of mutations in
S2M secondary structures across coronaviruses and astroviruses. These new changes within
the S2M sequences and structures could be the virus’ escape mechanism from host defense
systems. The SARS S2M secondary structures containing G (16), and G (32) are conserved in
Bat/pangolin related coronaviruses. A/U (16) and U (32) mutations are found in SARS-COV-22020. These changes create a less stable RNA structure in SARS-CoV-2, thereby granting it

more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate
its entry into host proteins and enzymes
Based on the structural similarities between micro RNA hairpins implicated in gene
regulation, it is possible that S2M functions through an RNA interference-like mechanism, and
possibly targeting homologous sequence loci in the infected organisms (25).
32G>U mutations may change the RNA secondary structures that are critical to viral
reproduction or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. While screening for human
miRNA targets on S2M motifs, two targets sequences were found within the bat/pangolin and
SARS-CoV-1 S2M and one within the SARS-CoV-2. The presence of host miRNA targets within
S2M motifs may be crucial for host selection and anti-viral miRNA-mediated defense. The S2M
of SARS-CoV-2 may promote its viability and infectivity.
It is likely that the S2M sequences of (+) ssRNA viruses are still active and will continue to affect
these viruses’ evolution [5]. The 16 G>U/A and 32 G>U nucleotide changes in the S2M sequence
of SARS-CoV-2 render it a target for one human miRNA, hsa-miR-1307-3p. However,
bat/pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-1 S2M sequences are targetable by two human
miRNAs hsa-miR-1307-3p and hsa-miR-1304-3p. As such, only one human miRNA is capable of
targeting the S2M sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and affecting its viral replication.
5. Conclusions
The study examined S2M mutations able to impact the cis-regulatory elements in the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. While the evolutionary and functional origin of S2M has yet to be
discovered, its presence across even distantly related viruses insinuates that the sequence is
important for viral transmission. These findings provide insight into the significance of viral RNA
structures and introduce S2M as a potential target for development of vaccines and therapeutic
agents.
