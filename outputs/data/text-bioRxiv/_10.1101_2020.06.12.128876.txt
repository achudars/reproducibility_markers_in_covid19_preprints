Abstract
Seasonal flu and pandemics, which account for millions of infections and hundreds of
thousands of deaths, require rapid and reliable detection mechanisms for preventive and
therapeutic measures. Current methods of viral detection have limitations in speed, accuracy,
accessibility, and usability. This project presents a novel, widely applicable viral diagnosis that
uses a modified version of the traditional rolling circle amplification (RCA) to be sensitive,
specific, direct, colorimetric, and operable at room temperature. We are specifically aiming to
detect SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A (H1N1pdm09), and Influenza B (Victoria Lineage). Results
using synthetic viral DNA sequences show that the diagnostic test could take as fast as 30
minutes and detect up to picomolar concentrations of DNA strands. The next step for this project
is to test the assay with synthetic viral RNA to verify the results. We envision that the
implementation of this type of diagnostic test could allow faster responses to outbreaks of related
viruses and quicker societal recovery.

Introduction
Current Methods of Viral Detection
Virus detection tests are imperative in the control of virus dissemination for seasonal flus
and pandemics. Current methods of virus detection include blood serology, viral cultures, lateral
flow immunoassays, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) ​(Lippi et
al., 2020)​. However, each of these detection diagnostics has its shortcomings. Blood serology,
conducted through indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), has a high incidence
of cross contamination between wells, and thus can return false positives ​(Lippi et al., 2020)​.
Additionally, since blood serology tests measure the antibody response in patients, this method
can lead to delayed diagnosis, as an antibody response typically takes approximately 2 weeks to
develop ​(Lippi et al., 2020)​. An alternative is the viral cell culture, but the growth of actual
viruses could pose dangerous conditions to individuals operating the test ​(2019)​. The process of

culturing viruses also varies in time, and therefore it can take up to 30 days before a result is
obtained ​(CDC., 2019)​. Though lateral flow immunoassay is relatively quicker, it has a high rate
of false negatives due to low sensitivity. This is mainly due to the failure of viral protein
amplification during the detection process ​(CDC., 2019)​. Finally, RT-PCR, the gold standard in
viral testing, requires expensive thermal cyclers and skilled technicians to run tests and interpret
the data ​(Alhassan et al., 2015)​. RT-PCR also has limited specificity due to the reliance on
reverse transcriptase for indirect cDNA targeting ​(Alhassan et al., 2015)​. Compared to other
methods of detection, RT-PCR is relatively accurate. However, it is important to mention that its
lowest error rate is 21% after the first 8 days after virus exposure and can go as high as 67%
within the first 5 days after virus exposure (Hayek, 2020).
Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification
A leading and more promising approach to detection is isothermal nucleic acid
amplification, which allows an assay to be run at one constant temperature. The main methods
include loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and rolling circle amplification (RCA).
LAMP was not chosen for this project as it requires a high temperature of 65 o​​ C for isothermal
amplification ​(Ge et al., 2017)​. LAMP also relies on reverse transcriptase for RNA virus
detection, which limits the specificity of the assay due to the low fidelity of reverse transcriptase.
Specifically, reverse transcriptase can make as high as 1 error per 70 polymerized nucleotides
(Roberts et al., 1988)​.
Thus, RCA was selected as the basis of the viral diagnostic test for this project. RCA uses
padlock probes that hybridize to specific complementary sequences that are targeted. The
selected ligase of choice circularizes the padlock probes by ligating the 5’ phosphate group to the
3’ end of the probe ​(Hamidi and Ghourchian, 2015)​. The circular probe then serves as a template
for the chosen DNA polymerase to continually synthesize DNA strands and thereby amplifying
the signal ​(Hamidi and Perreault, 2019)​. If there is no complementary sequence to be targeted,
this process would not occur ​(Gu et al., 2018)​. Not only is this highly sensitive and specific, but
the ability to modify the procedures of RCA to conduct direct RNA testing, room temperature
reactions, and colorimetric visual detection makes RCA the preeminent method for viral
detection. In this study, we took advantage of the fact that dNTP usage in the synthesis of DNA
strands yields hydrogen ions. By removing the buffer components in the solutions used in the
reaction, using a pH indicator could provide a colorimetric readout to the test. We selected phi29
DNA polymerase as the DNA polymerase instead of the various Bst DNA polymerase options
due to its optimal enzymatic activity at 30​o​C which is close to room temperature ​(de Vega et al.,
2010)​. We used T4 DNA ligase for initial DNA target testing and SplintR ligase for RNA target
testing which operates with optimal enzymatic activity at 16​o​C and 25​o​C respectively ​(Lohman et
al., 2014; Sexton et al., 2012; Thuronyi et al., 2019)​. These are both near room temperature. In
addition, SplintR ligase has a high fidelity, which serves the purpose of ensuring that both sides

of the ligation junction are both complementary before catalyzing the ligation reaction ​(Lohman
et al., 2014)​.

Methods
Synthetic Viral Targets, Probes and Primers
Both DNA and RNA targets were designed with BioEdit through SARS-CoV-2,
Influenza A (H1N1pdm09), and Influenza B (Victoria Lineage) sequences provided in NCBI
GenBank. Specifically, the Spike (S) glycoprotein gene for SARS-CoV-2 and the Hemagglutinin
(HA) gene for Influenza A and B were targeted due to their high copy number in viruses. The 36
nucleotides in the specified genes of each virus were selected as targets because of their differing
sequence from the same segment of other viruses. They were also selected due to the gene
segment’s lack of mutations across multiple cases, locations, and years.
Padlock probes were designed by adding half of the reverse complement of the target
sequence to each side of the padlock probe backbone. A standard padlock probe backbone
sequence that has shown to work successfully in RCA tests was chosen from literature. Since the
padlock probes have to be capable of being ligated, the phosphate group modification was added
to the 5’ end of each probe. A forward primer complementary to the padlock probe backbone and
a reverse primer that has the same sequence as another portion of the padlock probe backbone
were designed. Both the forward and reverse overlap primers have two phosphorothioate
modifications at the 3’ end to prevent the exonuclease activity of phi29 from cutting the two
primers. The reverse overlap primer synthesizes DNA strands using the complementary DNA
strands synthesized from the forward primer as a template. The designed synthetic viral targets,
probes, and primers were all synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies.
Buffer-free reaction solutions
Due to this diagnostic test’s dependence on pH change, we created ligation and
amplification reaction solutions with no Tris-HCl buffer. These reaction solutions included the
same reagents as the commercial reaction buffer from NEB but without Tris-HCl. Each 2X
“no-Tris” ligation solution with 20 mM of MgCl​2​, 2 mM of ATP, 20 mM of DTT, 3.5 mM of
NaOH was made in a 100μL stock. Similarly, each 2X “no-Tris” amplification solution with 20
mM of MgCl​2​, 20 mM of (NH​4​)​2​SO​4​, 8 mM of DTT, 2.8 mM of dNTP, 2 mM of NaOH was
made in a 100μL stock.
Ligation and amplification reactions
The ligation and rolling circle amplification (RCA) reactions were run simultaneously in
the same PCR tube at a total volume of 40 μL. For the ligation reaction, 5 μL of 2X "no-Tris"
ligation solution was added to 1μL of a 2.5μM DNA Target, 1μL of a 10μM padlock probe
(PLP), 1μL of T4 ligase, and 2μL of deionized H​2​O. For the amplification reaction, 20μL of 2X

"no-Tris" amplification solution, 2μL of 24μM forward primer (PLP-1), 2μL of 24μM reverse
overlap primer (PLP-2), 5μL of 0.05% Phenol Red, and 1μL of phi29 were added to the 10μL
ligation mixture. Let the PCR tube sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
Optimization, Sensitivity, and Time Course Tests
Since each reaction contained a multitude of variables that might affect the overall time
for a color change to occur, many different concentrations and amounts of each component were
tested to reach the optimal setting. Specifically, the 10U, 20U, and 30U of phi29, 0.1μM,
0.25μM, 0.5μM, and 1μM of PLP, 2.0μL, 3.0μL, and 3.5μL of NaOH in the amplification
reaction solution, and 0.05% and 0.005% of phenol red were tested independently. The optimal
concentration and amount for each substance determined through testing of these various
variables were as described above.
For the sensitivity, the 2.5uM DNA Target used was diluted to 2.5nM and 2.5pM DNA
target samples. The same reaction was run with these lower concentrations of DNA targets to see
the extent to which the test can diagnose the low amounts of a virus. 2μL of phi29 was used to
maximize the effectiveness of the test.
The purpose of the time course tests were to obtain qualitative evidence that the color
change in the assay was due to DNA amplification. In order to do so, we ran the ligation and
amplification reaction, but took aliquots of 10μL out after every 10 minutes from the initial
40μL, and heat shocked these aliquots at 60​o​C for 10 minutes as the heat would have inactivated
the reaction, and repeated until the initial tube only had 10μL remaining. We then ran a 1% DNA
gel to confirm the presence of DNA.
Modeling Data Collection and Analysis
Reactions containing different concentrations of a DNA target and its corresponding PLP
were carried out in distinct PCR tubes to evaluate the effect of each component on the reaction
rate (Table #3). These reactions were run at 20 μL with the concentration of each component
except for the DNA target and its complementary PLP kept the same. A negative control
consisting of non-matching DNA target and PLP pairs was run and recorded simultaneously. All
reactions were recorded together in a time-lapse video.
The volume of the reactions was insufficient for standard methods of spectrophotometry,
and thus computer vision was used to quantify the reactions. Pixels displaying the reactions were
isolated in each frame of the time-lapse video, and values outside an empirically determined
number of standard deviations from the mean were removed as outliers. The remaining pixels in
each frame were averaged to plot mean hue against time. (Figure #1).

Based on Table #1, the results show that a visual color change for the reaction can occur
as fast as 30 minutes with the test groups turning orange and the negative remaining purple for
influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2 tests. By 3 hours, the test group changes to yellow
and the negative control still remains purple. But in some instances such as the SARS-CoV-2
test, the negative control changed slightly orange. However, the test groups still arrived at a color
change to both orange and yellow at a much faster speed than the negative control managed to
reach an orange color. This enables the presence of the virus being tested to be identified
accurately with a predetermined time to examine the results of the diagnostic test.

Tube #4 is a test group with 2.5pM of SARS-CoV-2 target.

The sensitivity test results as shown in Table #2, shows that this diagnostic test has the
capability to detect not just micromolar concentrations of synthetic viral targets, but also up to
picomolar concentrations. It is important to mention that the test appears to have started at an
orange color for all tubes due to the strong lighting at the time of recording as well as the rapid
color change from purple to orange that occured for the tests.

Figure #2. A time course test for Influenza B was run on 1% agarose gel and imaged using a UV scanner.
Negative Controls were treated with a SARS-CoV-2 target, test groups were treated with an Influenza B target, and
all tests used an Influenza B padlock probe. The leftmost lane was a 1kb DNA ladder; lane 1 was the negative
control after 20 minutes; lane 2 was the test group after 20 minutes; lane 3 was the negative control after 30 minutes;
lane 4 was the test group after 30 minutes; lane 5 was the negative control after 40 minutes; lane 6 is the test group
after 40 minutes; and the rightmost lane was a 100bp DNA ladder.

The time course test shown in Figure #2 suggests that DNA amplification is in fact taking
place due to the smears of DNA across the gel in the test group. In addition, the bright lights
visualized in the wells of the test group compared to the negative control may further suggest
that tangled and clumps of DNA strands synthesized is at such a high quantity that it is unable to
pass through the porous of the gel. We also attempted to use less concentrated gels but the later
of gel integrity simply made it difficult to even allow it to stay intact.

Figure #5. The change of hue over time of reactions C1, C3, D2, E1, and a negative control.

According to Figure 3, the rates of the reactions—determined by the speed of hue
change—are fast during the first hour, and then gradually plateaus after 2 hours. Not only does
this corroborate with previous conclusions based on visual analysis, but the trend exhibited by
the reactions in Figure 3 is also shared among the other reactions as shown in Figures 3, and 3.
Although the negative control ultimately reaches a yellowish hue, it changes color at an
extremely slow and seemingly constant rate (Figure 3).
We suspect that the slight change in color for the negative control occurs due to the
function of T4 ligase. Unlike enzymes such as HiFi Taq DNA ligase, T4 ligase does not check
whether each side of the ligation junction is fully complementary before catalyzing the ligation
reaction. For this reason, we believe that it is possible that partial complementary sequences
between the mismatched target and padlock probe sequence could’ve caused ligation and
circularization of the probe. Though this does not impede this diagnostic test’s ability to
differentiate between two viruses, we also believe that this issue will be solved in the plans
discussed under further directions.
Computer vision was chosen to analyze the reactions’ rates over traditional methods like
the use of a pH meter or plate reader due to several reasons. One reason was that the miniscule
volume of the reactions was insufficient for proper spectrophotometry and required a specialized,
expensive pH probe for the measurement of pH. By using computer vision, this obstacle was

overcome, as most measurements could now be done on more accessible machines. Steps
required for computer vision are also more straightforward than those for the traditional methods,
and thus the amount of work to perform data analysis is greatly reduced. Through the use of
computer vision, a more accurate analysis could also be made, as its use allowed the recording of
many more data points in a certain timeframe. However, the use of computer vision potentially
yields sources of error, as it can be sensitive to environmental factors such as changes in light
intensity. Due to uncontrollable factors, the light may alter slightly between windows and can
vary across different recordings. The effect of this source of error is minimized by keeping the
light source, camera, and PCR tubes’ positions consistent and running multiple reactions
simultaneously. Additionally, hue, as a measurement of perceived light, is theoretically
unaffected by brightness and saturation.

Further Directions
Although this current viral diagnostic test uses DNA targets, we plan to use the designed
RNA targets to verify the results. In order for ligation to function for a RNA and DNA padlock
probe hybrid to occur, SplintR ligase will be used. SplintR ligase is used for SNP level detection
for ligating only fully complementary RNA and DNA hybrid segments. This could potentially
prevent possible ligations of padlock probes through non-complementary binding between the
target and padlock probe, and eliminate the slight color change that occurs in the negative control
after numerous hours.
We aim to use this simple viral diagnostic test to create a test kit that can be used by not
only hospital staff and laboratory technicians, but by consumers at home as well. To do so, we
will also develop a simple and quick sample preparation technique for viral extracts from the
patients and possible better alternatives to a nasopharyngeal swab.
Though micro-pH probes are available for the measurement of pH at extremely small
volumes, micro-pH probes are typically very expensive. Thus, we are also working to use
computer vision techniques to approximate the pH of the reactions. Using a set of standard
solutions as shown in Figure #6, we have already created a regression curve relating hue to pH.
The goal is to approximate pH by fitting hue obtained from experiments to the curve (Figure #7).
We also plan on eliminating possible confounding variables such as light reflection in order to
reliably approximate the pH of the reactions.
