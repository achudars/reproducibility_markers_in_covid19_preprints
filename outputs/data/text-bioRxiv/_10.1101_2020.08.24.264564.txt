Abstract
The major challenge of the COVID-19 health crisis is to identify the factors of susceptibility
to SARS-Cov2 in order to adapt the recommendations to the populations and to reduce the
risk of getting COVID-19 to the most vulnerable people especially those having chronic
respiratory diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway epithelial cells (AEC) are playing
a critical role in the immune response and in COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 infects the
airways through ACE2 receptor and the host protease TMPRSS2 was shown to play a major
role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Here, we show that the main component of P. aeruginosa
flagella, ie. flagellin is able to increase TMPRSS2 expression in AEC, and even more in those
deficient for CFTR. Importantly, this increased TMPRSS2 expression is associated with an
increase in the level of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the urgency of the health
situation, this result is of major significance for patients with CF which are frequently
infected and colonized by P. aeruginosa during the course of the disease.

As of November 3, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (CoV)-2 has infected globally near
47 million people with more than 1 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int). One of the major
challenges of this health crisis is to identify factors of susceptibility to this viral infection in
order to adapt public health recommendations and to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19,
notably for the most vulnerable people. This is the case of patients having common chronic
respiratory diseases (CRD) such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), but also for patients with less common or rare CRD, such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and
interstitial lung diseases. Even if it seems reasonable to think that, as they have a lung
impairment, people with CRD would be at higher risk to develop a severe COVID-19, the
magnitude of this risk is still uncertain (1). Along with the clinical follow-up of these patients
to have a better estimation of their risk, basic research regarding the pathophysiology of
SARS-CoV-2 infection will provide important insight.
This is particularly true for patients with CF. This disease is caused by variants in the CFTR
gene, the most frequent being F508del, which result in an abnormal function of the airway
epithelial cells (AEC). During the course of CF, lungs of the patients are inflamed and
chronically infected by various pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is the
most prevalent (80% in CF adults) (2). Up to now, a multinational report identified 40 cases
of CF patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 with no death recorded (3). Of these cases, 50% had
chronic P. aeruginosa airways infection, 78% had symptoms at COVID-19 onset such as
fever (77% of the symptomatic patients), altered cough (48%) and/or dyspnea (32%). AEC
are known to play a critical role in both the immune response and COVID-19 severity (4).
SARS-CoV-2 infects the airways mainly through the ACE2 receptor, and two specific host
proteases, TMPRSS2 and FURIN, were shown to play a major role in SARS-CoV-2
infectivity (5-9).

In this study, we show that the main component of P. aeruginosa flagella, ie. flagellin (PA-F),
is able to increase TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells, and even more in those
deficient for CFTR. Importantly, this increased TMPRSS2 expression is associated with an
increase in the level of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We first examined ACE2, FURIN and TMPRSS2 expression from a previous transcriptomic
study performed with primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) isolated from control
donors (non-CF) and CF patients homozygous for the CFTR F508del variant, infected by P.
aeruginosa (10). At baseline (time 0 h), similar ACE2 and FURIN mRNA expression levels
are observed between non-CF and CF primary hAEC (Fig. 1A, left), whereas TMPRSS2
expression is significantly increased in CF primary hAEC (Fig. 1A, right). Importantly, P.
aeruginosa increases TMPRSS2 mRNA expression over time (Fig. 1A) in CF primary hAEC
only, while ACE2 and FURIN expressions are not affected (Fig. 1A, left).
We thus exposed CF primary hAEC to flagellin, the ligand of Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 5
and the most important proinflammatory factor of P. aeruginosa present in the sputum of CF
patients (11). We observed that flagellin significantly increases mRNA levels of TMPRSS2
without increasing those of ACE2 (Fig 1B).
In order to study the mechanism underlying this increase, we used the Calu-3 cell line, which
exhibits high ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels and detectable ACE2 protein expression
compared with Beas-2B and 16HBE airway epithelial cell lines (Fig. 1C). This result is
consistent with the already observed higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in Calu-3
cells in comparison to Beas-2B (6).
Next, as observed in CF primary hAEC, we showed that exposure of Calu-3 cells to PA-F
significantly increases TMPRSS2 transcripts, without affecting ACE2 mRNA (Fig. 1D) and
protein expression (not illustrated). Intriguingly, the increase in TMPRSS2 expression is more
important in Calu-3 cells deficient for CFTR (Calu-3-CFTR-KD) than in standard Calu-3 cells

sufficient for CFTR (Calu-3-CFTR-WT) (Fig. 1D). This increase in TMPRSS2 expression is
TLR5 dependent (Fig. 1E) and also detected at the protein level (Fig. 1F). As expected,
flagellin induces the synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 (Fig. 1G) both in CFTRWT and -KD Calu-3 cells. As already described (12), CF-like epithelial cells exhibit a more
potent inflammatory response to flagellin.
Finally, after infection with SARS-CoV-2, we observed an increase in the intracellular viral
mRNA nsp14, which is significantly higher in Calu-3-CFTR-KD cells and even more
important when cells were pre-stimulated with flagellin (Fig. 1H, left). In contrast,
extracellular viral mRNA nsp14 level measured at the apical side as a surrogate of viral
production is significantly lower in Calu-3-CFTR-KD than in Calu-3-CFTR-WT cells (Fig.
1H, right). Whereas flagellin pre-stimulation does not affect viral particle release in Calu-3CFTR-WT cells, a lower, yet not statistically significant, level of nsp14 mRNA is measured at
the apical side of whereas, Calu-3-CFTR-KD cells.
The increase of intracellular viral mRNA found in CF cells exposed to flagellin, indicating a
higher level of infection, is likely the result of the increased expression of TMPRSS2. Indeed,
TMPRSS2 inhibition by the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate is sufficient to
prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 (6). We could hypothesize that the lower level of viral
particle at the apical side observed in CF cells may be the result of increased host defense
capacities of CF cells against viral infection. Further mechanistic works are necessary to
know if this response would be protective or damaging for CF patients. Most of CF patients
are colonized by P. aeruginosa and, to date, even if the results of the clinical follow-up of CF
patients are limited, it seems that these patients are not at higher risk to severe COVID-19
than the general population (3). Several studies have delineated the antiviral capacities of
flagellin against other respiratory virus, including influenza A (13), and flagellin was recently
suggested to modulate the innate response in order to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 and resolve

COVID-19 (14). Whether CF patients are protected of developing severe form of COVID-19
thanks to their P. aeruginosa infection will be difficult to prove at the clinical level. However,
further works elucidating the mechanisms associated with the specific host response of CF
cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection could help to elucidate this question and give future
therapeutic insights.

1% antibiotics as recommended by the provider.

RT qPCR
RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA/miRNA (Macherey Nagel, Duren, Germany). RT
was performed using a high-capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Real-time qPCR was performed with an ABI QS3, using Sensifast Probe Lo-Rox Kit (Biotechnofix, Guibeville, France), TaqMan probes and cDNA as a template. For relative
quantification, the amount of target genes was normalized to the expression of GAPDH
relative to reference group (specified in the figure legends) used as a calibrator and was
calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method.

Western Blotting
Total proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France).
An equal amount of proteins (20 μg) was reduced, size-separated on 12% stain-free precast
SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Biorad, Hercules, CA), and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes using iBlot2 apparatus (ThermoFisher scientific). The membranes were blocked
in 5% milk in TBS-Tween 0.1% and incubated with specific primary antibodies O/N at 4°C.
Bound antibodies were detected using clarity chemiluminescent substrate (Biorad). Images
were recorded with a Fujifilm LAS-3000 bioimaging system (Fujifilm, Stamford, CT, USA).

Immunofluorescence
Cells were plated in 24-well plate on 12 mm diameter #1.5 coverslips (Marienfeld, LaudaKönigshofen, Germany) or on filters at the air-liquid interface and growth as previously
described. After treatments, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with ice cold PFA 4% 20
