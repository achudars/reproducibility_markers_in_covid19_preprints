Abstract
There is an urgent need for vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging
progress has been made in developing antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID19. Among the drug targets being investigated, the viral main protease (Mpro) is one of the most
extensively studied drug targets. Mpro is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the viral polyprotein at more
than 11 sites and it is highly conserved among coronaviruses. In addition, Mpro has a unique substrate
preference for glutamine in the P1 position. Taken together, it appears that Mpro inhibitors can achieve
both broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a high selectivity index. Structurally diverse compounds have
been reported as Mpro inhibitors, with several of which also showed antiviral activity in cell culture. In this
study, we investigated the mechanism of action of six previously reported Mpro inhibitors, ebselen,
disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 using a consortium of techniques including FRETbased enzymatic assay, thermal shift assay, native mass spectrometry, cellular antiviral assays, and
molecular dynamics simulations. Collectively, the results showed that the inhibition of M pro by these six
compounds is non-specific and the inhibition is abolished or greatly reduced with the addition of reducing
reagent DTT. In the absence of DTT, these six compounds not only inhibit Mpro, but also a panel of viral
cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease, the 2Apro and 3Cpro from enterovirus A71
(EV-A71) and EV-D68. However, none of the compounds inhibits the viral replication of EV-A71 or EVD68, suggesting that the enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 values obtained in the absence of DTT cannot
be used to faithfully predict their cellular antiviral activity. Overall, we provide compelling evidence
suggesting that ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 are non-specific SARSCoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, and urge the scientific community to be stringent with hit validation.

Introduction
A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, started to circulate among humans in late 2019 and quickly
evolved to be a global pandemic. As of August 31, 2020, there have been more than 6 million positive
cases with over 183,000 deaths in the United States alone. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under
investigation, and the closest strain is the bat coronavirus RaTG13, which shares 96% sequence similarity
with SARS-CoV-2.1 It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 transmitted directly from bats to humans or
through an intermediate host.2 There is currently no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for SARS-CoV2. Encouraging progress has been made in vaccine development, and several RNA, DNA, and
adenovirus-based vaccine candidates are now in phase III clinical trials.3 For small molecule antivirals,
remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization in the United States.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the
betacoronavirus genera, which also includes SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1.
SARS-CoV-2 shares ~80% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV. As such, many of the reported antivirals
against SARS-CoV-2 were originally developed for SARS-CoV or other related coronaviruses.4 SARSCoV-2 infects ACE2 expressing cells and enters cell through either direct cell surface fusion or
endosomal pathway.5 For direct cell surface fusion, the host membrane protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the
viral spike protein, trigging the viral membrane fusion with the host cell membrane.6 For the endosomal
entry, cathepsin L mediates the cleavage of viral spike protein.7 Once the viral RNA is released in the
cytoplasm, it undergoes translation into viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are subsequently
cleaved by two viral proteases, the main protease (Mpro), also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease
(3CLpro), and the papain-like protease (PLpro). The released viral proteins can then assemble to form the
viral polymerase RdRp complex to catalyze the replication of viral RNA. Finally, the progeny virions are
released from the infected cells through exocytosis and are ready for the next round of infection.
Compounds that interfere with any step in the viral life cycle are expected to inhibit viral replication.
Among the list of drug targets pursued for SARS-CoV-2 small molecule antivirals, the viral polymerase

RdRp and the protease Mpro are the most extensively studied ones. The RdRp inhibitor, remdesivir,
received emergency use authorization in the United States. It showed broad-spectrum antiviral activity
against multiple coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV in cell culture, and it
also had in vivo efficacy in SARS-CoV infection mouse model.8 EIDD-2801, an RdRp inhibitor, is
another promising drug candidate with broad-spectrum antiviral activity.9 The Mpro is a cysteine protease
that cleaves the viral polyprotein at more than 11 sites. It has a unique substrate preference of glutamine
at the P1 position of the substrate, while no host protease is known to have such a preference.10 As such,
the most potent Mpro inhibitors such as GC376 and N3 all contain a 2-pyrrolidone substitution in the P1
position as a mimetic of the glutamine in the substrate. Several crystal structures of Mpro in complex with
inhibitors have been solved, showing that the pyrrolidone forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the His163
and Glu166 side chains and the main chain of Phe140.11-14 In addition to the classic pyrrolidonecontaining Mpro inhibitors, several non-canonical Mpro inhibitors have also been reported with both
enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity.11-12 In this study, we aim to validate six previously
reported Mpro inhibitors, ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 (Fig. 1).12 Among
the six compounds, ebselen is a clinical candidate with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. In
preclinical studies, ebselen was reported to react with cysteine residues from completely unrelated
proteins including the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid,15 the mycobacterium tuberculosis
transpeptidase LdtMt2,16 glutamate dehydrogenase,17 clostridium difficile toxins TcdA and TcdB,18 the
mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen 85C enzyme,19 the hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase,20 and many
others. Ebselen was also reported to induce protein unfolding for the insulin-degrading enzyme.21 Ebselen
analogues were synthesized and were found to inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro.22 Disulfiram
inhibits a panel of diverse enzymes including methyltransferase,23 urease,24 and kinase25 through reacting
with the cysteine residues. A study also showed that disulfiram inhibits the PLpro from SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV with IC50 values of 14.2 and 22.7 µM, respectively.26 However, the inhibition was
completely lost in the presence of 5 mM of β-mercaptoethanol (IC50 > 300 µM).26 Carmofur inhibits
human acid ceramidase by covalently modify the catalytic C143 residue.27 PX-12 inhibits tubulin

polymerization through cysteine oxidation.28 Tideglusib is an irreversible inhibitor of glycogen synthase
kinase-3β (GSK-3β).29
Ebselen, disulfiram, carmoufur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin were recently reported as SARSCoV-2 Mpro inhibitors with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.39 µM in the FRET-based enzymatic
assay.12 Among the six compounds, ebselen inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC50 value of
4.67 ± 0.80 µM in plaque reduction assay. Disulfiram was able to reduce the viral replication by ~30% in
the viral titer reduction assay at 10 µM, while other compounds tideglusib, carmofur, and PX-12 had no
significant antiviral effect. Intriguingly, in a follow up study, carmofur was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV2 viral replication with an EC50 of 24.30 µM, and the X-ray crystal structure of Mpro with carmofur was
solved (PDB: 7BUY).30 The description of the enzymatic assay did not specify whether reducing reagent
dithiothreitol (DTT) was added or not. It is a standard practice to add DTT or other reducing reagent such
as glutathione (GSH) or β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) in the enzymatic assay of cysteine protease to ensure
that the enzyme is in the active form by reducing the catalytic cysteine residue as well as preventing nonspecific thiol reactive compounds to covalently modify the catalytic cysteine.
The questions we are trying to address in this study are whether the inhibition of M pro by these
compounds is specific and whether their enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 values can be used to
faithfully predict the cellular antiviral activity. In other words, do the reported IC50 values of ebselen,
disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reflect specific
enzymatic inhibition, or is it due to non-specific inactivation of the enzyme? For this, we tested these
compounds against a panel of related and unrelated viral cysteine proteases, the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, and
the 2A protease (2Apro) and 3C protease (3Cpro) from EV-A71 and EV-D68 in a consortium of assays
either with or without DTT. Collectively, our results showed that in the absence of DTT, ebselen,
disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 non-specifically inhibit all six viral cysteine
proteases including SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, despite their potent inhibition of enzymatic activity of
2Apro and 3Cpro from EV-A71 and EV-D68 in the FRET assay in the absence of DTT, none of the

compounds showed cellular antiviral activity against EV-A71 and EV-D68. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the enzymatic inhibition potency of cysteine protease inhibitors obtained in the absence of
DTT cannot be used to predict the cellular antiviral activity. Overall, although there is an immediate need
for SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, the scientific community needs to be cautious about the non-specific effect of
promiscuous compounds, and secondary assays should be performed at the early stage to triage hits that
lack translational potential.

Results
The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, PLpro, and EV-A71 and EV-D68 2Apro and 3Cpro by ebselen,
disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin is DTT-dependent. To dissect the effect of
DTT on the enzymatic inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by ebselen, disulfiram, carmoufur, PX-12,
tideglusib, and shikonin, we performed dose response titration in the FRET-based enzymatic assay with
and without 4 mM DTT. A known Mpro inhibitor, GC376, was included as a positive control. It was found
that all compounds inhibited Mpro in the absence of DTT (Fig. 2A, red curves), and the IC50 values are
generally in agreement with previous published results,12 except shikonin and PX-12, which showed more
than 10-fold difference. However, none of the compounds showed potent inhibition against Mpro in the

presence of 4 mM DTT (IC50 > 25 µM) (Fig. 2A, black curves). Carmofur showed weak inhibition with
an IC50 value of 28.2 ± 9.5 µM in the presence of DTT (Table 1). In contrast, GC376 showed consistent
inhibition against Mpro both in the absence and presence of DTT with IC50 values of 0.03 µM and 0.03
µM, respectively (Fig. 2A, last column; Table 1). These results suggest that the claimed inhibition of Mpro
by these six compounds might not be target specific. To test this hypothesis, we next tested these six
compounds against five other viral cysteine proteases, among which SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, EV-A71 2Apro,
and EV-D68 2Apro have no sequence similarity as Mpro, while EV-A71 3Cpro and EV-D68 3Cpro share
similar chymotrypsin-like folding with Mpro, despite only showing 16.3% and 19.6% sequence similarities
as Mpro. GRL0617 was included as a positive control for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, and telaprevir was included
as a positive control for EV-A71 2Apro and EV-D68 2Apro. GC376 was used as a positive control for both
EV-A71 3Cpro and EV-D68 3Cpro. If the inhibition of Mpro by ebselen, disulfiram, carmoufur, PX-12,
tideglusib, and shikonin is specific, either in the absence or the presence of DTT, these six compounds are
expected to show little or no inhibition against the unrelated SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, EV-A71 2Apro, and EVD68 2Apro. For the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, we observed similar results as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro: all compounds
displayed potent inhibitory effect in the absence of DTT, while little or no inhibition was observed in the
presence of DTT (Fig. 2B). Shikonin was less potent against PLpro than Mpro in the absence of DTT with
IC50 values of 1.5 µM and 55.3 µM, respectively (Table 1). The potency of shikonin increased about twofold and the IC50 values were 55.3 µM and 28.2 µM with and without DTT, respectively (Table 1). As
expected, the non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitor GRL061731 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 PLpro similarly
in the present or the absence of 4 mM DTT (Fig. 2B, last column). For EV-A71 and EV-D68 2Apro and
3Cpro, we observed similar trends as Mpro: all six compounds showed potent enzymatic inhibition in the
absence of DTT and the inhibition was abolished with the addition of DTT (Figs. 2C-F). In contrast, there
is no significant shift of the potency with and without DTT for GC376 in inhibiting EV-A71 3Cpro (Fig.
2D) and EV-D68 3Cpro (Fig. 2F), and telaprevir in inhibiting EV-A71 2Apro (Fig. 2C) and EV-D68 2Apro
(Fig. 2E).

Next, we tested whether another reducing agent glutathione (GSH) could also abolish the inhibitory
effect of these promiscuous inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. For these, ebselen and disulfiram were
chosen as representative examples. In the absence of 4 mM DTT or 1 mM GSH, ebselen and disulfiram
completely inhibits Mpro enzymatic activity at 20 µM (Fig. 3); however, no inhibition was observed for
ebselen and disulfiram when either 4 mM DTT or 1 mM GSH was present in the reaction buffer (Fig. 3).
In contrast, the inhibition by the positive control GC376 was not affected by the reducing agents DTT or
GSH.

Collectively, the enzymatic assay results suggest that ebselen, disulfiram, carmoufur, PX-12,
tideglusib, and shikonin are promiscuous cysteine protease inhibitors that not only inhibit Mpro but also
five other related and unrelated viral cysteine proteases including SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, EV-A71 and EVD68 2Apro and 3Cpro in the absence of DTT, and the inhibition is abolished with the reducing reagent of
either DTT or GSH.

Figure 3. Effect of glutathione (GSH) on the inhibition of ebselen and disulfiram against SARS-CoV-2
Mpro. 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein was pre-incubated in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro reaction buffer with the
testing protease inhibitors in the absence of DTT or GSH, or in the presence of 4 mM DTT or 1 mM GSH
at 30 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 10 µM SARS-CoV-2 Mpro FRET
substrate. The initial enzymatic reaction velocity was measured and normalized to the condition that no
protease inhibitor (DMSO) and no DTT/GSH was present in the reaction buffer.

Ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin did not bind to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in
the presence of DTT in the thermal shift assay. To investigate whether ebselen, disulfiram, carmoufur,
PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin bind directly to Mpro or other related and unrelated cysteine proteases, we
performed thermal shift binding assay. In the thermal shift binding assay, a temperature gradient is
applied to denature a protein in the presence of a fluorescence dye. When protein unfolds, the
hydrophobic region is exposed to the fluorescence dye and increased fluoresce signal is observed.
Specific binding of a small-molecule to the native state of a protein usually stabilizes the protein, leading

to a shift of the melting temperature (ΔTm).32-34 Here we measured Tm change upon addition of these six
compounds in the presence or absence of 4 mM DTT against six viral cysteine proteases including Mpro.
All compounds were tested at 40 µM except shikonin, which was tested at 10 µM as it quenches the
SYPRO orange dye fluorescence signal at 40 µM. Compounds were pre-incubated with 3 µM protease in
its corresponding enzymatic reaction buffer at 30 °C for 30 min, then a 20 to 90 °C temperature gradient
was applied and Tm was calculated. As expected, for the positive controls, significant Tm increase was
observed in the binding of GC376 to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Fig. 4A), EV-A71 3Cpro (Fig. 4D) and EV-D683Cpro (Fig. 4F). Binding of GRL0617 to SARS-CoV-2 PLPro also led to significant stabilization (Fig. 4B).
Similarly, binding of telaprevir to EV-A71 2Apro and EV-D68 2Apro increased the Tm (Figs. 4C and 4E).
Importantly, there was no different in the Tm shift with and without DTT for these positive controls (Figs.
4A-F). In contrast, in the presence of 4 mM DTT, no Tm change was observed with the addition of
ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin to all six proteases, suggesting none of the
compounds bind to any of these proteases (Figs. 4A-F). In the absence of DTT, upon the addition of these
six compounds, a decrease of Tm or no change was observed (Figs. 4A-F), except in the cases when
carmofur binds to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and EV-D68 3Cpro, in which a Tm increase of 4.76 oC, and 0.87 oC
was observed, respectively (Figs. 4A and 4F). A negative Tm shift means binding of a small molecule to a
protein leads to the destabilization.
Taken together, when 4 mM DTT was present in the assay buffer, there was no binding between the
six viral cysteine proteases and the six compounds ebselen, disulfiram, carmoufur, PX-12, tideglusib, and
shikonin; without DTT, these compounds appear to non-specifically bind to these proteases, leading to
destabilization.

Boltzmann model.32 * indicates that a fluorescence peak was not observed in the melting curve; red dash

Ebselen, disulfiram, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin did not bind to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, while
carmofur showed binding in the presence of DTT in the native mass spectrometry binding assay. To
corroborate the results from the thermal shift binding assay, we next performed native mass spectrometrybased binding assays. Native MS analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 Mpro forms a dimer that was
measured to have a mass of 67,595 Da (Fig. 5A). A small abundance of monomer was measured with a
mass of 33,796 Da, but the intact dimer was the predominant signal (data not shown). The addition of
GC376 revealed that up to two ligands bound per dimer (Fig. 5B), suggesting a binding ratio of one drug

per monomer, which is consistent with its mechanism of action revealed by X-ray crystallography.11 The
addition of 4 mM DTT shifted the equilibrium to one ligand per dimer (Fig. 5C). When carmofur was
added to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, it bound up to three ligands per dimer, with the signal for the two bound per
dimer being the most abundant (Fig. 5J). When 4 mM DTT was added it disrupted ligand binding of
carmofur, with the signal for the dimer without ligand bound being the most abundant (Fig. 5K).
Nevertheless, signals corresponding to one ligand per dimer and two ligands per dimer could still be
detected, suggesting carmofur has moderate binding towards SARS-CoV-2 Mpro even in the presence of
DTT (Fig. 5K). This result is consistent with our enzymatic assay result, which showed that carmofur
inhibits Mpro with an IC50 of 28.2 ± 9.5 µM in the presence of 4 mM DTT (Fig. 2A). Taken together, the
inhibition of Mpro by carmofur has certain degree of specificity, although the potency is moderate.
Similarly, disulfram, ebselen, and PX-12 bound up to three, four, and five ligands per dimer respectively
(Figs. 5F, 5D, and 5N) in the absence of DTT, and the addition of 4 mM DTT completely disrupted this
ligand binding (Figs. 5G, 5E, and 5O), and only the dimer signal without ligand was detected. The
complete disruption of this ligand binding with the addition of DTT suggests that these compounds bind
non-specifically to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Shikonin was found to bind up to four ligands per dimer to SARSCoV-2 Mpro (Fig, 5L), and this binding was completely disrupted upon addition of 4 mM DTT (Fig. 5M).
Tideglusib did not bind to Mpro either in the absence or the presence of 4 mM DTT at concentrations
ranging from 10 µM to 40 µM (Figs. 5H-I).
The observation that ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, skikonin, and PX-12 can bind to Mpro with more
than two ligands per dimer in the absence of DTT indicates that these compounds might not only modify
the catalytic cysteine C107, but also possibly bind to either allosteric sites or covalently modify other
cysteine residues on Mpro.

Molecular dynamics simulations of the binding of Mpro to GC-376, carmofur, and ebselen. We
performed MD simulations to compare the stability of the binding interactions identified in the X-ray
structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with GC376 and carmofur. The MD simulations of Mpro with
ebselen were carried using the highest scored docking pose.
Our previous study showed that when GC376 binds to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, the covalent thioketal
adduct can adapt both the S- and R-configuration.11 The MD simulations showed that the complexes
formed with GC376 in either the S- or R-configuration did not deviate from the starting structures, which
is the X-ray structure, with an RMSD in protein and ligand positions from the X-ray structure smaller
than c.a. 2 Å for the protein and c.a. smaller than 2.3 Å for the ligand (Figs. 6C and 6F). The MD
simulations verified stabilizing interactions observed also in the X-ray structure, which remain stable
inside the binding cavity of SARS-CoV-2 as shown in the frequency interaction plot in Figs. 6A and 6D.
From the protein-ligand contact plots of the GC-376 in the S-configuration (Figs. 6A-B), it is shown that
it forms multiple hydrogen bonds, i.e., (a) between thiohemiketal P1 hydroxyl group and C145 peptidic
NH; (b) between 2-pyrrolidone's NH at the P1 and side chain of E166, and between peptidic NH at P1
with H164 side chain imidazole; (c) between carbamate CO, NH and benzyloxy oxygen at P2 with
peptidic NH at M165, Q189 side chain CO and Q189 side chain NH , respectively. In the X-ray structure
the pyrrolidone’s CO forms a hydrogen bond with H163 side chain imidazole; the MD simulation plot in

Fig. 6A represents an average description of the interactions from an ensemble and not from a single
snapshot in the X-ray structure. The polar 2-pyrrolidone group is oriented towards the solvent exposed S1
pocket while isobutyl group at P2 position is oriented comfortably towards the hydrophobic S2 site
formed by H41, M49, and M169, while the benzyloxy group facing towards L167 moves freely in the
area between Q189, A191, Q192, L167, P168 (Fig. 6B). In R-configuration GC-376 is stabilized through
hydrogen bonding interaction with C145, H164, E166, Q189 and also G143 and H41, but the hydrogen
bond interactions frequency is less when pyrrolidone side chain is buried in S1 pocket (Figs. 6D-E).
In contrast to the numerous stabilizing interactions of GC-376 in both the S- and R-configurations,
carmofur interacts mainly with C145 through van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions (Figs.
6G-H). In carmofur the MD simulations show that the RMSD in protein and ligand positions from the Xray structure are both c.a. 3 Å for the protein and the ligand. The hexyl side chain is oriented inside the
binding cavity, from S1 to S3, but the interactions of the drugs cannot be specific for Mpro without
directing hydrogen bond interactions and van der Waals complementary to the cavity. Ebselen interacts
through hydrogen bonding interactions mainly with E166 and van der Waals interactions with M49 and
M165 in the hydrophobic S2 binding area. Similarly to carmofur these interactions are not adequate to
trap effectively the small drug inside the wide binding area of Mpro (Figs. 6J-K), and the drug can rotate
around the phenyl-CO bond, resulting a high RMSD of c.a 5.4 Å (Fig. 6L).
Compared to GC376, the protein-ligand contact plots of carmofur and ebselen suggest that these two
compounds bind to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with reduced affinity, corroborating with their non-specific
inhibition mechanism.

Ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin had no cellular antiviral activity
against EV-A71 and EV-D68. If the enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 values obtained in the absence of
DTT can be used to faithfully predict the cellular antiviral activity, one would expected all six compounds
ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin will have potent antiviral activity against
EV-A71 and EV-D68. To test this hypothesis, the cellular antiviral activity of ebselen, disulfiram,
carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin against EV-A71 and EV-D68 viruses were tested in RD cells
using the viral cytopathic effect (CPE) assay.33 GC376 and telaprevir were included as positive controls
as 3Cpro and 2Apro inhibitors. GC376 inhibited EV-A71 and EV-D68 with EC50 values of 0.2 µM and 0.9
µM, respectively (Table 2). Telaprevir inhibited EV-D68 with an EC50 of 0.4 µM (Table 2). However,
none of the six compounds showed antiviral activity against either EV-A71 or EV-D68 at the highest
non-toxic drug concentration (Table 2).

Discussion
To combat COVID-19 pandemic, researchers around the globe are racing to come up with effective
countermeasures. Promising progress has been made in developing vaccines and antiviral drugs.
Antivirals are necessary complements of vaccines and are needs for post-infection treatment. Among the
viral proteins under investigation as drug targets for SARS-CoV-2, the viral RdRp is the most extensively
studied, which was followed by the viral Mpro.35 Antiviral drug discovery targeting Mpro started with the
initial efforts of developing of inhibitors against rhinovirus 3C protease (3Cpro). The rhinovirus 3Cpro, the
enterovirus 3Cpro, human norovirus 3CL protease, and the coronavirus 3CL protease (Mpro) all share the
same substrate preference for the glutamate at the P1 position, suggesting that 3Cpro or 3CLpro inhibitors
are promising drug candidates for broad-spectrum antivirals. Over the past few decades, significant

progress has been made in designing 3Cpro or 3CLpro inhibitors. Rupintrivir (AG7088) and AG7404 are
prominent examples of human rhinovirus 3Cpro inhibitors that have been evaluated in clinical trials for the
treatment of rhinovirus infection. For coronaviruses, GC376 is one of the most advanced lead compounds.
It showed broad-spectrum in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and in vivo
antiviral activity in cats infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus.36-37 Given the sequence similarity
between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Mpro, it became apparent that existing 3Cpro or 3CLpro inhibitors
might be active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Indeed, the most potent Mpro inhibitors reported so far such as
N3, 13a, 13b, and GC376 all contain the pyrrolidone substitution in the P1 position, with variations in the
reactive warhead and P2, P3, and P4 substitutions.11-14 Interestingly, six compounds ebselen, disulfiram,
carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin, which share no structural similarity with GC376, were
claimed as novel SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.12 MS/MS analysis revealed that ebselen, PX-12, and
carmofur were able to covalently modify the catalytic cysteine C145 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.12
In line with these documented polypharmacology of ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib,
and shikonin, we are interested in validating these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition. Our
enzymatic assay results showed that the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by these six compounds is
dependent on the reducing reagent DTT. In the absence of DTT, all six compounds ebselen, disulfiram,
carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin not only showed potent inhibition against Mpro, but also two
related viral proteases the EV-A71 and EV-D68 3Cpro, as well as three unrelated viral proteases the
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, the EV-A71 and EV-D68 2Apro (Fig. 2). However, upon addition of 4 mM DTT, the
broad-spectrum enzymatic inhibition of these compounds was largely diminished, except carmofur and
tideglusib, which had weak inhibition against Mpro and PLpro with IC50 values of 28.2 and 30.4 µM,
respectively (Fig. 2; Table 1). In line with the enzymatic assay results, thermal shift binding assay and
native MS assay showed that ebselen, disulfiram, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin did not bind to Mpro in
the presence of DTT, while carmofur could still bind to Mpro with the addition of DTT (Figs. 4-5). These
results suggest that the inhibition of Mpro by carmofur has certain specificity, although the potency is
relatively weak. In contrast, the inhibitory effect and binding of control compounds GC376 against Mpro,

EV-A71 and EV-D68 3Cpro, GRL0618 against PLpro, and telaprevir against EV-A71 and EV-D68 2Apro
were not affected by the addition of DTT (Figs. 2, 4, 5). MD simulations provided additional evidence
showing that the drug-bound Mpro complex is more stable for specific inhibitor GC376 than promiscious
compounds ebselen and carmofur (Fig. 6). Furthermore, it is generally assumed that for specific inhibitors,
the enzymatic inhibition potency IC50 value could be used to predict the cellular antiviral activity.
However, despite their apparent inhibition of the EV-A71 and EV-D68 2Apro and 3Cpro in the absence of
DTT (Table 1), none of the six compounds ebselen, disulfiram, PX-12, tideglusib, and shikonin showed
cellular antiviral activity against EV-A71 and EV-D68 in the CPE assay (Table 2). Therefore, caution
should be taken when interpreting the enzymatic assay inhibition IC50 values of cysteine proteases
obtained in the absence of reducing reagent such as DTT. In the absence of DTT, the apparent inhibition
might be due to either alkylation or oxidation of the cysteine residue by reactive compounds. To rule out
such non-specific effect, reducing reagents such as DTT, β-ME, or GSH should be added to the enzymatic
buffer. Specific cysteine protease inhibitors should not show significant IC50 shift upon addition of
reducing reagent. Moreover, counter screening against unrelated cysteine proteases should also be
performed as a secondary assay to confirm the specificity.

in its reaction buffer in 96-well plate, and then the reaction was initiated by adding FRET substrate
(SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and PLpro substrates at 10 µM; and EV-A71 and EV-D68 substrates at 20 µM),
the reaction was monitored for 2h, and the initial velocity was calculated using the data from the

The thermal shift binding assay (TSA). The thermal shift binding assay (TSA) was carried out using a
Thermal Fisher QuantStudioTM 5 Real-Time PCR System as described previously.32-33 Briefly, 3 µM
protease in its enzymatic reaction buffer (see the above Enzymatic assays section for the reaction buffer
components) in the presence of 4 mM DTT or in the absence of DTT, was incubated with testing
compounds at 30 °C for 30 min in 96-well PCR plate. 1X SYPRO orange dye was added and
fluorescence of the well was monitored under a temperature gradient range from 20 °C to 90 °C with
0.05 °C/s incremental step. The melting temperature (Tm) was calculated as the mid-log of the transition
phase from the native to the denatured protein using a Boltzmann model (Protein Thermal Shift Software
v1.3).

Native Mass Spectrometry. The native MS binding assay of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was performed using
previously described methods.11 Briefly, purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was buffer exchanged into 0.2 M
ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) at a protein concentration of 6 μM. Each of the ligands tested (GC376,

µM, or 40 µM. For the ligand binding studies containing dithiothreitol (DTT), a 40 mM stock of DTT
was dissolved in water. A final concentration of 4 mM DTT was added to each of those samples. For the
ligand binding studies without DTT added, an equal volume of nanopore water was added to the samples
in place of DTT. The final concentration of protein in each of the samples was 4.9 μM. Each sample
contained 4.5 μL of protein, 0.5 μL of ligand, and 0.5 μL of DTT or water. The samples were mixed and
incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to analysis.
Native mass spectrometry (MS) was performed as previously described using Q-Exactive HF
quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer with the Ultra-High Mass Range (UHMR) research modifications
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). All of the samples were ionized in positive ion mode using 0.9 kV capillary
voltage with the temperature set to 200 °C. The resolution of the instrument was set to 15,000 for all
samples except for samples containing the compound Jun8-38-3, for which the resolution was set to
30,000. The trapping gas pressure within the instrument was set to 3. 50 V of source fragmentation was
applied for each of the samples to aid in desolvation of the sample. All samples were analyzed between a
500-15,000 m/z range. All of the data were deconvolved and analyzed using UniDec.39

Cytopathic Effect Assay (CPE). The EC50 and CC50 values for the protease inhibitors investigated in this
study were measured using RD cells as described previously.32 Briefly, RD cells were seeded and grown
overnight to ~90% confluence in 96-well plate at 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator. For EV-D68 virus infection,
cells were washed with PBS saline and infected with virus diluted in DMEM medium with 2% FBS and
30 mM MgCl2. Viruses were incubated with cells for 1 hr at 33 °C followed by addition of various
concentrations of testing protease inhibitors in DMEM medium with 30 mM MgCl2. For EV-A71 virus
infection, the procedures are identical to those for EV-D68 virus, except that 30 mM MgCl2 was omitted
in all the media and viruses were infected and incubated at 37 °C instead of 33 °C. 3 days after infection,
cells were stained with 66 µg/mL of neutral red dye for 2 hr and neutral red uptake was measured at
absorbance at 540 nM. The CC50 was measured similarly but in the absence of viral infection.
