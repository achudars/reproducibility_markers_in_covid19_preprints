ABSTRACT
As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, new SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially dangerous features have been identified by
the scientific community. Variant B.1.1.7 lineage clade GR from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) was
first detected in the UK, and it appears to possess an increased transmissibility. At the same time, South African authorities
reported variant B.1.351, that shares several mutations with B.1.1.7, and might also present high transmissibility. Even more
recently, a variant labeled P.1 with 17 non-synonymous mutations was detected in Brazil. In such a situation, it is paramount to
rapidly develop specific molecular tests to uniquely identify, contain, and study new variants. Using a completely automated
pipeline built around deep learning techniques, we design primer sets specific to variant B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, respectively.
Starting from sequences openly available in the GISAID repository, our pipeline was able to deliver the primer sets in just under
16 hours for each case study. In-silico tests show that the sequences in the primer sets present high accuracy and do not
appear in samples from different viruses, nor in other coronaviruses or SARS-CoV-2 variants. The presented methodology can
be exploited to swiftly obtain primer sets for each independent new variant, that can later be a part of a multiplexed approach
for the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, since our approach delivers primers able to differentiate between
variants, it can be used as a second step of a diagnosis in cases already positive to COVID-19, to identify individuals carrying
variants with potentially threatening features.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 mutates with an average evolutionary rate of 10−4 nucleotide substitutions per site each year1 . As the pandemic
of SARS-CoV-2 continues to affects the planet, researchers and public health officials around the world constantly monitor the
virus for acquired mutations that may lead to higher threat for developing COVID-19.
On December 14, 2020, Public Health authorities in England reported a new SARS-CoV-2 variant referred to as Variant
Under Investigation (VUI-202012/01)2–4 , which belongs to the B.1.1.7 lineage clade GR from GISAID (Global Initiative
on Sharing All Influenza Data)2, 5, 6 , Nextstrain clade 20I/501Y.V17 . This variant presents 14 non-synonymous mutations, 6
synonymous mutations, and 3 deletions. The multiple mutations present in the viral RNA encoding for the spike protein (S)
are of most concern, such as the deletion 469-70 (421765-21770), deletion 4144 (421991-21993), N501Y (A23063T),
A570D (C23271A), P681H (C23604A), D614G (A23403G), T716I (C23709T), S982A (T24506G), D1118H (G24914C)3, 6 .
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutation N501Y alters the protein interactions involved in receptor binding domain. The N501Y
mutation has been shown to enhance affinity with the host cells ACE2 receptor6, 8 and to be more infectious in mice9 . The
mutation P681H is situated in key residues of the S protein needed for viral transmition and viral entry in lung cells6, 10 . Even

if the clinical outcomes and additive effects of the mutations present on the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant are still unknown,
its rate of transmission has been estimated to be 56%-70% higher, and its reproductive number (Rt) seems to be up to 0.4
higher2, 11 . The presence of the B.1.1.7 variant has been rapidly increasing in the UK6 , and has now been identified in other 36
countries around the world12 .
In parallel, on December 18, 2020, South African authorities reported a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that has been rapidly
spreading across 3 of their provinces and displacing other variants: this variant was named 501Y.V2, also known as B.1.351
lineage, or 20H/501Y.V2 Nextrain clade4, 7, 13 . The B.1.351 variant harbours 19 mutations, with 9 of them situated in the Spike
protein: mutations N501Y (A23063T), E484K (G23012A), and K417N (G22813T) are at key residues in the RBD domain of S
protein, L18F (*), D80A (A21801C), and D215G (*) are in the N-terminal domain, A701V (C23664T) in loop 2, and D614G
(A23403G)13 . Although the B.1.351 variant also has the N501Y mutation in the Spike protein, similarly to the B.1.1.7 variant
in the UK, the B.1.351 variant arose independently in a different SARS-CoV-2 lineage, which forms part of the 20H/501Y.V2
phylogenetic clade in Nextstrain7 . Although uncommon in SARS-CoV-2 variant strains, the E484K mutation has been shown
to moderately enhance binding affinity of the ACE2 receptor8 . Mutation K417N is located in a key contact between the S
protein and the human ACE2 receptor: a previous mutation in this same residue (V404 → K417) contributed to the enhanced
affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor when compared to SARS-CoV14, 15 .Although the rate of transmission of the
B.1.351 variant in South Africa is still unknown, there has been a steady rise of daily cases as well as an increase in excess
deaths per week13 . The B.1.351 variant has now been identified in other 13 countries around the world12 .
Recently, a new variant SARS-CoV-2 from has been identified by scientist and clinicians in Brazil, and named P.1 variant or
20J/501Y.V3 Nextrain clade12, 16, 17 . The P.1 variant harbours 17 unique amino acid changes, three deletions, four synonymous
mutations, and one 4-nucleotide insertion. The P.1 Variant harbours similar mutations in the Spike protein to those find in the
B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant like the N501Y (A23063T), E484K (G23012A), K417N (G22813T) and D614G (A23403G). An
although the rate of infection and mortality of the P.1 variant is still unknown it has been identified in different areas in Brazil
including the Amazonia and Rio de Janeiro, as well internationally in Japan16, 17 .
Apart from B.1.1.7 in England, B.1.351 in South Africa, and P.1 in Brazil, other variants of SARS-CoV-2 carrying mutations
for N501Y have also independently arisen in other parts of Australia and the USA5, 7, 17–19 . The mutations K417N and E484K
found in both B.1.351 and P.1 variants have become of great global concern as they have been show to slightly or significantly
reduce convalescent serum neutralization20, 21 . One reinfection has been linked to P.1 (E484K mutation)22 , raising concerns
about the current monoclonal/polyclonal antibodies used for treating Covid-19 disease as well as the new mRNA vaccines
efficacy in combating the spread of this new SARS-CoV-2 variants23, 24 . Given the rapid spread of this new variants, and their
concerns to the global health, it has become of utmost important for countries to be able to rapidly identify this new variants.
Several diagnostic kits have been proposed and developed to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections. Most kits rely on the
amplification of one or several genes of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)25, 26 . Recently, Public Health England was able to identify the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant through their national
surveillance system which allowed them to noticing the rise in Covid-19 positive cases in South Easter England and through
their the increase in S-gene target failure (negative results) from the otherwise positive target genes (N, ORF1ab) in their three
target gene assay in their RT-PCR diagnostic tests, and the random whole genome sequencing of some of this positive samples2 .
In the case of South Africa, they where able to identify the rise of B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant through their the increase in
positive Covid-19 cases and deaths reports in 3 of their provinces and random whole genome sequencing of positive Covid-19
samples, through their national diagnosis and surveillance system13, 27, 28 . However, to the best of our knowledge, currently no
specific test exists or has been developed to identify the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, or P.1 SARS-CoV-2 variants.
In a previous work29 , we developed a methodology based on deep learning, able to generate a primer set specific to
SARS-CoV-2 in an almost fully automated way. When compared to other primers sets suggested by GISAID, our approach
proved to deliver competitive accuracy and specificity. Our results, both in-silico and with patients, yielded 100% specificity,
and sensitivity similar to widely-used diagnostic qPCR methods. One of the main advantages of the proposed methodology was
its ease of adaptation to different viruses or mutations, given a sufficiently large number of whole viral RNA sequences. In this
work we improved the existing semi-automated methodology, making the pipeline completely automated, and created primer
sets specific for the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, or P.1 in under 16 hours for each case study. The developed primer
sets, tested in-silico, proved not only to be specific, but also to be able to distinguish between the different variants. With this
new result, we believe that our method represents a rapid and effective diagnostic tool, able to support medical experts both
during the current pandemic, as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 may emerge, and possibly during future ones, as still unknown
virus strains might surface.

Results
Variant B.1.1.7
As explained in the Methods section, the first step is to run a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier on the data. This
yields a classification accuracy of 99.66% on the test set. Secondly, from an analysis of the features constructed by the CNN, we
extract 7,127 features, corresponding to 21-bps sequences. Next, we run a state-of-the-art stochastic feature selection algorithm
10 times, to uncover the most meaningful ‘21-bps’ features for the identification of variant B.1.1.7: as shown in Fig. 1a, while
the best result corresponds to a set of 16 ‘21-bps’ features, using only one is enough to obtain over 99% accuracy, a satisfying
outcome for our objective.
These features represent good candidates for forward primers. From the 10 runs, we get 10 different ‘21-bps’ features: 5
out of the 10 point to mutation Q27stop (C27972T), 3 point to mutation I2230T (T6954C), and 2 to a synonymous mutation
(C16176T). Using Primer3Plus we compute a primer set for each of the 10 features, using sequence EPI_ISL_601443 (see
Table 1) as a reference. Only the two ’21-bps’ features that include mutation C16176T are suitable for a forward primer. The
two features are ACC TCA AGG TAT TGG GAA CCT and CAC CTC AAG GTA TTG GGA ACC: it is easy to notice
that the two features are actually part of the same sequence, just displaced by a bps, and therefore generate the same reverse
primer CAT CAC AAC CTG GAG CAT TG with Tm 58.8°C and 60.6°C respectively for the forward primer, and 60.1°C for
the reverse primer.
Using just feature ACC TCA AGG TAT TGG GAA CCT it is possible to build a simple rule-based classifier, that only
checks whether the feature is present in a sample. For further validation, we test the rule-based classifier on the 893 sequences
of the test set (see Fig. 4a), yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98, a result considered as an excellent diagnostic
accuracy (AUC in the 0.9-1.0 range30, 31 ), see Fig. 2a.
We then validate our results on 487 samples of other coronaviruses, obtained from the National Genomics Data Center
(NGDC)32 . Checking for the presence of feature ACC TCA AGG TAT TGG GAA CCT confirms that it is exclusive to
B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 samples, with no appearance in any other coronavirus sample. Further validation on 20,571 samples
belonging to other non-corona viruses from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)33 , shows no appearance
of the sequence in any other virus sample.
For further analysis, we check the presence of the signature mutations T1001I, A1708D, I2230T, N501Y, A570D, P681H,
T716I, S982A, D1118H, Q27stop, R52I, Y73C, and S235F of variant B.1.1.734 . To verify the presence of mutations, we
generate 21-bps sequences, with 10 bps before and after the mutation, and search for their presence: e.g., mutation N501Y
(A23063T) corresponds to sequence CCAACCCACT T ATGGTGTTGG.
Using the generated ‘21-bps’ sequences for the mutations, we can also test them as forward primers using Primer3Plus,
which yields TGA TAT CCT TGC ACG TCT TGA in spike gene (S982A) as the only possible forward primer candidate
(see Table 1). The Tm of the forward primer is 59.3°C and the reverse primer sequence will be GAG GTG CTG ACT GAG
GGA AG with Tm 60.0°C.

Variant B.1.351
As shown in Figure 4b, that summarizes the experiments for this South African variant, the first step is to run a CNN classifier
on the data. This yields a classification accuracy of 99.88% on the test set. Next, we translate the CNN weights into 6,069
features, each representing a 21-bps sequence. As for the B.1.1.7 variant, we run the feature selection algorithm 10 times
(Fig. 1b), which results in only one meaningful feature achieving over 99% accuracy. The 10 runs point to the same mutation,
K417N, with 6 different sequences but only one acceptable as a primer candidate (Table 2). The resulting sequence is CTC
CAG GGC AAA CTG GAA ATA, with Tm 61.3°C , with a reverse primer TGC TAC CGG CCT GAT AGA TT with Tm
59.7°C.
Using sequence CTC CAG GGC AAA CTG GAA ATA, we run a rule-based classifier that simply checks for its presence
in a sample. We test the rule-based classifier on the 926 sequences of the test set (see Fig. 4b), yielding an AUC of 0.99,
again considered as excellent diagnostic accuracy30, 31 , see Fig. 2b. The sequence does not appear in the 487 samples of other
coronavirus obtained from NGDC, nor in the 20,571 samples of other non-corona viruses collected from the NCBI repository.
As we did for the B.1.1.7 variant, we check whether 21-bps sequences containing the signature mutations T265I, K1655N,
K3353R, D80A, K417N, EA84K, N501Y, A701V, Q57H, S171L, P71L, and T205I of variant B.1.35134 could function as a
forward primer. From the Primer3Plus results reported in Table 2, sequence CTG TTT TTC ATA GCG CTT CCA is the
only one that could potentially be a primer candidate (Tm 60.4 °C). This primer is in the Q57H mutation, with reverse primer
AGA GAA AAG GGG CTT CAA GG (Tm 59.8 °C).

Variant P.1
As in the other case studies, the first step is to run a CNN classifier on the data. This yields a classification accuracy of 100%,
which could potentially represent overfitting on the training set, as the scarce number of samples available made it unpractical
to create a separate test set. Next, we translate the CNN weights into 727 features, each representing a 21-bps sequence. We run
the feature selection algorithm 10 times (Fig. 1c), which results in only one meaningful feature achieving 100% accuracy. The
10 runs point to the same sequence, around the synonymous mutation T733C ACT GAT CCT TAT GAA GAC TTT. The
sequence cannot be used as a primer, as the Tm is too low. To compensate, we displaced the sequence two bps to the left and
added a bps to rise the Tm. This procedure gave us sequence GGC ACT GAT CCT TAT GAA GAC T, of size 22 bps and
Tm 57.4 °C, with reverse primer TTC GGA CAA AGT GCA TGA AG, with Tm 60.0 °C.
Since we miss a test set for this variant, again due to the few P.1 sequences available, we cannot compute a ROC curve like

in the other cases. However, we can validate our results by verifying that the sequence does not appear in the 487 samples of
other coronavirus obtained from NGDC, nor in the 20,571 from other non-corona viruses collected from the NCBI repository.
As for the other variants, we check whether ‘21-bps’ sequences containing signature mutations S1188L, K1795Q, L18F,
T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, EA84K, N501Y, H655Y, T1027I, E92K, and P80R of variant P.116 could function
as a forward primers. We put mutation T20N and L18F into the same ‘21-bps’ sequence, given their proximity. From the
Primer3Plus results reported in Table 3, 3 of the generated sequences could be primers candidates.

Discussion
The two primer sets generated for the B.1.1.7 variant, either by deep learning or by using sequences around known mutations,
show almost the same accuracy and similar specificity: the frequency of appearance of the mutation-based primer is better by
0.05%, and both of them do not appear in other SARS-CoV-2 variants, see Table 4. In contrast, the primer set generated with
deep learning for the B.1.351 variant is clearly more specific (0.04%), than the mutation-based primer set (21.84%) using the
frequency of appearance in other variants. Interestingly, by analyzing the three samples representing the 0.04% error, we notice
that all three of them are from South Africa, and they are labeled as B.1, B.1, B.1.302 in GISAID, which could potentially
indicate a labeling error. Similarly, the generated forward primer for B.1.1.7 variant appears in 2,007 of 2,104 sequences, with a
frequency of 95.39%. Nevertheless, a further analysis shows that only 2,014 of the sequences labeled as B.1.1.7 present 5 or
more of the 7 studied mutations, which could point to an error in the annotation of the variant inside the GISAID dataset, or
several extra mutations in the generated 21-bps sequences. If we consider as proper B.1.1.7 variants only sequences that show
5 or more of the mutations, then our primer correctly identifies 2,095 out of 2,104 samples, for a final 99.57% accuracy. In
the case of the P.1 variant, the deep learning generated primer appeared in one B.1.1.7 sample. In addition, we generated 3
mutation-based primers, but given the the frequency of appearance of the Mut-1 BR R primer (82.14%) and that 9 sequences
from other variants were detected by the Mut-2 BR F, the best primer set appears to be the one that uses mutation P80R Mut-3
BR. It is important to remark that this last case study was tackled using just the 28 P.1 sequences currently available: as more
data related to this variant becomes accessible, we will be able to improve and select the best primer pair. The proposed forward
and reverse primers for all the three variants are summarized in Table 5.

(P.1) variants in B.1.1.7 sequences (2,104), B.1.351 sequences (337), P.1 sequences (28) and sequences of other variants
(6,808). The candidate primers generated with deep learning are labeled with Deep, while the ones based on the mutations are
labeled with Mut.

A wide variety of diagnostic tests have been used by high-throughput national testing systems around the world, to monitor
the SARS-CoV-2 infection25 . The arising prevalence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 has
become of great concern, as most RT-PCR tests to date are not be able to distinguish these new variants, not being designed for
such a purpose. Therefore, public health officials most rely on their current testing systems and whole viral RNA sequencing
results to draw conclusions on the prevalence of new variants in their territories. An example of such case has been seen in the
UK, where the increase of the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant infection in their population was identified only through an increase
in the S-gene target failure in their three target gene assay (N+, ORF1ab+, S-), coupled with sequencing of the virus and
RT-PCR amplicons products2 . Researchers believe that the S-gene target failure occurs due to the failure of one of the RT-PCR
probes to bind, as a result of the 469-70 deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, present in B.1.1.72 . This 469-70 deletion,
which affects its N-terminal domain, has been occurring in several different SARS-CoV-2 variants around the world7, 36 and has
been associated with other spike protein receptor binding domain changes6 . Due to the likeliness of mutations in the S-gene,
assays relying solely on its detection are not recommended, and a multiplex approach is required25, 26, 37 . This is consistent with
other existing primer designs like CoV2R-3 in the S-gene38 , that will also yield negative results for the B.1.1.7 variant, as the
reverse primer sequence is in the region of mutation P681H. A more in-depth analysis of S-dropout positive results can be
found in Kidd et al.39 .

Given the concern for the increase in prevalence of the new variants SARS-CoV2 B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, and their
possible clinical implication in the ongoing pandemic, diagnosing and monitoring the prevalence of such variants in the general
population will be of critical importance to help fight the pandemic and develop new policies. In this work, we propose possible
primer sets that can be used to specifically identify the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and possibly P.1 SARS-CoV2 variants. We believe that
all the proposed primer sets can be employed in a multiplexed approach in the initial diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, or used
as a second step of diagnosis in cases already verified positive to SARS-CoV-2, to identify individuals carrying the B.1.1.7,
B.1.351, or P.1 variant. In this way, health authorities could better evaluate the medical outcomes of this patients, and adapt or
inform new policies that could help curve the rise of variants of interest. Although the proposed primer sets delivered by our
automated methodology will still require laboratory testing to be validated, our deep learning design can enable the timely,
rapid, and low-cost operations needed for the design of new primer sets to accurately diagnose new emerging SARS-CoV-2
variants and other infectious diseases.

Data and Methods
Data
Variant B.1.1.7

From the GISAID repository we downloaded 10,712 SARS-CoV-2 sequences on December 23, 2020. After removing repeated
sequences, we obtained a total of 2,104 sequences labeled as B.1.1.7, and 6,819 sequences from other variants, for a total of
8,923 samples. B.1.1.7 variant samples were assigned label 1, and the rest were assigned label 0 for the CNN training. The
samples were divided in a training set of 8,030 samples (90%), and a test set of 893 samples (10%), using a stratified division,
so that both training and test set retain the same proportion of classes. The 8,923 SARS-CoV-2 samples downloaded from the
GISAID repository show 278 variants besides B.1.1.7.
Variant B.1.351

From the GISAID repository, we downloaded 326 sequences of the B.1.351 variant on January 7, 2021. We added the 326
sequences to the 8,923-sample dataset from the B.1.1.7 experiment, obtaining a total of 9,249 sequences, where we assigned
the label 1 for sequences belonging to variant B.1.351, and 0 to the rest of the samples. Next, we divided the data so that 293
B.1.351 sequences ended up in the training set (8,323), and 33 in the test set (926 sequences total), using again a stratified
division.
Variant P.1

From the GISAID repository, we downloaded 28 non-repeated sequences of the P.1 variant on January 19, 2021. We added the
28 sequences to the 8,323 sequences of several other variants, including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, for a total of 8,351 sequences. We
assigned label 1 to sequences belonging to variant P.1, and 0 to the rest of the samples. For this case, given the few P.1 samples
available, all the available samples are used for training, with no separate test set.
Methods
Following the procedure described in Lopez et al.29 , there are 4 steps for the automated design of a specific primer for a virus:
(i) run a CNN for the classification of the target virus against other strains, (ii) translate the CNN weights into 21-bps features,

(iii) perform feature selection to identify the most promising features, and (iv) carry out a primer simulation with Primer3Plus35
for the features uncovered in the previous step. While in29 the proposed pipeline was only partially automatic, and still required
human interventions between steps, in this work all steps have been automatized, and the whole pipeline has been run with no
human interaction. The experiments, from downloading the sequences to the final in-silico testing of the primers, take around
16 hours of computational time on a standard end-user laptop, for each variant considered.
In a first step, we train a convolution neural network (CNN) using the training and testing sequences obtained from GISAID.
The architecture of the network is shown in Fig 3, and is the same as the one previously reported in29 . Next, if the classification
accuracy of the CNN is satisfying (> 99%), using a subset of the training sequences we translate the CNN weights into ‘21-bps’
features, necessary to differentiate between the targeted variant samples and all the others. The length of the features is set
as 21 bps, as a normal length for primers to be used in PCR tests is usually 18-22 bps. Then, we apply recursive ensemble
feature selection (REFS)40, 41 to obtain a reduced set of the most meaningful features that separate the two classes. Finally, we
simulate the outcome of treating the most promising features obtained in the previous step as primers, using Primer3Plus35 in
the canonical sequences EPI_ISL_601443 for B.1.1.72 , EPI_ISL_678597 for B.1.351 and EPI_ISL_804814 for P.116 .

For further in-silico analysis, the resulting ‘21-bps’ sequences are compared against 487 sequences of other coronaviruses
from the NGDC repository, to check if our generated primers are specific enough to SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 in the supplementary
material). In addition, we used data from NCBI with 20,571 viral samples from other taxa, for a total of more than 584 other
viruses (not considering strains and isolates). The whole procedure is summarized in Fig. 2.
