Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (​ACE2​) has been identified as a critical receptor for severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This has led to extensive speculation
on the role of ​ACE2 in disease severity, and in particular, whether variation in its expression can
explain higher mortality in older individuals. We examine this question in mouse lung and show
that 24-month old mice have significantly reduced ​ACE2 mRNA expression relative to 3-month
old mice. The differences appear to be localized to ciliated cells.
Introduction
The severity of illness resulting from infection with
SARS-CoV-2 virus​1 is strongly correlated with age​2​.
There has been much speculation about the
mechanisms underlying this strong association, with
one hypothesis being that age-related changes in
ACE2​, a crucial receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to
enter
cells​3​,
affect
disease
susceptibility​4​.
Nevertheless, there has been little data on the age
dependence of ​ACE2 expression in humans, with the
exception of GTEx data, which is limited in the age
range to adults​5​.
To better assess the relationship between age and
ACE2 expression, we examined single-cell RNA-seq
data from eight 3-month old and seven 24-month old
mouse lungs​6 in order to identify cell-type specific
age-related differences, if any, in ​ACE2 mRNA
expression. Single-cell RNA-seq can determine
whether bulk shifts in gene expression are due to
changes in cell-type abundances, or changes in gene
expression within specific cell types​7​. We find that
both cell-type abundance shifts, as well as ​ACE2
mRNA changes in specific cell types, contribute to a
decrease in ​ACE2 ​mRNA with age. We corroborate
our findings with bulk RNA-seq analysis and ​ACE2
protein measurement in rat lungs​8​.

Results
To examine mRNA abundance of ​ACE2 in young and
old mice lungs, we began by uniformly processing​9,10
all RNA-seq from GSE12487​6 (see Methods),
followed by computation of common coordinates for
the 3-month and 24-month old mice single-cell
RNA-seq using scVI​11 (Figure 1a, Methods).
Consistent with previous findings​12​, we find that
ACE2 is not prevalent in the lung, with the exception
of Goblet/Club and ciliated cells (Supp. Fig. 1). In
cells where ​ACE2 ​mRNA molecules are identified,
the average copy number is 1.19. We, therefore,
measured the expression level of ​ACE2 ​by the
proportion of cells with at least one copy (Methods).
In a comparison of the 3-month old and 24-month old
mice, we found significantly fewer cells with ​ACE2
expression in the 24-month old mice (2.1 fold
reduction, p = 0.0375, Figure 1b). We corroborated
this result with an analysis of three bulk RNA-seq
samples from 3-month old mice and three bulk
RNA-seq samples from 22-month old mice (1.5 fold
reduction, p = 0.0163, Supp. Fig. 2). This reduction in
ACE2 m
​ RNA expression is also seen in an analysis
of FACS sorted alveolar macrophage bulk RNA-seq
samples (2.7 fold reduction, p = 0.3076, Supp. Fig 3).
These results are consistent with a previously

not contradict this finding. We note that results in
rodents may not necessarily translate to humans.

The decrease in ​ACE2 mRNA expression with age in
lungs is likely due to two underlying phenomena: a
reduction of ​ACE2 mRNA in ciliated cells, and a shift
in ciliated cell abundance with age (Figure 1c, Supp.
Fig 4). The latter result is statistically significant and
corroborated in an analysis of FACS sorted cells​6​.

Methods
All methods and code to generate the results in this
manuscript can be found in the python notebooks at

SARS-CoV-2 uses the serine protease ​TMPRSS2 for
Spike protein priming, so we repeated our analyses
for ​TMPRSS2.​ We found no significant changes in
mRNA expression between 3-month and 24-month
old mice (Supp. Figs. 5-7).
Discussion
Our results show a decrease in ​ACE2 mRNA
expression between young and old mice and
contradict recent claims by others​13​. To understand
the discrepancies in results, we examined differences
in data or methodology that could lead to
contradictory results (Supp. Table 1). We conclude
that there is strong evidence in support of a decrease
in ​ACE2 ​mRNA between young and old mice, and
that other currently available RNA-seq datasets do
