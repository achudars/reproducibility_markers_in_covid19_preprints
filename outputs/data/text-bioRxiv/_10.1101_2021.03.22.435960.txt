Abstract

25

The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic

26

necessitates the fast development of vaccines as the primary control option. Recently, viral

27

mutants termed “variants of concern” (VOC) have emerged with the potential to escape host

28

immunity. VOC B.1.351 was first discovered in South Africa in late 2020, and causes global

29

concern due to poor neutralization with propensity to evade preexisting immunity from

30

ancestral strains. We tested the efficacy of a spike encoding mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against

31

the ancestral strain BavPat1 and the novel VOC B.1.351 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse

32

model. Naive mice and mice immunized with formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation

33

were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice developed elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-

34

specific antibody as well as neutralization titers against the ancestral strain BavPat1.

35

Neutralization titers against VOC B.1.351 were readily detectable but significantly reduced

36

compared to BavPat1. VOC B.1.351-infected control animals experienced a delayed course of

37

disease, yet nearly all SARS-CoV-2 challenged naïve mice succumbed with virus dissemination

38

and high viral loads. CVnCoV vaccine completely protected the animals from disease and

39

mortality caused by either viral strain. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in oral swabs,

40

lung, or brain in these groups. Only partial protection was observed in mice receiving the

41

formalin-inactivated virus preparation. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to

42

the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV shows complete disease protection against the novel

43

VOC B.1.351 in our studies.

Introduction

45

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely affects human health and societies worldwide.

46

It has accounted for more than 116 million morbidities and 2.5 million fatalities by early March

47

2021 (WHO, https://covid19.who.int). The responsible pathogen, severe acute respiratory

48

syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread globally despite stringent

49

intervention strategies (1). To control pandemic spread and disease, vaccination is considered

50

the most important and effective control measure (2). Several vaccines based on mRNA

51

technology or viral vectors are now authorized for emergency use and further products are in

52

final licensing phases (3). SARS-CoV-2 underwent adaptive mutations early during the

53

pandemic, with the D614G variant becoming globally dominant at the beginning of 2020 (4-6).

54

Viral evolution is a highly dynamic process that results in emergence of multiple,

55

geographically distinct new variants, first identified in the UK (B1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351)

56

and Brazil (B.1.1.28; P1) (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-risk-

57

assessment-variants-vaccine-fourteenth-update-february-2021). These “variants of concern

58

(VOC)” acquired numerous mutations, particularly in the spike protein encoding gene (S), most

59

frequently within the S1 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) (7-9). These mutations confer

60

higher binding affinities and allow some VOC to evade pre-existing immunity (10), resulting

61

in increased transmissibility, including epidemiologic scenarios where “herd immunity” was

62

expected (11). Whereas variant B.1.1.7 might still be efficiently neutralized by vaccination-

63

elicited antibodies despite the RBD mutations (12-14), variant B.1.351 showed a remarkable

64

resistance to sera from vaccinated, as well as from convalescent individuals (15-18). VOCs that

65

evade from efficient cross-neutralization may evolve into dominant strains and necessitate

66

vaccine efficacy re-assessment. While indications for cross neutralization exist, e.g. by sera

67

from individuals vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines (13, 19), in vivo data from

68

experimental immunization/challenge studies in standardized animal models are pending. In a

69

parallel approach, we investigated the efficacy of mRNA vaccine CVnCoV against SARS-

Results

74

Strong antibody responses in mRNA-vaccinated mice

75

We used the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model (21) to determine the protective efficacy of

76

a spike-protein encoding mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 B-

77

lineage strain BavPat1 that closely matches the mRNA encoded S protein, and the heterologous

78

VOC B.1.351 NW-RKI-I-0028. For immunization, either 8µg of the CVnCoV vaccine (22) or

79

20µL of a formalin-inactivated and adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2-preparation (FI-Virus) was

80

administered on days 0 and 28. Mice were challenged 4 weeks after boost vaccination with

81

more than 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 or B.1.351 NW-RKI-I-0028. A sham (NaCl)

82

group served as non-vaccinated control (Fig. S1). Sera from CVnCoV-vaccinated mice

83

collected on days 28 and 55 showed a strong induction of anti-RBD total immunoglobulin (Ig)

84

with a significant increase on day 55 (4 weeks after boost) compared to day 28 (4 weeks after

85

prime). CVnCoV-induced anti-RBD total Ig levels were significantly higher than levels

86

induced by the FI-Virus preparation. There was no significant boost effect with the FI-Virus

87

preparation when comparing anti-RBD levels at day 55 versus day 28 (Fig. 1A). The strong

88

induction of anti-RBD antibodies in the CVnCoV group was reflected by high virus

89

neutralization titers (VNT). Sera from day 55 after immunization with CVnCoV showed a

90

significantly higher neutralizing capacity compared to sera from animals that had received the

91

FI-Virus preparation. Importantly, neutralization of VOC B.1.351 (mean = 525) was less

92

effective compared to BavPat1 (mean = 10,151) for the CVnCoV group, but far exceeded the

93

values recorded for the FI-Virus group (mean ≤ 32) (Fig. 1B). Overall, CVnCoV induced robust

95

and VOC B.1.351 NW-RKI-I-0028 in vitro.

96
97

Complete protection of mRNA-immunized mice from disease and mortality

98

Subsequently, the potential of CVnCoV to protect from SARS-CoV-2 challenge infection was

99

analyzed. Stocks of both challenge viruses were characterized by deep-sequencing

100

demonstrating the characteristic mutations of VOC B.1.351, but no other relevant alterations

101

(Fig. S2, table S2). Immunized K18-hACE2 mice were studied using a high dose-challenge

102

model which induces severe clinical disease resembling COVID-19 in humans (23). In addition,

103

mice develop severe encephalitis specific to this animal model (20). On day 4, animals in the

104

sham group started succumbing to the BavPat1 infection (Fig. 1C). B.1.351 infection led to a

105

delayed onset of severe disease compared to BavPat1, with 20% survival on day 10 after

106

inoculation (Fig. 1D). Thus, K18-hACE2 mice were highly susceptible to both SARS-CoV-2

107

variants. Importantly, vaccination with CVnCoV resulted in complete protection (100%

108

survival) against BavPat1 and B.1.351 with no significant weight loss or disease symptoms

109

throughout the course of the challenge infection (Fig. 1C-D and Fig. S3). In contrast, prior

110

administration of the FI-Virus preparation provided sub-optimal protection against either

111

BavPat1 or B.1.351, resulting in weight loss and signs of distress (Fig.1 and Fig. S3). Some of

112

the FI-virus-immunized animals experienced very early weight loss and disease signs after

113

VOC B.1.351 challenge infection, earlier than sham-groups. In conclusion, survival rates, body

114

weight changes and disease scores revealed complete protection by the CVnCoV vaccine in

115

K18-hACE2 mice against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, including against VOC B.1.351.

118

mRNA-immunization significantly decreased viral RNA loads in selected tissues

119

To investigate whether CVnCoV vaccination prevented productive infection or dissemination

120

of replicating SARS-CoV-2, we took oral swabs on 4 dpi to monitor viral RNA load in saliva.

121

In the sham group, 4/4 and 4/5 samples were positive for viral genome after infection with

122

BavPat1 or VOC B.1.351, respectively (Fig. 2A). FI-Virus administration prior to challenge

123

did not significantly reduce viral genome load in saliva with 40 to 60% of animals showing

124

positive RT-qPCR results on 4 dpi (Fig. 2A). In contrast, after CVnCoV vaccination, no viral

125

genomes were detected in oral swabs of either challenge group. To further explore the

126

prevention of viral replication following challenge, we determined viral load in the upper

127

respiratory tract (URT) (conchae) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT) (trachea, caudal lung

128

and cranial lung), as well as in the central nervous system (brain, cerebellum/cerebrum) (Fig.

129

2B-F) in animals reaching the humane endpoint or at the day of termination (10dpi). Similar to

130

the quantitative RNA load results obtained from the oral swabs, the URT provided a niche for

131

replication in both sham and FI-Virus groups (Fig. 2B). In the CVnCoV-vaccinated group

132

challenged with BavPat1, only 3/10 animals showed low genome copy numbers in the conchae.

133

No animal was positive in the LRT or the brain, indicating complete protection from infection

134

by BavPat1 (Fig. 2C-F). For VOC B.1.351, 6/10 CVnCoV-vaccinated animals exhibited

135

residual viral replication in the conchae, but viral levels were reduced without reaching

136

statistical significance (Fig. 2B). In contrast, CVnCoV prevented any detectable replication of

137

this VOC in the LRT and the brain, with low viral copy numbers close to the limit of detection

138

in the lung of only 2/10 animals, and in the cerebrum for only 1/10 animals (Fig. 2C-F). FI-

139

Virus administration provided partial protection in the LRT in animals challenged with

140

BavPat1, but not with VOC B.1.351, and did not significantly protect against viral replication

141

in the cerebellum or cerebrum regardless of SARS-CoV-2 variant (Fig. 2). Of note, some of the

142

animals receiving the FI-Virus preparation showed viral loads at the level of the sham group in

143

the LRT (Fig. 2).

144

In summary, vaccination with CVnCoV conferred complete protection against lethal challenge

145

with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B BavPat1 and VOC B.1.351 strain NW-RKI-I-0028 in the

146

transgenic K18-hACE2 mouse model. CVnCoV induced robust anti-RBD antibody responses

147

with high neutralizing capacity against both BavPat1 and VOC B.1.351. Furthermore, CVnCoV

148

prevented dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from the inoculation site into other organs and

149

provided a solid protection against an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and a VOC B.1.351 strain.

150
151

Discussion

152

The emergence of new strains with immune escape potential, such as the VOC of the B.1.351

153

lineage that appeared first in South Africa, are of great concern, since all available COVID-19

154

vaccines are based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strains. The B.1.351 variant is of particular

155

interest due to the observed immune-escape features with a reduced neutralization efficacy (10)

156

and reduced protective efficacy reported for a licensed vaccine (24). We therefore tested an

157

mRNA vaccine (CVnCoV) against a standard ancestral SARS-CoV-2 B lineage strain

158

(BavPat1) in comparison to a VOC B.1.351 isolate in a transgenic mouse model.

159

Our data demonstrate that CVnCoV fully protects mice against disease caused by two different

160

SARS-CoV-2 variants. CVnCoV vaccination, but not immunization with FI-Virus, rescued all

161

transgenic mice from lethal infection caused by BavPat1 and VOC B.1.351 isolate NW-RKI-I-

162

0028. The sub-optimal FI-Virus preparation reduced viral replication in the LRT solely after

163

challenge with BavPat1, but showed no significant effect on viral dissemination as well as the

164

viral genome loads in the URT. In contrast, CVnCoV immunization resulted in abundant RBD-

165

specific and neutralizing antibodies, and conferred a complete and robust protection, including

166

from viral replication in the lung and the brain. Only very limited viral replication was observed

167

in the URT of mRNA-vaccinated animals challenged with VOC B.1.351. The relevance to

168

disease transmission of this minimal viral replication in the conchae remains to be established.

169

The reduced neutralizing capacity of sera from CVnCoV-vaccinated transgenic mice against

170

VOC B.1.351, and the insufficient prevention of replication in the conchae, might reflect the

171

currently detected transmission rates of this VOC in human populations previously exposed to

172

the ancestral strain. Nevertheless, our study provides the first evidence for the efficacy of a

173

vaccine to prevent disease and viral dissemination from the site of infection against an emerging

174

SARS-CoV-2 variant in a sensitive, well-established and accepted in vivo model. The very high

175

neutralizing titers against BavPat1 elicited by the mRNA immunization as well as the fold

176

reduction recorded for VOC B.1.351 may be unique to the mouse model employed in this study

177

and require validation in other experimental models.

178

The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 VOC infections remains largely unknown and detailed

179

animal model data are missing. In our study, we observed a delayed course of disease in K18-

180

hACE2 mice infected with a VOC B.1.351 strain, and hypothesize that mutation accumulation

181

might result in a changed in vivo phenotype. Short-term infections performed in hamsters have

182

failed to detect diverging phenotypes in ancestral versus VOC lineages (25), but comparable

183

data sets about the complete course and replication in the upper respiratory tract are still pending

184

for all VOCs in other animal models. These apparently discordant findings call for further

185

pathological and immunological assessments of pathogenicity of emerging lineages.

186

Here we report full protection against a VOC by CVnCoV immunization, associated with high

187

anti-RBD and neutralizing antibodies. Whether antibodies alone were sufficient for the

188

beneficial outcome remains to be further validated. Broad immune responses elicited by

189

vaccines, including cellular responses in addition to neutralizing antibodies, antibody

190

dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC), or antibody-mediated innate immune effector functions, could

191

help explain the protection. Potent T cell immunity could ensure the success of an immunization

192

when antibodies decline. CVnCoV vaccination was previously shown to induce Th1 immunity

193

and trigger S-specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice (22). Re-challenge studies in non-human

194

primates confirmed a role for CD8+ T cells in protection (26). Although point mutations in the

195

MHC-I-restricted viral epitopes could subvert CD8+ T cell surveillance (27), the majority of

196

SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes recognized by convalescent individuals or vaccinees immunized

197

with licensed mRNA vaccines, appear unaffected by unique VOC mutations (28). These

198

findings indicate a role of cellular immunity in defense against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we

199

observed protection against disease upon challenge infection with VOC B.1.351 after CVnCoV

200

vaccination, despite reduced virus neutralizing titers. These observations suggest that either

201

complementary immune mechanisms are effective or that residual virus neutralizing titers

202

against B.1.351 are sufficient for in vivo neutralization in this model. In line with this, it has

203

recently been demonstrated in a non-human primate infection model that relatively low

204

neutralizing antibody titers can protect from SARS-CoV-2-related clinical signs (26). The

205

precise contribution of various immune compartments to CVnCoV efficacy requires further

206

evaluation.

207

Our proof-of-principle study demonstrates that an mRNA vaccine can protect hACE2 mice

208

against disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 independent from the lineages or variant SARS-CoV-

209
