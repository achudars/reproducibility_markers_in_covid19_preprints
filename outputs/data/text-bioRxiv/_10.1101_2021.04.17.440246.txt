Abstract

21

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant global morbidity and mortality on a scale

22

similar to the influenza pandemic of 1918. Over the course of the last few months, a number of

23

SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified against which vaccine-induced immune responses may be

24

less effective. These “variants-of-concern” have garnered significant attention in the media, with

25

discussion around their impact on the future of the pandemic and the ability of leading COVID-19

26

vaccines to protect against them effectively. To address concerns about emerging SARS-CoV-2

27

variants affecting vaccine-induced immunity, we investigated the neutralisation of representative

28

‘G614’, ‘501Y.V1’ and ‘501Y.V2’ virus isolates using sera from ferrets that had received prime-boost

doses of the DNA vaccine, INO-4800. Neutralisation titres against G614 and 501Y.V1 were

30

comparable, but titres against the 501Y.V2 variant were approximately 4-fold lower, similar to

31

results reported with other nucleic acid vaccines and supported by in silico biomolecular modelling.

32

The results confirm that the vaccine-induced neutralising antibodies generated by INO-4800 remain

33

effective against current variants-of-concern, albeit with lower neutralisation titres against 501Y.V2

34

similar to other leading nucleic acid-based vaccines.

Introduction

37

With the continuing roll-out of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

38

(SARS-CoV-2), primarily developed against the ancestral ‘D614’ version of the virus1, there is concern

39

that emerging ‘variants-of-concern’ and ‘variants-of-interest’ may have acquired mutations resulting

40

in lower neutralisation by infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies. Neutralising antibodies are a

41

key correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in humans and non-human primates2-4, so the

42

determination of antibody-mediated neutralisation against emerging variants is important when

43

assessing vaccine efficacy. Recent publications have demonstrated that these concerns have some

44

basis, with reduced neutralisation of both the ‘501Y.V1’ variant (also called the ‘UK variant’ or

45

‘B.1.1.7’) and the ‘501Y.V2’ variant (also called the ‘South African variant’ or ‘B.1.351’) by leading

46

mRNA-based vaccines5. Similarly, neutralisation studies using human serum samples from

47

coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients in South Africa reveal significant decreases in

48

neutralisation efficiency against the 501Y.V2 variant6,7.

49
50

We recently investigated the neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 isolates containing either the ‘D614’ or

51

the ‘G614’ variation of the Spike protein, using serum samples from ferrets vaccinated with INO-

52

4800, a leading DNA vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 , demonstrating the D614G mutation

53

was unlikely to affect vaccine-induced antibody-mediated virus neutralisation. Given the interest

54

around the 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V2 variants, we decided to follow up our previous study by comparing

55

neutralisation titres of INO-4800-vaccinated ferret samples against representative SARS-CoV-2

56

isolates. We believe such a study is important because: a) DNA vaccines such as INO-4800 can be

57

rapidly modified similar to mRNA vaccines; b) INO-4800 remains stable at room temperature for an

58

extended period, making it especially suitable for combatting the pandemic in resource-poor and

59

remote settings ; and, c) INO-4800 has a favourable safety and reactogenicity profile in humans, as

60

demonstrated in clinical trials.

Materials and Methods

63

Viruses, vaccine, and cells. Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolates hCoV-19/Australia/VIC31/2020 (VIC31)

64

and hCoV-19/Australia/VIC17990/2020 (VIC17990; 501Y.V1 variant) were provided as Passage 1

65

material by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL), Melbourne, Australia.

66

hCoV-19/South Africa/KRISP-K005325/2020 (501Y.V2.HV001; 501Y.V2 variant) was provided as

67

Passage 3 material from the Africa Health Research Institute, Durban, South Africa. INO-4800 was

68

provided by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, USA, for preclinical testing within the ferret model of

69

COVID-19. This DNA vaccine is a plasmid containing a coding sequence for SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-

72

VIC31 Passage 2, VIC17990 Passage 2, and 501Y.V2.HV001 Passage 4 virus stocks were grown in

73

VeroE6 cells (CCL81; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA). Briefly, VeroE6

74

cells were grown in 150cm2 flasks in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10%

75

heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS), 10mM HEPES, 100U/mL penicillin, 100μg/mL

76

streptomycin, and 250ng/mL amphotericin B (all components from ThermoFisher Scientific,

77

Scoresby, VIC, Australia) until 79-90% confluent. The received SARS-CoV-2 isolates were diluted in

78

DMEM containing 10mM HEPES, 100U/mL penicillin, 100μg/mL streptomycin, and 250ng/mL

79

amphotericin B, but no FBS (DMEM-D). Cells were inoculated with 4mL diluted virus and were

80

incubated for 30min at 37°C/5% CO2 before 40mL DMEM containing 2% FBS, 10mM HEPES,

81

100U/mL penicillin, 100μg/mL streptomycin, and 250ng/mL amphotericin B was added. The flasks

82

were incubated for an additional 48h before supernatant was harvested. ATCC VeroE6 cells were

83

additionally used for virus neutralisation assays (see below).

84
85

Next-Generation Sequencing. Virus stocks were sequenced using a MiniSeq platform (Illumina, Inc;

86

San Diego, CA, USA). In brief, 100 µL cell culture supernatant from the infected Vero E6 cells was

87

combined with 300 µL TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA was purified using a Direct-

88

zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research; Irvine, CA, USA). Purified RNA was further concentrated using

89

an RNA Clean-and-Concentrator kit (Zymo Research), followed by quantification on a DeNovix DS-11

90

FX Fluorometer. RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA, ligated then isothermally

91

amplified using a QIAseq FX single cell RNA library kit (Qiagen). Fragmentation and dual-index library

92

preparation was conducted with an Illumina DNA Prep, Tagmentation Library Preparation kit.

93

Average library size was determined using a Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies; San Diego, CA, USA)

94

and quantified with a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA). Denatured libraries

95

were sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq using a 300-cycle Mid-Output Reagent kit as per the

96

manufacturer’s protocol. Paired-end Fastq reads were trimmed for quality and mapped to the

97

published sequence for the SARS-CoV-2 reference isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (RefSeq: NC_045512.2) using

98

CLC Genomics Workbench version 21. Variations from the reference sequence were determined

99

with the CLC Genomics Workbench Basic Variant Detection tool set at a minimum frequency of

100

equal to or greater than 35%.

101
102

Serum samples. Serum samples used for neutralisation assays were generated and selected with the

103

consent of the sponsor (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), as previously described8.

104

In brief, four male and four female ferrets received two doses of INO-4800 via intramuscular

105

administration of 1 mg plasmid DNA to the caudal thigh muscle, followed by electroporation split

106

across two sites using the CELLECTRA® device. The prime dose was given on day 0 and the boost on

107

day 28. Sera collected on day 35 or day 42 from three male and three female ferrets were chosen at

108

random to allow for sufficient seroconversion, and to ensure that no ferret provided more than one

109

test sample. Two unvaccinated ferret sera were also included as negative control sera, to ensure

110

that there was no non-specific neutralisation of the viruses. Parent vaccine efficacy studies were

111

approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at CSIRO ACDP (Approval Reference: AEC 2004). No

112

additional ethics approval was required to perform neutralisation assays on serum samples collected

113

from the parent study.

114
115

Serum dilution. Each serum sample was diluted 1:20 in DMEM-D (see cell culture methods above) in

116

a deep-well plate on a single occasion, followed by a 2-fold serial dilution in medium across the plate

117

up to 1:20,480. The dilution series for each serum sample was dispensed into triplicate rows of a 96-

118

well plate, for a total volume of 50μL per well and triplicate wells per sample dilution.

119
120

Neutralisation assay. For the serum-containing wells, 50μL virus diluted in medium to contain

121

approximately 100 TCID50 (checked by back-titration) was added to each well. The plates were

122

incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 1h to allow neutralisation complexes to form between the antibodies

123

and the virus. At the end of the incubation, 100μL VeroE6 cells (propagated as outlined above for

124

virus stock generation) were added to each well and the plates returned to the incubator for 4 days.

125

Each well was scored for the presence of viral CPE, readily discernible on Day 4 post-infection, with

126

neutralisation titres assigned to each serum replicate based upon the highest dilution that prevented

127

discernible cytopathic effect.

128
129

Statistical analysis. Mixed effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess differences

130

between SARS-CoV-2 isolates (the fixed effect), with the random effect being the 3 test replicates.

131

For the post hoc analysis to detect significant factor level differences we undertook pairwise

comparisons with Tukey’s adjustment. All analyses were undertaken in R 4.0, using the nlme v. 3.1.

133

package for the mixed effects ANOVA modelling and multcomp v. 1.4 for the post hoc comparisons.

134
135

Molecular modelling. Fully glycosylated models of the Spike protein G614, 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V2

136

variants were built based on ‘6VSB’ protein databank (PDB) structure minus transmembrane

137

domains (residues 1161-1272) and included one ACE2 protein bound to the receptor-binding

138

domain. All models were simulated in aqueous solution (TIP3 water, 310K, 0.15M ions, NVT

139

ensemble, each approximately 725,000 atoms in size) using the software NAMD 2.1411 for 150

140

nanoseconds each. Models were visualized with VMD and Nanome12,13.

samples used previously. We additionally included negative control (unvaccinated) ferret serum

161

samples. Neutralisation titres against VIC31 were similar between this study and the previous one

166

against the three isolates revealed no significant difference in neutralisation of the 501Y.V2 isolate

167

(VIC17990) compared to VIC31, however titres against 501Y.V2 were significantly lower than against

Molecular modelling of the variants shows more cumulative structural changes in 501Y.V2 than

501Y.V1 (Figure 2; Table 1), consistent with observed lower neutralisation titres. The receptor-

183

binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein in the 501Y.V1 variant contains the N501Y mutation,

184

which has been shown to increase binding to the ACE2 receptor15,16, while 501Y.V2 additionally

185

contains the mutations K417N and E484K in the RBD (Figure 2b,c). The E484K mutation, although a

186

moderately conservative change in Grantham Distance, has been shown to be an extremely potent

187

escape mutant, showing resistance to many monoclonal and even polyclonal antibodies . The

188

K417N mutation, also considered a moderate conservative change, appears to increase hydrogen

189

bonding interactions with the ACE2 receptor via ACE2 N-linked glycosylation at asparagine position

190

Asn90 (Supplementary Figure S1). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Spike protein in the 501Y.V1

191

variant contains two deletions at residue positions 69-70 and 144, potentially modulating the Spike

192

protein’s glycosylation arrangements attached at asparagine residues Asn74 and Asn149. More

193

extensive changes to the NTD exist in the 501Y.V2 variant, with a cluster of mutations (within

194

approximately 15Å radius of D80A), including L18F, the moderately radical D80A, the moderately

195

conservative D215G, and a 242-244 deletion (Figure 2d,e). Key implications of these changes within

196

the NTD are: (a) the D80A and D215G mutations in 501Y.V2 have replaced aspartic acid residues

197

which can stabilize salt bridge interactions with the arginine residues Arg78 and Arg214 respectively

198

(Supplementary Figure S2); and (b) the 242-244 deletion has removed the ‘Leu-Ala-Leu’ residues,

199

causing local residue sidechain rearrangement and shortening a solvent exposed loop (residues 245-

200

259), likely altering its antigenic presentation. These combined structural changes in 501Y.V2 could

201

explain our observed reduced inhibition potency relative to the 501Y.V1 and D614G variants.

217

neutralisation titres (and by extension, vaccine-induced protection) observed with the 501Y.V2

218

variant are comparable for leading nucleic acid based COVID-19 vaccines – approximately 4-fold for

219

INO-4800 (Inovio Pharmaceuticals), compared to 6.5-fold for BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) and 8.6-

220

fold for mRNA-1273 (Moderna) – and substantially less than the 86-fold reduction reported for

221

AZD1222 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) . We observed no decrease in neutralisation titre with 501Y.V1

222

versus G614, compared to other leading vaccines, however host-specific effects may play a role . It is

223

encouraging that INO-4800-vaccinated ferret serum maintains neutralisation efficacy against the

224

spectrum of emerging ‘variants-of-concern’ evaluated by this study18; this is consistent with the

225

maintenance of neutralisation of pseudovirus prototypes of SARS-CoV-2 variants with serum

226

samples from human recipients of the INO-4800 vaccine19. Our study indicates that nucleic acid-

227

based vaccines will have an important role to play in this pandemic, in terms of their general ability

228

to maintain neutralisation efficacy and to be modified for ‘vaccine matching’ in the future.

Supplementary Figure 1. Structure of ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding

308

domain of variant 501Y.V2. Modelling suggests the lysine to asparagine mutation, (K417N), may

309

facilitate additional hydrogen bonding to the ACE2 receptor, (Angeotensin-converting enzyme 2), via

310

binding through an N-linked glycoside at position asparagine Asn90 in ACE2. (In this case modelled

311

as Beta-D-GlcNAC (1->4) GlcNAC). The relative position of the other 501Y.V2 mutations in the

312

receptor-binding domain (Tyr501 and Lys484) as also shown.

domain showing a close up of the N-terminal domain region, highlighting the salt bridges between

317

arginine and aspartic acid at positions Arg78-Asp80 and Arg214-Asp215. In the 501Y.V2 variant,

318

aspartic acid 80 is mutated to alanine (D80A) and aspartic acid 215 is mutated to glycine (D215G),

319

losing both salt bridges, altering the relative positions of the arginine residues, as shown in Figure

320

2e). The asparagine N-linked glycosylation attachment point Asn74 is also labelled in the diagram.
