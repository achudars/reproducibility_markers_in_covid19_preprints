Abstract
Three anti-HIV drugs, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir, might have therapeutic
effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, the structure models of
two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases,
coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP),
were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked
to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug
complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce
significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30
suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind
to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the
therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their
inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the
inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may
be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, and
then quickly became a rising global concern since World Health Organization had
declared it as the sixth public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on
30 January 2020. By the time of 14:50 on February 8, 2020, 34638 COVID-19 cases
had been confirmed in China and 723 patients died from it, resulting in a mortality of
2.2%. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel species of non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus
which can spread and distribute in humans and other mammals [1]. Previous studies
have discovered that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a distinct clade from the β-coronavirus
which is associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2]. Shi ZL et al found that SARS-CoV-2 shares
79.5% sequence identity to SARS-related coronavirus and is 96% identical at the
whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [3], which corresponds to that the origin may
be wild animals sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [4]. Recent clinical research
found that dyspnea might occur on the fifth day and acute respiratory distress syndrome
on the eighth day from first symptom of COVID-19 in median, organ dysfunction and
death can also occur in severe COVID-19 cases [5, 6]. However, there is still no specific
treatment for COVID-19. Finding drugs that can fight against SARS-CoV-2 is a top
priority.
The trial fifth edition of diagnosis and treatment guideline of COVID-19 issued by
National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China
(http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) recommends to use Kaletra for treatment. Kaletra, an antiHIV drug which is composed of two protease inhibitors, ritonavir (CAS#: 155213-675) and lopinavir (CAS#: 192725-17-0), might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus
diseases like SARS and MERS [7-10]. However, whether it can inhibit SARS-CoV-2
or treat COVID-19 lacks clinical evidences and randomized clinical trials, and the
safety of its use in COVID-19 patients is unclear. Otherwise, Lanjuan Li, infectious
disease scientist, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, recommended
darunavir (CAS#: 206361-99-1), also an HIV protease inhibitor, as a treatment for
COVID-19. Although the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 has been
verified in vitro, its therapeutic effect on COVID-19 is still unknown. At the same time,
the mechanism of how these drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is also unknown.
As coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, synthesize polyproteins followed by
hydrolyzed to produce their structure and function proteins [11-13], it is suggested that
ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir may block the multiplication cycle of SARS-CoV-2
by inhibiting its proteases. To preliminarily understand the inhibitory effects of the
drugs, in this study, molecular models of the proteases were built by homology
modeling, followed by docking the drugs to the proteases, respectively. In addition, the
dynamic interactions between the drugs and the protease were also simulated to
evaluate the binding effects of the drugs on the proteases.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Homology Modeling of the Proteases

Since there was no gene of protease identified in the ten SARS-CoV-2 genes
directly, the protease-like conserved domains in the orf1ab polyprotein (GenBank:
QHO60603.1) of the virus were analyzed through NCBI Conserved Domain Search
Service (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) [14-17]. The
sequences of the found protease-like domains were then used to build molecular models
by homology modeling through SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [1822]. To evaluate qualities, Verify score, Errat score, Prove score and Ramachandran
plots of the built models were automatically created by Structure Analysis and
Verification server (version 5.0, https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/).
2.2 Molecular Docking of the Drugs
To dock ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir to the proteases, respectively, Discovery
Studio software (version 2.5, Accelrys Software Inc.) was used. While docking, one of
the proteases would be set as receptor, and all its possible docking sites would be found.
A sphere whose radius was 17 units would then be set at the optimal docking site,
followed by semi-flexible docking of unprotonated ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir
to the receptor protease through Dock Ligands (Libdock) module of Discovery Studio
software, respectively. The preliminary docking results would be evaluated by Libdock
scores and intermolecular interactions through Discovery Studio software.
To analyze the structure changes of proteases caused by induced-fit effect after
binding the drugs, Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient Algorithms were used to
minimize the energy of the protease-drug complexes successively through
Minimization module of Discovery Studio software. During calculation, fixed
constraint of the backbone of proteins was used first and removed later.

3. Results
3.1 Molecular Models of the Proteases
By searching the conserved domains of the sequence of orf1ab polyprotein, two
protease-like domains were found. One domain is coronavirus endopeptidase C30
(CEP_C30), located from 3292 to 3569 of the polyprotein sequence; the other domain
is papain like viral protease (PLVP), located from 1564 to 1880 of the sequence. The
sequence of PLVP was directly used for subsequent homology modeling, while the 5
residues at the C-terminal of the sequence of CEP_C30 were deleted before subsequent
homology modeling to minimize disordered structures.
While modeling CEP_C30, 8 models were built according to 8 automatically
found templates. The top-rated model in the 8 models is a homo-dimer with no ligand,
and was selected to represent the structure of CEP_C30. While modeling PLVP, 29
models were built according to 16 automatically found templates. The top-rated model
in the 29 models is a monomer with a zinc ion ligand, and was selected to represent the
structure of PLVP. The structures of the two selected models are available in
Supplemental Files S1 and S2. The detailed information, evaluation scores and
Ramachandran plots of the two models are shown in Figure 1.
3.2 Molecular Docking of the Drugs

The optimal docking site of CEP_C30 is a pocket between its two subunits.
Through docking drugs to this site, 100 poses were found when docking ritonavir, with
the Libdock score of the optimal pose 192.346; 88 poses were found when docking
lopinavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 147.123; and 49 poses were found
when docking darunavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 149.404. The
optimal docking site of PLVP is a pocket in one side of the protein. Through docking
drugs to this site, 4 poses were found when docking ritonavir, with the Libdock score
of the optimal pose 164.153; 3 poses were found when docking lopinavir, with the
Libdock score of the optimal pose 107.137; and 8 poses were found when docking
darunavir, with the Libdock score of the optimal pose 139.543. The interactions
between the proteases and drugs at the optimal poses are shown in Figure 2, and the
structures of the docked protease-drug complexes at the optimal pose before energy
minimization are available in Supplemental Files S3 to S8.
Through energy minimization, all protease-drug complexes had some structure
changes. The differences between before and after energy minimization of proteasedrug complexes are shown in Figure 3, and the structures of protease-drug complexes
after energy minimization are available in Supplemental Files S9 to S14.

4. Discussion
4.1 The Significance of the Molecular Models
In this study, two models of two protease-like domains, CEP_C30 and PLVP, of
orf1ab polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were built. Since these two models were built by
taking highly homologous crystal structures as templates, their qualities are quite
considerable. As it is difficult to obtain the crystal structure of CEP_C30 and PLVP in
a short time, there is great significance to use these reliable structure models to predict
their dynamic interactions with other molecules.
4.2 The Binding Effects of the Drugs
For ritonavir and lopinavir, these two drugs seem more suitable to bind to
CEP_C30 rather than PLVP. Through energy minimization, it is suggested that after
docking ritonavir or lopinavir, CEP_C30 can be induced to change its conformation
significantly to bind the drug tightly. Moreover, ritonavir is more suitable than lopinavir
to bind to CEP_C30. As shown in Figure 2 and 3, there are more interactions between
CEP_C30 and ritonavir, and the binding between them is tighter. On the contrary,
neither ritonavir nor lopinavir seems suitable to bind to PLVP, since the bindings
become less tight after energy minimization.
For darunavir, this drug seems more suitable to bind to PLVP rather than CEP_C30.
Through energy minimization, it is suggested that after docking to PLVP, darunavir can
change its conformation significantly to fit PLVP, whose conformation will also be
induced to slightly change. On the contrary, darunavir seems not suitable to bind to
CEP_C30, since the binding between darunavir and CEP_C30 becomes less tight after
energy minimization.
4.3 The Possible Inhibitory Mechanisms of the Drugs

Since the catalytic mechanisms of CEP_C30 and PLVP domains are both unknown,
it is unable to determine whether ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir are competitive or
non-competitive inhibitors, although these drugs are all peptide analogues and seem to
be competitive.
As the binding of ritonavir and lopinavir might lead to significant conformation
changes of CEP_C30, there is no conclusion whether ritonavir and lopinavir are
competitive or non-competitive, since both competitive and non-competitive inhibitors
may significantly change the conformation of receptor. For darunavir, as it can bind to
PLVP suitably by changing its conformation with slight conformation changes of PLVP,
it is more likely to be a competitive inhibitor of PLVP.
In conclusion, the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 and
other coronavirus disease may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30,
while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARSCoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on
PLVP. However, there are still limitations in this study. As the catalytic mechanisms of
CEP_C30 and PLVP are still unknown, in further studies, it should still be focused on
to figure out these mechanisms and how ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir block these
procedures. The safety and actual effects of these drugs on human body should also be
carried out and verified by randomized clinical control studies further.
