Abstract

44

The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic

45

has created a significant threat to global health. While respiratory aerosols or droplets

46

are considered as the main route of human-to-human transmission, secretions expelled

47

by infected individuals can also contaminate surfaces and objects, potentially creating

48

the risk of fomite-based transmission. Consequently, frequently touched objects such as

49

paper currency and coins have been suspected as a potential transmission vehicle. To

50

assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by banknotes and coins, we examined the

51

stability of SARS-CoV-2 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), as surrogate with lower

52

biosafety restrictions, on these different means of payment and developed a touch

53

transfer method to examine transfer efficiency from contaminated surfaces to skin.

54

Although we observed prolonged virus stability, our results, including a novel touch

55

transfer method, indicate that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via contaminated coins

56

and banknotes is unlikely and requires high viral loads and a timely order of specific

57

events.

1. Introduction

62

The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic

63

has created a significant threat to global health. Since effective treatments and access to

64

vaccines is still limited for the broad population in most countries, diligent attention on

65

transmission-based precautions is essential to limit viral spread. In particular considering

66

the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with possibly greater risk of transmission

67

[1,2]. According to current evidence, SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through

68

respiratory droplets and aerosols exhaled from infected individuals [3]. Respiratory

69

secretions or droplets expelled by infected individuals can potentially contaminate

70

surfaces and objects (fomites) and have been shown to persist on inanimate surfaces for

71

days under controlled laboratory conditions [4,5]. Therefore, a clinically significant risk

72

of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by fomites has been assumed [6–8]. The COVID-19

73

pandemic intensified the decline in the transactional use of cash, partly due to reduced

74

consumer spending, but also due to concerns about the risk of banknotes transmitting the

75

virus. This was observed for either sides, the retailers’ as well as the customers [9].

76

Indeed, frequently touched objects such as banknotes and coins have been suspected to

77

serve as transmission vehicle of various pathogenic bacteria, parasites, fungi and viruses

78

including SARS-CoV-2 [10,11]. However, the conditions presented in various

79

experimental studies frequently do not resemble real-life scenarios (e.g. large virus

80

inoculums, small surface area) and thereby potentially exaggerating the risk of

81

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fomites [12,13]. Although different viruses are readily

82

exchanged between skin and surfaces, the fraction of virus transferred is dependent on

83

multiple factors including virus species and surface material [14]. The efficiency of

84

pathogen transfer from the fomite to hands is an important parameter to model its

85

potential for transmission and to implement effective hygiene measures, while avoiding

86

unnecessary measures [15]. However, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces to skin

87

has not been analyzed systematically. Here, we examined the stability of SARS-CoV-2

88

and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as surrogate on different means of payment. We further

89

implemented a new protocol to study the touch transfer efficiency between fomites and

90

skin. Importantly, we only observed a transfer between fomites and skin using a large

91

initial virus titer sample (106 infectious virus particles) on the tested surfaces, while

92

lower initial virus titer stocks (104 infectious virus particles) were not effectively

93

transferred.

94

Overall, our results point to a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by coins and

95

banknotes and the tendency to prefer contactless payment over cash during the pandemic

96

seems unnecessary.

Materials and methods

99
100

Preparation of test virus suspension

101

For preparation of SARS-CoV-2 test virus suspension, Vero E6 cells were seeded in a

102

75 cm2 flasks at 2×106 cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM,

103

supplemented with 10 % (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 % non-essential amino acids,

104

100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM L-Glutamine). The monolayer

105

was inoculated with the hCoV-19/Germany/BY-Bochum-1/2020 (GISAID accession

106

ID: EPI_ISL_1118929). After 3 days and upon visible cytopathic effect the supernatant

107

was harvested by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature, aliquoted

108

and stored at -80 °C until further usage.

109

For preparation of BCoV virus suspension, U373 cells were cultivated in a 75 cm2 flask

110

with in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM) supplemented with L-glutamine,

111

non-essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate and 10 % FCS. Before virus infection,

112

cells were washed two times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), incubated for 3 h

113

with serum-free EMEM and were washed once with EMEM supplemented with trypsin.

114

For virus production, BCoV strain L9 (NCBI: txid11130) was added to the prepared

115

monolayer. After an incubation period of 24 to 48 hours cells were lysed by a rapid

116

freeze/thaw cycle followed by a low speed centrifugation in order to sediment cell debris.

117

After aliquoting of the supernatant, test virus suspension was stored at -80 °C. Nine

118

volumes of test virus suspension were mixed with one volume of interfering substance

119

solution [0.3 g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS according to EN 16777, section

120

5.2.2.8]. The tests were performed with two different virus concentrations, i.e. a titer of

121

approximately 104 50% tissue culture infectious dose per milliliter (TCID50/mL) and a

122

titer of 106 TCID50/mL.

123
124

Preparation of specimens

125

Prior to use regular 5-, 10-cent and 1-euro coins were dipped in a bath containing 70 %

126

(v/v) ethanol for 5 min. The 10- and 50-euro banknotes (provided by the European

127

Central Bank) and PVC plates [with PUR (polyurethane) surface coating 20 x 50 cm

128

(VAH e.V.), precleaned with 70.0 % propan-1-ol or ethanol] were cut into pieces of 2 x

129

2 cm. Banknotes were UV irradiated before the tests. Stainless steel discs (2 cm diameter

130

discs) with Grade 2 B finish on both sides (article no. 4174-3000, GK Formblech GmbH,

131

Berlin, Germany) served as reference control. Prior to use the discs were decontaminated

132

with 5 % (v/v) Decon 90 for 60 minutes and 70 % (v/v) propan-2-ol for 15 min.

133

Subsequently, the discs were rinsed with distilled water sterilized by autoclaving (steam

134

sterilization).

135
136

Inactivation assays and controls

137

For stability testing, specimens were placed aseptically in a Petri dish and inoculated

138

with 50 μL of the virus inoculum [5 × 10 µL drops, i.e. four in every corner and one in

139

the middle of the square (Fig. 3)]. After visible drying of the inoculum, the petri dishes

140

were closed and the specimens were incubated until the end of the appropriate exposure

141

time (up to 7 days). After the respective time, the specimens were transferred to 2 mL

142

cell culture medium (without FCS) in a 25 mL container and vortexed for 60 seconds to

143

resuspend the virus. Directly after elution, series of ten-fold dilutions of the eluate in ice-

144

cold maintenance medium were prepared and inoculated on cell culture.

8

145

Fifteen and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 7, and 24 hours and 2, 3, 5 and 7 days were chosen as

146

application times. Eluates were retained after appropriate drying times and residual

147

infectivity was determined.

148

The initial virus titer (VIC) was determined by addition of 50 µL of the virus inoculum

149

directly to 2 mL cell culture medium without any desiccation.

150
151

Touch transfer test

152

For the touch transfer test with BCoV, three test persons simulated the transfer by

153

pressing a finger shortly on the dried inoculum on the respective carriers followed by

154

rubbing once with pressure over the carrier. Three other test persons simulated the

155

transfer by a fingerprint of 5 seconds on the dried inoculum on the different carriers.

156

Each test person performed the transfer test separately with the two different virus

157

concentrations (104 TCID50/mL and 106 TCID50/mL) with 8 fingers each. For each test

158

person and virus concentration, two fingers were used for virus transfer without drying

159

of the inoculum. The transfer procedure was the same as with the dried inoculum.

160

The amount of transferred virus to the fingers was obtained by dipping and rubbing each

161

finger in turn for one minute on the base of a Petri dish containing 2 mL cell culture

162

medium without FCS as sample fluid. For each finger a separate dish was used. The

163

eluates were transferred in a 25 mL container. Directly after elution, series of ten-fold

164

dilutions of the eluate in ice-cold maintenance medium were prepared and inoculated on

165

cell culture. The initial virus titer (VIC) was determined by addition of 50 μL of the virus

166

inoculum directly to 2 mL cell culture medium without any drying. Furthermore, a cell

167

control (only addition of medium) was incorporated.

168

For the touch transfer test of SARS-CoV-2, one person performed all assays due to BSL3

169

restrictions. To mimic the texture and nature of human fingertips, we used VITRO-SKIN

170

(IMS Florida Skincare Testing, FL, USA), an artificial skin substitute, placed in a plastic

171

frame was used (Fig. 3). After printing or rubbing as described above, the complete

172

artificial skin was released from the frame and transferred into a 25 mL container with

173

serum-free cell culture medium and vortexed for 60 s.

174
175

Determination of infectivity

176

Infectivity was determined by means of end point dilution titration using the microtiter

177

process. For this, samples were immediately diluted at the end of the exposure time with

178

ice-cold EMEM containing trypsin and 100 μL of each dilution were placed in 6 or 8

179

wells of a sterile polystyrene flat-bottomed plate with a preformed U373 (BCoV) or Vero

180

6 (SARS-CoV-2) monolayer. Before addition of virus, cells were washed twice with

181

EMEM (U373) or DMEM (Vero 6) and incubated for 3 h with 100 µL EMEM (U373)

182

or DMEM (Vero 6) with trypsin. After 3 d or 6 d incubation at 37 °C in a CO2-

183

atmosphere (5.0 % CO2-content), cultures were observed for cytopathic effects.

184

TCID50/mL was calculated according to the method of Spearman and Kärber [16].

185
186

Fitting of virus titer decay

187

To model the decay in virus titer, we implemented a Weibull distribution fit in GraphPad

188

Prism version 9.0.2 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA,

189

www.graphpad.com)

192

Calculation of the reduction factor

193

The loss in virus titer by desiccation was calculated by subtracting the titer on the

194

different carriers after desiccation from the titer of the initial virus control. The amount

195

of transferred virus (TCID50/mL) from the different carriers to the fingers was also

196

calculated with the method of Spearman and Kärber [16].

Results

200
201

Stability of BCoV on euro banknotes

202

To examine the stability of coronaviruses on banknotes we first used bovine coronavirus

203

(BCoV), which can be cultivated under lower biosafety levels and has been used as a

204

surrogate virus for inactivation studies replacing the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV and

205

SARS-CoV [17]. All euro banknotes are made of pure cotton fiber. To protect the surface

206

of banknotes with smaller denomination and prolong circulation life, 5 € and 10 €

207

banknotes are coated with a varnish applied after printing [18]. To account for the effect

208

of this varnish on surface stability of BCoV over time, we assessed residual infectivity

209

from pieces of 10 € and 50 € banknotes for 7 h, 24 h and subsequently every 24 – 48 h

210

up to 7 days (Fig. 1A). The initial virus concentration of 4.3 × 106 TCID50/mL declined

211

to 1.84 × 104 TCID50/mL on 10 € banknotes and 9.25 × 104 TCID50/mL on 50 €

212

banknotes after 7 h desiccation. To quantitatively compare this early loss of titer on the

213

different surfaces, we employed a fitted Weibull distribution model to estimate initial

214

decay rates and the modelled time to lower limit of quantification (Fig. 1B, Table 1). For

215

both banknotes we observed shorter initial decay (2.75 h on 50€ and 6.45 h on 10€) as

216

compared to the steel disc (49.62 h) (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Following the strong initial decay,

217

we were able to detect low amounts of infectious virus after 120 h (50€) and 168 h (10€)

218

respectively (Fig. 1A), which is very much in line with the observed times in the model

219

of 175.62 h for 50€. and 216.31 h for 10€ notes (Fig. 1B and Table 1). In contrast, on

220

steel discs a more continuous decay was observed and infectious virus could be

221

recovered up to 120 h (Fig. 1A), and 229.73 h for the fitted model, respectively (Fig. 1B,

222

Table 1).

223

Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on euro banknotes and coins

224

We next examined the surface stability of infectious SARS-CoV-2 on 10 € banknotes,

225

different coins (1 €, 10 cents, 5 cent) and stainless-steel discs for up to 7 days using an

226

initial virus concentration of 1.36 – 2.0 × 106 TCID50/mL (Fig. 2). On 10 € banknotes

227

and 1 € coins, the initial virus concentration declined to 2.32 × 104 TCID50/mL and 1.79

228

× 104 TCID50/mL, respectively, after 1.25 h, corresponding to an estimated initial decay

229

time of 6.07 h and 2.21 h (Fig. 2B, Table 1). No infectious virus could be recovered after

230

72 h and 48 h (Fig. 2A) matching 85.67 h and 28.43 h survival time (Fig. 2B, Table 1).

231

In contrast, on 10 cent and 5 cent coins the initial virus concentration declined to 5.96

232

× 104 TCID50/mL and 3.86 × 101 TCID50/mL, respectively, within 30 min. Initial decay

233

rates were calculated as 49.8 min (10 cent) and 12 min (5 cent) (Fig. 2B, Table 1).

234

Importantly, from 10 cent coins no infectious virus could be recovered after 6 h, while

235

for 5 cent coins infectivity was completely lost after 1 h (Fig. 2A), as reflected by 2.28

236

h and 33 min survival time for SARS-CoV-2 on 10 cent and 5 cent coins (Fig. 2B, Table

237

1). In contrast, on stainless-steel discs, which served as reference material, initial decay

238

and time to reach background levels were comparable to BCoV with 20.59 h and 158.83

239

h, respectively (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Virus titers declined more evenly until no infectious

240

virus could be recovered after 120 h (Fig. 2A).

Development of a touch transfer assay to study virus transfer between cash and

243

finger pads

244

Experiments performed under controlled laboratory conditions demonstrated the

245

persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces for days and consequently implied

246

the risk of viral transmission via contaminated objects [5,19]. However, to develop more

247

refined models to assess the risk of fomites-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2,

248

quantitative measurements of the transfer efficiency of infectious virus between skin and

249

surfaces are required. To address these limitations, we developed a touch transfer assay

250

to study the transfer of infectious BCoV and SARS-CoV-2 between finger pads and

251

different fomites (Fig. 3). Briefly, virus suspensions were placed on different surfaces

252

(pieces of 10 € banknotes, 10 cent coins, pieces of PVC to mimic the surface of credit

253

cards and stainless-steel discs as reference material). Afterwards, the wet inoculum or

254

the dried suspension was touched by “printing” or “rubbing” using finger pads (BCoV)

255

or an artificial skin fabric (SARS-CoV-2) (Fig. 3). Subsequently, infectious viruses were

256

recovered by dipping and rubbing each fingertip in turn for one minute on the base of a

257

Petri dish containing 2 mL of EMEM cell culture medium (BCoV) or, in case of the

258

artificial skin, by directly placing it into a container with cold DMEM (SARS-CoV-2).

259

The resulting suspension was serially diluted to determine TCID50/mL values of the

260

remaining infectious virus.

261
262

Transferability of BCoV from banknotes, coins and PVC to fingertips

263

Using this newly developed touch transfer assay, we examined the transmission of BCoV

264

from different surfaces, i.e. pieces of 10 € banknotes, 10 cent coins, pieces of PVC and

265

stainless-steel discs as reference material, to fingertips. Surfaces were inoculated with

266

either a high (~ 1 × 106 TCID50/mL) or low (~ 1 × 104 TCID50/mL) viral titer to represent

267

different degrees of surface contamination. Virus transfer was assessed directly

268

following application to fomites (wet) or after ~ 1 h until completely dried (dry) by either

269

pressing (print) or rubbing (rub) the fingertip onto the surface. Initial virus (input) was

270

determined by applying the fomites directly to the medium container. For a high initial

272

10-cent coin, while lower reduction factors were observed for the other surfaces (Fig.

273

4A). In case of drying the initial inoculum followed by a fingerprint, we observed a 2.1

274

log10 reduction on a 10 € banknote, while lower reduction factors were observed for the

275

other surfaces. For a low initial titer and direct surface contact, we observed the highest

276

reduction on the stainless-steel carrier (1.2 log10 reduction). In case of drying the initial

277

inoculum followed by a fingerprint, we observed a 0.8 log10 reduction on a 10-cent coin.

Importantly, no infectious virus could be recovered from the 10 € banknote under these

Transferability of SARS-CoV-2 from banknotes, coins and pvc to skin

282

Next, we examined the transmission of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces to

283

fingertips. Surfaces were inoculated with either a high (~ 1 × 106 TCID50/mL) or low (~

284

1 ×104 TCID50/mL) titer to represent different degrees of surface contamination. As

285

described before, virus transfer was assessed directly following inoculation (wet) or after

286

drying either by printing (print) or rubbing (rub). For a high initial titer and direct surface

287

contact, we observed a maximum of a 1 log10 reduction for the 10-cent coin, while lower

288

reduction factors were observed for the other surfaces (Fig. 5A). Drying of the initial

289

inoculum led to ~ 1 log loss in virus titer. In the dried state, less virus was transferred

290

and could be recovered, e.g. by fingerprint we observed a 3.0 log10 reduction on the 10-

291

cent coin, while lower reduction factors were observed for the other surfaces. For a low

292

initial titer and direct surface contact, we observed the highest reduction on the 10 €

293

banknote (0.7 log10 reduction). In case of drying the initial inoculum followed by a

294

fingerprint we observed a reduction of the initial inoculum close/under the limit of

4. Discussion

299

Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily by respiratory aerosols

300

or droplets and subsequent contact to nasal, oral, or ocular mucosal membranes.

301

Evidence-to-date further suggests that fomite transmission is possible for SARS-CoV-2

302

[5,19], however, the importance of this route in healthcare and public settings remains

303

controversial [12,13,20]. Fomite-based transmission contributes to the spread of other

304

common respiratory pathogens [21,22]. Consequently, paper currency and coins have

305

been suspected as a potential transmission vehicle for various pathogens, including

306

SARS-CoV-2 [10,11,23]. Although infectious viruses have not been directly detected on

307

banknotes or coins, the potential for their transmission has been highlighted by the

308

observation that human influenza viruses were able to persist and remain infectious for

309

several days when they were deposited on banknotes [24]. Furthermore, many other

310

viruses, (i.e. Adenoviruses, Rotaviruses) are stable in the environment and exhibit high

311

infectivity and, thus, could possibly be transferred by banknotes and coins [25]. In

312

agreement with previous reports we found that high titers of SARS-CoV-2 and its

313

surrogate BCoV, after an initial loss of infectivity, remained infectious for days under

314

laboratory conditions on banknotes and coins (Table 1, Fig. 1 and 2) [19,26]. The initial

315

loss of infectivity was higher on coins and banknotes, irrespective of protective varnish,

316

when compared to stainless steel, indicating faster desiccation due to liquid absorption

317

(banknotes) or antiviral surface properties (e.g. copper in coins). Both BCoV and SARS-

318

CoV-2 displayed highly comparable levels of virus transfer and stability among the

319

different conditions (Fig. 6), implying that BCoV is also a suitable surrogate virus to

320

model surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

322

Decay of SARS-CoV2 is likely determined by a combination of the initial amount of

323

infectious virus deposited on a given surface and other environmental parameters

324

(temperature, humidity, light and UV conditions). Furthermore, persistence of pathogens

325

in the environment represents only the first requirement for self-inoculation via

326

contaminated fingers. However, the possibility of fingerprint transmission has

327

quantitatively been examined only in the context of bacteria [27]. Using a newly

328

developed virus touch transfer assay, we observed transfer of BCoV and SARS-CoV-2

329

between fomites and skin using a high initial virus titer (~106 infectious virus particles).

330

This transfer was more efficient for the wet inoculum, while visual desiccation on the

331

one hand resulted in reduction of the titer as outlined above, as well as less efficient

332

mobilization of the viral particles, reflected by higher reduction factors. Consequently,

333

lower viral burdens (~104 infectious virus particles) mimicking real life contamination

334

events more realistic, as observed for influenza viruses in aerosol particles from human

335

coughs [13,28], were not effectively transferred (Fig. 4 and 5). Recent studies estimated

336

a minimal infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 in the range of 3 × 102 to 2 × 103 viral

337

particles [29]. Overall, our results point to a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by

338

coins and banknotes and the rush to abandon cash during the pandemic seems

339

unnecessary.

340

Given that cash is typically stored securely in wallets and purses, the risk of direct

341

contamination through exhaled droplets and aerosols seems much lower than constantly

342

exposed surfaces (e.g. doorbell, shopping carts). The role of a contagious person

343

contaminating banknotes and coins afresh when handing over, needs to be addressed in

344

future studies. Current government regulations to wear masks minimize the spread of

345

exhaled droplets and aerosols, and in combination with good hand hygiene also mitigate

346

the risk of transmission via contaminated surfaces. Still, contamination of cash is most

347

likely to occur indirectly by transfer from the hands of an infected person or finger

348

contact with a contaminated surface. However, any contamination by these routes would

349

likely result in a much lower degree of surface contamination than by direct

350

contamination as investigated in this study. Consequently, the overall chance of

351

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through banknotes, coins and credit/debit cards seems low

352

since a timely order of specific events – sufficient viable virus deposited on a surface,

353

survival of the virus until the surface is touched, and transfer of an infectious dose of

354

virus – is required.

Figure 4: Transferability of BCoV from cash fomites to fingertips. Bars depict titer

514

of input virus suspension and recovered infectious virus from different cash fomites, i.e.

515

10 cent coin, 10 € banknote, pvc and steel disc carrier in four different scenarios. A)

516

High initial input titer (~106 TCID50/mL) wet, when directly touch after application and

517

dry, when transferred after visual desiccation and B) low initial input titer (~104

518

TCID50/mL), wet and dry. Each scenario was performed by three test persons using eight

519

fingers each. Numbers above bars indicate reduction factor, lower limit of quantification

520

is shown as dashed line.

Figure 6: Suitability of BCoV as surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 in touch transfer

535

studies. Titers of recovered infectious virus were matched between BCoV and SARS-

536

CoV-2 for each scenario and linear regression curves calculated for input, rub and print.

537

Gray line and area represent the overall linear regression and 95% confidence interval

538

of all matched data points, dashed line depicts perfect correlation.
