Abstract
The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has caused a high number of deaths in the world. To
combat it, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of how the virus infects
host cells. Infection normally starts with the attachment of the virus to cell-surface
glycans like heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides. In this
study, we examined and compared the binding of the subunits and spike (S) proteins
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV to these glycans. Our results revealed
that the S proteins and subunits can bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner, the
length of HS is not a critical factor for the binding, and no binding with sialic acid
residues was detected. Overall, this work suggests that HS binding may be a general
mechanism for the attachment of these coronaviruses to host cells, and supports the
potential importance of HS in infection and in the development of antiviral agents
against these viruses.

Introduction
The 2019 novel coronavirus (CoV) is the seventh human coronavirus.1 It is a
deadly virus that is affecting the whole world in an unprecedented way. The global
impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is far beyond that of
two other major coronavirus outbreaks in the past 20 years, the severe acute
respiratory disease (SARS) in 20032,3 and the Middle East respiratory disease (MERS)
in 2012.4 Given that all three highly pathogenic CoVs were originated from bats and a
large number of closely related CoVs are present in bats, future outbreak of this type
of zoonotic virus remains possible. In order to avoid facing a similar pandemic in the
future, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of these CoVs, especially with
regard to effective ways that can help control the current COVID-19 pandemic and
prevent the second wave of outbreaks.
Studies showed that the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 has about 80% nucleotide
identity with that of SARS-CoV.5 The major differences are found in the regions
encoding the structural proteins (envelope E, membrane M, nucleocapsid N, and spike
S) and accessory proteins (ORF3a/3b, 6, 7a/7b, 8 and 10), not the nonstructural
proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). Based on this genetic similarity, the 2019 novel CoV was
named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).6 SARS-CoV-2 is more
genetically distant from MERS-CoV and shares only about 57% genome homology
with MERS-CoV.5,7 These similarities and differences are reflected in the viral binding
receptors to cell surface receptors. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the same
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into target cells,8-10
whereas MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the
primary receptor.11 However, there are many important findings that cannot be
explained by their genetic relations. For example, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 has
a relatively lower mortality rate (2%) than SARS-CoV (15%) and MERS-CoV (35%),
but is more transmissible among humans.12-14 These findings suggest that more
investigations other than genetic analysis need to be carried out to improve the
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In order to efficiently infect host cells, SARS-CoV-2 must bind with cell surface
molecules in the lungs and other organs to mediate viral attachment and entry into
host cells. Previous studies of many other viruses suggested that SARS-CoV-2 S
protein may use other molecules on host cell surface as attachment factors to facilitate
binding to the high-affinity receptor ACE2.15,16 Examples of such molecules include
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides.17-20 GAGs
are primarily localized at the outer surface of cells. Such a location makes them
particularly suitable for acting as attachment factors to recruit viruses to cell
surfaces.21,22 HS is one of the most prevalent types of GAGs in mammals. It is a linear
and sulfated polysaccharide that is abundantly expressed on the surface of almost all
cell types and in the extracellular matrix.23,24 The HS chains are mostly covalently
linked as side chains to core proteins to form HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. A possible mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection. At the early stage of the infection
process, SARS-CoV-2 may first interact with the HSPGs on the surface of susceptible cells using the S
protein protruding from the virus particle. This initial attachment may promote the subsequent binding of
the virus to the high-affinity entry receptor ACE2. The serine protease TMPRSS2 on host cell surface and
other host cell proteases may assist in viral entry by cleaving the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or at the S2’
sites.

HS is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus by many different enzymes. During and
after its assembly, HS undergoes extensive series of modifications including sulfation,
acetylation and epimerization, which leads to glycan structures with high heterogeneity
in length, sulfation, and glucuronate/iduronate ratio.25 Considerable variation in the
sulfation pattern and degree of HS was noted in different species, organs, tissues, and
even at different ages and disease stages.23,24,26 The sequence and sulfation pattern
of HS has been shown to be able to regulate the binding of many viruses to host cells
during infection.27,28 A similar trend was also observed for sialylation patterns of cell
surface oligosaccharides.17,29,30 These findings implicate that a possible relationship
may exist between the distribution of different types of HS/sialylated glycans and the
viral tropism.31-33 A better understanding of their relationship can potentially contribute
to the design of new antiviral strategies. Although currently the data on the viral tropism
of SARS-CoV-2 are limited, results from recent studies suggested that its tropism may
not be correlated with the ACE2 expression.34,35 Some other factors, such as proteases
and glycans, may be the determinant of cellular susceptibility to the infection with this
virus.36 A recent study suggested that HS may bind to the receptor binding domain

(RBD, the C-terminal region of the S1 subunit, Fig. 2) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
and change its conformation.37 The intriguing possibility that variation in HS and sialic
acid characteristics could impact the tropism of viruses prompts us to investigate the
binding of SARS-CoV-2 toward a series of HS and sialic acid containing
oligosaccharides.38

Figure 2. Schematic diagram showing the domain organization of the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV and MERS-CoV. The RBD is shown in pink color. The sequences of the S1/S2 and S2’ cleavage
sites are given on top of each diagram. The red arrows indicate the cleave points.

In this study, we systematically examined and compared the binding of the SARSCoV-2 S protein subunits, full-length molecule and its trimer to different HS using
microarray experiments (Fig. 2). Our results suggested that all the tested protein
molecules were capable of binding HS oligomers and had similar binding preferences,
with higher affinity toward HS forms with higher degrees of sulfation. The binding was
also shown to be positively related to the level of 6-O-sulfation. The HS chain length
seemed to be not critical. A long heparin molecule (a highly sulfated HS) and a
synthetic heparin pentasaccharide (Fondaparinux sodium) were demonstrated to have
similar binding affinity to these protein molecules. Moreover, our study suggested that
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein might not be able to bind sialic acid residues, or the binding
might be too weak to be detected by the microarray technology, and the S proteins of
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have similar HS and sialic acid binding properties as those
of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Overall, our study laid a foundation for future studies to
explore whether the binding specificity to HS can serve as an important contributor to
the viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and to explore the possibility of exploiting HS for
therapeutic strategies.

Results
Binding of the subunits and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERSCoV to a HS microarray. An early study has suggested that the RBD of SARS-CoV-

2 S protein might bind heparin.9 In order to determine if there is any preference of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein for particular HS structures, we first investigated the binding of
the RBD (Here termed as SARS-CoV-2-RBD) to a HS microarray containing 24
synthetic heparan sulfate oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides have systematic
differences in their length, monosaccharide composition, and sulfation pattern (Fig. 3).
The microarray experiment was performed using a previously established standard
protocol.29,39,40 Briefly, the proteins were labeled with Cy3 fluorescent dye and
incubated with the microarray at different concentrations. After washing away the
unbound HS molecules, a highly sensitive fluorescence method was used to detect
the binding of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD to HS. Under the experimental conditions, the
binding can be detected at concentrations higher than 0.5 g/ml. Increasing the
concentration of the protein was not found to produce noticeable changes in binding
(Supporting Information, Fig. S1).

Figure 3: The numbering and structures of the HS oligosaccharides on the microarray. Each HS chain is
covalently attached to the microarray slide via the reducing end. The HS oligosaccharides can be roughly
divided into five groups according to their differences in the monosaccharide compositions and sulfation
patterns.

Quantification of fluorescence revealed that the SARS-CoV-2-RBD is able to bind
to almost half of the molecules on the microarray, and not surprisingly, the binding is
strongly affected by the sulfation level, which is a trend that has been previously noted
for many HS-binding proteins.41-43 As shown in Figure 4a, the HS oligosaccharides with
higher sulfation degree, HS020-HS024 (the number of sulfate groups per
monosaccharide unit >1.00), exhibit higher fluorescence intensity. The highest
fluorescence intensity is observed for HS023 (1.35 sulfate groups per
monosaccharide), which is followed by those of HS021 and HS024 (1.25 sulfate
groups per monosaccharide) and those of HS020 and HS022 (1.15 sulfate groups per
monosaccharide). Binding of SARS-CoV-2-RBD to HS seems to not be affected by the
monosaccharide composition (compare HS020 with HS022, and HS021 with HS024).

measured at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. All error bars are standard deviation of more than three
replicates.

The oligosaccharides with relatively lower sulfation levels (HS001-HS019, the
number of sulfate groups per monosaccharide unit <1.00) have lower or almost no
fluorescence signals. An analysis of the effect of the variation in sulfation revealed that
the position of sulfation is another factor that strongly influence the binding. As shown
in the Figure 4, removal of the 6-O-sulfate group from the glucosamine units
significantly reduced the binding (compare HS017 with HS020, HS018 with HS021,
and HS019 with HS022), suggesting that the 6-O-sulfate in HS plays a crucial role in

determining its interaction with SARS-CoV-2-RBD. The importance of the 6-O-sulfate
for binding is further supported by comparing the binding of HS012, HS013, HS014,
HS015, and HS016, which shows that the one-by-one addition of sulfate to the 6-Oposition of the glucosamine residues gradually increased the binding of HS with SARSCoV-2-RBD. The microarray study also indicates that the binding is not positively
related to the length of the HS chains. Short HS oligosaccharides could have
comparable or even better binding properties (compare HS001-HS006, HS007HS0012, and HS020-HS024).
The binding results of the SARS-CoV-2-S1 follow a similar trend as those of the
SARS-CoV-2-RBD, with only minor differences for a few HS molecules like HS001,
HS007, HS016, HS021 and HS024 (Fig. 4b). This is consistent with the assumption
that RBD is the major determinant for viral S protein binding to HS.
Examination of the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed the presence
of a potential cleavage site for furin proteases (RRARS) at the S1/S2 boundary.9 This
is similar to the S protein of MERS-CoV, which also contain a furin consensus
sequence RXXR (Fig. 2). Furin cleavage can occur in the secretory pathway of infected
cells and breaks the covalent linkage between the S1 and S2 subunits.44 The S2
subunit functions to fuse the virus to the host cell. It may interact with HS on the cell
surface to facilitate the fusion process. Therefore, to determine the role of HS in SARSCoV-2 infection, it is also important to investigate the binding of the S2 subunit to HS.
Very interestingly, our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2-S2 can also bind to HS,
with the binding preferences similar to those of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD and the SARSCoV-2-S1 (Fig. 4c). This suggests that HS may also play an important role during viral
membrane fusion after the S1 subunit is removed from the S protein.
We also further investigated the binding full-length S protein and its trimer to HS
using the same microarray. Our data showed that, although the binding to HS020HS024 still remains the highest, the full-length S protein has increased binding to HS
with slightly less sulfation, particularly the molecules in groups HS007-HS012 and
HS013-HS016 (Fig. 4d, 4e). Additionally, we found that the binding preferences of the
RBDs, S1 subunits and full-length S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are similar
to those of the subunits and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, although small differences are
observed (Fig. 4f-k). Because the MERS-CoV S protein also contains a furin cleavage
site, we studied the binding of its S2 subunit to the HS microarray. Once again, the
results are similar to those of the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these data
support the involvement of HS in the binding with the subunits and S proteins of SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and support the importance of HS for the infection
of these coronaviruses.

Measurement of the dissociation constants of a long heparin molecule and
fondaparinux to the immobilized subunits and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV, and MERS-CoV by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To determine the
relative binding strength of the subunits and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,
and MERS-CoV, we measured and compared the dissociation constants (KD) of the
protein molecules studied in the microarray experiment using a real-time SPR-based
binding assay. A commercially available porcine heparin from Sigma-Aldrich was used
as the first binding partner for the measurement. It is a mixture of highly sulfated HS,
with most chains in the molecular weight range of 17 to 19 kilodalton. This long heparin
molecule is more similar to the HS molecules on the host cell surface than those on
the microarray. In the SPR assay, protein molecules were covalently linked to the
surface of the CM5 (carboxymethylated dextran) sensor chips by amine coupling. The
heparin in various concentrations was then flowed over the immobilized proteins. The
changes in refractive index by molecular interactions at the sensor surface were
monitored and the dissociation constants were obtained by fitting the results using the

The comparison of the dissociation constants revealed that all the tested protein
molecules can bind to the heparin, but their binding affinities are relatively low (KDs are
at the micromolar level). This agrees well with previous observations that HS is a weak
binder to viral S proteins.45 The results also showed that RBD has the lowest binding
affinity among the tested protein molecules of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig, 5a). The S protein
trimer and S1 subunit have relatively lower binding affinity in comparison with the fulllength S protein and S2 subunit, respectively (Fig, 5b-e). Very similar trends were also

observed for differences in the binding affinities of the tested protein molecules of
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig, 5f-l).
In addition to the long heparin molecule, we also measured the binding of the
protein molecules to fondaparinux (Arixtra®), which is an ultralow-molecular-weightheparin (ULMWH) containing five monosaccharide units (Fig. 6). It has a well-defined
chemical structure and is currently the only ULMWH that has been clinically approved
as an anticoagulant. Fondaparinux is very similar to HS023 in size, monosaccharide
composition, and sulfation position and degree. The results showed that the KD values
of fondaparinux binding to the tested protein molecules are in the same range as those
for the long heparin. This agrees well with the observation in the microarray study,
suggesting that the length of the HS chains is not a determining factor for binding.
Despite the similarity, there is a subtle but noticeable difference, which is that the
binding affinities of the S1 subunit and RBD to fondaparinux are quite similar.
Binding of the RBD, S1 subunit and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and S proteins of
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to sialylated glycan microarrays. Many human viruses
can interact with sialic acid-containing glycans present on the cell surface.17,20 Such an
interaction is normally mediated by the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit.46 In order
to find out if SARS-CoV-2 can bind to sialic acid residues, we carried out microarray
analyses of its S protein and subunits. The first microarray used contains 100 different
N-glycans that may be found on the surface of cells. 49 of them are terminated with
α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acid, also known as N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), 8
with α2,3- and α2,6-linked N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and the rest with other
glycan residues (Supporting Information, Table S1). The experiment was performed in
the similar way as described for the HS microarray study. The microarray results
showed that both the SARS-CoV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-2-S1 gave no binding signal,
suggesting that they may not be able to interact with sialylated N-glycans or the binding
signal is too low to be detected. In order to confirm this finding, we also investigated
the binding of the full-length S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
to more sialylated glycans, including sialylated N- and O-linked glycans and glycolipid
glycans (Supporting Information, Tables S2-4), but again no specific binding was
detected.

Discussion
For a virus like SARS-CoV-2 to establish infection, it must first attach itself to the
surface of target cells in different organs and tissues. The S protein plays an essential
role in this attachment process. Recently, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the
prefusion conformation was determined by the cryo-EM technique.10 It shows that the
overall structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is very similar to that of the closely
related SARS-CoV S protein, which is organized as a homotrimer. Each monomer can
be divided into an N-terminal receptor-binding S1 subunit and a C-terminal fusionmediating S2 subunit. The S1 subunits are located at the apex of the spike, making

them more accessible for binding to the proteinaceous receptor, ACE2. Although
similar, there are some notable differences between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
S proteins.8,10 For example, the key amino acid residues involved in the binding of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 are largely different from those of SARS-CoV.9,47,48
These differences may be related to the observed higher binding affinity of the SARSCoV-2 S protein to ACE2.
Another important difference between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins is
that the former protein contains a multibasic protease recognition motif (RRARS) at
the junction of S1 and S2.9 A multibasic cleavage site (RSVRS) was also identified in
the MERS-CoV S protein (Fig. 2).49 The SARS-CoV S protein only has a monobasic
amino acid (SSLRS) at the same site. The multibasic site can be processed by furin or
related proprotein convertases, which are widely expressed in different tissues, before
the virus is released from the host cell. By contrast, the monobasic site can be cleaved
by TMPRSS2 or other cell-surface proteases (whose expression is confined to certain
tissues) only after the virus is released from the host cell. It was reported that the
cleavage at the junction of S1 and S2 activates the S protein for virus-cell fusion. Thus,
the presence of the multibasic cleavage site may partially account for the enhanced
infectivity and tropism of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV for human cells.10,50
However, what is vague is how the virus attaches to the host cells after losing the S1
subunit, which is responsible for the binding to the proteinaceous receptor.
In addition to binding protein-based receptors, many viruses can interact with cell
surface glycans, including GAGs and sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides.
Depending on the virus, the glycan molecules can act as attachment factors, coreceptors or primary receptors.51 Viruses typically bind GAGs through non-specific
charge-based interactions. As one of the most abundant GAGs, HS appears to be the
preferred binding partner for many viruses.33,52-55 Sialic acids are normally terminal
monosaccharide residues linked to glycans decorating cell surface glycoproteins,
glycolipids, or other glycoconjugates.20,56 In general, the interactions of viruses with HS
or sialic acids are responsible for the first contact with host cells. Such contact may
serve to concentrate viruses on the surface of target cells, facilitate their binding to
more specific high-affinity protein receptors and/or promote their entry into host
cells.57,58 It has been demonstrated that virus binding and infection can be reduced by
enzymatic removal HS or sialic acid from cell surface, or by treating virus with soluble
HS or multivalent sialic acid conjugates.30,59-61 Therefore, in order to better understand
and treat COVID-19, it is necessary to carry out research to investigate the possible
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and HS and sialic acid-containing glycans in the
forms of separate subunits and full-length proteins, and to assess if such interactions
could represent a target for therapeutic intervention.
Similar to studies that have been successfully conducted for many other viruses, we
used the microarray and SPR technology to study the binding of the RBDs, S1/S2

subunits and full-length S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and
a trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to HS and sialic acid.59 The microarray results
showed that all the tested protein molecules can bind to about half of the
oligosaccharides on the HS microarray. In contrast, only background levels of
fluorescence were detected on various sialylated glycan microarrays. This observation
suggests all the tested protein molecules are able to bind to HS45,62 and may not bind
to and/or have very low binding affinity to sialylated glycans. This well agrees with
previous studies showing that SARS-CoV can bind to HS62 and the binding of the
MERS-CoV S protein to sialic acid-containing glycans can only be detected after the
S1 subunit was attached to a nanoparticle to enhance its avidity via multivalent
interactions.17
Our results also suggested that the binding of the tested proteins to HS is related
to HS sulfation position and degree. It seems that more 6-O-sulfate groups and higher
sulfation degree normally lead to better binding. Because HSPGs exhibit different
sulfation patterns in different tissues, such a binding specificity may contribute to the
tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for human cells.63 The length of HS appears not to be a critical
factor for the binding. Short HS chains could have comparable binding specificity and
signals. The comparison of the SPR KD values obtained for the long heparin molecule
and fondaparinux further support this finding. It implies that it may be possible to
reduce the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the surface of host cells by low-molecularweight-heparin (LMWH). This is in agreement with a recent study showing that LMWH
treatment may be associated with better prognosis in some severe COVID-19
patients.64 While these initial findings are encouraging, further research is required to
determine if the binding to HS could affect the tropism and pathogenesis of SARSCoV-2 and to determine if HS could be used for the inhibition of the infection of this
virus.
Our SPR data of the tested protein molecules also showed that the S2 subunits
could have similar or better binding affinity for HS as compared to those of the S1
subunits. This finding suggests that the cleaved S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and MERSCoV may depend on HS for interaction with the host cells during viral membrane fusion.
In parallel with our study, the Linhardt and Boons research teams also conducted
studies to investigate the binding of S proteins to HS.45,65 The absolute values of the
dissociation constants determined in our experiments are largely different from those
presented by these two teams. This can be seen from the binding of the full-length S
protein of SARS-CoV-2, which was studied by all three teams (Supporting Information,
Table S5). Our KD is one order of magnitude higher than that reported by the Boons
team, which in turn is three orders of magnitude higher than that reported by the
Linhardt team. The differences in results may be due to the method of analysis and/or
the experimental materials used in the studies. In our study, the tested proteins were
immobilized on the surface of CM5 sensor chips, while in their experiments,

biotinylated heparin molecules were immobilized on the chips. At the same time,
because the S glycoproteins and the heparin molecules were obtained from different
sources, their composition may be different from each other.
In conclusion, through our study, we provided experimental evidence for whether
or not the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to two types of cell-surface glycans, HS
and sialic acid-containing glycans, which are commonly utilized by human viruses for
attachment to target cells. Our data revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein can
weakly bind to HS in a sulfation-dependent manner. No binding with sialic acid residues
was detected using the microarray assay. The results suggest that HS may act as an
attachment factor to concentrate the virus at the cell surface and affect its tropism.
Through comparison, we found that the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have
similar binding properties to HS as that of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating that
HS binding may be a conserved feature for these three types of coronaviruses. Our
data also revealed that the S2 subunits could bind equally well as the S1 subunits to
HS. This binding may be an important element for viral attachment to the host cell
surface after the removal of the N-terminal receptor-binding domains by protease
cleavage. Overall, our findings support the potential importance of HS in SARS-CoV2 infection and in the development of antiviral agents.

Methods
Reagents and cell lines. High Five™ Cells for baculovirus expression were
purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific and maintained in Express Five™ Medium.
The recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S1 (16-685), SARS-CoV-2-S (16-1213, R683A,
R685A), SARS-CoV-2-S-trimer (16-1213, R683A, R685A), SARS-CoV-RBD (306-527),
SARS-CoV-S1 subunit (14-667), SARS-CoV-S (14-1195, R677A) with C-terminal Histags were purchased from ACROBiosystems. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S2 (6861213), MERS-CoV-RBD (367-606), MERS-CoV-S1 (1-725), MERS-CoV-S2 (7261296), MERS-CoV-S (1-1297) with C-terminal His-tags were purchased from Sino
Biological. The heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich/Merck. Fondaparinux (sodium salt) was purchased from Macklin
Biochemical Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The glycan microarray experiments were
performed by Creative Biochip Ltd (Nanjing, China).
Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2-RBD. DNA containing the coding
sequence for an N-terminal hemo signal peptide, the receptor binding domain (RBD,
residues 319-541) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag was
amplified and inserted into a pFasebac1 vector for expression in High-5 insect cells
using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen). The resulting recombinant
protein, termed SARS-CoV-2-RBD-His, was secreted into cell culture medium, and
subsequently purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity column, followed
by a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The final buffer for the protein

contains 10 mM Hepes (pH=7.0) and 100 mM NaCl. The purified SARS-CoV-2-RBDHis was concentrated to 3.5 mg/ml and flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80
degrees Celsius.
Binding of recombinant proteins to glycan microarrays. The tested protein
molecules were first labeled with Cy3 fluorescent dye (10 mg/ml in DMSO). After
dialysis, they were incubated at different concentrations with microarrays for 1 hour in
the dark at room temperature. After incubation, the microarray slides were gently
washed using washing buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl containing 0.1% tween 20, pH 7.4) to
remove unbound proteins. Finally, the slides were scanned with a microarray scanner
LuxScan-10K/Aat an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and evaluated by the Microarray
Image Analyzer software.
Measurement of dissociation constants by surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
The SPR measurements were performed using BIAcore T200 and S200 (GE
healthcare). First, the carboxymethyl dextran matrix on CM5 sensor chip (GE
Healthcare) was activated by injection of a 1:1 mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS).
Recombinant proteins in 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5, GE Healthcare) was then
injected over the chip surface at a flow rate of 30 μl/min to couple the amino groups of
the recombinant proteins to the carboxymethyl dextran matrix. After the coupling
reaction, the remaining activated ester groups were deactivated by ethanolamine. The
binding study was carried out at 25°C in PBS-P buffer (GE Healthcare). The heparin
molecule or fondaparinux at different concentrations were flowed over the immobilized
recombinant proteins at a flow rate of 30 μl/min with a contact time of 60 s and a
dissociation time of 100 s. The surface was regenerated by injection of 10 mM GlycineHCl (pH 2.5) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 30 s. Data was collected and analyzed by
BIA evaluation software (GE Healthcare).
