Abstract: A main clinical parameter of COVID-19 pathophysiology is hypoxia. Here we
show that hypoxia decreases the attachment of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and
the S1 subunit (S1) of the spike protein to epithelial cells. In Vero E6 cells, hypoxia
reduces the protein levels of ACE2 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which might in part
explain the observed reduction of the infection rate. In addition, hypoxia inhibits the
binding of the spike to NCI-H460 human lung epithelial cells by decreasing the cell
surface levels of heparan sulfate (HS), a known attachment receptor of SARS-CoV-2.
This interaction is also reduced by lactoferrin, a glycoprotein that blocks HS moieties
on the cell surface. The expression of syndecan-1, an HS-containing proteoglycan
expressed in lung, is inhibited by hypoxia on a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Hypoxia or
deletion of syndecan-1 results in reduced binding of the RBD to host cells. Our study
indicates that hypoxia acts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the
hypoxia signaling pathway might offer therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of
COVID-19.

Introduction
By mid-April of 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 135 million people and caused
>2.9 million deaths. Until now, more than 727 million vaccines have been administered.
However, the efficacy of available vaccines against emerging variants remains unclear
[1, 2]. Therefore, the need of effective treatments to prevent the infection or to manage
the disease in severe cases of COVID-19 remains an urgent medical need.
The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with ACE2, a key-receptor widely
expressed on the respiratory tract, through the receptor binding domain (RBD) [3, 4, 5].
Other factors such as neuropilin-1 (NRP1) [6, 7] and the transmembrane protease
serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [8] contribute to the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell.
Another layer of interaction between the virus and the host that facilitates viral entry is
the attachment of the spike protein to cellular heparan sulfate (HS) [5]. HS is part of the
cellular glycocalyx and decorates the HS-containing proteoglycans (HSPGs). The
family of syndecans are HSPGs expressed on several cell types and organs [9], being
syndecan-1 the most relevant in terms of expression in the lung [10]. The interaction
between the spike and HS can be efficiently blocked by lactoferrin [11].
A common feature of COVID-19 patients is moderate to severe hypoxia [12]. Disease
severity correlates with the level of naturally occurring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in
serum [13], and patients with severe disease are characterized by low oxygen
saturation that often results in the need of oxygen supplementation [14]. Currently, the
impact of hypoxia on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 pathogenesis is unclear,
but there are emerging indications that low oxygen concentrations might prevent
infection or disease severity [15, 16]. This notion is supported, in part, by the fact that
epidemiological data indicates that COVID-19 severity decreases in high altitude areas
[17].
There is evidence indicating that the expression of ACE2, the main receptor of SARSCoV-2, is regulated by hypoxia on a cell type- and time-dependent manner [18, 19],
which might influence the cellular susceptibility to infection. Additionally, the members
of the syndecan family, the main cellular HSPGs, are also differentially regulated by
hypoxia. For example, the expression of syndecan-1 in the lungs is reduced under
hypoxia [20, 21].
Cell responses to hypoxia are mediated by the family of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF).
COVID-19 disease leads to the accumulation of HIF in the lung, providing a molecular
link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypoxia in patients with severe disease [22].
Our hypothesis is that hypoxia modulates the expression of entry receptors and
attachment factors on host cells. In this context, elucidating the underlying mechanisms
of this regulation could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the
management of COVID-19, including those targeting the hypoxia response pathway.

Cell Culture. The NCI-H460 human lung epithelial cell line was obtained from DSMZ
(German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Lines Cat#: ACC737) and cultured in
RPMI medium 1640 GlutaMAX (Gibco Cat#: 61870044) according to standard culture
protocols. Vero E6 monkey kidney cells (ATCC Cat#: CRL-1586) were kindly provided
by Nicola G.A. Abrescia (CIC bioGUNE) and cultured in MEM (Gibco Cat#: 31095029). HEK 293T cells (Takara Bio Inc. Cat#: 632180) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco
Cat#: 41966-029). Media were supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Cat#:
10270106) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Cat#: 15140122). Hypoxia
cultures were performed at 1% O2 and 5% CO2 in an In Vivo2 400 hypoxia station
(Ruskinn Technologies).
Lactoferrin assay. Binding of RBD to the surface of cells was measured by flow
cytometry after incubation with increasing doses of human lactoferrin (0, 1, 5 and 10
mM) (Sigma Aldrich Cat#: L1294) in a final volume of 100 μL of culture medium. The
incubation was done for 45 minutes in a cell incubator with standard conditions (37°C,
21% oxygen and 5% CO2).
Assessment of binding of RBD and S1 to the cell surface. After culture, cells were
collected with cell dissociation buffer (Thermo Fisher Cat#: 13151-014), distributed in
96-well polystyrene conical bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Cat#: 249570) and washed
with PBS (Fisher BioReagents Cat#: BP3994) containing 0.5% BSA (Sigma Aldrich
Cat#: A9647) (blocking buffer) followed by centrifugation and the supernatant was
discarded. Cells were incubated with biotinylated S1 (Acrobiosystems Cat#: S1NC82E8) or RBD (Acrobiosystems Cat#: SPD-C82E9) proteins (20 μg/mL) in 50 μL of
blocking buffer for 30 minutes at 4°C. After incubation, cells were centrifuged, washed
with 200 μL of blocking buffer, centrifuged again and incubated with streptavidin-PE
(Thermo Fisher Cat#: 12-4317-87) diluted in 100 μL of blocking buffer (1:200 dilution).
Finally, cells were centrifuged and washed twice and resuspended in blocking buffer
with DAPI (Invitrogen Cat#: D1306) for acquisition in the flow cytometer. All
centrifugation steps were performed at 300 x g for 5 min (4°C).
Generation of pseudotyped lentiviral particles. Pseudotyped lentiviral particles were
generated by transfecting HEK 293T cells as described in Crawford et al. [23], using a
five-plasmid third generation system kindly provided by Dr. Jesse D. Bloom (Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) and Dr. Jean-Philippe Julien (University of
Toronto). Confluent HEK 293T cells (50-70%) were transfected with plasmids encoding
for the lentiviral backbone (containing a CMV promoter to express ZsGreen) (NR52520, 5.79 µg), the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (NR-52514, 1.97 µg), HDM-Hgpm2
(NR-52517, 1.27 µg), pRC-CMV-Rev1b (NR-52519, 1.27 µg) and HDM-tat1b (NR52518, 1.27 µg) using the jetPEI kit (Polyplus-transfection Cat#: 101-10N). 48 hours
after transfection, viruses were harvested from the supernatant, filtered through a 0.45
µm filter (VWR Cat#: 514-0063), concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio
Inc. Cat#: 631231) and stored in PBS at -80ºC until use.
Titration of the pseudotyped lentiviral particles and infection of Vero E6 cells.
Viral titration was performed in Vero E6 cells as described in Crawford et al. [23]. For
single-infection experiments, 150.000 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured
overnight in normoxia (21% O2) and incubated for additional 24 hours under normoxia

or hypoxia (1% O2). After that, cells were incubated with the pseudotyped lentiviral
particles (MOI: 0.1) for 48 hours under normoxic conditions. The infected cells
expressed ZsGreen, allowing their detection by flow cytometry.
Deletion of HIF-1α and syndecan-1 in NCI-H460 cells via CRISPR/Cas9. Deletion of
HIF-1α in NCI-H460 cells was performed using a pool of two sgRNAs from Synthego
(sgRNA sequences: gaugguaagccucaucacag and guuuuccaaacuccgacauu) and the
TrueCut Cas9 protein v2 (Invitrogen Cat#: A36497). Deletion of syndecan-1 was
performed using the following TrueGuide Synthetic sgRNAs from Invitrogen:
CRISPR913712_SGM and CRISPR913714_SGM. RNP-complexes were generated
with 7.5 pmol of Cas9, 7.5 pmol of the sgRNA-1 and 7.5 pmol of the sgRNA-2. RNPcomplexes were introduced into cells using the Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX Cas9
Transfection reagent (Invitrogen Cat#: CMAX00001) and Opti-MEM reduced serum
medium (Gibco Cat#: 31985062) following the Pub. No. MAN0017058 by Invitrogen
(pages 5 and 6). A non-targeting sgRNA that does not recognize any sequence in the
human genome was used as a negative control (Invitrogen Cat#: A35526). The
deletion efficiency of HIF-1α and syndecan-1 proteins was measured by western blot
and flow cytometry, respectively, and the pool of edited cells was used for downstream
experiments.
Flow cytometry. Cells were collected, washed with blocking buffer and incubated with
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (1:100 dilution in blocking buffer) against
syndecan-1 (BD Biosciences Cat#: 565943), syndecan-2 (R&D Systems Cat#:
FAB2965P), syndecan-3 (R&D Systems Cat#: FAB3539A) and syndecan-4 (R&D
Systems Cat#: FAB291819) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Total cellular heparan sulfate (HS)
was measured by flow cytometry after incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C with an anti-HS
primary antibody (Amsbio Cat#: 370255-S; clone F58-10E4) (1:200 dilution in blocking
buffer). After that, cells were centrifuged, washed and incubated with an anti-IgM FITCconjugated secondary antibody (Miltenyi Biotec Cat#: 130-095-906) (1:500 dilution in
blocking buffer). Finally, cells were centrifuged, washed twice and resuspended in 200
μL of blocking buffer in the presence of 7-AAD (BD Biosciences Cat#: 51-68981E) or
DAPI (Invitrogen Cat#: D1306) to discriminate alive cells. Cells were acquired on a
FACSymphony cytometer (BD Biosciences). The results were analyzed using FlowJo
version 10 (BD Biosciences).
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA kit (MachereyNagel Cat#: 740955.250). The cDNA was synthesized by RT-PCR from 1 μg of purified
RNA with the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Cat#: 28025-013) and
random primers (Thermo Fisher Cat#: 58875). The quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)
reactions were conducted in triplicate on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo
Fisher) from 1 μL of cDNA using the PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix reagent
(Quantabio Cat#: 95056-500) and gene-specific primers. The amplification program
consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation
at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 60°C for 60 s and extension at 72°C for 60 s. Data were
analyzed using the QuantStudio software version 1.3 (Thermo Fisher). The relative
quantification in gene expression was determined using the 2–ΔΔCt method by using the
RPLP0 gene as a housekeeping gene (forward: 5’-CGACCTGGAAGTCCAACTAC-3’
and reverse: 5’-ATCTGCTGCATCTGCTTG-3’). PGK1, a HIF-1α target gene, was used

as a control for hypoxia (forward: 5’-CCGCTTTCATGTGGAGGAAGAAG-3’ and
reverse: 5’-CTCTGTGAGCAGTGCCAAAAGC-3’). Primer sequences for measuring
ACE2 and SDC1 expression on human NCI-H460 cells were previously described by
Ma et al. [24] and Reynolds et al. [25], respectively. As these oligos presented several
mismatches with the corresponding genes on the reference genome of the African
green monkey, we designed the following primers to amplify ACE2 from Vero E6 cells
(forward:
5’-AGCACTCACGATTGTTGGGA-3’
and
reverse:
5’CCACCCCAACTATCTCTCGC-3’).
Western Blot. Total cell lysates were collected using RIPA buffer and quantified with
the BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Cat#: 23227). Samples were mixed with
LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen Cat#: NP0007) containing DTT, boiled for 15 minutes,
separated in a 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast protein gels (BioRad Cat#:
4561083) and transferred to a 0.2 μm PVDF membranes (BioRad Cat#: 1704156)
using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (BioRad). PageRuler protein ladder (Thermo
Fisher Cat#: 26619) was used to estimate the molecular weight of the proteins. The
membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% skim milk (Millipore Cat#: 70166) and 0.5%
Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich Cat#: 9005-64-5) diluted in PBS. The membranes were
probed overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% BSA and
0.5% Tween-20, washed five times with PBS (containing 0.5% Tween-20), incubated
for 1 hour at RT with the corresponding secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:5000
diluted in 5% skim milk and 0.5% Tween-20 diluted in PBS) and washed for five
additional times. The membranes were probed with antibodies against HIF-1α (Novus
Biologicals Cat#: NB100-449), ACE2 (Bioss antibodies Cat#: bsm-52614R), NRP1
(Novus Biologicals Cat#: NBP2-67539), TMPRSS2 (Novus Biologicals Cat#: NBP300492), β-actin (Cell Signaling Cat#: D6A8) and β-tubulin (Thermo Fisher Cat#: MA516308). The HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse (Cat#:
S301677076S) and rabbit (Cat#: S301677074S) were obtained from Cell Signaling.
Chemiluminescence detection was performed using Clarity Max Western ECL
Substrate (BioRad Cat#: 170506) on an iBright system (Invitrogen). Band densitometry
was performed using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0. The

Results
Hypoxia reduces the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike to epithelial cells.
In order to understand if hypoxia could affect the cellular binding capacity of the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, we subjected Vero E6 cells or human lung epithelial cells (NCIH460) to different oxygen concentrations (21% O2 or 1% O2) and measured the binding
ability of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S1 subunit (S1) of the spike
protein to the surface of these cells in vitro. Figure 1 shows a significant decrease of
the binding of RBD and S1 after culturing Vero E6 (Figure 1a) or NCI-H460 (Figure 1b)
cells under hypoxia (1% O2) compared to normoxia (21% O2).

Hypoxia decreases ACE2 and NRP1 protein levels on Vero E6 cells.
To further explore the mechanism underlying the observed reduced binding of the
spike under hypoxia, we assessed ACE2 gene and protein expression on Vero E6 and
NCI-H460 cells by Q-PCR and western blot (WB), respectively. Vero E6 cells, but not
NCI-H460 cells, present detectable levels of ACE2 transcripts (Figure 2a). Accordingly,
ACE2 protein is only detectable on Vero E6 cells (Figure 2b), suggesting that the
observed binding of the spike to the surface of NCI-H460 cells is ACE2-independent.
We then explored if hypoxia modulates ACE2 expression on Vero E6 cells. Hypoxia
culture results in a transient accumulation of HIF-1α and upregulation of the expression
of ACE2 (Figure 2b and 2c). After 48 hours of exposure to limited oxygen supply, the
level of ACE2 protein on Vero E6 cells is significantly reduced (Figure 2b). On a similar
manner, we measured the expression of other important factor that mediate the initial
steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection: NRP1 and TMPRSS2. NRP1 (but not TMPRSS2) is
significantly reduced on Vero E6 cells after culture for 48 hours under hypoxia (Figure
2d), as previously described by Casazza et al. [26] on the hypoxic tumor
microenvironment. NCI-H460 cells do not express detectable levels of NRP1.
Hypoxia prevents the infection of Vero E6 cells with pseudotyped viral particles
expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
We then assessed the influence of oxygen availability on the infection capacity of
pseudotyped lentiviral particles that express the full-length spike of SARS-CoV-2. Vero
E6 cells exposed to hypoxia show a significant decrease on the rate of infection (Figure
3a) compared to normoxia. NCI-H460 cells, which lack expression of ACE2 and NRP1
(Figures 2b and 2d), are not amenable to infection (Figure 3b).
Lactoferrin blocks the binding of RBD to the surface of epithelial cells.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind to heparan
sulfate expressed on the host cell surfaces [5]. We reasoned that this phenomenon
might explain the observed binding of RBD to NCI-H460 epithelial cells in the absence
of ACE2 and NRP1. To confirm this interaction, we blocked cellular HS with human
lactoferrin (LF), a natural glycoprotein that binds to HS and presents antiviral activity
against coronaviruses [11, 27]. Figure 4 shows that LF was able to reduce the
attachment of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to Vero E6 (Figure 4a) and NCI-H460 (Figure
4b) on a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the degree of blockade by lower doses
of LF was higher on NCI-H460 compared to Vero E6 cells.
Hypoxia decreases the total level of heparan sulfate on the surface of epithelial
cells.
Considering that cellular HS mediates the binding of RBD even in NCI-H460 cells
lacking the expression of ACE2 and NRP1, we explored if this interaction was altered
by hypoxia. Hypoxia significantly decreases the total level of cellular HS present on

Vero E6 cells (Figure 5a) and, to a higher extent, on NCI-H460 cells (Figure 5b). The
syndecan family is a major contributor to the pool of HS on the surface of cells. In this
context, we assessed the expression levels of syndecan-1, syndecan-2, syndecan-3
and syndecan-4 on NCI-H460 cells. We found that syndecan-1 and syndecan-3 are the
main syndecans expressed on this cell model and that hypoxia significantly reduces
their expression at protein level (Figure 5c).
Hypoxia reduces the binding of RBD to NCI-H460 epithelial cells by
downregulating syndecan-1 expression on a HIF-1α dependent mechanism.
Based on the finding that syndecan-1 is the most abundantly expressed syndecan on
NCI-H460 cells (Figure 5c), we sought to ascertain its role on the attachment of the
spike protein to host cells. Figure 6a shows that NCI-H460 cells expressing high levels
of syndecan-1 capture higher amounts of RBD compared to cells expressing low levels
of syndecan-1. To further demonstrate the binding of RBD to syndecan-1, we
generated a cell line with reduced expression of syndecan-1 via CRISPR/Cas9 (SDC1KO). A pool of SDC1-edited cells binds less RBD compared to control NCI-H460 cells
(Figures 6b). Given that HIF-1α is the main transcriptional mediator of the response to
hypoxia, we checked if it was responsible for the observed downregulation of
syndecan-1 under hypoxia (Figure 5c and 6c). To this end, we generated HIF-1α
deficient NCI-H460 cells via CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure 6d). Deletion of HIF-1α on NCIH460 cells partially rescued the observed inhibition of syndecan-1 expression under
hypoxia (Figure 6e), resulting in a marked increase in the total levels of cellular HS
(Figure 6f). Consequently, the level of RBD binding to HIF1-KO cells under hypoxia
was higher than in control HIF-1α competent cells (Figure 6g).
Discussion
COVID-19 disease is associated with hypoxia [12, 22, 28], which results on decreased
oxygen availability for tissues. This phenomenon affects the susceptibility of host cells
to viral infections [29] and shapes immune responses [30]. Here we describe the
binding ability of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 to epithelial cells cultured under different
oxygen concentrations. We show that hypoxia inhibits the binding of the RBD of SARSCoV-2 to host cells by modulating the expression of several entry and attachment
factors.
In this study we consider two different and complementary cellular models. First, Vero
E6 cells, a widely used cell type in SARS-CoV biology research because of its
expression of ACE2, NRP1 and TMPRSS2 factors, which are components of the
cellular machinery that allow the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target cells. Second, NCIH460 human lung epithelial cells, which lack the expression of ACE2 and NRP1 and as
such, do not get infected by pseudotyped viral particles expressing the spike of SARSCoV-2, but permits the binding of the spike and RBD to cellular heparan sulfate [11,
31]. This dual approach allowed us to investigate the mechanism underlying the
observed reduction of RBD binding and infectivity.
Using the Vero E6 model we showed that prolonged hypoxia reduces the expression
levels of cell surface ACE2 and NRP1, resulting in a reduced susceptibility to infection

by pseudotyped viral particles expressing the spike of SARS-CoV-2. Cellular HS is
known to cooperate with the entry receptor ACE2 as an attachment factor, facilitating
the initial capture of viral particles by the cellular glycocalyx [5]. We used NCI-H460
human lung epithelial cells to disentangle the contribution of HS to the observed
reduction of infection under hypoxia on an ACE2-independent manner.
First, we confirmed that the RBD binds to HS expressed on target cells by blocking this
interaction with lactoferrin (LF). Vero E6 cells were less sensitive than NCI-H460 cells
to the blockade exerted by low doses of LF, difference that could be attributed to the
interaction of RBD with other cellular components that are absent in NCI-H460 cells,
such as ACE2 and NRP1. These findings prompted us to use NCI-H460 cells as a
model to assess the effect of hypoxia on the levels of cellular HS and its interaction
with the spike of SARS-CoV-2.
We showed that hypoxia leads to a significant reduction of the cellular pool of HS on
NCI-H460 cells. Interestingly, syndecan-1, which is expressed in the lung [10], is
responsible for this decrease under hypoxia. We confirmed this finding by measuring
the binding of RBD to cells expressing different amounts of syndecan-1. We then
wanted to ascertain if HIF-1α was responsible for the reduction of the expression of
syndecan-1 observed under hypoxia. Ablation of HIF-1α in NCI-H460 cells
demonstrates that HIF-1α is necessary for the inhibition of syndecan-1 expression
under hypoxia. Moreover, deletion of HIF-1α results in an increase of cellular HS levels
and higher binding capacity of RBD to hypoxic NCI-H460 cells.
Together, these results indicate that the hypoxia response governed by HIF-1α leads to
a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, the administration of
HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors (PHD) that gives place to the accumulation of HIF-1α
may serve as a potential treatment of COVID-19 [32, 33].
In summary, we show that hypoxia decreases the binding of the spike to epithelial cells
by at least two different mechanisms: 1) decreasing the level of ACE2 and NRP1
expression; and 2) reducing the total amount of HS (attachment factor) and syndecan-1
on the cell surface of epithelial cells.
Limitations of the study
All experiments presented here have been performed in vitro with immortalized cell
lines. The significance of these findings at physiopathological oxygen levels in vivo
remains unexplored. In this context, the use of humanized mouse models and real
SARS-CoV-2 virus would reinforce the findings of this study.
