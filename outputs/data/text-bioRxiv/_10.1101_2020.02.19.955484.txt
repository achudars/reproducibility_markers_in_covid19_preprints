As of early March, 2019-nCoV has infected more than one hundred
thousand people and claimed thousands of lives. 2019-nCoV is a
novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for any form
of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell
epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody
binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified
405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both
human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing Bcell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral
genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with
good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present
near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine
candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV
experimental data.

oronaviruses (CoV) first became widely known after the
emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
in 2002. They are are positive, single-strand RNA viruses that
often infect birds and a variety of mammals and sometimes migrate to humans (1). While coronaviruses that infect humans
usually present mild symptoms (e.g. 15% of cases involving
the common cold are caused by a coronavirus), several previous outbreaks, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS) (2), have caused significant fatalities in
infected populations (3).
In December 2019, several patients with a connection in
Wuhan, China developed symptoms of viral pneumonia. Sequencing of viral RNA determined that these cases were caused
by a novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2
(4, 5). The virus has infected more than 100,000 people across
100 countries as of March 7th 2020 according to a World Health
Organization report (6). COVID-19, the disease caused by
2019-nCoV, has led to the deaths of thousands of patients and
is clearly transmissible between humans (3).
The deployment of a vaccine against 2019-nCoV would
arrest its infection rate and help protect vulnerable populations. However, no vaccine has yet passed beyond clinical
trails for any coronavirus, whether in humans or other animals
(7, 8). In animal models, inactivated whole virus vaccines
without focused immune epitopes offer incomplete protection
(8). Vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also resulted in hypersensitivity and immunopathologic responses in
mice (7, 9). The diversity among coronavirus strains presents
another challenge (1, 9), as there are at least 6 distinct subgroups in the coronavirus genus. And while SARS-CoV and
2019-nCoV share the same subgroup (2b), their genomes are

only 77% identical (4). Understanding the shared and unique
epitopes of 2019-nCoV will help the field design better vaccines
or diagnostic tests for patients.
Both humoral immunity provided by B-cell antibodies and
cellular immunity provided by T-cells are essential for effective
vaccines (10, 11). Though humans can usually mount an
antibody response against viruses, only neutralizing antibodies
can fully block the entry of viruses into human cells (12).
The location of antibody binding sites on a viral protein
strongly affects the body’s ability to produce neutralizing
antibodies; for example, HIV has buried surface proteins that
protect themselves from human antibodies (13). For this
reason, it would be valuable to understand whether 2019nCoV has potential antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes)
near their interacting surface with its known human entry
receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).
Beyond neutralizing antibodies, human bodies also rely
upon cytotoxic CD8 T-cells and helper CD4 T-cells to fully
clear viruses. The presentation of viral peptides by human
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC or HLA) class I
and class II is essential for anti-viral T-cell responses (14).
In contrast to B-cell epitopes, T-cell epitopes can be located
anywhere in a viral protein since human cells can process and
present both intracellular and extracellular viral peptides (15).
These immunology principles guide the design of our current
study (Fig. 1). First we focus on T-cell epitopes. 2019-nCoV
carries 4 major structural proteins—spike (S), membrane (M),
envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N)—and at least 6 other open
reading frames (ORFs) (1, 16). All protein fragments have the
potential to be presented by MHC-I or MHC-II and recognized
by T-cells. We apply NetMHCpan4 (17) and MARIA (15),
two artificial neural network algorithms, to predict antigen

Significance Statement
The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100
countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate
need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger
responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes).
Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of
human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through
an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein
that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more
likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a
potential form of immune evasion. Our computational pipeline
is validated with experimental data from SARS-CoV.

across HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DR alleles, both
at a medium threshold (Fig. 2A), and at a high threshold
(Fig. 2B). Consistent with the similar finding from SARSCoV, proteins ORF1AB, S, and E contain high numbers of
presentable antigen sequences across both MHC-I and MHC-II
(8). These highly presentable peptides on functional viral proteins provide a candidate pool for T-cell epitope identifications
and epitope-focused vaccine design. The presentation scores
of individual antigen peptides can be found in SI Appendix,
Supplementary Tables 5 and 6.
NetMHCpan4 predicts that a larger number of 2019-nCoV
protein sequences can be presented by HLA-C alleles across all
genes (Fisher’s exact test, p = 4.2e−59 ) compared to HLA-A
or HLA-B (Table 1). Specifically, ORF1ab (p = 6.7e−54 ), S
(p = 1.4e−9 ), ORF3a (p = 0.01), and M (p = 0.025) can be
better presented by HLA-C alleles after Bonferroni correction.

and at least 6 other open reading frames (ORFs). The S protein is a target for
antibodies and we model its 3D structure with Discotope2 to identify likely binding
sites (B-cell epitopes). We scan peptide sequences from individual viral proteins with
NetMHCPan4 and MARIA for MHC-I and MHC-II presentation to identify potential
T-cell epitopes. Our MHC-I analysis include common alleles for HLA-A, HLA-B, and
HLA-C, and our MHC-II analysis include common alleles of HLA-DR.

presentation and identify potential T-cell epitopes.
Next we focus on B-cell epitopes. The spike (S) protein
is the main trans-membrane glycoprotein expressed on the
surface of 2019-nCoV and is responsible for receptor binding
and virion entry to cells (1, 18). We narrow our B-cell epitope
search to S protein since it is the most likely target of human
neutralizing antibodies. We first perform homology modeling
to estimate the full 2019-nCoV spike protein structure and
compare our results to partially solved spike protein structures
(18–20). Discopte2 uses a combination of amino acid sequences
and protein surface properties to predict antibody binding
sites given a protein structure (21). We use this tool to identify
potential 2019-nCoV B-cell epitopes as the co-crystal structure
of 2019-nCoV’s spike protein and antibody is not yet available.
Finally, we examine the viral mutation pattern. Global
sequencing efforts (22) have enabled us to obtain a cohort of
68 2019-nCoV genomes from four continents. Based on the
resulting viral mutation profile, we examine whether mutations
are driven by the immune selection pressure. Highly mutated
regions might be excluded from the vaccine candidate pool.

T-cell epitope validation. To estimate the ability of antigen
presentation scores to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell epitopes, we
performed a validation study with known SARS-CoV CD8 and
CD4 T-cell epitopes (Fig. 3). From 4 independent experimental studies (23–26), we identified known CD8 T-cell epitopes
(MHC-I, n=17) and known CD4 T-cell epitopes (MHC-II,
n=3). We also obtained known non-epitopes (n=1236 and
246) for CD4, while for CD8 we include all 9mer sliding windows of S protein without a known epitope as non-epitopes.
MHC-I presentation (with recommended cut-off 98% (17)) has
a sensitivity of 82.3%, specificity of 97.0% and an AUC of 0.98
(Fig. 3A). MHC-II presentation (recommended cut-off 95%
(15)) has a sensitivity of 66.6%, specificity of 91.1% and an
AUC of 0.83 (Fig. 3B).
Given the high similarity between SARS-CoV and 2019nCoV proteins, we expect our analysis on 2019-nCoV to perform similarly against future experimentally validated T-cell
epitopes. The detailed scores and sequences of this analysis
can be found in SI Appendix, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8.
Viral mutation and antigen presentation. Human immune selection pressure has been shown to drive viral mutations which
evade immune surveillance (e.g. low MHC presentation). We
hypothesize that a similar phenomenon can occur in 2019nCoV. We curated a cohort of 68 viral genomes across four
continents and identified 93 point mutations, 2 nonsense mutation and 1 deletion mutation compared to the published
reference genome (5). We plot point mutations against regions
of MHC-I or MHC-II presentation in Fig. 4. The full protein sequence and mutation information can be found in SI
Appendix, Dataset S2 and S3.
Mutations occur in most genes with the exception of E,
ORF6, ORF7b, and N. We identify a recurrent mutation
L84S in ORF8 in 20 samples. Mutations are more likely to
occur in regions with MHC-I presentation (Fischer’s exact
test, p = 0.02). No relationship was observed with MHC-II
(p = 0.58) or an aggregate of MHC-I and MHC-II (p = 0.14).
This is consistent with the role of CD8 T-cell in clearing
infected cells and mutations supporting the evasion of immune
surveillance (27).
We identified two nonsense mutations (ORF1AB T15372A
and ORF7A C184T) in two viral samples from Shenzhen,
China (EPI_ISL_406592 and EPI_ISL_406594). ORF7A
C184U causes an immediate stop gain and a truncation of
the last 60 amino acids from the ORF7A gene, which can be

that can present a 9mer or 15mer viral peptide starting from a given position. A peptide being presented by more than one third of common alleles (red) is considered to be high
coverage.

Fig. 3. Validation of NetMHCpan and MARIA for T-cell epitope identification with SARS-CoV S protein epitopes. NetMHCpan4 and MARIA presentation percentiles
were used to differentiate experimentally identified CD8 T-cell epitopes (MHC-I, n=17)(23–25) and CD4 T-cell epitopes (MHC-II, n=3)(26) from negative peptides (n=1236
and 246). Negative peptides for CD8 T-cell epitopes are all 9mer sliding windows of S protein without a reported epitope. Negative peptides for CD4 T-cell epitopes are
experimentally tested. (A) NetMHCpan4 has a sensitivity of 82.3% and specificity of 97.0% with a 98th presentation percentile cut-off, and an overall AUC of 0.98. (B) MARIA

presented by multiple MHC alleles as indicated in our heatmap
(Fig. 4). In a sample from Japan (EPI_ISL_407084), the
viral gene ORF1AB loses nucleotides 94-118, which code for
GDSVEEVL. An associated antigen FGDSVEEVL is predicted
to be good presented by multiple MHC-I alleles (e.g. 99.9%
for HLA-C*08:01, 99.2% for HLA-C*01:02, and 99.0% for
HLA-B*39:01).
In summary, we observed that 2019-nCoV mutations often
occur among or delete presentable peptides, a potential form
of immune evasion. Patient MHC allele information and Tcell profiling are needed to better assess this phenomenon.
However, patients typically carry fewer than 3 mutations, so a
vaccine against multiple epitopes will not be nullified by such
a small number of mutations.
Potential B-cell epitopes of 2019-nCoV. We obtained the likely
3D structure of the full 2019-nCoV’s spike protein (SI Appendix, Dataset S4 and S5) by homology modeling with SARSCoV’s spike protein (31). Given our understanding of SARS
(32), the spike protein has two major conformations: up and
down. The down position is more stable but less accessible
to human entry receptors (e.g. ACE2). The receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the protein undergoes hinge-like conformational change to enter the up conformation, which is less stable
but more accessible to human receptors (31). We compared our
homology modeled structures to a later solved Cryo-EM structure (18) and found high similarity (Appendix SI, Fig. S1).
Notably, the Cryo-EM solved structure has missing residues
in the RBD due to limited electron density. Using modeled
structures overcomes this issue.
We scanned spike protein structures with Discotope2 to
identify potential antibody binding sites on the protein surface
(Figs. 5 and 6). For the SARS-CoV S protein down confor4

mation, we identified a strong cluster of antibody sites (>30
residues, pink or red) on the receptor binding domain (RBD,
the ACE2 interacting surface). Three independent studies
(28–30) discovered B-cell epitopes in this region (blue) with a
combination of in vitro and ex vivo approaches. Additionally,
Discotope2 identifies residue 541-555 as another binding site,
which was supported by two independent studies (Fig. 5A,
blue) (29, 30). This gives us some confidence in the ability
of Discotope2 to predict B-cell epitopes if given a unknown
protein structure.
For the 2019-nCoV S protein down conformation, Discotope2 identified a similar antibody binding site on the S protein potential RBD, but with fewer residues (17 residues,
Fig. 5B). Residues 440-460 and 494-506 located at the top of
the RBD show strong antibody binding properties (>0.5 raw
scores). Discotope2 also identified another antibody binding
site (residue 246-257) different from SARS-CoV but with lower
scores (>-2.5 raw scores).
For the 2019-nCoV S protein up conformation, Discotope2
identified similar antibody binding sites compared to down
conformation (440-460 and 494-506, Fig. 6). We wanted to
explore whether these two linear epitopes are critical for viral
interaction with the human entry protein ACE2. After our
original analysis, two solved co-crystal structures of 2019-nCoV
S protein RBD and human ACE2 become available (19, 20).
We ran Discotope2 and obtained strikingly similar results
(Fig. 6C and D). The main antibody binding site substantially
overlaps with the interacting surface where ACE2 (yellow)
binds to S protein, so an antibody binding to this surface is
likely to block viral entry into cells.
Mutations in key antibody binding sites can help viruses
evade the human immune system. We identified 8 point mutation sites on S protein from a cohort of 68 2019-nCoV samples

Table 2. Top potential epitopes for key 2019-nCoV proteins. We ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by MHC-I and
MHC-II alleles. S protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on MHC presentation and is also one of the predicted top B-cell epitopes, localized
near the S protein receptor binding domain (Fig. 5). MHC-I coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest MHC-I coverage for each
epitope (highlighted in orange). All candidates are likely to be presented by both MHC-I and MHC-II. “SARS” under the antibody column
indicates that one or more SARS homolog of this peptide is a known B-cell epitope.

Fig. 5. Predicted B-cell epitopes on SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV spike (S) protein "down" position. 3D structures of both spike proteins in "down" position were scanned
with Discotope2 to assess potential antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes). Red indicates residues with score > 0.5 (cut-off for specificity of 90%), and pink indicates residues
with score > -2.5 (cut-off for specificity of 80%). (A) The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS spike protein has concentrated high score residues and is comprised of two
linear epitopes. One additional binding site is predicted to be around residue 541-555. Three independent experimental studies (28–30) identify patient antibodies recognize
these three linear epitopes (blue). (B) Modeled 2019-nCoV spike protein is predicted to have a similar strong antibody binding site near RBD and an additional site around
residue 246-257. (C) The predicted antibody binding site on 2019-nCov RBD potentially overlaps with the interacting surface for the known human entry receptor ACE2 (yellow).
(D) Eight 2019-nCoV spike protein point mutations are present in a cohort of 68 viral samples. No mutations are near the ACE2 interacting surface. One mutation (S247R)
occurs near one of the predicted antibody binding sites (residue 246-257).

(Fig. 5D). All mutations are distant from the S protein RBD,
and one mutation (S247R) occurs near one of the predicted
minor antibody binding site (residue 246-257).
In summary, we observed major structural and B-cell epitope similarity between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV spike proteins. RBDs in both proteins seem to be important B-cell
epitopes for neutralizing antibodies, however, SARS-CoV appears to have larger attack surface than 2019-nCoV (Fig. 5A,
5B). Fortunately, we have not observed any mutations altering
binding sites for this major B-cell epitope in 2019-nCoV.

standing the landscape of T-cell and B-cell epitopes of 2019nCoV, we summarize our results in Table 2 for promising
candidates for 2019-nCoV vaccines. Ideal antigens should be
presented by multiple MHC-I and MHC-II alleles in a general
population and contain linear B-cell epitopes associated with
neutralizing antibodies. Specifically, we first identified regions
with high coverage of MHC-II, then ranked them based on
their MHC-I coverage. We further search these top candidates
with 90% sequence similarity on IEDB (33) to assess whether
any candidate has been previously reported for being a B-cell
epitope or T-cell epitope.
Around 1000 peptide 15mers can be presented by a wide
range of MHC-II (>33%), which is consistent with our knowledge about promiscuity of MHC-II presentation (15, 34).
When further requiring a peptide to be presented by more
than 33% or 66% of common MHC-I alleles, we narrowed the
results to 405 or 44 promising T-cell epitopes, respectively
(SI Appendix, Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). The top 13
candidates in key viral proteins can be presented by 52-83%
of MHC-I alleles (Table 2). Most notably, S protein 494-508
is not only a good MHC presenter but also a predicted B-cell
epitope near the S protein receptor binding domain (Fig. 5B),
which indicates a good vaccine candidate.
When searching these 13 candidates on IEDB, we observed
several of their homologous peptides in SARS are T-cell and
B-cell epitopes. SARS peptide SIVAYTMSL is similar to
2019-nCoV peptide SQSIIAYMSLGAEN and elicits T-cell
responses in chromium cytotoxicity assays (35). Previously
discovered SARS B-cell epitopes LMSFPQAAPHGVVFLHV
(36), ASFRLFARTRSMWSF(37), KRTATKQYNVTQAFGRR (38), and SRVKNLNSSEGVPDLLV (39) share high
homology with 2019-nCoV S protein 1056-1060, M 97-111, N
264-278, and E 52-66. These search results support validity of
our computational pipeline.

Discussion
In summary, we analyzed the 2019-nCoV viral genome for
epitope candidates and found 405 likely T-Cell epitopes, with
strong MHC-I and MHC-II presentation scores, as well as 2
potential neutralizing B-Cell epitopes on the S protein. We
validated our methodology by running a similar analysis on
SARS-CoV against known SARS T-cell and B-cell epitopes.
Analyzing viral mutations across 68 patient samples we found
that they have a tendency to occur in regions with strong
MHC-I presentation, a possible form of immune evasion. However, no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor
binding domain, which is critical for viral entrance to cells
and neutralizing antibody binding.
We observed that significant portions of 2019-nCoV viral
8

protein can be presented by multiple HLA-C alleles. This
might be due to relatively conserved HLA-C binding motif on
the 9th position (the main anchor residue) where Leucine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine are commonly favored across
alleles (40). HLA-C*07:02, HLA-C*01:02, and HLA-C*06:02
all have >10% allele frequency in the Chinese population (41).
This suggests the future epitope-based vaccines should include
HLA-C related epitopes beyond the common HLA-A*02:01
and HLA-B*40:01 approach.
Similar to SARS-CoV (1, 8), the 2019-nCoV spike protein is
likely to be immunogenic as it carries a number of both T-cell
and B-cell epitopes. Recombinant surface protein vaccines have
demonstrated strong clinical utilities in hepatitis B and human
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (11, 42). A recombinant 2019nCoV spike protein vaccine combined with other top epitopes
and an appropriate adjuvant could be a reasonable next step
for 2019-nCoV vaccine development. Recently, two biotech
companies Moderna and Inovio have announced early clinical
trials for spike protein based vaccines.
From an economic perspective, the development of coronavirus vaccines faces significant financial hurdles as most
such viruses do not cause endemic infections. After an epidemic episode (e.g. SARS) there is little financial incentive
for private companies to develop vaccines against a specific
strain of virus (2, 8, 10). To address these incentive issues,
governments might provide greater funding support to create
vaccines against past and future outbreaks.
Our pipeline provides a framework to identify strong
epitope-based vaccine candidates and might be applied against
any unknown pathogens. We were able to model structures
of 2019-nCoV spike protein as soon as the DNA sequence became available, and the modeled structure has high similarity
with later solved crystal structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
This suggests the researchers can rely on homology remodeling
when emerging pathogens first appear if the new pathogen
shares high sequence similarity with an existing pathogen.
Previous animal studies show antigens with high MHC presentation scores are more likely to elicit strong T-cell responses,
but the correlation between these responses and vaccine efficacy is relatively weak (7, 14, 43). When combined with
future clinical data, our work can help the field untangle the
relationship between antigen presentation and vaccine efficacy.

We obtained 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2019) and SARS-CoV reference sequence data from NCBI GeneBank (NC_045512 and
NC_004718) (4, 16). We obtained viral sequences associated with
68 patients from GISAID on Feb 1st 2020.
We broke each gene sequence in 2019-nCoV into sliding windows
and used NetMHCpan4 (17) and MARIA (15) to predict MHC-I
and MHC-II presentation scores across 32 MHC alleles common
in the Chinese population (41). We marked a peptide sequence as
covered by MHC-I and MHC-II if it is presented by more then 33%
of constituent alleles. For validation, we applied our methodology
to known SARS T-cell epitopes and non-epitopes.
We predicted likely human antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes) on SARS and 2019-nCoV S protein with Disctope2 (21)
after first obtaining an approximate 3D structure of 2019-nCoV S
protein by homology modeling SARS S protein (PDB: 6ACC) with
SWISS-MODEL (31, 44). To validate our B-cell epitope predictions,
we compared our top 3 B-cell epitopes for SARS S protein with
previously experimentally identified epitopes (28–30).
For mutation identification, we translated viral genome sequences
from patients into protein sequences and compared them with the
