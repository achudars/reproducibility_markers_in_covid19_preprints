Abstract

16

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several

17

animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease

18

spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis

19

of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show

20

that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme

21

2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that

22

infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104

23

TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and

24

uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from

25

the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal

26

tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with

27

high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial

28

pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes,

29

were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in

30

macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory

31

cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral

32

cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory

33

response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests

34

that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure

35

development.

Authors Summary

39

The disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While

40

several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal

41

models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we

42

show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with

43

SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower

44

respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The

45

pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance

46

to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19

47

pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.

Introduction

50

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Hubai province in

51

mainland China in December 2019, and is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease (COVID)-

52

19 (1). SARS-CoV-2 can cause asymptomatic to severe lower respiratory tract infections in

53

humans, with early clinical signs including fever, cough and dyspnea (2, 3). Progression to severe

54

disease may be marked by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with pulmonary edema,

55

bilateral diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation (4-6). Although primarily a

56

respiratory tract infection, extra-respiratory replication of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in

57

kidney, heart, liver and brain in fatal cases (7-9). Several experimental animal models for SARS-

58

CoV-2 infection have been developed, including hamsters (10) ferrets (11) and non-human primate

59

models (12-15). SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity within these animal models ranges only from mild to

60

moderate (10-15). Additional small animal models that recapitulate more severe disease

61

phenotypes and lethal outcome are urgently needed for the rapid pre-clinical development of

62

medical countermeasures. Although the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is able to utilize hamster

63

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor of cell entry (10, 16), lack of species-

64

specific reagents limit the usability of this model. As SARS-CoV-2 is unable to effectively utilize

65

murine (m)ACE2 (17, 18), several models are currently under development to overcome this

66

species barrier using a variety of strategies including transiently expressed human (h)ACE2,

67

CRISPR/Cas9 modified mACE2, exogenous delivery of hACE2 with a replication-deficient viral

68

vector and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (19-23).

69

K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were originally developed as a small animal model for lethal SARS-

70

CoV infection. Expression of hACE2 is driven by a cytokeratin promoter in the airway epithelial

71

cells as well as in epithelia of other internal organs, including the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal

72

tract and brain. Infection with SARS-CoV led to severe interstitial pneumonia and death of the

73

animals by day 7 post inoculation (20). Here, we assess the susceptibility of K18-hACE2

74

transgenic mice as a model of severe COVID-19.

Results

77

Disease manifestation in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated K18-hACE2 mice

78

First, we determined the disease progression after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. Two groups of 4-6

79

week-old K18-hACE2 transgenic male and female mice (15 each) were intranasally inoculated

80

with 104 (low dose group) and 105 (high dose group) TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, respectively. In

81

addition, one control group of two mice was intranasally inoculated with 105 TCID50 γ-irradiated

82

SARS-CoV-2.

83

Irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 inoculation dose, mice uniformly started losing weight at 2 days post

84

inoculation (DPI) (Fig 1a), with a significantly higher weight loss observed in the low dose group,

85

suggesting a dose-response relationship, (p = 0.02, Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test). No

86

difference in weight loss between male and female animals within the same dose group was

87

detected (S1a Fig). In addition to weight loss, lethargy, ruffled fur, hunched posture and labored

88

breathing were observed throughout the course of infection in each animal. Mice were monitored

89

for signs of neurological disease (circling, rolling, hyperexcitability, convulsions, tremors,

90

weakness, or flaccid paralysis of hind legs), and no neurological symptoms were observed in any

91

of the animals. Within the high dose group all animals reached euthanasia criteria by 7 DPI,

92

however, in the low dose group five out of six animals reached euthanasia criteria 5-9 DPI and one

93

animal recovered (Fig 1b). Although, no sex-dependent differences in survival were observed

94

between male and female mice, the animal size used in this study was too small to draw major

95

conclusions (S1b Fig). The control animals inoculated with γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 did not lose

96

weight and remained free of disease symptoms.

97
98

Viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated K18-hACE mice

99

To gain an understanding of dose-dependent virus shedding patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in infected

100

K18-hACE2 mice, daily nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were obtained until 11 DPI. Viral

101

RNA was detected in all three. SARS-CoV-2 shedding from the respiratory tract was observed in

102

all inoculated animals. Viral load in oropharyngeal and nasal swabs reached up to ~106 and ~107

103

copies/mL, respectively, and viral RNA could be detected up to 7 and 8 DPI. Rectal shedding was

104

observed in both inoculated groups, but not in all animals, and was lower compared to respiratory

105

shedding. Importantly, no viral RNA could be detected in swabs obtained from control mice

106

inoculated with γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2, suggesting viral RNA detected as early as 1 DPI was

107

directly associated with active virus replication and did not originate from inoculum (Fig 1c). No

108

sex-dependent differences in shedding pattern were seen (S1c Fig).

109
110

Tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2-inoculated K18-hACE mice

111

We next assessed tissue tropism and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice (Fig

112

2a). Viral genomic RNA was detected in almost all tissues; however, no viremia was observed. At

113

3 and 7 DPI, the highest viral load was found in lung tissue (~1010 genome copies/g). Viral RNA

114

in brain tissue was increased at 7 DPI compared to 3 DPI (from ~105 to 1010 genome copies/g) (Fig

115

2a). When assessing infectious virus, at 3 DPI, it was only detected in respiratory tract tissues,

116

with high infectious titers observed in nasal epithelium and lungs in both the low dose and high

117

dose groups. At 7 DPI, infectious virus was detected in respiratory tract as well as brain tissue

118

(Figs 2b). Together, these data suggest that either SARS-CoV-2 is initially exclusively targets the

119

respiratory tract in K18-hACE2 mice with secondary central nervous system (CNS) involvement

120

or the virus replicates slower in the brain and only detected after 3 DPI.

Histological changes and viral antigen distribution in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated K18-hACE

123

mice

124

On 3 and 7 DPI, four animals from each group were euthanized and necropsies were performed.

125

On both days, gross lung lesions were observed in all animals with up to 80% of the lungs affected

126

by 7 DPI. Histologically, all animals developed pulmonary pathology after inoculation with

127

SARS-CoV-2. Lungs showed interstitial pneumonia at 3 DPI characterized by a generalized

128

perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophages and

129

lymphocytes; alveolar septal thickening, and distinctive vascular system injury (Fig 3a-3c). At 7

130

DPI, mice developed pulmonary pathology consisting of multifocal interstitial pneumonia

131

characterized by type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, septal, alveolar and perivascular inflammation

132

comprised of lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, variable amounts of alveolar fibrin and

133

edema, frequent syncytial cells and single cell necrosis. Terminal bronchioles were similarly

134

affected and in the most severely affected areas fibrin and necrosis occluded the lumen (Fig 3e-

135

3g). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated viral antigen in pneumocytes and macrophages

136

of tissues on both 3 and 7 DPI (Fig 3d-3h).

137

We evaluated the localized infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cell populations at 3 and 7

138

DPI, as compared to control animals and the survivor at 21 DPI. An absence of immunoreactive

139

macrophages (CD68+) in the γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 inoculated controls was noted (Fig 4a). In

140

contrast, in lung tissue of infected animals, an infiltration of a limited number of macrophages at

141

3 and 7 DPI was seen, which persisted in the survivor up until 21 DPI (Fig 4 d, g and j). We next

142

assessed lymphocyte infiltration into the lung in more detail. T cells were present in low numbers

143

in the non-infected control (Fig 4b). At 3 DPI T cells numbers increases in perivascular tissue and

144

alveolar septa and persisted through 7 DPI. B cells were present in low numbers in the γ-irradiated

145

SARS-CoV-2 inoculated controls and at 3 DPI, increased numbers were observed in alveolar septa.

146

B cells persisted through 7 DPI, when they started to cluster and form aggregates. At 21 DPI, T

147

cells were found throughout the whole lung section and formation of lymphoid aggregates with B

148

cells in perivascular tissues was observed in the survivor (Fig 4e, h and k). Interestingly, this

149

animal also still demonstrated mildly inflamed alveolar septa which were often accompanied by

150

foamy macrophages within affected alveoli (S2 Fig).

151

Both SARS-CoV-2 inoculated groups showed only limited lesions in the nasal turbinates at 3 and

152

7 DPI (Fig 5a-5b). IHC showed multifocal SARS-CoV-2 antigen in ciliated respiratory epithelial

153

cells (Fig 5c-5d).

154

At 3 DPI all brains were histologically normal (Fig 6a-6b). However, 7 DPI brain tissues showed

155

lesions raging from minimal to moderate and included lymphocytic perivascular cuffing, gliosis,

156

meningitis, encephalitis and microthrombi, a generalized increase in cellularity of the meninges,

157

cerebral cortex and hippocampus and presence of edema (Fig 6c-6d). Abundant SARS-CoV-2

158

antigen was detected in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus within neurons and glial cells along

159

the soma and axons (Fig 6e-6f). In addition, cerebral cortex contained microthrombi and an

160

increased glial cell count, infiltration of inflammatory cells and scant hemorrhage (Fig 6g-6f).

161
162

Rapid humoral immune response in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated K18-hACE mice

163

We next investigated two key aspects of the anti-viral immune response. To assess B-cell response

164

and class-switch, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM

165

antibodies in serum obtained at 3 and 7 DPI was investigated using ELISA. By 3 DPI, one mouse

166

in the high dose group was positive for IgM and no mice were positive for IgG. In contrast, both

167

spike-specific IgM and IgG were found in sera of all mice at 7 DPI (Fig 7a). IgM and IgG titers of

168

one surviving animal at 21 DPI were comparable to those at 7 DPI.

170

Rapid systemic upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in SARS-CoV-

171

2-inoculated K18-hACE mice

172

To investigate the immune response further we utilized serum multiplex cytokine analysis to

173

characterize the inflammatory status and identify key patterns. Interestingly, while serum cytokine

174

levels at 3 DPI showed only slight changes as compared to control animals, strong upregulation

175

was observed for multiple cytokines and chemokines by 7 DPI (Fig 7b). A strong increase in T

176

helper (Th)1-mediated cytokines interferon (IFN)-g (both doses, p = 0.0268, 0.0268) and tumour

177

necrosis factor (TNF)-a, (though not statistically significant) was observed. In addition, there was

178

also an upregulation of proinflammatory and chemoattractant cytokine IFN-g-induced protein (IP)-

179

10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL10)) (high dose, p = 0.0268). Interestingly, no trend of

180

upregulation of Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 was seen, but

181

increased levels of IL-10 were observed at DPI 7 in both groups, which has been shown to have an

182

anti-inflammatory regulatory function in mediating antiviral responses (24). In addition, granulocyte-

183

macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), KC (CXCL1) and monocyte chemoattractant

184

protein-1 (MCP-1 (C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL1)) were detected systemically and at increased

185

levels at 7 DPI, further indicating a systemic recruitment of inflammatory and innate immune cells to

186

sites of infection (Fig 3a and S2a Fig). Of note, this model did not recapitulate the increase of systemic

187

IL-6 observed in severe COVID-19 patients (25) in either dose or timepoint. When comparing the

188

overall cytokine profile of each animal, it became obvious that there was a stronger link between time

189

post inoculation than between the viral dose and the resulting cytokine upregulation. We observed 3

190

clusters, which showed a clear time-correlation and did not detect significant differences between

191

low and high dose inoculated animals (Fig 7c). Correlation of serum cytokine expression with lung

192

viral gRNA did not reveal any significant positive correlation (S2b Fig).

Discussion

195

In humans, COVID-19 has a broad clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease

196

(4-6, 25). Wildtype mice are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to an inability of

197

mACE2 to facilitate sufficient cellular entry (17, 18). Based on existing lethal mouse models for

198

SARS-CoV, first described by McCray and colleagues (20), several transgenic mouse models for

199

COVID-19 have been developed using expression of hACE2 (21, 26-29). However, mice

200

expressing hACE2 under the mACE2 promoter (21, 26) or exogenously transfected with hACE2

201

showed only moderate disease with slight weight loss, reduced lung pathology and no lethal

202

phenotype (27, 29). A mouse model expressing hACE2 under a lung ciliated epithelial cell HFH4

203

promoter exhibited generally only mild symptoms with lethality observed only in animals with

204

brain infection (28). In contrast, the K18-hACE2 mouse model described here, which expresses

205

hACE2 under the K18 epithelial promotor, displayed a high morbidity and mortality in both high

206

dose and low dose groups. These findings are corroborated by two other studies, currently in

207

preprint (30, 31), which demonstrate a similar disease phenotype in this model.

208

Previous experiments in different hACE2 mice have demonstrated varying degrees of lung

209

pathology upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 (19, 21-23). The K18-hACE2 mice developed

210

edema-associated acute lung injury similar to the clinical features of COVID-19 patients, including

211

histological aspects of ARDS. This is in line with observations made in HFH4-hACE2 mice and

212

mice expressing hACE2 under control of the murine ACE2 promotor, where viral RNA was also

213

detected in brain tissues (28). Severe COVID-19 is histologically characterized by diffuse alveolar

214

damage with hyaline membranes, edema, fibrin deposits, multinucleated cells, type II pneumocyte

215

hyperplasia and lymphocyte infiltration composed of a mixture of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes (32-

216

34). The analyses of the pathological response observed within the lungs of the SARS-CoV-2

217

infected mice resemble those observed in humans with regards to lesions and cell tropism.

218

In humans, systemic cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are comprised of TNF-α, IL-1β,

219

IL-1Rα, sIL-2Rα, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, IFN-γ, MCP-3, M-CSF, MIP-1α, G-CSF, IP-10, and

10

220

MCP-1 (35-37). In the lungs of aged hACE2 mice, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to elevated

221

cytokine production including Eotaxin, G-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-9, and MIP-1β (38). Here, we show that

222

SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice elicits a measurable systemic pro-inflammatory

223

cytokine response which is significantly increased at 7 DPI and characterized by an increase in

224

IFN-g, TNF-a and IP-10, and also encompasses upregulation of innate cell-recruiting chemokines

225

GM-CSF and MCP-1. Importantly, increased levels of IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1 and TNF-a are

226

associated with severity of disease in in COVID-19 patients (35, 39, 40). COVID-19 patients also

227

show heightened IL-4 and IL-10 levels, cytokines associated with inhibitory inflammatory

228

responses (41). While the K18-hACE2 model did not recapitulate IL-4 upregulation, increased IL-

229

10 levels were observed in serum, suggesting that both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine

230

response are functioning in this mouse model. This is particularly relevant, as in COVID-19, the

231

resulting cytokine storm is not only thought to be detrimental to disease progression but also

232

closely linked to the development of ARDS (39). In addition, cytokine levels are also reported to

233

be indicative of extrapulmonary multiple-organ failure (42, 43). Reports suggest that upregulation

234

of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α contributes to SARS-related ARDS (35, 44). Interestingly, while we did

235

observe the upregulation of TNF-α, IL-6 levels remained unchanged. This needs to be further

236

investigated to clarify if our observation suggests a differently modulated immune response and

237

pathogenesis that should be considered for intervention studies.

238

We have also demonstrated a functional humoral immune response and production of both IgM

239

and IgG antibodies. This is in line with observations made in ACE2-HB-01 mice where IgG

240

antibodies against spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were also observed (26). This indicates that the

241

K18-hACE2 mouse model mounts a robust innate and adaptive immune response.

242

The mouse model presented here recapitulates histopathological findings of COVID-19 associated

243

ARDS, a robust innate and adaptive immune-response, neurological involvement and, importantly,

244

presents a dose-dependent sub-lethal disease manifestation. As such, we believe this model to be

245

highly suitable for testing of SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures such as antiviral and immune-

246

modulatory interventions. However, COVID-19 associated ARDS in patients presents not just

247

with characteristic lung pathology, but also with clinical manifestations including hypoxia, loss of

248

lung compliance and requirement for intubation, liver and kidney involvement and associated

249

increase in serum protein levels, and decreased lymphocyte numbers. To accurately assess how

250

well K18-hACE2 mice recapitulates human ARDS, additional studies specifically addressing

251

these aspects are required.

265

Cells and virus

266

SARS-CoV-2 strain nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) was provided by CDC, Atlanta, USA. Virus

267

propagation was performed in VeroE6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum,

268

1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. VeroE6 cells were maintained

269

in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin

270

and 50 μg/mL streptomycin.

271
272

Animal experiments

273

Four to six week-old male and female (15 animals each) transgenic K18-hACE2 mice expressing

274

hACE2 (Jackson laboratories, USA, (20)) were inoculated intranasally (I.N.) with 25 µL sterile

275

Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing either 104 TCID50 (low dose group, n =

276

14), 105 TCID50 (high dose group, n = 14) or 105 TCID50 γ-irradiate (45) (control group, n = 2)

277

SARS-CoV-2. At 3 and 7 DPI, four mice from the low dose and high dose groups were euthanized,

278

respectively, and tissues were collected. The remaining mice were utilized for end-point data

279

collection and survival assessment. Mice were weighed and nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs

280

were taken daily. Mice were observed for survival up to 21 DPI or until they reached end-point

281

criteria. End-point criteria included several parameters of severe disease (increased respiratory

282

rate, hunched posture, ruffled fur and lethargy).

283
284

RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction

285

Samples were collected with prewetted swabs in 1 mL of DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL

286

penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Then, 140 µL was utilized for RNA extraction using the

287

QIAamp Viral RNA Kit (Qiagen) using QIAcube HT automated system (Qiagen) according to the

288

manufacturer's instructions with an elution volume of 150 µL. Tissues (up to 30 mg) were

289

homogenized in RLT buffer and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to

290

the manufacturer's instructions. Viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR (46). Five μL RNA was

291

tested with the Rotor-GeneTM probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer.

292

Ten-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 standards with known copy numbers were used to construct a

293

standard curve.

294
295

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

296

Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated with 50 ng spike protein per well and incubated overnight at

297

4°C. After blocking with casein in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (ThermoFisher) for 1 h at room

298

temperature (RT), serially diluted 2-fold serum samples (duplicate, in casein) were incubated for

299

1 h at RT. Spike-specific antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgM or IgG Fc

300

(horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated, Abcam) for 1 h at RT and visualized with KPL TMB

301

2-component peroxidase substrate kit (SeraCare, 5120-0047). The reaction was stopped with KPL

302

stop solution (Seracare) and read at 450 nm. Plates were washed 3x with PBS-T (0.1% Tween) in

303

between steps. The threshold for positivity was calculated as the average plus 3x the standard

304

deviation of negative control mouse sera.

305
306

Measurement of cytokines and chemokines

307

Serum samples were inactivated with γ-irradiation (2 mRad) and cytokine concentrations were

308

determined on a Bio-Plex 200 instrument (Bio-Rad) using Milliplex Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine

309

MAGNETIC BEAD Premixed 25 Plex Kit (Millipore), according to the manufacturer’s

310

instructions. Samples were pre-diluted 1:3 in the kit serum matrix (v:v). Concentrations below the

312

pheatmap (48) and corrplot (49) packages.

313
314

Histology and immunohistochemistry

315

Necropsies and tissue sampling were performed according to IBC-approved protocols. Harvested

316

tissues were fixed for eight days in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin,

317

processed using a VIP-6 Tissue Tek (Sakura Finetek, USA) tissue processor, and embedded in

318

Ultraffin paraffin polymer (Cancer Diagnostics, Durham, NC). Samples were sectioned at 5 µm,

319

and resulting slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Specific anti-CoV immunoreactivity

320

was detected using an in-house SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein rabbit antibody at a 1:1000

321

dilution. Macrophage (CD68) and T-cell (CD3) immunoreactivities were detected using CD68

322

rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at a 1:250 dilution and prediluted CD3 rabbit monoclonal

323

antibody (2GV6, Roche Tissue Diagnostics), respectively. For both CD68 and CD3, ImmPRESS-

324

VR Horse anti-rabbit polymer was used as the secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories). B-cell

325

(CD45) immunoreactivity was detected using anti CD45R rat monoclonal antibody (Abcam) at a

326

1:500 dilution and ImmPRESS goat anti-rat polymer (Vector Laboratories) as secondary

327

antibody. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was carried out on a Discovery ULTRA

328

automated staining instrument (Roche Tissue Diagnostics) with a Discovery ChromoMap DAB

329

(Ventana Medical Systems) kit. All tissue slides were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary

330

anatomic pathologist blinded to study group allocations.
