Abstract: Age is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in patients
following COVID-19 infection. We hypothesised that differential expression of genes
encoding proteins proposed to be required for entry of SARS-Cov-2 in aged
compared to younger cardiomyocytes might contribute to the susceptibility of older
individuals to COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications.
We generated strand-specific RNA-sequencing libraries from RNA isolated from
flow-sorted cardiomyocyte nuclei from left ventricular tissue. RNASeq data were
compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males
who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease
post-mortem.
Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E,
FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged
cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes
correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and
interferon/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1
and IL6R.
Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged
compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using
selective enzyme inhibitors/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or
clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for
compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in
human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.

Age (>70 years), case fatality rate (CFR,10.2%) and coexisting conditions,
particularly cardiovascular disease (CFR,10.5%) and hypertension (CFR,6.0%), are
independent predictors of adverse outcome for 45,000 COVID-19 patients in China1.
A consensus has emerged that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same ‘receptor’ as SARSCoV, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for initial binding to the host cell.
This must be co-expressed with the serine protease TMPRSS2, that primes the
spike protein S1 for endocytosis-mediated internalization of virus, employing the S2
domain for fusion to the host membrane (Figure [1A])2-4. A key difference in SARSCoV-2 is a spike protein second site (S2’), proposed to be cleaved by the proteinase
furin2. Once inside the cell cysteine proteases, cathepsin L and B, are thought critical
for endosomal processing in certain cells3,4.
In the cardiovascular system, ACE2 protein5 and mRNA6 are present in
cardiomyocytes. ACE2 normally functions as a carboxypeptidase cleaving single Cterminal amino acids thus hydrolysing Pro-Phe in Ang-II to Ang1-7, [Pyr1]-apelin-13 to
[Pyr1]-apelin(1-12) and des-Arg9-bradykinin to inactive bradykinin(1-8)4. Internalization of
ACE2 by virus potentially reduces the beneficial counter regulatory function of these
peptide products to the RAAS pathway2,4. Conversely, the serine protease ADAM17
cleaves ACE2 to release its ectodomain and this is stimulated by Ang-II and,
potentially, apelin acting via their respective G-protein coupled receptors7. Shed
ACE2 binds SARS-CoV-2, a complex predicted not to internalize, and therefore
circulating ACE2 could be exploited as a beneficial viral decoy substrate. Intriguingly,
ACE2 is highly expressed in the GI tract where it is associated with B0AT1
(SLC6A19) that actively transports most neutral amino acids across the apical
membrane of epithelial cells4,8. It is not yet known if B0AT1 and ACE2 are coexpressed in cardiomyocytes and represent an important mechanism of viral entry,
but they can form a heterodimer, with the ACE2 capable of binding the spike protein
S18. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), normally transiently produced, is elevated in serum and
positively correlated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients9.
We hypothesised that differential expression of genes encoding proteins in these
pathways in aged cardiomyocytes could explain why the myocardium of older
patients might be particularly vulnerable to the virus, manifesting as cardiovascular
complications such as myocarditis. To selectively analyse cardiomyocyte gene
expression, we generated strand-specific RNA-sequencing libraries from RNA

isolated from flow-sorted cardiomyocyte nuclei from left ventricular tissue10. RNASeq
data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr)
Caucasian males, not on medication, with no evidence of cardiovascular disease
post-mortem.
Viral entry, membrane fusion and endocytosis. The key finding (Figure [1B],
[1C]) is that expression of genes encoding proteins hypothesised as important for
viral entry, crucially including ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were upregulated in aged
cardiomyocytes, as well as TMPRS11E and TMPRS11D, (where function is less well
established), FURIN and cathepsins CTSL and CTSB. Importantly, while
B0AT1/SLC6A19 was minimally expressed in young cardiomyocytes it was
upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes. Moreover, combined relative cardiomyocyte
expression of these genes correlated positively with age (Figure [1D]).
ACE/ACE2 regulation. The expression of Ang-II synthetic enzyme ACE and
cognate receptor gene AGTR1 together with BDKBR1 increased with age, the latter
normally not expressed in myocytes until induced by inflammation and selectively
activated by des-Arg9-bradykinin (Figure [1B], [1E])9. Both are potentially deleterious
peptides, that we hypothesise would be increased by loss of cell surface ACE2
caused by viral internalization or ADAM17-mediated shedding. Expression of genes
encoding receptors for peptides that normally mediate beneficial counter-regulatory
effects to Ang-II in the heart, MAS1/Ang1-7, APLNR/apelin and BDKRB2/bradykinin
were both up and downregulated.
Inflammatory mediators and endogenous antiviral strategies. Penetration of
SARS-CoV-2 into lung alveoli, resulting in the ‘cytokine storm’ is a major determinant
for COVID-19 patient intubation and mortality. IL-6 is a key mediator4: its receptor
(IL6R) is expressed on cardiomyocytes, with a modest increase with age suggesting
anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibodies, currently in trials10 may prove cardioprotective.
Unlike most other cells, cardiomyocyte numbers remain stable, regenerating
slowly. Although particularly vulnerable to viral infection they have evolved intrinsic
mechanisms to combat cytotoxic effects and viral replication mainly by generating
type 1 interferon responses. SARS-CoV-2 counterattacks by producing proteins that
interfere with interferon pathways. While interferon receptor genes (IFNAR1/IFNAR2)
were expressed in cardiomyocytes, no pattern emerged with age.

Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in
aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. Our objective is to foster
confirmation (or rebuttal) by studies on relevant protein levels in cardiomyocytes and
using selective enzyme inhibitors/antagonists to dissect these pathways; available as
experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir has recently
been rapidly accepted for compassionate use
(https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/coronavirus.jsp). Drugs to treat both acute
and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 will need to focus on these three key stages of
infection: preventing the virus entering cells, stopping viral replication and reducing
resulting tissue damage, particularly in the hearts of aged individuals that are the
most vulnerable members of society to COVID-19.

Cathepsins B and L facilitate viral cell entry and internalization by endocytosis. Furin
may also have a role in this process. Internalization of the virus with ACE2 inhibits
ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity that normally hydrolyses Ang-II, [Pyr1]-apelin-13 and
des-Arg9-bradykinin. ADAM17, present on the cell surface, cleaves ACE2 to the
soluble form that circulates in the plasma and could act as a decoy substrate for the
virus. Levels of ADAM17 may be regulated by Ang-II and apelin acting via their
respective G-protein coupled receptors4.

synthetic enzyme ACE and the ANG-II cognate receptor gene AGTR1 increased with
age, together with B1 receptor gene, BDKBR1. This bradykinin receptoris
selectively activated by des-Arg9-bradykinin (that would normally be inactiveated by
ACE2), representing a second deleterious pathway. Both pathways could be
blocked with clinically approved drugs (ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists and
the B2 receptor antagonist Icatibant) for secondary treatment in pateints with COVID19. Internalization of ACE2 by the virus is predicted to increase Ang II levels but
reduce those of Ang1-7 but the gene encoding the proposed Ang1-7 receptor, MAS,
was still detected in aged myocytes, as was the apelin receptor. The beneficial
potent positive inotropic action of apelin in the heart as well as its anti-thrombotic
and anti-diabetic properties, suggests its receptor is a promising therapeutic target
for administered apelin and this strategy is currently under clinical investigation.
