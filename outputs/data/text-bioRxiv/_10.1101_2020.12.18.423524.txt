Summary

78

In COVID-19, the immune response largely determines disease severity and is key to

79

therapeutic strategies. Cellular mechanisms contributing to inflammatory lung injury

80

and tissue repair in SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly endothelial cell involvement,

81

remain ill-defined. We performed detailed spatiotemporal analyses of cellular and

82

molecular processes in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Comparison of

demonstrated inter-species concordance of cellular and molecular host-pathogen

interactions. In depth vascular and pulmonary compartment analyses (i) supported the

86

hypothesis that monocyte-derived macrophages dominate inflammation, (ii) revealed

87

endothelial inflammation status and T-cell attraction, and (iii) showed that CD4+ and

88

CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell responses precede viral elimination. Using the Syrian hamster

89

model of self-limited moderate COVID-19, we defined the specific roles of endothelial

90

and epithelial cells, among other myeloid and non-myeloid lung cell subtypes, for

91

determining the disease course.

Introduction

97

The enduring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

98

pandemic has emphasized the urgent need for experimental models to rapidly identify

99

pathomechanisms and therapeutic targets of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

100

COVID-19 causes a wide range of disease manifestations, spanning from

101

asymptomatic infections to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal multi-

102

organ dysfunction (Guan et al., 2020). Disease severity is influenced by age, sex and

103

specific comorbidities, making it evident that host-specific factors influence the course

104

of the disease and require further investigation. While blood of COVID-19 patients is

105

accessible to detailed longitudinal investigation, irrespective of disease severity, and

106

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be safely performed in intubated patients,

107

pulmonary tissue responses remain inaccessible in mild and moderate COVID-19

108

courses, since lung tissue is only available upon autopsy from patients with fatal

109

disease. Hence, experimental models of COVID-19 are needed, which reflect the

110

complexity of human

111

spatiotemporal dynamics of airway and alveolar infection, local pulmonary immune

112

responses, the activation of systemic inflammatory, complement and coagulation

113

cascades, the impairment of endothelial barrier function, and also mechanisms of

114

resilience, resolution and repair.

115

The hamster family (Cricetinae) is of particular interest for experimental modelling of

116

COVID-19, as we and others have observed that animals without genetic modifications

responses

infections,

117

can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and develop phenotypes ranging from mild to lethal

118

COVID-19, depending on age and species (Bertzbach et al., 2020; Imai et al., 2020;

119

Osterrieder et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020; Trimpert et al., 2020). Notably, immune cell

120

influx into the lungs, bronchointerstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage in

121

hamsters bear resemblance to COVID-19 in human patients (Gruber et al., 2020;

122

Kreye et al., 2020a; Lee et al., 2020).

123

Since its initial description as animal model for SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2005), the

124

Syrian hamster has been used to study different aspects of SARS-CoV and Middle

125

East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection (Gong and Bao, 2018;

126

Gretebeck and Subbarao, 2015; Subbarao and Roberts, 2006). Consequently, it now

127

serves as a versatile non-transgenic rodent model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and

128

therapeutic interventions such as antiviral treatments, immunomodulatory therapies

129

and vaccines (Imai et al., 2020; Kreye et al., 2020b; Tostanoski et al., 2020). The

130

disease observed in hamster species primarily affects the lower respiratory tract, which

131

more closely resembles the common courses of human disease as opposed to

132

clinically severely affected transgenic mice, in many of which infection of the central

133

nervous system (CNS) is the predominant manifestation of the disease (Jiang et al.,

134

2020; Winkler et al., 2020).

135

Despite the advantages of hamster models for investigating COVID-19 pathogenesis,

136

unavailability of molecular tools and reagents for hamsters limits investigations of

137

immuno-pathomechanisms, leaving unanswered how closely SARS-CoV-2 evoked

138

disease in hamsters models human COVID-19. We therefore in-depth evaluated

139

SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) elucidating the innate

140

and adaptive steps of immunity and pathogenesis by pairing single-cell RNA

141

sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from lung cells and white blood cells (WBC),

142

histopathology and quantitative proteomics analysis of lungs and blood following nasal

143

SARS-CoV-2-infection of Mesocricetus auratus. We compared our findings with own

144

data from scRNA-Seq and proteomics analyses from human biosamples of COVID-19

145

patients. This enabled in-depth investigations on central COVID-19 pathomechanisms

146

in compartments inaccessible in humans, particularly in moderate disease.

Results

149

SARS-CoV-2 induces self-resolving moderate pneumonia and robust pulmonary

150

immune cell recruitment in Syrian hamsters

151

After infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S1), clinical disease manifested in Syrian

152

hamsters with moderate transient weight loss analogous to previous reports ((Imai et

153

al., 2020; Osterrieder et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020), Figure S2a). High viral loads were

154

detected in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts at 2, 3 and 5 days post infection

155

(dpi). At 14 dpi, only minimal viral RNA load remained, and no replication competent

156

virus was detected in the respiratory tract (Figure S2b – d). Lack of viral RNA in the

157

blood of all animals suggested absence of systemic infection (data not shown).

158

Similar to previous observations (Gruber et al., 2020; Osterrieder et al., 2020),

159

histopathology

160

pneumonia at 2 and 3 dpi, characterized by intrabronchial and intraalveolar infiltration

161

by neutrophils and macrophages as well as severe, diffuse alveolar damage. Numbers

162

and density of infiltrating immune cells, hyperplasia of bronchial and alveolar epithelial

163

cells as well as alveolar and interstitial edema and endothelialitis peaked at 5 dpi. By

164

14 dpi, cellular influx into alveolar spaces was largely resolved, with fewer neutrophils,

165

macrophages and lymphocytes observed within the interalveolar septa, while marked

166

hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells remained (Figure S2e – n). Again, consistent

167

with previous reports (Gruber et al., 2020; Osterrieder et al., 2020) no evidence of

168

thrombotic events were observed.

169

To obtain a higher resolution of the tissue response, we performed scRNA-Seq at time

170

points spanning early infection, peak inflammation and the resolution phase of viral

171

pneumonia. Cell type clusters detected in lungs corresponding to leukocyte-subset-

172

signatures included alveolar, interstitial, and monocytic macrophages, Treml4+-

173

monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, B, T, and natural killer (NK) cells. We further

174

identified typical resident cell types, including alveolar epithelial cells type 1 (AT1) and

175

2 (AT2), ciliated epithelial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts

176

(Figure 1a, S3a). By integrating scRNA-Seq-derived cell frequencies with manually

177

counted cell numbers over time, we mapped the dynamics of infection-induced

178

pulmonary leukocyte recruitment compared to uninfected animals (Figure 1b, c).

179

Neutrophils were the first immune cells recruited to the lungs (peak at 2 dpi), closely

180

followed by an influx of monocyte-derived macrophages (peak at 5 dpi). NK and T

181

lymphocyte recruitment to lungs was first detected at 5 dpi and peaked at day 14

182

(Figure 1c). The peak of lung inflammation on 5 dpi (Figure S2l) coincided with the

183

highest proportion of inflammatory macrophages (monocytic macrophage cluster) and

184

proliferating cytotoxic cells (T/ NK cell cluster) among lung cells (Figure S3b).

185

Notably, despite pronounced neutrophilic bronchitis (Figure S2g), the overall neutrophil

186

frequencies remained low. In line with histopathology, the peak of neutrophil

187

recruitment was at 2 dpi, when neutrophil proportions presented ~3 % of all isolated

188

lung cells (Figure 1e). In contrast, monocytic macrophages population at day 5 peaked

189

at ~25 % of all lung cells (Figure 1d, e, S3b). Relative numbers of pulmonary tissue

190

cell subsets fluctuated mildly during infection, declining proportionally as inflammatory

191

cell influx rose at 2, 3 and 5 dpi (Figure S3c, d). At 14 dpi, increased numbers of AT2

192

pneumocytes matched histopathology observations of epithelial hyperplasia, indicating

193

tissue repair (Figure S2i, k, S3c).

194

Analogously, we analyzed scRNA-Seq data from WBC populations, to study systemic

195

responses evoked by pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Detected cell populations

196

included neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic, NK, B and T cells and various

197

subpopulations thereof (Figure 1f, S3e). Infected hamsters displayed significant

198

leukopenia at 3 and 5 dpi, probably reflecting pulmonary leukocyte recruitment. By 14

199

dpi this trend was inverted and peripheral blood leukocyte numbers were significantly

200

higher than in naïve animals (Figure 1g, S3f). Increased proportions of neutrophils at

201

2 dpi suggested inflammation-induced granulopoiesis, and increasing proportions of T

202

cells at 14 dpi indicated their clonal expansion (Figure 1h, S3b). Notably, calculated

203

neutrophil–lymphocyte ratios only transiently increased at 2 dpi to a minor extend,

204

matching observations in humans with non-severe as opposed to severe COVID-19

205

(Lagunas-Rangel, 2020; Liu et al., 2020) (Figure 1i). Overall scRNA-Seq cell profiling

206

substantially extended histopathology analysis in hamsters, by defining kinetics of

207

innate and adaptive immune cell trafficking to lungs in greater detail.

208
209

Bulk transcriptomics, proteomics and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal

210

activation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 pro-inflammatory immunity in hamsters

211

After evaluating immune cell dynamics in blood and lungs, we performed bulk RNA-

212

sequencing of lungs and blood and matched proteomics of lungs and serum to gain

213

insights into qualitative changes into transcriptome and proteome alterations of SARS-

214

CoV-2-induced immune responses.

Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the most differentially expressed genes in

216

lungs and blood at 2, 3, 5 and 14 dpi versus naïve hamsters provided expected GO

217

terms such as defense response to virus, innate immune response, and cell activation

218

(Figure S4a, b). Pulmonary gene sets related to type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling

219

correlated with presence of viral RNA, thus vanished by 14 dpi. Similarly, pulmonary

220

gene sets related to response to interferon-gamma (Ifng) were highest at 5 dpi (Figure

221

S4c). In blood, type 1 IFN signaling and response to IFN-γ gene sets were highest at

222

2 and 3 dpi (Figure S4d), perhaps reflecting recruitment of specific cells from blood to

223

lungs. Overall, bulk RNA Seq identified an anti-viral immune response that was

224

effectively resolved when the virus was cleared.

225

Proteome host response was in line with sequencing data, serum proteins peaked at

226

3 dpi and lung proteins at 5 dpi (Figure S4e). Agreement between bulk RNA

227

sequencing and proteomics was highly consistent in lungs at 5 dpi (r = 0.9) (Figure

228

S4f). Functional terms connected with immune response, such as innate and adaptive

229

immunity, activation of complement system, humoral immune response and regulation

230

of immune system processes were the most enriched in both lung and serum (Figure

231

2a). In lungs, the response to interferon-beta peaked at 3 dpi and stayed high until 5

232

dpi (Figure 2a). Most processes were resolved by 14 dpi.

233

We next aimed at comparing our data to published datasets from COVID-19 patients.

234

In hamster serum, a total of 37 differentially expressed proteins were identified (α =

235

0.01, providing FDR below 6 %), 17 compared to control and 31 proteins compared to

236

14 dpi when most effects are resolved. 20 of 31 proteins have been reported in human

237

COVID-19 studies, 7 (Actg1, Apoa1, Apoc1, Gsn, Hp, Itih3, Lbp) of which correlate

238

with disease severity (Messner et al., 2020b), all showing the same direction and a

239

response at WHO 4 with the maximum amplitude at WHO grade 7 (Figure S4g).

240

In hamster lungs, at peak response (5 dpi) we identified 150 differentially expressed

241

proteins. 13 differentially expressed proteins have been reported to be regulated in

242

human plasma (Demichev et al., 2020b) with 9 showing the same trend (Table S2 for

243

protein lists). Of these, 6 proteins (C4b, Hp, Hpx, Ighm, Igkv7-33, Itih3) are also

244

changed in hamster serum (Figure 2b). Although a comparison to moderate disease

245

in human lung tissue is not possible, 22 proteins are reported to be regulated in human

246

BAL fluid of critically ill patients (Zeng et al., 2020). The few proteins showing opposite

247

regulation to COVID-19 patients were confirmed by bulk sequencing. Five out of 7

compared to human plasma as well as 8 out of 12 for hamster lung tissue compared

250

to human BAL were confirmed.

251

Next, we refined our transcriptome analyses with the higher resolution of scRNA-Seq

252

and related identified bulk GO terms to cell types, concentrating on inflammatory

253

mediators in lungs and blood (Figure 3). Indeed, various pro-inflammatory chemokines

254

were expressed by lung cells and showed distinct cellular and temporal expression

255

patterns. Classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. Il1a and Il1b transcripts were

256

elevated only early in infection at 2 and 3 dpi in alveolar and monocytic macrophages,

257

and alveolar macrophages and Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-like 4

258

(Treml4)+ monocytes, respectively. By 5 dpi, AT2 cells showed a unique range of

259

upregulated inflammatory mediators such as Cxcl17, Lipopolysaccharide Binding

260

Protein (Lbp), fibrinogen gamma gene (Fgg), and clusterin (Clu). Within the analysis in

261

Figure 3 galectin 3-binding protein (Lgals3bp) gene stood out as being upregulated in

262

many different cell types from 2 dpi to 5 dpi. Notably, we likewise measured increased

263

levels of the Lgals3bp protein in lungs (Figure 2c), which was shown to be regulated

264

also in plasma of COVID-19 patients and correlated with severity (Messner et al.,

265

2020b).

266

Taken together, we identified clear changes in transcriptome, proteome and pro-

267

inflammatory signatures on single-cell level in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

268

displaying a highly active immune response that to large extents were described in

269

COVID-19 patients underlying the validity of our model.

271

Migratory myeloid cells dominate pulmonary transcriptional response to

272

SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters and COVID-19 patients

273

To pinpoint the individual role of the identified cells in anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, we

274

analyzed the 15 - 20 most differently expressed genes in each cell subset. In the early

275

stage of infection at 2 dpi, robust, local transcriptome changes were observed primarily

276

in lung monocytic and interstitial macrophages, neutrophils and endothelial cells,

277

whereas AT1 and AT2 epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages showed comparably

278

little change in mRNA expression (Figure 4a).

279

A common set of anti-viral effector genes was found upregulated in many cell types

280

(Schoggins, 2019). These include e.g. interferon-stimulated gene 15 (Isg15), MX

281

dynamin like GTPase (Mx)1, Mx2, Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide

282

repeats 3 (Ifit3), and Sp100, as well as transcription factors, such as Interferon

283

regulatory factor (Irf) 7 and Irf9 (Figure 4a, Figure S5a). Blood transcriptome analysis

284

recapitulated this early transcriptional activity at 2 dpi (Figure 4b, Figure S5b), but

285

declined by 5 dpi, whereas the signature persisted in the lungs until 14 dpi (Figure S5a,

286

b). The genes that differed most between classical blood monocytes and their

287

counterparts in the lungs encoded chemokines and activation markers, including CXC

288

chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), Slamf9, Il18bp, Ifitm2, Ccl8, Ccl4 and Ccl5 (Figure 4c,

289

Figure S5c), indicating that activation and acquisition of effector function occurred in

290

the lungs.

291

Although AT2 cells are a main target of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs (Hou et al., 2020), they

292

displayed weaker and later transcriptional changes upon infection compared to

293

monocytic macrophages (Figure 4a, d, S5a, d).

294

Notably, at 14 dpi differential transcriptional responses related to defense resolved in

295

blood and lung cells. Instead, we observed upregulation of cell cycle proliferation

296

genes in AT2 cells including Marker of Proliferation Ki-67 (Mki67), Ubiquitin-

297

conjugating enzyme E2 C (Ube2c), Aurora B kinase (Aurkb), and Stathmin (Stmn1)

298

(Figure S5a). This transcriptome profile indicated initiation of a repair program by AT2

299

cells, proliferating to replace damaged AT1 cells (Olajuyin et al., 2019), and matching

300

the increase in AT2 numbers and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia observed earlier

301

(Figure S2, S3). Finally, we put our hamster lung scRNA-Seq data in context with BAL

302

scRNA-Seq data from patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (Liao et al., 2020)

303

and healthy controls (Morse et al., 2019). As in the hamster data, we observed stronger

304

transcriptional responses in macrophages compared to epithelial cells (Figure S5e).

305

Furthermore, the upregulated gene program containing e. g. CXCL10, CCL2 or CCL8

306

was substantially overlapping (Figure S5f).

307

To test whether hamster tissue responses are representative of infected human

308

epithelial cells, we next referred to our scRNA-Seq dataset derived from

309

nasopharyngeal swabs of 19 COVID-19 patients and 5 healthy controls (Chua et al.,

310

2020). Here again, human and hamster epithelial cells derived from infected individuals

311

and animals, respectively, showed a similar, moderate induction of most inflammatory

312

mediators (Figure S6a, b). As notable difference, the strong induction of neutrophil-

313

recruiting chemokines targeting CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR) 2, such as CXCL1,

314

CXCL3, CXCL6 and CXCL8, were found only in human basal and secretory cells with

315

severe COVID-19 but were absent in moderately ill Syrian hamsters (Figure S6a,

316

Figure 3). Aside from the epithelial inductions of neutrophil-attractant transcripts unique

to severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters and patients displayed strikingly

318

similar pro-inflammatory immune profiles specifically in migratory myeloid cells.

319
320

Early activation of TLR/NF-kB dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory

321

cytokines in monocytic macrophages by SARS-CoV-2 infection

322

Next, we asked whether the observed cellular transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-

323

2 infection was directly or indirectly influenced by the presence of virus in each cell

324

type. First, we determined the fractions of cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 entry

325

receptors, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) and transmembrane serine

326

protease 2 (Tmprss2), putative alternative receptors, Basigin (Bsg) and Furin, and

327

cofactors, such as neuropilins (Nrp1), and heparan sulfate (exostosin-1, Ext1))

328

(Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2020) in hamster lungs

329

(Figure 5a, Table S3). Ciliated epithelial cells most frequently expressed Ace2 (~4 –

330

22 %), as did a smaller proportion of AT2 cells (~3 – 5 %) (Table S3). By in situ-

331

hybridization, we visualized SARS-CoV-2 RNA in bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 5b),

332

and alveolar epithelial cells morphologically consistent with both type I (Figure 5c,

333

arrowhead) and type II (Figure 5c, arrow) cells, whereas endothelial cells were

334

consistently devoid of virus (Figure 5b, hash). Importantly, viral RNA was detected in

335

high numbers of intrabronchial and intraalveolar macrophages (Figure 5d, arrows) at

336

early time points. A fraction of macrophages contained high loads of virus without cell

337

debris, pointing towards uptake of cell-free virus (Figure 5d, inset). For comparison, a

338

section of alveoli from uninfected hamsters is shown (Figure 5e).

339

In accordance with in situ-hybridization data, scRNA-Seq data revealed that most viral

340

RNA content was found in monocytic macrophages, and not in epithelial cells (Figure

341

5f, Table S3). For epithelial and endothelial cells, frequencies of virus-positive cells

342

were highest at 3 dpi, declining by 5 dpi to become absent at 14 dpi, indicating removal

343

of virus-containing cells (Table S3). In contrast, alveolar macrophages showed highest

344

viral loads at 5 dpi (~25 %), paralleling decline of virus-positive tissue cells, thus

345

pointing towards potential increase in phagocytic activities (Table S3). To further

346

investigate how cell-specific gene expression is modulated by the cell-associated viral

347

RNA, we tested the correlation between gene expression and viral load in monocytic

348

macrophages.

349

We first compared gene expression levels in monocytic macrophages that did

350

(vRNA(+)), or did not (vRNA(-)) contain viral RNA (Figure 5g, S7a). This revealed a set

351

of genes that were present at much higher levels in vRNA(+) monocytic macrophages

352

at the earlier time points (2 dpi, 3 dpi), but not at 5 dpi (Figure S7a). Gene ontology

353

and KEGG pathway analysis showed that this gene set is enriched for Toll-like receptor

354

(TLR) signaling (Figure S7b). Specifically, this gene set contained a range of pro-

355

inflammatory cytokines such as Cxcl10 or Ccl2 (Figure 5g), which are activated by the

356

NF-kB pathway downstream of TLRs (Liu et al., 2017). On the other side, expression

357

levels of NF-kB independent ISGs such as Isg15 or Mx2, induced by interferons or

358

cytosolic RNA sensors (Schneider et al., 2014), were only slightly more elevated in

359

vRNA(+) compared to vRNA(-) monocytic macrophages (Figure 5g).

360

We therefore investigated expression of Isg15 and Cxcl10 in monocytic macrophages

361

in more detail, and in comparison to AT2 cells (Figure 5h, i). In AT2 cells, Isg15

362

expression was induced in about 50 percent of the cells at 2 dpi, with the gene being

363

present (Figure 5h, upper panel) and expressed at somewhat higher levels in vRNA(+)

364

cells. In monocytic macrophages however, Isg15 was expressed in all cells, and at

365

slightly elevated levels in vRNA(+) cells. In comparison, Cxcl10 was barely present in

366

AT2 cells at 2 dpi and 3 dpi (Figure 5i). On the other hand, monocytic macrophages

367

start to express Cxcl10 already at 2 dpi, and much stronger so the vRNA(+) cells

368

(Figure 5i). At 5 dpi, the difference between vRNA(-) and vRNA(+) monocytic

369

macrophages becomes smaller, but is still significant (Figure 5i).

370

We further analyzed the dose-dependency of this transcriptional response to virus

371

uptake in monocytic macrophages. Cells were binned in three groups of equal size

372

with increasing content of viral RNA (Figure 5j). We found that at earlier time points (2

373

and 3 dpi), but not a 5 dpi, cells with higher amounts of viral RNA-signal, also

374

expressed more Cxcl10 (Figure 5j). Overall, this indicates that viral RNA in monocytic

375

macrophages induces early, strong activation of dose-dependent virus sensing,

376

leading to a substantial increase of NF-kB-regulated pro-inflammatory chemokines.

377

At 5 dpi, broad inflammation likely masks direct viral RNA-triggered responses by

378

activating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in vRNA(+) and vRNA(-) cells

379

equally. In contrast, AT2 cells, supposed primary site of viral replication, show by far

380

less activation of both NF-kB dependent and independent transcriptional responses as

381

compared to monocytic macrophages.

383

Endothelial cells participate in anti-viral and pro-inflammatory responses

384

Having observed vast similarities of human and Syrian hamster immune responses in

385

moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection on transcriptomic and proteomic levels, we next

386

turned our attention to dissection of the molecular mechanisms in lung tissue

387

compartments that have so far not been assessed longitudinally in moderate COVID-

388

19 patients, since invasive tissue sampling is hardly possible.

389

Endothelial cells likely participate in COVID-19 pathogenesis (Ackermann et al., 2020;

390

Michalick et al., 2020), but little is known about the dynamics of their response to

391

inflammation in vivo. Subclustering of cells of endothelial origin identified endothelial

392

cells of lymphatic and bronchial vasculature, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary capillaries

393

and pulmonary veins with unique features (Figure 6a, Figure S8a, b). Interestingly,

394

bronchial endothelial cells, pulmonary artery and capillary endothelial cells all

395

displayed strong and early anti-viral gene expression profiles at 2 dpi (Figure 6b).

396

Pulmonary arterial endothelial cells responded most rapidly to infection, with high

397

expression of Cxcl10, Tnfsf10, and Ccl7 by 2 dpi (Figure 6c). Responses of bronchial

398

vasculature, pulmonary capillary and pulmonary vein endothelial cells were similar but

399

delayed, peaking at 5 dpi. In addition to the distinct temporal dynamics of endothelial

400

activation in different tissues, we observed a spatial regulation of expression of

401

monocyte and effector T cells attractants. Pulmonary artery and vein endothelial cells

402

preferentially transcribed Ccl7, a chemoattractant binding multiple CC receptors,

403

including CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CCR10 (Ford et al., 2018). Pulmonary

404

capillary endothelial cells, however, preferentially expressed the pleiotropic Ccl8,

405

binding at least CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5 (Blaszczyk et al., 2000), while bronchial

406

vasculature endothelial cells were characterized by Ccl2 (Figure 6c). ICAM-1 and

407

VCAM-1 upregulation, expressed by endothelial cells following inflammatory stimuli to

408

allow for leukocyte transmigration (Schnoor et al., 2015), was highest in bronchial

409

endothelial cells and pulmonary artery cells at 5 dpi, corresponding with the influx of T

410

cells revealed by scRNA-Seq data (Figure 6c). Overall lung endothelial cells shared

411

an anti-viral gene profile but revealed distinct patterns of chemokines targeting

412

primarily monocytes and Th1 cells. Unlike cells of epithelial origin, endothelial cells

413

failed to show evidence of proliferation and cell cycle activity that could have indicated

414

their participation in tissue repair processes during the study period (DNA

415

topoisomerase 2-alpha (Top2a), Mki67, Ube2c) (Figure 6c).

Type 1 effector T cells are efficiently recruited to lungs in SARS-CoV2 infection

418

Our initial cellular analysis of scRNA-Seq data from lung samples had grouped T and

419

NK cells in one set of connected clusters, and we had observed their significant

420

increase in lungs at 5 and 14 dpi (Figure 1). We hypothesized that cytotoxic immunity

421

might be linked to viral clearance observed at 5 dpi, and elimination by 14 dpi (Figure

422

S2). Therefore, we subclustered NK and T cells to identify 4 subpopulations based on

423

Cd3e, Cd4, Cd8a and Natural Killer Cell Granule Protein 7 (Nkg7) gene expression

424

(Figure 7a, S9a), CD4+ T cells (Cd3e+Cd4+), CD8+ T cells (Cd3e+Cd8a+), NK cells

425

(Cd3e-Nkg7+) and innate lymphoid-(ILC) like cells (Cd3e-Cd4-Cd8a-Nkg7-). CD4+ T,

426

CD8+ T and NK cell numbers increased with infection time and peaked at 5 dpi (Figure

427

7b). SARS-CoV-2 infection initiated type 1 immunity and cytotoxic effector

428

mechanisms in lungs (Figure 7c, S9b). The fraction of NK cells expressing interferon

429

gamma (Ifng) increased significantly at 2 dpi and peaked at 3 dpi (Figure 7d, left). In

430

contrast, Ifng+ effector T cells (Ifng+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) peaked at 5 dpi (Figure

431

7d, right). By 14 dpi, both Ifng+ NK and T cell responses had declined to naïve levels

432

(Figure 7d).

433

NK cells and CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of cytotoxic genes, but upregulation

434

of Gzma was highest in CD4+ T cells (Figure 7c, S9b). Cytotoxic effector function of T

435

cells was evident, 60 % of all CD4+ T and 70 % of all CD8+ T expressed Gzma at 5 dpi

436

(Figure 7e). Furthermore, we detected “cells” carrying both a specific cell type marker

437

(for AT1 / AT2 / endothelial cells, or monocytic macrophages), and simultaneously the

438

cytotoxic cell marker Gzma. These possible doublets were absent in naïve animals

439

and appeared particularly and reproducibly for endothelial and AT1 cells at the peak

440

of effector T cell recruitment 5 dpi (Figure 7f), indicating possibly either killer-target

441

interaction or more likely T cell transmigration. The latter notion was supported by the

442

strong immigration of lymphocytes in the endothelium observed in histopathology

443

(Figure 7g).

444

Induction of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies is the primary aim of most vaccination

445

strategies against viruses. In the here described primary infection with SARS-CoV-2,

446

neutralizing antibodies were evident by 5 dpi and declined mildly until 14 dpi (Figure

447

7h). Matching course of mu chain protein levels measured by proteomics (Ighm, Figure

448

2b). Along with cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, we found pronounced recruitment of CD4+ Th1

449

cells expressing Ifng, neutralizing antibodies reached relevant numbers only by 14 dpi

– thus, the peak of T cells corresponded with a vanishing virus responses, indicating

Discussion

454

Detailed understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology is imperative for the

455

development of therapies to reduce numbers of patients developing lung injury.

456

Notably, recent patient-centered research on COVID-19 was compromised by three

457

blind spots: (i) Biomaterial is usually sampled after hospital admission, therefore the

458

early phase of infection and host response has rarely been investigated. (ii) the BAL

459

procedure to access the alveolar compartment is too dangerous for non-intubated

460

patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, so that alveolar host responses can hardly be

461

investigated in mild and moderate COVID-19. (iii) Lung tissue can exclusively be

462

harvested after death in COVID-19 patients, precluding from investigations of non-

463

myeloid alveolar or endothelial host responses in early disease, and enabling for

464

analysis of later disease stadium only in case of fatal outcome. Thus, we performed in-

465

depth analysis of the full course of moderate, self-limited disease that develops in

466

SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. In this model, lungs are fully accessible,

467

providing for detailed analysis of myeloid and non-myeloid compartments including

468

vascular endothelium. Yet, while the immune response is qualitatively similar between

469

human and hamsters in central aspects, the viral dose applied in experimental

470

infections is likely to be higher than in natural aerosol infection. Consequently, infection

471

kinetics, viral decay rate and immune responses are accelerated (Johansen et al.,

472

2020; Khoury et al., 2020). In line, we observed the pulmonary peak of viral load,

473

inflammation and cellular response between 3 and 5 dpi, whereas at 14 dpi the

474

infection was resolved and mechanisms of tissue regeneration were induced. This

475

course of disease confirms observations in other animal models including non-human

476

primates.

477

Syrian hamsters developed rapid, but moderate, neutrophil recruitment predominantly

478

to bronchi and lung parenchyma, which resolved by 3 dpi. We also observed little of

479

the typical neutrophil-dependent alveolar damage. Although single-cell RNA-

480

sequencing analysis likely underestimates the numbers of this fragile cell type (10x

481

Genomics, 2020), these findings suggest a minor role for neutrophils. Nonetheless, the

482

neutrophil response is noteworthy, as many other respiratory viruses, e.g. Influenza A

483

Virus and MERS Virus, initiate little or no neutrophil trafficking in rodents (Dietert et al.,
15

484

2017). In fact, blood N/L ratios in COVID-19 patients were reported as markers for

485

disease severity, and neutrophil extracellular traps as well as reactive oxygen species

486

are suspected to contribute to adverse vascular events (Fu et al., 2020; Middleton et

487

al., 2020). Confirming our classification of hamsters as a moderate disease model, N/L

488

ratios were only mildly elevated at 2 dpi, and gene signatures of dysfunctional

489

immunosuppressive neutrophils were observed in severe COVID-19 patients (Schulte-

490

Schrepping et al., 2020), but not in Syrian hamsters.

491

In line with COVID-19 patient reports, alveolar macrophage numbers did not decrease

492

in moderate disease settings (Liao et al., 2020), and monocytic macrophages were the

493

largest cell population recruited to the lungs, with notable recruitment from 2 dpi on,

494

and peak presence at 5 dpi (Chua et al., 2020; Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020).

495

Monocyte trafficking to lungs was initiated by local expression of CCR2 ligands, and

496

endogenous chemokine expression served as a feedforward loop. Consequently,

497

macrophages were the predominant inflammatory cell type in alveolar spaces as

498

identified by histopathology. Moreover, macrophages presented the earliest and

499

strongest transcriptional response to the infection, primarily responding to intracellular

500

viral RNA with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL10, CCL2 and others.

501

Notably, the monocytic macrophage pro-inflammatory expression profile was rather

502

productive than dysregulated as it tended more towards effector T cell recruiting

503

chemokines targeting CXCR3 and CCR5, and less towards pro-inflammatory cytokine

504

expression. This matches observations on moderate versus severe courses of COVID-

505

19 in patients and stands in contrast to findings in animal models with severe disease

506

progression such as K18-hACE2 mice (Liao et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020). It seems

507

unlikely that intracellular viral RNA found in macrophages is the result of active

508

infection of these cells, as they have been demonstrated to be largely resistant to

509

infection ex vivo (Hönzke et al., 2020) (Hönzke, personal communications). scRNA-

510

Seq data obtained from African green monkeys infected with SARS-CoV-2 likewise did

511

not support virus replication in macrophages (Speranza et al., 2020). Instead, virus

512

uptake may derive from complement receptor and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis

513

of complement and antibody-labeled virus, as suggested by neutralizing antibody titers

514

at 5 dpi (Van Strijp et al., 1989). Further, we observed early increase in complement

515

factors and IgM mu chain by proteomics analysis in lung tissue. Taken together, the

516

Syrian hamster model endorses the hypothesis that monocyte-derived macrophages

517

are a primary source of the strong pro-inflammatory response observed in COVID-19,

518

yet highlights that their presence not necessarily results in fatal outcome (Merad and

519

Martin, 2020).

520

Presumably, SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects AT2 cells (Hou et al., 2020). Of note, only

521

few of them were infected and they reacted with only marginal transcriptional

522

responses, which is probably explained by the recent observation in human lungs that

523

less than 10% of AT2 cells express the crucial entry receptor ACE2 (Hönzke et al.,

524

2020). Moreover, coronaviruses are endowed with a multitude of mechanisms that

525

block immunological cascades downstream of interferon signaling and cytoplasmic

526

RNA sensing (V'Kovski et al., 2020). Only a small subset of in vitro highly infected cells

527

express pro-inflammatory genes (Fiege et al., 2020; Wyler et al., 2020). Thus, despite

528

being the primary target for viral replication, epithelial cells were not accountable for

529

early systemic propagation of anti-viral or pro-inflammatory signatures.

530

Endothelial barrier dysfunction, resulting from endothelial cell stress or death, evokes

531

lung edema and thus contributes to lung failure in severe COVID-19 (Ackermann et

532

al., 2020; Escher et al., 2020; Marchetti, 2020; Thompson et al., 2017). However,

533

mechanisms driving endothelial barrier failure in COVID-19 are not well understood,

534

as the endothelial compartment is not accessible in living humans suffering from

535

COVID-19. Autopsy studies reported presence of viral particles in human endothelial

536

cells (Ackermann et al., 2020), but infection of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV has

537

been questioned (To and Lo, 2004). In SARS-CoV-2 infected non-human primates viral

538

infection of endothelial cells was not observed (Speranza et al., 2020). Here, we found

539

that endothelial cells showed a rapid and strong induction of anti-viral response genes,

540

but considering the absence of histopathological evidence for intraendothelial virus,

541

we speculate that virus-positive endothelial cells found by scRNA-Seq were not

542

infected, but were rather an artifact originating from contact with ambient virus or its

543

RNA (Gruber et al., 2020; Osterrieder et al., 2020). Concomitant cellular and molecular

544

inflammatory responses in blood suggested that systemic responses were additive to

545

direct, local endothelial cell activation. Notably, this observation is in line with our

546

recent findings that virus-free plasma of COVID-19 patients induced significant

547

endothelial gap formation and loss of junctional VE-cadherin in human endothelial

548

monolayers and lung tissue (Michalick et al., 2020). Endothelialitis, as observed in

549

autopsies of deceased COVID-19 patients, was also found in infected hamsters

550

(Gruber et al., 2020; Osterrieder et al., 2020) and corresponded to their transcriptional

551

pro-inflammatory chemokine responses (Ackermann et al., 2020). Histopathological

552

evidence of pronounced lymphocyte trafficking via capillary endothelial cells also

553

correlated with endothelial Ccl8 expression.

554

Lymphocyte recruitment in response to CXCR3 and CCR5 targeting chemokines

555

resulted in the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with cytotoxic expression pattern in

556

lungs starting at 3 dpi. Most importantly, viral clearance coincided with appearance of

557

effector T and NK cells stressing their relevance for resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection

558

and highlighting their importance in vaccination strategies. Studies from other

559

coronaviruses suggest that type 1 immunity is the primary mechanism controlling the

560

infection (Janice Oh et al., 2012; Shin et al., 2019). In severe COVID-19, blood CD4+

561

T, CD8+ T and NK cells expressed markers of exhaustion (Varchetta et al., 2020), a

562

finding not mirrored in moderately sick Syrian hamsters. In contrast, T and NK

563

responses were effective and self-resolving. This matches observations of broad T cell

564

antigen-specificity in the majority of resolved cases independent of mild or severe

565

infection (Peng et al., 2020). In our study, we found SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

566

antibodies at 5 dpi, likely of IgM type, as early appearance and corresponding elevated

567

Ighm protein levels suggested. Seroconversion in COVID-19 patients occurred 7 to 14

568

days post diagnosis with IgG titers appearing at later time points (Gudbjartsson et al.,

569

2020; Ni et al., 2020).

570

At 14 dpi, infectious virus was no longer detected in hamster lungs, and most

571

transcriptional activity had returned to basal levels. Upregulation of mitotic markers in

572

AT2 cells may reflect regeneration mechanisms after clearing the infection.

573

The pulmonary capillary microvascular niche in lungs supports alveolar epithelial repair

574

mechanisms following injury, e.g. by secretion of MMP14, VEGF, thrombospondin-1

575

(THBS1) (Mammoto and Mammoto, 2019). Analysis of pulmonary endothelial cell

576

subclusters revealed that bronchial, pulmonary capillary and pulmonary vein

577

endothelial cells showed increased expression of Thbs1 at 5, but not 14 dpi. Similarly,

578

no increase in Mmp14 or Vegf expression was detected at 14 dpi. In murine influenza

579

characterized by lung injury and pronounced alveolar damage, Niethamer et al.

580

described a pulmonary population of proliferating endothelial cells at 14 dpi (Niethamer

581

et al., 2020) that was absent in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters, indicating that

582

the alveolar endothelial and epithelial damage remained moderate in our model. Most

583

notably, lung endothelial cells showed an anti-fibrotic gene signature at 14 dpi (Nr4a1

584

(Palumbo-Zerr et al., 2015), Akap12 (Lee et al., 2018), Nrarp (downstream of Notch-

585

signaling) (Cao et al., 2016), indicating regeneration rather than repair of lung tissue,

586

thereby matching histopathology findings.

587

Our study has several limitations, including limited disease spectrum by restriction to

588

moderate disease, lack of detailed B cell response analysis beyond 14 dpi, and need

589

for improvement of gene annotation in the current version hamster genomes.

590

Furthermore, it does not recapitulate the various covariates and preexisting conditions

591

that can affect disease outcome. Clearly, we are only at the beginning of matching the

592

course of disease in hamsters and humans in greater detail.

593

Nevertheless, we already provide clear evidence that Syrian hamsters recapitulate the

594

course of moderate human SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hamsters displayed nearly

595

prototypic antiviral immune responses starting with rapid, yet self-restricted

596

neutrophilic response, along with a fast and strong monocytic innate immune response

597

following activation after virus uptake, augmenting local anti-viral responses and pro-

598

inflammatory CC chemokine production recruiting a potent type 1 T cell response that

599

probably contributed to elimination of pulmonary residing virus via cytotoxic effector

600

mechanisms. Neutralizing antibodies of IgM type aided in preventing viral spread and

601

fostered cellular virus uptake. Viral infection and inflammatory response in and by lung

602

epithelium is not predominant. Upon successful elimination of virus, alveolar epithelial

603

repair mechanisms started, along with endothelial suppression of fibrotic programs,

604

thus enabling pulmonary regeneration in convalesced hamsters.

605

Hence, Syrian hamsters represent a highly suitable model to study pathophysiology of

606

moderate COVID-19, virus-directed and immunomodulatory therapies, and potentially

607

vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters mount immune responses consistent

608

with COVID-19 patients and enable for detailed investigations on the kinetics and role

609

of specific cell populations, highlighting the dominant contribution of monocytic

610

macrophages, endothelial cells and T cells to inflammatory responses and resolution

611

of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Ethics statement, animal husbandry and study design

790

All experiments involving animals were approved by institutional and governmental

791

authorities (Freie Universität Berlin and Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin,

792

Germany, approval number 0086/20) and performed in accordance with relevant

793

national and international regulations. Female and male Syrian hamsters

794

(Mesocricetus auratus; breed RjHan:AURA, Janvier Labs, Saint-Berthevin, France)

795

were housed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions in individually ventilated cages

796

with enrichment (IVCs; Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy; Carfil, Oud-Tunrhout, Belgium).

797

Food and water was provided ad libidum. Daily cage temperature and relative humidity

798

measurements ranged from 22–24 °C and 40–55 %, respectively. Animals were

799

acclimatized for a minimum of 7 days prior to infection.

800
801

Virus Stocks

802

SARS-CoV-2 isolate (BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020) [32235945] was kindly

803

provided by Daniela Niemeyer and Christian Drosten, Charité Berlin, Germany. Virus

804

stocks were propagated under BSL-3 conditions in Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) in

805

minimal essential medium (MEM; PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented

806

with 10 % fetal bovine serum (PAN Biotech), 100 IU/mL penicillin G and 100 g/mL

807

streptomycin (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). All hamsters described here received

808

virus from the same batch.

809
810

Animal infection

811

At 10–12 weeks of age hamsters were intranasally infected with 1 x 105 pfu SARS-

812

CoV-2 under anesthesia as previously described (Osterrieder et al., 2020). Clinical

813

signs and weight were monitored daily. Animals with >15 % body weight loss over 48

814

h were euthanized in accordance with the animal use protocol. Naïve (n = 3) and

815

infected hamsters were randomly selected for analyses at time points 2, 3, 5 or 14

816

days post infection (dpi) (n = 3, each). Exsanguination and euthanasia under

817

anesthesia were performed as previously described (Osterrieder et al., 2020). 1 mL

818

peripheral blood was collected in EDTA-coated syringes. The left lung lobe was

819

collected for histopathology, the right caudal lobe for single-cell analysis, the right

820

cranial lobe for virological assessments and the right medial for bulk RNA as well as

proteomics analysis. Experimental design and analysis are summarized in the

822

supplemental material (Figure S1).

823
824

Viral burden assessment in lungs and tracheal swabs

825

Virus titers were determined by serial dilutions of lung homogenates (50 mg) plated on

826

Vero E6 cells. Virus adsorption was allowed for 2 h, medium was then removed and

827

cells were overlaid with MEM supplemented with 5 % FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin G and

828

100 g/mL streptomycin and 1.25 % Avicel (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and

829

incubated for 48 h. Cells fixed in 4 % formalin were stained with 0.75 % crystal violet

830

in aqueous solution and plaques were counted.

831

For RNA extractions and quantitative RT-PCR, RNA from oropharyngeal swabs, 25

832

mg lung tissue and 25 µL whole blood was isolated with the innuPREP Virus DNA/RNA

833

Kit (Analytic Jena) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One-step RT qPCR

834

reaction with the NEB Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR (New England

835

Biolabs) and the 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR primers and probe (E_Sarbeco) [31992387]

836

quantified viral RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions and normalization of

837

viral RNA to cellular Rpl18 occurred as previously described [32698441]. Primers and

838

probes are listed in the Supplemental Material (Table S1), standard curves for

839

quantification were generated as previously described [32698441]. Viral RNA copies

840

were calculated per 1x10^5 hamster Rpl18 transcripts.

841
842

Measurement of neutralizing antibodies titer

843

Serum neutralization tests were performed by two fold serial dilutions (1:4 to 1:512) of

844

complement inactivated (56°C, 2 h) hamster serum plated on sub-confluent

845

monolayers of Vero E6 cells in 96 well plates. 50 pfu SARS-CoV-2 were added per

846

well and incubated for 72 h at 37°C, fixed with 10 % formalin for 24 h and stained with

847

crystal violet (0.75% aqueous solution). Serum neutralization was considered effective

848

in wells that did not shows any cytopathic effect, the highest effective dilution was

849

counted.

850
851

Histopathology and in situ-hybridization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

852

For histopathology and in situ-hybridization (ISH), lungs were processed as described

853

(29361238). Left lung lobes were immersion-fixed in 10 % formalin, pH 7.0, for 48 h,

854

embedded in paraffin, and cut into 2 µm sections. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining

and in situ-hybridizations were performed as described [32817952] using the

856

ViewRNA™ ISH Tissue Assay Kit (Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt,

857

Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions with minor adjustments. SARS-

858

CoV-2 RNA was localized with probes detecting N gene sequences (NCBI database

859

NC_045512.2, nucleotides 28,274 to 9533, assay ID: VPNKRHM). An irrelevant probe

860

for the detection of streptococcal pneumolysin was used to control for sequence-

861

specific binding (Bertzbach et al., 2020). Amplifier and label probe hybridizations were

862

performed following the manufacturer's instructions using fast red as chromogen with

863

hemalaun counterstain. Tissues were histopathologically evaluated by board-certified

864

veterinary pathologists (KD, ADG) in a blinded fashion following standardized

865

recommendations (Gruber et al., 2020), including pneumonia-specific scoring

866

parameters (Dietert et al., 2017) as previously described for SARS-CoV-2 infection in

867

hamsters (Osterrieder et al., 2020).

868
869

Single Cell Isolation from Whole Blood

870

Protocols were adapted for BSL-3 facility regulations. For isolation of cells from whole

871

blood, 250 µL blood were lysed in red blood cell lysis buffer (BioLegend), washed and

872

centrifuged according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting RBC-free pellets

873

were resuspended in low-BSA buffer (1× PBS, 0.04 % BSA), filtered with 40 µm FloMi

874

filters (Merck) suitable for volumes below 500 µL and counted microscopically by

875

hemocytometer in trypan blue.

876
877

Single Cell Isolation from Hamster Lungs

878

Protocols were adapted for BSL-3 facility regulations. For isolation of single cells lobus

879

caudalis of the right lung was removed and placed in storage medium (1× PBS, 0.5 %

880

BSA) until further processing. Storage and isolation media contained 2 µg/mL

881

ActinomycinD. Tissues and cells were centrifuged at 350 x g for 6 minutes at 4 °C.

882

Lung lobes were mechanically disassociated with tweezers for 2 minutes in enzymatic

mRNA from individual cells with unique 16-bp 10x barcodes and 10-bp Unique

900

Molecular Identifiers (UMI). Following instructions, reverse transcribed full-length and

901

barcoded cDNA were bulk-amplified. Enzymatic fragmentation and size selection

902

followed, resulting in double-stranded cDNA amplicons optimized for library

903

construction. Adaptor ligation and sample index PCR introduce all reads, sequences

904

and sample index into the cDNA library necessary for Illumina bridge amplification and

905

sequencing.

906

Single-cell libraries were quantified using Qubit (ThermoFisher) and quality-controlled

907

using the Bioanalyzer system (Agilent). Sequencing was performed on a Novaseq

908

6000 device (Illumina), with SP or S1 flow cells (read1: 28 nucleotides, read2: 64

909

nucleotides).

911

Bulk RNA sequencing

912

For lung RNA Bulk Sequencing, the lobus medialis of the right lung lobe was removed

913

carefully and stored in RNA Later Solution for a maximum of 24 hours at 4 °C

914

(Thermofisher). Lung Tissue was homogenized using the TissueLyser II system

915

(Qiagen) and the homogenate stored in Trizol reagent (Zymo research). For WBC RNA

916

Bulk Sequencing, white blood cells were isolated as described for scSeq followed by

917

lysis in Trizol reagent. RNA extractions were performed according to the Direct-zol

918

RNA Miniprep protocol (Zymoresearch). Bulk RNA sequencing libraries constructed

919

using the Nebnext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs),

920

and sequenced on a Nextseq 500 device with read length 76.

Proteomics

923

Sample preprocessing

924

Approximately 5 mg homogenized lung tissue and 5 µl of hamster serum were added

925

to the lysis and inactivation buffer (RIPA) and boiled for 10 min at 95 °C before storage

926

at -80 °C. Samples were thawed on ice and 20 µl of the extract were transferred to a

927

96 well plate. The volume was adjusted to 50 µl with water and 25 µl of 50 U

928

benzonase, 50 mM ABC, 2 mM MgCl2 added before incubation for 30 min at 37 °C.

929

The lysates were processed on a Biomek i7 workstation using the SP3 protocol as

930

previously described with single-step reduction and alkylation (Muller et al., 2020). In

931

brief, 20 µl reduction and alkylation buffer (40 mM TCEP, 160 mM CAA, 200mM ABC)

932

were added and the samples were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C. To bind the proteins,

933

200 µg paramagnetic beads (1:1 ratio of hydrophilic/hydrophobic beads) were added

934

and proteins precipitated with 50 % ACN. The samples were washed 3 times with EtOH

935

and once with ACN, before reconstitution in 35 µl 100 mM ABC, addition of 20 µl trypsin

936

(1 µg) ON digestion at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of formic acid to a

937

final concentration of 0.1 %. Samples were then transferred to a new plate and used

938

for LC-MS/MS analysis without additional conditioning or clean-up.

939

For proteomics, we combine conventional approaches with latest generation

940

acquisition methods, (i.e. Scanning SWATH) (Messner et al., 2020a) coupled with high

941

flow chromatographic separation. This combination combines the strengths of the

942

depth of conventional proteomics, with the strength of very high measurement

943

precision at high throughput achieved with the high-flowrate LC proteomic methods,

944

which overcome limits in the clinical application of proteomics.

945

Liquid Chromatography−Mass Spectrometry Analysis (LC−MS)

946

High-throughput analysis of serum and lung tissue; Peptide separation has been

947

accomplished in a 5-minute water to acetonitrile gradient on an Agilent Infinity II HPLC

948

coupled to a Sciex Triple TOF 6600 mass spectrometer (IonDrive TurboV Source)

949

operating in ScanningSWATH mode with minor changes in the liquid chromatography

950

method (Messner et al., 2020a). As follows: 5 µg of peptides were loaded and resolved

951

in a linear gradient from 1-35 % buffer B in 4.5 min before increasing to 40 % B in 0.5

952

min and washing for 0.2 min with 80 % buffer B before equilibration for 2.2 min with

953

initial conditions (buffer A: 0.1 % formic acid, buffer B: 100 % ACN, 0.1 % formic acid).

956

tissue library was constructed using standard settings in library free mode with DIA-

957

NN (version 1.7.12) (Demichev et al., 2020a). Proteins were annotated using the M.

958

auratus genome sequence generated in this work. The libraries were automatically

959

refined based on the project dataset at 0.01 global q-value (using the “Generate

960

spectral library” option in DIA-NN) as previously described (Messner et al., 2020b).

961

The output was filtered at 0.01 false discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide level. For GPF,

962

6 single 1 µg injections of pooled serum samples were analyzed by online nanoflow

963

liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on a Ultimate3000 Thermo

964

Scientific Q Exactive Orbitrap, LC-MS instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,

965

USA). The peptides were concentrated for 3 min on a trap column (PepMap C18, 5

966

mm x 300 μm x 5 μm, 100Ǻ, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a buffer containing 2:98

967

(v/v) acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 20

968

μl/min. They were separated by a 250 mm LC column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 2 μm;

969

100 Å; 75µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile phase (A) was 0.1 % (v/v) formic

970

acid in water, and (B) 80 % acetonitrile in 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid. In 155 min total

971

acquisition time gradient B increased in 90 min to 25 %, and in 30 min to 40 % with a

972

flow rate of 300 nl/ min. The MS instrument was operated in the data independent

973

mode as followed: the Orbitrap worked in centroid mode with 4 m/z DIA spectra (4 m/z

974

precursor isolation windows at 17,500 resolution, AGC target 1e6, maximum inject time

975

60 ms, 27 NCE). An overlapping window pattern from narrow mass ranges using

976

window placements (i.e., 395-505, 495-605,595-705, 695-805,795-805,895-905 m/z)

977

was set. Two precursor spectra, a wide spectrum (395-505 m/z at 35,000 resolution)

978

and a narrow spectrum matching the range using an AGC target of 1e6 and a

979

maximum inject time of 60 ms were interspersed every 25 MS/MS spectra at resolution

980

of 17,500. Typical mass spectrometric conditions were as follows: spray voltage, 2.1

981

kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; heated capillary temperature: 275 °C; normalized

Data pre-processing; Four serum samples showed low quality and were removed.

996

Peptides with excessive missing values (> 30% per group) were excluded from

997

analysis. Batch correction was applied. The peptide matrix was filtered using factor

998

“Proteotypic” keeping only peptides belonging to one protein group. To obtain a

999

quantitative protein data matrix, the log2-intensities of peptides belonging to one

1000

protein group were summarised by “maxLFQ” method (Cox et al., 2014) into protein

1001

log intensity.

1002

Statistical analysis; Statistical analysis of proteomics data was carried out using

1003

internally developed R scripts. Linear modelling was based on the R package LIMMA

1004

(Ritchie et al., 2015). Following model was applied to the sets of lung/serum samples

1005

(log(p) is log2 transformed expression of a protein): log(p) ~ 0 + Class(Day) + Gender

1006

Here, categorical factor Class(Day) has 8 levels:

1007

Infected(D02), Infected(D03), Infected(D05), Infected(D14),

1008

Control(D02), Control(D03), Control(D05), Control(D14)

1009

Categorical factor Gender has two levels: male, female.

1010

The following contrasts were evaluated to trace time dependence of response to viral

1011

infection (Note that Contrast5 addresses the average difference between infected and

1012

recovered animals and Contrast6 addresses the difference between infected and

1013

1024

For finding regulated features following criteria were applied:

1025

Significance level alpha was set to guarantee false discovery rate below 10% at the

1026

response maximum (5 dpi) in both sample types. We found that alpha = 0.01 was

1027

delivering regulated proteins with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR below 8% in lung tissue

1028

and below 6% in serum and used it for feature selection.

1029

The log fold change criterion was applied to guarantee that the measured signal is

1030

above the average noise level. As such we have taken mean residual standard

1031

deviation of linear model: log2(T) = mean residual SD of linear modelling (T = 1.45 in

1032

lung and T=1.37 in serum).

1033

Functional analysis of proteomics data; Functional analysis was carried out using

1034

gprofiler2 R package (Kolberg and Raudvere, 2020). For selecting the most

1035

(de)regulated GO terms we applied filter: 2 ≤ term size ≤ 200. Analyses for each

1036

Contrast 1 – 6 (Table 1) and then all in parallel were carried out with Benjamini–

1037

Hochberg FDR threshold 0.2. Organism for search was specified as mauratus –

1038

Mesocricetus auratus (Syrian hamster). Statistical domain scope was set to custom,

list of all identified proteins was provided as background.

Statistical Analyses of clinical data

Graph-Pad Prism v8 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) software was

1046

Annotation of the M. auratus genome

1047

The M. auratus genome (MesAur1.0) sequence and annotation (gtf file, version 99)

1048

was downloaded from Ensembl. We noticed that 3’-UTRs in this annotation were

1049

frequently too short to capture all transcriptome reads and particularly the 3’ end reads

1050

in single-cell RNA-sequencing, so we extended all 3’-UTRs for coding genes by 1,000

1051

bp. The Ifit2 gene was extended by 2,000 bp. For key genes analyzed in this

1052

manuscript, we verified that this extension did not lead to overlaps with downstream

1053

genes.

1054

The Ensemble annotation was extended by mapping ENSEMBL gene ids without

1055

annotated gene names to entrez identifiers and to the homolog associated gene

1056

names using biomaRt (Durinck et al., 2009). Wherever existing, we extracted the gene

1062

Analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data

1063

Reads were aligned to the genome using hisat2 (Kim et al., 2019) and quantified using

1064

quasR (Gaidatzis et al., 2015). We then performed gene set enrichment analysis with

1065

tmod (Zyla et al., 2019) and Hallmark, Reactome and GO BP gene sets from MSigDB

1066

v7.0 (Liberzon et al., 2015), ranking genes by the product of the sign of the log2 fold

1067

change and log10 adjusted p-value and converting hamster gene names to human

1068

using the biomaRt mouse-to-human mapping.

1069
1070

Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data

1071

Data analysis was done in R (R Core Team, 2019), using Seurat (Butler et al., 2018)

1072

and packages from tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) and glmer (Bates et al., 2015). All

1073

used code with annotation is available through Github at https://github.com/Berlin-

1074

Hamster-Single-Cell-Consortium.

1075

Raw single-cell sequencing data was processed using CellRanger 3.1.0 (10x

1076

Genomics) with standard parameters, based on a combined MesAur1.0/SARS-CoV-2

1077

(GenBank entry MN908947) reference. Raw feature barcode matrices from the

1078

CellRanger output were read into Seurat using the Read10X function and a Seurat

1079

object created using the CreateSeuratObject function. Cells with more than 7 %

1080

mitochondrial reads, based on the percentage feature expression of the mitochondrial

1081

genes Cox1, Cytb, Nd1, Nd2, Nd4, Nd5, Nd6 were excluded (reads from other

1082

mitochondrial genes were not detected in the data). Furthermore, cells with less than

1083

1000 (lung) or 500 (blood) detected genes were also excluded from downstream

1084

analysis. Sample sets (all lung, or all blood, or blood/lung combined from the individual

1085

time points) were then integrated using the SCTransform workflow, as illustrated on

1086

the Seurat website (Stuart et al., 2019). Briefly, the Seurat object was split by the

1087

hamster that the data points originated from and separately transformed using

1088

SCTransform to normalise and scale the data. To prevent batch specific/animal

1089

1092

analyses respectively were performed on the integrated object, using 30 dimensions

1093

for the UMAP as the SCT workflow reportedly shows more robust results with higher

1094

dimensionality. Cells were subjected to Louvain clustering using the FindNeighbours

1095

and FindClusters (with a resolution parameter of 0.8 for lung samples and 0.5 for the

1096

blood samples) functions.

1097

To annotate cell types in the lung scRNAseq data, we used Seurat's TransferData

1098

workflow (Stuart et al., 2019) and two different reference data sets: Tabula Muris

1099

(Tabula Muris Consortium, 2018) and the Human Lung Cell Atlas (Travaglini et al.,

1100

2020). Integration with mouse data was performed using matching gene names

1101

between mouse and hamster, while gene names in the human data were converted to

1102

mouse using biomaRt. We then used the predicted cell type of the majority of cells in

1103

each cluster to guide cluster annotation, also taking into account cell marker genes

1104

published in literature and cell marker databases (Franzen et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,

1105

2019). The following populations were confirmed: Alveolar macrophages (Siglecf+,

1106

Marco+) (Han et al., 2018), interstitial macrophages (C1qb+) (Angelidis et al., 2019),

1107

monocytic macrophages (Ccr2+, Ccr5+, Arg1+) (Lechner et al., 2017; Shaheen et al.,

Analysis of single-cell sequencing data for blood samples was similar to that of lung

1121

samples with minor exceptions. Following initial clustering, cluster marker genes were

1122

identified using the FindAllMarkers function and clusters expressing high levels of

same (Seurat) workflow in R. We kept cells with less than 10 % mitochondrial reads,

1147

less than 50000 UMIs and less than 6000 genes and used IntegrateData to combine

1148

different samples. We then again used the Human Lung Cell Atlas reference and

1149

TransferData to annotate clusters.

1150

Differential cell density was calculated as in (Praktiknjo et al., 2020) by plotting the log2

1151

ratio of two separate 2D kernel density estimators interpolated on the UMAP

1152

coordinates of each cell.
