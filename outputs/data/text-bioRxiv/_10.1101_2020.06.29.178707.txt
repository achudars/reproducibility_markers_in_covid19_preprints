The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 pandemic uses −1 programmed
ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control the expression levels of key viral proteins.
Because modulating −1 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral
RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in
the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect −1
PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts
of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural
regions. Most mutations left the −1 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was
disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2
propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of −1 PRF efficiency than some other
viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress
−1 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARSCoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal −1 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity
of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These
results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2
through modulation of −1 PRF.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the COVID-19
pandemic that is currently sweeping the globe features a −1 programmed ribosomal
frameshifting (−1 PRF) site.1 −1 PRF, which involves a shift in the reading frame of the
ribosome at a specific location in the RNA message to generate an alternate gene product, is
stimulated by a structure in the mRNA—typically a pseudoknot—that is located 5–7 nt
downstream of the ‘slippery’ sequence where the reading-frame shift occurs.2,3 The −1 PRF
signal is essential to SARS-CoV-2: the frameshift gene products include the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase that is required for viral replication. Previous work on SARS-CoV showed that
mutations suppressing −1 PRF significantly attenuated viral propagation in cell culture, by up to
several orders of magnitude.4–6 Indeed, work on other viruses has found more generally that −1
PRF levels must typically be held within a relatively narrow range to avoid attenuation.7,8 As a
result, frameshift-stimulatory structures are potential targets for anti-viral drugs.9–18
The pseudoknot stimulating −1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 has a 3-stem architecture that is
characteristic of coronaviruses, in contrast to the more common 2-stem architecture of most
frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots in viruses.19 Although the pseudoknot sequence is highly
conserved among coronaviruses,20 several mutations have been identified in the pseudoknot from
viral samples isolated from COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, tracked in the GISAID
database.21 Some of these mutations have been seen in only single patients; others have been
found in patients from many different regions of the world (Fig. 1, right). Understanding how

these mutations affect −1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 can provide insight into issues of central
relevance to developing therapeutic −1 PRF modulators. Such issues include the range of −1
PRF levels over which the virus can survive and propagate (defining the degree of modulation
needed to achieve a therapeutic effect), the regions of the pseudoknot that are most sensitive to
disruption (and hence most profitable to target therapeutically), and the extent to which
mutations in the pseudoknot may be able to induce drug resistance. However, the effects of
naturally occurring mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot on the levels of −1 PRF in SARSCoV-2 and any changes they may induce in the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands have not
yet been investigated. Here we do so, focusing on a ligand previously shown to inhibit −1 PRF in
SARS-CoV.
Surveying over 40,000 patientderived sequences deposited in the
GISAID database as of June 9, 2020
to identify mutations in the
frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot,
we found that ~1.8% of all sequences
contained mutations, affecting 33 of
the 68 nucleotides in the pseudoknot.
In all cases but one, mutations
involved single-nucleotide
polymorphisms, without insertions or
deletions; the exception involved the
mutation of 3 adjacent nucleotides

mutations in the 5′ strand and many
on the 3′ strand. The vast majority involved transitions (purine-purine or pyrimidine-pyrimidine
conversions) rather than transversions. Most (62%) of the mutations in the stems also preserved
the wild-type base-pairing by converting G:C pairs to G:U, A:U to G:U, or G:U to G:C. Finally,
5 of the 13 positions (Fig. 1 left, italic) that are protected from nuclease digestion in the SARSCoV pseudoknot4 experienced mutation in SARS-CoV-2, close to the same rate of mutation as in
the pseudoknot as a whole (38% vs. 48%), indicating that the protected residues are not
significantly more resistant to undergoing mutation.
To examine the functional effects of these mutations on frameshifting, we selected a panel of
6 mutations (Fig. 1, magenta) located in regions that are important for the pseudoknot structure:
near the stem 1/stem 2 and stem 1/stem 3 junctions (U20C, G29U, U58C), adjacent to an adenine
bulge critical to frameshifting4 (C62U), and in the loop 2 dimerization domain22 (C43U, U47C).
For each mutant, we measured the −1 PRF efficiency induced by the pseudoknot using cell-free
translation of a dual-luciferase reporter system consisting of the Renilla luciferase gene in the 0
frame upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the −1 frame and separated by the SARS-CoV-2
frameshift signal.1 The −1 PRF efficiency was obtained from the ratio of luminescence emitted
by the two enzymes, compared to controls with 100% and 0% firefly luciferase read-through (SI
Methods).

Comparing the results for each
mutant to the −1 PRF efficiency seen
for the consensus (wild-type)
pseudoknot sequence, we found that
5 of the 6 mutations left the −1 PRF
efficiency effectively unchanged
within error (Fig. 2A). Mutations that
disrupted base-pairing in a stem (e.g.
G29U) or the dimerization domain
(C43U, U47C) as well as for those
that left all base-pairing intact
(U58C, C62U) were both observed to

the mutations.
Such a result is consistent with
previous work suggesting that −1
PRF levels are regulated in a narrow range, outside of which the virus is significantly
attenuated,5–8 and that they are not determined directly by characteristics such as stability or
specific static structures but rather are most closely related to the conformational heterogeneity
of the RNA.23,24 Remarkably, however, the U20C mutation, which disrupted the A:U base-pair at
the end of stem 2 in the stem 1/stem 2 junction, caused a very significant decrease in −1 PRF
efficiency, suppressing it over 3-fold (Fig. 2A, red). This result is particularly striking because in
SARS-CoV, a ~3.5-fold reduction of −1 PRF efficiency was shown to cause an over 1,000-fold
attenuation of the virus.5,6 The fact that the U20C mutant was sampled from a COVID-19 patient
indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can survive at a wider range of −1 PRF levels than expected based
on work on other viruses.
The surprising effect of the U20C mutation on −1 PRF may arise from a combination of key
properties of U20 in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot. First, this mutation destabilizes an inter-stem
junction; stacking of paired bases across junctions is known to play an important role in the
stimulatory power of pseudoknots.25 Structural modeling also indicates that U20 plays an
important role in triplex-like interactions with loop 1 that organize the stem 1/stem 2 interface,26
and previous work showed that removing triples in pseudoknots can reduce −1 PRF efficiency.27
The relatively sparse network of triples predicted in this pseudoknot26 compared to others, in
combination with the effects on the stem junction, could explain the sensitivity of −1 PRF to
mutation of U20. Interestingly, G29U also disrupts an inter-stem junction, yet it leaves −1 PRF
unchanged, suggesting that the stem 1/stem 3 interface is less important than the stem 1/stem 2
junction, consistent with work showing that stem 3 is not essential for frameshifting.4
Finally, we explored if these natural mutations might lead to resistance to the effects of an
anti-frameshifting ligand, MTDB (Fig. 2B, inset), which was previously found to bind to the
pseudoknot from SARS-CoV and inhibit −1 PRF.9,11 MTDB was recently shown to have a
similar effect on −1 PRF in wild-type SARS-CoV-2.1 We repeated the dual-luciferase assays of
−1 PRF for frameshift signals containing the G29U mutation in stem 1, U20C and C62U
mutations in stem 2, and U58C mutation in stem 3 (omitting the mutations in loop 2, which are
far from the proposed ligand binding site near the junction of the 3 stems9) while adding 5 μM

MTDB, to quantify the reduction in −1 PRF caused by the ligand. Comparing to the effect of
MTDB on −1 PRF when using the wild-type pseudoknot (Fig. 2B, black), we found that for all
of the mutants, 5 μM MTDB reduced −1 PRF efficiency by roughly half. This result was
obtained even for the U20C mutant, which already stimulated −1 PRF at a substantially lower
efficiency. Hence none of mutations significantly altered the inhibition of −1 PRF by MTDB,
regardless of whether the mutations altered the basal −1 PRF efficiency.
These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting −1 PRF
modulation. First, the example provided by U20C show that SARS-CoV-2 can clearly tolerate a
substantial reduction in −1 PRF levels. Hence any putative drug suppressing −1 PRF may need
to do so at quite dramatic levels to be effective therapeutically. In fact, MTDB itself induces a
smaller decrease in −1 PRF than the U20C mutation and is thus unlikely to be effective as a drug
for treating COVID-19. Just as important, however, is the evidence that the effects of an antiframeshifting ligand can be insensitive to a wide range of natural mutations. The fact that the
details of how the mutations affected the pseudoknot—whether they stabilized or destabilized the
structure, disrupted base-pairing, affected one region of the structure or another, or even
perturbed the pseudoknot enough to alter the basal −1 PRF rate significantly—were effectively
immaterial to the activity of MTDB suggests that the inhibitory effect of the ligand is not easily
evaded by simple mutations. Even though such an insensitivity to mutation was seen for only a
single anti-frameshifting ligand, this behavior shows the promise of the pseudoknot as a
therapeutic target, and holds out hope that a ligand with higher anti-frameshifting activity may be
found in future work.

Supporting Methods and Materials
Preparation of mRNA constructs: A dual luciferase reporting system was created by cloning
the sequence corresponding to Renilla luciferase and the multiple cloning site (MCS) from the
plasmid pMLuc-1 (Novagen) upstream of the firefly luciferase sequence in the plasmid pISO
(addgene), as described previously.1 The frameshift signal from SARS-CoV-2 was then cloned
into MCS between the restriction sites PstI and SpeI. Three different types of constructs were
made. First, a construct for measuring −1 PRF stimulation was made, containing the frameshift
signal with consensus (wild-type) slippery sequence (U UUA AAC) and consensus or mutant
pseudoknot sequence, placing the downstream firefly luciferase gene in the −1 frame so that its
expression was dependent on −1 PRF. Next, two controls were derived from this construct: (1) a
negative control for measuring the background firefly luciferase luminescence (0% firefly
luciferase read-through), in which the slippery sequence was mutated to include a stop codon (U
UGA AAC); and (2) a positive control for measuring 100% firefly luciferase read-through, in
which the slippery sequence was disrupted (U AGA AAC) and the firefly luciferase gene was
shifted into the 0 frame. Sequences for all constructs are listed in Table S1.
Transcription templates were amplified from these plasmids by PCR, using a forward primer that
contained the T7 polymerase sequence as a 5′ extension to the primer sequence.1 The mRNA for
dual-luciferase measurements was produced from the transcription templates by in-vitro
transcription (MEGAclear).
Dual-luciferase frameshift assay: Frameshifting efficiency was measured by a cell-free dualluciferase assay.2 Briefly, for each construct, 1 µg of mRNA transcript was heated to 65 °C for 3
min and then incubated on ice for 2 min. The mRNA was added to a solution mixture containing
amino acids (10 µM Leu and Met, 20 µM all other amino acids), 35 µL of nuclease-treated rabbit
reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 5 U RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), and brought up to a reaction
volume of 50 µL with water. The reaction mixture was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Luciferase
luminescence was then measured using a microplate reader (Turner Biosystems). First, 20 µL of
the reaction mixture was mixed with 100 µL of Dual-Glo Luciferase reagent (Promega) and
incubated for 10 min before reading firefly luminescence, then 100 µL of Dual-Glo Stop and Glo
reagent (Promega) was added to the mixture to quench firefly luminescence, and the reaction
was incubated for 10 min before reading Renilla luminescence. The −1 PRF efficiency was
calculated from the ratio of firefly to Renilla luminescence (F:R), subtracting the background
F:R measured from the negative control and then normalizing by F:R measured from the positive
control.
To quantify the effects of MTDB on −1 PRF, 5 μM MTDB was added to the reaction volume for
each construct (wild-type and mutant pseudoknots, positive and negative controls). At least five
replicates were measured and the results averaged, as described previously.3
