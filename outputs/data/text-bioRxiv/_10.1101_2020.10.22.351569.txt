ABSTRACT

37

SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus, is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-

38

CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer mediates virus entry into host cells and cytopathic

39

effects. We studied the contribution of several S glycoprotein features to these

40

functions, focusing on those that differ among related coronaviruses. Acquisition of the

41

furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein decreased virus stability and

42

infectivity, but greatly enhanced the ability to form lethal syncytia. Notably, the D614G

43

change found in globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains restored infectivity, modestly

44

enhanced responsiveness to the ACE2 receptor and susceptibility to neutralizing sera,

45

and tightened association of the S1 subunit with the trimer. Apparently, two unique

46

features of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the furin cleavage site and D614G, have

47

evolved to balance virus infectivity, stability, cytopathicity and antibody vulnerability.

48

Although the endodomain (cytoplasmic tail) of the S2 subunit was not absolutely

49

required for virus entry or syncytium formation, alteration of palmitoylated cysteine

50

residues in the cytoplasmic tail decreased the efficiency of these processes. As

51

proteolytic cleavage contributes to the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we

52

evaluated the ability of protease inhibitors to suppress S glycoprotein function. Matrix

53

metalloprotease inhibitors suppressed S-mediated cell-cell fusion, but not virus entry.

54

Synergy between inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases and TMPRSS2 suggests that

55

both proteases can activate the S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium

56

formation. These results provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-host cell

57

interactions that likely contribute to the transmission and pathogenicity of this pandemic

58

agent.

IMPORTANCE

61

The development of an effective and durable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential for

62

combating the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is

63

the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following

64

vaccination. Knowledge of the spike glycoprotein evolution, function and interactions

65

with host factors will help researchers to develop effective vaccine immunogens and

66

treatments. Here we identify key features of the spike glycoprotein, including the furin

67

cleavage site and the D614G natural mutation, that modulate viral cytopathic effects,

68

infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition. We also identify two inhibitors of host

69

metalloproteases that block S-mediated cell-cell fusion, which contributes to the

70

destruction of the virus-infected cell.

INTRODUCTION

77

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and

78

digestive tract infections in animals and humans (1-4). Two betacoronaviruses, severe

79

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern respiratory

80

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), caused deadly but self-limited outbreaks of severe

81

pneumonia and bronchiolitis in humans in 2002 and 2013, respectively (2,5). In late

82

2019, an emergent betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was shown to cause COVID-19, a

83

severe respiratory disease in humans with 3-4% mortality (6-12). MERS-CoV, SARS-

84

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are thought to have originated in bats, and infected humans

85

either directly or through intermediate animal hosts (1,4,9,13-15). The efficient

86

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans has resulted in a pandemic that has led to over

87

a million deaths and threatened global health, economies and quality of life (11,12,16).

88

An immediate goal for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is to identify treatments,

89

including passively administered neutralizing antibodies, that could ameliorate COVID-

90

19 disease and improve survival (17,18). Another urgent priority is the development of

91

a vaccine that could protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection (19-21).

92
93

The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S gp) is the major target of virus-

94

neutralizing antibodies that are thought to be important for vaccine-induced protection

95

(17-32). The SARS-CoV-2 S gp mediates the entry of the virus into host cells and

96

influences tissue tropism and pathogenesis (22,23,32-35). The trimeric S gp is a Class

97

I fusion protein that is cleaved into the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, which associate non-

98

covalently in the trimeric spike. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) (residues 331-528)

99

of the S1 subunit binds the receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

100

(22,23,32,35-38). The S2 subunit, which contains a fusion peptide and two heptad

101

repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), mediates fusion of the viral and target cell membranes

102

(22,35,39,40). Following receptor binding of S1, cleavage of S2 at the S2’ site by host

103

proteases (Cathepsin B/L, TMPRSS2) is thought to activate extensive and irreversible

104

conformational changes in S2 required for membrane fusion (38,41,42). The interaction

105

of the HR1 and HR2 regions of S2 results in the formation of a stable six-helix bundle

106

that brings the viral and cell membranes into proximity, promoting virus entry (39,40).

107
108

S gp diversity contributes to host and tissue tropism, transmissibility and

109

pathogenicity of coronaviruses (1-4,34). The S gp of SARS-CoV-2 is 79.6% identical in

110

amino acid sequence to that of SARS-CoV-1 (8,9,15), but possesses notable unique

111

features. First, during its evolution from an ancestral bat coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2

112

S gp acquired a multibasic sequence at the S1/S2 junction that is suitable for cleavage

113

by furin-like proteases (9,15,41,42). A similar cleavage site sequence is present in the

114

MERS-CoV S gp but not in the SARS-CoV-1 S gp. Second, compared with the original

115

source virus in Wuhan, China, the more prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants emerging in

116

the global pandemic substitute a glycine residue for aspartic acid 614 (D614G) in the S1

117

C-terminal domain (CTD2); the D614G change is associated with higher levels of virus

118

replication in cultured cells (43,44). Third, although the cysteine-rich S2 endodomains

119

of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are 97% identical, the latter has an additional

120

cysteine residue in its cytoplasmic tail (15). The S2 endodomain of SARS-CoV-1 is

121

palmitoylated and has been shown to contribute to S gp function and localization to

122

virus assembly sites in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC)

123

(45-50).

124
125

Here, we evaluate the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 S gp mutants with alterations

126

in the unique features described above, as well as other features that are potentially

127

important for function. These include: a) the two proposed proteolytic cleavage sites at

128

the S1/S2 junction, and the S2′ cleavage site immediately N-terminal to the fusion

129

peptide; b) the polymorphic residue Asp/Gly 614; c) the putative fusion peptide in the S2

130

ectodomain; and d) the candidate ERGIC retention signal and potentially palmitoylated

131

cysteine residues in the S2 endodomain (Fig. 1). We examined S gp expression,

132

processing, subunit association, glycosylation, and incorporation into lentivirus,

133

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs). We

134

evaluated the infectivity, stability and sensitivity to inhibition of viruses pseudotyped with

135

the S gp variants. We measured the ability of the S gp variants to mediate cell-cell

136

fusion to form lethal syncytia, and found that TMPRSS2 and matrix metalloproteases

137

can contribute to the efficiency of this process. Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors

138

blocked S-mediated cell-cell fusion in TMPRSS2— cells, and synergized with a

139

TMPRSS2 inhibitor in TMPRSS2+ cells. Our results provide insights into the

140

evolutionary features of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp, as well as host factors, that contribute to

141

viral infectivity and pathogenicity.

Properties of the S gp from the prototypic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain

145

As a reference for comparison with S gp mutants, we evaluated the properties of

146

the wild-type S gp (with Asp 614) derived from the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 strain

147

responsible for the initial outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The wild-type S gp

148

was expressed in 293T cells alone or in combination with HIV-1 Gag/protease, which

149

promotes the budding of lentivirus VLPs. The S gp precursor as well as the mature S1

150

and S2 glycoproteins could be detected in the cell lysates, on the cell surface and on

151

lentivirus VLPs (Fig. 2). The S1 gp was shed into the medium of cells expressing the

152

wild-type S gp alone (Fig. 3A). Very low levels of S gp were detected in the particles

153

prepared from the culture medium of cells expressing the wild-type S gp without HIV-1

154

Gag, indicating that the vast majority of the S gp pelleted in the presence of HIV-1 Gag

155

is in lentivirus VLPs and not in extracellular vesicles (Fig. 2 and 3B). We confirmed the

156

presence of VLPs of the expected size and morphology decorated with S glycoproteins

157

by electron microscopy with a gold-labeled S-reactive convalescent serum (data not

158

shown). A higher ratio of cleaved:uncleaved S gp was present on lentivirus VLPs than

159

in the cell lysates or on the surface of S gp-expressing cells, as seen previously (32,38)

160

(Fig. 2 and 3B). Selective incorporation of the cleaved S glycoproteins was also

161

observed in VSV pseudotypes (Fig. 4). The uncleaved wild-type S gp in cell lysates and

162

on the cell surface was modified mainly by high-mannose glycans, whereas the cleaved

163

S1 gp contained complex carbohydrates (Fig. 3C). Both the cleaved (major) fraction

164

and uncleaved (minor) fraction of the wild-type S gp incorporated into lentivirus VLPs

165

were modified by complex glycans, indicating passage through the Golgi (51). This

166

result is similar to our finding that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins can be transported to

167

the cell surface by Golgi and Golgi-bypass pathways, but only those passing through

168

the Golgi are incorporated into HIV-1 virions (Zhang et al., unpublished observations).

169

171

To examine the proteolytic processing and glycosylation of the wild-type S gp in
the context of cells producing SARS-CoV-2 VLPs, we coexpressed the M protein or the

172

M, E and N proteins. Expression of these proteins has been shown to result in VLP

173

assembly and budding for the related SARS-CoV-1 (52-56). When the SARS-CoV-2 M

174

protein was coexpressed with the S gp, faster-migrating forms of the S1 and S2

175

glycoproteins were evident in the cell lysates, on the cell surface and on VLPs (Fig. 3D).

176

In cells treated with Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of anterograde transport through the Golgi

177

(57-59), these faster-migrating forms predominated in M-expressing cells, but were also

178

evident even in cells without M. Sensitivity to PNGase F and Endoglycosidase H

179

identified these S1/S2 species as hypoglycosylated glycoforms modified by high-

180

mannose and/or hybrid carbohydrates (Fig. 3D and data not shown). M coexpression

181

apparently leads to retention of some S gp in early Golgi compartments, where

182

proteolytic cleavage but not complex carbohydrate addition occurs.

183
184

To study cytopathic effects mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 S gp, we established

185

the 293T-S and 293T-S-ACE2 cell lines, both of which express the wild-type S gp under

186

the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. In addition, the 293T-S-ACE2 cells

187

constitutively express ACE2. Both cell lines propagated efficiently in the absence of

188

doxycycline, a tetracycline analogue (Fig. 5A). 293T-S cells grew nearly as well in the

189

presence of doxycycline as in the absence of the compound. By contrast, doxycycline-

190

induced S gp expression in the 293T-S-ACE2 cells resulted in dramatic cell-cell fusion

191

and cell death. Thus, the coexpression of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp and human ACE2 led

192

to significant cytopathic effects. Similarly, transient expression of the wild-type SARS-

193

CoV-2 S gp in 293T-ACE2 cells resulted in the formation of massive syncytia (Fig. 5B

194

and 6). In the same assay, 293T-ACE2 cells expressing the SARS-CoV-1 S gp did not

195

form syncytia. To quantify the amount of S-mediated cell-cell fusion, we adapted the

196

alpha-complementation assay previously used to measure cell-cell fusion mediated by

197

the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (60). Effector cells expressing the wild-type SARS-

198

CoV-2 S gp yielded a signal with ACE2-expressing target cells in the alpha-

199

complementation assay that was approximately 230-fold above that seen for the

200

negative control plasmid (data not shown). These results demonstrate that cells

201

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S gp fuse efficiently with cells expressing human ACE2.

202
203

To evaluate the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp to mediate virus entry, we

204

measured the single-round infection of target cells by recombinant HIV-1 and VSV

205

vectors pseudotyped with the wild-type S gp. Although the VSV(S) pseudotypes

206

exhibited higher infectivity than HIV-1(S) pseudotypes, infection of 293T-ACE2 cells by

207

both S-pseudotyped vectors was at least 60-fold above the background seen for viruses

208

without envelope glycoproteins (data not shown). Consistent with previous findings

209

(38,61), expression of TMPRSS2 in the 293T-ACE2 target cells increased the efficiency

210

of virus infection mediated by the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp (Fig. 7A).

211
212

The furin cleavage site reduces virus infectivity, stability and sensitivity to ACE2

213

and neutralizing antibodies, but enhances S gp syncytium-forming ability

214

At some point during its evolution from an ancestral bat coronavirus, the SARS-

215

CoV-2 S gp acquired a multibasic cleavage site for furin-like proteases at the S1/S2

216

junction (9,15,41,42). To evaluate the impact of this evolutionary change, we altered

217

the two residues immediately N-terminal to the proposed furin cleavage site (FurinMut in

218

Fig. 1). Compared with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp, the FurinMut S gp was

219

expressed at higher levels in 293T cells and was efficiently incorporated into lentivirus

10

220

VLPs, but was inefficiently processed into S1 and S2 glycoproteins (Fig. 2 and 3A).

221

Two glycoforms of the uncleaved FurinMut, one with only high-mannose glycans and

222

the other with complex glycans, were present in cell lysates and on the cell surface;

223

however, only the glycoform modified by complex carbohydrates and presumably

224

transported through the Golgi was found in lentivirus VLPs (Fig. 3C).

225
226

In contrast to the wild-type S gp, FurinMut did not mediate syncytium formation or

227

induce cell-cell fusion in the alpha-complementation assay (Fig. 5B and 6). However,

228

the cell-fusing activity of the FurinMut S gp was dramatically increased by coexpression

229

of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in 293T target cells (Fig. 7B). The infectivity of the FurinMut-

230

pseudotyped virus was 7-50 times higher than that of viruses pseudotyped with the wild-

231

type S gp; the infectivity difference between viruses pseudotyped with FurinMut and

232

wild-type S glycoproteins was greater for HIV-1 pseudotypes than for VSV pseudotypes

233

(Fig. 6 and 8A). The infectivity of the FurinMut virus incubated on ice was more stable

234

than that of the wild-type S virus (Fig. 8B). FurinMut viruses were more sensitive to

235

inhibition by soluble ACE2 and convalescent sera than wild-type viruses (Fig. 8C).

236

Thus, the acquisition of the furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S gp decreased

237

virus stability, infectivity and sensitivity to soluble ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, but

238

greatly enhanced the ability to form syncytia.

239
240
241

Alteration of other potential cleavage sites reduces S gp processing and function
The SARS-CoV-1 S gp lacks a favorable cleavage site for furin-like proteases,

242

but during infection of a target cell is thought to be cleaved at a nearby secondary site

243

and at the S2′ site by cellular proteases (Cathepsin L, TMPRSS2) (62-64). Alteration of

244

the secondary cleavage site near the S1/S2 junction (S1/S2Mut) in the SARS-CoV-2 S

245

gp resulted in complete lack of proteolytic processing, inefficient incorporation into

246

lentivirus VLPs, and loss of function in cell-cell fusion and infectivity assays (Fig. 2, 3C,

247

5B and 6). Alteration of the S2′ site (S2′Mut) also led to lack of S processing, although

248

low levels of VLP incorporation and infectivity were detected. The S2′Mut gp in the

249

VLPs was Endoglycosidase H-resistant, suggesting that it is modified by complex

250

carbohydrates (Fig. 3C). The S2′Mut gp did not detectably mediate cell-cell fusion (Fig.

251

6). Thus, despite the presence of the furin cleavage site in these mutants, proteolytic

252

processing did not occur. Both mutants exhibited severe decreases in infectivity and

253

cell-cell fusion. However, coexpression of TMPRSS2 in the ACE2-expressing target

254

cells enhanced cell-cell fusion by the S1/S2Mut gp but not by S2′Mut gp (Fig. 7B).

255
256

The D614G change in the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strain increases

257

S1-trimer association, virus infectivity and sensitivity to soluble ACE2 and

258

neutralizing antisera

259

The change in Asp 614 to a glycine residue (D614G) is found in the predominant

260

emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide (43,44). The D614G S gp was cleaved

261

slightly more efficiently than the wild-type S gp, but shed less S1 into the medium of

262

expressing cells (Fig. 2, 3A and 6). The efficiencies of cell-cell fusion mediated by the

263

D614G and wild-type S glycoproteins were comparable (Fig. 5B and 6). Both lentivirus

264

and VSV vectors pseudotyped with the D614G S gp infected cells 4-16-fold more

265

efficiently than viruses with the wild-type S gp (Fig. 6 and 8A). The stabilities of the

266

viruses pseudotyped with D614G and wild-type S glycoproteins on ice were comparable

267

(Fig. 8B). Importantly, the viruses with D614G S gp were approximately 7-fold more

sensitive to soluble ACE2 and 2-5-fold more sensitive to neutralizing antisera than

269

viruses with wild-type S gp (Fig. 8D). Soluble ACE2 bound and induced the shedding of

270

S1 from D614G VLPs more efficiently than from VLPs with the wild-type S gp (Fig. 9A

271

and B). The lentivirus VLPs with D614G S gp exhibited a significantly greater

272

association of the S1 subunit with the trimer (half-life greater than 5 days at 37°C)

273

compared with viruses with wild-type S gp (half-life 2-3 days at 37°C) (Fig. 9C). S1

274

association with detergent-solubilized S gp trimers was greater for D614G than for wild-

275

type S over a range of temperatures from 4-37°C (Fig. 9D). Thus, the D614G change

276

enhances virus infectivity, responsiveness to ACE2 and S1 association with the trimeric

277

spike.

Changes in the S2 fusion peptide decrease infectivity
The putative fusion peptide of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 glycoprotein (residues 816-

281

834) has been identified by analogy with the SARS-CoV-1 S gp. Changes in the fusion

282

peptide and a more C-terminal S2 region in SARS-CoV-1 S gp have been suggested to

283

result in fusion-defective mutants (65-67). We introduced analogous changes into the

284

putative fusion peptide of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp (L821A and F823A), and also made a

285

change (F888R) in the downstream region implicated in SARS-CoV-1 S gp function.

286

The L821A and F823A mutants were processed slightly less efficiently than the wild-

287

type S gp. Compared with the wild-type S gp, the F888R mutant exhibited a lower ratio

288

of the S1 gp in cell lysates relative to the S1 gp in cell supernatants, suggesting a

289

decrease in the association of S1 with the S trimer (Fig. 3A and 6). Modest decreases

290

in the level of S glycoproteins on lentivirus VLPs were observed for all three mutants.

291

L821A and F823A retained the ability to mediate cell-cell fusion, although the syncytia

292

formed were smaller than those induced by the wild-type S gp (Fig. 5B and 6). F888R

293

was severely compromised in the ability to mediate cell-cell fusion; however, this ability

294

was recovered when TMPRSS2 was coexpressed with ACE2 in the target cells (Fig.

295

7B). The infectivity of viruses pseudotyped with these three mutants was greatly

296

decreased, relative to viruses with wild-type S gp (Fig. 6 and 7A). In summary, these

297

S2 ectodomain changes exert pleiotropic effects, ultimately compromising virus

298

infectivity.

300

Palmitoylated membrane-proximal cysteines in the S2 endodomain contribute to

301

virus infectivity

302

The S2 endodomain of SARS-CoV-1 is palmitoylated, contains an ERGIC-

303

retention signal, and contributes to the interaction of S with the M protein during virus

304

assembly (45-50). We altered the highly similar endodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp,

305

which contains ten cysteine residues potentially available for palmitoylation. The

306

endodomain/cytoplasmic tail was deleted in the ΔCT mutant, leaving only the two

307

membrane-proximal cysteine residues (Fig. 1). In the ΔERsig mutant, the putative

308

ERGIC-retention signal at the C terminus of the endodomain was deleted. In three

309

additional mutants, the N-terminal five cysteine residues (1st 5C-to-A), the C-terminal

310

five cysteine residues (2nd 5C-to-A), or all ten cysteine residues (10 C-to-A) were altered

311

to alanine residues.

312
313

The ΔCT and ΔERsig mutants were expressed on the cell surface at higher

314

levels than that of the wild-type S gp, and the level of ΔCT on lentivirus VLPs was

315

significantly increased (Fig. 2, 3C and 6). Both ΔCT and ΔERsig mediated syncytium

316

formation and virus infection at levels comparable to those of the wild-type S gp (Fig. 5B

317

and 6). Therefore, except for the two membrane-proximal cysteine residues, the SARS-

318

CoV-2 S2 endodomain is not absolutely required for cell-cell fusion or virus entry.

319
320

Proteolytic processing of the 2nd 5C-to-A and 10 C-to-A mutants was more

321

efficient than that of the wild-type S gp (Fig. 2 and 6). Although all three mutants with

322

altered endodomain cysteine residues were expressed on the cell surface and

323

incorporated into VLPs, only the 2nd 5C-to-A mutant supported cell-cell fusion and virus

324

infection at wild-type S levels. Of note, the infectivity of lentiviruses pseudotyped with

325

the 1st 5C-to-A and 10 C-to-A mutants was near the background of the assay. These

326

results implicate the membrane-proximal cysteine residues of the S2 endodomain in the

327

virus entry process.

328
329

To evaluate the palmitoylation of the wild-type and mutant S glycoproteins, we

330

used hydroxylamine cleavage and mPEG-maleimide alkylation to mass-tag label the

331

palmitoylated cysteine residues (68). The majority of the wild-type S2 gp was

332

palmitoylated, with different species containing one to four acylated cysteines (Fig. 10).

333

The ΔCT, 1st 5C-to-A and 2nd 5C-to-A mutants consisted of two species, one without

334

palmitoylation and the other with a single palmitoylated cysteine. The ratio of

335

palmitoylated:unmodified S2 glycoprotein was significantly greater for the 2nd 5C-to-A

336

mutant than for the ΔCT and 1st 5C-to-A mutants. The 10 C-to-A mutant was not

337

detectably palmitoylated. Thus, palmitoylation can occur on multiple different cysteine

338

residues in the SARS-CoV-2 S2 endodomain; however, palmitoylation appears to occur

339

more efficiently on the N-terminal endodomain cysteines, which contribute to virus

340

infectivity.

341
342

We also tested whether the effect of M protein coexpression on S glycosylation

343

depended on an intact S endodomain. Surprisingly, M coexpression resulted in the

344

appearance of hypoglycosylated forms of the ΔCT, ΔERsig and 10 C-to-A mutants (data

345

not shown). Thus, an intact or palmitoylated endodomain is not required for M to exert

346

an effect on S glycosylation.

347
348
349

Metalloprotease inhibitors block S-mediated cell-cell fusion
To gain insight into the host cell factors that might influence our experimental

350

outcomes, we tested several inhibitors in the cell-cell fusion, syncytium formation, and

351

lentivirus pseudotype infection assays. Inhibitors of several proteases potentially

352

involved in S gp activation were tested. E64d, which blocks the activity of cysteine

353

proteases like Cathepsin B/L, partially inhibited the infection of lentiviruses pseudotyped

354

with SARS-CoV-2 S gp at concentrations up to 100 µM (data not shown). E64d had no

355

effect on SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated syncytium formation. In contrast, two broad-

356

spectrum matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, marimastat and ilomastat, inhibited S-

357

mediated cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation (Fig. 11A-C). These inhibitory effects

358

were specific, because neither compound decreased cell-cell fusion or syncytium

359

formation mediated by HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimers. Another metalloprotease

360

inhibitor, TAPI-2, also inhibited S-mediated cell-cell fusion, but was less potent and

361

specific than marimastat or ilomastat (data not shown). Cell-cell fusion assays were

362

conducted in which the compounds were incubated either with the S-expressing or

16

363

ACE2-expressing cells, followed by cocultivation of these cells. The results indicate that

364

the primary inhibitory effect of the metalloprotease inhibitors is exerted on the ACE2-

365

expressing target cells (data not shown). Consistent with this interpretation, no effect of

366

marimastat or ilomastat on the processing of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp was observed (Fig.

367

11D). None of the metalloprotease inhibitors affected the efficiency of lentivirus

368

infection mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 S gp, at doses up to 100 µM (data not shown).

369

These results suggest that one or more matrix metalloproteases on the surface of the

370

ACE2-expressing target cells contribute to the efficiency of cell-cell fusion mediated by

371

the SARS-CoV-2 S gp. Of interest, marimastat and ilomastat were much less effective

372

at inhibiting S-mediated cell-cell fusion when TMPRSS2 was coexpressed with ACE2 in

373

the target cells (Fig. 12A). Camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of serine proteases like

374

TMPRSS2, when used alone had little or no effect on S-mediated cell-cell fusion,

375

syncytium formation or virus infection of 293T-ACE2 target cells (Fig. 12B, C and data

376

not shown). However, camostat mesylate and marimastat syngergistically inhibited S-

377

mediated syncytium formation, consistent with TMPRSS2 and metalloproteases

378

carrying out redundant functions during the cell-cell fusion process (Fig. 12B and C).

379
380

Given the phenotype of the 10 C-to-A mutant, we tested the effects of a

381

palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) on the function of the wild-type S gp.

382

2-BP inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion, syncytium formation and virus

383

infection (Fig. 12D and data not shown). We verified that 2-BP treatment reduced

384

palmitoylation of the S2 glycoprotein, but found that 2-BP also reduced the proteolytic

385

processing of the S precursor (Fig. 12E). Cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation

386

mediated by the HIV-1JR-FL envelope glycoprotein were also inhibited by 2-BP (Fig. 12D

17

387

and data not shown). Treatment of the effector and target cells individually with 2-BP

388

suggested that the main effect of 2-BP is exerted on the cells expressing the SARS-

389

CoV-2 S and HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. These results indicate that inhibition of

390

palmitoylation can result in blockade of SARS-CoV-2 S gp function, perhaps through

391

indirect effects. For example, furin palmitoylation is required for association of furin with

392

plasma membrane microdomains and processing of some substrates (69).

DISCUSSION
Many properties contribute to the ability of a virus like SARS-CoV-2 to achieve

396

zoonotic transmission into humans, to spread globally in the human population, to

397

evade host immune systems, and to cause disease. The exposed nature of the spike

398

trimer on the surface of infected cells and viruses renders the S gp particularly subject

399

to evolutionary pressure. Here, we examined several features of the S gp to

400

understand their potential contribution to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, stability, resistance to

401

neutralization and cytopathic effects.

402
403

Conformational changes in Class I viral envelope glycoproteins contribute to

404

virus entry and evasion of host antibody responses (Fig. 13). The pretriggered, “closed”

405

conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp trimer is converted by binding the receptor,

406

ACE2, to more “open” intermediate conformations, with the S1 receptor binding

407

domains (RBDs) in the “up” position (22,35-37,40,70). Proteolytic cleavage of the S gp

408

in various contexts further activates the S gp, allowing it to achieve fusion-active

409

conformations. The propensity of Class I viral envelope glycoproteins to make

410

transitions from the pretriggered conformation to downstream conformations has been

18

411

termed “reactivity” or “triggerability” (71). Studies of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins have

412

shown that high triggerability promotes efficient virus infection and broadened tropism,

413

but can also render the virus more susceptible to antibody neutralization (72,73).

414
415

Our results indicate that two key features of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp, the furin

416

cleavage site acquired during viral passage to humans from bat/intermediate hosts and

417

the D614G change associated with increasing prevalence in human populations,

418

influence related functions of the S gp. Acquisition of the furin cleavage site resulted in

419

decreased infectivity and reduced sensitivity to soluble ACE2 and neutralizing

420

antibodies, phenotypes suggestive of lowered triggerability (Fig. 13). Similarly, furin

421

cleavage stabilizes the pretriggered conformation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins

422

(74-77). Cleavage of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp, unlike that of SARS-CoV-1,

423

occurs in the S-expressing cell. Upon ACE2 binding, the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp

424

efficiently mediates syncytium formation and cytopathic effects, functions that are

425

dramatically enhanced by S1-S2 cleavage. The furin cleavage site-dependent fusion of

426

the membranes of infected cells with those of adjacent ACE2-expressing cells might

427

also enhance cell-to-cell transmission via virus-cell synapses. Increased efficiency of

428

cell-to-cell transmission could counterbalance the decreased cell-free infectivity of the

429

viruses with the furin cleavage site. Increases in the efficiency of proteolytic processing

430

of other Class I viral envelope glycoproteins have been associated with broadened viral

431

tropism and enhanced virulence (78-86).

432
433
434

“Restraining residues” participate in molecular bonds that maintain Class I viral
envelope glycoproteins in pretriggered conformations (72-73). Alteration of these

435

restraining residues results in increased triggerability (Fig. 13). Asp 614 appears to fit

436

the definition of a restraining residue. The D614G change increases virus infectivity and

437

responsiveness to ACE2, but also results in moderate increases in sensitivity to

438

neutralizing antisera. The proximity of Asp 614 (in the S1 C-terminal domain (CTD2)) to

439

the S2 fusion peptide-proximal region (FPPR), which abuts the S1 CTD1 and has been

440

proposed to suppress the opening of the S1 RBD (40), could account for these effects

441

on viral phenotypes. Based on the reported structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike

442

glycoprotein (40,87), several amino acid residues (Lys 835, Gln 836 and Lys 854) are in

443

close proximity to Asp 614 and therefore could potentially influence D614G phenotypes.

444

However, alanine substitutions of these residues did not abolish the observed D614G

445

phenotypes (data not shown). Of note, the D614G change partially compensates for

446

the effects of acquisition of the furin cleavage site on virus infectivity and ACE2

447

responsiveness (Fig. 13). It will be of interest to evaluate whether other, less common

448

evolutionary changes affect S gp conformational equilibrium (88).

449
450

The stability of functional viral spikes may significantly impact modes and

451

efficiency of transmission. Based on the observation that soluble ACE2 induces

452

shedding of the S1 glycoprotein from the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, downstream “open”

453

conformations may be more labile than the pretriggered conformation. The lability of

454

open spike conformations could potentially nullify any replicative advantage of

455

increased triggerability. The more triggerable FurinMut and D614G mutants solve this

456

potential problem in different ways. By retaining a covalent bond between S1 and S2,

457

FurinMut maintains and even increases spike stability. D614G retains an intact furin

458

cleavage site but strengthens the association of S1 with the S trimer, possibly by

20

459

improving S1 CTD2-S2 interactions. The resulting higher spike density allows FurinMut

460

and D614G to take replicative advantage of increased ACE2 triggerability.

461
462

Proteolytic cleavage of the ACE2-bound S gp intermediate promotes

463

conformational changes conducive to achieving membrane fusion. Depending on

464

context, different proteases may be involved. During cell-free virus entry, cysteine

465

proteases like Cathepsin B/L can act on endocytosed viruses. TMPRSS2 expressed on

466

the surface of the ACE2-expressing target cells could enhance both cell-free virus

467

infection and cell-cell fusion mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 S gp. TMPRSS2

468

enhancement of cell-cell fusion was particularly robust for S gp mutants that were not

469

efficiently cleaved at the S1/S2 junction; that the S2′Mut was an exception hints that

470

TMPRSS2 cleavage at the S2′ site may contribute to the observed enhancement. Our

471

results implicate matrix metalloproteases in cell-cell fusion but not virus infection

472

mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 S gp. Zinc metalloproteases have been implicated in

473

neurovirulent murine coronavirus entry and cell-cell fusion (89). Cytopathic effects

474

resulting from the formation of lethal syncytia may contribute to the damage of lung

475

tissue during SARS-CoV-2 infection (90). As a number of matrix metalloproteases are

476

expressed in pulmonary tissue and can be upregulated in response to inflammation

477

(91), their potential involvement in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis should be further

478

explored.

479
480

The sampling of downstream, open conformations by uncleaved Class I viral

481

envelope glycoproteins can result in the elicitation of poorly neutralizing antibodies

482

unable to recognize the native pretriggered conformation. In the case of HIV-1,

483

uncleaved envelope glycoproteins can traffic to the cell surface by bypassing the

484

conventional Golgi transport pathway, and therefore are efficiently presented to the host

485

immune system (Zhang et al., unpublished observations). Likewise, substantial

486

fractions of uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S gp also appeared on the surface of

487

overexpressing 293T cells, even when anterograde Golgi transport was blocked (Fig.

488

3D). The use of Golgi bypass pathways by conformationally flexible S glycoproteins

489

could account for the observation that the vast majority of antibodies raised to the S gp

490

during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection fail to neutralize the virus (27,92). Although

491

limited to specific experimental systems, our study highlights the impact of SARS-CoV-2

492

S gp variation and host factors on spike synthesis, conformation and sensitivity to

493

inhibition. These insights could assist the development of effective interventions.

Cell lines

501

Human female embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC) and COS-1 African green

502

monkey male kidney fibroblasts (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle

503

medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 µg/ml

504

penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep) (Life Technologies). 293T cells were used for

505

transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants, in some cases with HIV-1

506

Gag/protease or with SARS-CoV-2 M, E and N proteins. 293T cells transiently

507

expressing omega-gal and either ACE2 or ACE2 + TMPRSS2 were used as target cells

508

in the cell-cell fusion assay. COS-1 cells transiently expressing alpha-gal and SARS-

509

CoV-2 S gp variants or HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (AD8 or JR-FL strain) were used

510

as effector cells in the cell-cell fusion assay. Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 canine thymic epithelial

511

cells expressing human CD4 and CCR5 coreceptors were used as target cells for

512

evaluating cell-cell fusion mediated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins; Cf2Th-

513

CD4/CCR5 cells were grown in the above medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml G418

514

and 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin.

515
516

293T cells constitutively expressing human ACE2 (293T-ACE2 cells) were established

517

by transducing 293T cells with the pLenti-III-hACE2 lentivirus vector (see below). The

518

lentivirus vector was prepared by transfecting 1x106 293T cells in a six-well plate with

519

1.5 µg psPAX2, 2 µg pLenti-III-hACE2 and 0.5 µg pVSVG using Lipofectamine 3000

520

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two days after transfection, the supernatant was harvested,

521

spun at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove cell debris, and then filtered (0.45-µm). The

522

filtered supernatant containing recombinant lentiviral vectors was used to transduce

293T cells seeded one day before. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were selected in

524

DMEM with 2 µg/ml puromycin with 1x Pen-Strep and 10% FBS for one week. A

525

polyclonal puromycin-resistant population of 293T-ACE2 cells was shown to express

526

human ACE2 by Western blotting. The 293T-ACE2 cells were used as target cells for

527

infection by lentivirus and VSV pseudotypes, and as target cells in cell-cell fusion and

528

syncytium formation assays.

The wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp, with Asp 614, was inducibly expressed in Lenti-x-

transcriptional activator (rtTA) (Lenti-x-293T-rtTa cells (D1317)) (94) were used as the

537

parental cells for the 293T-S and 293T-S-ACE2 cell lines. The 293T-S (D1481) cells

538

inducibly expressing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp with a carboxy-terminal His6 tag

539

were produced by transduction of Lenti-x-293T-rtTA cells with the K5648 recombinant

540

lentivirus vector (see below). The packaged K5648 lentivirus vector (60 µl volume) was

541

incubated with 2x105 Lenti-x-293T-rtTA cells in DMEM, tumbling at 37°C overnight. The

542

cells were then transferred to a 6-well plate in 3 ml DMEM/10% FBS/Pen-Strep and

543

subsequently selected with 10 µg/ml puromycin.

transduction of the 293T-S cells with the K5659 recombinant lentivirus vector, which

548

expresses human ACE2 (see below). The packaged K5659 lentivirus vector (60 µl

549

volume) was incubated with 2x105 293T-S cells in DMEM, tumbling at 37°C overnight.

550

The cells were then transferred to a 6-well plate in 3 ml DMEM/10% FBS/Pen-Strep and

551

subsequently selected with 10 µg/ml puromycin for four days.

553

Plasmids

554

The wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins were expressed transiently by a

555

pcDNA3.1(-) vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)

556

gene sequence, which encodes an aspartic acid residue at position 614, was obtained

557

from the National Center for Biological Information (NC_045512.20). The gene was

558

modified to encode a Gly3 linker and His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus. The modified S

559

gene was codon-optimized, synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, and cloned

560

into the pcDNA3.1(-) vector. S mutants were made using Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master

561

Mix and KLD Enzyme Mix for site-directed mutagenesis, according to the

562

manufacturer’s protocol (New England Biolabs), and One-Shot TOP10 Competent

563

Cells.

564
565

Inducible expression of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp was obtained using a self-

566

inactivating lentivirus vector comprising TRE3g-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-6His.IRS6A.Puro-

567

T2A-GFP (K5648) (95). Here, the expression of the codon-optimized, wild-type S gene

568

is under the control of a tetracycline response element (TRE) promoter. The internal

569

ribosome entry site (IRES) allows expression of puro.T2A.EGFP, in which puromycin N-

571

cleavage at the Thosea asigna 2A (T2A) sequence.

572
573

Constitutive expression of human ACE2 in the 293T-S-ACE2 (D1496) cells was

574

achieved using lentivirus vector (K5659) comprising hCMV-ACE2.IRES.puro. The

575

ACE2 gene (obtained from Addgene [Catalog #: 1786]) was placed under the control of

576

the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) immediate early promoter. The vector also

577

expresses puromycin N-acetyltransferase downstream of an IRES.

578
579

To package the recombinant K5648 and K5659 lentiviral vectors, 5x105 Lenti-x-293T

580

cells were transfected with 1.5 µg K5648 or K5659 vector/plasmid, 1.5 µg lentivirus

581

packaging plasmid (expressing HIV-1 Gag, Pro, Pol, Tat and Rev), and 1 µg of a

582

plasmid expressing the VSV G glycoprotein using the FuGene HD reagent (Promega).

583

Forty-eight hours later, the cell supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm

584

and filtered (0.45-µm). Lentiviral vector particles were concentrated 25-fold by

585

centrifugation at 100,000 x g for two hours. Packaged vector preparations were

586

aliquoted in 60 µl volumes and stored at -80°C.

587
588

The pLenti-III-hACE2 plasmid was used to establish 293T-ACE2 cells constitutively

589

expressing full-length human ACE2. A plasmid containing the ACE2 gene (Addgene)

590

was digested with Nhe I and Kpn I and the fragment was ligated into the similarly

591

digested pLenti-III-HA vector plasmid, producing pLenti-III-hACE2. To produce VSV G-

592

pseudotyped lentiviruses encoding ACE2, 1x106 293T cells were transfected with 2 µg

593

pLenti-III-hACE2, 1.5 µg psPAX2 and 0.5 µg pVSVG using Lipofectamine 3000

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two days later, the cell supernatant was harvested, clarified

595

by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes, and filtered (0.45-µm). The recombinant

596

lentiviruses in the filtered supernatants were used to transduce 293T cells, which were

597

screened in DMEM/10% FBS/Pen-Strep with 2 µg/ml puromycin for one week. After

pcDNA3.1(-)-sACE2 using FectPRO DNA Transfection Reagent (PolyPlus-transfection).

610

Three days later, cell supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation (1,500 x g

611

for 15 minutes), filtered (0.45-µm), and incubated with 1 ml Strep-Tactin resin (IBA

612

Lifesciences) for 2 hours at 4°C with rotation. The mixture was applied to a Biorad

613

column, washed with 30 bed volumes of 1x Strep-Tactin washing buffer and eluted with

614

10 bed volumes of 1x Strep-Tactin elution buffer. The eluate was concentrated using a

Lentiviruses pseudotyped by S glycoproteins

619

Subconfluent 293T cells in a T75 flask were cotransfected with 1 µg of the S plasmid, 1

620

µg of the psPAX2 HIV-1 Gag-Pol packaging plasmid and 3 µg of the luciferase-

625

Subconfluent 293T cells in a T75 flask were transfected with 15 µg of the SARS-CoV-2

626

S plasmid using polyethylenimine (Polysciences), following the manufacturer's protocol.

627

Twenty-four hours later, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 3-5 with rVSV-

628

ΔG pseudovirus bearing a luciferase gene (Kerafast) for 2 hours at 37°C and then

629

washed 6 times with 1X PBS. Cell supernatants containing S-pseudotyped VSV were

630

harvested 24 hours later, clarified by low-speed centrifugation (2,000 rpm for 10 min),

631

and either characterized immediately or stored at -80°C for later analysis. An additional

293T cells were cotransfected with SARS-CoV-2 S, M, E and N plasmids at equimolar

669

concentrations. In the mock sample, an equivalent amount of the pcDNA3.1(-) plasmid

670

was used in place of the M,E and N plasmids. In experiments using Brefeldin A (BFA),

671

BFA was added at 6 hr after transfection. At 3 days after transfection, samples from cell

293T-ACE2 cells were cotransfected with an eGFP-expressing plasmid and either

693

pcDNA3.1(-) or a pcDNA3.1 plasmid expressing the wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 S

694

gp. For the HIV-1 control, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing eGFP,

695

the HIV-1JR-FL envelope glycoproteins, CD4 and CCR5. Twenty-four hours after

696

transfection, cells were imaged using a fluorescence microscope with a green light filter.

697

In the syncytium inhibition assay, 10 μM ilomastat, 10 µM marimastat or 100 µM

698

camostat mesylate was added during transfection and cells were imaged at different

cells for 50 effector-cell wells). Plates were spun at 500 x g for 3 minutes and then

713

incubated at 37 oC in 5% CO2 for 3-4 hours. Medium was aspirated and cells were

714

lysed in Tropix lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The β-galactosidase activity in

715

the cell lysates was measured using the Galacto-Star Reaction Buffer Diluent with

716

Galacto-Star Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol.

717
718

In the inhibition assay, to allow for optimal contact, target cells were scraped and

719

resuspended in medium, and inhibitors were added at the indicated concentrations.

720

Cells were then incubated at 37 oC in 5% CO2 for 2 hr before they were added to

721

effector cells, as described above.

722
723

For the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein control, effector cells were cotransfected with

724

plasmids expressing alpha-gal and the HIV-1AD8 Env and Tat at a 1:1:0.125 ratio. 293T

725

target cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing omega-gal, CD4 and CCR5 at

726

a 1:1:1 ratio.

727
728

A variation of the above protocol was used for the cell-cell fusion assays shown in Fig.

729

12B and D. For the experiment shown in Fig. 12B, 293T-S effector cells in black-and-

730

white 96-well plates were transfected with a plasmid expressing alpha-gal using

731

Lipofectamine 3000 and either induced with 1 µg/ml doxycycline or mock treated. In

737

combination of camostat and marimastat, and then added to effector cells. For the

738

experiment shown in Fig. 12D, COS-1 cells were used as effector cells. The effector

739

cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing alpha-gal and a plasmid expressing

740

the HIV-1JR-FL envelope glycoprotein or the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp, or pcDNA3.1

741

as a control. For the SARS-CoV-2 S gp-expressing effector cells, 293T-ACE2 cells were

742

used as target cells; for effector cells expressing the HIV-1JR-FL envelope glycoprotein,

743

Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells were used as target cells. The target cells were transfected with

744

a plasmid expressing omega-gal. Alpha-complementation assays were performed one

745

day after transfection, as described above.

747

Virus infectivity and cold sensitivity

748

Luciferase-containing recombinant lentivirus and VSV-ΔG vectors pseudotyped with

749

SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants were produced as described above. The recombinant

750

viruses were incubated with 293T-ACE2 cells, and 24-48 hours later, luciferase activity

751

in the cells was measured. To measure cold sensitivity, the viruses were incubated on

752

ice for various lengths of time prior to measuring their infectivity, as described above.

Virus neutralization by sACE2 and sera

755

Neutralization assays were performed by adding 200-300 TCID50 of rVSV-ΔG

756

pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants into serial dilutions of sACE2 and sera.

757

The mixture was dispensed onto a 96-well plate in triplicate and incubated for 1 h at

Stability of spike protein on VLPs

767

To prepare lentivirus particles containing wild-type or D614G S gp, ~7x106 293T cells in

768

T75 flasks were transfected with 7.5 µg psPAX2 and 7.5 µg of the S-expressing

769

pcDNA3.1 plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000. Mock controls did not include the psPAX2

770

plasmid. Two days later, cell supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation at

771

1,500 x g for 15 min and filtered (0.45-µm). VLP-containing supernatants were

772

incubated at 37°C for various lengths of time. Then the VLPs were pelleted at 14,000 x

773

g for 1 hr at 4°C. The pellets were suspended in 50 µl of 1X LDS buffer containing 100

774

mM DTT, and Western blotted using rabbit anti-S1, rabbit anti-S2 and anti-p55/p24/p17

791

and incubated at different temperatures for 1 hr, cooled on ice and then incubated with

792

Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hr at 4oC. Beads were washed

793

3 times with lysis buffer at 4oC. After washing, beads were resuspended in 1X LDS and

Palmitoylation assay

798

Potential palmitoylation sites on the SARS-CoV-2 S2 glycoprotein were studied using

799

acyl-PEG exchange (68). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids

800

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants. Cell lysates in 4% SDS (~100 µg total

801

protein) were treated with 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride and

802

rotated at 350 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 25 mM NEM was added and

803

the sample was incubated at room temperature for 2 hr. The reaction was terminated

804

and washed with prechilled methanol-chloroform-H2O (4:1.5:3) sequentially three times.

805

The protein precipitates were dissolved in 60 µl of TEA buffer with 4 mM EDTA and 4%

806

SDS. Half of the dissolved protein solution was mixed with 1 M hydroxylamine in TEA

SDS by incubation at 50oC for 10 minutes. The protein solutions were mixed with 1.33

812

mM mPEG-mal in TEA + 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated at 25°C for 2 hr by nutation

813

at 350 rpm. Reactions were stopped by adding prechilled methanol-chloroform-H2O as

814

mentioned above. The protein pellets were dissolved with 1X LDS buffer + 100 mM DTT

815

and subjected to Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-S2 antibody.

FIGURE LEGENDS

1146

FIG 1. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein mutants. A schematic representation of the

1147

SARS-CoV-2 S gp is shown, with the boundaries of the mature S1, S2 and S2′

1148

glycoproteins indicated. The S gp regions include the signal peptide (Sig), the N-

1149

terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), C-terminal domains (CTD1 and

1150

CTD2), fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), central helical

1151

region (CH), the connector domain (CD), transmembrane region (TM),

1152

endodomain/cytoplasmic tail (CT) and endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (ERsig).

1153

The changes associated with the S gp mutants studied here are shown. For the S2

1154

cytoplasmic tail mutants, the C-termini of the wild-type and mutant S glycoproteins are

1155

depicted, with the positions of cysteine residues indicated by vertical tick marks.

1156
1157

FIG 2. Expression and processing of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants. 293T cells were

1158

cotransfected with a plasmid encoding HIV-1 Gag/protease and either pcDNA3.1 or

1159

plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-1 S gp or wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 S

1160

glycoproteins. In Lane 2 (CoV-2 S (Gag-)), 293T cells express the wild-type SARS-

1161

CoV-2 S gp without HIV-1 Gag. Cell lysates and VLPs were Western blotted for the S1

1162

and S2 glycoproteins. Cell-surface S glycoproteins were precipitated by convalescent

1163

serum NYP01 and then Western blotted for the S1 and S2 glycoproteins (Note that

1164

NYP01 does not recognize the SARS-CoV-1 S gp). Cell lysates were Western blotted

1165

for actin, and VLPs for HIV-1 p24 and p17 Gag proteins. The results shown are

1166

representative of those obtained in at least two independent experiments.

FIG 3. Subunit association, VLP incorporation and glycosylation of S gp variants. (A)

1169

293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated SARS-CoV-2 S gp

1170

variants. Forty-eight hours later, cell supernatants were filtered (0.45-µm) and

1171

precipitated with the convalescent NYP01 serum. The precipitated proteins (Sup, lower

1172

panel) and cell lysates (upper panel) were Western blotted with a mouse antibody

1173

against S1. Cell lysates were also Western blotted with an antibody against actin. (B)

1174

293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 Gag/protease and wild-type

1175

S gp, separately or together. Two days after transfection, the cell supernatants were

1176

cleared by low-speed centrifugation, filtered (0.45-µm) and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for

1177

one hour. The pellets were Western blotted for S2 (upper panel) or Gag (lower panel).

1178

(C) 293T cells expressing the HIV-1 Gag/protease and the SARS-CoV-1 (Lane 1) or

1179

wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins were used to prepare cell lysates or

1180

VLPs. Cell-surface proteins were precipitated by the convalescent serum NYP01. The

1181

samples were either mock-treated or treated with Endoglycosidase Hf (green) or

1182

PNGase F (red) and then Western blotted for the S1 gp. (D) 293T cells expressing the

1183

wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp alone or the S gp with the SARS-CoV-2 M or M, E and N

1184

proteins or with HIV-1 Gag/protease were treated with Brefeldin A (+BFA) or mock-

1185

treated (-BFA) six hours after transfection. The cells were then used to prepare cell

1186

lysates, VLPs or cell-surface proteins, as above. The samples were either mock-treated

1187

or treated with PNGase F (red) and then Western blotted for the S1 and S2

1188

glycoproteins. The gels in panels A, C and D are representative of those obtained in

1189

two independent experiments.

FIG 4. Incorporation of SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants in VSV vectors. 293T cells

1192

expressing the indicated SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants and transduced with a recombinant

1193

VSVΔG vector were used to analyze the S glycoproteins in cell lysates, on the cell

1194

surface and on VLPs. The S glycoproteins were analyzed as described in the Fig. 2

1195

legend except that, in this case, a mouse antibody against S1 was used for Western

1196

blotting. The VLP samples were also blotted with an anti-VSV-N antibody. The results

1197

shown are representative of those obtained in two independent experiments.

FIG 5. Cytopathic effects mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants. (A) The

1200

indicated number of 293T-S cells or 293T-S-ACE2 cells, both of which inducibly express

1201

the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter,

1202

were plated in medium with or without doxycycline. On the indicated days after

1203

induction with doxycycline, the cells were evaluated by the MTT assay. (B) 293T-ACE2

1204

cells were transfected either with a plasmid expressing enhanced green fluorescent

1205

protein (eGFP) alone (Mock) or with the eGFP-expressing plasmid and a plasmid

1206

expressing SARS-CoV-1 S gp or wild-type or mutant SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins.

1207

After 24 hours, the cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope. The results

1208

shown are representative of those obtained in two independent experiments.

FIG 6. Phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 S gp variants. Using Western blots similar to that

1211

shown in Fig. 2, the total levels of S gp (uncleaved S + S1 + S2) in cell lysates and

1212

VLPs and on the surface of 293T cells expressing HIV-1 Gag/protease and the

1213

indicated S variant were calculated. The values were normalized to those observed for

1214

the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp. The processing index represents the product of the

1215

S1/uncleaved S and S2/uncleaved S ratios for each S variant, relative to that of the

1216

wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp. The association of the S1 and S2 subunits was assessed

1217

by measuring the ratio of S1 in lysates to S1 in the supernatants of 293T cells

1218

transfected with plasmids expressing the S gp variant alone; the lysate/supernatant S1

1219

ratio for each S gp variant was then normalized to that observed for the wild-type

1220

SARS-CoV-2 S gp. Cell-cell fusion represents the activity observed in the alpha-

1221

complementation assay for effector cells expressing the indicated S gp variant and

1222

ACE2-expressing 293T target cells, relative to the activity observed for the wild-type

1223

SARS-CoV-2 S gp. Syncytia were scored by size visually from experiments similar to

1224

that shown in Fig. 5B. The infectivity of lentiviruses pseudotyped with the S gp variants,

1225

relative to that observed for a virus with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp, was assessed

1226

on 293T-ACE2 target cells. The means and standard deviations derived from at least

1227

two independent experiments are shown. NA – not applicable.

1231

indicated S gp variants for 293T-ACE2 target cells transfected either with pcDNA3.1 or

1232

a TMPRSS2-expressing plasmid is shown, relative to the value for the wild-type S gp in

1233

293T-ACE2 target cells. The fold increase in infection associated with TMPRSS2

1234

expression in the target cells is indicated above the bar graphs. (B) Effector cells

were incubated with various concentrations (0 - 300 nM) of soluble ACE2 (sACE2) for 1

1264

hr on ice. The VLPs were pelleted and lysed. VLP lysates were Western blotted for S1,

1265

S2 and ACE2. HIV-1 p24 and p17 Gag proteins in the VLP lysates were detected by

1266

Coomasie blue staining. (B) HIV-1 VLPs pseudotyped with the wild-type or D614G

1267

glycoproteins were incubated with the indicated concentrations of sACE2 for 1 hr at

1268

37°C. The VLPs were pelleted and lysed. VLP lysates were Western blotted for S1 and

1269

S2, and HIV-1 p24 and p17 Gag proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie

1270

blue. The S1/S ratio as a function of sACE2 concentration is shown in the graphs in the

1271

middle and right panels. In the graph on the right, the S1/S ratios are normalized to that

1272

seen for the wild-type S gp in the absence of sACE2, which is set at 100%. (C) HIV-1

1273

VLPs pseudotyped with the wild-type or D614G S glycoproteins were incubated at 37°C

1274

for the indicated number of days, after which the VLPs were pelleted, lysed and

1275

Western blotted. As negative controls, supernatants from 293T cells expressing the S

1276

glycoproteins without HIV-1 Gag were processed in parallel (lanes 1 and 2, Gag-). (D)

1277

Lysates from 293T cells transiently expressing the His6-tagged wild-type or D614G

1278

glycoproteins were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 1 hr. The S

1279

glycoproteins were then precipitated by Ni-NTA resin and Western blotted. The blots

1280

shown are representative of those obtained in two independent experiments and the

1281

1287

mutants were subjected to acyl-PEG exchange (68). When NH2OH is left out,

1288

palmitoylated cysteine residues are not de-acylated and therefore not available for

1289

reaction with mPEG-maleimide. The cell lysates were Western blotted with an anti-S2

1290

antibody. The mono-PEGylated (S2*) and di-PEGylated (S2**) species are indicated.

1291

Note that the ΔCT mutant retains two membrane-proximal cysteine residues. The

1292

FIG 11. Metalloprotease inhibitors block S-mediated cell-cell fusion and syncytium

1295

formation. (A) The effect of marimastat and ilomastat, two matrix metalloprotease

1296

inhibitors, on two parallel alpha-complementation assays was tested. In one assay, the

1297

effector cells express the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp and 293T cells expressing ACE2

1298

were used as target cells. In the second assay, the effector cells express the HIV-1AD8

1299

envelope glycoproteins and the target cells express the CD4 and CCR5 receptors.

1300

Target cells were treated with 10 µM inhibitor for 2 hr and then cocultivated with effector

1301

cells for 4 hr. The β-galactosidase values were normalized to those seen in the

1302

absence of inhibitors. The means and standard deviations from at least two

1303

independent experiments are shown. (B) 293T-ACE2 cells were cotransfected with

1304

plasmids expressing eGFP and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp, after which ilomastat

1305

(10 µM) or marimastat (10 µM) was added. For the HIV-1 control, 293T cells were

1306

transfected with plasmids expressing eGFP, CD4, CCR5 and the HIV-1JR-FL envelope

1307

glycoproteins. The cells were imaged 24 hours after transfection. (C) The time course

1308

is shown for 293T-ACE2 cells transfected with an eGFP-expressing plasmid and either

1309

pcDNA3.1 or a plasmid expressing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp, in the absence (S)

1313

ACE2. The cells were untreated or treated with marimastat (10 µM) or ilomastat (10

1314

µM). Cell lysates were Western blotted with antibodies against S1 and S2. The results

1315

shown in panels B and C are representative of those obtained in two independent

FIG 12. Effect of inhibitors in the absence and presence of TMPRSS2 expression in

1320

target cells on SARS-CoV-2 S gp-mediated cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation. (A)

1321

In this alpha-complementation assay, 293T target cells expressing ACE2 only or ACE2

1322

+ TMPRSS2 were incubated with ilomastat and marimastat at the indicated

1323

concentration for 2 hours before cocultivation with effector cells expressing wild-type or

1324

D614G S gp for 4 hours. The results with target cells expressing ACE2 are shown as

1325

solid lines, and the results with target cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are shown

1326

as dashed lines. In (B,C), we tested the effects of camostat mesylate (100 µM) and

1327

marimastat (10 µM) individually or in combination on cell-cell fusion (B) and syncytium

1328

formation (C) in cells expressing ACE2 with or without TMPRSS2 (See Methods). In

1329

(B), 293T-S cells inducible with doxycycline were used as effector cells. (D) In the

1330

alpha-complementation assays measuring cell-cell fusion mediated by the wild-type

1331

SARS-CoV-2 S gp and the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, treatment of the effector cells

1332

with 100 µM 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) reduced cell-cell fusion. (E) 293T cells

1333

expressing the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S gp were mock-treated or treated with 100 µM

1334

2-BP. Lysates from these cells were subjected to acyl-PEG exchange as in Fig. 10 and

1336

also results in decreased S gp processing. The results shown in panels A, C and E are

1337

representative of those obtained in two independent experiments. In panels B and D,

1338

the means and standard deviations from two independent experiments are shown.

function. The conformational transitions of the SARS-CoV-2 S gp during functional

1344

activation by ACE2 binding and proteolytic cleavage are depicted. The proposed

1345

effects of changes in S gp reactivity/triggerability on viral phenotypes follow from studies

1346

of other Class I viral envelope glycoproteins (33,72,73,93). The wild-type, FurinMut and

D614G S glycoproteins are positioned along the pathway according to their phenotypes.
