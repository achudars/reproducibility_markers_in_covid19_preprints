Abstract

29

S. Ray and A. Reddy recently anticipated the implication of circadian rhythm in severe acute

30

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of the coronavirus

31

disease (Covid-19). In addition to its key role in the regulation of biological functions, the circadian

32

rhythm has been suggested as a regulator of viral infections. Specifically, the time of day of infection

33

was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial

34

and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus

35

infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects.

36

The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR.

37

Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by

38

One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-10 levels were also

39

measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1 and

40

Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at

41

Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus

42

increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was

43

associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1 and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results

44

suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response.

45

They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose

46

circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.

The implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They

Introductory

61

The implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory

62

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently anticipated (1, 2). The CR regulates

63

physiological processes in living organisms with a period of 24 hours (3). Rhythmicity depends on

64

central and peripheral oscillators whose activity relies on two main feedback loops managed by a

65

clock genes cascade under the regulation of the main clock gene Bmal1 (3). The host susceptibility to

66

microorganism is likely under control of biological clocks (4). The time of day of infection is critical

67

for illness progression as reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3

68

viruses (5–7). We previously reported that CR is a key actor at the interface between infection

69

susceptibility, clinical presentation and prognosis of infection (4, 8).

70

There are some evidences that enable to anticipate the role of CR in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

71

The absence of Bmal1 has an impact on intracellular replication of coronaviruses, especially

72

vesicular trafficking, endoplasmic reticulum and protein biosynthesis (9). Knock-out of Bmal1

73

markedly decreases the replication of several viruses such as Dengue or Zika (10). Finally, among

74

key proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the host recently published (11), it has been

75

identified 30% of them being associated with circadian pathway (1). Clearly, the evidences of an

76

implication of CR in SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells are lacking. In this study, we wondered

77

if SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production by human monocytes, innate immune cells

78

affected by Covid-19, were regulated by CR.

Results and Discussion

80

We first wondered if the infection of monocytes, innate immune cells affected by Covid-19

81

(12), obey to circadian oscillations. Every 3 hours during 24 hours, total RNA was extracted and

82

expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated in unstimulated monocytes as previously

83

described (8). Expression of investigating genes exhibited CR in monocytes with an acrophase (peak

84

of the rhythm) and a bathyphase (trough of the rhythm) at Zeitgeber (German name for synchronizer)

85

Time (ZT)6 and ZT17 (Fig.1A). These two time points represent the beginning of the active and the

86

resting periods in humans (13). To assess the involvement of CR in infection of monocytes with

87

SARS-CoV-2, we incubated monocytes with SARS-CoV-2 during the bathyphase (ZT6) and

88

acrophase (ZT17) during 48 hours. Then, viral RNA was extracted to evaluate Covid-19 virus

89

amount and the phagocytosis index was calculated at ZT6 and ZT17 using immunofluorescence. The

90

amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus was higher in monocytes cultured at ZT6 than at ZT17, suggesting a

91

daytime dependent of viral multiplication (Fig.1B). This result was strengthened by high

92

phagocytosis index at ZT6 compared to ZT17 (Fig.1C). Our data showed for the first time that entry

93

and multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 in human monocytes varies with the time of day. This finding is

94

reminiscent of what has been previously reported with herpes and influenza virus in murine models

95

of infection (6, 7). It is noteworthy that CRs are different in rodents and humans, thus limitating

96

extrapolations to understand pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

97

Covid-19 disease is characterized by runaway immune system leading to a cytokine storm

98

consisting of high circulating levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-1 and IL-10 (14). We wondered

99

if the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with monocytes affected cytokine production at two points of the

100

CR. The amounts of IL-1, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased at ZT6 (Fig.1D) when the

101

amount of infection is highest. Hence, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with monocytes resulted in

102

distinct cytokine pattern according to daytime.

103

We demonstrate here that the time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection determines consistently

104

viral infection/replication and host immune response. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 exploits clock

105

pathway for its own gain. Our findings support consideration of CR in SARS-CoV-2 disease

106

progression and suggest that CR represents a novel target for managing viral progression. This study

107

also highlights the importance of the time of treatment administration to Covid-19 patients since CR

108

was found regulating pharmacokinetics of several drugs (15). Several treatments are proposed to

109

prevent the occurrence of severe forms in Covid-19. They include passive immunization, cytokines,

110

anti-cytokine antibody or corticoids (16). All these candidates affect the immune response known to

111

oscillate during the day and their administration according to CR of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the well-

Methods

115

Cells and virus

116

SARS-CoV-2 strain MI6 was cultured in Vero E6 cells (American type culture collection ATCC®

117

CRL-1586™) in Minimum Essential Media (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented

118

with 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS), as previously described (18).

119

Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors

120

(convention n°7828, Etablissement Français du Sang, Marseille, France) following CD14 selection

121

using MACS magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch, Germany) as previously described (19).

122

Monocytes were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium-1640 (Life Technologies)

123

containing 10% of FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies).

124

Monocytes were infected with 50 µl virus suspension (0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI)) during

125

bathyphase (ZT6) and acrophase (ZT17) for 48 hours at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2.

126
127

Circadian gene expression

128

Total RNA was extracted using the RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and a quantitative Real-Time PCR was

129

performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (MMLV Kit, Life Technologies and Smart

130

SYBRGreen kit, Roche Applied Science). Circadian gene expression was investigated using specific

131

primers targeting Bmal1 and Clock genes (8). Results were normalized using the housekeeping

132

endogenous control actb gene (-actin). The results are expressed according to the appropriate

133

formula: gene expression = Log (2-ΔCt) relative expression, with Ct (Cycle threshold), ΔCt = Ct target

134

gene - Ct β-actin. The Cosinor analysis based on an extrapolation from measurements of a few points

135

over 24 hours was used to evaluate the CR of the clock genes Bmal1 and Clock.

136
137

Viral RNA extraction and PCR

138

Viral RNA was extracted from the infected cells using NucleoSpin® Viral RNA Isolation kit

139

(Macherey-Nagel) and Covid-19 virus detection was performed using One-Step qRT-PCR

140

SuperScript™ III Platinum™ (Life Technologies) targeting the gene E, as previously described (20).

141
142

Immunofluorescence

143

Infected cells (5. 105 cells/well) were fixed and incubated with phalloidin-555 and 4',6-diamidino-2-

144

phenylindole (DAPI) to labelled F-actin and nucleus respectively. SARS-CoV-2 virus was labelled

145

using first an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Spike protein, Thermo Fischer) and then a secondary anti-

146

rabbit Alexa 647 (Thermo Fisher).

147

Pictures were acquired using confocal microscopy (LSM 8000 Airyscan confocal microscope, x 63,

148

oil objective) and the phagocytosis index was calculated according to the following formula:

149

percentage of phagocytosis ((average number of infected cells x 100)/total number of counted cells)

150

x average number of particles or viruses/cells).

151
152

Immunoassays

153

Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-10 were measured in cell supernatants using an enzyme-

154

linked immunosorbent assay technique (R&D systems). The sensitivity of the assays was (pg/ml)

155

15.4 for IL-6, 0.125 for IL-1β and 3.9 for IL-10.

156
157

Statistical analysis

158

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (7.0, La Jolla, CA) and R studio v3.4.0.

159

Continuous variables were expressed as medians ± interquartile, and comparisons between two

160

groups were made using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test for unmatched data and the Student

161

t-test for matched data. Statistical significance was defined as P≤0.05.
