Abstract

35

The spike D614G mutation increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, viral load, and transmission

36

but the molecular mechanism underlying these effects remains unclear. We report here

37

that spike is trafficked to lysosomes and that the D614G mutation enhances the lysosomal

38

sorting of spike and the lysosomal accumulation of spike-positive punctae in SARS-CoV-

39

2-infected cells. Spike trafficking to lysosomes is an endocytosis-independent, V-

40

ATPase-dependent process, and spike-containing lysosomes drive lysosome clustering

41

but display poor lysotracker labeling and reduced uptake of endocytosed materials. These

42

results are consistent with a lysosomal pathway of coronavirus biogenesis and raise the

43

possibility that a common mechanism may underly the D614G mutationâ€™s effects on spike

44

protein trafficking in infected cells and the accelerated entry of SARS-CoV-2 into

45

uninfected cells.

Introduction

47

COVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease 2019) is caused by infection with the

48

enveloped virus SARS-CoV-2, a member of the betacoronavirus family (Coronaviridae

49

Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). In

50

just one year, SARS-CoV-2 has infected >65 million people, killed >1.5 million people,

51

and caused extensive morbidity among survivors. Of all the RNA viruses, coronavirus

52

have the largest genomes, encoding more than two dozen proteins (Wang et al., 2020).

53

However, leading vaccine candidates elicit immunity to just a single protein, spike (Poland

54

et al., 2020), which mediates the first two steps in the replication cycle: cell binding and

55

fusion of viral and cellular membranes.

56
57

SARS-CoV-2 entry leads to translation of its viral genomic RNA (gRNA) into the orf1a

58

and orf1a/b polyproteins (V'Kovski et al., 2020). These are then processed to generate

59

16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that reprogram the cell for viral replication and drive the

60

synthesis of subgenomic viral mRNAs. These encode the four major structural proteins

61

of mature virions (nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E)) and nine

62

additional ORFs (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c, & 10) that together drive virus particle

63

assembly and release. The spike, membrane and envelope proteins are sufficient to drive

64

the formation of virus-like-particles and are thought to drive virion budding as well. This

65

occurs following the synthesis of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and

66

their vesicle-mediated transport to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)

67

(Ruch and Machamer, 2012; Ujike and Taguchi, 2015). As for how fully-formed virus

68

particles (Yao et al., 2020) are released from infected cells, the prevailing model has been

69

that they are released by the biosynthetic secretory pathway (Ujike and Taguchi, 2015).

70

However, Altan-Bonnet and colleagues recently demonstrated that egress of mouse

71

hepatitis virus (MHV, another betacoronavirus) does not require the biosynthetic

72

secretory pathway, and instead uses an Arl8-dependent, lysosomal pathway of egress

73

(Ghosh et al., 2020).

74
75

Shortly after its entry into the human population, a variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 arose

76

that displays multiple hallmarks of increased viral fitness, including a higher rate of

77

transmission, elevated viral load in vivo, and enhanced infectivity in vitro (Hou et al., 2020;

78

Korber et al., 2020; Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2020) This variant contains a mutation in the

79

spike gene, D614G, that replaces the aspartate at position 614 with a glycine. This

80

mutation lies N-terminal to the polybasic site cleavage site (682RRAR685), a cleavage

81

event that is essential to virus replication and generates the non-covalently associated N-

82

terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 proteins (Hoffmann et al., 2020a; Hoffmann et al., 2020b).

83

The spike S1 domain binds SARS-CoV-2 receptors, primarily angiotensin converting

84

enzyme-2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Matheson and Lehner, 2020; Zhou et al.,

85

2020)(Wrapp et al., 2020) but also neuropilin-1 (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Daly et

86

al., 2020), and yet, there is as yet no evidence that the D614G mutation alters the affinity

87

of S1 for its receptors or for target cells. In fact, ultrastructural and biochemical analyses

88

of matched D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 viruses show no differences in their

89

appearance in electron micrographs, and also no difference in levels of virion-associated

90

spike proteins (Hou et al., 2020).

92

Here we extend our understanding of the spike D614G mutation by demonstrating that it

93

shifts spike protein trafficking towards the lysosome and away from organelles of the

94

biosynthetic secretory pathway. This shift is reflected in the localization of SARS-CoV-2

95

spike protein when expressed on its own, outside the context of an infected cell, and also

96

in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. These and other results raise the possibility

97

that that a single, lysosome-related mechanism may explain the pleiotropic effects of the

98

D614G mutation on spike protein biogenesis, accelerated virus entry, and enhanced

99

infectivity.

Validating IFM-based SARS-CoV-2 serology tests

104

Fluorescence microscopy offers many advantages as a serology test platform, including

105

high sensitivity, broad dynamic range, use of proteins in their native conformation and

106

biological context, ability to incorporate in-sample controls that minimize false positive

107

and false negative results, and the potential to interrogate multiple antibody responses in

108

a single sample. As a first step towards the development of such an assay for SARS-

109

CoV-2 antibodies, we generated cell lines designed to express the SARS-CoV-2

110

nucleocapsid, spike, or membrane proteins in response to doxycycline. These Htet1/N,

111

Htet1/S**, and Htet1/M cell lines were subjected to immunoblot analysis, which confirmed

112

that each cell line expressed its cognate SARS-CoV-2 protein in response to doxycycline

113

(supplemental figure S1). It should be noted that S** corresponds to full-length spike

114

that carries a pair of trimer-stabilizing proline mutations (986KV987 to 986PP987) and a

115

quartet of substitutions at the S1/S2 protease cleavage site (682RRAR685 to

116

682GSAG685), a form of spike that displays the prefusion conformation (Wrapp et al.,

117

2020) and may therefore be particularly effective at capturing neutralizing anti-spike

118

antibodies.

119
120

We next seeded Htet1/N, Htet1/S**, and Htet1/M cells into 96-well glass-bottom tissue

121

culture plates along with ~10% Htet1 cells (to serve as an internal negative control),

122

incubated the cells overnight in doxycycline-containing media, and then processed these

123

cells for immunofluorescence microscopy. In this format, the fixed adherent cells serve

124

as a solid support for capturing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from patient plasmas, the

125

presence of human antibodies bound to the viral protein is detected using fluorescently-

126

tagged donkey antibodies specific to human immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IA),

127

mCherry identifies the viral protein-expressing cells, and DAPI stains the nucleus. When

128

these cells were tested using 40 control plasmas (all collected prior to the COVID-19

129

pandemic), we failed to detect any specific reaction to the N, S** or M proteins (Fig. 1,

130

top row; supplemental figures S2-S5).

131
132

In contrast, plasmas from hospitalized, PCR-confirmed, COVID-19 patients (collected on

133

day 0 of admittance into Johns Hopkins Hospital during April 2020) displayed a variety of

134

reactivities towards the N, S**, and M proteins. Of the 30 COVID-19 patient plasmas that

135

were tested, 23 (~3/4) contained antibodies that bound to N-expressing cells, 20 (~2/3)

136

contained antibodies that bound to S**-expressing cells, and 13 (~1/2) scored positive for

137

the presence of anti-M antibodies (Fig. 1, rows 2-6; supplemental figures S6, S7).

138

Moreover, all plasmas with anti-M antibodies also contained anti-N and anti-S antibodies

139

(Table 1). These results establish the validity of microscopy-based serology testing,

140

indicate that the levels of anti-M antibodies may be a more reliable indicator of a deep

141

and broad antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are generally consistent

142

with prior studies of COVID-19 patient antibody responses (Grzelak et al., 2020; Whitman

143

et al., 2020),

146

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to oscillate between multiple conformational

147

states (Ke et al., 2020) and the anti-spike antibody responses of COVID-19 patients may

148

allow us to detect functionally significant fluctuations in spike protein confirmation within

149

its native context of the human cell. Given that the 986KV987 to 986PP987 and

150

682RRAR685 to 682GSAG685 substitutions present in the S** protein are designed to

151

limit such conformational fluctuations (Wrapp et al., 2020), we developed cell lines that

152

express functional forms of spike. Htet1/SW1 was engineered to express the spike protein

153

encoded by the Wuhan-1 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020) and was probed with

154

plasmas with a small subset of COVID-19 patients (i.e. E12, E9, 5, and G4). Some of

155

these plasmas (plasmas E12 and E9) generated an antibody staining pattern against the

156

SW1 protein that conformed to the expected distribution, namely strong staining at the

157

plasma membrane and in some cells in the Golgi, shown here by the occasional co-

158

localization with GM130 (Fig. 3, left column). However, staining with other plasmas (5,

159

G4) allowed the detection of yet another subpopulation of spike proteins within large, non-

160

Golgi, intracellular structures.

161
162

These results indicate that spike expression in human cells leads to the creation of

163

antigenically distinct subpopulations of spike that display different subcellular

164

distributions, and furthermore, that COVID-19 patients vary significantly in their

165

development of antibodies to these different conformations. In light of these findings, we

166

tested whether plasma antibodies might shed light on the effects of the spike D614G

167

mutation, which is known to enhance viral fitness through an increase in SARS-CoV-2

168

infectivity and transmission (Hou et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Lorenzo-Redondo et

169

al., 2020). Towards this end, we generated the Htet1/SD614G cell line and interrogated

170

SD614G-expressing cells using the same four plasmas (Fig. 3, right column). Although

171

this form of spike differs from SW1 by just a single amino acid, all four plasmas revealed

172

enhanced staining of spike in these large, non-Golgi intracellular compartments, raising

173

the possibility that the D614G mutation either enhances the trafficking of spike to these

174

compartments or enhances a conformational shift that allows its detection by the

175

antibodies in these plasmas.

176
177

SARS-CoV-2 spike is trafficked to lysosomes

178

Given the central role of spike in SARS-CoV-2 biology, the pronounced impact of the

179

D614G mutation on the COVID-19 pandemic, and the fact that all leading vaccine

180

candidates are based solely on spike, we sought to determine the identity of these large,

181

spike-containing structures. This was done by inducing Htet1/SD614G cells to express

182

spike and then processing the cells for immunofluorescence microscopy using plasma

183

G4 and antibodies directed against marker proteins of various subcellular compartments.

184

These experiments showed no labeling of these structures with markers of the ER

185

(calnexin and BiP), the ERGIC (ERGIC53 and ERGIC3,) the Golgi (GM130), endosomes

186

(EEA1) or the plasma membrane (CD810 (supplemental figure S8). However, these

187

structures did label with antibodies specific for lysosomal membrane markers Lamp1 and

188

Lamp2 (Fig. 3A, B) and the lysosome-associated proteins Lamp3 (CD63) and mTOR

189

(Fig. 3C, D). It has recently been shown that MHV-infected cells mislocalize the KDEL

190

receptor (KDELR) from the ER and Golgi to the lysosome as part of virus-mediated

191

reprogramming of host secretory pathways (Ghosh et al., 2020), and we observed that

10

192

spike expression induced a redistribution of the KDEL receptor to the lysosome in a

193

portion of spike-expressing cells (Fig. 3E).

194
195

These experiments revealed that lysosomes of spike-expressing cells accumulated in

196

large clusters, a phenotype that was relatively uncommon in non-expressing cells. This

197

appearance is likely due to lysosome clustering rather than lysosome fusion, and to test

198

this hypothesis we examined SD614G and Lamp2 distibution following a brief exposure to

199

vacuolin-1, a PIKfyve inhibitor known to induce lysosome swelling (Huynh and Andrews,

200

2005; Sano et al., 2016). As expected, cells treated with vacuolin-1 contained swollen

201

lysosomes several micrometers in diameter (Fig. 4A-C). Importantly, the membranes of

202

these swollen lysosomes were labeled for both SD614G and Lamp2, confirming that these

203

proteins were indeed co-localized in lysosome membranes. Moreover, the sizes and

204

numbers of these lysosomes appeared to be similar in expressing and non-expressing

205

cells, indicating that spike expression induces lysosome clustering rather than lysosome

206

fusion.

207
208

Spike expression disrupts lysosome function

209

Lysosomes are the terminal destination for materials brought into the cell by fluid-phase

210

endocytosis (Braulke and Bonifacino, 2009), a process that can be monitored by

211

incubating cells with fluorescently-labeled, high molecular weight dextrans (Ohkuma,

212

1989). To determine whether spike-containing lysosomes retained this core function of

213

lysosomes, we incubated Htet1/SD614G cells with Alexa Fluor-647-labeled dextran (~10

214

kDa), followed by a 3-hour chase in label-free media to allow endocytosed material to

11

215

reach the lysosome. Furthermore, we performed these experiments on cells that had only

216

been induced to express spike for 20 hours rather than several days, to increase the

217

probability that we visualize cells at an earlier stage of lysosome clustering when

218

individual lysosomes could still be resolved. This presumption was borne out by the

219

extensive co-localization of spike and Lamp2 in small lysosomes scattered throughout

220

the cytoplasm of control Htet1/SD614G cells (Fig. 4D). As for whether spike-containing

221

lysosomes were able to accumulate A647-dextran uptake similarly to other lysosomes in

222

the cell, or in other cells, we observed that spike-containing lysosomes displayed little if

223

any A647-dextran fluorescence, even in cells that contained many spike-negative, A647-

224

dextran-positive lysosomes (Fig. 4E, F). Interestingly, both populations of lysosomes

225

within these cells (spike+, A647- and spike-, A647+) appeared to cluster together in cells

226

that had larger lysosome clusters.

227
228

Lysosome acidification is another hallmark of lysosome function, and is catalyzed by the

229

vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) proton pump (Futai et al., 2019). A number of probes have

230

been developed that label acidic compartments (Chazotte, 2011), including the

231

lysotracker series of probes. To determine whether spike-containing lysosomes have a

232

pH similar to spike-negative lysosomes, we labeled Htet1/SD614G cells with Lysotracker

233

Deep Red and then processed the cells for immunofluorescence microscopy using

234

plasma G4 to detect the lysosomal forms of spike. Lysotracker Deep Red labeled many

235

lysosomes brightly, and while some spike-containing lysosomes displayed labeling

236

consistent with an acidic lumen, many of the spike-containing lysosomes displayed

237

relatively low or no lysotracker fluorescences (Fig. 4G).

238
239

Spike trafficking to lysosomes is resistant to inhibitors of endocytosis,

240

microtubules, and secretion but sensitive to V-ATPase inhibition

241

Proteins can be trafficked to lysosomes following endocytosis from the plasma membrane

242

by a pathway that often effects their destruction, or by direct intracellular vesicle traffic

243

(Braulke and Bonifacino, 2009). To determine whether the lysosomal trafficking of spike

244

occurs via the endocytic pathway so often associated with cargo protein destruction, we

245

incubated Htet1/SD614G cells with doxycycline for 14 hours in the presence of vehicle alone

246

(DMSO) or in media containing either of two inhibitors of endocytosis, the dynamin-1

247

inhibitor dynasore, which blocks clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Kirchhausen et al.,

248

2008), or the clathrin inhibitor pitstop2, which blocks both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-

249

independent endocytosis (Dutta et al., 2012). Htet1/SD614G cells incubated with vehicle

250

alone (DMSO) localized spike to Lamp2-positive lysosomes (Fig. 5A) and the same was

251

observed for Htet1/SD614G cells incubated with either dynasore or pitstop2 (Fig. 5B, C).

252
253

The microtubule-inhibitor nocodazole, while not a general inhibitor of endocytosis, has

254

been shown to impair the lysosomal uptake of selected endocytosed proteins (Tacheva-

255

Grigorova et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known to affect lysosome function by blocking

256

microtubule-dependent

257

(Cabukusta and Neefjes, 2018). Addition of nocodazole had no discernable effect on the

258

lysosomal sorting of spike (Fig. 5D) and while it had some effect on lysosome distribution,

259

it did not prevent spike-induced lysosome clustering. Lysosome function is more severely

260

inhibited by bafilomycin A1, a potent inhibitor of the V-ATPase that blocks acidification of

retrograde

and

anterograde

movements

lysosomes

explore its effects on the lysosomal sorting of spike, cells were incubated with bafilomycin

throughout the period of spike induction and then processed for immunofluorescence

is a V-ATPase-dependent process. Interestingly, the lysosomes of bafilomycin-treated

269

cells showed little if any clustering.

The D614G mutation enhances the lysosomal sorting of spike

272

Given that the D614G mutation has a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and

273

transmission, we asked whether this mutation might impact the lysosomal sorting of spike.

274

Htet1/SW1 and Htet1/SD614G cells express spike in response to doxycycline, and at similar

275

levels (Fig. 6A). Significant amounts of spike are proteolytically processed at its

276

682RRAR685 motif to generate the S2 and S1 fragments, and these cells also contained

277

similar levels of both S2 and S1. However, the D614G mutation did induce a slight shift

278

in the relative extent of processing at the S1/S2 boundary, shown here by somewhat less

279

full-length spike in Htet1/SD614G cells relative to Htet1/SW1 cells.

285

lipid bilayer from the D614G mutation and the conformational changes it might induce.

286

Although both forms of spike displayed significant co-localization with the lysosomal

287

marker Lamp2, the D614G mutation appeared to induce a shift in spike protein sorting

288

towards the lysosome (Fig. 6B, C). Although the relative amounts of lysosome-localized

289

spike varied significantly from one cell to another in both cell populations, digital image

290

analysis quantified the effect of the D614G mutation as 54% increase in its lysosomal

291

staining (p = 0.00000024; Studentâ€™s t-test; 2-tailed; two-sample, unequal variance), from

292

an average of 817 +/- 44 (standard error of the mean (s.e.m.)) in Htet1/SW1 cells (n = 34

293

images) to an average of 1265 +/- 64 (s.e.m) in Htet1/SD614G cells (n = 37 images) (Fig.

294

295
296

These results suggest a model of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis in which the D614G mutation

297

enhances spike protein trafficking to the lysosome. Given the recent report that the

298

biogenesis of newly-synthesized MHV particles occurs via lysosomes and that MHV-

299

infected cells accumulate MHV particles in lysosomes (Ghosh et al., 2020), we tested

300

whether the D614G mutation might promote the lysosomal accumulation of spike and

301

spike-containing vesicles in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. More specifically, we infected

302

VeroE6TMPRSS2 cells with equal m.o.i. of a G614 strain of SARS-CoV-2 (HP7) or a

303

D614 strain of SARS-CoV-2 (HP76). 18 hours after initiation of infection, the two cell

304

populations were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for confocal immunofluorescence

305

microscopy using antibodies specific for spike and Lamp2 (Fig. 7). In cells infected with

306

the G614 virus, spike was localized primarily to small intracellular vesicles clustered in

308

with Lamp2, and especially in small, virus-sized punctae surrounded by Lamp2-positive

309

membrane (Fig. 7A-D). In contrast, spike distribution in D614 virus-infected cells was

310

distributed across a much broader array of intracellular compartments, especially the

311

plasma membrane and intracellular compartments distant from Lamp2-positive structures

312

(Fig. 7E-H). However, these differences were a matter of degree, as D614 spike also

313

displayed some labeling in Lamp2-positive and nearby compartments, as well as in small

314

spike-positive puncta surrounded by Lamp2-containing membrane.

316

Discussion

317

We show here that the spike D614G mutation alters spike protein sorting, enhancing its

318

trafficking towards the lysosome and away from other intracellular compartments. This

319

D614G-induced shift in spike protein trafficking was observed in human cells expressing

320

the spike protein on its own, outside the context of a viral infection, where it appeared to

321

enhance spike-induced lysosomes clustering. It was also observed in the context of

322

SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, as spike protein encoded by G614 virus displayed increased

323

association with lysosomes and reduced accumulation in non-lysosomal compartmets

324

and areas of the cell. Furthermore, we observed that cells infected by a G614 strain of

325

SARS-CoV-2 exhibited an enhanced accumulation of discrete, small, spike-containing

326

punctae within Lamp2-positive membranes. In addition, we observed that the D614G

327

mutation induced a slight elevation in spike protein processing at the S1/S2 junction. To

328

the best of our knowledge, the D614G-induced lysosomal shift in spike protein trafficking

329

and slight elevation in spike processing represent the earliest cell biological and

330

biochemical manifestations of the D614G mutation, raising the strong possibility that they

331

may contribute to the pronounced effects of the D614G mutation on SARS-CoV-2

332

infectivity, viral load, and transmission (Hou et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020; Lorenzo-

333

Redondo et al., 2020).

334
335

Numerous lines of evidence support our conclusion that spike is trafficked to the lysosome

336

membrane, including its co-localization with Lamp1, Lamp2, and Lamp3/CD63, its ring-

337

like staining in vacuolin-1-treated cells, its induction of lysosome clustering, and its

338

lysosomal localization when detected with a relatively conformation-independent antibody

339

probe (the affinity purified antibodies to its C-terminal 14 amino acids. As for how spike is

340

trafficked to lysosomes, our data indicate that it can occur independently of endocytosis,

341

as itâ€™s lysosomal accumulation was not blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-dependent or

342

clathrin-independent endocytosis. Spike trafficking to lysosomes was also unaffected by

343

the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole, even though nocodazole ablates

344

motor-directed lysosome movements. Spike trafficking to lysosomes was, however,

345

strongly inhibited by bafilomycin A1, a V-ATPase inhibitor, indicating that compartment

346

acidification is critical to the lysosomal trafficking of spike. These results are consistent

347

with those from a recent CRISPR-based screen for genes required for SARS-CoV-2

348

replication, which identified 13 components of the V-ATPase among the 50-most

349

important genes for SARS-CoV-2 replication (Daniloski et al., 2020).

350
351

In addition to being trafficked to lysosomes, the expression of spike appears to alter

352

lysosome function. This was apparent from the fact that spike expression induces a

353

pronounced clustering of lysosomes, especially in cells expressing the G614 form of spike

354

(Table 2). While we do not know the molecular mechanism by which spike expression

355

drives lysosome clustering, it appeared to be a microtubule-independent process, as it

356

was not inhibited by nocodazole, similar to previous studies of lysosome clustering (Ba et

357

al., 2018). Spike-induced alteration of lysosome function was also apparent from was the

358

fluorescent dextran uptake experiments, which revealed that spike-containing lysosomes

359

were defective in uptake of this fluid-phase endocytosis marker, and may also display a

360

somewhat reduced ability to acidify their lumen, as some spike-containing lysosomes

361

displayed low labeling with Lysotracker Deep Red.

362
363

Given that the D614G mutation enhances viral fitness, it is important to consider how viral

364

fitness might be promoted by an increase in the lysosomal sorting of spike and the

365

accumulation of spike-containing punctae within lysosomes of SARS-CoV-2-infected

366

cells. The most obvious possibility is that these changes facilitate the lysosomal phases

367

of SARS-CoV-2 virion biogenesis. This conclusion is based in part on the recent report

368

by Ghosh et al that MHV is released independently of the biosynthetic secretory pathway,

369

that MHV virions accumulate in lysosomes, that MHV release is an Arl8-dependent

370

lysosomal secretory pathway, and that SARSW-CoV-2 virions accumulate in a lysosome-

371

like structure of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Ghosh et al., 2020). This model of

372

coronavirus egress involves some degree of aberration to protein egress in general, as

373

MHV infection induced the lysosomal trafficking of the KDEL receptor (Ghosh et al.,

374

2020), a phenotype that we observed for spike-expressing cells.

375
376

An analysis of matched D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 virions revealed no difference in

377

the ultrastructure of SARS-CoV-2 particles, the shape of spike trimers, or the amounts of

378

S and S2 in viral particles (Hou et al., 2020), while Zhang et al. (doi:

379

10.1101/2020.06.12.148726) concluded that the D614G mutation led to enhanced

380

retention of S1. Our data show that cells expressing matched D614 and G614 forms of

381

spike show no difference in the amounts of cell-associated S1 and S2, though there may

382

be a slightly lower amount of full-length S. This may reflect a slight increase in the

383

cleavage of G614 spike at the S1/S2 boundary, and since lysosomal proteases can

384

catalyze this event it may be a consequence of enhanced lysosomal sorting of D614G

385

spike proteins. Alternatively, enhanced spike cleavage by Golgi proteases such as furin

386

may potentiate the lysosomal sorting of spike.

387
388

The most obvious effect of the D614G mutation is the ~4-8-fold increase in a proxy marker

389

of SARS-CoV-2 infection (an encoded luciferase) at 8 hours post-infection (Hou et al.,

390

2020), suggestive of accelerated viral entry. Although it is at least formally possible that

391

these various effect of the D614G mutation are unrelated, the more parsimonious

392

hypothesis is that they are all reflections of a common mechanism. As for what this

393

mechanism might be, there is already extensive precedent from the field of lysosomal

394

protein sorting.

395

mediates the lysosomal delivery of both newly-synthesized intracellular cargoes and

396

endocytosed cargoes retrieved from the extracellular milieu (Braulke and Bonifacino,

397

2009). Although there is a report of M6P modification on spike glycans (Brun et al. 2020

398

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.384594v1.full.pdf),

399

suggest that the effects of the D614G mutation are necessarily mediated by M6P

400

receptors. Rather, we posit the more general hypothesis that spike protein interactions

401

with one or more cell surface proteins accelerate SARS-CoV-2 entry and that the same

402

or similar interactions facilitate the lysosomal trafficking of newly-synthesized spike

403

proteins, perhaps by interactions with newly-synthesized versions of the same spike-

404

binding proteins in the ER, ERGIC, or Golgi. In light of this hypothesis, it is interesting to

405

note that SARS-CoV-2 infection is exquisitely sensitive to a known inhibitor of plasma

406

membrane-to-lysosome traffic (Kang et al., 2020) and that SARS-CoV-2 infection requires

407

numerous proteins involved in lysosome biology (Daniloski et al., 2020).

Cell lines, cell culture, transfections

411

HEK293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in complete medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal

412

bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (10,000 units/ml)). Transfections

413

were carried out using lipofectamine according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Htet1

414

cells were generated by transfecting HEK293 cells with the plasmid pS147, which

415

encodes the tetracycline-activated transcription factor rtTAv16 (Zhou et al., 2006),

416

followed by selection of zeocin-resistant transgenic cell clones (200 ug/ml zeocin), and

417

pooling of these clones. SARS-CoV-2 protein-expressing cell lines were generated by

418

transfection of Htet1 cells with Sleeping Beauty transposons carrying a tet-regulated

419

transgene designed to express each SARS-CoV-2 protein under control of the

420

doxycycline-regulated TRE3G promoter. One to two days after transfection, cells were

421

placed in selective media containing 1 ug/ml puromycin and 200 ug/ml zeocin. Multiple

422

clones were obtained from each transfection, pooled, and expanded to create master

423

banks of each test line. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 protein was induced by adding

424

doxycycline to the culture medium at a final concentration of 1 ug/ml.

between the ITRs contains (a) one gene in which a crippled EF1alpha promoter drives

expression of a polycistronic ORF encoding mCherry, the p2a peptide, and the

435

expression of codon-optimized forms of the N, S**, or M proteins (pCG217, pCG218, and

436

pCG221, respectively, which were used to create the Htet1/N, Htet1/S**, and Htet1/M cell

437

lines). Two additional transposon-mobilizing plasmids were also used in this study. These

438

plasmids carry (a) one gene in which a crippled EF1alpha promoter drives expression of

439

the puromycin-resistance protein, and (b) a second gene in which the TRE3G promoter

440

drives expression of codon-optimized forms of the SW1 or SD614G proteins (pCG145 and

441

pCG200, respectively, used to create the Htet1/ SW1 and Htet1/ SD614G cell lines). All

with the exception of 6 amino acid changes (986KV987 to 986PP987 and 682RRAR685
