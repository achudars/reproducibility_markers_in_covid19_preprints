Abstract
1

SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged, highly contagious virus and the cause of the current

2

pandemic. It is a zoonotic virus, although its animal origin is not clear yet. Person-to-person

3

transmission occurs by inhalation of infected droplets and aerosols, or by direct contact with

4

contaminated fomites. Arthropods transmit numerous viral, parasitic, and bacterial diseases;

5

however, the potential role of arthropods in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not fully understood.

6

Thus far, a few studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not supported in cells

7

from certain insect species nor in certain species of mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation. In

8

this study, we expanded the work of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to biting insects after ingesting

9

a SARS-CoV-2infected blood meal. Species tested included Culicoides sonorensis biting

10

midges, as well as Culex tarsalis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, all known biological

11

vectors for numerous RNA viruses. Arthropods were allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2 spiked

12

blood and at various time points post infection analyzed for the presence of viral RNA and

13

infectious virus. Additionally, cell lines derived from C. sonorensis (W8a), Ae. aegypti (C6/36),

14

Cx. quinquefasciatus (HSU), and Cx. tarsalis (CxTrR2) were tested for SARS-CoV-2

15

susceptibility. Our results indicate that none of the biting insects, nor the insect cell lines support

16

SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conclude, that biting insect do not pose a risk for transmission of

17

SARS-CoV-2 to humans or animals following a SARS-CoV-2 infected blood meal.

Introduction
22

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the

23

2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the order

24

Nidovirales, family coronaviridae, and genus betacoronavirus. It is an enveloped virus with a

25

positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30 kb in length (Chen et al.

26

2020). SARS-CoV-2 infects humans, and has the potential to infect various animal species (Chu

27

et al. 2020). Transmission from these animals to humans is not yet clearly understood. The virus

28

is mainly transmitted from person-to-person by inhalation of droplets and aerosols produced by

29

infected people (Chan et al. 2020), or through contact with contaminated surfaces (Goldman

30

2020, Sonja A. Rasmussen 2020; Kwon et al., 2020). Arthropods transmit numerous diseases to

31

humans and animals via biological and mechanical transmission (Leitner et al. 2015). Although

32

the SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are not transmitted by

33

insects, concerns have been raised, by those in both public health and agricultural sectors, as to

34

their potential role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 among humans and animals. For arthropods to be

35

transmission-competent vectors, the respective pathogen must be acquired from a host during

36

blood feeding, then infect the midgut, escape the midgut barrier, disseminate to and infect the

37

salivary glands, and finally be transmitted to a susceptible host during subsequent blood feeding

38

(Franz et al. 2015). A recent report demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication was not

39

supported in Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito species after an

40

intrathoracic route of infection (Huang et al. 2020). Another report showed that the SARS-CoV-

41

2 does not replicate in cells derived from Aedes mosquitoes, nor was it present in field-caught

42

Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes from Wuhan (Xia et al. 2020).

43

Here, we report the first susceptibility study of SARS-CoV-2 infection using three critical insect

44

vectors following ingestion of a SARS-CoV-2 infected blood meal, including an agriculturally

45

important animal disease vector, Culicoides sonorensis biting midges, and two significant human

46

disease vector mosquito species, Cx. tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Additionally, four insect-

47

derived cell lines from C. sonorensis (W8a), Ae. aegypti (C6/36), Cx. tarsalis (CxTrR2), and Cx.

48

quinquefasciatus (HSU) were also evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.
Methods

49

The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain was acquired from Biodefense and Emerging

50

Infection Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA) and was

51

passaged three times on VeroE6 cells (ATCC, VA, USA) with a final titer of 2.5 x 106

52

TCID50/ml. Arthropod cell cultures were derived from C. sonorensis embryos (W8a; McHolland

53

and Mecham 2003), Cx. tarsalis embryos (CxTrR2; Arthropod-Borne Animal Diseases Unit;

54

ABADRU, Manhattan, KS, USA), Cx. quinquefasciatus ovaries (HSU; Hsu et al. 1970), and Ae.

55

albopictus larva (C6/36). The W8a, CxTrR2, HSU, and C6/36 cells were maintained in CuVa

56

medium, L-15 medium (with 10% tryptose phosphate broth) and Medium 199H, respectively.

57

All media (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was supplemented with 10-20% FBS (ITFBS;

58

Sigma). Cells were maintained at 27oC in closed T-flasks and inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at

59

approximately 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 1h before the inoculum was replaced with

60

fresh culture media. Cell cultures were monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) by light

61

microscopy and culture supernatants were collected at 0, 2, 4, and 8 days post infection (dpi) for

62

subsequent titration by TCID50-CPE assay on VeroE6 cells.

63

Cx. tarsalis, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and the ABADRU C. sonorensis colonies were reared and

64

maintained in the ABADRU insectary. Arthropods were transported to Kansas State University,

(ACL-3) conditions.

67

Adult female C. sonorensis (n=200) midges were allowed to feed on defibrinated sheep blood

68

mixed 1:1 (v/v) with SARS-CoV-2 (2.0 x 106 TCID50/ml). Negative control unfed midges

69

(n=100) were maintained in adjacent cages. For mosquitoes, 8-day old Cx. tarsalis (n=100) or

70

10-day old Cx. quinquefasciatus (n=100) were allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2 spiked sheep

71

blood as described above. Negative control mock-infected blood-fed Cx. tarsalis (n=50) were

72

maintained in adjacent cages. After an hour of feeding, midges or fully engorged mosquitoes

73

were held at 28oC for 10 days. Surviving midges and mosquitoes at day 10 were pooled (n=5-10)

74

in 1 ml virus transport media (199E media supplemented with antibiotic-antimycotics; Sigma),

75

and stored at -80oC until processed for virus isolation (VI) and RNA extractions.

76

Pooled arthropods were homogenized by a Tissuelyser II (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA)

77

using tungsten carbide beads (Qiagen). An aliquot (140 μl) of homogenate was used for RNA

78

extraction with the remaining homogenate filtered through a 0.22 μm PES membrane filter

79

(MIDSCI, St. Louis, MO, USA) before subsequent VI.

80

RNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) as per

81

manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR assay was performed according to the Center for Disease

control (NTC). Results were analyzed using the Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.1 with samples below

88

40 Ct considered positive.

89

Arthropod homogenates (100 μl) were added on to VeroE6 cells in 24 well plates and incubated

90

at 37oC and 5% CO2 for 3 days. Culture supernatents were blind-passaged three times on VeroE6

91

cells, and at the first and third passage, cells were examined by an indirect immunofluorescence

92

assay (IFA) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Briefly, 3 dpi cells were fixed with ice

93

cold 100% methanol for 10 mins at -80oC and washed three times with 1 x PBS Tween 20

94

(0.05%). Mouse monoclonal antibodies (in house) specific for the Receptor Binding Domain

95

(RBD) of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was diluted 1:5 in 1x PBS containing 1% BSA and 150

96

μl was added to each well and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. The cells were

97

washed three times as described above, and then incubated with 150 μl of FITC-conjugated goat

98

anti-mouse IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), diluted 1:500 in 1x PBS with BSA, for 1 h at

99

RT. After washing and drying, cell monolayers were examined by an EVOS fluorescent

100

microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for the presence of FITC positive

101

cells. Mock infected and SARS-CoV-2 infected VeroE6 cells were used as negative and positive

102

controls, respectively.
Results and discussion

103

The goal of this study was to determine whether arthropods are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by a

104

natural route of infection which has not yet been evaluated. In addition to important mosquito

105

vectors, Culicoides midges were also evaluated in this study. Initial infection studies were

106

performed in vitro with the insect cell lines W8a, C6/36, CxTrR2, and HSU. Two independent

107

experiments showed no obvious sign of CPE for any of the SARS-CoV-2-infected arthropod-

108

derived cell cultures, nor for any of the insect culture supernatants collected at 2, 4 or 8 dpi and

109

passaged on VeroE6 cells.

110

Next, susceptibility of insects after an infectious blood meal was investigated. Of 200 midges

111

allowed to feed on the SARS-CoV-2-spiked blood meal, 140 survived until 10 days post blood

112

meal and were further analyzed. The majority (85%) of virus-fed midge pools had detectable

113

SARS-CoV- 2-specific RNA with an average Ct value of 34.84±2.6; the day 10 control unfed

114

midges were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Table 1). Among the Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes

115

allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2-spiked blood (n=100), only 48 virus-fed mosquitoes survived

116

until day 10. One out of 6 (17%) virus-fed Cx. tarsalis mosquitoes had detectable SARS-CoV-2-

117

specific RNA with an average Ct value of 31.3, and none of the 30 mock-infected blood-fed Cx.

118

tarsalis mosquitoes were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive (Table 1). Similarly, of 100 Cx.

119

quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, 47 virus-fed survived until day 10. Viral RNA was detected in

120

50% of the SARS-CoV-2-fed mosquitoes with an average Ct value of 34.17 (Table 1).

121

To determine the presence of infectious virus, serial passages of pooled arthropod homogenates

122

were performed on VeroE6 cells. No CPE was observed after three passages of virus-fed

123

Culicoides midge homogenates, and IFA analysis of passage one and three of inoculated VeroE6

124

cells confirmed the absence of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2; Figure 1). SARS-CoV-2-infected VeroE6

125

cells were used as an IFA positive control and showed a clear positive staining pattern (Fig.1).

126

Unfed control midge samples were negative by VI and IFA (Table 2). Similarly, no infectious

127

virus was detected from any of the six homogenate pools of SARS-CoV-2-fed Cx. tarsalis

128

mosquitoes that were passaged on VeroE6 cells and analyzed for CPE and by IFA; the control

129

Cx. tarsalis homogenate pools were also negative by both methods (Table 2). The six virus-fed

130

Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquito homogenates tested for infectivity by VI and IFA were also

131

negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2).

132

A key factor crucial for arthropod-mediated transmission is that the infected host, either person

133

or animal, is viremic at the time of feeding. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2 is known to cause viremia in

134

some cases of infected people (Young et al. 2020). Susceptible animal models tested so far

135

appear to be aviremic (Shi et al. 2020) except for hamsters which regularly show viremia (Chan

136

et al. 2019). Therefore, controlled studies to rule out arthropod transmission of this RNA virus

137

are critical for determining risk, as well as developing accurate epidemiological modeling and

138

control strategies.

139

Overall, our results agree with previously published findings that Aedes mosquito derived cells

140

do not support SARS-CoV-2 replication (Xia et al. 2020). Additionally, we have shown that two

141

different Culex species derived cell lines and one Culicoides midge derived cell line are also

142

refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previously published SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility

143

study in mosquitoes, intrathoracic injection of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero76 was used to

144

determine the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti, Ae. Albopictus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus to the virus

145

(Huang et al. 2020); however, intrathoracic inoculation bypasses the natural route of infection

146

via the ingestion of a virus-infected blood meal (Franz et al. 2015). Therefore, in the present

147

study, testing of arthropods for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility was performed following the

148

ingestion of a virus-spiked blood meal; this is important not only because it is the most relevant

149

route of infection for arthropod vectors, but also because of the quasi-species nature of an RNA

150

virus inoculum such as for SARS-CoV-2 (Jary et al. 2020). Considerable genetic bottle necks

151

and natural selection processes exist for viruses in arthropod replication and arthropod-borne

152

transmission. Depending on the insect vector, the number of virus particles ingested via a blood

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.29.317289; this version posted September 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

153

meal depends on the level of viremia in the host and the volume of the meal. When virus

154

particles ingested via the blood meal enter the midgut, few will be able to infect the midgut

155

epithelium. After midgut replication, progeny viruses escape the midgut barrier and disseminate

156

in the insect’s hemocoel, and then next they infect and replicate in the salivary gland. This is

157

critical for subsequent virus transmission to a susceptible host during a blood meal. The quasi-

158

species nature of RNA viruses combined with the natural selection for defined viral genotypes

159

enables RNA viruses to infect and replicate in arthropods and results in a defined virus

160

population selected for increased fitness for the arthropod environment. These viral genotypic

161

changes could lead to viral biotypes with a higher ability of salivary gland infection and bite

162

transmission, when compared to a virus which is artificially injected into the insect’s hemocoel.

163

Our in vitro and in vivo studies of midge and mosquito susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection

164

following a natural ingestion route of exposure showed that viral RNA remained in virus-fed

165

arthropods for up to 10 days post virus-spiked blood feeding. However, no infectious virus was

166

recovered from these RNA-positive arthropods, even after three passages on highly susceptible

167

VeroE6 cells. Our in vitro studies using various insect cells support these results since no

168

infectious virus was detected in supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated insect cell cultures. In

169

conclusion, the insect vector species known to transmit animal and human pathogens used in this

170

study are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection under experimental conditions and, therefore,

171

most likely do not play a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
