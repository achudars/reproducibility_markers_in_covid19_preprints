Abstract
Background: Coronavirus (COVID-19) was introduced into society in late 2019
and has now reached over 26 million cases and 850,000 deaths. The Middle
East has a death toll of ~50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over
350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the
neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can
be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common
genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further
spread of COVID-19.
Methods: The approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple
sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to
identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122
samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).
Findings: We identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream
gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13
start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene
variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG,
2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and
phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced
COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East.
Interpretation: The phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into
mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due
to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and
unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more
unique genomes. This study provides more in depth analysis of the variants
affecting in the region than any other study.

Introduction
On January 9h 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control reported that 15 of 59
suspected cases of pneumonia were due to a novel human coronavirus (CoV), now
known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1. The genome
for this novel virus was then made publicly available on the Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) the next day. SARS-CoV-2 is an easily
spreadable virus which would evolve into a global pandemic of at least 26 million
cases and 850,000 deaths2. One of the first countries to experience a significant
outbreak was Iran. The country reported its first confirmed case on 19 th February
2020 from a merchant in Qom who travelled from China 3.. Many of the first countries
with infections in the Middle East were linked to travellers from Iran including
Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Oman and UAE. COVID-19 continued to spread to
the remaining Middle Eastern countries with a death toll of over 50,000 people
according to health authorities. This number is expected to be an underestimation due
to countries effected by war including Libya, Syria and Yemen. Needless to say, there
have been devastating effects to the region and the real effects are expected to be
unreported4.
Researchers are racing to develop a vaccine that can provide viral immunity and
avoid additional deaths. SAR-CoV-2 is transmitted using the spike protein which
binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor; the virus is easily
transmittable due to mutations in the receptor-binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domain of
the strain5. Transmission could be made even easier if more mutations accumulate.
Although mutations are rare, they can create new strains and it is not guaranteed that
the current leading vaccine trials will be effective as SARS-CoV-2 continues to
mutate6. By categorizing variants, we can identify any new strains and how the
mutations are likely to affect spread. As the Middle East is often under reported, it is
important to characterise the variants of strains that are commonly present. Analysis
of the common variants in the Middle East is essential to develop a vaccine that treats
the strains in the region. This analysis helps understand the viral genome landscape
and identify clades of the region.
2. Objectives:
•

Our hypothesis is that variants found in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Middle
Eastern samples will indicate delivery from Iran. We will use bioinformatics
tools and publicly available samples to explore the composition of strains
within each country. We expect that many strains will show evidence of
Iranian origin.

•

The aim is to explore the structure of Middle Eastern genome strains using
multiple sequence alignment, tree generation and variant prediction (and
others). If we explore the structure and common variants of SARS-CoV-2
strains in these populations, we expect to learn more about how the virus
spread.

3. Methods:
Sample Source: We obtained the publicly available data from the Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)7.
Sample Size: 122 Middle Eastern samples, Wuhan reference sequence NC_045512
and 5 recent Wuhan samples.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.09.332692; this version posted October 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Sample Selection: Samples were selected from the Middle East by using filtering
available on the GISAID website. Only complete genome samples were used. The
countries considered were Afghanistan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel,
Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Turkey,
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen. Iran had only 7 samples available after
filtering for low coverage. Cyprus, Kuwait, Lebanon all had 8 samples available after
filtering. No samples were available on the database from Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya,
Sudan, Syria or Yemen. 10 samples were taken from all other countries. Samples were
also filtered to high quality when possible. 10 samples was selected as the optimum
number to cover all possible countries and remain within alignment file limit of size 4
Mb (maximum size for Clustal Omega tool). In countries with 10 samples, to prevent
sample sourcing from same outbreak, the 5 earliest and 5 most recent samples were
taken. All samples were downloaded from GISAID and then concatenated into a
single multi-sample file and saved in FASTA format.
Multiple sequence alignment: Using the collected samples, multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) was performed using Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
msa/clustalo/)8. The Clustal Omega online tool was used to perform the alignment
(found at: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). The online tools allows up to
4000 sequences or a maximum file size of 4 MB, therefore the maximum number of
samples was used. The concatenated file of samples was uploaded to the online tool.
For step 2, the output parameters selected were PEARSON/FASTA. All other options
were kept at the default option. The output file generated is an alignment file; the file
consists of all sequences with gaps denoted by ‘-’. The output file format is also a
FASTA file.
Variant identification: Variant calling was performed using the alignment FASTA file
and the SNP extraction tool snp-sites9 (https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp-sites).
These tools identify the SNP sites by taking a multi-sample FASTA file as input. The
program then restructures the data as a variant call format (VCF) file. The VCF file
provides a clear mapping of SNPs from the aligned sequences – this allows us to
easily identify the SNP location and the genotype for each sample at a given locus. In
the outputted VCF file, the rows correspond with each unique variant and the column
provides the genotype at the given site.
Variant annotation: We used SNP-eff10 to perform the variant annotation information
such as the variant definition and the overlapping gene (found at:
(https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/SnpEff.html). SnpEff also predicts the effect of the
variants. SNPeff is integrated into the Galaxy web-based tool for bioinformatics
analysis (found at: usegalaxy.org) 11. We utilised the Galaxy platform and uploaded
our VCF file to Galaxy using their online upload tool. To annotate variants, you must
first build a database from the reference genome. This is performed using the “SnpEff
build” tool on Galaxy. To create the SnpEff database, we downloaded data from
NCBI for Wuhan reference NC_045512.2 and uploaded to Galaxy. To build the
database, we directed to NCBI and searched for NC_045512. We then downloaded
the corresponding GFF file, which contains the annotations, and the FASTA file,
which contains the entire genome. We then selected the build database option. Once
the database was built, we selected the “SnpEff eff” tool to annotate variants. Galaxy
populates the fields for VCF with the uploaded file from the previous step. The output

format is selected as VCF and CSV report was also selected for additional useful
information for downstream analysis. For Genome source parameter, the option
“Custom” was selected to use the newly created database. Other default parameters
were used including 5000 bases for Upstream / Downstream length and 2 bases as set
size for splice sites (donors and acceptor) in bases. All filter output and additional
annotation options were deselected and analysis was ran. Once the analysis was
executed, the annotation data is outputted as an annotated VCF and a HTML report
file.
Data visualisation: Once the annotated VCF was generated, the VCF was imported to
R for extraction of the variant annotation information. The annotated data was
imported, manipulated and plotted using R v3.6.212. The dplyr v0.8.4 package was
used to summarise and align the data13. The ggplot2 package was used to align the
identified variants and visualise the types of mutations that re-occur 14. The x-axis in
the plots indicates the variant position along the SARS-CoV-2 genome; the left y-axis
indicates the sample name and the right y-axis represents the country of origin for
each sample. This plot is used to compare the genome in different populations. The
data was then ordered by date of first reported case, meaning that Wuhan is followed
by United Arab Emirates and the final country is Cyprus.
Phylogenetic analysis: Phylogenetic analysis was performed using BEAST (Bayesian
Evolutionary Analysis Sample Trees) v1.10.4, to perform Bayesian analysis of
molecular sequences using Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) 15. The analysis
followed the approach recommended to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of an
epidemic. The aim of this is to obtain an estimate of the origin of the epidemic in the
region and understand how it spread through the Middle East. To undertake the
analysis, we opened BEAUTi, the graphical application used to analyse the control
file. Although it requests a NEXUS file, the FASTA file can also be used. The data
was uploaded using the Import Data option and appeared under the Partitions section.
BEAUTi confirmed that 30851 sites are present in the uploaded data. The default
options are selected for site model and clock model. Next, we specified the individual
virus dates by selecting the “Tips” panel and selecting the “Use tip dates” option. A
tab delimited file was uploaded which specified the upload date. This information
was extracted from the names as they were downloaded from GISAID. Next, we set
the substitution model by selecting the “Sites” tab and selected the default options of
HKY model, the default Estimated base frequencies and select Gamma as Site
Heterogeneity Model. Next, the molecular clock was selected under the “Clock” tab
as a strict clock since we know that the frequency of mutation is low. The tree options
are elected under the “Tree Prior” tab as “Random starting tree” for the tree model
and “Coalescent: Exponential Growth”, a model that assumes a finite but constant
population size and predicts that all alleles will be removed from the population
individually. This provides additional predictions on the reproductive rate. In the
“Priors” tab, select the scale as 100 for prior distribution which models the expected
growth for a pandemic. The operators require no changes from the default. The
MCMC option for chain length is set as 100,000 and sampling frequency to 100.
Tree visualisation: Finally, we summarised the tree using the TreeAnnotator tool, an
additional package as part of BEAST. We first select the file generated using BEAST
and outputted the tree file. Then the output NEXUS file was imported to FigTree
program to display. Once we opened FigTree to display, we re-ordered the order by

increasing value and then switched on Branch Labels. We switched on Node Bars and
selected the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) credible intervals for the node
heights. We plotted a time scale by turning on the Scale Axis and then setting the
Time Scale section for Offset as 2020.7, the latest date of collection for our samples.

4. Results
Sequence alignment and variant calling were completed successfully. Once these were complete,
variation annotation was performed. We identified 2200 distinct genome variants which are recorded
in Table 1. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC,
14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. The frequency of each unique variant type can be found in Table

These results were then used to generate the dotplot of variant alignment (Figure 1). The dotplot
successfully indicated a pattern in variants that could not be easily identified from the alignment or
annotation files. The alignment includes samples in facets based on their country. The alignment
shows a pattern in variants that occur between each country. For example, this is prominent in
Qatar, Jordan and Oman where the pattern makes the country distinctive from the variants plotted
for other countries. In addition, the phylogenetic tree generated branching indicative of an Iranian
origin (Figure 2)

above plot are grouped by country of origin. The left x-axis denotes the accession
ID and the right x-axis denotes the country of origin. The y-axis is the position
along the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The order of countries is based on date of first
reported of COVID-19. All variants are in relation to Wuhan reference sequence
NC_045512.2. The Wuhan samples are in the top facet and show low mutation
frequency in comparison to the reference. The following samples show a greater
accumulation of mutations. One Iranian sample has many more variants than
orders. The Saudi Arabia also appears to have a low mutation rate which may be
due to their early contraction of the virus. Oman samples also indicate evidence of
a distinctive strain. Many cases feature a missense variant at 3037, 14408 and
24351 base pairs.

5. Discussion
The aim of this study was to identify whether COVID-19 was introduced to the
Middle East from Iran and also to explore the genomic composition in the region.
Our study performs sequence alignment to compare all sequences against the
reference genome. Once this is complete, the annotated variants were extracted to
generate a plot mapping variants, grouping samples by country. The plot as seen in
Figure 1, shows clear distinctive patterns within countries that are not obvious from
the generated alignment and annotation files. The variants found in different regions,
ordered by their first reported case, are from United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt,
Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey
and Cyprus. The variants at position 241, 3037, 24351, 11083 appear in many Middle
Eastern countries but do not occur in Wuhan samples. This variant characterisation
may be useful in the fight against COVID-19 and the development of treatments.
Identifying unique variants to a region may explain why treatment is working for
some and not others, should the mutations have an effect on the delivery or the
severity of the virus.
The Iranian samples appear more diverse and interestingly do not share the mutation
at 14408 which is evident in most samples. Iranian sample EPI_ISL_507007 appears
to have a high frequency of variants that is not seen in others. THE GISAID detection
system indicates no faults were found with sample EPI_ISL_507007 and report a full
sequence match so it was not removed. It is noteworthy that the Iran samples appear
to have a lower average SNP frequency than other countries. This may indicate that
the virus transmitted to Iran earlier than other countries, as we expected. Israel,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey all share similar variant
mapping. Qatar shows an usual mapping with a high frequency of frameshift variants.
This may indicate a diverse, new strain is circulating in the country. Cyprus has little
diversity in the variant mapping which is surprising given its late date for first
reported cases. Another interesting point is that time-varied samples were taken for
countries with 10 samples. We see not indication that there are distinct groups within
countries. This further indicates the the mutation frequency is low. It also indicates
that there is more variation in the genomic composition in samples from different
countries than differences found in samples from different collection times. Smaller
populations can cause greater accumulation of variants through genetic drift. This
may occur given local lockdowns and travel restrictions that have been enforced
worldwide. It is possible that these genomic strains with new mutations may create a
situation where the countries develop a deathly strain that is not prominent in other
parts of the world. This could result in a situation where a country is
disproportionately affected by accumulating deaths or an inefficient vaccine.
Phylogenetic trees help in understanding the evolutionary relationships between
groups. In the present context, we use them to identify the earliest strains and to track
the spread of COVID-19 across the Middle East. The tree shows that UAE samples
are distinguished and form one clade. This correlates with their early intervention and
lockdown and subsequently appears to have resulted in a unique genome.
Samples from Qatar also form the majority of 1 clade, with many of the Wuhan
samples, indicating that they are similar to the Wuhan samples and show little
distinction. Egypt also becomes a distinct branch earlier than most samples. These
examples are indicative of the global response – the lockdown of each country and
prevention of spreading has resulted in SARS-CoV-2 strains of great similarity within

each country. If lockdowns were not enforced, it is likely that these clades would be
less distinguisable as mutations are spread between countries. As we expected, 2 of the
highest branches points attach to Iranian samples, further implementing Iran in the
initial spread across the Middle East. The phylogenetic tree therefore indicates what
we suggest in our hypothesis – most samples originate from the Iranian sample. This is
not surprising given the vast number of cases and early crisis state of the country.
However, it is useful to see that the variant analysis shows what we suspect at the
genome level. A related study also came to this conclusion by using contact tracing
from cases related to religious events in the city of Qom, Iran16.
