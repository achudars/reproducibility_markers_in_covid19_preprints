ABSTRACT

22

Phage Phi6 is an enveloped virus considered as a possible non-pathogenic surrogate for SARS-

23

CoV-2 and other viral pathogens in transmission studies. Higher input amounts of bacteriophage

24

Phi6 are shown to delay and protect the phage from environmental decay, both when the phage are

25

dried in plastic tubes, and when they are stored in saline solution at 4°C. When bacteriophage Phi6

26

are placed in LB (Luria-Bertani) growth medium prior to placement on the plastic surface, viral

27

recovery is not influenced by the starting concentration. The protection is reflected in longer half-

28

lives of the phage at higher concentrations compared to lower. Because experiments supporting the

29

possibility of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses rely upon survival of

30

infectious virus following inoculation of various surfaces, high initial amounts of input virus on a

31

surface may generate artificially inflated survival times compared to realistic lower levels of virus

32

that a subject would normally encounter. This is not only because there are extra half-lives to go

33

through at the higher concentrations, but also because the half-lives themselves are extended at the

34

higher virus concentrations. It is important to design surface drying experiments for pathogens with

35

realistic levels of input virus, and to consider the role of the carrier and matrix if the results are to be

36

clinically relevant.

IMPORTANCE

39

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of attention has been paid to the environmental decay of

40

SARS-CoV-2 due to proposed transmission of the virus via fomites. However, published

41

experiments have commenced with very high virus titer inoculums, an experimental design not

42

representative of real-life conditions. The study described here evaluated the impact of initial virus

43

titer on environmental decay of an enveloped virus, using a non-pathogenic surrogate for SARS-

44

CoV-2, enveloped bacteriophage Phi6. We establish that higher concentrations of virus can protect

45

the virus from environmental decay, depending on conditions. This has important implications for

46

stability studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Our results point to a limitation in the

47

fundamental methodology that has been used to attribute fomite transmission for almost all

48

respiratory viruses.

INTRODUCTION

50

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an intense focus on fomites (i.e., inanimate objects and

51

surfaces), as possible conduits for transmission of the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2. This was

52

because of a widely repeated contention that a person touching a freshly contaminated surface, not

53

washing hands, then quickly touching their mouth, nose or eyes, would lead to self-inoculation of

54

this respiratory virus. Consequently, considerable effort has been made to determine how long the

55

virus remains infectious after being deposited on various surfaces, and what conditions favor or

56

disfavor viability of the virus on these surfaces (Aboubakr et al, 2020; Biryukov et al., 2020; Bonil

57

et al., 2021; Chan et al, 2020; Chin et al, 2020; Kasloff et al., 2021; Kwon et al., 2021; Pastorino et

58

al., 2020; Paton et al., 2021; Riddell et al, 2020; van Doremalen et al, 2020).

59
60

In parallel to these studies, workers tested for the presence of viral RNA on surfaces in hospitals

61

treating COVID-19 patients (Chia et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020; Piana et al., 2021;

62

Santarpia et al., 2020). These RT-PCR tests found viral RNA to be present on many surfaces (but

63

did not test for infectious virus, with one exception), and reinforced the perception that fomites

64

were indeed a significant risk factor for transmission of the disease.

65
66

In July 2020, one of us published (online) a Comment arguing that the risk of transmission of

67

SARS-CoV-2 by fomites was exaggerated (Goldman, 2020). New information that appeared since

68

then has strengthened this conclusion (Goldman, 2021). The basis for the argument was that the

69

amounts of virus used in experiments for determining how long infectious virus remains viable on

70

surfaces were orders of magnitude too large compared to what someone would actually encounter

71

in a real-world situation. Since the virus decays with a defined half-life depending on the surface,

4

72

the larger the inoculum, the more half-lives have to be gone through before there is less than one

73

infectious virus particle remaining on the surface. Smaller, more realistic inoculums would survive

74

through fewer half-lives, and therefore much less time would pass before the surface would be free

75

of infectious virus.

76
77

Among conditions favoring virus survival on surfaces was the observation that Bovine Serum

78

Albumin (BSA) protected the virus from environmental decay, and extended the time that the virus

79

remained viable (Pastorino et al., 2020). Similar observations with Bovine Serum Albumin were

80

also noted in experiments assessing viability of bacteriophage MS2, and enveloped bacteriophage

81

Phi6 in droplets (Lin et al., 2020). Bacteriophage Phi6 has been considered as a potential non-

82

pathogenic surrogate for enveloped viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus (Fedorenko

83

et al., 2020; Whitworth et al., 2020).

84
85

The fact that Bovine Serum Albumin protected at least three viruses (SARS-CoV-2, phage MS2

86

and phage Phi6) from environmental decay made us wonder if higher concentrations of a virus

87

itself might similarly protect the virus from decay. Indeed, Marr and coworkers suggested the value

88

of "investigating the role of viral titer, which might affect aggregation and other characteristics, on

89

virus survival" (Lin et al., 2020).

90
91

There was already a suggestion that this might be the case for SARS-CoV-1. Table 1 in Lai et al

92

(2005) indicated that survival of SARS on paper, cotton gowns, and disposable gowns was much

93

greater for a 106 inoculum compared to 104. At a 104 inoculum, infectious virus was not detectable

94

after 5 minutes, but with a 106 inoculum, infectious virus remained detectable for 24 hours. This

95

result suggested that the virus half-life was greatly extended with higher amounts of input virus.

96
97

In the work reported here, we have investigated the role of initial virus concentration on

98

environmental decay of phage Phi6. We assayed survival of virus samples dried in plastic tubes for

99

various lengths of time after drying. We show that higher input virus concentrations do indeed

100

exhibit significantly larger percent survival and longer half-lives compared to lower virus input,

101

however this effect is influenced by the inoculating matrix. The protective effect of higher virus

102

concentrations also was observed for virus samples kept in solution at 4°C. This protective effect

103

was not found for virus placed in Luria-Bertani (LB) growth medium (which contains Tryptone and

104

Yeast Extract) before being placed in plastic tubes for drying.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

107

Phage preparation

108

Bacteriophage Phi6, and a bacterial host strain that it grows in, Pseudomonas syringae var

109

phaseolicola HB10Y, were generous gifts of Lenny Mindich (now retired) of the Public Health

110

Research Institute of Rutgers University. Cells grown overnight in LB medium in tubes shaken at

111

25°C were used in plaque assays with serial dilutions of virus to obtain countable numbers of

112

plaques. Plaques assays were performed as described in Goldman (2015) except that the plates were

113

incubated at room temperature (approximately 20°C). Luria-Bertani (LB) medium contained 10 g/l

114

Tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l NaCl, and NaOH to adjust pH to 7.0

118

Phage stocks were obtained by harvesting the top agar (6.5 g/l in LB) from one or two petri dishes

119

(containing 10 g/l agar in LB) exhibiting confluent lysis of the bacterial lawn. Saline solution (9 g/l

120

NaCl), 1 ml per plate, was added to the top agar, which was transferred to centrifuge tubes and

121

centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 5 minutes to remove agar and debris. This supernatant, stored at 4°C,

122

comprised the initial phage stock.

123
124

Preparation of phage stock in saline solution

125

An Amicon Ultra 100K filter device from Millipore was pre-rinsed with 4 ml of distilled water,

126

followed by subsequent washes with 70% ethanol and sterile saline solution, using centrifugation at

127

4°C in a fixed angle rotor at 5000 x g. Up to 4 ml of Phi6 initial phage stock was loaded on this

128

filter unit and centrifuged such that 200 µl volume remained above the filter (typical spin time 15-

129

20 min). Fluid below the filter was discarded, the filter unit was refilled with 3.8 ml of sterile saline

130

solution and the same centrifugation steps were repeated 5 times. The sample (saline stock) was

131

recovered in 200-400 µl volume and virus titer was determined by plaque assay.

132
133

Phage survival following drying in polypropylene tubes

134

An aliquot from the saline stock was subjected to a sequential series of 10-fold dilutions in saline.

135

Five µl of the stock, and 5 µl of each of the 10-fold dilutions, were placed near the bottom of 1.5 ml

136

capacity conical polypropylene Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes (Corning). In our early

137

experiments, we allowed samples to air dry but switched to desiccation to save time. Samples were

138

desiccated under house vacuum (approximately 20 mm-Hg) and removed from the desiccator when

139

visually dry. Generally, this took between 15-20 minutes, with higher concentrations of phage

140

exhibiting shorter drying times, except for samples dried in LB medium where all samples took 19-

141

20 minutes to dry. We observed that there were no significant differences in patterns of phage

142

survival between air drying and desiccation. The data reported here were obtained from desiccated

143

samples.

144
145

Ambient room humidity was not controlled and varied in the building with a range between 10% to

146

45% over a period of six months, depending on the weather. However, for most of the experiments

147

reported here, humidity was around 15-25%. Humidity was monitored on a Holmes HHG-150

148

Comfort Check Hygrometer & Thermometer. Although humidity is known to significantly affect

149

environmental decay of Phi6 (Fedorenko et al, 2020; Lin et al, 2020; Whitworth et al, 2020), all

150

samples within a given experiment were subject to the same humidity, and our interest was only to

151

ascertain effects of initial viral concentration. Also, experiments measuring virus survival in real

152

world conditions, as has been done for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Mondelli et al, 2020; Ben-Shmuel et al,

153

2020), do not control for humidity, which is variable. Ambient room temperature was also not

154

controlled, but generally was maintained around 20°C.

155
156

Dried samples were reconstituted with 100 µl saline added to the Eppendorf tubes and vortexed.

157

The titer of viable virus remaining in each tube was then determined by plaque assay. Half-life for

158

the virus in a particular sample was calculated using the tool at:

160
161

All experiments were repeated 1 – 3 times; representative experiments are shown in the tables.

162

Because of variations in conditions from experiment to experiment (such as humidity and initial

163

titer of phage stock), we did not pool results to obtain averages. However, the relative percent

164

survival in each experiment was generally consistent for the same time points, and the patterns were

165

reproducible within experimental limits.

166
167

For experiments with LB medium, the initial phage stock was subjected to a sequential series of 10-

168

fold dilutions in LB medium. The remainder of the protocol was the same as above.

170

Phage survival in solution

171

The serial dilutions used for the dry time experiments were stored at 4°C in the dark for later

172

testing. After the number of days as shown in the tables, the titer of the phage in each dilution was

173

determined by plaque assay, and compared to the initial titers as measured on day 1.

174
175

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

176

Survival of Phi6 dried on plastic is increased at higher phage concentrations

177

Table 1 shows survival of Phi6 dried in plastic tubes and left for various lengths of times as a

178

function of initial virus concentration. The simple act of drying the phage led to loss of nearly all

179

viable phage at the lower phage input concentrations (lines 3 and 4), while having no significant

180

effect (93% recovery) on the highest phage concentration tested (line 1), and a small effect (70%

181

recovery) on a 10-fold lower initial phage concentration (line 2).

182
183

Similar patterns of protection by higher initial phage concentrations were also seen for all

184

subsequent lengths of time the phage remained dry in the tube. At 15 minutes dry time, we began to

185

see some loss of survival from the most concentrated initial virus input (line 5, 83% recovery)

186

compared to a 10-fold lower virus input (line 6, 27% recovery), As was seen for the samples dried

187

and assayed immediately, the lowest virus inputs led to loss of almost all viable phage (line7, 11%

188

recovery, line 8, none recovered).

189
190

After 30 or 60 minutes of dry-time, the highest initial phage inputs began to show significant

191

environmental decay, with just 43% recovery after 30 minutes (line 9), and 38% recovery at 60

192

minutes (line 13). But even more substantial environmental decay was observed for the lower input

193

virus samples (Lines 10-12 for 30-minute dry time, lines 14-16 for 60 minutes).

194
195

For those samples with measurable virus survival, we were able to calculate the half-lives of virus

196

in those samples (Table 1), which were commensurate to the percent survival observed. That is, at

197

the higher phage initial input levels, half-lives were much longer than the half-lives at lower initial

198

phage input, e.g., compare line 5 (57 minute half-life) to line 6 (8 minute half-life), or line 9 (24

199

minute half-life) to line 11 (6 minute half-life), or line 13 (42 minute half-life) to line 14 (13 minute

200

half-life).

201
202

The results in Table 1 show that the higher phage input concentrations delay and protect dried

203

phage from environmental decay compared to lower phage input concentrations. This effect is also

204

visualized in Figure 1A. The black circles show the relationship between the log PFU (plaque

205

forming units) inoculated onto the surface versus the level recovered. The dashed line represents the

206

best fit regression line. The solid line represents a relationship where all inoculated viruses would

207

be recovered (i.e., 100% recovery). It’s clear from the difference between the slopes of the two lines

208

that recovery is progressively lower as the inoculation level declines. In those experiments where

209

inoculated virus was not recovered, no recovery (0 PFU) is visualized in the figure at −1 log PFU.

211

Survival of Phi6 in saline at 4oC is increased at higher phage concentrations

212

We decided to test whether there was an effect of phage concentration on virus stability in solution,

213

as was seen for phage dried on surfaces. Table 2 shows little decay of phage in solution at 4°C at

214

the highest concentrations tested after 20 days (line 1), or about half decay after 56 days (line 4).

215

But as the input concentration is reduced, decay increases at both time points (lines 2 and 5), with

216

percent recovery in single digits for the lowest input phage samples (lines 3 and 6). These results

217

can also be visualized in Figure 1B. As in Figure 1A, the black circles show the relationship

218

between the log PFU inoculated onto the surface versus the level recovered. The dashed line

219

represents the best fit regression line, and the solid line represents a relationship where all

220

inoculated viruses would be recovered (i.e., 100% recovery). As in Figure 1A, it’s clear from the

221

difference between the slopes of the two lines that recovery is progressively lower as the

222

inoculation level declines. These experiments had no trials where inoculated virus was not

223

recovered.

224
225

Protection of Phi6 from decay by LB medium

226

In our earliest experiments, we used the "initial phage stock" (see Materials and Methods), which

227

did show protection from decay at the higher phage concentrations. But we realized that this stock

228

also had some level of LB medium present, derived from the soft top agar layer containing the

229

lysate in phage preparation. Therefore, dilutions of the initial phage stock also diluted part of the

230

medium the phage had been grown in, which is what prompted us to develop the filtration method

231

described in the Materials and Methods. This allowed the phage to be tested without residual

232

components of the growth medium, which could affect phage survival.

233

234

Nevertheless, we wondered whether growth medium itself might also protect the phage from decay,

235

similar to observations with BSA (Lin et al., 2020). Table 3 shows that this is indeed the case.

236

When phage samples were diluted in LB medium instead of saline, phage were essentially

237

completely protected from decay following a half hour dry time (lines 1-5). This is in marked

238

contrast to the results when phage were diluted in saline (Table 1). After extending the dry time for

239

LB-containing samples to 24 hours, environmental decay was now evident in the samples, with

240

recoveries of phage ranging between 16-39% (lines 6-10). There was no effect of varying the

241

amount of initial input phage, showing that LB medium delays and protects even lower

242

concentrations of phage from environmental decay. This is evident from Figure 1C, which shows

243

that as the level of log PFU inoculated declines, the log PFU declines proportionally, and the slope

244

of the regression line (dashed line) is essentially parallel to the line of 100% recovery (solid black

245

line). The regression lies slightly under the line of 100% recovery, which indicates that most, but

246

not all the virus inoculated was recovered with the same rate of environmental decay, but this varied

247

slightly from experiment to experiment. These experiments also had no trials where inoculated

248

virus was not recovered.

249
250

Our data demonstrate that bacteriophage Phi6, an enveloped virus that has been considered a

251

potential non-pathogenic surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 transmission studies, exhibits a slower loss of

252

infectivity from environmental decay by higher initial virus concentrations, depending upon the

253

carrier. This slower loss of infectivity is true both when the phage are dried on plastic surfaces, and

254

when the phage are left in saline solution in the refrigerator. The protection at higher phage

255

concentrations is reflected in longer half-lives compared to lower phage concentrations.

257

Phage survival on dried surfaces can be greatly affected by the type of surface, by temperature and

258

humidity, and by the medium containing the phage (Lin et al., 2020; Fedorenko et al., 2020;

259

Whitworth et al., 2020). Indeed, we observed dramatic delay and protection of phage by LB growth

260

medium, which superseded the effects of initial phage concentration. Thus, an important limitation

261

of our results is that we do not know what effect (if any) on phage survival would result from other

262

natural additions, such as mucous for example, which has been tested for SARS-CoV-2 (Matson et

263

al., 2020).

264
265

A recent study compared environmental stability of dried SARS-CoV-2 for two different initial

266

virus inocula (4 x 105 versus 4 x 103) on stainless steel, and did not observe additional protection in

267

the rate of decay at the higher concentration (Paton et al., 2021). The SARS-CoV-2 samples used in

268

this study were in growth medium including fetal bovine serum, which may be more comparable to

269

our results for Phi6 in LB medium. Also, their lower tested concentration (4 x 103) may still have

270

been too high to observe accelerated decay at lower virus concentrations.

271
272

Our results have implications for experiments measuring SARS CoV-2 survival on surfaces as

273

purported sources of transmission. High initial amounts of input virus on a surface may generate

274

artificially inflated survival times compared to realistic lower levels of virus that a subject would

275

normally encounter, not only because there are extra half-lives to go through at the higher

276

concentrations, but also because the half-lives themselves are extended at the higher virus

277

concentrations.

The implications of our findings are also relevant for experiments supporting transmission of

280

respiratory viruses by fomites in general. With the exception of Respiratory Syncytial virus, the

281

belief that most, if not all, of these viruses can be spread by fomites is based solely on dried virus

282

stability experiments (e.g. Kutter et al, 2018). In the case of rhinovirus, the major cause of the

283

common cold, an early report demonstrating experimental fomite transmission used unrealistic

284

conditions (Gwaltney and Hendley, 1982). A subsequent study closer to real-life conditions

285

disproved this route of transmission, at least to a first approximation (Dick et al, 1987). Apparent

286

low efficiency of virus transfer by fingers also needs to be considered when assessing the

287

possibility of fomite transmission, as contact with hands might inactivate some viruses (Weber and

288

Stilianakis, 2021).

289
290

We do not know why higher concentrations of input Phi6 protect the virus from decay, or why it is

291

influenced by the carrier. It could just be a result of higher protein levels in the phage solution

292

buffering the phage particles from the effects of drying out. Marr and coworkers pointed out that as

293

liquid evaporates, the concentration of solutes (in our case, salt) increases in the microenvironment

294

(Lin et al., 2020), which may affect survival. Further, virus aggregation at higher concentrations is

295

likely, and such aggregates may be protective (Gerba and Betancourt, 2017), or simply manifest as

296

protective because clusters of viruses will be counted as single PFU, but behave kinetically as more

297

resistant viruses. Whatever the cause for this protection, it is even more imperative to design

298

surface drying experiments for pathogens with realistic levels of input virus, and account for the

299

effects of carrier and matrix if the results are to be clinically relevant.
