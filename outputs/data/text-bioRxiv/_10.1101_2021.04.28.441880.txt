ABSTRACT
CD8+ T cells are important antiviral effectors that can potentiate long-lived immunity
against COVID-19, but a detailed characterization of these cells has been hampered by
technical challenges. We screened 21 well-characterized, longitudinally-sampled convalescent
donors that recovered from mild COVID-19 against a collection of SARS-CoV-2 tetramers, and
identified one participant with an immunodominant response against Nuc322-331, a peptide that is
conserved in all the SARS-CoV-2 variants-of-concern reported to date. We conducted 38parameter CyTOF phenotyping on tetramer-identified Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells, and on
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognizing the entire nucleocapsid and spike proteins from SARSCoV-2, and took 32 serological measurements on longitudinal specimens from this participant.
We discovered a coordination of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T response with both the CD4+ T
cell and antibody pillars of adaptive immunity. Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells were
predominantly central memory T cells, but continually evolved over a ~6-month period of
convalescence. We observed a slow and progressive decrease in the activation state and
polyfunctionality of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells, accompanied by an increase in their
lymph-node homing and homeostatic proliferation potential. These results suggest that following
a typical case of mild COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells not only persist but
continuously differentiate in a coordinated fashion well into convalescence, into a state
characteristic of long-lived, self-renewing memory.

INTRODUCTION
The uncertainty about the longevity of the immune response elicited by prior SARS-CoV2 infection or vaccination has been a major area of concern as the world tries to exit from the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Studies at the start of the pandemic suggesting a short-lived
SARS-CoV-2 antibody response (1) brought about widespread concern, but follow-up studies
now suggest that infected individuals exhibit a prolonged and evolving humoral immune response
(2, 3). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells – a second arm of adaptive immunity
– can be detected more than six months into convalescence and these cells can self-renew in
response to the homeostatic proliferation cytokine IL7 (4-6). Encouragingly, memory T cells
against the nucleocapsid protein from the closely-related SARS-CoV-1 virus can be detected 17
years after infection (7), suggesting the potential for durable T cell immunity against pathogenic
beta-coronaviruses. Importantly, relative to antibodies, T cells are less prone to evasion by the
variants of concern emerging worldwide (8), suggesting a potentially important role for these
immune effectors in long-term population-based immunity in the years ahead.
Characterizing the memory T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 will improve our
understanding of the features defining long-lived immunity, and of the ability of T cells to protect
against reinfection. While the breadth of the SARS-CoV-2-specific response during
convalescence has been extensively examined (9, 10), much less is known about the phenotypes
of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells. To phenotype SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, most
studies rely on stimulating T cells with SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens/peptides, and examining
the cells that respond by expressing activation-induced markers (AIM) or cytokines (5, 9, 11-13).
These studies likely underestimate the phenotypic complexity of antigen-specific T cells because
of the limited number of AIMs or cytokine markers that can be used to identify responsive cells.
These assays are also limited, because they do not capture antigen-specific T cells in their
original, unstimulated states. Detecting antigen-specific unstimulated cells requires other, more
technically-involved approaches, such as the use of T cell multimers/tetramers. Tetramers, which

consist of four linked peptide-MHC complexes that specifically bind epitope-specific T cells, are
one of the only ways to examine the original phenotypes of antigen-specific T cells. A handful of
studies have incorporated the use of SARS-CoV-2 MHC class I multimers to examine CD8+ T
cell responses (13-18). Due to small numbers of multimer+ cells of a single specificity, most of
these studies examined the combined phenotypes of multimer+ cells recognizing different
epitopes and/or pre-enriched for multimer+ cells (to increase detectability) which can bias the
resulting collection of antigen-specific cells. One of the studies (17) conducted a longitudinal
analysis multimer+ cells from one patient at 6 timepoints – 2 during acute infection and 4 at
convalescence – by examining by FACS the levels of 5 phenotyping parameters on pre-enriched
multimer+ cells. Although these studies together have revealed multimer+ cells to be distributed
among multiple canonical subsets and pinpointed a handful of surface markers expressed by
these cells, the inability to identify enough epitope-specific cells for high-parameter phenotypic
analysis has made it challenging to perform a comprehensive analysis of how SARS-CoV-2specific CD8+ T cells against a defined specificity evolve over the course of convalescence.
To fill this void, we screened banked longitudinal specimens from the UCSF COVID-19
Host Immune Response Pathogenesis (CHIRP) cohort against a collection of SARS-CoV-2
tetramers, to try to identify an immunodominant response that can be captured by tetramer
analysis. This screen identified one individual with a particularly robust response detectable by
one of the tetramers harboring a nucleocapsid peptide. The immunodominance of this response
enabled us to perform a longitudinal analysis without the need to pre-enrich for tetramer+ cells or
combine tetramer+ cells of multiple specificities. By combining 38-parameter CyTOF phenotyping
with detection of these tetramer+ cells, we established an in-depth view of epitope-specific T cell
responses at 5 longitudinal timepoints from early to late (>6 months) COVID-19 convalescence.
Effector responses by these epitope-specific T cells were examined by treating cells with cognate
peptide and examining by CyTOF the cytokine and cytolytic effector mechanisms of these cells.
All longitudinal specimens were also phenotyped by the same effector CyTOF panel for total

nucleocapsid- and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and assessed for the levels
of 32 different isotype-specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All together, we measured nearly 400
different SARS-CoV-2-specific parameters for each of the 5 timepoints, and analyzed them in
association with features of the tetramer+ response in order to provide an integrated and
comprehensive overview of the immunological context surrounding the epitope-specific CD8+ T
cell response. Although this study focuses on only one individual, this person exhibited a typical
mild course of infection that was very well-defined clinically and that fully resolved in a timely
manner. We therefore consider the response we have characterized to potentially reflect a
common one in individuals that have recovered from mild COVID-19.

RESULTS
Identification and description of case study PID4103 with immunodominant Nuc322-331 CD8+
T cell response
The COVID-19 Host Immune Pathogenesis (CHIRP) study is a prospective longitudinal
study designed to understand the evolution of host responses from the acute to convalescent
phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals within 31 days from symptom onset or SARS-CoV2 exposure were enrolled, and participants were sampled for 6 months. Cryopreserved PBMCs
from a total of 21 convalescent CHIRP cohort participants from which specimens from 5
longitudinal study visits were available, and who had mild COVID-19 disease (see Methods), were
screened by flow cytometry against 9 MHC class I tetramers harboring predicted CD8+ T cell
epitopes from the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SAR-CoV-2 (Table S1). We identified one
donor, PID4103, who harbored an immunodominant response against an HLA-B*40:01-restricted
peptide (sequence MEVTPSGTWL) spanning residues 322 to 311 of nucleocapsid (Nuc322-331)
(Fig. 1A). This peptide is 100% conserved in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B429/CAL20C variants
of concern, as well as in the 2002 SARS-CoV-1 virus, but absent from the four common cold
coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 (Fig. S1).

We decided to focus our study on this participant for three reasons: 1) the presence of an
immunodominant response detectable in her blood allowed us to have a sufficient number of cells
to perform in-depth CyTOF phenotyping without combining multiple epitope specificities or preenrichment for tetramer+ cells; 2) the conservation of the immunodominant epitope among the
variants-of-concern ensured that the memory response we studied would be relevant against the
common globally circulating pathogenic strains, and 3) the patient reported symptoms of typical
mild COVID-19 disease (as detailed below), and therefore can serve as a model for the typical
course of disease experienced by most individuals who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 (19,
20).
Participant PID4103 is a 42-year-old Caucasian female whose course of SARS-CoV-2
infection has been extensively characterized (Fig. 1B, Table S2). The participant began
experiencing a constellation of mild acute symptoms on 3/13/2020, including a fever of 102°F,
sore throat, cough, chest pressure, and fatigue. Fever, cough, and sore throat resolved 2 days
later, while chest pressure resolved 7 days post-symptom onset. Nine days post-symptom onset,
she developed dysosmia/dysgeusia and headache, which lasted approximately one week.
Complete resolution of all symptoms did not occur until 23 days from initial symptom onset. The
participant tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2 27 days post-symptom onset, and her clinical
PCR result was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab PCR at her baseline study visit 46 days postsymptom onset (407.5 and 161.5 copies/mL for N1 and N2 probes, respectively), which
corresponded to 19 days after her first positive PCR test. The participant then attended follow-up
visits at 1, 3, 10, and 23 weeks after her baseline visit. At all the follow-up study visits, she tested
negative by PCR for the virus, in specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, stool, and urine.
PID4103 reported no limitations to her activities of daily living over the course of disease.
She had no significant comorbidities other than a prior history of anxiety disorder and
hypothyroidism for which she had previously received pharmacology therapy, and she had no
concomitant medications during the study period. Her clinical lab tests by the time of her baseline

visit (46 days post-symptom onset) were within normal limits. However, her ferritin levels, which
have previously been shown to strongly correlate with COVID-19 symptoms (21), showed a
downtrend over her five study visits (134, 120, 64, 56, 54 ng/mL). Her high sensitivity C reactive
protein (hs-CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were normal by the time she
was enrolled in the study (<8.1 mg/L and <20 mm/hr, respectively), suggesting lack of systemic
inflammation at any of the study visits. PID4103 reported no history of travel in the prior year, or
past history of travel that may have coincided with exposure to SARS-CoV-1 (e.g., no 2002 travel
to Canada or Asia). All together, these clinical features suggest PID4103 to have exhibited a
typical case of mild COVID-19 that resolved on its own without medical intervention, and that did
not result in any long-hauler symptoms.

CyTOF characterization of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells through tetramer staining and
peptide stimulation
To enable a deep assessment of the phenotypes of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells, we
generated lanthanide-conjugated Nuc322-331 tetramers. This allowed for characterization of Nuc322331-specific

CD8+ T cells by CyTOF, a technique that quantitates up to ~40 proteins

simultaneously at the single-cell level through mass spectrometric detection of metal-conjugated
antibodies (22). To increase the noise-to-signal ratio and improve the specificity of detecting
Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells, we conjugated the same tetramer to two different lanthanides,
and considered only cells binding both sets of tetramers as true positives. A population of Nuc322331-specific

CD8+ T cells could be detected from PID4103 that was absent from uninfected

individuals (Fig. 1C). To assess effector function, CD8+ T cells from PID4103 were examined by
CyTOF in the absence of any stimulation, in the presence of costimulation with anti-CD49d/CD28
for 4 hours, and in the presence of costimulation with Nuc322-331 peptide, under conditions that
enabled detection of peptide-induced cytokines at the single-cell level (5). Only in peptidestimulated samples did we observe a distinct population of IFNg-producing cells (Fig. 1D). These

results collectively validate our ability to characterize Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells by CyTOF,
through tetramer staining as well as through identification of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells
responding to cognate peptide stimulation.

Longitudinal assessment Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells reveals coordination with other
components of antigen-specific adaptive immunity
Having validated the specificity of our reagents, we then characterized by CyTOF the magnitude
of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cell response over the course of convalescence using the
PBMCs isolated from PID4103 over the 5 study visits (Fig. 1B). The magnitude of the response
over time was monitored by quantitating both the frequencies of tetramer+ cells in unstimulated
specimens (Fig. 2A) and the frequencies of cells inducing IFNg in response to Nuc322-331
stimulation (Fig. 2B). Both approaches enabled detection of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells at all
5 timepoints including the final one, which was >6 months after symptom onset. The overall
phenotypes of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells in the tetramer+ vs. IFNg+ cells differed as
visualized by tSNE (Fig. 2C). This observation is not surprising since the tetramer+ cells are not
stimulated, while the IFNg+ cells are. However, the majority of individually measured CyTOF
markers were similar between the tetramer+ and IFNg+ cells, and only IFNg and TNFa appeared
upregulated on the IFNg+ cells relative to the tetramer+ cells (Fig. S2, S3). The latter is consistent
with the need for ex vivo stimulation to detect cytokine production. Although there were more
tetramer+ cells than IFNg+ cells, their kinetics were similar over the time course, with a peak 67
days post-symptom onset (Fig. 2D). Our observation that there were approximately twice as many
tetramer+ cells as IFNg+ cells suggests that approximately half the CD8+ T cells of a given
specificity are not captured by the IFNg detection method. This was confirmed by examining the
tetramer+ cells within the Nuc322-331-stimulated sample, half of which turned out to be IFNg+ (Fig.
S4). Interestingly, the majority of these IFNg+ cells also produced TNFa (Fig. S4), suggesting a

polyfunctional response. Importantly, at its maximal peak, the frequency of the Nuc322-331-specific
CD8+ T cells as determined by tetramer staining was 1.3 x 10-3 (Fig. 2A), confirming the
immunodominance of this epitope since COVID-19 CD8+ T cells with the most dominant epitope
reported to date were detected at an average frequency of 6.88 x 10-4 (18).
We then assessed what fraction of the total nucleocapsid-specific CD8+ T cells is
accounted for by Nuc322-331-specific cells. To this end, we stimulated samples from all five
timepoints with overlapping peptides covering the entire nucleocapsid protein (Fig. S5A), and
measured IFNg-responding cells by CyTOF. Both cell populations (Nuc322-331 and total
nucleocapsid-specific CD8+ T cells) had similar kinetics, as expected (Fig. 2E), and at all 5
timepoints, the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells accounted for the bulk of the nucleocapsid-specific
CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2E). For comparison, we also assessed the spike-specific CD8+ T cells from
these specimens using overlapping peptides covering the entire spike protein (Fig. S5A). These
cells also mirrored the kinetics of the Nuc322-331-specific cells, but interestingly were always less
abundant (Fig. 2E). These data reaffirm the immunodominance of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T
cells, which surpass even that of the spike-specific CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, they demonstrate
that the kinetics of the CD8+ T cell response against nucleocapsid and spike in PID4103 is
coordinated, peaking 67 days post-symptom onset and decreasing thereafter.
We then assessed to what extent the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cell response is
coordinated with the response of CD4+ T cells and antibodies. When we assessed by CyTOF
total and T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4+ T cells specific to nucleocapsid (Fig. 2F, S5B), we found
that both peaked at the third timepoint (67 days post symptom onset), just like the Nuc322-331specific CD8+ T cells did (Fig. 2E, F). When we measured 8 isotypes (IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3,
IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, and IgE) of antibodies against full-length nucleocapsid, we found that only IgM,
IgG1, and IgG4 nucleocapsid-specific antibodies above detectable limits, with IgG1 being the
dominant response. All three isotypes of nucleocapsid-specific antibodies increased from the third
to the fourth timepoints (Fig. 2G). As a “helped” antibody response would be expected to develop

only after a spike in a CD4+ Tfh response (which occurred at the third timepoint, Fig. 2F), these
results suggest a coordinated T cell-dependent antibody response in this individual during
convalescence. For comparison, we also assessed the CD4+ T cell and antibody response
against spike. Spike-specific CD4+ T cells peaked slightly earlier than the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+
T cells (Fig. 2F). Antibodies against the spike N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 domains, as well
as against the RBD domain of S1 that mediates binding to the ACE2 entry receptor, were
quantitated. Interestingly, in contrast to the T cell data where the response to nucleocapsid
response dominated over the response to spike, the antibody response to spike was dominant
over the response to nucleocapsid (Fig. 2G). Similar to the nucleocapsid data, the dominant
antibody isotype against spike was IgG1. Interestingly, however, the antibody response to S1 and
RBD progressively decreased over the course of convalescence, while the antibody response to
S2 more closely mirrored the response to nucleocapsid, increasing from the third to the fourth
timepoints (Fig. 2G). Taken together, these data suggest a synchronous increase in CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells preceding the antibody response.
As a complementary way of examining the coordination between these different adaptive
immune responses, we conducted an integrated analysis of all the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell
and antibody response measurements from our study. We included the frequencies of all the
subsets of Nuc322-331-, and Nuc-, and Spike-specific T cells we identified by manual gating as well
as flowSOM clustering (see subsequent sections); the median expression levels of each CyTOFquantitated antigen on total CD8+ T cells, the tetramer+ cells, and all the CD4+ and CD8+ IFNg+
cells responding to Nuc322-331, nucleocapsid, or spike peptide treatments; all 32 antibody
measurements (4 proteins x 8 isotypes); and the clinical lab measurements. This resulted in a
matrix of 393 measured parameters, for each of the 5 timepoints. When we conducted k-means
unsupervised clustering to assess which parameters were closely related, we found the kinetic
patterns of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to Nuc322-331, nucleocapsid, and spike to cluster
together (Fig. 2H). Interestingly, the levels of ferritin, which were reported to positively correlate

with COVID-19 symptoms (21), clustered right next to the magnitude of the tetramer+ cell
response (Fig. 2H). As expected, the nucleocapsid antibody response clustered separately as it
was delayed relative to the T cell response (Fig. 2H). Overall, these data suggest that the Nuc322331-specific

CD8+ T cell response is synchronized with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against

nucleocapsid and spike, followed by a boosting of the nucleocapsid and S2 IgG1, IgG4, and IgM
antibodies.

The phenotypes and potential for long-term persistence of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells
evolve during convalescence
We then took advantage of the 38-parameter phenotyping of our tetramer+ cells to
characterize the phenotypes of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T central memory (Tcm),
T effector memory (Tem), T transitional memory (Ttm), Temra, and a mixed population of naïve
and T stem cell memory cells (Tn/Tscm) were identified through use of various combinations of
the phenotyping markers CD8, CD45RO, CD45RA, CCR7, and CD27 (Fig. 3A). In addition we
distinguished, among the memory (CD45RO+) CD8+ T cells, those that were less (CD27+CD28+)
or more (CD27-CD28-) terminally differentiated (Fig. 3A). Terminal differentiation and expansion
potential were also examined by monitoring expression of CD57 (terminal differentiation marker),
CD27 (marker of long-lived cells), and CD127 (alpha chain of IL7 receptor involved in homeostatic
proliferation) (Fig. 3B). Cytolytic activity was assessed by monitoring expression of the effector
molecules perforin and granzyme B, the degranulation marker CD107a, and CD29, which marks
cells with cytolytic activity (23) (Fig. 3C). Tetramer+ cells could be detected among all the
aforementioned populations, although in vastly different proportions (Fig. 3A-C).
We assessed the tetramer+ cells for relative changes in subset distribution over the ~6month period analyzed in this study. Among tetramer+ cells, Tem cells were at negligible
frequencies throughout the timecourse, while Tcm cells were most common. Tetramer+ Ttm and
Temra cells were also abundant, although the Ttm subset frequency dropped precipitously at the

final timepoint. Interestingly, the contribution of the Tn/Tscm subset increased steadily over the
course of convalescence, reaching the highest levels at the final timepoint (Fig. 3D). This increase
parallels the increase in expression levels of CD45RA and CCR7 (markers used to define the
Tn/Tscm subset) within the tetramer+ population (Fig. 3D). In terms of differentiation state, there
was a progressive decrease over time of the early-differentiated CD27+CD28+ memory T cell
subset among tetramer+ cells (Fig. 3E). This was accompanied by a progressive increase in
CD127 positivity, with the CD127+ cells residing almost exclusively among CD57- and CD27+
cells (Fig. 3F). Cytolytic tetramer+ cells decreased over time (Fig. 3G), and this was accompanied
by a gradual decrease in the expression levels of some (CD69, ICOS, HLADR, CD38) but not all
(CD25) activation markers on these cells (Fig. 3H). Together, these results suggest a continual
differentiation of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells long after resolution of infection. These changes
include the evolution of the cells to a state defined by less activation and cytolytic activity, and
more proliferative and expansion potential.

Clustering of high-dimensional datasets identifies features of convalescence-associated
expanding cluster of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells
The subset identification based on manual gating described above utilizes only a small
fraction of the phenotyping markers examined by our CyTOF panel. Visualization of the
phenotypic distribution of the tetramer+ cells by tSNE suggests global changes in phenotypes
over time (Fig. 4A) that may not have been captured through manual gating. We therefore next
implemented a more holistic approach of subset definition by clustering. Total CD8+ T cells in the
unstimulated specimens (including the tetramer+ cells) were segregated into 5 clusters by
flowSOM (24) (Fig. 4B). Although tetramer+ cells were detected among all 5 clusters, they were
not evenly distributed, and the distribution also changed over time (Fig. 4C, D). Clusters A2 and
A4 were the dominant clusters among tetramer+ cells, but interestingly while cluster A2 increased
over time, cluster A4 decreased (Fig. 4D). When we manually gated on a concatenated file

corresponding to all of the cluster A2 and A4 cells (which together include most of the tetramer+
cells), we found that these cells collectively harbored Tcm, Tem, Ttm, Temra, and Tn/Tscm
subsets (Fig. 4E), suggesting that the dominant population of tetramer+ cells cannot be binned
into any single canonical cellular subset. To try to define features of clusters A2+A4, we assessed
for antigens that were similarly differentially expressed on these two clusters as compared to total
CD8+ T cells. Relative to total CD8+ T cells, A2 and A4 cells expressed high levels of CD127 and
the transcription factor NFAT1, as well as high levels of the lung-homing molecules CD49d, CD29,
and CCR5 (Fig. 4F). We then assessed for differentially-expressed markers that were unique to
clusters A2 vs. A4, to assess the subset features that increase (cluster A2) vs. decrease (cluster
A4) over the course of convalescence. Cluster A2 expressed high levels of the lymph node
homing receptors CCR7 and CD62L, the checkpoint molecules TIGIT and CTLA-4, the costimulatory receptors CD28 and Ox40, and the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC5 (Fig. 4G). In
comparison, cluster A4 expressed low levels of CCR7 and CD62L, high levels of the activation
marker CD69, and high levels of the degranulation marker CD107a (Fig. 4H). These data are
consistent with the manual gating results suggesting a slow expansion of long-lived Nuc322-331specific CD8+ T cells paired with a decrease in their cytolytic counterparts, but identify additional
phenotypic features of the cellular subsets to which these cells belong.

Polyfunctional Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells are detected months into convalescence
While phenotypic analysis of the tetramer+ cells in the unstimulated samples enabled an
in-depth assessment of the differentiation states, expansion potential, homing patterns, and
cytolytic activity of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells, they did not allow assessment of the cytokines
these cells are capable of producing. We therefore next characterized the phenotypes of cells
from the specimens stimulated for 4 hours with Nuc322-331 peptide. In these specimens, Nuc322-331specific CD8+ T cells were defined as the IFNg+ cells following peptide treatment (Fig. 2B, D),
similar to recently implemented methods (5). Characterization of the canonical subsets (Tcm,

Tem, Ttm, Temra, Tn/Tscm) revealed that in contrast to the data from unstimulated tetramer+
cells (Fig. 3D), Tcm cells were not the dominant subset among the responding cells (Fig. 5A, C).
This can be explained by the decreased expression of the Tcm markers CD45RO and CCR7 on
the IFNg+ as compared to the tetramer+ cells (Fig. S2, S3), likely caused by stimulation-induced
downregulation of these receptors. Similar to the tetramer+ data, however, the contribution of the
Tn/Tscm subset to the IFNg+ cells increased over time (Fig. 5C). Cytolytic cells were detected
among the IFNg+ cells (Fig. 5D). Although these IFNg+ cytolytic cells decreased over time, they
still represented a sizable proportion of the cells up until the 4th timepoint, suggesting the existence
of polyfunctional (both IFNg-producing and cytolytic) Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells well into
convalescence (at least 117 days post-symptom onset). To further probe the polyfunctionality of
Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells, we assessed to what extent they induced IFNg, TNFa, or IL6, the
latter of which has been implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis and may be produced by multiple
immune cells including T cells (25). At the first four timepoints, the vast majority of IFNg+ cells
also produced TNFa, while at the final timepoint responding cells were more equally distributed
among IFNg+TNFa+ and IFNg+TNFa- cells (Fig. 5E, 5F). Interestingly, none of the IFNg+ cells
co-produced IL6, and overall the proportion of Nuc322-331-specific IL6+ T cells was negligible (Fig.
5E). Assessing all three cytokines together, it was apparent that most of the responding cells
dually produced IFNg and TNFa (but no IL6), and that the frequencies of these cells decreased
over time beginning at the third timepoint, 67 days post-symptom onset (Fig. 5F). Not only did the
percent of IFNg+TNFa+ decrease over time, but also the absolute levels of IFNg and TNFa
produced by these cells (Fig. 5G).
Finally, to further probe the effector features of these polyfunctional responding cells, we
implemented flowSOM clustering. As we had conducted CyTOF phenotyping of CD8+ T cells
responding not only to Nuc322-331, but also to overlapping peptides from the entire nucleocapsid
and spike proteins (Fig. 2E), we clustered all of these responding cells together to compare their

effector functions and overall phenotypes. The overall phenotypes of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+
T cells were similar to those of the nucleocapsid-specific CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6A), consistent with
the response to this immunodominant peptide being representative of the response to its parent
protein. Interestingly, however, the phenotypes of the spike-specific CD8+ T cell cells differed as
reflected by their different distribution within the tSNE plot (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, while the
majority of the Nuc322-331-specific and Nuc-specific CD8+ T cells belonged to cluster B1, the
phenotypes of the spike-specific CD8+ T cells were more evenly distributed, although cluster B1
was also the dominant cluster for the spike-specific cells (Fig. 6B). Cluster B1 included T cells
expressing cytolytic markers (granzyme B, CD107a) and cytokines (IFNg, TNFa) (Fig. 6C)
consistent with the polyfunctionality of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells during convalescence.
Cluster B1, however, also included cells with low levels of cytolytic effectors, and these became
more prevalent at the later timepoints (Fig. 6D), consistent with the diminishing polyfunctionality
of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells over the course of convalescence and their differentiation
into long-lived memory cells.

DISCUSSION
An important role for CD8+ T cells in effective host response against SARS-CoV-2 was
implicated early during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it was observed that lymphopenia,
particularly of CD8+ T cells, associates with disease severity (26). Moreover, the CD8+ T cell
response directed against the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 may be particularly
important, as it appears to be more common than the response directed against spike and other
non-structural proteins (14, 17, 27). Interestingly, CD8+ T cell responses against SARS-CoV-1
also appear to be nucleocapsid-focused, and SARS-CoV-1-specific CD8+ T cells still detectable
17 years after the 2002 SARS outbreak were found to be reactive against nucleocapsid (7).
These prior observations implicate nucleocapsid-specific CD8+ T cells not only as important
guardians during acute infection, but also as a reservoir of long-lived memory cells.

In this study, we screened both spike and nucleocapsid MHC class I tetramers against
convalescent COVID-19 participants from the CHIRP cohort, and identified Nuc322-331 as an
immunodominant epitope in one of the participants. The maximal proportion of Nuc322-331specific CD8+ T cells was 0.13%, which exceeds the ~0.0688% that was recently reported as
the most immunodominant CD8+ T cell response known to date in COVID-19 (18) and is about
two orders of magnitude higher than the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cells against other
epitopes (16). Further supporting its immunodominance is our observation that at all five
timepoints, the proportion of Nuc322-331-specific cells exceeded that of the CD8+ T cells directed
against the entire spike protein. Other groups have also reported Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T
cells at frequencies similar to ours (0.093%(13)) or lower (<0.01%; (17)). The lower frequency
detected in the latter study may be donor-dependent, or could reflect a frequency calculation
based off measurements of pre-enriched tetramer+ cells. Of note, the relatively high frequency
of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells is not due to prior clonal amplification elicited by commoncold coronaviruses, as this peptide is not conserved in those strains. It is also unlikely to have
been previously primed by SARS-CoV-1 in PID4103, since despite 100% conservation of this
peptide between the two SARS strains, the participant’s travel history suggest that she could not
have been previously exposed to the 2002 virus. Whether the immunodominance of Nuc322-331specific CD8+ T cells is due to high frequencies of precursors in the naïve TCR repertoire, the
molecular features of this peptide interacting with MHC, and/or the kinetics of its presentation by
antigen presenting cells in vivo, remains to be determined. Importantly, as the Nuc322-331
sequence is 100% identical in all of the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, the Nuc322-331
responses characterized in this study can be presumed to be as effective against the variants
as they are against the original strain.
Extensive CyTOF phenotyping of tetramer+ CD8+ T cells of the longitudinal samples
from PID4103 revealed that among the canonical subsets, Tcm were most common. These
results are consistent with recent reports that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-derived tetramer+

cells were commonly of the CD45RA-CD27+ phenotype (18), characteristic of both the Tcm and
Ttm subsets. We further observed that one of the surface markers used to define Tcm cells,
CCR7, increased over the course of convalescence among tetramer+ cells. Furthermore,
unbiased clustering of the datasets identified a dominant cluster (A2) of tetramer+ cells that
increased over the course of convalescence, and this cluster was characterized by high levels
of both CCR7 and CD62L expression. As both of these receptors direct immune cells into lymph
nodes, the data suggest that over the course of ~6 months of convalescence, Nuc322-331-specific
CD8+ T cells continuously differentiate towards a state more likely to home to lymph nodes.
Tcm cells, a canonical lymph node-homing subset, are thought to be relatively long-lived
compared to other memory subsets such as Tem and Ttm (28). Another long-lived subset
expressing CCR7 are Tscm cells, which have long telomeres and are maintained by ongoing
proliferation (29). Although in our CyTOF panel we could not distinguish between Tn and Tscm
cells, we suspect that the CD45RA+CD45RO-CCR7+ subset (comprising both Tn and Tscm
cells) we detected among tetramer+ cells were predominantly of the Tscm phenotype, since
naïve T cells recognizing Nuc322-331 are expected to be very rare. These Tn/Tscm cells
increased steadily over the course of convalescence, plateauing at 117 days post-symptom
onset. A recent cross-sectional study where convalescents were binned into early vs. late
convalescence also found CD45RA+CCR7+ tetramer+ cells to be higher in the latter phase
(15), consistent with our longitudinal data. That study also found that among tetramer+ cells, the
percentage of CD127+ cells increased as a function of days since symptom onset out to 120
days. This again mirrors our longitudinal analysis, where we found that both the percentage of
CD127+ cells and the median expression levels of CD127 on the cells steadily increased from
43 to 207 days post symptom onset. Interestingly, the CD127+ cells were almost exclusively
CD27+ and CD57-, suggesting a high expansion potential for these cells. Indeed, our recent
study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells expressing CD127 were capable of
homeostatically expanding ex vivo (5). Together with prior demonstrations that CD127

expression identifies CD8+ T cell memory precursors giving rise to long-lived memory cells (30),
these data suggest a slow differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells to lymph-node
homing, long-lived memory cells with expansion potential, in the months following recovery from
mild COVID-19.
In contrast, other features of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells tended to decrease
over time. Within the first four months of convalescence, Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells were
largely polyfunctional, with most producing both IFNg and TNFa, and a substantial fraction of
these cells additionally expressing cytolytic markers. This changed at the final timepoint (>6
months convalescence), when the cytolytic activity of the cells dropped and cells capable of
producing both IFNg and TNFa decreased. Interestingly, the decrease in polyfunctionality was
mirrored by a decrease in the activation state of the cells, as reflected by a decrease in CD69
and ICOS, and to a lesser extent HLADR and CD38. This was in some aspect surprising as we
would have expected the activation state of the cells to have returned back to normal by the
second timepoint, which was almost 2 months after symptom onset and 30 days after the
complete resolution of all symptoms. Together, these results suggest slow changes in the
features and functional responses of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells long after full recovery
from mild COVID-19.
One of the most interesting findings from this study was the coordinated response of
Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells with other components of the adaptive immune system. The
magnitude of the Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cell response peaked at 67 days post symptom
onset, and then decreased thereafter, as did the total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response against
nucleocapsid, and the total CD8+ T cell response against spike. The antibody response also
exhibited convalescence spikes, but delayed relative to the T cell peak. The delay of the
antibody response is reasonable given the time needed for B cells to be effectively helped by
CD4+ T cells, and our finding that the nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cell response peaked at

the 3rd timepoint, which was followed by spikes at the 4th timepoint in multiple isotypes of
antibodies against the same protein, suggests a CD4+ T cell-helped B cell response in
PID4103. An increase in the T cell and antibody response 67 to 117 days post symptom onset
was in fact unexpected, given that this was 30-94 days post-symptom resolution and long after
the virus had been cleared. Although this convalescence peak in adaptive immune response
could theoretically have been caused by re-infection of this participant, we think that possibility
unlikely because 1) she tested negative in PCR tests at all timepoints except her baseline visit,
2) we saw no evidence of elevated Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cell activation at the spiking
timepoints (in fact activation progressively decreased, as discussed above), which we would
have expected upon re-infection, 3) the participant reported no reemergence of COVID-19
symptoms after initial symptom resolution, 4) re-infection is overall uncommon. Further in-depth
analyses of the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in additional individuals are needed to
confirm whether the immune response detailed here is recapitulated in others who experienced
mild COVID-19 disease.
In summary, we report an unexpectedly dynamic evolution of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T
cells during convalescence in PID4103. This evolution was gradual and persistent even up to 6
months after complete symptom resolution. We observed coordination of this response with the
CD4+ T cell and antibody responses directed against the same antigen, and found that it was
characterized by a progressive diminution of the activation state and polyfunctionality of cells in
parallel with increases in their expansion potential. If one assumes similarities to nucleocapsidspecific CD8+ T cells from SARS-CoV-1, then the course of differentiation we describe here
may be one that leads to SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that can persist for up to
17 years, and perhaps even longer.

METHODS
Human Subjects
This study was approved by the University of California, San Francisco (IRB #20-30588).
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study utilized specimens from the UCSF
acute COVID-19 Host Immune Pathogenesis (CHIRP) longitudinal cohort. Five longitudinal
specimens were collected from acute COVID-19-infected individuals, the first within 31 days of
symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure (week 0, baseline visit), followed by collections at 1,
3, 10, and 24 weeks from baseline visit. Whole blood was collected in ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
by ficoll as previously described (5) and cryopreserved in 10% DMSO diluted in fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Plasma from the same specimens were collected and cryopreserved. A total of 21
CHIRP participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as assessed by RT-PCR were
screened by FACS for specific binding to APC-labeled MHC class I tetramers, as described in
the following section. PID4103 (Table S1) was identified as a donor with an immunodominant
response against the HLA-B*40:01/Nuc322-331 tetramer.

Flow Cytometry
Cryopreserved PBMCs from 21 CHIRP participants were thawed and cultured overnight to
enable antigen recovery, and then screened by FACS for specific binding to APC-labeled MHC
class I tetramers (Table S2) obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core Facility. These tetramers
harbor predicted MHC class I epitopes from SARS-CoV-2. For tetramer staining, 1 million cells
were transferred into 96-well V-bottom polystyrene plates and washed once with FACS buffer
(PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 2 mM EDTA), stained with 15 μg/ml the APC-labeled
MHC class I tetramer for 1h at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with FACS
buffer, and stained for 30 min on ice with a cocktail of antibodies diluted in a 1:1 mixture of
FACS buffer and the Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences). The antibody cocktail consisted of

APC/Cy7-CD3 (SK7, Biolegend), BD Horizonä BV650-CD8 (RPA-T8, BD Biosciences), BD
Horizonä BUV737-CD4 (SK3, BD Biosciences), and the LIVE/DEAD Zombie Aquaä Fixable
Viability Kit (Biolegend). After 3 additional washes with FACS buffer, cells were fixed and
analyzed on an LSRFortessaTM (BD Biosciences).

Tetramerization of biotinylated MHC class I monomers with metal-labeled streptavidin
Streptavidin was labeled with metal as previously described (31). Biotinylated HLA-B*40:01
monomers with SARS-CoV-2 Nuc322-331 were obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core Facility.
Tetramerization was performed as previously described (31). Briefly, the biotinylated monomers
and metal-labeled streptavidin were each diluted to 50 μg/ml in PBS. A total of 10 μl of metallabeled streptavidin was then transferred to 100 μl of peptide-MHC class I monomer. The
solution was then mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After repeating the
process twice (resulting in a total of 30 μl of metal-labeled streptavidin being transferred to 100
μl of the monomer solution), CyFACS buffer (metal contaminant-free PBS (Rockland)
supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide) was added to reach a
final volume of 500 μl. For each specimen containing up to 6x106 cells, 100 μl metal-labeled
tetramer was used.

Preparation of specimens for CyTOF
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and cultured overnight. Baseline specimens were stained
directly in the absence of ex vivo stimulation. For identification of antigen-specific T cells
through intracellular cytokine staining, 6x106 cells were stimulated with 0.5 mg/ml anti-CD49d
clone L25 (BD Biosciences) and 0.5 mg/ml anti-CD28 clone L293 (BD Biosciences) in the
absence or presence of peptides for 4h in RP10 media (RPMI 1640 medium (Corning)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, VWR), 1% penicillin (GIBCO), and 1%

streptomycin (GIBCO)) in the presence of 3 mg/ml Brefeldin A Solution (eBioscience). Peptides
used were 1 mM PepMix SARS-CoV-2 Peptide (Spike Glycoprotein) (JPT Peptide
Technologies), 1 mM PepMix SARS-CoV-2 Peptide (NCAP) (JPT Peptide Technologies), or 1
mM PepMix SARS-CoV-2 Peptide (MEVTPSGTWL) (custom synthesized by JPT Peptide
Technologies).

CyTOF staining
We designed a 38-parameter CyTOF panel that allows assessment of the phenotypes,
differentiation states, effector functions, and activation status of T cells, as well as homing
receptors and transcription factors (Table S3). Antibodies that required in-house conjugation
were conjugated to their corresponding metal isotopes using X8 antibody labeling kits according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Fluidigm). For CyTOF staining, 6x106 cells were blocked for 15
min on ice with sera from mouse (Thermo Fisher), rat (Thermo Fisher), and human (AB serum,
Sigma-Aldrich) in NuncTM 96 Deep-Well polystyrene plates (Thermo Fisher). Cells were washed
twice with CyFACS buffer, then stained with tetramer for 1h at room temperature in the
presence of 50 nM dasatinib (Sprycel) to reduce T-cell receptor internalization and improve
tetramer staining. Cells were then washed twice with CyFACS buffer, and stained for 45 min on
ice with the cocktail of CyTOF surface staining antibodies (Table S3) in a total volume of 100 μl /
well. Cells were then washed three times with CyFACS buffer and stained with Maleimide
DOTA (Macrocyclics) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice with CyFACS and fixed
overnight at 4°C with 2% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in metal contaminant-free PBS
(Rockland). The next day, cells were permeabilized by incubation for 30 min at 4°C with fix/perm
buffer (eBioscience), and then washed twice with Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience). Cells
were then blocked for 15 min on ice with sera from mouse (Thermo Fisher) and rat (Thermo
Fisher). Cells were then washed twice with Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience) and stained
for 45 min on ice with the cocktail of CyTOF intracellular staining antibodies (Table S3). Cells

were next washed once with CyFACS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 250
nM Cell-IDTM DNA Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm) in 2% PFA diluted in PBS. As a final step, cells were
washed twice with CyFACS, once with MaxparÒ Cell Staining Buffer (Fluidigm), once with
MaxparÒ PBS (Fluidigm), and once with MaxparÒ Cell Acquisition Solution (Fluidigm).
Immediately prior to acquisition, cells were resuspended to a concentration of 7 x105 / ml in
EQTM calibration beads (Fluidigm) diluted in MaxparÒ Cell Acquisition Solution. Cells were
acquired at a rate of 250-350 events/sec on a CyTOF2 instrument (Fluidigm) at the UCSF Flow
Cytometry Core.

CyTOF data analysis
The CyTOF datasets were normalized to EQTM calibration beads using Fluidigm’s CyTOF
software, exported as FCS files, and imported into FlowJo (BD) and Cytobank for gating and
downstream analysis. Total T cells were identified using a sequential gating strategy based on
DNA content, viability, cell length, and a CD3+CD19- gate. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were
then identified by subgating on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells as appropriate, followed by tetramer+ or
IFNg+ gating. FlowJo (BD) was used for gating, generation of histogram plots, and mapping of
defined populations onto the tSNE plots. Cytobank was used to calculate the median signal
intensity (MSI) of cell populations based on standard two-dimensional dot plots. Cytobank was
also used to generate tSNE plots and FlowSOM plots using the default settings (with a
modification of total metaclusters from 10 to 5 for FlowSOM analysis). All of the phenotyping
markers were used in tSNE and FlowSOM analysis, except for CD19, which was a parameter
used in the upstream gating strategy. Line graphs were generated using ggplot2 in R. The raw
CyTOF datasets generated from this study are available for download through the public
repository Dryad via the following link: https://doi.org/10.7272/Q6D21VVD.

Serology
The flow cytometry-based serological assay, based off previously validated methods (32), was
used to quantitate the relative levels of IgA1, IgA2, IgE, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgM
against the nucleocapsid and various domains of the spike protein (S1, S2, and the RBD
domain of S1). This assay for measuring serum antibody levels uses biotin-conjugated antigens
coupled to streptavidin-coated microspheres (beads). Incubation of antigen-bead complexes
with patient sera, and subsequent staining by fluorescently-conjugated, isotype-specific
antibodies, produces a flow cytometric readout of bead fluorescence which reveals the levels of
antigen-specific antibodies and their isotypes. The assay was calibrated using mouse
monoclonal (IgG2B) antibodies raised against the RBD/S1/S2/NP antigens. The calibration
revealed high specificity and no cross-reactivity between antigens, with the exception of crossreactivity of anti-RBD antibodies against S1, which was expected as RBD is contained within
S1. To assess isotype usage of RBD/S1/S2/NP-specific antibodies from PID4103, we incubated
antigen-coated beads with plasma from the five timepoint specimens of PID4103 (1:2 dilution in
HBSS + 0.1% BSA media). Non-specific antibody binding was assessed by incubation of
plasma with uncoated (antigen-free) beads. The beads were washed with HBSS supplemented
with 0.1% BSA, and then stained with an isotype-specific, fluorescently conjugated cocktail of
antibodies at a concentration empirically determined to have minimal background binding to
both antigen-coated and uncoated beads. Processed beads were analyzed using a BD
FACSymphonyTM flow cytometer. Raw values were normalized by subtraction of non-specific
signal as determined by the signal from the antigen-free beads. The grey shaded areas (Fig.
2G) highlight low-confidence signals where the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) difference
between specific and non-specific signal was less than 100 units.

We performed unsupervised cell clustering of all the measured parameters using a k-means
algorithm implemented using the kmeans function in R (https://wwww.R-project.org/). Each kind
of measured parameter was centered using the mean of the corresponding levels across the
five timepoints and scaled using the standard deviation of the values, before proceeding with
unsupervised clustering. To find the optimal number of clusters, the gap statistic, a metric that
evaluates clustering efficiency by comparing the sum of within-cluster distance from real data
and null data (33), was implemented using the R library factoextra (https://CRAN.Rproject.org/package=factoextra). The gap statistic was measured with K values ranging from 1
to 100. Since the gap statistic trend curve increased as K increased, the optimal K value was
selected as that within 1 standard error from the first local maximum. The optimal K value was
determined to be 5, and the validity of cell subtypes was examined by visualizing measured
parameter patterns using a heatmap generated using pheatmap (http://CRAN.Rproject.org/package=pheatmap).

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. Identification and description of case study PID4103 with immunodominant
CD8+ T cell response against Nuc331-331
(A) A distinct population of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells is detected by FACS tetramer
staining in convalescent donor PID4103. Top: PBMCs from uninfected individuals were
analyzed by FACS for binding to the HLA-B*40:01/Nuc322-331 tetramer. Results are
representative of 6 independent uninfected donors. Bottom: PBMCs from convalescent
COVID-19 individuals from the CHIRP cohort were analyzed by FACS for binding to the
HLA-B*40:01/Nuc322-331 tetramer. Participant PID4103, but not participants PID4134 and
PID 4135, harbors cells binding to the tetramer. Numbers correspond to the percentage
of cells within the gates. Results are gated on live, singlet CD3+CD8+ cells.
(B) Timeline of clinical course of PID4103’s SARS-CoV-2 infection and sampling. Red
indicates the dates of specific symptom initiation and resolution, blue the dates and
results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, and green the dates of blood draws.
(C) A distinct population of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells is detected by CyTOF in
PID4103 through dual tetramer staining. PBMCs from one uninfected individual and from
PID4103 were stained with two sets of HLA-B*40:01/Nuc322-331 tetramers conjugated to
different metal lanthalides, facilitating specific detection of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T
cells. Numbers correspond to the percentage of cells within the gates. Results are gated
on live, singlet CD3+CD8+ cells.
(D) Nuc322-331 specific CD8+ T cells can be stimulated by the Nuc322-331 peptide. PBMCs from
PID4103 were phenotyped by CyTOF at baseline, or following 4 hours of co-stimulation
with aCD49d/CD28 antibody in the absence or presence of the Nuc322-331 peptide.
Stimulations were conducted in the presence of brefeldin A to enable the detection of

Figure 2. Longitudinal assessment of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cell responses in PID4103
reveals coordination with other components of antigen-specific adaptive immunity
(A) Identification of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells by CyTOF. Baseline specimens that
never underwent any stimulation were stained with HLA-B*40:01/Nuc322-331 tetramers
detectable on two different CyTOF channels. The timeline refers to days since symptom
onset. Numbers correspond to the percentage of cells within the gate. Results are gated
on live, singlet CD3+CD8+ cells.
(B) CD8+ T cells specifically producing IFNg in response to Nuc322-331 stimulation were
detected at all five timepoints. Numbers correspond to the percentage of cells within the
gate. Results are gated on live, singlet CD3+CD8+ cells.
(C) Tetramer+ and IFNg+ cells responding to Nuc322-331 treatment reside in unique regions of
the tSNE, suggesting phenotypic changes elicited by cognate peptide recognition. tSNE

(green) cells from the peptide-stimulated samples, over the course of convalescence of
PID4103. Datasets correspond to those extracted from the data presented in panels A
and B.
(D) The tetramer+ response is higher in magnitude than the IFNg+ response but exhibits
similar kinetics, peaking 67 days post-symptom onset. Datasets correspond to those
extracted from the data presented in panels A and B.
(E) The responses of CD8+ T cell to Nuc322-331, the entire nucleocapsid protein (Nuc), and
the entire spike protein are coordinated. Note that the IFNg+ response to Nuc322-331 is

greater than the response to the entire spike proteins and lesser than the response to
the entire nucleocapsid protein.
(F) The total and Tfh CD4+ T cell responses against nucleocapsid peaks 67 days postsymptom onset, while the response to spike peaks slightly earlier. Total (left) or Tfh
(CD4+CD45RO+CD45RA-PD1+CXCR5+) (right) CD4+ T cells responding to
overlapping peptides spanning the entire nucleocapsid or spike proteins were assessed.
(G) Titers of different antibody types against nucleocapsid, and the S1, S2, and RBD
domains of spike, monitored at the 5 timepoints, and expressed as normalized
fluorescence values (see Methods). The dotted line indicates the limit of detection.
(H) Unsupervised k-means clustering of cells, antibodies and other biomarkers based on
their abundance in PID4103’s blood across five time points. For each biomarker,
abundance is normalized across time points and colored from red (highest) to blue
(lowest). The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell against Nuc322-331, nucleocapsid, and spike
clustered together. Interestingly, ferritin levels clustered close to them. In contrast,
antibody responses against nucleocapsid were delayed and occurred after the peaks of
the T cell responses. The green bars on the left correspond to clustering as determine
by k-means.

differentiation stages. The Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells (tetramer+) cells are shown
as red contours, while total CD8+ T cells are shown in grey. The following gates were
used: Tcm (CD45RO+CD45RA-CD27+CCR7+), Ttm (CD45RO+CD45RA-CD27+CCR7-

Tn/Tscm (CD45RO-CD45RA+CCR7+), early differentiation (CD45RO+CD45RACD27+CD28+) and late differentiation (CD45RO+CD45RA-CD27-CD28-).
(B) Gating strategy to identify different populations of CD127+ cells among total (grey) and
Nuc322-331-specific (red) CD8+ T cells. Shown also are gates for less differentiated
(CD57-) and Tcm-like (CD27+) CD127+ T cells.
(C) Gating strategy to identify cytolytic Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells. Top: Gates defining
CD8+ T cells co-expressing granzyme B and perforin, or granzyme and CD107a.
Bottom: Gate defining cells expressing high levels of CD29, a marker for cytolytic CD8+
T cells.
(D) The proportions of tetramer+ cells belonging to the Tcm, Tem, Ttm, Temra, and Tn/Tscm
subsets as defined in panel A are shown in the first two plots. Note the high contribution
of Tcm at all timepoints, and the progressive increase of the Tn/Tscm subset over time.
The panel on the right displays the median expression levels of CD45RA and CCR7
(markers used to define the Tn/Tscm subset [panel A]) within the tetramer+ population.
(E) Early differentiated CD8+ T cells steeply decline in abundance only at the final timepoint,
207 days post symptom onset. Shown are the proportions of tetramer+ cells belonging to
the early (CD45RO+CD27+CD28+) and late (CD45RO+CD27-CD28-) differentiated
subsets over the course of convalescence.
(F) Progressive increase in CD127+ Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells over a ~6 month period
of convalescence. Left: Proportions of tetramer+ cells that were CD127+, CD127+CD57and CD127+CD27+. The overlapping frequencies of the three populations of cells
suggest that most of the CD127+ cells are CD57- and CD27+. Right: Median expression
levels of CD127 within the tetramer+ population.

(G) Cytolytic Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells slowly decrease over the course of
convalescence. The proportions of tetramer+ cells that were CD29+,
granzymeB+CD107a+, and granzymeB+perforin+ are shown.
(H) The activation state of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells generally decreases slowly over
the course of convalescence. The median expression levels of the indicated activation
markers on tetramer+ cells are shown. A gradual decrease was apparent among CD69,
ICOS, HLADR, CD38 but not CD25, whose expression was low at all timepoints.

expansion and contraction
(A) The overall phenotypes of Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells change over the course of
convalescence. tSNE plots of total (grey) and tetramer+ (red) CD8+ T cells as a function
of time since symptom onset.
(B) FlowSOM clusters of CD8+ T cells. Total CD8+ T cells (including the tetramer+ cells)
were clustered by flowSOM to identify five clusters. The location of each cluster is
mapped onto the tSNE space depicted in panel A.

grey, cluster A2 cells in orange, and cluster A4 cells in green.
(G) Phenotypic features exhibited by cluster A2 and not A4. Cluster A2, whose contribution
among tetramer+ cells increased over the course of convalescence, expressed high
levels of the lymph node homing receptors CCR7 and CD62L, the checkpoint molecules
TIGIT and CTLA4, the co-stimulatory molecules CD28 and Ox40, and the pro-survival
factor BIRC5. Total CD8+ T cells are depicted in grey and cluster A2 cells in orange.

timepoints is likely mediated by activation-induced CCR7 downregulation. Similar to the
tetramer data (Fig. 3D), an increase in the contribution of the Tn/Tscm subset was
observed over time.
(D) Cytolytic Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells slowly decrease over the course of
convalescence. Left: Proportion of IFNg+ cells that were CD29+, granzymeB+CD107a+,
and granzymeB+perforin+. Right: Median expression levels of the indicated cytolytic
activity markers on the IFNg+ cells.
(E) Most Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells responding to peptide stimulation secrete multiple
cytokines. Dot plots showing the expression of IFNg and TNFa (left) or IFNg and IL6
(right) on CD8+ T cells among baseline or peptide-stimulated samples. Numbers
correspond to the percentage of cells within the gates. Results are gated on live, singlet
CD3+CD8+ cells. Most responding Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells were
IFNg+TNFa+IL6-.
(F) The proportion of IFNg+TNFa+IL6- CD8+ T cells responding to Nuc322-331 stimulation
decreases over the course of convalescence. The cell populations are taken from the
gates shown in panel E.
(G) The level of IFNg and TNFa produced by Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells decreases over
the course of convalescence, as shown by median signal intensity of the IFNg+TNFa+
cells.

to those responding to nucleocapsid than to spike peptides
(A) Cluster distribution of CD8+ T cells responding to Nuc322-331, or to peptides spanning the
entire nucleocapsid or spike proteins. IFNg+ CD8+ T cells from the Nuc322-331,

flowSOM. The responding cells are shown as dot plots and colored according to their
cluster membership. Note the higher similarity of cells in the tSNE among the Nuc322-331and Nuc-specific cells, relative to the spike-specific ones.
(B) Cluster B1 is dominant among CD8+ T cells with all three specificities, but more
prominent among the Nuc322-331- and Nuc-specific cells.
(C) Cluster B1 cells, to which most cells responding to Nuc322-331, Nuc, and Spike stimulation
CD8+ T cells belong, are characterized by high expression levels of the cytolytic markers
granzyme B and CD107a, and the cytokines IFNg and TNFa.
(D) The sub-populations of cluster B1 cells expressing higher levels of effector cytokines
and cytolytic molecules decrease over the course of convalescence. Shown are
histogram plots depicting cluster B1 cells colored according to timepoint. Although all the
cells shown belong to cluster B1, those from the later timepoints expressed lower levels
of granzyme B, CD107a, IFNg, and TNFa.

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure S1. Nuc322-331 of SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 variants-of-concern.
Nuc322-331 resides near the C-terminus of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, and its
sequence, MEVTPSGTWL, is 100% conserved in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B429/CAL20C
first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and California, respectively. It is also
100% conserved in SARS-CoV-1, but no orthologs are present in the common cold coronavirus
strains 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Shown are the location of the nucleocapsid gene within
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the location of the sequence encoding the peptide within the
nucleocapsid gene, and both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of corresponding to
Nuc322-331.

Figure S2. Expression levels of CyTOF antigens in Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells from
PID4103. The Nuc322-331-specific cells were identified either as unstimulated tetramer+ cells
(red) or as cells producing IFNg after peptide stimulation (green). For each antigen, the
histograms represent merges of the five timepoints analyzed in this study.

Figure S3. Expression levels of CyTOF antigens in Nuc322-331-specific CD8+ T cells from
PID4103 as a function of time.
Line graphs depict the antigens’ median staining intensities, as measured by CyTOF, among
the tetramer+ cells in the unstimulated sample (red), and the IFNg+ cells in the Nuc322-331stimulated samples (green), at the five timepoints analyzed in this study.

Figure S4. Approximately half of tetramer+ cells in Nuc322-331-stimulated samples do not
secrete IFNg or TNFa.
PBMCs from PID4103 were stimulated with Nuc322-331, stained with HLA-B*40:01/Nuc322-331
tetramers, and analyzed by CyTOF. A total of 54.1% of tetramer+ cells expressed neither IFNg
nor TNFa, suggesting that approximately half of tetramer+ cells are not identified using the
cytokine secretion assay.

Figure S5. Longitudinal assessment of the CD8+ and CD4+ T cells of PID4103 directed
against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins.
CD8+ (A) and CD4+ (B) T cells specifically responding to stimulation with overlapping peptides
spanning the entire nucleocapsid or spike proteins were identified by gating on the IFNg+ cells.
The cells were phenotyped by CyTOF at baseline, or following 4 hours of co-stimulation with

aCD49d/CD28 and either the nucleocapsid or spike peptides. Stimulations were conducted in
the presence of brefeldin A to enable detection of intracellular cytokines. Numbers correspond
