Abstract

COVID-19 is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and has
become a pandemic around the world. The illustration of the immune responses
against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed for understanding the pathogenesis of the
disease and its vaccine development. CD8+ T cells are critical for virus clearance and
induce long lasting protection in the host. Here we identified specific HLA-A2
restricted T cell epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Seven epitope peptides
(n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14) were confirmed to bind with HLA-A2 and potentially be
presented by antigen presenting cells to induce host immune responses. Tetramers
containing these peptides could interact with specific CD8+ T cells from convalescent
COVID-19 patients, and one dominant epitope (n-Sp1) was defined. In addition, these
epitopes could activate and generate epitope-specific T cells in vitro, and those
activated T cells showed cytotoxicity to target cells. Meanwhile, all these epitopes
exhibited high frequency of variations. Among them, n-Sp1 epitope variation 5L>F
significantly decreased the proportion of specific T cell activation; n-Sp1 epitope
8L>V variant showed significantly reduced binding to HLA-A2 and decreased the
proportion of n-Sp1-specific CD8+ T cell, which potentially contributes to the
immune escape of SAR-CoV-2.

Introduction:

COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic sweeping the world, which is caused by
SARS-CoV-2 infection (1). With no highly effective clinical treatment available for
COVID-19 so far, the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was considered relying on host
immune system, especially adaptive immunity (2). It has been demonstrated that both
T and B cell clones are highly expanded in the recovery phase of COVID-19 patients
(3). Besides the discovery of neutralizing antibodies (4), proliferation of CD8+ T cells
has been observed in the lungs of patients with mild COVID-19 (5). Although CD8+
T cell counts were dramatically reduced in severe COVID-19 cases, the revealed
antigen specific T cell responses indicated an effective role of CD8+ T cells (6-8).

T cell epitopes are the basis for the initiation of T cell mediated immune
responses. Thus, the identification of epitopes specific to SARS-CoV-2 and
illustration of the corresponding T cell responses are of great relevance to the
understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and vaccine development. Computational
analysis has been carried out to predict potential T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (9),
and T cell responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 have also been tested in convalescent
COVID-19 patients by using predicted peptide ‘megapools’ (8). Recently, multiple
specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been identified throughout SARS-CoV-2 ORFs
including spike protein (10). These epitopes were widely shared among SARS-CoV-2
isolates and located in regions of the virus that are not subject to mutational variation.
Therefore, the above epitope identification is beneficial to the development of

vaccines and medicines.

With the continuous epidemics worldwide, variations in virus strains have been
found in many countries. It’s reported recently that CD8+ T cell epitope variants in
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein led to persistently variable SARS-CoV-2 infection with
different susceptibility and severity (11). In view of the above phenomenon, we
analyzed the epitope variations of the spike protein among SARS-CoV-2 strains from
different geographic regions and evaluated the epitope characteristics of these
variations.

Results

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes

To narrow down the potential candidates of SARS-CoV-2 specific antigen
epitopes, we first predicted potential HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes of
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Coronavirus OC43, respectively. The
sequences of all the potential peptides were compared with Clustal Omega and 15
candidate peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 were selected (Table 1 and Table S1). To
validate these predicted epitopes, we first checked whether they could be presented by
HLA-A2 on the antigen presenting cells (APC). T2A2 is an APC with TAP deficiency,
whose peptide-MHC complex would be more stabilized if the epitopes bind suitably
(Figure S1A). Comparing to the well-known CD8+ T cell epitope GIL (GILGFVFTL)
from influenza A virus (IAV), most of the predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes showed

reasonable HLA-A2 binding (Figure 1A&B). We further checked the direct binding of
these epitopes to recombinant HLA-A2 molecules. In the UV exchange peptide-MHC
assay, peptides n-Sp1, n-Sp2, n-Sp9 and n-Sp10 exhibited strong binding to HLA-A2,
similar to IAV epitope GIL. However, n-Sp5 and s-Sp12 could not bind to HLA-A2,
while the remaining peptides showed moderate binding capability (Figure 1C).

We then prepared pMHC tetramers with all the peptides and tested whether they
could recognize antigen specific CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients.
Overall, 31 patients were enrolled and tested (Table 2). Compared to healthy donors,
the antigen specific CD8+ T cells were detected in convalescent patients with the
tetramers of n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14, but not others. Among them, n-Sp1 and
n-Sp7 based pMHC tetramers demonstrated the highest proportion of antigen specific
CD8+ T cells (Figure 1D&E).

To further analyze whether the epitope-bound T2A2 cells could activate T cells,
we tested the expression level of T cell activation marker CD69 and the proportion of
peptide-specific CD8+ T cells after stimulation with peptide-bound T2A2 cells
bearing peptides n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14. The results demonstrated that n-Sp1, 2
and 7 had the capability to activate CD8+ T cell. In particular, n-Sp1 induced the
strongest response (Figure 2). Firstly, the expression of CD69 increased significantly
under the stimulation of the peptide-bound T2A2 cells (Figure 2A-B). Secondly,
peptide-bound T2A2 cells stimulated T cell-mediated T2A2 killing, as the proportion
of T2A2 living cells was reduced (Figure 2C-D). Thirdly, peptide-bound T2A2 cells

stimulated T cell-mediated T2A2 apoptosis as the proportion of CFSE-Annexin V+
T2A2 cells was the highest (Figure 2E-F). And the expression of CD8+IFN-γ+
response was increased significantly under the stimulation of the peptide-bound T2A2
cells (Figure 2G-H). Finally, n-Sp1 based pMHC tetramers demonstrated the highest
proportion of antigen specific CD8+ T cells (Figure 2I-J).

Altogether, we therefore considered n-Sp1 to be one of the dominate CD8+ T
cell epitopes specific to SARS-CoV-2.

Analysis of Immune response in epitope variation of SARS-CoV-2

Phylogenetic analyses had indicated diverse variants of SARS-CoV-2 in global
circulation (12), and therefore we examined the extent to which the above epitopes
had been evolving in the 105,029 publicly available full-length SARS-CoV-2
sequences as of Sep 26th 2020. We observed high frequency of sequence variation
within these peptides, with n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14 bearing 20, 9, 13, 10, 12, 10
and 9 types of variations, respectively (Figure 3A). Among all the variations
discovered, 614D>G, 613Q>H in n-Sp6 and 5L>F in n-Sp1 were the top three most
frequently observed (Figure 3A).

To examine how these variations might affect epitope properties, we tested the
binding capability of mutated epitope peptides to HLA-A2 (Figure 3B-E). For n-Sp1,
the mutant FVFFVLVPLV (5L>F, n-Sp1-m1) showed no change in T2A2
stabilization, but mild decrease in pMHC binding capability. The other mutant

FVFLVLVPLV (8L>V, n-Sp1-m2), however, demonstrated a significant decrease in
pMHC binding capability. The dual mutant of 5L>F and 8L>V (n-Sp1-m3) further
confirmed the importance of L8 for the epitope properties of n-Sp1. Meanwhile, the
mutants of n-Sp2 showed various levels of decreased pMHC binding capability,
especially FQFCNYPFL (138D>Y, n-Sp2-m2). In addition, the n-Sp6 mutant resulted
in decreased pMHC binding capability, however, it showed similar T2A2 stabilization
ability to the wild type peptide (Figure 3C-E).

By using tetramers containing the mutated epitopes, no CD8+ T cells specific to
n-Sp1 mutation were detected in convalescent COVID-19 patients from Guangzhou,
China (Figure 3F-G). However, n-Sp1 mutants was able to increase the expression of
T cell activation marker CD69 (Figure 4A-B) and generate CD8+ T cells specific to
the mutants (Figure 4C-D), even though the proportion of CD8+ T cells specific to
mutation was less than that to wild type in the same host (Figure 4D). More
importantly, although n-Sp1-m1 could activate T cells, the wild type n-Sp1 tetramer
could not recognize antigen specific CD8+ T cells induced by n-Sp1 mutants (Figure
4E-F).

Overall, these results indicated that these emerged variations might have caused
a deficiency in the antigen presentation of the dominant epitopes, which was required
to rebuild a new CD8+ T cell immune response in COVID-19 patients.

Discussion

Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to
induce T cell responses mainly to spike protein (13). Our study identified HLA-A2
restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We first predicted 15
potential HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes. Among them, n-Sp11, n-Sp13 and
n-Sp15 have also been reported as SARS-CoV-specific epitopes and have been shown
to stimulate specific CTL responses (14, 15). In the study of Ferretti et al., memory
CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients could be activated by 29 epitope
peptides, among which only 3 peptides were in spike protein, including n-Sp3 (10). In
our study, n-Sp3 also showed a certain HLA-A2 binding capability, but it was much
lower than that of the dominate epitope n-Sp1. Although their ability to activate
memory CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients were not tested, our
results did show that mixed epitope-loaded antigen presentation cells could activate T
cells from healthy donors. Notably, the proportion of n-Sp1-specific T cells produced
by mixed epitope activation was even higher than that of the positive control
(Influenza A M1 peptide GILGFVFTL). Combining the results of HLA-A2 binding
capability, the proportion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in convalescent COVID-19
patients and the ability to activate T cell, we therefore proposed n-Sp1 as the dominate
CD8+ T cell epitope specific to SARS-CoV-2.

An artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC) system was used in this study,
providing a convenience protocol to validate T cell epitopes with no need of a high

biosafety level laboratory. T2A2 cell line was selected for our study with following
reasons. Firstly, its intrinsic deficiency in endogenous antigen presentation made it
more reliable to evaluate the presentation of exogenous epitope by HLA-A2, without
the interference of endogenous epitopes. Secondly, it demonstrated an excellent
capability to stimulate CD8+ T cells, with the high proportion of antigen specific
CD8+ T cells generated upon the primary immune challenge. Thirdly, it could also be
a target cell for cytotoxic assay after labelled with given epitope. Altogether, it is an
ideal model to identify T cell epitopes for novel antigen protein, especially for the low
biosafety level laboratories. By using this cell model, we demonstrated that the novel
epitopes from spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 had the capability to initiate CD8+ T cell
response, even in the unexposed donors. These epitopes might be candidates for
vaccine development in future.

Since the virus variants have been emerging geographically around the world
(Figure S2 and Table S2), especially the ongoing mutation of these epitopes, it is
critical to explore how the variations could affect the transmissibility and
pathogenicity of the virus. Among all the variations reported so far, 614D>G and
613Q>H in n-Sp6, and 5L>F in n-Sp1 were the three most frequently observed
(Figure 3A). However, n-Sp6 showed a low proportion of antigen-specific T cells in
convalescent COVID-19 patients and a lack of T cell activation ability (Figure 3,
Figure S3), so it’s not considered as the dominate CD8+ T cell epitope. Although
614D>G replacement has been reported as the dominant pandemic form in an
epidemiological analysis (16), the G614 peptide mediated T cell activation was not

significantly altered compared to D614 peptide. The possible explanation for this
phenomenon is that G614 has a stronger binding ability with Angiotensin-converting
Enzyme 2 (ACE2) (17) but it’s not involved in the induction of T cell immune
responses. Our result was also in accordance with the report that although G614
variant showed higher viral loads in patients, it didn’t increase disease severity (18).

Although the n-Sp1 5L>F mutant could induce T cell activation, its specific T
cells were undetectable in the convalescent COVID-19 patients. The possible reason
was that the patients tested here were infected with wild type virus strain during the
early stage of the epidemic, and the rebuild of a new CD8 + T cell immune response
to the 5L>F mutant was needed. In addition, n-Sp1 8L>V mutation not only
significantly reduced its binding to HLA-A2, but also showed a decreased proportion
of n-Sp1-specific CD8+ T cell, which might contribute to the immune escape of
SAR-CoV-2.

Taken together, our data indicated that the variation of a dominant epitope might
cause the deficiency in antigen presentation, which subsequently required the rebuild
of a new CD8+ T cell immune response in COVID-19 patients.

Materials and Methods
Human subject enrollment
The Institutional Review Board of the Affiliated Huaqiao Hospital of Jinan University
approved this study. Unexposed donors were healthy individuals enrolled in
Guangzhou Blood Center and confirmed with a negative report for SARS-CoV-2
RNA RT-PCR assay. These donors had no known history of any significant systemic
diseases, including, but not limited to, hepatitis B or C, HIV, diabetes, kidney or liver
diseases, malignant tumors, or autoimmune diseases. Convalescent donors included
subjects who were hospitalized for COVID-19 or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
with RNA RT-PCR assay (Table 2). All subjects provided informed consent at the
time of enrollment that their samples could be used for this study. Complete blood
samples were collected in acid citrate dextrose tubes and stored at room temperature
prior to PBMC isolation and plasma collection.
HLA-A2 restricted T cell epitope prediction

The spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (NC_045512.2),
SARS-CoV GD01 strain (AY278489.2), MERS-CoV Riyadh_1_2012 strain
(KF600612.1) and human coronavirus OC43 strain (KF530099.1) were used for T cell
epitope prediction with the “MHC I Binding” tool (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci). The
prediction method used was IEDB Recommended 2.22 (NetMHCpan EL), with MHC
allele selected as HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*02:06, the most frequent class I HLA
genotype among Chinese population (19, 20). The spike protein sequences of all four

virus strains were aligned with Clustal Omega with SARS-CoV-2 as reference, and
potential peptide candidates specific to SARS-CoV-2 were selected for further
validation.

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variations

All available SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequences of spike protein were collected
from GISAID database (GISAID.org). The sequences of each epitope were extracted
for further analysis with Microsoft Office Excel 2010 and Graphic Prism (Version 7).
Peptide screening with T2A2 cells
All peptides were synthesized in Genscript Biotech Co., Ltd (Nanjing). T2A2 cells
were seeded into 96-well plates, and then incubated with peptides at 0µM, 0.625µM,
1.25µM, 2.5µM, 5µM, 10µM and 20µM at 37 °C for 4 hours. Set DMSO as blank
control, Influenza A M1 peptide (GILGFVFTL) as positive control, and Zika virus
peptide (GLQRLGYVL) as negative control. Cells were stained with FITC
anti-human HLA-A2 antibody at 4 °C in the dark for 30 min, and acquired in flow
cytometer FACS Canto (BD).
Expression and purification HLA-A2 protein
The HLA-A2 heavy chain and β2-Microglobulin genes were cloned into the pTXBI
vector through SpeI and NdeI restriction sites. Both constructs were confirmed by
DNA sequencing (Shanghai Sangon Biotech, Co., Ltd). Under a heat shock at 42 °C,
the constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21, and single colonies were picked
and cultured in 2mL LB broth containing 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C and 370 rpm

for 16 hours. The culture was subsequently expanded to 400mL and induced with
0.1mM IPTG at 24 °C for 4 hours. The cells were harvested and lysed, followed with
50 min sonication on ice. The lysate was collected into chitin resin balanced with
Column Buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH8.5, 0.5M NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05%Tween20) at
a low flow rate (0.5mL/min). After 15 column volume washing, on-column cleavage
was conducted by quickly washing the column with 3 column volumes of the
Cleavage Buffer (Column Buffer supplemented with 50 mM DTT). The column was
incubated at 4 °C for 36 hours and the target protein was eluted using 3 column
volumes of Column Buffer. Purified heavy chain portion was incubated with 50mM
biotin (Thermo Fisher, Cat#B20656) at 4-8 °C overnight for biotinylation. Samples of
every step were collected for SDS-PAGE analysis.
Preparation of Peptide-HLA-A2 monomer
UV-sensitive peptide-HLA-A2 monomer was refolded in refolding buffer (100mM
Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 5M urea, 0.4M arginine HCl, 3.7mM cysteamine, 6.3mM cysteamine,
and 2mM EDTA) at 4 °C. In brief, 500µL of 20mM UV-sensitive peptide
VPLRPM’J’Y (J represents Fmoc-(S)-3-amino-3-(2-nitrophenyl) propionic acid) and
30 mg of β2-Microglobulin were added to the refolding mixture via syringe. Next, 10
mg HLA-A2 heavy chain protein was added to the refolding mixture via syringe
every 8 hours with 3 injections and 30 mg protein in total, and let the mixture spin in
the refrigerator for 15 hours. The refolding mixture was then dialyzed against 20mM
Tris (pH 8.0) for 36 hours, changing buffer about every 12 hours. Finally, the mixture
was filtered and purified using weak anion exchange resin (DEAE cellulose, Santa

(Superdex 75pg, GE Healthcare). Samples of every step were collected for
SDS-PAGE analysis.
HLA-A2 ELISA
96-well U-bottomed plates were coated with 100µL of 0.5µg/mL streptavidin
(BioLegend Cat#270302) at room temperature (18-25°C) for 16-18 hours, washed for
3 times with Washing Buffer (BioLegend Cat#421601) and blocked with Dilution
Buffer (0.5M Tris pH 8.0, 1M NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20) at room temperature
for 30 min. Samples were prepared by 300-fold dilution in Dilution Buffer and kept
on ice until usage. Set DMSO as blank control, Influenza A M1 peptide (GILGFVFTL)
as positive control, and Zika virus peptide (GLQRLGYVL) as negative control. 100
µL of samples were added in duplicate and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. After
washing three times with Washing Buffer, 100µL of diluted HRP-conjugated
antibodies (BioLegend Cat#280303) were added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C,
then washed thoroughly. 100 µL of substrate solution (10.34 mL DI Water, 1.2mL
0.1M citric acid monohydrate/tri-Sodium citrate dihydrate, pH 4.0, 240µL 40mM
ABTS, 120µL hydrogen peroxide solution) was added and incubated for 8 min at
room temperature in the dark on a plate shaker at 400-500 rpm. The reaction was
stopped with 50µL of Stop Solution (2% w/v oxalic acid dihydrate) and absorbance at
414 nm was read using a plate reader.

20µL 200µg/mL UV-sensitive peptide-HLA-A2 monomer were added into 96-well
plates and mixed well by pipetting up and down. The plates were sealed, spun down
at 4 °C, and exposed to UV light for 30 min on ice. The plates were then incubated for
30 min at 37 °C in the dark. 30µl of peptide-exchanged monomer and 3.3µl of
PE-streptavidin (BioLegend Cat#405203) were mixed in a new plate, and incubate on
ice in the dark for 30min. After the incubation, 2.4µL blocking solution (1.6µL 50mM
biotin and 198.4µL PBS) to stop the reaction.
Staining of cell-surface CD8 and tetramer
PBMC were isolated from peripheral venous blood of healthy donors and
convalescent COVID-19 patients. The HLA-A2+ donors were identified by using
flow cytometry. Briefly, 106 PBMC were stained with FITC anti-human HLA-A2
antibody at 4 °C in the dark for 30 min, and acquired by using flow cytometer.
HLA-A2 positive PBMC samples were further stained with PE labelled tetramer
（home-made）and APC labelled human CD8+ antibody (BioLegend Cat#344721),
and acquired with flow cytometer FACS Canto (BD).
T cell activation

HLA-A2 expressing T2A2 cells were loaded with peptides for subsequent T cell
activation. Briefly, T2A2 cells were pretreated with mitomycin for 30 min to stop cell
proliferation, and incubated with given epitope peptides for 4 hours for peptide
loading. 0.5x106 CD8+ T cells from health donors were co-cultured with 0.5x106
mixed peptide-loaded T2A2 cells stained with CFSE, and stimulated with 1µg/mL

anti-human CD28 antibodies (BioLegend Cat#302901) and 50 IU/mL IL-2 (SL
PHARM, Recombinant Human Interleukin-2(125Ala) Injection). 50 IU/mL IL-2 and
20µM peptides (n-Sp1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 14) were supplemented every two days. The
T cell activation marker CD69 (BioLegend Cat#310909), tetramer specific CD8+ T
cells proportion and apoptosis marker Annexin V-APC (BioLegend Cat#640919) on
T2A2 cells were evaluated after 16 hours and 7 days, respectively. On day 7, cells
were re-stimulated with peptides for 6 hours in the presence of GolgiPlug and
GolgiStop (BD Cat#550583) plus 50 IU/mL IL-2, and the production of IFN-γ was
checked with anti-IFN-γ-PE (BioLegend Cat#506507) staining.
Statistical analysis

Graphic Prism 7 software was used for statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA was
performed for group analysis. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.
