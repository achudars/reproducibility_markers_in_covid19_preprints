Summary:

38

Understanding protective mechanisms of antibody recognition can inform vaccine and therapeutic

39

strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We discovered a new antibody, 910-30, that targets the SARS-

40

CoV-2 ACE2 receptor binding site as a member of a public antibody response encoded by IGHV3-

41

53/IGHV3-66 genes. We performed sequence and structural analyses to explore how antibody

42

features correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Cryo-EM structures of 910-30 bound to the

43

SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer revealed its binding interactions and ability to disassemble spike.

44

Despite heavy chain sequence similarity, biophysical analyses of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies

45

highlighted the importance of native heavy:light pairings for ACE2 binding competition and for

46

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. We defined paired heavy:light sequence signatures and determined

47

antibody precursor prevalence to be ~1 in 44,000 human B cells, consistent with public antibody

48

identification in several convalescent COVID-19 patients. These data reveal key structural and

49

functional neutralization features in the IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibody class to accelerate

50

antibody-based medical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

67

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 into human populations, causing coronavirus disease

68

2019 (COVID-19) with complications including respiratory and cardiac failure in severe cases

69

(Gorbalenya and et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a; Zhu et al.,

70

2020). The highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, significant prevalence of severe disease, and

71

widespread transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals has led to immense

72

global, social, and economic disruption (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020; Liu et al., 2020b). SARS-

73

CoV-2 marks the third known emergence of a novel beta-coronavirus in the past two decades,

74

following its closest documented human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome

75

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, and the next closest, Middle East respiratory syndrome

76

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (Cui et al., 2019; Gorbalenya and et al., 2020; Graham and

77

Baric, 2010; Ksiazek et al., 2003; de Wit et al., 2016; Zaki et al., 2012). Both SARS and SARS-

78

CoV-2 infect human cells by binding to the angiotensin convertase II receptor (ACE2) via the

79

trimeric spike (S) class I fusion protein (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020a). The S protein

80

comprises two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor binding domain (RBD),

81

which binds to ACE2. To enter cells, S must undergo a protease cleavage event that allows S1

82

to shed and expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide of the S2 subunit. SARS coronavirus

83

predominantly enters cells via endosomes, assisted by cathepsin cleavage in the low pH (5.5-

84

4.5) endosomal environment. SARS-CoV-2 acquired a new protease cleavage site that enables

85

entry either at the cell surface after cleavage with TMPRSS2, or inside endosomes via protease

86

cleavage similar to SARS, and the route of SARS-CoV-2 entry is likely dependent on the protease

87

expression profile in target cells (Ou et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). ACE2 interactions appear to

88

play a role in the pre-fusion shedding of S1 (Benton et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020).

89

A detailed understanding of SARS-CoV-2 molecular vulnerabilities to antibody neutralization

90

can accelerate progress in medical interventions such as antibody drug therapies and vaccines.

91

Antibodies from several COVID-19 patients have revealed the presence of public antibody

92

responses that target SARS-CoV-2 via shared genetic elements and structural recognition modes

93

in the IGHV3-53 and IGHV3-66 heavy chain V-genes. Members of this public antibody class target

94

a conserved epitope on RBD on the S1 subunit that overlaps with the ACE2 binding site (Barnes

95

et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Hansen et

96

al., 2020; Hurlburt et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Rogers et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Shi et

97

al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Yuan et al., 2020a). IGHV3-53/3-66 public class antibodies share

98

common genetic features including IGHV-gene-encoded motifs NY in the CDR-H1, SGGS in the

99

CDR-H2, a relatively short CDR-H3 length, and comparatively low levels of antibody somatic

100

hypermutation (Barnes et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Yuan et al., 2020a).

101

Preliminary analysis of class light chain features show the inclusion of both kappa and lambda

102

light chains in antibodies of this class (Catalan-Dibene, 2020; Du et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a;

103

Wrapp et al., 2020b; Wu et al., 2020b, 2020b; Yuan et al., 2020a). Despite strong similarities in

104

heavy chain gene signatures, IGHV3-53/3-66 anti-RBD antibodies show a broad range of

105

neutralization potencies (IC50’s from 0.003 to 2.547 μg/mL), (Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al.,

106

2020; Ju et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020;

107

Wu et al., 2020b; Yuan et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020). Given the low somatic hypermutation

108

observed and the importance of germline-encoded recognition motifs, it remains unclear what

109

unique molecular features lead to the diverse range of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization potencies

110

among IGHV3-53/3-66 class members.

111

SARS-CoV-2 S displays a pH-dependent conformational switch that causes the ‘up’ position

112

of the RBD to rotate to a ‘down’ position (Walls et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020c). The RBD ‘up’

113

position is required for ACE2 engagement, as well as antibody binding for the IGHV3-53/3-66

114

class (Du et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b). A mutational variant recently

115

emerged that influences the RBD “up” vs. “down” state (D614G) that now constitutes >97% of

116

isolates world-wide (Korber et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al.,

117

2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The D614G mutation is proximal to the RBD in the spike structure, and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.31.424987; this version posted January 3, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

118

D614G appears to favor more RBD ‘up’ at both serological and endosomal pH (Grubaugh et al.,

119

2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020c). The D614G substitution enhances viral

120

infectivity, competitive fitness, and transmission, and may have important implications for

121

antibody-based and vaccine interventions (Hou et al., 2020; Mansbach et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy

122

et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020); further investigations into the effects of D614G on IGHV3-53/3-

123

66 class recognition and neutralization are required (Grubaugh et al., 2020).

124

Here we discovered a new member of the IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody class, mAb 910-30, with

125

moderate neutralization capacity. To better understand the features of potent IGHV3-53/3-66

126

class neutralization, we explored molecular and genetic features of 910-30 and other related

127

antibodies, including heavy and light chain structural recognition motifs, biophysical correlates of

128

neutralization, and the influence of D614 vs. D614G variants on IGHV3-53/3-66 class member

129

interactions. Our study provides a detailed molecular understanding of how the public IGHV3-

130

53/3-66 class leverages native heavy and light chain binding contributions against SARS-CoV-2,

131

providing important data to accelerate medical interventions against SARS-CoV-2’s vulnerable

132

RBD epitope.

Results

135
136

Isolation and structural characterization of a novel neutralizing class member

137

We screened the immune repertoire of a COVID-19 convalescent patient, Donor 910 (To et

138

al., 2020) treated at Hong Kong University, to identify a new member of the public IGHV3-53/3-

139

66 antibody class. ELISA assays of Donor 910 serum showed potent S trimer recognition, and

140

pseudovirus neutralization assays confirmed that Donor 910 serum showed high SARS-CoV-2

141

neutralization titers (Fig. S1) (Wang et al., 2020b). Based on these data, Donor 910

142

cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were selected for analysis using a

143

recently described method to clone natively paired heavy and light chain antibody genes into

144

yeast Fab display for functional screening (Wang et al., 2018). Yeast antibody display libraries

145

were screened for binding against two different SARS-CoV-2 S protein probes, a His-labeled S-

146

Trimer and a biotinylated S-Trimer, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. S1).

147

Bioinformatic interrogation of yeast display NGS data revealed that one monoclonal antibody

148

(mAb 910-30) enriched 90-fold in the round 2 sorted library against Biotin-22 S protein, and 2,296-

149

fold in round 3 sorted libraries against His-labeled S protein. Based on these strong enrichment

150

signals, mAb 910-30 was expressed as IgG in HEK293 cells for neutralization assays. 910-30

151

showed a half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) against a VSV SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

152

(Liu et al., 2020a) of 0.071 μg/mL, and 0.142 μg/mL against authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1A)

153

shown in comparison to the previously reported mAb CR3022 (Huo et al., 2020; Ter Meulen et

154

al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2020b).

155

Next we characterized 910-30 structural recognition by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

156

Negative-staining electron microscopy revealed particles of 910-30 Fab bound to SARS-CoV-2

157

S2P at pH 5.5 (Fig. 1B) (Zhou et al., 2020c), and also across a broader pH range of 4.0-7.4 (Fig.

158

S1). Subsequent Cryo-EM mapping and molecular modeling of 910-30 Fab in complex with

159

SARS-CoV-2 S2P protein at pH 5.5 showed 1 Fab bound to 1 RBD in the up position when mixing

160

Fab and spike in a 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 1C, Fig. S2, Supplemental Table 1), whereas a 9:1

161

Fab:spike molar ratio revealed mostly disordered spike (Fig. 1D, Fig. S2, Supplemental Table

162

1), with an RBD that still fit the Cryo-EM map consistent with Figure 1C. Structural modeling of

163

ACE2 (PDB entry 6M0J) and 910-30 (PDB entry 7KS9) in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD

164

confirmed targeting of the ACE2 binding site (Fig. 1E). Analysis of soluble 910-30 IgG recognition

165

of yeast-displayed aglycosylated N343Q RBD(333-537) confirmed that 910-30 recognizes a

166

glycan-independent region (Fig. S3A) (Starr et al., 2020). Antibody titrations showed a 910-30

167

IgG KD to RBD of 230 pM (191 - 268 pM 95% confidence interval) (Fig. S3B), and that 910-30

168

competes with human ACE2 (hACE2) for binding to RBD, consistent with IGHV3-53/3-66 class

169

membership (Fig. S3C).

170
171

Potent antibodies of the IGHV3-53/3-66 class compete strongly with ACE2 for binding to

172

spike

173

Structural analysis of IGHV3-53/3-66 germline-encoded antibody recognition shows

174

substantial overlap between the ACE2 binding site and the shared class epitope footprint (Fig.

175

2A) (Barnes et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a;

176

Shi et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b). Despite low reported somatic hypermutation

177

and shared epitope targets, reported IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody class members show a broad range

178

of neutralization potencies (Fig. 2B, Supplemental Table 2). To better understand molecular

179

features of potent antibody neutralization for this class, we assessed biophysical performance of

180

a small panel of weak, moderate, and potent IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibody class members. We

181

selected the antibodies 1-20 (a potent neutralizer), the new 910-30 (a moderate neutralizer), and

182

B38 (a weak neutralizer), along with a VH-gene matched control (mAb 4-3) that neutralizes poorly

183

and likely targets a different site on RBD (Supplemental Table 3) (Wu et al., 2020a; Zhou et al.,

184

2020a). Preliminary IgG ELISA analysis revealed that class members show similar binding to

185

RBD, whereas the more potent class members (1-20, 910-30) bound more tightly to full-length

186

spike (Fig. 2C). Pseudovirus & authentic virus neutralization show a range of two orders of

187

magnitude in IC50 neutralization potencies for the selected panel (Fig. 2D), confirming that

188

antibody neutralization within the class is driven by more complex parameters than simple

189

recognition of the ACE2 binding site on RBD.

190

Next we assessed the ability of potent and weak neutralizers to compete with dimerized

191

human ACE2 (dhACE2) for binding to spike (S2P). In a competition ELISA using antibody pre-

192

mixed with serial dilutions of dhACE2, we found that more potently neutralizing class members

193

competed more strongly with dhACE2 compared to less potent Abs (Fig. 2E). The most potent

194

mAb (1-20) required 73 dhACE2 molecules for 50% binding inhibition of 1 IgG molecule. 1-20

195

was 6-fold more competitive with dhACE2 than the moderate neutralizer 910-30 (dhACE2 molar

196

excess IC50 = 12), and 150-fold more competitive than the weak neutralizer B38 (dhACE2 molar

197

excess IC50 = 0.48 ). Sequence analysis revealed high similarity with low levels of somatic

198

hypermutation, as previously reported for the IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody class (Fig. 2F) (Hurlburt et

199

al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020a). Given the broad variations in functional potency despite high

200

sequence similarity, we next sought to understand the key contributions in heavy and light chain

201

sequence signatures that lead to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

202
203

Unique heavy and light chain interactions drive potent neutralization for the IGHV3-53/3-

204

66 neutralizing antibody class

205

IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies show diverse light chain usage, with the

206

two defining heavy chain genes (IGHV3-53 and IGHV3-66) pairing with at least 14 other light

207

chain genes (Supplemental Table 2). To help understand the influence of light chain pairings,

208

we constructed a panel of 12 non-native heavy:light swapped antibody variants from four IGHV3-

209

53/3-66-encoded mAbs (1-20, 910-30, B38, and 4-3 included as an IGHV gene control). 11/12

210

non-native antibodies expressed successfully and were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

211

neutralization. Heavy:light swap data revealed a substantial loss in neutralization for nearly all

212

non-native heavy:light combinations, with only the most potent antibody heavy chain (1-20)

213

achieving significant neutralization with a non-native light chain (Fig. 3A). More potent

214

neutralization of non-native heavy:light combinations was also correlated with strong dhACE2

215

competition (Fig. 3B), consistent with the natively paired heavy:light dhACE2 competition ELISA

216

data (Fig. 2E). As all four heavy chain genes have low somatic hypermutation & high sequence

217

similarity, we had not anticipated widespread loss of performance when swapping light chains

218

among class members (Fig. 2F, Supplemental Table 3). In contrast, Figure 3A shows that native

219

light chains make substantial contributions to neutralization performance, and that non-native

220

heavy and light chain pairings show reduced antibody performance, despite the high degree of

221

sequence similarity among heavy chains.

222

To better understand the paired heavy and light chain determinants of antibody recognition,

223

we performed a structure-based alignment to analyze residue interactions and identify possible

224

light chain signatures of class membership (Lefranc et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2013). We followed

225

numerous anti-RBD IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody lineages paired with different light chain V genes

226

including: KV1-33, KV1-9, KV1-39, KV3-20, and LV2-8 (Barnes et al., 2020; Hurlburt et al., 2020;

227

Shi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Yuan et al., 2020a). Structural analyses of antibody contact

228

sites revealed that conserved residues in both VH and VL genes contributed 56-75% of binding

229

surface area (BSA) (Fig. 3C and Fig. S3D). We confirmed alignments with previously defined

230

signatures as a control (Fig. S3D). Supplemental Figure 3D shows the IGHV3-53/3-66 heavy

231

chain projected surface with its germline encoded amino acids, including the interaction residues

232

31

233

multiple hydrogen bonds interactions with Thr415, Gly416, Lys417, Asp420, Tyr421, Leu455,

234

Tyr473, Ala475, and Asn487 in the RBD. We verified previous reports that these class sequences

235

have shorter CDR-H3 lengths of 6-11 amino acids (Fig. S3D), and we also note that those CDR-

236

H1 and CDR-H2 motifs are only present in IGHV3-53/3-66 genes. Sequence-structure alignments

237

also revealed that kappa chain class members use a conserved [DGS]xSx{1,2}[FY] motif of 11 or

SNY on CDR-H1 and

52

YSGxSxY, where x indicates any residue, on CDR-H2 that provide

12 amino acids starting at residue 27a or 28 in the CDR-L1 to form hydrogen bonds with RBD

239

residues Gln498 and Asn501 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, lambda chain binding in the class uses a

240

different

241

Gly502 and Tyr505 (Fig. 3C). Thus we defined here the 27a/28[DGS]xSx{1,2}[FY] motif of 11 or 12

242

amino acids in the CDR-L1 as a signature of kappa chain class members, and the 29GY[KN] motif

243

on 14 amino acids CDR-L1 as a signature of lambda class members. We did not observe a

244

conserved binding motif in the CDR-L3 that contacts RBD, and we also note that the CDR-L1

245

motifs defined here can be encoded by multiple light chain genes (Fig. 3C, Table S4).

GY[KN] motif with 14 amino acids in the CDR-L1 that interacts with RBD residues

246

Structural comparison of eight IGHV3-53/3-66 class members shows that Fab variable

247

domains bind RBD with the same orientation, reflecting a conserved heavy chain recognition

248

mode and defining the relevant conserved light chain residues for heavy:light pairing (Fig. 3D).

249

Structural alignment also reveals a strongly conserved hydrogen bond network responsible for

250

RBD recognition by CDR-H1. The backbone carbonyl group of Gly26HC interacts with the amide

251

group of Asn487; the backbone CO group of Ser31HC contacts the hydroxyl group of Tyr473; the

252

side chain amide group of Asn32HC contacts the carbonyl group of Ala475; and the hydroxyl group

253

of Tyr33HC acts as hydrogen bond donor to Leu455 backbone CO group within CDR-H1. In the

254

context of CDR-H2, the hydroxyl group of Ser53HC targets both the backbone CO group of R457

255

and the hydroxyl group of Tyr421, the latter being involved in a hydrogen bond with the NH group

256

of Gly54HC as well; and the hydroxyl group of Ser56HC interacts with the carboxyl group of Asp420.

257

Overall, CDR-H2 interactions are less conserved among IGHV3-53/3-66 members compared to

258

CDR-H1 interactions: the hydrogen bond between Tyr52HC hydroxyl group and Lys417 amine

259

group is observed only in B38 and CV30, while the hydroxyl group of Thr415 and the NH group

260

of Gly416 are targeted by the hydroxyl group of Tyr/Phe58HC only in B38, CV30 and 910-30.

261

Structural comparison of light chain residues shows a strongly conserved tyrosine residue

262

(Tyr32LC) in the CDR-L1 at the heavy:light chain interface which provides a stabilizing hydrophobic

263

environment to the aromatic ring of Tyr505, together with Val28/29LC (in CV30, CC12.3, COVA2-

265

910-30 Ser30LC interacts with the side chains of Gln498 and Asn501.

266

Using these defined sequence and structural motifs, we used published antibody repertoire

267

data to estimate the prevalence of antibody class precursors in healthy human immune

268

repertoires (Bräuninger et al., 2001; Sethna et al., 2019; Soto et al., 2019). Antibody lineages with

269

anti-SARS-CoV-2 IGHV3-53/3-66 class characteristics were identified in approximately 1 in

270

44,000 reported human antibody sequences (Fig. 3E) (Soto et al., 2019), which we found to be a

271

high frequency in comparison to previously studied anti-HIV-1 VRC01-class antibody precursors

272

that occur in approximately 1 in 1-4 million human antibodies (Zhou et al., 2013). These

273

comparatively high frequency estimates of IGHV3-53/3-66 anti-RBD precursors in human

274

immune responses support the recovery of antibodies from this class in multiple convalescent

275

COVID-19 patients.

RBD up/down conformation influences S protein recognition for the IGHV3-53/3-66

278

antibody class

279

The RBD ‘up’ position is required for ACE2 engagement, as well as IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody

280

binding (Du et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b). Cryo-EM structural analysis at

281

endosomal pH has revealed a pH-mediated conformational switch that rotates RBD domains

282

down at pH 5.5-4.5 (Zhou et al., 2020b). Because the recently emerged D614G mutation also

283

alters the RBD ‘up’ vs. ‘down’ dynamics, we sought to understand how D614/D614G and pH-

284

based alteration of ‘up’ vs. ‘down’ prevalence influence IGHV3-53/3-66 class recognition of spike

285

(Walls et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). We investigated class binding at three pH values related

286

to known RBD ‘up’ versus ‘down’ states for the D614 and D614G mutational variants (Fig. 4A)

287

(Benton et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,

288

289

members compete in a concentration-dependent manner with dimeric human ACE2 for binding

290

to SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike, and to the D614G S2P spike (Fig. 4B, Supplemental Fig. 3). Using

291

single-cycle surface plasmon resonance, we found that the extremely potent mAb 1-20

292

recognized S protein and RBD with no loss in affinity at endosomal pH, whereas the less potent

293

antibodies 910-30 and B38 showed reduced affinity in the endosomal pH range (Fig. 4C,

294

Supplemental Fig. 4). We compared authentic virus neutralization IC50 potencies (from Fig. 2D)

295

to the ratio of mAb-Spike affinity (Supplemental Fig. 4) divided by reported dhACE2-Spike affinity

296

(Zhou et al., 2020b), which suggested that potent mAb neutralization was correlated with mAb

297

affinity across all pH values tested (Fig. 4D). Finally, a qualitative Octet pH series analysis using

298

D614 S2P spike showed that as the pH reduces (and RBDs preferentially rotate down), the potent

299

neutralizer mAb 1-20 exhibited strong recognition of D614 S2P spike for pH³6.0, whereas 910-

300

30 showed reduced binding below pH=6.5, and the least potent B38 binding showed reduced

301

binding below pH=7.0 (Fig. 2E, left panel). In contrast, all class members maintained strong

302

binding to mutant D614G S2P spike into the endosomal pH range (where one RBD likely remains

303

up), and the potent antibody class member 1-20 recognized D614G spike down to pH 4.0 (Fig.

304

2E, right panel). These data suggested that the most potent antibodies can maintain the bound

305

state (and stabilize the RBD-up conformation) more effectively under endosomal pH conditions

306

for D614 S2P spike, whereas all antibody class members could effectively recognize the native

307

RBD-up conformation for D614G across a broad pH range. Our data support ACE2 competition

308

as a functional signature of IGHV3-53/3-66 public antibody class neutralization, and we show that

309

the RBD-up vs. RBD-down conformation substantially influenced the ability of IGHV3-53/3-66

310

class antibodies to recognize spike trimer.

Discussion

312

Enhanced understanding of IGHV3-53/3-66 class-based spike recognition can provide

313

insight into immune monitoring, antibody discovery, and vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2.

314

Structural analysis of a novel class member mAb 910-30 revealed previously undescribed spike

315

disassembly at high occupancy, and our antibody class comparative studies showed that native

316

heavy:light pairing remains essential for potent neutralization, despite high similarities in heavy

317

chain sequences. Comparative sequence-structure analyses enabled the identification of

318

conserved light chain class signatures, defined as 27a/28[GDS]xSx{1,2}[FY] (kappa) and 29GY[KN]

319

(lambda) residues in CDR-L1 that make key contributions to RBD recognition. We also note that

320

class member light chains use common aromatic/hydrophobic residues

321

30/32

322

ACE2 and IGHV3-53/3-66 class binding epitope. These shared light chain features illuminate the

323

structural rationale for broader light chain diversity among IGHV3-53/3-66 class members.

28

Val,

Ile/Val, or

505

Tyr in the RBD, which is part of the shared

324

The frequency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IGHV3-53/3-66 precursor antibodies in healthy donors

325

(around 1 in 44,000) was more common than the previously studied anti-HIV-1 VRC01-class

326

antibody precursors observed in 1 per 1-4 million antibodies (Zhou et al., 2013). In addition, it has

327

been shown that anti-HIV-1 VRC01-class antibodies also require much higher levels of somatic

328

hypermutation (SHM) to achieve potent neutralization (Zhou et al., 2013). The comparably limited

329

SHM required for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IGHV3-53/3-66 class antibodies appears to be a feature of

330

IGHV germline gene neutralizing interactions and the need to recognize highly conserved viral

331

variants, as compared to HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies that must recognize broadly

332

diverse viral variants and show limited germline gene neutralization. These findings help explain

333

the observed reproducibility of public IGHV3-53/3-66 anti-RBD antibodies in convalescent

334

COVID-19 patients.

335

D614G S2P spike variant shows a greater prevalence of RBD-up than D614G, which may

336

enhance spike and the ACE2 host receptor recognition to confer higher D614G viral infectivity

337

(Hou et al., 2020; Mansbach et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).

338

Conversely, a sustained RBD ‘up’ also could make the virus more sensitive to neutralization, as

339

the exposed ‘up’ RBD enhances exposure of vulnerable epitopes (Mansbach et al., 2020; Zhou

340

et al., 2020c). We outlined differences in RBD display caused by the D614G mutation that

341

enhance antibody class recognition of spike across a broad pH range, and we show that D614G

342

had no detrimental impact on IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody class neutralization, which agrees with

343

prior reports (Plante et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020; Weissman et al., 2020). Interestingly,

344

only the most potent antibodies could bind to the D614 variant at endosomal pH which

345

demonstrated that high-affinity antibody recognition can prevent D614 RBD from rotating down at

346

pH 5.5-4.5. These data imply that screening for antibody recognition of D614 S2P at endosomal

347

pH could be an effective method to identify potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and other studies

348

have reported potent antibodies that recognize S trimer even in the context of RBD down

349

conformations (Tortorici et al., 2020). We also found that ACE2 competition at pH 7.4 was

350

correlated with potent antibody protection, consistent with the known cell surface attachment to

351

ACE2 at serological pH.

352

In summary, here we report the discovery of a new public IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody class

353

member and outlined the unique heavy and light chain interactions that lead to potent immune

354

recognition of both D614G and D614G spike variants. These data enhance our understanding of

355

the public IGHV3-53/3-66 antibody class and highlight its convergent neutralization features to

356

accelerate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody mapping and inform future efforts to identify and elicit

357

neutralizing antibody responses against COVID-19.

METHOD DETAILS

566
567

Human Sample Collection

568

Informed consent was obtained for all study participants under IRB-AAAS9010 (Hong Kong

569

University). Donor 910 (To et al., 2020) serum was collected for ELISA and neutralization assays,

570

and PBMCs were cryopreserved for subsequent B cell receptor gene capture and antibody

571

screening.

572
573

Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV-2 Antigens

574

The antigen probes used for sorting yeast surface displayed libraries were prepared as

575

previously described (Liu et al., 2020a). Briefly, expression vectors encoding the ectodomain of

576

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was transiently transfected into Expi293 cells and then purified five

577

days post transfection using on-column purification methods.

578
579

Production of SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus

580

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was generated using recombinant Indiana vesicular stomatitis

581

virus (rVSV) as previously described (Han et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Nie et al., 2020; Whitt,

582

2010). HEK293T cells were grown to 80% confluency then used for transfection of pCMV3-SARS-

583

CoV-2-spike (kindly provided by Dr. Peihui Wang, Shandong University, China) using FuGENE 6

584

(Promega). Cells were cultured to grow overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Then medium was

585

removed and VSV-G pseudotyped ΔG-luciferase (G*ΔG-luciferase, Kerafast) was harvested to

586

infect the cells in DMEM at a MOI of 3 for 1 h. Then cells were washed three times with 1× DPBS.

587

DMEM supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-

588

2700; ATCC) and was added to the inoculated cells. The cells were then cultured overnight. The

589

supernatant was removed the following day and clarified by centrifugation at 300 g for 10 mins

590

before storing at −80 °C.

Emulsion Overlap Extension RT-PCR and Yeast Display Library Generation

593

B cells were isolated from Donor 910 cryopreserved PBMCs. Non-B cells were depleted by

594

magnetic bead separation, and CD27+ antigen-experienced B cells were isolated by positive

595

magnetic bead separation (EasySep Human B cell enrichment kit w/o CD43 depletion,

596

STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada, and CD27 Human Microbeads, Miltenyi Biotec,

597

Auburn, CA, USA). Antigen-experienced B cells (memory B cells) were stimulated in vitro for 5

598

days to enhance antibody gene transcription. For stimulation, cells were incubated 5 days in the

599

presence of Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

600

supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x GlutaMAX, 1x non-essential amino acids, 1x sodium pyruvate

601

and 1x penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) along with 100 units/mL IL-2 and 50 ng/mL IL-

602

21 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). B cells were co-cultured with irradiated 3T3-CD40L

603

fibroblast cells that secrete CD40L (kind gift of John Mascola, Vaccine Research Center, NIAID)

604

to aid B cell expansion. Single B cells were captured in emulsion droplets via a flow focusing

605

device with concentric nozzles flowing suspended cells, lysis buffer with mRNA capture magnetic

606

oligo (dT)-coated magnetic beads, and a viscous oil solution to form stable droplets

607

compartmentalizing single B cells with lysis buffer and the mRNA capture beads (McDaniel et al.,

608

2016). Captured beads loaded with single-cell mRNA were re-emulsified and the captured RNA

609

product was reverse transcribed using a SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System with

610

Platinum™ Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The specific immunoglobulin VH

611

and VL genes were then processed with an overlap-extension RT-PCR to link native heavy and

612

light chains into a single amplicon, introducing two restriction sites: NheI and NcoI between the

613

VH and VL genes for downstream yeast library generation (Wang et al., 2018). Natively paired

614

antibody heavy and light chain sequencing and yeast surface display library generation were

615

performed as described previously (DeKosky et al., 2013, 2015; Lagerman et al., 2019; McDaniel

616

et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).

617
618

For yeast library generation, cDNA libraries were amplified with primers containing the yeast

619

display vector restriction sites: AscI and NotI, used for subcloning into the yeast display vector.

620

PCR amplified products were purified by agarose gel extraction and digested with AscI and NotI

621

restriction enzymes followed by subsequent ligation into the yeast display vector backbone. This

622

step was performed in duplicate for each library with separate Kappa- or Lambda- gene-specific

623

primers and a corresponding Kappa or Lambda display vector to generate Kappa and Lambda

624

libraries. Ligated plasmid libraries were transformed into high-efficiency electrocompetent E. coli,

625

expanded overnight, and maxiprepped to isolate the plasmid library DNA product. Maxiprepped

626

plasmid libraries were digested with NheI and NcoI restriction enzymes to remove the native linker

627

from VH:VL pairing. Digested product was purified by agarose gel extraction, and then ligated

628

with a pre-digested DNA gene encoding a bidirectional Gal1/Gal10 promoter inserted between

629

the VH and VL sequences. The resulting ligated product was again transformed into high-

630

efficiency electrocompetent E. coli, expanded overnight, and maxiprepped to isolate the plasmid

631

library DNA product now containing the bidirectional promoter. A final PCR amplification was

632

performed to amplify the VH:bidirectional promoter:VL amplicon with overhanging homologous

633

ends to the pCT backbone for high-efficiency yeast transformation into AWY101 using an

634

homologous recombination method previously described (Benatuil et al., 2010). Transformed

635

libraries were passaged twice in SD-CAA to ensure a 1:1 ratio of plasmid DNA to yeast colony

636

(Benatuil et al., 2010).

637
638

FACS Screening of Yeast Libraries

639

To induce Fab surface expression yeast libraries were incubated in SGD-CAA media at

640

20°C, 225 rpm for 36 hours. For the first round of sorting, 3x107 presorted cells were washed twice

641

with staining buffer (1x PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA). Washed yeast display libraries

642

were stained with 20nM of trimer antigen and a monoclonal anti-FLAG-FITC marker to measure

643

Fab expression (Monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2-FITC antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

644

For staining with the NHS-Biotin S-Trimer Protein probe, cells were mixed with 20nM un-labeled

645

antigen and a monoclonal anti-FLAG-FITC marker (Monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2-FITC antibody,

646

Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) used to measure VL surface expression. This mix was

647

incubated for 15 minutes at 4°C with gentle agitation on a platform shaker. Following incubation,

648

a Streptavidin PE conjugate (Streptavidin, R-Phycoerythrin Conjugate Premium Grade, Thermo

649

Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to the re-suspended mix to fluorescently label

650

the biotinylated antigen protein and the sample was again incubated for 15 minutes at 4°C with

651

gentle agitation on a platform shaker. These NHS-Biotin S-Trimer Protein samples were then

652

washed 3x and re-suspended in a final volume of 1 mL in staining buffer before being filtered

653

through a 35 micron-filter cap FACS tube. For staining the with His-Strep-II S-Trimer Protein

654

probe, cells were incubated with un-labeled antigen for 15 minutes at 4°C with gentle agitation on

655

a platform shaker. Samples were then washed 3x with staining buffer, and resuspended in a

656

common mix containing the monoclonal anti-FLAG-FITC marker and a monoclonal anti-His-PE

657

antibody (PE anti-His Tag Antibody, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) to label surface expressed,

658

antigen bound Fab. These cells were again incubated for 15 minutes in the fluorophore mix at

659

4°C with gentle agitation on a platform shaker. The fluorescently labeled samples were then

660

washed 3x and resuspended in a final volume of 1 mL staining buffer before being filtered through

661

a 35 micron-filter cap FACS tube. Samples were kept in the dark on ice until sorting. Subsequent

662

rounds of enrichment sorting were performed using the same staining procedure, but for only

663

5x106 input cells and 250 uL final resuspension volume.

664

A SONY Multi-Application 900 cell sorter running SONY LE-MA900FP Cell Sorter Software

665

was used to detect all FITC+/PE+ cells from each sample and sort them into low pH SD-CAA

666

media. The gating strategy used was previously described (Wang et al., 2018). Sorted yeast were

667

expanded for 24-48 hours at 30 °C, 225 rpm and then passaged into SGD-CAA media to induce

668

Fab expression for the next round of sorting. This process was repeated for 3-4 rounds of sorting

669

to enrich for Fab-expressing antigen-binding library populations. In addition to the antigen-positive

670

sorts, an aliquot of each yeast library was washed and stained with only the anti-FLAG-FITC

671

marker, and all FITC+ (i.e., VL+) cells were sorted and sequenced for use as a reference database

672

for NGS enrichment ratio calculations. Analysis of flow cytometry data was conducted using

673

Flowjo10.4 (Flowjo, LLC, Oregon, USA).

674
675

NGS Analysis of Sorted Yeast Libraries

676

After each round of FACS enrichment, yeast libraries were expanded via incubation at 30°C

677

for 24-48 hours. An aliquot of this culture was used for high-efficiency yeast plasmid DNA

678

extraction (Whitehead et al., 2012). A high-fidelity polymerase (Kapa Hifi HotStart Mastermix,

679

Kapa Biosystems, Massachusetts, USA) and primers targeting the yeast display vector backbone

680

were used to amplify HC and LC genes from each library (Wang et al., 2018). A second round of

681

primer-extension PCR with barcoded primers added a unique identifier to all HC and LC from a

682

particular library (McDaniel et al., 2016). Sorted libraries were sequenced on the Illumina 2x300

683

MiSeq platform and sequencing was performed for each library after each round of FACS

684

enrichment. Data processing of Illumina Raw FASTQ data was performed as reported previously

685

(McDaniel et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). Briefly, Illumina sequences were quality-filtered to

686

improve read quality, followed by V(D)J gene identification and annotation of CDR3 regions using

687

IgBLAST (Ye et al., 2013). Antibody clonal lineages were tracked across yeast sort rounds by

688

their CDR-H3 amino acid sequence and enrichment ratio. Enrichment ratios were calculated by

689

comparing sequence prevalence in each sorted libraries to the unsorted, Fab-expressing (VL+)

690

antibody library.

695

chain plasmids were co-transfected into Expi293F (ThermoFisher) mammalian cells using the

696

ExpiFectamineTM 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and

697

culture in 37°C shaker at 125 RPM and 8% CO2. On day 6 post transfection, the supernatant

698

from transient transfection culture were purified with Protein G or A resin (GenScript, New Jersey,

699

USA) and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal 30K Filter Unit (MilliporeSigma,

700

Maryland, USA), then stored at 4°C.

702

ELISA Binding Assays to S trimer and RBD

703

S trimer and RBD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (Fig. 2C) were performed

704

in triplicate. 175 ng of antigen per well was coated onto 96-well ELISA plates at 4 °C overnight.

705

Plates were washed and then blocked with 100 μL of blocking buffer at 37 °C for 2 hrs. Purified

706

antibodies were serial diluted using dilution buffer, added to the antigen-coated blocked plates,

707

and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 hr. Plates were washed and 50uL of a secondary anti-human

708

kappa light chain detection antibody (A18853, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to each well

709

and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. After the final wash, 50 uL TMB substrate (00-4203-

710

56, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect antibody binding to antigen

711

measuring absorbance at 405 nm.

713

Pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 Viral Neutralization Assay

714

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed as previously described

715

(Liu et al., 2020a). Briefly, pseudovirus particles were generated from recombinant Indiana VSV

716

(rVSV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Neutralization was assessed by incubating

717

pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of purified antibody, and scored by the reduction in luciferase

718

gene expression.

721

Authentic virus neutralization assays were performed as previously described (Liu et al.,

722

2020a). Briefly, to measure the neutralizing activity of purified mAbs an end-point dilution assay

723

in a 96-well plate format was performed. Each mAb was 5-fold serially diluted starting at 20 μg/mL

724

in triplicate. Dilutions were incubated with live SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hr at 37°C, and post-incubation

725

the virus-antibody mixture was transferred onto a monolayer of Vero-E6 cells and incubated for

726

70 hrs. CPE from the resulting cell incubations were visually scored for each well in a blinded

727

fashion by two independent observers.

dhACE2 Competition ELISA

730

Antibodies were assayed for dhACE2 competition by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays

731

(ELISAs) (Fig. 2E, 3C, S3I) in triplicate. ELISA experiments were performed in parallel at three

732

pH values 7.4, 5.5, and 4.5. ELISA 96-well plates were coated with 175 ng per well of antigen in

733

pH-adjusted PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Ag-coated ELISA plates were

734

washed and blocked with 100 μL of blocking buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr.

735

Purified antibodies were serial diluted and pre-mixed with dhACE2 using pH-adjusted dilution

736

buffer. Ab:dhACE2 premixes were added to the pre-blocked, antigen-coated plates and incubated

737

at room temperature for 2 hr. Plates were washed and 50 μL of 1:2000 diluted, pH-adjusted

738

secondary anti-human kappa light chain detection antibody (A18853, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)

739

748

from the gel and purified using a Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB). The fragments were

749

assembled using NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly master mix (NEB) according to the

750

manufacturer's instructions and 5 μl of the reaction was transformed into chemically competent

751

E. coli Mach1 (Invitrogen) and selected on LB agar supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin.

752

To create the display construct of S-RBD (333-537)-N343Q fused to the C-terminus of

753

Aga2p, pJS697 was digested with BsaI-HFv2 (NEB) and purified using a Monarch PCR & DNA

754

Cleanup Kit (NEB). pJS699 was digested with NotI-HF (NEB), the reaction fractionated by

755

agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band corresponding to S-RBD (0.83kb) excised and purified

756

using a Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB). The two fragments were co-transformed (in a

757

2.4:1 molar ratio of S-RBD to backbone) into chemically competent S. cerevisiae EBY100 (Boder

758

and Wittrup, 1997) and selected on M19D agar. M19D contained 5 g/L casamino acids, 40 g/L

759

dextrose, 80 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES free acid), 50 mM citric acid, 50 mM

760

phosphoric acid, 6.7 g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base (Sigma), and was adjusted to pH 7 with 9M NaOH,

761

1M KOH.

762

Recombinant human ACE2-Fc and CR3022 were received as a gift from Neil King and

763

David Veesler at the University of Washington. Human ACE2-Fc was produced and purified as

764

described (Walls et al., 2020). CR3022 (Ter Meulen et al., 2006) was expressed by transient

765

transfection in Expi293F cells and purified by protein A affinity chromatography and SEC using a

766

Superdex 200 10/300 GL. Specificity was verified by measuring binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and

767

irrelevant antigen.

798

A structure-based method was applied to define sequence signatures for the HV3-53/3-66

799

class COVID neutralizing antibody (Zhu et al., 2013). Briefly, protein structures of IGHV3-53/3-66

800

antibodies complexed with RBD or spike were selected for analysis, and the buried surface area

801

(BSA)

802

(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/). We examined the BSA larger than 20 Å2, and residues making

803

contacting with the RBD projected surface that were encoded by the conserved germline

804

sequence were selected as initial class sequence signatures, and amino acids from somatic

805

hypermutations were used to refine the signature of the class antibody. For germline sequence

806

alignments, heavy and light chain germline sequences were downloaded from IMGT (Lefranc et

807

al., 2003) and the sequences of CDR1 and CDR2 were extracted and aligned based on Kabat

808

numbering. ANARCI server was used to number amino acid sequences of antibody

Antibody Class Frequency Estimation

812

The frequency of antibody class was estimated using OLGA software based on defined

813

motif (Sethna et al., 2019). NGS samples of three healthy donors (NCBI Short Read Archive

814

accession code: PRJNA511481) were used to analyze heavy and light chain lineage precursor

815

frequencies (Soto et al., 2019). The ratio of human kappa and light chain (60:40) was obtained

816

from Bräuninger et. al., 2001. Antibody class precursor frequency was calculated as:

817

(Frequency of heavy chain × Frequency of kappa chain × kappa chain ratio) +

818

(Frequency of heavy chain × Frequency of lambda chain × lambda chain ratio)

Negative Stain Cryo-EM

821

Samples were diluted to a spike concentration of about 20 µg/ml. A 4.7-µl drop of the diluted

822

sample was applied to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid. The grid was washed with

823

a buffer with the same pH as the sample buffer (10 mM HEPES with 150 mM NaCl for pH 7.4; 10

824

mM acetate with 150 mM NaCl for the lower pH values). Protein molecules adsorbed to the carbon

825

were negatively stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. Datasets were collected using a

826

ThermoFisher Talos F200C electron microscope equipped with a Ceta CCD camera. The

827

microscope was operated at 200 kV, the pixel size was 2.53 Å (nominal magnification: 57,000),

828

and the defocus was set at -1.2 µm. Particles were picked and extracted automatically using in-

829

house written software (YT, unpublished). 2D classification was performed using Relion 1.4

830

(Scheres, 2012).

831
832

Cryo-EM Sample Preparation

833

SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike was expressed and purified as described in Wrapp et al., 2020.

834

910-30 Fab was prepared by incubating the full 910-30 IgG with immobilized papain for 3 hours

835

at 37 °C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, 120 mM NaCl, 30 mM cysteine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7. Purified

836

SARS-CoV-2 spike was diluted to a final trimer concentration of 0.33 mg/mL and mixed with 910-

837

30 Fab in a 1:1 molar ratio (sample 1) or 1:9 molar ratio (sample 2). The final buffer for both

838

samples was 10 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.5; 0.005% w/v n-Dodecyl b-D-maltoside

839

(DDM) was added to the mixture to prevent aggregation during vitrification. After incubation for 1

840

hour on ice, a volume of 2 µL was applied to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid (CF

841

1.2/1.3 300 mesh) and vitrified using a Vitrobot Mark IV with a wait time of 30 seconds and a blot

842

time of 3 seconds.

843
844

Cryo-EM Data Collection, Processing and Model Fitting

845

Cryo-EM data were collected using the Leginon software (Suloway et al., 2005) installed on

846

a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan K3-BioQuantum

847

direct detection device. The total dose was fractionated for 3 s over 60 raw frames. Data

850

sample 1 and sample 2 datasets were carried out in cryoSPARC 2.15 (Punjani et al., 2017). The

851

coordinates of SARS CoV-2 spike with 1 RBD up, PDB entry 6VYB (Walls et al., 2020), were

852

employed as initial template to model the cryo-EM map of 910-30 Fab in complex with SARS-

853

CoV-2 spike (sample 1). The RBDs were modeled using the crystallographic structure of RBD in

854

complex with B38 Fab (PDB entry 7BZ5) (Wu et al., 2020b) as a template. The variable region of

855

910-30 Fab was initially modeled using PDB models 7BZ5 and 5SX4 (Sickmier et al., 2016) for

856

the heavy and light chain respectively. The residues at the Fab:RBD interface were modeled by

857

structural comparison of 910-30 Fab with 7 different antibodies belonging to the IGHV3-53/3-66

858

class. Automated and manual model building were iteratively performed using real space

859

refinement in Phenix (Adams et al., 2004) and Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) respectively.

860

EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015) and Molprobity (Davis et al., 2004) were used to validate geometry

861

and check structure quality at each iteration step. UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and

862

Chimera X (Pettersen et al., 2020) were used to calculate map-fitting cross correlation (Fit-in-Map

863

tool) and to prepare figures.

Octet Binding Experiments

866

Binding of mAbs 4-3, B38, 910-30, and 1-20 to SAR-CoV-2 S2P D614 and D614G variants

867

was assessed an a FortéBio Octet HTX instrument (FortéBio). Experiments were run in tilted

868

black 384-well plates (Geiger Bio-One) at 30°C and 1,000 rpm agitation. Running buffer was

869

comprised of 10mM of the corresponding pH buffer plus 150mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween20, 0.1%

870

BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. The following buffers were used to achieve the range of pH: pH 9

871

(borate), pH 8.5 (Tris), pH 8 (Tris), pH 7.4 (PBS), pH 7 (HEPES), pH 6.5 (MES), pH 6 (MES), pH

872

5.5 (NaAc), pH 5 (NaAc), pH 4.5 (NaAc), pH 4.2 (NaAc), pH 4.0 (NaAc). 300nM IgG solution was

873

used for immobilization at pH 7.4 on anti-human IgG Fc capture biosensors (FortéBio) that were

874

pre-hydrated for 30 minutes. Sensors were then equilibrated in 7.4pH buffer for 30 seconds

875

followed by 180 seconds in the altered pH buffer. Binding was assessed at 200nM S2P D614 or

876

D614G and response recorded for 180 seconds. Dissociation in the respective buffer was

877

measured for 300 seconds. The Data Analysis Software HT v12.0 (Fortebio) was used to subtract

878

reference well signal from loaded sensor dipped into buffer without spike protein. The maximum

879

association response (nm) is reported at each pH.

880
881

SPR Binding Experiments

882

SPR binding experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 biosensor, equipped with

883

a Series S SA chip. The running buffer varied depending on the pH of the binding reaction;

884

experiments at pH 7.4 were performed in a running buffer of 10mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl,

885

0.1% (v/v) Tween-20; at pH 5.5 experiments were performed in 10mM sodium acetate pH 5.5,

886

150mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20; and at pH 4.5 in 10mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, 150mM NaCl,

887

0. 1% (v/v) Tween-20. All measurements were performed at 25°C.

888

Biotinylated S2P was captured over independent flow cells at 750-900 RU. HKU910-30 and

889

1-20 IgGs were tested over the biotinylated S2P surfaces at four concentrations ranging from 1-

890

27nM, while B38 and 4-3 were tested at four concentrations ranging from 3-81nM, to account for

891

higher binding KDs. Biotinylated RBD was captured over independent flow cells at 250-500 RU

892

and B38 was tested at four concentrations ranging from 3-81nM, HKU910-30 and 4-3 were tested

893

at four concentrations of 1-27 nM and 1-20 at four concentrations ranging from 0.333-9 nM, to

894

account for differences in their binding affinities. To avoid the need for surface regeneration that

895

arises with the slowly dissociating interactions, we used single-cycle kinetics binding experiments.

896

The four concentrations for each IgG were prepared in running buffers at each of pH, using a

897

three-fold dilution series.

898

Binding of HKU910-30, 4-3 and B38 over the S2P or RBD surface as well as over a

899

streptavidin reference surface was monitored for 120s, followed by a dissociation phase of 120s-

900

1080s depending on the interaction at 50μL/min. For the interaction of 1-20 with the RBD, which

901

showed an unusually slow dissociation rate, an extended dissociation phase of 4500s was

902

necessary to extrapolate accurate apparent dissociation constants. Four blank buffer single

903

cycles were performed by injecting running buffer instead of Fab to remove systematic noise from

904

the binding signal. The data was processed and fit to 1:1 single cycle model using the Scrubber

905

2.0 (BioLogic Software). The results from these assays, are reported in terms of apparent kinetic

906

parameters and KDs to account for potential avidity effects arising from the binding of bivalent

907

IgGs to trivalent S2P.

908
909

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

910

IC50 calculations were reported using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.4.3). Briefly,

911

experimental data was imported and modeled using a least squares regression method to fit the

912

data to a variable slope (four parameter) inhibitor vs. response curve with bottom parameters

913

constrained to zero. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out using FlowJo software (version

914

10.4). The Spearman rank order correlation was calculated using cor.test function in base R.

915

Spearman ρ and the p-values for the test were used to determine the strength of the correlation

916

between tested variables.
