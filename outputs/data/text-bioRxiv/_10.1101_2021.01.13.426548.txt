Abstract

19

Surveillance of genetic diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important to detect the

20

emergence of more infectious and deadly strains of the virus. In this study, we monitored

21

mutational events in the SARS-CoV-2 genome through whole genome sequencing. The samples

22

(n=48) were collected from the hot spot regions of the metropolitan city Karachi, Pakistan during

23

the four months (May 2020 to August 2020) of first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data

24

analysis highlighted 122 mutations, including 120 single nucleotide variations (SNV), and 2

25

deletions. Among the 122 mutations, there were 71 singletons, and 51 recurrent mutations. A

26

total of 16 mutations, including 5 nonsynonymous mutations, were detected in spike protein.

27

Notably, the spike protein missense mutation D614G was observed in 31 genomes. The

28

phylogenetic analysis revealed majority of the genomes (36) classified as B lineage, where 2

29

genomes were from B.6 lineage, 5 genomes from B.1 ancestral lineage and remaining from B.1

30

sub-lineages. It was noteworthy that three clusters of B.1 sub-lineages were observed, including

31

B.1.36 lineage (10 genomes), B.1.160 lineage (11 genomes), and B.1.255 lineage (5 genomes),

32

which represent independent events of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the city. The sub-

33

lineage B.1.36 had higher representation from the Asian countries and the UK, B.1.160

34

correspond to the European countries with highest representation from the UK, Denmark, and

35

lesser representation from India, Saudi Arabia, France and Switzerland, and the third sub-lineage

36

(B.1.255) correspond to the USA. Collectively, our study provides meaningful insight into the

37

evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in spatio-temporal local transmission during the first wave of

38

the pandemic.

Introduction

42

The novel beta coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)

43

which causes respiratory illness named as Covid-19, was first emerged in Wuhan, China in

44

December 2019 and recognized by World Health Organization (WHO) as pandemic in March

45

2020 (Shereen, Khan, Kazmi, Bashir, and Siddique, 2020). According to John Hopkins

46

University, there were more than 83 million confirmed cases and approximately 1.8 million

47

deaths worldwide by the end of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae,

48

which comprises many virulent strains that infect humans and animals, including Middle East

49

respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV (V’kovski, et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2

50

is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 29.8kb.

51

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from

52

asymptomatic to fatal (Adachi, Koma, Nomaguchi, and Adachi, 2020; Monchatre-Leroy et al.,

53

2017). It contains four major structural proteins including spike (S) protein, membrane (M)

54

protein, and envelope (E) protein, which are embedded in the viral surface envelope, while

55

nucleocapsid (N) protein is in the ribonucleoprotein complex. Furthermore, the viral genome also

56

encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (McBride, Van Zyl, and

57

Fielding, 2014; Hassan, Choudhury, and Roy, 2020). The virus entry in the cell is facilitated by S

58

protein. S1 subunit engages ACE-2 receptor for binding while S protein priming is carried out by

59

binding to cellular serine protease TMPRSS2. This allows the fusion of viral and cellular

60

membranes. This fusion is driven by the S2 subunit of S protein (Hoffmann, et al., 2020).

61

Viruses rapidly evolve during pandemic due to accumulation of mutation. This contributes in

62

viral adaptation, drug resistance and higher transmissibility of more virulent strains (Pachetti et

63

al., 2020). Many descendants of the original Wuhan strain have already been evolved into

64

distinct lineages with potential of vaccine escape. Despite very high mutation rate and rapid

65

emergence of new strains very few mutations have been functionally characterized (Wang,

66

Wang, and Zhuang 2020).

67

A massive genome sequencing drive is under way globally, to document the genetic diversity of

68

SARS-CoV-2. Several studies has reported large number of mutations in various genes,

69

including S, M, E, N, ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, and ORF10. It is noteworthy that

70

several regions including nsp1, nsp2 nsp3, nsp12, and nsp15 of ORF1ab, S, as well as ORF8

71

genes have high mutation rate as compare to other genes (Rahimi, Mirzazadeh, and Tavakolpour,

72

2020).

73

Genomic surveillance of a virus after it enters a new population is crucial for designing effective

74

strategies for disease control and prevention (Ladner et al., 2019). The findings of such studies

75

support contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions to contain the spread of SARS-

76

CoV-2. In a study conducted in Northern California from late January to mid-March 2020, using

77

samples from 36 patients spanning nine counties and the Grand Princess cruise ship,

78

phylogenetic analyses revealed the cryptic introduction of at least seven different SARS-CoV-2

79

lineages into California (Deng et al., 2020). Genetic surveillance of COVID-19 studies in

80

Malaysia and other Asian countries highlighted the presence of B.6 lineage in the Asia Pacific

81

region (representing 95% of the world cases of B.6 strains) (Chong et al., 2020). The genomic

82

based surveillance of COVID-19 cases in Beijing, China till May 2020 revealed transmission of

83

SARS-CoV-2 in the city via three routes including Wuhan exposure group, foreigner imported

84

cases, and locally transmitted cases (Du et al., 2020).

85

Pakistan, shares borders with world’s most densely populated nations with strong movement of

86

people from and to the hotspots of COVID-19. The country confirmed its first COVID-19 patient

87

on February 26, 2020, in southern city of Karachi. By the end of 2020, there are 479,715

88

confirmed cases in Pakistan with more than 10,000 deaths. Government adopted progressive

89

disease prevention initiatives to restrict social contacts, reduce the dissemination of viruses and

90

avoid community-based transmissions. Pakistan witnessed peak in June and cases fell from

91

thousands to a few hundred per day in September. Currently, Pakistan is experiencing second

92

wave of infection with around 3000 new cases are diagnosed per day. World Health

93

Organization appreciated overall strategy adopted by Pakistan to successfully contain the virus

94

(WHO 2020 https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/covid-19-in-pakistan-who-

95

fighting-tirelessly-against-the-odds).

96

The present study attempts to gain insight into the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 genome

97

in the Pakistani. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed 48 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

98

isolated from patients from different hotspots areas of Karachi. Spatiotemporal approach was

99

adopted and samples were collected from May to August 2020. The focus of epidemiological

100

analysis was to identify specific patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through genomic analysis

101

within local population before and during the containment stage of the COVID-19 and compare

Ethical Consideration, recruitment of patients, and samples collection

106

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the International Center for

107

Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, and the study design adhered to the

108

ethical considerations according to the Declaration of Helsinki (Helsinki, 2013). For current

109

study, a total of 200 patients were recruited from different hotspot areas of Karachi during the

110

first wave of COVID-19 from May to August 2020. For COVID-19 testing, nasopharyngeal

111

swabs were collected in viral transport medium (VTM) according to the guidelines of the Center

112

for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020). All the patients were tested positive for

113

COVID-19 by real time PCR using SARS-CoV-2 specific primers and probes at the National

114

Institute of Virology, ICCBS, University of Karachi. Total RNA was isolated from the VTM in a

115

biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,

116

Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentration of the total RNA was evaluated

117

with Qubit fluorometer using Qubit RNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).

118

2.2

119

Double stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from the total RNA by using

120

Maxima H Minus Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (cat#2561, Thermo Fisher Scientific,

121

MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This involved synthesis of the first strand

122

cDNA followed by the second strand cDNA. For first strand cDNA synthesis, the isolated total

123

RNA and random hexamer primers were incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes followed by addition of

124

4X First Strand Reaction Mix along with First Strand Enzyme Mix. The reaction mixture was

125

incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes, 50°C for 30 minutes, followed by termination of the reaction

126

at 85°C for 5 minutes. The second strand cDNA synthesis was performed by adding 5X Second

127

Strand Reaction Mix and Second Strand Enzyme Mix to the first strand cDNA synthesis reaction

128

mixture. Final volume was adjusted with nuclease free water, and the reaction mixture was

129

incubated at 16°C for 60 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5M EDTA. The double

130

stranded cDNA was purified by using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, CA,

131

USA), and the concentration was evaluated using Qubit DNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher

132

Scientific, MA, USA).

DNA library preparation, and whole genome sequencing

134

A total of 48 samples (male n=29, female n=19) were selected for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome

135

sequencing. Paired-end libraries were constructed from the double stranded cDNA by using

136

Illumina DNA Prep with Enrichment kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) following the

137

manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the tagmentation of purified double stranded cDNA (50 ng)

138

was performed by using bead linked transposomes followed by adapters ligation to the

139

tagmented DNA. Unique indexes (IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA UD Indexes) were added to each

140

tagmented DNA in limited cycles of RCR. The amplified tagmented DNA was purified using

141

sample purification beads. Prior to the enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 genome, the libraries were

142

pooled in 12 plex reactions (multiplexing of 12 samples). DNA fragments of the SARS CoV-2

143

genome were hybridized with biotinylated respiratory virus oligos (Illumina Inc., San Diego,

144

CA, USA). The DNA fragments hybridized with the custom oligos were captured using

145

streptavidin magnetic beads. The enriched library was amplified followed by purification with

146

Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The concentration of the enriched

147

libraries was determined using Qubit DNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).

148

The libraries were denatured with 0.2N NaOH followed by dilution to 12 pmole using the

149

hybridization buffer (HT1). Paired-end sequencing (2x75 bases) using MiSeq reaget v2 kit was

150

carried out on Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

151

2.4

152

The raw data in the binary base call format (.bcl) was converted into fastq format on the MiSeq

153

instrument. Quality of the DNA short reads was assessed using FastQC tool (Andrews, 2010).

154

The short reads were aligned with the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome of the isolate from

155

Wuhan, China (Wuhan-Hu-1 genome, Genbank accession NC_045512) using the BWA-MEM

156

algorithm (Li, 2013). The post alignment processing and variants calling was carried out by

157

using the Samtools package (Dhandapany et al., 2009). The samples with coverage ≥88% were

158

processed for downstream analysis. The variants with quality score (QUAL) < 30 were filtered

159

out. The functional annotation of the variants was carried out by using ANNOVAR (Yang et al.,

160

2015). For building the whole genome, the consensus sequences were generated from the binary

161

alignment map (bam) files, as described previously (Sah et al., 2020). For comparison and

162

validation, DNA short reads were assembled through de novo assembly with Velvet 1.0.0

Results and Discussion

168

3.1

Description of the Cohort

169

We selected 48 COVID-19 patients from the public sector hospitals during the peak time of first

170

wave of the pandemic (from 2nd May 2020 to 10th August 2020) in the metropolitan city of

171

Karachi, Pakistan. The samples were included in the study after confirmed diagnosis with real

172

time PCR test from the nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The cohort was comprised of 32 males

173

and 16 females with a median age of 36 years (IQR 23-44 years). The samples were selected

174

from the regions designated as COVID-19 hotspots by the local administrative authority. The

175

disease symptoms were varying in the patients including mild symptoms of low grade fever and

176

flu to moderate symptoms of fever, flue and difficulty in breathing.

177

3.2

178

To uncover the genomic characteristics and diversities of the virus responsible for the COVID-

179

19 in Karachi, deep SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was employed using a custom oligos

180

panel designed for the enrichment of respiratory viruses sequences. Through massively parallel

181

sequencing, we obtained 27.112 million paired-end, good quality reads (on average 0.565 million

182

reads per sample). After removing the samples in which viral genome coverage was below 85%,

183

we obtained near complete viral genomes from 37 cases with average depth of coverage of

184

1371X. After alignment of the short reads with the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome of Wuhan

185

isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1, ‎NC_045512.2), the genetic variations were obtained employing the on-

186

instrument default pipeline of BWA, Samtools, and GATK tools. After filtering out the low

187

quality mutations (those with QUAL<30), there were cumulative 451 mutations at 122 genomic

188

sites (including 120 single nucleotide variation (SNV) sites, and 2 deletion sites) (Supplementary

189

Table S1). These variations include 71 singletons, and 51 recurrent mutations, which appeared

190

more than once within the cohort (Fig.1). Great diversity in mutational sites among the genome

191

assemblies was observed. There were, on average, 12.19 mutational events per genome (SD

192

±3.57) with a median of 12 mutations per genome (IQR 11-14). The genome-wide

193

nonsynonymous/synonymous ratio was observed as 1.50, which is lower than the precedented

194

nonsyn/syn ratio (1.88) in previous global scale study (van Dorp et al., 2020). Further bifurcation

195

indicated that the nonsyn/syn ratio was 1.48 at singleton sites whereas 1.52 at polymorphic sites.

196

Furthermore, the nonsyn/syn ratio at homoplasic sites (those with recurrence in at least 3

genomes) was 1.17. These analyses indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 continued to acquire new

198

nonsynonymous mutational sites within the studied cohort. Next we explored which region was

199

prone to higher number of nonsynonymous mutations. The nonsyn/syn ratio across ORF1ab was

200

1.75 where the ratio across rest of the genome was 1.23, indicating higher tendency of ORF1ab

201

to acquire mutations at nonsynonymous sites (Fisher Exact P=0.23, OR=1.57, 95% CI=0.671–

202

3.031).

Meta-analysis of large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across multiple countries has

demonstrated that one SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from the Wuhan-Wu-I reference strain

‎ C_045512.2) at maximum of 32 sites (van Dorp et al., 2020). We constructed mutational
(N

207

landscape to decipher the genes which are more recurrently mutated than the others. This

208

analysis highlighted that two genes i.e., Spike protein and non-structural protein 3 (nsp3)

209

contained the highest number of recurrent mutations i.e., 35 mutational incidences each (Fig.2).

210

Notably, the spike protein contained highest number of homoplasic sites (6 mutations) including

211

two missense SNVs i.e., the D614G mutation observed in 32 samples (86.5% of the cohort), and

212

Q677H mutation observed in 4 samples (10.8% of the cohort). The other highly recurrent

213

variations included an upstream 5’-UTR mutation 241:C>T (observed in 33 samples), a silent

214

mutation F924F in nsp3 (observed in 31 samples), a missense mutation in nsp12 P4715L

215

(observed in 31 samples), a silent mutation L227L in nsp13 (observed in 12 samples), a silent

216

mutation L280L in nsp14 (observed in 28 samples), silent mutations D294D and G880G in spike

217

protein (observed in 12 and 13 samples respectively), a missense mutation Q57H in orf3a

218

(observed in 31 samples), silent mutation Y71Y and missense mutation H125Y in membrane

219

protein (observed in 27 and 4 samples respectively), a stop-gain mutation E39X in orf7b

220

(observed in 4 samples), and missense mutations S194L and R209I in nucleocapsid protein

221

(observed in 11 samples each). Comparison of the frequency of recurrent mutations in our cohort

222

with the global recurrence showed that the missense mutation V2133A in nsp3 protein was

223

observed in 5 samples of present study cohort, whereas, this mutations has been observed in 2

224

SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Norway and one in Turkey.

226

In order to determine accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 with the passage of time, we

227

determined mutation rate (total mutations/no. of cases) in each of the four months. This analysis

228

showed that during the month of May 2020, 8.8 mutations per sample were observed, with

229

singletons/recurrent mutations ratio of 2.5. The mutation rate in June 2020 was 10.05 mutations

230

per genome, with singletons/recurrent mutations ratio of 2.65, in July 2020, the mutations per

231

genome were 9.8 with singletons/recurrent mutations ratio of 1.28, and in August 2020, the

232

mutations rate was 12.5 with singletons/recurrent mutations ratio of 0.23 (Fig.3A). Although,

233

there was non-significant difference (one-way ANOVA P > 0.05) in the mutation rate among the

234

four months, yet there was significant increase in recurrent mutations during the month of July

235

and August 2020 (Fig.3B). Next we investigated the mutational rate in genes of ORF1ab, spike,

236

membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins separately (Fig.3C). This analysis indicated that the

237

mutation rate in the ORF1ab during the months of May and June were comparable (5.06 and

238

5.37 respectively), whereas it decreased in July (4.41) and increased in August (6.37). On the

239

other hand, the mutation rate in the spike protein was 0.99 which increased to almost double in

240

June (1.88), July (1.53), and August (2.09). The mutation rate in the membrane protein was

241

comparable during the four months i.e., 0.78, 0.81, 0.80,

242

2020 respectively. Likewise, the mutation rate in the nucleocapsid protein was 1.10, 0.98, 0.91,

243

1.20 during the months of May, June, July and August 2020 respectively.

245

Given the samples were collected in four different locations of the city, we conducted a

246

phylogenetic analysis to delineate clustering among the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The

247

phylogenetic analysis revealed that majority of the samples were descendants of B lineages

248

(Fig.4) according to the taxonomic nomenclature proposed by Rambaut et al. 2020. Only one

249

genome was found to be of A (Chinese) lineage, whereas, the remaining 36 genomes were of B

lineages. Among the genomes of B lineages, one genome was of the parental B lineage and had

251

highest similarity with the Wuhan-Wu-I genome, two genomes were of B.6 (Singapore lineage),

252

whereas remaining 33 were either of B.1 lineage (3 genomes) or further descendants of B.1

253

lineage. The descendants of B.1 comprised of three types of high prevalent lineages i.e., B.1.36

254

(10 genomes), B.1.160 (11 genomes), and B.1.255 (5 genomes). These three types of B.1 sub-

255

lineages seem to be spread in the city during independent transmission events. The B.1.36 is

256

global lineage with lots of representation of sequences from the India, Saudi Arabia, and UK

257

(Ishtiaque et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020). The B.1.160 lineage is the most recently split from

258

B.1.36 lineage and has mostly been reported from the European countries with major

259

representation in the UK followed by Denmark, France and Switzerland (Rambaut et al., 2020).

260

The third major lineage in our genomes B.1.255 has major global representation with

261

significantly higher representation in the USA. Notably, one genome was observed from B.1.184

262

lineage, which has 100% representation in India (Andrew et al., 2020). These findings were

263

validated in the hierarchical clustering where three clusters of genomes were observed (Fig.5),

264

where the founding lineages (B, B.1) appeared in the center of the principle component analysis

265

(PCA) plot, whereas, the three sub-lineages clustered at the peripheries of the plot.

266

Conclusion

267

To the best of our knowledge this study presents first comprehensive report on the surveillance

268

of genomic evolution in the SARS-CoV-2 transmitted locally in the metropolitan city of Karachi,

269

Pakistan during the four months of first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The schematic

270

analysis provided meaningful insight into the lineages being transmitted within the city. The

271

higher prevalence of three types of B.1 sub-lineages highlighted that the virus most likely had

272

entered into the region through the travellers from the Europe, USA, Saudi Arabia, and India.

273

The findings of this study enabled to monitor whether a more deadly strain of SARS-CoV-2 is

274

being spreading in the country or else. These preliminary analyses present mutational and

275

lineages status of the genomes, further analyses are underway to find the impact of identified

276

mutations on viral infectivity and fatality.
