Abstract
The disease caused by SARS-CoV2, covid-19, rapidly spreads worldwide, causing the
greatest threat to global public health in the last 100 years. This scenario has become
catastrophic as there are no approved vaccines to prevent the disease, and the main
measures to contain the virus transmission are confinement and social distancing. One
priority strategy is based on drug repurposing by pursuing antiviral chemotherapy that
can control transmission and prevent complications associated with covid-19. With this
aim, we performed a high content screening assay for the discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2
compounds. From the 65 screened compounds, we have found four drugs capable to
selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection: brequinar, abiraterone acetate,
neomycin, and the extract of Hedera helix. Brequinar and abiraterone acetate had higher
inhibition potency against SARS-CoV-2 than neomycin and Hedera helix extract,
respectively. Drugs with reported antiviral activity and in clinical trials for covid-19,
chloroquine, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide, were also included in the screening, and the
last two were found to be non-selective. We used a data mining approach to build drughost molecules-biological function-disease networks to show in a holistic way how each
compound is interconnected with host node molecules and virus infection, replication,
inflammatory response, and cell apoptosis. In summary, the present manuscript identified
four drugs with active inhibition effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection, and by network
analysis, we provided new insights and starting points for the clinical evaluation and
repurposing process to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
The world is experiencing an unprecedented pandemic of a novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first infected patients were
reported in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, in December 2019. The disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2, covid-19 (1,2) has high mortality and morbidity and rapidly spread, creating
an enormous impact on the health systems worldwide. As of June 2020, over 8 million
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were confirmed with at least 450 thousand deaths
officially recorded worldwide

(3)

. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-

stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Infection with most members
of this family cause only mild, common cold-like symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 is part of the
family the first SARS-CoV, which caused in 2002 approximately 8000 cases, with a fatality
rate of 10%, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which
produced in 2012 around 2500 confirmed cases with a fatality rate of 36%

(4,5,6)

.

Compared to MERS or SARS, SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread more efficiently, making
it difficult to contain and increasing its pandemic potential (6,7,8).

While the discovery and development of new antivirals that can efficiently treat covid-19
should be actively pursued, drug repositioning stands out as an attractive strategy to be
explored for SARS-CoV-2. Toward this end, many preclinical studies and investigational
clinical trials have been conducted worldwide to determine which therapeutic options
readily available can serve not only as an antiviral therapy but also as a cure of covid-19,
including drugs that can efficiently revert the inflammatory condition that develops in
association with severe cases, as recently reported for dexamethasone (9).

Some screening campaigns of approved drug libraries and bioactive molecules have
been conducted for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Antiparasitic drugs as
chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine

(10,11)

, ivermectin

(12)

, nitazoxanide

(10)

have shown antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Another approved drug that
decreased the coronavirus infection in cell culture was azithromycin (13), a widely used
broad-spectrum antibiotic. Nucleoside analogs as remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, ribavirin
have already been tested for activity against SARS-CoV-2 (10, 14-16). The antiviral lopinavir,
a protease inhibitor, has also been shown inhibitory activity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
Vero E6 cells (14).

Over the years, data mining based-computational analyses have also been used as
hypothesis-generating research helping to fasten the repurposing approach by redirecting the in vitro and in vivo testing and chosen potential drugs that could lead to
significant results and find successful treatments for different diseases (17). By building a
drug-molecules-disease/function network we show in this study in a holistic way how the
drugs tested in vitro are interconnected with node molecules and biological functions
associated with Coronaviridae replication. These findings provide insights toward
possible mechanisms of action of these drugs and may point to target molecules as
alternative therapeutic options to SAR-COV-2.

Given the current covid-19 pandemic scenario, there is an urgent need to find therapeutic
solutions that limit viral infection and reduce clinical complications. We have developed a

high content screening assay to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and
used to screen 65 compounds, some of them previously reported as having broadspectrum antiviral activity. Computational analysis was used to build drug-host moleculesbiological function-disease networks based on the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB), a
manually and automatically curated and extracted repository of biological interactions and
functional annotations created from millions of individually modeled relationships between
proteins, genes, complexes, cells, tissues, drugs and disease extracted from the
literature.

Materials and Methods

Virus and cell lines
The SARS-CoV-2 used in this study (HIAE-02: SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/2020/BRA,
GenBank Accession No. MT126808.1) was isolated from a nasopharyngeal sample of a
confirmed covid-19 patient in the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil. The
virus was passaged twice in Vero E6 cell line (ATCC) maintained in DMEM High Glucose
(Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (Thermo
Scientific) and 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of Streptomycin (Thermo Scientific).
Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The supernatant of infected cells was stored
in aliquots at - 80 °C, and the viral titer was determined by plaque assay in Vero CCL-81.
Briefly, 1x105 Vero CCL-81 cells were seeded on each well of a 24-well plate in DMEM
High Glucose supplemented as described above at 37° C with 5% CO2. After 24 h, the
medium was removed, and 400 µL of medium with serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 were

incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for virus adsorption. Then, the medium was
removed and replaced with 500 µL of DMEM High Glucose supplemented as above
added 3% of carboxymethyl cellulose and incubated for 72 h. After that, the medium was
removed, the plate was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (m/v) pH 7.4 for 15 min
and stained with crystal violet 1% in 10% ethanol (m/v/v). The number of plaques was
visually assessed, counted, and virus titer was calculated as plaque-forming units
(PFU)/mL. All procedures involving the SARS-CoV-2 virus were performed in the
biosafety level 3 laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São
Paulo.

Compounds
Brequinar sodium salt (CAS No. 96201-88-6), Chloroquine diphosphate salt (CAS No.
50-63-5), U-73343 (CAS No. 142878-12-4), 6-Azauridine (CAS No. 54-25-1), 5Fluorouracil (CAS No. 51-21-8), Benztropine mesylate (CAS No. 132-17-2) and
Bafilomycin A1 (CAS No. 88899-55-2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Active
pharmaceutical ingredients for an additional 59 drugs, listed in Table S1, were provided
by Eurofarma Laboratories, Brazil. Compounds were resuspended in Dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) for a final concentration of 10 mM or 10 mg/mL (for Hedera helix
extract) and stored at - 20 °C. For the preparation of screening plates, compounds were
manually pipetted on a 384-well polypropylene plate (Greiner Bio-One) and serially
diluted in neat DMSO by a factor of two, starting from 10 mM or 10 mg/mL, and frozen at
- 20 °C until use.

Phenotypic screening assay
An amount of 2000 Vero E6 cells were seeded on each well of a 384-well assay plate
(Greiner Bio-One) in 40 µL of DMEM High Glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (Thermo Scientific), 100 U/mL of penicillin and
100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. After this period,
the medium was aspirated using Biotek Multiflo FX, and 30 µL of DMEM High Glucose
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added in each well. Serially-diluted compounds were manually
transferred into a polypropylene 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-One) containing sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, for a final dilution factor of 33,3. Then, 10 µL of
each well in the compounds plate was transferred to the cell-containing assay plate,
followed by the addition of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles to the cells at the multiplicity of
infection (MOI) 0.01 in 10 µL of DMEM High Glucose per well. DMSO-treated infected
cells and DMSO-treated non-infected cells were used as controls. The assay plate was
incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for virus adsorption, followed by the addition of 10 µL
of DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 12% Fetal Bovine Serum per well. Thus, final
concentrations in the assay plate were 0.5% DMSO and 2% FBS. After 48 h of incubation,
the plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 and subjected to indirect
immunofluorescence detection of viral cellular infection. After washing twice with PBS pH
7.4, plates were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS
(BSA-PBS) for 30 min at RT and washed twice with PBS. As a primary antibody, either
serum from a convalescent covid-19 Brazilian patient diluted 1:500 in PBS or a polyclonal
rabbit antibody anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapside protein (GeneTex) at 2 µg/mL in PBS
were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells. The primary antibodies were

incubated for 30 min, and plates were washed twice with PBS. As secondary antibodies,
goat anti-human IgG labeled with FITC (Chemicon) or goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with
Alexa 488 (Thermo Scientific) was used diluted at 4 µg/mL in PBS and incubated for 30
min with 5 µg/mL 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich)
in PBS to stain nuclei. The plates were washed twice with PBS and imaged in the
Operetta High Content Imaging System (Perkin Elmer) using a 20x magnification
objective. Four images were acquired per well.

Data analysis
Acquired images were analyzed in the software Harmony (Perkin Elmer), version 3.5.2.
Image analysis consisted of identifying and counting Vero E6 cells based on nuclear
segmentation and viral infection based on the cytoplasmic staining detected by the
immunofluorescence assay. The infection ratio (IR) was calculated as the ratio between
the number of infected cells and the number of total cells counted in each well. The cell
survival rate was calculated as the number of cells counted in each well divided by the
average number of cells in the positive control (DMSO-treated infected cells) wells,
multiplied by 100. The antiviral activity was determined by the normalization of the IR to
the negative control (DMSO-treated infected and non-infected cells), as described.
Concentration-response curves were plotted using the normalized activity and cell
survival of each concentration. These two parameters were used to calculate the
concentration of EC50 and CC50, compounds concentrations that reduce the infection
ratio, and cell survival in 50%, respectively, compared to non-treated infected controls of
each compound using GraphPad Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software, USA).

Functional and network analysis
Functional and network analysis was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA,
Qiagen). The network was built considering only direct and indirect experimentally
validated node relationships available from the database and direct acquisition from the
literature by Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB). Fisher's exact test measured the
significance of the association between drug-node-function and disease. As a result, a Pvalue is obtained, determining the probability that the association between the nodes in
the networks generated can be explained by chance alone. The analysis was performed
based on IKB content of date 2020–06. The Molecule Activity Predictor (MAP) tool from
IPA was used to predict the upstream and/or downstream effects of activation or inhibition
of molecules in a network or pathway given one or more neighboring molecules with
"known" activity from the literature. MAP enabled us to visualize the overall effect on a
pathway or network and, therefore, to generate a more accurate hypothesis.
The molecules or functions that are predicted to be activated are colored in orange. Those
predicted to be inhibited (colored blue), are based on their interactions with molecules
known (or manually assigned by the user) to be activated or inhibited. The predictions
become less defined as the distance from the node(s) with known activation state
increases represented by tones of orange and blue (darker to fainter) from the drug,
expressed in red.

High Content Screening Assay Development
A high content screening (HCS) assay was developed to measure the effects of 65 drugs
and experimental compounds on infection and cytotoxicity in vitro on Vero E6 cells
infected with a Brazilian isolate of SARS-CoV-2, aiming at providing candidates for clinical
repurposing and chemical probes for validation of drug targets for covid-19. Figure 1A
shows a graphical representation of the overall workflow of the assay's conditions and
procedures to screen the drug library. Compounds were evaluated in concentrationresponse using HCS data and classified for their antiviral activity into non-active, nonselective/active, and selective/active. Computational analysis was used to build a drughost molecule-biological function-disease network for selective drugs with novel antiSARS-CoV-2 activity. Figures 1B (a to d) show representative images from the automated
high content image analysis used to quantify cell infection performed in optimized assay
conditions, with nuclei and cytoplasm segmentation, followed by classification of cells into
infected (green) and non-infected (red). The immunofluorescence detection of SARSCoV-2 intracellular was performed using the serum from a convalescent covid-19 patient
that proved to have higher sensitivity than a commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein
polyclonal rabbit antibody (Figure S1).

Evaluation of drugs with known anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity
The assay was validated with three antiparasitic drugs with previously reported antiviral
activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection for covid-19: chloroquine (10), ivermectin (12)
and nitazoxanide (18). All three drugs were capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in
a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2), with EC50s of similar range (4.7 µM for

chloroquine, 1.0 µM for nitazoxanide and 1.7 µM for ivermectin – Table 1). However, the
evaluated CC50 for nitazoxanide and ivermectin were at the same range (3.3 and 2.2 µM,
respectively), suggesting that they are not selective. Only chloroquine was non-cytotoxic,
with a selectivity index (SI) greater than 18, while both nitazoxanide and especially
ivermectin displayed cytotoxicity, with poor SI values (3.3 for nitazoxanide and 1.3 for
ivermectin). The poor selectivity of these two drugs in vitro is further evidenced by the
increasing frequency of apparent pyknotic nuclei at higher drug concentrations (red
arrows in Fig. 2) and reduced cell number, as opposed to reduced incidence of host cell
diving nuclei (green arrows in Fig. 2).

Other experimental compounds and drugs with known antiviral activity, but not previously
reported for SARS-CoV-2, were also tested in the HCS assay. Among these, only
brequinar

(19, 20, 21)

and the experimental compound U-73343

(22)

showed activity against

SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with EC50s of 0.3 µM for brequinar and 2.7 µM for U-73343.
However, only brequinar was sufficiently selective, with SI higher than 166, while U-73343
had a SI of 3.6. The other compounds, 6-Azauridine

(23, 24)

, 5-fluorouracil

(23, 25)

,

benztropine (26), bafilomycin A1 (27, 28), showed no activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1).

Screening of drugs for repurposing for covid-19
The assay was then used to screen the other 56 drugs currently used in the clinic for
several indications. Among these, two drugs showed new activity against SARS-CoV-2
(Table 2): the antiandrogen abiraterone acetate (EC50 of 7.1 µM) and the aminoglycosidic
antibiotic neomycin (EC50 of 12.9 µM). Besides these two molecules, moderate antiviral

activity against SARS-CoV-2 was also observed for the extract of Hedera helix leaves,
used as a treatment for cough, with an EC50 of 51 µg/mL. These compounds exhibited no
cytotoxic effect under the assay conditions, thereby being sufficiently selective against
SARS-CoV-2. Other tested compounds showed no activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro
(Table S1).

Figure 3 shows the concentration-response curves for antiviral and cytotoxic activity of
the most selective compounds: brequinar, abiraterone, Hedera helix, and neomycin,
along with representative images of intracellular infection under active and non-active
drug concentrations.

Network prediction analysis of drug-host molecules-biological function-diseases
interaction
A data mining approach was used to build a drug/compound-host molecules interaction
network, as shown in Figure 4abiraterone acetate, neomycin, brequinar and some of the
main components found in the Hedera helix extract, e.g. hexa-D-arginine, rutin, quercetin,
hederagenin, nicotiflorin, kaempferol, stigmasterol, and alpha-hederin. All networks built
have the same number of nodes that represent host molecules, biological functions ("proinflammatory cytokines," "cell apoptosis) and disease (viral infection and RNA virus
replication) without counting those related to the drug/compound. The nodes are listed in
Table S2. The networks were built by using an IPA tool called "Grow," where new node
molecules are added to the growing network in order of their interconnectedness and also
specific connectivity based on their position in a more extensive network stored on IPA

database (Global Molecular Network – GMN – gene that is most connected to the growing
network). The nodes in the networks are interconnected directly and/or indirectly
represented as solid and dashed lines (edges), respectively. We show networks built by
growing from the functions and disease nodes and manually adding the drug/compound.
When the drug is present in the network, its node is colored in red. The prediction analysis
revealed the potential role/connection of each one of the drugs with other
nodes/molecules. When nodes and/or biological functions/diseases are colored in tones
of orange, they are predicted to be downstream activated and inhibited when colored in
blue tones. Importantly, the network considers node molecules with more than 10
independent connections with others, suggesting that those molecules might be central
in coronavirus replication. The nearest neighbors of each drug/compound node(s) and
their edges are in bold. Our predictions show that the drugs abiraterone acetate (Figure
4A) and the compounds present in the extract of Hedera helix (Figure 4D) have a potential
downstream inhibitory activity in all nodes related to biological functions and diseases
(colored in blue). Alternatively, for the drugs brequinar (Figure 4B) and neomycin (Figure
4C), the nodes related to cell apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokines production are
predicted to be activated (colored in orange), respectively. The nearest neighbors
(molecules) of each drug/compound node connected directly or indirectly are called focus
molecules. For the drug abiraterone acetate (Figure 4A), we found four focus molecules:
the enzymes cytochrome P450 family 17, subfamily A member 1 (CYP17A1),
transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) and
the androgen receptor (AR). All four nodes are colored in blue, based on literature findings
that show that the drug abiraterone has an inhibitory effect by decreasing their activation

and or expression. For neomycin (Figure 4B) we found eleven focus molecules: the
caspases 8 and 9 (CASP8, CASP9), CXC-motif chemokines 10 and 11 (CXCL10,
CXCL11), interleukin-10, Src family tyrosine kinase (LCK), the mitogen-activated protein
kinases 1 and 3 (MAPK1, MAKPK3), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and reactive oxygen
species (ROS), showing that this drug has a pro-inflammatory activity. Brequinar has
three focus genes; two predicted to be activated, e.g., integrin subunit alpha M (ITGAM)
and Fc-gamma receptor 1 (FcγRI) and one inhibited, the molecular target of brequinar,
the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). For the Hedera helix extract, the
network was built with its eight major components. The 29 focus genes interconnected
with Hedera helix compounds are listed in Table S2. Nevertheless, we could identify a
central node that is interconnected with a significant number of other nodes, the molecule
Furin, which is predicted to be inhibited. Three compounds from the Hedera helix extract
have inhibition activity in this basic-amino-acid-specific peptidase, e.g., hexa-D-arginine,
rutin, and quercetin. Also, Hedera helix compounds showed anti-inflammatory activity, as
all the cytokines in the network are predicted to be inhibited, e.g., Tumor Necrosis Factor
Alpha (TNF), interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), interleukin 6 (IL6).

Discussion

The urgent search for treatments for covid-19 has hastened the repurposing drugs
process and initiation of several clinical tests with drugs with reported in vitro antiviral
activity for SARS-CoV-2 and instigated the approval of expanded access and
compassionate use of these drugs to treat critically ill patients, even if they have not yet
gone through all the steps necessary for specific use for covid-19.

In this report, we describe the use of a cell-based phenotypic screening assay to test the
activity of drugs/compounds against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection with known antiviral
activity or approved for human use. Our assays also included drugs previously tested
against SARS-CoV-2, as a proof of test, like the drug chloroquine, widely used as
antimalarial agents worldwide and described in screenings of FDA-approved drugs as
active agents against different viral infections and recently for SARS-CoV-2. Here we
report in vitro activity and propose chemotherapy candidates for covid-19. Chloroquine
(and its derivative hydroxychloroquine) as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment is still a topic
with much controversy and debate

(29-34)

. Other two antiparasitic drugs, ivermectin and

nitazoxanide have been previously described as having antiviral activity, including for
SARS-CoV-2. Nitazoxanide has been commercialized in Latin America and India for the
treatment of a broad spectrum of intestinal infections. In recent years, nitazoxanide and
its analogs have been proposed as a new class of antiviral agents. Tizoxanide, a
nitazoxanide metabolite, can inhibit the maturation of rotavirus viral protein 7 (VPN)

and the replication of flaviviruses, including dengue serotype 2, Japanese encephalitis,

(42, 43)

. The proposed mechanism of action for ivermectin is to inhibit viral

replication by specifically targeting the activity of non-structural 3 helicase (NS3 helicase)
in vitro

(44)

. The use of ivermectin to treat covid-19 patients was evaluated in an

observational registry-based study involving critically ill SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
The treatment was found to be associated with a lower mortality rate and reduced
healthcare resources use

(41, 45)

. We confirm here that both ivermectin and nitazoxanide

have antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2, but both were non-selective under
these experimental conditions.

Brequinar was identified as the most potent compound with inhibitory activity against
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with EC50 in the submicromolar range. Brequinar was first described
as having antineoplastic properties because of its cytostatic effects on rapidly dividing
cells and also enhance the in vivo antitumor effect of other antineoplastic agents (44). Here
we show in the brequinar network, the nodes related to viral infection as well as the proinflammatory cytokines are predicted to be inhibited. The node related to cell apoptosis
in predicted to be activated, colored in orange. We also identified by network analysis that
brequinar is directly connected with the node for the enzyme dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme responsible for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis.
Brequinar was described as an inhibitor of DHODH, thereby blocking de novo

. In another phenotypic assay conducted under similar conditions as the

one reported herein, we verified that brequinar was active in vitro against the yellow fever
virus (EC50 of 10.5 µM), albeit with lower potency than determined for SARS-CoV-2 herein

(22)

. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be more dependent on pyrimidines

(uridine and cytosine) for its replication, which is in line with the fact that the SARS-CoV2 virus has a high uracil content (52). The DHODH inhibition might slow the SARS-CoV-2
RNA polymerase activity due to the host UTP depletion, thereby affecting viral RNA
replication. Luthra et al. 2018 (53) also demonstrated the brequinar capacity of blocking in
vitro infection by the Ebola virus (EBOV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Zika
(ZIKV). The same work demonstrated that brequinar also exerts antiviral activity through
the induction of expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode for a
variety of antiviral effectors. Hadjadj et al. 2020

(54)

have shown that critically ill covid-19

patients have profoundly impaired type I IFN response, characterized by low IFN
production and activity. Thus, it can be hypothesized that brequinar could also be a strong
candidate to treat covid-19 as it could potentially induce an antiviral response by inducing
ISG expression and restore type I interferon levels.

Abiraterone acetate also showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in our study, confirming recent
previous results from a study that has also demonstrated its activity against SARS-CoV2 in vitro infection

(55)

. Our network analysis showed the potential downstream effects of

the drug abiraterone acetate, and biological function nodes, as well as those related to
viral infection, are predicted to be inhibited by abiraterone acetate. The nodes directly
connected to abiraterone acetate are the enzymes CYP17A1, TMPRSS2, KLK3, and the
androgen receptor (AR). All four nodes are colored in blue, based on literature findings
that show that the drug abiraterone has a downstream inhibitory effect on these
molecules. Abiraterone acetate is a steroidal progesterone derivative with enhanced

bioavailability used to treat refractory prostate cancer, as one of its mechanisms of action
is the inhibition of CYP17A1, a steroidogenic enzyme is up-regulated during the transition
of prostate cancer cell phenotype to hormone-resistant

(56)

. Both nodes, CYP17A1 and

AR, are related in the male sex hormone signaling. A recent study showed a correlation
between increased androgen levels and susceptibility in male covid-19 patients and
showed that inhibition of AR and its ligand is related to decreased angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 protein levels, both enzymes related to SARS-CoV-2
spike-RBD internalization (57). TMPRSS2 is also a node connected to abiraterone acetate,
as androgens and AR

(58)

. A link between the AR, male sex hormones, and covid-19

severity has been proposed (59), and it was shown that abiraterone acetate exerts antiviral
activity during the entry and post-entry events of SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle (55).

We also observed a modest antiviral activity of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin
against SARS-CoV-2. Antibiotics have been reported to inhibit eukaryotic translation

directly, inhibit mitochondrial function

(61-63)

(60,

, and induce changes in mammalian

metabolic pathways. Aminoglycosides have been described to have other activities in
addition to their antibacterial properties (64, 65). Prophylactic application of aminoglycosides
to the nasal or vaginal mucosa of mice was shown to protect the animals from infection
with DNA or RNA viruses (62). Aminoglycosides also induce the mucosal recruitment and
expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in dendritic cells in a Toll-like receptor
3 (TLR3)-dependent manner

(65)

. Neomycin and kanamycin induce ISGs, while others

such as streptomycin and amikacin did not. Interestingly, topical administration also
increased mice survival after intranasal challenge with influenza and reduced viral

shedding after intravaginal challenge with ZIKV virus

(65)

. Our results showed that

neomycin could decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells.

Another interesting finding is that the extract of leaves of Hedera helix (common ivy)
showed antiviral SARS-CoV-2 activity, decreasing the viral load on infected Vero E6 cells
without showing cytotoxicity up to 50 µg/mL. This preparation has been clinically used to
treat cough and showed beneficial effects for the treatment of inflammatory bronchial
diseases (66). Moreover, the extract showed antiviral activity against the enterovirus EV71
C3 (67). In this study, the antiviral activity of hederasaponin B (a significant component of
the extract) against EV71 C3 was verified and related to decreasing cytopathic effect
(CPE) formation. In a mice model of influenza, coadministration of oseltamivir and Hedera
helix extract resulted in increased protection of virus-infected mice, suggesting that
Hedera helix extract enabled mice to overcome influenza virus infection when oseltamivir
was given at sub-efficacious concentrations (68). This combination demonstrated benefits,
including reduced lung inflammation and the potential to remove residual influenza viral
particles. Network prediction analysis has shown that Hedera helix may inhibit FURIN
activity through rutin and quercetin. It was previously shown that the insertion of a FURIN
cleavage site in SARS-CoV, by genome mutation experiments, was responsible for its
increased virulence and high capacity to enter into human lung cells in vitro. A recent
study described that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to
facilitate viral entry into target cells. It was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2
more efficiently than SARS-CoV, increasing transmissibility

(69)

. The ACE2 receptor is

highly expressed in alveolar epithelial type II cells and is found at high levels in many

extrapulmonary tissues. ACE2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system, which
regulates blood pressure. In the Hedera helix treated network, we observed that ACE2 is
predicted to be inhibited. Our data showed that the extract of Hedera helix should be
explored further as a source of antiviral compounds that could be used as adjuvant
therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections. Considering the strong
connections between the flavonoids rutin and quercetin with several elements within the
network associated with antivirus responses, it is relevant to highlight that not only H.
helix but also other species displaying both flavonoids are used against influenza as folk
medicine. Like H. helix, some species from the genus Micania (popularly known in Brazil
as guaco and also sold in popular markets) displays quercetin in its composition (70) and
are widely used in the country to treat colds, flu, and asthma, especially in poor rural and
urban settings.

Conclusion

A combination of phenotypic screening and network analysis provided new insights and
starting points for the clinical evaluation and repurposing of drugs to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
infection and treat covid-19 patients at different disease stages. We have identified two
drugs with potent and selective antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, brequinar
and abiraterone acetate, and two drugs with moderate activity, neomycin, and the extract
of Hedera helix, that could be further explored as therapeutic adjuvants or as starting
points for drug discovery for covid-19.

Antiviral activity is shown in the black curves, and cytotoxic activity is shown in red curves.
Data points are mean values, and bars are the standard deviation of two independent
experiments. Images of infection in the presence of different compound concentrations
for each compound, with SARS-CoV-2 stained in green (shown in upper and lower
panels) and cell nuclei in blue (shown only in upper panels).

Figure 4- Drug/compound-host molecules-biological function-disease-networks.
Networks built with the drugs abiraterone acetate (A), neomycin (B), brequinar sodium
(C), and the main compounds found in the Hedera helix extract e.g. hexa-D-arginine,
rutin, quercetin, hederagenin, nicotiflorin, kaempferol, stigmasterol and alpha-hederin (D).
The presence of these drug/compounds has a potential inhibition or activation effect on
the network molecules, colored in blue and orange, respectively. The gray-colored nodes
represent molecules without the predicted activation state. Nodes have different shapes
representing their different classification, type.
