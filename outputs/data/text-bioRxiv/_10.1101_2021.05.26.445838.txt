Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage emerged in October 2020 in India

1-6

. It has since then become

dominant in some indian regions and further spread to many countries. The lineage includes three
main subtypes (B1.617.1, B.1617.2 and B.1.617.3), which harbour diverse Spike mutations in the Nterminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) which may increase their immune
evasion potential. B.1.617.2 is believed to spread faster than the other versions. Here, we isolated
infectious B.1.617.2 from a traveller returning from India. We examined its sensitivity to monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) and to antibodies present in sera from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or
vaccine recipients, in comparison to other viral lineages. B.1.617.2 was resistant to neutralization by
some anti-NTD and anti-RBD mAbs, including Bamlanivimab, which were impaired in binding to the
B.1.617.2 Spike. Sera from convalescent patients collected up to 12 months post symptoms and from
Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine recipients were 3 to 6 fold less potent against B.1.617.2, relative to B.1.1.7.
Sera from individuals having received one dose of AstraZeneca Vaxzevria barely inhibited B.1.617.2.
Thus, B.1.617.2 spread is associated with an escape to antibodies targeting non-RBD and RBD Spike
epitopes.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) with mutations increasing inter-individual transmission or
allowing immune evasion have supplanted ancestral strains 7-10. While the mutations have arisen in
different viral proteins, of particular interest is the Spike protein, which promotes viral binding to the
ACE2 receptor, mediates viral fusion and entry, and is targeted by neutralizing antibodies 10,11. The first
identified variant included the D614G mutation which enhanced viral infectivity

7,10,12

. VOC then

appeared in multiple countries. The B.1.1.7 variant was first identified in the UK, B.1.351 in South Africa
and the P.1 lineage in Brazil 7-10,13-15. They harbour mutations that enhance Spike affinity to ACE2, such
as N501Y, which is present in the three variants and K417N/T found in B.1.351 and P.1 10,16-21. Antibody
escape mutations in the RBD include E484K found in B.1.351 and P.1 10,16-21. Another variant termed
B.1.247/B.1.429 was originally detected in California. It lacks the E484K substitution and carries a
different set of mutations in the NTD (S13I, W152C) and RBD (L452R). The L452R mutation reduces or
abolishes neutralization by some monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or sera from convalescent persons or
vaccine recipients 22-25.
Neutralizing antibodies also target non-RBD Spike epitopes, particularly in the NTD 26. The role of the
NTD during viral entry is not fully understood. It has been proposed to recognize sugar moieties upon
initial binding and might be involved in pre-fusion to post-fusion transition of the Spike 27. Some mAbs
targeting the NTD may exhibit high neutralization potency without preventing Spike binding to ACE2

. These non-RBD antibodies are highly prevalent and may represent more than 80% of the anti-

Spike IgG response, even if 90% of the neutralizing activity targets the RBD 17,27. VOC contain changes
in the NTD that have been associated with antibody escape 10,26,28. These NTD modifications include
the 69-70 and 144-145 deletions in B.1.1.7, the 241-243 deletion and R246I in B.1.351, W152C in
B.1.429, and L18F substitution in a small proportion of B.1.351 and P.1 10,26,28.
India is facing a large surge in COVID-19 cases since early 2021. Many cases are caused by a new
lineage, termed B.1.617

1-6

. The epidemiology data are scarce, but B.1.617 has become the

predominant strain in the state of Maharashtra and probably in other Indian regions 4. It has also been
detected in many countries including UK. This lineage is under evolution and has been subdivided into
three main sublineages, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3

29

The B.1.617.2 sublineage has been

recently classified as a VOC, since it is believed to be more transmissible than the two other sublineages. Recent pre-prints reported a reduced sensitivity of B.1.617 to certain monoclonal and
polyclonal antibodies 1-6,30. Experiments were so far mostly performed with single-cycle pseudotyped
viral particles, and very little is known about the sensitivity of replicative B.1.617.2 to the humoral
immune response.
Here, we assessed the sensitivity of an authentic B.1.617.2 isolate to various mAbs targeting the NTD
and the RBD of the Spike, including 4 clinically approved therapeutic antibodies. We also examined the
neutralization potency of sera from convalescent individuals and vaccine recipients, demonstrating
that the variant has indeed acquired a degree of resistance to them.

Results
Isolation and characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 variant
We isolated the B.1.617.2 variant from a nasopharyngeal swab of a symptomatic individual, a few days
upon his return to France from India. The virus was amplified by two passages on Vero E6 cells.
Sequences of the swab and the outgrown virus were identical and identified the B.1.617.2 variant
(GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_2029113) (Fig. 1a). In particular, the Spike protein contained 9
mutations, when compared to the D614G strain (belonging to the basal B.1 lineage) used here as a
reference, including five mutations in the NTD (T19R, G142D, Δ156, Δ157, R158G), two in the RBD
(L452R, T478K), one mutation close to the furin cleavage site (P681R) and one in the S2 region (D950N)
(Fig. 1a). Viral stocks were titrated using S-Fuse reporter cells and Vero cells

21,31

. S-Fuse cells are

convenient for rapid viral titration and measurement of neutralizing antibodies. They generate a GFP
signal as soon as 6 hours post infection and the number of GFP+ cells correlates with the viral inoculum
31 21

. Viral titers were similar in the two target cells and reached 105 to 106 infectious units/ml. Large

syncytia were observed in B.1.617.2-infected Vero and S-Fuse cells (Fig. S1). As expected, the syncytia

were positive for Spike staining (Fig. S1). Future work will help determining whether B.1.617.2 is more
fusogenic than D614G or other variants, as suggested here by the large size of B.1.617.2-induced
syncytia.
Phylogenetic analysis of the B.1.617 lineage
To contextualize the B.1.617.2 isolate reported here, we inferred a global phylogeny subsampling the
diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available on the GISAID EpiCoV database (Fig. 1). The B.1.617
lineage, subdivided into three sublineages according to the PANGO classification 32, derives from the
B.1 lineage (D614G). All three sublineages present multiple changes in the Spike, including the L452R
substitution in the RBD, already seen in B.1.429 and the P681R, located in the furin cleavage site and
which may enhance the fusogenic activity of the Spike. The E484Q, which may be functionally similar
to the antibody-escape mutation E484K found in B.1.351 and P.1, is present in both B.1.617.1 and
B.1.617.3, and appears to have reverted in the rapidly growing B.1.617.2 sublineage, as it was present
in a sequence (B.1.617) ancestral to the three sublineages (Fig. 1a,b) 29. Whether the absence of the
E484Q mutation, the presence of the T478K mutation or other changes in the Spike or the rest of the
genome may facilitate viral replication and transmissibility remains unknown. Interestingly, the
B.1.617 lineage is not homogeneous, with multiple mutations fixed in a sublineage (e.g. Spike:T19R,
G142D or D950N) that are also detected at lower frequencies in the other sublineages. This may reflect
founder effects or similar selective pressures acting on these emerging variants.
Mutational changes in B.1.617.2
Upon inspection, the locations of the spike mutations in the B.1.617.2 variant showed a similar overall
distribution to those that appeared in other VOC. In particular, in addition to the D614G mutation
common to all current strains, the D950N mutation mapped to the trimer interface (Fig. 2a), suggesting
a potential contribution in regulating Spike dynamics, as has been shown with the D614G mutation 10.
As with other VOC, a number of mutations in B.1.617.2 cluster in the NTD (Fig. 2b). The 156-157
deletion and G158R mutation map to the same surface as the 144 deletion in B.1.1.7 and the 241-243
deletion in B.1.351. Similarly, the T19R maps to the surface patch that has several mutations in B.1.1.7.
Importantly, all these altered residues lie in the NTD “supersite” that is the target of the most potently
anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies 28. In the RBD, examining the distribution of all mutations appearing
in VOC detected so far indicates that they all map to the periphery of the ACE2 binding surface (Fig.
2c), suggesting that the virus accumulates mutations there in order to reduce or avoid antibody binding
while maintaining binding to ACE2. For instance, the L452R mutation found in B.1.617.2 impairs
neutralization by antibodies

22 23,24 25

and is located at this periphery. The only mutation within the

ACE2 patch is at location 501, which increases the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 and is also involved in

antibody escape 10 33 34. The RBD mutation T478K in the RBD is unique to B.1.617.2 and falls within the
epitope region of potent neutralizing mAbs categorized as “Class 1” (Fig. 2c)

35

. This mutation at

location 478 is in proximity of the well characterized E484K mutation known to facilitate antibody
escape 10. These observations prompted us to analyze the neutralization potential of well characterized
monoclonal antibodies, as well as sera from convalescents and vaccinees, against the B.1.617.2
variant.
Neutralization of B.1.617.2 by monoclonal antibodies
We assessed the sensitivity of B.1.617.2 to a panel of human mAbs using the S-Fuse assay. We tested
four clinically approved antibodies, Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555), Etesevimab (LY-CoV016), Casirivimab
(REGN10933) and Imdevimab (REGN10987) targeting the RBD 20,36 as well as four other anti-RBD (RBD48, RBD-85, RBD-98 and RBD-109) and four anti-NTD (NTD-18, NTD-20, NTD-69 and NTD-71) antibodies
that were derived from convalescent individuals (Planchais et al, in preparation). Neutralizing antiSARS-CoV-2 mAbs targeting the RBD can be classified into 4 main categories depending on their
binding epitope 35,37. RBD-48 and RBD-85 belong to the first category (“Class 1”) and act by blocking
binding of the “up” conformation of RBD to ACE2 35. The precise epitopes of RBD-98 and RBD-109 are
not yet defined but overlap with those of RBD-48 and RBD-85. The anti-NTD antibodies bind
uncharacterized epitopes within this domain, as assessed by Elisa (not shown).
We first measured the potency of the four therapeutic antibodies against B.1.617.2, and included as a
comparison D614G (B.1), B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains. The four antibodies neutralized D614G, with IC50
varying from 1.2 x 10-3 to 6.5 x 10-2 µg/mL (Fig. 3a). They were active against B.1.1.7, with the exception
of Etesivimab, which displayed a 200-fold increase of IC50 against this variant. As previously reported,
Bamlanivimab and Etesivimab did not neutralize B.1.351

38 39

. Bamlanivimab lost antiviral activity

against B.1.617.2, in line with previous results demonstrating that L452R is an escape mutation for this
mAb 25 22. Etesivimab, Casirivimab and Imdevimab remained active against B.1.617.2 (Fig. 3a).
The four other anti-RBD mAbs neutralized D614G. The IC50 of RBD-48 and RBD-98 were about 15-100fold higher with B.1.1.7 than with D614G, whereas RBD-85 displayed increased activity against B.1.1.7.
Three out of the four mAbs inhibited B.1.617.2, whereas RBD-85 was inactive (Fig. 3a). The four antiNTD mAbs were globally less efficient than the anti-RBD mAbs. They all inhibited D614G, with high
IC50 (1-60 µg/mL) (Fig. 3a). Three out of the four anti-NTD antibodies totally lost any activity against
both B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2, whereas the fourth (NTD-18) inhibited to some extent the two variants.
Thus, B.1.617.2 escapes neutralization by some antibodies targeting either the RBD or NTD.
We next examined by flow cytometry the binding of each antibody to Vero cells infected with the
different variants. An example of binding with two therapeutic antibodies (Bamlanivimab and
Imdevinab) and one anti-RBD antibody (RBD-85) is depicted in Fig. S3. Radar plots show the binding of

all antibodies tested (Fig. 3b). D614G was recognized by all 12 mAbs tested. B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 were
recognized by 9 and 7 mAb, respectively. Bamlanivimab no longer bound B.1.617.2. We also analyzed
the binding of the 12 mAbs to the B.1.351 variant, which is known to be more resistant to
neutralization. Only 5 of the antibodies bound this variant, whereas Bamlanivimab and Etesivimab lost
their binding to B.1.351 (Fig. 3b). Altogether, these results indicate that the escape of B.1.617.2 and
other variants to neutralization is due to a reduction or loss of binding of the antibodies to their target.
Sensitivity of B.1.617.2 to sera from convalescent individuals at 6 and 12 months post-infection
We examined the neutralization ability of sera from convalescent subjects. We first selected samples
from 56 donors in a cohort of infected individuals from the French city of Orléans. All individuals were
diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR or serology and included critical, severe, and mildto-moderate COVID-19 cases (Table S1). They were not vaccinated at the sampling time. We recently
characterized the potency of these sera against D614G, B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 21. We analyzed individuals
sampled at a median of 188 days (range 114-205), referred to as Month 6 (M6) samples. We incubated
serially diluted sera with B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.2 strains, added the mixture to S-Fuse cells, and scored
GFP+ cells after overnight infection. We then calculated ED50 (Effective Dose 50%) for each
combination of serum and virus (Fig. 4a). With B.1.1.7, we obtained similar ED50 values in this series
of experiments (median of 811) than in our previous analysis (median of 761) 21. This allowed us to
compare the variants together across different experiments. With B.1.617.2, the neutralization titers
were significantly decreased by 4 to 6-fold when compared to D614G and B.1.1.7 strains, respectively
(Fig. 4a). This reduction in neutralizing titers was similar against B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 (Fig. 4a).
We asked whether this neutralization profile was maintained for longer periods of time. We analyzed
sera from 48 individuals from another cohort of RT-qPCR-confirmed health care workers from
Strasbourg University Hospitals who experienced mild disease 40-42. The samples were collected at a
later time point (M12), with a median of 330 days (range 144-383) POS (Table S1) 42. We compared
their potency against B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 strains. Twenty seven individuals were unvaccinated,
whereas 21 received a single dose of vaccine 7-81 days before sampling. As previously reported, the
neutralization activity against B.1.1.7 was globally low at M12 in unvaccinated individuals 42 (Fig. 4a).
The neutralizing activity was even lower against B.1.617.2 at this time point, with a median ED50 of
25, representing a 6-fold decrease when compared to B.1.1.7 (Fig. 3a). The 13 single-dose vaccine
recipients of the M12 cohort included 9 vaccinated with AstraZeneca, 9 with Pfizer and 3 with Moderna
vaccines. Sera from these vaccinated participants showed a 130-fold increase in the median
neutralizing antibody titer against both B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 (Fig. 3b). Therefore, our results extend
previous results obtained with other variants, showing that a single dose of vaccine boosts crossneutralizing antibody responses 17,42-45.

We then classified the cases as neutralizers (defined as harboring neutralizing antibodies detectable
at the first serum dilution of 1/30) and non-neutralizers, for the different viral variants and the two
cohorts (Fig. 4b). Between 76% and 92% of the individuals neutralized the four strains at M6. The
fraction of neutralizers was lower in the second cohort at M12, a phenomenon which was particularly
marked for B.1.617.2., 89% of individuals neutralized B.1.1.7 and only 48% neutralized B.1.617.2 (Fig.
4b). After vaccination, 100% and 95% of convalescent individuals neutralized B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2,
respectively (Fig. 4b).
Altogether, these results indicate that B.1.617.2 displays enhanced resistance to neutralization by sera
from convalescent individuals, particularly one year after infection.
Sensitivity of B.1.617.2 to sera from vaccine recipients
We next asked whether vaccine-elicited antibodies neutralized B.1.617.2, in individuals that were not
previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. We thus selected 28 individuals from a cohort of vaccinated
health care workers established in Orléans. The characteristics of vaccinees are depicted in Table S2.
16 individuals received the Pfizer vaccine. Sera were sampled at week 8 (W8) (16 individuals,
corresponding to week 5 after the second dose) and W16 (13 individuals, corresponding to week 13
after the second dose). 12 individuals received the AstraZeneca vaccine. In France, vaccination with
Vaxzevria started on February 2021. We were thus only able to test individuals that received a single
dose of this vaccine. Their sera were sampled at W10 after administration. This allowed us to assess
the early humoral response to vaccination. We measured the potency of the sera against D614G,
B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 (Fig. 4c).
With the Pfizer vaccine, at W8, we observed a 3-fold and 16-fold reduction in the neutralization titers
against B.1.617.2 and B.1.351, respectively, when compared to B.1.1.7 (Fig. 4c). Similar differences
between strains were observed at a later time point (W16), although titers were globally slightly lower
globally (Fig. 4c). The situation was different with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which induced particularly
low levels of antibodies neutralizing B.1.617.2 and B.1.351, when compared to D.614G and B.1.1.7 (Fig.
4c).
We also classified the vaccine recipients as neutralizers (with neutralizing antibodies detectable at
1/30 dilution) and non-neutralizers, for the four viral strains (Fig. 4c,d). With the Pfizer vaccine, most
of the individuals (81 to 100%) neutralized any of the four stains at W8. This fraction remained stable
at W16, with the exception of B.1.351, which was neutralized by only 46% of the individuals. 75% and
83% of individuals that received the Astrazeneca vaccine neutralized the D614G and B.1.17 strains,
respectively. This fraction sharply dropped with B.1.351 and B.617.2, which were inhibited by only 8%
of the sera. Therefore, the Pfizer vaccine generated a neutralizing response that efficiently targeted
the four viral strains, whereas a single dose of AstraZeneca vaccine triggered a neutralizing response

against D614G and B.1.1.7 but was either poorly or not at all efficient against B.1.351 and B.617.2.
These results are in line with the real-world efficacy of the two vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine is known
to be protective against asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, including severe diseases, induced
by B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, as described for instance in the UK, Israel and South Africa 46-48 In contrast, the
efficacy of a two-dose regimen of AstraZeneca against mild-to-moderate disease dropped to 10% in
South Africa, where the B.1.351 variant circulates 49. Altogether, our results suggest that a single dose
of AstraZeneca vaccine will not display an optimal protection against B.1.617.2.
Discussion
After one year of an intense circulation of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, VOCs with enhanced transmissibility
and resistance to antibodies were first identified in UK, South Africa, Brazil, USA (California) and spread
to many other countries. Since early 2021, India has also faced a surge of cases associated with the
emergence of a new lineage termed B.1.617. It includes 3 main sublineages, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and
B.1.617.3. Very little is known about the epidemiological and biological characteristics of this lineage.
B.1.617.2 seems to be particularly worrying, and has been deemed a VOC by multiple public health
bodies including the WHO. It represents up to 80% of sequenced strains in the Maharashtra region of
India 4. B.1.617.2 has also been detected in dozens of other countries and represented about 20% of
sequenced viruses circulating in UK between May 12 and May 19, 2021 50. B.1.617.2 is characterized
by the presence of 9 mutations in the Spike protein. We show here that these mutations map to
regions of the Spike that potentially modify virus binding to the receptor and allow escape from the
humoral immune response. Our results highlight the way the virus evolves in the face of herd
immunity: it modifes the sensitive ACE2 binding surface at its periphery to escape antibody recognition
while still efficiently interacting with ACE2. Furthermore, our preliminary experiment showed the
presence of large syncytia in B.1.617.2 infected cells. Future work will help understanding whether the
mutations modify the kinetics of viral fusion and improve B.1.617.2 fitness.
We studied here the cross-reactivity of mAbs to pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 viruses, sera from long-term
convalescent individuals and recent vaccine recipients against B.1.617.2. We used an authentic clinical
viral isolate, rather than pseudovirus particles, to assess viral sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. We
report that some therapeutic mAb, including Bamlavinimab, lost binding to the variant Spike and no
longer neutralized B.1.617.2. It is thus of importance to identify the viral strain present in patients,
before administration of therapeutic mAbs in individuals at-risk for severe forms of COVID-19. We
further show that B.1.617.2 is less sensitive to sera from naturally immunized individuals. The
convalescent sera sampled at M6 displayed a four-fold decrease in their efficacy against B.1.617.2, as
compared to B.1.1.7. This extent of decrease is similar to that observed with B.1.351, another VOC. In
a second cohort of convalescent individuals sampled later (M12), this process was more marked, with

a 6-fold ED50 decrease between B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7. However, vaccination of convalescent
individuals boosted the humoral immune response against all variants by more than 130-fold, well
above the threshold of neutralization. These results strongly suggest that vaccination of previously
infected individuals will be most likely protective against a large array of circulating viral strains,
including B.1.617.2.
We report that a two-dose regimen of the Pfizer vaccine generated high sero-neutralization levels
against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 in individuals that were not previously infected with SARS-CoV2, when sampled at W8 and W16 post vaccination. We also tested sera from individuals that received
a single dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. At W10, 75% of the sera neutralized B.1.1.7, but less than
10% of the sera neutralized B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. Neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of
immune protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection

51

. Our results are in line with the

negligible efficacy of a two-dose regimen of AstraZeneca vaccine against B.1.351 49. A recent report
analyzing data on all sequenced symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate the
impact of vaccination on infection with B.1.617.2 compared to B.1.1.7 52. Effectiveness was notably
lower with B.1.617.2 (33.5%) than with B.1.1.7 (51 %) after 1 dose of AstraZeneca vaccine. The twodose effectiveness against B.1.617.2 was estimated to be 60% and 88% for Astrazeneca and Pfizer
vaccines, respectively

52

. Our neutralization experiments indicate that Astrazeneca vaccine-elicited

antibodies are less potent against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 than those induced by the Pfizer vaccine.
Potential limitations of our work include a relatively low number of vaccine recipients analyzed and
the absence of samples from individuals that received two-doses of AstraZeneca vaccine. We have not
analyzed the impact of cellular immunity, which may display higher cross-reactivity than the humoral
response. Future work with more individuals and longer survey periods will help characterize the role
of humoral responses in vaccine efficacy against the panel of circulating variants.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the novel emerging B.617.2 variant partially but
significantly escapes neutralizing antibodies targeting the NTD and RBD, and polyclonal antibodies
elicited by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.

Methods
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized
and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Our

individuals with different disease severities, and 30 non-infected healthy controls is on-going, aiming
to describe the persistence of specific and neutralizing antibodies over a 24-months period. This study
was approved by the ILE DE FRANCE IV ethical committee. At enrolment, written informed consent
was collected and participants completed a questionnaire which covered sociodemographic
characteristics, virological findings (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, including date of testing), clinical data
(date of symptom onset, type of symptoms, hospitalization), and data related to anti-SARS-CoV-2
vaccination if ever (brand product, date of first and second vaccination). Serological status of
participants was assessed every 3 months. Those who underwent anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination had
weekly blood and nasal sampling after first dose of vaccine for a 2 months period (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT04750720). For the present study, we selected 56 convalescent and 28 vaccinated
participants (16 with Pfizer and 12 with AstraZeneca). Study participants did not receive any
compensation.
Strasbourg Cohort of convalescent individuals. Since April 2020, a prospective, interventional,
monocentric, longitudinal, cohort clinical study enrolling 308 RT-PCR-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected
hospital staff from the Strasbourg University Hospitals is on-going (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT04441684). At enrolment (from April 17, 2020), written informed consent was collected and
participants completed a questionnaire which covered sociodemographic characteristics, virological
findings (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results including date of testing) and clinical data (date of symptom onset,
type of symptoms, hospitalization). This study was approved by Institutional Review Board of
Strasbourg University Hospital. The serological status of the participants has been described at Months
3 (M3) and Months 6 (M6) POS 40,41. Laboratory identification of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at least
10 days before inclusion by RT-PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimens according to current
guidelines (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France; WHO technical guidance). The assay targets two regions of
the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene with a threshold of detection of 10 copies per
reaction. For the present study, we randomly selected 48 patients collected at M12 (27 unvaccinated
and 21 vaccinated). Study participants did not receive any compensation.

Phylogenetic analysis. All SARS-CoV-2 sequences available on the GISAID EpiCov™ database 53 as of
May 21, 2021 were retrieved. A subset of complete and high coverage sequences, as indicated in
GISAID, assigned to lineages B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, B.1.617.3 were randomly subsampled to contain up
to 5 sequences per country and epidemiological week in R with packages tidyverse and lubridate.
Together with a single B.1.617 sequence this subset was included in the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny
reconstructed with augur and visualized with auspice as implemented in the Nextstrain pipeline

. Within Nextstrain, a random

subsampling approach capping a maximum number of sequences per global region was used for the
contextual non-B.1.617 sequences. The acknowledgment of contributing and originating laboratories
for all sequences used in the analysis is provided in Table S3.

. Cells were tested negative for

mycoplasma. Cells were mixed (ratio 1:1) and plated at 8x103 per well in a μClear 96-well plate (Greiner
Bio-One). The indicated SARS-CoV-2 strains were incubated with mAb, sera or nasal swabs at the
indicated concentrations or dilutions for 15 minutes at room temperature and added to S-Fuse cells.
The nasal swabs and sera were heat-inactivated 30 min at 56°C before use. 18 hours later, cells were
fixed with 2% PFA, washed and stained with Hoechst (dilution 1:1,000, Invitrogen). Images were
acquired with an Opera Phenix high content confocal microscope (PerkinElmer). The GFP area and the
number of nuclei were quantified using the Harmony software (PerkinElmer). The percentage of
neutralization was calculated using the number of syncytia as value with the following formula: 100 x
(1 – (value with serum – value in “non-infected”)/(value in “no serum” – value in “non-infected”)).
Neutralizing activity of each serum was expressed as the half maximal effective dilution (ED50). ED50
values (in µg/ml for mAbs and in dilution values for sera) were calculated with a reconstructed curve
using the percentage of the neutralization at the different concentrations. We previously reported a
correlation between neutralization titers obtained with the S-Fuse assay and a pseudovirus
neutralization assay 56.
Clinical history of the patient infected with B.1.617.2. A 54-year-old man was admitted April, 27, 2021
in the Emergency department of the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou hospital in Paris, France, for
an acute respiratory distress syndrome with fever. He had no medical background, and came back
from India (West Bengali and few days spent in Delhi) 10 days before (April, 17 2021), where he stayed
15 days for his work. Onset of symptoms (abdominal pain and fever) was approximately April 18, 2021.
The nasopharyngeal swab was positive SARS-CoV-2 at his date of admission. Lung tomo-densitometry
showed a mild (10-25%) COVID pneumonia without pulmonary embolism. He initially received oxygen
therapy 2 L/min, dexamethasone 6mg/day and enoxaparin 0,4 ml twice a day. His respiratory state

worsened on day 3 (April 30, 2021 ). He was transferred in an intensive care unit, where he received
high flow oxygen therapy (maximum 12 L/min). His respiratory condition improved, and he was
transferred back in a conventional unit on day 8 (May 5, 2021). He was discharged from hospital on
day 15 (May 10, 2021).
Virus strains. The reference D614G strain (hCoV-19/France/GE1973/2020) was supplied by the
National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) and
headed by Pr. S. van der Werf. This viral strain was supplied through the European Virus Archive goes
Global (Evag) platform, a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020
research and innovation program under grant agreement n° 653316. The variant strains were isolated
from nasal swabs on Vero cells and amplified by one or two passages on Vero cells. B.1.1.7 originated
from a patient in Tours (France) returning from United Kingdom. B.1.351 (hCoV-19/France/IDFIPP00078/2021) originated from a patient in Creteil (France). B.1.617.2 was isolated from a
nasopharyngeal swab of a hospitalized patient returning from India. The swab was provided and
sequenced by the laboratory of Virology of Hopital Européen Georges Pompidou (Assistance Publique
– Hopitaux de Paris). Both patients provided informed consent for the use of the biological materials.
Titration of viral stocks was performed on Vero E6, with a limiting dilution technique allowing a
calculation of TCID50, or on S-Fuse cells. Viruses were sequenced directly on nasal swabs, and after
one or two passages on Vero cells. Sequences were deposited on GISAID immediately after their
generation, with the following IDs: D614G: EPI_ISL_414631; B.1.1.7: EPI_ISL_735391; B.1.1.351:
EPI_ISL_964916; B.1.617.2: ID: EPI_ISL_2029113.
Flow Cytometry. Vero cells with the indicated viral strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1.
Two days after, cells were detached using PBS-EDTA and transferred into U-bottom 96-well plates
(50,000 cell/well). Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 15-30 min at RT. Cells were then incubated for 15-30
min at RT with the indicated mAbs (1 µg/mL) in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% sodium azide, and 0.05% Saponin.
Cells were washed with PBS, and stained using anti-IgG AF647 (1:600 dilution) (ThermoFisher). Data
were acquired on an Attune Nxt instrument (Life Technologies). Stainings were also performed on
control uninfected cells. Results were analysed with FlowJo 10.7.1 (Becton Dickinson).
Antibodies. The four therapeutic antibodies were kindly provided by CHR Orleans. Human anti-SARSCoV2 mAbs were cloned from S-specific blood memory B cells of Covid19 convalescents (Planchais et
al, manuscript in preparation). Recombinant human IgG1 mAbs were produced by co-transfection of
Freestyle 293-F suspension cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described 57 and purified by
affinity chromatography using protein G sepharose 4 fast flow beads (GE Healthcare).
