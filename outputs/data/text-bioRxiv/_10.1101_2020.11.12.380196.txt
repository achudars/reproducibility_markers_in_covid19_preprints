Abstract: Personal protective equipment (PPE) remains in short supply. Current
decontamination methods are complex, slow, expensive and particularly ill-suited for low to
middle income nations where the need is greatest. We propose a low temperature, ambient
humidity decontamination method (WASP-D) based on the thirty minute or less half-life of SarsCoV-2 (and other common pathogens) at temperatures above 45°C, combined with the
observation that most PPE are designed to be safely transported and stored at temperatures
below 50°C. Decontamination at 12 hours, 46°C (115°F) and ambient humidity should
consistently reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load by a factor of 10-6, without negatively affecting PPE
materials or performance.
Introduction:
In the midst of a pandemic, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) are a critical line of first
defense. Even before vaccines and treatments are developed, PPE limits the spread of disease
and protects the lives of vital healthcare workers. Unfortunately, PPE manufacturing capacity
and stockpiles persistently lag demand, resulting in needless deaths and severe economic
disruption. Despite best efforts to expand capacity, this PPE access gap continues in developed
economies with strong healthcare systems and is exacerbated in low to middle income nations
(LMIN)1.
One potential stop-gap measure is to safely and effectively decontaminate disposable PPE for
re-use. A small cohort of methods have been evaluated and approved for use by the CDC and
WHO for N95 masks (knowledge here is rapidly evolving- see N95Decon.org or the CDC2 for
current information). These include UV-C irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, dry and
moist heat3.
While viable, these methods fail to work uniformly on all brands of PPE4, require costly
electronics/pumps /renewables and maintenance, or do not scale to high capacity. For
example, UV-C is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, but cannot penetrate into the shadows of
folded PPE which may harbor viable pathogens. Some UV systems produce ozone which breaks
down5 plastic surfaces. Chemical treatment such as peroxide vapor is both toxic and requires
specialized equipment and staff to operate at large scale. To avoid inadvertent hightemperature thermal degradation from exposed 1500°F electric-heating elements, moist heat
(60% RH and 165°F/74°C) ovens must be specially designed to block infra-red radiation6. High

heat also softens elastomeric straps, which may not return to their original taut lengths, or may
reduce the material’s ultimate tear strength.
N95 masks, in particular, contain an inner layer that is electrostatically charged to enhance
particle collection efficiency without impacting breathability. This layer is easily neutralized by
many wet sanitizers, such as soap and water or autoclaving, making re-use impossible. Other
PPE, such as gowns or face shields, can be decontaminated in liquid disinfectants, though may
be damaged by physical impact and the process itself is highly labor intensive.
Our goal is to devise and test an accessible decontamination protocol suited for LMIN7. We are
seeking a decontamination, not a sterilization, methodology. The key metric is reducing viral
burden and associated clinic or hospital pathogens to manageable levels. We recognize that
some pathogens, e.g. mesophiles such as Listeria8 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA)9, have an active growth rate upper temperature bound that just extends into
the WASP-D range. And that no lab test, including this study and associated literature studies,
can eliminate the possibility of post-WASP-D decontamination re-contamination. But we also
note the world is filled with pathogens- every breath10 we take inhales e-coli, clostridium
botulinum and various actinobacteria, along with air pollution and other toxic fumes. Reduction
from harm, not elimination of all possible risks, is the goal in a pandemic.
Such a protocol would ideally meet the following criteria:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Achieve at least 106 reduction in common disease pathogens.
Inexpensive.
Work on all brands and all types of PPE without damage.
Tolerant of intermittent power outages.
Constructed locally.
Minimize training to operate.
Fail-soft.

Simply “waiting” at room temperature has been demonstrated to reduce SARS-CoV-2 by three
orders of magnitude over seven days11. However, according to the CDC, six orders of magnitude
reduction is typically required for safe re-use12. Characteristically, pathogens exhibit a
thermally activated degradation rate, but the literature contains few reliable measurements of
warm temperature viral inhibition. Pathogen half-life depends on a number of external factors,
including temperature, humidity, exposure to light (particularly UV), encasing media (e.g. saliva,

mucous, water, …) and substrate13 (metal, plastic, mesh, air ..). While Sars-CoV-2 research
continues to advance, literature results to-date indicate a factor of four or more variation14 in
half-life depending on these external factors. Thus, any practical system must err on the side of
caution regarding temperature and humidity.
The purpose of our study is to determine if low-temperature warming of viruses can achieve a
six-order of magnitude viral load reduction. Here we test the ability of low-temperature
warming to inactivate two surrogate viruses – bovine coronavirus, a beta coronavirus, like SARSCoV-2 (enveloped) that infects cattle, and MS-2, a small, non-enveloped virus that infects E.coli.
By far the simplest solution would be a combination of time and warm heat at ambient
humidity- Warm And Slow Pathogen-Decontamination, or WASP-D. In WASP-D, PPE are placed
in a large closed room or container. Warm heat (43°C-50°C=110°F-122°F, nominally 46°C as a
safety factor) and ambient air ventilation are introduced for 12 hours, following the protocol at
https://www.protocols.io/view/wasp-d-field-protocol-bkcskswe . After 12 hours, the amount of
infectious virus is reduced by a factor of 106.
Effective, universal, low-tech, scalable and no consumables.
WASP-D Parameter Choices:
There are three key parameters in this study. First, the choice of warm heat at 43°C-50°C.
Second, a relative humidity characteristic of affected communities. And third, a pathogen
reduction of 106 or greater. Decontamination cycle time is a dependent variable necessary to
achieve the above objectives.
Warm temperatures: Most PPE are manufactured from plastic. For example, melt spun
polypropylene for the N95 electrostatic filter or high-density polyethylene in a Tyvek body suit.
Cellulosic padding, natural or thermoplastic elastomers and small metal snaps may be part of
the design. In addition, proprietary hydrophilic coatings to repel blood or bodily fluids, antimicrobials and a host of unknown and transient features may be present. Each material will
experience its own specific thermally activated failure mechanism and degradation pathways.
Testing every brand of PPE is impractical. However, almost all PPE are intended to be shipped
from manufacturer to end-user. Like most products, they are designed to withstand standard

shipping and storage conditions. Experimental studies15 of containerized shipping containers
and trucks indicate 50°C is a typical upper bound (with rare excursions to 60°C - note at higher
temperatures, such as 70°C, N95 masks degrade16). Consistent with these findings, many
product companies (including 3M for N95 masks17) recommend 50°C as the maximum safe
storage and shipping temperature. While conservative (some PPE are more accepting of higher
temperatures, and future decontamination-grade PPE may be more heat tolerant), we chose
50°C or below as likely to preserve PPE efficacy across all commercial products, irrespective of
designs.
Humidity: To avoid the cost and complexity of humidity-controlled ovens, the WASP-D protocol
draws in ambient air to gently ventilate the heated storage/decontamination chamber. Since
the chamber is hotter than ambient, and hot air can “hold” higher levels of moisture and the
relative humidity declines. Ventilation also dries out sweat, limiting mold and fungal growth.
But until dried out, evaporative cooling lowers18 PPE surface temperature, so the protocol
compensates by extending the decontamination cycle.
Climate varies widely across the globe, so we considered three limiting cases- Boston, Rio de
Janeiro and Lagos. By holding the partial pressure of ambient humidity constant as it warms to
ventilate the chamber, we find:

For our initial experiments, we chose 22%RH (@43°C) as a representative average.
There is some evidence19 ambient humidity levels under certain conditions are protective to
the virus, especially when the virus is contained in a saliva droplet. Again, WASP-D incorporates
additional time as a “guard-band” in compensation.

Pathogen Reduction: For safety and expediency, bovine coronavirus, a beta coronavirus like
SARS-CoV-2, and MS-2 were chosen as surrogate viruses. As the EPA notes, “According to this
hierarchy, if an antimicrobial product can kill a small, non-enveloped virus it should be able
to kill any large, non-enveloped virus or any enveloped virus. Similarly, a product that can
kill a large, non-enveloped virus should be able to kill any enveloped virus.”20

Experimental Method:
Material testing. N-95 test coupons measuring approximately 1cm2 were placed into a single
well of a 12-well dish, in triplicate. Over the course of two experiments, an average of 1.2 x 106
TCID50 units of BCoV-mebus in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing artificial saliva21,22
was spotted onto each test coupon. Each 12-well dish were placed in their respective
temperature incubators for the desired time points. Following incubation, N-95 test coupons
were incubated with one mL of medium and rocked at room temperature for ten minutes to
recover infectious virus.
Bovine Coronavirus infectivity assay. Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells were
maintained in advanced minimal essential medium (AMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 5%
heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), and 1%
Antibiotic/Actinomycotic cocktail (Gibco) 23. The BCoV-Mebus (GenBank: U00735.2) strain was
used24. Median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays were performed according to
published protocols. To detect cytopathogenicity (CPE) caused by the virus, BCoV-infected and
uninfected (control) MDBK cells were imaged in a SpectraMax Imaging Cytometer (Molecular
Devices) at a 5-millisecond exposure. Negative controls, which included uninfected MDBK cells
and MDBK cells incubated with MEM exposed to a N-95 test coupon, were negative for CPE
induction. TCID50 values were calculated using the Reed-Muench method25.
MS-2 plaque assay. Plaque assays were performed using MS-2, a non-enveloped
bacteriophage, to test its ability to survive and infect E. coli at the selected temperatures and

time durations (Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2 ATCC® 15597B1™). A saliva and MS-2
mixture was spotted onto each test coupon. MS-2 was recovered and eight, 10-fold dilutions
were made. Ten microliters of each dilution were spotted, and an agar overlay was added 24.
After a 24-hour incubation period, plaques were counted, and the titer of MS-2 was calculated.
Results: After 12 hours at 43°C both MS-2 and BoCoV viral load are projected to decline by a
factor of 106 (Figure 1). At room temperature (22°C) levels of infectious MS-2 and Bovine
Coronavirus decline appears to slow. These results are in rough agreement with a variety of
lower temperature measurements made by other groups under different conditions14. A viral
load reduction of 106 is equivalent to 20 half-lives, so if the half-life at 43°F is around a halfhour, ten hours (20*0.5) will be sufficient to reduce by 106. While not definitive, given the
approximately exponential decrease in life-time with temperature by about a factor of 3 per
decade Celsius25,, the WASP-D protocol recommends 46°C and 12 hours.

line denotes an exponential 12 hour reduction by 106.

Figure 2: Heat reduces Bovine Coronavirus infectivity. Bovine Coronavirus (strain Mebus) was heated at 22°C or 43°C for up to
twenty-four hours. Following heat treatment, Bovine Coronvirus was incubated with MDBK cells for 48-hours,
cyotopathogenecity (CPE) was scored, and median tissue culture infectivity (TCID 50) was calculated. The TCID50 assay has a limit
of detection of 10 TCID50 units (here defined as CPE detected in all four replicates. If we define limit of detection (LoD) as any of
the replicates showing CPE, then the LoD is 1 TCID50 units. No infectious virus was detected following exposure to 43°C heat for
six or 24 hours.

Conclusions and recommendations: On BoCoV test samples and MS-2 e-coli vectors, WASP-D
is expected to result in a 106 viral load reduction after 12 hours at 115°F=46°C and 22% relative
humidity. We expect a similar effect on the human beta coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. While we
have not yet field tested this methodology (studies on-going), WASP-D offers the prospect of
saving lives around the globe by allowing for the relatively safe re-use of scarce PPE, and we
hope others will confirm and extend our results and protocol at
https://www.protocols.io/view/wasp-d-field-protocol-bkcskswe.
While the intended audience for WASP-D are LMIN, it does not escape our notice that domestic
hospitals and individuals would benefit from a convenient method to decontaminate PPE, or
even entire rooms and buildings. We can imagine colleges might employ this system to
decontaminate student masks- or libraries, to sanitize circulating books and DVDs. We also
emphasize, in this world of internet misinformation, and in no uncertain terms, that WASP-D
cannot be used to decontaminate people. A steam spa, or blowing hot air up the nose, is
ineffective and possibly dangerous. More subtly, exponential viral decay is exquisitely sensitive
to time and temperature. 100°F and 8 hours is not a substitute for 115°F and 12 hours. A home
cooking oven set on WARM will overshoot the 125°F upper safe temperature range (due to
radiation from the exposed heating elements) and possibly damage the PPE. Extra time must
be allotted to account for the cooling effect of evaporating moisture, or low PPE thermal
conductivity2626.

2626

For example, if WASP-D is used to decontaminate books, a single book might take three hours to reach 43°C in
a 46°C room, while a stack of books (due to the insulation value of cellulosic paper) might take ten hours or more.
These heating time delays must be added to the 12-hour WASP-D cycle.
