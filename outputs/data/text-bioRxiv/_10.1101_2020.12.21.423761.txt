Abstract
This article constructs a restricted infection rate inverse binomial-based approach to

26

predict COVID-19 cases after a family gathering. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is

27

unqualified to match the reality of COVID-19, because the data contradicts the model’s

28

requirement that variance should be greater than expected value. A refined version of the IB

29

model is a necessity to predict COVID-19 cases after family gatherings. Our refined version of

30

an IB model is more appropriate and versatile, as it accommodates all potential data scenarios:

31

equal, lesser, or greater variance than expected value.

32

Application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on Fan et

33

al.’s COVID-19 data, which exhibits two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number

34

of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation

35

of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases

36

increases and vice versa. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is appropriate for Cluster 1.

37

The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75

38

among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Conversely, Cluster 2, exhibits smaller

39

variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying the number of primary and

40

secondary cases increase or decrease together. Cluster 2 disqualifies the traditional IB model and

41

demands its refined version. Probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.74 among

42

the primary, but is 0.72 among the secondary in Cluster 2, with a narrower gap.

43

The model’s ability to estimate the community’s health system memory for future

44

policies to be developed is an asset of this approach. The current hazard level to be infected with

45

COVID-19 among the primary and secondary groups are estimable and interpretable.

Author Summary
Current statistical models are not able to accurately predict disease infection spread in the

55

COVID-19 pandemic. We have applied a widely-used inverse binomial method to predict rates

56

of infection after small gatherings, going from primary (original) cases to secondary (later) cases

57

after family gatherings or social events, using the data from the Wuhan and Gansu provinces in

58

China, where the virus first spread. The advantages of the proposed approach include that the

59

model’s ability to estimate the community’s health system memory for future policies to be

60

developed, as such policies might reduce COVID’s spread if not its control. In our approach, as

61

demonstrated, the current hazard level of becoming infected with COVID-19 and the odds of

62

contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable

63

and interpretable. We hope the proposed approach will be used in future epidemics.

Introduction
COVID-19 is the third-leading cause of death in 2020 in the USA, Belgium, France,

68

Sweden, and the UK, behind only heart disease and cancer (www.kff.org). Predicting a pandemic

69

like COVID-19 is challenging (reasons in Ioannidis et al., 2020). Major practical reasons that

70

have been cited include poor data, insensitive parameter estimates, and imprecise epidemiologic

71

features. A discussion of an underlying model for the data is missing from this list. What is a

72

model? The model is an abstraction of reality; the better the model, the better it represents

73

reality. The occurrence and spread of COVID-19 are too complex in reality to be well matched

74

by any known model in the literature. It is not surprising that the efforts to predict COVID-19

75

result in a failure, due to utilizing a wrong model for the data. To avoid failure, we must start by

76

refining the model to suit the complexities that exist in the dynamic nature of COVID-19. That is

77

exactly the research theme of this article. Of course, the main objective of any data collection is

78

to predict future incidences as accurately as possible in order to be prepared for any emergencies

79

and contingencies.

80

The professionals occasionally hear and/or argue that all models are wrong, but some are

81

useful (Field, 2015; Box, 1976). Recently, Shanmugam (2020, a) presented a probabilistic

82

approach to capturing the impact of healthcare efforts on the prevalence rate of COVID-19’s

83

infectivity, hospitalization, recovery, and mortality rates in the USA. Several non-intuitive

84

findings including the existence of imbalance, different vulnerabilities, and risk reduction were

85

noticed. In Shanmugam (2020, b), the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed, recovered/cured,

86

and fatalities across thirty-two of India’s states/territories, as of May 1, 2020 were modelled and

87

analyzed. In the end, the attained administrative efficiency by the government was scrutinized.

88

This knowledge leads to valuable lessons for adaptation for use in any future pandemics like

89

COVID-19.

90

Hence, via modeling by trial and error, the professionals attempted to catch up and

91

unravel the mysterious nature of the pandemic. This article is an attestation of such a hubristic

92

endeavor to predict COVID-19 infectivity with a refined version of the traditional inverse

93

binomial (IB) model. The traditional IB model possesses a unique property that the variance is

94

larger than its expected value (Stuart and Ord, 2015 for details) and it limits its suitability for

95

COVID-19 data under such variance. A refined version of the IB model is necessary to

96

accommodate data under equal and over variance scenarios as it occurs in COVID-19 data.

97

Yet, the issue of under variance seems to have not received enough attention compared to

98

over variance in the literature (Barmalzan, 2019; Tin 2008). The Poisson model requires the

99

equality of expected value and variance (Stuart and Ord, 2015). To deal with a deviation from

100

such a requirement in Poisson data, Conwell and Maxwell (1962) initiated a mathematically

101

complex approach by raising a function of the observables to an unknown versatile parameter.

102

Conway and Maxwell applied their approach to model the queuing systems with state-dependent

103

service rates.

104

We now return to discuss a refined version of the IB model for COVID-19 data. At a

105

fixed incidence rate, the number of COVID-19 cases is, of course, a Poisson type random

106

variable. When COVID-19’s incidence rate is stochastically changing due to a variety of reasons

107

as a gamma probability pattern, the convolution of Poisson and gamma probability structures

108

results in the IB model for an occurrence of a random number of COVID-19 cases (Shanmugam

109

and Chattamvelli, 2015 for details on the convolution). However, in this article, a refined and

110

viable alternative to dealing with equal/under/over variance COVID-19 data, we start at its jump

start probability. Shanmugam and Radhakrishnan (2011) introduced a concept of jump start

112

probability in health/medical data analysis. The method in this article is simple, easy, and versatile,

113

but originates from the jump probability. The unsteady nature of the variance is recognized here

114

as the heterogeneity level in the gatherings of family with some members being carriers of the

115

COVID-19 virus. Heterogeneity causes the prediction of COVID-19 incidence rates to be

116

haphazard, if not uncanny.

117

COVID-19 was first noticed in Wuhan Province in the central part of China. Those with

118

COVID-19 symptoms leaving Wuhan to participate in family gatherings in Gansu Province are

119

recognized as the primary cases (Fan et al., 2020). Those at the family gatherings in Gansu

120

Province who were infected by the primary cases are recognized as secondary cases. Is there a

121

significant difference in the virality among the secondary cases in comparison to the primary

122

cases? This research question is answered in the second part of this article. For this purpose, new

123

concepts of infectivity that restricted IB modeling processes are defined, and they are utilized to

124

derive analytic expressions with an intention to better predict the future COVID-19 infection

125

rates and cases. The data are borrowed from Fan et al., 2020.

Uneven COVID-19 Jump Start Proportion
To ease the comprehension of the derivation of an infectivity rate restricted version of the

129

inverse binomial (IB) which adds on under and equal variance properties in addition to

130

preserving already existing over variance properties, we start with the COVID-19 scenarios.

131

Suppose there is an unknown risk level, 0    1 for a person to contract COVID-19 at a family

132

gathering. Also, assume that there exists an unknown restriction level,   1 on infectivity due to

133

persons who may have a strong immunity and/or have undertaken strict preventive measures

Gansu Province, China. Hence, the odds for being safe after the family union is

154

the homogeneously immune participants as they identified by the IB model. The traditional IB

155

model is an extreme special case of the IRRIB model when   1 , because the denominator

156

(1)(1) 1 as a baseline value. In other words, when the family gathering consists of

157

attendees having homogeneous immunity to COVID-19 (that is,   1 ), using the traditional IB

158

model is meaningful.

159

Otherwise (that is, with a family gathering in which the attendees have heterogeneous

160

resistance to COVID-19), the involvement of   1 is a necessity in modeling to predict future

161

COVID-19 cases. Hence, the modeling approach based on IRRIB is versatile to predict incidence

162

of COVID-19 in all three (equal, under, and over variance) scenarios mentioned above.

163

We now discuss the odds of contracting COVID-19 among attendees having homogeneous

resistance to COVID-19 versus heterogeneous resistance to COVID-19 in the gathering. Amid

Jump Rate-Incidence of COVID-19 Cases

179

We now move on to discuss the jump rate in the incidence of COVID-19 cases.

180

Furthermore, let us assume that there are m  1 family gatherings with a group of participants

181

with heterogeneous resistance to COVID-19 ,   1 at the family gathering. Let Y be a random

182

number of COVID-19 cases emerging out of the m family gatherings. Notice that the probability

183

for a single new COVID-19 case to arise in any gathering is Pr(Y  1) 

184

in comparison to the probability of an infection free situation, Pr(Y  0)  1

Prediction of COVID-19 Cases After Family Gatherings
To illustrate the main concepts and analytic expressions in Section 2, let us consider the

219

COVID-19 data connecting Gansu Province (32°31'N–42°57'N, 92°13'E–108°46'E ), in

220

Northwest China and Wuhan (30.5928° N, 114.3055° E) in Central China. COVID-19 was first

221

noticed on December 31, 2019 in Wuhan, China. Wuhan is connected to Gansu by travel options

222

including airplanes, railroads, interstate buses, and private cars. The COVID-19 virus originated

223

in Wuhan.

224

The primary and secondary COVID-19 cases are defined as follows. The primary cases

225

refer to those who traveled from Wuhan to Gansu. The secondary COVID-19 cases refer those

226

who never left Gansu. The secondary COVID-19 cases were the outcome of family gatherings in

227

which the primary and secondary COVID-19 cases mingled together. In other words, the

228

secondary cases might have been infected by the primary cases. It is assumed (Fan et al., 2020)

229

that the COVID-19 virus does not mutate to reduce its virulence in transmission. One then

230

wonders whether the secondary cases exhibit different characteristics from that of primary cases?

231

This question is the research aim of this article.

We want to capture and compare the virality of the COVID-19 incidence rates/cases in

233

the primary versus secondary groups. When we plot them in the same graph, we noticed that

234

there are two clusters in the data (S3 Figure 3). The Table 1 (with gatherings of ten families)

235

contains lesser primary cases, while Table 2 (with gatherings of seven families) contains larger

236

primary cases of COVID-19.

239

Tables 1-2, there exists over (under) variance. Figures 3 is to notice that there are two clusters in

240

the union data. The over (under) variance is synonymous with the null hypothesis statement

241

The p-value and the statistical power are calculated and displayed in Tables 1 and 2. A

252

comparison of them reveals that the p-values are significant for the primary cases and secondary

253

cases in Table 1 and in Table 2. With a selection of  ˆ1 under the alternative hypothesis, the

254

statistical power is calculated and displayed in Tables 1 and 2. The power is excellent for the

255

primary and secondary cases in Table 1 and in Table 2. Next, we express final comments and

conclusions with respect to predicting implications of our model and analytic results for this

Cluster 1: Small Primary Cases
Here, the number of primary COVID-19 cases is in a single digit (lesser) as in Table 1. In

261

this case, the number of gatherings is also less, the data have over variance than the expected

262

value in both primary as well as secondary cases, the estimate of contracting COVID-19 in

263

primary and secondary type is 0.78 and 0.14 respectively, the prediction of a future number of

264

primary and secondary COVID-19 cases will be 5 and 20 respectively when the family gathering

265

consists of attendees having homogeneous resistance to COVID-19. The p-value for the

266

suitability of the IB process for COVID-19 data in Table 1 are 0.0001 in the case of primary as

267

well as secondary infection. The odds for contracting COVID-19 are 0.27 and 6.053 as primary

268

and secondary, respectively if the attendees are homogeneously immune to the COVID-19 virus.

269

The estimate of contracting COVID-19 (in family gatherings in which the attendees have

270

heterogeneous resistance to COVID-19) is 0.37 among primary cases and 0.99 among secondary

271

cases. The (statistical) power of accepting the research hypothesis H1 : ˆmle is 0.76 for the

272

primary and 0.99 for the secondary when ˆmle is the true value.

Cluster 2: Large Primary Cases

274

Here, the number of primary COVID-19 cases is in double digits (larger) as in Table 2. In this

275

case, the number of gatherings is also large, but the data have under variance than the expected

276

value in both primary as well as secondary cases. The risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus in

277

primary and secondary type is 0.25 and 0.28, respectively, the prediction of a future number of

278

primary and secondary COVID-19 cases will be 40 and 56 respectively when the family

279

gathering consists of attendees having homogeneous resistance to COVID-19. The odds of

280

contracting COVID-19 in primary and secondary type is 2.53 and 2.143, respectively, the

281

prediction of a future number of primary and secondary COVID-19 cases will be 40 and 56

282

respectively when the family gathering consists of attendees having homogeneous resistance to

283

COVID-19. The prediction of a future number of primary and secondary COVID-19 cases will

284

be 54 and 78 respectively when the family gathering consists of attendees having homogeneous

285

resistance to COVID-19. The p-value for the suitability of IB model processes for the COVID-19

286

data in Table 2 are 0.006 in the case of primary and 0.0000058 in the case of secondary

287

infection.

288

The odds of contracting COVID-19 are 2.91 and 2.57 among the primary and secondary

289

cases, respectively if the family gathering consists of attendees having homogeneous resistance

290

to COVID-19. The odds for contracting COVID-19 are 2.53 and 2.14 among the primary and

291

secondary cases, respectively if the family gathering consists of attendees having heterogeneous

292

resistance to COVID-19. The estimate of contracting COVID-19 (in family gatherings in which

293

the attendees have heterogeneous resistance to COVID-19) is 0.984 among primary cases and

294

0.72 among secondary cases. The (statistical) power of accepting the research hypothesis

Discussion
The pandemic called COVID-19 is a challenge not only to healthcare professionals,

302

policy makers, epidemiologists and biostatisticians who try to model data and make successful

303

predictions but also to the general public who faithfully practice what was suggested to them

304

such as social distancing, face covering, and utilizing good and frequent sanitizing practices.

305

Despite all these precautionary efforts, many families desire to get together for occasions and

306

events. Some participants in such gatherings may have originated from a place like Wuhan,

307

China in where the COVID-19 virus was spreading and they are labelled as primary cases ( Yp ).

308

The other participants at a gathering occurring at a location like Gansu Province, China

309

where the COVID-19 virus had not yet appeared could get infected by the primary cases from

310

Wuhan, and they are labelled as secondary cases ( Ys ) in the epidemiologic data collection

311

process. An unknown in such gatherings is whether the participants are homogeneously immune

312

to the infectivity or heterogeneously risky to contract the virus. Amid less clarity, an issue of

313

interest might be how best one can predict the number of COVID-19 cases after the family

314

gathering. In other words, a research goal for the analysts of infectious diseases is to address the

315

similarities versus differences between the primary and secondary groups in the family

316

gathering. The research goal appears simple and easy on the surface but is actually very

317

complicated and challenging, as pointed out in a recent article by Ioannidis et al. (2020).

318

We learned the following from the statistical analysis of COVID-19 data in Table 1 in

319

this article. The spreading of the COVID-19 virus is expedited by family gatherings with

320

attendees having heterogeneous resistance to COVID-19; the change is significantly different

321

from its earlier risk of contracting COVID-19. In a macro sense, the number of secondary

322

COVID-19 cases would have been much less if the number of primary COVID-19 cases was

323

smaller in the first place. When these family gatherings contribute to massive infection incidents,

324

many communities, not to mention nations as a whole, do not have enough resources to treat a

325

deluge of patients. When citizens are locked down in homes without working, the nations’

326

productivity reduces to near zero levels, and the global economy suffers consequently. The

327

absence of vaccinations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 makes the scenario bleaker, although

328

several countries have faithfully committed to social distancing, wearing face coverings and

329

other mitigation regimens. It seems that we all have a long way to go to reach the day in which

330

the virus of COVID-19 is totally controlled and eventually eradicated. To attain this optimum

331

level, professionals need to do more research work with pertinent data on COVID-19.

332

The advantages of this new approach include the model’s ability to estimate the

333

community’s health system memory for future policy development, as such policies might

334

reduce the COVID-19 viral spread in an effort to control the pandemic. In our approach, as

335

demonstrated, the current hazard level to become infected with COVID-19 and the odds of

336

contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable

337

and interpretable. In essence, family gatherings, especially with more vulnerable family members

338

who are aged, have chronic diseases, or have issues of reduced immunity, need to be highly

339

scrutinized by the family members before engaging in such events. Computer mediated

340

communication such as tele/video conferencing should be “pushed” and possibly subsidized by

341

each governmental level to encourage family interaction but while utilizing safe venues. What

342

was omitted in the itemized reasons in Ioannidis et al. (2020) for not successfully predicting

343

COVID-19 cases is the role of an appropriate underlying model for the data. A model is an

344

abstraction of reality. To rectify this situation, this article has constructed and illustrated a

345

restricted infection rate inverse binomial-based approach to better predict future COVID-19

346

cases after a family gathering or social event.

A few explanations are worthwhile here for the sake of predicting the future COVID-19

jumpRate(, ) is smaller, the expected

425

cases. First, a non-intuitive explanation is that when the

426

number of future COVID-19 cases is larger and that is why COVID-19 is mysterious. Next, let

427

us now look at other intuitive explanations. When the number m of family unions is greater, the

428

expected number of future COVID-19 cases is greater. In other words, the

429

COVID-19 cases is a factor not only of the predicted number but also as the heterogeneity (that

430

is, variance) level of the COVID-19 incidences. When the

431

number of future COVID-19 cases is closer to its variance, illustrating an equal variance

432

scenario.

jumpRate(, ) of

jumpRate(, ) is larger, the expected

When the heterogeneity resistant level,, to COVID-19 increases more and more from its

434

baseline value.   1 (which is indicative of best homogeneously immune level with respect to

435

COVID-19), the variance, V a r ( Y ) changes in proportion to the expected number, E ( Y ) of

444

unions could also increase proportionally the number of COVID-19 cases and consequently

445

might inflate the heterogeneity (that is, more variance). Unlike the traditional IB situation which

446

exhibits only over variance, the new IRRIB model in this article portrays additionally equal and

447

under variance. That is, in the case of under variance, note that

448

{ 1oddsIBsafe}if _ attendees _ are _ heterogeneously resistant to COVID-19 virus.

449

This is obtained after taking the logarithm on both sides and applying the Taylor’s series

450

expansion:

451

ln ln{1(1)}(1);0 1.

452

Notice that the odds of being safe from COVID-19 among those with homogeneously immune

453

is: OddsIBsafe 

454

over variance. When  1OddsIB , the IRRIB process echoes equality of expected value and

455

variance, countering that the equality of expected value and variance is unique to the Poisson

456

process (Stuart and Ord, 2015). The odds for a safe situation in the family union involving

The Markov chain is a way of capturing the memory in the chance mechanism. It is known

481

(Stuart and Ord, 2015) that the traditional geometric process maintains no memory. Its expected

482

value is that Pr(Y  q Y  p)  Pr(Y  q) . With   1 , we note a memory relation that

486

Pr(Y  q Y  p)  Pr(Y  q) . It suggests that there is a memory in the chance-oriented health

mechanism which is portrayed by IRRIB process. The memory level is

Next, we discuss the estimation of the parameters of the IRRIB process and obtain parameter

497

estimates for IB process as particular cases.

498

Consider a random sample y1, y2, y3,..., yn of size nfrom the IRRIB process. We resort to the

499

maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameters because of its virtue. That is, the

500

maximum likelihood estimate of a function of the parameters is the function of their MLEs. In

501

the case of homogeneously immune to COVID-19, the MLE of the risk to contract COVID-19 is
