Abstract:
Although critical illness has been associated with SARS-CoV-2-induced hyperinflammation, the
immune correlates of severe COVID-19 remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed
peripheral blood immune perturbations in 42 SARS-CoV-2 infected and recovered individuals.
We identified broad changes in neutrophils, NK cells, and monocytes during severe COVID-19,
suggesting excessive mobilization of innate lineages. We found marked activation within T and B
cells, highly oligoclonal B cell populations, profound plasmablast expansion, and SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies in many, but not all, severe COVID-19 cases. Despite this heterogeneity, we
found selective clustering of severe COVID-19 cases through unbiased analysis of the aggregated
immunological phenotypes. Our findings demonstrate broad immune perturbations spanning both
innate and adaptive leukocytes that distinguish dysregulated host responses in severe SARS-CoV2 infection and warrant therapeutic investigation.

Introduction
The coronavirus-19-disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has surpassed four million cases world-wide (4,088,842
as of 05/12/2020), causing more than 283,000 deaths in 215 countries (1). While asymptomatic in
some, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause viral pneumonia that progresses to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), and even multi-organ failure, in severe cases (2, 3). Reports have
shown that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to productively infect lung epithelium, gut enterocytes
and endothelium (4-6). It is unclear whether disease severity is caused by the viral infection, the
host response, or both, emphasizing the urgent need to understand the immune perturbations
induced by SARS-CoV-2 (3). Knowledge of the immunological signatures of severe COVID-19
is continually evolving. Although lymphopenia has been linked to disease severity, the majority
of published studies are based on retrospective analyses of clinical data (3, 7-14).
Immune profiling studies to date have been conducted as single case reports or focused
only on moderate, severe or recovered COVID-19 with limited numbers of individuals (15-18),
and have not necessarily reflected the range of comorbidities globally associated with severe
COVID-19. Studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by mass cytometry or single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq) have provided valuable insights into possible immune perturbations in
COVID-19 but have not assessed the contributions of granulocytic populations, or, in the case of
scRNAseq, defined expression or modulation of cellular proteins (16). In particular, modulation
of granulocytic populations is suggested to be relevant during COVID-19 infection (12).
To address these issues, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the overall
immunologic state of 42 individuals with different trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
COVID-19 (moderate, severe, and recovered), compared with 12 healthy donors using whole

blood to capture the full breadth of immunological perturbations and activation occurring in
circulating lymphocytes and major granulocyte populations. We further explored modulation of
the B cell repertoire, its associations with the establishment of a SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral
response, and activation of T cells relative to disease severity. Together our results reveal a
potential platform for assessing disease trajectory, and identify distinct immune perturbation
patterns in severe COVID-19 that merit consideration for therapeutic immunomodulation
strategies to ameliorate disease severity and organ failure.

RESULTS
Demographics and clinical characteristics of moderate and severe COVID-19+ individuals
We recruited 35 inpatients with active COVID-19, seven of whom had moderate and 28 with
severe disease, seven recovered COVID-19+ donors, and 12 healthy donors (HD). All recovered
donors reported mild disease, and did not receive inpatient care or COVID-19 directed therapy
during the course of their illness. For inpatients, median follow up after enrollment was 27 days
(range 20 – 43) since blood draw. General demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in
Table 1. The median ages in the moderate and severe COVID-19+ groups were 59 and 68 years
old, respectively, concordant with previous reports (8), and were not significantly different
(p=0.51). Both the HD and recovered groups were significantly younger than individuals with
severe COVID-19+ (p<0.001 in both cases). In line with a recent publication (9), the majority of
the individuals in the severe and recovered groups were male (67.9% and 71.4%, respectively),
while approximately 29% were male in the moderate disease group. The median number of days
since onset of symptoms to disease progression in donors with severe COVID-19 was nine, similar
to previous publications (3, 10). Individuals with moderate disease also reported a median of nine
days since onset of symptoms. In accordance with a recent report (19), individuals with COVID19 had high incidence of underlying pulmonary disease (11/35 including moderate and severe,
31.4%) and were current or former smokers (13/35 including moderate and severe, 42.7%, higher
in individuals who developed severe disease).
Hypertension and hyperlipidemia were the most frequent co-morbidities in moderate and
severe COVID-19. The majority of individuals with severe COVID-19 presented with moderate
and severe ARDS (20), and hospital mortality was 14.3% within this group. Thromboembolic
complications, metabolic, vascular and pulmonary disease were also observed more frequently

among those with severe disease (Table 1). As part of clinical care, D-dimer, procalcitonin, ferritin,
lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels were measured in moderate and severe
COVID-19 individuals. Median levels of D-dimer at the time of blood draw were 3.985 µg/ml in
severe, and 0.62 µg/ml in moderate COVID-19 donors (severe n=20, moderate n=5; p=0.0022).
We found higher levels of ferritin in the severe group compared to the moderate group (medians:
919.5 ng/ml in severe, n=20, and 162 ng/ml in moderate, n=5; p=0.007). Consistent with previous
findings (13), median procalcitonin values were relatively low, though higher in severe donors
than in those with moderate disease (medians of 0.45 ng/ml, n=15, and 0.06 ng/ml, n=5,
respectively; p=0.0014). Levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein were similar
across groups. Bacterial co-infection was present in nine individuals with severe COVID-19, and
in only one moderate donor. An extended list of clinical information of the analyzed individuals
is shown in Table S1.

Immune perturbation in severe COVID-19
To assess the general landscape of immune responses and their perturbation during severe COVID19, we performed extensive immunophenotyping to characterize the frequencies of circulating
immune subsets in HD, or in moderate, severe and recovered COVID-19 individuals (Fig. 1, Fig.
S1). We observed an expansion in the proportion of both neutrophil and eosinophil populations in
severe COVID-19 donors compared to HD (median neutrophil frequencies within viable CD45+
cells: 79.9% in severe COVID-19 and 47.7% in HD; p<0.0001; and, median eosinophil frequencies
within viable CD45+ cells: 0.68% eosinophils in severe COVID-19 and 0.17% in HD, p=0.0015;
Fig. 1A-C). The neutrophil frequency also differed significantly between moderate vs. severe
COVID-19 disease (p=0.0046, median frequency of 53% of viable CD45+ in moderate group),

but did not show increased activation or cycling (Fig. S2A). Furthermore, we saw decreased
expression of CD15 in neutrophils between HD and severe COVID-19 individuals (p=0.0095), but
not in eosinophils (Fig. S2B). We did not observe significant differences in the immature
granulocyte frequencies between HD and COVID-19 individuals. However, the proportion of
immature granulocytes in moderate and severe COVID-19 donors correlated inversely with the
time since onset of symptoms (Fig. S2C). In contrast to previous work (21), the total proportion of
monocytes (CD14+ HLA-DR+), as well as monocyte subsets (defined by CD14 and CD16), was
similar across groups (data not shown). Donors with severe COVID-19 had lower proportions of
dendritic cells (DC) compared to moderate disease (p=0.003) and HD (p=0.0374; median
percentage in viable CD45+ cells: 0.42% in severe, 0.64% in moderate and 0.49 in HD, Fig. 1A),
but not with recovered individuals.
Consistent with previous reports (7, 8, 22-24), we observed a relative decrease in the
percentages of all lymphocyte subsets (Fig. 1A, B, D). Severe COVID-19 individuals had
significantly lower relative proportions of T cells (median frequency within CD45+ cells: 4.5% in
severe COVID-19+ and 30.6% in HD; p<0.0001), CD161+ CD8+ T cells (median frequency of
CD45+ cells: 0.002% in severe COVID-19 and 1.3% in HD; p<0.0001), innate lymphoid cells
(ILCs, median frequency of CD45+ cells: 0.005% in severe COVID-19 and 0.03% in HD;
p<0.0001) and natural killer (NK) cells than HD (median frequency of CD45+ cells: 0.95% in
severe COVID-19 and 4.5% in HD; p<0.0001). We did not find significant differences in the
frequencies of these cell subsets between HDs and moderate or recovered COVID-19 individuals.
Within the NK cell lineage, we observed a drastic decrease in the frequencies of both
CD56brightCD16- and CD56dimCD16+ NK cells in severe COVID-19 vs. HD (Fig. S2D). In the
recovered group, the proportions of T cells, CD161+ CD8+ T cells, ILCs and NK cells were higher

than in donors with severe COVID-19 but similar to HDs (median frequencies within viable
CD45+ cells: 22% of T cells, 0.1% of CD161+ CD8+ T cells, 0.014% of ILCs, 3.5% of NK cells).
The proportions of regulatory CD4+ T cells and circulatory follicular CD4+ T cells were similar
across studied groups (Fig. S3A, B). Although we did not observe differences in CD4+ and CD8+
memory T cell subsets between groups (data not shown), we did find a negative correlation with
the frequency of central memory T cells (TCM) and days since the onset of symptoms (Spearman
r= -0.41 p=0.02 for CD4+ TCM; Spearman r= -0.61 p=0.0002 for CD8+ TCM, Fig. S3C). Given that
the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may be an independent risk factor for severe disease (25, 26),
we examined the neutrophil:T cell ratio (based on their frequencies within viable CD45+ cells).
Individuals with severe COVID-19 had a ratio of 15, while all other studied groups had ratios of
less than 2.5. Furthermore, using logistic regression analyses, we did not find any associations
between the reported frequencies and comorbidities (pooled together as vascular/metabolic
disorders, underlying lung disease and bacterial infections, Table S1). Altogether, these data reveal
multiple immunophenotypic abnormalities in severe COVID-19, which are not found in donors
with moderate or recovered disease.

Elevated frequency of plasmablasts, changes in B cell subsets and humoral responses
Although we observed only marginal differences in the proportions of total B cells between the
studied groups (Fig. 1), B cell plasmablasts were significantly expanded in severe COVID-19
donors compared to HD (Fig. 1D, Fig. 2A; median frequency within B cells of: 9.7% in severe
COVID-19 and 0.48% in HD, p<0.0001). These cells characteristically displayed high levels of
Ki-67 and low levels of CXCR5 expression (Fig. S4A). Similar to observations in the immune
atlas of recovered COVID-19 donors (16), expanded plasmablasts were not found in this group

(median frequency with B cells of 0.3% in recovered, p<0.0001 vs. severe donors). The frequency
of plasmablasts in individuals with severe COVID-19 did not correlate with age, days since onset
of symptoms or the presence of co-morbidities (data not shown), similar to one report based on
scRNASeq analyses (16).
In the non-plasmablast B cell population, we observed a decrease in the percentage of
CD21+CD27+ in moderate and severe groups compared to HD (median frequency of nonplasmablasts of: 24% in HD, 10.8% in moderate disease and 6.7% in severe disease). These
proportions were highly significant by nonparametric test of trend (p=0.0008), but only the severe
COVID-19 group reached statistical significance vs. HD (p=0.0061, Fig. 2B). Recovered COVID19 donors had similar levels of CD21+CD27+ non-plasmablasts as the HD group (median of
23.8%). Of note, the frequency of CD21+CD27+ non-plasmablasts was directly correlated with
the age of the donors among moderate and severe COVID-19 (Spearman r=0.35, p=0.4, Fig. S4B).
In contrast, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of CD21-CD27- non-plasmablasts
in moderate (median of 16.6%) and severe (median of 10.4%) COVID-19 individuals compared
to HD (median of 2.3%; p=0.0182 and p=0.004, respectively). We next assessed the expression of
Ki-67 and CD11c, to determine if any of these subsets were a potential source for the expanded
plasmablast population (27) (Fig. 2C). We did not observe a larger proportion of cycling Ki-67+
CD21-CD27- B cells in moderate or severe COVID-19 individuals when compared with HD. We
also found a reduction in the frequency of CD11c+ cells within CD21-CD27- B cells in donors
with moderate COVID-19 compared to HD that was specific to this group (medians of: 6.9% in
moderate and 49% in HD; p=0.0162).
Previous work has suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels could be associated with
disease severity (12, 28). With this in mind, and due to the changes observed in B cell subsets,

particularly the expansion of plasmablasts in severe COVID-19, we explored the humoral
responses in these donors. The levels of total IgG in plasma and serum were equivalent across the
groups (Fig. S4C). We then quantified IgM and IgG specific for the spike receptor binding domain
(RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2. The levels of both antibodies were significantly higher in the severe
and recovered COVID-19 individuals (Fig. 2D). While the frequency of plasmablasts did not
correlate with the levels of spike RBD-specific IgM or IgG, there was a positive association
between the levels of spike RBD-specific IgM and IgG and time since onset of symptoms (Fig.
2E) in the moderate and severe groups. Together these data indicate an exacerbated plasmablast
response in severe COVID-19, as well as the development of a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific
humoral response.

Profound oligoclonal expansion of B cells in severe COVID-19
Having observed the expansion of plasmablasts in severe COVID-19 donors, we sought to
determine whether this expansion in severe-COVID-19 resulted from non-specific stimulation.
Therefore, we examined the antibody repertoire within samples from randomly selected HD (n=3),
moderate COVID-19 (n=3) and severe COVID-19 (n=7) individuals. To sequence antibody heavy
chain libraries, we amplified genomic DNA was amplified using primers spanning across nearly
the full-length variable (VH) gene sequence and the entire third complementarity determining
region (CDR3). After quality control and filtering, the processed antibody heavy chain
rearrangements were grouped together into a data set comprising 76 sequencing libraries and
109,590 clones across all 13 individuals (Table S2 and GenBank/SRA PRJNA630455).
To evaluate the clonal landscape, we ranked the proportion of clones within the top ten (110), next 90 (11-100), next 900 (100-1,000), and most diverse clones with ranks above 1,000
11

(1,000+) (Fig. 3A). Donors with severe COVID-19 had an unusually high proportion of large
clones comprising the majority of their circulating antibody repertoire, with the fraction occupied
by the top 20 ranked clones (D20 measure) the highest compared to the healthy and moderate
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (Fig. 3B, Fig. S5) The D20 rank measure in moderate and severe
disease also correlated positively with the plasmablast fraction (Fig. 3C). In many severe COVID19 individuals we observed very large top copy clones, exceeding the diagnostic thresholds for
clinically significant monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (29). These large clones were readily
sampled across multiple independently amplified and sequenced libraries (Fig. 3D). Donors M7
and S21 had 91 and 55 clones present in 4 or more sequencing libraries, respectively, in contrast
to H4, who had 3 clones in 4 or more libraries (Fig. 3E). Only one HD (H8), an older individual,
had large and readily resampled clones, likely reflecting age-dependent narrowing and expansion
of the memory B cell repertoire (30).
To determine if the antibody heavy chain sequences harbored any evidence of extensive
somatic hypermutation (SHM), selective VH gene usage, or defining CDR3 characteristics, we
assessed these properties in the top copy clonotypes of each individual. A subset of individuals
with severe COVID-19 exhibited higher levels of SHM (Fig. 3F), but other top copy clones in
severe COVID-19, moderate COVID-19 and HD were unmutated. To determine if antibodies from
COVID-19 individuals exhibited convergent sequence features, we analyzed VH gene usage in all
clones of each donor (Fig. S6A). As this analysis did not reveal any consistent increased usage of
a specific VH gene in the moderate or severe COVID-19 individuals compared to controls, we
reanalyzed the data focusing on the top 200 most frequent clones in each individual (Fig. S6B).
Focusing on the most frequently used VH genes, VH genes from different families were used more
often in severe COVID-19 donors compared to HD, including VH6-1 (7-fold), VH3-48 and VH312

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.18.101717; this version posted May 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

15 (~6-fold) and several others (Fig. S6C). We also looked for skewing in VH family usage, which
revealed a modest relative increase in the proportion of VH3 family members among COVID-19
individuals compared to HD (Fig. S6D). However, there was considerable inter-individual
variation in the usage of VH3 vs. other family members, with some individuals (such as S25)
exhibiting substantial skewing towards particular VH families (data not shown).
Given the absence of obvious or uniform VH restriction among COVID-19 individuals, we
next analyzed the CDR3 sequences for shared characteristics in the COVID-19 donors. In
individuals with severe disease, CDR3 sequences exhibited greater variation in length (Fig. 3G),
and were significantly longer among the top copy sequences (Fig. 3H). To determine if the
antibody heavy chain sequences from COVID-19 individuals are generated commonly or
infrequently, we searched the Adaptive Biotechnologies public database, which consists of 37
million antibody heavy chain sequences (31), revealing 3995 matches to the CDR3 amino acid
sequences in our dataset. Among the 50 most frequent clones in the COVID-19 individuals, the
CDR3 lengths of the matching or “public” clones were shorter than the CDR3 lengths of the nonshared or “private” clones (Fig. 3I), indicating that the top copy clones in COVID-19 with long
CDR3 sequences are mostly private. Finally, to determine if there were any collections of clones
that harbored similar CDR3 amino acid sequences, we computed the edit distances of all of the
amino acid sequences in the top 50 clones of each of the individuals. If there were sequence
convergence, we would have expected to find clusters of sequences separated by 3 or fewer amino
acids. We found no evidence of co-clustering of CDR3 sequences; rather, over 99% of the edit
distances for the severe COVID-19 individuals’ top copy clone pairs were more than 3 amino acids
apart (Fig. 3J). Consistent with this finding, alignment of top copy clone CDR3 amino acid
sequences from severe COVID-19 individuals revealed highly variable amino acid sequences (Fig.
13

S6E). Taken together, these data show that severe COVID-19 is associated with large, oligoclonal
B cell expansions with antibodies enriched for long and divergent CDR3 sequences.

Innate immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19
Acknowledging the characteristic differences in innate cell subset frequencies in severe COVID19 individuals (Fig. 1), we further assessed the phenotype of innate immune cells. CD161 has been
reported to be a marker of inflammatory monocytes and NK cells (32-34). Despite having observed
a decreased frequency of CD161+ CD8 T cells (Fig. 1A, D), the frequencies of CD161+ monocytes
and CD38+CD161+ NK cells were similar across study groups (Fig. S2E). We next assessed the
frequency and expression of CD16 by neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells and immature
granulocytes. While the proportions of CD16+ monocytes and immature granulocytes were
consistent between groups, severe COVID-19+ individuals had significantly lower circulating
CD16+ NK cells in compared with HDs (median percentages of 68% in severe COVID-19 and
85.5% in HD; p=0.0023; Fig. 4A; also observed when analyzing NK cell subsets in Fig. S2D).
Furthermore, CD16 expression was significantly lower in neutrophils, NK cells, and immature
granulocytes (median fluorescence of CD16 in neutrophils: 7663 in severe and 34458 in HD,
p=0.0001; NK cells: 2665 in severe and 10190 in HD; p=0.0017; immature granulocytes: 2728 in
severe and 9562 in HD; p=0.0005) in severe COVID-19 (Fig. 4A-F). Downregulation of CD16 in
NK cells has been associated with IgG-mediated immune complexes in the context of vaccination
(35). We did not, however, find significant associations between the frequency or expression of
CD16 and IgG levels (Fig. S2F). Although we found a decrease in the frequency of CD16+
monocytes in some severe COVID-19 individuals, this was not consistent amongst the whole
cohort (Fig. 1A). The monocyte CD16 expression level tended to decrease with disease severity

(median fluorescence intensities of: 5445 in HD, 5235 in moderate and 3619 in severe; p=0.022
by nonparametric test of trend; Fig. 4B). However, monocytes significantly downregulated HLADR expression in severe COVID-19 donors compared to moderate disease (p=0.0072) and HD
(p=0.021; median fluorescence intensities of 1059 in severe, 4547 in moderate, 5409 in HD; Fig.
4G-H). Similar findings were reported by scRNASeq analysis of severe COVID-19 individuals
(16) and donors with severe respiratory failure (36). In contrast, CD14 expression in monocytes or
HLA-DR in other antigen presenting cells (Fig. S2G, H) was consistent across all studied groups.
Altogether, these findings indicate a substantial perturbation of the innate immune system in severe
COVID-19. Whether this dysregulation is consequence or contributing factor towards COVID-19
severity remains to be defined.

Heterogeneous T cell activation in severe COVID-19
T cell activation has been reported in acute respiratory and non-respiratory viral infections (3739). Consistent with recent case reports (15, 40, 41), we observed increased activation of both
memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 individuals compared to other study groups
(Fig. 5A and B). However, unlike the plasmablast response, heightened T cell activation was not
observed in every severe COVID-19 individual and instead demonstrated significant
heterogeneity. While overall the frequencies of CD38+ and HLA-DR+ CD38+ memory CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19 were elevated compared to HD (CD4+, 7.6%, 2.2% vs 2.7%,
0.2%, p=0.009 and p<0.0001, respectively; CD8+, 9.2%, 3.9% vs. 0.6%, 0.09%; p<0.0001 for
both cases), we did not find statistically higher Ki-67+ CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in COVID-19
individuals compared to HD. However, a subset of severe COVID-19 donors clearly had increased
levels of Ki-67+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, reaching as high as ~25% in some individuals. The

frequency of PD-1+ memory CD4+ T cells (44.3% in severe and 25.7% in HD, respectively;
p=0.0084), but not CD8+ T cells, was also higher in the severe COVID-19 group compared to the
HD group. For all measures, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation in recovered donors was equivalent
to the HD group. Of note, the proportion of PD-1+ memory CD4+ T cells, but not of PD-1+ CD8+
T cells, in moderate or severe COVID-19 correlated with donor age (Fig. S3D). In addition, the
frequencies of HLA-DR+ CD38+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells correlated with the proportion of
plasmablasts in moderate and severe COVID-19 individuals (r=0.5011 p=0.0022, and r=0.4722
p=0.0042, respectively, Fig. 5C).
We further quantified the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (defined as perforin+
granzyme B+ memory CD8+ T cells, Fig. 5D) in a subset of HD and severe COVID-19 individuals.
Due to limited samples, we did not include the moderate or recovered COVID-19 groups for this
analysis. We found a significantly higher proportion of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in severe COVID19 than in HD (median frequency within memory CD8+ T cells of 48.7% and 27.2%, respectively;
p=0.048). The frequencies of T-bet+ cells, as well as the levels of expression (measured by median
fluorescence intensity) of perforin+ and granzyme B+ cells within the cytotoxic memory CD8+ T
cell subset were similar between groups (Fig. S3E-F). Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells from severe
COVID-19 donors also had an increased proportion of cells expressing CD38 or co-expressing
PD-1 and CD38 compared to HD (medians of 8.2% and 1.8%, respectively; p=0.0082; Fig. 5D
and Fig. S3G). These data indicate a heightened status of immune activation and frequency of
cytotoxic CD8+ T cells during severe COVID-19, not observed in moderate or recovered disease.

Distinctive severe COVID-19 immunophenotype
Finally, we performed an unbiased analysis to determine if the immune cells in severe COVID-19
disease cohort could be differentiated from the healthy, moderate, and recovered cohorts. We
included all analyzed immune phenotype parameters described thus far, including the expression
of activation markers within specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory subsets (data not shown).
We scaled all flow cytometry generated data using z-score, and performed hierarchical clustering
(Fig. 6A). From this analysis, the data from 21/28 of the severe COVID-19 patients co-localized
to a distinct cluster within the hierarchical tree. We further analyzed these data by principal
component analysis, where we again found selective clustering of individuals with severe COVID19 (Fig. 6B). The top parameters driving the clustering of the severe COVID-19 were associated
with T cell activation in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory subsets, frequency of plasmablasts and
frequency of neutrophils (Table S3), also evidenced in the heat map shown in Fig. 6A. Independent
analyses of the severe COVID-19 group did not produce separate clustering, likely due to reduced
sample number. However, it is clear from the heatmap analysis that distinct patterns within the
severe COVID-19 disease cohort may be present that further subdivide these individuals into
different subgroups. Taken as a whole, our analysis reveals a characteristic immune phenotype in
severe COVID-19, distinct not only from HD but also from other COVID-19 individuals with
moderate or recovered disease.

Discussion
Devising therapeutic strategies to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection remains challenging, due to both
the complexity of the clinical manifestations and an overall lack of understanding of severe
COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. Reports on single individuals, studies with small patient
numbers of varying disease stages, or focused analyses on limited immune phenotypes have
generated valuable information, but have fallen short of providing a comprehensive
immunophenotypic atlas of severe COVID-19. Here, we sought to define immune perturbations
of COVID-19 in moderate and severe disease using an unbiased approach designed to
simultaneously capture changes in the predominant granulocyte and lymphocyte populations. We
found profound changes in multiple leukocyte populations selectively in severe disease that
provides both novel and confirmatory insights into the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19,
including pronounced effects on neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells, and B and T lymphocytes.
Modulation of innate immune cells manifested in a number of ways, including broad
downregulation of CD15 and CD16 on neutrophils, as well as CD16 downregulation on NK cells,
immature granulocytes and monocytes. Retrospective clinical metadata studies have identified an
elevated neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio in severe COVID-19, a finding we confirm here (25). It is
unclear whether CD15 and CD16 downregulation marks an activated or refractory state. On NK
cells, CD16 downregulation has been associated with NK cell maturation and development (42),
as well as with activation and target cell engagement, resulting in antibody derived cell cytotoxicity
and TNF-alpha secretion. Alternatively, downregulation of CD16 after interaction with IgGimmune complexes also may prevent excessive immune responses after influenza vaccination (35,
43). Although it did not reach statistical significance between groups, we also observed lower

CD16 expression on monocytes in severe COVID-19 individuals compared to HD. Similar to its
suggested role in NK cells, regulation of CD16 in monocytes promotes TNF-alpha production
upon cross-linking by immune complexes and phagocytosis through IgG (44). Analogous changes
in phenotype of innate immune cells have been reported in other conditions and infectious diseases
(45-47). The implications of the observed changes in the expression of CD15 in neutrophils, as
well as CD16 across subsets during severe COVID-19 and their potential role as indicators of
redistribution to the lungs, link with function and response, as well as diagnostic and prognostic
significance (48-50), requires additional exploration.
One of our most striking findings was a profound expansion of plasmablasts during severe
COVID-19, in some patients rivaling or exceeding that observed in acute hantavirus, dengue and
Ebola infections or chronic inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (38,
51-54). One recent study suggested that COVID-19+ individuals in critical condition show
extrafollicular B cell activation (55). The increase in the plasmablast frequency we observed
directly correlated with an oligoclonal expansion of antibody clones within the overall B cell
repertoire, suggesting that many of these large clonal expansions reside within the plasmablast
pool. Remarkably, in some severe COVID-19 individuals a single clone could account numerically
for the entire plasmablast population. Only one individual with moderate disease displayed this
marked plasmablast expansion, the majority harboring smaller clones with more diverse
repertoires. The antibody sequences of the largest B cell clones in the severe COVID-19
individuals were surprisingly variable in terms of SHM levels, but consistently had long CDR3
regions compared to donors with moderate COVID-19 and HD. B cells harboring antibodies with
long CDR3 sequences are often multi-reactive and counter-selected during B cell development

(56), which may suggest a contribution of longer CDR3 sequences as part of severe COVID-19
immunopathology.
In line with a recent report (57), we did not observe clear sequence convergence of VH
genes amongst all the severe COVID-19 individuals, but VH3 family members were enriched in
some individuals. CDR3 sequences from individuals with severe COVID-19 had higher edit
distances than individuals with mild disease or HD. While their size, somatic mutation status and
association with the plasmablast fraction are suggestive of active participation in the immune
response to SARS-CoV-2, it is unknown if these clones can recognize the virus, confer protection,
or contribute to immunopathology. Future comparisons of our data to antibodies of known
specificity may provide important insights into the dynamics of antibody responses in different
phases of the illness and may reveal important differences between antibodies produced in the
context of moderate vs. severe disease.
T cell activation is typically observed during acute viral infections (58-60), and as expected
(15, 18) we observed increased activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in severe COVID-19
that correlated with the plasmablast frequency. However, T cell activation was very heterogeneous
across the severe COVID-19 patients, being equivalent to baseline in some while reaching up to
~25% of memory CD8+ T cells in others. This heterogeneity is relatively unusual compared to the
symptomatic phase in other acute infections in humans, such as HIV, EBV, HCMV, HBV, and
Ebola, where activation is uniformly detectable but to varying, and sometimes much higher,
degrees (61-64). However, given the degree of lymphopenia observed in the severe COVID-19
patients, it is possible that activated T cells are migrating to, or sequestered in, the lung in response
to the virus (23, 65-68), making it unclear if T cell activation is found in other sites as suggested
by case study reports (6, 69). We also observed a marked reduction in the frequency of CD161+

CD8+ T cells in donors with severe COVID-19. This subset is composed primarily of mucosalassociated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells (< 95%) (70) and a small subset of IL-17 secreting cells
(Tc17) (71). During viral infections, both MAIT and Tc17 cells can become activated and migrate
to infection sites (71, 72). Critically ill COVID-19 individuals were recently shown to have a
profound decrease in circulating MAIT cells paralleled with their presence in airways (73). As
such, the reduction of CD161+ CD8+ T cells in periphery found here could be indicative of cell
sequestration to the lungs, potentially exacerbating tissue inflammation.
Many of the immunological characteristics of severe COVID-19 share features of sepsisassociated immune dysregulation, yet others are more specific for an acute viral infection.
Decreased expression of CD16 on neutrophils, monocytes, and immature granulocytes and
decreased expression of HLA-DR in monocytes has been associated with sepsis and sepsis
outcome (36, 74-78). However, expansion of plasmablasts and activated T cells is common to
typical acute viral infections, not sepsis. Severe COVID-19 is a distinct clinical and immune sepsis
subphenotype, and the immune dysregulation may necessitate targeted strategies to effectively
manage clinical care. To this end, the immunological analysis strategy that we presented readily
differentiated those with severe COVID-19 compared to HD, moderate cases, and recovered cases.
Longitudinal studies to determine whether early detection of the immunological perturbations that
we have defined here predicts severe disease trajectory, even when patients exhibit only
asymptomatic or moderate disease could provide crucial insight into the development of effective
therapeutic interventions to ameliorate severe COVID-19.

Two severe COVID-19+ individuals were excluded from immunophenotyping and antibody

quantification as they displayed clear outlier phenotype due to Rituxan treatment for lymphoma,
and acute lymphocytic leukemia, respectively. bDonors enrolled in a clinical trial to test remdesivir
versus placebo. Remdesivir was administered after blood collection. cUnderlying lung disease
includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease. dDays since
onset of symptoms accounted from the time of blood collection.

as CD27+ CD38+ B cells) and non-plasmablast subsets defined by CD21 and CD27 expression in
HD (n= 12), and moderate (n=7), severe (n=27), and recovered (n=6) COVID-19 individuals.
Numbers inside the plots indicate the subset proportion of the corresponding parent population
(within total B cells for plasmablasts, within non-plasmablasts for CD21/CD27 subsets). C)
Frequencies of CD11c and Ki-67 in non-plasmablast B cell subsets defined in a). Analyses of
CD11c are shown for half of the individuals with moderate COVID-19. Plots from a representative
HD and severe COVID-19 individual shown. Numbers in each plot indicate the frequency within
the parent gate. D) Levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in serum
or plasma of HD (n= 12), moderate (n=7), severe (n=27), and recovered (n=6) COVID-19
individuals. Antibody measurements were performed by ELISA using plates coated with the
receptor binding domain (RBD) from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Sera and plasma samples
were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 1 hour prior to testing in ELISA to inactivate virus. Antibody
levels were reported as µg/ml amounts relative to the CR3022 monoclonal antibody (recombinant
human anti-SARS-CoV-2, specifically binds to spike protein RBD). E) Spearman correlations of
plasma/serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgM (top) and IgG (bottom) and days since
onset of symptoms on moderate and severe COVID-19 individuals.
Specific color coding was assigned per individual for cross comparison across graphs and Figs.

analyses on fresh whole blood after red blood cell lysis characterizing immune cells subsets in HD
(n= 12), moderate (n=7), severe (n=27), and recovered (n=6) COVID-19 individuals was
performed to assess the percentage of activated memory T cells. Frequencies of CD38+, HLADR+CD38+, PD-1+ and Ki67+ in A) CD4+, and B) CD8+ memory T cells (excluding naïve
CCR7+ CD45RA+, detailed gating strategy shown in Fig. S1). C) Spearman correlations between
the frequencies of HLA-DR+ CD38+ CD4+ or CD8+ memory T cells and plasmablasts in donors
with moderate (orange triangles) or severe COVID-19 (dark red circles). D) Frequency of
cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells. Multiparametric flow cytometry analyses were performed on

Materials and Methods
Blood donors
Inpatient donor admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with a SARS-CoV-19
positive result were screened and approached for informed consent within three days of
hospitalization. Recovered donors with a prior positive SARS-CoV-19 test and healthy donors
were recruited initially by word of mouth, and subsequently through a centralized University of
Pennsylvania resource website for COVID-19-related studies. All participants or their surrogates
provided informed consent in accordance with protocols approved by the regional ethical research
boards and the Declaration of Helsinki. Peripheral blood was collected from all donors. For
inpatients, clinical data were abstracted from the electronic medical record into standardized case
report forms. ARDS was categorized in accordance with the Berlin definition reflecting each
subject’s worst oxygenation level and with physicians adjudicating chest radiographs (1).
APACHE III scoring was based on data collected in the first 24 hours of ICU admission or the
first 24 hours of hospital admission for subjects who remained on an inpatient unit. Clinical
laboratory data was collected from the date closest to the date of research blood collection.

Sample Processing
Peripheral blood samples processed within 3 hours of collection. After plasma separation, 1 ml of
whole blood was separated for staining and the remaining volume was used for PBMC isolation
using SepMate tubes (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) following manufacturer’s
instructions.

Whole blood and PBMC staining
Flow cytometry experiments were performed on whole blood or freshly isolated PBMC. For whole
blood stains, leukocytes were obtained after lysis of red blood cells using ACK buffer
(Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) during 5 minutes followed by a wash with R10 media (RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells (whole blood derived
leukocytes or PBMC) were prestained for the chemokine receptor CCR7 for 10 min at 37°C 5%
CO2. All following incubations were performed at room temperature. Cells were stained for
viability exclusion using Live/Dead Fixable Aqua for 10 minutes, followed by a 20-minute
incubation with a panel of directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies and Trustain diluted in equal
parts of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and
1% bovine serum albumin) and Brilliant stain buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The cells
were washed in FACS buffer and fixed/permeabilized using the FoxP3 Transcription Factor Buffer
Kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), following manufacturer’s instructions. Intracellular staining
was performed by adding the antibody cocktail prepared in 1X permwash buffer for 1 hour at
37°C. Stained cells were washed and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (SigmaAldrich, St. Luis, MO), and stored at 4°C in the dark until acquisition.
All flow cytometry data were collected on a BD FACSymphony A5 cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.6.2, Tree Star, Ashland, OR).

Antibodies
The following antibodies were used: CD69 PE-Cy5 (clone FN50), PD-1 BV421 (clone
EH12.2H7), CCR7 APC-Cy7 (G043H7), CD19 BV785 (clone HIB19), CD27 BV650 (clone

(San Diego, CA). The Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) was used for
viability exclusion, and Human Trustain FcX (Biolegend) was used to prevent unspecific binding.

Quantification of total plasma/serum IgG by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA)
Total IgG was measured using a Hu Total IgG CBA Flex Set Bead (BD Biosciences) on plasma
or serum samples following manufacturer’s protocol.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody quantification
ELISAs were completed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain
(RBD) protein as previously described (2). Plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were
provided by Florian Krammer (Mt. Sinai) (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins were produced inhouse in 293F cells and purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). ELISA plates
(Immulon 4 HBX, Thermo Scientific) were coated with 50 µL per well of recombinant protein
diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 2µg/mL and plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. The
next day, ELISA plates were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and

were blocked with PBS-T supplemented with 3% non-fat milk powder for 1 hour at room
temperature. Sera and plasma samples were first heat-inactivated at 56°C for 1 hour and then
serially diluted in 2-fold in PBS-T supplemented with 1% non-fat milk powder (dilution buffer)
starting at a 1:50 dilution. ELISA plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T before the addition of
50 µL of diluted serum and were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Goat anti-human IgGHRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was diluted 1:5000 and goat antihuman IgM-HRP (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) was diluted 1:1,000 in dilution buffer.
After ELISA plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T, 50 µL of secondary antibodies were added
to each well and plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. ELISA plates were washed
3 times with PBS-T and were developed for 5 mins at room temperature with 50 µL per well of
SureBlue TMB substrate (KPL). The reaction was stopped by acidification with the addition of 25
µL of 250 mM hydrochloric acid and optical density (OD) readings at 450 nm were obtained using
the SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). An anti-SARS-CoV S
therapeutic monoclonal antibody (CR3022) was included on each plate and serum/plasma antibody
levels were reported as relative µg/mL amounts. Plasmids to express the CR3022 monoclonal
antibody were provided by Ian Wilson (Scripps).

Antibody heavy chain sequencing
DNA was extracted from blood using Gentra Puregene Blood Kit (Qiagen). Immunoglobulin
heavy-chain family-specific PCRs were performed on genomic DNA samples using primers in
FR1 and JH as described previously (5). Six biological replicates at 400 ng input DNA per
replicate were run on all subjects except for subject M5 (4 replicates and 63.5 ng DNA/replicate)
and S20 (6 replicates at 333.7 ng DNA/replicate). Sequencing was performed in the Human

Immunology Core Facility at the University of Pennsylvania. Illumina 2 × 300-bp paired-end kits
were used for all experiments (Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v3, 600-cycle, Illumina MS-1023003).

Antibody heavy chain sequence analysis
Quality Control, gene identification and clonal inference. Sequencing data were quality controlled
with pRESTO (6), using a similar protocol described previously (7). DNA was chosen for this
analysis because it provided a parsimonious means of evaluating the B cell repertoire, with one
template per cell, and because replicate sequencing libraries could be used to provide rigorous
clone size estimates (7). Briefly, paired reads were assembled using default parameters, sequences
that had an average quality score less than 30 were excluded, ends of each read which had an
average quality score less than 30 within a window of 20 bases were trimmed, sequences shorter
than 100 nucleotides were excluded, and bases with a quality score less than 30 were masked with
an N. Sequences with ten or more Ns were then discarded. Sequences were annotated with
IgBLAST, (8) and imported into ImmuneDB v0.29.9 (9) for further processing and data
visualization. To group related sequences together into clones, ImmuneDB hierarchically clusters
sequences with the same VH gene, same JH gene, same CDR3 length, and 85% identity at the
amino acid level within the CDR3 sequence (5). Clones with consensus CDR3 sequences within
2 nucleotides (10) of each other were further collapsed to account for incorrect gene calls.

Data Visualization. Data were exported from ImmuneDB for downstream analysis. pandas v1.0.0
was used for data manipulation, seaborn v0.10.0 and Prism v8.4.0 were used for graphing, scipy
v1.4.1 for statistical testing, and python-Levenshtein v0.12.0 was used for edit distance

calculations. Edit distance was calculated using an unweighted Levenshtein distance (11). The
edit distance between two CDR3 strings is the number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions
required to convert one string into the other. The somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a given clone
was determined by comparing every unique sequence in the clone to the most similar VH germline
gene sequence. SHM is defined as the percentage of mismatching nucleotides compared to the
closest corresponding germline gene. Only the VH portion, not the CDR3 or J-region, was included
in the SHM calculation. CDR3 sequence analysis was performed using Geneious Prime 2020.1.2.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.2 GraphPad Software,
La Jolla California USA) and R software (URL http://www.R-project.org/). Kruskal-Wallis
ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparison tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare
between groups, or one-way ANOVA with non-parametric test for trend, as appropriately
indicated. Non-parametric Spearman correlations or simple logistic regression analyses were used
to determine associations between analyzed parameters.

Frequencies of B cells and plasmablasts as characterized in Figure 2. Cat = disease category. HD
= healthy donor. # reps, number of replicate sequencing libraries (independently amplified from
genomic DNA). Total copies are sequence copies aggregated at the subject level. Total unique,
unique sequences with each unique sequence variant counted only once across all replicate
libraries from the same individual. Total clones, aggregated at the individual level with each clone
only counted once. Clonally related sequences have the same VH gene and JH gene assignment,
have identical third complementarity determining region (CDR3) sequence length and share 85%
or more identity at the amino acid sequence level in the CDR3 (see Materials and Methods).
