Abstract

2

Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly

3

appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity1–3. However, an

4

unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute

5

to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based

6

single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4

7

COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with

8

immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex

9

parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This

10

arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and

11

choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel,

12

peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the

13

phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter

14

homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons—evolutionarily expanded in

15

humans4—show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic

16

vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are

17

not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with

18

those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive

19

function, schizophrenia, and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular

20

framework and new opportunities to understand COVID-19 related neurological disease.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent

24

of the COVID-19 global pandemic, has as of October 2020 infected over 40 million people and

25

caused over a million deaths worldwide (worldometers.info/coronavirus). Though SARS-CoV-2

26

primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that COVID-19 patients

27

can suffer neurological and psychiatric symptoms of varied severity, depending on SARS-CoV-2

28

mechanisms as well as other variables, such as co-morbidities and clinical care1–3,5. Central

29

nervous system (CNS) symptoms range from loss of smell and headache to memory loss,

30

encephalitis, stroke, difficulty concentrating, and persistent fatigue1,6–8. Symptoms are especially

31

frequent and prominent in the over 20% of COVID-19 patients that require hospitalization1,9–11.

32

With lingering CNS symptoms documented in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and

33

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) survivors1,12–14, it remains to be seen whether such

34

chronic symptoms will emerge in COVID-19 survivors.

35

Cellular and molecular approaches are required to understand the neurological changes

36

that may contribute to symptoms reported in COVID-19 patients. Fundamentally, pathology can

37

arise from the direct infection of neurons and glia or indirectly from peripheral infection and its

38

attendant immune response15,16. Viral RNA has been detected in the olfactory mucosa and

39

cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in some cases, but the consequences for brain cells remain unclear17–

41

reached conflicting conclusions regarding the potential for SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion21–26. The

42

physiological relevance of such cultured systems, from the viral titers applied to their fidelity to

43

actual patient brains, also remains unclear23,27,28. Missing so far is an unbiased view of the

44

molecular and cellular perturbations across brain cell types in COVID-19 patients. This is in part

45

because high-quality human brain tissue from patients for such studies is largely

46

inaccessible21,23,24. Furthermore, several brain regions highly relevant to COVID-19, such as the

47

choroid plexus23,24, have not yet been successfully profiled in humans at single-cell resolution, in

48

health or disease29.

. Several reports using elegant in vitro culture systems, such as neuronal organoids, have

Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal

50

cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient (Fig. 1a).

51

We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of

52

SARS-CoV-2. These data—which includes the first, to our knowledge, single-cell view of

53

neurological changes in COVID-19 and of the human choroid plexus in general—provide a

54

molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 affects the brain without requiring direct

55

neuroinvasion; reveals the major pathways and cell types perturbed; and highlights associations

56

with chronic CNS diseases potentially pertinent to COVID-19 survivors. We created an

interactive data browser (https://twc-stanford.shinyapps.io/scRNA_Brain_COVID19), which will

be updated as more patient samples become available, to provide a resource for researchers to

59

further dissect the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2’s impacts on the brain.

61
62

Cell type-specific gene expression changes in the COVID-19 brain
We aimed to gain insight into the cell type–specific transcriptomic effects of COVID-19

63

on the brain by performing unbiased single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of 15 fresh-

64

frozen postmortem medial frontal cortex and lateral ventricle choroid plexus samples from 10

65

non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient of similar clinical course as the COVID-19

66

patients (Extended Data Table 1). Our sample sizes were similar to those reported in previous

67

snRNA-seq studies30–32. Samples in the control and COVID-19 groups were between 58 and 91

68

years old and matched for tissue dissection area and RNA quality (Extended Data Fig. 1,

69

Extended Data Table 1). Cause of death for COVID-19 and influenza patients was consistently

70

interstitial pneumonia after more than two weeks of mechanical ventilation. Two COVID-19

71

patients experienced objective neurological symptoms during care (Extended Data Table 1).

72

Samples were not confounded by technical or batch artifacts (Extended Data Fig. 2).

73

To begin, we generated 23,626 single-nuclei gene expression profiles from the medial

74

frontal cortex (4 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, 1 influenza)—and detected a median of 1,486 genes

75

per nucleus, a yield that is in line with recent snRNA-seq studies (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig.

76

1)31–34. We performed unbiased clustering of nuclear profiles to identify and annotate 8 cell

77

types, including subtypes of excitatory neurons and interneurons. Each annotated cell type

78

expressed previously established marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 3): excitatory neurons

79

(e.g., marked by CBLN2 and NRGN), inhibitory neurons (GAD1), astrocytes (AQP4),

80

oligodendrocytes (MBP and ST18), microglia (DOCK8), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells

81

(VCAN), maturing neurons (DACH1), and endothelial cells (LEPR)—though this latter

82

population also contains mixed markers for vascular mural pericytes and smooth muscle cells,

83

as in prior reports32,34,35. Overall, the cell type identities, markers, and proportions match prior

84

snRNA-seq data from adult human cortex (Extended data Fig. 1-4, Extended Data Table 2)31–34.

85

We compared levels of gene expression in cells isolated from COVID-19 versus non-

86

viral control individuals by cell type and identified 2,194 unique differentially expressed genes

87

(DEGs) that implicated all major cell types (Extended Data Table 3). As recently reported in

88

Alzheimer’s disease (AD)34, neurons exhibited a strong signature of repression—73% of DEGs

89

in excitatory neurons and 65% in interneurons were downregulated—whereas DEGs in glial

90

oligodendrocytes, OPCs, astrocytes, and microglia were more balanced (36-51%, Fig. 1c-d).

91

The number of DEGs was greatest for astrocytes, excitatory neurons, and oligodendrocytes,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.349415; this version posted October 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

92

partially reflecting increased power in these higher-abundance cell types. The vast majority of

93

DEGs were perturbed in only a single cell type (~84%, Fig. 1e-f, Extended Data Fig. 5a), further

94

indicating a cell type-specific CNS response to COVID-19. However, the minority of shared

95

DEGs clustered into meaningful pathways: for example, commonly downregulated DEGs

96

implicated impairments in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)

97

signaling (Fig. 1f), both critical for homeostatic neuronal function36–40. Overall, these results

98

indicate that all major brain parenchymal cell types are affected at the transcriptional level by

99

COVID-19, and that single-cell-level resolution is critical because changes in gene expression—

100

including directionality—are dependent on cell type.

101
102
103

SARS-CoV-2 accumulation in barrier cells stimulates inflammatory signaling to the brain
The observed transcriptional response to COVID-19 in the brain could arise from direct

104

neurotropism or indirect damage via peripheral inflammation15,16. We thus stained for the SARS-

105

CoV-2 spike glycoprotein20,41 in medial frontal cortex and choroid plexus tissue immediately

106

adjacent to tissue used in snRNA-seq. Intriguingly, we detected spike glycoprotein robustly in

107

two COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2). Upon closer examination however, spike glycoprotein signal

108

resided only within the barrier-forming cortical vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus.

109

Within the choroid plexus, signal appeared within the stromal compartment, though confident

110

cell type assignment was not possible (Fig. 2c). Thus, unlike recent reports where SARS-CoV-2

111

was added directly to neuroglial organoids lacking brain-barrier cells21–25, we do not observe

112

significant virus invasion in cortex parenchymal cells. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection

113

of the CSF-barrier forming choroid plexus and meninges corroborates recent in vitro, in silico,

114

CSF, and postmortem case studies suggesting CNS barrier cells can support productive

115

infection at relatively low titers5,23,24,42,43. We note however that this absence of detectable

116

SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion does not exclude its possibility. Likewise, it is possible that the

117

other two COVID-19 patients sustain SARS-CoV-2 barrier cell infection undetected in the tissue

118

sampled. Corroborating a recent study5, presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS did not correlate

119

with neurological symptoms (Extended Data Table 1). Together, these results suggest that

120

brain-barrier cells may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that preferential

121

accumulation of virus in the barriers may give rise to widespread cortical DEGs.

122

Because we detected SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in the blood-brain and blood-

123

CSF-barrier cells, we sought to devise methods to profile these cells and better understand their

124

relation to cortical transcriptional perturbations with COVID-19. However, conventional brain

125

snRNA-seq preparation methods nearly universally deplete high-quality brain vascular nuclei

126

from endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts for currently unknown

127

reasons32–35. At the same time, no snRNA-seq study exists on the human choroid plexus, in

128

health or disease. This could, as we discovered, be because enzymatic and dounce

129

homogenization techniques successfully used to process mouse tissue29 resulted in a near

130

complete loss of genes in isolated human choroid nuclei. We thus generated a method involving

131

successive gentle triturations in mild detergent (Methods), yielding 24,052 nuclei across 7 major

132

epithelial, mesenchymal, immune, and glial cell types (6 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, 1 influenza; Fig.

133

3a, Extended Data Fig. 4, Extended Data Table 4).

134

Epithelial cells accounted for 81% of choroid nuclei profiled, and interestingly,

135

subclustered based on expression of the receptor (PRLR) for prolactin—a hormone mediating

136

neurogenesis44,45—, the glutathione peroxidase GPX3—which protects the CSF from

137

hydroperoxides46—, and the chloride anion exchanger SLC26A3—which may maintain

138

physiologic ion concentrations in the CSF47. Similar to brain vascular cells16,48, the choroid

139

barrier and stromal epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and ependymal cells robustly

140

expressed the antiviral defense gene IFITM3. Intriguingly, we observed a broad upregulation of

141

IFITM3 across barrier cells in COVID-19 patients, consistent with immunohistochemical

142

detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3b). IFITM3 serves as the first line of defense against

143

viral infection49 and its upregulation is a marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection across publicly

144

available datasets50. We also observed in the cortex parenchyma a consistent upregulation of

145

the newly described viral entry receptor NRP141,51,52 (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6), which has

146

been previously found upregulated in inflamed COVID-19 lung tissue51,53.

147

Overall, the DEGs detected in choroid epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and

148

monocytes indicate strong CNS inflammation in COVID-19 (Fig. 3c-e, Extended Data Table 5).

149

For example, we observed upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which has been

150

reported sufficient to induce pathologic microglial and astrocyte activation54,55. The coincident

151

upregulation of IL-1β, CCL2, and CCL4 further suggests a weakened choroid barrier and an

152

increasingly permissive environment for immune cell transmigration into the brain

153

parenchyma56–58. The aged choroid plexus has recently been reported to send inflammatory

154

signals to the brain, thereby activating glia and impairing cognitive function59,60. To assess if

155

similar pro-inflammatory signaling mechanisms occur in COVID-19, we performed cell-cell

156

communication analysis61,62. We observed a strong increase in choroid-to-cortex signaling

157

across key inflammatory pathways, such as the CCL and CXCL family of chemokines (Fig. 3f,

158

Extended Data Fig. 5b). Together, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.349415; this version posted October 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

159

inflame brain-barrier cells, including the choroid plexus; and that this barrier—together with

160

peripheral—inflammation is then relayed into the brain parenchyma.

161
162
163

Immune cell infiltration and activation of neuronal engulfment programs in microglia
We sought to evaluate the predicted activation of brain microglia and migration of

164

peripheral immune cells via enhanced inflammatory signaling from the periphery and brain-

165

barrier cells. Intriguingly, we observed in the cortex a COVID-19 enriched subpopulation of

166

microglia (Fig. 4a-b, Extended Data Fig. 7-8). This cluster was marked by expression of genes

167

implicated in human microglial activation, such as CD74, FTL, and FTH1 (Extended Data Table

168

6). These very genes have recently been described as difficult to detect by snRNA-seq63, further

169

underscoring strong COVID-19 microglial activation. An over-represented fraction of COVID-19

170

microglia cluster marker genes overlap (P < 10-25, hypergeometric test) with human Alzheimer’s

171

disease microglia cluster markers34 (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Monocle trajectory analysis64 found

172

that the COVID-19 microglia cluster emerged from the parent homeostatic population—and that

173

the expression of activation markers increased along the pseudotime route—, suggesting that

174

these microglia emerged in response to an increasingly inflamed CNS environment (Fig. 4c,

175

Extended Data Fig. 7a-b), consistent with enhanced brain-barrier inflammatory signaling. Our

176

observations suggest that the COVID-19 subpopulation represents a distinct microglial state

177

that shares features with, but is ultimately different from, microglial cell states previously

178

reported in human neurodegenerative disease.

179

We next assessed the predicted increase in peripheral immune cell infiltration. We

180

indeed found both an increase in T-cells (marked by CD247 encoding the TCR CD3-zeta

181

protein, Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 8e) and an increase in peripheral macrophages (marked by

182

F13A165,66, Fig. 4e). Microglial activation and enhanced immune cell infiltration have been

183

recently reported by IHC staining in a series of 43 COVID-19 brains, with the degree of

184

infiltration and glial activation not clearly correlated with neurological symptoms or the presence

185

of detectable virus in the brain5. Our results largely corroborate those findings via an orthogonal

186

snRNA-seq approach (Fig. 4a-e). Both the formation of a distinct microglial cluster and the

187

enhanced infiltration of peripheral T-cells and macrophages did not occur in terminal influenza,

188

suggesting a COVID-19 specific—or at least not a pan-viral—CNS response.

189

Because we collected sufficient microglia for DEG analysis, we sought a clearer

190

understanding of the functional ramifications of their COVID-19 activation. As expected,

191

established markers of microglial activation previously linked to pathologic functions such as

192

CD74 and MERTK were strongly upregulated67–74. We observed a concomitant loss of the

193

immune checkpoint molecules MEF2C and IRAK3 that restrain runaway inflammation75–77.

194

Recently, increased microglial phagocytosis of live neurons—termed phagoptosis—has been

195

demonstrated to be an important mechanism driving various neurodegenerative diseases71,78–81.

196

Remarkably, nearly every gene reported81 to mediate microglial phagocytosis of live neurons is

197

strongly upregulated in COVID-19 microglia (Fig. 4g). These include the genes encoding

198

complement proteins C3, all three components of C1Q, and the pro-phagocytic receptors

199

MERTK and VNR. Together, these data reveal in the COVID-19 brain the infiltration of immune

200

cells and strong activation of a pathologic microglial phagocytosis program predicted to

201

prematurely engulf and prune live neurons.

202
203
204

Potential synaptic dysfunction specifically in layer 2/3 excitatory neurons
The global induction of microglial phagoptosis programs prompted us to look into other

205

potential signatures of neuronal compromise. Astrocytes play a dual role in both forming the glia

206

limitans barrier82,83 and supporting homeostatic neuronal function84–86 (Fig. 5a). Given SARS-

207

CoV-2 infection of barrier cells, we thus wondered whether astrocytes would exhibit similar

208

hallmarks of inflammation with concomitant consequences for neuronal health. We indeed

209

observed hallmarks of astrogliosis87 and viral defense50 in upregulated GFAP and IFITM3

210

expression, as well as neurotoxicity in the secreted factor CHI3L188–90 (Fig. 3b, Fig. 5a-d).

211

Forming a tripartite synapse with neurons, astrocytes finely balance the levels of synaptic

212

neurotransmitters like glutamate via the dedicated transporters EEAT1 (SLC1A3) and EEAT2

213

(SLC1A2)91–93. Dysregulated glutamate transporter expression causes neuronal dysfunction:

214

downregulation results in excess glutamate excitotoxicity94,95 and extrasynaptic spillover96,97;

215

whereas upregulation impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity98–101. We

216

observed dysregulated overexpression of genes predicting diminished glutamate signaling

217

across synapses: for example, the overexpression of both glutamate transporters (SLC1A2 and

218

SLC1A3, Fig. 5a, e) as well as the major potassium uptake channel Kir4.1 (KCNJ10), which

219

reduces neuronal excitability by lowering extracellular potassium, glutamate, and BDNF102.

220

We next sought to identify the neuronal subtypes affected in COVID-19. Enrichment

221

analysis implicated potential impairments in synaptic transmission specifically in excitatory

222

neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9). Among COVID-19 patients, those with objective neurological

223

symptoms or detectable virus did not exhibit further deficits in the expression of genes

224

mediating synaptic transmission (Extended Data Fig. 9c, Extended Data Table 1). Glutamate

225

release at synapses is critical for fast and faithful communication between neurons for

226

information processing in sub-second timeframes103–105. Glutamate is stored in readily

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.349415; this version posted October 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

227

releasable pools of vesicles within presynaptic terminals. During synaptic transmission, SNARE

228

proteins play an indispensable role in vesicle docking, priming, fusion, and synchronization of

229

glutamate release into the synaptic cleft103,104. Downregulation of the mRNA encoding SNARE

230

components has been found in various neurological diseases106–109, and is sufficient in

231

experimental models to impair both vesicle processing and overall neuronal viability110–114. We

232

observed in COVID-19 excitatory neurons a consistent downregulation of major SNARE

233

components (Fig. 5f). For example, genes encoding both v-SNARE synaptobrevins (VAMP1,

234

VAMP2) necessary for calcium-dependent glutamate release115,116 decreased. Likewise,

235

expression diminished for the partner t-SNARE proteins syntaxin 1B (STX1B) and SNAP-25,

236

also necessary117,118 for glutamate release.

237

The human neocortex is composed of six layers of interconnected excitatory and

238

inhibitory neurons, with each layer both highly specialized locally and integrated globally. Of

239

these six layers, layers 2 and 3 are disproportionately thickened during the evolution of the

240

human brain, playing a key role in higher brain functions such as cognition, learning, memory,

241

creativity, and abstraction4,119,120. Though we captured neurons from all cortical layers, we found

242

that gene expression changes linked to synaptic deficits are specific to only these layer 2/3

243

excitatory neurons (Fig. 5g). L2/3 excitatory neurons already exhibit sparse action potential

244

firing to generate a simple and reliable neural code for associative learning120. Thus, this

245

neuronal population may be particularly sensitive to the predicted deficits in neurotransmission

246

with COVID-19. Together, these data suggest potential impairments in L2/3 neuron synaptic

247

transmission, plasticity, and LTP in COVID-19, due to the dysregulation of genes mediating

248

astrocyte glutamate homeostasis and genes encoding major synaptic vesicle components.

249
250
251

Associations with chronic CNS disease
Reports of lingering CNS complications in COVID-19 survivors are emerging121. To

252

provide a molecular rationale for these complications, we compared COVID-19 cell type-specific

253

DEGs with those recently described by snRNA-seq in chronic CNS diseases, including

254

Alzheimer’s disease34, multiple sclerosis122, Huntington’s disease123, and autism spectrum

255

disorder33. Surprisingly, the overlap of DEGs between COVID-19 and these chronic CNS

256

diseases was over-represented for each cell type (Fig. 6a, Extended Data Fig. 10, Extended

257

Data Table 7). The degree of overlap was particularly high in astrocytes and excitatory neurons.

258

For example, genes encoding the SNARE protein SNAP-25 and the neurotrophic factor BDNF

knowledge—and even treatment approaches—may be relevant to COVID-19 neuropathology.

262

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed insight into the molecular

263

pathways involved in complex traits and diseases124,125. GWAS variants suggest an important

264

role for a given gene through its loss or gain of function or expression. Thus, differential

265

expression of GWAS genes in COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these trait and disease

266

pathways32. To determine the enrichment of COVID-19 DEGs within genetic variants associated

267

with complex traits and diseases in a cell type-specific fashion, we obtained GWAS summary

268

statistics for neurological and psychiatric disorders and neurobehavior traits (Extended Data

269

Table 8)125–127. We found a strong enrichment of DEGs residing within GWAS hits of various

270

disorders and traits, especially in cognition, schizophrenia, and depression (Fig. 6b). These

271

particular disorders have been associated with dysfunction in L2/3 neurons and astrocytes128–

Discussion
Recent snRNA-seq studies have elucidated the cell type-specific processes involved in

278

several CNS diseases32–35,122,123. Here, by combining sequencing of 47,678 nuclei in both frontal

279

cortex and choroid plexus along with IHC detection of SARS-CoV-2 in brain-barrier cells, we

280

reveal several major neuropathological mechanisms in severe COVID-19. Based on gene

281

expression patterns uncovered in this study, we propose a model where SARS-CoV-2 infected

282

brain-barrier cells can relay and permit inflammatory signaling into the cortex parenchyma. In

283

this inflammatory milieu, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate neuronal

284

phagocytosis programs, and astrocyte homeostatic properties become dysregulated. Microglial

285

activation is sufficient to induce a COVID-19 specific subpopulation. Together, these

286

perturbations may converge on impaired neuronal function, with L2/3 excitatory neurons in

287

particular exhibiting a transcriptomic signature of compromised glutamate transmission and

288

information processing4,119,120.

289

There are, however, limitations to consider given the unique logistical circumstances of a

290

pandemic. With most postmortem COVID-19 brain tissue immediately fixed42 or not handled

291

with snRNA-seq studies in mind for safety and regulatory reasons, there is a lack of the high-

292

quality tissue necessary for such studies21,23,24. This has precluded larger study cohorts that

293

could be more representative of COVID-19 patients as a whole. For example, while we and a

294

recent IHC-based study of 43 patient brains5 (the largest to date) do not find a clear correlation

295

between detectable brain SARS-CoV-2 and glial inflammation or neurological symptoms, this

296

may not be representative of all patients, especially those without pre-existing co-morbidities or

297

who do not require ventilation136. Furthermore, the associations with chronic CNS disease may

298

not be relevant in mild COVID-19 disease and may change over time in severe COVID-19

299

survivors. Long-term postmortem studies of survivors after the acute phase of disease are not

300

currently possible to assess this. However, there is precedent for acute viral infections causing

301

long-term inflammation and dysfunction predisposing neurodegenerative disease137–140.

302

Understanding the underlying mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 affects the brain may

303

inform therapeutic approaches121. Most molecular studies to date on SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism

304

have made powerful use of cultured organoids, though they have reached conflicting

305

conclusions21–26. Here, in postmortem COVID-19 patient tissue, we find that the blood-brain and

306

blood-CSF barrier cells typically lacking in organoid models are of high physiologic relevance in

307

informing questions of neurotropism. By combining IHC with a new method to process human

308

choroid plexi tissue for snRNA-seq, we propose that infection of brain-barrier cells can generate

309

a depot of strong antiviral inflammation and compromise barrier function, combining to inflame

310

the brain parenchyma. Such brain-barrier relay and permeability mechanisms have been found

311

important in brain aging59,141–144. Thus, COVID-19’s impact on the brain, like many of its other

312

properties, may follow a nuanced—but potentially therapeutically targetable—mechanism of

313

action. We propose that the development of new techniques to study human brain-barrier cells

314

will further help elucidate disease processes in COVID-19 and beyond.

315

The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic means thousands of people may suffer

316

neurological symptoms, with some facing lifelong problems as a result. Our results nominate

317

COVID-19 pathologic processes in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons not seen in a patient

318

suffering terminal influenza infection. The particular vulnerability of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons

319

in COVID-19 provides a consistent molecular hypothesis for emerging neurological complaints,

320

from “brain fog” to memory loss to difficulty concentrating11,145,146. Several COVID-19

321

perturbations revealed here may be addressable with existing medications147. However, as is

322

the case for recent human transcriptomic studies, additional research will be required to link the

323

observed cell type-specific gene expression changes with neurological symptoms32,33,35,122,123.

324

Nevertheless, these studies have served as important resources for understanding the

325

molecular and cellular basis of disease and for formulating new lines of investigation. In

326

summary, this work sheds insight into and provides new opportunities to explore the acute and

327

lasting neurological consequences of COVID-19.

Methods
Isolation of nuclei from frozen post-mortem medial frontal gyrus
Frozen medial frontal cortex tissue from post-mortem control and COVID-19 patients were
obtained from the Stanford/ VA/ NIA Aging Clinical Research Center (ACRC) and the Saarland
University Hospital Institute for Neuropathology, with approval from local ethics committees.
Group characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1. The protocol for the isolation of
nuclei was adapted from previous studies32,34,35,148,149, and performed in a BSL2+ Biosafety
Cabinet wearing PPE. All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4°C. Briefly, 50 mg of postmortem brain tissue was dounce homogenized in 2 ml of Nuclei EZ Prep Lysis Buffer (Sigma,
NUC101) spiked with 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor (Takara, 2313A) and EDTA-free Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 11873580001) before incubating on ice for 5 min in a final volume of 5
ml. Homogenized tissue was filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer (Falcon, 352360), mixed
with an equal volume of 50% iodixanol density gradient medium in PBS (OptiPrep, SigmaAldrich, D1556) to make a final concentration of 25% iodixanol. 30% iodixanol was layered
underneath the 25% mixture. Similarly, 40% iodixanol was layered underneath the 30%
iodixanol. In a swinging-bucket centrifuge, nuclei were centrifuged for 20 min at 3,000 r.c.f. After
centrifugation, the nuclei were present at the interface of the 30% and 40% iodixanol solutions.
Isolated nuclei were resuspended in 1% BSA with 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor, filtered twice
through a 40 μm strainer (Flowmi), and counted on an TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad)
after the addition of Trypan Blue. We did not use statistical methods to pre-determine sample
sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications30–32.
Isolation of nuclei from frozen post-mortem choroid plexus
Frozen choroid plexus tissue was extracted from the lateral ventricles of post-mortem tissue
obtained from the Stanford University Pathology department and the Saarland University
Hospital Institute for Neuropathology, with approval from local ethics committees. Group
characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1. All procedures were carried out on ice
or at 4°C, and in a BSL2+ Biosafety Cabinet wearing PPE. Dounce homogenization or
enzymatic dissociation successfully used for mice choroid plexi29 resulted in loss of nuclei
integrity and low nuclei complexity (<50 median genes/ nuclei). We hypothesized that like
shaking an apple tree, gentle pipetting of choroid plexi tissue in lysis buffer could liberate nuclei
without needing to physically disintegrate the fibrous choroid matrix—and thus avoid collateral
physical damage to nuclei. Specifically, 40 mg of choroid plexus tissue was thawed in 250 μl of
1% BSA with 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor until the tissue settled. 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris,
10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute (Roche/ Sigma, 11754599001), 0.2 U
μl−1 RNase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor) was added and tissue incubated on ice for 10
minutes with gentle swirling every 2 minutes. 5 ml of 1% BSA was added and the tissue
triturated 10 times with a 5 ml serological pipette. After centrifugation (500g, 5 min), pelleted
nuclei were resuspended in 1% BSA with 0.2 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor; gently triturated 10 times
with a 1 ml regular-bore pipette tip; and filtered twice through a 70 μm and then a 40 μm strainer
(Flowmi). Debris was inspected on a brightfield microscope and nuclei were counted on an
TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad) after the addition of Trypan Blue.
Droplet-based snRNA-sequencing
For droplet-based snRNA-seq, libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single
Cell 3ʹ v3.1 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics), targeting 10,000 nuclei
per sample after counting with a TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad). 13 cycles were
applied to brain parenchyma samples to generate cDNA, and 15 for choroid plexus samples. All
samples underwent 15-16 cycles for final library generation. Generated snRNA-seq libraries
were sequenced across two S4 lanes on a NovaSeq 6000 (150 cycles, Novogene).

snRNA-seq quality control
Gene counts were obtained by aligning reads to the hg38 genome (refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020A) using CellRanger software (v.4.0.0) (10x Genomics). To account for unspliced nuclear
transcripts, reads mapping to pre-mRNA were counted. As previously published, a cut-off value
of 200 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) was used to select single nuclei for further analysis34.
As initial reference, the entire dataset was projected onto two-dimensional space using Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) on the top 20 principal components150. Three
approaches were combined for quality control: (1) ambient cell free mRNA contamination was
removed using SoupX151 for each individual sample; (2) outliers with a high ratio of
mitochondrial (>5%, <200 features) relative to endogenous RNAs and homotypic doublets (>
5000 features) were removed in Seurat152; and (3) after scTransform normalization and
integration, doublets and multiplets were filtered out using DoubletFinder with subsequent
manual inspection and filtering based on cell type-specific marker genes153. Genes detected in
fewer than 4 cells were excluded. After applying these filtering steps, the dataset contained
47,678 high-quality nuclei.
Cell annotations
Seurat’s Integration function was used to align data with default settings. Genes were projected
into principal component (PC) space using the principal component analysis (RunPCA). The
first 80 (for global object), 30 (choroid plexus), or 25 (specific cell types) dimensions were used
as inputs into Seurat’s FindNeighbors, FindClusters (at 0.2 resolution) and RunUMAP functions.
Briefly, a shared-nearest-neighbor graph was constructed based on the Euclidean distance
metric in PC space, and cells were clustered using the Louvain method. RunUMAP functions
with default settings was used to calculate 2-dimensional UMAP coordinates and search for
distinct cell populations. Positive differential expression of each cluster against all other clusters
(MAST) was used to identify marker genes for each cluster154. We annotated cell-types using
previously published marker genes31,33–35.
Differential gene expression and sub-cluster analysis
Differential gene expression of genes comparing controls, COVID-19, and influenza samples—
or comparing cell type sub-cluster markers—was done using the MAST154 algorithm, which
implements a two-part hurdle model. Seurat default Log (fold change) > 0.25 (absolute value),
adjusted P value (Bonferroni correction) < 0.05, and expression in greater than 10% of cells
were required to consider a gene differentially expressed. Biological pathway and gene ontology
enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr155, Metascape156, or GeneTrail 3157 with input
species set to Homo sapiens156 and using standard parameters. Docking, processing, and viral
defense genes relevant to SARS-CoV-2 were chosen based on Iadecola, et al16. To identify
microglia sub-cluster markers, differential expression analysis of cells grouped in each subcluster was performed against the remaining cells within the given cell-type. Markers were
defined based on the MAST algorithm using only positive values with Log (fold change) > 0.25
(absolute value), adjusted P value (Bonferroni correction) < 0.01. Enrichment/ overrepresentation of the overlap between markers defining the COVID-19 microglia 2 cluster and
the Mathys34 Alzheimer’s disease Mic1 cluster followed the hypergeometric probability, using
the set of 17,926 protein-coding genes as background.
Monocle trajectory analysis
Monocle3 (v.0.2.1.) was used to generate the pseudotime trajectory analysis in microglia64.
Cells were re-clustered as above and used as input into Monocle to infer cluster and lineage
relationships within a given cell type. Specifically, UMAP embeddings and cell sub-clusters
generated from Seurat were converted to a cell_data_set object using SeuratWrappers (v.0.2.0)

and then used as input to perform trajectory graph learning and pseudo-time measurement
through reversed graph embedding with Monocle.
Viral transcripts
To search for SARS-CoV-2 reads, raw fastq files were subjected to read alignment via ViralTrack158 or centrifuge159 using the human (GRCh38) genome reference. For Viral-Track both a
collection of 12,163 consensus virus sequences from Virusite160 (release 2020.3) and 17,133
curated SARS-CoV-2 genomes from NCBI (downloaded on 29-09-2020) were used. For
centrifuge, a preprocessed virus index compiled by genexa containing among other viruses 138
SARS-CoV-2 genomes was used. We also adopted a complementary approach161 focusing on
SARS-CoV-2 reads, whereby barcoded but unmapped BAM reads were aligned using STAR to
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, with a less stringent mapping parameter
(outFilterMatchNmin 25-30) than the original Viral-Track pipeline.
Cell-cell communication
Cell-cell interactions based on the expression of known ligand-receptor pairs in different cell
types were inferred using CellChatDB61 (v.0.02). To identify potential cell-cell communication
networks perturbed or induced in COVID-19 patient brains, we focused on differentially
expressed ligands in choroid plexus epithelium, microglia, and astrocytes; and differentially
expressed receptor pairs in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Briefly, we followed the official
workflow and loaded the normalized counts into CellChat and applied the preprocessing
functions identifyOverExpressedGenes, identifyOverExpressedInteractions, and projectData
with standard parameters set. As database we selected the Secreted Signaling pathways and
used the pre-compiled human Protein-Protein-Interactions as a priori network information. For
the main analyses the core functions computeCommunProb, computeCommunProbPathway,
and aggregateNet were applied using standard parameters and fixed randomization seeds.
Finally, to determine the senders and receivers in the network the function
netAnalysis_signalingRole was applied on the netP data slot.
GWAS
From the GWAS catalog126, we obtained GWAS risk genes for neurological disorders
[Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain aging, multiple system
atrophy (MSA), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and narcolepsy], psychiatric
disorders [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder, depression,
psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizophrenia], and neurobehavior traits
[Anxiety, suicidality, insomnia, neuroticism, risk behavior, intelligence, and cognitive function].
We removed gene duplicates and GWAS loci either not reported or in intergenic regions and
used a P < 9 × 10−6 to identify significant associations32. Then, since GWAS signals can point to
multiple candidate genes within the same locus, we focused on the ‘Reported Gene(s)’ (genes
reported as associated by the authors of each GWAS study). Disorders and traits exhibiting a
significant number of genes also perturbed in COVID-19 patients are highlighted. Following
gene symbol extraction, we curated the gene set by (1) removing unknown or outdated gene
names using the HGNChelper package (v.0.8.6), (2) converting remaining Ensembl gene IDs to
actual gene names using the packages ensembldb (v.2.10.0) and EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86
(v.2.99.0), and (3) removing any remaining duplicates. We then calculated the overlap between
each set of GWAS genes with the cell type-specific DEGs. Finally, a statistical enrichment of
each overlap against background was calculated using a hypergeometric test with the total
background size set equal to the number of unique RNAs mapped in our data set (29,431).
Comparison of DEGs in chronic CNS disease

We compiled cell type-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reported in published
datasets for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)34, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)33, Huntington’s
disease (HD)123, and Multiple sclerosis (MS)122. Lists of gene symbols were curated using the
aforementioned approach. COVID-19 DEGs that overlap with those found across the selected
CNS diseases were called shared, whereas those not previously reported were called unique to
COVID-19. Statistical significance calculations of over-representation in DEG overlaps are
based on cumulative hypergeometric P values analogous to the procedure described above.
PVCA and PCA analysis
Briefly, to conduct the Principal Variance Component Analysis (PVCA), we aggregated the
SoupX corrected raw counts for each gene and each biological sample using the aggregateData
function of the muscat package (v.1.2.1). The resulting matrix was normalized by dividing each
feature of a sample by the total counts from that sample, multiplied by a scaling factor of
100,000 and scaling the result using the function log(x+1). As variables we considered the
sample annotation fields "Sample-ID", "Patient-ID", "Sex", "Brain-region", "Disease", "ageBin",
and "nNucleiBin". Since the number of nuclei and age are numeric variables but PVCA is
designed to support factors, we assigned the values into ordered bins, more specifically, into
five half-open (left-closed) intervals of size 1,000 starting at 2,000 for the number of nuclei and
five similarly defined intervals of size 10 starting at 51 for the age. We set the algorithm cut-off
for the minimal variance out of the total variance being explained to be 95%. For each single
annotation variable, or first higher-order combinations of such, at cut-off of 0.005 was applied to
consider them explanatory. All variables (or combinations of such) not passing the threshold
were summarized as Other in the analysis. The residual is then defined as the remaining
proportion of variance not being associated with any of the variables that are explanatory nor
informative to a minor proportion. To conduct Principal Components Analysis (PCA) we
aggregated the log-normalized cell counts from Seurat for each gene and sample using the
aggregateData function from muscat and centered the gene expression vectors before
computing eigenvectors.
Overall in-silico analysis
Analysis and dissection of the data was performed using the statistical programming language
R (v.3.6.3) using the following general-purpose package for loading, saving, and manipulating
data, as well as generating plots, and fitting statistical models: dplyr (v.1.0.0), ggplot2 (v.3.2.2.),
patchwork (v.1.0.1), openxlsx (v.4.1.5), bioconductor-scater (v.1.14.6), bioconductor-dropletutils
(v1.6.1), bioconductor-complexheatmap (v.2.2.0), tidyverse (v.1.3.0), and lsa (v.0.73.2). All
other tasks were performed on an x86_64-based Ubuntu (4.15.0-55-generic kernel) server
cluster.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded human brain tissue (medial frontal cortex, meninges, and choroid plexus)
adjacent to tissue processed for snRNA-seq was subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC).
After deparaffinization and rehydration of 1-3 µm sections, peroxidases were blocked by
incubation in 1% H2O2 for 15 minutes at room temperature. Heat antigen retrieval was
performed by steaming at 98°C in target retrieval solution pH 6.1 (Dako, Carpinteira, CA, USA
#S1699) for 30 minutes. Sections were allowed to cool down at room temperature. Following
antigen retrieval, sections were incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature with the antiSARS spike glycoprotein antibody 3A2 (rabbit, Abcam ab272420 1:100 diluted in Dako REAL
antibody diluent #S2022), which has been validated in previous publications20,41. After three
washes with wash buffer (Dako #S3006), the Dako REAL EnVision HRP kit (#K5007) was used
for the visualization of the antibody reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hemalum (Sigma-Aldrich #1.09249). After
