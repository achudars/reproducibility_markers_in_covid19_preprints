ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a

29

global pandemic. The antigen specificity and kinetics of the antibody response mounted against this

30

novel virus are not understood in detail. Here, we report that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-

31

2 infection exhibit a larger antibody response against the spike and nucleocapsid protein and epitope

32

spreading to subdominant viral antigens, such as open reading frame 8 and non-structural proteins.

33

Subjects with a greater antibody response mounted a larger memory B cell response against the

34

spike, but not the nucleocapsid protein. Additionally, we revealed that antibodies against the spike are

35

still capable of binding the D614G spike mutant and cross-react with the SARS-CoV-1 receptor

36

binding domain. Together, this study reveals that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection

37

exhibit a greater overall antibody response to the spike and nucleocapsid protein and a larger memory

38

B cell response against the spike.

41

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is mediated by surface trimeric spike protein via interaction

42

between the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 21,2. SARS-

43

CoV-2 expresses numerous potential antigens, including four structural proteins (spike, nucleocapsid

44

(N) protein, matrix and envelope protein), 16 nonstructural proteins/antigens (NSP1â€“NSP16), and

45

several accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins, including ORF7 and ORF83,4. To date, little is

46

known about the specificities and kinetics of antibodies elicited in response to this infection and how

47

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity relates to magnitude of the humoral immune

48

response.

49

To address this critically important knowledge gap, we collected plasma samples from 35

50

hospitalized acutely SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 105 convalescent subjects5 (Supplemental

51

Tables 1 and 2). Plasma was tested against the spike, N protein, ORF7a, ORF8, and NSP3, NSP9,

52

NSP10, and NSP15 of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, all subjects within the acutely infected cohort were

53

hospitalized, whereas only 9% (8/105) of subjects in the convalescent cohort had been hospitalized

54

(Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). 89% of acutely infected subjects and 98% of convalescent subjects

55

had detectable antibodies against one or more SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Fig. 1a), with nearly all

56

subjects mounting a response against the spike and N protein (Fig. 1b). We further identified that

57

convalescent subjects mounted a predominant response against the RBD of the spike protein and the

58

RNA-binding domain of the N protein (Extended data Fig. 1a and b), suggesting these domains

59

contain the immunodominant epitopes of these antigens. A larger frequency of acutely infected

60

subjects mounted antibodies against ORF7a, ORF8, and NSP antigens (Fig. 1b, Extended data Fig.

61

1c) suggesting antibodies against these antigens are either short-lived or only induced by more

62

severe infection. Moreover, the anti-N protein antibody response preceded the antibody response

63

against the spike protein and was consistently higher across all time points, peaking between the 2nd

64

and 3rd week after the onset of symptoms and retracting between the 3rd and 4th weeks after symptom

65

onset (Fig. 1c and Extended data Fig. 1d). Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation

66

between the anti-N protein and anti-spike IgG titers in both the acutely infected and convalescent

67

cohorts (Extended data 1e and f), indicating subjects who generally mounted a robust antibody

68

response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection tended to mount a robust response against both antigens.

69

Titers against both the spike and N protein persisted even 2+ months after symptom onset (Fig. 1c),

70

indicating the antibody response against these two antigens is stable amongst subjects with

71

symptomatic infection, a finding consistent with other reports6,7. We did not observe a statistical

72

difference in antibody titers against the spike and N protein by individual subjects in either the acute or

73

convalescent subject cohorts (Fig. 1d and e), likely due to dramatic subject-to-subject variation.

74

However, antibody titers against the spike and N protein were significantly higher than antibody titers

75

against ORF7a and ORF8 (Fig. 1d and e). Together, these data reveal the antibody response against

76

SARS-CoV-2 is largely driven against the spike and N protein and that the anti-N protein antibody

77

response precedes the response against the spike. The differences in the kinetics and magnitude of

78

the N protein response are potentially due to the differences in protein expression, as N protein

79

completely covers the entire viral genome, whereas a single virion only expresses ~26 trimers8.

80

To understand the inter-subject variability within our cohorts, we performed hierarchical

81

clustering of subjects based on antibody titers against the spike, full length and RNA-binding domain

82

of N protein, ORF7a, and ORF8 antigens. From the acutely infected cohort, we identified three

83

clusters: high, mid, and low responders (Fig. 2a and Supplemental Table 3). Notably, the high

84

responder cluster subjects were further from the onset of symptoms at the time of sampling and

85

ultimately were hospitalized for a longer duration than those in the mid and low responder groups (Fig.

86

2b and c). We did not observe a statistical difference in age or sex between the three responder

87

groups (Extended data Fig. 2a and b). Over 25% of subjects in the high responder group had a

88

severe/highest CURB-65 score (Extended data Fig. 2c), a measure of pneumonia severity9,

89

suggesting subjects in the high responder group had more severe infections. We further examined

90

which features of the humoral immune response were driving subjects to segregate into these three

91

clusters. Subjects within the high and mid responder groups robustly induced antibodies against the

92

spike protein, but the high responder subjects mounted a larger response to N protein relative to the

93

mid responder subjects (Fig. 2d-f). Additionally, subjects within the high and mid responder groups

94

were more likely to mount an antibody response against ORF8 and NSP antigens (Extended data Fig.

4

95

2d and e). The low responder group largely did not mount an antibody response against any of the

96

antigens tested (Fig. 2d-f and Extended Data Fig. 2d and e), although it is possible that plasma was

97

collected before the subjects mounted a significant antibody response. Our data reveal that acutely

98

infected subjects who were hospitalized for a longer duration mounted a larger antibody response

99

against N protein and were more likely to mount a response against other SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

100

The convalescent cohort also clustered into three distinct clusters based on the magnitude of

101

the antibody response against the spike and N protein (Fig. 3a and Supplemental Table 4), similar to

102

the acutely infected cohort (Fig. 2). To understand the relationship between infection severity and

103

antibody responses within the convalescent cohort, we scored subjects based on the severity and

104

duration of self-reported symptoms and whether subjects were hospitalized (Supplemental Table 5).

105

Notably, over 50% of subjects within the high responder group had a severe infection (Fig. 3b and

106

Extended data Fig. 3a), indicating infection severity is linked to increased antibody titers. Moreover,

107

subjects within the high responder group typically were older and male (Fig. 3c and d). Subjects within

108

each responder group had a similar duration of symptoms (Extended data Fig. 3b), and subjects

109

within all three groups had a similar amount of time to mount a response, as determined by the

110

number of days since symptoms onset at the time of donation (Extended data Fig. 3c). Unlike the

111

acutely infected cohort, subjects within the high responder group had higher titers against not only the

112

N protein, but also the spike and ORF8 antigens relative to subjects within the mid and low responder

113

groups (Fig. 3e and f, Extended data Fig. 3d and e), and were trending to be more likely to

114

seroconvert against at least one of the NSP antigens tested (Extended data Fig. 3f). Consistent with

115

these data, high and mid responder subjects had higher neutralizing titers than subjects in the low

116

responder cohorts (Fig. 3g). In combination with the acutely infected cohort, our data reveal subjects

117

with more severe infection are mounting a larger antibody response at both acute and convalescent

118

time points.

119

We next dissected the specificities of memory B cells (MBCs) induced by SARS-CoV-2

120

infection by performing B cell ELISpots on polyclonally stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells

121

(PBMCs) isolated from convalescent subjects. Notably, MBCs largely targeted the spike, whereas

5

122

very few MBCs targeted N protein or ORF8 (Fig. 4a). Additionally, subjects in the serum high

123

responder group mounted a larger MBC response against the spike than subjects in the mid and low

124

responder cohorts (Fig. 4b), with serum antibody titers against the spike positively correlating with the

125

magnitude of the anti-spike MBC response (Fig. 4c). Despite the observed differences in anti-spike

126

MBC responses between responder groups, we did not observe any differences in the anti-N protein

127

and anti-ORF8 MBC response in the three responder cohorts (Extended data Fig. 4a and b).

128

Together, these data indicate that the MBC response is largely directed against the spike protein, and

129

that the high serum responder group mounted both a larger secreted antibody and MBC response

130

upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

131

SARS-CoV-2 has acquired a D614G mutation within the spike protein and viruses carrying this

132

mutation have since become the dominant circulating strain globally as of early April10. This mutation

133

is located on the interface between two subunits of the spike trimer and may impact stability of the

134

trimer1. As the subjects within our study were initially infected throughout March and into early April

135

(Supplemental Tables 1 and 2), they were likely infected with the D614 variant. We did not observe a

136

difference in antibody titers against the WT and D614G spike antigens within our acute cohort (Fig.

137

5a), suggesting the D614G epitope was not a major antigenic site. Strikingly, we identified that the

138

convalescent cohort mounted a larger response against the G614 variant than the WT D614 that they

139

were likely infected with (Fig. 5b), potentially due to the increased stability of the G614 variant11.

140

Furthermore, we observed a strong positive correlation between D614 (WT) spike titers and G614

141

titers, indicating antibodies against the WT strain likely protect against the new G614 variant (Fig. 5c).

142

These data indicate that the region that encompasses the D614G mutation is not immunodominant or

143

does not affect the antigenicity of epitopes at or near this site. We also examined whether antibodies

144

targeting the RBD of the spike protein cross-reacted with the RBD proteins of other pandemic threat

145

coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV. We found

146

a positive correlation between antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the SARS-CoV-1

147

RBD, but not the MERS-CoV RBD (Fig. 5d and e). When divided by responder groups (Fig. 2 and 3),

148

subjects in the high and mid responder groups had elevated titers against the SARS-CoV-1 RBD (Fig.

149

5f and g). These data show that subjects who mounted a larger response against the SARS-CoV-2

150

spike protein additionally mounted a larger antibody response against conserved epitopes that cross-

151

react with closely related coronaviruses.

152

Together, our study demonstrates that severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an

153

increase in the magnitude and breadth of the ensuing humoral immune response. Notably, we

154

identified the antibody response is largely mounted against the spike and N proteins, with the

155

magnitude and kinetics of the anti-N protein antibody response outpacing the antibody response

156

against spike. Although both proteins are highly expressed by coronaviruses, there is much more N

157

protein as it encapsulates the whole viral genomic RNA, which is nearly 30 kb in size. As N protein

158

dimer is projected to bind about 30 bp12, there are likely 1000+ N proteins per virion. In sharp contrast,

159

there are only ~26 spike trimers per virion8, suggesting the immunodominance towards N protein may

160

be related to antigen burdens. Likewise, subjects with more severe disease likely have increased viral

161

titers and free antigen in the lung lumen and draining lymph nodes, which could lead to increased

162

antibody titers against nearly all antigens tested. Therefore, epitope spreading of the antibody

163

response may be a factor of the amount of SARS-CoV-2 antigen present.

164

Subjects also mounted an antibody response against the accessory protein ORF8. ORF8 has

165

immunoregulatory properties including the ability to limit type I interferon responses13,14 and

166

downregulate MHC-I presentation to CD8 T cells15. Antibodies targeting ORF8 may limit these

167

immunoregulatory properties, which could improve the host immune response and achieve better

168

clinical disease outcomes. Additionally, we identified antibodies against non-structural proteins

169

involved in viral replication, although antibodies against these antigens are unlikely to provide

170

protection, as these antibodies targeting NSPs would need to be inside of a live cell while virus is

171

replicating. Whether antibodies targeting discrete viral antigens other than the spike are neutralizing,

172

have Fc-mediated effector functions, or are protective during infection remains to be determined.

173

Our study revealed acutely infected subjects who mounted higher antibody response relative

174

to mid and low responder clusters tended to have higher pneumonia severity scores. Consistent with

175

this notion, convalescent subjects who had higher antibody titers were those subjects who had a more

176

severe infection. A recent report identified that subjects who succumbed to COVID-19 tended to

177

mount a larger antibody response against N protein relative to the spike, whereas convalescent

178

subjects tended to focus their antibody response on the spike protein16. However, our study identified

179

that subjects generally had similar antibody responses against the N protein and spike, and infection

180

severity was linked to an increase in antibody responses against both the spike and N protein.

181

Ultimately, our findings on the relationship between infection severity and increased titers against the

182

spike is consistent with a recent surveillance study performed in Iceland6.

183

The best clinical predictors of the magnitude of the antibody responses and epitope spreading

184

within our convalescent cohort were age, sex, and hospitalization. Strikingly, the median age of the

185

high responder cluster was 10+ years greater than the mid and low responder clusters (48 years vs.

186

36 and 38, respectively). Older adults are more likely to be symptomatic and hospitalized with SARS-

187

CoV-2 infection17,18, suggesting increased disease severity and sustained viral titers over a longer

188

period of time could lead to greater antibody titers against multiple viral antigens. Similarly, males

189

were more likely to be segregated into the higher responder group despite the common finding that

190

females generally mount higher antibody responses upon other viral infections and upon

191

vaccination19. Although there is no difference in incidence of COVID-19 in men and women, men have

192

a higher morbidity and mortality rate than women20,21 and likely experience increased viral titers and

193

antigen persistence. Altogether, disease severity is the main clinical predictor of the magnitude of the

194

antibody response mounted against SARS-CoV-2, as men and older adults are more likely to be

195

hospitalized with COVID-19. It remains to be determined whether subjects with more severe disease

196

are more likely to be protected from reinfection with SARS-CoV-2.

197

Together, our data indicate more severe infection is linked to a larger magnitude of circulating

198

antibody and MBC response and increased viral antigen binding breadth across different viral

199

antigens. CD4 T cells are critical for driving antibody responses by mediating germinal center

200

selection of antigen specific B cells. Notably, CD4 T cells targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens

201

and the magnitude of the CD4 T cell response positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody

202

responses22,23. Moreover, subjects with more severe disease demonstrate an increased breadth and

203

magnitude of the memory CD4 T cell response23, which could lead to the larger and broader antibody

204

response of subjects with more severe infection, as observed in our study. The increase in the

205

magnitude of the antibody response and MBC response in subjects with more severe infection could

206

be due to increased CD4 T cell responses, although this was not directly tested in our study.

207

However, subjects who succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated a loss of germinal centers

208

and CD4 T follicular helper cells24. These data in conjunction with our study suggest that an

209

immunological balance will be needed to drive a sufficient secreted antibody response, MBC

210

differentiation, and memory T cell responses that could provide robust protection from reinfection

211

while preventing significant morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods

213

Study cohorts

214

All studies were performed with the approval of the University of Chicago institutional review board

215

and University of Chicago and University of Wisconsin-Madison institutional biosafety committees.

216

Plasma samples from the acutely infected cohort were collected as residual samples submitted to the

217

University of Chicago Medicine Clinical Laboratories. Convalescent subjects were recruited to donate

218

one unit of blood for a convalescent plasma transfusion study, identified as clinical trial

219

NCT04340050. 3 ml of blood and the leukoreduction filter were provided to the Wilson laboratory. All

220

subjects in the acute and convalescent cohorts had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.

221

Recombinant proteins

222

Plasmids for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and spike were provided by Dr. Florian Krammer at Icahn School

223

of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and recombinant proteins were expressed in-house in HEK293F cells.

224

D614G spike protein, SARS-CoV-1 RBD, and MERS-CoV RBD were generated in-house and

225

expressed in HEK293F cells. ORF7a, ORF8, and full-length N proteins were cloned from the 2019-

226

nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain at Washington University. Proteins were expressed in

227

Escherichia coli, with N protein purified as a soluble protein and ORF7a and ORF8 oxidatively

228

refolded from inclusion bodies. NSP antigens and the RNA-binding domain of N protein were provided

229

by Dr. Andrzej Joachimiak at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases at the

230

University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory and were expressed in Escherichia coli.

231

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

232

ELISAs performed in this study were adapted from previously established protocols25,26. Plasma

233

samples were heat-inactivated for 1 hour at 56Â°C. High protein-binding microtiter plates (Costar) were

234

coated with recombinant antigens at 2 Î¼g/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4Â°C.

235

Plates were washed with PBS 0.05% Tween and blocked with 200 Î¼l PBS 0.1% Tween + 3% milk

236

powder for 1 hour at room temperature. Plasma samples were serially diluted in PBS 0.1% Tween +

237

1% milk powder. Plates were incubated with serum dilutions for 2 hours at room temperature.

239

0.1% Tween + 1% milk powder was used to detect binding of antibodies, and after a 1-hour

240

incubation, plates were developed with 100 Î¼l SigmaFast OPD solution (Sigma-Aldrich), with

241

development reaction stopped after 10 minutes using 50 Î¼l 3M HCl. Absorbance was measured at

242

490 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer (BioRad). To detect binding of specific antibody isotypes

243

and subclasses, ELISAs were performed using alternate secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich;

244

Jackson ImmunoResearch; Southern Biotech). End point titers were extrapolated from sigmoidal 4PL

245

(where X is log concentration) standard curve for each sample. Limit of detection (LOD) is defined as

246

the mean plus 2-8 S.D. (depending on antigen) of the O.D. signal recorded using plasma from SARS-

247

CoV-2 negative human subjects. All calculations were performed in Prism 8 (GraphPad).

248

Neutralization assays

249

Neutralization assays were performed by a viral cytopathic effect assay (CPE) using the SARS-CoV-

250

2/UW-001/Human/2020/Wisconsin (UW-001), which was isolated from a mild human case in

251

Wisconsin. Plasma was diluted 1:5 and serially diluted 2-fold and was mixed with an equal volume of

252

virus (100 plaque-forming units) for a starting dilution of 1:10. The plasma/virus mixture was incubated

253

for 30 minutes at 37Â°C and added to TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 cells grown in 1x minimum

254

essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FCS. Cells were incubated with plasma/virus mixture

255

for 3 days, and then were fixed, stained, and analyzed. CPE was observed under an inverted

256

microscope, and neutralization titers were determined as the highest serum dilution that completely

257

prevented CPE.

258

Memory B cell stimulations and enzyme-linked immunospot assays (ELISpot)

259

MBC stimulations were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from

260

subjects in the convalescent cohort. To induce MBC differentiation into antibody secreting cells, 1x106

261

PBMCs were stimulated with 10 ng/ml Lectin Pokeweed Mitogen (Sigma-Aldrich), 1/100,000 Protein A

262

from Staphylococcus aureus, Cowan Strain (Sigma-Aldrich), and 6 Î¼g/ml CpG (Invitrogen) in

263

complete RPMI in an incubator at 37Â°C/5% CO2 for 5 days. After stimulation, cells were counted and

264

added to ELISpot white polysterene plates (Thermo Fisher) coated with 4 Î¼g/ml of SARS-CoV-2 spike

that were blocked with 200 Î¼l of complete RPMI. ELISpot plates were incubated with cells for 16

266

hours overnight in an incubator at 37Â°C/5% CO2. After the overnight incubation, plates were washed

267

and incubated with anti-IgG-biotin and/or anti-IgA-biotin (Mabtech) for 2 hours at room temperature.

268

After secondary antibody incubation, plates were washed and incubated with streptavidin-alkaline

269

phosphatase (Southern Biotech) for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed and developed

270

with NBT/BCIP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2-10 minutes, and reactions were stopped by washing

271

plates with distilled water and allowed to dry overnight before counting. Images were captured with

272

Immunocapture 6.4 software (Cellular Technology Ltd.), and spots were manually counted.

273

Infection Severity Scoring and CURB-65 scoring

274

For the acutely infected cohort, CURB-659 scores were calculated based on confusion, blood urea

275

nitrate levels, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age of subjects. For the convalescent cohort, we

276

designed a severity scoring system (Supplemental Table 5) based on presence of 12 symptoms,

277

duration of symptoms, and hospitalization, with a maximum of 35 points possible. Symptoms were

278

scored based on presence or absence of 12 symptoms, severity (mild or moderate) of symptoms, with

279

a possibility of 17 points. Duration of symptoms was broken down based on the number of weeks of

280

symptoms. Hospitalized subjects were broken down based on oxygen supplementation and intensive

281

care unit (ICU) admission. The criteria for scoring and the classification of certain scores (mild,

282

moderate, severe, and critical infection) were determined before analyzing the data.

283

Heatmaps, hierarchical clustering, and statistical analysis

284

Heatmaps were generated by â€˜pheatmapâ€™ R package (version 1.0.12). Features and subjects were

285

clustered by the hierarchical clustering method implemented in the â€˜pheatmapâ€™ R package. Principal

286

component analyses (PCA) were performed using â€˜factoextraâ€™ R package (version 1.0.7). Subjects

287

were then visualized by their first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) on a 2D map. All

288

statistical analysis was performed using Prism software (Graphpad Version 8), JMP (SAS Institute

289

Version 15), or R (version 3.6.3). Specific tests for statistical significance used are indicated in the

290

corresponding figure legends. P values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically

291

significant.

point titers amongst the high, mid, and low responder clusters from the acutely infected cohort (f; high

374

n=23, mid n=42, and low n=40) and the convalescent cohort (g; high n=23, mid n=42, and low n=40).

375

Data in a were analyzed using a two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Data in b were

376

analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test. For c-e, data were analyzed using a two-tailed Pearson

377

correlation. Data in f and g were analyzed using unpaired non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests.

378

Dashed lines in a, b, f and g are the limit of detection. Bars in f and g represent the median.
