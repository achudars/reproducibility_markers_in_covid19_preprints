Short title: Detection of RNA modifications using nanoDOC

14

Abstract

15

Advances in Nanopore single-molecule direct RNA sequencing (DRS) have presented the possibility

16

of detecting comprehensive post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) as an alternative to experimental

17

approaches combined with high-throughput sequencing. It has been shown that the DRS method can detect

18

the change in the raw electric current signal of a PTM; however, the accuracy and reliability still require

19

improvement.

20

Here, we presented a new software, called nanoDoc, for detecting PTMs from DRS data using a deep neural

21

network. Current signal deviations caused by PTMs are analyzed via Deep One-Class Classification with a

22

convolutional neural network. Using a ribosomal RNA dataset, the software archive displayed an area under

23

the curve (AUC) accuracy of 0.96 for the detection of 23 different kinds of modifications in Escherichia coli

24

and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also demonstrated a tentative classification of PTMs using unsupervised

25

clustering. Finally, we applied this software to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 data and

26

identified commonly modified sites among three groups. nanoDoc is open source (GPLv3) and available at

27

Introduction

30

To date, over 160 different types of post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) have been identified. PTMs

31

have long been known, in tRNA and rRNA, to play an important role in maintaining structure and adjusting

32

codon usage. More recently, an increasing number of PTMs have been identified on other types of RNA (e.g.

33

mRNA and non-coding RNA), and they regulate multiple aspects of RNA function, including alternative

34

splicing, export, stability, and translation. PTMs play a role in the life cycle of various viruses and in the

35

cellular response to a viral infection [1]. One such PTM is N6-methyl adenine (m6A), introduced by the

36

adenine methyltransferase family of enzymes (writers), which is specifically recognized by a set of RNA-

37

binding proteins (readers). In addition, It has discovered that fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)

38

exhibits m6A demethylase (eraser) activity [2]; hence, PTMs are dynamic. The concept that the activity

39

balance between the writers, readers, and eraser modulates cellular functions has been the basis for the

40

rapidly developing field of “epitranscriptomics”. Therefore, transcriptome-wide PTM identification is the

41

key technology for epitranscriptomics.

42

For the first generation of epitranscriptomics tools, experimental methods, including detection of reverse

43

transcription error pattern (RT-signature) with/without a specific chemical [3][4][5][6][7] and

44

immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific to certain PTMs, [8][9] have been developed. Although these

45

experimental methods have been adapted for the different kinds of PTMs, they also have limitations. For

46

example, with respect to RT-signature detection, chemicalconditions are available for only a few types of

47

modifications, and it is difficult to detect all modification sites if they are located in close proximity. Likewise,

48

immunoprecipitation tends to have problems of resolution and antibody specificity. In addition, these

49

experimental methods can only detect one type of modification; since different types of modifications are

50

dynamically acting in cells, a comprehensive method to detect multiple PTMs, with a simple setup, is

51

necessary for further progress in epitranscriptomics.

52

Nanopore single-molecule direct RNA sequencing (DRS) has been shown to be able to detect PTMs in

53

addition to nucleotide base calling [10][11]. DRS has the advantage of detecting the RNA molecule directly,

54

in contrast to short read sequencing, in which information of RNA modification is lost via the process of

55

reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. For the detection of DNA modifications, recurrent

56

neural network (RNN) models, such as DeepSignal [12] or DeepMod [13], have been developed. However,

57

there are numerous types of RNA modifications (e.g. at least 19 types on mRNA), making the application

58

of RNN models difficult, in terms of a deep neural network (DNN) model building and preparing the training

59

data set. One way to acquire the training set for RNA modification is via the chemical synthesis of modified

60

bases [14]. However, chemical synthesis is only available for selected PTMs, and it is difficult to generate

61

all combinations of the modified and unmodified states of the nucleotide sequence. Therefore, the majority

62

of current PTM detection algorithms rely on base-calling errors induced by modifications and external

63

information, such as modification motifs or previously verified modification sites [15] [14]. However, these

64

approaches rely on the external errors of unknown processing, and there is always a chance that any signal

65

could be base-called as a same base to the reference. Furthermore, using a priori data for filtering is

66

problematic when the data source contains errors, and any filtering method could create a bias that suppresses

67

de novo discovery.

68

In another type of algorithm, the raw current signal is aligned against a theoretical signal by either the

69

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [16] [17] [18] or RNN [19], and the difference in raw signal levels is

70

compared. Since the current signal is disturbed by the existence of PTMs, statistical testing such as the

71

Kolmogorov– Smirnov (KS) test [18][20], is used to detect PTMs. Identifying modification sites with these

72

methods is useful and may lead to further classification of different PTMs at detection sites; however, the

73

accuracy of these methods requires improvements.

74

In this study, we knew that detecting PTMs from non-modified in vitro signaling could be solved by One-

75

Class Classification, which is widely used in machine learning. For example, Perera et al. [21] developed a

76

state-of-art One-Class Classification algorithm, Deep One-Class (DOC), with a convolutional neural

77

network (CNN). Recently, CNN has also been used in the analysis of nanopore data; for example,

78

DeepBinner [22] can detect barcode sequences more accurately than conventional base caller and mapping

79

reads approaches. Thus, using the DOC and CNN algorithms, we present a novel software to detect PTMs.

Preparation of data and Signal segmentation

87

Nanopore Multi-fast5/fast5 files containing the raw electric signal were base-called with Guppy

88

(v3.5.2; Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT], Oxford, UK), with the configuration file

89

“res_rna2_r941_min_flipflop_v001.cfg” downloaded from ONT rerio project [23]. Then, using

90

ont_fast5_apt [24], multi-fast5 reads were converted to single fast5. The Tombo (v1.5) [18], resquiggle

91

command was used to map reads to their respective references (Supplementary Table 2) with the inner

92

mappy/minimap2 aligner [25], and raw signals were further assigned to the mapped region of the reference

93

(Fig. 1a). The assigned raw signal for each genomic position was either up- or down-sampled to fit into

94

equal bin size of 60 (Supplementary Fig 1). The original signal length of each interval was recorded in

95

other fields for use in a latter process. The apache parquet [26] format was used to record the data.

96
97

Neural Network Architecture and initial training

98
99

From the in vitro (IVT) sequence of previous studies [27][14], the 5-mer signal was extracted for all 1024

100

possible 5-mer combinations for initial CNN training (Fig.1b). The CNN was constructed using Keras [28]

101

with Tensorflow [29] backend. A one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) was constructed to capture the specific

102

features of nanopore signals. The CNN architecture consisted of 64 layers including convolutional, batch

103

normalization, and drop out layers reinforced by Squeezenet [30] architecture. (Supplementary Fig.2).

104

nanoDoc took two channels of data as inputs: the first channel was the normalized current signal of 5-mer,

105

and the second channel was dwell time information formatted to the same bin size. Class classification of

106

the 1024 5-mer combinations was performed, using 1,000 signals for training and 200 signals for validation

107

(Fig. 1b). Four NVIDIA Tesla v100 graphics processing units were used, and training was conducted up to

108

500 epochs for 454 mins. The epoch of 340 yielded the best validation accuracy of 0.32 (Supplementary Fig

109

3a).

113

340) from the previous procedure was loaded into the CNN model. The top three layers were removed, and

114

the convolutional layers (g) were connected in a parallel fashion with an additional sub classification network

115

layer (hc), where the weight was shared between two CNNs (Fig. 1c). Each CNN was subject to transfer

116

learning, where the weight is fixed, except for the top six layers (Fig. 1c).

117

Then, DOC Classification was performed for each of the 1024 5-mer combinations. The 5-mer raw data was

118

utilized as input for the secondary CNN. Reference data was selected from 48 other 5-mers that had

119

nucleotide sequences similar to the target (Supplementary Fig. 4; the loss function and how to choose

120

neighbor sequences). The networks were trained for 2 epochs, as indicated in the DOC paper [21], to prevent

121

overfitting.

122
123

Inference and distance search

124

At each genomic locus, IVT sequences, twice as many as the Native sequences, were selected for detection,

125

to create an equal number of sequences in three raw data batches: IVT1, IVT2, and Native. A maximum of

126

20,000 signals were utilized for each data batch. For each 5-mer at the genomic locus, the DOC-trained

127

weight was loaded to the CNN, as well as three data batches, as the program progressed along the reference.

128

In the output layer, the 620 × 2 input dimension was reduced to 16 dimensions. Euclidian distances of the

129

output vectors, from IVT1 to IVT2 and IVT1 to Native, were compared using approximate nearest neighbors

130

(ANN)[31] with Faiss [32]. For each entry vector, five of the nearest vectors in the target dataset were

131

selected, and the mean distance was summarized as the distribution (Fig. 1d).

132
133
134

Adjustment and scoring
The Euclidian distance from the Native signal to IVT signal should be close or equal to that from IVT to

135

IVT, if there are no modifications in Native; however, the value increases with the existence of

136

modifications. Here, we defined cdf_INV as the cumulative distribution function of the distance from

137

IVT1 to IVT2 and cdf_Native as that from IVT1 to Native. Across the range of distances, cdf_Native

138

should be smaller than cdf_INV, under the existence of modified bases. For scoring, we calculated the area

139

between two accumulated functions over the percentile threshold.

TB = Total number of Data

142

x_thres = threshold x, where x is distance; 20 percentiles were calculated for each distribution of IVT 5-

143

mers, and the threshold was set to that value.

144

Score = (Σ cdf_INV(x) - cdf_Native(x))/TB, where x > x_thres.

145
146

To avoid noise aggregation in the low depth area, we took statistical measures of the scores for different

147

depths and used regression to adjust the variance in scoring.

148

The final score was normalized, from 0 to 1, as follows:

149

If score > 500, score = 1; otherwise, score = score/500.

Detection of known PTMs in rRNA and evaluation

158

Previously, nanoDoc has been applied to the native rRNA sequencing data of Escherichia coli and

159

Saccharomyces cerevisiae from a previous study[20]. The data was base-called and processed by Tombo, as

160

described in the previous section, using the appropriate reference sequence (Supplementary Table 2). In

161

addition, the list of known modification sites and KSStats values were downloaded from the GitHub

162

repository of nanoShape [20]. The score distributions across the genomic position of each rRNA are depicted

163

in Fig. 2a, where the red line represents the positions of known PTMs and the blue line shows the scores. To

164

evaluate the accuracy, we conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with nanoDoc, KSStats,

165

and mean current differences from Tombo. The results are shown in Fig. 2b, with the ROC curves for

166

nanoDoc (blue), KSStats (Stephenson et al; green), and Tombo mean current difference (orange). The area

167

under the curve (AUC) values were 0.96, 0.89, and 0.79, respectively (Supplementary Method 2). We

168

examined the nanoDoc score for each of the 23 modification types (Fig. 2c). All scores at the 147

169

modification sites were higher than the 75th percentile baseline, except for one m5u modification site. The

170

baseline was drawn from the collection of no modification sites. Note that the actual modification frequency

171

at each known modification site was unknown, and a low score might have represented the low modification

172

frequency at a given position. Wybutosine (yW) and Nm (2′-O-methylation) recorded the highest scores

173

(0.28±0.23 out of 53 sites and 0.38±0.25 out of 57, respectively) among the PTMs, which implies that heavily

174

modified bases and modifications on ribose are prone to detection. Although sample sizes for some other

175

modification sites were not enough for general evaluation, the overall result suggested that majority of base

176

modifications could be detected using this method.

177

For m6A modification, the score level was low (0.02 ± 0.0087) in the rRNA dataset. To investigate the m6A

178

detection more precisely, we analyzed the synthesized RNA data from a previous study [14]. We examined

179

81 types of 5-mers with m6A at the center, "BB (m6A) BB” (where B = G, C, or U), against the reference

180

"BB (A) BB” 5-mer. The AUC value for the detection of m6A modification, with this dataset, was 0.68

181

(Supplementary Fig. 6). Even though a small AUC value suggests that the method still needs to be improved

182

for accurate detection of m6A modification, the m6A modification score was mostly within the detection

183

range in the known m6A motif (DRACH motif). From 3-mer analysis, we also noticed that G(m6A)C,

184

C(m6A)G or G(m6A)U, U(m6A)G are prone to detection compering to other sequence combinations.

185

(Supplementary Fig. 6 b) We also examined how the modification frequency correlates with the score, using

186

the frequency data from a previous study [34] (Supplementary Fig. 7). The results showed no correlation (r2

187

= 0.15) between the score and the previously reported modification frequency. The possible reason for this

188

low correlation is that the magnitude of current disturbance is dependent on the background 5-mer sequence

189

composition, which makes it difficult to estimate the modification frequency from the nanoDoc score alone.

190

Thus, further classification and data accumulation are necessary to predict the modification frequency from

191

the score.

195

Clustering analysis of 5-mers with multiple modifications

196

Multiple PTMs were observed within the test data set(7 kinds of 5-mers, Supplementary Table 1). We

197

extracted the feature information from raw signals (Fig. 1e) using CNN trained by DOC. The features

198

information (16-dimensional output vector) was subjected to k-means clustering (Fig. 3). The figure in the

199

top row depicts the UMAP representation of the feature signals (Supplementary Method 3).

200

The reference IVT sequences were classified into different clusters in 4 out of 7 cases, and in the remaining

201

cases, the reference IVT 5-mer sequences were mainly attributed to the same clusters. Furthermore, 10 out

202

of 15 modified 5-mer sequences were assigned to a single cluster with 50% or more specificity. Considering

203

that the modification ratio is not 100% at each site, the result suggested that modified sequences were

204

generally separated into unique clusters by modification types. (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). In an

205

exceptional case, one of the modified sequences was assigned to reference IVT sequence cluster instead

206

of forming a unique cluster in the analysis of Am/m62A, and m4Cm/Cm, indicating the difficulty of

207

separating either of these modifications. With the “ACUAU” 5-mer, we tried to separate 3 modifications

208

and corresponding IVT sequences. (Fig. 3c). For the S. cerevisiae position 2345, three modifications of

209

Um/Y/Ym have previously been reported[35]. However, the signal from that position hardly clustered with

210

the Y modification cluster (position 2258), indicating that the Y modification at position 2345 in this data, if

211

it exists, is very small in this sample.

Analysis of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dataset
We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 DRS data of three different groups from Korea [27], Australia [36], and

218

England [37] . We utilized the same procedure as described above. Kim et al. had prepared the IVT

219

sequence, so we used the Korean IVT sequence as a reference to detect modifications. Ninety-one percent

220

of reads were mapped to the reference in the IVT dataset, and the 29%–64% native reads were mapped to

221

the reference (Supplementary Table 4). We observed a score draft with noise near the end of the IVT

222

transcript. To reduce the error, we applied a window function for denoising. (Supplementary Method 4).

223

The results of the overall scores are shown in Fig. 3a. All single nucleotide polymorphism sites in the

224

English and Australian samples, against the Korean reference, were detected with scores from 0.03 to 1

225

(Supplementary Table 4). The other major peaks indicated the existence of PTMs. Many of the

226

modifications have been previously reported in the 3' terminal region centering on the N protein region

227

(Supplementary Fig. 10) [38][27]. We also conducted WEBLOGO [39] analysis with the nucleotide

228

sequences of candidate sites and observed the weak trends of G/A/U enrichment at the target site and U/C

229

enrichment in the +2 position of candidate sites. A score threshold of 0.05 was used, which corresponded

230

to a false positive rate of 0.1 in the variation dataset, accounting for 117 candidates in total (Supplementary

231

Table 5). More than half of the candidate sites from the three groups overlapped; however, 24, 13, and 21

232

candidates in the Korean, English, and Australian group, respectively, remained as unique candidates (Fig.

233

4b). In addition, 12 candidates overlapped with Kim et al. (Fig. 4c) with a match allowing for a ± 2

234

difference in genomic position; however, we observed that the majority of sites did not match because of

235

using different software. We also compared the detected peaks to the short read RNA editing sites reported

236

previously [40] (Supplementary Fig. 9) and observed almost no overlap between these two datasets. The

237

RNA editing event, reported by a previous study that indicated very low allele frequency (median variant

238

allele frequency = 0.009) on the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, might have been dismissed by this method.

239

Further investigation, to identify each type of modification in the SARS-CoV-2 genome detected in this

240

study, is ongoing.

Supplemental methods

373

1. Scoring Schema

374

The extracted feature of IVT1 was compared to those of the IVT2 and Native signals, respectively, and the

375

closest Euclidian distance in the target data set was calculated for each entry using ANN. For the distance

376

calculation, the 16-dimensional vector output from the CNN was used (Supplemental Fig. 5a). Each distance

377

was summarized as a distribution, and with the existence of the modified base, the distance was larger in the

378

IVT1 vs. Native comparison (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The distance distribution was plotted as a cumulative

379

distribution function. The blue, orange, and green line shows the distance function from the IVT1 vs. IVT2,

380

IVT1 vs. Native, and Native vs. IVT1 (reverse direction) comparison, respectively. The surrounding area

381

represents the disturbed signal feature from the IVT reference sequence. The score is calculated from this

382

area and normalized by sample size (Supplementary Fig. 5c).

383
384

2. ROC analysis

385

For all genomic positions, each position was labeled as either True or False. The known modification

386

position in the rRNA dataset and the ±1 positions were assigned as True and False elsewhere. To avoid an

387

unequal degree of bias for ROC analysis, the regions with a 50nt margin, from the first modification site to

388

the last modification site, were used.

389
390

3. 5-mer modification analysis

391

The 5-mer signals were extracted from the Native and corresponding reference IVT sequences. Each signal

392

was subjected to a CNN, and the output signals were further analyzed by k-means clustering. Faiss [32] was

393

used for k-means clustering, with a cluster size of 4 to 6 and 500 iterations. UMAP was used for visualization

394

purposes, which reduced the dimensions from 16 to 2.

395
396

4. Window function

397

The window function was applied for denoising.

398

For each point, the following functions were applied:

399
400

Let n be the arbitral genomic position and Vn be a score at position n,

401

Vbaseline = Max ((Vn-4, Vn-5)/2, (Vn+4, Vn+5)/2) is to be used as the base line

402

Vfilter = Vn – Vbaseline (where, n-3<= x <=n+3)
