Abstract

40

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19

41

pandemic. Severe complications are observed only in a small proportion of infected

42

patients but the cellular mechanisms underlying this progression are still unknown.

43

Comprehensive flow cytometry of whole blood samples from 54 COVID-19 patients

44

revealed a dramatic increase in the number of immature neutrophils. This increase

45

strongly correlated with disease severity and was associated with elevated IL-6 and

46

IP-10 levels, two key players in the cytokine storm. The most pronounced decrease

47

in cell counts was observed for CD8 T-cells and VD2 γδ T-cells, which both exhibited

48

increased differentiation and activation. ROC analysis revealed that the count ratio of

49

immature neutrophils to CD8 or VD2 T-cells predicts pneumonia onset (0.9071) as

50

well as hypoxia onset (0.8908) with high sensitivity and specificity. It would thus be a

51

useful prognostic marker for preventive patient management and improved

52

healthcare resource management.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in

Results

87

Circulating myeloid populations are reduced in COVID-19 patients

88

A total of 54 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited

89

at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), Singapore from end March to

90

mid-May 2020 (Supplementary Table 1). Blood was collected from 54 patients upon

91

enrollment at a median 7 days post-illness onset (pio), from 28 patients who had

92

recovered from COVID-19 disease (median 30 days pio, Supplementary Table 1)

93

and 19 healthy donors (Supplementary Table 2). Immunophenotyping of whole blood

94

samples was carried out with three distinct flow cytometry panels to analyse myeloid,

95

granulocyte and lymphoid subsets. (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table 3). Each panel

96

was supplemented with counting beads to allow accurate assessment of cell counts.

97

19 of the 54 acute patients had paired plasma samples that permitted quantification

98

of immune mediators by Luminex multiplex microbead-based immunoassay. The

99

cohort was strongly biased towards males of which two patients had fatal outcomes

100

(3.7%).

101

The FACS analysis revealed a declined cell count for eosinophils, basophils,

102

total T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) CD56 Bright, and plasmacitoid

103

DCs (pDCs) in patients with acute COVID-19 infection (Figure 1B, Supplementary

104

Figure 1A). No significant changes were observed for B-cells, total monocytes, and

105

total NK cells (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1A). Unbiased analysis by Uniform

106

Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and graph-based clustering however

identified with CD169+ monocytes and CD11bhigh neutrophils, two additional clusters

108

with high variation in acute patients (Figure 1C). Further analysis showed that the

109

monocytes presented with an increased expression of CD169 (strong type I

110

interferon signature marker

14

), increased expression of CD11b and HLA-DR, as

15,16

(Figure 1D, Supplementary

113

Similar to the monocytes, neutrophils showed a significant upregulation of

114

CD11b, CD66b, Siglec 8, CD38 and HLA-DR, suggesting that they were activated in

115

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure 1C).

116

Interestingly, despite this activation phenotype, an increase in the overall number of

117

circulating neutrophils during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection based on conventional

118

phenotypic markers (CD66b and CD16) was observed only in a small subset of our

119

cohort (Figure 1F). However, in-depth analysis of neutrophil subsets allows

120

discrimination between immature (CD16low/highCD10-) and mature (CD10+) subsets

121

(Figure 1G)17-19. Overall, a significant increase of immature neutrophil numbers was

122

observed in acute patients as compared to healthy donors or recovered patients,

123

while the number of mature neutrophils decreased (Figure 1H).

124
125

CD8 and γδ T-cell populations are the most affected lymphocyte subsets

126

To better characterise COVID-19-induced lymphopenia, levels of CD8, CD4, γδ (i.e.

127

VD1

128

CD3+VA7.2+CD161+) were assessed during acute infection. Results showed a

129

decrease in circulating MAIT, CD8+ and VD2 T-cells (Figure 2A). However,

130

circulating VD1 T-cells did not vary in numbers, and CD4+ T-cells did not show a

131

significant decrease during acute infection (Figure 2A). Interestingly, levels of

132

regulatory T-cells (Treg) and CD4+CD161+ T-cells increased in recovered patients as

136

suggests that phenotypic modulation in the CD8+ cluster was the most pronounced

137

during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2B). In order to validate this observation,

138

CD45RA and CD27 markers were used to analyse the frequency of naïve

139

(CD45RA+CD27+), central memory (CM, CD45RA-CD27+), effector memory (EM,

140

CD45RA-CD27-) and terminal effector (TEMRA, CD45RA+CD27-) amongst the T-cell

141

populations (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 2A). In agreement with the UMAP

142

analysis, CD8+ T-cells showed a change in differentiation profile from naïve in favour

143

of EM and TEMRA (Figure 2C). Noticeably, the frequency of naïve CD4+ T-cells

144

decreased but was not reflected in a significant increase of a specific differentiated

145

population (Figure 2C).

146

In addition, UMAP analysis also suggested changes in VD1 and VD2

147

populations that were not reflected in terms of differentiation (Figure 2B-C).

148

Therefore, we investigated the expression of general activation marker CD38 (Figure

149

2D). In this context, we observed that all differentiation stages of CD8+ T-cells, VD1

150

and VD2, had higher expression of CD38 except VD2 TEMRA (Figure 2E). On the

151

other hand, CD4+ T-cells only showed activation of the TEMRA compartment (Figure

152

2E). Together, our data suggest that while circulating cell counts were generally

153

decreased for T-cells, SARS-CoV-2 differentially impacts the different T-cell subsets

154

in terms cell counts, differentiation and expression of CD38.

155
156

Granularity of clinical severity is reflected by immune cell counts

157

In order to associate the data with the clinical severity we separated the patients into

158

four different groups: no pneumonia, pneumonia only, pneumonia and hypoxia, and

159

pneumonia and hypoxia requiring ICU admission (Figure 3A)

166

Cell counts in various myeloid subsets showed a similar decreasing profile

167

with severity for pDCs, DCs, classical and intermediate monocytes (Figure 3C). In

168

contrast to cell counts, myeloid activation markers showed differential trends with

169

severity (Figure 3D). CD86 expression on DCs, HLA-DR and CD33 expression on

170

monocytes followed a gradual decrease with increasing severity (Figure 3D).

171

Expression of CD169 on monocytes was decreased in ICU patients, while CD86

172

expression on pDCs was consistent across severity groups (Figure 3D). Together,

173

these results suggest that the remaining circulating monocytes and DCs in severe

174

cases have a dysregulated phenotype.

175

While total circulating neutrophils showed no significant change with disease

176

severity, neutrophilia was only observed in some patients with severe clinical

177

complications (Figure 3E). Particularly, there was a change in the composition of

178

neutrophil subsets in accordance to disease severity, where an increase in the

179

immature neutrophil cell count and frequency was accompanied with a decrease of

180

mature neutrophils (Figure 3E). These results suggest that immature neutrophils

181

could reflect disease severity much more accurately than total neutrophil counts.

. However, these studies observed increased neutrophils in

186

respiratory disease

187

severe cases which was not consistent with our observations and in another study 25

188

(Figure 1F and 3E). To validate that the identified populations would be good

189

markers of disease severity, a correlation analysis with analyte levels in available

190

paired plasma samples was performed (Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure 3).

191

Interestingly, strong correlation scores were observed between analytes and

192

immature neutrophil counts (Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure 3A), rather than with

193

total neutrophil counts (Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure 3B). The strongest

194

correlations were observed between immature neutrophil counts and IL-6

195

(rho=0.6747, p=0.0015), and IP-10 (rho=0.7596, p=0.0002) (Figure 4B).

196

In addition, strong correlations were also observed between mature

197

neutrophils, monocytes and intermediate monocytes, as well as CD8 and VD2 T-cell

198

counts (Supplementary Figure 3C). These results suggest that immature neutrophils

199

counts can potentially be used as sensitive and reliable indicators of disease

200

severity.

201
202

Immature neutrophil to VD2 T-cell ratio as an improved prognostic marker

203

We next assessed if an immature neutrophil-to-CD8 T-cells ratio (iN8R) or VD2 T-

204

cell counts ratio (iNVD2R) could be a better prognostic marker of disease severity as

205

compared to the current proposed NLR and N8R

206

and without pneumonia, iNVD2R performed better than N8R or iN8R with an area

209

0.5754-0.8562) respectively (Figure 5A). In addition, to differentiate patients with and

211

iNVD2R as compared to 0.8931 (95% CI: 0.8044-0.9817) for iN8R and 0.7958 (95%

212

CI: 0.6781-0.9136) for N8R. These results indicate that iNVD2R and iN8R could be

213

good markers for severe respiratory disease.

214

To assess if this analysis could have predictive prognostic value in

215

hospitalisation settings to improve patient management, we repeated the analysis

216

with the samples that were acquired before 7 days pio (24 patients, median pio = 3

217

days). AUROC for iNVD2R showed strong prognostic value for pneumonia onset

218

(0.9071) as well as for onset of hypoxia (0.8908) (Figure 5B, Table 1). Our data

219

show that immature neutrophil counts are better in predicting disease severity as

220

compared to total neutrophil counts. Importantly, they can be used in a ratio with

221

CD8 or VD2 lymphocyte counts to improve the current N8R predictive ratio.

Discussion

223

In this study, immunophenotyping of peripheral blood from COVID-19 patients

224

revealed a significant shift in the ratio between mature and immature neutrophils

225

associating with severity. The increased numbers of immature neutrophils and the

226

disappearance of mature neutrophils likely reflect gradual and sustained mobilisation

227

of these cells into the lungs in response to an ongoing inflammation, leading to

228

premature release of immature neutrophils from the bone marrow

229

hypothesis, a recent study investigated several myeloid populations between

230

circulating PBMCs and the lung lavage of COVID-19 patients showed that

231

granulocytes represent up to 80% of total CD45+ lung infiltrates

232

autopsies of COVID-19 fatalities showed typical lesions associated with toxic

233

neutrophil effects

234

abnormalities of the circulating neutrophils were reported in COVID-19 patients

235

These cells present typical hallmarks of immature neutrophils and their precursors

236

such as band shaped nuclei and a lower expression of CD10 and CD16

237

Consistent with our data, a recent study on a small number of patients reported that

238

the presence of "low density inflammatory neutrophils” was strongly associated with

239

disease severity and IL-6 levels

249

a major orchestrator of sustained neutrophils mobilisation

250

could significantly affect the neutrophils compartment in COVID-19 patients.

251

Consistent with this hypothesis, CD4 T-cells in COVID-19 patients are skewed

252

towards a Th17 phenotype

253

in recovered patients. These CD4+CD161+ T-cells are known to be either IL-17

254

producer cells or their precursors

255

of these cells from the lung or secondary lymphoid organs after infection and support

256

the possibility of IL-17 in mediating neutrophil damage to the lungs. Together, this

would support proposed anti-IL-17 or JAK2 inhibitor therapies for severe COVID-19

decrease in T-cells was observed, especially in subsets that possess cytolytic

During aging, VD2 T-cell counts in the periphery have been shown to

277

decrease with age. Elderly individuals generally have systemic chronic low-grade

inflammation, which we previously termed “inflamm-aging”, with higher basal levels

279

of molecules such as CRP, TNF-a and IL-6

280

VD2 T-cell counts and cytokines between COVID-19 severity and aging could

281

explain why elderly individuals are more susceptible to severe disease, since they

282

have a higher basal level of inflammation and lower level of VD2 T-cells as

through a simple 5 colours flow cytometry panel (CD3; VD2; CD66b/CD15; CD10;

287

patient progression to pneumonia or hypoxia. Moreover, CD8 could also be included

288

in the flow cytometry panel as a fallback option since VD2 counts could be

decreased by medication, such as Azathioprine, as well as underlying conditions,

such as inflammatory bowel disease, aging or psoriasis, which could be risk factors

Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a decrease in immune cells in peripheral blood. (a) Schematic
representation of flow cytometry workflow. (b) Heatmap representation of row z-score of mean absolute cell counts
across the groups. Individual plots are shown in Supplementary Figure 1A. (c) UMAP clustering of CD45+ immune
cells. (d) Heatmap representation of row z-score of monocyte activation markers mean geometric MFI (gMFI) across
the groups. (e) Heatmap representation of row z-score of neutrophil activation markers mean geometric MFI (gMFI)
across the groups. (f) Absolute neutrophil counts. (g) Representative plot of mature and immature neutrophil gating
strategy in healthy control or acute COVID-19 patient. (h) Mature (CD10+) and Immature (CD10-) Neutrophil Abs
counts. Absolute counts were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis using Dunn correction for multiple comparison, gMFI was
analysed by Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA using Dunnett T3 correction for multiple comparison. For heatmaps,
stars shown in acute column represent healthy vs acute comparison. Stars shown in recovered column represent acute

Figure 5: Immature neutrophil to VD2 T-cell ratio is an early prognosis marker for pneumonia and hypoxia
symptoms. (a) ROC curve analysis comparison was performed for pneumonia and hypoxia symptoms between
absolute counts of total neutrophils to CD8 T-cell ratio, total neutrophils to VD2 T-cell, immature neutrophils to CD8 Tcell ratio, and immature neutrophils to VD2 T-cell ratio. (b) Similar analysis was performed on a subset of 24 early
samples taken up to 7 days pio with a median of 3 days pio. ROC curve was analysed using Wilson/Brown method.
95% confidence interval and standard error for panel B are given in Table 1.
