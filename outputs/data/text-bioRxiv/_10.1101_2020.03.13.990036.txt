Abstract

20

The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 caused by the severe acute respiratory

21

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly transmitted. The potential

22

extra-respiratory transmission routes remain uncertain. Five rhesus macaques were

23

inoculated with 1×106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 via conjunctival (CJ), intratracheal

24

(IT), and intragastric (IG) routes, respectively. Remarkably, the CJ

25

inoculated-macaques developed mild interstitial pneumonia and viral load was

26

detectable in the conjunctival swabs at 1 days post-inoculation (dpi). Only via IT

27

inoculation, viral load was detected in the anal swab at 1-7 dpi and macaque showed

28

weight loss. However, viral load was undetectable after IG inoculation. Comparatively,

29

viral load was higher in the nasolacrimal system but lesions of lung were relatively

30

mild and local via CJ inoculation compared with that via IT inoculation,

31

demonstrating distinct characteristics of virus dispersion. Both the two routes affected

32

the alimentary tract. Therefore the clinicians need to protect eye while working with

33

patients.

Introduction

36

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious and transmitted mainly

37

through human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets when direct or close

38

contact with the patients with SARS-CoV-2. The other potential transmission routes

39

remain to be further researched. In some clinical cases, samples of tears and

40

conjunctival secretions from both SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV-2 patients with

conjunctivitis1 displayed detectable viral RNA. A previous study reported the case of a

42

clinician who was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with patients under all

safeguards except eye protection 3. By contrast, no SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by

Results

50

Five rhesus macaques between the ages of 3 and 5 years were inoculated with 1×106

51

TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 via three routes by ocular conjunctival inoculation (CJ-1 and

52

CJ-2), intragastrical inoculation (IG-1 and IG-2), and intratracheal inoculation (IT-1)

53

regarded as a comparison to compare the distributions and pathogenesis of viruses

54

after enter the host via different routes (Figure 1).

55
56

We daily observed the macaques for clinical signs. There was no significant change in

57

the body weight (Figure 2A) in the CJ and IG inoculated macaques and the

58

temperature (Figure 2B) in all the inoculated macaques, while the weight loss was

59

obvious in the IT inoculated macaques and dropped about 125 g at 5 dpi. Routine

60

specimens, including nasal and throat swabs, were collected on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7-day

61

post-inoculation (dpi). Additionally, to explore the potentially excretory routes of

62

SARS-CoV-2 in the host, the conjunctival and anal swabs were also gathered.

63

Specifically, CJ and IT inoculated animals were able to detect a continued viral load

64

in their nasal and throat swabs from 1 to 7 dpi. In contrast, the virus was not detected

65

in any swabs from the IG inoculated macaques. Notably, only via the CJ route, viral

66

load can be tested in conjunctival swabs (average, approximately 4.33 log10 RNA

67

copies/mL) on 1 dpi and then became undetectable implying that the

68

inoculated-SARS-CoV-2 may be transferred from the initial entry-conjunctiva to

69

respiratory tract and other tissues. Meanwhile, only via the IT route, viral load can be

70

ongoing examined in the anal swabs on 1-7 dpi and reached the peak about 6.76 log10

71

RNA copies/mL on 5 dpi, revealing distinct excretory pathways of host after

72

inoculation via different routes (Figure 2C).

73
74

To determine the distribution of virus and histological lesions, CJ-1, IT-1, and IG-1

75

were euthanized and necropsied on 7 dpi. For CJ-1, viral load was primarily

76

distributed in the nasolacrimal system and ocular, including the lacrimal gland (3.93

77

log10 RNA copies/mL), optic nerve (1.03 log10 RNA copies/mL), and conjunctiva

78

(1.01 log10 RNA copies/mL); in the nose, including the nasal mucosa (6.25 log10 RNA

79

copies/mL), nasal turbinate (6.63 log10 RNA copies/mL), and nostril (1.03 log10 RNA

80

copies/mL); in the pharynx including epiglottis (4.57 log10 RNA copies/mL), soft

81

palate (5.60 log10 RNA copies/mL); in the oral cavity including check pouch (1.03

82

log10 RNA copies/mL) and parotid gland (1.04 log10 RNA copies/mL); as well as in

83

other tissues including lower left lobe of lung (4.6 log10 RNA copies/mL), tonsil (4.51

84

log10 RNA copies/mL), inguinal (1.01 log10 RNA copies/mL) and pararectal (6.25

log10 RNA copies/mL) lymph node, stomach (4.61 log10 RNA copies/mL), duodenum

86

(4.66 log10 RNA copies/mL), ileum (1.08 log10 RNA copies/mL) and caecum (1.06

87

log10 RNA copies/mL) (Figure 1d). By contrast, for IT-1, the distribution of virus

88

might be somewhat different owing to viral replication was highly in different lobes

89

of the lung (104.22 to 107.81 copies/mL), and viral load was also widely detected in the

90

nasal septum (4.69 log10 RNA copies/mL), tracheas (6.61 log10 RNA copies/mL),

91

mandibular lymph node (4.26 log10 RNA copies/mL), tonsil (5.17 log10 RNA

92

copies/mL), pulmonary lymph node (3.39 log10 RNA copies/mL), and some segments

93

of the alimentary tract including duodenum (1.97 log10 RNA copies/mL), ileum (4.93

94

log10 RNA copies/mL), colon (1.11 log10 RNA copies/mL), and caecum (4.25 log10

95

RNA copies/mL) (Figure 2D). The distinct distributions of viruses by different

96

inoculation routes were consistent with the anatomical structure, suggesting that the

97

dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 into the host associated with the infection route.

98

Furthermore, viruses were detectable in different segments of the alimentary canal

99

and some lymphatic tissues via both inoculation routes revealing that they may play

100

important roles in the spread of the virus within the host5. There were no significant

101

histopathological changes in IG-1. Furthermore, the specific IgG antibody against

102

SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in the CJ-2 at 14 and 21 dpi compared to before

103

infection proofing that the animal was infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2E).

104
105

Meanwhile, comparison with prior to infection (day 0), the chest radiographs from

106

CJ-1 revealed obscure lung markings and opaque glass sign in the bilateral upper

107

lobes and the right lower lobe of the lung on 7 dpi. By comparison, IT-1 developed

108

obviously increased radiographic changes on 7 dpi, exhibiting vessel convergence

109

sign, obscure lung markings, marked ground-glass opacities, obscures costophrenic

110

angle in the bilateral lobes of the lung, and patchy lesions in the right lower lobe of

111

the lung (Figure 3A). Consistent with the radiographic alteration, microscopically,

112

local lesions in the lungs from the CJ-1 displayed mild interstitial pneumonia

113

characterized by widened alveolar interstitium, infiltration of inflammatory cells

114

primarily including lymphocytes and monocytes, a small amount of exudation in the

115

alveolar cavities (Figure 3B). Virus antigen was further confirmed by the

116

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody via immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain. In the

117

damaged lobe of lungs, SARS-CoV-2 was predominantly observed in the alveolar

118

epithelium and exfoliated-degenerative cellular debris in the alveolar cavities (Figure

119

3B) both in CJ-1 and IT-1. Notably, the results of IHC were highly in accordance with

120

the data of viral load detection on 7 dpi both in the CJ-1 and IT-1. Specifically, viral

121

antigens were scattered in several cells in the nasolacrimal system via conjunctival

122

inoculation, while they were more prominent in the trachea via intratracheal

123

inoculation (Figure 4). Moreover, viral antigen was obviously observed in the lamina

124

propria of alimentary tract suggesting that the virus may spread from the initial entry

125

to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Supplementary Figure 1), and they were relatively

126

slight detected in the kidney, myocardium, and liver in IT-1 but undetectable in CJ-1.

127

(Supplementary Figure 2). Briefly, animal inoculated via conjunctival route gave

128

evidence of relatively mild and local interstitial pneumonia compared to the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990036; this version posted March 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

129

intratracheal inoculated-macaque which demonstrated moderate, diffuse lesions in the

130

lung accompanied with more infiltration of inflammatory cells and accumulation of

131

exudation in the alveolar cavities.

132
133

These data demonstrated that macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via the

134

conjunctival route rather than the intragastric route. Compared to the intratracheal

135

route, viral load was comparatively high in the nasolacrimal system and lesions in the

136

lung were relatively mild and local via the conjunctival route. Similarly, both the two

137

routes can affect the alimentary canal.

138
139

Discussion

140

We inoculated rhesus monkeys via a single route via conjunctiva, intra-stomach, or

141

intra-trachea, to avoid multiple routes of co-inoculation for confirming the exact

142

pathway of inoculation. These results suggest that conjunctiva is a potential portal for

143

viral transmission. In our results, viral load was detectable in several nasolacrimal

144

system associated-tissues, especially in the conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, nasal cavity

145

and throat, which drew the outline of the anatomical bridge between ocular and

146

respiratory tissues. Particularly, the lacrimal duct functions as a conduit to collect and

147

transport tear fluid from the ocular surface to the nasal-inferior meatus, being

148

convenient for the drainage of virus from ocular to respiratory tract tissues. Actually,

149

the previous report had demonstrated that although virus-containing fluid can be taken

150

up through the conjunctiva, sclera, or cornea, the majority of liquid including tear and

151

secretions is drained into the nasopharyngeal space or swallowed; the lacrimal duct

152

epithelia are also possible to contribute to the absorption of tear fluid. Our results

153

were highly consistent with the anatomical features that viruses enter the host via the

154

conjunctival route. On the other hand, previous research demonstrated that

155

SARS-CoV was undetectable in cynomolgus monkeys after intragastric inoculation

156

which consistent with our result. At present, still, no evidence could prove that

157

SARS-CoV-2 can transmission via fecal-oral route5, although viral RNA of

158

SARS-CoV-2 was prolonged detectable in fecal samples from patients6 and in anal

159

swabs from the infected macaques.

160
161

Respiratory viruses have the capability to stimulate ocular complications in infected

162

patients, which then leads to respiratory infection 7. The fact that exposed mucous

163

membranes and unprotected eyes increased the risk of SARS-CoV1 or SARS-CoV-22

164

transmission suggests that healthcare professionals need to increase the awareness of

165

eye protection in close contact with the patients or in crowded places.

Five male rhesus macaques (Macaca Mulatta) between the ages of 3 and 5 years were

199

used in this research. All were negative for tuberculosis and simian immunodeficiency

200

virus. They were inoculated with 1×106 50% tissue-culture infectious doses (TCID50)

201

of SARS-CoV-2 via three routes. Two male rhesus macaques were inoculated with

and temperature were tested as shown).On 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi, the conjunctival, nasal,

290

throat and anal swabs were collected. CJ-1, IT-1, and IG-1 were euthanized and

291

necropsied on 7 dpi. Tissues were collected to analysis the virus distributions. All sera

292

were collected on 0, 7, 14 and 21 dpi for serologic detection to exam the

293

SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies.

The darker the blue color, the higher the viral load. The specific IgG antibody against

306

SARS-CoV-2 in the sera of the inoculated-macaques were tested by ELISA on 0, 7,

307

14, and 21 dpi (E). According to unpaired Welch’s t-test, the specific IgG antibody in

308

the sera of conjunctival inoculated macaque exhibited a significant increase compared

309

with prior to inoculation (**p=0.0027) and 21 dpi (**p=0.0039). CJ-1 and CJ-2 were

310

the two macaques that inoculated via conjunctival route, IT-1 was the macaque that

311

inoculated via intratracheal route. IG-1 and IG-2 were the two macaques that

The anterior-posterior and right lateral chest radiographs (A) from rhesus macaque

319

imaged prior to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation (day 0) and 7 dpi. Areas of interstitial

320

infiltration, indicative of pneumonia, are highlighted (red circle); obscures

321

costophrenic angle (red arrows); patchy lesions (blue circle). Positional indicators are

322

included (R=right). The histopathological and immunohistochemical observations in

323

the lungs (B). Both the two macaques exhibited interstitial pneumonia with thickened

324

alveolar septa, filtration of inflammatory cells mainly including lymphocytes and

325

macrophages, some amounts of exudation (red arrows) in the alveolar cavities on 7dpi.

326

Conjunctival route caused relatively mild pneumonia. The sequential sections were

327

stained by HE and IHC, respectively. The viral antigens were observed primarily in

328

the alveolar epithelia (black arrows) and the detached-degenerative cellular debris

329

(green arrows). The H&E stained-sections under 400 magnification were the

330

fractionated gain (black frame) of these sections under 100 magnification. The IHC

331

section showed the same field with the black frame section under 400 magnification.
