Abstract
Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a worldwide epidemic,
causing more than 80 million infections and more than 1.7 million deaths. The
pandemic has led to the closure of enterprises and schools in many countries, resulting
in serious disruption of the global economy and social activities. Remdesivir is
currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19, but the WHO
declared that Remdesivir is almost ineffective against COVID-19. The research and
development of vaccines has made great progress, but it will take at least several
months for safe and effective vaccines to be widely used clinically. Clinical studies
revealed that some Traditional Chinese Medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Capsule
and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water, exhibited excellent therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
However, until now, there is still no cure for COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to find medicines that can effectively fight against the SARS-CoV-2. In this
study, JIE BEN No. 10 (JB10), a fermentation broth produced by Yi traditional
medicine fermentation technology, was explored for its anti-coronavirus activity. The
in vitro data showed that JB10 could significantly suppresses the replication of the
SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 769.1 times dilution and a selection index of 42.68.
Further studies indicated that JB10 had significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
activities. The analysis of active components suggested that JB10 contained a large
amount of superoxide dismutase (SOD), flavones, polyphenols, crude polysaccharide,
etc. which may explain the anti-coronavirus activity, anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant effects. Our study provides a new potentially therapeutic strategy for
COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infection caused by
SARS-CoV-2. The main symptoms of patients are fever, fatigue, tussiculation,
rhinobyon, runny nose, etc. About half of the patients will have difficulty breathing
within a week, and severe cases will rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress
syndrome, septic shock, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.

1

The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β genus of coronaviruses. It has an envelope and the
particles are round or oval, often pleomorphic, with a diameter of 60-140nm.

2

At

present, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 80 million infections and more than
1.7 million deaths in the worldwide according to Johns Hopkins University data. The
epidemic has caused many countries to close enterprises and schools, causing severe
damage to the global economy. At present, Remdesivir has been approved by the FDA
for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, 3 but the WHO claims that Redesivir is
almost ineffective against COVID-19.

4

The research and development of vaccines

has made great progress, but safe and effective vaccines are widely used in clinical
practice, and it will take at least several months.
At present, the COVID-19 epidemic has been well controlled in China. In this
process, traditional Chinese medicine has made great contributions. For example,
Lianhua Qingwen granules and Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills can significantly
improve the symptoms of fever, cough, sputum and breathing difficulties caused by
the novel coronavirus.

5

However, there is still no specific medicine to treat the

COVID-19. Therefore, the discovery of medicines that can significantly inhibit the
replication of the novel coronavirus is vital to the prevention and control of the
COVID-19 epidemic.
Yi traditional medicine is an important part of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM) and has made great contributions to the development of Chinese civilization.
Among them, the world-famous Yunnan Baiyao is derived from the ancient Yi
prescription.

JB10, a fermentation broth, is fermented from Phyllanthus emblica,

Rosa roxburghii Tratt., Lemon, Gastrodia elata Bl. and honey according to Yi
traditional medical theory.

In this work, in the process of screening

anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate drugs, we found that JB10 can significantly inhibit the
replication of the novel coronavirus. Further research shows that JB10 has excellent
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This research will provide new methods for
anti-novel coronavirus treatment.

Results
In vitro antiviral activity against SARS- CoV-2 replication
Standard assays were carried out to measure the cytotoxicity effects of JB10. The
cytotoxicity of JB10 in Vero E6 cells was determined by the CCK8 assay. As can be
seen from Figure 1, JB10 did not show significant toxicity on Vero E6 cells at
concentrations above 100 times diluted concentration. The CC50 was 18.02 times
diluted concentration. Thus, the least dilution time for JB10 was set as 100 times. The
Vero E6 cells were infected according to Wang et al. 8 with some modofications with
SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in the presence of varying
concentrations of the candidate drug (diluted to 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200
times). The viral replication was evaluated by quantification of viral copy numbers in
the cell supernatant by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in
Figure 1, JB10 exhibited potent antiviral against the SARS-CoV-2 (EC50=769.1 times
dilution). The selective index is 42.68. These results indicated that JB10 may be
developed as a candidate for COVID-19 treatment. Further in vivo evaluation of this
candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended.

Figure 1. The antiviral activities of JB10 against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The Vero
E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.05 in the presence of
different doses of No.10 fermentation liquor for 24 h. The viral yield in the cell
supernatant was then quantified by qRT-PCR. Cytotoxicity of No.10 fermentation
liquor to Vero E6 cells was measured by CCK-8 assays. The experiments were
repeated at least 3 times.

Antioxidant activities
Oxidative stress, characterized by excess levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
plays a vital role in the progression of COVID‐19.9 Many evidences support
therapeutic counterbalancing of ROS by antioxidants can prevent COVID-19 from
becoming severe.

10,11

In order to evaluate the antioxidant activities of JB10, DPPH

free radical and hydroxyl radical scavenging assay were performed. As shown in
Figure 2A, JB10 exhibited very strong and significant dose-dependent DPPH radical
scavenging activities. When JB10 was diluted to 800, 1600, 6400, and 12800 times,
the DPPH free radicals were removed 82.99%, 65.23%, 53.09% and 25.84%,
respectively. As can be seen from Figure 2B, JB10 also displayed strong hydroxyl
radical scavenging activities. After diluted to 20, 30, 40, and 50 times, the hydroxyl
radicals were removed 67.42%, 59.92%, 53.91% and 51.64%, respectively.

B. The JB10 was diluted for 20, 30, 40, and 50 times.

Anti-inflammatory activity
Pulmonary hyper-inflammation and potentially life-threatening “cytokine storms” are
the characteristics of COVID-19, which cause disease severity and death in infected
patients.

12

According to the publication, controlling the local and systemic

inflammatory response in COVID-19 may be as important as anti-viral therapies.
The anti-inflammatory activity was determined according to Liu

with some

modifications. Before starting the experiment of anti-inflammatory activity, the
cytotoxicity of JB10 to RAW 264.7 cell line was tested for 24 h by MTT assay. As
shown in Figure 3A, there was no significant toxicity up to diluted 160 times on RAW
264.7 cells.
The anti-inflammatory activity of JB10 was evaluated in LPS-induced

RAW264.7

cells under the following concentrations (diluted to 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, and
16000 times). As can be seen from Figure 3B, JB10 could effectively suppress the
NO production. When the JB10 was diluted to 2000 times, the inhibition rate of NO
rate was still close to 80%. These results suggested that JB10 has potent activity
against inflammation.

Analysis of active components
Since JB10 has potent antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2, antioxidant activities
and anti-inflammatory activity, we analyzed its components to provide evidences for
JB10. As can be seen from Table 1, JB10 contains a lot of active components
including

Vitamin

C,

SOD,

flavones,

polyphenols,

crude

polysaccharide,

proanthocyanidins, saponins and coumarin etc. These substances have antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory, immune and antiviral effects.

Discussion
TCM has a nearly 3000 years of history and is widely practiced in China. Several
epidemics have occurred in the history of China. But, fortunately, no large numbers of

casualties occurred, in part due to the use of TCM. 15 Yi traditional medicine is a vital
part of TCM and has its unique medical theory and practical experience.

16

JB10 is a

fermentation broth from Phyllanthus emblica, Rosa roxburghii Tratt, Lemon,
Gastrodia elata Bl. and honey according to Yi traditional medical theory. In this work,
the antiviral activity against the SARS CoV-2 was investigated. We observed
significant, potent, and dose-dependent antiviral activity of JB10. As expected from
the fact that Yi traditional medicine was widely used for long time, the treatment did
not exert cytotoxicity. Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the
progression of COVID‐19. We also explored the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
activities of JB10. The results showed that JB10 has potent anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant activities.
JB10 contains a lot of Vitamin C, SOD, flavones, polyphenols, crude
polysaccharide, proanthocyanidins, saponins and coumarin etc. Vitamin C has
multiple pharmacological characteristics, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory
and immunomodulatory effects, which make it a potential therapeutic option in
management of COVID-19.

17

SOD, one of the powerful antioxidants, plays a major

role in fighting against free radical damage and inflammation, and SOD might exert
an anti-aging effect. While, aging immunity may exacerbate COVID-19.

18

So, SOD

may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19. A previous study showed that
flavonoids could inhibit key proteins in the coronavirus infection cycle and
SARS-CoV proteases PLpro and 3CLpro.
NTPase/helicase and N protein of SARS-CoV.

19
20

Flavonoids can also inhibit

JB10 contains high levels of total

flavone, which might be involved in the inhibitory effects of the virus replication as
we observed. Polyphenols, a major class of bioactive compounds in nature, are known
for their antiviral activity and pleiotropic effects. In a previous report, polyphenols
was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 fusion/entry, disrupt SARS-CoV-2 replication and
suppress the host inflammatory response. 21 From Table 1, the content of polyphenols
in JB10 is abundant. This may also contribute to the antiviral activity of JB10.
Polysaccharides have broad applications in anti-virus, especially in anti-coronavirus
due to the good safety, immune regulation and antiviral activity.

22

Song et al. found

that polysaccharides exhibited potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. A
further study suggested that polysaccharides could bind to the S glycoprotein to
prevent SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry.

23

Zhu et al. used main protease (Mpro) of

SARS-Cov-2 to screen plant flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins. The results showed
that proanthocyanidins could inhibit the Mpro activity of SARS-Cov-2.

24

The high

levels of proanthocyanidins in the JB10 might also contribute to the inhibitory effects
of SARS-Cov-2. Recent modeling studies have shown that the saponin derivative has
a high binding affinity to the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2

. Molecular

25

docking analysis also showed that the natural coumarin analog toddacoumaquinone
had a significant inhibitory ability on the main protease of COVID-19 (compared to
the complex α-ketoamide (PDBID: 5N5O)), with a binding energy of -7.8kcal/ mol.
The synthesized coumarin analog (1m) also showed considerable inhibitory ability,
and the binding energy to the main protease of COVID-19 (containing α-ketoamide)
was -7.1kcal/mol. JB10 contains high amount of coumarin, which might contribute to
the inhibitory effects of the virus replication as we observed. 26
In summary, given the urgency of the pandemic around the world, such safe and
cheap liquor might provide help for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Our data support that the JB10 goes into the clinical stage for further validation of the
efficiency for anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapy.

determined by TCID50 titration. JIE BEN No.10 fermentation broth was supplied by
Guizhou Jinqianguo Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), MTT,
Ferrous Sulfate and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Salicylic acid was purchased from J&K Scientific Ltd.
(Beijing, China). Nitric oxide (NO) assay kit (Cat. No.: S0021S) was obtained from
Shanghai Beyotime Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

In vitro antiviral activity
The Vero E6 cells were plated into 96-well plates at densities of 1×104 cells/well. The
cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.05 for 2 h, then the virus
containing medium was replaced with fresh medium in the presence of different doses
of JB10 for 24 h. The viral yield in the cell supernatant was then quantified by
qRT-PCR. Cytotoxicity of JB10 to Vero E6 cells was measured by Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK8) assays as previously reported. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates
(5×103 cells/well) and cultured overnight. JB10 was diluted to 10, 20, 100, 200, 400,
800, 1600 and 3200 times with fresh medium and incubated with cells for another 48
h, the CCK8 was added and incubated for another 4 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was
measured with a microplate reader. The cytotoxicity and mean % inhibition of virus
yield of JB10 were shown in Figure 1. The experiments were repeated at least 3 times.

Antioxidant activities
The antioxidant activities of JB10 were evaluated by DPPH free radical scavenging
assay and hydroxyl radical scavenging assay according to the slightly modified
method by Lim et al. 27 JB10 was diluted with distilled water for different
concentrations of sample. For DPPH free radical scavenging assay, two hundred
microliters sample and 2 ml 400 μL DPPH solution (dissolved in 70% ethanol
solution) were reacted at room temperature for 1 h. The absorbance was measured at
517 nm with a blank containing DPPH and 70% ethanol solution. The DPPH radical
scavenging rate (%) was calculated using the following equation:

the samples.
For hydroxyl radical scavenging activity assay, 250 μL FeSO4 solution (2 mM) ,
250 μL salicylic acid solution (2 mM) and 100 μL sample were mixed well. Two
hundred and fifty microliters hydrogen peroxide solution (0.01%) was added and the
reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at 37 ℃. The absorbance was determined at
510 nm after cooling. The hydroxyl radical scavenging rate (%) was calculated
according to the following equation:

of the sample, Zi0 is the absorbance value of the H2O2 without the color agent.

Anti-inflammatory activity
Before starting the experiment of anti-inflammatory activity, the cytotoxicity of
JB10 to RAW 264.7 cell line was tested. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded into 96-well
plates. After overnight incubation, the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium
containing gradient concentrations (diluted to 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1280
times) of JB10. Triplicate wells were tested at each concentration. After 24 h
treatment, the cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The anti-inflammatory
activity of JB10 was performed according to Liu et al.

with some modifications.

Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were incubated in 24-well plates with the density of 100,
000 cells/well. After overnight incubation, the culture medium was replaced by 0.5 ml
fresh medium containing different concentrations of JB10. Triplicate wells were
tested at each concentration. After 1 h incubation, 50 μL medium containing LPS was
added into each well. The final concentration of LPS was 1μg/mL. After 18 h culture,
100 μL supernatant was put into another clean 96-well plates and the absorbance of
the samples was then measured at 540 nm. The content of NO was calculated from a
sodium nitrite standard curve. The inhibition rate of NO production was calculated as
