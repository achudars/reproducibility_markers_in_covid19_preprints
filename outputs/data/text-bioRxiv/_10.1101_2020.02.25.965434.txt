Abstract
The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected thousands of people with a large
number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing
therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study
took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of
SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II
binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and
physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and
safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected
B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus
identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019; previously 2019-nCoV) has recently emerged as a human
pathogen leading to 51,000 confirmed cases globally and at least 1,600 deaths [1]. SARS-CoV-2 virus is
an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA coronavirus with the genome size of approximately 29.9 kb.
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to several bat coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV virus [2, 3], and all
belong to the B lineage of the beta-coronaviruses [4]. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to
contain the way from human to human and from contact with infected surfaces and objects, causing WHO
declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30th, 2020 [5-7].
Structural proteins are important targets for vaccine and anti-viral drug development due to their
indispensable function to fuse and enter into the host cell [8]. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes glycosylated spike (S)
protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and exists in a
metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral
membrane with the host-cell membrane [1, 9, 10]. The S protein includes the receptor binding S1-subunit
and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RDB) is specifically
recognized by the host receptor. When the S1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor, the prefusion trimer is
destabilized, resulting in the shedding of S1 subunit, and the state transition of S2 subunit to a stable
postfusion conformation [11]. The critical function of the S protein can be a breakthrough in vaccine
design and development.
Great efforts are being made for the discovery of antiviral drugs, but there are no licensed therapeutic or
vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection available in the market. Developing an effective
treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is therefore a research priority. It is time-consuming and expensive to design
novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies [12]. Thus, we chose the method
of immune-informatics, which is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens,
B- and T- cell linear epitope prediction, and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens.
Among those can be analyzed, B-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection,
T-cell and antibody reactions may recover extreme respiratory infection.
In this manuscript, we applied immuno-informatics approach to identify potential B- and T-cell epitopes
based on the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The antigenicity of all the epitopes were estimated and the
interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were evaluated for MHC class-I epitopes.
Allergenicity, toxicity, stability and physiochemical properties were also investigated for exploring the
antigenicity, stability and safety of the identified epitopes. The conservation of all B- and T- cell epitopes
were examined across all isolates from different locations. Some of these identified epitopes could be
used as promising vaccine candidates.

Methods
Data retrieval and structural analysis
Primary sequence of SARS-CoV-2 protein was retrieved from NCBI database using accession number
MN908947.3 [3]. Experimentally known 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was retrieved from
Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6VSB)[1]. Protein sequence was analyzed for its chemicals and physical
properties including GRAVY (Grand average of hydropathicity), half-life, molecular weight, stability
index and amino acid atomic composition via an online tool Protparam [13]. TMHMM v2.0
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) was applied to examine the transmembrane topology of S
protein. Secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein was analyzed by PSIPRED [14]. Existence of
disulphide-bonds were examined through an online tool DIANNA v1.1 which uses trained neural system
to make predictions [15]. Antigenicity of full-length S protein was evaluated by vaxijen v2.0 [16].

B-cell epitope prediction
IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource) [17] with default parameter settings were
used to predict B-cell epitopes. Epitopes predicted by linear epitope prediction of Bepipred and
Bepipred2.0, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fasman beta turn,
and Karplus and Schulz flexibility. BcePred [18] was also used to predict B-cell epitopes using
accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity and

turns.

Predicted B-cell epitopes by IEDB and BcePred were combined to the B-cell epitope candidate list. Based
on transmembrane topology of S protein predicted by TMHMM v2.0, only epitopes on the outer surface
were remained, and other intracellular epitopes were eliminated. VaxiJen 2.0 [16] was applied to evaluate
the antigenicity of the remained epitopes. A stringent criteria was used to have antigenicity score of 0.9
and 14 residue length epitopes viewed adequate to start a defensive immune reaction. A B-cell
discontinuous epitope forms the antigen-binding interface through fragments scattered along the protein
sequence. DiscoTope2.0[19] with discotope score threshold of -3.7 was used to predict discontinuous
epitopes. Pymol was used to examine the positions of selected linear and discontinuous epitopes on the
3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 protein.

predict MHC class I binding T-cell epitopes for S protein. Peptide_binding_to_MHC_class_II_molecules
tool of IEDB and HLA class II set [21] was utilized to predict T-cell epitopes for S protein. Percentile
rank with threshold of 1% for MHC class I binding epitopes and 10% for MHC class II binding epitopes
were used to filter out peptide-allele with weak binding affinity. The antigenicity score of each epitope
was calculated by VaxiJen v2.0. A high stringent standard was used to filter peptides with antigenicity
score larger than or equal to 1, the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 3 for MHC class I
binding epitopes and 5 for MHC class II binding epitopes.

Characterization of selected B-cell and T-cell epitopes
All selected B-cell and MHC class I and II binding T cell epitopes were examined for their allergenicity,
hydro and physiochemical features, toxicity and digestion. Allergenicity of B-cell and T-cell epitopes
were assessed by Allergen FP 1.0 (http://ddg-pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/). Toxicity of B-cell and T-cell
epitopes along with hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity and charge were evaluated by
ToxinPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/index.html). The peptides that can be digested by
several enzymes are usually non-stable, while the peptides digested by fewer enzymes are more stable, so

Protein-epitope interaction evaluation
The 3D structure of human HLA-B35:01(PDB ID: 1A9E) at a resolution of 2.5 Å, HLA-B*51:01 (PDB
ID: 1E27) at a resolution of 2.2 Å and HLA-B*53:01 (PDB ID: 1A1O) at a resolution of 2.3 Å were
downloaded from protein databank (RCSB PDB) and used for evaluating their interactions with selected
epitopes. Protein-peptide interactions were performed by PepSite [22] with the top prediction chosen from
a total of 10 epitope-protein interaction reports.

The S protein sequences were taken from an open access database NGDC (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/),
where 134 SARS-CoV-2 virus strain sequences are documented from 38 locations worldwide. The
mutations in the S protein are documented in 37 isolates. The phylogenetic tree of the S proteins with
mutations were generated using MEGA software [23]. By performing the multiple-sequence-alignment
against the S protein sequences collected from different locations, all the selected epitopes were examined
for their variability and conservation.

Results
Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein
The physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 S protein calculated by Protparam demonstrate that it
contains 1273 amino acids (aa) with molecular weight of 141.18 kDa. Of the 1273 residues, 110 aa and
103 aa were found as negatively and positively charged, respectively. Theoretical iso-electric point (PI) of
S protein was 6.24, reflecting its negative nature. The instability-index (II) was computed to be 33.01,
which categories the S protein as stable. Aliphatic-index was 84.67 with GRAVY (grand average of
hydropathicity) value of -0.079, which reveals a thought of proportional volume hold by aliphatic side
chain. Half-life of the S protein was estimated as 30 hours for mammalian reticulocytes, > 20 hours for
yeast, > 10 hours for Escherichia coli, which measures the total time taken for its vanishing after it has
been synthesized in cell. The number of Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and
Sulfur (S) of a total of 19710 atoms were formulated as C6336H9770N1656O1984S54. The details of the
physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 S protein can be seen in Supplementary Table 1.
Secondary structure of S protein were generated by PSIPRED [14], showing that Beta strand (26.3%),
Helixes (24.4%), and coil (49.3%) are present in structure (Supplementary Figure 1). 20 disulfide (S-S)
bond positions were identified by DiANNA (Supplementary Table 2). 40 cysteine residues were
identified by DiANNA in the full-length of the S protein sequence, which made 20 disulfide (S-S) bonds
at the following positions (15-1240, 131-391, 136-662, 166-1236, 291-671, 301-336, 361-488, 379-743,
432-1235, 480-1248, 525-1247, 538-1043, 590-617, 649-1241, 738-1243, 749-1126, 760-1250, 840-1032,
851-1254, 1082-1253) (Supplementary Table 2). Antigenicity analysis of the full-length protein
confirmed that S protein was an expected antigen with antigenicity score of 0.4646 by Vaxijen. The
transmembrane protein topology predicted by TMHMM showed that residues from 1 to 1213 were
exposed on the surface, residues from 1214 to 1236 were inside transmembrane-region and residues from
1237 to 1273 were within the core-region of the S protein (Fig. 1A).

Identification of B-cell epitopes
B-cell epitopes can guide B-cell to recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection.
Recognition of B-cell epitopes depended on predictions of linear epitopes, antigenicity, hydrophilicity,
accessibility of surface, beta-turn and flexibility [24]. B-cell epitopes of S protein were predicted using
IEDB [17]. A total of 23 and 26 linear epitopes (Supplementary Table 3a) were identified by Bepipred
and by Bepipred2.0, respectively. Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity of S protein was analyzed with
default parameter settings by assessing the physiochemical properties of the amino acid and their

abundance in known B-cell epitopes. The antigenic tendency value of S protein was estimated to be 1.041
(average), 0.866(minimum) and 1.261 (maximum) (Fig. 1B). Hydrophilic region is important in initiating
immune response, which is generally uncovered on the surface of protein. Parker hydrophilicity of S
protein was found to be 1.238 (average), -7.629 (minimum) and 7.743 (maximum) (Fig. 1C). To find the
surface availability of B-cell epitopes, Emini surface accessibility was predicted for S protein with
average of 1 , minimum of 0.042, and maximum of 6.051 (Fig. 1D). Exposed on the surface and
hydrophilic in nature making beta turn a vital structure in starting the defense response. Therefore, we
predicted Chou and Fasman beta turn to gain the result, 0.997 (average), 0.541 (minimum) and 1.484
(maximum) in S protein (Fig. 1E). As the parts of epitope connecting with antibodies are typically elastic
in nature, we predicted Karplus and Schulz flexibility of S protein and the result was 0.993 (average),
0,876 (minimum), and 1.125(maximum) (Fig. 1F). A total of 262 B-cell epitopes were selected based on
the combination of the results (Supplementary Table 3a). BcePred [18] was used to predict B-cell
epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity and
turns. Overall, we obtained totally 129 B-cell epitopes (Supplementary Table 3b).

Antigenicity of predicted B-cell epitopes were further evaluated by VaxiJen v2.0 with high stringent
threshold of 0.9. Based on transmembrane topology of S protein predicted by TMHMM v2.0, intracellular
epitopes were further eliminated. A total of 14 residue length B-cell epitopes were obtained including
‘VRQIAPGQTGKIAD’, ‘VLGQSKRVDFCGKG’, ‘GLTGTGVLTESNKK’ and ‘KIADYNYKLPDDFT’
(Table 1). The four B-cell epitopes were mapped to the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB ID:
6VSB), showing that ‘VLGQSKRVDFCGKG’ and ‘GLTGTGVLTESNKK’ are in less-exposed region
(Figure 2 A, and B), while ‘VRQIAPGQTGKIAD’ and ‘KIADYNYKLPDDFT’ locate in the spike head
which is the most exposed region (Figure 2 C).

fully-exposed ‘spike head’ region (Figure 3B) and less-exposed ‘spike stem’, while a few located in the
‘spike root’ region of the spike (Supplementary Table 3c).

Allergenicity, toxicity and stability analysis of B-cell epitopes
Allergenicity of B-cell epitopes were assessed by Allergen FP 1.0, leading to the result that all of the four
B-cell epitopes were predicted to be not allergenic (Table 2a). Toxicity, hydrophobicity, hydropathicity,
hydrophilicity and charge of B-cell epitopes were examined by a support vector machine (SVM) based
method, ToxinPred. The result demonstrates that all of B-cell epitopes were predicted to be non-toxin
(Table 2a). The stability of B-cell epitopes were evaluated through the number of peptide digesting
enzymes by protein digest server. All B-cell epitopes were found to have multiple non-digesting enzymes
varying from 4 to 7 enzymes (Table 2b).

Identification of T-cell epitopes
Peptide_binding_to_MHC_class_I_molecules tool of IEDB and HLA class I set [20] was utilized to
predict T-cell epitopes for S protein. Percentile rank with threshold of 1% was used to filter out peptideallele with weak binding affinity. The antigenicity score of each peptide was calculated by VaxiJen v2.0
to evaluate its antigenicity. A peptide having both high antigenicity score and capacity to bind with larger
number of alleles is considered to have high potentials to initiate a strong defense response. High
stringent criteria were used to filter peptides with antigenicity score larger than or equal to 1 and the
number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 3. Utilizing the evaluating method above, we obtained a
total of 9 MHC class-I allele binding peptides (Table 3). The peptide ‘IPFAMQMAYR’ has the highest
antigenicity score of 1.5145 and binds with three alleles including A*68:01, B*35:01, and A*33:01. The
peptide ‘FAMQMAYRF’ have the highest number of binding MHC class-I alleles (6 alleles) including
B*35:01, B*53:01, A*23:01, B*58:01, A*24:02, and B*08:01 with strong antigenicity score of 1. 0278.
Peptide_binding_to_MHC_class_II_molecules tool of IEDB and HLA class II set [21] was utilized to
predict T-cell epitopes for S protein. Percentile rank with threshold of 10% was used to filter out peptideallele with weak binding affinity. The antigenicity score of each peptide was calculated by VaxiJen v2.0
to evaluate its antigenicity. A high stringent standard was used to filter peptides with antigenicity score
larger than or equal to 1 and the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 5. As a result, we
obtained

Allergenicity, toxicity and stability analysis of T-cell epitopes
Allergenicity of T-cell epitopes were assessed by Allergen FP 1.0. Results showed that two of nine MHC
class-I binding peptides were probably non-allergen, and nine of thirteen MHC class-II binding peptides
were predicted to be non-allergen (Table 5). Toxicity of T-cell epitopes along with hydrophobicity,
hydropathicity, hydrophilicity and charge were evaluated by ToxinPred. All of T-cell epitopes were
predicted to be non-toxin (Table 5). The stability of T-cell epitopes were evaluated through the number of
peptide digesting enzymes by protein digest server. All T-cell epitopes were found to have multiple nondigesting enzymes varying from 4 to 11 enzymes (Table 6).

Interaction of T-cell epitopes with HLA alleles
Protein-peptide interactions are critical in cellular signaling pathways. Two MHC class-I binding epitopes,
‘LPIGINITRF’ and ‘IAIVMVTIM’, were predicted to be non-allergic and non-toxic. Both epitopes were
predicted to bind to HLA-B35:01, HLA-B*51:01, and HLA-B*53:01. The 3D structure of human HLAB35:01(PDB ID: 1A9E) [25], HLA-B*51:01 (PDB ID: 1E27) [26] and HLA-B*53:01 (PDB ID: 1A1O)
[27] protein were accessible with co-crystallized peptide in PDB database. Protein-peptide interactions
were performed by PepSite [22]. 10 epitope-protein interactions were reported and the top prediction was
chosen. HLA-B*35:01 (1A9E) is of a hetero 2mer structure with 386 residues. Epitope ‘LPIGINITRF’
was predicted to significantly bind on the surface of HLA-B35:01(PDB ID: 1A9E) through six hydrogen
bonds with Leu-1, Pro-2, Ile-3, Gly-4, Ile-5, and Ans-6 (Figure 4 A). Epitope ‘IAIVMVTIM’ moderately
significantly bond to HLA-B35:01(PDB ID: 1A9E) via six hydrogen bonds with Ile-3, Val-4, Met-5, Thr7, Ile-8, and Met-9 (Figure 4B). Similarly, both epitope ‘LPIGINITRF’ and ‘IAIVMVTIM’ show strong
and stable bonding with HLA-B*51:01 (1E27) residues (Figure 4C-D), and HLA-B*53:01 (PDB ID:
1A1O) residues (Figure 4E-F), respectively.

Conservation of B- and T-cell epitopes
Sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with identified mutations from 38 locations worldwide were
subjected to multiple sequence alignment of all selected B- and T-cell epitopes. There were no mutations

utilized in the analysis. A phylogenetic tree was generated to show the evolutionary relationship of
SARS-CoV-2 S protein collected from 38 locations worldwide (Figure 5).

Discussion
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious health threat for the whole society, thus there is an urgent
need for drugs and preventative measures. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by lung infections
with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Based on the information from CDC
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the symptoms can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as
14 days after exposure to the virus which can transmit from human to human or from contact with
infected surfaces and objects [5-7].
It is critical to rapidly identify immune epitopes. The S protein is of crucial in the fuse and entry of virus
into host cells [1], therefore it is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies. The specificity of epitopebased vaccines can be enhanced by selecting parts of S protein exposed on the surface [28]. Medical
biotechnology is important in developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, computer-based
immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness, as a result, it is also an essential
method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development.
In this study, we characterized the physio-chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome for
epitope candidates and adopted an immune-informatics based pipeline with highly stringent criteria to
identify S protein targeted B- and T-cell epitopes that may potentially promote an immune response in the

host. The antigenicity, flexibility, solvent accessibility, disulphide bonds of predicted epitopes were
evaluated, yielding four potential B-cell epitope and vaccine candidate. Allergenicity and toxicity analysis
confirmed the four B-cell epitopes are of non-allergen and non-toxin. Stability analysis revealed that they
can not be digested by multiple enzymes. In addition, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding Tcell epitopes were predicted to interact with numerous HLA alleles and to be highly antigenic in nature.
Allergenicity, toxicity, and physiochemical properties of T-cell epitopes were analyzed to increase
specificity and selectivity. The stability and safety were confirmed by digestion analysis. All selected Band T- cell (MHC class-I and II) epitopes were conserved in all isolates of different locations globally
without mutations observed yet.
We predict the B- and T-cell epitopes identified here may assist the development of potent peptide-based
vaccines to address the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. But the replication of SARS-CoV-2 must be error-prone,
which is similar to SARS-CoV with reported mutation rate of 4x10-4 substitutions/site/year [29]. Antiviral vaccines are necessary to be developed before the predicted epitopes are potentially obsolete. In
addition, our immune-informatics based pipeline also provides a framework to identify B- and T- cell
epitopes having therapeutic potential with excellent scope for SARS-CoV-2, but not limited to specific
virus.
