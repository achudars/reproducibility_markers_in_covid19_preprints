Abstract
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is engendering the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The spike (S) protein
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the three sub-domains viz. amino acids (aa) 22-42, aa 79-84, and
aa 330-393 of ACE2 on human cells to initiate entry. It was reported earlier that the receptor utilization capacity of ACE2
proteins from different species, such as cats, chimpanzees, dogs, and cattle, are different. A comprehensive analysis of ACE2
receptors of nineteen species was carried out in this study, and the findings propose a possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission flow
across these nineteen species.

Keywords: ACE2; Viral spike receptor-binding domain; SARS-CoV-2; Transmission; Bioinformatics.

1. Introduction
We have been acquainted with the term beta-coronavirus for about two decades when we first encountered the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak that emerged in 2002, infecting about 8000 people with a
10% mortality rate [1]. It was followed by the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
5

in 2012 with 2300 cases and mortality rate of 35% [2]. The third outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in
December 2019 in China, Wuhan province, which rapidly took the form of a pandemic [3, 4]. To date, this new human
coronavirus has affected 36 million people worldwide and is held accountable for over one million deaths [5]. SARS-CoV-2
is an enveloped single-stranded plus sense RNA virus whose genome is about 30kb in length, and which encodes for 16
non-structural proteins, four structural and six accessory proteins [6]. The four major structural proteins which play a vital

10

role in viral pathogenesis are Spike protein (S), Nucleocapsid protein (N), Membrane protein (M), and Envelope protein (E)
[7, 8]. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly characterized by pneumonia [9]; however, multi-organ failure involving myocardial
infarction, hepatic, and renal damage is also reported in patients infected with this virus [10]. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell surface via its S protein [11, 12]. ACE2 plays an essential
role in viral attachment and entry [13]. The study of the interaction of ACE2 and S protein is of utmost importance [14, 15].

15

The S1 subunit of the S protein has two domains, the C-terminal and the N-terminal domains, which fold independently,
and either of the domains can act as Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) for the interaction and binding to the ACE2 receptor
widely expressed on the surface of many cell types of the host [16, 17]. The human ACE2 protein is 805 amino acid
long, containing two functional domains: the extracellular N-terminal claw-like peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal
transmembrane collectrin domain with a cytosolic tail [18]. The RBD of the S protein binds to three different regions of

20

ACE2, which are located at amino acids (aa) 24-42, 79-84, and 330-393 positions present in the claw-like peptidase domain
of ACE2 [13]. ACE2 modulates angiotensin activities, which promote aldosterone release and increase blood pressure and
inflammation, thus causing damage to blood vessel linings and various types of tissue injury [19]. ACE2 converts Angiotensin
II to other molecules and reduces this effect [20]. However, when SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, the function of ACE2 is
inhibited and in turn leads to endocytosis of the virus particle into the host cell [21].

25

Zoonotic transmission of this virus from bat to human and random mutations acquired by SARS-CoV-2 during human to
human transmission has also empowered this virus with the ability to undergo interspecies transmission and recently many
cases have been reported stating that different species can be infected by this virus [22].
In this study, we aim to determine the susceptibility of other species, whether they bear the capability of being a possible
host of SARS-CoV-2. We chose nineteen different species and analyzed the ACE2 protein sequence in relation to the human

30

ACE2 sequence and determined the degree of variability by which the sequences differed from each other. We performed
a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis in addition to the phylogenetic analysis based on full-length sequence homology,
polarity along with individual domain sequence homology and secondary structure prediction of these protein sequences.
These finding could be emerged to six distinct clusters of nineteen species based on the collective analysis and thereby
provided a prediction of the interspecies SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

The three designated domains, D1 (aa 24-42), D2 (aa 79-84) and D3(aa 330-393) respectively contain the residues which
50

bind to the RBD of the S protein.
2.2. Methods
Examining amino acid substitutions: For human ACE2 receptor, substitutions were examined for all species and
only those substitutions are accounted for, which occurred in the binding residues in the mentioned three domains D1, D2
and D3 [13]. Based character of the substitutions which interfered with the binding residues of the ACE2 across various

55

species, two types were defined: substitutions affected transmission (M1), and substitutions did not affect transmission (M2).
Multiple sequence alignments and associated phylogenetic trees were developed using the NCBI web-suite across all the
individual binding domains D1, D2, and D3 of ACE2 of the nineteen species [25, 26].
K-means clustering: Algorithmic clustering technique derives homogeneous subclasses within the data such that data
points in each cluster are as similar as possible according to a widely used distance measure viz. Euclidean distance. One of

60

the most commonly used simple clustering techniques is the K-means clustering [27, 28]. The algorithm is described below
in brief:
Algorithm: K-means algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to form equivalence classes from the feature vectors
into K (pre-defined) clusters where each data point belongs to only one cluster [27].
• Assign the number of desired clusters (K) (in the present study, K = 6).

65

• Find centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without
replacement.
• Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids.
• Find the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
• Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).

70

• Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points that belong to each cluster.

In this present study, nineteen species were clustered using Matlab by inputting the distance matrix derived from the
feature vectors associated with the three domains of ACE2 across all species.
Secondary structure predictions: The secondary structure of full-length ACE2 sequence of all species were predicted
using the web-server CFSSP (Chou & Fasman Secondary Structure Prediction Server) [29]. This server predicts secondary
75

structure regions from the protein sequence such as alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and turns from the amino acid sequence [29]. On
obtaining the full-length ACE2 secondary structures, individual domains D1, D2, and D3 were cropped for each species.
Bioinformatics features: Several bioinformatics features viz. Shannon entropy, instability index, aliphatic index,
charged residues, half-life, melting temperature, N-terminal of the sequence, molecular weight, extinction coefficient, net
charge at pH7 and isoelectric point of D1, D2, and D3 domains of ACE2 for all nineteen species were determined using the

80

web-servers Pfeature and ProtParam [30, 31].
Shannon entropy: It measures the amount of complexity in a primary sequence of ACE2. It was determined using the
web-server Pfeature by the formula
SE = −

20
X

pi log2 (pi )

i=1

where pi denotes the frequency probability of a given amino acid in the sequence [30].
Instability index is determined using the web-server ProtParam and it estimates the stability of a protein in a test tube.
A protein whose instability index is smaller than 40 is predicted as stable. A value above 40 predicts that the protein may
be unstable [30].
85

Aliphatic index of a protein is defined as the relative volume gathered by aliphatic side chains (alanine, valine, isoleucine,
and leucine). It may be regarded as a positive factor for increasing the thermostability of globular proteins, such as ACE2
[30].
N-terminal: It was reported that the N-terminal of a protein is responsible for its function. For each domain sequence,
N-terminal residue was determined using the Pfeature [30].

90

In vivo half-life: The half-life predicts the time it takes for half of the protein amount to degrade after its synthesis in
the cell. The N-end rule originated from the observations that the identity of the N-terminal residue of a protein plays an
essential role in determining its stability in vivo [32].
Extinction coefficients: The extinction coefficient measures how much light a protein absorbs at a particular wavelength.
It is useful to estimate this coefficient when a protein is getting purified [32].

95

Polarity sequence: Every amino acid in the domains D1, D2 and D3 of ACE2 were recognized as polar (P) and non-polar
(Q) and thus every D1, D2 and D3 for all the species turned out to be binary sequences with two symbols P and Q. Then
homology of these sequences for each domain was made and consequently, phylogenetic relationship was drawn.
3. Results
Based on amino acid homology, secondary structures, bioinformatics and polarity of the three domains D1, D2 and D3 of

100

ACE2, all nineteen species were clustered. Finally a cumulative set of nineteen species clusters was built, among which the
SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur.
3.1. Phylogeny and clustering based on ACE2 domain-based homology
First, we examined all the substitutions with similar properties and similar side chain binding atoms, signifying that the
substitutions would not impede the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Note that, all the mutations are considered concerning the

105

human ACE2 domains D1, D2 and D3 (Fig.2).

Figure 2: Substitutions in D1, D2 and D3 domains of ACE2 across eighteen species

In D1 domain: out of eighteen species, eight species were found to possess a substitution at position 30 where D
(Aspartate) was substituted by E (Glutamate) and four species were found to carry the D38E substitution. It was reported
that in the aspartate side chain, the oxygen atom was involved in ionic-ionic interaction and the side-chain oxygen atom
was also present in glutamate, so this substitution may not affect the protein-protein interaction properties [33, 34]. In the
110

T27S substitution, Threonine and Serine both possess OH that participates in binding and in the H34L substitution, both
Histidine and Leucine use the NH group for interaction with another amino acid. Consequently, if we consider only the
critical perspective for these substitutions, we can conclude that these changes would not impede the binding between the S
and ACE2 protein.
In D2 domain: L79I bears importance across eighteen species since both these amino acids (Leucine and isoleucine)

115

share similar chemical properties. So, if we analyze the changes in amino acid residues based on their chemical properties,
which is the main contributing factor for protein-protein interaction, we can conclude that it will not significantly affect the
binding between ACE-2 and RBD of the S protein.
In D3 domain: out of eleven substitutions, three substitutions (R393K, K353H, and K353R) were observed of the similar
type with similar side chain interacting atoms and therefore changes at these positions would not affect the interaction of

120

ACE2 with that of the S protein.
Secondly, across all nineteen species, homology were derived based on amino acid sequences, and consequently, associated
phylogenetic trees were drawn (Fig.3).

Figure 3: Multiple sequence alignments of D1, D2 and D3 domains of ACE2 of nineteen species (A) and respective phylogenies (B).

Six clusters of the nineteen species were formed using the K-means clustering technique based on sequence homology of the
three domains (Fig 4). The clusters of species {S1, S2, S3} and {S6, S13} stayed together for the ACE2 full-length sequence
125

homology and the combination of three domain-based sequence similarity. The species S16, S17, and S18 also followed the
same as observed.

Figure 4: Clusters of species based on domain-based sequence homology

Further, it was observed that sequence homology of the D1, D2, and D3 domains clustered the species S15 into the cluster
where S9, S10 and S12 belong, although S15 was similar to the ACE2 sequence of S8 and S9. Although the species S4 was
very much similar to S9, S10, and S12 for full-length ACE2 homology, it clubbed with S5 and S11 concerning the three
130

domain-based sequence spatial organizations. Also S7 was found to be staying in the proximity of S6 and S13 although S7
was very much similar to S5 and S11 based on ACE2 homology.
3.2. Clustering based on secondary structures
For each domain of ACE2 of nineteen species, the secondary structure was predicted (Fig.5). For each domain species are
grouped into several subgroups.

135

With respect to the D1 domain:
• Bos taurus and Capra hircus
• Equus caballus and Felis catus
• Mustela putorius furo has a structure closer to Equus caballus and Felis catus as it has only one difference of a coil
present at position 42. Also, Mesocricetus auratus has a secondary structure similar to the above two except an extended

140

helix at position four. Similarly, Sus scrofa which has an extended sheet instead of a helix at position 42. So, Mustela
putorius furo, Mesocricetus auratus, and Sus scrofa can be put in the same cluster as Equus caballus and Felis catus.
• Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta and Pan troglodytes
• Manis javanica and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum
• Pteropus alecto and Pteropus Vampyrus

145

• Rattus norvegicus and Pelodiscus sinensis have similar structures differing by the presence of an extra coil at position
39 for Rattus norvegicus.
• Gallus gallus and Danio rerio has a unique secondary structure in comparison to the others.

These individual six clusters show six different secondary structures in D1 shared by sixteen species, which shows high
similarities in their secondary structures, while the rest two have a unique secondary structure for D1 domain. Thus, these
150

six clusters have similar secondary structures indicating that the species in the six clusters are closely related.

With respect to the D2 domain:
• Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta and Pan troglodytes
• Bos taurus, Mustela putorius furo, Pteropus alecto and Pteropus vampyrus
• Equus caballus, Felis catus, Manis javanica, Pelodiscus sinensis and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum
155

• Danio rerio and Gallus gallus
Similarly, for D2 domain, we found four clusters with the same secondary structure, indicating that they are closely
related.
With respect to the D3 domain:
• Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes

160

• Bos Taurus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Sus scrofa and Capra hircus
• Equus caballus and Felis catus
• Pteropus alecto and Pteropus vampyrus
Again for D3 domain, four different clusters were bearing similar secondary structures therefore these species are also
closely related.

165

Based on the similarity among the three domains, all nineteen species were clustered (Fig.6).

Figure 6: Clusters of species based on the secondary structures of the D1, D2 and D3 domains

From the clusters (Fig.6) based on the secondary structure of the three domains of ACE2, it was observed that the
species S4 was clustered uniquely, though S4 is clustered with S9 and S19 based on ACE2 full-length sequence homology.
Furthermore, S6 and S13 were found to be similar based on ACE2 homology, but they got clustered into two different clusters
when the secondary structure of three domains was concerned. In contrast, the group of species {S1, S2, S3}, {S9, S12},
170

{S16, S18}, and {S5, S7S11} remained in the same clusters concerning to ACE2 homology as well as individual secondary
structures of the domains.

For each species, a twelve-dimensional feature vector was found (Fig.7). For each domain D1, D2, and D3 domain, distance
matrix was determined using the Euclidean distance

. Note that here fi and gi denote the ith feature for the species S and T respectively. This distance matrices with heatmap
representation for all three domains are presented in Figs. 8, 9 & 10. In addition, by inputting the distance matrix, using
the K-means clustering technique, several clusters of species were formed for each domain (Figs. 8, 9 and 10).

Figure 10: Distance matrix based on the bioinformatics feature vectors of D3 of ACE2 across nineteen species and associated clusters

A final set of six clusters was formed using the K-means clustering method to have all three domains for the nineteen
180

different species (Fig. 11). Although the species S7 was clustered with the species S5 and S11 as per full-length ACE2 sequence
homology, S7 formed a unique singleton cluster when the bioinformatics features were taken into consideration. Similarly,
the species S16 formed a singleton cluster though it was clustered with S17, S18, and S19 as per amino acid homology of
ACE2. The sequence homology of ACE2 made the four species S16, S17, S18, and S19 into a single cluster but bioinformatics
features placed the species S18 in a cluster where the other three species S1, S2, and S3 belonged. Based on bioinformatics

185

features, S4 clustered together with S15 though the ACE2 receptor of S4 was sequentially similar to ACE2 of S9, S10, and
S12.

Figure 11: Clusters of species based on the bioinformatics of the D1, D2, and D3 domains

The clusters {S1, S2, S3}, {S6, S13}, and {S9, S10, S12} were unaltered with respect to the full length ACE2 homology
and bioinformatics features.
3.4. Phylogeny and clustering based on polarity
190

In the D1 domain, it was observed that across eighteen species, polarity of thirteen amino acids among nineteen (24-42
aa) amino acids were found to be conserved. Based on the polarity and non-polarity nature of the amino acids, the species
were arranged in a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 12).
It was found that Homo sapiens, Pan troglodyte, Macaca mulatta and Danio rerio were closer according to this analysis.
Pteropus alecto, Pteropus vampyrus and Sus scrofa were occurred in parallel along with the above three and formed a

195

different clade indicating the closeness based on polarity. Again, the case for Gallus gallus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum,
Mustela putorius furo, Equus caballus and Felis catus is similar. Two separate groups, Mesocricetus auratus, Manis javanica
and Capra hircus, Bos taurus, were similarly placed nearby, indicating that the polarity of amino acids of the proteins for
these species was similar. Pelodiscus sinensis and Rattus norvegicus occurred separately and were not grouped with any
other species but bears similarity with both the groups containing species Mesocricetus auratus, Manis javanica and Pteropus

200

alecto, Pteropus vampyrus, Sus scrofa.
In the D2 domain, out of six amino acid long sequences, the polarity of three amino acids was conserved across 18
species, and among them, one amino acid was a binding residue. Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, Pteropus
vampyrus and Pteropus alecto were grouped together since the overall polarity of their amino acid chain was found to be
similar and simultaneously, Danio rerio, Mustela putorius furo, Gallus gallus and Pelodiscus sinensis were placed together.

205

Also, three groups comprising Manis javanica, Capra hircus & Bos taurus, Sus scrofa & Rattus norvegicus, Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum respectively were placed in close proximity based on their polarity and non-polarity of the amino acids in the
protein sequence. However, Equus caballus, Felis cattus, and Mesocricetus auratus were placed separately since they did not
show much resemblance based on polarity.

Figure 12: Polarity sequence of the D1, D2 and D3 domains across all species alignment and associated phylogenetic relationships

In the D3 domain of ACE2 sequences of Salmo salar and Danio rerio there was an insertion of a polar amino acid in
210

one of the binding residue positions that may affect the binding of ACE2 to that of RBD of SARS-CoV2 negatively. A
total of three binding residues were already reported in the D3 domain, of which one of them remained conserved concerning
polarity across the nineteen species. Rattus norvegicus, Mustela putorius furo, Mesocricetus auratus and Felis catus were
grouped under a single clade based on the polarity of their protein sequence. Similar was the case for Danio rerio, Pelodiscus
sinensis, Salmo salar, and Gallus gallus. Due to the sequence similarity between Pteropus vampyrus and Pteropus alecto,

215

their polarity of the protein sequence was also similar and thus grouped. Sequence similarity was also observed for Homo
sapiens, Pan troglodytes and Macaca mulatta, so again these were categorized together. Two groups comprising of Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum, Capra hircus and Bos taurus, Sus scrofa respectively, were sorted together indicating their similar nature of

polarity and non-polarity of protein sequence. Lastly, Manis javanica and Equus caballus were placed separately signifying
that the sequence of both the species were quite distinct.
220

The individual groups of species based on the polarity of individual D1, D2 and D3 domains have emerged into six disjoint
clusters (Fig. 13).

Figure 13: Clusters based on groups of species based on domain-wise polarity

Here the clusters {S1, S2, S3}, {S16, S17, S18}, {S8, S14}, {S6, S13}, and {S10, S12} remained invariant with regards to
the homology of full length ACE2 as well as polarity sequence of the D1, D2 and D3 domains.
3.5. Possible clusters of transmission of SARS-CoV-2
225

Based on all the different clustered formed on the basis of amino acid homology, secondary structures, bioinformatics,
and polarity of the D1, D2, and D3 domains of ACE2, final clusters of all nineteen species were devised using the K-means
clustering method Fig. 14.

Figure 14: Schematic representation of a possible set of clusters of transmission of SARS-CoV-2

In Fig. 14, it was found that the cluster-1 (C-1) comprising of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodyte, and Macaca mulatta were
close to cluster-5 (C-5) comprising of Felis catus (Cat), Mesocricetus auratus (Golden Hamster), Manis javanica (Sunda
230

pangolin), Mustela putorius furo (Ferret), Rattus norvegicus (Rat), and Rhinolphus ferrumequinum (Greater horseshoe bat).
This C-5 is also close to cluster-3 (C-3) [Gallus gallus (red jungle fowl), Pelodiscus sinensis (Chinese shell turtle), Danio
rerio (zebrafish) and Salmo salar], and cluster-4 (C-4) [Capra hircus (Goat), Bos taurus (Cattle) and Sus scrofa (pig)]. C-4

also showed resemblance with cluster-2 (C-2) [Pteropus alecto, and Pteropus vampyrus], and cluster-6 (C-6) that comprised
of Equus caballus (horse) only. Although, both C-2 and C-6 were also close to each other.
235

Furthermore, a pooled analyses based on the two type of substitutions (one is affecting SARS-CoV-2 transmission (M1),
and the other one is SARS-CoV-2 non-affecting transmission(M2)) for all the six final clusters are presented in Table-3.

Based on the Table-3 information regarding the number of M1 and M2 substitutions, the intra-species transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 were enlightened as follow:
• C-1: None of the species bear any mutation in the binding residues and are conserved, so viral transmission is immac240

ulate.
• C-2: This cluster has an equal number of transmission affecting and transmission non-affecting types of substitutions.
Therefore, both have an equal probability of getting infected from each other.
• C-3: Here again, Gallus gallus, Pelodiscus sinensis, and Danio rerio have a similar ratio of S1 to S2, signifying possible
flow of viral transmission within these three species. However, Salmo salar is unique and distant, and therefore, the

245

probability of viral transmission is unlikely.
• C-4: The species in this cluster have a similar number of transmission-affecting and transmission non-affecting type of
substitutions which shows that the flow of viral transmission would be continuous among these three species.
• C-5: Transmission between Felis catus and Mesocrietus auratus is highly likely which is the same for Manis javanica,
Mustela putorius furo, and Rattus norvegicus as indicated by their similar number of substitutions. Therefore, the

250

inter-transmission between these species is highly plausible. While Rhinolophus ferrumequinum has a relatively high
value of transmission affecting substitutions from all of the above, its susceptibility to getting infected from others
species is uncertain.
• C-6: A total of five transmission affecting substitutions in the three domains for human were observed.

4. Discussion
255

In this study, we amassed the ACE2 protein sequences of nineteen species to investigate the possible transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 among these species in relation to human ACE2 protein. Multiple sequence alignments of these ACE2 receptors

enabled us to estimate the similarity concerning amino acids and from that, we observed that Salmo salar (Salmon fish)
was quite distant. It also gave us the idea that some of the amino acid substitutions in the binding residues occurring
across the species with respect to human ACE2 were resulted in amino acids having similar binding properties, indicating
260

that their interactions with RBD of the S protein will be similar to that of humans, thus making transmission across these
species feasible. It was observed that Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes (Chimpanzee) have complete sequence similarity.
In contrast, Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) shared a high percentage of sequence identity except for two amino acid
positions. However, no substitutions were observed in the binding of amino acid residues, making the viral transmission
across these species highly likely. Again, Pteropus vampyrus (Large flying fox) and Pteropus alecto (Black flying fox) have

265

precisely the same ACE2 sequence and thus signifying high viral transmission and that both of them have an equal chance
of getting infected with each other.
Further analysis led us to present a possible transmission flow among the nineteen species, as illustrated in Fig. 14. The
multifaceted examination of the ACE2 protein indicated that interspecies SARS-CoV-2 transmission is quite possible and we
have tried to provide a better insight into it by predicting the possible transmission among species within the same cluster

270

and between clusters too. However, further in-depth analysis is necessary in the future for the identification of new hosts of
SARS-CoV-2 as well as for determination of possible ways to prevent inter-species transmission.
