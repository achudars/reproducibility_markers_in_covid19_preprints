Abstract
Wuhan Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global outbreak which has
raised the concern of scientific community to design and discover a definitive cure against this
deadly virus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading.
To date, no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection
caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines
against the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and
immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine
constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on
molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against SARS-CoV-2. Later,
molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in
order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected
vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to
secure a definitive treatment against this lethal virus.

1. Introduction
1.1. Origin of Coronavirus, Their Morphology, Pathology and Others
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, which is surrounded by crownshaped, club-like spikes projection on the outer surface [1][2]. Coronaviruses spike protein are
glycoprotein that are embedded over the viral envelope. This spike protein attaches to specific
cellular receptors and initiates structural changes of spike protein, and causes penetration of cell
membranes which results in the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell [3]. The viral spike
protein includes N-terminal, which is crucial for identification of Coronaviruses [4]. Coronaviruses
have a large RNA genome in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases and capable of obtaining
distinct ways of replication [5]. Like all other RNA viruses, coronavirus undergoes replication of
genome and transcription of mRNAs upon infection. Synthesis of a full-length negative-strand
RNA serves as template for full-length genomic RNA [3][6]. Coronaviruses are a large family of
viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales [7]. that are common in
many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats [8]. This group of viruses
can cause wide varieties of respiratory illness in mammals and birds. In human, it causes common
cold, leading to severe illness pneumonia to elderly people and immunocompromised people, like
hospital patients [9]. This viral pathogen was responsible for the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS) and 2019 Novel coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) in China outbreaks [10]. Coronavirus in form of SARS, MERS and Novel coronavirus are
lethal leading to large number of deaths. Coronavirus subfamily is classified into four genera, the
alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infections are caused
by alpha- and beta-CoV. CoVs are common human pathogens, and 30% to 60% of the Chinese

population is positive for anti-CoV antibodies [11]. These viral infections caused by CoV are
generally associated the upper respiratory tract to lower respiratory tract. Immunocompromised
people like elderly people and infants are more vulnerable and susceptible to this group of viruses
[12].

For many decades HCoVs are well adapted to humans and it had been prevalent among Human
races. In 1960s, the first identification of Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) was made in patients
with common cold. Following that incident more HCoVs has been detected, that involved the two
major outbreak SARS and MERS, two pathogens that, upon infection, can cause fatal respiratory
disease in humans [13].
The most common coronaviruses among humans are 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 and some
can evolve and cause human diseases, becoming new human coronaviruses. Three recent examples
of these are SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV [14]. SARS-CoV was the causal agent of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China.
6-8 MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in
the Middle East [15].
Chinese scientists were able to sequence the viral genome using next genome sequencing from the
collected samples and identified the cause as a SARS-like coronavirus. The genetic sequence is
now available for scientist all around the world which would aid faster diagnosis of further cases
[2] [16][17]. Based on full genome sequence data on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza
Data [GISAID] platform, the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 ensuring faster development
of point-of-care real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tests specific for novel Coronavirus diseases or
COVID-19 [18]. Association of genome sequence with other evidences demonstrated that SARS-

CoV-2 is 75 to 80% identical to the SARS-CoV and even more closely related to several bat CoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 can be cultured in the same cells that are ideal for growing SARS-CoV and MERSCoV [19]. Another group of scientists have investigated the origin of the SARS-CoV-2, using
comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon
usage (RSCU). The evidence and analysis suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a
recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. the viral spike
glycoprotein recombined within themselves, and recognizes cell surface receptor. Scientist are
speculating that the SARS-CoV-2 originated form snakes based on Homologous recombination
within the spike glycoprotein could be a probable way of transmission in between snake and
humans [20].
1.2. Severity of China Outbreak of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
China is in its extremity due to the outbreak of a respiratory virus, called coronavirus and
considered as related to SARS virus [21][22]. It is reported to be originated in the animal and
seafood market of Wuhan, Hubei province, China – one of the largest cities in China which has
11M residents thus entitled as Wuhan Coronavirus [21] [23]. The disease it caused is called novel
Coronavirus disease or COVID-19. World health organization (WHO) is investigating the virus
since 31st December, 2019 after being reported [24][25]. SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly virus and
Chinese authority reported WHO a pneumonia like case on 31 st December, 2019 and the infection
has spread destructively since then [26]. First death of a 61 years old man was reported on 11 th
January by Chinese health authorities in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [25][27][28]. Second
death of a 69 years old man was reported on 15th January in the central city of Wuhan, Hubei
province, China who had symptoms of pneumonia [29][30]. In Thailand, first emerging
international case outside the China was reported on 13 th January and the first emerging case

outside the Wuhan city, China was reported on 19th January [25][31]. On January 20, it was
reported that COVID-19 virus can be transmitted from human to human which cracked the idea
that it can only be transmitted through infected animals [32]-[35] and on the same day China Health
authority reported the third death [36]. It was recorded that the number of infections rose up to 10
fold between 17th-20th January [37]. United States confirmed the first infected case in Washington
state on 21st January who had recently been returned from china [38]. As of 23rd January China
reported 830 infected cases and the death toll rose up to 25 in China [39][40]. On the same date
several confirmed infected cases were reported worldwide, Taiwan (1 case ), Macao(2 cases),
Hong Kong(2cases),Vietnam (2cases) ,Thailand (3cases), Japan (2cases), South Korea(2
cases),Singapore (1case) ,United States (1case) [41]. On 24 January the health minister of France
Agnes Buzyn announced three confirmed infected cases, two in Paris and 1 case in Bordeaux.
France is the first European country to be announced as infected [42]-[44].
Chinese authority banned public and air transport in Wuhan on 23 January and the residents of the
country were kept under quarantine [45]. National Health Commission of China reported on 25 th
January that as of 24th January the virus took 41 lives and 1300 infected cases were reported
worldwide [46]-[48]. As of January 25, China confirmed 2000 infected cases worldwide, among
these 1975 cases were reported in China with rising death toll to 56 [49]-[51]. Chinese health
authority announced on January 27 that the coronavirus death toll jumped to 81 and 2744 infected
cases in china were reported [52]-[54]. German authorities confirmed first infected case of
coronavirus and it is reported as second European country to be infected. The health authority said
that the patient is in the good condition and is kept under medical observation [55][56]. Health and
Human Services Secretary of U.S. said on 28th January that the infected cases in U.S. remained
five with no deaths, while France reported forth infected case. In china 106 deaths with more than

4520 infected cases were reported on 28th January [57][58]. Alarming situation due to rising
confirmed cases outside China made governments of other countries to start evacuation of their
citizens from Wuhan, China and these include U.S., France, Japan, Australia, Germany, New
Zealand, France [59]. Approximately, 170 deaths and 7,711 confirmed cases were reported with
1,737 new cases by Chinese National health commission on 29 th January [60]. The U.S.
government evacuated 240 Americans, mostly diplomats and their family members from the
epicenter of the virus outbreak on 29th January by a chartered airplane [61]. Another report stated
that on the same day chartered ANA airplane by Japanese government landed in Heneda Airport
after evacuating 206 Japanese nationals [62].
The World Health Organization (WHO) had a meeting at the WHO headquarter in Geneva on 30 th
January and WHO declared the outbreak as Public Health Emergency and it is also said by the
committee that the declaration was made giving priority the other countries outside China [63].
On 30th January the U.S. state department advised their citizens not to travel to China as the death
toll jumped to 204 with 9,692 infected cases worldwide [64]. In China 213 deaths and globally
9,826 confirmed cases were reported on 31st January by Chinese national health authorities, among
which 9,720 cases in China and 106 cases in 19 countries outside China [65][66]. On 1st February
the death toll reached to 258 with 11,948 confirmed cases worldwide stated by Hubei Provincial
Health Commission [67][68]. On the same day German Ministry of Health said that a military
airplane landed at Frankfurt airport after evacuating 128 German citizens from Wuhan who will
be quarantined till mid of February and the health minister also stated that Germany military
aircraft delivered aid and 1000 protective suits to Chinese authorities requested by China [69].
First known fatality outside China reported of a 44 year old man in Philippines by Philippine
health officials on 2nd February as the novel coronavirus outbreak took 362 lives and 17,205 cases

were reported according to Chinese and World Health Organization data [70][71].The Nation’s
flagship carrier, Qantas , was chartered by Australian government and the airplane landed in
Learmonth, Western Australia after evacuating 243 citizens including 89 children on 3 rd February
from where the citizens would be sent by another flight to Christmas Island to be quarantined [72].
New 1000-bed facility Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan is built in only 10 days to mitigate the
pressure of patients in other medical hospitals in Wuhan. A crew of more than 7000 workers started
working around the clock on 24 January which covers 60000 square meters with special quarantine
area and opened its door to receive patients on 3rd February [73][74]. Kerala government
announced the third confirmed case in India on 3rd February who is a student [75] just like the 1st
case (reported on 30th January in Kerala) and 2nd case (reported on 2nd February in Kerala)
according to the Ministry of Health and Family welfare of India [76][77]. A British pharmaceutical
company, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) stated on 3rd February that they would like to collaborate with
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) that works for developing vaccines. GSK
said that they are ready to work with their adjuvant technology to increase immunity to the patients
as well as to develop vaccine for coronavirus outbreak Health authorities in China stated on 4th
February that as end of 3rd February the coronavirus fatalities jumped to 425 in China and 427
worldwide as the second fatality announced in Hong Kong of a 39 year old man reported on same
day in the early morning [75][78]. The authority also said that the confirmed cases reached to
20,438 worldwide [79][80]. COVID-19 claimed second death of a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong,
outside mainland China on 4th February, 2020 [81].
On 5th February, 2020 a Japanese cruise ship, docked at Yokohama, Japan called Diamond
Princess was quarantined for two weeks by Health officials after the disembarked Hong Kong
citizen tested positive of virus which started it’s round trip carrying 3711 individuals on board

including 2666 passengers and 1045 crew members [82]. Within 48 hours the number of infected
cases on the cruise ship jumped sharply to 61, reported on 7th February, 2020 [83] and another
report stated the death of the Chinese doctor, Li Wenliang, who tried to warn about the destructivity
of coronavirus on the same date and more than 630 fatalities along with more than 30,000 infected
cases were reported worldwide [84][85]. As of 12th February, 2020 the infected cases on the cruise
ship increased around 3 fold and the number was 174 and this cruise ship is considered as the large
cluster of infected patients outside China by the Health experts and compared with “ Floating petri
dish” because it is easier to spread infectious disease in such a confined area[86]. The National
Health Commission of China announced 1,843 deaths and 56,249 confirmed cases in Hubei, China
on 15th February, 2020 [87]. First European fatality of a 80-year-old-man in France was reported
on the same date [88]. 1,933 deaths in Hubei alone and more than 70,000 cases were reported by
Health authorities on 18th February, 2020 [89]. China’s National Health Committee reported on
19th February, 2020 that blood plasma can be extracted from the recovered patients to treat serious
patients [90]. Japan’s Health Ministry announced two deaths of a 87-year-old-man and 84-yearold-woman on the cruise ship on 20th February, 2020 and on the same date South Korea’s first
fatality was reported [91]. The youngest coronavirus infected patient who is under age 10 was
reported in Japan on 21th February, 2020 [92]. As of 22th February, 2020, 2,239 death cases and
75,567 infected cases including 346 infected cases in South Korea were reported to the World
Health Organization (WHO) [93]. World Health Organization (WHO) welcomed the report of
China on 23th February, 2020 saying there was a fall in new death case in mainland China but
concerned with infected cases in other counties as the total infected cases in South Korea stood
433 on the same date [94].

To date, there is no effective antiviral therapies that can combat the Coronavirus infections and
hence the treatments are only supportive. Use of Interferons in combination with Ribavirin is
somewhat effective. However, the effectiveness of combined remedy needs to be further evaluated
[95]. This experiment is carried out to design novel epitope-based vaccine against four proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 i.e., nucleocapsid phosphoprotein which is responsible for genome packaging and
viral assembly [96]; surface glycoprotein that is responsible for membrane fusion event during
viral entry [97][98]; ORF3a protein that is responsible for viral replication, characterized
virulence, viral spreading and infection [99] and membrane glycoprotein which mediates the
interaction of virions with cell receptors [100] using the approaches of reverse vaccinology.
Reverse vaccinology refers to the process of developing vaccines where the novel antigens of a
virus or microorganism or organism are detected by analyzing the genomic and genetic
information of that particular virus or organism. In reverse vaccinology, the tools of bioinformatics
are used for identifying and analyzing these novel antigens. These tools are used to dissect the
genome and genetic makeup of a pathogen for developing a potential vaccine. Reverse
vaccinology approach of vaccine development also allows the scientists to easily understand the
antigenic segments of a virus or pathogen that should be given more emphasis during the vaccine
development. This method is a quick, cheap, efficient, easy and cost-effective way to design
vaccine. Reverse vaccinology has successfully been used for developing vaccines to fight against
many viruses i.e., the Zika virus, Chikungunya virus etc. [101][102].

2. Materials and Methods:
The current experiment was conducted to develop potential vaccines against the Wuhan novel
coronavirus (strain SARS-CoV-2) (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus) exploiting the
strategies of reverse vaccinology (Figure 01).
2.1. Strain Identification and Selection
The strain of the SARS-CoV-2 was selected by reviewing numerous entries of the online database
of National Center for Biotechnology Information or NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
2.2. Retrieval of the Protein Sequences
Four protein sequences i.e., nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43423.2),
membrane glycoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43419.1), ORF3a protein (PubMed
accession no: QHD43417.1) and surface glycoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43416.1) were
downloaded from the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database in fasta format.
2.3. Antigenicity Prediction and Physicochemical Property Analysis of the Protein Sequences
The antigenicity of protein sequences was determined using an online tool called VaxiJen v2.0
(http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm). During the antigenicity prediction,
the prediction accuracy parameter threshold was set at 0.4 in the tumor model [103]-[105]. The
tumor model was used in prediction because it generated excellent results (when compared to other
models) in both the leave-on-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) and external validation in numerous
studies. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of a prediction (by the VaxiJen v2.0 server)
depends on the prediction accuracy threshold. For this reason, to improve the accuracy of the
prediction, the threshold 0.4 was used. The server is a user-friendly web tool for effective

prediction of the antigenicity of proteins [106]-[108]. Only the highly antigenic protein sequences
were selected for further analysis. Next, the selected antigenic protein sequences were analyzed
by ExPASy’s online tool and ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) to determine their
physicochemical properties i.e., the number of amino acids, theoretical pI, extinction co-efficient,
aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) etc. [109].
2.4. Prediction of T-cell and B-cell Epitopes
The online epitope prediction server Immune Epitope Database or IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/)
was used for T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction. The database contains a huge collection of
experimental data on T-cell epitopes and antibodies [110]. The NetMHCpan EL 4.0 prediction
method was used for MHC class-I restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope
prediction (for HLA-A*11-01 allele) and the MHC class-II restricted CD4+ helper T-lymphocyte
(HTL) epitopes were predicted (for HLA DRB1*04-01 allele), using the Sturniolo prediction
method [111]. Ten of the top twenty MHC class-I and MHC class-II epitopes were randomly
selected based on their antigenicity scores (AS). For, the B-cell lymphocytic epitopes (BCL), with
amino acid number of more than ten, were selected for analysis that were predicted using BepiPred
linear epitope prediction method [112] [113].
2.5. Transmembrane Topology, Antigenicity Prediction, Allergenicity and Toxicity
Prediction of the Selected Epitopes
The epitopes selected in the previous step were then subjected to the transmembrane topology
experiment using the transmembrane topology of protein helices determinant, TMHMM v2.0
server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) [114]. The antigenicity of the epitopes were
determined

pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm) server. The threshold was kept at 0.4 in the tumor
model for improving the accuracy of the prediction [106]-[108].
The allergenicity of the selected epitopes were predicted using two online tools i.e., AllerTOP v2.0
(https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/)

and

AllergenFP

v1.0

(http://ddg-

pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/). AllerTOP server generates more accurate results than AllergenFP
server [115] [116]. For this reason, during prediction, the results predicted by AllerTOP were given
much priority. The toxicity prediction of the selected epitopes was carried out using ToxinPred
server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/) using SVM (support vector method) based
method, keeping all the parameters default. The SVM is a machine learning technique which is
used in the server for differentiating the toxic and non-toxic peptides [117]. After the antigenicity,
allergenicity and toxicity tests, the epitopes that were found to be antigenic, non-allergenic and
non-toxic, were considered as the best predicted epitopes and selected for the later phases of the
experiment.
2.6. Cluster Analysis of the MHC Alleles
The cluster analysis of the MHC alleles was carried out to identify the alleles of the MHC class-I
and class-II molecules with similar binding specificities. The cluster analysis of the MHC alleles
were carried out using online tool MHCcluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/)
[118]. During the analysis, all the parameters were kept default and all the HLA supertype
representatives (MHC class-I) as well as the HLA-DR representatives (MHC class-II) were
selected. The NetMHCpan-2.8 prediction method was used for analyzing the MHC class-I alleles.

2.7. Generation of the 3D Structures of the Selected Epitopes
The

3D

structures

of

the

selected

epitopes

were

generated

using

PEP-FOLD3

(http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3/) online tool. Only the best
selected epitopes from previous steps (the epitopes that followed the selection criteria of high
antigenicity, non-allergenicity and non-toxicity in the previous steps, were considered best) were
taken for 3D structure prediction [119]-[121].
2.8. Molecular Docking of the Selected Epitopes
Molecular docking analysis is one of the essential steps in reverse vaccinology to design vaccines.
In this step, peptide-protein docking was performed to predict the binding of epitopes with various
antibodies or the MHC receptors [122]. The molecular docking study of the epitopes were
conducted using PatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server against
HLA-A*11-01 allele (PDB ID: 5WJL) and HLA DRB1*04-01 (PDB ID: 5JLZ). PatchDock tool
is a quick, easy, efficient and effective online docking tool which works on some specific
algorithms. These algorithms divide the connolly dot surface representations of the compounds
into concave, convex and flat patches. Later, possible solutions are predicted from these patches
and RMSD (root mean square deviation) scores are applied to the candidate solutions. Based on
the RMSD scores, the best candidate solutions are determined by the server. After successful
docking by PatchDock, the refinement and re-scoring of the docking results were carried out by
the FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). The FireDock server
generates global energies for the best solutions and the lowest global energy is always considered

2.9. Vaccine Construction

Three possible vaccines were constructed against the selected Wuhan novel coronavirus. The
predicted CTL, HTL and BCL epitopes were joined together by different linkers for vaccine
construction. The vaccines were constructed maintaining the sequence: adjuvant, pan HLA DR
Epitope (PADRE) sequence, CTL epitopes, HTL epitopes and BCL epitopes. Three different
adjuvants i.e., beta defensin, L7/L12 ribosomal protein and HABA protein (Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, accession number: AGV15514.1), were used and the three vaccines differ from each
other by their adjuvant sequence. Beta-defensin adjuvant acts as agonist to stimulate the activation
of the toll like receptors (TLRs) 1, 2 and 4. On the other hand, TLR-4 is activated by the L7/L12
ribosomal protein and HABA protein. Studies have also confirmed that, the PADRE sequence
stimulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response of the vaccines that contain it. During the vaccine
construction, four different linkers: EAAAK, GGGS, GPGPG and KK, were used [128]-[135].
Figure 02 illustrates how the linkers, epitopes, adjuvants and PADRE sequence were used for
vaccine construction, in their appropriate order. The three vaccines differ from each other only in
their adjuvant sequences.

2.10. Antigenicity, Allergenicity and Physicochemical Property Analysis of the Predicted
Vaccines
The antigenicity of the constructed vaccines was predicted by the online server VaxiJen v2.0
(http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm) using the tumor model where the
threshold was set at 0.4. The allergenicity of the predicted vaccines were determined by two online
tools for improving the prediction accuracy i.e., AlgPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/algpred/)
and AllerTop v2.0 (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/). MEME/MAST motif prediction
was used to predict the allergenicity of the vaccines by AlgPred [136]. Later, ProtParam
(https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was used to predict different physicochemical properties of
the predicted vaccines [109].
2.11. Secondary and Tertiary Structure Prediction of the Vaccine Constructs
The secondary structure generation of the vaccine constructs were performed using online server,
PRISPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/), which is a simple and easy secondary structure
generating tool [137][138]. The secondary structures of the vaccine constructs were predicted
using the PRISPRED 4.0 prediction method. Next, another online tool, NetTurnP v1.0
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetTurnP/) was used to predict the β-sheet structure of the
predicted vaccines [139]. The 3D structures of the vaccines were then generated using online
server RaptorX (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) [140]-[142].
2.12. 3D Structure Refinement and Validation
Protein structure refinement is an important step in vaccine design because when protein 3D
structures are predicted by online tools, they may lack the true, native structure. The refinement of
the structures can convert the low resolution predicted model to high resolution predicted model

that closely resembles the native structure of the protein. The 3D structures of the constructed
vaccines

were

refined

using

online

protein

refinement

tool,

3Drefine

(http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/3Drefine/). The tool is a quick and efficient 3D structure refining
tool (works on i3Drefine protocol) since it can refine a 300 amino acid long protein in just 5
minutes [143] [114]. Next, the validation was conducted by analyzing the Ramachandran plots
which were generated using the PROCHECK (https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/)
server [145][146].
2.13. Vaccine Protein Disulfide Engineering
Disulfide bonds are important characteristics of protein because they provide stability to the
proteins. For this reason, to predict the correct disulfide interactions, the vaccine protein disulfide
engineering

was

carried

out

with

the

aid

of

Disulfide

by

Design

2

v12.2

(http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/DbD2/) server which predicts the potential sites within a protein
structure that have higher possibility of undergoing disulfide bond formation [147]. During
disulfide engineering, the intra-chain, inter-chain and Cβ for glycine residue were selected and the
χ3 Angle was kept -87° or +97° ± 5 and Cα-Cβ-Sγ Angle was kept 114.6° ±10. The χ3 angle was set
at -87° or +97° ± 5 because numerous disulfides were generated by the server, when the default
angle (+97° ±30° and -87° ±30°) was used. So, to shorten the amount of disulfides, the χ3 angle
was kept low. Furthermore, studies have estimated that Cα-Cβ-Sγ angle reach a peak of near 115°
and covers a range from 105° to 125°, in known disulfides. For this reason, the Cα-Cβ-Sγ angle was
kept default (114.6° ±10) [148] [149].
2.14. Protein-Protein Docking

In protein-protein docking, the constructed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were analyzed by docking
against some MHC alleles as well as the toll like receptors (TLRs). During viral infections, the
MHC complex recognize the viral particles as potent antigens. Since the different portions of the
MHC molecules are encoded by different MHC alleles, the constructed vaccines should have very
good binding affinity towards these segments of the MHC complex [150]. In this experiment, all
the vaccines constructs were docked against DRB1*0101 (PDB ID: 2FSE), DRB3*0202 (PDB ID:
1A6A), DRB5*0101 (PDB ID: 1H15), DRB3*0101 (PDB ID: 2Q6W), DRB1*0401 (PDB ID:
2SEB), and DRB1*0301 (PDB ID: 3C5J) alleles. Moreover, it has been proved that TLR-8 is
responsible for mediating the immune responses against the RNA viruses and TLR-3 is responsible
for mediating immune responses against the DNA viruses [151][152]. The coronavirus is an RNA
virus [153]. For this reason, the vaccine constructs of Wuhan novel coronavirus were docked
against TLR-8 (PDB ID: 3W3M). The protein-protein docking study was conducted using
different online docking tools to improve the prediction accuracy of the docking study. At first,
the docking was performed by ClusPro 2.0 (https://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php). The server ranks the
docked complexes based on their center scores and lowest energy scores [154]-[156]. The binding
affinity (ΔG in kcal mol-1) of the docked complexes were later analyzed by PRODIGY tool of
HADDOCK webserver (https://haddock.science.uu.nl/). The lower binding energy of the server
represents the higher binding affinity and vice versa [157]-[159]. Next, the docking was again
carried out by PatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server and later
refined and re-scored by FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). The
FireDock server ranks the docked complexes based on their global energy and the lower global
energy represents the better result. Finally, the docking was conducted using HawkDock server
(http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/hawkdock/). At this stage, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born

Surface Area (MM-GBSA) study was also calculated by the HawkDock server which works on
specific algorithm that depicts that, the lower score and lower energy represent the better scores
[160]-[163]. From the docking experiment, one best vaccine was selected based on the docking
score. The docked structures were visualized by PyMol tool [164].

2.15. Molecular Dynamic Simulation
The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study was of the best selected vaccine construct was
carried out using the online MD simulation tool, iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org/). It is a fast,
online, user-friendly and effective molecular dynamics simulation server that predicts the
deformability, B-factor (mobility profiles), eigenvalues, variance, co-variance map and elastic
network of the protein complex. For a protein complex, the stability depends on the ability to
deform at each of its amino acids. The eigenvalue represents the motion stiffness of the protein
complex and the lower eigenvalue represents easy deformability of the complex. The server also
determines and measures the protein flexibility [165]-[169].

2.16. Codon Adaptation and In Silico Cloning
The best predicted vaccine from the previous steps, was reverse transcribed to a possible DNA
sequence which is supposed to express the vaccine protein in a target organism. The cellular
machinery of that particular organism could use the codons of the newly adapted DNA sequence
efficiently for producing the desired vaccine. Codon adaptation is a necessary step of vaccine
design because this step provides the effective prediction of the DNA sequence of a vaccine
construct. An amino acid can be encoded by different codons in different organisms, which is
known as codon bias. Codon adaptation predicts the best codon for a specific amino acid that

should work effectively and efficiently in a specific organism. The best predicted vaccine was used
for codon adaptation by the Java Codon Adaptation Tool or JCat server (http://www.jcat.de/). The
server ensures the maximal expression of protein in a target organism. Eukaryotic E. coli strain
K12 was selected at the JCat server and rho-independent transcription terminators, prokaryotic
ribosome binding sites and SgrA1 and SphI cleavage sites of restriction enzymes, were avoided.
The optimized DNA sequence was then taken and SgrA1 and SphI restriction sites were attached
to the N-terminal and C-terminal sites, respectively. Finally, the SnapGene restriction cloning
module was used to insert the newly adapted DNA sequence between the SgrA1 and SphI
restriction sites of pET-19b vector [170]-[174].

3.2. Antigenicity Prediction and Physicochemical Property Analysis of the Protein Sequences
Two proteins: nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein, were identified as potent
antigens and hence used in the next phases of the experiment (Table 02). The physicochemical
property analysis was conducted for these two selected proteins. Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein had
the highest predicted theoretical pI of 10.07, however, surface glycoprotein had the highest
predicted extinction co-efficient of 148960 M-1 cm-1. Both of them were found to have similar
predicted half-life of 30 hours. However, surface glycoprotein had the highest predicted aliphatic
index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) values among the two proteins (Table 03).
However, numerous in vitro and in vivo researches should be carried out on these predictions to
determine the degree of their accuracy.

3.3. T-cell and B-cell Epitope Prediction and their Antigenicity, Allergenicity and Topology
Determination
The MHC class-I and MHC class-II epitopes, determined for potential vaccine construction. The
IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/) server generates a good number of epitopes. However, based on the
antigenicity scores, ten epitopes were selected from the top twenty epitopes because the epitopes
generated almost similar AS and percentile scores. Later, the epitopes with high antigenicity, nonallergenicity and non-toxicity were selected for vaccine construction. The B-cell epitopes were
also selected based on their antigenicity, non-allergenicity and length (the sequences with more
than 10 amino acids).
Table 04 and Table 05 list the potential T-cell epitopes of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and Table
06 and Table 07 list the potential T-cell epitopes of surface glycoprotein. Table 08 lists the
predicted B-cell epitopes of the two proteins and Table 09 lists the epitopes that followed the
mentioned criteria and were selected for further analysis and vaccine construction.

3.4. Cluster Analysis of the MHC Alleles

The online tool MHCcluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/), was used for the
prediction or cluster analysis of the possible MHC class-I and MHC class-II alleles that may
interact with the selected epitopes during the immune responses. The tool illustrates the
relationship of the clusters of the alleles in phylogenetic manner. Figure 03 depicts the result of
the cluster analysis where the red zone indicates strong interaction and the yellow zone corresponds
to weaker interaction.

3.5. Generation of the 3D Structures of the Epitopes and Peptide-Protein Docking

After 3D structure prediction of the selected epitopes, the peptide-protein docking was conducted
to find out, whether all the epitopes had the ability to bind with the MHC class-I as well as MHC
class-II molecules or not. The HLA-A*11-01 allele (PDB ID: 5WJL) was used as the receptor for
docking with the MHC class-I epitopes and HLA-DRB1*04-01 (PDB ID: 5JLZ) was used as the
receptor for docking with the MHC class-II epitopes. Among the MHC class-I epitopes of
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, QLESKMSGK showed the best result with the lowest global energy
of -53.28. Among the MHC class-II epitopes of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, LIRQGTDYKHWP
generated the lowest and best global energy score of 16.44. GVLTESNKK generated the best
global energy score of -34.60 of the MHC class-I epitopes of surface glycoprotein. Among the
MHC class-II epitopes of surface glycoprotein, TSNFRVQPTESI generated the best global energy
score of -2.28 (Table 10 & Figure 04).

3.7. Vaccine Construction
After successful docking, three vaccines were constructed using the selected epitopes which is
supposed to be directed to fight against the SARS-CoV-2. To construct the vaccines, three different
adjuvants were used i.e., beta defensin, L7/L12 ribosomal protein and HABA protein and different
linkers i.e., EAAAK, GGGS, GPGPG and KK linkers were used at their appropriate positions.
PADRE sequence is an important sequence which was used in vaccine construction. It has the
capability to increase the potency of the vaccines with minimal toxicity. Moreover, PADRE
sequence also improve the CTL response, thus ensuring potent immune response [175]. The newly
constructed vaccines were designated as: CV-1, CV-2 and CV-3 (Table 11).

3.9. Secondary and Tertiary Structure Prediction of the Vaccine Constructs

From the secondary structure analysis, it was determined that, the CV-1 had the highest percentage
of the amino acids (67.1%) in the coil formation as well as the highest percentage of amino acids
(8%) in the beta-strand formation. However, CV-3 had the highest percentage of 37.8% of amino
acids in the alpha-helix formation (Figure 05 and Table 13). CV-1 and CV-2 vaccines had 02
domains, whereas, CV-3 had only one domain. CV-2 had the lowest p-value of 6.35e-05. The pvalue represents the relative quality of a protein model. The smaller p-value refers to higher quality
of the protein model and vice-verse [176]. For this reason, CV-2 showed the best performance in
the 3D structure generation experiment. Moreover, three different templates were used for
generating3D structures of the three different vaccines. The RaptorX server used the templates for
generating the 3D structures of the query vaccine constructs [177]. The results of the 3D structure
analysis are listed in Table 14 and illustrated in Figure 06.

3.10. 3D Structure Refinement and Validation
The three vaccine constructs were refined and then validated in the 3D structure refinement and
validation step. The PROCHECK server (https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/) divides
the Ramachandran plot into four regions: the most favored region (represented by red color), the
additional allowed region (represented by yellow color), the generously allowed region
(represented by light yellow color) and the disallowed region (represented by white color).
According to the server, a valid protein (the best quality protein) should have over 90% of its
amino acids in the most favored region. The additional allowed region and generously allowed
region might also contain some percentage of the amino acids of the protein. Moreover, no amino
acid should reside in the disallowed region [178]-[180].
The 3D protein structures generated in the previous step were refined for further analysis and
validation. The refined structures were refined with the aid of the Ramachandran Plots. The
analysis showed that CV-1 vaccine had excellent percentage of 94.3% of the amino acids in the
most favored region, 4.4% of the amino acids in the additional allowed regions, 0.0% of the amino
acids in the generously allowed regions and 1.3% of the amino acids in the disallowed regions.
The CV-2 vaccine had 90.0% of the amino acids in the most favored regions, 8.3% of the amino
acids in the additional allowed regions, 0.6% of the amino acids in the generously allowed regions
and 1.1% of the amino acids in the disallowed regions. The CV-3 vaccine showed the worst result
with 77.4% of the amino acids in the most favored regions, 20.9% of the amino acids in the
additional allowed regions, 1.4% of the amino acids in the generously allowed regions and 0.3%
of the amino acids in the disallowed regions (Figure 07).

3.11. Vaccine Protein Disulfide Engineering
In protein disulfide engineering, disulfide bonds were generated within the 3D structures of the
vaccine constructs. In the experiment, the amino acid pairs that had bond energy value less than
2.00 kcal/mol were selected. Since about 90% of the native disulfide bonds in proteins have energy
value of less than 2.2 kcal/mol, the bond energy value of 2.00 kcal/mol was selected as the cut-off
value for the experiment for better prediction [181]. The CV-1 generated 10 amino acid pairs that
had the capability to form disulfide bonds. However, only one pair was selected because they had
the bond energy, less than 2.00 kcal/mol: 276 Ser-311 Arg. However, CV-2 and CV-3 generated
04 and 05 pairs of amino acids, respectively, that might form disulfide bonds and no pair of amino

3.12. Protein-Protein Docking Study
The protein-protein docking study was carried out to find out the best constructed COVID-19
vaccine. The vaccine construct with the best result in the molecular docking, was considered as
the best vaccine construct. According to docking results, it was found that CV-1 was the best
constructed vaccine. CV-1 showed the best and lowest scores in the docking as well as in the MMGBSA study. However, CV-2 showed the best binding affinity (ΔG scores) with DRB3*0202 (18.9 kcal/mol) and DRB1*0301 (-18.5 kcal/mol) when analyzed with ClusPro 2.0 and the
PRODIGY tool of HADDOCK server. Moreover, when analyzed with PatchDock and FireDock
servers, CV-3 showed best global energy scores with most of the MHC alleles i.e., DRB5*0101 (10.70), DRB5*0101 (-19.59), DRB1*0101 (-17.46) and DRB3*0101 (-12.32). Since CV-1
showed the best results in the protein-protein docking study, it was considered as the best vaccine
construct among the three constructed vaccines (Figure 09 & Table 15). Later, the molecular
dynamics simulation study and in silico codon adaptation studies were conducted only on the CV1 vaccine.

3.13. Molecular Dynamics Simulation
The results of molecular dynamics simulation of CV-1-TLR-8 docked complex is illustrated in
Figure 10. Dynamic simulation of proteins gives easy determination of the stability and physical
movements of their atoms and molecules [182]. So, the simulation is carried out to determine the
relative stability of the vaccine protein. The deformability graph of the complex illustrates the
peaks representing the regions of the protein with moderate degree of deformability (Figure 10b).
The B-factor graph of the complex gives easy visualization and comparison between the NMA
and the PDB field of the docked complex (Figure 10c). The eigenvalue of the docked complex is
depicted in Figure 10d. CV-1 and TLR8 docked complex generated quite good eigenvalue of
3.817339e-06. The variance graph illustrates the individual variance by red colored bars and
cumulative variance by green colored bars (Figure 10e). Figure 10f depicts the co-variance map
of the complex, where red color represents the correlated motion between a pair of residues,
uncorrelated motion is indicated by white color as well as the anti-correlated motion is marked by
blue color. The elastic map of the complex refers to the connection between the atoms and darker
gray regions indicate stiffer regions (Figure 09g) [167]-[169].
3.14. Codon Adaptation and In Silico Cloning
Since the CV-1 protein had 596 amino acids, after reverse translation, the number nucleotides of
the probable DNA sequence of CV-1 would be 1788. The codon adaptation index (CAI) value of
1.0 of CV-1 indicated that the DNA sequences contained higher proportion of the codons that
should be used by the cellular machinery of the target organism E. coli strain K12 (codon bias).
For this reason, the production of the CV-1 vaccine should be carried out efficiently [183][184].
The GC content of the improved sequence was 51.34% (Figure 11). The predicted DNA sequence
of CV-1 was inserted into the pET-19b vector plasmid between the SgrAI and SphI restriction sites

and since the DNA sequence did not have restriction sites for SgrAI and SphI restriction enzymes,
SgrA1 and SphI restriction sites were conjugated at the N-terminal and C-terminal sites,
respectively. The newly constructed vector is illustrated in Figure 12.

4. Discussion
The current study was designed to construct possible vaccines against the Wuhan Novel
Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of the recent outbreak of the deadly viral
disease, COVID-19 in China. The pneumonia has already caused the death of several thousands
of people worldwide. For this reason, possible vaccines were predicted in this study to fight against
this lethal virus. To carry out the vaccine construction, four candidate proteins of the virus were
identified and selected from the NCBI database. Only highly antigenic sequences were selected
for further analysis since the highly antigenic proteins can induce better immunogenic response
[185, 201]. Because the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein were found to be
antigenic, they were taken into consideration for vaccine construction.
The physicochemical property analysis was conducted for the two predicted antigenic proteins.
The extinction coefficient can be defined as the amount of light that is absorbed by a particular
compound at a certain wavelength [186][187]. Surface glycoprotein had the highest predicted
extinction co-efficient of 148960 M-1 cm-1. The aliphatic index of a protein corresponds to the
relative volume occupied by the aliphatic amino acids in the side chains of the protein, for example:
alanine, valine etc. [188][189]. Surface glycoprotein also had the highest predicted aliphatic index
among the two proteins (84.67). For this reason, surface glycoprotein had greater amount of
aliphatic amino acids in its side chain than the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The grand average
of hydropathicity value (GRAVY) for a protein is calculated as the sum of hydropathy values of
all the amino acids of the protein, divided by the number of residues in its sequence [190]. Surface
glycoprotein had the highest predicted GRAVY value of -0.079 among the two proteins. However,
both of them had the predicted in vivo half-life of 30 hours and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein had

the highest theoretical pI of 10.07. Both the proteins showed quite good results in the
physicochemical property analysis.

After the physicochemical analysis of the protein sequences, the T-cell and B-cell epitope
prediction was conducted. T-cell and B-cell are the two main types of cells that function in
immunity. When an antigen is encountered in the body by the immune system, the antigen
presenting cells or APC like macrophage, dendritic cell etc. present the antigen to the T-helper
cell, through the MHC class-II molecules on their surface. The helper T-cell contains CD4+
molecule on its surface, for this reason, it is also known as CD4+ T-cell. On the other hand, other
type of T-cell, cytotoxic T-cell contains CD8+ molecule on their surface, for which, they are called
CD8+ T-cell. MHC class-I molecules present antigens to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. After
activation by the antigen, the T-helper cell activates the B-cell, which starts to produce large
amount of antibodies. Macrophage and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell are also activated by the T-helper
cell that cause the final destruction of the target antigen [191]-[195]. The possible T-cell and Bcell epitopes of the selected proteins were determined by the IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/) server.
The epitopes with high antigenicity, non-allergenicity and non-toxicity were selected to vaccine
construction. The B-cell epitopes (predicted by the server) that were more than ten amino acids
long were taken into consideration and the antigenic and non-allergenic epitopes were selected for
vaccine construction. However, most of the epitopes were found to be residing within the cell
membrane.
The cluster analysis of the MHC alleles which may interact with the selected epitopes during the
immune response, showed quite good interaction with each other. Next the 3D structures of the
selected epitopes were generated for peptide-protein docking study. The docking was carried out

to find out whether all the epitopes had the capability to bind with their respective MHC class-I
and MHC class-II alleles. Since all the epitopes generated quite good docking scores, it can be
concluded that, all of them had the capability to bind with their respective targets and induce
potential immune response. However, among the selected epitopes, QLESKMSGK,
LIRQGTDYKHWP, GVLTESNKK and TSNFRVQPTESI generated the best docking scores.
After the successful docking study, the vaccine construction was performed. The linkers were used
to connect the T-cell and B-cell epitopes among themselves and also with the adjuvant sequences
as well as the PADRE sequence. The vaccines, with three different adjuvants, were constructed
and designated as: CV-1, CV-2 and CV-3. Since all the three vaccines were found to be antigenic,
they should be able to induce good immune response. Moreover, all of them were possibly nonallergenic, they should not be able to cause any allergenic reaction within the body as per in silico
prediction. With the highest aliphatic index of 54.97, CV-3 had the highest predicted number of
aliphatic amino acids in its side chain. The highest theoretical pI of CV-1 indicated that it requires
high pH to reach the isoelectric point. Quite similar results of extinction co-efficient were
generated by the three vaccine constructs. The three vaccine construct showed quite good and
similar results in the physicochemical property analysis.
The secondary structure of the vaccine constructs determined that CV-1 had the shortest alphahelix formation, with 25% of the amino acids in the alpha-helix formation, however, 67.1% of the
amino acids in coil formation. For this reason, most of the amino acid acids of CV-1 vaccine was
predicted to be in coil structure, which was also the highest percentage of amino acids in coil
structure among the three vaccines. On the other hand, CV-3 had the highest amount of amino
acids in the alpha-helix formation (37.8%), according to the prediction by the study. However, all
the three vaccine constructs had most of their amino acids in their coil structures. In the tertiary

structure prediction, all the three vaccine construction showed quite satisfactory results. In the
tertiary structure refinement and validation, CV-1 vaccine construct generated the best result with
94.3% of the amino acids in the most favored region and 4.4% of the amino acids in the additional
allowed regions. CV-2 also showed good result 90.0% of the amino acids in the most favoured
region. In the disulfide bond engineering experiment, only CV-1 was found to follow the selection
criteria for disulfide bond formation. With the lowest and best results generated by the MM-GBSA
study, HawkDock server and ClusPro 2.0 server, CV-1 was considered as the best vaccine
construct among the three vaccines. For this reason, CV-1 was selected for molecular dynamics
simulation study, codon adaptation and in silico coding study. The molecular dynamics simulation
study was conducted by the online tool iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org/) revealed that the
TLR-8-CV-1 docked complex should be quite stable with a good eigenvalue of 3.817339e-06. The
complex had less chance of deformation and for this reason, the complex should be quite stable in
the biological environment. The Figure 10f shows that a good number of amino acids were in the
correlated motion that were marked by red color. Finally, codon adaptation and in silico cloning
experiments were performed and with the predicted CAI value of 1.0, it could be concluded that
the DNA sequence should have very high amount of favorable codons that should be able to
express the desired amino acids in the target microorganism, E. coli strain K12. The DNA sequence
also had quite high and good amount of GC content of 51.34%. Finally, the pET-19b vector,
containing the CV-1 vaccine insert was constructed which should efficiently and effectively
encode the vaccine protein in the E. coli cells.
The vaccine development using genome based technologies provides scientists the opportunity to
develop vaccines by optimizing the target antigens. Conventional vaccines, like the attenuated
vaccines or the inactivated vaccines sometimes fail to provide potential immunity towards a target

antigen. Moreover, the conventional approach of vaccine development have raised many safety
concerns in many pre-clinical and clinical trials. The subunit vaccines like the vaccines predicted
in the study could overcome such difficulties [196]-[200]. Finally, this study recommends CV-1
as the best vaccine to be an effective worldwide treatment based on the strategies employed in the
study to be triggered against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further in vivo and in vitro
experiments are suggested to strengthen the findings of this study.

5. Conclusion
The SARS-CoV-2 has caused one of the deadliest outbreaks in the recent times. Prevention of the
newly emerging infection is very challenging as well as mandatory. The potentiality of in silico
methods can be exploited to find desired solutions with fewer trials and errors and thus saving both
time and costs of the scientists. In this study, potential subunit vaccines were designed against the
SARS-CoV-2 using various methods of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design
the vaccines, the highly antigenic viral proteins as well as epitopes were used. Various
computational studies of the suggested vaccine constructs revealed that these vaccines might
confer good immunogenic response. For this reason, if satisfactory results are achieved in various
in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggested vaccine constructs might be used effectively
for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infection and spreading. Therefore, our present study
should help the scientists to develop potential vaccines and therapeutics against the Wuhan Novel
Coronavirus 2019.
