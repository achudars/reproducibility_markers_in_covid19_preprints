Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented
number of genomic sequences of the causative virus (SARS-CoV2) have been generated and shared with the scientific community. The unparalleled volume of available genetic data presents
a unique opportunity to gain real-time insights into the virus
transmission during the pandemic, but also a daunting computational hurdle if analysed with gold-standard phylogeographic
approaches. We here describe and apply an analytical pipeline
that is a compromise between fast and rigorous analytical steps.
As a proof of concept, we focus on the Belgium epidemic, with one
of the highest spatial density of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
At the global scale, our analyses confirm the importance of external introduction events in establishing multiple transmission
chains in the country. At the country scale, our spatially-explicit
phylogeographic analyses highlight that the national lockdown
had a relatively low impact on both the lineage dispersal velocity and the long-distance dispersal events within Belgium. Our
pipeline has the potential to be quickly applied to other countries
or regions, with key benefits in complementing epidemiological
analyses in assessing the impact of intervention measures or their
progressive easement.

To tackle this practical limitation, we here describe and apply
an analytical pipeline that is a compromise between fast and rigorous
analytical steps. In practice, we propose to take advantage of the
rapid time-scaled phylogenetic tree inference process used by the
online Nextstrain platform10 . Specifically, we aim to use the resulting
time-scaled tree as a fixed empirical tree along which we infer
the ancestral locations with the discrete12 and spatially-explicit13
phylogeographic models implemented in the software package
BEAST 1.1014 .

In Belgium, there are two main different laboratories (from the University of Leuven and the University of Liège) involved in sequencing
SARS-CoV-2 genomes extracted from confirmed COVID-19 positive
patients. To date, some genomes (n=58) have also been sequenced at
the University of Ghent, but for which metadata about the geographic
origin are unavailable. As of June 10, 2020, a total of 740 genomes
have been sequenced by these research teams and deposited on the
GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data15 ) database.
In the present study, we exploit this comprehensive data set to unravel
the dispersal history and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral lineages in
Belgium. In particular, our objective is to investigate the evolution
of the circulation dynamics through time and assess the impact of

the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and overall 80% highest posterior density (HPD) regions reflecting the uncertainty related to the phylogeographic
inference. MCC trees and 80% HPD regions are based on 1,000 trees subsampled from each post burn-in posterior distribution. MCC tree nodes were coloured
according to their time of occurrence, and 80% HPD regions were computed for successive time layers and then superimposed using the same colour scale
reflecting time. Continuous phylogeographic reconstructions were only performed along Belgian clades linking at least three sampled sequences for which
the geographic origin was known (see the Methods section for further details). Besides the phylogenetic branches of MCC trees obtained by continuous
phylogeographic inference, we also mapped sampled sequences belonging to clades linking less than three geo-referenced sequences. Furthermore, when a
clade only gathers two geo-referenced sequences, we highlighted the phylogenetic link between these two sequences with a dashed curve connecting them.

Figure 3. Evolution of viral lineage dispersal dynamics during the Belgian epidemic. These estimates are based on 1,000 trees subsampled from each post
burn-in posterior distribution. Except the number of phylogenetic branches occurring at each time slice, all estimates were smoothed using a 14-days sliding
window. Dark grey surrounding polygons represent 95% credible intervals, and light grey surrounding polygons represent 95% credible intervals re-estimated
after subsampling 75% of branches in each of the 1,000 posterior trees. The credible interval based on the subsampling procedure is an indication of the
robustness of the estimate. In addition, we also report the number of phylogenetic branches occurring per tree at each time slice (blue curve). The number of
branches available at each time slice is an additional, yet qualitative, indication of robustness of the estimate for a given time period.

spatially-explicit reconstruction can be a valuable tool for highlighting
specific patterns related to the circulation of the virus or assessing
the impact of intervention measures. While new viral genomes are
sequenced and released daily, a limitation could paradoxically arise
from the non-accessibility of associated metadata. Indeed, without
sufficiently precise data about the geographic origin of each genome,
it is not feasible to perform a spatially-explicit phylogeographic inference. In the same way that viral genomes are deposited in databases
like GISAID, metadata should also be made available to enable comprehensive epidemiological investigations with a similar approach as
we presented here.

Preliminary discrete phylogeographic analysis. We performed a preliminary phylogeographic analysis using the discrete diffusion model12 implemented in the software package BEAST 1.1014 . The objective of this first
analysis was to identify independent introduction events of SARS-CoV-2 lineages into Belgium. To this end, we used our time-scaled phylogenetic tree
as a fixed empirical tree and only considered two possible ancestral locations:
Belgium and non-Belgium. Bayesian inference through Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) was run on this empirical tree for 106 generations and sampled
every 1,000 generations. MCMC convergence and mixing properties were
inspected using the program Tracer 1.726 to ensure that effective sample size
(ESS) values associated with estimated parameters were all >200. After having discarded 10% of sampled trees as burn-in, a maximum clade credibility
(MCC) tree was obtained using TreeAnnotator 1.1014 . We used the resulting
MCC tree to delineate Belgian clusters here defined as phylogenetic clades
corresponding to independent introduction events in Belgium.

METHODS

Continuous and post hoc phylogeographic analyses. We used the continuous diffusion model13 available in BEAST 1.1014 to perform a spatially-explicit
(or “continuous”) phylogeographic reconstruction of the dispersal history of
SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Belgium. We employed a relaxed random walk
(RRW) diffusion model to generate a posterior distribution of trees whose internal nodes are associated with geographic coordinates13 . Specifically, we used
a Cauchy distribution to model the among-branch heterogeneity in diffusion
velocity. We performed a distinct continuous phylogeographic reconstruction for each Belgian clade identified by the initial discrete phylogeographic
inference, again fixing a time-scaled subtree as an empirical tree. As phylogeographic inference under the continuous diffusion model does not allow
identical sampling coordinates assigned to the tips of the tree, we avoided
assigning sampling coordinates using the centroid point of each administrative
area of origin. For a given sampled sequence, we instead retrieved geographic
coordinates from a point randomly sampled within its municipality of origin,
which is the maximal level of spatial precision in available metadata. This
approach avoids using the common “jitter” option that adds a restricted amount
of noise to duplicated sampling coordinates. Using such a jitter could be
problematic because it can move sampling coordinates to administrative areas
neighbouring their actual administrative area of origin27 . Furthermore, the
administrative areas considered here are municipalities and are rather small
(there are currently 581 municipalities in Belgium). The clade-specific continuous phylogeographic reconstructions were only based on Belgian tip nodes
for which the municipality of origin was known, i.e. 639 out of 740 genomic
sequences. Furthermore, we only performed a continuous phylogeographic
inference for Belgian clades linking a minimum of three tip nodes with a
known sampling location (municipality).
Each Markov chain was run for 106 generations and sampled every 1,000
generations. As with the discrete phylogeographic inference, MCMC convergence/mixing properties were assessed with Tracer, and MCC trees (one per
clade) were obtained with TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% of sampled trees
as burn-in. We then used functions available in the R package “seraphim”28, 29
to extract spatiotemporal information embedded within the same 1,000 posterior trees and visualise the continuous phylogeographic reconstructions. We
also used “seraphim” to estimate the following weighted lineage dispersal
velocity, and we verified the robustness of our estimates through a subsampling
procedure consisting of re-computing the weighted dispersal velocity after
having randomly discarded 25% of branches in each of the 1,000 posterior
trees. The weighted lineage dispersal velocity is defined as follows, where di
and ti are the geographic distance travelled (great-circle distance in km) and
the time elapsed (in days) on each phylogeny branch, respectively:

SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in Belgium. At the University of Leuven, RNA
extracts from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were selected anonymously and
based on a city?s postal code within Belgium. These RNA extracts were
provided by the National Reference Center for Coronaviruses and UZ Leuven.
Reverse transcription was carried out via SuperScript IV and cDNA was posteriorly amplified using Q5 R High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) with the ARTIC nCov-2019 primers and following the recommendations in the sequencing
protocol of the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network/ncov-2019).
Samples were multiplexed following the manufacturer’s recommendations
using the Oxford Nanopore Native Barcoding Expansion kits NBD104 (1-12)
and NBD114 (13-24), in conjunction with Ligation Sequencing Kit 109 (Oxford Nanopore). Sequencing was carried out on a MinION sequencer using
R9.4.1 flow cells and MinKNOW 2.0 software.
At the University of Liège, RNA was extracted from clinical samples (300µl)
via a Maxwell 48 device using the Maxwell RSC Viral TNA kit (Promega)
with a viral inactivation step using Proteinase K, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA elution occurred in 50µl of RNAse free water. Reverse
transcription was carried out via SuperScript IV VILOTM Master Mix, and
3.3µl of the eluted RNA was combined with 1.2µl of master mix and 1.5µl of
H2 O. This was incubated at 25◦ C for 10 min, 50◦ C for 10 min and 85◦ C for
5 min. PCR used Q5 R High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB), the primers
and conditions followed the recommendations in the sequencing protocol of
the ARTIC Network. Samples were multiplexed following the manufacturer’s
recommendations using the Oxford Nanopore Native Barcoding Expansion
kits 1-12 and 13-24, in conjunction with Ligation Sequencing Kit 109 (Oxford
Nanopore). Sequencing was carried out on a Minion using R9.4.1 flow cells.
Data analysis followed the SARS-CoV-2 bioinformatics protocol of the ARTIC
Network.
Inference of a time-scaled phylogenetic tree. To infer our time-scaled phylogenetic tree, we selected all non-Belgian sequences in the Nextstrain analysis,
along with all available Belgian sequences in GISAID to be included in our
analysis as of June 10, 2020. Once we knew which were the accessions of
interest, we downloaded the latest whole genome alignment from GISAID and
removed all non-relevant sequences. We then cleaned the alignment by manually trimming the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (RefSeq NC_045512.2) and
gap-only sites. To obtain a maximum-likelihood phylogeny, we ran IQ-TREE
2.0.322 under a general time reversible23 (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with empirical base frequencies and four Free Rate24 site categories. This
model configuration was selected as the best GTR model using IQ-TREE?s
ModelFinder tool. The tree was then inspected for outlier sequences using
TempEst25 1.5.3 and, once the outliers were removed, time-calibrated using
TreeTime 0.7.420. To replicate the Nextstrain workflow as closely as possible,
we specified a clock rate of 8x10-4 in TreeTime and removed samples that
deviate more than four interquartile ranges from the root-to-tip regression.
