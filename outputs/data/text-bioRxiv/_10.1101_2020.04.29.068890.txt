Abstract
In December 2019, the first cases of a novel coronavirus infection causing COVID-19 were
diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Viral Papain-Like cysteine protease (PLpro, NSP3) is essential
for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents a promising target for the development of antiviral
drugs. Here, we used a combinatorial substrate library containing natural and a wide variety of
nonproteinogenic amino acids and performed comprehensive activity profiling of SARS-CoV2-PLpro. On the scaffold of best hits from positional scanning we designed optimal fluorogenic
substrates and irreversible inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity for SARS PLpro variants
versus other proteases. We determined crystal structures of two of these inhibitors (VIR250
and VIR251) in complex with SARS-CoV-2-PLpro which reveals their inhibitory mechanisms
and provides a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles. Lastly, we
demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-PLpro harbors deISGylating activities similar to SARS-CoV-1PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is diminished, which our sequence and
structure analysis provides a basis for. Altogether this work has revealed the molecular rules
governing PLpro substrate specificity and provides a framework for development of inhibitors
with potential therapeutic value or drug repositioning.

Introduction
The global epidemic of three coronaviruses have emerged in this century so far. In
November 2002 in Foshan, China, the first known case of human infected with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been reported (1). By July 2003, more than
8,000 SARS cases were detected in 27 countries. The main symptoms of SARS-CoV infection
were influenza-like and included fever, headache, malaise, shivering and diarrhea. Only a few
cases of infection occurred between December 2003 and January 2004 (2). The
implementation of measures infection control has ended the global SARS outbreak. Ten years
after the SARS pandemic a new coronavirus – Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) was diagnosed in Saudi Arabia man (3). Due to international travels of infected
people, MERS-CoV has spread worldwide. 2502 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV
infection were reported from September 2012 to the end of December 2019, including 858
associated deaths. In December 2019 a novel coronavirus - severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) was identified in Wuhan, China (4, 5). Current studies indicate that this coronavirus is
similar to SARS-CoV. Although these three coronaviruses - SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2 are identified as a highly pathogenic into the human population, there is no
effective antiviral treatment. Therefore, current studies are focused on rapid development of
vaccines and antiviral drugs to prevent and treat coronavirus infection.
One of the attractive antiviral drug targets is the SARS-CoV encoded cysteine protease
– papain-like protease (PLpro) (6). This enzyme recognizes the tetrapeptide LXGG motif found
in-between viral proteins nsp1 and nsp2, nsp2 and nsp3, and nsp3 and nsp4 (nsp1/2, nsp2/3,
nsp3/4) (7, 8). The hydrolysis of the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of glycine at the P1
position leads to the release of nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 proteins, which are essential for viral
replication. The in vitro studies have shown that SARS-CoV-PLpro harbors two other
proteolytic activities, removal of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 (interferoninduced gene 15) from cellular proteins (9-11). Ubiquitinated and ISGylated substrates are
more efficiently hydrolyzed by SARS-CoV-PLpro than small substrates containing C-terminal
LRGG motif (11, 12). These results indicated a more complex mechanism of substrate
recognition than only the interaction of S4-S1 pockets of enzyme with tetrapeptide fragment.
Further studies revealed that SARS-CoV-PLpro possess two distinct Ub binding subsites
(SUb1 and SUb2) and recognize Lys48-linked polyUb chains for polyubiquitin chain editing
and/or deubiquitination of polyubiquitinated proteins (13-15).
Due to the deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of SARS-CoV PLpro, this enzyme
performs significant role in the innate immune response during viral infection (16, 17). SARSCoV-PLpro is involved in inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemokines, that are

responsible for the activation of the host innate immune response against viral infection (1820). For these reasons, this enzyme is an important molecular target in the design of SARSCoV antiviral drugs. Despite substantial research efforts in the development of SARS-CoV
inhibitors, efficacy data of these compounds from clinical trials are missing (21-23).
Nevertheless, we hypothesize that information gained over past years for the SARS-CoVPLpro could be immediately translated into the timely study of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro to
accelerate new antivirals development and drug retargeting approaches. The optimal method
to check level of similarity in binding site architecture between two enzymes is positional
scanning

technology. We have

recently

developed a

novel chemical approach,

called HyCoSuL (Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate Library), to dissect a broad substrate
specificity of proteolytic enzymes (24). Application of this approach SARS-CoV-2-PLpro
facilitated the development of irreversible inhibitors (VIR250 and VIR251) harboring a high
degree of selectivity for SARS PLpro variants versus other proteases. Crystal structures of
VIR250 and VIR251 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-PLpro reveal their inhibitory mechanisms
and provide a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles. We also examined
processing of Ub and Ubl by SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and found that it harbors deISGylating
activities similar to SARS-CoV-1-PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is
significantly diminished. Altogether this work has revealed the molecular rules governing PLpro
substrate specificity, provides a framework for development of inhibitors with potential
therapeutic value or drug repositioning, and reveals intriguing differences in the biochemical
functions of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 PLpro that may contribute to differences in their biology.
Results
Substrate specificity profile
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro recognizes the tetrapeptide LXGG motif found in-between viral
proteins nsp1 and nsp2, nsp2 and nsp3, and nsp3 and nsp4 (Figure 1A) (7, 8). Hydrolysis of
the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of glycine at the P1 position leads to the release of nsp1,
nsp2, and nsp3 proteins, which are essential for viral replication. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro also
harbors deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities and recognizes the conserved LRGG motif
at the C-terminus of these proteins. (Figure 1A). Our previous studies of SARS-CoV-1 PLpro
substrate preferences using a combinatorial substrate library containing only natural amino
acids revealed that this protease recognizes LXGG motif at P4-P1 positions with broad
substrate specificity at P3 position (25). These results suggest that more detailed mapping of
binding pocket architecture should facilitate design of new, active substrates as well as optimal
peptide sequences for inhibitor development efforts. To achieve this goal we developed a
defined and combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) containing wide variety of
nonproteinogenic amino acids (24). Since tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates are not very
efficiently hydrolyzed by enzymes exhibiting deubiquitinating activity, we designed and

synthesized the P2 defined library with a general structure of Ac-LRXG-ACC (X – 19 natural
and 109 unnatural amino acids) and a hybrid combinatorial substrate library, where three
positions were fixed and one position contains an equimolar mixture of 19 amino acids (Mix),
(P3 sublibrary: Ac-Mix-P3-Gly-Gly-ACC, P4 sublibrary: Ac-P4-Mix-Gly-Gly-ACC; P3 and P4 –
a natural or unnatural amino acid) (26). By design of libraries with tailored peptide scaffold
toward DUBs we could reach the highest possible concentration of individual fluorogenic
substrates in each sublibrary during the assay.

P2 library screening revealed that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro possess very
high substrate specificity at this position – only glycine can be accepted (Supplementary Figure
1). Both proteases exhibit a broad substrate preference at P3 position (Figure 1B). The S3
pocket of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro can tolerate not only positively charged
residues like Phe(guan), Dap, Dab, Arg, Lys, Orn, and hArg, but also hydrophobic amino acids,
such as hTyr, Phe(F5), Cha, Met, Met(O), Met(O)2, D-hPhe (amino acid structures presented

in Table S1 supplemental information). These enzymes do not recognize acidic residues and
most D-amino acids (the exception are D-Arg, D-hPhe, D-Lys, and D-Phg). The S4 pocket of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro can accommodate hydrophobic residues only, among
natural amino acids, practically only leucine can be tolerated (being the best hit for SARS-CoV2-PLpro) (Figure 1B). SARS-CoV-PLpro recognized two unnatural residues better than leucine
at P4 position (hTyr and hTyr(Me)). Other bulky amino acids are also accepted (≥ 30%, hPhe,
Abu(Bth), Phe(3-I), Cys(Bzl), Cys(MeBzl), Cys(4-MeOBzl), hSer(Bzl), and Dht) (Figure 1B).
Design and kinetic analysis of tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates
To validate the library-screening data we designed optimal tetrapeptide fluorogenic
substrates to find optimal sequences recognized by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. We
analyzed both SARS PLpro substrate specificity profile at the P4-P2 positions and selected
the most preferred amino acids (P2: Gly; P3: Dap, Phe(guan); P4: hTyr, hPhe, and Abu(Bth))
(Figure 1E). Kinetic analysis revealed that some designed substrates were better recognized
by SARS-CoV-1 PLpro with Ac-hTyr-Dap-Gly-Gly-ACC being almost 2.5 times more efficiently
cleaved than endogenous Ac-LRGG-ACC. In case of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro, we did not find
significant difference between Ac-LRGG-ACC and all tested substrates (Figure 1C). It is
important to notice that substitution of Arg in P3 position by relatively small Dap did not affect
binding to S3 pocket and yields very good substrates (Figure 1C). Thus, data obtained from
combinatorial screening very well translate into individual substrates and demonstrate very
high level of similarity between two investigated enzymes.
Next, we wanted to see if incorporation of unnatural amino acids in P4 and P3 positions
of peptide sequence can result in selective tetrapeptide substrates. We tested the substrates
with four enzymes that exhibit deubiquitinating activity – SARS-CoV-PLpro, SARS-CoV-2PLpro, MERS-CoV-PLpro and human DUB UCH-L3. We have found that none of the
substrates with unnatural amino acids in the sequence were significantly recognized at 10µM
either by MERS-CoV-2 PLpro (2.5 µM) nor human DUB UCH-L3 (8 µM) (Figure 1D). In line
with previous data, Ac-LRGG-ACC was recognized by all four enzymes (Figure 1D).
Development of PLpro inhibitors
To further analyze selectivity of peptide sequences with unnatural amino acids we
converted two substrates (Ac-hTyr-Dap-Gly-Gly-ACC and Ac-Abu(Bth)-Dap-Gly-Gly-ACC)
into inhibitors by exchanging the fluorescent tag to a reactive group – vinylmethyl ester (VME).
VME group was selected due to its broad reactivity toward DUBs (inhibitor selectivity is
determined by tetrapeptide sequence). The results from kinetic analysis of SARS-CoV-PLpro
and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro inhibitors reflected those of substrate hydrolysis (Figure 2A, B).

Ac-hTyr-Dap-Gly-Gly-VME (hereafter referred to as VIR251) was more potent but less
selective inhibitor toward these enzymes than Ac-Abu(Bth)-Dap-Gly-Gly-VME (hereafter
referred to as VIR250). Importantly, both compounds exhibit high selectivity for SARS-PLpro
variants and robustly inhibit both SARS-CoV-PLpro, SARS-CoV-2-PLpro activities. In contrast,
practically no inhibition of human UCH-L3 and only a slight inhibition of MERS-PLpro was
observed (Figure 2A, B). Further, incubation of HeLa lysates with Ub-VME yields a crosslinking
profile that is unaltered by titrations of VIR250 or VIR251 (Figure 2C). Since a major crosslinking target of Ub-VME is known to be human DUB enzymes, this data suggests that VIR250

and VIR251 do not cross-react with human DUBs. This is an important finding in search for a
selective antiviral molecule with minimal cross-reactivity with human DUBs.
Structures of CoV-2-PLpro in complex with VIR250 and VIR251
We next set out to determine crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro in complex with
VIR250 and VIR251 in order to gain insights into the molecular mechanism by which these
molecules inhibit SARS-CoV-2-PLpro activity as well as the basis for the observed substrate
selectivity profile. Catalytic cysteine 111 of CoV-2-PLpro engages in Michael Addition to the bcarbon of the vinyl group of the VME warheads of VIR250 and VIR251, resulting in formation
of a covalent thioether linkage (Figure 2D). Large-scale cross-linking reactions yielded CoV-2PLpro-VIR250 and CoV-2 PLpro-VIR251 complexes of yield and purity sufficient for growth of
diffraction quality crystals. The structure of CoV-2-PLpro in complex with VIR250 (Figure 2E)
was determined by molecular replacement using the recently determined structure of apo CoV2 PLpro (PDB: 6W9C) and was resolved to 2.79 Å resolution with R/Rfree values of 0.230/0.195
(Table S2). This structure was used as the molecular replacement search model for
determination of the structure of CoV-2-PLpro in complex with VIR251 (Figure 2F). The CoV2 PLpro/VIR251 structure was resolved to 1.65 Å resolution and refined to R/Rfree values of
0.196/0.170 (Table S2).
Comparison of apo CoV-2-PLpro to CoV-2-PLpro/VIR250 and CoV-2-PLpro/VIR251
complexes reveal similar overall structures with the exception of the b14- b15 loop which is
situated proximal to the active site and undergoes a conformational change in that is likely due
to inhibitor binding (Supplementary Figure 2) (see below). This analysis shows that there are
also slight rigid body rotations of the finger and ubiquitin-like domains of CoV-2-PLpro which
are likely due to crystal packing effects. Analysis of the structures reveal extensive electron
density projecting from the caytalytic Cys111 side chain of CoV-2-PLpro into which all the
atoms of VIR250 and VIR251 could unambiguously be placed (Figures 2E, F). Further, the
covalent bond between Cys111 and both VIR250 and VIR251 are clear (Figures 2E, F). As
anticipated, both VIR250 and VIR251 inhibitors occupy the S4-S1 pockets of CoV-2-PLpro in
proximity to the active site and adopt similar structures with the exception of the orientation of
the P4 substituents which will be discussed in greater detail below. The P4 position is the only
region of chemical divergence between VIR250 and VIR251, with an Abu(Bth) in VIR250 and
an h-Tyr in VIR251 (Figures 2A, B).

Molecular recognition of VIR250 and VIR251
Analysis of the CoV-2-PLpro/VIR250 and CoV-2-PLpro/VIR251 complexes reveals a
similar network of interacting residues with ~560 Å2 from a total of ~775 Å2 solvent accessible

area of VIR251 and ~600 Å2 from a total of ~800 Å2 solvent accessible area of VIR250 buried
upon complex formation. With the exception of the P4 positions of VIR250 and VIR251, which
engage largely in hydrophobic interactions with CoV-2-PLpro, the majority of interactions at
the P1-P3 positions of both inhibitors are mediated through polar interactions and hydrogen
bonds (Figures 3A, B). At the P1 position of VIR250, GlyVME is covalently linked via thioether
bond to catalytic Cys111 of CoV-2-PLpro and engages in a backbone-backbone hydrogen
bond to Gly271 (Figure 3A). At the P2 VIR250 position, Gly engages in two backbonebackbone hydrogen bonds to Gly163 and van der Waals contacts to Leu163 and Tyr164 of
CoV-2-PLpro and P3 Dap of VIR250 participates in a backbone-backbone hydrogen bond with
Gly271 (Figure 3A). The network of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds participated in at the
P3-P1 positions of VIR250 are fully conserved in VIR251 (Figure 3B). In contrast, while the
methylester group from the GlyVME warhead of VIR250 engages in a hydrogen bond with
His272 from the catalytic triad of CoV-2-PLpro, the corresponding methylester of VIR251
participates in hydrogen bonds with Trp106 and Asn109 side chains, which are proposed to
contribute to oxyanion hole stabilization (Figures 3A, B). Trp106 adopts a different
conformation and is poorly ordered in the VIR250 complex (Figure 3A).
Intriguingly, there are significant differences in how the side chains of the P3 and P4
positions of VIR250 and VIR251 engage CoV-2-PLpro. The side chain amine of Dap at the P3
position of VIR250 engages in a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr268
and the P4 Abu(Bth) projects toward Met208, Pro247, Pro248, and Thr301 where it engages
in a network of van der Waals interactions (Figure 3A). In contrast, it is the backbone amine of
P3 Dap that engages in the hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr268, and surprisingly,
hTyr at the P4 position projects towards the opposite side of the S4 pocket compared to
Abu(Bth) from VIR250 by extending towards Pro248, Tyr264, and Tyr268 of CoV-2-PLpro and
participating in a distinct network of van der Waals interactions (Figure 3B). This new network
of interactions is facilitated by a 1.5 Å shift of the b14-b15 loop (Asn267, Tyr268, and Gln269)
towards the hTyr of VIR251 (Figure 3C) thereby facilitating many novel contacts which would
be unable to occur in the absence of this shift. Notably, all of the CoV-2-PLpro residues
involved in contacts to both VIR250 and VIR251 are fully conserved in SARS CoV-1-PLpro,
and the overall structures of the two SARS PLpro variants are very similar in the catalytic site
of the enzyme which likely accounts for the ability of these inhibitors to target both enzymes
(Figure 3C, 4G).

In terms of how our structures correlate with the observed substrate selectivity profiles
described above, P2 dependence on Gly is the result of residues from the b14-b15 and a5-a6
loops of CoV-2-PLpro (notably Leu162, Tyr 264, Cys270, Gly271, and Tyr273) clamping down
on top of the P2 position leaving no room for side chain atoms at the R position (Figures 3AC). The preference for positive and hydrophobic residues and selection against acidic residues
at the P3 position is likely the result of its broader pocket and proximity to the acidic carbonyl
oxygens of Tyr268, Gln269, and Leu162, the side chain of Asp164, as well as the hydrophobic
side chains of Leu162 and Tyr268 (Figures 3A-C). At the P4 position the strong preference for
bulky hydrophobic residues can be explained by the hydrophobic nature of the P4 binding
pocket that is largely formed by residues Met208 Pro247, Pro248, Tyr264, and Tyr268 (Figures
3A, B). Notably, the very deep and broad nature of the S4 pocket of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro has
been exploited by the Abu(Bth) and h-Tyr sidechains at P4 of VIR250 and VIR251, which as
noted above project towards different ends of the S4 pocket and engage in distinct networks
of contacts (Figure 3C). With that said there remain regions at the deepest parts of this pocket,

particularly an acidic patch formed by Asp164, Tyr273, and Thr301 that could potentially be
exploited for development of more potent inhibitors.
Processing of Ub and Ubl variants by CoV-1 and CoV-2-PLpro
Studies carried out for SARS-CoV-1 PLpro revealed that this enzyme has ubiquitin
binding domain and efficiently process full ubiquitin fluorogenic substrates (12). We wanted to
see if this is also the case for SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. To that end, we used ubiquitin activitybased probe (ABP) for labeling of both enzymes. In this ABP, biotin was used as detection tag
and VME as an irreversible warhead that cross-links to the catalytic cysteines. To test its
sensitivity, we performed SDS-PAGE analysis followed by nitrocellulose membrane transfer
and visualization with fluorescent streptavidin (Figure 4A). We observed significant labeling of
both proteases by Biotin-Ub-VME at a concentration twice higher than the enzyme
concentration (200 nM), however SARS-CoV-1 PLpro was more efficiently labeled compared
to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. We next decided to explore the Ub and Ub-like protein (Ubl) substrate
specificity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro by testing its reactivity with a panel of Ub/Ubl ABPs. This
panel of probes includes K48-linked diUb and K63-linked diUb with propargylamide (PA)
warheads at their distal ends, mono Ub-PA, and ISG15 C-terminal domain (CTD)- vinyl
pentynyl sulfone (VPS). The results of this analysis indicated a preference of SARS-CoV-2
PLpro for recognition of ISG15 and monoUb and a poor ability to recognize K48-linked and
K63-linked diUb (Figure 4B). As expected, preincubation of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with VIR251
completely blocked its ability to react with all of the probes (Figure 4B). The apparent lack of
reactivity with the K48-linked diUb-PA probe and the increased processing of ISG15CTD-VPS
relative to monoUb-PA was surprising since SARS-CoV-2 PLpro has been demonstrated to
robustly process K48-linked polyUb chains and a preference for Ub over ISG15 (27, 28).
To more thoroughly examine these differences, we performed a comparison of the
kinetics of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 PLpro processing of LRGG-ACC, Ub-ACC, and ISG15AMC fluorogenic substrates. The results of this experiment show that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
processes Ub-ACC 4-fold less efficiently compared to SARS-CoV-1 PLpro and that SARSCoV-2 PLpro processes ISG15-AMC 60-fold more efficiently than Ub-ACC (Figure 4C).
Further, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, like SARS-CoV-1 PLpro, more robustly processes K48 tetraUb
compared to K63 tetraUb (Figure 4D), and cross-links to the ABP Ub-VS similarly to SARSCoV-1 PLpro, MERS PLpro, and the human DUB USP2CD (Figure 4E). Yet, in side-by-side
comparison, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro demonstrates a significantly diminished ability to process
K48 tetraUb compared to SARS-CoV-1 PLpro (Figure 4F). This was an unexpected finding as
we and others have shown before that SARS-CoV-1 PLpro displays a preference for
recognition of K48 diUb linkages over ISG15 (27, 28). As expected and shown before, both
MERS PLpro and USP2CD efficiently processes both types of Ub chains.

The significantly diminished ability of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro to process K48 polyUb
chains compared to SARS-CoV-1 PLpro was surprising considering the very high overall
similarity between the enzymes (83% identity, 9% similarity) (Figure 3D). To try to reconcile
this apparent contradiction, we compared our SARS-CoV-2 PLpro structures with the
previously reported structure of SARS-CoV-1-PLpro in complex with K48 diUb (Figure 4G)
(28). This structure revealed three key interfaces: 1) the catalytic site that accommodates the
C-terminus of Ub with L73, R74, G75, and G76 constituting the S4-S1 residues, 2) a binding
site for the ‘S1 Ub’ which is the Ub N-terminal to the cleavage site in the K48 polyUb chain,
and 3) a binding site for the ‘S2 Ub’ which is N-terminal to the S1 Ub (Figure 4G). Comparative
analysis of the catalytic sites of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 PLpro shows a 100% conservation of
residues involved in contacts to the S4-S1 positions of S1 Ub, VIR250, and VIR251 (Figure

3D) and unsurprisingly a very similar structure in this region (Figure 4G). While the Ub S1 site
harbors more variability than the catalytic site the overall amino acid conservation is still very
high (83% identity, 17% similarity) (Figure 3D) and the structures align well in this region
(Figure 4G).
In contrast to the catalytic and S1 Ub sites, the S2 Ub site of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
harbors much less conservation at the amino acid level (67% identity, 13% similarity)
compared to SARS-CoV-1 PLpro (Figure 3D), and there are several structural differences at
these regions important for molecular recognition of the S2 Ub (Figure 4G). A key interaction
surface at this interface is formed by the Ile44 hydrophobic patch (formed by Leu8, Ile44, and
Val70), and in the SARS-CoV-1 PLpro/K48 diUb structure the Ile44 patch of the S2 Ub
engages in a network of hydrophobic contacts with Leu75 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, this
residue has changed to a threonine in SARS-CoV-2 which would be unable to engage in a
similar network of contacts with S2 Ub as leucine. Further, much of the SARS-CoV-2 structure
in proximity to the S2 Ub site adopts a slightly different structure including a ~3 Å translation
of Thr75 of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro relative to Leu75 of SARS-CoV-1 PLpro and other notable
amino acid changes of S66V and E77P (Figure 4G). Lastly, Glu179 of SARS-CoV-1 PLpro
engages in hydrogen bonds to Thr9 and Lys11 of S2 Ub (Figure 4G). This residue has changed
to an aspartate in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, which is a conservative change, but the shorter
aspartate side chain is unable to engage in a similar set of contacts (Figure 4G). Based on our
analysis, we posit that the diminished ability of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro to process K48 polyUb is
largely due to the aforementioned differences at the S2 Ub binding site. Consistent with this
hypothesis, mutation of Leu75 of SARS-CoV-1 PLpro to serine resulted in a five-fold reduction
in binding of K48 diUb with no apparent effect on monoUb (27). In combination with other
changes in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro such as E179D, there appears to be a cumulative effect of
several relatively minor changes between SARS-CoV-1 and 2 PLpro at the S2 binding site that
altogether have a significant effect on their ability to process K48 polyUb. Whether these
changes also account for the apparent preference of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro for ISG15 over Ub
and whether these intriguing differences in the function of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 PLpro have any
effect on the biology of the viruses remains to be seen.
Discussion and Conclusions
The outbreak of the current coronavirus pandemic leading to COVID-19 disease has
dramatically accelerated research into effective drugs and a vaccine to treat this disease. The
genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consists of 29811
nucleotides that encode 29 proteins, two of which are proteases. The first of these, SARSCoV-2-Mpro is used by the virus in the process of protein maturation. Its structure has already
been described recently (29). The results of retargeting about 12,000 drugs and other leading

structures resulted in selection of several candidates for further studies (30). To date, there is
no information about the activity of the second protease, namely SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. We were
hypothesizing that this enzyme, similarly to SARS-CoV-PLpro, in addition to participating in
the process of virus protein maturation, also performs an additional function, which is to help
the virus in evasion of the host innate immune responses by controlling the deubiquitination
and deISGylation process. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-PLpro is also an excellent candidate for a drug,
not only blocking virus replication, but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades
in infected cells (9). Knowledge of substrate preferences is equally important with
understanding the structure of the protein, as it enables rational design of inhibitors or research
on drug retargeting.
In our research, we decided to examine the SARS-CoV-2-PLpro substrate preferences at
positions P4-P2 and compare them directly with the well-known SARS virus 2002/03 protein,
SARS-CoV-PLpro. For this purpose, we used positional scanning technology using natural and
unnatural amino acids (HyCoSuL). Library screening revealed that both enzymes recognize
only Gly in P2 and possess broad in P3 and rather narrow substrate specificity at the P4
position. Moreover, direct analysis of the preferences of both enzymes demonstrate that the
architecture of S4-S2 pockets is almost identical, because they recognize natural and
unnatural amino acids practically in a very similar way. The differences in activity for a given
amino acid between the two enzymes observed in some positions are very small, and there
are no amino acids that are recognized by one enzyme only. This is also confirmed by the
analysis of amino acids building S4-S2 pockets in both enzymes, which is identical (Figure 1B
and S1). This is critically important information in the aspect of using information from research
on inhibitors or retargeting of drugs conducted in the past for SARS-CoV-PLpro for immediate
application to SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. Analysis of kinetic parameters for tetrapeptide substrates
for both enzymes shows a high degree of similarity in terms of kcat/Km values, proving that the
catalytic yields of both enzymes are also similar. Importantly, the sequences containing
unnatural amino acids at P4-P3 positions were recognized only by both SARS-PLpro, not
MERS-PLpro and the human DUB UCH-L3.
We next leveraged the information we gained regarding the molecular rules governing
substrate selectivity by SARS-CoV-2-PLpro to develop covalent inhibitors VIR250 and VIR251.
These inhibitors proved to be active and selectively inhibited the SARS-CoV-1 and 2 PLpro,
but exhibited much weaker activity towards MERS-PLpro and practically no activity towards
human UCH-L3. This is excellent information in terms of conducting research towards the
search for peptide antiviral compounds targeted to this enzyme. Importantly, our crystal
structures of VIR250 and VIR251 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-PLpro reveals their inhibitory
mechanisms and provides a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles.

Further, the unexpected finding that the P4 amino acids of VIR250 and VIR251 occupy
opposite sides of the broad S4 pocket of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and that there are additional
regions of this pocket that are unengaged by either inhibitor raise the possibility that our
structures will inform future drug discovery efforts aimed at generating more potent inhibitors.
Lastly, we decided to examine processing of Ub and Ubl variants by SARS-CoV-1 and
2 PLpro and found that SARS-CoV-2-PLpro harbors deISGylating activities similar to SARSCoV-1-PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is significantly diminished. This
was an unexpected result considering the very high sequence identity between SARS-CoV-1
and 2 PLpro, however our structure analysis revealed subtle structural and sequence
variations in the S2 Ub binding site of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro which we posit collectively diminish
the ability of the S2 Ub of K48 polyUb to bind and subsequently be processed. Further, analysis
of the enzyme kinetics of the Ub-ACC substrate indicates that it is efficiently processed by the
enzyme, but the difference between the tetrapeptide substrate and ubiquitin is only about ten
times, when in the case of SARS-CoV-1 PLpro this difference is around sixty times (Figure
4C). This indicates some differences between both enzymes in the aspect of interaction in the
exosite binding region related to amino acids identity and similarity. Given the role of Ub and
ISG15 conjugation in evasion of the host innate immune responses whether these intriguing
differences in the function of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 PLpro have any effect on the biology of the
viruses remains to be seen and will be the topic of future studies.
Collectively our work has revealed the molecular rules governing PLpro substrate
specificity and reveals a very high level of sequence and structural similarity between SARSCoV-1 and 2 PLpro in the substrate binding pocket. These findings signal that previously
discovered information on SARS-CoV-1 PLpro can immediately be applied to the search for
effective antiviral molecules as well as retargeting of known drugs for the inhibition of SARSCoV-2 PLpro. Further, structures of the novel inhibitors VIR250 and VIR251 in complex with
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro provides a framework for rational development of inhibitors with improved
potency. Altogether, our data also gives a hope for design of a drug that can act as a panselective inhibitor against both SARS-CoV-PLpro and SARS-CoV-2-PLpro, and may have
some universal value against emerging coronaviruses in the near future.
