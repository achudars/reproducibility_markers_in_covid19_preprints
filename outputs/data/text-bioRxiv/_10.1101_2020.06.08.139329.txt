Abstract
Most patients with COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), display neurological symptoms, and respiratory failure in certain cases could be of extrapulmonary origin. Hypothalamic neural circuits play key roles in sex differences, diabetes,
hypertension, obesity and aging, all risk factors for severe COVID-19, besides being connected to
olfactory/gustative and brainstem cardiorespiratory centers. Here, human brain gene-expression
analyses and immunohistochemistry reveal that the hypothalamus and associated regions express
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane proteinase, serine 2, which mediate SARSCoV-2 cellular entry, in correlation with genes or pathways involved in physiological functions or viral
pathogenesis. A post-mortem patient brain shows viral invasion and replication in both the olfactory
bulb and the hypothalamus, while animal studies indicate that sex hormones and metabolic diseases
influence this susceptibility.

Main text
SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasingly associated with a wide range of neurological symptoms –
headaches, dizziness, nausea, loss of consciousness, seizures, encephalitis etc., as well as anosmia or
ageusia – in the majority of patients (1, 2). Additionally, many COVID-19 patients with severe disease
do not respond well to artificial ventilation or display "silent hypoxia" (3), suggesting an extrapulmonary component to respiratory dysfunction, and cardiorespiratory function and fluid
homeostasis are themselves subject to central nervous system (CNS) control. However, despite
emerging reports of the post-mortem detection of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (see for
example (4)) or brain parenchyma of patients (5), little is known about how and under what
circumstances SARS-CoV-2 infects the brain.
While the possibility of CNS infection has been largely underestimated due to the common view that
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the only confirmed cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 so far
(6), is absent or expressed only at very low levels in the brain (7, 8), and that too exclusively in
vascular cells (He et al., bioRxiv 2020; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.088500) the majority
of these studies have focused on the cerebral cortex, ignoring the fact that other regions such as the
hypothalamus, are rich in ACE2 (9). Intriguingly, most major risk factors for severe COVID-19 (male
sex, age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes); reviewed by (10, 11); could be mediated by normal or
dysfunctional hypothalamic neural networks that regulate a variety of physiological processes: sexual
differentiation and gonadal hormone production, energy homeostasis, fluid
homeostasis/osmoregulation and even ageing (12-14). The hypothalamus is also directly linked to
other parts of the CNS involved in functions affected in COVID-19 patients, including brainstem nuclei
that control fluid homeostasis, cardiac function and respiration, as well as regions implicated in the
perception or integration of odor and taste (12, 14-18).
Here, we investigated the susceptibility of the hypothalamus and related brain regions to SARS-CoV-2
infection by analyzing the expression of ACE2 and the transmembrane proteinase, serine 2
(TMPRSS2), which cleaves the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, enabling it to be internalized, from
existing data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) (19). We also used network analysis and
pathway enrichment tools to determine which genes and pathways were correlated with this

susceptibility, and whether they were similar to differentially expressed genes in the respiratory
epithelium of COVID-19 patients (20). Next, we verified our hypothesis by immunolabeling for ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and other genes of interest in the hypothalamus of control human subjects and the
olfactory regions of human embryos, as well as for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein
and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the brain of a patient deceased after severe COVID-19. Finally,
we verified whether these cellular and molecular mechanisms of susceptibility could be validated in
animal models and whether they were altered by metabolic disorders or variations in sex hormones.
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the human hypothalamus and connected brain regions
The AHBA contains microarray gene expression data for >62,000 gene probes, including ACE2 and
TMPRSS2. We used the atlas to first investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in a number of
hypothalamic nuclei and connected regions involved in regulating olfaction, gustation or
cardiorespiratory function: the insula, amygdala, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, pons and
myelencephalon (Fig. 1a). The frontal lobe, cerebellar cortex and choroid plexus were included for
comparison. The OBs and some brainstem regions were not represented in the AHBA. Normalized
log2 expression levels of both genes varied widely across and within the brain regions studied (Fig.
1b, Suppl. Table 1, Suppl. Movie). As expected from previous studies (21) (He et al., bioRxiv, 2020;
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.088500), ACE2 expression levels in the cerebral and cerebellar
cortex were relatively low, while the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) displayed the
highest ACE2 levels among hypothalamic nuclei, in keeping with its role in fluid homeostasis (22).
Surprisingly, the choroid plexus displayed extremely high ACE2 levels. TMPRSS2 was present in all
areas studied, at levels higher than those of ACE2 on the whole. Relatively high levels of both ACE2
and TMPRSS2 were found in a number of regions, including the PVH and several brainstem areas,
indicating that they could be potential targets of SARS-CoV-2.
Genes correlated with ACE2/TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in key brain structures
We next identified genes whose expression was positively or negatively correlated with ACE2 or
TMPRSS2, using their normalized log2intensity gene expression values and the Find Correlates option
in the AHBA, for 5 regions of interest – the insula, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the parabrachial
nucleus in the pons, and the myelencephalon (Fig. 1c). The paraventricular thalamic nucleus,
sampled in only three brains in the AHBA, and the pontine tegmentum and basal pons, in which the
diversity and number of regions yielded results that were hard to interpret, were excluded from
further analysis. However, the parabrachial nucleus of the pons, which was comparable to the
diencephalic and telencephalic regions analyzed and key to the functions studied here, was retained.
Out of several thousand genes whose expression was correlated with ACE2 or TMRPSS2 in the 5
regions (Fig. 1d,e), we identified 2786 with a Pearson's coefficient (r value) between -0.3 and 0.3, a p
value of < 0.01 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 0.25 for ACE2, and 5369 for TMPRSS2, in the
hypothalamus alone (Suppl. Table 2); 1985 were correlated with both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, making
them possible candidates of interest for infectious mechanisms or host cell response. In order to
draw parallels between SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory epithelium and a putative brain
infection, we cross-checked our genes against those differentially expressed in the lungs of COVID-19
patients as compared to healthy individuals (20). A total of 140 genes were both correlated with
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the hypothalamus and differentially expressed in COVID-19 patient

lungs (Fig. 1f, Suppl. Table 3). A further 62 and 329 genes, respectively, were correlated with only
ACE2 or only TMPRSS2.
ACE2/TMPRSS2-correlated genes are involved in functional networks of interest
To explore the possible role of ACE2- or TMPRSS2-correlated genes in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we
then performed enrichment analyses on them for KEGG pathways using the Clusterprofiler package
in R. The KEGG pathway database, which is manually curated, can be used to identify genes known to
be implicated in a number of molecular processes and networks. Pathway enrichment and selection
yielded a number of important functions and interactions among the ACE2- or TMPRSS2-correlated
genes for each brain region analyzed (Fig. 1g,h). For ACE2, enrichment in the myelencephalon and
pons revealed a very large number of KEGG pathways with few significantly correlated genes,
perhaps due to the diverse peripheral inputs they integrate. For this reason, only pathways with a q
value of < 0.05 are shown (Fig. 1g). In contrast, the insula yielded 2 enriched pathways, and the
amygdala 4. The pathways with the most correlated genes, both localized in the hypothalamus, were
for "olfactory transduction" (due to a very large number of OR olfactory receptor genes) and
"neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction", in keeping with the variety of neuropeptides and
neurotransmitters produced by hypothalamic networks.
KEGG pathway enrichment of TMPRSS2-correlated genes (Fig. 1h) revealed very few pathways in the
same q value range used for ACE2. We therefore applied an exploratory cutoff of q < 0.25, which is
justified for the identification of likely patterns rather than any single significantly correlated
pathway. Under these conditions, enrichment revealed a lower number of pathways in the
hypothalamus, myelencephalon and pons, but a higher number in the insula and amygdala. Here too,
the largest pathways were in the hypothalamus, for "neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction" and
"olfactory transduction", suggesting that these two pathways could be of unusual importance and
providing support for our focus on anosmia and neuroendocrine function in SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis. Other common enriched pathways between ACE2- and TMPRSS2-correlated genes
were those for "taste transduction", "cAMP signaling", "Cushing syndrome" and "hematopoietic cell
lineage". However the latter two were not enriched in the hypothalamus with regard to TMPRSS2correlated genes. While this is not in itself an indication that the corresponding genes are not
involved in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or pathogenesis, we chose not to analyze them further at
present.
We additionally performed enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms (Suppl. Table 4,5).
Functionally connected brain regions express common ACE2- and TMPRSS2-correlated genes and
pathways
While, pathway enrichment identifies likely functional links by pinpointing groups of genes that are
jointly correlated, the relationship between pathways and individual genes that might connect them
or that are similarly correlated in several functionally linked areas could also be informative. We
therefore built gene networks based on the pathways identified above for ACE2- (Suppl. Fig. 1-5) and
TMPRSS2-correlated genes (Suppl. Fig. 6-10) in each of the 5 regions. Next, we analyzed the four
pathways identified above: "neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction" (Fig. 2a,b), "olfactory
transduction" (Fig. 2c,d), "taste transduction" (Fig. 2e,f) and "cAMP signaling" (Fig. 2g,h). For each of
these networks, a number of ACE2- and/or TMPRSS2-correlated genes were also expressed as part of

the same or linked pathways across multiple brain areas, suggesting their involvement in common
physiological functions or signaling mechanisms involving ACE2 or TMPRSS2. In addition, both among
these common genes and those only present in a single region, we found several, with different
functions, whose expression was also altered in the infected lung (20), suggesting that they could be
involved in susceptibility or response to the virus (Table 1). Intriguingly, this list revealed a gene that
was highly correlated with both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the hypothalamus and also present in other
areas: the formyl peptide receptor FPR2 (also known as ALX or FPRL1), a molecule that is closely
related to vomeronasal receptors (23) but principally acts in immune cells to detect pathogenic
peptides and modulate inflammation (24).
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are present in human hypothalamic neurons and tanycytes and olfactory
sensory neurons
To verify the relevance of our gene expression and network analysis results to human COVID-19
patients, we used available antibodies to perform immunolabeling for ACE2 (Suppl. Fig. 11),
TMPRSS2 as well as FPR2 on sections of control adult human brains and fetal heads. ACE2
immunoreactivity in the control adult brain was mostly weak, despite tyramide amplification (see
Methods). In the PVH parenchyma, ACE2 was present in cells with a neuronal morphology, where it
was colocalized with FPR2, as well as a few capillary walls (Fig. 3a). Some FPR2-positive fibers or cell
bodies, possibly glial, were visible close to the ventricular wall, but were not always colabeled for
vimentin (Fig. 3b), a marker in the hypothalamus for specialized ependymoglial cells called tanycytes.
More ventrally, at the level of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) and median eminence
(ME), a circumventricular organ (CVO) at which the traditional blood-brain barrier has been replaced
by a fenestrated endothelium and a barrier consisting of tanycytes, light ACE2 labeling was seen in a
few tanycytic processes radiating from their cell bodies in the ventricular wall (Fig. 3c). ACE2 in these
processes colocalized with TMPRSS2, suggesting that the machinery for SARS-CoV-2 infection is
present in tanycytes. Some capillary walls were also positive for ACE2 as expected, as were some
cells with a neuronal morphology (Fig. 3c). TMPRSS2 was strongly colocalized with vimentin-positive
tanycytic processes in the ME/ARH at both the ventricular wall and the pial surface (Fig. 3d,e).
In order to investigate a putative olfactory route of infection, given the absence of OB data in the
AHBA, we performed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 labeling in whole head sections of human fetuses at
gestational week (GW) 11 (Fig. 3f) or 14 (Fig. 3i). Both ACE2 (Fig. 3g) and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3h) were
strongly colocalized along TAG-1 (or contactin 2, CNTN2)-immunoreactive olfactory/vomeronasal
axons, which start targeting the OBs at these developmental stages. Notably, at GW11, all cells in the
olfactory epithelium (OE) were positive for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3g,h), and both proteins were
strongly expressed in the developing OB (Fig. 3g,h). At GW14, when the neuronal layer of the OE and
the embryonic vomeronasal organ (VNO) was further developed, strong ACE2 and TMPRSS2
immunolabeling was observed in the apical layer of both the OE and the VNO, in addition to the
olfactory nerve (ON), most likely corresponding to olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons,
respectively (Fig. 3j,k,l). FPR2 was not present and is not known to occur in the nose, despite its
homology to vomeronasal receptors.

We obtained the brain of a 63 year-old obese male patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at
hospitalization, and who died after 33 days in the ICU after severe respiratory distress, complications
and multi-organ failure. We observed strong ACE2 labeling around blood vessels, and both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 labeling in the outer layer of the patient's OB (Fig. 4a, bottom panels) but not in a control
brain from a 36 year-old overweight male patient negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4a, top panels).
Immunolabeling for olfactory marker protein (OMP) confirmed that this layer (ONL) is where the
olfactory nerve, consisting of fibers from olfactory sensory neurons, enters the OB (Fig. 4c).
Interestingly, these fibers were also highly immunopositive for the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (Fig. 4a,
bottom panels), and immunolabeling revealed dsRNA from replicating viruses in numerous cells
bordering the ONL and within the glomerular layer (Fig. 4c), indicating viral entry into the brain
through olfactory sensory neuronal fibers from the nose. FPR2 was also found at high levels in the
ONL in the patient but not the control brain (Fig. 4b), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection itself
increases the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FPR2 in olfactory sensory neurons, potentiating
infection.
ACE2 was strongly expressed in the choroid plexus of the COVID-19 patient, where we also found
strong labeling for the highly conserved SARS-CoV nucleocapsid N-protein in what appeared to be
blood vessels (Fig. 4d).
In the ME/ARH of the COVID-19 patient hypothalamus, abundant labeling for both N-protein and
dsRNA could be observed in a large number of cells (Fig. 4e, right panel, f), indicating robust viral
infection and replication. Neither viral marker was seen in the hypothalamus of controls (Fig. 4e, left
panel). However, while diffuse N-protein labeling in the COVID-19 patient was colocalized with
vimentin-positive tanycytic fibers in many cases, dsRNA was not present in the cell bodies of
tanycytes, which line the wall of the third ventricle (Fig. 4e, right panel, f). Some parenchymal cells
showed high levels of both markers with N-protein aggregation, perhaps indicative of viral assembly.
Interestingly, in the ME/ARH, S-protein, present on the outer envelope of assembled viruses, was
observed at extremely high levels in the endfeet of vimentin-positive tanycytes at the pial surface of
the ME (Fig. 4i,j), where it was colocalized both with ACE2 (Fig. 4i) and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 4j), suggesting
that SARS-CoV-2 from the circulation was being internalized by tanycytic endfeet at the level of the
fenestrated capillaries, but subsequently transferred to other cell types. In the ventromedial
hypothalamus (VMH), however, S-protein was also found in numerous fibers and capillaries close to
the ventricular wall, most of which also expressed ACE2; these included some vimentin-positive
tanycytes that extended processes into the parenchyma (Fig. 4g). In addition, some vimentinnegative cells with a neuron-like morphology in the parenchyma of the VMH (Fig. 4g) and cells with
an astrocytic morphology in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) (Fig. 4h) also expressed both ACE2
and S-protein. The widespread and strong expression of ACE2 in the hypothalamus of the SARS-CoV2 infected patient, unlike the weak expression seen in the control brain, was reminiscent of the
increase in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 seen in the ONL of the patient. As for FPR2, at the level of the
ME/ARH, it was present both in some vimentin- and TMPRSS2-coexpressing tanycytic processes and
in non-vimentin-labeled glial cells that could be microglia, close to the ventricular wall (Fig. 4k). More
dorsally, it was strongly expressed and colocalized with TMPRSS2 in some cells with an astrocytic
morphology in the patient's PVH (Fig. 4l).

To validate our gene and protein expression data in animal models in which to explore viral
susceptibility and pathogenesis, we next performed immunofluorescence labeling for ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and FPR2 in brain sections from male hamsters, a model susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection even without genetic modification due to its higher homology with human ACE2 than mice
(25). Using the same antibodies to human ACE2 that we used in the human brain sections, we found
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the processes of a large number of vimentin-positive tanycytes, both in the
ME/ARH and more dorsally, spanning the hypothalamic parenchyma from their cell bodies lining the
third ventricle to the external surface, where their endfeet contact the capillary bed (Fig. 5a). This
again underscores the fact that tanycytes could provide an entry mechanism for the virus into the
brain.
Despite the usefulness of the hamster as a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathophysiological
mechanisms, such as risk factors, are easier to elucidate and validate in mice due to the wealth of
literature. We therefore next evaluated the effect on ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FPR2 of a standard or highfat diet (HFD), which induces obesity and diabetes, and the effect of the gonadal steroid estrogen in
mice.
In the brain of mice fed standard chow, we first validated an antibody to mouse ACE2.
Immunofluorescence using this antibody in most parts of the adult mouse brain appeared to be
limited to cells of the capillary walls – pericytes or endothelial cells (Fig. 5b) – as previously described
(21) (He et al., bioRxiv, 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.088500). However, in the choroid
plexus, where ACE2 levels were among the highest in the human brain (Fig. 1b), ACE2 appeared to be
present as an apical cap (Fig. 5c), confirming our observations in the patient choroid plexus (Fig 4d).
In contrast, in the PVH of standard-chow-fed male mice (Fig. 5d, left panels), ACE2 appeared present
in scattered neurons in addition to vascular cells, as seen in the human brain. Intriguingly, however,
in the ME of male (Fig. 5e, left panels) and female mice (Fig. 5f, left panels), in addition to vascular
cells, tanycytic cell bodies and processes showed the most labeling. TMPRSS2 labeling was found
predominantly in tanycytes in the ARH and ME, but was also found in astrocyte-like cells at the
ventricular wall adjacent to the PVH and some microglia-like cells in the PVH parenchyma (Fig. 5d,e,f,
left panels). The pars tuberalis, a highly vascularized zone under the ME, was also strongly ACE2positive (Fig. 5f, asterisk top panel). Surprisingly, FPR2 was highly expressed in cells with an
astrocytic morphology along the ventricular wall at the PVH, where it sometimes colocalized with
TMPRSS2, and in both tanycytes and microglia-like cells in the ARH and ME (Fig. 5d,e,g).
Next, we examined the same three markers in male mice given a HFD for 9 weeks to induce obesity
(Fig. 5d,e, right panels) and in ovariectomized (OVX) female mice (Fig. 5f, right panels). Strikingly, in
the male HFD mice, ACE2 was strongly upregulated in vascular cells in the ARH, while at the same
time, ACE2 immunolabeling was reduced in the cell bodies of ME/ARH tanycytes and completely
abolished in their processes (Fig. 5e, right panels). However, apical labeling like that seen in the
choroid plexus could be seen in tanycytes in the dorsal ARH, while the pars tuberalis was less strongly
labeled (Fig. 5e, right panels). ACE2 also increased in the PVH with HFD (Fig. 5d, right panels), while
TMPRSS2 increased more moderately with HFD in both the microglia-like cells of the PVH and
tanycytic cell bodies in the ME/ARH (Fig. 5d,e, right panels). Importantly OVX female mice displayed
the same changes in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 immunolabeling as male HFD mice, in both tanycytes and
vascular wall cells (Fig. 5f). On the other hand, the number and spatial extent of FPR2-positive
astrocyte-like cells in the PVH and tanycytes in the ARH and ME dramatically increased in HFD mice;

in addition, there was an increase in microglia-like FPR2 labeling in the latter, in keeping with HFDinduced inflammation (Fig. 5d,e, right panels) (26). However, these observations were not evident or
were even reversed in OVX females (Fig. 5f, right panels), indicating that metabolic and gonadal
hormone-mediated changes may involve pathways or regulatory mechanisms that overlap only
partially.
Finally, given the diversity of these results, we used fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) to
sort cells from the ME of mice expressing tdTomato selectively in tanycytes (27) (Fig. 5h), and
performed RTqPCR for ACE2, TMPRSS2, FPR2 and the tanycytic marker vimentin. While ACE2 and
FPR2 were present in both tanycytes and non-tanycytic cells, as indicated by immunolabeling (Fig.
5e,f), TMPRSS2 was expressed almost exclusively in tanycytes in this region. Together, these results
suggest that ACE2 and FPR2 expression form part of an inflammation-modulating pathway in
vulnerable hypothalamic regions, through which risk factors such as metabolic diseases and male sex
(or the absence of female sex) could increase susceptibility to and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion
Six months and several thousand papers and preprints after the beginning of the pandemic, if there
is one thing we have learnt about SARS-CoV-2, it is that almost every assumption that has been made
about the virus has been wrong. Although viral pneumonia, complicated by the "cytokine storm" and
a prothrombotic state (28-31), is still the principal symptom in severely ill patients, other tissues,
notably the gut, are also directly susceptible to infection (32). While our study may seem at first sight
to resemble the parable of the blind men and the elephant, we consider the possibility that SARSCoV-2 infiltrates the brain, and specifically the hypothalamus, with functional consequences to
disease progression and outcome, to be more in the nature of the elephant in the room. Our current
observations of SARS-CoV-2 S- and N-proteins as well as dsRNA in cells of the hypothalamic ME lay to
rest any doubt in this regard.
In the hypothalamus, the virus appears to adopt a remarkable infection method involving several cell
types, with the spike protein binding to capillary walls and the endfeet of ME tanycytes where they
contact the fenestrated endothelium typical of CVOs, viral particles entering the tanycytes and
producing more nucleocapsid components there, and the viral RNA transfecting other hypothalamic
cells in which it replicates, rather than in tanycytes themselves. ACE2, which we show to be present
in tanycytes and highly enriched in the capillary bed of the median eminence, and TMPRSS2, highly
expressed by tanycytes themselves, could allow the first step in this infection process. Tanycytes are
closely connected to each other in the ARH by gap junctions(33) and control the electrical activity of
neurons of the ARH and ME (34), as well as serving as transcytotic shuttles for blood-borne signals
into the CSF (35); the machinery underlying these functions – vesicular trafficking, cell-cell
communication, membrane fusion etc. – could equally be hijacked to allow virus propagation and
dissemination in the brain, including through the CSF. Indeed, the highly related SARS-CoV was also
observed by several investigators in post-mortem human brain tissue, including the hypothalamus
(36). Furthermore, altered labeling for several hormones in the pituitary (37) and long-term
neuroendocrine deficits in some SARS survivors (38) strongly support the notion of the hypothalamus
as a target of viral infection.

A frequent criticism of the hematogenous route hypothesis of brain infection has been the fact that
the virus is rarely detected by PCR in the blood of patients. However, a closer look at the literature
reveals that the virus is not only detected in a variable percentage of infected individuals, but that
the chances of detecting it are higher in severely ill patients (for example, see (39)). Once in the
bloodstream, the virus could also access other parts of the brain through a leaky endothelial barrier,
or other CVOs such as the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, the subfornical organ or the
area postrema (35), all of which play key roles in either the risk factors or the physiological functions
targeted by SARS-CoV-2. While the AHBA does not allow gene expression in these CVOs to be
analyzed, further immunolabeling experiments may provide evidence for viral targeting.
On the other hand, the idea that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the brain through peripheral nerves, and
specifically an olfactory route, has been raised by several authors, both in light of the anosmia
observed in COVID-19 patients (40, 41) and from experimental animal studies on SARS-CoV (42, 43).
In the latter, SARS-CoV administered intranasally was found in the hypothalamus and brainstem
within days, a determining factor for mortality (43). However, although changes to the OB of a
COVID-19 patient with anosmia have been noted (44), a more recent post-mortem neuropathological
study has revealed no anatomical, histological or immunohistochemical changes in the OB or brain in
a series of 18 patients, although the "inferior frontal lobe with olfactory tract/bulbs" was positive for
the virus by PCR in one case (45). In another preprint, while Neuropilin-1-positive olfactory neuronal
progenitors in the OE were labeled for S-protein, in the OB itself, only cells of the vascular wall were
found to be labeled (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.07.137802), in
keeping with the interferon response (7) and a presumed microglial barrier in this region (46). This is
contradicted by our observations not only of heavy S-protein labeling in the ONL, i.e. in mature
olfactory sensory neuronal axons, but of numerous dsRNA-positive cells in the glomerular layer in our
patient, confirming that the virus indeed infects putative neuronal cells of the OB. Furthermore, ACE2
and TMPRSS2 appear to be upregulated by the virus itself in the adult ONL, as postulated by other
authors (7), while fetal olfactory and vomeronasal sensory neurons express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2
at high levels. It should be remembered here that the ON and vomeronasal nerve serve as a scaffold
to guide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from the nose to the hypothalamus
during development (47), a process for which Neuropilin-1 is essential (48, 49), and that a continuum
of GnRH neurons persists in adulthood, directly connecting olfactory areas to the hypothalamus.
Additionally, the theoretical ability of the S-protein to bind to alternative receptors (50) or be cleaved
by other proteases (51) makes it possible that molecules other than ACE2 and TMPRSS2 also mediate
viral entry, expanding the range of susceptible cells, and the putative trans-activation of the virus
could obviate the need for the coexpression of the two molecules on the same host cell (52).
Regardless of its point of entry, once in the brain, the virus could infect a number of secondary
regions through transsynaptic or other mechanisms. However, given the high incidence of
anosmia/ageusia, the likelihood of central respiratory dysfunction, and the relationship between
hypothalamic neural circuits and risk factors for severe COVID-19, we focused our gene expression
analysis on regions implicated in these functions. Surprisingly, among the four most ubiquitous
enriched pathways for ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2-correlated genes, we found olfactory and taste
transduction. Both OR and TAS genes occur in "ectopic" locations within and outside the brain, and
could play roles other than odor or taste perception, such as the sensing of peripheral metabolites by
hypothalamic tanycytes (53-55) or the mediation of viral infection or the host response (56, 57), and
could be over- or under-expressed in disorders like obesity or diabetes (58).

Our network analysis and immunolabeling studies also unexpectedly revealed the inflammatory
mediator FPR2 as possibly playing a key role in brain infection through ACE2. While FPR2 can mediate
certain anti-inflammatory effects, it appears involved in the replication of dsRNA, an important step
in the propagation of RNA viruses (59, 60), and the hypothalamus exhibits inflammation in case of
obesity (61). Additionally, the deletion of FPR2 in mice alleviates HFD-induced obesity and insulin
resistance by suppressing pro-inflammatory mechanisms in the periphery (62), suggesting that FPR2
could potentially exacerbate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients at risk. Paradoxically, we
have recently shown that anorexia induced by systemic proinflammatory cytokines is also mediated
by hypothalamic tanycytes, through the IKK subunit Nemo or IKBKG (63), which is differentially
expressed in the lung of COVID-19 patients (20). Additionally, the changes we observed in
hypothalamic ACE2 expression, and especially in ME/ARH tanycytes, in ovariectomized mice were
strikingly similar to those in HFD mice, suggesting that the lack of estrogens and metabolic
imbalances trigger at least partially overlapping molecular mechanisms. This is of interest as various
ME/ARH neuronal populations that control feeding and energy expenditure in response to peripheral
metabolic signals express both neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) (64), itself found to inhibit the
replication of SARS-CoV (65), and the estrogen receptor ERα (64), linking sex, metabolism and viral
susceptibility or inflammation. Again, this is only a part of the picture, as both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are
also themselves responsive to gonadal hormones – estrogens and androgens respectively (66, 67),
and the role of FPR2 needs to be explored further.
There are no doubt several other networks that are involved both in hypothalamic functions and in
viral susceptibility or pathogenicity. As an intellectual exercise, we performed enrichment for GO
terms on the 140 genes that were both correlated with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the hypothalamus, and
differentially expressed in the COVID-19 patient lung. We then used STRING to build a proteinprotein interaction (PPI) map using 5 GO terms for biological processes (out of 115) that we felt
covered the largest range of functions of interest to a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection of olfactory or
neuroendocrine circuits: "regulation of secretion by cell", "vesicle-mediated transport", "immune
system process", "cell surface receptor signaling pathway" and "second-messenger-mediated
signaling". The resulting PPI network (p value = 2.58e-09) allowed us to see potential functional
relationships between our highlighted proteins, including several that we were unaware of, and
identify proteins that appeared to play key roles at the intersection of several functions (Fig. 6). This
was particularly the case with FPR2, which has previously been noted in hypothalamic microglia (68),
and which, in addition to binding viral peptides (see for example (60, 69)), could play a role in
neurodegenerative disorders, and mediate either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory
mechanisms (reviewed in (70-72)).
To summarize, our work provides proof that the brain not only possesses the cellular and molecular
machinery necessary to be infected, but that the hypothalamus, which harbors neural circuits
regulating a number of risk factors for severe COVID-19 in addition to being linked to olfactory and
brainstem cardiorespiratory centers, could be a preferred port of entry and target for the virus.

patient (bottom panels) showing heavy viral spike protein (S-protein; white) labeling as well as strong
ACE2 (green) and TMPRSS2 (magenta) expression in the outer (olfactory nerve) layer of the olfactory
bulb (OB), consisting of the fibers of olfactory sensory neurons in the nose. ACE2 is particularly
enriched in the walls of blood vessels (asterisk) as well. Blue – DAPI. (b) FPR2 (green) is also highly
enriched in the outer layer of the OB in the patient as compared to the control. (c) Immunolabeling
for the olfactory marker protein (OMP; white), a marker of olfactory sensory neurons, clearly
indicates that this layer, delineated by the faint dotted line, is indeed the olfactory nerve layer
consisting of the axons of olfactory sensory neurons. Numerous cells of unknown identity containing
double-stranded viral RNA (dsRNA; green) can be found close to the border (empty arrowheads) as
well as further inside the parenchyma of the glomerular layer, but rarely in the ONL. (d) Choroid

cells with an astrocytic morphology at the ventricular wall, including in some TMPRSS2-positive cells.
It is also present in astrocyte-like cells in the parenchyma near the ventricle. HFD strongly increases
the number and area occupied by FPR2-positive cells. 3V: third ventricle. (e) ACE2 expression (white)
in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARH) and median eminence (ME) occurs in ME tanycytic cell

processes are no longer labeled, but labeling appears at the apical pole of tanycytes further up the
ventricular wall and increases greatly in capillary walls in the ARH. The labeling in the pars tuberalis is
also reduced. TMPRSS2, also present in tanycytic cell bodies and processes, increases slightly with
HFD. FPR2, which appears to be in microglia-like cells in the ME and ARH and the cell bodies of
tanycytes, increases strongly. (f) ACE2 (white), TMPRSS2 (magenta) and FPR2 (green)

function and viral pathogenesis. Common genes between ACE2-/TMPRSS2-correlated genes in the
hypothalamus and the COVID-19 lung differentially expressed geneset were enriched for GO terms
for biological processes and queried with STRING to obtain functional protein-protein interaction
(PPI) networks using 5 diverse terms of interest: "regulation of secretion by cell" (red), "vesiclemediated transport" (blue), "immune system process" (green), "cell surface receptor signaling

Materials and Methods
Gene expression analysis for ACE2, TMPRSS2 and correlated genes in the brain
Differential distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across brain regions
The Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) (19) comprises 3702 anatomical brain regions from six donors
(five males and one female, mean age 42, range 24–57 years). Normalized gene expression values of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were retrieved from the AHBA for nuclei of the hypothalamus, insula, amygdala,
paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, pons and myelencephalon. The frontal lobe and cerebellar
cortex as well as the choroid plexus were included for comparison. The probes were mapped to ACE2
and TMPRSS2 genes using the collapseRows function of WGCNA_1.69-81 (73) in R ver3.6.3. Probe
CUST_16267_PI416261804 for ACE2 and probe A_23_P29067 for TMPRSS2 were selected based on
maximum variance across all samples (maxRowVariance of WGCNA package). The data were
concatenated across all donors for the specified brain structures. To account for missing ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 expression values for the brain structures excluded for various technical reasons such as
damaged or missing tissue or low-quality RNA (Allen Human Brain Atlas, technical white paper:
microarray survey), nonparametric missing value imputation was performed using R-package
missForest (74). Median expression values of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across all donors were presented in
the form of a heatmap using GraphPad Prism 8.
ACE2/TMPRSS2-correlated genes in key brain structures
For the selected ACE2 and TMPRSS2 probes, the “positive” and “anti-correlated” genes with their
normalized log2intensity gene expression values were retrieved using “Find Correlates" search utility
in the AHBA (with a cut-off of -0.3 > r > 0.3 as in the AHBA, where r is Pearson’s rank correlation
coefficient) for the brain structures of interest – insula, amygdala, hypothalamus, parabrachial nuclei
of pons and myelencephalon - sampled in all human donors. Probes with zero entrez-id were filtered
out, and if multiple probes represented a single gene, the one with the lowest adjusted p value was
retained. The expression values of the retrieved gene list were used as vector elements to recompute
Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) of all gene pairs using the rcorr function of R-package Hmisc
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html). The rcorr function returns a correlation
matrix with the r values and the corresponding asymptotic p value based on t distribution. The
function p.adjust and the method ‘fdr’ were applied to control for false discovery rate (fdr). ACE2and TMPRSS2-correlated genes were extracted from the correlation matrix and filtered by (i) setting
a threshold of -0.3 > r > 0.3 and fdr < 0.25, and (ii) selecting the correlations with the lowest fdr value
for probes mapped to multiple genes. According to the GSEA User Guide, an FDR of <0.25 is
reasonable in an exploratory setting, where the aim is to find candidate hypotheses, and where a
more stringent FDR cutoff may lead to potentially significant results being overlooked because of the
lack of coherence in most expression datasets (see also (75)).

Raw read counts from COVID-19 infected and uninfected human lung (n=2) RNA-seq dataset were
collected from GSE147507 (20) followed by differential expression analysis using DESeq2 (76). The
differentially expressed genes were checked for the overlapping gene count between the COVID-19
dataset and the ACE2- and TMPRSS2-correlated gene sets.
KEGG pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses
KEGG pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses of ACE2- and TMPRSS2-correlated genes
was performed using Clusterprofiler package in R (77), a widely used R package for enrichment
analyses. enrichGO and enrichKEGG functions based on hypergeometric distributions were applied to
perform the enrichment test for the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 correlated gene sets. q value cut-off (for fdr)
was consistently maintained at 0.25. The enriched pathways for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 correlated genes
for the analyzed brain structures were compiled together and visualized using the ggplot2 package of
R. The enriched pathway-gene networks were generated using the cnetplot function of the
Clusterprofiler package.
Gene-network maps connecting brain regions
The gene network maps connecting brain regions with shared pathways such as neuroactive ligand
receptor interaction, olfactory transduction, taste transduction and cAMP signaling enriched for
ACE2- and TMPRSS2-correlated genes were generated by curating genes associated with each
pathway and projecting them in the form of networks using Cytoscape v3.8.0. Furthermore, these
genes were checked for overlap with the COVID-19 differential gene expression dataset.
Functional protein-protein interaction network in the hypothalamus
Common genes between the COVID-19 differentially expressed geneset and ACE2-/TMPRSS2correlated genes in the hypothalamus, were queried in the STRING database (https://string-db.org/)
to obtain functional protein-protein (PPI) interaction networks, and the associated GO terms
enriched for biological processes.
Collection and processing of human tissues
Adult human post-mortem brains
Tissues were obtained in accordance with French bylaws (Good Practice Concerning the
Conservation, Transformation and Transportation of Human Tissue to be Used Therapeutically,
published on December 29, 1998). Permission to use human tissues was obtained from the French
Agency for Biomedical Research (Agence de la Biomedecine,Saint-Denis la Plaine, France, protocol
no. PFS16-002) and the Lille Neurobiobank. Studies were undertaken on the of the following
subjects: (i) a 63 year-old male patient with obesity and hypothyroidism, who died of multiple
complications and organ failure consequent to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by PCR on
nasal swabs upon admission to hospital for severe respiratory distress on Day 8 following the
appearance of symptoms; (ii) a 36 year-old male patient, overweight, smoker, who died of suspected
myocardial infarction after being admitted to the emergency room. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative
in all tissues tested (brain, lungs, tracheal and rectal swabs); (iii) a control 50 year old man with no
brain disease at the time of death, which occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dissected blocks of the adult brain containing the olfactory bulb, choroid plexus and/or
hypothalamus were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 at
4°C for 2 weeks. The tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS at 4°C overnight, embedded in
Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek), frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C until sectioning. For
human hypothalamus immunolabeling, a citrate-buffer antigen retrieval step, 10mM Citrate in TBSTriton 0.1% pH 6 for 30 min at 70°C, was performed on 20µm sections. After 3 washes of 5 minutes
with TBS-Triton 0.1%, sections were blocked in incubation solution (10% normal donkey serum,
1mg/ml BSA in TBS-Triton 0.1% pH 7,4) for 1 hour. Blocking was followed with primary antibody
incubation (see Antibody table) in incubation solution for 48h at 4°C. Primary antibodies were then
rinsed out, before incubation in fluorophore-coupled secondary antibodies or, in case of amplified
immunolabeling, biotinylated secondary antibodies for 1h in TBS-Triton 0.1% at room temperature.
For classic immunohistochemistry, secondary antibodies were washed and sections counterstained
with DAPI (D9542, Sigma). For amplified immunohistochemistry, after secondary antibodies were
rinsed, sections were incubated with VECTASTAIN® Elite ABC-HRP kit (PK-6100, Vector laboratories)
following manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were then incubated with biotinyl-tyramide reagent
(SAT700001EA, Perkin Elmer) following manufacturer’s recommendations, washed and incubated
with fluorophore-coupled streptavidin (1/500 dilution in TBS-Triton 0.1%) before counterstaining
with DAPI. Finally, the sections were incubated with Autofluorescence Eliminator Reagent (2160,
Millipore) following manufacturer’s instructions and mounted with Fluoromount™ (F4680, Sigma).
Immunolabeling in the human brain using the two antibodies to human ACE2 (R&D Systems, with
tyramide amplification, and Abcam, without amplification), labeled similar cells (Suppl. Fig. 11).
Human fetuses
Tissues were obtained in accordance with French bylaws (Good Practice Concerning the
Conservation, Transformation, and Transportation of Human Tissue to Be Used Therapeutically,
published on December 29, 1998). The studies on human fetal tissue were approved by the French
agency for biomedical research (Agence de la Biomédecine, Saint-Denis la Plaine, France, protocol n:
PFS16–002). Non-pathological human fetuses (11 and 14 gestational weeks (GW), n = 1 per
developmental stage) were obtained from voluntarily terminated pregnancies after written informed
consent was obtained from the parents (Gynecology Department, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, Lille,
France). Fetuses were fixed by immersion in 4% PFA at 4°C for 5 days. The tissues were then
cryoprotected in PBS containing 30% sucrose at 4°C overnight, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT
compound (Sakura Finetek), frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80°C until sectioning. Frozen samples
were cut serially at 20 µm intervals with a Leica CM 3050S cryostat (Leica Biosystems Nussloch
GmbH) and immunolabeled, as described below and as previously described (47).
Embryos and fetuses were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH
7.4 at 4°C for 2-5 days depending on sample size. The tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS
at 4°C overnight, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek), frozen in dry ice and
stored at −80°C until sectioning. For immunolabelling, 20 µm-thick sections of entire heads at GW 11
and GW 14 were processed as follows. Slides first underwent antigen retrieval for 20 minutes in a
5mM citrate buffer heated to 90°C, then were rinsed in TBS and blocked/permeabilized for 2 hours at
room temperature in TBS + 0.3% Triton + 0.25% BSA + 5% Normal Donkey Serum (“Incubation
solution”, ICS). Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies for two nights at 4°C in ICS.
After rinses in TBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for two hours at RT in ICS,

minutes, and sections were rinsed before coverslipping with homemade Mowiol.
Immunofluorescence labeling – Animal brains
Animals
Mice: Three C57BL/6J (Charles River) and two NPY::GFP (JAX:006417); POMC::Cre (JAX:005965);
tdTomato (JAX:007914) male mice, 8–9 weeks-old were individually housed and given ad libitum
access to water and standard pelleted rodent chow (R03-25, Safe diet). Three other C57BL/6J were
given ad libitum water and a high-fat diet containing 60% fat (HFD; D12492 Research Diet) for 9
weeks. Ovariectomy (OVX) in mice: 6 adult female mice against a background of C57BL/6J (ERa flox
with VH injection) were subjected to ovariectomy (OVX; N=3) or sham (N=3) surgery. Briefly, OVX
was performed under isoflurane anesthesia. A mid-ventral incision was made, the muscle separated
gently by forceps to expose ovaries and periovarian fat tissue. Ovaries and ovarian fat were removed
bilaterally after ligation of the most proximal portion of the oviduct. In sham animals, the same
procedure was carried out except for the removal of the ovaries. The surgical incision was sutured
and postsurgical recuperation was monitored daily. Animals were kept for 6 weeks after surgery.
Hamsters: Two 8-week (100 g) male hamsters (Janvier) were fed ad libitum and single-housed.
Animal studies were performed with the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committees for the Care
and Use of Experimental Animals of the University of Lille and the French Ministry of National
Education, Higher Education and Research (APAFIS#2617-2015110517317420 v5 and APAFIS#250412020040917227851), and under the guidelines defined by the European Union Council Directive of
September 22, 2010 (2010/63/EU).
Brain Fixation
To fix the brains of mice and hamsters, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of Ketamine/Xylazine (80mg/100mg/Kg body weight). Mice were perfused transcardially with icecold NaCl 0.9% solution followed by the fixative solution. For wild type C57BL/6J mice fed standard
chow or HFD, a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in borate buffer (sodium tetraborate decahydrate
pH 9.5) was used. For female mice, male NPY-GFP; POMC::Cre; tdTomato mice and hamsters, a
fixative solution of PFA 4% in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) was used. Dissected brains
were post-fixed for 4h in their respective fixative solutions before cryopreservation in sucrose 30%
(sucrose in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline pH7.4) for 48h before cryosectioning. Hamsters were
decapitated and the harvested brain immersion-fixed for 24h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate
buffer.
Immunohistochemistry
For triple-label immunofluorescence experiments, 30 μm-thick floating sections were rinsed 4 times
in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.4 and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in blocking solution (PBS containing
10% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with a
mix of primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution (goat anti ACE2 1:200; rabbit anti TMPRSS2
1:1,000 and mouse anti FPR2 1:200; see Antibody table). The sections were then washed three times
in 0.1M PBS and incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature with a biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit
secondary antibody to amplify the TMPRSS2 signal (1:500). The sections were then washed three

times in 0.1MPBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution; all purchased from Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, San Diego,
CA) in blocking solution. The sections were rinsed 3 times in 0.1 M PBS. Nuclei were then
counterstained by incubating the sections for 1 minute in DAPI.

Sorting
Median eminence explants were microdissected from tdTomatoTat-Cre mice, and cell dissociated using
the Papain Dissociation System (Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Fresh dissociated cells were
sorted by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in an BD FACSAria™ III sorter.
Quantitative RT-PCR analyses
For gene expression analyses, lysates of FACS-sorted tanycytes and non-tanycytes were subjected to
DNAse treatment (DNaseI EN0521, ThermoFisher) and then reverse transcribed using MultiScribe™
Reverse Transcriptase and the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems). A
preamplification step was performed (TaqMantm PreAmp Master Mix Kit 4488593, Applied
Biosystems) before real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was carried out on Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System using TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays listed below. Real-time PCR analysis
were performed using the 2-ΔΔCt method using as an internal/positive control a sample of 50pg of
total RNA obtained from the mediobasal hypothalamus as extensively described previously (79).

Supplementary Figure 3. Gene network of ACE2-correlated genes enriched for KEGG pathways in
the hypothalamus. Out of 45 significant pathways (fdr < 0.25), the top 15 pathways of interest have
been shown in the network. “olfactory transduction”, “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”,
“taste transduction”, “nicotine addiction”, “hematopoietic cell lineage”, “cAMP signaling pathway”,
“dopaminergic synapse”, “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, “Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation”,
“primary immunodeficiency”, “allograft rejection”, “staphylococcus aureus infection”, “autoimmune
thyroid disease”, “intestinal immune network for IgA production” pathways. The extraordinarily high
number of enriched and interconnected pathways with abundant correlated genes could indicate
that ACE2 plays a pivotal role across multiple hypothalamic functions, and that viral alteration of
ACE2 availability or function could have wide repercussions. The occurrence of a large number of
olfactory and taste receptors is intriguing, even if several of the former turn out to be pseudogenes.

Supplementary Figure 4. Gene network of ACE2-correlated genes enriched for KEGG pathways in
the parabrachial Nuclei of Pons. Out of 73 significant pathways (fdr < 0.25), the top 15 pathways of
interest have been shown in the network. Pathways enriched: “dopaminergic synapse”,
“amphetamine addiction”, “adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes”, “glucagon signaling pathway”,
“aldosterone synthesis and secretion”, “osteoclast differentiation”, “cAMP signaling”, “gastric acid
secretion”, “glioma”, “oxytocin signaling pathway”, “Cushing syndrome”, “endocytosis”, “GnRH
signaling”, “HIF-1 signaling”, “necroptosis” pathways. In contrast to the hypothalamus, however, the
number of genes per enriched pathway is fairly low, even though some genes, calmodulins and
calmodulin kinases, appear to be common to a very large number of them.

Supplementary Figure 5. Gene network of ACE2-correlated genes enriched for KEGG pathways in
the myelencephalon. Out of 73 significant pathways (fdr < 0.25), the top 15 pathways of interest
have been shown in the network “Huntington disease”, “synaptic vesicle cycle”, “cardiac muscle
contraction”, “carbon metabolism”, “adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes”, “dopaminergic
synapse”, “endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption”, “glutamatergic synapse”,
“dilated cardiomyopathy”, “protein digestion and absorption”, “oxidative phosphorylation”,
“hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)”, “Wnt signaling pathway”, “axon guidance”, “central carbon
metabolism in cancer” pathways. The myelencephalon, like the hypothalamus has a very large
number of networks with abundant ACE2-correlated genes, in keeping with the wide range of
functions that are coordinated in this region. This could contribute to the potential vulnerability of
cardiorespiratory centers to infection.

Supplementary Figure 6. Gene network of TMPRSS2-correlated genes enriched for KEGG pathways
in the insula. Pathways enriched: “olfactory transduction”, “tyrosine metabolism”, “JAK-STAT
signaling”, cytokine-cytokine signaling pathway, asthma, “Staphylococcus aureus infection”,
“pancreatic secretion” and “viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor” pathways.
Similar to the network for ACE2-correlated genes in the insula, the TMPRSS2-correlated genes also
form several subnetworks that do not interact much. Here again, the abundance of OR genes is
intriguing, as is the apparent enrichment for infectious and inflammatory pathways.

Supplementary Figure 7. Gene network of TMPRSS2-correlated genes enriched for KEGG pathways
in the amygdala. Pathways enriched: “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”, “olfactory
transduction”, “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, “maturity onset of diabetes in the young”,
“hematopoietic cell lineage”, “human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection”, and “Staphylococcus aureus
infection” pathways. As in the insula, there is a pattern of inflammatory or infectious pathways
connecting other pathways.

Supplementary Figure 8. Gene network of TMPRSS2-correlated genes enriched for KEGG pathways
in the hypothalamus. Pathways enriched: “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”, “olfactory
transduction”, “parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion and action”, “taste transduction”, cAMP
signaling”, pathways. The hypothalamic network for TMPRSS2-enriched genes appears less dense
than that for ACE2-correlated genes. cAMP signaling appears to be a common point of interaction for
diverse other networks, which do not interact much between themselves, with one or two
exceptions.

Supplementary Figure 10. Gene network of TMPRSS2-correlated genes enriched for KEGG
pathways in the myelencephalon. Pathways enriched: “neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction”,
“JAK-STAT signaling pathway”, “fat digestion and absorption”. Contrary to the diversity of enriched
pathways for ACE2-correlated genes, only 3 pathways were yielded for TMPRSS2-correlated genes.

Supplementary Figure 11. Similar immunofluorescence patterns obtained with two antibodies to
human ACE2 in the median eminence (ME) of the 63 year-old COVID-19 patient. Colabeling with
vimentin indicates that the fibers expressing ACE2 in the two cases belong to tanycytes. Scale bars:
40μm.

Supplementary Excel. Tables
Supplementary Table 1. log2 expression values for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across selected brain
regions in the AHBA. Expression levels (median log2 intensity)of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in all the brain
regions and reference structures selected are listed here.
Supplementary Table 2. List of all genes correlated with ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 in the 5 regions
analyzed. Pearson's rank correlation coefficient (r), p value and adjusted p value for all the genes
found to be significantly correlated with either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in each of the 5 regions.
Supplementary Table 3. List of genes correlated with ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 in the hypothalamus
and common to the COVID-19 lung geneset. Genes significantly correlated with either ACE2 or
TMPRSS2 or both in the hypothalamus, and also present in the geneset of differentially expressed
genes from the COVID-19 lung (20).
Supplementary Table 4. GO enrichment terms of ACE2-correlated genes. In addition to KEGG
pathways, we performed enrichment for GO terms using our ACE2-correlated genes in the 5 brain
regions of interest. The list of GO terms yielded for "biological processes", "cellular components" and
"molecular function" are presented.
Supplementary Table 5. GO enrichment terms of TMPRSS2-correlated genes. In addition to KEGG
pathways, we performed enrichment for GO terms using our TMPRSS2-correlated genes in the 5
brain regions of interest. The list of GO terms yielded for "biological processes", "cellular
components" and "molecular function" are presented.
