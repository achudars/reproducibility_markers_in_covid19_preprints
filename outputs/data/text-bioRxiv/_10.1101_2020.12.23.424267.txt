SARS-CoV-2 mutations among minks show reduced lethality and infectivity to
humans

Tomokazu Konishi
Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University

Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks has become a serious problem, as the virus may mutate
and reinfect humans; some countries have decided to cull minks. Here, the virus
sequencing data in minks were analysed and compared to those of human-virus.
Although the mink-virus maintained the characteristics of human-virus, some variants
rapidly mutated, adapting to minks. Some mink-derived variants infected humans,
which accounted for 40% of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases in the Netherlands. These
variants appear to be less lethal and infective compared to those in humans. Variants
that have mutated further among minks were not found in humans. Such mink-viruses
might be suitable for vaccination for humans, such as in the case of the smallpox virus,
which is less infective and toxic to humans.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), infects not only humans but also several other animal
species 1. Infection in minks has become a particularly serious problem 2-5; symptoms in
minks appear to be lethal in the USA and Denmark, 6,7 but are milder in Spain 8; those in
the Netherland seem to have been varied 5. Minks are culled because of the suspicion that
the mink-virus can mutate and infect humans again

mink-viruses were identical to that of humans; however, some variants mutated rapidly.
One such variant that was closer to the human-SARS-CoV-2 variant (human-virus) was
prevalent in humans of the Netherlands, amounting to approximately 40% of the total
cases. This variant was probably less lethal. Other variants that have mutated further
among minks are unlikely to infect humans. If mink farming continues, more variants that
have a low affinity to humans will become available. It is possible that such mink-SARSCoV-2 variants (mink-viruses) could be used for vaccination in humans, such as in the
case of the smallpox virus, which is less infective and toxic to humans.
Mink livestock have been farmed for a long time as their fur has a commercial value 10.
Although mink farming has been declining recently, up to 50 million animals are farmed
worldwide, mainly in Europe.

Results and Discussion
The two highest axes of principal component (PC) are shown in Fig. 1A (for basics of the
methodology, see Materials and Methods section). As is apparent, viral variants in human
and mink appeared into four groups that are temporarily numbered as 0–3. Mink-virus in
the Netherlands consisted of all groups, whereas those in Denmark belonged only to
group 1. The highly infective variants of the second wave, which was the pan-European
variant in both Denmark and the Netherland

11

, were not found from minks. In the

sequence data from both countries, variations in mink-virus that appeared in those axes
were limited, forming concentrated points stacked with each other (Fig. 1A). The limited
number of variations reflects that viral transmission from humans to minks is rare and
that the migration of the virus is also rare. The contribution of the viral samples from

minks to these axes was small, and the viral samples from minks appeared in exactly the
same PC as one of the humans. The axes represent the process by which SARS-CoV-2
adapts to humans

11

; group 3 includes the earliest variants, group 0 includes the first

variant transferred to Europe 12, and groups 1 and 2 were derived from group 0. The routes
of virus migration and mutation presented in these axes were completed in April, and all
groups could be found on all continents.
However, mutations also occurred in mink-virus in the Netherlands (Fig. 1B). The
directions of mutations among mink- and human-viruses are completely different from
one another as shown in Fig. 1A and 1B. As shown in Fig. 1A, this difference suggests
that the parental strain of SARS-CoV-2 did not originate from minks, otherwise the
reversion mutation would return to the direction that occurs among humans. None of the
bases or amino acids were unique to mink-virus 5. They can be recognised as
characteristic rearrangements that have collected parts of the human-virus. Such directed
mutations were only found in group 2 variants of the Netherlands and were not found in
mink-virus in Denmark.
These mutations may be the result of adaptation during viral transmission between minks,
and the mutation rates were high (Extended Data Table 1) 5. The differences are
comparable to half of those between peaks of the seasonal H1N1 influenza virus, which
usually takes a few years among humans to gain enough cumulative mutations that allow
escaping herd immunity 11. In addition, the rates of the missense mutations were high 13.
These phenomena were also observed in mutations in human-virus

11

. The direction

strongly suggests that the mutations are meaningful rather than random. These properties
could be due to the positive selection of variants that are more infectious among new

hosts, minks.
Viruses that mutate and leave the human-virus population can also reinfect humans. As
shown in Fig. 1C, variants that were mainly prevalent in the Netherlands (Fig. 2A) at one
time, accounted for approximately 40% of total virus present (Fig. 2B); the variant may
have been overlooked by the previous study 5. However, these are apart from other
human-virus, and no such direction of mutations has been observed among (Fig. 1C).
Rather, the seventeen thousand human samples formed a concentrated mass in Fig. 1B
and 1C. Furthermore, human-to-human infectivity seemed to decrease and become
sporadic (Fig. 1C, variants indicated by IDs). Variants further away than those from
humans’ mass have not yet been identified in humans (Fig. 1B). Conversely, highly
infective viral variants of the second wave in humans

11

have not yet been identified in

minks. These human and mink variants could have adapted specifically to their respective
hosts.
In many countries, the variants mutated before the second wave 11. This phenomenon has
also been confirmed in the Netherlands and Denmark, where similar variants were
prevalent and waves occurred similarly (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1). However, there
is one difference; the variant that seems to be derived from minks appeared mainly in the
Netherlands (Fig. 2A, B). This variant has disappeared to be replaced by the variant
belonging to group 0 that caused the second wave. This is also the case in Denmark
(Extended Data Fig. 1B). This shows that the mink-derived variant is less infective than
the second wave variant.
After the mink-derived variant disappeared, the fatality rate in the Netherlands increased
(Fig. 2B). In the first wave, many of the cases might have been ignored; hence, the rate

became very high, and then decreased. The confidence intervals showed that the increase
was substantial (Fig. 2C). This difference may correspond to the proportion of the minkderived human-virus present; if the variant is not lethal to humans, this difference can be
explained by its disappearance. Actually, many mink farmers positive by PCR did not
show heavy symptoms, and variants that related to the clusters of mink sequences found
on the mink farms did not spill over to people living in close proximity to mink farms had
occurred 5. Those would relate to the variants that have been adapted to minks. Since
lower infectivity suggests a slow spread in the human body, it could allow sufficient time
for the immune system to function, achieving lower lethality. Unfortunately, no data are
available regarding individual human medical conditions; hence, we were unable to verify
this lethality directly. However, data from 360 human samples with these mink-derived
variants are shown in Figshare

14

to enable clinical verification. Additionally, to check

the toxicity of other variants, PCs of other human samples from each continent are
available on the same page in Figshare.
Low lethality can also be expected, as the virus was derived from minks maintained in
dense populations

eventually die with the host. Therefore, a pathogenicity that is excessively strong becomes
a selective pressure. This could be the reason why adaptation was not observed among
mink-virus in Denmark, where only limited variants were found. This pressure is not as
effective for humans as it is for minks, as some patients do not show symptoms. However,
because most farmed minks are of the same age and have similar genetic backgrounds,
the disease status can be expected to be fairly uniform. Minks showed limited
pathological traits in some countries, 8 which suggested that this selection and attenuation

is progressing within the mink population, or attenuated variants of human-derived virus
are becoming apparent in minks.
The mink-derived human-virus in the Netherlands differ by only eight amino acids and
14 nucleotides from the closest human-virus. Although the mink-derived variant
disappeared in Europe, if the variant remained in humans, the difference would not be
safe enough for reverse mutations to re-adapt to humans.
Mutations of the group 2 mink-virus (Fig. 1B) appeared to adapt to the new host, minks.
Accumulating mutations will further reduce infectivity to humans. Variations among
these strains can be increased by mink farming. Such strains could be maintained in minks
or in Vero cells; among them, we could identify a combination of a strain and dosage that
infects, but does not cause symptoms in humans. If this is achieved, vaccination will
become possible by infecting the intestinal tract via oral administration. Therefore, local
governments should encourage farmers to maintain their minks, rather than culling them.
However, as minks can also carry human-virus as is, sequence analysis would be required
to avoid this risk. It may be advisable to artificially infect minks with a known safe strain
to restart farming. Human SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to change independently in
each region

11

, as shown in Fig. 2A. Although some of the mink-virus from Denmark

appear to be highly toxic to minks 7, the same group 1 variants would be the most adapted
to humans, and they continue to mutate among humans in regions such as South Africa
and Brazil. Some of these may have lower toxicity in minks.

Extended data

Materials and methods
PCA represents a sequence matrix, which is inherently multivariate data on multiple axes
15

. Each axis covers a certain set of base positions with specific weights. These are PCs

for the bases. A sample is given a value on each axis, PC for samples. PCs for bases and
samples are inextricably linked to each other. The high-level axes, such as PC1, represent
differences associated with more samples and bases; conversely, the lower axes represent
a minor difference, for example, a feature that appears only in a particular country or
region.

Sequence data of 1,832 human-virus in the Netherlands, 6,980 in Denmark, and minkvirus of 188 Netherlands and 63 Denmark were downloaded from GISAID

16

on

December 2nd, 2020. Sequences from 17,571 European human-virus downloaded
previously were also used. The list of samples and acknowledgements are available in
Figshare 14. The sequences were aligned using DECHIPER
15

17

then analysed using PCA

. The axes were identified using 103 mink-virus and 6092 human-virus that were

proportionally selected from each continent. These data may be comparable to 130
million animals; since the mink population is estimated to be 50 million

10

, the axes

provide two to three times the weight toward minks, which might have enabled the
identification of unique mutations in mink-virus. Following this, the axes were applied to
all data.

All calculations were performed using R

18

. All the codes used are presented in the

author’s page in Figshare 14. The number of confirmed cases and deaths were obtained
from the homepage of the WHO 19. The rate of fatality was estimated as the rate between
deaths in the following week and the number of cases during the week. The 95% and 50%
confidence intervals of the rate were estimated using the binomial test 20, according to the
estimation that deaths occur randomly among patients; if history repeats in the area with
the same conditions, the observed rates will most likely vary as in this estimate. The minkderived human-virus were found to have sPC8 > 0.003 and sPC9 > 0.001, and the rate
was estimated within the countries. The weekly estimation of rates varied, as the numbers
of infected and dead, and especially the number of sequences registered, were not very
high. Therefore, the line representing the status changes was smoothened using the
LOWESS function of the R 21.
