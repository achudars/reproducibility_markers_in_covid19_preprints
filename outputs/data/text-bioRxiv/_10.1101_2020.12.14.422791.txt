ABSTRACT
Antibodies against coronavirus spike protein potently protect against infection and
disease, however it remains unclear if such protection can be extended to variant
coronaviruses. This is exemplified by a set of iconic and well-characterized monoclonal
antibodies developed after the 2003 SARS outbreak including mAbs m396, CR3022,
CR3014 and 80R, which potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1, but not SARS-CoV-2. Here
we explore antibody maturation strategies to change and broaden their specificity,
enabling potent binding and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Using targeted
mutagenesis as well as light chain shuffling on phage, we identified variants with
considerably increased affinity and neutralization potential. The most potent antibody,
derived from the NIH-developed mAb m396, neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 virus with
a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC ) of 160 ng/ml. Intriguingly, while many
50

of the matured clones maintained specificity of the parental antibody, new specificities
were also observed, which was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy, indicating that a limited set of antibodies can give rise to variants
targeting diverse epitopes. Our findings open up over 15 years of antibody development
efforts against SARS-CoV-1 to the SARS-CoV-2 field and outline general principles
for the maturation of antibody specificity against emerging viruses.

INTRODUCTION
The emergence of at least three coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and
MERS) in the human population in the last two decades has highlighted the need for
rapid and sustained development of prophylactic and therapeutic modalities. Among
such modalities, antibody reagents blocking the interaction of the viral spike protein
with human receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARSCoV-1 and CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in the case of MERS) are among
the most promising . Various approaches have been used to identify neutralizing
1-3

antibodies, including the identification of B-cells from convalescent patients , the
4,5

immunization of humanized transgenic mice , or through the use of in vitro library
6

display approaches against viral spike protein (or more commonly its receptor binding
domain (RBD)) .
7,8

Here we employed a different approach based on the re-engineering and maturation of
previously reported antibodies against SARS-CoV-1. Although such antibodies
generally do not bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2, we speculated that the relatively
high level of sequence identify of the RBD of the two viruses (76% amino acid identity
9,10

) would allow us to shift antibody specificity through limited changes in antibody

variable regions.

We focused our attention on four well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (m396 ,
11

CR3022

12

, CR3014

13

and 80R ) which bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with
14

equilibrium binding and IC constants in the nanomolar range. Crystal structures have
50

been reported for m396 , CR3022
11

12

and 80R

14

in complex with RBD; these reveal

binding to a diverse set of epitopes, with m396 and 80R binding to distinct, but adjacent,

epitopes overlapping with the ACE2 binding site (Fig. 1a). Although no structural
information has been reported for CR3014, the antibody has been shown to block ACE2
binding . In marked contrast, CR3022 binds to an epitope distant to the ACE2 binding
12

site which is largely conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 . Unlike
15

m396, CR3014 and 80R, CR3022 displays residual binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD;
however, it does not detectably neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 virus .
15

For the re-engineering strategy, we focused on two well-established in vitro methods
for antibody affinity maturation: (I) site-directed mutagenesis of complementarity
determining regions (CDR) of human variable domains and (II) light chain shuffling
16

17

(Fig. 1B-D). Library design based on the reported structures of m396, CR3022 and

80R in complex with RBD was used for the construction of site-directed mutagenesis
repertoires, with antibody contact residues with antigen targeted for diversification. For
the alternative light chain shuffling approach, a previously described highly diverse
synthetic antibody library based on a single Vk1 framework was utilized

18,19

. Both

library classes were then selected for binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD using iterative
selections on biotinylated antigen (100 nM to 500 pM range). Using these approaches,
we rapidly identified human antibody variants with potent affinity and neutralization
potential for SARS-CoV-2.

in the case of the cross-specific CR3022 antibody (PDB ID 6w41 ). Based on the

structures, we selected contact and proximal residues in CDR regions of V and V ,

(Fig. 1A-C and

Supplementary Table 1; all six CDR regions were targeted for CR3014 for which no
structural information has been reported). Library construction was carried out in an
antibody single-chain Fv (scFv) format, resulting in 6.1 x 10 , 2.3 x 10 , 3.4 x 10 and
8

7

5.7 x 10 clones for m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R respectively. We performed four
7

rounds of phage display selection, using decreasing amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for
selection (see Methods); this resulted in enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 specific binders
for the libraries (with the exception of CR3014), as indicated by polyclonal phage
ELISA (Fig. 2A). Screening of individual clones by monoclonal soluble ELISA was
performed after round 4, followed by sequencing and cloning of non-redundant variants
into an IgG expression vector. After production in CHO cells, monoclonal antibodies
were characterized for binding to recombinant RBD by biolayer-interferometry (BLI)
and for neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells.

In the case of m396, two variants (designated B10 and C4) were chosen for further
characterization, with both antibody variants encoding several mutations in V and V

(Supplementary Sequences). Both variants displayed high monovalent binding affinity
to soluble SARS-CoV-2 RBD with equilibrium binding constants (K ) in the low
D

nanomolar range (7.1 nM in the case of B10 and 13 nM in the case of C4) (Fig. 2B,
Supplementary Fig. 1A and Table 1). Both variants also potently neutralized live
SARS-CoV-2 virus with IC s of 160 ng/ml and 340 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 2C and
50

Supplementary Fig. 1E). In addition to live virus, m396-B10 also potently neutralized

both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles (with IC s of 2.2 and 0.3 µg/ml,
50

respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 1L).

The B10 variant of m396 was further selected for structural characterization by
crystallography in a Fab format, both in isolation and in complex with SARS-CoV-2
RBD. Crystals were obtained for the unliganded B10 Fab, which diffracted to 2.3 Å
(Supplementary Table 2). Although no crystals were obtained for the B10 complex,
analysis of the structure of the m396 parent bound to SARS-CoV-1 RBD (PDB ID 2dd8
– Supplementary Fig. 2) reveals that the bulk of the contact surface is contributed by
21

heavy chain interactions (517 Å buried surface vs 370 Å for the light chain) in which

CDR H1 and H2 line one side of a cleft, whilst H3 lines the other side, into which a
loop of CoV1 RBD projects (residues 484-492 SARS-CoV-1 numbering, residues 498506 SARS-CoV-2 numbering). The m396-B10 clone contains several heavy chain
CDR mutations relative to the parental m396 antibody: two in H1, four in H2, and two
in H3 (Supplementary Information). Although the overall RBD fold is conserved
between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 2, colored in yellow and
salmon respectively), the loop bound by the m396 heavy chain cleft comprises a local
divergence hotspot containing multiple substitutions: Y498Q, T499P, T501N, I503V
(all SARS-CoV-2 numbering), considerably more divergent than the overall RBD. The
crystal structure of the m396-B10 Fab described here lacks electron density at most of
these CDR positions, indicating conformational plasticity in the unliganded state. In
contrast to heavy chain, light chain residues form more limited contacts in the m396
parental complex, with CDR L1 and L3 contacting a surface with considerably greater
conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. A total of two mutations were

selected in the m396-B10 L3 region (Supplementary Sequences) which contacts the
RBD in the parental m396 complex, with no mutations observed in L1 and L2 regions.

To further define the epitope of m396 B10, we carried out epitope binning by BLI,
which indicated competition with recombinant ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 3A). In
addition, we generated a triple mutant within the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV-2
RBD (comprising T500A, N501A and Y505A, SARS-CoV-2 numbering), predicted
to interfere with parental m396 binding. Mutation of this region in RBD resulted in
complete loss of binding of m396-B10 (as well as for m396-C4) (Supplementary Fig.
3B), suggesting that these variants bind to an epitope within the ACE2 binding site, as
previously demonstrated for the parental m396 SARS-CoV-1 RBD interaction .
11

In addition to m396, we selected two variants of CR3022 for further characterization
(clones G11 and B11). When expressed in an IgG format both antibodies displayed
similar equilibrium binding constants (K ) for SARS-CoV-2 RBD as the parental

CR3022 antibody: 94 nM for B11 and 131 nM for G11, respectively, compared to 99

and B11 variants, did not detectably neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 2C and

In contrast to the m396 and CR3022 phage display selections, no enrichment was
observed for the selection of the CR3014 site-directed mutagenesis library (Fig. 2A).
In the case of the 80R selection, polyclonal ELISA indicated the selection of binders,

which could also be detected by soluble ELISA in scFv format (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Three of the selected clones, designated C9, D1 and D10 were converted into an IgG
format, however binding was lost upon antibody format conversion and the clones did
not display detectable neutralization activity (Fig. 2B-C and Supplementary Fig. 1E).

Generation and selection of SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies by light chain
shuffling
In addition to the site-directed mutagenesis approach described as above, we
investigated light chain shuffling as a strategy for shifting the specificity of antibodies
from SARS-CoV-1 towards SARS-CoV-2 . We utilized splice overlap extension PCR
17

22

to pair DNA encoding variable heavy domains of each of the four antibodies analyzed

here (m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R) with a kappa light chain library on phage in a
scFv format (Fig. 1D). The synthetic light chain library is based on the human Vk1
framework, with diversity introduced at CDR L1, L2 and L3 position . After ligation
18

and electroporation into E. coli TG1, light chain shuffled libraries of 5 x 10 , 1 x 10 , 4

x 10 and 1 x 10 clones were obtained for m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R,

respectively. Three rounds of phage display selection were performed using decreasing
amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen for selection (see Methods); this resulted in
enrichment of binders for all of the libraries except m396, as indicated by polyclonal
phage ELISA (Fig. 3A).

In the case of the CR3022 selection, binders were dominated by a single clone
(designated B6) after three rounds (no additional binders were identified when
screening earlier selection rounds). The CR3022-B6 variant was expressed in an IgG
format in CHO cells, and further characterized by biolayer-interferometry (BLI) and

for neutralization in Vero E6 cells. These analyses revealed that CR3022-B6 IgG bound
to soluble recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD with an equilibrium binding constant (K )
D

of 290 nM, lower than observed for the parental CR3022 antibody (99 nM) (Fig. 3B
and Table 1). Intriguingly, and unlike parental CR3022, B6 was capable of neutralizing
of live SARS-CoV-2 virus with an IC of 4.4 µg/ml (Fig. 3C). RBD mutagenesis was
50

used to further characterize the CR3022-B6 epitope by targeting the CR3022-RBD
interface through a K396S mutation designed to disrupt the interaction (Fig. 4D, surface
C). While parental CR3022 binding was abolished through the mutation, CR3022-B6
fully maintained binding affinity (Supplementary Fig. 3B), indicating that the binding
mode of the variant may have changed compared to the parental antibody. Next,
CR3022-B6 was further improved through affinity maturation, by targeting all six CDR
regions for diversification using Kunkel mutagenesis and off-rate selections on phage
using biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD (see Methods). This resulted in an affinity
matured clone, designated CR3022-M, with moderately increased affinity (188 nM vs
290 nM for CR3022-B6) and considerably increased neutralization potential (0.35
µg/ml vs 4.4 µg/ml for CR3022-B6) (Supplementary Fig. 5).

In the case of the CR3014 selections, libraries became dominated by two clones (D1
and C8) after three rounds of selection. When converted into IgG (and unlike the
parental CR3014 IgG, which did not detectably bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD), both
clones bound with mid-nanomolar affinity (K of 51 nM and 61 nM respectively) (Fig.
D

3B and Table 1). Similar to the observation for the CR3022-B6/CR3022-parental pair,
only CR3014-D1 (but not CR3014-C8) was able to detectably neutralize live virus
(although weakly with an IC >100 µg/ml) (Fig. 3C).

In the case of the 80R selections, later rounds were dominated by a set of variants with
closely related CDR sequences. A representative clone (80R-A2) was expressed in an
IgG format and analyzed by BLI and neutralization: this revealed that the 80R-A2
variant had acquired the capacity to bind RBD and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a K

D

of 61 nM and an IC of 17.8 µg/ml (Fig. 3B-C and Table 1). Parental 80R has been
50

shown to block the interaction of SARS-CoV-1 RBD with ACE2 . Similarly, 80R-A2
14

binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD was disrupted through T500A/N501A/Y505A triple
substitutions targeting the ACE2 binding site as described above (Fig. 4D surface A
and Supplementary Fig. 3B).

Structural characterization of light chain shuffled antibodies
In parallel to the affinity maturation of CR3022-B6, we crystallized this variant in a
Fab format, both alone (1.7 Å) and as part of a ternary complex. The complex
containing CR3022-B6 Fab, CR3014-C8 Fab and SARS-CoV-2 RBD diffracted to 2.8
Å (Fig. 4A). Although electron density for the CR3022-B6 Fab component in the
ternary complex was weak (reflected in high average B factors - Supplementary Table
2), it was evident that the interaction was distant from the previously described binding
site of parental CR3022 (Fig. 4B). This observation was further confirmed by targeting
the CR3022-B6 RBD interface observed here with a double mutation in the RBD
(L455A/F456A), which completely abolished binding of the variant (but not parental
CR3022) (Fig. 4D surface B and Supplementary Fig. 3B). We next used cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) to position the CR3022-B6 Fab onto the surface of SARS-CoV2 spike trimer (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table 3). In the absence of antibody,
classification of the data indicated that the majority of spike trimers harbored two RBD
domains in the down conformation, with the remaining RBD in the up position

10

(Supplementary Fig. 6) . When incubated with an equimolar equivalent of CR302223

B6 Fab, ~77% of spike trimer particles were visualized with a Fab attached to RBD in
an up conformation (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. 6) and the remaining ~23% were
in the single RBD up conformation. Comparison of the RBD-CR3022-B6 component
of the crystallographic complex resulted in good agreement with the cryo-electron
microscopy map, highlighting binding of CR3022-B6 in proximity to the RBD ACE2
binding site, but distant from the parental CR3022 binding site (Fig. 4B and Fig, 5A).

In contrast to CR3022-B6, electron density of the CR3014-C8 Fab component was well
defined in the crystal structure of the ternary complex, highlighting an epitope distant
from the ACE2 binding site (Fig. 4A). Indeed, the epitope of CR3014-C8 closely
resembled that of the CR3022 antibody (Fig. 4B). Further structural information for a
second, but neutralizing, CR3014 variant (CR3014-D1) was obtained by cryo-EM.
When incubated with an equimolar equivalent of CR3014-D1 Fab, ~45% of spike
particles were visualized with a single Fab attached to an up-conformation RBD domain
(Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. 6), with the remaining particles in the single RBD up
conformation. Superposition of the CR3022-B6 and CR3014-D1 cryo-EM spike-Fab
structures revealed that both Fabs bound to highly similar and overlapping RBD
epitopes (Supplementary Fig. 7). These observations were in agreement with
mutagenesis experiments, with both CR3022-B6 and CR3014-D1 binding abolished by
mutations (L455A/F456A) adjacent to the RBD ACE2 binding site (Fig. 4D, surface
B), while CR3014-C8 binding was abolished by a mutation centered on the RBD
CR3022 binding site (K396S) (Fig. 4D, surface C, and Supplementary Fig. 3B).

DISCUSSION
Here we describe a rapid and straightforward in vitro strategy for the generation of
antibodies that potently bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Utilizing two
complementary strategies, site-directed mutagenesis and light chain shuffling, we
introduced diversity into the variable domain regions of four well characterized
monoclonal antibodies that had been developed after the 2003 SARS outbreak (Fig.
1A-B).

From the site-directed mutagenesis libraries we identified variants of antibodies m396,
CR3022 and 80R that bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD by soluble ELISA (no binders were
obtained for CR3104 selections). A variant of m396, m396-B10 was further
characterised by biolayer interferometry. These experiments revealed that while the
parental m396 antibody displayed no detectable binding, m396-B10 bound to SARSCoV-2 RBD with single digit nanomolar monovalent affinity (Fig. 2; compared to 20
nM for the m396-parental/SARS-CoV-1 RBD interaction ). Neutralization of live
21

SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells confirmed potent neutralization, with an IC of
50

160 ng/ml. Neutralization was also observed in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1
pseudoparticle assays indicating potent cross-specificity of m396-B10.

In contrast, no detectable increase of equilibrium binding affinity was observed for
variants of CR3022, although two of the analysed variants displayed increased kinetic
association constants for SARS-CoV-2 binding compared to the parental CR3022
antibody. However, none of the CR3022 variants generated by site-directed
mutagenesis displayed detectable viral neutralization (Fig. 2C).

From the kappa light chain shuffled libraries we identified variants of antibodies
CR3022, 80R and CR3014 that bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (no binders were obtained
for m396 selections, presumably due to the presence of lambda light chain in the
parental antibody). The CR3022 selections were dominated by a single clone, CR3022B6, which bound SARS-CoV-2 with reduced affinity compared to the parental
CR03022 antibody (290 nM compared to 99 nM) (Fig. 3B and Table 1). Intriguingly,
and unlike wild-type CR3022, CR3022-B6 effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 live
virus with an IC of 4.4 µg/ml. This apparent discrepancy between affinity and
50

neutralization potential in otherwise closely related variants was further confirmed
through epitope mapping. Mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD CR3022 binding site
abolished binding of recombinant parental CR3022, but not of CR3022-B6
(Supplementary Fig. 3B). In contrast, CR3022-B6 binding was abolished by mutation
of the RBD adjacent to the ACE2 binding site (L455A/F456A, Fig. 4D surface B),
which did not affect binding of CR3022 wild type (Supplementary Fig. 3B). The
suggestion that CR3022-B6 binds a different epitope to its parent was confirmed by a
crystal structure of CR3022-B6 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (along with
CR3014-C8 in a ternary complex), and through cryo-electron microscopy analysis of
CR3022-B6 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike. Both structural analyses
confirmed binding of CR3022-B6 in proximity to the RBD ACE2 interaction surface,
and distant to the original CR3022 binding site, providing a rationale for its observed
neutralization activity.

The observation that a human antibody, in its wild-type and matured light chain
shuffled form, can bind to two completely different epitopes is intriguing. This
observation was not limited to CR3022, with similarly distinct epitopes observed

among two variants of the CR3014 antibody (CR3014-C8 and CR3014-D1). Despite
the absence of structural information for the parental CR3014 antibody, mutagenesis,
crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy clearly highlight the considerable
difference in epitope specificity for these two light chains shuffled clones. The
difference in specificity also correlates well with neutralization potential: clones
binding to a surface proximal to the ACE2 binding site (CR3022-B6 and CR3014-D1)
display neutralization activity against live SARS-CoV-2, while clones binding distant
to the ACE2 binding site are not detectably neutralizing (parental CR3022 and CR3014C8).

How are antibodies with identical heavy chain, but different light chains, capable of
binding to two completely different epitopes? Further inspection of the CR3022-B6 and
CR3014-C8 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and the relative contributions of
their heavy and light chains to the interaction, provide an intriguing insight into this
question: while the majority of the interface (and binding energy) in most antibodyantigen interactions is dominated by variable heavy (V ) domains, this is not the case

in the variant structures reported here (Fig. 4C). In the case of CR3022-B6 a total of

more shallow and extended interface and allowing for additional interactions
(Supplementary Figure 2B).

Taken together, our results demonstrate that high affinity antibodies against a variant
coronavirus can be generated through maturation of previously reported antibodies.
Several of the selected antibodies potently neutralized live SARS-CoV-2 virus assays
with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC ) in the nanomolar range, well within
50

the therapeutic range .
23

While the use of site-directed mutagenesis libraries resulted in the selection of potent
variants with conserved epitope specificity, the use of light chain shuffling also resulted
in the generation of antibodies with completely new specificities. The discovery of such
dual specificity antibody pairs with identical heavy chains, but different light chains, is
intriguing and may enable the generation of bi-specific reagents with improved
resistance against mutational escape .
24

The observation that a limited number of CDR mutations can endow nanomolar affinity
binding and potent neutralization onto antibodies originally raised against a different
variant coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), also raises important implications for natural
immunity and vaccine design. While the potential of antibody maturation against
variant antigens has been demonstrated using haptens

25

and viral model antigens ,
26

insights into the mutational plasticity of coronavirus antibodies had remained unclear.
We conclude that in vitro maturation provides a rapid pathway for the identification of
potent antibody reagents against emerging viruses.

METHODS
Generation of site-directed mutagenesis antibody libraries
m396, CR3022, CR3014, and 80R scFv were gene synthesized (Genscript) and cloned
into the pHEN1 phagemid vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by Kunkel
mutagenesis . In brief, phagemid vectors were transformed into E. coli CJ236, single
16

colonies grown in 2xYT media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 10 µg/mL
chloramphenicol and 2% glucose until reaching an OD

600nm

of 0.4. Bacteria were then

infected with KM13 helper phage and grown overnight at 30°C in 2xYT media
supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, 10 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 50 µg/mL
kanamycin and 0.25 µg/mL uridine. Phage particles were purified from the culture
media using PEG/NaCl and uridine containing single-stranded DNA (dU-ssDNA)
extracted using a QIAprep spin M13 kit (Qiagen). Mutagenesis was carried out by
annealing degenerated oligonucleotides to the dU-ssDNA, followed by synthesis of the
covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) with T7 DNA polymerase and T4 ligase
(NEB). Finally, the cccDNA was transformed into electro-competent E. coli TG1 and
bacteria titrated to determine library sizes. Bacteria were harvested from the agar plates,
grown in 2xYT media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, and 2% glucose until
reaching an OD

600nm

of 0.4. At this point, bacteria were infected with KM13 helper phage

and grown overnight at 30°C in 2xYT media supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin,
and 50 µg/mL kanamycin. Phage antibody libraries were purified from culture media
using PEG/NaCl and stored at 4°C.

Generation of light chain shuffled antibody libraries
DNA encoding SARS-CoV-1 V regions was amplified by PCR (using Q5 polymerase
H

NEB). J segments were modified as required to match the following protein sequence

(GTLVTVSS). Region encoding V kappa library regions were amplified from a pHEN1
scFv library, comprising the end of the V J segment, glycine-serine linker and V
H

L

regions. The resulting light chain shuffled library was generated by splice-overlapping
extension PCR and cloned into pHEN1 in a scFv format using NcoI and NotI restriction
sites. DNA was transformed into electro-competent TG1, and phage produced and
purified as above.

Phage display selections
For phage display selection, we biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD using a terminal
AviTag and BirA biotin ligase (Avidity) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Phage display selections were carried out by alternating between capture of the antigen
on neutravidin coated wells on Maxisorp plates (Nunc) and streptavidin magnetic beads
(Invitrogen) . For Maxisorp plate selection, neutravidin was coated overnight at 50
27

µg/mL in carbonate coating buffer, biotinylated RBD captured, and blocked in PBS
supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 4% skim milk (MPBST). 1 x 10 phage were
12

blocked in MPBST, added to the wells containing antigen and incubated for 1 h. The
wells were washed with 1xPBST, 1xPBS. Phage were eluted with 100 µg/mL trypsin
for 1 h, then used to infect TG1 bacteria at an OD

600nm

of 0.4. Infected TG1 were plated

onto 2xYT agar plates supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose. For
streptavidin beads selection, phages were blocked as described above and incubated
with biotinylated RBD. 30 µl of streptavidin magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were blocked
in PBST supplemented with 4% BSA (Sigma), then incubated for 15 min with the
phage/antigen mix. Magnetic beads were washed with PBST and PBS and phage eluted
as described above. For site-directed mutagenesis libraries, we used 100 nM, 50 nM, 5
nM and 0.5 nM of biotinylated RBD for selection rounds 1 to 4, and 100 nM, 50 nM,

25 nM and 10 nM for light chain shuffled libraries. Phage titres used for selection were
reduced to 1 x 10 for rounds 2 and 3 and 1 x 10 for round 4.
11

10

Affinity maturation was carried out using off-rate selections and streptavidin magnetic
beads. Selections were performed essentially as previously described , with the
28

following adjustments: phage were incubated with the biotinylated RBD for 1h, excess
unbiotinylated RBD was added (100x and 350x for rounds 2 and 3) and further
incubated for 2/8 h for rounds 2/3 before capture on magnetic streptavidin beads.

Polyclonal phage and monoclonal soluble ELISA
For polyclonal ELISA, Maxisorp plates were coated with neutravidin overnight and
100 nM of biotinylated RBD was subsequently captured. 1 x 10 purified phage were
9

blocked in MPBST and incubated in each well for 1h. Plates were washed with PBST,
incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (GE Healthcare) for 1h and washed
again. The plate was finally incubated with TMB substrate (Perkin Elmer), the reaction
quenched with HCl and the plate read at Abs

450nm

(ClarioStar – BMG Labtech). For

monoclonal soluble ELISA, individual colonies from the selection titration plates were
inoculated in 96 well plates and incubated at 37°C overnight. The bacteria were reinoculated the following day at 1:50 and incubated at 37°C for 4h. The plates were then
spun down, the culture media discarded, bacteria resuspended in 2xYT supplemented
with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG and incubated overnight at 30°C. For
ELISA, Maxisorp plates were coated with neutravidin overnight and 100 nM of
biotinylated RBD subsequently captured. The plates were then incubated with 50 µl of
culture media, clarified by centrifugation, for 1h and then washed with PBST. The
plates were subsequently incubated with HRP-conjugated chicken anti c-myc antibody

(ICL Lab) for 1h and washed again. The plate was finally incubated with TMB substrate
(Perkin Elmer), the reaction quenched HCl and the plate read at Abs

450nm

(ClarioStar –

BMG Labtech).

Monoclonal antibody production and purification
DNA encoding antibody variable domains was amplified by PCR from the pHEN1
phage display vector and cloned into a human IgG1 expression vector based on pCEP4
(Invitrogen). After validation of the cloning by Sanger sequencing, the plasmids were
transfected into ExpiCHO cells (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (1 µg DNA/ml of cells; 2:1 ratio of heavy chain to light chain) and following
the max titer protocol. After 14 days, cell culture media were clarified by centrifugation
and the IgG captured using Protein G resin (Genscript). IgG were eluted from the resin
using 100 mM glycine pH 3.0, eluate was dialyzed against PBS the purity assessed by
SDS-PAGE. For Fab production, DNA encoding V and V regions was cloned into a
H

L

pCEP4 based vector encoding a C-terminal His tag. Production was carried out in
ExpiCHO cell as above. After 14 days, cell culture media were clarified by
centrifugation, dialyzed against PBS and Fab protein captured using Talon Resin
(Thermo Scientific). Fab protein was eluted with 150 mM imidazole in PBS, dialyzed
with PBS and the purity assessed by visualization on SDS-PAGE. In the case of m396B10, Fab was generated through proteolytic cleavage of IgG using papain and purified
using protein A affinity chromatography.

Affinity measurements using biolayer interferometry (BLI)
Purified monoclonal antibodies (Fab/IgG) were buffer exchanged into PBS using
equilibrated ZebaSpin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein concentration

was determined and the antibodies biotinylated by incubating for 30 min at room
temperature with EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotinylation reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at a 10:1 biotin-to-protein ratio. Free biotin was removed from the samples
by repeating the buffer exchange step in a second ZebaSpin column equilibrated with
PBS. Affinity of interactions between biotinylated antibodies and purified soluble RBD
proteins were measured Biolayer Interferometry (BLItz, ForteBio). Streptavidin
biosensors were rehydrated in PBS containing 0.1% w/v BSA for 1 h at room
temperature. Biotinylated antibody was loaded onto the sensors "on-line" using an
advanced kinetics protocol, and global fits were obtained for the binding kinetics by
running associations and dissociations of RBD proteins at a suitable range of molar
concentrations (2-fold serial dilution ranging from 800 nM to 50 nM). The global
dissociation constant (K ) for each 1:1 binding interaction was determined using the
D

BlitzPro 1.2.1.3 software. Human IgG1 was used for all measurements, except for 80RA2, CR3014-D1, CR3014-C8 for which Fab was used. For ACE2 competition assay,
biotinylated ACE2-Fc was loaded onto the streptavidin sensors on-line, and the binding
kinetics determined using either 500 nM of soluble RBD, or 500 nM of soluble RBD
pre-incubated with 1 µM of IgG for 5min, using advanced kinetics protocol.

Antigen production and purification
DNA encoding SARS-Cov-2 RBD (residues 319-541) was gene synthesized
(Genscript) and cloned into pCEP4 mammalian expression vector with a N-terminal
IgG leader sequence and C-terminal Avitag and His tag. The plasmid was transfected
into Expi293 cells (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and
the protein expressed for 7 days at 37°C, 5% CO . The cell culture was clarified by

was eluted with 150 mM imidazole in PBS, dialyzed with PBS and the purity assessed
by visualization on SDS-PAGE. The plasmid encoding the spike protein with Cterminal trimerization domain and His tag was a gift from the Krammer lab (BEI
Resources). The plasmid was transfected into Expi293 cells and protein expressed for
3 days at 37°C, 5% CO . The protein was purified using the His tag as for the RBD

purification. The protein was further purified on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (GE
Healthcare) using an AKTA Pure FPLC instrument (GE Healthcare) to isolate the
trimeric protein and remove S2 pre-fusion protein.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays
Serial 2-fold dilutions of test monoclonal antibody were prepared in 96-well plates in
octuplicate. The serial dilutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with an equal volume
of SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing 200 TCID (infectious dose). A Vero E6 suspension
50

containing 2 x 10 cells was added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37°C (5%

Gary Whitaker and Dr Markus Hoffmann , respectively, and the MLV gag/pol and
r

luciferase vectors which were kindly provided by Prof. Francois-Loic Cosset, in
CD81KO 293T cells, which were kindly provided by Dr Joe Grove , using mammalian
30

Calphos transfection kit (Takara Bio). Culture supernatants containing SARS-2pp were
harvested 48 hours post transfection and clarified of cellular debris by centrifugation at
500xg for 10 minutes. SARS-2pp were concentrated 10-fold using 100,000 MWCO
Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius) by centrifugation at 2000xg and stored
at –80°C. For neutralisation assays, the infectivity of SARSpp were diluted in media to
1000 – 5000-fold more infectious than negative background (based on pseudoparticles
lacking SARS-CoV Spike). Diluted pseudoparticles were incubated for one hour with
monoclonal antibodies, followed by the addition of polybrene at a final concentration
of 4µg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), prior to addition to 293T-ACE2 over-expressed calls,
which were kindly provided by A/Prof Jesse Bloom. 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded 24
hours earlier at 1.5 × 10 cells per well in 96-well white flat bottom plates (Sigma4

Aldrich). Cells were spinoculated at 800xg for two hours and incubated for two hours
at 37°C, prior to media change. After 72 hours, the cells were lysed with a lysis buffer
(Promega) and Bright Glo reagent (Promega) was added at a 1:1 ratio. Luminescence
(RLU) was measured using CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech).
Neutralisation assays were performed in triplicates and outliers were excluded using
the modified z-score method. Percentage neutralisation of SARSpp was calculated as

X-ray crystallography
Gel-filtration chromatography purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 333-528), and
light chain shuffled Fabs CR3022-B6 and CR3014-C8 (in 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM
NaCl) were combined in a 1:1:1 molar ratio at a concentration of ~4 mg/mL, from
which equal volumes (2 µL) were combined with well solution (100 mM Tris pH 8.0,
200 mM NaCl and 20% PEG3350) in a hanging drop format. After several weeks,
crystals of sword-like morphology appeared growing out of precipitate. Due to their
small size crystals were harvested without a cryoprotection regime and plunge-frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Large crystals of CR3022-B6 Fab alone were grown by combining
equal volumes (2 µL) of protein (9.6 mg/mL) with well solution comprising 200 mM
sodium citrate (pH 6.65) and 24% PEG3350. Crystals of m396-B10 were grown by
combining equal volumes of protein (5.95 mg/ml) with well solution comprising 200
mM NaCl, 100 mM BisTris (pH 5.95) and 25% (v/v) PEG 3350. Cryoprotection for
CR3022-B6 crystals was achieved by briefly (5-10s) swimming crystals in well
solution supplemented with glycerol (to ~25% v/v) prior to looping and snap freezing.
Diffraction data were collected at the Australian Synchrotron on beamline MX2 using
a Dectris Eiger X16M detector. In both cases a 360° sweep of data were deconvoluted
into 3600 x 0.1° oscillation images which were indexed and integrated by XDS . Space

the solvent content would be 50%. The search model for the RBD was also derived
from PDB entry 6w41. The search model for the Fab components were the same V +

replacement was able to place two Fabs without clashing on the surface of a single
RBD, although the second Fab returned a much smaller log likelihood gain than the
first. This was reflected in electron density for one Fab being unambiguous and well
resolved (clearly CR3014-C8), whilst the other was very weak, suggesting either
incomplete occupancy or conformational/positional motion of this Fab within the
lattice. CR3022-B6 was modeled into this second Fab position. Interestingly, the
CR3014-C8 Fab bound RBD where wild-type CR3022 would have been expected to
bind, whilst CR3022-B6 bound to a surface of RBD consistent with neutralization assay
data suggesting it was in fact neutralizing (unlike parental CR3022). Interestingly, the
bulk of buried surface for both interactions was dominated by the light chains
(Supplementary Table 2), which for these Fabs are very similar, raising the issue of
whether the CR3022-B6 Fab was in fact correctly modeled (the V region, in particular,
H

was very poorly resolved). That CR3022-B6 does bind this second position was
confirmed by a combination of; fo-fc difference maps suggesting CR3022-B6 was a
better fit, molecular replacement yielding stronger solutions with CR3022-B6
placement relative to CR3104-C8 placement, mutagenesis of the RBD epitope
eliminating CR3022-B6 binding, and cryo-EM returning a spike + CR3022-B6 model
consistent with CR3022-B6 binding this epitope. A short branched chain carbohydrate
was clearly present attached to Asn343 of the RBD, and has been modeled as two Nacetyl glucosamine (NAG) sugars connected by a beta(1-4) glycosidic bond, with a
fucose (FUC) residue attached to the N-linked NAG via a beta(1-6) glycosidic linkage.

For the m396-B10 structure, the search model was the Fab component of PDB ID 2g75.
Diffraction data and model refinement statistics are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

Cryo-electron microscopy
For sample preparation, either spike trimer alone or 1:1 Fab:monomer (molar ratio - for
the CR3022-B6 or CR3014-D1 datasets) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h
before applying to holey gold grids and freezing. 3.5 µl of each sample was applied to
1.2/1.3 Ultrfoil Au grids (Quantifoil) which had been glow-discharged for 1 min at 19
mA. Plunge freezing was performed using a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher) with 0
blot force, 4 s blot time and 100% humidity at 22 °C. For data collection, grids were
transferred to a Talos Arctica Electron Microscope (ThermoFisher) operating at 200
kV equipped with a FalconIII direct detector. Movies were recorded using EPU with a
calibrated pixel size of 0.986, a total dose of 40 electrons spread over 29 frames and a
total exposure time of 60 s. For data processing, motion correction, CTF estimation

34

and blob particle picking were performed in cryoSPARC . Extracted particles were
35

subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification and ab initio reconstruction in
cryoSPARC before their locations were exported to Relion 3.0 . Motion correction and
36

CTF estimation was then implemented in Relion 3.0 and particles were reextracted and
again subjected to 2D classification before 3D auto-refinement and Bayesian polishing.
3D classification was then used to sort the particles based on whether density (attributed
to Fab) was present above on of the RBDs. The final Fab bound trimer particles were
then imported back to cryoSPARC for NU-3D refinement. Supplementary Fig. 6
provides a flowchart to describe this workflow along with FSC curves. Supplementary
Table 3 provides a summary of the data collection and refinement statistics.

by BLI: biotinylated ACE2-Fc was immobilized onto streptavidin sensors and
incubated with either SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 500 nM or with SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 500
nM pre-incubated with IgG at 1 µM; (B) Biotinylated IgG immobilized onto

Supplementary Figure 6. Cryo-EM data processing. Sample micrographs and
flowchart to describe the data processing of the spike timer alone, or after a 1 hour
incubation with CR3022-B6 or CR3014-D1. Top: sample micrographs, with white bar
equivalent to 50 nm in length, and 9 of the best 2D class averages from each data set.
Bottom: flowchart to describe 3D classification implemented in Relion and 3D
refinement in implemented cryoSPARC, along with FSC curves with gold standard
resolution estimates. Spike trimer alone had a single RBD in the up conformation. Spike
trimer + CR3022-B6 classified to two classes with Fab bound to an RBD and one class
without Fab bound; the class containing ~37% of the particles was chosen for full 3D
refinement as the density attributed to the Fab contained higher detail. Spike trimer +
CR3014-D1 classified to two classes with Fab bound to an RBD and one class without
Fab bound; the class containing ~16% of the particles was chosen for full 3D refinement
as the density attributed to the Fab contained higher detail. The difference between the
classes containing Fab within the same dataset appeared to be caused by the RDB
flexing about the RDB linker.

Supplementary Figure 7. Comparison of positioning of Fab fragments in the cryoEM structures. The trimeric spike protein in each structure was overlayed and
displayed the relative orientation of the CR3022-B6 (in blue) and CR3014-D1 (in
green) Fabs with each other.
