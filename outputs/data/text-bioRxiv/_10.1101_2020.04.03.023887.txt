Abstract
There is an urgent necessity of eﬀective medication against SARS CoV2, which is producing the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. Its main
protease (Mpro ) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its
involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro
shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV
(nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS
CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range
interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations
is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with
the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified
representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing
potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro .
The main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2
is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This
is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a
topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more
than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property
reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also
remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site

of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show
that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the eﬀects of
powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of
the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least
change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the
protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of
new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.

Introduction

Since December 2019 an outbreak of pulmonary disease has been expanding
from the city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China [1, 2]. This disease–produced
by a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 [3]–has become pandemic in about
three months, aﬀecting more than 200 countries around the world. SARS-CoV-2
belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus [4, 5], to which the virus which produced
the respiratory epidemic of 2003 (nowadays known as SARS-CoV-1) also belongs
to. The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with SARS CoV-1.
In spite of this similarity and of the fact that SARS-CoV-1 appeared almost 20
years ago, there are currently no approved specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2
[6, 7, 8, 9]. In consequence, most of the clinical treatment used against the
disease is symptomatic in combination with some repurposed drugs, such as the
antiviral Remdesivir or the antimalarials chloquine [10] and hidroxychloroquine
[11]. This situation urges the scientific community to search for specific antiviral
therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
An attractive pharmacological target against the novel coronavirus is its
viral protease, also known as the main protease (Mpro ) of SARS CoV-2. It is
a key enzyme for the virus because it is essential for proteolytic processing of
polyproteins [12]. As remarked by Zhang et al. [13] “inhibiting the activity of
this enzyme would block viral replication. Since no human proteases with a
similar cleavage specificity are known, inhibitors are unlikely to be toxic.” The
three-dimensional structure of SARS CoV-2 Mpro has been resolved at diﬀerent
resolutions [14, 15, 13]. Other structures of SARS CoV-2 Mpro complexed with
inhibitors have also been reported in recent works [13, 16, 17].
There are some remarkable characteristics of SARS CoV-2 Mpro in relation
to the protease of SARS CoV-1. They share 96% of amino acids sequence, i.e.,
they diﬀer in the amino acids at only 12 out of 303 positions in the sequence.
Zhang et al. [13] have reported that the superposition of the chain A of two
structures corresponding to the main proteases of SARS CoV-1 and of SARS
CoV-2, namely 2BX4 and 6Y2E, respectively, shows a root mean square (r.m.s.)
deviation of only 0.53 Å for all Cα positions. The first question that emerges here
is whether such similarities are also reflected at the topological structural level of
the proteins. By topological we mean here the discrete topology emerging from
a network theoretic representation of a protein. In this representation of the
protein structure the nodes of the network represent amino acids and the edges
connecting them indicate that the corresponding residues are at a distance in

which they can interact to each other. Because the Euclidean distance between
the amino acids is used to construct the network we more correctly should
refer to this framework as topographical more than topological. This network
theoretic representation has been previously used to answer several questions
related to protein structure and functioning [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Among the tools
in use, the one of node centrality [23, 24] has played a fundamental role (see
for instance [22]. These indices capture the relative importance–both structural
and dynamical–of an individual amino acid in the protein.
Here we construct protein residue networks (PRN) for SARS CoV-2 Mpro
and some of its inhibitors. The PRN of SARS CoV-2 Mpro is illustrated in Fig.
1. We then analyze the similarities in the topological structure of SARS CoV-2
Mpro with that of SARS CoV-1 for which we also construct the corresponding
PRN. We then show that both proteases are very similar in relation to a few
topological characteristics which account for a very close environment around
the amino acids. That is, when the measures used account for the locality of the
topological environment of a residue the two proteases do not diﬀer in more than
2%. However, when the measures considered account for wider environments
around the nodes the diﬀerence between the two proteins can increase up to
10-20%. These measures quantify how a perturbation at an amino acid is transmitted through the whole structure to the rest of the residues in the protein.
When this transmission is allowed not only between close pairs of amino acids
but also between very distant ones, the diﬀerence between the two proteases
increases up to 1900%. That is, SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive to
the transmission of perturbations between amino acids through the topological structure of the protein than SARS CoV-1 Mpro . We discovered that the
residues with this largest sensitivity in SARS CoV-2 Mpro are the ones involved
in the binding of the three inhibitors studied here. That is, the most central
amino acids according to this long-range indices are also the most aﬀected by
the interaction with the inhibitors as they are either in the binding site or very
close to it. Consequently, we have discovered that the most relevant amino acids
from the topological point of view are also the most relevant ones for the binding
of some inhibitors to the SARS CoV-2 Mpro and should play an important role
in the design of drugs inhibiting this protease.

Methods
Construction of the protein residue networks

The protein residue networks (PRN) (see ref. [23] Chapter 14 for details) are
built here by using the information reported on the Protein Data Bank [25] for
the proteases of SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 as well as the complexes of the
last one with an inhibitor. The nodes of the network represent the α-carbon
of the amino acids. Then, we consider cutoﬀ radius rC , which represents an
upper limit for the separation between two residues in contact. The distance
rij between two residues i and j is measured by taking the distance between Cα

atoms of both residues. Then, when the inter-residue distance is equal or less
than rC both residues are considered to be interacting and they are connected
in the PRN. The adjacency matrix A of the PRN is then built with elements
defined by
{
H (rC − rij ) i ̸= j,
Aij =
(1)
0
i = j,
where H (x) is the Heaviside function. Here we use the typical interaction
distance between two amino acids, which is equal to 7.0 Å. We have tested
distances below and over this threshold obtaining in general networks which are
either too sparse or too dense, respectively.
In this work we consider the structures of the Mpro of SARS CoV-1 deposited
in the PDB with codes: 2H2Z [26], 2DUC [27], 1UJ1 [28], and 2BX4 [29]. We
also study the following structures of of SARS CoV-2 with PDB codes: 6M03
[14], 6M2Q [14], and 6Y2E [13]. For the complexes of Mpro of SARS CoV-2
with inhibitors we study the structures with PDB codes: 6M0K [17], 6YZE [17]
and 6Y2G [13].
The length of the proteases is 306 amino acids. However, there are structures
(see Table 1) which are only resolved for amino acids 3 to 300, which gives a
length of 298 [29]. Thus, for the sake of homogeneity of the analysis we consider
here the same part of the amino acids sequence for all the structures analyzed,
i.e., from residue 3 to residue 300. This does not alter the analysis as the two

extremes of the protease are disordered and do not participate in important
interactions.

2.2

Network measures

The first category of measures correspond to those related to the most local
structure around the nodes, such as those based on the degree of the nodes, i.e.,
the number of connections that a node has (see [23] for details). The degree
accounts for the immediate eﬀect of a node to its closest neighborhood. Among
2m
these measures we use here the edge density, which is defined as δ =
,
n (n − 1)
where m is the number of edges and n is the number of nodes. Because the
2m
average degree ⟨k⟩ =
, the relation with the edge density is clear. Ann
other measure related to the degree of the nodes is the degree heterogeneity,

[30], which represents a measure of how hetρ =

erogeneous the degrees of the nodes is [31]. A regular network, i.e., a network
with all nodes of the same degree, will have ρ = 0, it is followed by networks
with normal-like degree distributions, then networks with more heterogeneous
ones, and will end up with networks with in which the probability P (k) of
finding a node of degree k decays like distribution of the form P (k) ∼ k −1 ,
where ρ = 1. The average Watts-Strogatz clustering coeﬃcient [32] is defined

as ⟨C⟩ =

where |Ek | is the number of edges between nodes in the kth community of the
network, m is the total number of edges in the network and kj is the degree
of the node j. these communities were previously detected by using Newman
eigenvector method [34]. Another measure related to the degree is the degree assortativity coeﬃcient [35], which is Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of the
degree-degree correlation. r > 0 (degree assortativity) indicates a tendency of
high degree nodes to connect to other high degree ones. r < 0 (degree disassortativity) indicates the tendency of high degree nodes to be connected to
low degree ones. Other measures in this class assume that “information” is
transmitted in the network through the topological shortest paths. The length
of the shortest path is a distance d (i, j) between the corresponding pairs of
nodes i and j, and it is known as the shortest path distance. The average
∑

path length ⟨L⟩ =
d (i, j) is typically used as a measure of the
n (n − 1) i<j
‘small-worldness’ of the network [32]. We also consider the average betweenρikj

paths between the nodes i and j that cross the node k, and ρij is the total
number of shortest paths that go from i to j. It accounts for the importance
of a node in passing information through it to connect other pairs of nodes via
shortest path only.
The second category of measures is formed by those that account for the
transmission of information not only via the shortest paths but by using any
available route that connect the corresponding pair of nodes. These measures
use the concept of walk instead of that of a path. A walk of length k in G is
a set of nodes i1 , i2 , . . . , ik , ik+1 such that for all 1 ≤ l ≤ k, (il , il+1 ) ∈ E. A
closed walk is a walk for which i1 = ik+1 . The number
( ) of walks of length k
between the nodes i and j in a network is given by Ak ij . The first of these
measures considered here is the eigenvector centrality EC [37], which is the
corresponding entry of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue
of A. The relation of this index with walks is given by the following. Let
Nk (i) be the number of walks of length k starting at node i and ending elsewhere. Then, if the network ∑
is not bipartite, which is the case of the current
n
work, ECi = limk→∞ Nk (i)/ j=1 Nk (j) (see Chapter 5 in [23]). That is, the
eigenvector centrality of a node is the ratio of the number of walks of infinite
length that start at this node to the whole number of such walks starting elsewhere. Consequently, the average eigenvector centrality ⟨EC⟩, accounts for the
spread of information from the nodes beyond the nearest neighbors and using
any infinite-length walk in the graph. A type of measures of the second kind
are based on counting all walks of any length, but giving more weight to the
shorter than to the longer ones. These measures are based on the following
∑∞
k
matrix function: G := k=0 Ak! = exp (A), where exp (A) is the exponential of
the matrix. then, we consider the average of the diagonal entries of this matrix,
1 ∑n
which is known as the average subgraph centrality ⟨SC⟩ =
Gpp [38],
n p=1
which accounts for the participation of the corresponding node in all subgraphs
of the graphs, giving more weight to the shortest than to the longer ones. Such
subgraphs include for instance, edges, triangles, wedges, squares, etc. Another
measure is the average of the non-diagonal entries of exp (A), which is known as
∑
2
the average communicability of the network, ⟨Gpq ⟩ =
Gpq [39].
n (n − 1) p,q
It accounts for how much a pair of nodes can communicate to each other by
using all potential routes available in the network, but giving more weight to
the shortest than to the longer ones. Finally, in this category we include the
∑

average communicability angle ⟨θ⟩ =
θpq [40], where the angle

(
Gpq
−1
√
. The average
between a pair of nodes is defined as: θpq = cos
Gpp Gqq
communicability angle describes how eﬃciently a network transmit information
between its pairs of nodes by using all available routes.
The third category of measures is formed by all-walks indices that penalize
less heavily longer walks connecting pairs of nodes in a network. That is, al-

though G = exp (A) accounts for all walks connecting every pair of nodes, it
penalizes very much those walks of relatively large length, then making more

Results
Free protease

The main goal of this section is to analyze a few network theoretic measures
of the Mpro of SARS CoV-2 and compare them with those of the protease of
SARS SARS CoV-1. The amino acid sequence of both proteases share 96% of
similarity, i.e., only 12 amino acids are diﬀerent in both proteases of a total of
303. These amino acids are at positions 33, 44, 63, 84 86, 92, 132, 178, 200, 265,
283 and 284. In order to compare the topological features of the main proteases
of SARS CoV-1 and of SARS CoV-2 we go a step further here and compare
several structures of the Mpro of SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2. In Table 1
we give the PDB codes of 6 structures of the main protease of SARS CoV-1
and 4 of SARS CoV-2 without inhibitors. In these structures not only there
are no inhibitors, but also there are no mutations in the structure of the wild
proteases. In the case of the structure with PDB code 1Q2W the residues 45-48
are missing in the PDB. In 3VB3 we have found that di(hydroxyethyl)ether
(PEG) and 1,2-ethanediol (EDO) are also present in the crystal structure. In a
similar way the structure 6YB7 contains dimethylsulfoxide (DMS) in the crystal
structure. For these reasons we will not include these three structures in the
further analysis.
For the rest of the structures, i.e., 4 structures of the main protease of
SARS CoV-1 and 3 structures of the same for SARS CoV-2, we calculate all
the topological measures defined in Methods. We then obtained the mean and
standard deviation of these measures for the two groups of structures and report
them in Table 2. We can observe in this Table that most of the topological
characteristics of the first kind of the PRNs of both proteases are very similar
with relative diﬀerences not bigger than 2% for all the properties analyzed.
In order to test the significance of the diﬀerences between the two groups of

proteases we use the p-values of the Mann-Whitney U-test [42]. This statistical
measure has been proposed for the analysis of network measures, in particular
for protein networks [43, 44]. According to the p-values (see last column in
Table 2) none of these measures display significant diﬀerence between the two
groups of proteases.
We then continue the analysis by comparing the topological measures of the
second kind. We notice that the eigenvector centrality, which has been found
very useful in previous analysis of PRN [22], does not display any significant
diﬀerence between both proteases according to the Mann-Whitney test. However, there are diﬀerences in the mean subgraph centrality of about 14% and
of the average communicability between pairs of nodes of about 18%. In both
cases, the indices are significantly larger for the protease of SARS CoV-2 than
for that of SARS CoV-1. According to the p-values these diﬀerences are significant at 94% level of confidence in the Mann-Whitney U-test. This means that
the structural changes that make the diﬀerence between the proteases of SARS
CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 increase the capacity of the individual amino acids of
feeling a perturbation or thermal oscillation produced in another amino acid
of the protein. As we have previously explained these communicability factors
penalizes very heavily any perturbation being transmitted between two amino
acids separated by a relatively long distance in the protein. Thus, they can
be considered as indices that account for shorter range interactions than the
third kind measures considered here. It should be noticed that although the
communicability angles display very little relative variation between the two
groups of proteases, these diﬀerences are significant at 94% of confidence in the
Mann-Whitney test.
Both LR subgraph centrality and communicability display dramatic increment in SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1. In this case the increase of
these indices is more than 1900% for both, the LR communicability and LR
subgraph centrality. In short, this means that the protease of SARS CoV-2 has

more than 13 times more capacity of transmitting perturbations between pairs
of nodes than the protease of SARS CoV-1. This is equivalent to say that the
protease of SARS CoV-2 is significantly much more topologically eﬃcient in
transmitting “information” among its amino acids than the protease of SARS
CoV-1. These two topological measures display significant diﬀerences between
the two groups of proteases according to the statistical p-values obtained from
the Mann-Whitney U-test at 94% of confidence.
We now proceed to the analysis of the local variation of the subgraph and
the LR subgraph centralities for the amino acids of the two Mpro (see Fig. 2)
averaged for all the structures previously mentioned, i.e., 2H2Z, 1UJ1, 2DUC,
2BX4 for SARS CoV-1 and 6M03, 6Y2E, 6M2Q for SARS CoV-2. In the case
of the subgraph centrality the largest change is produced for a few amino acids
which increase their centrality in SARS CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1. These
are the cases of 25, 26, 27, 118, 17, and 24. But there are also other amino
acids which drop their centrality in SARS CoV-2, such as 170, 73, 169, 165,
89, and 252 among others (see Fig. 2(b)). Therefore, the increase of the subgraph centrality of a few amino acids makes that in total the average subgraph
centrality increases in SARS CoV-2 in relation to SARS CoV-1. An important
characteristic feature of the diﬀerences in this centrality between the two proteases is that they are spread across the three domains of the proteases with a
large increment in the domains I and III. This is a major diﬀerence with the
LR subgraph centrality (see Figs. 2(c) and (d)), where the main change is a
dramatic increase in the centrality of the nodes in the domains I and II of the
SARS CoV-2 protease relative to SARS CoV-1. The changes occurring in the

domain III are imperceptible in relation to those of the other two domains.32
In order to illustrate the distributions of the most central amino acids according to both measures in the three-dimensional structures of the proteases we
selected two structures, 2BX4 for SARS CoV-1 and 6Y2E for SARS CoV-2 as
representative of the two groups of structures. Notice that these two structures
have been used by Zhang et al. [13] for their comparison of the 3D structures
of both proteases. Both structures are illustrated in Fig. 3. It can be seen that
the largest values of the LR subgraph centrality are concentrated in a relatively
small region of the protein structure, while those of the subgraph centrality are
more spread across the whole structure. We then inquire about this region of
the Mpro in SARS CoV-2 which shows the largest change in the LR subgraph
centrality relative to its analogue of SARS CoV-1.
The first remarkable observation of the amino acids with the largest change
in the LR subgraph centrality is that they are all closely separated to each other
in the three-dimensional space. For instance, the 22 amino acids displaying the
largest change in this centrality form a connected subgraph of the PRN as
illustrated in Fig. 4. This subgraph of 22 nodes has 48 connections among
these amino acids, which produces an edge density of 0.21, almost 10 times

Figure 4: Illustration of the 22 amino acids which display the largest diﬀerence in
the LR subgraph centrality in a representative Mpro of SARS CoV-2 (6Y2E) in
relation to one of SARS CoV-1 (2BX4). The radius of the nodes is proportional
to the diﬀerence in the LR subgraph centrality between the two proteases. The
catalytic site Cys-145 is pointed to with an arrow. The size of the nodes is

bigger than the total density of the protease. The second remarkable feature
of this subgraph is that it contains one of the two catalytic amino acids of the
Mpro of SARS CoV-2, which is Cys-145. That is, the region with the largest
increase in the LR subgraph centrality of the protease of SARS CoV-2 relative
to SARS CoV-1 is the one enclosing the catalytic binding site of amino acid
Cys-145. It is also remarkable that this region of large increment in the LR
subgraph centrality contains some amino acids which are located in the binding
site of the Mpro to α-ketoamide inhibitors as well as other kind of inhibitors, as
we will analyze further in this work. This is the case of the residue 144-147,
other amino acids in this binding site like residues 162, 163 also display large
increment in the LR subgraph centrality. The last remarkable observation is
that the domain III displays small change in relation to the changes of domains
I and II in this topological parameter. However, as we will see in the next
paragraphs this domain (residues 198-303) which is formed by 5 helices and
is involved in the dimerization of the Mpro , also increases significantly the LR
communicability in relation to SARS CoV-1.
A better picture of the changes in the diﬀerent regions of the Mpro of SARS

CoV-2 relative to SARS CoV-1 can be obtained again by analyzing the diﬀerences between the communicabilities and LR-communicabilities averaged for the
4 structures of SARS CoV-1 and 3 structures of SARS CoV-2 before considered.
For this we obtain an average communicability (resp. LR communicability) matrix for the structures of SARS CoV-1 and another for the structures of SARS
CoV-2. Then, we obtain the diﬀerence between these two matrices. In Fig.
5 we illustrate the diﬀerence matrices for both kinds of communicabilities. In
the first case it can be observed that the communicability between all pairs
of residues in the domain I (residues 10-99) mainly increase in SARS CoV-2
relative to SARS CoV-1, with an increase of 12.8% relative to SARS CoV-1.
However, in the domain II (residues 100-182) there is mainly a drop of the communicability between the residues in the domain, which decrease 2.02%, but
there is an increase of 19.6% in the trade oﬀ between domains I and II, and an
increase of 39.2% in the trade between domains I and III. The domain III shows
a mixed behavior with some pairs of residues increasing and other decreasing
their communicability, but the main result is an increase of 5.58% relative to
SARS CoV-1. The communicability between domains II and III in the SARS
CoV-2 structures increase in 23.9% relative to the same in SARS CoV-1.
We finally analyze the changes in the LR communicability between the different domains of the SARS CoV-2 protease. Here the changes are dramatic and
in all cases the LR communicability in the SARS CoV-2 protease is higher than
that in SARS CoV-1. For instance, the average communicability between pairs
of nodes in the domain I is 1997% higher in SARS CoV-2 than in SARS CoV-1.
This percentage of increment are 1814% in the domain II and 2651% in domain
III. The inter-domain communicability also increases very significantly with increment of 1896% (domains I-II), 2350% (domains (I-III) and 2237% (domains
II-III). In closing, the structural changes between the main proteases of SARS
CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2 produced a dramatic impact in the LR communicability between residues in the protease of SARS CoV-2 with huge improvement
in long-range communication between residues practically in all domains of the
protease.

3.2

SARS CoV-2 protease bounded to inhibitors

We turn now our attention to the analysis of the Mpro of SARS CoV-2 complexed
with some inhibitors. The selection of these inhibitors has been based on: (i) the
existence of the crystallographic structure of the complex inhibitor-Mpro , (ii) the
existence of reports about the inhibitory concentration IC50 of the inhibitor, and
(iii) the fact that the inhibitors display a great potency against the main protease
of SARS CoV-2. Then, we have selected three complexes which correspond to
PDB codes 6M0K, 6LZE and 6Y2G. The first two compounds were recently
reported by Dai et al. [17] and the third is an α-ketoamide inhibitor reported
by Zhang et al. [13]. The first two inhibitors display IC50 < 0.1µM and the
third shows IC50 ≈ 0.67 ± 0.18.
In Table 3 we resume the results of the calculation of average topological
properties of the Mpro structure bounded to these inhibitors. In these calcula13

tions we consider only the residues 3-298 of the protease as explained in Methods
to make these results comparable with the ones obtained in the previous section.
It can be seen that here again the topological measures of the first class display
relatively little variation for the three complexed proteases relative to the free
one.
We then move to the analysis of the measures of second and third type.
As can be seen in Table 3 there are significant changes, of more than 20%, in
the subgraph centrality and the communicability of the complexed proteases
in relation to the average of the wild proteases previously analyzed. However,
here again, the most dramatic change in these topological properties occurs in
the values of the LR subgraph centrality and communicability, with relative
changes of more than 98%. We should notice that the smallest change in these
parameters occurs for the structure 6M0K, which corresponds to the strongest
inhibitor, followed by 6LZE, which is the intermediate one, and finally 6Y2G
which is the weakest of the three. That is, the strongest inhibitor produces the
smallest changes in the (LR) subgraph centrality and (LR) communicability in
relation to the wild protease. In contrast, the weakest inhibitor changes the most
these communicability parameters relative to the unbounded protease. These
results appears to indicate that the potency of these inhibitors could be related
to the fact of not aﬀecting very much the strong inter-residue communicability
of amino acids in the Mpro of SARS CoV-2.
With the goal of disentangling the information contained in the changes
produced at the LR subgraph centrality of the bounded protease we study it in
more detail here. For this, we consider the amino acids displaying the largest
values of this topological parameter for the three structures. In Fig. 6 we
illustrate the region formed by the top 22 amino acids according to their values
of the Zij index, i.e., LR subgraph centrality. The first interesting observation

is that for the three structures considered these amino acids form a connected
subgraph in the main protease. That is, these amino acids displaying the highest
LR subgraph centrality are not randomly distributed around the domains of
the protease but they are located in a specific location of the space. It is also
remarkable that this subgraph is connected, which means that there is no single
amino acid separated at more than 7 Å from all the rest of residues forming the
subgraph. Another remarkable characteristic of these subgraphs of the most
central residues according to LR subgraph centrality is that they are exactly
around the binding site of the main protease. As can be seen in the Fig. 6
these subgraphs of residues are very close to the inhibitors and form a cluster
of amino acids around the catalytic site, which is C145.
In Table 4 we resume the results of the top ranked amino acids according to
the LR subgraph centrality for the free SARS CoV-2 Mpro taken as the average
of the three apo structures previously considered and the three complexes with
inhibitors studied here. As can be seen the top 22 amino acids in the average
free SARS CoV-2 Mpro contains more than 90% of the residues which appear
involved in the interactions with the three inhibitors studied here. In the case
of 6LZE they coincide in 100%, and in 6M0K the coincidence is of 95%.

tation of the three-dimensional structure of the protein as a residue network in
which Cα of every amino acid is represented by a node of the network and two
nodes are connected if the corresponding Cα are at no more than 7.0 Å. We
find here that the diﬀerence between most of the topological properties of the
PRNs representing both proteases diﬀer in less than 5%. If we exclude from the
analysis the LR measures, then 70% of the topological measures shows only a
small variation between the two proteases taking as the average of the properties
of several structures representing each of the two proteases. In this situation
it is certainly remarkable that there are topological measures which change in
more than 1000% from one protease to the other. These are the cases of the LR
subgraph centrality of the amino acids and of the LR communicability between
pairs of them. The increase of these parameters in more than 1900% for SARS
CoV-2 Mpro relative to SARS CoV-1 Mpro means that the structural changes
that diﬀerentiate both proteases have created a huge increment in the eﬃciency
of SARS CoV-2 Mpro in transmitting perturbations of any kind between the
amino acids of the protein using all available routes of connection and allowing
for long-distance transmission. To make clearer what this sensitivity means we
are going to use a simple example. Let us consider a tiny perturbation on the
structure of the proteases which prevent the interaction between the amino acids
P9 and G11, which have been selected at random. In SARS CoV-1 Mpro (taking
2BX4 as an example) these amino acids are at 5.69 Å and in SARS CoV-2 Mpro
(taking 6Y2E as an example) they are 6.48 Å apart. Thus, in both cases they
are connected in the corresponding PRN. Let us consider that the perturbation
remove this edge from the PRN of both proteases. The relative decrement of
the average path length in SARS CoV-2 Mpro relative to SARS CoV-1 Mpro is
almost imperceptible, i.e., 5.7%. In the case of the subgraph centrality it is of
the same order, i.e., 3.4%. This means that according to these parameters SARS
CoV-2 Mpro is as sensitive as SARS CoV-1 Mpro to perceive a structural change
in its structure produced by a given perturbation. However, when we consider
the LR subgraph centrality this relative change is 316.8%. That is, according
to this topological parameter which takes into account long-range interactions,
SARS CoV-2 Mpro is more than three times more sensitive to a tiny structural
change than SARS CoV-1 Mpro . This remarkable finding indicates that the
12 mutations produced in SARS CoV-1 Mpro makes the resulting SARS CoV2 Mpro much more eﬃcient in transmitting “information” through the protein
skeleton using short and long-range routes.is proportional to the absolute value
of this diﬀerence.
The second remarkable finding of the current work is that the largest changes
in the LR subgraph centrality occurring in SARS CoV-2 Mpro relative to SARS
CoV-1 Mpro do not spread equally across the whole structure of the protease.
Instead, they are concentrated around a geometrical region which includes most
of the amino acids involved in the binding site of the protease to inhibitors or
close to it. One of the amino acids which has increased more dramatically its
sensitivity to long-range transmission of information in SARS CoV-2 Mpro is
Cys-145, which is one of the two catalytic sites of the protease, and the one
involved in interactions with the inhibitors, such as the ones analyzed here. We

have analyzed here three diﬀerent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro displaying
very potent inhibitory capacity over the protease. In the three cases we have
observed a significant variation in the LR subgraph centrality of the amino
acids which were previously observed to have increased their LR sensitivity in
the free protease. Therefore, these amino acids corresponds to those involved
in the binding of these three inhibitors, showing that their increased topological
role in the SARS CoV-2 Mpro also may play an important functional role in it.
The analysis of PRN is easier than the study of the whole protein structure.
In this sense the PRN represents a simplified model of the three-dimensional
structure of the protein. Typically, such simplification in the complexity of the
representation of systems convey a loss in the structural information which is
represented by the global system. In this case, however, we have shown that the
use of a network representation of the proteins reveals some hidden patterns in
their structure that were escaping to the analysis by using the global structure.
To detect such important structural factors it is necessary to account for longrange interactions among the amino acids of the proteases, which are the ones
revealing the their most important characteristics in terms of their sensitivity to
tiny structural changes produced by local or global perturbations to the system.
Such LR interactions revealed here the main diﬀerences between the proteases
of SARS CoV-1 and SARS CoV-2, as well as the most important amino acids
for the interaction with inhibitors, which may produce therapeutic candidates
against COVID-19.
