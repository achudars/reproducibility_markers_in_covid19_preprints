ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that

18

started in China at the end of 2019 has rapidly spread to become pandemic. Several investigational

19

vaccines that have already been tested in animals and humans were able to induce neutralizing

20

antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, however protection and long-term efficacy in

21

humans remain to be demonstrated.

22

We have investigated if a virus-like particle (VLP) derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus

23

(MLV) could be engineered to become a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine amenable to mass

24

production. First, we showed that a codon optimized version of the S protein could migrate

25

efficiently to the cell membrane. However, efficient production of infectious viral particles was only

26

achieved with stable expression of a shorter version of S in its C-terminal domain (DS) in 293 cells

27

that express MLV Gag-Pol (293GP). The incorporation of DS was 15-times more efficient into VLPs

28

as compared to the full-length version, and that was not due to steric interference between the S

29

cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid. Indeed, a similar result was also observed with extracellular

30

vesicles released from parental 293 and 293GP cells. The amount of DS incorporated into VLPs

31

released from producer cells was robust, with an estimated 1.25 µg/ml S2 equivalent (S is comprised

32

of S1 and S2). Thus, a scalable platform that has the potential for production of pan-coronavirus VLP

33

vaccines has been established. The resulting nanoparticles could potentially be used alone or as a

34

boost for other immunization strategies for COVID-19.

35

IMPORTANCE Several candidate COVID-19 vaccines have already been tested in humans,

36

but their protective effect and long-term efficacy are uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to continue

37

developing new vaccine strategies that could be more potent and/or that would be easier to

38

manufacture in large-scale. Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are considered highly immunogenic

39

and have been successfully developed for human papilloma virus as well as hepatitis and influenza

40

viruses. In this study, we report the generation of a robust Moloney murine leukemia virus platform

41

that produces VLPs containing the spike of SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine platform that is compatible

42

with lyophilization could simplify storage and distribution logistics immensely.

43

A cluster of severe pneumonia cases emerged in Wuhan in the Chinese province of Hubei in

44

December 2019 and has quickly become a worldwide pandemic. A new virus was later identified as

45

the etiological agent: the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the

46

condition was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (1,

47

2). As of today, September 16th 2020, 29 million people have been infected, and 939,000 deaths have

48

been recorded (gisaid.org), but these numbers are probably well underestimated. In addition to its

49

severe health threat, COVID-19 has profound socioeconomic consequences (3).

50

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus that has been identified so far. HCoV-NL63, HCoV-

51

229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 strains are constantly present in the human population and cause mild

52

common-cold symptoms (4). The other two, SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome

53

(MERS)-CoV, are similar to SARS-CoV2 in that they are highly pathogenic to humans causing acute

54

respiratory disease (5). Two epidemics were caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively:

55

SARS that originated in China in 2002 and MERS which emerged 10 years later in the Middle East.

56

These two viruses did not spread widely as only 8,096 cases were reported for SARS-CoV and 2,494

57

for MERS but had an exceedingly high mortality rate (9-35%). There have been no new cases of

58

SARS-CoV reported since 2004 although MERS is still endemic in the Middle East (6). The three

59

highly pathogenic coronaviruses are zoonotic and have emerged from bats with dromedary camels,

60

palm civet and most likely pangolin being the intermediary host for MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and

61

SARS-CoV-2, respectively (4, 7-13). Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses

62

that are composed of four structural proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid, envelope and membrane (4).

63

The S protein that is about 180 kDa assembles as a trimer at the virus surface. It is composed of two

64

subunits S1 and S2 that are responsible for the virus attachment and fusion. MERS uses dipeptidyl

65

peptidase 4 as its receptor, while SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same receptor for entering

66

cells: the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (13-19).

67

Efforts are being made to identify candidate neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) that could block the

68

interaction of SARS-CoV2-S with its receptor and that could be used for treating infected patients

69

(20-22). Several vaccine strategies for COVID-19 are also intensively pursued, with S protein being

70

the major target (23-25). These vaccines are produced from different platforms: RNA, DNA,

71

recombinant proteins, viral vector-based or virus-like particles (VLPs), and live attenuated and

72

inactivated viruses (23-25).

73

Vaccines made from RNA, DNA or proteins are usually easier to manufacture than those that

74

are virus-derived but it is generally accepted that vaccines made of the original virus (attenuated) or

75

from VLPs induce a better immune response (26). This is an important point to consider as a

76

COVID-19 vaccine ideally should induce high-titer Nabs for a long-lasting period of time.

77

Preliminary results obtained in animals and in humans have shown that both humoral and

78

cellular immune responses can be obtained with different vaccine strategies, and that Nab titers

79

achieved by vaccination in humans were comparable to those measured in the serum of COVID-19

80

convalescent individuals (25, 27-38). A recent study evaluating a DNA vaccine indicated that

81

macaques were protected upon SARS-CoV-2 challenges 13 weeks after vaccination (39). However,

82

only long-term studies in humans will tell us about the efficacy of all these vaccines.

83

VLPs are produced by the assembly of viral proteins that do not contain genetic material, and

84

that are then unable to replicate. VLPs are advantageous for their immunostimulatory activity: they

85

are highly recognized by antigen-presenting cells and the repetitive arrangement of antigens on their

86

surface is capable of inducing both innate and adaptive immune responses with a high level of Nabs

(26). VLPs have already been successfully developed for Human Papilloma Virus, Hepatitis B, E,

88

and A Virus and influenza virus (26).

89

The difficulty of developing COVID-19 vaccines in a short period of time is compounded by

90

the major hurdle of creating mass production capacity to deliver the final product for the entire world

91

population. In this study, we have engineered and characterized a Moloney murine leukemia virus

92

(MLV) VLP platform that has the potential for large-scale production of a COVID-19 vaccine.

93

RESULTS

94

The SARS CoV-2 S protein migrates to the cell surface. The production of an MLV-derived

95

VLP COVID-19 vaccine requires the presence of the carried immunogenic molecule (in our case the

96

S protein) at the surface of the producer cell. As coronaviruses assemble at the ER-Golgi

97

intermediate compartment (4), we had first to verify if the S protein could migrate efficiently to the

98

cell surface. A full-length, codon-optimized S gene as well as a shorter version in which the last 3’ 57

99

nucleotides are lacking were cloned into an expression vector. The rationale for the construction of

100

the latter is based on the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal in the cytoplasmic tail

101

of the coronaviruses S protein and previous reports that a 19-amino acid C-terminal deletion of

102

SARS-CoV S increases the production of MLV or vesicular stomatitis (VSV) infectious particles

103

(40-46). After transfection in 293 cells, both S versions were detected with a very similar intensity at

104

the cell surface (Fig. 1). These results indicated that S was able to efficiently migrate to the cell

105

membrane and that, in these experimental conditions, the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal did

106

not affect its localization.

107

Inefficient transient production of infectious recombinant MLV viruses pseudotyped with

108

the SARS CoV-2 S protein. The production of VLPs pseudotyped with S or DS (VLP-S) was next

109

assessed by generating GFP recombinant viruses in transient transfections. Titers were measured by

110

FACS analysis on 293-ACE2 cells, a cell line generated by stable transfection that is 61% positive

111

for ACE2 (Fig. 2). Titers of 3.2 x 107 infectious units (IU)/ml and 1.5 x 106 IU/ml were obtained for

112

VSV-G- and Galv-pseudotyped viruses, although titers of S and DS-pseudotyped viruses were below

113

the detection limit of 104 IU/ml (Fig. 3A). Only few GFP cells could be observed by fluorescence

114

microscopy after infection with the DS-pseudotyped virus and there were none when the S-

115

pseudotyped vector was used (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results indicated that the transient production was

116

extremely inefficient for generating VLP-S, even with DS.

117

DS-pseudotyped MLV recombinant viral particles are efficiently released from stable

118

producer cells. We have shown that stable retrovirus packaging cell lines can generate Galv-

119

pseudotyped vectors with at least 10-fold higher titers as compared to transient transfection

120

productions (47). We then hypothesized that S or DS stably expressed in 293GP cells (293 cells that

121

express MLV Gag-Pol) could be a better system to produce VLP-S. Stable populations of 293GP

122

cells expressing S and DS were then generated by transfection. In these cells, S and DS were able to

123

localize at the cell surface at even higher levels than what we found in transient transfection (Fig.

124

4A). A GFP retroviral vector was then introduced in these cells by infection (Fig 4B), and titers of

125

GFP viruses released by these new producers were measured after infecting 293-ACE2 cells. Only

126

few GFP positive cells could be detected by fluorescence microscopy after infection of 293-ACE2

127

cells with the S-pseudotyped vector, but a very high percentage of fluorescent cells was observed

128

after infection with the DS virus. A high number of GFP positive cells was seen with the Galv virus

129

diluted 10-times as compared to the two other vectors (Fig. 5A). Titers of 1.6 x 107 IU/ml and 105

130

IU/ml were measured for the Galv and DS-pseudotyped viruses, respectively, and the S-pseudotyped

131

vector titer was below the detection limit of 104 IU/ml, as expected (Fig 5B). We could conclude that

7

132

the production of recombinant viral particles was robust from stable producers expressing DS and

133

inefficient with the full-length version of SARS CoV-2 S.

134

The deletion of the 19 amino acid cytoplasmic tail of S does not enhance its fusogenicity.

135

As producer cells express the same amount of S and DS at the cell surface, one possible explanation

136

for the high transduction efficiency of DS-pseudotyped vectors could be increased fusogenicity. The

137

fusion capacity of S and DS was then assessed in a syncytia formation assay by mixing 293GP cells

138

expressing S or DS with 293-ACE2 cells. The number and the size of syncytia evaluated one day

139

after mixing were very similar between S and DS mixtures, and there were none with the control 293

140

cells (Fig. 6). Thus, the deletion of the 19 amino acids in the S cytoplasmic tail does not have a

141

significant effect on its fusogenicity.

142

High amounts of SARS-CoV-2 DS protein are incorporated into MLV VLPs released

143

from stable producer cells. A VLP-derived SARS CoV-2 vaccine will be a viable option if

144

sufficient amounts of S protein are incorporated at the surface of the released particles. Western blots

145

were performed with an anti-S2 antibody to evaluate the quantity of S protein into VLPs produced in

146

transient transfections and from stable producers. Two bands were detected around 90 KDa that are

147

most likely two glycosylated forms of S2. The uncleaved S protein migrated around 180 kDa, and

148

two other bands above 250 kDa were also detected in the DS samples that had more intense signals.

149

These bands could be dimeric and trimeric forms of S as it has been suggested (19). The amount of

150

S2 detected at the surface of VLPs produced in transient transfections or released from stable

151

producers was much higher with the truncated version of S than with the full-length molecule (Fig.

152

7A). MLV viral particles produced in transient transfection or from stable producers were detected

153

with an antibody against p30. A 4- and a 15-fold difference was found with the transient and the

154

stable production systems, respectively (Fig. 7B), although there was less than a 1.5-fold difference

155

between S and DS in cellular extracts (Fig. 7C). More DS was also released as compared to the full-

156

length protein in the supernatants of stably transfected 293 cells, however the amount of DS detected

157

was 4-to-5 times lower than the one released from the 293GP-DS. The amount of S2 equivalent

158

present in the supernatant of 293GP-DS cells was high and evaluated at 1.25 µg/ml using the IgG-S2

159

standard (Fig. 7A). Our results indicated that the incorporation of S into MLV VLPs is very efficient

160

in stable producers but only with the truncated version of S.

161

SARS-CoV2 DS protein is preferentially incorporated into MLV VLPs versus

162

extracellular vesicles. As stable transfected 293 cells were capable of releasing S or DS, we decided

163

to further characterize the supernatants of the 293GP-DS. We used an iodixanol velocity gradient to

164

discriminate VLPs from extracellular vesicles (EVs) as this technique has been used in the past to

165

successfully separate human immunodeficency viruses (HIV) from EVs (48, 49). Western blots with

166

anti-S2 and anti-p30 antibodies were performed on the collected gradient fractions of 293-DS and

167

293GP-DS supernatants. S2 was detected in the top fractions from the 293-DS supernatant but there

168

were none in the last 3 bottom fractions (Fig. 8A). A similar detection pattern was observed in the top

169

fractions of the supernatant from 293GP-DS, but the majority of S2 came from the 2 bottom fractions

170

in which a band corresponding to the uncleaved S protein was also detected. The p30 signal was

171

present in these two fractions, which indicated that the majority of DS released from 293GP-DS cells

172

was incorporated into VLPs (Fig. 8B).

DISCUSSION
Immunization will be the best preventive strategy to address the current COVID-19 pandemic,

176

although therapeutic alternatives cannot be neglected as an efficient vaccine is not a certainty (23, 25,

177

50). Yet preliminary results from preclinical and clinical studies are encouraging as several types of

178

vaccines are able to trigger the production of Nabs against SARS-CoV-2 S (25, 27-31, 33-39, 51, 52).

179

How efficient and how long these Nabs will be present in vaccinated people remains an open

180

question that will only be answered with time (25). Also, antibody-dependent enhancement will have

181

to be carefully monitored in these trials as it is a side effect that cannot be underestimated with

182

coronaviruses (23, 25, 50). One other major challenge ahead will be the capacity to mass produce

183

COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we have established and characterized a new MLV-derived VLP

184

platform that could be used for the production of a COVID-19 vaccine.

185

The efficient pseudotyping of MLV particles with S is a prerequisite to establish a robust VLP

186

platform. Studies on SARS-CoV and more recently on SARSCoV-2 have shown that the codon

187

optimization of S and the deletion of the ER retention signal located in the cytoplasmic tail are

188

modifications that increase the pseudotyping of MLV, HIV, simian immunodeficiency and VSV viral

189

vectors (40, 46, 53-55). The codon optimization enhances the level of S expression, but the role of

190

the ER retention signal is less clear. Indeed, it was recently reported that the localization of SARS-

191

CoV-2 S at the cell surface was not improved after disrupting the ER retention signal by missense

192

mutations (56). In this study, we showed that S could be detected at the cell surface at a similar level

193

to that achieved by DS in transiently transfected cells as well as in stable producers (Fig. 1 and Fig.

194

4A), a finding that has also been reported for SARS-CoV S expressed in transient transfections (40,

195

54). These results indicate that S can bypass its natural localization and efficiently migrates to the cell

196

surface when it is overexpressed.

197

Despite similar amounts of S and DS at the cellular membrane, the truncated version was more

198

efficiently incorporated into MLV viral particles. Four- and 15-fold differences were obtained with

199

VLPs produced in transient transfection experiments and from stable producers, respectively (Fig.

200

7B). The hypothesis that has been proposed for SARS-COV and SARS-CoV-2 is that the 19 amino-

10

201

acid deletion in the S cytoplasmic tail facilitates the pseudotyping by decreasing the steric

202

interference with the retroviral matrix proteins (54, 55, 57). Our results invalidate this hypothesis as

203

more DS was also found in the supernatant of 293 transfected cells that did not express MLV Gag-Pol

204

(Fig. 7A). Parental 293 and 293GP cells release EVs that can incorporate DS more efficiently than S

205

(Fig. 7A and Fig. 8). VLPs and EVs are very similar in composition, and it has been postulated that

206

they use similar pathways for vesicle trafficking (58, 59). So, unlike S, DS was efficiently

207

incorporated into VLPs or EVs like for example tetraspanins or endosomal markers that are equally

208

found in both particle types (58, 59).

209

EVs released from 293GP-DS contain less than 10% of the total DS protein, and they would not

210

need to be removed from vaccine preparations as they could be as good immunogens as VLPs. It was

211

even reported that EVs containing the S protein of SARS-CoV could induce high levels of Nabs (60).

212

Titers of recombinant GFP retroviruses released from stable producers were at least a 1000-fold

213

higher with DS versus S despite a 15-fold difference in the amount of the two proteins incorporated at

214

the surface of VLPs (Fig. 5A and Fig 7B). As we did not find major differences in fusogenicity

215

between S and DS in a syncytia formation assay (Fig. 6), our results suggest that recombinant viruses

216

become fully infectious when a certain threshold of S protein is incorporated at their surface.

217

Recombinant GFP or luciferase pseudotyped retroviruses are commonly used to measure the

218

activity of Nabs present in serum of infected or vaccinated people (55-57). These reagents are

219

convenient, as unlike SARS-CoV-2 they can be manipulated in a BSL-2 laboratory. The robust

220

production system with the 293GP-DS cell line could be highly valuable to evaluate the presence of

221

Nabs in large cohorts.

222
223

Mass production will be a major challenge with all types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that are
being developed as the entire worldwide population will have to be vaccinated. Based on the results

224

of a nanoparticle vaccine containing S, whose 5 and 25 µg doses triggered a high level of Nabs in

225

people (28), we assume that a vaccine derived from the VLP platform described in this study could

226

be efficient with similar or lower amounts of S per dose. The yield of VLPs produced from the

227

293GP-DS cells could be increased if a high producer clone is selected instead of a bulk population,

228

and if cells are cultured in bioreactors in fed-batch or perfusion modes. The average titer of gene

229

therapy vectors produced with a derivative of the 293GP cell line was increased by 5.6-fold in

230

bioreactor versus a 10-layer cell factory, and the total vector yield was increased by 13.1-fold (61).

231

Mutations of the furin cleavage site located between S1 and S2 and the D614G variant that is now

232

more prevalent in the infected population could increase the amount of S incorporated into VLPs (57,

233

62).

234

A very concise review that compared the first results of different COVID-19 vaccines

235

concluded that the most immunogenic ones were made with recombinant proteins (25). These results

236

emphasize the importance of the platform developed in this study because VLPs present the antigen

237

in a protein format that seems more potent for vaccination than the protein alone. Indeed, MLV VLPs

238

displaying the human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B antigen could trigger 10-times more Nabs in

239

mice than the protein alone using the same amount of antigen (63). Finally, VLP-S could be used as a

240

boost for other types of vaccine like measle virus- and adenovirus-based recombinant vectors. These

241

combinations were highly potent for triggering Nabs against hepatitis C proteins in mice and

242

macaques (64).

243

In conclusion, we have developed and characterized a new MLV VLP platform that can

244

efficiently incorporate the S protein from SARS-CoV-2, and that has the potential to produce a pan-

245

coronavirus vaccine. The next logical step is to validate this vaccine in experimental animals and in

246

humans thereafter.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

248

Plasmids. The expression plasmid pMD2ACE2iPuror containing the human angiotensin-

249

converting enzyme (ACE2) cDNA used to generate ACE2 positive cells was constructed as follows:

250

the ACE2 PmeI cDNA fragment obtained from the plasmid hACE2 (Addgene; #1786) was cloned in

251

pMD2iPuror opened in EcoRV.

252

The SARS-CoV-2 S gene from the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (GenBank: MN908947.3) was codon

253

optimized (Genscript, Township, NJ) and cloned in pMD2iPuror in EcoRI/XhoI. A shorter version with

254

a 19-codon deletion in C-terminal (DS) was also constructed in a similar way.

255

The pMD2.GalviPuror and pMD2.G plasmids that encode the Galv and VSV-G envelopes, and

256

the retroviral vector plasmid containing the GFP gene under the control of the 5’ long terminal repeat

257

sequence have been described elsewhere (65).

258

Cell Lines. 293GP, 293 cells (ATCC, CRL-11268), and their derivatives expressing the ACE2

259

receptor (293-ACE2), S (293GP-S and 293-S), DeltaS (293GP-DS and 293-DS) and the Galv envelope

260

(293GP-Galv) were cultured with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Wisent, Canada)

261

supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Grand island, NY) and antibiotics

262

(Wisent). Bulk populations of 293-ACE2, 293-S, 293- DS, 293GP-S, 293GP-DS and 293GP-Galv were

263

established by transfection using the calcium phosphate procedure. Briefly, subconfluent 293 or 293GP

264

cells plated in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 20 µg of the pMD2 plasmids expressing ACE2, S,

265

DS or Galv. Two days later, cells were selected in puromycin for a period of 10 days (0.5 µg/ml). Bulk

266

populations of 293GP-S/GFP, 293GP-DS/GFP and 293GP-Galv/GFP were generated by infections of

267

the parental cells with a GFP vector pseudotyped with VSV-G produced in transient transfection. The

268

3 derived cell lines were at least 86% GFP positive (Fig. 4B).

269

Virus Productions and Infections. The production of GFP recombinant retroviruses was

270

generated by transient transfection of 293 cells. One day prior transfection, 3 x 106 cells were plated in

271

60-mm dishes. 293 cells were transfected for 4-hours by the calcium phosphate procedure with 1 µg

272

of envelope expression plasmids (pMD2.G, pMD2.GalviPuror, pMD2.SiPuror or pMD2.DSiPuror), 4

273

µg of Gag-Pol expression plasmid (pMD2GPiZeor) and 5 µg of RetroVec plasmid. Two days later, 2.5

274

ml of viral supernatants were harvested and frozen at -800C. Recombinant viruses from stable 293GP-

275

S/GFP, 293GP-DS/GFP and 293GP-Galv/GFP cells were also produced similarly in 60-mm dishes.

276

Transduction efficiency of GFP vectors was determined by scoring fluorescent-positive target

277

cells. 293-ACE2 cells were inoculated at a density of 2 x 105 cells per well in 24-well plates. The

278

next day, the medium from each well was replaced with different volume of viral supernatants

279

containing 8 µg/ml polybrene. Two days later, cells were trypsinized and analyzed by flow

280

cytometry. Vector titers were calculated using the following formula (N x P) x 2/(V x D). N= Cell

281

number on the day of infection; P= percentage of fluorescent-positive cells determined by flow

282

cytometry; V is the viral volume applied; and D is the virus dilution factor. Titers were calculated

283

when the percentage of fluorescent-positive cells was comprised between 2 to 20%. Alternatively,

284

GFP positive cells were assessed under a fluorescent microscope. The 3 x 3 mosaic images of GFP

285

and transmitted light were acquired with a Nikon TI-E inverted microscope with a PlanApo VC 20x

286

0.75 NA objective using a Hamamatsu Orca-ER CCD camera. Acquisition and stitching were

287

performed with the Nikon NIS Elements 5.02 software program. The fluorescence intensity of

288

infected cells displayed in figure 5A were scanned using the Fiji software to evaluate the difference

289

in viral titers (66).

290

Syncytia Formation Assay. 293-ACE2 cells were mixed with 293, 293GP-S and 293GP-DS at

291

a 9/1 ratio and plated at 4 x 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Fusion activity was analyzed 24 h later

292

by phase contrast under the same microscope used for measuring the transduction efficiency.

293

Protein Analysis. The presence of S at the surface of 293 cells was assessed in transient

294

transfections. Subconfluent cells in 6-well plates were transfected for 4 hours with 5 µg of S or DS

295

plasmids by the calcium phosphate procedure, and 24 hours later, the media was replaced with serum-

296

free media (SFM) BalanCD HEK293 (Fujifilm Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). The next day, cells

297

were detached without trypsin by gently pipetting up and down the medium on top of the cells. A

298

human chimeric anti-S1 antibody (Genscript; 1:200 dilution) followed by an Alexa647-conjugated goat

299

anti-human IgG (Jackson Laboratories; 1:400) were successively incubated with cells for labelling.

300

The fixable viability stain 450 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to exclude dead cells.

301

The presence of S was then analyzed by flow cytometry with a BD FACSAria II (BD Biosciences).

302

Cells transfected with a Galv expression plasmid were used as control. The presence of stably

303

expressed S at the cell surface of 293GP-S and 293GP-DS was similarly analyzed by flow cytometry.

304

The presence of ACE2 at the surface of 293-ACE2 cells was also checked by FACS. Detached

305

cells were labelled with a mouse anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN1/200)

306

followed by an Alexa488 goat anti-mouse (1:1,000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

307

The presence of S released in the supernatant of transiently transfected 293GP cells was

308

analyzed by Western blot. Subconfluent cells plated in 60 mm were transfected for 4 h with 5 µg of

309

envelope expression plasmids and 5 µg of the GFP retroviral plasmid. One day later, the media was

310

replaced with 2.5 ml of SFM that was then harvested the following day. Supernatants were

311

concentrated 10-fold with a 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal unit (Millipore Sigma, Oakville, Canada) and

312

were stored at -80oC until use. The GFP fluorescence evaluated under a microscope at the time of

313

harvest was very similar among the different transfected plates.

314
315
316

Supernatants from confluent 293GP-S, 293GP-DS, 293-S and 293-DS cells were also harvested
and concentrated from 60-mm dishes.
Cell pellets of 1 x 106 cells were resuspended in 100 µl RIPA lysis buffer containing a protease

317

inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Samples were centrifuged for 5 min to remove cell debris and stored at -

318

20oC until use for Western blot analysis.

319

Samples of 20 µl were incubated 5 min at 95°C in loading buffer containing 1% SDS and 2.5%

320

b-mercaptoethanol, and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking), followed by transfer

321

onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Immunoblotting was performed with a rabbit

322

polyclonal antibody anti-S2 (1:400 dilution, SinoBiological, Beijing, China) and a rat monoclonal

323

antibody anti-MLV p30 produced from the hybridoma R187 (1:2,000 dilution; American Type

324

Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Blots were then incubated with secondary antibodies

325

IRDylight680 goat anti-rat IgG (1:10,000; Invitrogen) and IRDye 800CW anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000;

326

Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), and analyzed with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor

327

Biosciences). Serial dilutions of known amounts of C-terminally Fc-tagged S2 (BioVendor, Brno,

328

Czech Republic) were used for quantification.

329

Velocity Gradient. Thirty ml of supernatant from confluent 150-mm dishes of 293GP-DS and

330

293-DS cells were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 µ membrane, and concentrated by

331

ultracentrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 x g in a AH629 rotor. Pellets containing virions and EVs

332

were resuspended in 1 ml PBS containing a protease cocktail inhibitor (Roche) during 2 h at 40C. The

333

resuspended vesicles were layered onto a 6-18% Optiprep™ 11-step discontinuous velocity gradient

334

(Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), and centrifuged for 90 min at 176,000 x g in a SW40Ti
