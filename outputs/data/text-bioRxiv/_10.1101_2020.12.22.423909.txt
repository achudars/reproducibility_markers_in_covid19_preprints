Abstract

27

An ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now the greatest threat to

28

the global public health. Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much

29

attention to treat COVID-19, but there has been no natural product showing inhibitory activity

30

against SARS-CoV-2 infection with detailed mechanism. Here, we show that platycodin D

31

(PD), a triterpenoid saponin abundant in Platycodon grandiﬂorum (PG), a dietary and

32

medicinal herb commonly used in East Asia, effectively blocks the two main SARS-CoV-2

33

infection-routes via lysosome- and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-driven entry.

34

Mechanistically, PD prevents host-entry of SARS-CoV-2 by redistributing membrane

35

cholesterol to prevent membrane fusion, which can be reinstated by treatment with a PD-

36

encapsulating agent. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of PD are recapitulated by a

37

pharmacological inhibition or gene-silencing of NPC1, which is mutated in Niemann-Pick type

38

C (NPC) patients displaying disrupted membrane cholesterol. Finally, readily available local

39

foods or herbal medicines containing PG root show the similar inhibitory effects against SARS-

40

CoV-2 infection. Our study proposes that PD is a potent natural product for preventing or

41

treating COVID-19 and that a brief disruption of membrane cholesterol can be a novel

42

therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

49

SARS-CoV-2 expresses spike glycoprotein (S) on their surface and uses it to bind to

50

the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020a; Li et al.,

51

2003). SARS-CoV-2 is known to enter host cells during infection via two pathways: 1) the

52

endocytic pathway followed by a cathepsin B/L-mediated cleavage of S protein in lysosomes,

53

and 2) a direct fusion of the virus envelope with the host plasma membrane after a TMPRSS2-

54

mediated cleavage of S protein (Cai et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020a). The cleavage of S

55

protein by cathepsin B/L or TMPRSS2 or both is the critical step to release the viral RNA into

56

the cytosol of host cells. Therefore, the abundance and availability of the two host proteases,

57

cathepsin B/L and TMPRSS2, and the host receptor, ACE2, are the most critical determining

58

factor for the host susceptibility to COVID-19. For example, chloroquine, a well-known anti-

59

malaria drug, was initially suggested to be a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug due to its ability to

60

block the lysosomal cathepsin-dependent virus-entry by elevating the lysosomal pH (Liu et al.,

61

2020; Wang et al., 2020a). Unfortunately, the most of clinical trials with chloroquine and

62

hydroxychloroquine failed to show beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients (Pathak et al.,

63

2020). The failure of chloroquine was attributed to its inability to block the TMPRSS2-

64

mediated SARS-CoV-2-entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). Subsequently, TMPRSS2 inhibitors

65

such as camostat and nafamostat emerged as the next generation blockers of SARS-CoV-2-

66

entry. However, they also fell short due to their inability to block SARS-CoV-2-entry into

67

certain cell-types that express only ACE2 without TMPRSS2 (Ko et al., 2020; Yamamoto et

68

al., 2020). Therefore, discovery and development of drugs that block both lysosome- and

69

TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2-entry are desperately needed.

70

Herbal medicines and their derived natural products have drawn much attention to treat

71

COVID-19 because they have been shown to possess antiviral properties against a broad range

72

of pathogenic viruses including influenza, HIV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Huang et al.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423909; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

73

2020). To date, numerous natural products have been proposed to inhibit one of the essential

74

components of SARS-CoV-2, including main protease (Mpro), RNA-dependent RNA

75

polymerase (RdRp), ACE2, and TMPRSS2, although most of them are based on in silico

76

screening through molecular docking approaches (Joshi et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Vivek-

77

Ananth et al., 2020). Only very few of them have been verified for their inhibitory activity

78

(Senthil Kumar et al., 2020), and none of them have been reported with detailed molecular

79

mechanism of action. Among thousands of Korean traditional herbal medicines, we have

80

focused on the root of Platycodon grandiﬂorum (PG) (Figure 1A), which has been described

81

in the Dongui Bogam, the most famous 17th century Korean medical textbook (Song et al.,

82

2016). The Dongui Bogam reports that PG can be used to treat patients with disorders in

83

respiratory tracts and the lung, the major target sites of SARS-CoV-2 (Ziegler et al., 2020).

84

Even in the present day, PG is widely used in East Asia including Korea, China, and Japan to

85

treat several respiratory diseases such as asthma, airway inflammation, and sore throats (Choi

86

et al., 2009; Ishimaru et al., 2013; Shin et al., 2002). Several studies have demonstrated that

87

the root of PG is enriched with platycodin D (PD) (Figure 1B), a glycosylated triterpenoid

88

saponin (colored in blue; Figure 1B), which is the major active natural product in mediating

89

those biological activities (Nyakudya et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). Recently, PD has been

90

reported to exhibit a potent antiviral activity against Type 2 porcine reproductive and

91

respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Kim et al., 2013; Zhang et

92

al., 2018). However, its inhibitory activity against coronaviruses and its mechanism of action

93

have not been explored. In this study, we set out to investigate whether PG and PD show an

94

anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2-

95

entry.

97

Results

98

PD, a triterpenoid saponin present in Platycodon grandifloras, has a specific inhibitory

99

activity against SARS-CoV-2 entry.

100

To test for an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, we first developed a SARS-CoV-2

101

pseudovirus (pSARS-CoV-2), which carried the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-2 on the

102

HIV-based lentiviral particles and the luciferase gene as a reporter (Crawford et al., 2020), to

103

mimic the S protein of the native SARS-CoV-2 virus and retain its ability to bind to the host

104

cell surface receptors for viral infection. We then examined whether PG and PD can prevent

105

pSARS-CoV-2-entry into H1299, a human lung cell line known to be susceptible to

106

coronavirus infection (Tay et al., 2012). Luciferase activity assay after infection with pSARS-

107

CoV-2 revealed that virus-entry into H1299 required overexpression of ACE2 (ACE2+)

108

(Figure S1). In ACE2+, we found that 1-hour treatment with PG and PD effectively reduced

109

pSARS-CoV-2-entry in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory

110

concentration (IC50) of 5.01 mg/ml (Figure 1C) and 0.69 μM (Figure 1D), respectively. In

111

contrast, PD did not block the entry of the control lentiviral particles driven by the glycoprotein

112

(G proteins) of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Figure 1E). PD showed no cytotoxic

113

effect on H1299 per se at the tested concentrations (Figure 1F). These results indicate that the

114

inhibitory effect of PD on virus-entry requires both S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in

115

the host cells. To test the specificity of PD among other saponins, we compared it with

116

ginsenosides, which are a group of saponins from Panax ginseng, also known as Korean

117

ginseng. Ginsenosides are known to exhibit antiviral activity against multiple types of virus

118

such as rhinovirus, influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis virus, and herpesvirus (Im et al., 2016). In

119

the pSARS-CoV-2 entry assay, none of the ginsenosides we tested including Rb1, Rg3, and

120

ginsenoside mixture, prevented pSARS-CoV-2 from entering ACE2+ (Figure 1G-I),

121

suggesting that PD, a triterpenoid saponin only present in Platycodon grandifloras, possesses

a specific inhibitory activity against infection of SARS-CoV-2.

123
124

Herbal medicine and foods containing PG inhibit both lysosome and TMPRSS2-mediated

125

SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways through the action of PD

126

To determine which one of the two entry pathways is the target of PD, we prepared

127

additional cell lines, H1299 and HEK293T, overexpressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2

128

(ACE2/TMPRSS2+) and compared the inhibitory effect of various drugs with ACE2+. We

129

found that E64d and chloroquine, inhibitors of lysosomal cathepsins, effectively blocked

130

pSARS-CoV-2-entry only in ACE2+, but not in ACE2/TMPRSS2+, whereas camostat and

131

nafamostat,

132

ACE2/TMPRSS2+, but not in ACE2+ (Figure 2A, B). In contrast, 5 mM PD completely

133

inhibited pSARS-CoV-2 entry in both ACE2/TMPRSS2+ and ACE2+. (Figure 2A, B). The

134

actual potency of PD for inhibition of pSARS-CoV-2-entry in terms of IC50’s in

135

ACE2/TMPRSS2+ was determined to be 0.72 mM (Figure 2C), which was almost identical to

136

that in ACE2+ (Figure 1D). These results suggest that PD targets any one of the events that is

137

common to both entry pathways.

Yonggaksan (YGS, Figure 2D), whose main ingredient is an extract powder from the

PG root, has been available as an over-the-counter medicine and used for treatment of phlegm,

140

cough, and sore throat for more than 50 years in Korea and 200 years in Japan. Thus, we

141

examined whether YGS can be a potential nonprescription medicine to block SARS-CoV-2

142

infection. We found that a dilute solution of YGS effectively inhibited pSARS-CoV-2-entry

143

into both ACE2+ and ACE2/TMPRSS2+ in a dose-dependent manner with similar IC50’s of

144

3.17 mg/ml in ACE2+ (Figure 2E) and 3.72 mg/ml in ACE2/TMPRSS2+ (Figure 2F),

145

suggesting a therapeutic potential of YGS for SARS-CoV-2. Another main ingredient of YGS

146

is an extract powder from the liquorice roots, whose active compound is glycyrrhizin with an

147

inhibitory action in replication and penetration of SARS-CoV (Cinatl et al., 2003) and a

148

suggested therapeutic potential for COVID-19 (Luo et al., 2020). Thus, we tested the effect of

149

glycyrrhizin as well as isoliquiritigenin, other major components of liquorice roots, on the entry

150

of pSARS-CoV-2. We found that both compounds exhibited no significant inhibitory activity

151

against pSAR-CoV-2-entry in both ACE2+ and ACE2/TMPRSS2+ (Figure 2G, H). Moreover,

152

mixing the two compounds with 1 mM PD did not either enhance or reduce pSARS-CoV-2-

153

entry in ACE2+ (Figure 2I). Quantification of components in YGS by high performance liquid

154

chromatography (HPLC) further revealed that PD is the main active compound of YGS to

155

block pSARS-CoV-2-entry (Figure S2, S3). The common daily dosage and regimen of YGS

156

are by taking one spoonful (0.3 gram) of YGS powder on the throat surface without water,

157

waiting for 20 ~ 30 minutes, and repeating 3 ~ 6 times a day. To mimic this usage, we treated

158

the cells with YGS four times for 20 min each time at 4-hour interval before adding pSARS-

159

CoV-2 (Figure 2J). Under this dosage and regimen, YGS effectively reduced pSARS-CoV-2-

160

entry with similar IC50’s of 13.49 mg/ml in ACE2+ (Figure 2K) and 15.26 mg/ml in

161

ACE2/TMPRSS2+ (Figure 2L). Taken together, these results suggest that YGS, through the

162

action of PD, can be a high potential, nonprescription, over-the-counter medicine to fight

163

against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

164

In Korean culture, the root of PG is often served as a side dish in daily meals. For

165

example, PG syrup (PGS) has been considered as a folk remedy for relieving several symptoms

166

of respiratory diseases. PGS (Figure 2M) is prepared by chopping PG roots (Figure 1A) into

167

small pieces and marinating them in sugar or honey for several months to be mixed with warm

168

water and served as a drink. To test if PGS also shows inhibitory effect on pSARS-CoV-2-

169

entry, we treated ACE2+ and ACE2/TMPRSS2+ with serial three-fold dilutions of PGS stock

170

solution containing 15 mg/ml of the PG root for 1 h, before infection of pSARS-CoV-2. We

171

found that PGS effectively inhibited pSARS-CoV-2-entry with similar IC50’s of 2.91 mg/ml

172

(Figure 2N) in ACE2+ and 3.69 mg/ml in ACE2/TMPRSS2+ (Figure 2O). Moreover, HPLC

173

analysis demonstrated that PD is the main active compound in PG root with inhibitory activity

174

against pSARS-CoV-2-entry (Figure S2, S3). These results suggest that even dietary foods

175

containing PG roots might also have beneficial effects on COVID-19 patients.

176
177

PD blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry by preventing cholesterol-dependent membrane fusion.

178

To delineate the detailed molecular and cellular mechanism of PD action, we explored

179

two possible events that are common to both entry pathways; 1) the initial binding of S protein

180

to ACE2 at the plasma membrane and 2) the fusion of viral membrane onto host-cell membrane

181

for the entry of viral RNA into the cytosol of host cell. Of the two events, we eliminated the

182

possibility of PD influencing a specific interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2

183

by using the GFP-tagged receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein and FACS analysis

184

(Figure 3A). We then investigated the possible mechanism of PD action during the membrane

185

fusion. It has been reported that PD helps lower cholesterol levels in the mouse model of

186

hypercholesterolemia (Zhao et al., 2006) and that depletion of membrane cholesterol content

187

inhibits TMPRSS2-mediated coronavirus-fusion (Wang et al., 2020b; Zang et al., 2020; Zu et

188

al., 2020), raising a possibility that PD directly influences the membrane cholesterol content to

189

disturb membrane fusion. To test the role of cholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we performed

190

the entry assay with the ACE2+ grown in lipoprotein-free culture media and compared to the

191

control media. Lipoprotein-free culture conditions caused a significant reduction of pSARS-

192

CoV-2 entry in ACE2+ (Figure 3B) and a significant depletion of cholesterol in plasma

193

membrane as well as in other intracellular compartments revealed by staining of ACE2+ with

194

filipin-III, a fluorescent dye that binds to free cholesterol (Figure 3C). These results support

195

the idea that PD’s inhibitory action on SARS-CoV-2 entry could be due to its effect on the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423909; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

196

membrane cholesterol.

197

As another example of disrupted cholesterol trafficking, we explored the cellular

198

model of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), which is characterized by a redistribution of free

199

cholesterol from the plasma membrane and an accumulation in the late endosome and lysosome

200

compartment (Carstea et al., 1997). NPC is caused by loss-of-function mutations in either

201

NPC1 or NPC2 gene (Sleat et al., 2004). After generating NPC1 or NPC2 specific shRNA

202

(Figure 3D), we performed pSARS-CoV-2-entry assay and found that gene-silencing of NPC1

203

or NPC2 by each shRNA caused a significant reduction in pSARS-CoV-2 entry in ACE+

204

(Figure 3E). Staining with filipin-III showed the expected altered trafficking of membrane

205

cholesterol and accumulated endolysosomal cholesterol (Figure 3F). We next utilized

206

U18666A, a well-known inhibitor of NPC1 to pharmacologically disturb the membrane

207

cholesterol. U18666A is known to inhibit NPC1 function by directly binding to sterol-sensing

208

domain of NPC1 protein (Lu et al., 2015). Furthermore, treatment with U18666A has been

209

shown to disrupt the entry of a variety of enveloped viruses, including Dengue virus, Ebola

210

virus, Hepatitis C virus, Influenza A virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and HIV (Salata et

211

al., 2017), as well as coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-

212

related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Type I Feline Coronavirus (F-CoV) (Takano et al., 2017;

213

Wrensch et al., 2014). We found that 12-hour treatment with 10 mM U18666A completely

214

blocked pSARS-CoV-2-entry in both ACE2+ and ACE2/TMPRSS2+ (Figure 3G). Intriguingly,

215

the slow time course of blocking effect by U18666A on pSARS-CoV-2-entry in

216

ACE2/TMPRSS2+ (Figure 3H) coincided very well with the slow time course of the

217

disappearance of membrane cholesterol (Figure 3I). This slow time course of U18666A was

218

in marked contrast to the fast-acting effect of PD (Figure 3H). These results suggest that

219

disturbing the membrane cholesterol can be an effective target to block SARS-CoV-2-entry.

220

To test if PD blocks SARS-CoV-2-entry by disrupting the membrane cholesterol, we

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423909; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

221

utilized methyl β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), whose doughnut-shaped structure makes it a natural

222

complexing agent that can encapsulate cholesterol and other large molecules such as hormones,

223

vitamins and natural hydrophobic macro-compounds (Dai et al., 2017). It has been

224

demonstrated that when cells are exposed to high concentration of MβCD (5-10 mM) for more

225

than 2 hours, 80–90% of total cellular cholesterol can be removed (Zidovetzki and Levitan,

226

2007). However, at much lower concentrations and 1-hour incubation time, MβCD should not

227

encapsulate cholesterol. Indeed, under the condition of 100 mM and 1-hour incubation time,

228

MβCD treatment showed no significant effect on pSARS-CoV-2-entry in ACE2+ (Figure 3J).

229

Under the same condition, MβCD completely reverted the blocking effect of PD on pSARS-

230

CoV-2-entry to the level of control DMSO condition (Figure 3J). PD alone induced a dramatic

231

redistribution of membrane and endolysosomal cholesterol (Figure 3K), which was somewhat

232

different from the U18666A’s effect (Figure 3I, 12 h). These results indicate that 100 mM

233

MβCD completely sequestered 5 mM PD, without affecting the membrane cholesterol content.

234

Indeed, staining with filipin-III showed no alteration of membrane cholesterol by 100 mM

235

MβCD alone, a significant redistribution of membrane cholesterol by 5 mM PD, and complete

236

reversion by 100 mM MβCD plus 5 mM PD condition (Figure 3J).

237

To understand the detailed molecular mechanisms of how PD prevents pSARS-CoV-

238

2-entry at the level of chemical structure of PD, we utilized the dynamic molecular modelling

239

techniques. Based on the previously reported crystal structure of cholesterol-βCD

240

encapsulation complex (Figure 4A) (Christoforides, 2018), we performed a homology-

241

modeling of cholesterol-MβCD and PD-MβCD complexes (Figure 4D, E) and calculated the

242

binding energy for each molecular pair in terms of Glide G score and Molecular

243

Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) free energy scores (Figure 4F). We

244

found that out of 21 hydroxyl groups in βCD (Figure 4B), 12 ~ 18 hydroxyl groups could be

245

methylated at different positions, while MβCD with 14 methyl groups showed the greatest

246

encapsulating capacity. Therefore, we chose tetradeca-2,6-O-methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Figure

247

4C) as the representative MβCD to model the cholesterol-MβCD and PD-MβCD complexes.

248

The cholesterol-MβCD encapsulation complex was formed by two MβCD molecules arranged

249

co-axially, forming a head-to-head dimer via intra-molecular hydrogen bonds and one

250

cholesterol molecule fitted snugly in the hydrophobic cavity of MβCD, whose methoxymethyl

251

groups encapsulated cholesterol better in comparison to the cholesterol-βCD complex (Figure

252

4D). In the PD-MβCD encapsulation complex, the hydrophobic core of PD fitted well into the

253

MβCD host dimer, whereas PD’s hydrophilic sugar tail was fully exposed to the solvent

254

(Figure 4E). Overall, the molecular modeling of MβCD, PD, and cholesterol revealed that a

255

homodimer of MβCD snugly encapsulated PD and cholesterol with a higher affinity to PD than

256

cholesterol (Figure 4F), supporting the possibility that MβCD preferentially sequesters PD

257

over cholesterol. In particular, the predicted orientation of PD revealed that the hydrophobic

258

triterpenoid saponin moiety of PD was completely encapsulated within the homodimeric

259

MβCD capsule, whereas the hydrophilic sugar moiety was extruded through a hole of the

260

capsule (Figure 4E). A similar molecular modeling of membrane-inserted PD and cholesterol

261

in an explicit lipid bilayer model also predicted the similar orientation of the partly-embedded

262

PD and fully-embedded cholesterol (Figure 4G). In particular, unlike cholesterol, the

263

hydrophilic sugar moiety of PD was sticking out of the lipid bilayer (Figure 4G), creating a

264

protrusion on the surface of membrane, which might act as a hindrance to membrane fusion.

265

Furthermore, none of other natural triterpene compounds without any sugar moiety but with

266

similar backbone structure as PD, including echinocystic acid, oleanolic acid, and ursolic acid,

267

showed inhibitory activity against pSARS-CoV-2 entry (Figure 4H, I) and altered distribution

268

of membrane cholesterol (Figure 4J), implying that the sugar moieties attached to the saponin

269

backbone of PD might be responsible for its action against pSARS-CoV-2-entry via altering

270

membrane cholesterol. These results raise a strong possibility that PD might prevent membrane

271

fusion in a cholesterol-dependent manner.

272
273

PD inhibits exocytosis-mediated membrane fusion

274

As a proof-of-concept experiment, we tested the effect of PD on the well-known

275

membrane fusion event of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSC) in acute brain

276

slices. We performed slice patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons

277

(Figure 5A) and recorded sIPSCs before and during an application of PD (Figure 5B). We

278

found that PD effectively inhibited the frequency of sIPSC without affecting the amplitude

279

(Figure 5C, D). The time course of the inhibition by PD was relatively fast with about 10-15

280

second after the onset (Figure 5C). The concentration-response relationship showed that PD

281

effectively inhibited sIPSC frequency with IC50 of 6.724 μM, whereas PD did not inhibit the

282

amplitude of sIPSC (Figure 5E, F). These results support the idea that PD’s inhibitory action

283

on pSARS-CoV-2-entry might be due to its ability to interfere with membrane fusion. What is

284

the possible inter-molecular relationship between PD and cholesterol? Cholesterol appears to

285

assist PD in incorporating into membrane as evidenced by a 2.5-fold increase in IC50 value for

286

inhibition of pSARS-CoV-2-entry under lipoprotein-free condition (Figure S4). Taken together,

287

these results strongly suggest that PD blocks pSARS-CoV-2-entry via interacting with

288

cholesterol and preventing membrane fusion of viral membrane onto host-cell membrane.

290

PD inhibits authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero and Calu-3 cells.

291

As a final measure, we evaluated the antiviral activity of PD on the authentic SARS-

292

CoV-2 viruses obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We

293

performed immunocytochemistry-based assessment of the infection of SARS-CoV-2, using an

294

antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N protein, as previously described (Ko et al.,

295

2020). Infected host cells were automatically counted using an in-house image analysis

296

software. For the host cells, we utilized both monkey-originated Vero and human-originated

297

Calu-3 cell lines, whose western-blot analysis showed abundant expression of ACE2 in both

298

cell types, the lack of TMPRSS2 expression in Vero cells, and high expression of TMPRSS2

299

in Calu-3 cells (Figure 6A). We found that PD caused a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-

300

2 infection in both TMPRSS2-negative Vero and TMPRSS2-postive Calu-3 with IC50’s of 1.19

301

mM and 4.76 mM, respectively (Figure 6B-D). YGS also effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2

302

infection into Vero cells with IC50 of 10.9 mg/ml (Figure 6C, D). These IC50 values obtained

303

from the authentic SARS-CoV-2 were within the similar range as those IC50 values obtained

304

from pSARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C, 2C), indicating that PD is equally effective against the

305

authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Unlike other previously reported drugs (Table 1), PD shows

306

the unique property of equal high potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection in both TMPRSS-

307

negative Vero and TMPRSS-positive Calu-3 cells. This is in marked contrast to other drugs,

308

which show only one-sided potency in either TMPRSS-negative Vero (chloroquine) or

309

TMPRSS-positive Calu-3 (camostat, nafamostat). Taken together, these results indicate that

310

PD has an important advantage over other known drugs in that it can potently prevent SARS-

311

CoV-2 infection by inhibiting both lysosome- and TMPRSS2-driven SARS-CoV-2-entry

312

pathways at the common process of viral membrane fusion by disrupting the host-cell

313

membrane cholesterol (Figure 7).

Discussion

316

SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 and enters into host cells via membrane fusion after

317

proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein by 1) cathepsin B/L in the lysosomal membrane

318

or 2) TMPRSS2 in the plasma membrane. We have demonstrated that PD effectively inhibits

319

both of the SARS-CoV-2-entry pathways almost equally in ACE+ and ACE/TMPRSS2+ cells

320

with IC50’s ranging from 0.69 mM to 4.76 mM against both pseudo- and authentic-SARS-CoV-

321

2 viruses. To the best of our knowledge, PD is the first single compound that simultaneously

322

blocks the two main pathways of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the 1st generation inhibitor,

323

chloroquine was introduced as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However,

324

clinical trials with this drug have mostly failed because it blocks only cathepsin-mediated viral

325

entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). To date, TMPRSS2 inhibitors such as camostat and nafamostat

326

have been considered as the 2nd generation inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2-entry. However, it has

327

been recently reported that they are not effective in preventing viral entry into TMPRSS2-

328

negative cells (Ko et al., 2020). Thus, we propose PD as the next generation inhibitor of SARS-

329

CoV-2 infection, which blocks both of the entry pathways with much higher potency than the

330

existing drug candidates such as chloroquine, camostat, and nafamostat.

331

One of the highlights of our study is that PD alters the distribution of membrane

332

cholesterol, which contributes to PD’s anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our finding is consistent

333

with the very recent reports showing that 25-hydrocholesterol (25-HC) has antiviral effect on

334

SARS-CoV-2 infection by accumulating cholesterol in the late endosomes and potentially

335

restricting the S-protein-mediated membrane-fusion via depletion of membrane cholesterol

336

(Wang et al., 2020b; Zang et al., 2020; Zu et al., 2020). These reports strongly support our

337

notion that alteration of membrane cholesterol can be an effective strategy to prevent SARS-

338

CoV-2 infection. However, it is still unclear how PD interacts with membrane cholesterol and

339

inhibits membrane fusion. Although a pharmacological inhibition of NPC caused a depletion

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423909; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

340

of membrane cholesterol (Figure 3I), PD did not deplete membrane cholesterol (Figure 3K).

341

These results raise a possibility that PD’s action mechanism involves cholesterol-independent

342

mechanism. On the other hand, PD’s potency decreases by 2.5 fold when cholesterol was

343

depleted (Figure S4), suggesting that cholesterol might help PD as PD intercalates into

344

membrane. Based on the molecular modeling, one can make a reasonable prediction that PD

345

and cholesterol behave similarly because the hydrophobic triterpenoid saponin moiety of PD

346

and cholesterol show similar size and hydrophobicity. The major structural difference comes

347

from the fact that PD contains an additional elaborate sugar moiety that is strongly hydrophilic

348

due to the multiple hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety, which cholesterol lacks. This raises

349

an interesting possibility that while PD behaves similarly as cholesterol within the lipid bilayer,

350

PD behaves profoundly different outside the lipid bilayer, creating a physical hindrance due to

351

the elaborate sugar tail that extends out from the membrane (Figure 4G). Considering the fact

352

that the thickness of lipid bilayer is about 10 nm, the sugar tail of PD could extend out by about

353

2-3 nm (Figure 4G). Such conspicuous protrusions on the membrane could greatly hinder any

354

membrane fusion events that require a close proximity and direct contact between two

355

membrane structures, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 membrane and host-cell membrane. A classic

356

example of such fusion event is the synaptic release due to a membrane fusion of synaptic

357

vesicle membrane onto presynaptic terminal membrane during the exocytosis. Indeed, we

358

found that PD can also inhibit the synaptic release event due to membrane fusion (Figure 5),

359

supporting our hypothesis that PD’s sugar-tail-protrusion hinders membrane fusion. Future

360

investigations are needed to systematically test this exciting possibility.

361

Recent studies have revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in nasal

362

epithelial cells with lesser amounts in the lung tissues (Hou et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020).

363

These reports provide a plausible explanation for why viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper

364

respiratory tract peaks before the onset of symptoms and why presymptomatic transmission

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423909; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

365

occurs. Therefore, reducing the viral load in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients

366

at the early and asymptomatic stages must be the most effective strategy to stop the current

367

pandemic. Here, we tested an anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity of Yonggaksan (YGS), a

368

commercially available herbal medicine containing PG as the main ingredient and obtained

369

IC50’s of 3.17 and 3.72 mg/ml for ACE2+ and ACE2/TMPRSS2+ with pSARS-CoV-2,

370

respectively, and 10.9 mg/ml in Vero cells with authentic SARS-CoV-2. The formulation of

371

YGS is a fine powder and the traditional usage of YGS is to apply a spoonful of 300 mg YGS

372

on the throat membrane without drinking water and wait for several minutes. Through this

373

unique formulation and usage, an effective PD concentration can be reached at regions around

374

throat mucus membrane and along the epithelium lining of upper respiratory airways.

375

Alternatively, if applicable, PD can be easily and directly administered into the nose in the form

376

of nasal drops or spray for a therapeutic purpose. These ideas should be tested immediately in

377

animal models and COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we suggest that PG-containing herbal

378

medicines or foods as well as PD compound itself can be a promising therapeutic option to

379

exert a powerful brake on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within and between individuals.

380

It has been predicted that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from the bat-originated

381

SARS-CoV is probably due to naturally occurring mutations during its natural course of spread

382

(Menachery et al., 2015). Such an alarming concept forebodes further emergence of more

383

virulent versions of SARS-CoV-2. However, what is comforting from our study is that Mother

384

Nature has already prepared natural products such as PD, which is capable of protecting human

385

kind from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This raises an important point that it might be advantageous

386

to find a cure from the vastly diverse natural products in addition to developing vaccines, which

387

might become ineffective when new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerges (Menachery et al.,

388

2015).

Molecular modelling of MβCD inclusion complexes

685

Schrodinger Maestro software 2017 suite (Maestro, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY) was

686

used to prepare and score the MβCD binding complexes. The software tools were applied using

687

the default settings and pH 7.4, unless stated otherwise below. The binding complex models

688

were prepared based on the crystal structure of the β-cyclodextrin (βCD) cholesterol inclusion

689

complex (CSD entry: KEXQUC) (Christoforides et al., 2018). The crystal structure of

690

tetradeca-2,6-O-methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CSD entry: BOYFOK03) (Stezowski et al., 2001) was

691

used to represent MβCD in the binding complex. Both crystal structures were obtained from

692

the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and all water molecules were removed. The ligands

693

cholesterol and PD were drawn in ChemDraw Professional 16.0 and imported as structure data

694

files into the Maestro LigPrep module.

695

for further use: determine the ligand partial charges, optimize the geometry and perform energy

696

minimization using the OPLS3 force field. The MβCD binding complexes were prepared using

697

the βCD-cholesterol complex as a template. First, the atomic coordinates of the two template

698

βCD units were copied onto two corresponding MβCD units. Cholesterol was added inside the

699

complex by copying atomic coordinates of the template guest cholesterol molecule, whereas

700

PD was placed using a rigid alignment, maximum common structure molecular overlay tool.

701

To account for the increase of the macrocycle size, as well as remove molecular strain and

703

algorithm was applied using the OPLS3 force field and heavy atom RMSD restriction of 2 Å.

704

The obtained ligand binding poses were scored in place by the Glide SP (standard precision)

705

dock score and afterwards the relative ligand binding affinity was estimated by the Prime MM-

706

GBSA tool with a variable-dielectric generalized Born (VDGB) continuum solvation model

707

and OPLS3 force field. The binding affinity is calculated using the equation:

708

∆Gbind=Ecomplex(minimized)-(Eligand(minimized) + Ehost(minimized)). More negative scores indicate stronger

709

binding. The binding complex visualization was done using the Discovery Studio Client 2020

PD and cholesterol orientation in the cell membrane

714

The Discovery Studio Client 2020 package (Dassault Systèmes; BIOVIA. Discovery Studio

715

Modeling Environment; Release 2020; Dassault Systèmes: San Diego, CA, 2020) was used to

716

optimize the position and orientation of PD and cholesterol in an explicit membrane bilayer,

717

consisting

718

molecules. Before running the membrane addition and molecule orientation algorithm, the 3D

719

conformations of PD and cholesterol were prepared using the standard ligand preparation

720

protocol and energy minimized with the general CHARMm force field. The molecules were

721

first re-oriented to an implicit membrane by doing a step-wise search for the minimum

722

solvation energy of the molecule, which was calculated by the charmm36 force field and

723

Generalized Born Implicit Membrane (GBIM) module. The membrane thickness was set to 35

724

Å. After finding the optimal molecule position in the implicit membrane, the lipid bilayer was

725

constructed by adding the POPE lipid molecules, water molecules and counterions (Na+ and
