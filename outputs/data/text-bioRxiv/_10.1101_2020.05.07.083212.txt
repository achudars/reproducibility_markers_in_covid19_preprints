Abstract
Since it was first observed in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a global emergency
for national health systems due to millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of
deaths. At a molecular level, the bottleneck for the infection is the binding of the receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein to ACE2, an enzyme exposed on human cell membranes.
Several experimental structures of the ACE2:RBD complex have been made available, however
they offer only a static description of the arrangements of the molecules in either the free or bound
states. In order to gain a dynamic description of the binding process that is key to infection, we use
molecular simulations with a coarse grained model of the RBD and ACE2. We find that binding
occurs in an all-or-none way, without intermediates, and that even in the bound state, the RBD
exhibits a highly dynamic behaviour. From short equilibrium simulations started in the unbound
state we provide snapshots that result in a tentative mechanism of binding. Our findings may be
important for the development of drug discovery strategies that target the RBD.

The spillover of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to
humans has resulted in the coronavirus disesease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [1]. The
number of cases around the planet has skyrocketed in multiple countries, causing major
disruptions and hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world. This crisis has
spurred titanic efforts from the scientific community in order to develop therapies to
combat the disease and prevent future outbreaks. In particular, structural biologists have
been quick to resolve the 3D coordinates of a few of the viral proteins, including among
others its main protease [2], the Nsp15 endoribonuclease [3], and the spike protein [4‚Äì8].
These efforts provide invaluable detail of the molecular machinery involved in the viral
infection cycle, which is essential for the development of effective drugs.
Among the therapeutic strategies aiming to stop the pandemic, much work is being
devoted to target the interaction between the trimeric spike protein (or protein S) to the
host receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [9, 10]. The binding between
both proteins precedes membrane fusion and may be the Achilles heel of the virus.
The spike first engages with the host cell when it interacts with ACE2 via the very mobile
receptor binding domain (RBD) of one of its monomers in its ‚Äúup‚Äù state [4]. The interaction
between the RBD and ACE2 buries an extended surface of ‚àº1700 √Ö2 involving a coiled coil
formed by two long helices of ACE2 and a loosely packed binding motif in the RBD (see
Figure 1). The structure for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to ACE2 bears close resemblance
to that of the same complex for the previous SARS-CoV virus [11]. However, there is
evidence that the greater infectivity of the new virus may be determined at least in part
by the ‚àº10-20-fold higher binding affinity for ACE2 [4] (although estimates differ among
groups, see Supplementary Information Fig. S1).
In order to better understand viral infection and design ways to hƒ≥ack it, it is important to understand the mechanism of binding between the spike protein and ACE2. This
information is not readily available from the static X-ray and cryo-EM experimental structures. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are ideally posed to provide this picture.
However, simulating protein-protein binding using atomistic MD even for small proteins
is exceedingly time-consuming even for much smaller systems than the RBD:ACE2 complex [12, 13]. Alternatively, one may resort to coarse-grained structure-based (GoÃÑ) models,
whose potential energy minimum is located by construction in the reference experimental
structure [14]. In this way, these models are consistent with the central prescription of a

minimally frustrated, funnelled energy landscape of protein folding theory [15]. In the
past, GoÃÑ models have been applied successfully to the study of protein-protein binding
for complexes involving both folded and disordered proteins [16, 17].
In this work, we use the structure-based simulation model by Karanicolas and Brooks,
which is coarse-grained to the Cùõº level [18] (see details in the Supplementary Methods
section). We built models using a recently determined 2.45 √Ö resolution X-ray structure
of the ACE2:RBD complex (with PDB ID: 6m0j [5], see Figure 1A). Although we take into
consideration both the disulfide bonds and Zn(II) interactions in our simulations we do
not consider glycosilation effects. Among the 22 predicted N-glycosylation sites in the
spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [19], only the highly conserved glycosylation site N343 is in
the RBD, and this is located far from the interaction region [11]. It is also relevant to note
that a second glycosylation site in the RBD of the SARS-CoV spike (N357) is lost in SARS3

CoV-2 [19]. The energy terms in the model were calibrated carefully in order to recover
a value of ùêæ D at 300 K in the experimental range (i.e. tens of nM, see Supplementary
Information Fig. S1).
First, we run replica exchange molecular simulations (REMD) of the RBD in presence
of the ACE2 receptor. We used 32 replicas for temperatures ranging between 285 and 378
K , using a Langevin dynamics integrator with a 10 fs time-step and a friction constant of
0.2 ps‚àí1 using the Gromacs software package [20]. The resulting 2 ùúás of simulation data at
each temperature were projected on an order parameter for binding, the logarithm of the
ùëëRMS , that collapses the unbound state into a narrow well and expands the bound state
(see Supplementary Methods). The simulations are well converged, as shown by cumulative averages that do not change after 0.8 ùúás at each temperature (see Supplementary
Information Fig. S2).

FIG. 3. Representative transition path for a binding transition between RBD and ACE2. We show
the projection of the simulation data on the log(ùëëRMS ) for all contacts (dark blue) or different
subsets of interprotein contacts, either involving the ridge or not (light and dark red, respectively).
Snapshots at different time-points are shown at the top. Colors as in Fig. 1. The thicker region in
the RBD corresponds to the ridge.

In Figure 2A we show potentials of mean force derived using the weighted histogram
analysis method WHAM [21]. The free energy surface suggests that the RBD:ACE2 complex formation occurs in an all-or-none way, with a dominant free energy barrier between
the bound and unbound states. Despite the absence of stable intermediates, the bound
state has a small intra-state barrier. The presence of two sub-basins in the bound state with
average values of log(ùëëRMS ) of ‚àí0.45 and ‚àí0.75 is also apparent in the two dimensional
free energy landscape we show in Figure 2B, including also a folding coordinate for the
RBD, the fraction of native contacts (ùëÑ RBD , see Supplementary Methods).
Hence, the free energy landscapes suggest some degree of heterogeneity in RBD even
in the bound state. In Figure 2C we show snapshots of conformations within each of the
bound state sub-basins, derived from the REMD simulation data at 300 K. The lowest
log(ùëëRMS ) form (which we term B‚Äô) very much matches the experimental structure, while

in the higher log(ùëëRMS ) form (B‚Äù) there are considerable conformational fluctuations that
seem mainly localized in the region termed receptor binding ridge [7, 11], despite the
disulfide bond that barely holds this region folded.
To characterize the residual disorder in the bound state we calculate the root mean
square fluctuations (ùëÖùëÄùëÜùêπ) for the RBD estimated from snapshots of both substates and
the unbound state (see Figure 2D). As anticipated, fluctuations are primarily localized in
the ridge region, both in the unbound and in the bound form of the protein, although in the
former they extend a bit longer to the receptor binding region. We see that upon binding,
fluctuations decrease considerably in the RBD but they remain larger than average in the
receptor binding ridge. Importantly, the ridge region could not be properly resolved in
recent cryo-EM structures of the spike protein [4]. Also, structural disorder is predicted
to appear around residue 150 of RBD from multiple servers [22]. Finally, the location of
the fluctuations of the coarse-grained simulations is consistent with atomistic MD [23],
giving further confidence to the outcome of our simulations.
In order to recover a dynamic picture of the binding process we have run tens of
molecular simulations starting from randomly oriented conformations in the unbound
state, resulting in a few binding events. This allows to understand the importance of the
properties of the underlying energy landscape in the binding process, in particular the
relevance of disorder in RBD, and propose a binding mechanism.
In Figure 3 we show the projection on relevant progress coordinates of the simulation
data for one of the binding events (two more are shown in the Supplementary Information
Fig. S3). Again, we monitor the log(ùëëRMS ) as a progress coordinate for binding, but now
considering either all contacts or different subsets of contacts separately. In particular, we
discern between contacts formed by the ridge residues and those in the remaining part
of the extensive RBM. In all the binding events we have observed binding occurs first via
the disordered region, which establishes the first few contacts, resulting in a decrease of
log(ùëëRMS ). Then, the remaining part of the RBD rests on the ACE2 binding site, until the
protein fully commits to the bound form. Representative snapshots help visualize how the
extended, disordered part of the protein more efficiently searches for its binding partner,
possibly due to a slightly increased capture radius (Figure 3). This is reminiscent of the
so-called ‚Äúfly-casting‚Äù mechanism that has been invoked to explain the kinetic advantage
of intrinsically disordered proteins for binding [24].

The disorder of the viral protein in the RBD:ACE2 complex formation may seem surprising. However, it is consistent with the lack of resolution in the receptor binding ridge
in the cryo-EM experiments [4]. More generally, structural disorder has recently been
highlighted as a prevalent feature in viral proteins [25], suggesting that small regions of
structural disorder may provide an evolutionary advantage to viruses.
Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first molecular description of the binding
process of the RBD to the ACE2 receptor which is an essential first step in the infection by
COVID-19. There are several potential limitations in our work due to the coarse-grained
nature of the model and the simplicity in the description of the interactions. First, the
simulation model does not consider explicitly long-range charged interactions, although
pairwise energy terms are residue-specific [18]. This prevents an adequate description of
electrostatic steering effects that may speed up the binding process [26]. Additionally, we
do not incorporate the glycosilation effects, although eperimental structures show that
glycosilated sites in ACE2 and RBD are far from the binding interface and hence likely to
be small.
We hope the insight from our coarse grained simulations will be helpful in future drug
discovery work either for antivirals that exploit the binding properties of RBD:ACE2 or
for vaccine development. One possibility would be to try to tune the disorder in the
RBD, distorting the balance between conformational entropy loss and enthalpic gain. For
example, by favouring a reductive environment for the virus that promotes reduction of
disulfides would increase the conformational disorder of the receptor binding ridge even
further. Alternatively, fragments of ACE2 involving the two main helices may be tested
as potential inhibitors of the virus.
