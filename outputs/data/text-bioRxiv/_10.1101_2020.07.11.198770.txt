Abstract
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2
into the host cell. Through a systematic analysis of publicly available mouse brain sc/snRNA-seq
data, we found that ACE2 is specifically expressed in small sub-populations of endothelial cells
and mural cells, namely pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Further, functional changes
in viral mRNA transcription and replication, and impaired blood-brain barrier regulation were
most prominently implicated in the aged, ACE2-expressing endothelial cells, when compared to
the young adult mouse brains. Concordant EC transcriptomic changes were further found in
normal aged human brains. Overall, this work reveals an outline of ACE2 distribution in the
mouse brain and identify putative brain host cells that may underlie the selective susceptibility of
the aging brain to viral infection.

Introduction
In addition to the well-known respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 patients suffer from a loss of
smell and taste, headache, impaired consciousness, and nerve pain [1], raising possibility of virus
infiltration in the nervous system, including brain. Despite cases emerging of COVID-19 patients
with neurologic manifestations, potential neurotropic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2mediated entry into the cells of the brain are largely unexplored.

Evidenced by transgenic mice models [2,3], the evolutionarily-related coronaviruses, such as
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can invade the brain by replicating and spreading through the nasal
cavity, and possibly olfactory bulbs located in close proximity to the frontal lobes of the brain [4].
Once inside the brain, viruses can harm the brain directly and indirectly by infecting the cells and
myelin sheaths, and by activating microglia, which may in turn consume healthy neurons to
induce neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [5].

Many of the observed neurological symptoms observed may in part be explained by a primary
vasculopathy and hypercoagulability [6], as endothelial dysfunction and the resulting clotting are
increasingly being observed in patients with severe COVID-19 infection [7-9]. Consistent with
these findings, the first pathologic evidence of direct viral infection of the EC and lymphocytic
endotheliitis has been found in multiple organs, including lung, heart, kidney and liver, in a
series of COVID-19 patients [10].

In contrast, recent clinical findings, including an MRI study [11] and immunohistochemistry and
RT-qPCR analyses [12,13], did not observe any signs of encephalitis from postmortem brain

examination of COVID-19 patients. Similarly, postmortem analysis of SARS-CoV-2-exposed
mice transgenically expressing ACE2 via mouse ACE2 promoter failed to detect the virus in the
brain [14]. In light of such controversy regarding neuropathological features, a more
comprehensive assessment on the distribution of ACE2 in a cell type-specific manner is required
to identify putative brain host cells.

Here, we analyzed publicly available and spatially rich brain RNA-seq datasets to assess ACE2
distribution in mouse brains at the single-cell and single-nuclei level. We found that ACE2 was
consistently expressed in small subpopulations of endothelial cells (ECs) and mural cells in all
the analyzed datasets, in which the impaired blood-brain barrier was further implicated in the
aged brains. These findings altogether may hold potential to initiate new avenues of research on
specific cells types (EC and vascular mural cells) that remain poorly understood particularly in
relation to the aging and viral infection in the brain.

Results
ACE2 is expressed in small sub-populations of ECs and mural cells in the adult mouse brain
A total of 11 adult mouse brains datasets deposited in the Single Cell Portal (SCP) were analyzed
in this study (Table 1; see Methods). Datasets lacking vascular cell types were excluded from the
data collection and subsequent analyses. The analyzed datasets were derived from diverse singlecell (scRNA-seq) and single-nuclei (snRNA-seq) sequencing technologies, including 10x
Genomics, SMART-seq, Drop-seq, and sNucDrop-seq. The number of cells included in the final
SCP-generated tSNE/UMAP plots also varied from 1,301 (lowest; T3) to 611,034 (largest; T11).

Despite the varying library preparation and sequencing technologies, which arguably recover
population heterogeneity to different extents, the analysis of the retrieved scRNA-seq datasets
(Fig. 1 A-E) consistently showed increased levels of ACE2 in a small subpopulation of vascular
cells, namely endothelial cells (EC), pericytes (PC), and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC),
across different brain regions, including auditory cortex (T1), anterior lateral motor cortex (T2),
primary visual cortex (T5), hypothalamus (T4), and whole brain (T6). Further, scRNA-seq

the elevated ACE2 expression in subsets of the three identified cell types, which consist of 32.8%
of the cell populations (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, ACE2 mRNAs were enriched in subpopulations of
ECs and mural cells of all analyzed snRNA-seq datasets (Fig. 2 A-E) derived from cortex (T7,
T9, T11), midbrain (T8), including substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), substantia nigra pars

Impaired blood-brain barrier is implicated in ECs of the aged brain
We next asked if these identified vascular cell sub-populations expressing ACE2 would be
affected by aging and whether they have unique transcriptional changes that are functionally
important. Of the 25 major cell types of different lineages (oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and
neuronal lineages, ependymal cells, vasculature cells, and immune cells), EC, PC, and VSMC
cell types contribute to a majority of ACE2-expressing cells in the whole mouse brain (T6) (Fig.
3 A-C). tSNE plots (Fig. 3 A-B) show projection of 37,069 single cells (16,028 young and
21,041 old) derived from the brains of 8 young (2-3 months) and 8 old (21-23 months) mice.

Importantly, we found that the EC was the most differentially expressed (DE) cell type in the
aged mouse brain, as compared to the young, in which a set of 68 DE genes (DEGs) was further
concordantly up- and down-regulated in the aged PCs (Fig. 3 D-E; see Methods). Given that PCs
are in direct contact with ECs, covering between 22% and 99% of the EC surface [15], such
shared transcriptomic changes highlight defective pericyte-endothelial interface as the most
notable

transcription/translation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulation and glucose/energy metabolism
were among the most prominently enriched functional pathways in the ECs of the aged mouse
brain (Fig. 3 F; see Methods). These findings altogether indicate that the pericyte-endothelial
interface may serve as a potential target and reservoir of virus in the brain, with increased
susceptibility to its infection in the aged brain with BBB defects.

Aged mouse brain EC transcriptomic signatures are enriched in aged human brains
To assess our findings in a human context, we next asked if the identified transcriptomic changes
in the aged EC gene signatures would further be conserved and detected in normal human aged
brains using bulk RNA-seq data derived from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project
database (Table 2) [16]. Expression levels (in TPM) of human orthologs of the aged EC DEGs
matched in the GTEx data were compared between the young (< 60) and old (≥ 60 yrs) human
samples (see Methods). Of all genes evaluated (n = 56,200), 8,215 (15%) showed the expression
level significantly different (t-test q-value ≤ 0.05; see Methods) while the expression levels of 37%
of EC DEGs were different in the old group from that of the young population, indicating
concordant EC transcriptomic changes in normal aged human brains (Fig. 4 A-B). This
conclusion was further supported by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results, displaying a
significant enrichment of the aged (n = 141) and young (n = 133) mouse EC DEGs in the old (n
= 814) and young (n = 621) human samples, respectively (Fig. 4 C). In conclusion, we have
identified specific EC signatures that are functionally important and related to the aging and viral
infection in the brain.

Discussion
While our study provides a foundation for a more refined level of analysis of EC and vascular
PC, a cell type that remains poorly understood despite its key roles in immune response and
microvascular stability [17], our analyses are limited only to the normal aging mouse and human
brains, lacking the context of COVID-19 neuropathology. A number of recent sc/snRNA-seq
studies identified ACE2 mRNA in the olfactory neuroepithelium [18,19], although there are no

sc/snRNA-seq data derived from postmortem brains of COVID-19 patients to date. The
distribution of ACE2 and other genes mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells of the brain
thus remains to be investigated across different regions and cell types.

Using scRNA-seq data derived from normal human brain tissues, Muus, C et al. [20] have
identified ACE2+TMPRSS2+ oligodendrocytes, while Chen et al. [21] have found subsets of
both neuronal (excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and non-neuronal cells (mainly astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes) expressing ACE2. These studies, however, have only used a limited number
of datasets, which may in part explain the inconsistent results of the identified cell types.

Despite the works that failed to identify direct signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brains of
COVID-19 patients [12,13], other lines of evidence support the neurotropism of the virus, as
evidenced by experimental platforms leveraging human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)derived dopaminergic neurons [22] and an organotypic brain model [23]. At this point, more data
and systematic molecular evidence will be needed to assess the neuroinvasive potential of
SARS-CoV-2 and its potential impact on neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.

Methods
Mouse brain sc/snRNA-seq data and analysis
Of all the independent studies retrieved with the term “ACE2” from the Single Cell Portal
(https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell), 11 sc/snRNA-seq datasets were derived from (1)
adult (young or old) mouse brains, and had (2) author-defined cell type annotations including
endothelial cells (EC, PC, or VSMC). A total of 801,658 cells were analyzed in this study, based

on the organ (i.e., brain) and species of origin (i.e., mouse), and diseased status (i.e., normal). 2D tSNE/UMAP plots (colored by cell type) and box plots for cell type-specific ACE2 expression
presented in this study were generated by the Single Cell Portal. t-SNE visualization (colored by
age) and 25 cell type-specific DE gene lists of the aging mouse brains (T1) were obtained from
the

advanced

interactive

data

viewer

(http://shiny.baderlab.org/AgingMouseBrain/AgingMouseBrain_SCV/). Genes with |logGER
(Gene Expression Ratio)|>0.1 and FDR<0.05 were defined as DEGs, and were analyzed for
functional pathway enrichment using GeneAnalyics (https://geneanalytics.genecards.org/).

Human brain bulk RNA-seq data and analysis
De-identified processed human brain bulk RNA-seq data and annotation files for sample
attributes and subject phenotypes were obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
portal (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets). Data from amygdala (n = 88), anterior
cingulate cortex (n = 107), caudate (basal ganglia) (n = 142), cerebellar hemisphere (n = 121),
cerebellum (n = 138), hippocampus (n = 123), frontal cortex (BA9) (n = 124), cortex (n = 137),
hypothalamus (n = 120), nucleus accumbens (basal ganglia) (n = 140), putamen (basal ganglia)
(n = 121), substantia nigra (n = 74) were analyzed in this study. A total of 1,435 samples were
divided into two age groups: young (< 60) and old (≥ 60 years old). Expression levels (in TPM)
were compared between the two age groups for all genes (n = 56,200) by t-test with multiple
testing correction. The performance of Bonferroni correction and False Discovery Rate (FDR)Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure was assessed using the RStudio (Version 1.2.5019) base
function p.adjust(). The R qvalue package [24] from Bioconductor was used to assess the
performance of q-value approach. The R biomaRt package [25] from Bioconductor was used to

Enrichment Analysis (GSEA v4.0.3; https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) [26] was used
to assess EC DEGs (EC up- and down-regulated genes) in GTEx human brain bulk RNA-seq
samples. Following parameters were set to run enrichment tests: (1) number of permutations =
1,000, (2) collapse/remap to gene symbols = no_collapse, and (3) permutation type = gene_set.
