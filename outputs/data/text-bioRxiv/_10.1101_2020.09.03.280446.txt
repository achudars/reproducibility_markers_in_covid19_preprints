ABSTRACT

36

A self-transcribing and replicating RNA (STARRTM) based vaccine (LUNAR®-COV19) has

37

been developed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vaccine encodes an alphavirus-based

38

replicon and the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike glycoprotein. Translation of the replicon

39

produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein

40

expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with

41

neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell mediated immunity

42

produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for

43

intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as

44

well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune

45

response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 µg and 10 µg doses

46

completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable

47

infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Our findings collectively suggest the

48

potential of Lunar-COV19 as a single dose vaccine.

INTRODUCTION

52

The pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has afflicted tens of millions of

53

people, of which hundreds of thousands have died from severe respiratory dysfunction and

54

other complications of this disease [1]. The etiological agent of COVID-19 is the severe acute

55

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may have first emerged from a

56

zoonotic source to then spread from person-to-person until global dissemination [1]. Current

57

control measures to curb the pandemic, such as national lockdowns, closure of work places

58

and schools and reduction of international travel are threatening to draw the world into a

59

global economic recession of unprecedented scale [2]. Vaccines that elicit durable protection

60

against SARS-CoV-2 infection are thus urgently needed [3]. Encouragingly, hundreds of

61

different vaccine development efforts are currently in progress, some of which have even

62

entered phase III clinical trials [4, 5].

63
64

Despite some candidates reaching late-stage clinical trials, there is some uncertainty that

65

production can be upscaled in a sufficiently accelerated timeline to manufacture the billions

66

of vaccine doses required to immunize the world’s population [6]. Furthermore, recent results

67

from early phase COVID-19 vaccine trials have suggested that more than one dose would be

68

needed to elicit reasonable levels of adaptive immune memory [7-9]. Durable protection with

69

a single dose has been achieved with some viral live-attenuated vaccines (LAV), such as the

70

yellow fever vaccine [10-12]. However, since the genetic determinants of the clinical fitness

71

of SARS-CoV-2 are not well defined, development of a LAV SARS-CoV-2 strain that is safe

72

for use in humans is challenging. An alternative approach would be to mimic the key

73

immunogenic properties of live viral vaccines, to develop an alternate vaccine platform that

74

could also be effective in preventing COVID-19 with a single dose. A single dose vaccine

75

would not only avoid logistics and compliance challenges associated with multi-dose

76

vaccines, but also allow vaccination of more individuals with each batch [6].

77
78

RNA vaccines offer a rapid approach to develop a COVID-19 vaccine [13]. RNA vaccines

79

are designed using the genetic sequence of the viral antigen and rapidly manufactured using

80

cell-free, rapidly scalable techniques [14]. The RNA is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle

81

(LNP), which generates robust immune responses without the need for adjuvants [15, 16].

82

There are two main categories of RNA vaccines; 1) the conventional messenger RNA

83

(conventional mRNA) vaccine, where the immunogen of interest is directly translated from

84

the input vaccine transcript, and 2) the newer self-replicating RNA (replicon) vaccines [14].

85

Replicon vaccines encode replication machinery, usually alphavirus-based replication

86

complex, that amplify sub-genomic RNA carrying the antigen of interest, resulting in the

87

amplification of transcripts bearing the antigen by several orders of magnitude over the initial

88

dose [17]. Prolonged antigen expression by such a construct could not only produce the

89

obvious dose sparing effects [17] but potentially also elicit innate and adaptive immune

90

responses similar to those associated with live vaccines. Herein, we show a head-to-head

91

comparison between a self-replicating RNA vaccine using Arcturus’ proprietary Self-

92

Transcribing and Replicating RNA (STARRTM technology and a conventional mRNA

93

vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that the STARR vaccine, LUNAR-COV19 offers

94

superior vaccine-induced immune responses to conventional mRNA.

96

RESULTS

97
98

Comparison of design and expression of STARR and conventional mRNA platforms

99

Both LUNAR-COV19 and conventional mRNA vaccine constructs were designed to encode

100

the full-length, unmodified, pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 S protein (1273 aa), with LUNAR-

101

COV19 additionally encoding the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replicase

102

genes required for self-amplification (Figure 1A). We first defined the characteristics of

103

these different constructs, which were both formulated with the same LUNAR LNP lipid

104

formulation. Despite differences in RNA lengths for LUNAR-COV19 and conventional

105

mRNA , the LNP diameter, polydispersity index and RNA trapping efficiency were similar

106

(Figure 1B). In vitro expression of the LUNAR-COV19 and conventional mRNA vaccine

107

were confirmed in cell lysate 24 hours post-transfection through positive western blot

108

detection of the S protein (Figure 1C). It was also observed that both vaccines expressed a

109

mixture of full-length S protein and cleaved S protein, i.e. into S1 and S2 transmembrane and

110

cytoplasmic membrane domains (Figure 1C). We then compared in vivo protein expression

111

of the two RNA platforms in BALB/c mice, by using STARR and conventional mRNA

112

constructs that expressed a luciferase reporter (Figure 1D). As expected, animals injected

113

with the conventional mRNA vaccine construct showed high in vivo luciferase expression at

114

day 1 although the expression levels declined significantly three days post injection. In

115

contrast, the luciferase expression in STARR injected mice showed increased signal of

116

protein production compared to conventional mRNA at all time points after Day 1 up to Day

117

7 post-inoculation (the last time point measured) and at doses ≥2.0 µg, protein expression

118

appeared to be still rising at day 7 (Figure 1D). These data showed that dose-for-dose, the

119

STARR luciferase construct yielded higher and more prolonged duration of luciferase

120

expression compared to mice injected with the conventional mRNA luciferase construct.

121
122

Immune gene expression following LUNAR-COV19 and conventional mRNA vaccination

123

C57BL/6J mice were vaccinated with LUNAR-COV19 or conventional mRNA vaccines at

124

0.2 µg, 2 µg and 10 µg doses or PBS control. No significant mean loss in animal weight

125

occurred over the first 4 days, except for those that received 10 µg of LUNAR-COV19

126

(Figure 2A). However, apart from weight loss, there were few other clinical signs as

127

indicated by the minimal differences in clinical scores. Both weight and clinical scores

128

improved uneventfully after day 3 post vaccination.

129
130

The innate immune response, particularly the type-I interferon (IFN) response has previously

131

been shown to be associated with vaccine immunogenicity following yellow fever

132

vaccination [11, 12, 18]. Furthermore, we have also found that reactive oxygen species-

133

driven pro-inflammatory responses underpinned systemic adverse events in yellow fever

134

vaccination [19, 20]. Therefore, we measured the expression of innate immune and pro-

135

inflammatory genes in whole blood of C57BL/6 mice inoculated with either PBS,

136

conventional mRNA vaccine or LUNAR-COV19. Genes in the type-I IFN pathway were the

137

most highly expressed in animals inoculated with LUNAR-COV19 compared to either

138

conventional mRNA vaccine or PBS (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1). By contrast,

139

genes associated with pro-inflammatory responses were mostly reduced in abundance

140

following LUNAR-COV19 vaccination compared with either conventional mRNA vaccine or

141

PBS (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 1).

142
143

Since adaptive immune responses develop in germinal centers in the draining lymph nodes,

144

we dissected the draining lymph nodes at day 7 post-inoculation (study schematic in Figure

145

2A). The inguinal lymph nodes of mice inoculated with LUNAR-COV19 showed a dose-

146

dependent increase in weight, unlike those from mice inoculated with either conventional

147

mRNA vaccine or PBS; the mean weight of lymph nodes from mice given 10 µg of LUNAR-

148

COV19 was significantly higher than those given the equivalent conventional mRNA vaccine

149

(Figure 2C). Principal component analysis (PCA) of immune gene expression showed

150

clustering of responses to each of the 3 doses of LUNAR-COV19 away from the PBS control

151

(depicted as red and orange spheres in Figure 2D-F), indicating clear differences in immune

152

gene expression between LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated and placebo groups. These trends were

153

also dissimilar to those from mice given conventional mRNA vaccine where at all tested

154

doses, the PCA displayed substantial overlap with PBS control (shown as blue and orange

155

spheres in Figure 2D-F).

156
157

We next assessed the differentially expressed genes in the lymph nodes of mice given

158

LUNAR-COV19 compared to those inoculated with mRNA vaccine. Volcano plot analysis

159

identified significant upregulation of several innate, B and T cells genes in LUNAR-COV19

160

immunized animals (Figure 2G-I). Some of the most highly differentially expressed genes

161

included, GZMB (required for target cell killing by cytotoxic immune cells) [21], S100A8

162

and S100A9 (factors that regulate immune responses via TLR4) [22], TNFRSF17 (also

163

known as BCMA and regulates humoral immunity) [23], CXCR3 (chemokine receptor

164

involved in T cell trafficking and function) [24] and AICDA (mediates antibody class

165

switching and somatic hypermutation in B cells) [25]. These findings collectively indicate

166

that the adaptive immune responses in the draining lymph nodes of mice inoculated with

167

LUNAR-COV19 may differ to those given the non-replicating mRNA vaccine.

168
169

LUNAR-COV19 induced robust T cell responses

170

We next investigated the cellular immune response following vaccination of C57BL/6 mice

171

(n=5 per group) with LUNAR-COV19 or conventional mRNA. At day 7 post-vaccination,

172

spleens were harvested and assessed for CD8 and CD4 T cells by flow-cytometry. The CD8+

173

T cell CD44+CD62L- effector/memory subset was significantly expanded in LUNAR-

174

COV19 vaccinated mice compared to those given either PBS or conventional mRNA vaccine

175

(Figure 3A-B). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of CD4+ T

176

effector cells in these animals (Figure 3C). IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells (with 2 µg and 10 µg doses)

177

and IFNγ+ CD4+ T cells (in 0.2 µg and 10 µg) were proportionately higher, as found using

178

intracellular staining (ICS) with flow cytometry, in LUNAR-COV19 as compared to

179

conventional mRNA vaccinated animals (Figure 3D-F).

180
181

SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular responses were assessed in vaccinated animals by ELISPOT.

182

A set of 15-mer peptides covering the full length SARS-CoV-2 S protein were divided into 4

183

pools and tested for IFNγ+ responses in splenocytes of vaccinated and non-vaccinated

184

animals. SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular responses (displayed as IFNγ+ SFU/106 cells) were

185

detected by ELISPOT in both LUNAR-COV19 and conventional mRNA vaccine immunized

186

animals compared to PBS control (Figure 3G-I). These responses were substantially higher

187

across all doses in LUNAR-COV19 compared to conventional mRNA vaccinated groups

188

(Figure 3G-I). Even the highest tested dose (10 µg) of conventional mRNA vaccine

189

produced IFNγ+ ELISPOT responses that were appreciably lower than those by the lowest

190

dose (0.2 µg) of LUNAR-COV19.

191
192

LUNAR-COV19 induced superior humoral immune responses

193

SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses following vaccination with a single injection were

194

characterized in two different mouse models, BALB/c and C57BL/6. Female mice (n=5 per

195

group) were vaccinated at day 0 and bled every 10 days, up to day 60 for BALB/c and day 30

196

for C57BL/6 (Figure 4A). SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgM responses were tested at 1:2000

197

serum dilution using an in-house Luminex immuno-assay. All tested doses of the

198

conventional mRNA vaccine and LUNAR-COV19 produced detectable S-specific IgM

199

responses in both mouse models (Figure 4B-C). When comparing LUNAR-COV19 to

200

conventional mRNA vaccinated BALB/c mice, no difference in IgM responses was observed;

201

IgM levels in C57BL/6 mice were higher in LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated C57BL/6 mice at

202

day 10 post vaccination. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgG (at 1:2000 serum dilution)

203

levels were universally higher from day 20 onwards in animals inoculated with LUNAR-

204

COV19 compared to conventional mRNA vaccine (Figure 4D-E). Perhaps even more

205

remarkably, in BALB/c vaccinated with LUNAR-COV19, the IgG levels continued to

206

increase until day 50 post-vaccination; C57BL/6 mice were only monitored until day 30 post-

207

vaccination. This trend contrasted sharply with mice that received the conventional mRNA

208

vaccine where in BALB/c mice antibody levels plateaued after day 10 post-vaccination;

209

although increasing S-specific IgG levels were observed in conventional mRNA-vaccinated

210

C57BL/6 mice these were universally lower than those that received LUNAR-COV19.

211
212

In depth characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG response in vaccinated animals

213

was conducted at day 30 post-immunization to assess which regions of S protein are targeted.

214

IgG endpoint titers were estimated to full ectodomain S protein, S1, S2 and receptor binding

215

domain (RBD) regions. As expected for both vaccine candidates the majority of SARS-CoV-

216

2 specific IgG recognized S1, which contains the RBC, although high IgG endpoint titers

7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.03.280446; this version posted September 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this

217

were also detected to S2 protein (Figure 4F-G). However, LUNAR-COV19 elicited IgG

218

endpoint titers were universally and significantly higher compared to those produced by

219

conventional mRNA vaccination (Figure 4F-G). Notably, IgG that bind the RBD of S

220

protein, which is an immunodominant site of neutralizing antibodies [26, 27], were also

221

higher in LUNAR-COV19 compared to conventional mRNA vaccinated animals. It is also

222

noteworthy that at lower doses, conventional mRNA vaccine but not LUNAR-COV19

223

struggled to elicit high SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG titers in the more Th1 dominant C57BL/6

224

mouse strain (Figure 4G). Taken collectively, a single dose of LUNAR-COV19 induced

225

significant differences in immune gene expression and superior cellular immune responses in

226

draining lymph nodes compared to the conventional mRNA vaccine and consequently greater

227

and more prolonged humoral immune responses.

228
229

We assessed both the binding strength (avidity) and the neutralizing ability of the antibody

230

response elicited by these vaccine constructs. Serum IgG avidity was measured at day 30

231

post-vaccination using a modified Luminex immuno-assay with 8M urea washes. LUNAR-

232

COV19 elicited higher avidity S protein-specific IgG in both mouse models at all tested

233

doses (Figure 4H). These differences were observed, with the exception of 0.2 µg in

234

BALB/c, across all doses (Figure 4H), indicating that LUNAR-COV19 elicited better quality

235

antibodies, suggesting superior affinity maturation with the LUNAR-COV19 vaccine.

236
237

Neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 by serum from vaccinated animals was assessed using

238

the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). At day 30 LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated

239

BALB/c mice showed a clear dose-dependent elevation in PRNT50 titers; 4 out of 5 (80%) of

240

mice in the 10 µg LUNAR-COV19 group showed PRNT50 titers greater than 320, which was

241

the upper limit of our dilution (Figure 4I). Similar dose-dependent trends in PRNT50 titers

242

were also found in C57BL/6 mice although in these animals, the PRNT50 titers of several

243

animals exceeded 320 even with the lowest 0.2 µg dose vaccination (Figure 4I). In sharp

244

contrast, PRNT50 titers in animals inoculated with the conventional mRNA vaccine construct

245

were, except for one C57BL/6J mouse that received 10 µg dose, all <20 (Figure 4I).

246

Unexpectedly but encouragingly, PRNT50 and PRNT70 titers of LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated

247

BALB/c mice continued to rise between day 30 and day 60 after a single vaccination (Figure

248

4J-K) and at both time points for doses ≥2.0 µg. These titers were comparable to PRNT70

249

titers for sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients (Figure 4K).

250
251

We also found that the S protein IgG titers positively correlated with PRNT50 titers with

252

LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated mice in both mouse models (Figure 4L). Similar positive

253

correlations were also observed with IgG against S1 and RBD (Supplementary Figure 1).

254

By contrast, we found no correlation between IgG and PRNT50 titers in conventional mRNA

255

vaccinated mice (Figure 4L). Taken collectively, our antibody response analyses suggest that

256

the higher PRNT50 titers following vaccination with LUNAR-COV19 are not only strongly

257

associated with the amount of IgG produced but are also a factor of the superior quality of the

258

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies produced following vaccination with LUNAR-COV19.

259
260

LUNAR-COV19 vaccination showed a Th1 dominant response

261

A safety concern for a coronavirus vaccine is the risk of vaccine-associated immune

262

enhancement of respiratory disease (VAERD) [28]. Indeed, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

263

vaccine development have highlighted the importance of Th1 skewed responses in mitigating

264

the risk of vaccine-induced immune enhancement [29, 30]. Therefore, we investigated the

265

Th1/ Th2 balance elicited by vaccination with both conventional mRNA and LUNAR-

266

COV19. The IgG subclass fate of plasma cells are highly influenced by T helper (Th) cells

267

[31]. At day 30 post-vaccination, both conventional mRNA and LUNAR-COV19, induced

268

comparable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgG1, a Th2-associated IgG subclass in

269

mice, except for the 0.2 µg dose in C56BL/6J mice (Figure 5A-B). In contrast, the Th1-

270

associated IgG subclasses - IgG2a in BALB/c and IgG2c in C56BL/6J - were significantly

271

greater in LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated animals. The ratios of S protein-specific IgG2a/IgG1

272

(Balb/c) and IgG2c/IgG1 (C57BL/6) were greater than 1 in LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated

273

animals (Figure 5A-B). Except for the 0.2 µg dose, these ratios were all significantly greater

274

with LUNAR-COV19 compared to the conventional mRNA vaccinated animals.

275
276

Additionally, we used ICS to investigate the production of IFNγ (Th1 cytokine) and IL4 (Th2

277

cytokine) by CD4+ T cells in spleens at day 7 post vaccination C56BL/6J mice. As was

278

described above, compared to conventional mRNA vaccination, IFNγ levels were

279

significantly greater in LUNAR-COV19 vaccinated animals (Figure 3F). IL4 expression in

280

CD4 T cells were slightly higher with conventional mRNA as compared to LUNAR-COV19

281

at 0.2 and 2.0 µg doses (Figure 5C). In comparing the IFNγ and IL4 levels in individual

282

mice, we found that the ratios of IFNγ/IL4 in CD4+ T cells for both LUNAR-COV19 and

9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.03.280446; this version posted September 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this

283

conventional mRNA vaccinated mice were universally above 1 (Figure 5D). The ratio of

284

IFNγ/IL4 in CD4+ T cells in mice given the 0.2 and 2.0 µg doses were significantly greater

285

with LUNAR-COV19 than conventional mRNA vaccination (Figure 5F). However, the

286

elevated ratios at these doses were due to a decrease in IL4 expression at levels below

287

background (i.e. PBS control mice), rather than reduced IFNγ and hence Th1 activity. Taken

288

collectively, our data show that LUNAR-COV19 produced a Th1 biased adaptive immune

289

response.

290
291

Single dose of LUNAR-COV19 protects from a lethal infection of SARS-CoV-2

292

Finally, we tested the efficacy of LUNAR-COV19 in protecting against infection and

293

mortality in a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge model. Transgenic hACE2 mice immunized

294

with either PBS, or 2 µg or 10 µg of LUNAR-COV19 vaccine were intranasally challenged

295

with live SARS-CoV-2 virus (5x104TCID50) at day 30 post-vaccination. This was the same

296

isolate as that used for our PRNT assays. Mice were then divided into two groups: one group

297

was tracked for weight, clinical scores and survival; a second group of mice were euthanized

298

at 5 days post injection (dpi) and viral loads assessed in the respiratory tract (trachea to lung)

299

and brain (Figure 6A). Measurement of PRNT70 titers confirmed the generation of

300

neutralizing antibodies in LUNAR-COV19-vaccinated hACE2 mice (Figure 6B).

301

Irrespective of tested dosages, mice that received the LUNAR-COV19 vaccine showed

302

unchanged weight and no clinical sign, while the PBS mice showed significant drop in

303

weight and increased clinical scores upon challenge with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (Figure

304

6C-D). LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 µg and 10 µg doses fully protected hACE2

305

mice from an otherwise 100% mortality at day 7 post-challenge (Figure 6E). Assessment of

306

tissue viral load at day 5 post-challenge found minimal to no SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 6F)

307

in contrast to unvaccinated animal controls. Although viral RNA was detectable at very low

308

levels in some animals, this was not associated with any presence of infectious viral particles,

309

so most like represents viral RNA fragments rather than intact viral RNA genomes. No

310

detectable infectious virus was found in either the respiratory tracts or brains of LUNAR-

311

COV19 vaccinated animals (Figure 6G). By contrast, unvaccinated animals showed 4 and 8

312

logs of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract and brain, respectively (Figure 6G).

313

Collectively, these data show that a single dose of LUNAR-COV19 vaccine induced robust

314

humoral and cellular immune responses that led to complete protection of hACE2 mice from

315

a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

DISCUSSION

318

The pandemic of COVID-19 has necessitated rapid development of vaccines. Encouragingly,

319

several COVID-19 vaccine candidates are now in clinical trials and more are entering first-in-

320

human trials. However, the majority of vaccine candidates being developed require two or

321

more doses for sufficient adaptive immune responses. Requirement for a second shot could

322

complicate compliance rate in mass vaccination campaigns and results in fewer subjects

323

vaccinated per batch, thereby reducing the efficiency of vaccination. Hence, a single dose

324

vaccine that generates robust and sustained cellular and humoral immunity, without elevating

325

the risk of vaccine-mediated immune enhancement, remains an unmet need.

326
327

Amongst the licensed vaccines for other diseases, live attenuated vaccines can offer the most

328

durable protection against viral diseases. Live vaccines infect and replicate at sites of

329

inoculation and some even in draining lymph nodes. Replication enables endogenous and

330

sustained expression of viral antigens that enable antigen presentation to stimulate cytotoxic

331

CD8+ T cells. Expressed antigens taken up by antigen presenting cells also trigger CD4+ T

332

cell help that drives affinity maturation in B cells. Studies on the live attenuated yellow fever

333

vaccine, have shown that a longer period of stimulation of the adaptive immune response

334

results in superior adaptive immune responses [32]. Although work to determine which of

335

these correlates of live vaccines are mechanistic determinants of adaptive immunity is still

336

ongoing, the ability of self-replicating RNA vaccines to simulate the sustained antigen

337

presentation characteristics of live vaccination could offer durable immunity against COVID-

338

19.

339
340

Numerous studies have shown RNA vaccines to be immunogenic. In this study, we

341

conducted a side-by-side comparison of the immunogenicity elicited by two SARS-CoV-2

342

RNA vaccine candidates, a conventional mRNA construct and the STARR construct,

343

LUNAR-COV19. We found that, compared to conventional mRNA, LUNAR-COV19

344

produced higher and longer protein expression in vivo, upregulated the gene expression of

345

several innate, B and T cell response genes in the blood and draining lymph nodes. These

346

properties were associated with significantly greater neutralizing antibody and SARS-CoV-2

347

specific IgG responses, CD8+ T cell responses, IFNγ+ ELISPOT responses, and Th1 skewed

348

responses (which have been shown to associate with protection from VAERD) than

11

349

conventional mRNA. Interestingly, despite the highest tested dose of conventional mRNA

350

eliciting comparable S protein-specific antibodies as the lowest tested dose of LUNAR-

351

COV19, the conventional mRNA-elicited IgG did not show such robust avidity or

352

neutralization activity as those from LUNAR-COV19 vaccination. These data suggest a

353

qualitatively better humoral immune response with superior affinity maturation of B-cells

354

with the LUNAR-COV19 vaccine. Our findings thus highlight the immunological advantages

355

of self-replicating RNA over conventional mRNA platforms.

356
357

The superior quality of immune responses elicited by LUNAR-COV19 over the conventional

358

mRNA vaccine construct could be attributable to multiple factors. Higher and longer

359

expression of immunogens produce better immunity [32], likely through better engagement

360

of T follicular helper cells and thereby leading to more diverse antibody targets and more

361

robust neutralizing antibody responses [33, 34]. Replication of LUNAR-COV19 results in the

362

formation of a negative-strand template for production of more positive-strand mRNA and

363

sub-genomic mRNA expressing the S transgene. Interaction between the negative- and

364

positive-strands forms a double stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediate, which would interact

365

with TLR3 and RIG-I-like receptors to stimulate type 1 interferon responses [35-37], which

366

we and others have previously shown to correlate with superior adaptive immune responses

367

[11, 12, 18]. Production of IFNγ can also stimulate development of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells

368

[36]. Importantly, the S protein does contain human CD8+ T cell epitopes. As suggested by

369

recent findings on T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections [38-40],

370

the development of T cell memory could be important for long-term immunity.

371
372

It is unclear whether the VEEV nsP1-4 forming the replication complex contains any

373

immunogenic properties although mutations in the nsP proteins have been shown to affect the

374

induction of type I IFN [41]. Although unexplored in our current study, VEEV replicons have

375

also been shown to adjuvant immune responses at mucosal sites [42], further justifying the

376

use of STARR platform to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

377
378

In conclusion, STARR vaccine platform as exemplified by LUNAR-COV19, offers an

379

approach to simulate key immunogenic properties of live virus vaccination and offers the

380

potential for an effective single-shot vaccination against COVID-19.

382

METHODS (Supplement 1)

383

Vaccine plasmid constructs and design

384

A human codon-optimized spike (S) glycoprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank

385

accession: YP_009724390) was cloned into plasmids pARM2922 and pARM2379 for

386

generation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike expressing STARR and conventional mRNA, respectively.

387

The STARR plasmid also encoded for the Venezuela equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) non-

388

structural proteins nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsp4, which together form the replicase complex that

389

bind to the sub-genomic promoter placed right before the S protein sequence. The cloned

390

portions of all plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were

391

linearized immediately after the poly(A) stretch and used as a template for in vitro

392

transcription reaction with T7 RNA polymerase. For LUNAR-CoV19 vaccine, the reaction

393

for RNA was performed as previously described [43] with proprietary modifications to allow

394

highly efficient co-transcriptional incorporation of a proprietary Cap1 analogue and to

395

achieve high quality RNA molecule of over 11,000-nt long the STARR mRNA. RNA was

396

then purified through silica column (Macherey Nagel) and quantified by UV absorbance. For

397

the conventional mRNA vaccine, the RNA was synthesized similarly but with 100%

398

substitution of UTP with N1-methyl-pseudoUTP. For both LUNAR-CoV19 and

399

conventional mRNA vaccines, the RNA quality and integrity were verified by 0.8-1.2% non-

400

denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis as well as Fragment Analyzer (Advanced

401

Analytical). The purified RNAs were stored in RNase-free water at -80 °C until further use.

402
403

Vaccine lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)

404

LUNAR® nanoparticles encapsulating STARR™ were prepared by mixing an ethanolic

405

solution of lipids with an aqueous solution of STARR™ RNA. Lipid excipients (Arcturus

406

Therapeutics proprietary ionizable lipid, DSPC, Cholesterol and PEG2000-DMG) are

407

dissolved in ethanol at mole ratio of 50:10: 38.5:1.5 or 50:13:35.5:1.5. An aqueous solution

408

of the vaccine RNA is prepared in citrate buffer pH 4.0. The lipid mixture is then combined

409

with the vaccine RNA solution at a flow rate ratio of 1:3 (V/V) via a proprietary mixing

410

module. Nanoparticles thus formed are stabilized by dilution with phosphate buffer followed

411

by HEPES buffer, pH 8.0. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UF/DF) of the nanoparticle

412

formulation is then performed by tangential flow filtration (TFF) using modified PES hollow-

413

fiber membranes (100 kDa MWCO) and HEPES pH 8.0 buffer. Post UF/DF, the formulation

414

is filtered through a 0.2 µm PES filter. An in-process RNA concentration analysis is then

415

performed. Concentration of the formulation is adjusted to the final target RNA concentration

416

followed by filtration through a 0.2 µm PES sterilizing-grade filter. Post sterile filtration,

417

bulk formulation is aseptically filled into glass vials, stoppered, capped, and frozen at -70 ±

418

10°C. Analytical characterization included measurement of particle size and polydispersity

419

using dynamic light scattering (ZEN3600, Malvern Instruments), pH, Osmolality, RNA

420

content and encapsulation efficiency by a fluorometric assay using Ribogreen RNA reagent,

421

RNA purity by capillary electrophoresis using fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical),

422

lipid content using HPLC,.

423

In vitro transfection and immunoblot detection of spike protein

424

Hep3b cells (seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 7 X 105 cells/well, a day before) were

425

transfected with purified IVTs (2.5 μg conventional mRNA and 2.5 μg STARR ) by

426

Lipofectamine MessengerMax transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to

427

the manufacturer’s instruction. The cells were harvested the next day with a hypotonic buffer

428

(10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) )

429

followed by sonication. Samples were deglycosylated followed by treatment with PNGase F

430

(New England Biolabs) according to the manufacture’s instruction.

431

The protein lysate (10 μg) was resolved on a 7.5% NuPAGE Tris-Acetate gel (Thermo Fisher

432

Scientific), and the spike protein expression was analyzed by LI-COR Quantitative Western

433

Blot system using a rabbit antibody detecting S1 (40150-T62-COV2, Sino Biologic) and a

434

mouse antibody for S2 region (GTX632604, GeneTex) along with appropriate secondary

435

antibodies (goat anti-rabbit 800 and goat anti-mouse 680).

436

Animal studies

437

BALB/c studies

438

All BALB/c mouse studies were approved by the Explora Biolabs IACUC and performed

439

under the Animal Care and Use Protocol number EB-17-004-003. A head-to-head

440

comparison of the protein expression of the conventional mRNA and STARR vaccine

441

platforms was conducted using conventional mRNA and STARR constructs expressing a

442

luciferase reporter gene. BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory) were intramuscularly (IM) in

443

the rectus femoris with conventional mRNA or STARR at doses of 0.2, 2 and 10 µg (n=3

444

mice/group). Expression of the conventional mRNA and STARR constructs were measured

445

at days 1, 3 and 7 post-inoculation through luciferase expression by imaging the mice for

446

bioluminescence.

447
448

Humoral responses to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike vaccine candidates were tested in Female

449

BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratory) aged 8-10 weeks by IM immunization of the rectus

450

femoris with either conventional mRNA or LUNAR-COV19 at doses 0.2 µg, 2 µg, or 10 µg

451

(n=5 mice/group). Mice were bled at baseline and at 10, 19, 30, 40, 50- and 60-days post-

452

vaccination to assess SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immune responses.

453
454

C57BL/6

455

All C57BL/6 mouse studies were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the

456

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Singapore Health Services, Singapore (ref

457

no.: 2020/SHS/1554). C57BL/6 mice purchased from inVivos were housed in a BSL-2

458

animal facility at Duke-NUS Medical School. Groups of 6-8 weeks old wild-type C57BL/6

459

female mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with either conventional mRNA or LUNAR-

460

COV19 at doses 0.2 µg, 2 µg, or 10 µg. For transcriptomic and T cell studies, submandibular

461

bleeds were performed for whole blood at 24 hrs post-vaccination. Day 7 post-immunization,

462

mice were sacrificed at and inguinal lymph nodes and spleen harvested for investigation of

463

immune gene expression and T cell responses, respectively. Splenocyte suspensions for

464

measuring T cell responses were obtained by crushing spleen through a 70µm cell strainer

465

(Corning). Red blood cells were removed by lysis using BD PharmLyse reagent. For

466

antibody studies, another set of vaccinated 6-8 weeks old mice were bled at baseline and at

467

10, 20, and 30 days post-vaccination.

468
469

SARS-CoV-2 challenge experiments were conducted with female B6;SJL-Tg(K18-

470

hACE2)2Prlmn/J mice purchased from Jackson laboratory. Groups of 6-8 weeks old wild-

471

type C57BL/6 female mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with 100 µl LUNAR-COV19 at

472

doses of 2 µg, or 10 µg. Submandibular bleeds were performed for serum isolation to

473

determine antibody titers via PRNT 28 days post vaccination. Animal were infected with

474

5x104 TCID50 in 50µl via the intranasal route. Daily weight measurements and clinical

475

scores were obtained. Mice were sacrificed when exhibiting greater than 20% weight loss or

476

clinical score of 10. To assess organ viral loads, mice were sacrificed 5 days post infection

477

and harvested organs were frozen at -80oC. Whole lungs and brains were homogenized with

478

MP lysing matrix A and F according to manufacturer’s instructions in 1ml PBS. Homogenate

479

was used to assess both plaque titers and RNA extraction using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). No

480

blinding was done for animal studies.

481
482

Gene expression of immune and inflammatory genes

483

Whole blood collected 1-day post-vaccination was lysed using BD PharmLyse reagent and

484

RNA extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy kit. Mouse lymph nodes collected from 7 days post

485

vaccination were homogenized and RNA extracted using trizol LS. RNA (50 ng) from whole

486

blood cells and lymph nodes were hybridized to the NanoString nCounter mouse

487

inflammation and immunology v2 panels (Nanostring Technologies), respectively. As

488

previously described [20, 44], RNA was hybridized with reconstituted CodeSet and

489

ProbeSet. Reactions were incubated for 24 hours at 65oC and ramped down to down to 4oC.

490

Hybridized samples were then immobilized onto a nCounter cartridge and imaged on a

491

nCounter SPRINT (NanoString Technologies). Data was analyzed using the nSolver

492

Analysis software (Nanostring Technologies) and Partek Genomics Suite. For normalization,

493

samples were excluded when percentage field of vision registration is <75, binding density

494

outside the range 0.1–1.8, positive control R2 value is <0.95 and 0.5 fM positive control is ≤2

495

s.d. above the mean of the negative controls. Background subtraction was performed by

496

subtracting estimated background from the geometric means of the raw counts of negative

497

control probes. Probe counts less than the background was floored to a value of 1. The

498

geometric mean of positive controls was used to compute positive control normalization

499

parameters. Samples with normalization factors outside 0.3–3.0 were excluded. The

500

geometric mean of housekeeping genes was used to compute the reference normalization

501

factor. Samples with reference factors outside the 0.10–10.0 range were also excluded.

502

Hierarchical clustering was performed with Partek Genomics Suite v6 on gene sets zScore

503

values by Euclidean dissimilarity and average linkage.

504
505

To identify DEGs between groups, Partek Genomics Suite Analysis v7 software was used to

506

analyse variance (ANOVA) with a cut off-of P < 0.05. Log2 Fold Changes generated were

507

used for volcano plots constructed using Prism v8.1.0 software. DEGs were identified by a

508

fold change cut-off of 2. Unsupervised principle component analysis was performed to

509

visualize variability between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals with Partek genomics

510

suite analysis v7 software. PCA ellipsoids were drawn with a maximum density and 3

511

subdivisions.

513

Flow cytometry

514

Surface staining was performed on freshly-isolated splenocytes using the following panel of

515

antibodies and reagents: B220 (RA3-6B2), CD3 (17A2), CD4 (RM4-5), CD8α (53-6.7),

516

CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL-14) and DAPI. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed by

517

stimulating freshly-isolated splenocytes with 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin in the

518

presence of GolgiPlug (BD) for 6 h. After stimulation, surface staining of CD3, CD4 and

519

CD8a was performed followed by intracellular staining of IFN-γ (XMG1.2) and IL-4

520

(11B11). Data acquisition was performed on a BD LSRFortessa and analyzed using FlowJo.

521
522

ELISPOT

523

ELISPOT was performed using mouse IFN-γ ELISpotBASIC kit (Mabtech). A similar protocol

524

has been used for human SARS-CoV-2 samples [40]. In brief, 4 x 105 freshly-isolated

525

splenocytes were plated into PVDF-coated 96 well plates containing IFN-γ capture antibody

526

(AN18). Cells were stimulated with a 15-mer peptide library covering part of the S protein.

527

143 total peptides were divided into four pools and used at a final concentration of 1 µg/ml

528

per peptide. Negative control wells contained no peptide. Following overnight stimulation,

529

plates were washed and sequentially incubated with biotinylated IFN-γ detection antibody

530

(R4-6A2), streptavidin-ALP and finally BCIP/NBT. Plates were imaged using ImmunoSpot

531

analyzer and quantified using ImmunoSpot software.

532
533

Luminex Immuno-assay

534

Longitudinal assessment of binding antibody

535

Longitudinal IgM and IgG responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 were measured using an in-

536

house Luminex Immuno-assay. Similar Luminex Immuno-assays have been previously

537

described for antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 antigens [45, 46]. Briefly, Magpix

538

Luminex beads were covalently conjugated to insect-derived HIS-tagged SARS-CoV-2

539

whole Spike protein (SinoBiologicals) using the ABC coupling kit (Thermo) as per

540

manufacturer’s instructions. Beads were then blocked with 1%BSA, followed by incubation

541

with serum (diluted at 1:2000 in block) for 1 hr at 37C. Beads are then washed and SARS-

542

CoV-2 Spike-specific mouse antibodies were detected using the relevant biotinylated

543

secondary antibody (i.e. anti-mouse IgM-biotin and anti-mouse IgG-biotin (Southern

544

Biotech) for IgM and IgG assessment, respectively) with streptavidin-PE (Southern Biotech).

545

Antibody binding to Spike were then measured on a Magpix instrument as median

546

fluorescence intensity (MFI). Spike antigen quantity on beads were also probed with anti-

547

6xHIS-PE antibodies and all MFI values were then corrected to Spike antigen quantity to

548

account for experiment to experiment variation.

549
550

IgG and IgG subclass endpoint titers

551

IgG endpoint titers to mammalian-derived SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Spike domain 1 (S1), spike

552

domain 2 (S2) and receptor binding domain (RBD) at day 30 sera post-immunization were

553

measured using Luminex ImmunoAssay. Assay was conducted as described above, with the

554

modification of serially diluting serum 10-fold from 200 to 2x108. Similarly, IgG subclass

555

endpoint titers (i.e. IgG1 and IgG2a in BALB/c and IgG1 and IgG2c in C57BL/6) were

556

measured against mammalian-derived SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein using serially diluted

557

mouse sera (5-fold from 200 to 3.1x106) and secondary antibodies anti-IgG1-biotin, anti-

558

IgG2a-biotin or anti-IgG2b-biotin (Southern Biotech). Four parameter logistic (4PL) curves

559

were fitted to the measured MFI data from serially diluted sera, and three times the

560

background (i.e. 3x MFI with no serum) was used as a threshold cutoff to estimate endpoint

561

titers.

562
563

IgG Avidity

564

Avidity index of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at day 30 sera post-immunization was

565

estimated using the Luminex ImmunoAssay. Assay was conducted as described above with

566

the minor modification of following bead incubation with serum (diluted at 1:2000) with

567

either a 10 min PBS or 8M urea wash. Avidity Index was estimated by subtracting

568

background MFI from all sample values, and then dividing MFI with 8M Urea wash by MFI

569

with PBS wash.

570
571

Neutralization assay

572

Virus Neutralization titer assay (VNT)

573

Neutralization sero-conversion was assessed at day 10 and 20 post-immunization in BALB/c

574

using a virus neutralization assay as previously described [47]. Briefly, sera were diluted to

575

1:20 in culture media, mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a Singaporean clinical isolate of live SARS-

576

CoV-2 virus, isolate BetaCoV/Singapore/2/2020 (GISAID accession code EPI_ISL_406973)

577

and incubated for 1 hr at 37C. Virus-antibody immune-complexes were then added to Vero-

578

E6 cells (ATCC) in 96-well plates, and incubated at 37C. Five days later, plates were

579

assessed under a microscope for cytopathic effect (CPE) of the cells.

Plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT)

582

Neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 was measured by PRNT at day 30 post-vaccination in

583

both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Similar protocols have been published previously for

584

SARS-CoV-2 [48]. Briefly, mouse sera were serially diluted from 1:20 to 1:320 in culture

585

media and incubated with the Singapore isolate of SARS-CoV-2 virus for 1 hr at 37C. Virus-

586

antibody mixtures were then added to Vero-E6 cells in 24-well plates, incubated for 1-2 hrs,

587

then overlayed with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and incubated at 37C under 5% CO2. At

588

5 days, cells are washed, stained with crystal violet and plaques counted. The serum dilution

589

leading to neutralization of 50% of virus, i.e. PRNT50, was estimated.

Figure 1. Design and Expression of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine with conventional mRNA
and self-transcribing and replicating RNA (STARR®) platforms. A) Schematic diagram
of the SARS-CoV-2 self-replicating STARR RNA (LUNAR®-COV19) and conventional
mRNA vaccine constructs. The STARR construct encodes for the four non-structural
proteins, ns1-ns4, from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and the unmodified
full-length pre-fusion spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA construct also codes for
the same SARS-CoV-2 full length spike S protein. B) Physical characteristics and RNA
trapping efficiency of the LNP encapsulating conventional mRNA and LUNAR-COV19
vaccines. C) Western blot detection of SARS-CoV-2 S protein following transfection of
HEK293 cells with LUNAR-COV19 and conventional mRNA. D) In vivo comparison of
protein expression following IM administration of LNP containing luciferase-expressing
STARR RNA or conventional mRNA. Balb/c mice (n=3/group) were injected IM with 0.2
µg, 2.0 µg and 10.0 µg of STARR RNA or conventional mRNA formulated with the same
lipid nanoparticle. Luciferase expression was measured by in vivo bioluminescence on days
1, 3 and 7 post-IM administration. S domain 1 = S1, S domain 2 = S2, transmembrane
domain = TM, cytoplasmic domain = CP; aka = also known as.
