Abstract

25

Coronavirus pandemics have become a huge threat to the public health worldwide in the

26

recent decades. Typically, SARS-CoV caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS-

27

CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic recently. Both viruses have been reported to

28

originate from bats. Thus, direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to

29

humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key

30

factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies

31

transmission. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS-

32

CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the

33

viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-

34

utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS-

35

CoV-2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS-CoV, indicating a narrower host range of

36

SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, pangolin CoV, another SARS-related coronavirus highly

37

homologous to SARS-CoV-2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile

38

with SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. To clarify the mechanism underlying the

39

receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found

40

5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N-terminal

41

20th and 42nd amino acids that may determine the different receptor utilization of SARS-

42

CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV. Our studies promote the understanding of

43

receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses, potentially contributing to the virus

44

tracing, intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic

45

coronaviruses.

Introduction

51

Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive sense RNA viruses. In the recent

52

two decades, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have caused to at least three major

53

pandemics and pose a huge threat to the public health worldwide (1). Until now, seven

54

different HCoVs have been identified and all of them belong to the family

55

Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. Especially, the species Severe acute respiratory

56

syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) of the genus Betacoronavirus contains the

57

most pathogenic HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

58

(SARS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2).

59

SARS-CoV caused the SARS pandemic in years of 2002 – 2003, resulting in more than

60

8,000 clinical cases with a mortality of 10% (3, 4). After the SARS pandemic, plenty of

61

research and measurements have been done to prevent the emergence and re-emergence

62

of coronavirus epidemics, including transmission tracing, pathogenesis studies and

63

therapy development (5). Nevertheless, 17 years later, a novel human coronavirus,

64

SARS-CoV-2, brought a much more severe and widespread pandemic of Coronavirus

65

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to the world and this pandemic is lasting until now (6, 7). Up

66

to May 25, 2025, about 5 month after the first reported case of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-

67

2 has caused 5,432,302 confirmed infections and 342,318 deaths worldwide, far

68

surpassing the SARS pandemic. So far, most countries around the world are suffering

69

from the public health crisis, medical system overload and economic loss due to the

70

pandemic. Among common pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 emerges a high

71

transmissibility whose R0 value is currently estimated as 2.3 but could be as high as 5.7

72

when more infection cases are identified (8). The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2

73

is probably a major reason for the rapid development of COVID-19 epidemic. In order

74

to relieve the current pandemic and prevent HCoV epidemics in the future, more studies

75

on the transmission of pathogenic HCoV is urgently required.

76

Interspecies transmission from wide animals to humans is a major cause leading to

77

the epidemics of highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

78

2. Previous virus tracing studies have shown that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural

79

reservoirs of SARS-CoV (9, 10), and a recent phylogenetic analysis has revealed that

80

SARS-CoV-2 might also be originated from bat-SARSr-CoV (11). Some small

81

mammals, such as civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes

82

procyonoides), can serve as the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and might be he direct

83

sources of the SARS epidemic in early 2003 due to the successful isolation of SARS-

84

CoV from these animals (12). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2-like CoVs were detected in

85

Malayan pangolins, indicating pangolins might serve as an intermediate host for SARS-

86

CoV-2 (13, 14). The intermediate host animals usually play critical roles in the

87

interspecies transmission from natural virus reservoirs to humans and community

88

transmission of viruses. The host range of a virus is an essential factor determining its

89

intermediate hosts. Thus, research on the host range of viruses is of great importance for

90

virus tracing and epidemic control.

91

A main factor determining the host range of viruses is the recognition and

92

binding between viral particles and their receptors on the host cells. Angiotensin

93

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is utilized by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as their

94

cellular receptor (1, 15). Discovered in the year of 2000, ACE2 was initially identified

95

as an exopeptidase expressed in vascular endothelial cells in the heart and the kidney

96

that catalyses the conversion of angiotensins (16, 17). ACE2 is highly conserved and

97

ubiquitously expressed in most vertebrates, but not all ACE2s can serve as the receptor

98

for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which is a key determinant of the host range of these

99

two viruses. For instance, SARS-CoV can use mouse ACE2 as its receptor but SARS-

100

CoV-2 cannot, indicating that mouse is a potential host for SARS-CoV but not for

101

SARS-CoV-2 (1). Our previous study predicted the ACE2 utilization of SARS-CoV-2

102

and showed that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially utilize most mammalian ACE2s except

103

murine ACE2s and even some avian ACE2s. Meanwhile, we also predicted 9 amino

104

acid (aa) residues in ACE2 critical for SARS-CoV-2 utilization (18). However, this

105

study was mainly based on the aa analysis and lacked experimental evidence, which

106

could be hardly referred to clarify the host range of SARS-CoV-2.

107

In this study, we ectopically expressed ACE2 of 20 different animals in HeLa cells, a

108

cell line lacking of ACE2 expression naturally, and then infected the cells with HIV-

109

based pseudoviral particles carrying coronavirus spike proteins to test their utilization of

110

these ACE2s. The result showed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could use

111

most mammalian ACE2s as their receptors but not fish or reptilian ACE2s. Interestingly,

112

similar to mouse ACE2, SARS-CoV but not SARS-CoV-2 was capable of using

113

chicken ACE2, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2, especially in murine

114

and birds. We also tested pangolin CoV pseudovirus with spike highly similar to SARS-

115

CoV-2. To our surprise, pangolin CoV showed an ACE2 utilization profile similar to

116

SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. By alignment of the aa sequence of the 20 ACE2

117

orthologs, we further confirmed several aa residues (among the 9 residues predicted

118

previously) critical for SARS-CoV-2 utilization, including T20, K31, Q42 and Y83, and

119

excluded some critical aa residues, such as Y41 and K68. Especially, T20 of ACE2

120

probably played critical roles in spike-ACE2 binding by interacting with S477 and T478

121

within the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but it was not

122

necessary for the binding of ACE2s with SARS-CoV and pangolin CoV spikes. These

123

aa residues might partially determine the unique receptor utilization and host range of

124

SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study provides a more clear view of ACE2 utilization

125

by SARS-CoV-2, which may contribute to a better understanding about the virus-

126

receptor interaction and the host range of SARS-CoV-2.

Results

129

Validation of pseudovirus preparation and ACE2 expression

130

In this study, we investigated the ACE2 utilization of three SARSr-CoVs, including

131

SARS-CoV-BJ01, SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin CoV. Pangolin CoV was tested since

132

pangolins were suspected to be a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 (14).

133

Notably, the RBM of Pangolin CoV spike is almost identical with SARS-CoV-2 spike

134

except for the 498th aa residue, but they are different from SARS-CoV spike on multiple

135

aa sites (Figure 1A).

136

In order to validate the successful preparation of the three pseudovirus, the HEK293T

137

cells for virus package were lysed after virus harvest the cells were lysed and subjected

138

to Western blot detection of HA-tagged spike proteins. As shown in Figure 1B, samples

139

from all three package cells showed typical bands (about 180 kDa) of SARSr-CoV

140

spike proteins, indicating the success of pseudovirus preparation.

141

Then, we continued to validate the ectopic expression of 20 ACE2s from different

142

animals in HeLa cells, an ACE2-negative human cell line. We transfected the HeLa

143

cells with plasmids harboring the coding gene of ACE2s from different animals. At 48 h

144

post transfection, he cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot detection of 6*His-

145

tagged ACE2 protein. As shown in Figure 1C, bands of all ACE2s (about 150 kDa)

146

could be observed, indicating the successful expression of all ACE2s in HeLa cells.

Difference in the ACE2 utilization by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

149

We transfected the HeLa cells with the 20 plasmids expressing different ACE2s

150

individually or empty vector as a control. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were

151

infected with SARS-CoV-BJ01, SARS-CoV-2 or Pangolin CoV pseudovirus. After 48 h

152

of infection, the cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assay to evaluate the cell-

153

entry efficiency of the pseudoviruses mediated by different ACE2s. As shown in Figure

154

2, little luminescence signals could be observed in samples from HeLa cells transfected

155

with empty vector and infected by any of the three pseudoviruses, indicating that native

156

HeLa without ACE2 could not mediate the pseudovirus entry. Luminescence signals

157

from cells expressing crucian, crocodile or viper snake ACE2 were also low, indicating

158

that fish and reptilia ACE2s could barely mediate the pseudovirus entry. Cells

159

expressing chicken or mouse ACE2 showed a strong luminescence signal when infected

160

by the SARS-CoV-BJ01 pseudovirus but not by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus,

161

indicating that SARS-CoV-BJ01 could use chicken or mouse ACE2 for cell entry but

162

SARS-CoV-2 could not. Pangolin CoV was capable of utilizing both chicken and

163

mouse ACE2s, but its utilizing efficiency of chicken ACE2 was much lower than

164

SARS-CoV-BJ01. On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ignited a stronger

165

luminescence than SARS-CoV-BJ01 or Pangolin CoV pseudovirus in cells expressing

166

bat ACE2, indicating the highest utilizing capability of bat ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2. For

167

the other ACE2s, infection of all the three pseudoviruses led to strong luminescence

168

signals, implying that all the three SARSr-CoV were capable of utilizing a broad range

169

of ACE2s.

Phylogenetic analysis of ACE2s and key amino acids for SARS-CoV-2 utilization

172

To evaluate the phylogenetic relationship of the 20 ACE2s assessed above, we built a

173

phylogenetic tree based on the aa sequences of all the ACE2s (Figure 3A). In the tree,

174

we observed the obvious branches of mammalian, bird, reptilia and fish ACE2s.

175

However, with the mammalian ACE2s, there were no significant branches

176

corresponding to the ACE2 utilization by SARS-CoV-BJ01 or SARS-CoV-2

177

pseudoviruses, indicating that the whole sequence analysis could hardly reveal the key

178

factors underlying the receptor utilization by the viruses.

179

In our previous study, we predicted 9 key aa sites on human ACE2 potentially

180

critical for the receptor utilization, including T20, K31, Y41, K68, Y83, K353, D355,

181

R357 and M383, based on the SARS-CoV-2 utilization of human, bat, civet, swine and

182

mouse ACE2s (18). Here we tested 15 more species, and then we checked the 9 sites of

183

the 20 ACE2 orthologs to validate the role of the nine sites in SARS-CoV-2 utilization.

184

As shown in Figure 3A, Y/H41, D355, R357 and R383 were conserved in all ACE2s,

185

indicating that these sites were not determining the receptor utilization by SARS-CoV-2.

186

Similarly, K68 was conserved in both mouse and chicken ACE2s that could not be used

187

by SARS-CoV-2 and was probably not important for SARS-CoV-2 utilization either.

188

Q42 was conserved in mouse ACE2 but was substituted by E42 in chicken ACE2

189

whose role in SARS-CoV-2 might be complicated. On the contrary, T20, K31 and Y83

190

in usable ACE2s were distinct from the corresponding aa in unusable ACE2s, indicating

191

their cirtical role in determining SARS-CoV-2 utilization.

192
193

Discussion

194

In history, most pandemic viruses originated from wild reservoir animals and

195

transmitted directly or indirectly to humans, such as Ebola virus from bats (19) and

196

human immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzees (20). The reason for this

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.13.149930; this version posted June 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

197

phenomena is probably that native human viruses have undergone long-term

198

coevolution with humans and are unlikely to cause severe diseases to their hosts after

199

multiple natural selections. Therefore, interspecies transmission is usually a prerequisite

200

for a virus to cause a pandemic. A broad host range is supposed to lead to effective

201

interspecies transmission of virus and such virus is more likely to cause a pandemic.

202

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is the most severe worldwide

203

pandemic in the recent years surpassing the SARS pandemic in 2003, so it is likely to

204

speculate that SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host range. Surprisingly, our cell-entry result

205

showed that SARS-CoV-2 had a smaller range of ACE2 utilization than SARS-CoV.

206

SARS-CoV-2 could not utilize mouse or chicken ACE2 which could be used by SARS-

207

CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2, especially in murine and birds.

208

The reason is probably that the host range of SARS-CoV-2 is broad enough to support

209

its transmission from bats to humans, and lack of infection to some kinds of animals

210

does not affect such transmission due to redundant routes. Thus, it is not suggested to

211

over-interpret the determination of the host range on the possibility of a virus to cause

212

pandemics, especially for the viruses with broad host ranges.

213

Notably, SARS-CoV-2 has a better utilization of bat ACE2 than SARS-CoV. Though

214

SARS-CoV originate from bat-SARSr-CoV, the utilization of bat ACE2 by SARS-CoV

215

is quite limited which is supported by the previous reports (10, 21). According our

216

current results, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes Chinese horseshoe bat ACE2 much better than

217

SARS-CoV, indicating a higher homology between SARS-CoV-2 and its ancestor. This

218

speculation is supported by the phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes in the previous

219

study (1).

220

Our cell-entry result showed that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could use a wide

221

variety of mammalian ACE2s, which is further supported by the reports about the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.13.149930; this version posted June 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

10
222

susceptibility of various mammals to SARS-CoV-2 infection (22). However, the

223

utilization of fish and reptilian ACE2s was quite poor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-

224

CoV-2. This can be explained by the remote phylogenetic relationship between

225

fish/reptilian ACE2s and mammalian ACE2s. By comparison, bird ACE2s have closer

226

phylogenetic relationship with mammalian ACE2s, and thus, bird ACE2s could be used

227

by some but not all SARSr-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV. This indicates that SARSr-CoVs

228

are more likely to be transmitted by mammals and birds but not fish and reptiles, and

229

more attention should be paid to domestic mammals and birds to prevent CoV pandemic.

230

Our previous study predicted 9 critical aa residues on ACE2 orthologs based on the

231

aa sequence comparison of Chinese horseshoe bat, civet, swine and mouse ACE2s,

232

since these were the only ACE2s tested by SARS-CoV-2 utilization at that time (18). In

233

this study, we have tested 16 more ACE2s which could help to confirm or exclude

234

critical aa residues found previously. K31 and Y83 in human ACE2 were confirmed by

235

this study as critical aa residues for SARS-CoV-2 utilization. Substitutions of K31D and

236

Y83F were reported to abolish or strongly inhibit SARS-CoV binding (23, 24). Here we

237

have found more K31 substitutions abolishing SARS-CoV-2 utilization that chicken

238

ACE2 with K31E, crocodile and viper snake ACE2s with K31Q and mouse ACE2 with

239

K31N could not be utilized by SARS-CoV-2, matching our previous prediction.

240

Considering both chicken and mouse ACE2s could be utilized by SARS-CoV, K31 may

241

be a key aa residue leading to the different receptor utilization of SARS-CoV and

242

SARS-CoV-2. Also, chicken, mouse and viper snake ACE2s with Y83F could not be

243

utilized by SARS-CoV-2, consistent with our previous prediction and other former

244

reports. On the contrary, though Y41A was reported to abolish SARS-CoV binding (23),

245

horse ACE2 with Y41H could be used by SARS-CoV-2 well, indicating that Y41H

246

barely affect SARS-CoV-2 utilization. However, Chinese horseshoe bat ACE2 with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.13.149930; this version posted June 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

11
247

Y41H showed a relatively lower utilization by SARS-CoV-2 and even lower utilization

248

by SARS-CoV, indicating Y41H might decrease receptor utilization synergistically with

249

only with other unknown substitutions, especially for SARS-CoV. Substitution of K68

250

was reported to slightly inhibit SARS-CoV binding (23). Nevertheless, horse ACE2

251

with K68R could be used by SARS-CoV-2 well, indicating that K68R might not affect

252

SARS-CoV-2 utilization either. Crucian and viper snake ACE2 with K68I could not be

253

used by SARS-CoV-2, but these ACE2s contains so many other substitutions that we

254

may not attribute the abolishment of SARS-CoV-2 utilization to K68I.

255

Remarkably, our study revealed T20 of ACE2 as a potential key aa residue for

256

SARS-CoV-2 utilization. T20 has not been reported to affect SARS-CoV utilization but

257

mouse ACE2 with T20L and chicken ACE2 with T20V could not be used by SARS-

258

CoV-2. T20 is located at the N terminus of most mature mammalian ACE2s (excluding

259

the signal peptide). According to the structure of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain

260

complexed with human ACE2, the N-terminal T20 of ACE2 is close to S477 and T478

261

of SARS-CoV-2 RBM (Figure 3B) (25). Both threonine and serine contain hydroxyl

262

radicals that allow them to form hydrogen bonds with each other. Thus, T20 of human

263

ACE2 is likely to bridge with S477 and T478 of SARS-CoV-2 spike via hydrogen

264

bonds, which stabilizes the ACE2-spike binding. However, L20 on mouse ACE2 and

265

V20 on chicken ACE2 are both aliphatic aa that cannot form hydrogen bonds to support

266

the ACE2-spike binding, which may impair the utilization of these two ACE2s by

267

SARS-CoV-2. In SARS-CoV spike, the two aa residues are substituted by G463 and

268

K464. K464 can form hydrogen bonds with threonine and G463 is a non-polar aa that

269

can interact with valine or leucine via hydrophobic bond together with the adjacent

270

A461. Therefore, SARS-CoV spike can interact with various N-terminal aa of ACE2s,

271

and this may be the reason why SARS-CoV can utilize mouse and chicken ACE2s

12
272

while SARS-CoV-2 cannot. Pangolin CoV spike shares high similarity with SARS-

273

CoV-2 which keeps S477 and T478. However, Pangolin CoV spike harbors alkaline

274

H498 that can interact with acidic Q42 and E42 of mouse and chicken ACE2,

275

respectively, via ionic affinity, which may complementally support the ACE2-spike

276

binding and allow the utilization of mouse and chicken ACE2 by Pangolin CoV. On the

277

contrary, SARS-CoV-2 spike substitutes H498 with acidic Q498, leading to ionic

278

repulsion with Q42 and E42, blocking its binding with mouse and chicken ACE2s.

279

These proposed interactions provide a possible explanation for the different utilization

280

of ACE2s by SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV. Nevertheless, all the speculation about

281

the aa residues on ACE2 key for spike-ACE2 binding is based on the sequence analysis,

282

and mutation validation is necessary to further verify the roles of those sites.

283

In summary, our current study has validated the ACE2 utilization by SARS-CoV-2

284

predicted in our previous analysis by pseudovirus cell-entry assay. The results showed

285

less ACE2 utilization by SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and pangolin CoV,

286

especially for murine and bird ACE2s, indicating narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2.

287

Meanwhile, with these data, we screend 5 key aa residues of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2

288

utilization. Especially, the N-terminal T20 and Q42 might be critical in determining the

289

difference of ACE2 utilization by the three SARSr-CoV. Our findings deepen the

290

understanding about the receptor utilization and the host range of SARS-CoV-2,

291

providing useful information for tracing virus transmission routes and preventing

292

pandemics caused by CoVs in the future.

HEK293T and HeLa cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection

297

and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA)

298

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at

299

37°C.

300

Full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (GenBank accession number MN908947.3),

301

SARS-CoV BJ01 spike (GenBank accession number AY278488.2) and Pangolin CoV

302

GD1 spike (GISAID accession number: EPI_ISL_410721) were all synthesized by

303

Sangon and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vectors with a C-terminal HA tag. The

304

cDNAs encoding different ACE2 proteins (Table S1) were synthesized by Sangon and

305

subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vectors with a C-terminal His tag. All the plasmids were

306

verified by Sanger sequencing.

307
308

Western blot analysis

309

Lysates of cells or filtered supernatants containing pseudoviruses were separated by

310

SDS–PAGE, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore，USA). For

311

detection of S protein, the membrane was incubated with anti-HA tag mouse

312

monoclonal antibody (bimake, USA, 1:2000), and the bound antibodies were detected

313

by Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Abbkine, China,

314

1:5,000). For detection of HIV-1 p24 in supernatants, monoclonal antibody against HIV

315

p24 (p24 MAb) was used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:8,000, followed by

316

incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at the same dilution. To detect

317

the expression of 20 ACE2s in HeLa cells, Mouse anti-His tag monoclonal antibody

318

(Bioworld, USA, 1:5000) was used as the first antibody, followed by incubation with

319

HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at the same dilution.

Pseudovirus preparation and cell-entry assay

322

The pseudovirus cell-entry assay was performed as described previously (26). In brief,

323

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a luciferase-expressing HIV-1 plasmid (pNL4-

324

3.Luc.R-E-) and a plasmid encoding HA-tagged SARS-CoV-BJ01 spike, SARS-CoV-2

325

spike or Pangolin CoV spike. The supernatant containing pseudoviruses was collected

326

48 h after transfection and the remaining cell pellet was lysed for Western blot detection

327

of HA-tagged spike proteins. In cell-entry assay, pseudoviruses were incubated with

328

recipient cells at 37 °C for 6 h, the medium was changed and cells were incubated for an

329

additional 42 h. Cells were then washed with PBS buffer and lysed. Lysates were tested

330

for luciferase activity (Promega, USA). Each infection experiment was carried out on

331

for three times.

332
333

Phylogenetic analysis

334

Multiple sequence alignment was performed for the whole aa sequences of ACEs using

335

MAFFT with a local alignment strategy FFT-NS-2. The phylogenetic tree was

336

constructed by MEGA7 using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with 1,000 bootstrap

337

replicates and visualized using FigTree.
