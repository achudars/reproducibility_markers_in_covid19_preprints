One Sentence Summary
COVID-19-associated ARDS is biologically distinct from other causes of ARDS.

Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main complication of COVID-19, requiring
admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Despite recent immune profiling of COVID-19 patients,
to what extent COVID-19-associated ARDS specifically differs from other causes of ARDS
remains unknown, To address this question, we built 3 cohorts of patients categorized in COVID19negARDSpos, COVID-19posARDSpos, and COVID-19posARDSneg, and compared their immune
landscape analyzed by high-dimensional mass cytometry on peripheral blood followed by artificial
intelligence analysis. A cell signature associating S100A9/calprotectin-producing CD169pos
monocytes, plasmablasts, and Th1 cells was specifically found in COVID-19posARDSpos, unlike
COVID-19negARDSpos patients. Moreover, this signature was shared by COVID-19posARDSneg
patients, suggesting severe COVID-19 patients, whatever they experienced or not ARDS, displayed
similar immune dysfunctions. We also showed an increase in CD14posHLA-DRlow and
CD14lowCD16pos monocytes correlated to the occurrence of adverse events during ICU stay. Our
study demonstrates that COVID-19-associated ARDS display a specific immune profile, and might
benefit from personalized therapy in addition to standard ARDS management.

Introduction:
The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has currently affected more than 30 million people
worldwide, requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for more than 2 million patients (1).
Whereas most patients exhibit mild-to-moderate symptoms, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) is the major complication of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2, 3), leading to
prolonged ICU stays, and high frequency of secondary complications, notably cardiovascular
events, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke (1, 4). The immune system plays a dual role
in COVID-19, contributing to both virus elimination and ARDS development. Excessive
inflammatory response has been proposed as the leading cause of COVID-19-related clinical
complications, thus supporting intensive efforts to better understand the specificities and
mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced immune dysfunction (5, 6). Moreover, even if antiviral
strategies, such as those provided by remdesivir or convalescent plasma, can lower the viral burden,
no antiviral treatment has yet been able to prevent the evolution of some patients towards
deregulated inflammation and critical respiratory complications. Recent data however suggest a
benefit of corticosteroids in lowering overall mortality in COVID-19 patients with moderate
disease, severe disease, and ARDS (7). However, steroid therapy could be harmful in some specific
ARDS etiologies, such as in influenza-associated ARDS (8). A better understanding of the
etiology-specific immune dysfunctions underlying ARDS development and severity is thus a major
unmet need to design specific therapeutic strategy.
A number of high-resolution studies have recently concentrated on the determination of circulating
markers that can distinguish severe from mild forms of COVID-19, providing a tremendous amount
of data describing phenotypic and functional alterations in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subsets
(9-20). In particular, CD14posHLA-DRlow, CD14posCD16pos, CD14lowCD16pos, and immature
monocytes were demonstrated as increased among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

from critically ill COVID-19 patients (11, 16, 18, 21-23). Various alterations of lymphoid cells
have also been described, including a T-cell lymphopenia, predictive of patient outcome, a broad
T-cell activation including Th1, Th2, and Th17, an alteration of B-cell and T-cell repertoires, and
a strong increase of plasmablasts, most prominent in ARDS COVID-19 patients (12, 20, 24-26).
Importantly, whereas non-COVID-19 ARDS is associated with a large panel of immune alterations,
COVID-19 ARDS immune profiling was performed using healthy donors as a control, thus
precluding any conclusions on whether reported immune alterations could be related to COVID19 and/or ARDS status. Answering this question has potential to decipher whether ARDS induced
by SARS-CoV-2 is mechanistically different from other ARDS etiologies.
To fill this gap, we performed a high-throughput mass cytometry approach on PBMCs obtained
from 3 complementary cohorts of 12 COVID-19negARDSpos, 13 COVID-19posARDSpos, and 17
COVID-19posARDSneg patients. We report common myeloid cell alterations in all COVID-19
patients, which are absent from non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. This includes in particular a strong
increase of an unusual population of activated monocytes showing upregulated expression of
CD169, associated with major COVID-19-specific alterations of T and B-cell compartments.

Results
Study population
Analyses were performed on a cohort of 63 cryopreserved PBMC samples isolated from 42 patients
included in ICU (n = 36) or infectious standard ward (n = 6). The demographic characteristics of
patients included are provided in Table 1. All patients but one were classified as severe at
admission, requiring oxygen at a flow rate higher than 2 liters/min. ARDS was defined in
accordance with international guidelines (27). Patients were classified in 3 groups: COVID19negARDSpos (n = 12, ARDS stages: 1 mild, 4 moderate, 7 severe), COVID-19posARDSpos (n = 13,

ARDS stages: 8 moderate, 5 severe), and COVID-19posARDSneg (n = 17, including 11 from ICU
and 6 from infectious standard ward). In the COVID-19posARDSneg, no statistical differences were
noticed for immune cell abundance or phenotype between ICU and standard ward patients. Within
the COVID-19negARDSpos group, ARDS etiologies were bacterial pneumonia (n = 9), antisynthetase syndrome (n = 1), and unknown (n = 2). No corticoid therapy was started at the time of
sampling. For 21 patients, a second blood sample obtained on day 7 after enrollment was studied
(n = 7 for COVID-19negARDSpos, n = 8 for COVID-19posARDSpos, and n = 6 for COVID19posARDSneg).

SARS-CoV2 induces phenotypic changes in circulating immune cells
To decipher the impact of SARS-CoV2 on circulating immune cells, we characterized PBMCs
from COVID-19pos versus COVID-19neg patients at admission (D0) using two separate mass
cytometry panels exploring myeloid and lymphoid subsets, respectively (Table S1). The full
pipeline of analysis is depicted in fig. S1. First, we performed an unbiased discovery approach with
CellCnn, a neural network-based artificial intelligence algorithm allowing analysis of single-cell
data and detection of cells associated with clinical status (28-30). During training, CellCnn learns
combinations of weights for each marker in a given panel that best discriminate between groups of
patients. These weight combinations, called filters, can be used to highlight the specific profiles of
cells associated with patient status. We identified the best-performing CellCnn filters for both the
myeloid and the lymphoid panels highlighting a population of cells significantly enriched in
COVID-19pos patients as compared to COVID-19neg patients (P < 0.0001 for both panels) (Fig. 1A).
Projecting these cells on tSNE maps generated with either the myeloid or the lymphoid panels
revealed that they fell into several distinct areas (Fig. 1B). The cells selected by the CellCnn filter
on the myeloid panel showed high expression for CD169, CD64, S100A9, CD11b, CD33, CD14,

and CD36 compared to background, while the cells selected by the CellCnn filter on the lymphoid
panel showed high expression for CD38 and CXCR3 (Fig.1B and Fig. S2). This broad and unbiased
approach showed that immune markers, in particular related to monocytes, segregated COVID19neg and COVID-19pos patients.

SARS-CoV2 induces CD169-expressing monocyte subsets
To investigate circulating monocyte heterogeneity and define consistent phenotypes, we used the
FlowSOM algorithm. This approach led to the identification of 15 monocyte metaclusters from the
myeloid panel (Fig. 2A). In particular, Mo30, Mo11, and Mo28 metaclusters were defined by
higher expression of CD16 and lower expression of CD14, CD36, and CD64, corresponding to a
non-classical monocyte phenotype. Mo21 and Mo22 were defined by the high expression of
S100A9 and the low expression of CD36. Finally, Mo243 and Mo180 strongly expressed S100A9,
CD169, and CD36. To assess the phenotypic changes in monocytes during SARS-CoV2 infection,
we determined the frequencies of these metaclusters in each patient at admission and performed
hierarchical clustering on these values (Fig. 2B). The upper branch of the hierarchical clustering
included 20 COVIDpos (10 ARDSneg and 10 ARDSpos) and 1 COVIDnegARDSpos patient whereas
the lower branch included 10 COVIDpos (7 ARDSneg and 3 ARDSpos) and 11 COVIDnegARDSpos
(chi-square = 0.001) (Fig. 2B). We then analyzed the abundance of individual metaclusters and
identified only 4 metaclusters out of 15 as differentially represented between the 3 groups of
patients (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3). In particular, within ARDSpos patients, Mo11 and M181 were less
abundant in COVID-19pos patients (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), while Mo243 and Mo180
were more abundant (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). No differences were detected within
COVID-19pos groups (ARDSpos versus ARDSneg) (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, Mo243 and Mo180 were
both enriched in cells highly expressing CD169, CD64, CD36, and CD14 (Fig. 2A and 2D).

Additionally, Mo22 was present only in some COVIDpos patients and also expressed CD169 (Fig.
2B). Taken as a whole, Mo243, Mo180, and Mo22 clusters were highly enriched in COVID-19pos
patients when compared to COVID-19neg patients (P < 0.0001), with no difference regarding the
ARDS status (Fig. 2E). Accordingly, CD169 was differentially expressed in COVID-19pos versus
COVID-19neg patients (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2E). As a whole, our study including COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 critically ill patients suggest a specificity of CD169 expression in COVID-19 patients,
and greatly extend previous scRNAseq data showing an expansion of CD169-expressing
monocytes in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors (Fig. 2F) (20).

Monocyte metacluster enrichment in COVID-19 is correlated with a specific increase of
effector memory T cells and plasma cells
To define a more global immune pattern and the relationship between immune cells in the context
of the SARS-CoV2 infection, we sought for correlation between frequencies of clusters of T, NK,
B, and plasma cells (n = 136 clusters from the lymphoid panel, fig. S4) and the 4 monocyte
metaclusters (Mo11, Mo181, Mo243, and Mo180) previously described. This analysis identified
70 clusters with significantly correlated variations (P < 0.05) (Fig. S5). To strengthen the relevance
of these correlations, we restrained further analysis to the 29 strongest relationships (R > 0.5 or < 0.5 and P < 0.01) between Mo180 or Mo243 (the two metaclusters enriched in COVID-19 patients)
and other immune cell subsets (Fig. 3A and Table S2). As expected, Mo180 and Mo243 clusters
were correlated (R = 0.93). Moreover, they were positively correlated with 18 clusters of T (n = 6),
NK (n = 10), and plasma cells (n = 2), and inversely correlated with 11 clusters of T (n = 9), and
NK cells (n = 2) (Fig. 3A). Among positively correlated clusters, plasmo_183 and plasmo_198
similarly expressed CD38, CD44, and CD27, whereas plasmo_183 was high for Ki-67 and HLADR, corresponding to an early plasma cell phenotype (Fig. 3B). NK cells were all marked by CD7

Mo_243, in particular clusters T4_6, T4_20, and T4_34, all three corresponding to naïve cells
(CD45RAhighCD45ROlowCCR7high), and T4_59 expressing a Th2 phenotype (CCR4high). We then
compared the abundance of these 29 lymphoid clusters correlated with Mo180 and Mo243 and
highlighted the 22 differentially represented lymphoid clusters between the three groups of patients
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6). Only 7 clusters of CD4 T cells, and 2 clusters of CD8 T cells were
at lower abundance in COVID-19posARDSpos patients compared to COVID-19negARDSpos patients.
As previously discussed, T4_6, T4_20, and T4_34 corresponded to naïve cells, whereas within the
effector memory cells, T4_7 and T4_45 were CD127low, T4_24, T8_99, and T8_113 were
CD127high, and T4_59 was CCR4high. Conversely, 13 clusters were enriched in COVID19posARDSpos compared to COVID-19negARDSpos including: i) CTLA4highPD1high effector memory

COVID-19posARDSneg groups (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6). Then, to explore the whole immune profile

and define relationship with groups of patients, we performed correspondence analysis (CA) using,
as a variable, the abundance of the myeloid (n = 4) and the lymphoid (n = 22) clusters differentially
expressed between groups of patients (Fig. 3D). CA was developed to analyze frequency tables and
visualize similarities between patients and co-occurrence of cell subsets (31). The first and second
dimension of the correspondence analysis explained 80.5 % and 13.5 % of the difference,
respectively (Fig. 3D). The top-ten cell populations explaining the difference between COVIDpos
and COVIDneg patients were Mo243, Mo180, T8_146, NK_244, and T8_161 being increased and
Mo181, T4_6, Mo11, T8_99, and T4_45 being decreased in COVIDpos. Altogether, these subsets
corresponded to an increase in inflammatory monocytes (CD169high CD64high), Tbethigh Th1-like
CD8 T cells, and mature NK cells and a decrease in naïve T4 cells and effector memory T4 and T8
cells. Interestingly, only the first dimension of the correspondence analysis segregated COVID19posARDSpos from COVID-19negARDSpos (P < 0.001) and no statistical differences were found
between COVID-19posARDSpos and COVID-19posARDSneg (Fig. 3D).

Evolution of immune cell clusters between D0 and D7 in COVID-19 patients defines highrisk clinical grade
We next performed mass cytometry analysis for 21 patients at day 7 of hospitalization, including 7
COVID-19negARDSpos, 8 COVID-19posARDSpos, and 6 COVIDposARDSneg patients, in order to
follow up the kinetic of PBMC phenotypic alterations. The 42 samples (21 at day 0 and 21 at day
7) were parsed by correspondence analysis using, as a variable, the abundance of myeloid and
lymphoid clusters (Fig. 4A). The first and second dimensions of the correspondence analysis
explained 85.1 % and 9 % of the differences acquired between D0 and D7. The first dimension
captured the difference between D0 and D7 only for COVID-19posARDSpos (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A).
Because of the limited number of samples, only a trend was observed for COVIDposARDSneg (P =

0.062). The top-five enriched populations explaining the differences between D0 and D7 for
COVID-19posARDSpos patients were Mo11, Mo181, T8_113, T4_34, and NK_197, corresponding
to an enrichment in non-classical monocytes (CD14lowCD16highCD64lowCD36lowS100A9high), in MMDSC-like (HLA-DRlowS100A9high), in effector memory CD127high T8 cells, in T4 naïve cells,
and in Ki-67high proliferating NK cells. These 5 cell subsets were integrated in an immune score
combining their fold change between D0 and D7. To define the relevance of this immune score in
discriminating COVID-19 patients with unfavorable prognosis, we built a clinical score as the sum
of events occurring during ICU stay (thromboembolic, ICU-acquired infection, septic shock, renal
failure, and deaths) (Table 1). Interestingly, both the clinical and the immune scores were found
correlated in severe COVID-19 patients, irrespectively of their ARDS status (Spearman R = 0.58;
P < 0.05) (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
Immune response to COVID-19 infection has been recently intensively studied at transcriptomic
and proteomic levels. However, most studies focused on either the lymphoid (15, 17, 19) or the
myeloid compartments (9, 16, 18), and only few performed a wide analysis of the circulating
immune landscape (10, 12, 13, 20, 32), thus precluding the definition of complex patterns of
immune parameter alterations associated with COVID-19 severity or physiopathology. Moreover,
these works were designed to identify differences in immune cell subset frequencies between
COVID-19 patients and healthy donors, and eventually correlated with the severity of the disease,
but did not include severe non-COVID-19 patients as controls, although critically ill patients were
largely demonstrated previously to display immune reprogramming (33). ARDS is a major adverse
event occurring during ICU stay, leading to an overall mortality rate of 40 % to 60 %. Whether
COVID-19 associated ARDS is clinically and biologically similar to other causes of ARDS remains

controversial (34, 35). To address this point, we characterized for the first time, by mass cytometry,
the immune landscape in COVID-19-associated ARDS compared to other causes of ARDS. We
demonstrated that an increase of CD169pos monocytes, correlated with specific changes of T,
plasma, and NK cell subsets, defines COVID-19-associated ARDS and is not found for bacteriaassociated ARDS, suggesting a COVID-19 specific immune reprogramming.
The amplification of CD169pos circulating monocytes has already been highlighted in the context
of COVID-19 (11, 18, 36, 37), and is reminiscent of other inflammatory conditions found in viral
infections, such as with Human Immunodeficiency Virus or Epstein-Barr Virus, in which the
CD169 sialoadhesin is induced in an IFN-dependent manner on the surface of circulating
monocytes (38, 39). Consistent with the inflammatory response, we showed that the accumulation
of CD169pos monocytes in COVID-19pos patients is positively correlated with an increase of
plasmablasts and mature plasma cells, Th1-like CD8 effector T cells, cytotoxic mature NK cells,
and activated CD4 effector memory T cells displaying a CTLA4highPD1high phenotype. CD169pos
activated monocytes were detected in mild disease (18), and were proposed to rise rapidly and
transiently in patients with COVID-19, in association with a high expression of IFNγ and CCL8
(11). This could be due to the transient nature of this monocytic population, either losing CD169,
being short-lived, or being recruited into tissues as CD169pos macrophages, as suggested by the
high expression of CCR2 on Mo243 and Mo180, the two monocyte subsets identified here in
COVID-19 patients, and the local inflammation and lung tissue destruction mediated by monocytederived macrophages in severe cases of SARS-CoV2 infections (40, 41). Interestingly, we also
found an upregulation of cytoplasmic S100A9 in monocyte subsets specifically amplified in
COVID-19 patients irrespectively of their ARDS status. These data suggest that, in the early stage
of the disease, monocytes could contribute to the burst of circulating calprotectin

(S100A8/S100A9), recently proposed to contribute to the secondary cytokine release syndrome
described in severe COVID-19 and attributed to neutrophils (18).
Within severe COVID-19 patients, we detected no significant differences between ARDSpos and
ARDSneg immune profiles, indicating a specificity of the phenotype induced by SARS-CoV2
infection, irrespectively of the respiratory complications. While most published studies showed
differences between mild and severe COVID-19 diseases, some of their conclusions might be
obscured by the fact that ARDS by itself, mechanical ventilation, and/or nonspecific treatments
might impact immune parameters (42). A strength of our study comparing two groups of severe
COVID-19 patients with or without ARDS is to highlight features directly related to the viral
infection rather than to its respiratory complications or their treatment. Importantly, our cohort was
homogeneous regarding treatment with in particular no immunosuppressive therapy at the time of
sampling.
The small size of our cohort did not allow us to pinpoint a mortality prognostic factor based on our
phenotypic data. However, we identified a specific immune pattern associated with the occurrence
of the major adverse clinical events (thrombosis, nosocomial infection, septic shock, acute renal
failure, and death) described in COVID-19 and combined as a clinical score. In particular, an
increase of non-classical CD14lowCD16pos monocytes (Mo11), and CD14posHLA-DRlow M-MDSClike (Mo181), both not expressing CD169, are markers of adverse events. This suggests that besides
the early increase of CD169pos monocytes in all COVID-19 patients associated with T-cell
dysfunctions, the immunological response to SARS-CoV2 infection features multiple alterations
of monocytic subsets reflecting the severity of the disease. Consistent with these data, it was shown
that CD14posHLA-DRlow cells were increased in critical COVID-19 patients (16, 21), while
CD14lowCD16pos monocytes were correlated with the length of stay in ICU (11, 18). To our

knowledge, our study is the first to correlate the accumulation of non-classical monocytes and MMDSCs occurring during the first days of ICU to adverse events.
Besides the low number of included patients, our study has some limitations. By focusing on severe
patients with and without ARDS, we cannot make conclusions about phenotypic changes in mild
and moderate diseases. Moreover, since the mass cytometry was conducted on PBMCs, we lack
information on the neutrophil lineage, which appears affected in the COVID-19 (18). It would also
be interesting to link these data with in situ data from lung tissue samples and bronchoalveolar
lavages. However, our detailed analysis of circulating immune cells shows that immune monitoring
of severe COVID-19 patients brings interesting prognostic biomarkers independently of their
clinical classification in ARDSpos versus ARDSneg. Moreover, we demonstrated that at the
biological level, COVID-19 associated ARDS is different from other causes of ARDS, and might
benefit from personalized therapy in addition to standard ARDS management (18, 43).

blood was collected in tubes containing lithium heparin from COVID-19negARDSpos, COVID19posARDSpos, and COVID-19posARDSneg patients. Peripheral blood samples were drawn at D0 and
D7. PBMC were isolated from whole blood using ficoll before cryopreservation. All patients
provided written informed consent. The following data were recorded: gender, age, preexisting
chronic kidney disease and acute kidney failure during the ICU stay (44), preexisting chronic heart

failure (45), Body Mass Index (BMI), SAPS II at admission (46), duration of mechanical
ventilation, length of hospital stay, and outcome (alive or dead) on day 7, day 30 and day 90. The
occurrence of nosocomial infection, defined following CDC criteria as previously described (47),
was also recorded during hospital stay. For each patient, a clinical score was built to summarize
the occurrence of adverse clinical events frequently encountered during hospitalization (47, 48).
Each of the following events: thromboembolic events, nosocomial infection, septic shock, acute
renal failure, and death counting as one point, the score varies from 0 (no adverse events) to 5.
Patients characteristics are reported in table 1.

Mass cytometry analysis
PBMC from patients were thawed. Briefly, cells were stained 5 minutes in RPMI supplemented
with 0.5 µM Cisplatin Cell-ID™ (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA) in RPMI 1640 before washing
with 10% FCS in RPMI 1640. Cell pellets were resuspended in 80µl of 0.5% BSA in PBS. Then
60µl of each surface staining cocktail, lymphoid or myeloid, were added to 40µl of resuspended
cells. After staining, cells were washed in 0.5% BSA in PBS before fixation/permeabilization with
the transcription factor staining buffer set (Miltenyi, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Then 60µl of
each surface staining cocktail, lymphoid or myeloid, were added to 40µl of resuspended cells in
Perm Buffer. After intracellular staining, cells were washed twice before staining in DNA
intercalator solution (2.5% Paraformaldehyde, 1:3200 Cell-ID™ Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm, San
Francisco, CA) in PBS). Samples were cryopreserved at -80°C until acquisition on Helios™
System (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA).

After acquisition, intrafile signal drift was normalized and .fcs files were obtained using CyTOF
software. To diminish batch effects, all files were normalized on EQ Beads (Fluidigm Sciences)
using the premessa R package (https://github.com/ParkerICI/premessa). Files were then uploaded
to the Cytobank cloud-based platform (Cytobank, Inc.). Data were first arcsinh-transformed using
a cofactor of 5. For all files, live single cells were selected by applying a gate on DNA1 vs. DNA2
followed by a gate on DNA1 vs. Cisplatin, then beads were removed by applying a gate on the
beads channel (Ce140Di) vs. DNA.1 Normalized, transformed and gated values were exported as
FCS files.

CellCnn analysis
Identification of a Covid-19-specific cell-identity signature was carried out using the CellCnn
algorithm (28), implemented in Pytorch in the ScaiVision platform (version 0.3.6, © Scailyte AG).
Briefly, this is a supervised machine learning algorithm that trains a convolutional neural network
with a single layer to predict sample-level labels using single-cell data as inputs.
The first 39 samples at day0 were analyzed by CellCnn. Data from each CyTOF panel was analyzed
separately, in each case using all measured protein markers to train a series of CellCnn networks
with varying hyperparameters. Each sample was given a label corresponding to the Covid-19 status
of the patient from which the sample was drawn (positive or negative). To generate input data for
training CellCnn, sub-samples of 2000 cells, termed multi-cell inputs (MCIs), were chosen
randomly from each sample independently. For each training epoch, 2000 MCIs from each label
class (Covid-19pos or Covid-19neg) were presented to the network in random order. During training,
30 % of the samples were set aside for validation, chosen in a stratified manner to maintain the
relative proportions of each class. 50 independent networks were generated for each CyTOF panel
using hyperparameters randomly chosen from the following options: i) number of filters: (2, 3, 5,

7, and 10), ii) top-k pooling percentage: (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30), iii) dropout probability: (0.3, 0.4,
and 0.6), iv) learning rate: (0.001, 0.003, and 0.01), and v) weight decay: (0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001,
0.01, and 0.1). Training was performed with a batch size of 50. Adam was used as an optimizer
{kingma2015adam}, with a beta1 coefficient of 0.999 and a beta2 coefficient of 0.99. Each network
was trained for a maximum of 50 epochs, or until the validation loss no longer decreased for 10
consecutive epochs. At the end of training, the weights from the epoch with lowest validation loss
were returned. Representative filters were determined by clustering the filters from all networks
achieving ≥ 90 % accuracy on the validation samples, then choosing the filter in each cluster with
the minimum distance to all other filters in that cluster. For both CyTOF panels, a single
representative filter showing the largest positive association with the Covid-19pos label class was
used to calculate cell-level filter response scores. Thresholds were set on the filter response scores
to select Covid-19-associated cells by calculating the relative frequencies of selected cells in each
sample at 100 different thresholds for each filter, then performing a logistic regression to predict
sample labels. For each threshold, the data was first split in a stratified manner into a training set,
comprising 60 % of samples, and a test set, comprising 40 % of samples. The logistic regression
was performed on the training set, and the accuracy of resulting predictions was calculated on the
test set. This procedure was performed 10 times, with randomly chosen training/test splits, and the
mean of the resulting accuracies for each threshold was calculated. For the lymphoid panel, one
threshold (9.63) achieved the highest accuracy and was set as the final threshold. For the myeloid
panel, multiple thresholds achieved the same level of accuracy; the lowest of these (4.96) was set
as the final threshold. The relative frequencies of cells in each sample with filter response scores
greater than or equal to the respective thresholds were calculated and compared using a Wilcoxon
rank-sum test.

viSNE, FlowSOM, and hierarchical clustering
We first performed a dimension reduction for both panels (i.e. myeloid and lymphoid) and all
cleaned-up 63 files were first analyzed using viSNE, based upon the Barnes–Hut implementation
of t-SNE. Equal downsampling was performed, based on the lowest event count in all files
(lymphoid panel) or on the maximum total events allowed by Cytobank (myeloid panel). For the
myeloid panel, the following parameters were used: perplexity = 45; iterations = 5000; theta = 0.5;
all 37 channels selected. For the lymphoid panel the parameters were as follows: perplexity = 45;
iterations = 7500; theta = 0.5; all 36 channels selected.
Then we applied a clustering method using the FlowSOM clustering algorithm. FlowSOM uses
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to partition cells into clusters based on their phenotype, and then
builds a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) to connect the nodes of the SOM, allowing the
identification of metaclusters (i.e. group of clusters). We performed the FlowSOM algorithm on
the previous viSNE results, using all events and panel channels, and the following parameters:
clustering method = hierarchical consensus, iterations = 10, number of clusters = 256, number of
metaclusters = 30. For both panels, each metacluster (containing a given number of clusters) was
manually annotated based on his marker expression phenotype, his projection on the viSNE and
his localization in the FlowSOM MST.
We first analyzed the myeloid panel. Out of 30 metaclusters defined by the FlowSOM approach,
we identified 13 metaclusters with monocyte markers, other metaclusters contained other cell types,
low count of cells or remaining doublets or dead cells. We visually identified 2 (Mo18 and Mo26)
out or the 13 metaclusters that were heterogeneous. These 2 metaclusters were manually splited
into 2 new metaclusters (identified respectively as Mo180, Mo181 and Mo214, Mo243) (Fig. S1B).
Thus, altogether we analyzed 15 metaclusters of myeloid cells. Regarding the lymphoid
compartment, we noticed that FlowSOM defined metaclusters at the lineage level, thus we retain

all the 136 clusters included in 10 metaclusters of interest (i.e. containing lymphoid lineage
markers) (Fig. S1C). All metaclusters and clusters phenotypes including their abundances and mean
marker intensity were then exported from Cytobank for further analyses. Cytometry data was
explored with Kaluza Analysis Software (Beckman Coulter). Hierarchical clustering and heatmaps
were generated with R v3.6.3, using Rstudio v1.2.5033 and the pheatmap package.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism 8.4.3. P values were defined by a
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s post-test for multiple group comparisons or by Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed rank tests as appropriate. Correlations were calculated using Spearman test.
* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** < 0.001, and **** P < 0.0001. Hierarchical clustering of the patients
was performed using euclidean distance and complete clustering. Correspondence analysis was
performed using the package factoshiny using as variable the abundance in cell subsets for each
patient.
