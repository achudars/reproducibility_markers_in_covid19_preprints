Understanding mid-term kinetics of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is the cornerstone
for public health control of the pandemic and vaccine development. However,
current evidence is rather based on limited measurements, losing sight of the
temporal pattern of these changes1–6. In this longitudinal analysis, conducted on a
prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients followed up to 242 days, we found that
individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection experienced an insignificant decay
in neutralizing activity that persisted six months after symptom onset or diagnosis.
Hospitalized individuals showed higher neutralizing titers, which decreased
following a two-phase pattern, with an initial rapid decline that significantly slowed
after day 80. Despite this initial decay, neutralizing activity at six months remained
higher among hospitalized individuals. The slow decline in neutralizing activity at
mid-term contrasted with the steep slope of antibody titers change, reinforcing the
hypothesis that the quality of immune response evolves over the post-convalescent
stage4,5.
Our analysis included 210 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,
recruited during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in Catalonia
(North-East Spain). Of them, 106 (50.5%) had a mild or asymptomatic infection, and 104
(49.5%) required hospitalization because of respiratory compromise (Table 1). We
collected samples periodically throughout a maximum follow-up period of 242 days
(Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Most study participants developed a
neutralizing humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 HIV-based pseudoviruses, that was
confirmed using infectious viruses. However, in line with trends reported elsewhere2,3,
mildly affected or asymptomatic individuals developed a 10-fold lower maximal
neutralization titer than those who required hospitalization when the full dataset was
analyzed (p<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 1a). The higher number of determinations

obtained from hospitalized individuals during the acute phase permitted the clear
observation of a sharp initial response (Fig. 1b-c), also reported in previous analyses of
the early response7–11. This was visible for individuals recruited during both the first
(March-June 2020) and the second (July-October 2020) waves of COVID-19 pandemic
in Catalonia. A longitudinal analysis fitted to a four-parameter logistic model of increase
defined a 30-day sharpening phase after symptom onset, irrespective of the wave in which
hospital admission occurred. Half maximal neutralization activity was achieved on day
10 (95% confidence interval, CI 8-11); 80% maximal response, which corresponded to
3.97 logs (i.e., 9,333 reciprocal dilution), was achieved on day 14 (Fig. 1d). Based on this
finding, we assumed no significant differences between the two waves regarding early
neutralizing response and we decided to set day 30 after symptom onset as a starting point
for the longitudinal analysis of immune response at the mid-term.
While the early humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been thoroughly
described7–11, current data on the decay of antibody levels beyond the convalescent stage
depict a heterogeneous scenario with limited information on the neutralizing activity
throughout the follow-up period1–3. Various authors have recently suggested more
complex kinetics of neutralizing activity decay, with clonotype-, epitope-, or subjectspecific patterns that evolve in terms of potency and resistance to epitope mutations4,5,12.
The longitudinal modeling of the neutralizing activity at mid-term in our cohort revealed
a nearly flat slope (i.e., not significantly different from 0, with half-life 2134 days) in
individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild disease (Fig. 2a). Conversely, the
decrease of neutralizing activity in hospitalized individuals showed a two-phase pattern,
with a rapid decay (half-life 31 days) until day 80 that slowed down to a flat slope (halflife 753 days) from that time point on (Fig. 2b).

The characterization of the neutralizing activity behavior at mid-term should ultimately
project the proportion of post-convalescent individuals protected against new infections
in the mid- and long-term. The limited number of measures and lack of a clear threshold
of neutralizing activity for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection precluded assessing this
outcome using survival analysis. Alternatively, we explored the neutralizing activity at
the end of our 6-month follow-up period. Based on the mixed-effects model obtained
from the longitudinal analysis, we estimated a stable mid-term neutralizing activity of
2.72 and 3.16 log for the mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized subgroups, respectively
(p<0.0001; likelihood ratio test, Fig. 2c, dotted lines). This estimate was consistent with
the observed values for the last measurement taken between days 135 and 242, a time
frame centered on day 180 (Fig. 2c, box plots). Likewise, the value distribution at this
time frame showed significant differences between mild/asymptomatic (median 2.5; IQR
2.0–3.0) and hospitalized (3.0; 2.7–3.3) individuals (p=0.0012, Mann-Whitney test). To
date, no clear cut-off for a neutralizing activity that protects against new reinfection has
been established. Nevertheless, data gathered from high attack rate events suggest that
neutralizing activities between 1:161 and 1:3,082 are strong enough to prevent
infection13. Hence, we assumed that reinfections would be unlikely among individuals
above the 1:250 cut-off. Of the 23 hospitalized individuals with measurement beyond day
135, 21 (91%) had a mean neutralizing activity value above 1:250 in the 135-242 days
period and were thus considered long-term neutralizers. The corresponding proportion in
the mild/asymptomatic group (42%; 19/45) was significantly lower (p=0.0052, Chi
square test, Fig. 2d). Although this number must be taken cautiously due to the cut-off
assumption, our finding suggests that hospitalized patients have a higher capacity for
long-term neutralization, despite the faster initial decay in neutralization activity.

It has recently been proposed that the kinetics of neutralizing activity may not mirror
those of antibody titers4. Hence, we investigated the change in serum titers of IgG in a
subset of 28 individuals (14 in each severity group) with the most extended follow-up
period. The analysis included antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and
S2 subunit of the S protein, both associated with potential neutralizing activity; and the
nucleoprotein (NP), which are very abundant, albeit unable to neutralize the SARS-CoV2 directly14. The longitudinal analysis revealed a one-phase significant (p<0.0001) steady
decay pattern of the three tested antibodies, which was notably faster in IgG anti-NP (Fig.
3a-c). The half-life of anti-RBD, anti-S2, and anti-NP antibodies for the period beyond
day 30 were 86, 108, and 59 days, respectively. These values were consistent with those
reported by Wheatley et al., estimated on a 160-day time frame4. Although the limited
sample size of this sub-analysis precluded independent modeling of the decay in
mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized patients, the latter showed significantly higher titers
of anti-S2 at the end of the follow-up period (Figure S2), whereas no significant
differences were found in other antibodies regarding disease status. Interestingly, in this
subset of individuals, the decay in antibody titers contrasted with the behavior of
neutralizing activity, which fitted to a two-phase model―as in the whole dataset―with
a rapid decay until day 80 (slope 0.014, half-life 22 days) and a flat slope (i.e., not
significantly different from 0) afterward (Fig. 3d).
Complementary data on the binding affinity and B-cell clone abundance at the same time
points would provide a more comprehensive picture to explain this divergent trend.
However, our findings support the hypothesis of Gaebler et al., who suggested that the
accumulation of IgG somatic mutations―and subsequent production of antibodies with
increased neutralizing potency―allow the maintenance of neutralizing activity levels,
despite the decline in specific antibody titers5. Of note, our follow-up period encompassed

two waves of the COVID-19 outbreak in our country. Individuals infected during the first
wave were likely to be exposed to high viral pressure in their environment, potentially
favoring further virus exposure that may also contribute to boosting humoral responses,
adding to the mechanism proposed by Gaebler et al5.
Our analysis is limited by the reduced sample size, particularly in the mild/asymptomatic
subgroup, for which we failed to identify a two-phase pattern decay of neutralizing
activity. Despite the limited sample size, the availability of multiple measures along the
follow-up period allowed us to provide a longitudinal perspective on neutralizing activity,
and antibody titer behavior. This analysis supplements current evidence regarding midterm immunity against SARS-CoV-2, based on two- or three-point measurements3–5. Our
longitudinal analysis confirmed the slow decay and mid-term maintenance of neutralizing
activity observed in other cohorts with a 5-to-11% prevalence of hospitalized patients3,5.
In this regard, the two-phase behavioral pattern of neutralizing activity observed in
hospitalized individuals suggests that the rapid decay reported in previous
characterizations1 might be due to the abundance of individuals in this early phase.
Furthermore, apparent inconsistencies found between the declines of neutralizing activity
and IgG titers reinforce the idea proposed by other authors that the behavior of antibody
titers may not mirror the neutralizing activity4. Taken together, current evidence on
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests stability of neutralizing activity, pointing
towards an optimistic scenario for the establishment of infection- or vaccine-mediated
herd immunity. Still, long-term data available on other human coronaviruses show
waning of antibodies 1-to-2 years after infection15,16, with uncertainty regarding the
immune response behavior in the context of vaccine-mediated immunity17. The continuity
of our prospective cohort of individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection will
provide novel insights into the long-term kinetics of the immune response.

Methods
Study overview and subjects
The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee Board from Hospital
Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, HUGTiP (reference PI-20-122 and PI-20-217) and all
participants provided written informed consent before inclusion.
Plasma samples were obtained from individuals of the prospective KING cohort of the
HUGTiP (Badalona, Spain), designed to characterize virological and immunological
features of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recruitment period lasted from March to October
2020, thus covering the first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Catalonia
(dadescovid.cat). The KING cohort included more than 200 individuals with a
documented positive RT-qPCR result from nasopharyngeal swab and/or a positive
serological ELISA test performed in our hospital, irrespective of age and disease
severity―including asymptomatic status. Individuals were recruited in various settings,
including primary care, hospital, and epidemiological surveillance based on contact
tracing. We collected plasma samples at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis and at 3 and 6
months. Additionally, hospitalized individuals were sampled twice a week during the
acute phase. For the longitudinal analysis of immune response kinetics, we selected only
samples from patients with at least two determinations during the follow-up period (30242 days).

Humoral response determination by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA)
The humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using an in-house sandwichELISA. The following SARS-CoV-2 antigens were purchased from Sino Biological
(Eschborn, Germany): S2 (Ser686-Pro1213, produced using insect cells), RBD (Arg319Phe541, produced in HEK293 cells), and nucleocapsid protein (NP) (whole molecule,
produced in insect cells). Briefly, Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates were coated with 50 µL
of capture antibody (anti-6x-His antibody clone HIS.H8; 2 µg/mL; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4ºC.
After washing, plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS solution (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for two hours at room temperature. Plates were rewashed,
and the antigens were added at 1 µg/mL concentration (50 µL/well) and incubated
overnight at 4ºC. Plasma samples were heat-inactivated before use (56ºC for 30 minutes)
and analyzed by duplicate with each SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the same plate, along with
antigen-free wells to assess background. Serial dilution of a positive plasma sample was
used as standard. A pool of ten plasmas collected from healthy controls before August
2019 was used as a negative control. Standards, negative control, and plasma samples
were diluted in blocking buffer. After blocking, the plates were washed and standards,
negative control, and diluted plasma samples were added to the plate (50 µL/well) and
incubated for one hour at room temperature. The HRP conjugated (Fab)2 goat anti-human
IgG (Fc specific) (1/20,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ely, UK) was used as a
secondary antibody and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were
revealed with o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and the reaction was stopped using 4N of H2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich). The signal
was analyzed as the optical density (OD) at 492 nm with noise correction at 620 nm. The

specific signal for each antigen was calculated after subtracting the background signal
obtained for each sample in antigen-free wells. Results were calculated using a 5
Parameter Logistic (5PL) curve and expressed as arbitrary units (AU) according to the
standard.
Pseudovirus generation and neutralization assay
HIV reporter pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein and Luciferase were
generated. pNL4-3.Luc.R-.E- was obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program18.
SARS-CoV-2.SctΔ19 was generated (GeneArt) from the full protein sequence of SARSCoV-2 spike with a deletion of the last 19 amino acids in C-terminal19, human-codon
optimized and inserted into pcDNA3.4-TOPO. Expi293F cells were transfected using
ExpiFectamine 293 Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with pNL4-3.Luc.R-.E- and
SARS-CoV-2.SctΔ19 at a 24:1 ratio, respectively. Control pseudoviruses were obtained
by replacing the S protein expression plasmid with a VSV-G protein expression plasmid
as reported previously20. Supernatants were harvested 48 hours after transfection, filtered
at 0.45 µm, frozen, and titrated on HEK293T cells overexpressing WT human ACE-2
(Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA, USA).
Neutralization assays were performed in duplicate. Briefly, in Nunc 96-well cell culture
plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 200 TCID50 of pseudovirus was preincubated with
three-fold serial dilutions (1/60 – 1/14,580) of the heat-inactivated plasma samples (see
above) for 1 hour at 37ºC. Then, 2x104 HEK293T/hACE2 cells (Integral Molecular)
treated with DEAE-Dextran (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Results were read after 48
hours using the EnSight Multimode Plate Reader and BriteLite Plus Luciferase reagent
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The values were normalized, and the ID50 was
calculated by plotting the log of plasma dilution vs. response―Variable slope (four

parameters) in Prism 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). ID50 was defined
as the reciprocal of the dilution that inhibited 50% of the infection.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were described using medians and the interquartile range (IQR,
defined by the 25th and 75th percentiles), whereas categorical factors were reported as
percentages over available data. Quantitative variables between severity groups were
compared using the Mann-Whitney test, and percentages using the chi-squared test.
Kinetics of neutralizing activity and antibody titers were estimated from symptom
onset―or serological diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals―and modeled using mixedeffects models and in two steps. First, a 4-parameter logistic function was adjusted for
the first 30 days after diagnosis using non-linear mixed models. Mid-term decay was
analyzed using a piecewise regression with two decline slopes for data beyond 30 days,
with a breakpoint at 80 days. For the latter analysis, linear mixed-effect models with
random intercepts and slopes were used, and different breakpoints were tested; the one
with the best adjustment was chosen. For the longitudinal analysis of neutralizing activity,
patients were grouped into two severity groups according to the WHO progression scale
as proposed elsewhere21: asymptomatic or mild (levels 1-3), and hospitalized (levels 410). Differences between the two severity groups were assessed using the likelihood ratio
test. The longitudinal analysis of antibody titers was performed on a subset of 28
individuals (14 in each severity group) with the highest number of measures during the
follow-up; owing to the limited sample size, all 28 individuals were analyzed as a single
group. All analyses were performed with Prism 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software) and R version
4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Mixed-effects models was fitted using
“nlme” R package.

Figures

Fig 1. Neutralizing activity among study participants. a, Maximal neutralization titer
of 210 individuals recruited, according to disease severity (light and dark blue for
mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals, respectively). Boxes show the median
and the interquartile range, and bars the 10th and 90th percentiles. Distributions were
compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Individual values are ranked for comparative
purposes. b and c, Longitudinal dot plot of neutralizing activity among hospitalized
individuals admitted during the first (b) and second (c) waves of the COVID-19 epidemic
in our area; filled (b) and empty (c) blue dots show the early (i.e., 30 days after diagnosis)
increasing phase. d, Magnification of the early phase for individuals admitted during the
first (filled symbols) and second (empty symbols) waves. No differences between waves
were observed. The solid line shows the non-linear fit (mixed-model estimate) for the
whole dataset (125 samples, 55 individuals analyzed). Two samples from late
seroconverters (one from each wave, grey dots) were excluded from the analysis.

Fig. 2. Longitudinal analysis of neutralizing activity. a, Individual measurements
(dots) and linear mixed model (solid orange line) of the longitudinal analysis for mild or
asymptomatic individuals beyond day 30 (single-phase slope -0.00014; p=0.75,
likelihood ratio test; estimated half-life 2,134 days). Time points preceding day 30 as well
as participants only showing undetectable titers were excluded from the analysis, values
are shown but grayed out. b, the corresponding analysis for hospitalized individuals (the
slopes of the linear fit for the first and second phase were -0.0096 [p=0.0002] [half-life
31 days] and -00004 [half-life 753 days] [p=0.78], respectively). c, Distribution of
neutralizing activity six months after infection in both disease severity groups.
Experimental values of mean neutralizing activities in the period 135-to-242 days as
summarized in box-plots (as in Figure 1a; Mann-Whitney test for comparative analysis)
and modeled data as dotted lines (likelihood ratio test for comparative analysis). d,
Frequency of long-term neutralizers (i.e., individuals with mean neutralizing activity
>250 in the 135-242 days period) in each severity subgroup (Chi square test p value is
shown).

Fig. 3. Longitudinal analysis of IgG titers. a, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD). b,
anti-S2. c, anti-nucleoprotein. d, overall neutralizing activity in the same set of samples.
All analyses were performed on a subset of individuals with largest follow-up (n=14 for
mild/asymptomatic in light blue and n=14 for hospitalized in dark blue; total no. of
samples 94). Solid orange lines show the linear mixed model estimate for the period
beyond day 30. Kinetics of antibody decay (panels a-c) were calculated excluding
timepoints preceding the maximal values for each patient. Kinetics of neutralizing
antibodies excluded samples preceding day 30 (as in Fig 2a/b). All excluded values are
shown but grayed out.
