Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is exacting an increasing toll worldwide, with new SARS-CoV-2
variants emerging that exhibit higher infectivity rates and that may partially evade vaccine and
antibody immunity1. Rapid deployment of non-invasive therapeutic avenues capable of preventing
infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variants could complement current vaccination efforts and help turn
the tide on the COVID-19 pandemic2. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs). We
identified an LNA ASO binding to the 5’ leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a/b that disrupts
a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy in preventing viral replication in
human cells. Daily intranasal administration of this LNA ASO in the K18-hACE2 humanized
COVID-19 mouse model potently (98-99%) suppressed viral replication in the lungs of infected
mice, revealing strong prophylactic and treatment effects. We found that the LNA ASO also
represses viral infection in golden Syrian hamsters, and is highly efficacious in countering all
SARS-CoV-2 “variants of concern” tested in vitro and in vivo, including B.1.427, B.1.1.7, and
B.1.351 variants3. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising
therapeutic approach to reduce transmission of variants partially resistant to vaccines and
monoclonal antibodies, and could be deployed intranasally for prophylaxis or via lung delivery by
nebulizer to decrease severity of COVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically
stable and can be flexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences4, and they may have
particular impact in areas where vaccine distribution is a challenge, and could be stockpiled for
future coronavirus pandemics.
Main
The global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the highly pathogenic novel
human SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)5. By contrast with previous outbreaks of related betacoronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome conronavirus (MERS-CoV)), SARS-CoV-2 infection causes lower mortality
rate, however, the virus has a higher human-to-human transmission rate6, facilitating rapid spread
across the world. As of May 2021, there are more than 150 million confirmed positive cases and
in excess of 3 million reported deaths (WHO; www.who.int). Although vaccines are markedly
slowing the increase in positive cases and deaths in a few developed countries, most nations,
especially in the developing world, do not have readily accessible vaccines7, and there is aversion
among segments of the global population to vaccination7. Moreover, mutated variant strains of
SARS-CoV-2 that evade immunity in response to previous infection or vaccination are rapidly
emerging, and are causing new local outbreaks, frequently amongst younger individuals and with
more severe disease1,8. Indeed, more than 80 variants have been identified to date, all with
mutations in the Spike protein9, which SARS-CoV-2 utilizes for binding to the host cell-surface
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) during host cell entry10. Several “variants of
concern”, which harbor mutations in Spike that facilitate immune evasion and, in some cases,
partial vaccine and monoclonal antibody therapeutics resistance, are spreading rapidly world-wide.
These include B.1.1.7 (UK variant), B.1.351 (South African/SA variant), P.1 (Brazilian variant),
B.1.427/B.1.429 (CA variants), and B.1.617 (Indian variant), which are all more contagious and
may in some cases lead to more severe disease11. The continuous evolution of the virus thus poses
a daunting challenge to achieving “herd immunity”. Traditional drug screening and vaccine
development is time intensive, and may not be able to match the speed of emerging drug- or
vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains. There is clearly an urgent need for alternative approaches,
including the rapid development of therapeutics that are active against all variants of concern.

To address these challenges, we developed a novel strategy to inhibit the replication of SARSCoV-2 using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting viral RNAs. ASOs, which rely on
Watson-Crick base-pairing to target specific complementary RNA sequences, can be quickly
designed to target any viral or host RNA sequence, including non-coding structural elements that
may be important for viral replication, and may recruit RNase H for cleavage (gapmers) or act
through steric hindrance (mixmers)4. ASOs are typically well tolerated, and a number of ASO
therapeutics have been approved for clinical use12. Additionally, ASO manufacturing is well
established and can be readily scaled-up. We have employed chemically modified gapmer and
mixmer ASOs containing interspersed locked nucleic acid nucleotide bases (LNAs) and DNA
nucleotides linked by phosphorothioate (PS) bonds. The introduced chemical modifications confer
increased affinity, stability and improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties13,14,15.
SARS-CoV-2 is a compact (30 kilobases) positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, with a 5’
untranslated region (UTR), the ORF1a/b RNA encoding non-structural viral proteins, and a 3’
segment encoding the structural RNAs, such as the Spike protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor
on host cells, and the nucleocapsid N protein involved in virion assembly, and a 3’UTR16. The 5’
UTR, a non-coding segment consisting of multiple highly conserved stem-loop and more complex
secondary structures, is functionally critical for viral translation and replication by affording
protection from host cell antiviral defenses and through selective promotion of viral transcript
translation over those of the host cell, at least in part through the recruitment of the viral nonstrctural protein 1 (Nsp1)17. The 5’ UTR begins with a short 5’ leader sequence (nucleotides 1-69),
which is added via discontinuous transcription to the 5' end of all sub-genomic RNA transcripts
encoding the viral structural proteins, and regulates their translation as well as translation of
ORF1a/b from full-length genomic RNA18. The ORF1a/b also contains a structured and highly
conserved frameshift stimulation element (FSE) near its center that controls a shift in the protein
translation reading frame by one nucleotide of ORF1a/b genes 3’ to the FSE. The FSE and accurate
frame shifting is crucial for the expression of ORF1b, which encodes five non-structural proteins
including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) essential for SARS-CoV-2 genome
replication19.
We designed multiple LNA ASOs targeting the 5’ leader sequence, downstream sequences in the
5’ untranslated region (UTR) of ORF1a/b, and the ORF1a/b FSE of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1a and
Extended Data Table 1). Additionally, given the importance of the Spike protein in host cell entry
for SARS-CoV-2 infection, LNA ASOs targeting the Spike coding sequence were also tested (Fig.
1a and Extended Data Table 1). To evaluate the viral repressive effect of LNA ASOs, the initial
screening was carried out in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells, which exhibit excellent transfection
efficiency and are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2. Cells transfected with LNA ASOs were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and both cells and medium were collected at 48h post-infection (hpi)
for RNA extraction and infectious viral particle determination, respectively. The viral titer was
measured by detecting the expression level/copy number of Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) using
reverse transcription (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR). The screening results showed that the
treatment with certain LNA ASOs lead to a dramatic decrease of N and S expression (Fig. 1b and
1c, Extended Data Fig. 1a and 1b).
Interestingly, we found that LNA ASOs targeting the 5’ leader region of SARS-CoV-2 were
particularly effective in suppressing viral RNA levels in infected cells (Fig. 1b and Extended Data
Fig. 1a). This is consistent with the fact that the 5’ leader sequence is present in all viral RNA
transcripts and is required for viral replication. The most potent LNA ASO targeting the 5’ leader,
5’-ASO#26, was selected for further investigation of its viral repression capability. The repressive

effect of 5’-ASO#26 was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner by measuring the expression
level of viral RNAs (Fig. 1d) and by directly determining the viral titer of infectious particles with
the Fifty-percent Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) assay in Vero E6 African green monkey
kidney epithelial cells (Fig. 1e).
Although the 5’ UTR nucleotide sequences are somewhat divergent amongst the coronavirus
family, the secondary structure of the 5’ UTR is highly conserved20, and it has been shown that
two stem-loop structures, SL1 and SL2, are formed by the 5’ leader sequence21. Since the
complementary sequence of 5’-ASO#26 aligns along the 3’ portion of SL1 (marked in pink frame)
(Fig. 2c), we hypothesized that the viral repressive effect of 5’-ASO#26 may be in part due to its
ability to disrupt the secondary structure of the 5’ leader sequence upon binding to the viral
genomic or sub-genomic RNAs, interfering with the formation of the SL1 stem-loop structure. To
test if 5’-ASO#26 can disrupt the SL1 structure, we carried out in vitro transcription of the SARSCoV-2 5’ UTR sequence, added 5’-ASO#26 and treated samples with dimethyl sulfate (DMS).
DMS is able to specifically and rapidly methylate unpaired adenines (A) and cytosines (C) within
single-stranded sequences and not those that are complexed as RNA secondary structure or to the
LNA ASO, allowing for the unpaired A or C nucleotides to be detected by DMS-MaPseq22. Our
results strongly indicated that the secondary structure of SL1 was indeed interrupted by 5’ASO#26 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). We also performed DMS-MaPseq with SARSCoV-2-infected Huh-7 cells in the presence or absence of 5’-ASO#26, and monitored secondary
structure changes of SL1 at 6 hpi and 12 hpi. Similar to the findings with the in vitro assay, the
result from infected cells confirmed the disruption of the secondary structure of SL1 due to binding
of 5’-ASO#26 (Fig. 2b).
To evaluate the effects of 5’-ASO#26 in vivo, we employed humanized transgenic K18-hACE2
mice, which are expressing human ACE2 allowing SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infectious spread23.
K18-hACE2 mice were inoculated with 1×104 TCID50 units of the USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV2 strain via intranasal administration. No significant weight loss was observed at 4 days postinfection (dpi) (Extended Data Fig. 2a), consistent with previous studies indicating that weight loss
starts from 5 dpi23. Mice were treated with 5’-ASO#26 (400 µg) once-daily via intranasal
administration in saline, from 3 days before infection until 3 dpi (Fig. 3a). High levels of infectious
SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were detected in the lungs of the saline-treated control group (Saline),
whereas a remarkable decrease (>80-fold) in the viral load in lungs was observed in the LNA ASOtreated group (Fig. 3b). As expected, the levels of viral N and S RNA were also potently (98-99%)
repressed after LNA ASO treatment, as measured by RT-qPCR (Fig. 3c). Previous studies have
shown that golden Syrian hamsters can be infected with SARS-CoV-224. We inoculated hamsters
with 10 TCID50 units of the USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 strain and treated them with 5’ASO#26 (600 µg) following the same schedule as for the mouse studies (Fig. 3a). About 10-fold
decreased viral load in lung was observed in the LNA ASO-treated group and with no significant
weight change (Extended Data Fig. 2d, 2e). Considering that the dose was approximately 2.5-fold
lower per kg, the viral replication was still efficiently repressed in hamsters. To further investigate
the physiological effects of LNA ASO in mice, histological analyses were carried out with control
and LNA ASO-treated lung tissue after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analyses revealed clear
repression of N expression with LNA ASO treatment (Fig. 3d). Meanwhile, we did not observe
significant histological changes by H&E staining in either Saline or LNA ASO-treated mice, which
is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that significant inflammation and severe alveolar
wall thickening could only be observed at 7 dpi23. However, we did notice that the localized signal
of N correlated with local enrichment of CD3 (T cell marker), B220 (B cell marker) by
immunohistochemistry, and moderate thickening of the alveolar wall (by H&E staining) in Saline4

treated mice, but not in LNA ASO-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The viral repressive effect
of the LNA ASO was also examined by RNA-seq of lung tissues from mice with saline or LNA
ASO treatment. Consistent with results from the TCID50 assay, viral reads were dramatically
decreased in LNA ASO-treated mice when compared with that of the Saline control (Extended
Data Fig. 3a). To evaluate the in vivo effect of 5’-ASO#26, previous RNA-seq data from infected
K18-ACE2 mice23 was used to define up- and down-regulated genes in response to SARS-CoV-2
infection at 4 dpi (Extended Data Fig. 3e). As expected, expression profile changes induced by
infection were markedly rescued by LNA ASO treatment (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 3b).
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed strong enrichment of gene involved in type I and
II IFN signaling in infected mice treated with Saline (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3c), which is
consistent with previous studies showing induction of anti-viral defenses23. Interestingly, the
cholesterol homeostasis gene pathway was enriched in LNA ASO-treated mice (Fig. 3f and
Extended Data Fig. 3d). It has been reported that the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is necessary
for SARS-CoV-2 infection25,26 and decreased levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were reported in COVID-19 patients27, indicating a
comprehensive role of intracellular and extracellular cholesterol during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The restored cholesterol homeostasis in the lungs of LNA ASO-treated mice further indicates the
efficacy of the LNA ASO treatment.
To further evaluate the effect of 5’-ASO#26, we first confirmed that 5’-ASO#26 repressed viral
replication in vivo in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To explore the optimal
treatment time course, we assessed the efficacy of 5’-ASO#26 viral repression in pre-infection and
post-infection treatment regimens (Fig. 4a). We found that the strongest viral repressive effect was
observed in the Prophylactic #2 group (Fig. 4a), in which the mice were treated with LNA ASO
for four days, followed by infection 24 hrs later. Viral repression was also validated by staining of
N in mouse lung tissues (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Notably, a prophylactic effect was still observed
one week after LNA ASO treatment (Prophylactic #1, Fig. 4a). Starting LNA ASO treatment at 6
hpi also revealed a moderate repressive effect, whereas beginning treatment from 1 dpi showed no
repressive effect in mice (Treatment #3 and #4, Fig. 4a). These results show that 5’-ASO#26
exhibits potent effects as a prophylactic therapeutic. The diminished ability of late post-infection
treatment of 5’-ASO#26 to inhibit viral replication may be a result of rapidly accumulating subgenomic viral RNAs saturating the amount of administered LNA ASO in the lung due to the very
large dose of virus used to inoculate the mice. Considering that we directly administered the naked
5’-ASO#26 intranasally in saline, we believe that additional modifications of the LNA ASO (such
as lipid-conjugation28,29,30) may further promote cellular uptake of LNA ASO in lung, improving
the effect of post-infection LNA ASO treatment. Direct delivery of the LNA ASO to the lung via
nebulizer may also improve post-infection therapeutic effect.
Because the 5’ leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and as 5’-ASO#26 does not
target Spike, we predicted that 5’-ASO#26 should also be able to repress the replication of SARSCoV-2 variant strains. Therefore, we tested several reported variants with 5’-ASO#26 in cell-based
assays. Our results showed that regardless of the mutations, 5’-ASO#26 exhibits potent repressive
activity on viral replication of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351, D614G, B.1.1.7,
and B.1.427 (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 4b). We further tested the effect of 5’-ASO#26 in
vivo to repress the B.1.427 and B.1.1.7 strains in K18-hACE2 mice following the same schedule
showed in Fig. 3a. We performed both TCID50 assays and RT-qPCR of lung homogenates to assess
viral titer and observed that 5’-ASO#26 can also block the viral replication of both variant strains
in vivo (Fig. 4c, 4e and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Although mice were inoculated with same amount
of variant strains, the in vivo replication rate of B.1.427 was significantly lower than that of B.1.351,

however the viral titers of both variant strains were repressed to a similar degree by LNA ASO
treatment (Fig. 4c and 4e). Of note, similar to animals infected with the WA1 strain, the B.1.351
strain did not induce weight loss at 4 dpi (Fig. 4d). However, we noticed that there was a significant
weight loss induced by B.1.427 strain infection from 3 dpi in the saline-treated group (Fig. 4f). In
contrast, the LNA ASO-treated mice did not exhibit significant weight loss after B.1.427 strain
infection (Fig. 4f), indicating that the viral repressive effect of LNA ASO treatment is still able to
prevent the progression of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathologies.
Antisense therapy is currently used in clinical treatment for a range of different diseases, including
cytomegalovirus retinitis (Fomivirsen31), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Eteplirsen32), and Spinal
Muscular Atrophy (Nusinersen)33. Here we show for the first time that intranasally administered
LNA ASO treatment represents a promising therapeutic strategy for virus-induced respiratory
diseases such as COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that naked LNA ASOs delivered intranasally
in saline exhibit potent efficacy in vivo, and no formulation is necessary to achieve therapeutic
effect. Considering the relatively small-sized genomes of RNA viruses and the ability to rapidly
determine the sequence of any viral genome by next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, the
design and screening of anti-viral LNA ASOs can be very fast and efficient, allowing for a rapid
response to other global health crises posed by emerging viral threats in the future. The apparent
ability of single-stranded RNA viruses to accumulate immune-evading mutations presents great
challenges for vaccine and therapeutics development. Of note, LNA ASOs can overcome the
challenge of mutations due to the ability to design sequences specifically targeted to highly
conserved and critical regulatory regions of the viral genome. Additionally, LNA ASO cocktails
targeting multiple essential genomic regions of viruses may further increase the efficacy of LNA
ASOs as therapeutic candidates to overcome viral evasion mutations. In conclusion, we have
identified an intranasally delivered LNA ASO targeting the 5’ leader sequence as a viable
therapeutic approach for preventing or treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, including those caused
by variants of concern, indicating that LNA ASOs can be pursued as lead candidates for the
treatment of COVID-19.
Methods
Cell culture and viruses. Huh7 and Vero E6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
Penicillin/Streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2. Transfection in Huh7 cells
was performed with Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher). Cells were infected by SARSCoV-2 viruses 12 hrs after transfection. The 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV2 was obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infectious stocks were
produced by inoculating Vero E6 cells and collecting the cell culture media upon observation of
cytopathic effect; debris were removed by centrifugation and passage through a 0.22 µm filter.
The supernatant was then aliquoted and stored at −80°C. D614G, B.1.427 and B.1.1.7 strains were
kind gifts from Dr. Mary Kate Morris at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).
Locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs). LNA ASOs were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). For the screening, small scale synthesis (100 nmole) of all
LNA ASOs was followed by standard desalting purification. For the animal trials, large scale
synthesis (250 mg) of the 5’-ASO#26 LNA ASO was followed by HPLC purification and
endotoxin test.

Biosafety. All aspects of this study were approved by the office of Environmental Health and
Safety at UC Berkeley before initiation of this study. Work with SARS-CoV-2 was performed in
a biosafety level 3 laboratory by personnel equipped with powered air-purifying respirators.
Animals. C57BL/6J and K18-hACE2 [B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J] mice were purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory and male golden Syrian hamsters at 4–5 weeks old were obtained
from Charles River Labs (Strain Code:049). K18-hACE2 mice or hamsters were anesthetized
using isoflurane and inoculated with 1 × 104 TCID50 (for mice) or 10 TCID50 (for hamsters) of
SARS-CoV-2 intranasally. For the treatment, saline (40 µl) or 5’-ASO#26 (indicated amount of
LNA ASO in 40 µl saline) was administered once-daily intranasally. Mice and hamsters were
sacrificed at 4 days post infection (dpi). The left lung lobe was collected and lysed for fifty-percent
tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay, the inferior lobe was collected for RNA extraction
and the post-caval lobe was collected for histological analysis. All procedures involving the use of
mice and hamsters were approved by the University of California, Berkeley Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. All protocols conform to federal regulations, the National Research
Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Public Health Service Policy
on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay. Virus viability and titers were
evaluated in TCID50 assay within Vero E6 cells. Briefly, ten thousand cells were plated in each
well in 96-well plates and cultured at 37°C overnight. Medium from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells
or lysates from mouse lungs were used for ten-fold serial dilution with DMEM and added to the
96-well plates of Vero E6 cells. The plates were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) after 3 days
of culturing. The TCID50 results were calculated using the Spearman and Karber method34.
RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Infected Huh-7 cells (with or
without medium) or mouse lung tissues were lysed in DNA/RNA shield reagent (Zymo Research)
and total RNA was extracted by using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. cDNA was prepared by iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix (BioRAD) and qPCR
was performed with Fast SYBR™ Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) and the reaction was run
on the QuantStudio6 System (Applied Biosystems). mRNA levels were normalized to that of r18S.
qPCR primer sets are as follow: SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid(N): Fw 5’GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAA AT-3’ and Rv 5’-TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG-3’,
SARS-CoV-2
Spike(S): Fw 5’-GTCCTTCCCTCAGTCAGCAC-3’
and
Rv 5’ATGGCAGGAGCAGTTGTGAA-3’, Human r18S: Fw 5’- GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3’
and
Rv
5’CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3’,
Mouse
r18S:
Fw
5’GCAATTATTCCCCATGAACG -3’ and Rv 5’- GGCCTCACTAAACCATCCAA -3’.
RNA-sequencing. cDNA libraries were constructed from 500 ng of total RNA from Huh-7 or lung
tissues of mice according to the manufacturer’s protocol of Stranded mRNA-seq kit (KAPA).
Briefly, mRNA was captured and fragmentized to 100~300 bp. library construction was performed
undergoing end repair, A tailing, ligation of unique dual-indexed adapters (KAPA) and
amplification of 10 cycles to incorporate unique dual index sequences. Libraries were sequenced
on the NovaSeq 6000 (Novogene) targeting 40 million read pairs and extending 150 cycles with
paired end reads. The data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and are
accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE174382. The published RNA-seq data of
infected K18-hACE2 at 0 dpi and 4 dpi were obtained from GSE154104. STAR aligner35 was used
to map sequencing reads to transcripts in the mouse mm10 reference genome. Read counts for
individual transcripts were produced with HTSeq-count36, followed by the estimation of

expression values and detection of differentially expressed transcripts using EdgeR37.
Differentially expressed genes were defined by at least 2-fold change with FDR less than 0.01.
DMS modification of in vitro-transcribed RNA. gBlock containing the first 3,000 nucleotides
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from IDT. The gBlock
was amplified by PCR with a forward primer that contained the T7 promoter sequence (5’TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATTAAAGGTTTATACCTTCCCAGGTAAC-3’) and the
reverse primer (5’-TCGTTGAAACCAGGGACAAG-3’). The PCR product was used as the
template for T7 Megascript in vitro transcription (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Next, 1 µl of Turbo DNase I (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added
and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. The RNA was purified using RNA Clean and ConcentratorTM5 (Zymo). Between 1-2 µg RNA was denatured at 95°C for 1 min. Denatured RNA was refolded
in the presence of 2 µM of LNA ASO by incubating the mixture in 340 mM sodium cacodylate
buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 5 mM MgCl2+, such that the volume was 97.5 µl, for
20 min at 37°C. Then, 2.5% DMS (Millipore-Sigma) was added and incubated for 5 min at 37°C
whole shaking at 800 r.p.m. on a thermomixer. Subsequently, DMS was neutralized by adding 60
µl β-mercaptoethanol (Millipore-Sigma). The RNA was precipitated by incubating in 3 µl (45 µg)
glycoblue coprecipitant (Invitrogen), 18 µl 3M sodium acetate and 700 µl ethanol between 1 h and
overnight at -80°C, followed by centrifugation at max speed for 45 min in 4°C. The RNA was
washed with 700 µl ice cold 75% ethanol and centrifuged for 5 min. RNA was resuspended in 10
µl water.
DMS modification of infected Huh-7 cells with ASO treatment. Huh-7 cells were transfected
with LNA ASO (50 nM) 12 h before the infection. After infection of SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.05),
cells were cultured in 6-well plates with 2 ml of media. Then, 2.5% DMS was added to cells and
incubated for 3 min at 37°C. Subsequently, after careful removal of the media, DMS was
neutralized by adding 20 ml of chilled 10% β-mercaptoethanol in PBS. The cell pellets were
washed once with chilled PBS and collected for RNA extraction.
rRNA subtraction of total cellular RNA from DMS-treated cells. Between 3-5 µg RNA per
sample was used as the input for rRNA subtraction. First, equal amount of rRNA pooled
oligonucleotides were added and incubated in hybridization buffer (200 mM NaCl, 100 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4) in a final volume of 60 µl. The samples were denatured for 2 min at 95°C, followed
by a reduction of 0.1°C/s until the reaction reached 45°C. 3-5 µl HybridaseTM Thermostable RNase
H (Lucigen) and 7 µl 10x RNase H buffer preheated to 45°C was added. The samples were
incubated at 45°C for 30 min. The RNA was purified using RNA Clean and ConcentratorTM-5 kit
and eluted in 42 µl water. Then, 5 µl Turbo DNase buffer and 3 µl Turbo DNase (ThermoFisher
Scientific) were added to each sample and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The RNA was purified
using RNA Clean and ConcentratorTM-5 kit and eluted in 10 µl water.
RT-PCR and sequencing of DMS-modified RNA. To reverse transcribe, rRNA-depleted total
RNA or in vitro-transcribed RNA purified from the previous steps was added to 4 µl 5x FS buffer,
1 µl dNTP, 1 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 1 µl RNase Out, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer (5’TCGTTGAAACCAGGGACAAG-3’) and 1 µl TGIRT-III (Ingex). The reaction was incubated
for 1.5 h at 60°C. Then, to degrade the RNA, 1 µl of 4 M NaOH was added and incubated for 3
min at 95°C. The cDNA was purified in 10 µl water using the Oligo Clean and ConcentratorTM kit
(Zymo). Next, 1 µl of cDNA was amplified using Advantage HF 2 DNA polymerase (Takara) for
25-30
cycles
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
instructions
(Fw
