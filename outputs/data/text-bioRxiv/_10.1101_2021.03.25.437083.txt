ABSTRACT

18

Background

19

Genomic sequencing is important to track and monitor genetic changes in SARS-CoV-2. We

20

introduce a target capture next-generation sequencing methodology, the ONETest

21

Coronaviruses Plus, to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes and select genes of other respiratory

22

viruses simultaneously.

23

Methods

24

We applied the ONETest on 70 respiratory samples (collected in Florida, USA between May

25

and July, 2020), in which SARS-CoV-2 had been detected by a qualitative PCR assay. For 48

26

(69%) of the samples, we also applied the ARTIC protocol for Illumina sequencing. All the

27

libraries were sequenced as 2x150 nucleotide reads on an Illumina instrument. The ONETest

28

data were analyzed using an in-house pipeline and the ARTIC data using a published pipeline

29

to produce consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, to which lineages were assigned

30

using pangolin.

31

Results

32

Of the 70 ONETest libraries, 45 (64%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome

33

sequence (> 29,000 bases and with > 90% of its bases covered by at least 10 reads). Of the 48

34

ARTIC libraries, 25 (52%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.

35

In 24 out of 34 (71%) samples in which both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences were

36

complete or near-complete and in which lineage could be assigned to both the ONETest and

37

ARTIC sequences, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage identified was the same.

38

Conclusions

39

The ONETest can be used to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in archived samples and

40

thereby enable detection of circulating and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Target capture

41

approaches, such as the ONETest, are less prone to loss of sequence coverage probably due

42

to amplicon dropouts encountered in amplicon approaches, such as ARTIC. With its added

INTRODUCTION

49

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is widely achieved using the amplicon next-generation

50

sequencing (NGS) ARTIC methodology 1. Because of its ease of use and low cost of

51

sequencing, ARTIC has become the method of choice among many laboratories.

52

Notwithstanding its advantages, the ARTIC PCR primer set needs to be maintained and updated

53

due to amplicon dropouts 1, which may be caused by primer interactions 2 and mutations at

54

primer binding sites 3. Without continual upkeep, amplicon sequencing may yield incomplete

55

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and therefore create a loss of valuable genetic information.

56

This could weaken our vigilance towards SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which may impact our

57

diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccination efforts 4, and SARS-CoV-2 lineages, especially variants

58

of concern such as B.1.1.7 and B.1.135 that may enhance the virus’ transmissibility or lethality

59

5,6

.

60
61

Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing can be accomplished using probe-based liquid-

62

phase hybridization followed by NGS 3,7,8. A major appeal of target capture NGS methodologies

63

is its capacity to enrich samples for a practically limitless repertoire of genetic loci without

64

needing to constantly update the primers and or deal with multiplexing issues encountered with

65

amplicon-based approaches. Indeed, virome target capture NGS methodologies have been

66

developed (e.g., 9,10). Another advantage is that target capture NGS approaches perform better

67

than amplicon NGS approaches in degraded samples (e.g., archived FFPE samples 11). A

68

validated target capture NGS solution with end-to-end automation for concurrent detection and

69

sequence characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory pathogens can be a

70

powerful tool for genomic surveillance of respiratory infectious disease in the post COVID-19

71

era and can play a crucial role in timely generation and dissemination of genomic data.

73

The ONETestTM is a pre-commercial target capture NGS platform developed by Fusion

74

Genomics Corp. (Burnaby, BC, Canada). The platform offers a sequencer-agnostic end-to-end

75

NGS workflow that includes library preparation, probe-based liquid phase hybridization, and

76

cloud-based bioinformatics analysis. The ONETestTM Coronaviruses Plus

77

(http://www.fusiongenomics.com/onetestplatform/coronavirusesplus/), based on the ONETestTM

78

platform, has been demonstrated to enrich samples for select genetic loci of various respiratory

79

viruses (e.g., influenza A viruses) in a separate study (in preparation). Furthermore, the

80

ONETestTM EnviroScreen, also based on the ONETestTM platform, has been shown to detect

81

diverse subtypes of avian influenza viruses in wetland sediments 12.

82
83

To capture the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2, we have expanded the probe design of the

84

ONETest Coronaviruses Plus. Here, using the updated ONETest, we sequenced the SARS-

85

CoV-2 genomes in 70 retrospectively selected samples, which were initially tested at the

86

University of Florida (UF) Health Shands Hospital Clinical Laboratory during the COVID-19

87

pandemic in 2020. We also processed a subset of them (n = 48) using the ARTIC protocol for

88

Illumina sequencing. These data allowed us to demonstrate the ability of the ONETest to

89

determine the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples.

90
91

RESULTS

92

ONETest yields complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome more often than ARTIC

93

The ONETest libraries of the 70 samples had a total of ~186 million paired-end reads, and each

94

of the libraries had ~2.66 million paired-end reads on average (range, ~0.45 to ~6.14 million)

95

(Table S1). This per-sample amount of sequencing is comparable to that used in a study 3

96

evaluating another target capture product (7.4 million 1x100 nt filtered reads per sample). Of

97

the 70 ONETest libraries, 45 (64%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome

98

sequence that was > 29,000 nucleotides (nt) long and had > 90% well covered bases

99

(specifically, ≥ 10x depth). Even after sub-sampling, the ONETest libraries had a complete or

100

near-complete genome sequence for 43 (61%) of the samples. Additionally, we processed 48

101

(69%) of the 70 samples using ARTIC. The ARTIC libraries had a total of ~30 million paired-

102

end reads, and each of the libraries had ~0.63 million paired-end reads on average (range,

103

~0.20 to ~2.1 million) (Table S1). This amount of sequencing is comparable to that in the

104

ARTIC experiments performed by other groups (Figure S1). Of the 48 ARTIC libraries, 25

105

(52%) had a complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.

106
107

When considering the 48 samples for which both ONETest and ARTIC libraries were made, the

108

mean percent poorly covered bases in the ONETest sequences was 23% (range, 0% to 100%),

109

whereas that in the ARTIC sequences was 25% (range, 3% to 99%) (Table S1). For 34 (71%)

110

of the samples, there was sufficient sequence information in both the ONETest and ARTIC

111

libraries so that lineage could be assigned to both the ONETest and ARTIC sequences using

112

pangolin (see below). We focused on these lineage-assigned matched ONETest and ARTIC

113

library pairs to compare the genome sequences from the two methodologies.

114
115

In the matched ONETest and ARTIC library pairs, there were fewer poorly covered bases (<

116

10x depth) across the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the ONETest libraries than in the ARTIC

117

libraries (Figure 1; Figure S2). Some of this difference may be explained by the fact that the

118

ONETest libraries were sequenced deeper than the ARTIC libraries (almost four times deeper

119

on average). However, a sub-sampling analysis indicated that even at similar sequencing

120

depths, the ONETest libraries yielded better sequence coverage than the ARTIC libraries

121

(Figure S3).

123

Regions with poorer sequence coverage in the ARTIC libraries than the ONETest libraries

124

While there were several regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the ARTIC libraries that had

125

poor sequence coverage compared to the ONETest libraries, we closely examined one region

126

that had particularly poor sequence coverage in the ARTIC libraries (Figure 1). We observed

127

that depth of coverage was generally poor in the ~19,900-20,500 region of the SARS-CoV-2

128

genome in the ARTIC libraries (Figure 1). This region is targeted by the ARTIC primer pairs

129

66_LEFT/66_RIGHT (pool 2, MN908947.3: 19,844-20,255) and 67_LEFT/67_RIGHT (pool 1,

130

MN908947.3: 20,172-20,572). In contrast, the ~19,900-20,500 region was well covered overall

131

in the ONETest libraries (Figure 1). For example, depth of coverage across the SARS-CoV-2

132

genome in the ARTIC library of sample 27 was high (mean, 3,937x), except in that region

133

amplified by the two primer pairs (visualized using IGV 13 in Figure S4); on the other hand, the

134

ONETest library of sample 27 had high depth of coverage across the virus’ genome (mean,

135

10,354x with duplicate reads and 1,237x without duplicate reads), even in the region targeted by

136

those two problematic ARTIC PCR primer pairs (Figure S4).

137
138

Difference in sequence coverage between samples positive for three genes by PCR and

139

samples positive for one or two genes by PCR

140

In some ONETest and ARTIC libraries, incomplete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences might

141

have arisen from low-titer samples. Because we used a qualitative PCR assay, we did not have

142

quantitative estimates of viral titer in the samples. Instead, we considered the samples in which

143

three SARS-CoV-2 genes (N, RdRp, and E) were detected by the PCR assay to be of relatively

144

high titer (although some might be of low titer), whereas the samples in which one or two genes

145

(N only, or both N and RdRp) were detected to be of relatively low titer (although some might be

146

of high titer). We noticed that the ONETest and ARTIC libraries from the low-titer samples

147

yielded less complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences than the libraries from the high-titer

148

samples. The ONETest sequences from the low-titer samples had more poorly covered bases

(mean ± standard deviation; 75% ± 28%) than those from the high-titer samples (2% ± 6%) (p <

150

0.001, Wilcoxon’s test; including only the ONETest libraries with the matched ARTIC libraries).

151

In line with this observation, the ARTIC sequences from the low-titer samples had more poorly

152

covered bases (60% ± 34%) than those from the high-titer samples (12% ± 13%) (p < 0.001;

153

Wilcoxon’s test).

154
155

ONETest and ARTIC determined SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with concordant

156

lineage assignments

157

For 34 samples, the consensus sequences from both the ONETest and ARTIC libraries could

158

be assigned to a SARS-CoV-2 lineage using pangolin. In 24 (71%) of these samples, the

159

lineage assignment was identical for the ONETest and ARTIC libraries (e.g., in sample 50, both

160

the ONETest and ARTIC sequences were assigned to B.1.509). In the other 10 samples, the

161

lineage assignment was nevertheless in the same major lineage (e.g., in sample 46, both the

162

ONETest and ARTIC sequences were assigned to the B.1 lineage rather than the A.1 lineage).

163

These differences in lineage assignment likely stemmed from differences in sequence coverage

164

between the ONETest and ARTIC libraries. In the 10 samples, the mean difference in percent

165

poorly covered bases between the ARTIC and ONETest sequences was 5.3%.

166
167

SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected in the ONETest libraries

168

Of the 70 samples sequenced in this study using the ONETest, 45 had a complete or near-

169

complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. We found 15 distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineage

170

assignments to the ONETest sequences of the samples (Figure 2).

175

concerns. Having multiple technologies in our SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing toolbox

176

should help to heighten our vigilance towards new SARS-CoV-2 variants that may escape our

177

vaccines. Here, we propose the ONETest target capture NGS methodology to sequence

178

SARS-CoV-2 genomes to aid in efforts to track SARS-CoV-2 variants.

179
180

Using the ONETest and ARTIC, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from archived samples

181

in which SARS-CoV-2 had been detected by a FDA EUA qualitative PCR assay. Our data

182

demonstrate that the ONETest can yield complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences more often

183

than ARTIC (64% versus 52%). While relatively shallow sequencing of the ARTIC libraries may

184

account for some of the other poorly covered regions, a sub-sampling analysis indicates that the

185

ONETest produces complete genome sequences more often than ARTIC even at about one

186

fourth the amount of sequencing on average. Nonetheless, there are consistently poorly

187

covered regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome across the ARTIC libraries. In particular, the

188

~19,900-20,500 SARS-CoV-2 genome region targeted by two ARTIC PCR primer pairs (e.g.,

189

sample 27) is poorly covered in many ARTIC libraries, even though other genomic regions in

190

the same libraries are well covered. As shown by an analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

191

sequences deposited in GISAID 14, many publicly available sequences contain problematic

192

regions (i.e., contiguous stretches of 200 Ns) around the 20,000th nucleotide position. Many of

193

the genome sequences were produced using an amplicon NGS methodology, in particular

194

ARTIC. Furthermore, by comparing the lineage assignments of the ONETest and ARTIC

195

sequences, which are generally concordant, we show that the ONETest can provide quality

196

genome sequences to study the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

197
198

In this study, we did not have quantitative estimates of viral load (e.g., cycle threshold values

199

from a quantitative PCR assay) for the samples examined here to directly observe the effect of

200

viral load on the quality of the consensus sequences. By using the number of target genes

201

detected by a PCR assay (three genes versus one or two genes) as a proxy instead, we find

202

that the ONETest and ARTIC consensus sequences are of higher quality in the samples

203

positive for three genes, suggesting that the partial genome sequences in about 40% of the

204

ONETest libraries and about 50% of the ARTIC libraries resulted from low viral titer.

205
206

Target capture NGS methodologies, such as the ONETest, should be able to detect mutations

207

that can impact the performance of amplicon NGS methodologies, such as ARTIC. Kim et al. 3

208

showed a case in which target capture NGS detected a large 382 nt deletion in the ORF8 gene

209

of SARS-CoV-2 that ablated sequence coverage in four contiguous genes (ORF3a, E, M, and

210

ORF6) in the ARTIC library due to PCR amplification failure. Although we did not encounter

211

such a dramatic case in this study, we anticipate that as we sequence more samples using the

212

ONETest, the ONETest will detect large deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that could

213

severely reduce sequence coverage when using amplicon NGS methodologies. This

214

advantage of target capture NGS approaches is important as new SARS-CoV-2 genetic

215

mutations of unpredictable nature continue to emerge.

216
217

Our data show the ability of the ONETest to determine the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2

218

in respiratory samples. Importantly, our data indicate that the ONETest is less prone to loss of

219

sequence coverage that may be caused by poor or failed target binding (e.g., the amplicon

220

dropouts in the ARTIC libraries shown here and in studies by other groups), which can

221

ultimately result in inaccurate SARS-CoV-2 genotyping and lineage identification. The added

222

value of the ONETest to characterize multiple respiratory pathogens, although not assessed in

223

this study, would help us to better understand the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in the

224

post COVID-19 era. Furthermore, Fusion Genomics Corp., at the time of this writing, is

225

validating a fully automated ONETest workflow that allows for flexible sample batching (i.e., as

226

few as eight libraries to as many as 384 libraries per sequencing run).

Respiratory samples

234

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs (n = 61) and endotracheal aspirates (n = 9) were collected from

235

patients, who had respiratory illness and were suspected to have COVID-19, at UF Health

236

Shands Hospital in May (n = 31) and in July (n = 39), 2020. Among the patients, 30 (43%) were

237

male and 40 (57%) were female. The mean age of the patients (± standard deviation) was 46.1

238

(± 19.8) years (range, 5 to 102 years; interquartile range, 27.8 to 54.0 years). Three patients

239

had two separate samples collected seven to 12 days apart; one patient had four samples, two

240

samples collected in May (one NP swab and one endotracheal aspirate on the same day) and

241

two samples collected in July that were duplicate samples. The samples were initially tested for

242

SARS-CoV-2 using a FDA Emergency Use Authorization qualitative PCR assay (GeneFinder™

243

COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit from OSANG Healthcare Co. Ltd., South Korea), which targets the

244

RdRp, N, and E genes. We retrospectively selected 70 samples in which SARS-CoV-2 had

was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by the ELlTe InGenius® platform (ELITechGroup, Puteaux, France)

250

using the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

257

We processed 2 μL of RNA extract from each sample using the ARTIC Illumina protocol

258

(https://www.protocols.io/view/covid-19-artic-v3-illumina-library-construction-an-bibtkann). This

259

protocol utilizes two pools of ARTIC V3 primer pairs to amplify 98 ~400 nt partially overlapping

260

regions that tile the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-

261

ncov2019/blob/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V3/), which were ordered from Sigma-

262

Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Libraries were constructed using TruSeq Nano from Illumina Inc.

263

(San Diego, CA, USA), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were normalized, pooled

264

together, and sequenced as 2x150 nt reads on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (San Diego,

265

CA, USA). Reads from these libraries were analyzed using a bioinformatics pipeline (v1.3.0;

266

https://github.com/connor-lab/ncov2019-artic-nf) that automates the ARTIC data analysis

267

protocol for Illumina reads (https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html),

ONETest: probe design

271

We have expanded the ONETest probe set (QuantumProbesTM;

272

http://www.fusiongenomics.com/onetestplatform/), which originally targets non-SARS-CoV-2

273

respiratory pathogens, to capture the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome based on the Wuhan-Hu-1

274

reference sequence (NC_045512.2). Additionally, we designed probes to capture the

275

nucleotide variants frequently observed in SARS-CoV-2 genomes (> 1%; retrieved from NCBI

276

GenBank in July, 2020) and to cover the GC-poor regions (< 35% GC) of the virus’ genome.

279

Next, we processed 11 μL of RNA extract from each sample using the ONETest protocol. RNA

280

extracts were then treated with deoxyribonuclease from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada).

281

Target-enriched Illumina-compatible libraries were prepared from RNA using the ONETest kit

282

from Fusion Genomics Corp. (Burnaby, BC, Canada). Total RNA was subject to rRNA and

283

mRNA removal using biotin-labeled depletion probes captured via magnetic streptavidin-coated

284

beads. Cleaned RNA was then reverse transcribed using random primers with adapters, and

285

the resulting cDNA was fragmented. Whole transcriptome amplification was then performed,

286

and cDNA was ligated with Illumina-compatible indexed adapters, according to the

287

manufacturer’s instructions. The indexed libraries were mixed with Illumina adapter-specific

288

blocking reagents, human Cot-1 placental DNA from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada), and

289

target-specific biotin-labeled probes in hybridization solution. Hybridization occurred overnight

290

at 50°C. The target-probe duplexes were then captured by using magnetic beads and by

291

iteratively washing off unhybridized nucleic acids with increasingly stringent buffers. Enriched

292

libraries were universally re-amplified for 20 cycles using Illumina adapter-specific primers.

293

Normalization and pooling of the enriched libraries were based on quantification using the

294

Quant-iT dsDNA kit (Life Technologies, ON, Canada). Molar quantification of the pooled library

295

was performed using GeneRead Library Quant Kit for Illumina (Qiagen Canada, ON). The

296

pooled library was sequenced as 2x150 nt reads on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument, as per

297

the manufacturer's instructions.

298
299

ONETest: NGS data analysis

300

Reads from the ONETest libraries were analyzed using an in-house bioinformatics pipeline.

301

The pipeline preprocesses raw NGS reads using a custom C/C++ program (removing adapter

302

sequences, trimming off poor-quality bases of < Q30, and filtering out reads of < 50 nt and

303

reads with low complexity of normalized trimer entropy of < 60, poor mean base quality of <

304

Q27, or percent G of > 40%). Reads were discarded that mapped to the human genome

305

sequence (GRCh38.p13, release 35) using bowtie2 v2.4.2 18. Then, it aligned the remaining

306

reads to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence (MN996528.1) using bowtie2 (with

307

the settings ‘--very-sensitive-local --score-min G,100,9’), marking duplicate reads using

308

samtools v1.11 16. Finally, the pipeline performed iterative comparative assembly (up to five

309

attempts) to reconstruct consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences using bcftools v1.11.

310

Nucleotides were called at positions that were covered by ≥ 10 reads (excluding duplicate

311

reads); otherwise, they were masked as Ns. Discounting poor-quality bases of < Q15 and

312

excluding duplicate reads, nucleotide variants were filtered out unless (1) their quality score was

313

≥ Q15, (2) they were supported by > 1 forward aligned read and > 1 reverse aligned read, (3)

314

they were supported by > 25% of the reads, and (4) the number of variant-supporting reads is ≥

315

the number of reference-supporting reads; a maximum depth of 30,000 was allowed during

316

pileup. Indels were normalized after calling. The pipeline was implemented in C/C++ and

317

Python using a combination of in-house software and third-party tools, including Biopython

318

v1.78 19, bedtools v2.29.2 20, pybedtools v0.8.1 21, samtools/bcftools/htslib v1.11 16, and

ONETest: sub-sampling analysis

322

We sequenced the ONETest libraries at 2.66 million 2x150 nt reads on average, nearly four

323

times as deep as that of the ARTIC libraries (0.63 million 2x150 nt reads on average). To

324

assess whether the observed differences in genome coverage between the ONETest and

325

ARTIC libraries might have resulted from deeper sequencing of the ONETest libraries, we

326

conducted a sub-sampling analysis in which we compared down-sampled ONETest libraries

327

with the full ARTIC libraries. Using seqtk v1.3 (https://github/com/lh3/seqtk), we randomly

328

down-sampled (without replacement) the 2x150 nt reads of each ONETest library so that the

329

resulting library had the same number of reads as the matched ARTIC library; each ONETest

330

library was sub-sampled three times in this manner to generate three simulated replicates of the

331

library. Then, we analyzed those sub-sampled reads to determine which bases were poorly

332

covered across the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the simulated ONETest libraries.

333
334

Depth of coverage analysis

335

Using bedtools, we generated depth of sequence coverage profiles for the full ONETest libraries

336

and the sub-sampled ONETest libraries based on bowtie2 read alignments and the ARTIC

337

libraries based on the bwa mem read alignments. For the ONETest libraries, we excluded

338

duplicate reads, but for the ARTIC libraries, we included duplicate reads. Visualization was

339

done in R using ggplot2 23.

340
341

Lineage analysis

342

We identified the lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples based on the ONETest and ARTIC

343

consensus sequences using pangolin v2.1.10 (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin). This

344

tool assigns SARS-CoV-2 lineages according to a dynamic nomenclature system 24.

s
samples in which its depth of coverage was ≥ 10 (excluding duplicates for the ONETest libraries

393

and including duplicates for the ARTIC libraries). This percentage was averaged across the
