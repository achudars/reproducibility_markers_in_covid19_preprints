ABSTRACT

15

Activation of the RIG-I-like receptors, RIG-I and MDA5, establishes an antiviral state by

16

upregulating interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Among these is ISG15 whose mechanistic

17

roles in innate immunity still remain enigmatic. Here we report that ISGylation is essential for

18

antiviral IFN responses mediated by the viral RNA sensor MDA5. ISG15 conjugation to the

19

caspase activation and recruitment domains of MDA5 promotes the formation of higher-order

20

assemblies of MDA5 and thereby triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses

21

including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses. The ISG15-dependent activation of

22

MDA5 is antagonized through direct de-ISGylation mediated by the papain-like protease (PLpro)

23

of SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work

24

demonstrates a crucial role for ISG15 in the MDA5-mediated antiviral response, and also identifies

25

a novel immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which may be targeted for the development

26

of new antivirals and vaccines to combat COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

28

Viral perturbation of host immune homeostasis is monitored by the innate immune system,

29

which relies on receptors that sense pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns1, 2, 3. The

30

RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I and MDA5 are pivotal for virus detection by surveying the

31

cytoplasm for viral or host-derived immunostimulatory RNAs that harbor dsRNA structures and,

32

in the case of RIG-I agonists, also a 5'-di- or tri-phosphate moiety4. Binding of RNA to the C-

33

terminal domain (CTD) and helicase of RIG-I and MDA5 leads to their transition from an inactive

34

state to a signaling-primed conformation that allows for the recruitment of several enzymes5. These

35

enzymes modify RLRs at multiple domains and sites, and posttranslational modifications (PTMs)

36

are particularly well studied for the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains

37

(CARDs), the signaling modules. PP1α/γ dephosphorylate specific CARD residues in RIG-I and

38

MDA56, which triggers further activation steps. In the case of RIG-I, dephosphorylation promotes

39

K63-linked polyubiquitination of the CARDs by TRIM25 and other E3 ligases7, 8, which nucleates

40

and stabilizes the oligomeric form of RIG-I, thereby enabling MAVS binding at mitochondria.

41

Compared to those of RIG-I, the individual steps of MDA5 activation and critical PTMs involved

42

are less well understood.

43

RLR activation induces the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs) which, in turn,

44

propagate antiviral signaling by upregulating IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)9,

45

profoundly upregulated ISGs is ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein. Similar to ubiquitin, ISG15 can

46

be covalently conjugated to lysine (K) residues of target proteins, a PTM process termed

47

ISGylation11. ISGylation is catalyzed by a chain of enzymatic reactions analogous to ubiquitination,

48

involving an E1 activating enzyme (Ube1L), an E2 conjugating enzyme (UbcH8), and a handful

49

of E3 ligases (for example, HERC5). Inversely, de-ISGylation is mediated by the cellular

50

isopeptidase USP1811, and certain viruses also encode proteases that harbor de-ISGylase

51

activities12. Besides covalent conjugation, ISG15 – like ubiquitin – can noncovalently bind to

52

substrate proteins. Whereas ISG15 conjugation has been widely recognized to act antivirally13,

53

unconjugated ISG15 serves a proviral role by promoting USP18-mediated suppression of type I

54

IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling14, 15, 16; this latter function of ISG15 is responsible for over-

55

amplified ISG induction and fortified viral resistance in humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency.

56

In contrast to ISG15’s role in dampening IFNAR signaling, the precise mechanism(s) of how

57

ISGylation enhances immune responses to a wide range of viral pathogens are less well understood.

58

Along these lines, although a broad repertoire of viral and cellular proteins has been shown to be

59

targeted for ISGylation13 (of note, this usually represents co-translational modification of the

60

nascent protein pool17), mechanisms of host protein ISGylation that could explain the broad

61

antiviral restriction activity of ISG15 are currently unknown.

62

The causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory

63

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SCoV2), belongs to the Coronaviridae family that contains several other

64

human pathogens. Coronaviruses have an exceptional capability to suppress IFN-mediated

65

antiviral responses, and low production of type I IFNs in SCoV-2-infected patients correlated with

66

more severe disease outcome18. Among the coronaviral IFN antagonists is the papain-like protease

67

(PLpro), which has deubiquitinating and de-ISGylating activities19,

68

substrates of the SCoV2 PLpro remain largely elusive.

20

; however, the cellular

69

Here we identify an essential role for ISGylation in MDA5 activation. We further show

70

that SCoV2 PLpro interacts with MDA5 and antagonizes ISG15-dependent MDA5 activation via

71

its de-ISGylase activity, unveiling that SCoV2 has already evolved to escape immune surveillance

72

by MDA5.

RESULTS

74

MDA5, but not RIG-I, signaling requires ISG15

75

To identify PTMs of the CARDs of MDA5 that may regulate MDA5 activation, we

76

subjected affinity-purified MDA5-2CARD fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST-MDA5-

77

2CARD), or GST alone, to liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-

78

MS/MS) and found that specifically GST-MDA5-2CARD co-purified with ISG15, which

79

appeared as two bands that migrated more slowly (by ~15 and 30 kDa) than unmodified GST-

80

MDA5-2CARD (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Immunoblot (IB) analysis confirmed that GST-MDA5-

81

2CARD is modified by ISG15 (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Since the CARDs are the signaling

82

module of MDA5, we next determined the functional relevance of ISG15 for MDA5-induced

83

signaling. While ectopic expression of FLAG-MDA5 in wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic

84

fibroblasts (MEFs) induced IFN-β mRNA and protein as well as Ccl5 transcripts in a dose-

85

dependent manner, FLAG-MDA5 expression in Isg15-/- MEFs led to ablated antiviral gene and

86

protein expression (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Similarly, antiviral gene expression

87

induced by FLAG-MDA5 was strongly diminished in ISG15 KO HeLa (human) cells compared

88

to WT control cells (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1d), ruling out a species-specific effect. In

89

contrast to FLAG-MDA5, ectopically expressed FLAG-RIG-I induced comparable amounts of

90

secreted IFN-β protein as well as Ifnb1 and Ccl5 transcripts in Isg15-/- and WT MEFs (Fig. 1a

91

and Extended Data Fig. 1c). IFNB1 transcripts and IFN-β protein production triggered by FLAG-

92

RIG-I were slightly enhanced in ISG15 KO HeLa cells as compared to WT control cells (Fig. 1b

93

and Extended Data Fig. 1d), consistent with previous reports that ISGylation negatively impacts

94

RIG-I signaling21, 22. These results suggest that ISG15 is required for MDA5, but not RIG-I,

95

mediated signal transduction.

96

To substantiate a differential role of ISG15 in regulating MDA5 and RIG-I signaling, we

97

tested the effect of ISG15 gene deletion on the activation of endogenous MDA5 and RIG-I by their

98

respective RNA ligands. IFN-β production as well as IFNB1, CCL5, and TNF gene expression

99

induced by transfection of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-RNA or high-molecular-weight

100

(HMW)-poly(I:C), both of which are predominantly sensed by MDA5, were profoundly attenuated

101

in Isg15-/- MEF, ISG15 KO HeLa, and ISG15 KO HAP-1 (human) cells as compared to their

102

respective control cells (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). Importantly, the ablation of

103

antiviral gene induction in response to EMCV-RNA or HMW-poly(I:C) in ISG15 KO cells was

104

not due to abrogated MDA5 gene expression; on the contrary, mRNA expression of endogenous

105

MDA5 was enhanced in ISG15 KO cells as compared to WT cells (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g). In

106

contrast to stimulation with MDA5 agonists, stimulation of Isg15-/- MEFs and ISG15 KO HeLa

107

cells by transfection of rabies virus leader RNA (RABVLe) or by infection with Sendai virus (SeV,

108

strain Cantell), both of which are specific RIG-I stimuli, led to IFN-β production and antiviral gene

109

expression comparable to WT control cells (Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1e). To rule out

110

potential clonal effects that could be associated with ISG15 gene-deleted cells, we performed

111

transient ISG15 gene silencing in primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) followed by

112

stimulation of endogenous MDA5 and RIG-I with EMCV-RNA or RABVLe, respectively. siRNA-

113

mediated silencing of ISG15, similarly to depletion of MDA5, led to a near-complete loss of

114

phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) – a hallmark of RLR signal activation – upon

115

stimulation with EMCV-RNA, but not RABVLe (Fig. 1e). In accord, knockdown of endogenous

116

ISG15 greatly diminished IFN-β production as well as IFNB1 and CCL5 gene expression in

117

primary NHLFs transfected with EMCV-RNA, but not in cells transfected with RABVLe or

118

infected with SeV (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1h).

119

We next asked whether ISG15 is required for MDA5-mediated signaling also in immune

120

cells. shRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous ISG15 or MDA5 in primary human peripheral

121

blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) substantially reduced IFN-β production and IFNA2 and IL-6

122

transcripts following infection with a recombinant mutant EMCV (mutEMCV) known to be

123

deficient in MDA5 antagonism23, 24, as compared to infected PBMCs that were transduced with

124

non-targeting control shRNA (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 1i). By contrast, ISG15 or MDA5

125

depletion did not affect the cytokine responses in PBMCs upon SeV infection. (Fig. 1g,h and

126

Extended Data Fig. 1i). Collectively, these results show that ISG15 is essential for MDA5, but

127

not RIG-I, mediated innate immune signaling.

128
129

The MDA5 CARDs are ISGylated at K23 and K43

130

To corroborate our MS analysis that identified ISG15 modification of the MDA5-2CARD,

131

we first tested whether also endogenous MDA5 is modified by ISG15. Anti-ISG15 immunoblot

132

(IB) of immunoprecipitated endogenous MDA5 from primary NHLFs that were transfected with

133

HMW-poly(I:C) or infected with the flaviviruses dengue (DENV) and Zika viruses (ZIKV) that

134

are known to be sensed by MDA5 (together with RIG-I)5, showed robust ISGylation of MDA5

135

(Fig. 2a). Notably, endogenous MDA5 was also ISGylated in uninfected cells, although at low

136

levels (Extended Data Fig. 2a), which is consistent with a previous report that showed that many

137

host proteins are ISGylated at low levels also in normal (uninfected) conditions17. Moreover, in

138

NHLFs that were treated with an anti-IFNAR2 antibody to block IFNAR-signaling-mediated ISG

139

upregulation (e.g. IFIT1 and RSAD2), silencing of ISG15 or MDA5 led to a comparable reduction

140

of IFNB1 gene expression in response to mutEMCV infection (Extended Data Fig. 2b). These

141

results indicate that ISG15-dependent MDA5 signaling occurs even in the absence of IFNAR

142

signaling, suggesting that basal ISGylation is sufficient for MDA5 activation.

143

Biochemical analysis confirmed that the MDA5-2CARD, but not MDA5 Δ2CARD

144

(containing helicase and CTD), is the primary site of MDA5 ISG15 modification (Fig. 2b). Of

145

note, immunoblotting showed two major bands of ISGylation for MDA5-2CARD (Fig. 2b), which

146

is consistent with our MS analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Reconstitution of ISG15 KO HeLa

147

cells with either WT ISG15, or an unconjugatable mutant of ISG15 in which the two C-terminal

148

glycines needed for conjugation were replaced with alanine (ISG15 AA), demonstrated covalent

149

ISG15 conjugation of MDA5 (Fig. 2c).

150

Mutation of individual K residues in GST-MDA5-2CARD to arginine (R) revealed that

151

single-site mutation of K23 and K43 noticeably reduced ISGylation (Extended Data Fig. 2c),

152

while combined mutation of these two residues (K23R/K43R) led to a near-complete loss of

153

ISGylation (Fig. 2d). Introduction of the K23R/K43R mutations into full-length FLAG-MDA5

154

also markedly diminished ISGylation (Fig. 2e), and the FLAG-MDA5 K23R/K43R mutant

155

persisted in a hypo-ISGylated state over a 72-h time course of EMCV-RNA stimulation (Extended

156

Data Fig. 2d). Of note, the residual ISGylation seen in MDA5 K23R/K43R is likely due to

157

additional, minor sites in the CARD and/or D2CARD. To strengthen the concept that K23 and K43

158

are primarily modified by ISGylation and not other PTMs, we assessed the effect of the

159

K23R/K43R mutation on MDA5 SUMOylation and ubiquitination5. The K23R/K43R mutation,

160

which leads to a near-complete loss of MDA5 ISGylation, had no effect on MDA5 CARD

161

SUMOylation; GST-MDA5-2CARD WT and the K23R/K43R mutant showed comparable

162

SUMOylation levels (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Furthermore, whereas GST-RIG-I-2CARD was

163

robustly ubiquitinated (which primarily represents covalent K63-linked ubiquitination7), neither

8

164

GST-MDA5-2CARD WT nor the K23R/K43R mutant showed detectable levels of ubiquitination

165

under the same conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2f), which is in agreement with previous findings7.

166

Taken together, these results indicate that the MDA5 CARDs undergo ISGylation at two major

167

sites, K23 and K43.

168
169

CARD ISGylation is required for MDA5 activation

170

To determine the relevance of CARD ISGylation in MDA5-mediated signaling, we first

171

compared the ability of MDA5-2CARD WT and of the mutants K23R, K43R and K23R/K43R to

172

activate the IFN-β promoter by luciferase reporter assay. Consistent with their reduced ISGylation

173

levels (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2c), MDA5-2CARD K23R and K43R single-site mutants

174

showed partially reduced IFN-β promoter activation as compared to WT MDA5-2CARD, while

175

the MDA5-2CARD K23R/K43R double mutant had a profoundly reduced signaling activity

176

(Extended Data Fig. 2g). The decrease in signaling ability of the MDA5-2CARD K23R/K43R

177

mutant was almost as strong as that of the phosphomimetic mutants S88E and S88D, which are

178

inactive due to constitutive CARD ‘phosphorylation’ and thus served as positive controls6. In

179

contrast, an MDA5-2CARD mutant in which K68, which is the lysine residue that is most proximal

180

to K43 and K23, was substituted with arginine (K68R), showed comparable ISG15 conjugation

181

and signaling competency to the WT 2CARD (Extended Data Fig. 2c,g). Consistent with the data

182

obtained from the IFN-β luciferase assay, the MDA5-2CARD K23R/K43R mutant, in contrast to

183

WT MDA5-2CARD, also failed to induce the dimerization of endogenous IRF3 (Extended Data

184

Fig. 2h). Full-length FLAG-MDA5 K23R, K43R, or K23R/K43R double mutant, also showed

185

reduced and near-abolished IFN-β promoter activating abilities, respectively, as compared to WT

186

FLAG-MDA5 (Fig. 2f), strengthening that K23 and K43 are the ISGylation sites that are critical

187

for MDA5 activation. Of note, the FLAG-MDA5 K23/K43R mutant showed a profound signaling

188

defect even when expressed at high amounts. In contrast, WT FLAG-MDA5 induced IFNB1 and

189

CCL5 transcript expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2g). Consistent with these data,

190

phosphorylation of STAT1, which is a hallmark of IFNAR-signal activation, as well as protein

191

expression of IFIT1 and IFIT2 (both are ISGs) were highly induced in cells expressing WT MDA5,

192

but not in cells expressing the K23R/K43R mutant (Fig. 2h). To rule out the possibility of a

193

confounding effect by endogenous MDA5 on signaling induced by our ectopically-expressed

194

MDA5 mutants, we tested their signal-transducing activities in human astrocytes in which the

195

MDA5 gene expression was ablated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology (MDA5 KO SVGAs) (Fig. 2i

196

and Extended Data Fig. 2i). Complementation of MDA5 KO SVGA cells with the K23R/K43R

197

mutant led to greatly diminished IFNB1, CCL5, and ISG (OAS1 and RSAD2) transcript induction

198

compared to cells expressing WT MDA5. Control cells reconstituted with the signaling-defective

199

MDA5 S88E mutant also showed strongly reduced antiviral gene induction (Fig. 2i). These results

200

demonstrate that ISGylation at K23 and K43 in the CARDs is essential for MDA5-mediated

201

antiviral cytokine responses.

202
203

Dephosphorylation by PP1 regulates MDA5 ISGylation

204

Like RIG-I, MDA5 is phosphorylated within the CARDs in uninfected cells, which

205

prevents auto-activation; in contrast, dephosphorylation of RIG-I (at S8 and T170) and MDA5 (at

206

S88) by PP1α/γ is crucial for unleashing RLRs from their signaling-repressed states6, 25, 26, 27. In

207

the case of RIG-I, dephosphorylation allows K63-linked ubiquitination of the CARDs, which then

208

promotes RIG-I multimerization and antiviral signaling5. The details of how CARD

209

dephosphorylation triggers MDA5 activation have remained elusive, and therefore we tested

210

whether dephosphorylation regulates MDA5 ISGylation. We found that silencing of endogenous

211

PP1α or PP1γ strongly diminished MDA5-2CARD ISGylation (Extended Data Fig. 3a).

212

Furthermore, the phosphomimetic MDA5-2CARD mutants S88E and S88D had markedly reduced

213

ISGylation, whereas the ‘phospho-null’ S88A mutant showed stronger ISGylation than WT

214

MDA5-2CARD (Extended data Fig. 3b). Conversely, the ISGylation-null mutant of MDA5,

215

K23R/K43R, had comparable S88 phosphorylation levels (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Together,

216

these data suggested that MDA5 dephosphorylation at S88 precedes CARD ISGylation.

217

We next made use of the V protein of measles virus (MeV-V) of the Paramyxoviridae

218

family, which is known to antagonize MDA5 S88 dephosphorylation through direct antagonism

219

of PP1α/γ28. Ectopic expression of MeV-V enhanced the S88 phosphorylation (indicative of

220

inhibition of S88 dephosphorylation) of GST-MDA5-2CARD or FLAG-MDA5 in a dose-

221

dependent manner, as previously shown28. The enhancement of S88 phosphorylation by MeV-V

222

correlated with a gradual decline in ISGylation (Extended data Fig. 3d,e). In contrast to WT

223

MeV-V, a C-terminally truncated mutant of MeV-V (MeV-V Δtail) which has abolished PP1-

224

binding and MDA5-dephosphorylation antagonism28, exhibited little effect on MDA5-2CARD

225

ISGylation (Extended data Fig. 3f), strengthening that the inhibition of MDA5-2CARD

226

ISGylation is primarily due to PP1 inhibition, and not other antagonistic effects, by the MeV-V

227

protein. The V proteins from Nipah and Hendra viruses (NiV-V and HeV-V) also strongly

228

enhanced MDA5 S88 phosphorylation (Extended data Fig. 3g,h), and correspondingly,

229

dampened MDA5 ISGylation (Extended data Fig. 3h), suggesting that certain paramyxoviral V

230

proteins inhibit MDA5 ISGylation through manipulation of S88 phosphorylation, although the

231

precise mechanisms for individual V proteins remain to be determined. Taken together, these data

232

suggest that the ISGylation of MDA5-2CARD is dependent on dephosphorylation at S88.

ISGylation promotes higher-order MDA5 assemblies

235

The activation of RLRs is a multi-step process that includes RNA binding, RLR

236

oligomerization, and their translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria and mitochondria-

237

associated membranes for an interaction with MAVS5. To elucidate the mechanism by which

238

ISGylation impacts MDA5 activity, we first examined whether ISGylation affects the ability of

239

MDA5 to bind dsRNA. Endogenous MDA5 purified from WT or Isg15-/- MEFs interacted equally

240

well with HMW-poly(I:C) in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Moreover, MDA5 WT and the

241

K23R/K43R mutant showed comparable binding to HMW-poly(I:C), indicating that ISGylation

242

does not affect the RNA-binding ability of MDA5 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Next, we monitored

243

the translocation of endogenous MDA5 from the cytosol to mitochondria in cells that were either

244

depleted of ISG15 using siRNA, or transfected with nontargeting control siRNA (si.C). EMCV-

245

RNA-induced cytosol-to-mitochondria translocation of MDA5 was abolished in ISG15-silenced

246

cells, whereas si.C-transfected cells showed efficient translocation (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the

247

translocation of endogenous RIG-I from the cytosol to mitochondria induced by RABVLe

248

transfection was efficient in both ISG15-depleted and si.C-transfected cells (Fig. 3b). These data

249

indicated that ISGylation influences MDA5 activation at the level of translocation, or a step

250

upstream of it. Since the cytosol-to-mitochondria translocation of MDA5 has been shown to

251

require an interaction with the chaperon protein 14-3-3η29, we assessed 14-3-3η-binding of WT

252

MDA5 and its mutants. Pulldown assay showed that the ability of the MDA5 K23R/K43R mutant

253

to bind 14-3-3η was similar to that of WT MDA5 or the K68R mutant (Extended Data Fig. 4c).

254

However, whereas EMCV-RNA stimulation effectively induced the oligomerization of

255

endogenous MDA5 in WT MEFs, the formation of MDA5 oligomers was ablated in MEFs that

256

were deficient in ISG15 (Fig. 3c). Consistent with these data, silencing of ISG15 in human (293T)

257

cells abolished the oligomerization of FLAG-MDA5-2CARD (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, co-

258

expression of the ISGylation machinery components, Ube1L and UbcH8, strongly enhanced

259

MDA5-2CARD oligomerization in si.C-transfected cells, but not in ISG15-depleted cells (Fig. 3d),

260

indicating that ISGylation is required for MDA5 oligomer formation. In support of this concept,

261

full-length FLAG-MDA5 K23R/K43R mutant showed near-abolished oligomerization, while WT

262

MDA5 oligomerized efficiently (Fig. 3e). We also compared the effect of the K23R/K43R

263

mutation with that of a panel of previously characterized oligomerization-disruptive mutations on

264

the ability of MDA5 to oligomerize and signal downstream (Fig. 3f,g). These mutations localize

265

either to the interface between MDA5 monomers (I841R/E842R and D848A/F849A) and impede

266

RNA-binding-mediated MDA5 filamentation30, 31, or they localize to the CARDs (G74A/W75A)

267

and disrupt 2CARD oligomerization30. In contrast to WT MDA5, the K23R/K43R mutant,

268

similarly to the G74A/W75A mutant, showed deficient oligomerization and, consistent with this,

269

abolished IFN-β promoter-activating ability (Fig. 3f,g). Introduction of K23R/K43R into the

270

I841R/E842R or D848A/F849A background, either of which by itself decreased MDA5

271

oligomerization and signaling, also abolished the formation of MDA5 oligomers and IFN-β

272

promoter activation (Fig. 3f,g), suggesting a dominant role for CARD ISGylation in the formation

273

of higher-order MDA5 assemblies. Since LGP2, the third member of the RLR family, has been

274

shown to facilitate MDA5 nucleation on dsRNA and thereby MDA5 oligomerization32, 33, we

275

tested the binding of LGP2 to MDA5 WT or K23R/K43R by Co-IP. MDA5 K23R/K43R mutant

276

interacted with LGP2 as efficiently as WT MDA5 (Extended Data Fig. 4d), strengthening that

277

MDA5 CARD ISGylation promotes MDA5 oligomerization independently of RNA-binding-

278

mediated filamentation. Collectively, these results establish that ISGylation of the MDA5 CARDs

potentiates MDA5 signaling by facilitating CARD oligomerization and formation of higher-order

280

MDA5 assemblies.

281
282

ISGylation-dependent MDA5 signaling restricts virus replication

283

We next assessed whether ISGylation of MDA5 is required for its ability to restrict virus

284

replication. Ectopic expression of FLAG-MDA5 WT, but not of the K23R/K43R mutant, potently

285

(by ~2-log) inhibited the replication of EMCV, which is sensed by MDA5 (Fig. 4a). Similarly,

286

MDA5 KO HEK293 cells reconstituted with WT MDA5, but not cells complemented with the

287

K23R/K43R mutant, effectively restricted DENV replication (Fig. 4b). We also reconstituted

288

MDA5 KO astrocyte SVGAs, a physiologically relevant cell type for ZIKV infection, with either

289

vector, or MDA5 WT or K23R/K43R and then assessed ZIKV replication over a 40-hour time

290

course. ZIKV replication was attenuated by ~100-fold in cells reconstituted with WT MDA5 as

291

compared to vector-transfected cells. In contrast, cells complemented with MDA5 K23R/K43R

292

did not restrict ZIKV growth, similarly to the signaling-defective S88E mutant, which served as

293

an additional control (Fig. 4c). Similarly, ectopic expression of WT MDA5 restricted the

294

replication of SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2), a recently emergent coronavirus that is responsible for the

295

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, MDA5 K23R/K43R did not inhibit SCoV2 replication

296

(Fig. 4d).

297

To further substantiate that MDA5-mediated virus restriction is dependent on MDA5

298

ISGylation, we determined the effect of ISG15 silencing on the ability of FLAG-MDA5 WT or

299

K23R/K43R to inhibit EMCV replication. While the K23R/K43R mutant failed to suppress EMCV

300

replication regardless of ISG15 silencing, WT MDA5 effectively restricted EMCV replication in

301

si.C-transfected cells, and unexpectedly, also in ISG15 knockdown cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

302

In an exploration of the underlying mechanism of these unexpected results, we found that the

303

EMCV-infected cells that expressed WT MDA5 had markedly enhanced levels of ISG protein

304

expression (i.e. IFIT1, IFIT2, RSAD2, and ISG20) when ISG15 was silenced as compared to

305

infected cells transfected with the control siRNA (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Similarly, elevated

306

ISG transcript and protein expression was observed in ISG15-deficient cells that were transfected

307

with EMCV-RNA or infected with mutEMCV, despite the abrogation of IFN-b induction

308

(Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). In contrast, silencing of endogenous MDA5 abrogated both IFN-b

309

production and ISG protein expression, as expected (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We noticed that the

310

protein abundance of USP18, a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates IFNAR signal

311

transduction14, was greatly diminished in ISG15-depleted cells upon EMCV infection as compared

312

to infected cells that were transfected with the nontargeting control siRNA or MDA5-specific

313

siRNA (Extended Data Fig. 5b,d), which is consistent with the reported role of ISG15 in

314

preventing the degradation of USP1815. Together, these data suggested that in experimental

315

settings of ISG15-gene targeting (i.e. ISG15 gene silencing or KO) the antiviral effect of MDA5

316

ISGylation is masked by aberrant ISG upregulation due to the ablation of ISG15’s inhibitory effect

317

on IFNAR-signal transduction.

318

To test the effect of ISG15 silencing on IFN-mediated virus restriction, we employed a

319

virus protection assay that experimentally decouples MDA5 signaling in virus-infected cells from

320

downstream IFNAR signaling in the same cells (Fig. 4e). Culture supernatants from mutEMCV-

321

infected NHLF ‘donor’ cells that were either transfected with nontargeting control siRNA, or

322

depleted of either ISG15 or MDA5 (positive control), were UV-inactivated and then transferred

323

onto uninfected Vero ‘recipient’ cells. ‘Primed’ recipient cells were then infected with ZIKV to

324

directly monitor the antiviral effect of MDA5-mediated IFN production by donor cells. Whereas

15

325

the supernatants from control siRNA-transfected donor cells potently inhibited ZIKV replication,

326

the supernatants from ISG15 or MDA5 knockdown cells minimally restricted virus replication (Fig.

327

4f). Consistent with these data, the culture supernatant from EMCV-infected HEK293 ‘donor’

328

cells that were transfected with WT MDA5 together with control siRNA led to greater protection

329

of Vero ‘recipient’ cells from viral challenge than that from cells expressing WT MDA5 and

330

depleted of ISG15 (Fig. 4g). Collectively, these data demonstrate that ISGylation is important for

331

MDA5-mediated restriction of a range of RNA viruses.

332
333

SARS-CoV-2 PLpro targets MDA5 for de-ISGylation

334

Members of the Coronaviridae family, including SARS-CoV (SCoV), MERS-CoV, and

335

the recently emerged SCoV2, encode a papain-like protease (PLpro) that, together with the main

336

protease, mediates the cleavage of viral polyproteins34. In addition, PLpro has both

337

deubiquitinating and de-ISGylating activities, which have been proposed to have

338

immunomodulatory effects. A recent study showed that PLpro from SCoV2 modulates antiviral

339

responses primarily via its de-ISGylase activity20; however, bona fide substrate(s) that are de-

340

ISGylated by SCoV2 PLpro remain largely unknown. Since MDA5 is known to be a major sensor

341

for detecting coronavirus infection35, 36, and because our data showed that ISGylation is essential

342

for MDA5-mediated restriction of SCoV2 infection (Fig. 4d), we examined whether SCoV2 PLpro

343

enzymatically removes the MDA5 CARD ISGylation to antagonize innate immunity. WT PLpro

344

from SCoV2, but not its catalytically-inactive mutant C111A (PLpro-C111A)20, abolished MDA5-

345

2CARD ISGylation (Fig. 5a,b). The PLpro N156E and R166S/E167R mutants, which are

346

marginally and severely impaired in ISG15 binding at the ‘site 1’ interface19, 37, respectively, did

347

slightly, or not, affect MDA5-2CARD ISGylation (Fig. 5a,b). In contrast, a SCoV2 PLpro mutant

16

348

harboring the F69A mutation, which disrupts the ‘site 2’ interface that preferentially determines

349

binding to ubiquitin, but not ISG1519, 37, diminished MDA5-2CARD ISGylation as potently as WT

350

PLpro (Fig. 5a,b). SCoV2 PLpro, however, did not suppress RIG-I-2CARD ubiquitination; GST-

351

RIG-I-2CARD was efficiently ubiquitinated in cells co-expressing WT PLpro or its catalytically-

352

inactive mutant (C111A) (Extended Data Fig. 6a), which is in agreement with previous findings

353

that indicated that SCoV2 PLpro has high specificity for cleaving K48-linked polyubiquitin, but

354

not K63-ubiquitin linkages19.

355

In support of a direct activity of SCoV2 PLpro towards MDA5, we found that PLpro

356

interacted specifically with MDA5, but not RIG-I, as did MeV-V that is known to bind MDA5 and

357

therefore served as control38 (Fig. 5c). We found that low amounts of PLpro inhibited the signaling

358

mediated by MDA5, but not by RIG-I, whereas higher amounts of PLpro suppressed antiviral

359

signaling by both RLRs (Extended Data Fig. 6b). These results show that the MDA5 pathway is

360

preferentially antagonized by PLpro, and also strengthen that MDA5 is a direct target of PLpro-

361

mediated de-ISGylation. De-ISGylation of IRF3 likely accounts for the inhibitory effect that

362

higher doses of PLpro have on the signaling by both sensors39.

363

To determine the consequence of MDA5 de-ISGylation by PLpro, we examined the effect

364

of SCoV2 PLpro on MDA5-2CARD oligomerization. Ectopic expression of WT PLpro, similarly

365

to ISG15 depletion (Fig. 3d), efficiently blocked MDA5-2CARD oligomerization; in contrast,

366

MDA5-2CARD efficiently oligomerized in cells co-transfected with empty vector or the SCoV2

367

PLpro C111A mutant (Fig. 5d), indicating that SCoV2 PLpro inhibits the ISGylation-dependent

368

MDA5 oligomer formation via its enzymatic activity.

369

The PLpro enzymes of the related beta-coronaviruses, SCoV, MERS-CoV, and murine

370

hepatitis virus (MHV), as well as of HCoV-NL63 (NL63) of the Alphacoronavirus genus, also

371

efficiently reduced MDA5-2CARD ISGylation (Fig. 5e), suggesting that MDA5 antagonism by

372

the de-ISGylase activity of PLpro may be widely conserved among the Coronaviridae family. In

373

support of this, pull-down assay showed that the PLpro of SCoV, MERS-CoV, NL63 and MHV

374

also bound to the MDA5-2CARD (Fig. 5e), indicating that MDA5 is a substrate of coronaviral

375

PLpro de-ISGylating enzymes.

376
377

SARS-CoV-2 PLpro antagonizes ISGylation-dependent MDA5 signaling

378

We next determined the relevance of ISG15-dependent MDA5 signaling for antiviral

379

cytokine induction elicited by SCoV2. Since SCoV2 infection is known to minimally induce type

380

I IFNs due to effective viral antagonisms40, we isolated total RNA from SCoV2-infected cells and

381

then re-transfected it into cells to stimulate innate immune signaling. Transfection of total RNA

382

from mock-infected cells served as a control. SCoV2-RNA, but not RNA from mock-infected cells,

383

robustly triggered IFNB1 and IFNL1 transcript induction in NHLFs transfected with control

384

siRNA. In contrast, siRNA-mediated silencing of ISG15 or MDA5 markedly diminished antiviral

385

gene expression triggered by SCoV2-RNA (Fig. 6a). Notably, knockdown of endogenous RIG-I

386

did not adversely affect the antiviral gene expression elicited by SCoV2-RNA, indicating that

387

SCoV2 RNA-PAMP(s) are primarily sensed by the ISG15-MDA5-mediated signaling pathway

388

(Fig. 6a). Next, in support of our finding of a SCoV2 PLpro-MDA5 2CARD interaction, we found

389

that the SCoV2 non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3), within which PLpro lies, readily interacted with

390

endogenous MDA5 during authentic SCoV2 infection (Fig. 6b). Endogenous MDA5 ISGylation

391

and downstream ISG induction in SCoV2-infected cells were low (levels were similar to that in

392

uninfected cells) as compared to those during DENV infection (Fig. 6c), supporting that PLpro

393

effectively suppresses MDA5 ISGylation and innate signaling during live SCoV2 infection.

394

To provide evidence that SCoV2 PLpro antagonizes MDA5 signaling via its de-ISGylase

395

activity, we examined the effect of WT and mutant PLpro on the activation of endogenous MDA5

396

during mutEMCV infection. Consistent with their effect on MDA5-2CARD ISGylation (Fig. 5b),

397

ectopic expression of SCoV2 PLpro WT or the F69A mutant inhibited IFNB1, CCL5 and IFIT1

398

gene expression, whereas the de-ISGylase-deficient R166S/E167R mutant, similarly to the

399

catalytically-inactive C111A mutant, did not affect the antiviral gene expression (Fig. 6d). In

400

accord, the replication of mutEMCV was enhanced in cells expressing WT or F69A PLpro, but

401

not in cells expressing C111A or R166S/E167R PLpro (Fig. 6d). Likewise, WT PLpro, but not

402

the R166S/E167R or C111A mutant, blocked EMCV restriction by FLAG-MDA5 expression (Fig.

403

6e). The effect of the respective PLpro proteins on virus restriction correlated with the induction

404

of ISG protein expression (i.e. IFIT1, RSAD2, and IFITM3) (Fig. 6f). Collectively, these results

405

establish SCoV2 PLpro as an effective IFN antagonist that suppresses MDA5-mediated antiviral

406

immunity via its de-ISGylase activity.

DISCUSSION

408

ISG15, and in particular ISG15 conjugation, has long been known to confer antiviral

409

activity to a multitude of viruses; however, only very few bona fide substrates (both viral and host-

410

derived) have been identified13. On the other hand, ISG15 in its unconjugated form was shown to

411

act provirally by negatively regulating USP18-mediated inhibition of IFNAR signal transduction14,

412

15, 16

413

shows that ISGylation of the viral RNA sensor MDA5 is crucial for its ability to elicit cytokine

414

induction, demonstrating a key role of ISG15 in the IFN-mediated antiviral response. Whereas our

415

study provided mechanistic insight into how ISGylation promotes antiviral innate immune

416

responses, it is very likely that the sum of multiple ISGylation events (affecting both host and viral

417

proteins) will ultimately determine the outcome of infection and pathogenesis, which may be

418

context-dependent. Indeed, the effect of global ISG15 deficiency (e.g. using ISG15 KO cells or

419

mice) on virus replication has been extensively studied, which showed virus-specific effects13.

420

Related to this, our work demonstrates an important framework of experimental design in which

421

decoupling the role of ISG15 in MDA5 activation from that in downstream IFNAR signaling is

422

essential to reveal ISG15’s antiviral function that acts through regulation of type I IFN production.

423

Whereas RIG-I activation is well known to require K63-linked ubiquitination7, MDA5

424

activation by PTMs is significantly less well understood. The MDA5 CARDs have been shown to

425

be subject to several PTMs including non-covalent K63-linked polyubiquitin, SUMOylation, and

426

K48-linked ubiquitination5. It will be important to investigate how specific PTMs are temporally

427

regulated, or whether they have cell-type-specific roles. Along these lines, some PTMs may ‘cross-

428

talk’ with each other. For example, whereas ISGylation at K23 and K43 promotes MDA5

429

activation during viral infection, degradative K48-linked ubiquitination at these sites may

. Therefore, the physiological role of ISG15 in antiviral immunity has been elusive. This study

430

destabilize the MDA5 protein after the virus has been cleared successfully. Furthermore, how

431

SUMOylation, which precedes PP1-mediated CARD dephosphorylation, influences MDA5

432

ISGylation, warrants further investigation. Regardless, our findings indicate that ISGylation of

433

MDA5 acts analogously to the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I in driving CARD-dependent

434

RLR-signal activation. Similar to K63-ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs, ISGylation is

435

dependent on PP1-mediated CARD dephosphorylation and promotes MDA5 CARD

436

oligomerization and higher-order MDA5 assemblies. Despite these functional commonalities,

437

ubiquitin and ISG15 have very distinct characteristics. Most notably, while ubiquitin is abundant

438

in both uninfected and infected cells, ISG15 expression is minimal under normal (uninfected)

439

conditions but is profoundly upregulated in response to IFN. Accordingly, the ISGylation of the

440

host proteome is strongly increased in response to viral infection/IFN stimulation; however, even

441

at basal levels, ISG15 is conjugated to many host proteins, including MDA5 as our work showed17.

442

Thus, in viral infections exclusively sensed by MDA5, the low basal ISGylation activity of the cell

443

may be sufficient for immediate activation of MDA5, whose basal levels are also extremely low.

444

During viral infections that are sensed by multiple PRRs, MDA5 ISGylation may be a “priming”

445

mechanism by which IFN induction and the ensuing ISG15 upregulation by immediate innate

446

sensors (e.g. RIG-I) primes MDA5 to enter a ‘kick-start’ mode. This concept would be consistent

447

with the temporal role of RIG-I and MDA5 during certain viral infections (for example,

448

flaviviruses such as WNV) where RIG-I acts early and MDA5 signals later41. Interestingly, unlike

449

MDA5, RIG-I has been shown to be negatively regulated by ISG15 (both covalent and noncovalent

450

ISG15 binding has been reported)21, 22. Therefore, it is conceivable that the differential regulation

451

of RIG-I and MDA5 by ISG15 may represent a mechanism of ‘sensor switching’ where MDA5

21

452

activation is promoted when ISG15 levels increase while, at the same time, RIG-I activity is being

453

dampened.

454

The K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I is antagonized by several viral pathogens using a

455

variety of mechanisms42. We identified that SCoV2 PLpro antagonizes MDA5 ISGylation (but not

456

RIG-I CARD K63-ubiquitination) via its enzymatic activity after binding to the sensor. Our data

457

also suggest that this immune evasion mechanism is likely conserved among several coronaviruses,

458

which needs to be further investigated in the context of authentic infection. Interestingly, recent

459

cryo-EM analyses revealed that the coronaviral Nsp3 protein is part of a molecular pore complex

460

that spans ER-derived double-membrane vesicles and exports newly-synthesized viral RNA43.

461

These results, combined with our findings identifying the MDA5-Nsp3(PLpro) interaction,

462

support a model in which MDA5 may position itself in close proximity to the site of viral RNA

463

export to facilitate PAMP detection; however, the PLpro domain of Nsp3 (which is on the

464

cytoplasmic side) disarms MDA5 signaling function through direct de-ISGylation. Instead of

direct de-ISGylation, some viruses may indirectly regulate MDA5 ISGylation, such as through

466

manipulation of MDA5 S88 phosphorylation, as seen for the MeV V protein. Future studies should

467

investigate the mechanistic details of viral evasion of ISG15-dependent MDA5 activation and,

468

more broadly, the ISGylome manipulated by different viral pathogens that determines

469

pathogenesis.

470

Taken together, our study uncovers a prominent role for ISGylation in activating MDA5-

471

mediated immunity as well as its inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, unveiling a potential molecular

472

target for the design of therapeutics against COVID-19.

915

control lentiviral particles and shRNA lentiviral particles targeting ISG15 (TL319471V) or IFIH1

916

(TL303992V) were purchased from OriGene. Lentiviral transduction of human PBMCs (1 ×105

917

cells; MOI 8) was performed in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene (Santa Cruz). Knockdown

918

efficiency was determined by qRT-PCR or immunoblotting as indicated.

919

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).

920

Total RNA was purified using the E.Z.N.A. HP Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek) as per the

921

manufacturer’s instructions. One-step qRT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum

922

One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen) and predesigned PrimeTime qPCR Probe Assays (IDT) on a

923

7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Relative mRNA expression was

924

normalized to the levels of GAPDH and expressed relative to the values for control cells using the

925

ΔΔCt method.

926

Luciferase reporter assay.

927

IFN-β reporter assay was performed as previously described15. Briefly, HEK293T or

928

MDA5 KO HEK293 cells were transfected with IFN-β luciferase reporter construct and β-

929

galactosidase (β-gal) expressing pGK-β-gal, along with GST-MDA5-2CARD (WT or mutants) or

930

FLAG-MDA5 (WT or mutants). At the indicated time points after transfection, luciferase and β-

931

gal activities were determined using respectively the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and β-

932

Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega) on a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek).

933

Luciferase activity was normalized to β-gal values, and fold induction was calculated relative to

934

vector-transfected samples, set to 1.

938

were transfected for 24 h with either non-targeting control siRNA or ISG15-specific siRNA and

939

then transfected with EMCV-RNA or RABVLe for 16 h. Cells were homogenized in an isotonic

940

buffer using a Dounce homogenizer and the lysates were centrifuged at 600 ×g to pellet the nuclei

941

and unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 ×g at 4°C for 30 min to

942

separate the cytosolic (supernatant) and mitochondrial (pellet) fractions. The protein concentration

943

of both fractions was determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce), and equal amounts

944

of proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Anti-a-tubulin and anti-MAVS immunoblotting

945

served as markers for the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively.

946

In vitro RNA-binding assay.

947

WT and Isg15-/- MEFs were stimulated with IFN-b (1,000 U/mL) for 24 h. Cells were

948

lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 1 mM

949

EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). NeutrAvidin agarose beads (Pierce) were

950

conjugated with the biotinylated HMW-Poly(I:C) at 4°C for 4 h. Cell lysates were incubated with

951

the conjugated beads at 4°C for 16 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and

952

then boiled at 95°C in 1× Laemmli SDS sample buffer to elute the proteins. Precipitated proteins

953

were resolved on Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by IB with anti-MDA5. Equal input

954

MDA5 protein amounts were confirmed by IB with anti-MDA5.

955

Native PAGE.

956

Native PAGE for analyzing endogenous IRF3 dimerization was performed as previously

957

described16. For measuring MDA5 oligomerization, HEK293T or HEK293 MDA5 KO cells were

958

transfected with WT or mutant FLAG-MDA5-2CARD or FLAG-MDA5 as indicated. Twenty-

959

four hours later, cells were lysed in 1× NativePAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 1%

960

(v/v) NP-40 on ice for 30 min and then lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g at 4°C

962

per the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.

963

Semi-denaturating detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE).

964

MDA5 oligomerization in MEFs transfected with EMCV-RNA, or in HEK293 MDA5 KO

965

cells reconstituted with WT or mutant FLAG-MDA5, was determined by SDD-AGE as previously

966

described with modifications17. Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES

967

(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail

968

(Sigma) at 4°C for 20 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g at 4°C for 10

969

min and then incubated on ice for 1 h. Cell lysates were subsequently incubated in 1× SDD-AGE

970

buffer (0.5× TBE, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% (w/v) SDS) for 15 min at room temperature and

971

resolved on a vertical 1.5% agarose gel containing 1× TBE and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 80 V for 90

972

min at 4°C. Proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane and analyzed by immunoblotting

973

with the indicated antibodies.

974

Viral RNA purification.

975

EMCV-RNA was produced as previously described7. Briefly, Vero cells were infected with

976

EMCV (MOI 0.1) for 16 h, and total RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA extraction kit

977

(Zymo Research) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Mock-RNA and SCoV2-RNA were

978

produced by isolating total RNA from uninfected or SCoV2-infected (MOI 1 for 24 h) Vero-

979

hACE2 cells. RABVLe was generated by in vitro transcription using the MEGAshortscript T7

980

Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) as previously described18.

981

Virus infection and titration.

982

All viral infections were performed by inoculating cells with the virus inoculum diluted in

983

MEM or DMEM containing 2% FBS. After 1-2 h, the virus inoculum was removed and replaced

with the complete growth medium (MEM or DMEM containing 10% FBS) and cells were further

985

incubated for the indicated times. EMCV titration was performed either on Vero cells using the

986

median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) methodology as previously described19, or on

987

BHK-21 cells by the standard plaque assay. The titers of ZIKV were determined by plaque assay

988

on Vero cells as previously described6. Titration of SCoV2 was performed on Vero-hACE2 cells

989

by plaque assay.

990

Flow cytometry.

991

To quantify the percentage of DENV-infected cells, reconstituted HEK293 MDA5 KO cells

992

were washed with PBS (Gibco) and fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature

993

for 30 min. Cells were subsequently permeabilized with 1× BD Perm/Wash buffer (BD

994

Biosciences) for 15 min and incubated with an anti-flavivirus E antibody (4G2; 1:100 in 1× BD

995

Perm/Wash buffer) at 4°C for 30 min. Cells were further washed three times with 1× BD

996

Perm/Wash buffer and incubated with a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary

997

antibody (#A10667, 1:500 in 1× BD Perm/Wash buffer; Invitrogen) at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.

998

After washing three times with 1× BD Perm/Wash buffer, cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur

999

flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using the FlowJo software.

1000

Virus protection assay.

1001

The culture supernatants from mutant or WT EMCV-infected NHLFs or RIG-I KO

1002

HEK293 cells were UV-inactivated in a biosafety cabinet under a UV-C lamp (30W) at a dose of

1003

5,000 μJ/cm2 for 15 min. Complete inactivation of EMCV was confirmed by plaque assay on

1004

BHK-21 cells. The inactivated supernatants were then transferred onto fresh Vero cells for 24 h,

1005

and the primed Vero cells were subsequently infected with ZIKV (MOI 0.002 to 2) for 72 h, or

1006

with EMCV (MOI 0.001 to 0.1) for 40 h. ZIKV-positive cells were determined by immunostaining
