Abstract

32

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of Coronavirus

33

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and responsible for the current pandemic. Recent SARS-CoV-2

34

susceptibility and transmission studies in cats show that the virus can replicate in these companion

35

animals and transmit to other cats. Here, we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

36

associated disease and transmission dynamics in domestic cats. Six 4- to 5-month-old cats were

37

challenged with SARS-CoV-2 via intranasal and oral routes simultaneously. One day post

38

challenge (DPC), two sentinel contact cats were co-mingled with the principal infected animals.

39

Animals were monitored for clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and viral shedding

40

throughout the 21 DPC observation period. Postmortem examinations were performed at 4, 7 and

41

21 DPC to investigate disease progression. Viral RNA was not detected in blood but transiently

42

in nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as well as various

43

tissues. Tracheobronchoadenitis of submucosal glands with the presence of viral RNA and antigen

44

was observed in airways of the infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. Serology showed that both, principal

45

and sentinel cats, developed SARS-CoV-2-specific and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2

46

detectable at 7 DPC or 10 DPC, respectively. All animals were clinically asymptomatic during

47

the course of the study and capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to sentinels within 2 days of

48

comingling. The results of this study are critical for our understanding of the clinical course of

49

SARS-CoV-2 in a naturally susceptible host species, and for risk assessment of the maintenance

50

of SARS-CoV-2 in felines and transmission to other animals and humans.

1. Introduction

53

Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the

54

order Nidovirales in the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, and are comprised

55

of four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus

56

(Fehr and Perlman 2015). Many alpha- and betacoronaviruses originate from bats, while gamma-

57

and deltacoronaviruses originate in birds (Woo, Lau et al. 2012). The Severe Acute Respiratory

58

Syndrome-related Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), and the Middle East

59

Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belong to the genus betacoronavirus

60

(Gorbalenya, Baker et al. 2020; Fung and Liu 2019). Alpha- and betacoronaviruses infect only

61

mammals and cause important diseases of humans, cattle, pigs, cats, dogs, horses, and camels

62

(Saif, 2004; Woo, Lau et al. 2012; Fehr and Perlman 2015). In general, coronaviruses cause

63

respiratory, enteric, and systemic infections in humans and numerous animal hosts (Saif, 2004,

64

Fehr and Perlman 2015). Importantly, coronaviruses can occasionally cross the species barriers

65

(Drexler, Corman et al. 2014; Corman, Muth et al. 2018).

66

Bats have been identified as a reservoir species for many coronaviruses including those

67

causing important human epidemics, namely SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012

68

(Drexler, Corman et al. 2014). Camels have since been shown to serve as the primary intermediate

69

and reservoir host for MERS-CoV, causing continued zoonotic animal-to-human transmissions

70

(de Wit, Doremalen et al. 2016). During the SARS-CoV epidemic, infected domestic cats were

71

identified from households of SARS-CoV positive patients, and both cats and ferrets were

72

subsequently experimentally shown to be easily infected and transmit SARS-CoV (Martina,

73

Haagmans et al. 2003; van den Brand, Haagmans et al. 2008).

74

SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and responsible for the

75

current global pandemic (Zhou, Yang et al. 2020). A zoonotic transmission event amplified at a

76

seafood and animal market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, is suspected to be the site of the

77

first significant infectious outbreak in humans (Li, Guan et al. 2020), with bats and/or pangolins

78

being speculated as the potential origin species based on the sequence homology of coronaviruses

79

isolated from these animals (Anderson, Rambaut et al. 2020; Zhang, Wu et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang

80

et al. 2020).

81

Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in December of 2019, it has been

82

demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can naturally and experimentally infect several animal species

83

(Lakdawala and Menachery 2020; Hernandez, Abad et al. 2020; Oreshkova et al. 2020). There

84

have been multiple case reports of natural transmission of the virus from humans to dogs and cats,

85

infection of “big cats” (i.e. a lion and tigers) at the Bronx Zoo, and mink on farms in The

86

Netherlands, Denmark and Spain (Newman, Smith et al. 2020; Leroy, Gouilh et al. 2020;

87

Oreshkova et al., 2020). In a recent animal susceptibility study, dogs, cats, ferrets, pigs, chickens

88

and ducks were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Shi, Wen et al. 2020). The results

89

from that study show that both cats and ferrets were efficiently infected and could transmit the

90

virus, dogs showed low susceptibility, while pigs and avian species were not permissive hosts. In

91

addition, non-human primates (NHPs), hamsters and hACE2 transgenic or adenovirus transduced

92

mice have also been evaluated as potential animal models for SARS-CoV-2 and seem to be

93

susceptible showing mild to severe clinical signs (Cleary, Pitchford et al. 2020; Lakdawala and

94

Menachery 2020).

95

The close association between humans and animals including companion animals, livestock

96

and wildlife species, raises concerns regarding the potential risks of transmission of SARS-CoV4

2 from humans to animals (“reverse zoonosis”), and the potential role infected animals could play

98

in perpetuating the spread of the disease (Hernandez, Abad et al. 2020; Leroy, Gouilh et al. 2020).

99

Further research of SARS-CoV-2 infection in various animal species is needed in order to identify

100

susceptible hosts and to better understand the infection, disease, clinical course and transmission

101

capabilities of susceptible animal species. This knowledge is important for risk assessment,

102

implementing mitigation strategies, addressing animal welfare issues, and to develop preclinical

103

animal models for evaluating drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19.

104

Here we present an in-depth study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated disease and

105

transmission in domestic cats. Clinical evaluation of weight, body temperature, blood parameters,

106

serology, viral RNA shedding and RNA distribution in tissues and organ systems, and associated

107

pathological findings are presented and discussed.

2.1. Cells and Virus

111

Vero E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA,

112

USA) were used for virus propagation and titration. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified

113

Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Corning, New York, N.Y, USA), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine

114

serum (FBS, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and antibiotics/antimycotics (Fisher

115

Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The SARS-

116

CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain was acquired from Biodefense and Emerging Infection Research

117

Resources Repository (catalogue # NR-52281, BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA) and passaged

118

sequenced by next generation sequencing (NGS) using the Illumina MiSeq and its consensus

120

sequence was found to be 100% homologous to the original USA-WA1/2020 strain (GenBank

121

accession: MN985325.1). To determine infectious virus titer, 10-fold serial dilutions were

122

performed on 96-well plates of Vero E6 cells. The presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) after 96

123

hours incubation was used to calculate the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml using the

124

Spearman-Karber method (Hierholzer and Killington 1996). The prepared SARS-CoV-2 stock

125

has a titer of 1 x 106 TCID50/ml; this virus stock was used for experimental infection of the cats.

141

groups (Figure 1, and Table 1). Group 1 (principal infected animals) consisted of six cats (three

142

cats per housing unit), were inoculated simultaneously via the intranasal and oral routes with a

143

total dose of 1 x 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 in a total of 2 ml DMEM medium (0.5 ml per nostril

144

and 1 ml oral). The cats in Group 2 (n=2; sentinel contact animals) and Group 3 (n=2; mock

145

control animals) were housed in a separate room (Table 1, and Figure 1). Mock-infected cats

146

(Group 3) were administered 2 ml DMEM via the intranasal and oral routes similar to Group 1

147

animals. At 1-day post challenge (DPC), the two cats in Group 2 were co-mingled with the

148

principal infected animals in Group 1 (one cat per housing unit), and served as sentinel contact

149

controls. The remaining two cats in Group 3 remained housed in a separate room and served as

150

mock-infected negative controls. Principal infected animals were euthanized for postmortem

151

examinations at 4 (n=2), 7 (n=2) and 21 (n=1) DPC to evaluate the course of disease. The two

152

negative control animals in Group 3 were euthanized for postmortem examinations at 3 DPC. The

153

remaining three animals from Group 1 (one principal infected animal) and Group 2 (two sentinel

154

contact animals) were maintained for future re-infection studies, and not terminated as part of this

155

study.

Clinical evaluations and sample collection

157

Cats were observed daily for clinical signs, such as: fever, anorexia, lethargy, respiratory

158

distress, inappetence, depression, recumbency, coughing, sneezing, diarrhea/loose stool, vomiting

159

and others. Weights of all cats were recorded on bleed days. Blood and serum were collected

160

from all cats, including sentinel contact controls, on -1 DPC prior to infection, and on days 1, 3, 5,

161

7, 10, 14 and 21 DPC via venipuncture of the cephalic vein under anesthesia or during terminal

162

bleeding by cardiac puncture. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected on -1, 1,

vortexed and supernatant aliquoted directly into cryovials or into RLT buffer (Qiagen,

166

Germantown, MD, USA) and stored at -80 oC until further analysis.

167

A full postmortem examination was performed for each cat at the indicated time-points and

168

gross changes (if any) were recorded. Tissues were collected either in 10% neutral-buffered

169

173

the trachea, and the main bronchi were collected at the level of the bifurcation and at the entry

174

point into the lung lobe (Figure S2B). Lung lobes were evaluated based on gross pathology and

175

collected and sampled separately (Figure S2C). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), nasal wash

176

and urine were also collected during postmortem examination and stored at -80oC until analyzed.

Fresh frozen tissue homogenates were prepared by thawing frozen tissue and placing 200 mg (±

178

50 mg) of minced tissue in a tube containing 1 ml DMEM culture medium and a steel bead

179

(Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Homogenization was performed with the TissueLyser LT

180

(Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) for 30 seconds at 30 hertz repeated 3 times. Supernatant was

(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Extraction positive controls (IDT, IA, USA;

211

2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control, diluted 1:100 in RLT) and negative controls were employed.

212

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed using the N2 SARS-CoV-2 primer

213

and probe sets (see: https://www.idtdna.com/pages/landing/coronavirus-research-reagents/cdc-

214

assays) in a RT-qPCR protocol established by the CDC for the detection of SARS-CoV-2

215

233

VeroE6 cells in 96-well plates. The corresponding SARS-CoV-2-negative cat sera, virus only and

234

media only controls were also included in the assay. The neutralizing antibody titer was recorded

235

as the highest serum dilution at which at least 50% of wells showed virus neutralization (NT50)

238

To detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera, indirect ELISAs were performed with the

239

recombinant viral proteins, nucleoprotein (N) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which were

240

produced in-house. The N protein was produced in E. coli with a C-terminal His-Tag, and RBD

241

was expressed in mammalian cells with a C-terminal Strep-Tag, and each were purified using

242

either Ni-NTA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or Strep-Tactin (IBA Lifesciences,

243

Goettingen, Germany) columns, respectively, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. An

244

optimal concentration of the respective coating antigen was first determined by checkerboard

245

titration using SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative cat sera.

246

For indirect ELISAs, wells were coated with 100 ng of the respective protein in 100 μl per

247

282

and eosin following standard procedures within the histology laboratories of the Kansas State

2.9. SARS-CoV-2-specific RNAscope® in situ hybridization (RNAscope® ISH)

287

For RNAscope® ISH, an anti-sense probe targeting the spike (S; nucleotide sequence:

288

21,563-25,384) of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 isolate (GenBank accession number

289

MN985325.1) was designed (Advanced Cell Diagnostics [ACD], Newark, CA, USA) and used as

290

previously described (Carossino et al. 2020). Four-micron sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-

291

embedded tissues were mounted on positively charged Superfrost® Plus Slides (VWR, Radnor,

292

PA, USA). The RNAscope® ISH assay was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Red Detection

293

Kit (ACD) as previously described (Carossino et al. 2019; Carossino et al. 2020). Briefly,

294

deparaffinized sections were incubated with a ready-to-use hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min

295

at room temperature and subsequently subjected to Target Retrieval for 15 min at 98-102 °C in 1X

296

Target Retrieval Solution. Tissue sections were dehydrated in 100% ethanol for 10 min and treated

297

with Protease Plus for 20 min at 40 °C in a HybEZ™ oven (ACD). Slides were subsequently

298

incubated with a ready-to-use probe mixture for 2 h at 40 °C in the HybEZ™ oven, and the signal

299

amplified using a specific set of amplifiers (AMP1-6 as recommended by the manufacturer). The

300

signal was detected using a Fast-Red solution (Red B: Red A in a 1:60 ratio) for 10 minutes at

2.10. SARS-CoV-2-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC)

306

For IHC, four-micron sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were mounted on

307

positively charged Superfrost® Plus slides and subjected to IHC using a SARS-CoV-2-specific

308

anti-nucleocapsid mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 6F10, BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA)

309

as previously described (Carossino et al., 2020). IHC was performed using the automated BOND-

310

MAX and the Polymer Refine Red Detection kit (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), as

311

previously described (Carossino et al. 2019).

312

induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed using a ready-to-use citrate-based solution (pH

313

6.0; Leica Biosystems) at 100 °C for 20 min. Sections were then incubated with the primary

314

antibody (diluted at 1 μg/ml in Antibody Diluent [Dako, Carpinteria, CA]) for 30 min at room

315

temperature, followed by a polymer-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with alkaline

316

phosphatase (30 minutes; Powervision, Leica Biosystems). Fast Red was used as the chromogen

317

(15 minutes), and counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Slides were mounted with a

318

permanent mounting medium (Micromount®, Leica Biosystems). Sections from mock- and

SARS-CoV-2-infected domestic cats remain subclinical.

323

Body temperature and clinical signs were recorded daily. No remarkable clinical signs were

324

observed over the course of the study. At 2 DPC, some of the infected cats developed a

325

temperature above 38.7 oC, but otherwise body temperature remained within the normal range for

326

the remainder of the study. Body temperatures of sentinels were elevated at 1-, 10- and 12-days

327

post contact (DPCo), but otherwise remained within normal range [Figure S1A]. Body weights

328

of all cats increased throughout the study as expected for young animals without clinical disease

329

[Figure S1B]. Complete blood counts and serum biochemistry were performed on days -1, 1, 3,

330

5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 DPC for the principal infected cats, and 2, 4, 6, 9, 13 and 20 DPCo for the

331

sentinels. Overall, no significant changes in most blood cell parameters or serum biochemistry

332

were observed. White blood cell (WBC) counts remained within normal limits for most animals

333

during the course of the study; mildly increased WBC counts observed at -1 DPC and 1 DPC were

334

attributed to stress early in the course of the study. No significant changes were observed in serum

335

biochemical analytes except elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in many animals starting

336

at 5 DPC in the sentinels and after 7 DPC in the principal infected animals [Figure S1C], which

337

might indicate growth of subadult animals.

Results

338

SARS-CoV-2 RNA found throughout the respiratory tract.

339

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal swabs of the principal infected cats at 1 through

340

10 DPC, with maximal quantities observed from 1 through 5 DPC (Figure 2A). The nasal swabs

341

of contact animals became RNA positive for SARS-CoV-2 starting at day 2 DPCo (i.e. 3 DPC)

342

and remained positive up to 9 DPCo/10 DPC, with a maximum on day 6 DPCo/7 DPC that is

343

nearly as high as the copy number detected in the principal infected animals at 1 through 5 DPC

344

(Figure 2A). The oropharyngeal swabs were RNA positive starting at 1 DPC through 10 DPC for

345

the principals and 2 DPCo through 4 DPCo for the sentinels, with a maximum on 4 DPC and 4

346

DPCo, respectively (Figure 2B). Overall viral RNA in oropharyngeal swabs was approximately

347

1 to 2 logs lower than what was seen in the nasal swabs, for all cats except the principal infected

348

at 4 DPC.

349

Viral RNA was also detected in respiratory tract tissues in principal infected animals (Figure

350

3A, B). Fresh tissues collected during postmortem examination [see Figure S2A, B, C] from the

351

nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi and all lung lobes were RNA positive for all animals at 4 and 7 DPC

352

(Figure 3A, B), with RNA copy number ranging from 107 to 1011 CN/mL for nearly all cats

353

necropsied at these time points. Viral RNA levels in the lungs tended to be lower than the upper

354

respiratory tract for cats necropsied at 7 DPC (Figure 3B). At 21 DPC viral RNA was detected

355

within the upper respiratory samples, i.e. bronchi and right caudal lung lobe (Figure 3A, B). Nasal

356

washes and BALF collected at necropsy from all principal infected cats examined at 4 and 7 DPC

357

were RNA positive, but negative from the cat evaluated at 21 DPC (Table 2).

358

Gross pathology of the respiratory tract was accessed during postmortem examination. The

359

lungs were removed in toto from each animal at 4, 7 and 21 DPC and demonstrated varying degree

360

and distribution of edema, discoloration, congestion and atelectasis (data not shown); this could

361

be attributed to euthanasia. Histologically, the pathological changes were limited to the upper and

362

lower airways (larynx, trachea, and main, lobar and segmental bronchi of the lungs) of SARS-

363

CoV-2 principal infected cats. Pathological findings are characterized by multifocal lymphocytic

364

and neutrophilic tracheobronchoadenitis of seromucous lands of the lamina propria and submucosa

365

of the trachea and bronchi. Changes range from minimal to mild at 4 DPC and progress to mild

366

to moderate by 7 DPC (Figures 4, and Figure S3). Affected submucosal glands and associated

367

ducts were variably distended (ectatic), lined by attenuated epithelium, contain various amounts

368

of necrotic cell debris. In more severely affected foci glands are poorly delineated, and disrupted

369

by mild to moderate numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells, and few

370

neutrophils (Figure 4, and Figure S3). No significant pathology was identified elsewhere in the

371

pulmonary parenchyma (bronchioles, pulmonary vessels, alveolar spaces, alveolar septa and

372

visceral pleura) of SARS-CoV-2-infected cats on 4 and 7 DPC. No significant histologic changes

373

were noted in the respiratory tract at 21 DPC, with the submucosal architecture of the trachea and

374

bronchi being unremarkable and within normal limits (Figure 4, and Figure S3).

375

The cellular tropism, distribution and abundance of SARS-CoV-2 were also investigated via

376

the detection of viral RNA and viral antigen by RNAscope® ISH and IHC, respectively. Presence

377

of viral RNA and antigen correlated with the histological changes observed in the airways and

378

were detected within epithelial cells of submucosal glands and associated ducts at 4 and 7 DPC

379

(Figure 5, and Figure S4). SARS-CoV-2-positive submucosal glands were more frequently

380

observed at 4 DPC compared to 7 DPC (Figure 5, and Figure S4). Viral RNA and viral antigen

381

were not detected at 21 DPC (Figure 5, and Figure S4). Noteworthy, no viral RNA or antigen

382

were detected within lining epithelial cells or elsewhere in the pulmonary parenchyma, including

383

smaller airways (i.e. bronchioles) and alveoli, at 4, 7 or 21 DPC.

384

SARS-CoV-2 RNA found throughout non-respiratory organs and tissues

385

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in rectal swabs starting at 3 DPC for principal infected cats

386

and 2 DPCo for sentinel cats and were found positive up to 14 DPC or 13 DPCo, respectively.

387

High level of RNA shedding was maintained from 3 DPC or 2 DPCo throughout 14 DPC or 13

and sentinel cats (Figure 2C). Urine collected directly from the bladder during postmortem

390

examination of cats sacrificed at 4, 7, 21 DPC was negative by RT-qPCR (Table 2). Viral RNA

391

was also detected in the GI tract and other organs and tissues in principal infected animals, such

392

as tonsils, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, liver, heart, bone marrow and olfactory bulb (Figure 3C,

393

D). Tonsils, lymph nodes and olfactory bulbs of all cats were positive on 4, 7, and 21 DPC. The

394

highest CN of RNA was detected in the tonsils, tracheobronchial and mesenteric lymph nodes at

395

all days tested. Spleen was negative on 4 DPC, but all animals were positive on 7 and 21 DPC.

396

RNA was present in the pooled tissue from the GI tract and heart in all animals on 4 and 7 DPC.

397

Liver, kidney, and bone marrow were occasionally positive on different time points post infection.

398

CSF was RT-qPCR positive from 1 of the 2 cats necropsied at 4 DPC and 1 of 2 cats necropsied

399

at 7 DPC, but not at 21 DPC (Figure 3D, and Table 2). Blood from all cats collected at -1, 1, 3,

400

5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 DPC were RT-qPCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Gross evaluation of the GI

401

tract, the cardiovascular and central nervous system as well as additional visceral organs and

402

lymphoid tissues revealed no macroscopic changes between SARS-CoV-2 and mock-infected cats

403

at any time-point post infection. Additionally, no histopathological changes were identified in

404

multiple segments of the GI tract or in other organs examined so far.

405

Seroconversion of cats after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

406

Sera collected at -1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 DPC was tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2

specific antibodies. Virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in sera from all principal infected

408

and contact sentinel cats at 10, 14 and 21 DPC, with neutralizing titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:320

409

(Table 3). Sera from principal or sentinel animals tested before 7 or 10 DPC were negative for

410

neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Antibodies against the N protein were detected in all

principal-infected cats starting at 7 DPC and in the two sentinel cats after 9 DPCo throughout the

417

Identifying susceptible species and their capacity to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the

Discussion

418

determination of likely sources of reverse zoonosis and for mitigating viral spread.

419

development of animal models for COVID-19 is equally critical for studying the mechanisms of

420

the disease and for evaluating the efficacy of potential vaccines, antiviral drugs and therapies. In

421

this study we explored in-depth the infection, associated disease and transmission dynamics in 4-

422

to 5-months old domestic cats. The cats were antibody profile defined/specific pathogen free

423

(APD/SPF) animals with no antibody titers against various feline virus infections including feline

424

coronaviruses. The detection of high levels of viral RNA from swab samples and in various organs

425

and tissues, along with mild to moderate histologic changes in trachea and bronchi associated with

426

viral RNA and viral antigen, and the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies

427

demonstrates that cats were productively infected, without developing any obvious clinical signs.

428

Viral RNA was detected at 4 and 7 DPC throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts, GI

429

tract, olfactory bulb, and lymphoid and other tissues of all inoculated cats; viral RNA was mostly

430

cleared by 21 DPC in the lungs, BALF, nasal washes and other tissues including GI tract, but

431

persisted in the upper respiratory tract, and lymphoid tissue. In contrast, viral RNA was detected

432

in the spleen only at 7 and 21 DPC, but not at 4 DPC. Absence of viral RNA shedding and

433

histologic changes in the lungs and trachea at 21 DPC as well as seroconversion suggests that the

434

cats were responding to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection by mounting a humoral immune

435

response and recovering from the infection at 3-weeks post experimental inoculation.

436

Furthermore, the principal infected cats were able to transmit the virus to negative contact animals

437

within 2 days of contact housing similar as reported by Halfmann and coworkers (2020). High

438

amounts of viral RNA shedding through the respiratory and GI tract are most likely responsible

439

for the transmission to the sentinel animals. Shi and coworkers (2020) determined that airborne

440

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among cats is possible but not highly effective.

441

Our results, the studies by Shi et al. (2020) and Halfmann et al. (2020), as well as the reports

442

of pet cats in households with COVID-19 patients (Newman, Smith et al. 2020; Leroy, Gouilh et

443

al. 2020), show that felines are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and could be potential virus

444

reservoirs. Consistent with our results, Shi et al. (2020) and Halfmann et al. (2020) also reported

445

no obvious clinical signs in SARS-CoV-2 infected cats which were older than 4 months. We

446

detected high viral RNA levels throughout nearly all tissues tested for all cats at 4 and 7 DPC, with

447

reduced levels or clearing by 21 DPC in some tissues: residual RNA was detected mainly in the

448

upper respiratory tract, the lymphoid tissues and the CNS. Since no virus was detected in blood, it

449

remains to be studied how the virus reaches and infects non-respiratory tissues. Shi and colleagues

450

(2020) also reported that viral RNA and infectious virus was detected throughout upper and lower

451

respiratory tracts in juvenile (70-100 days old) and subadult cats (6-9 months old) at 3 DPC but it

452

was cleared from most lung tissues of subadult cats by 6 DPC; however, in juvenile cats, viral

453

RNA and infectious virus was still present on 6 DPC in the lower respiratory tract (Shi et al., 2020).

454

In contrast, no viral RNA or virus was detected in other organs of any of these cats which included

455

brain, heart, submaxillary lymph nodes, kidney, spleen, liver, and pancreas at 3 or 6 DPC (Shi,

456

Wen et al. 2020). Similar to Shi and colleagues (2020) who detected viral RNA and infectious

457

virus in the small intestine of most of the animals we found shedding of viral RNA in rectal swabs

458

up to 14 DPC and viral RNA in pooled GI tract tissues on 4 and 7 DPC. In contrast, Halfmann

459

and coworkers (2020) found all rectal swabs to be virus negative. These differences may be

460

explained by the age of the cats used in these studies, and the different virus strains used. Shi et

461

al. (2020) were also describing SARS-CoV-2 associated pathological changes in juvenile and

462

subadult cats, and noticed more severe pathology was associated with the juvenile cats, including

463

histopathological lesions in nasal and tracheal mucosal epithelia and lungs (Shi, Wen et al. 2020).

464

Our results are consistent with that study, showing cats 4 to 5 months of age had mild to moderate

465

histologic alterations identified as tracheobronchoadenitis within the airways. The macroscopic

466

lung lesions observed at postmortem examinations were most likely due to the euthanasia with

467

barbiturates. Importantly, all SARS-CoV-2 infected cats (principal and sentinel animals) in our

468

study mounted an antiviral and neutralizing antibody response during the 21-day observation

469

period. Virus specific antibodies to the N and RBD proteins were detected in all principal animals

470

starting at 7 DPC as well as virus neutralizing antibodies. Other studies reported detection of IgG

471

antibodies against RBD as early as 1 DPC (Halfmann, Hatta et al. 2020), and virus specific and

472

neutralizing antibodies in all principal inoculated cats, but only in 2 out of the 6 sentinel animals

473

(Shi, Wen et al. 2020). None of these studies detected virus or viral RNA in the blood.

474

Similar to previous experimental infection studies with SARS-CoV-1 (Martina, Haagmans

475

et al. 2003; van den Brand et al. 2008) and more recently SARS-CoV-2 (Shi, Wen et al. 2020) in

476

cats, histological changes within the airways (namely trachea and main, lobar and segmental

bronchi) under our experimental infection conditions with SARS-CoV-2 in cats are limited to mild

478

to moderate neutrophilic and lymphocytic tracheobronchoadenitis with associated intralesional

479

detection of viral RNA and viral antigen. While SARS-CoV-1 antigen was identified in sporadic

480

tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells in a single experimentally infected cat (Martina, Haagmans

481

et al. 2003; van den Brand, Haagmans et al. 2008), we determined that the airway epithelial lining

482

of the trachea and the main, lobar and segmental bronchi seems non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2

483

replication in vivo at least in subadult cats (4- to 5-months old) as demonstrated by the lack of viral

484

RNA and viral antigen within these specific cells using RNAscope® ISH and IHC; this correlated

with the lack of histologic alterations on the surface epithelium other than sporadic neutrophil

486

transmigration. These findings are in partial agreement to those of another recent study on the

487

susceptibility of cats to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Shi, Wen et al. 2020), where mild histologic

488

alterations in the tracheal lumen and epithelium were reported in the absence of detectable viral

489

antigen. Interestingly, and in contrast with reports of SARS-CoV-1 infection in cats, SARS-CoV-

490

2 infected 4- to 5-months old cats did not demonstrate histological changes within the small

491

airways or the pulmonary parenchyma consistent with interstitial pneumonia or diffuse alveolar

492

damage (DAD)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as inflammatory infiltrates

within alveolar septa or alveolar spaces, intra-alveolar fibrin or hyaline membranes, or pneumocyte

494

type II hyperplasia.

495

pneumocytes or alveolar macrophages as demonstrated by the absence of viral RNA (RNAscope®

496

ISH) and viral antigen (IHC). These findings correlate with the absence of clinically evident

497

respiratory disease following experimental infection, with the duration and magnitude of viral

498

shedding, and with the onset of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses; and with no histologic

499

changes or viral RNA and viral antigen present within the respiratory tissues by 21 DPC. While a

500

recent study evaluating the susceptibility of domestic cats to SARS-CoV-2 (Shi et al., 2020)

501

suggested the occurrence of additional histologic alterations in the pulmonary vasculature and

502

alveolar spaces, none of these changes were noted in our experimental model. Additional studies

503

are needed to determine whether these differences are due to the breed and age of the domestic

508

information will be important for providing appropriate veterinary care for infected cats and other

509

cats in their surroundings, for protection of veterinary personnel, animal caretakers and pet owners,

510

and for implementing quarantine measures to prevent transmission between felines, people and

511

potentially other susceptible animals. The ease of transmission between domestic cats indicates a

512

significant public health necessity to investigate the potential chain of human-cat-human

513

transmission potential. It is also critical that pet owners are educated on the risks and preventative

514

measures in order to calm fears and discourage animal abandonment.

515

Although asymptomatic, cats can be productively infected and readily transmit SARS-CoV-

516

2 to other susceptible cats, and thus may serve as potential models for asymptomatic COVID-19

517

infections in humans. It could also offer a viable model for testing vaccines and antiviral

518

candidates for companion animals and for drugs with a problematic pharmacokinetic profile in

519

rodents, ferrets or nonhuman primates. However, a preclinical animal model that represents the

520

clinical symptoms and disease observed in severe COVID-19 patients is still needed to improve

521

evaluation of vaccines, antiviral drugs and other therapies.

522

Further research is needed to adapt models to recapitulate severe disease observed in humans.

523

One area to explore is the effect of age on associated disease and recovery. Only cats less than 1

524

year old were evaluated in this study and the studies by Shi et al. (2020) and Halfmann et al.

525

(2020), but what SARS-CoV-2 infection looks like in adult and older aged cats, as well as, if re-

526

infection of cats can occur and what re-infection looks like was not explored in these studies.

527

Recent non peer-reviewed work by Bosco-Lauth and colleagues (2020) investigated experimental

528

SARS-CoV-2 challenge and direct transmission in adult cats 5 to 8 years old, and re-infection after

529

28 DPC. The results from that study demonstrate that adult cats become infected without clinical

530

signs with pathology limited to respiratory airways, and can readily transmit the virus to naïve

cats. Furthermore, the adult cats appear to be protected from reinfection and mounted significantly

532

higher neutralizing antibody responses compared to findings from our study and by Shi et al.

533

(2020). Studies to better understand the mechanisms of infection and the range of symptoms and

534

pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 in various preclinical models of COVID-19 are critical

535

for the development of vaccines and treatments of this disease.

Figure 1. Study design. Ten cats were placed into three groups. Group 1 (principal infected
animals) consisted of six cats (three cats/cage) and was inoculated via intranasal (IN) and oral
(PO) routes simultaneously with a total dose of 1 x 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 in 2 ml DMEM.
The cats in Group 2 (n=2; sentinel contact animals) and Group 3 (n=2; mock control animals)
were housed in a separate room. At 1-day post challenge (DPC), the two cats in Group 2 were
co-mingled with the principal infected animals in Group 1 (one cat per cage) and served as
sentinel contact controls. The remaining two cats in Group 3 remained housed in a separate
room and served as mock-infected negative controls. Principal infected animals were euthanized
and necropsied at 4 (n=2), 7 (n=2) and 21 (n=1) DPC to evaluate the course of disease. The two
negative control animals in Group 3 were euthanized and necropsied at 3 DPC. The remaining
three animals from Group 1 (one principal infected animal) and Group 2 (two sentinel contact
animals) were maintained for future re-infection studies.

Figure 4. Histopathology of bronchi. Histological findings in the main bronchi of mock (A)
and SARS-CoV-2 experimentally infected (B-D) cats. Histologic changes and their progression
are similar to those observed in the trachea, with multifocal, widespread, mild to moderate
lymphocytic and neutrophilic adenitis noted at 4 days post-challenge (DPC; B) and 7 DPC (C).
Necrotic debris within distorted submucosal glands are indicated with arrowheads (C), and few
transmigrating lymphocytes are indicated with an arrow (B). No histologic changes are noted at
21 DPC (D). H&E. Total magnification: 200X

Figure 5. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antigen detection in bronchi. SARS-CoV2 tropism in bronchi of mock (A and B) experimentally (C-H) infected cats
determined by S-specific RNAscope® in situ hybridization (Fast Red) and antiN-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC; Fast Red). The viral tropism is limited
to glandular and ductular epithelial cells of multifocal, scattered submucosal
glands, as noted in the trachea. Viral RNA is detected within infected cells at 4
days post-challenge (DPC; C and D) and, to a lower degree at 7 DPC (E and F).
Few scattered glandular epithelial cells are positive for SARS-CoV-2 N antigen
by IHC (D and F, insets). No viral RNA or antigen is detected at 21 DPC (G and
H). Total magnification: 100X (A, C, E and G) and 200X (B, D, F, H).
