ABSTRACT

Rigorous testing is the way forward to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Here we show that
the currently used and most reliable RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 procedure can be further
simplified to make it faster, safer and economical by bypassing the RNA isolation step. The
modified method is not only fast and convenient but also at par with the traditional method in
terms of accuracy, and therefore, can be used for mass screening. Our method takes about half
the time and is cheaper by about 40% compared to current most widely used method. We also
provide a variant of the new method that increases the efficiency of detection by about 20%
compared to the currently used method. Taken together, we demonstrate a more effective and
reliable method of SARS-CoV-2 detection.

INTRODUCTION

Rapidly growing number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases warrants
reliable and quicker testing methods (Wu et al., 2020). Currently, Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard method being used for SARS-CoV-2
detection, largely owing to its high sensitivity (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2020; Emery et al.,
2004). In the absence of specific drug and/or vaccine, the only way to control SARS-CoV-2
spread is large scale screening and isolation of the affected individuals at early stage of
infection. Screening using antibody-based methods is rapid but cannot be used for early stage
detection (Carter et al., 2020). Despite being a superior method, RT-PCR demands significant
amount of time due to a laborious and expensive RNA isolation step. Currently, the challenge
is to adapt a detection method which is quicker and still retaining the sensitivity of the standard
RT-PCR-based method.
Here we show that the RNA isolation step for performing RT-PCR can be completely
bypassed by extracting biological samples from dry swabs using TE buffer, which is costeffective and can be used as a quick screening procedure. In addition, we also show that the
sensitivity of the entire RT-PCR based detection is enhanced by at least 20%, by using RNA
isolated from TE buffer extract compared to the traditional method.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We first hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid could be detected directly by
using viral transport medium (VTM) containing swabs of COVID-19 patients. This
methodology involves the lysis of the virions (in VTM) by heating a 50 µl aliquot of VTM at
98°C for 6 minutes, followed by using 4 µl of this as a template for subsequent RT-PCR
reaction.However, our results showed a reduced detection efficiency at 50% (n=24) compared
to the traditional RNA isolation-based method (Supplementary Figure 1).
Although our data puts forth the feasibility of using VTM instead of extracted RNA,
the detection ability of this method is limited to samples with moderate to high viral load. One
of the probable reasons for this decreased efficiency could be dilution of the samples in 3 ml

VTM, and to overcome this, we changed our sample collection strategy. To test the new
strategy, two nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from each of the fourteen patients
with one swab transported dry and the other in VTM. The samples were processed as mentioned
in the methods section (Figure 1A). Of the fourteen patients, five were tested negative and the
remaining nine were positive samples, which were used for comparison. The results revealed
that the performance of dry swab-TE buffer extracts in direct RT-PCR was at par with the
currently used standard method of detection which has the additional RNA extraction step from
VTM samples (Supplementary Table 1 – D1-D14).

To further validate the usage of TE buffer extract as a template for direct RT-PCR, we
obtained similar samples from twenty-six patients, on the whole taking the sample size to forty.
The results have further strengthened our observation that the TE buffer extract is as sensitive
as the extracted RNA (n=40; Figure 1B). In fact, the average Ct values for TE-based RT-PCR
were comparable to that of the traditional method and therefore can serve as an alternative
method (Supplementary Figure 2). This approach can be employed as rapid and economical
method for diagnosis which does not require any RNA extraction step. Our results are in line
with the earlier reports of RNA extraction-free RT-PCR (Alcoba-Florez et al., 2020; Bruce et
al., 2020; Smyrlaki et al., 2020), but here we have done a very extensive (n=40) and thorough
standardization of this procedure which is now consistent and compelling.
One of the biggest challenges in diagnostics is overcoming the problem of falsenegatives, and SARS-CoV-2 is not an exception to this. Recent reports have shown that the
percentage of false negative reported for SARS-CoV-2 is between 20% and 40% with the onset
of symptoms and varies with respect to the phase of infection (Kucirka et al., 2020; Li et al.,
2020), which is alarming and calls for immediate improvements in the detection methodology.
To address this issue, we have combined the TE-extraction method with traditional method that
follows RNA-extraction. Here RNA was first isolated from TE buffer after extracting from the
dry swabs (described in methodology), followed by RT-PCR. We were pleasantly surprised
that almost one-third of the samples (6 of 19) which were consistently negative with traditional
VTM-based method and also direct-RT-PCR method turned out to be positive for SARS-CoV2. This observation was reproducible in multiple rounds of testing (Figure 1B, 2A). Upon a
further closer look at the overall data, it was intriguing to note that the samples which were
positive in the TE-based RNA extraction (and negative in other two methods) had a Ct value
for only one of the two gene (E gene and RdRP), therefore possibly hinting at the low viral
load which can be now picked by the new method. The increased detection limits are also
evident in the decreased Ct values (3 Ct units on an average) (Figure 2B). To rule out any
discrepancies in the sample processing we have used RNaseP as an internal control
(Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly as an indication of RNA amount and quality, the
RNaseP Ct values in case of TE-based approach had lower values compared to RNA isolated
from VTM, thereby proving the higher efficiency of the TE-based approach (Supplementary
Table 2). Therefore, the new hybrid method of TE-based sample extraction results in increasing
the overall efficiency by at least 20% (Figure 2A; Supplementary Table 1). These results

provide a remarkable improvement in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 patients with less viral
load and therefore provides better opportunity to manage the pandemic.

values for each sample obtained using different methods as labelled in the figure and the data points represents
the average of Ct values of E and RdRP genes. B) Bar graph representing the difference in Ct values between TEbased RNA isolation compared to that of traditional (VTM-based RNA isolation) method. Negative and positive
value indicates increased and reduced sensitivity, respectively, of the TE-based approach. The data points are
average of two independent technical replicates.

Based on the above results, we recommend a 2-tier screening method for SARS-CoV2 management. Since, TE buffer extracts can be used for direct RT-PCR without compromising
the sensitivity of detection, we strongly recommend that this be employed as a first line of
SARS-CoV-2 for large scale screening, while the TE buffer extract-based RNA could be
employed if the former method yields an ambiguous result. This method can probably be
expanded for screening other respiratory viral infections that are diagnosed using RT-PCR as
well. Finally, we also recommend sample collection using dry-swab approach which not only
eliminated the need of VTM, but also makes the sample handling, shipping and testing more
convenient and safer for the frontline healthcare workers and technicians.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection and transport:
The swab samples were collected from voluntary patients at Gandhi Medical College &
Hospital, Secunderabad, India. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each patient

and one was transported as dry swab and another in VTM respectively and the samples were
kept at 4° C till further processing.

Sample processing:
Complete sample processing was done in the BSL-3 facility of CSIR-CCMB by following
Standard Operating Procedures.
a) Resuspension/extraction of biological material from dry swabs:
The dry swabs were transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tubes containing 400 μl of TE
buffer [Tris pH-7.4 10 mM, EDTA 0.1 mM], The swabs were cut to make them fit into
the tubes and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to ensure the release of
biological material.
b) Heat Inactivation
50 µl of the sample was aliquoted from the VTM and TE buffer vials containing swabs
and heated at 98° C for 6 min on dry heat block. The inactivated samples were directly
used as a template for RT-PCR.

RNA isolation:
The RNA isolation from 3 ml VTM and TE-buffer (containing dry swab) was done by using
the QIAamp Viral RNA isolation kit by following the manufacturer protocol. In both cases,
150 μl of the sample was processed for RNA-extraction.

RT-PCR:
All the RT-PCR work carried out in a BSL-2 facility of CSIR-CCMB, Hyderabad, India.
Heat inactivated VTM, TE buffer extract, and RNA isolated from TE buffer extract and VTM
from respective samples were tested using the FDA approved LabGun COVID-19 detection
RT-PCR kit (LabGenomics Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea). The primer-probe targets E and
RdRP genes. The conditions for RT-PCR were followed according to the manufacturer
protocol. All the reactions were multiplexed and an amount of 4 µl of the template was used
per reaction. RT-PCR was performed in duplicates using LightCycler® 480 II (Roche Life
