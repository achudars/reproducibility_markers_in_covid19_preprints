Ipom-F as a potential antiviral agent
Abstract
In order to produce proteins essential for their propagation, many pathogenic
human viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 the causative agent of COVID-19
respiratory

disease,

commandeer

host

biosynthetic

machineries

and

mechanisms. Three major structural proteins, the spike, envelope and membrane
proteins, are amongst several SARS-CoV-2 components synthesised at the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected human cells prior to the assembly of new
viral particles. Hence, the inhibition of membrane protein synthesis at the ER is
an attractive strategy for reducing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other
obligate viral pathogens. Using an in vitro system, we demonstrate that the small
molecule inhibitor ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F) potently blocks the Sec61-mediated
ER membrane translocation/insertion of three therapeutic protein targets for
SARS-CoV-2 infection; the viral spike and ORF8 proteins together with
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the host cell plasma membrane receptor. Our
findings highlight the potential for using ER protein translocation inhibitors such
as Ipom-F as host-targeting, broad-spectrum, antiviral agents.

Ipom-F as a potential antiviral agent
Introduction
Many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) (Fig.
1A), hijack the host cell secretory pathway to correctly synthesise, fold and
assemble important viral proteins (Bojkova et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020; Sicari
et al., 2020). Hence, small molecule inhibitors of Sec61-mediated co-translational
protein entry into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Luesch and Paavilainen, 2020)
have potential as broad-spectrum antivirals (Heaton et al., 2016; Shah et al.,
2018). Such inhibitors offer a dual approach; first, by directly inhibiting production
of key viral proteins and, second, by reducing levels of host proteins co-opted
during viral infection. Hence, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is
an important host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry (Cantuti-Castelvetri et
al., 2020; Daly et al., 2020; Walls et al, 2020) synthesised at the ER prior to its
trafficking to the plasma membrane (Warner et al., 2005).
Our recent studies show that ipomoeassin-F (Ipom-F) (Fig. 1B) is a potent and
selective inhibitor of Sec61-mediated protein translocation at the ER membrane
(Zong et al., 2019; O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted). Given that SARS-CoV-2
membrane proteins likely co-opt host mechanisms of ER entry (cf. Gordon et al.,
2020; Sicari et al., 2020), we concluded that their sensitivity to Ipom-F would likely
be comparable to that of endogenous Sec61 clients (Fig. 1C; see also Zong et
al., 2019; O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted). We, therefore, evaluated the effects of
Ipom-F on SARS-CoV-2 proteins containing hydrophobic ER targeting signals
(Fig. 1D). The in vitro membrane insertion of the viral spike (S) protein and
membrane translocation of the ORF8 protein are both strongly inhibited by IpomF, whilst several other viral membrane proteins are unaffected (Fig. 2). Likewise,
the ER integration of ACE2, an important host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Walls
et al., 2020), is highly sensitive to Ipom-F (Fig. 2).
We show that the principle molecular basis for the Ipom-F sensitivity of SARSCoV-2 proteins is their dependence on Sec61, as dictated by their individual
structural features and membrane topologies (Fig. 3). Taken together, our in vitro
study of SARS-CoV-2 protein synthesis at the ER highlights Ipom-F as a
promising candidate for the development of a broad-spectrum, host-targeting,
antiviral agent.

Ipom-F as a potential antiviral agent

Results and Discussion
Ipom-F selectively inhibits ER translocation of the viral ORF8 and S proteins
To explore the ability of Ipom-F to inhibit the ER translocation of a small, yet
structurally diverse, panel of SARS-CoV-2 membrane and secretory-like proteins,
we first used a well-established in vitro translation system supplemented with
canine pancreatic microsomes (Fig. 2A). To facilitate the detection of ER
translocation, we modified the viral ORF8, S, E, M and ORF6 proteins by adding
an OPG2-tag; an epitope that supports efficient ER lumenal N-glycosylation and
enables product recovery via immunoprecipitation, without affecting Ipom-F
sensitivity (Fig. S1A) (O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted). For viral proteins that lack
endogenous sites for N-glycosylation, such as the E protein, the ER lumenal
OPG2-tag acts as a reporter for ER translocation and enables their recovery of
by immunoprecipitation. Where viral proteins already contain suitable sites for Nglycosylation (S and M proteins), the cytosolic OPG2-tag is used solely for
immunoprecipitation. The identity of the resulting N-glycosylated species for each
of these OPG2-tagged viral proteins was confirmed by endoglycosidase H (Endo
H) treatment of the radiolabelled products associated with the membrane fraction
prior to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, cf. lanes 1 and 2 in each panel).
Using ER lumenal modification of either endogenous N-glycosylation sites (viral
S and M proteins) or the appended OPG2-tag (viral E and ORF8 proteins) as a
reporter for ER membrane translocation, we found that 1 µM Ipom-F strongly
inhibited both the translocation of the soluble, secretory-like protein ORF8-OPG2
and the integration of the type I transmembrane proteins (TMP) S-OPG2, and
truncated derivatives thereof (Fig. 2B, Fig. 2C, Fig. S1C). Furthermore,
membrane insertion of the human type I TMP, ACE2, was inhibited to a similar
extent (Fig. 2B, Fig. 2C, ~70 to ~90% inhibition for these three proteins). These
results mirror previous findings showing that precursor proteins bearing Nterminal signal peptides, and which are therefore obligate clients for the Sec61translocon, are typically very sensitive to Ipom-F-mediated inhibition (Zong et al.,
2019; O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted). In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
wherein ACE2 acts as an important host cell receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus

Ipom-F as a potential antiviral agent
via its interaction with the viral S protein (Walls et al., 2020), these data suggest
that an Ipom-F-induced antiviral effect might be achieved via selective reductions
in the biogenesis of both host and viral proteins (cf. Fig. 1A).
In contrast to the viral S and ORF8 proteins, insertion of the viral E protein was
unaffected by Ipom-F (Fig. 2B-C), consistent with its recent classification as a
type III TMP (Duart et al., 2020). Type III TMP integration is highly resistant to
Ipom-F (Zong et al., 2019), most likely because they exploit a novel pathway for
ER insertion (cf. Fig. 3; O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted). We therefore conclude
that the known substrate-selective inhibitory action of Ipom-F at the Sec61
translocon is directly applicable to viral membrane proteins; whereby the ER
translocation of secretory proteins and type I TMPs, but not type III TMPs, is
efficiently blocked by Ipom-F.
The viral M protein is a multi-pass TMP with its first TMD oriented so the Nterminus is exoplasmic (Nexo) and hence can be considered “type III-like”.
Although human multi-pass TMPs of this type typically require both the ER
membrane complex (EMC) and Sec61 translocon for their authentic ER insertion
(Chitwood et al., 2018), Ipom-F had no significant effect on the ER
translocation/insertion of the M protein in vitro, as judged by the efficiency of Nglycosylation of its N-terminal domain (Fig. 2C). We conclude that the integration
of its first TMD is unaffected by Ipom-F, consistent with its use of the EMC
(Chitwood et al., 2018; O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted). There is however a
qualitative reduction in the intensity of both the non- and N-glycosylated forms of
the M protein when compared to the control (see Fig. 2B and Fig. S1A). We
speculate that this decrease may reflect an Ipom-F-induced effect on the Sec61dependent integration of the second and/or third TM-spans of the M protein (cf.
Chitwood et al., 2018) and our future studies will aim to resolve this question.
Nevertheless, like similar host cell multi-pass TMPs that are resistant to a similar
Sec61 inhibitor mycolactone (Morel et al., 2018), the M protein appears more
resistant to Ipom-F than either the S or ORF8 proteins (Fig 2, Fig. S1A). In
practice, the potential resistance of this highly abundant and functionally diverse
class of endogenous multi-spanning membrane proteins (von Heijne, 2007) may
limit any Ipom-F-induced cytotoxicity towards host cells.

Ipom-F as a potential antiviral agent
ORF6 assumes a lumenal-facing hairpin topology in ER-derived microsomes
Cell-based studies of the ORF6 protein from SARS-CoV-1 suggest it has an
unusual hairpin topology with both its N- and C-termini located on the exoplasmic
side of the host cell membrane, to which it binds via an N-terminal amphipathic
helix (Netland et al., 2007). To independently determine the membrane topology
of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6, we prepared versions with OPG2 tags at both its N- and
C-termini, or single tagged equivalents (see Fig. 2B, schematics, OPG2-ORF6OPG2, OPG2-ORF6 and ORF6-OPG2). Following membrane insertion, doubly
tagged OPG2-ORF6-OPG2 shows significant amounts of species with 3- and 4N-linked glycans (Fig. 2B). This pattern confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6
protein assumes a ‘hairpin’ conformation in the ER membrane with both its Nand C-termini in the lumen (Fig. 2B, OPG2-ORF6-OPG2). These 3- and 4-Nglycan bearing OPG2-ORF6-OPG2 species are also resistant to extraction with
alkaline sodium carbonate buffer (Fig. S1D) and protected from added protease
(Fig. S1E), further indicating that the majority of the ORF6 protein is stably
associated with the ER membrane in a ‘hairpin’ (Nexo/Cexo) topology.
Consistent with this unusual membrane topology, we find no indication that the
membrane insertion of any of our OPG2-tagged ORF6 variants is reduced by
Ipom-F, strongly suggesting that its association with the inner leaflet of the ER
membrane does not require protein translocation via the central channel of the
Sec61 translocon (Gérard et al., 2020; O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted). We noted
a sub-set of OPG2-ORF6-OPG2 species bearing only a single N-glycan was also
clearly present in the membrane-associated fraction with or without Ipom-F
treatment (Fig. 2B, OPG2-ORF6-OPG2, see 1Gly). Based on comparison to
singly OPG2-tagged variants (Fig. 2B), we conclude that OPG2-ORF6-OPG21Gly has its N-terminus in the ER lumen, where only one of its two consensus
sites is efficiently N-glycosylated (cf. Nilsson and von Heijne, 1993), whilst its Cterminus is either ER luminal but non-glycosylated or remains on the cytosolic
side of the membrane. In the latter case, it may be that, in addition to its hairpin
topology, some fraction of ORF6 may be integrated into ER-derived microsomes
as a type III TMP (cf. Fig. S2E; see also Netland et al., 2007) that is resistant to
Ipom-F inhibition (this study; Zong et al., 2019; O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted).

Ipom-F as a potential antiviral agent
The molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 protein sensitivity to Ipom-F
Having ascertained that Ipom-F inhibits the ER membrane translocation/insertion
of the viral ORF8 and S proteins, but not of the ORF6, E or M proteins (Fig. 2C),
we next investigated the molecular basis for this selectivity. For these studies we
employed semi-permeabilised (SP) mammalian cells, depleted of specific
membrane components via siRNA-mediated knockdown, as our source of ER
membrane (Fig. 3A; Wilson et al., 2007). Consistent with our recent work
(O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted), and based on the quantitative immunoblotting
of target and control gene products (Fig. S2A-C), we selectively depleted HeLa
cells for core components of the Sec61 translocon (Sec61α-kd, ~65% reduction),
the EMC (EMC5-kd, ~73% reduction) and both together (Sec61α+EMC5-kd,
~68% and ~78% reduction) prior to semi-permeabilisation with digitonin and use
for in vitro ER translocation assays.
Following the analysis of total OPG2-tagged translation products recovered by
immunoprecipitation, we found that: i) the S protein and a truncated derivative
were both more strongly affected by the depletion of Sec61α than of EMC5 (Fig.
3B, Fig. S2D); ii) the ORF8 protein was likewise strongly affected by Sec61α
depletion but also sensitive to EMC5 depletion (Fig. 3C); iii) the E protein showed
diminished insertion efficiency after knock-down of Sec61α and EMC5, although
the latter had a more pronounced effect (Fig. 3D). In each case, the combined
knockdown of Sec61α and EMC5 resulted in a reduction of membrane insertion
that was either comparable to, or greater than, that achieved following the knockdown of Sec61α alone (Figs. 3B to 3D). For the ORF6 protein, the total level of
N-glycosylated OPG2-ORF6-OPG2 species was unaffected by any knockdown
condition tested (Fig. 3E). However, we note a marked increase in the proportion
of potentially mis-inserted OPG2-ORF6-OPG2-1Gly species, particularly after
co-depletion of EMC5 and Sec61α (see Fig. 3E; Fig. S2E). We speculate that the
unusual hairpin topology of the ORF6 protein may be attributed to the EMC and
Sec61 complex acting in concert to provide an Ipom-F insensitive pathway for
protein translocation across the ER membrane (O’Keefe et al., 2020, submitted).
Perturbation of this pathway seemingly increases the potential for ORF6 to mis-

Ipom-F as a potential antiviral agent
insert (cf. Chitwood et al., 2018), perhaps as a consequence of disruption to the
translocation of its C-terminus (Fig. S2E).
Taken together, our data establish that, analogous to human membrane and
secretory proteins, the principal molecular basis for the Ipom-F-sensitivity of the
SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and S proteins is their dependence on Sec61-mediated
protein translocation into and across the ER membrane. In contrast, the E, M,
and ORF6 proteins appear capable of exploiting one or more alternative
membrane insertion/translocation pathways that can bypass the translocase
activity of the Sec61 complex. These alternatives most likely include a recently
described route for type III TMP insertion that requires the insertase function of
the EMC (O’Keefe et al., 2020 submitted), which our data suggest is also
sufficient to confer Ipom-F-resistance to the viral E protein and at least the first
TM-span of the viral M protein.
Concluding Remarks
We conclude, that Sec61-selective protein translocation inhibitors like Ipom-F
hold promise as broad-spectrum antivirals that may exert a therapeutic effect by
selectively inhibiting the ER translocation of viral and/or host proteins which are
crucial to viral infection and propagation (Mast et al., 2020). In the context of
SARS-CoV-2, integration of the viral S protein and its host cell receptor, ACE2,
into the ER membrane is significantly reduced by Ipom-F (Fig. 2C, 3B). Likewise,
translocation of the viral ORF8 protein across the ER membrane and into its
lumen is substantially diminished (Fig. 2C, 3C). The binding of the viral S protein
to cell surface ACE2 is a key step in host cell infection (Drew and Janes, 2020),
whilst ORF8 may protect SARS-CoV-2 infected cells against host cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (Zhang et al., 2020), making all three of these proteins viable
therapeutic targets (Drew and Janes, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020).
Like other small molecule inhibitors that target fundamental cellular pathways
(Bojkova et al. 2020), the broad-ranging effects of Sec61 inhibitors on host cell
membrane and secretory protein synthesis (Morel et al., 2018; Zong et al. 2019),
including the strong in vitro effect of Ipom-F on ACE2 biogenesis (cf. Grob et al.

Ipom-F is a potent inhibitor of Sec61-mediated protein translocation in cell culture
models (Zong et al., 2019), and appears well tolerated in mice (Zong et al., 2020),
we propose that future studies investigating its effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection
and propagation in cellular models are clearly warranted (cf. Bojkova et al. 2020).

Materials and Methods
Ipom-F and Antibodies
Ipom-F was synthesised as previously described (Zong et al., in press).
Antibodies used to validate Sec61 and/or EMC subunit depletions in SP cells
(Fig. S2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (goat polyclonal antiLMNB1 (clone M-20, sc-6217), Bethyl Laboratories (rabbit polyclonal anti-EMC5
(A305-832-A)), Abcam (rabbit polyclonal anti-EMC6, (ab84902)), gifted by Sven
Lang and Richard Zimmermann (University of Saarland, Homburg, Germany,
rabbit anti-Sec61α) or as previously described (mouse monoclonal anti-OPG2
tag (McKenna et al., 2016) and rabbit polyclonal anti-OST48 (Wilson et al., 2007).
DNA constructs
The cDNA for human ACE2 (Uniprot: Q9BYF1) was purchased from Sino
Biological (HG10108-M). cDNAs encoding the SARS-CoV-2 genes for ORF6,
ORF8 and the E M and S proteins (Uniprot: P0DTC6, P0DTC8, P0DTC4,
P0DTC5, P0DTC2 respectively) were kindly provided by Nevan Krogan (UCSF,
US) (Gordon et al. 2020), amplified by PCR, subcloned into the pcDNA5 vector
and constructs validated by DNA sequencing (GATC, Eurofins Genomics).
ORF6-OPG2, ORF8-OPG2, M-OPG2 and S-OPG2 were generated by inserting
the respective cDNAs in frame between NheI and AflII sites of a pcDNA5/FRT/V5His

vector

(Invitrogen)

containing

a

C-terminal

OPG2

tag

(MNGTEGPNFYVPFSNKTG). OPG2-E was generated by cloning the cDNA
encoding the E-protein into the same pcDNA5-OPG2 vector using the KpnI and
BamHI sites and deleting the stop codon after the OPG2 tag by site-directed
mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange, Agilent Technologies). The N-terminal
OPG2-tag of OPG2-ORF6-OPG2 was inserted by site-directed mutagenesis of
ORF6-OPG2 using the relevant forward and reverse primers (Integrated DNA
Technologies). Linear DNA templates were generated by PCR and mRNA
transcribed using T7 polymerase.
siRNA-mediated knockdown and SP cell preparation
HeLa cells (human epithelial cervix carcinoma cells) were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified
incubator at 37°C. Knockdown of target genes were performed as previously

reactions were finished by incubating with 0.1 mM puromycin for 10 min at 30°C

Recovery and analysis of radiolabelled products
Following puromycin treatment, microsomal membrane-associated fractions

confirm the topology of ORF6 (Fig. S2), the membrane-associated fraction of the
doubly-OPG2-tagged form (OPG2-ORF6-OPG2) was resuspended in KHM
buffer (20 μL) and subjected to either carbonate extraction (0.1 M Na2CO3, pH

at 4°C to recover both the membrane-associated and non-targeted nascent
chains. Samples were next incubated under constant agitation with 10% (v/v)
Protein-A-Sepharose beads (Genscript) for a further 2 h at 4°C before recovery
by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 1 min. Protein-A-Sepharose beads were washed
twice with Triton immunoprecipitation buffer prior to suspension in SDS sample
buffer. Where indicated, samples were treated with 1000 U of a form of
Endoglycosidase H that does not co-migrate with and hence potentially distort
the radiolabelled products when resolved: Endoglycosidase Hf (translation
products of ~10-50 kDa; New England Biolabs, P0703S) or Endoglycosidase H
(translation products of ~50-150 kDa protein substrates; New England Biolabs,
P0702S). All samples were solubilised for 12 h at 37°C and then sonicated prior
to resolution by SDS-PAGE (10% or 16% PAGE, 120V, 120-180 min). Gels were

fixed for 5 min (20% MeOH, 10% AcOH), dried for 2 h at 65°C and radiolabelled
products visualised using a Typhoon FLA-700 (GE Healthcare) following
exposure to a phosphorimaging plate for 24-72 h.
Western Blotting
Following semi-permeabilisation, aliquots of siRNA-treated HeLa cells were
suspended in SDS sample buffer, denatured for 12 h at 37°C and sonicated prior
to resolution by SDS-PAGE (16% or 10% PAGE, 120V, 120-150 min). Following
transfer to a PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (0.06 M Tris, 0.60 M glycine, 20%
MeOH) at 300 mA for 2.5 h, PVDF membranes were incubated in 1X Casein
blocking buffer (10X stock from Sigma-Aldrich, B6429) made up in TBS,
incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (1:500 or 1:1000 dilution) and
processed for fluorescence-based detection as described by LI-COR Biosciences
using appropriate secondary antibodies (IRDye 680RD Donkey anti-Goat, IRDye
680RD Donkey anti-Rabbit, IRDye 800CW Donkey anti-Mouse) at 1:10,000
dilution. Signals were visualised using an Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR
Biosciences).
Quantitation and Statistical Analysis
Bar graphs depict either the efficiency of membrane translocation/insertion
calculated as the ratio of N-glycosylated protein relative to the amount of non-Nglycosylated protein (Fig. 2-3), or the efficiencies of siRNA-mediated knockdown
in SP cells calculated as a proportion of the protein content when compared to
the NT control (Fig. S2), with all control samples set to 100%. Normalised values
were used for statistical comparison (one-way or two-way ANOVA; DF and F
values are shown in each figure as appropriate and the multiple comparisons test
used are indicated in the appropriate figure legend). Statistical significance is
given as n.s., non-significant >0.1; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P
< 0.0001.

(A) The effects of transfecting HeLa cells with non-targeting (NT; lane 1), Sec61 targeting (lane 2), EMC5-targeting (lane 3) and Sec61 +EMC5-targeting (lane 4)
siRNAs were determined after semi-permeabilisation by immunoblotting for target
genes (Sec61 , EMC5). Controls to assess destabilisation of the wider EMC complex
(EMC2 and EMC6), any effect on the N-glycosylation machinery (the ER-resident 48
kDa subunit of the oligosaccharyl-transferase complex (OST48) and the quantity of
SP cells used in each experiment (the nuclear protein Lamin-B1 (LMNB1)), are also
shown. (B) The efficiencies of siRNA-mediated knockdown (bold) were calculated as
a proportion of the signal intensity obtained with the NT control (set as 100%).

truncated variant of the S protein (S-half-OPG2) was synthesised in rabbit reticulocyte
lysate supplemented with SP cells with impaired Sec61 complex and/or EMC function
and recovered by immunoprecipitation via the OPG2 tag. Radiolabelled products
resolved by SDS-PAGE and analysed by phosphorimaging. N-glycosylated (14-Gly)
versus non-N-glycosylated (0Gly) species were identified by treatment with
endoglycosidase H (Endo H, lane 1). (E) Further analysis of the data presented in Fig.
3E of the main text. Here, the ratio of 3Gly and 4Gly bearing OPG2-ORF6-OPG2 Nglycosylated species relative to the 1Gly species present in the same sample was
used as a proxy to estimate potential mis-insertion of the ORF6 protein in SP cells with
impaired Sec61 complex and/or EMC function relative to the NT control (set to 100%
efficiency). Quantitations are given as mean±s.e.m for independent translation
reactions from separate siRNA treatments performed in triplicate (n=3) and statistical
significance (two-way ANOVA, DF and F values shown in the figure) was determined
