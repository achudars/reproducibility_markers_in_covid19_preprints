ABSTRACT

26

Eliciting antibodies to surface-exposed viral glycoproteins can lead to protective responses that

27

ultimately control and prevent future infections. Targeting functionally conserved epitopes may

28

help reduce the likelihood of viral escape and aid in preventing the spread of related viruses with

29

pandemic potential. One such functionally conserved viral epitope is the site to which a receptor

30

must bind to facilitate viral entry. Here, we leveraged rational immunogen design strategies to

31

focus humoral responses to the receptor binding motif (RBM) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Using

32

glycan engineering and epitope scaffolding, we find an improved targeting of the serum response

33

to the RBM in context of SARS-CoV-2 spike imprinting. Furthermore, we observed a robust

34

SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing serum response with increased potency against related sarbecoviruses,

35

SARS-CoV and WIV1-CoV. Thus, RBM focusing is a promising strategy to elicit breadth across

36

emerging sarbecoviruses and represents an adaptable design approach for targeting conserved

37

epitopes on other viral glycoproteins.

MAIN TEXT

42

Humoral responses elicited by vaccination or infection predominantly target surface-exposed viral

43

glycoproteins. These responses can often provide protection against future infections to the same

44

or closely related viral variants. However, in some instances, such as influenza and HIV, the

45

elicited responses are often poorly protective as they target variable epitopes (1, 2). Furthermore,

46

waning of responses (i.e., durability), as is the case for common cold-causing coronaviruses,

47

results in susceptibility to reinfections (3-6). For SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2) it remains unclear

48

whether current vaccines will confer long-term protection. Furthermore, it is increasingly apparent

49

that humoral immunity elicited by vaccination or natural infection may provide reduced protection

50

against emerging SARS- 2 variants (7-9). Thus, implementing rational design strategies aimed at

51

directing the immune response to conserved viral epitopes may help reduce the likelihood of viral

52

escape and lead to more broadly protective responses (10, 11).

53
54

Two immunogen design strategies used to direct humoral responses include “masking” epitopes

55

via engineering putative N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGs) and the design of protein scaffolds

56

to present broadly protective epitopes (12, 13); these strategies have been used previously for viral

57

glycoproteins RSV F, influenza hemagglutinin and HIV envelope (14-16). Applying these

58

approaches to the SARS-2 spike provides an opportunity to potentially improve serum

59

neutralization potency, efficacy against variants, and cross-reactivity of antibody responses. A

60

potential target of these efforts is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding

61

motif (RBM) of the receptor binding domain (RBD) (17, 18). Indeed, several potently neutralizing

62

RBM-directed antibodies that interfere with ACE2 binding are protective and some can also

63

neutralize related sarbecoviruses (10, 11, 18-20). Here, we show that hyperglycosylation of the

64

RBD and a “resurfacing” approach that grafts the RBM from SARS-2 onto heterologous

65

coronavirus RBDs focuses serum responses to the RBM. This immune-focused response is

66

potently neutralizing with breadth across SARS-2 variants and other coronaviruses.

67
68

The RBM of SARS-2 and related sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV (SARS-1) and WIV1-CoV (WIV1),

69

is a contiguous sequence spanning residues 437-507 (SARS-2 numbering) of the spike protein. In

70

an effort to elicit RBM-specific responses only, we first asked whether the RBM itself could be

71

recombinantly expressed in absence of the rest of the RBD (Fig. 1A). While the SARS-2 RBM

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.15.435440; this version posted March 16, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

72

could indeed be overexpressed, it failed to both engage the conformation-specific RBM-directed

73

antibody B38 and bind to cell-surface expressed ACE2 (Fig. S1). These results likely suggest that

74

the RBM is conformationally flexible, and that the RBD serves as a structural “scaffold” to

75

stabilize the RBM in its binding-compatible conformation. To circumvent the considerable hurdle

76

of de novo scaffold design for RBM presentation, we asked whether heterologous sarbecovirus

77

RBDs from SARS-1 and WIV1 and the more distantly related merbecovirus MERS-CoV (MERS)

78

could serve as scaffolds (Fig. 1A) —variations of this approach were used previously to modulate

79

ACE2 binding properties (21, 22). In context of immunizations, we hypothesized that these

80

heterologous RBDs would present the SARS-2 RBM while removing any other SARS-2-specific

81

epitopes. The SARS-1, WIV-1 and MERS RBDs share a pairwise amino acid identity with SARS-

82

2 of 73.0%, 75.4% and 19.5%, respectively. The RBM is less conserved despite have a shared

83

ACE2 receptor for SARS-1 and WIV1 with only 49.3% and 52.1% identity, respectively; as MERS

84

uses DPP4 as a receptor, its RBM shares no notable identity (23). While we were unable to

85

“resurface” MERS RBD with the SARS-2 RBM, the related SARS-1 and WIV-1 RBDs

86

successfully accepted the RBM transfer. These resurfaced constructs, rsSARS-1 and rsWIV-1

87

retained binding to the SARS-2 RBM-specific B38 antibody as well as effectively engaged ACE2

88

(Fig. S2) (19). These data suggest that there are sequence and structural constraints within the

89

RBD required for successful RBM grafting; such an approach may be facilitated by using CoV

90

RBDs that use the same receptor for viral entry.

91
92

We next used these resurfaced RBDs as templates for further modification using glycan

93

engineering. This approach aimed to mask conserved, cross-reactive epitopes shared between the

94

SARS-1, SARS-2, and WIV1 RBDs. There are two evolutionarily conserved PNGs at positions

95

331 and 343; SARS-1 and WIV1 have an additional conserved PNG at position 370 (SARS-2

96

numbering). To further increase overall surface glycan density, we introduced novel PNGs onto

97

wildtype SARS-2 as well as rsSARS-1 and rsWIV1 RBDs. Based on structural modeling, we

98

identified 5 potential sites on rsSARS-1 and rsWIV1 as well as 6 on SARS-2. Including the native

99

PNGs, all constructs had a total of 8 glycans (Fig. 1B-D, S3)— we denote these hyperglycosylated

100

(hg) constructs as SARS-2hg, rsSARS-1hg, and rsWIV1hg. We expressed these constructs in

101

mammalian cells to ensure complex glycosylation in order to maximize any glycan “shielding”

102

effect. We subsequently characterized these constructs using the RBM-directed antibody B38, as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.15.435440; this version posted March 16, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

103

well as ACE2 binding, to ensure that the engineered PNGs did not adversely affect the RBM

104

conformation. Overall, the hyperglycosylated constructs were largely comparable in affinity for

105

B38, with only ~2-fold decrease, and still effectively engaged ACE2 (Fig. S4). These results

106

confirm a conformational and functionally intact RBM.

107
108

Next, we assessed whether the engineered PNGs abrogated binding to sarbecovirus cross-reactive

109

antibodies S309 and CR3022—both antibodies were isolated from SARS-1 convalescent

110

individuals (24, 25). The CR3022 contact residues on SARS-1 and WIV1 differ only at a single

111

residue while SARS-2 differs at 5 residues across both CR3022 and S309 epitopes (26).

112

Importantly, these epitopic regions were shown to be a significant portion of the SARS-2 RBD-

113

directed response in murine immunizations and thus any RBM focusing would require masking of

114

these regions (Fig. S4) (24, 25, 27). While SARS-2hg effectively abrogated S309 and CR3022

115

binding, the engineered PNGs at the antibody:antigen interface on rsSARS-1hg and rsWIV1hg did

116

not completely abrogate S309 and CR3022 binding. We therefore incorporated unique mutations

117

on rsSARS-1hg and rsWIV1hg so that any elicited antibodies would be less likely to cross-react

118

between these two constructs. To that end, we found K378A and the engineered glycan at residue

119

383 (SARS-2 numbering) completely abrogated CR3022 binding in both rsSARS-1hg and

120

rsWIV1hg (Fig. S4). For S309, mutations P337D in rsSARS-1hg and G339W in rsWIV1hg in

121

addition to glycans at residues 441 and 354 (SARS-2 numbering) were sufficient to disrupt binding

122

(Fig. S4). We made two additional mutations, G381R, M430K on rsSARS-1hg and K386A, T430R

123

on rsWIV1hg, to further increase the antigenic distance between these scaffolds (Fig. 1C, D).

124
125

We then tested the immunogenicity and antigenicity of our optimized constructs and assessed their

126

RBM immune-focusing properties, in the murine model. In order to increase avidity and to

127

minimize any off-target tag-specific responses, we generated trimeric versions of each immunogen

128

using our previously characterized hyperglycosylated, cysteine-stabilized GCN4 tag (hgGCN4cys)

129

(27, 28). We first primed all cohorts with SARS-2 spike to reflect pre-existing SARS-2 immunity

130

and to imprint an initial RBM response that may be recalled and selectively expanded by our

131

immunogens. To test potential RBM immune-focusing, one cohort was sequentially immunized

132

with SARS-2hg trimers (“Trimerhg cohort”) and a second cohort was immunized with SARS-2hg

133

trimers followed by a cocktail of rsSARS-1hg and rsWIV1hg (“Cocktailhg cohort”) (Fig. 2A). In

134

order to facilitate comparisons and establish the efficacy of RBM-focusing, we included a “DRBM

135

cohort”. This cohort was immunized with a modified SARS-2 RBD (DRBM) with four novel

136

glycans engineered at positions 448, 475, 496, and 501 within the RBM. These PNGs effectively

137

abrogate RBM-directed B38 antibody binding and engagement of ACE2 (27) and should restrict

138

elicited humoral response to this epitope. Finally, as a control cohort, we included a SARS-2 spike

139

prime followed with sequential immunizations with wildtype (i.e., unmodified) SARS-2 RBD

140

trimer (“Trimer cohort”).

141
142

Overall, we find that all cohorts elicit robust serum responses to wildtype SARS-2 RBD (Fig. 2B-

143

C, S5). In order to specifically evaluate the RBM-directed responses, we compared serum ELISA

144

titers to wildtype SARS-2 RBD and the SARS-2 DRBM RBD construct. We find that the Trimerhg

145

and Cocktailhg cohorts had a significant increase in serum titers to wildtype SARS-2 RBD relative

146

to SARS-2 DRBM RBD; this was in contrast to the DRBM and Trimer cohorts (Fig. 2B,C, S5A,B).

147

Across the Trimerhg and Cocktailhg cohorts, the median binding loss to the SARS-2 DRBM RBD

148

relative to wildtype SARS-2 RBD was 82%, indicating that ~82% of serum antibodies are RBM-

149

directed by this metric. The Cocktailhg cohort had a slight increase in RBM focusing relative to the

150

Trimerhg cohort which received two SARS-2hg boosts. This observed increase may be due to

151

increasing the overall antigenic distance (i.e., sequence difference) between the WIV1 and SARS-

152

1 RBDs relative to SARS-2 while maintaining the identical SARS-2 RBM epitope. Additionally,

153

we find that the Trimerhg and Cocktailhg cohorts had significantly lower titers to SARS-1 and WIV1

154

RBDs as compared to SARS-2 RBD (Fig. 2B). This difference was most pronounced in the

155

Cocktailhg cohort, suggesting that the hyperglycosylation and engineered mutations within the

156

RBD effectively dampened responses to these conserved, cross-reactive epitopes that are present

157

outside the RBM and shared between SARS-1, WIV1, and SARS-2. Furthermore, serum titers

158

against the rsSARS-1 and rsWIV1 RBDs were comparable to SARS-2 RBD, indicating that there

159

is minimal antibody response directed towards wildtype SARS-1 and WIV1 RBD epitopes in

160

comparison to the SARS-2 RBM (Fig. 2D, S5C). We observed no significant glycan-dependent

161

serum response in either cohort that used hyperglycosylation (Fig. S6). Collectively, these data

162

confirm an enhanced SARS-2 RBM-focused serum response elicited by our engineered

163

immunogens.

165

We next compared the neutralization potency of all cohorts using SARS-1, SARS-2, and WIV1

166

pseudoviruses (29, 30). While all cohorts elicited a potent SARS-2 neutralizing response, notably,

167

the Trimerhg and Cocktailhg cohorts also exhibited potent SARS-1 and WIV1 pseudovirus

168

neutralization relative to the control cohorts (Fig. 3A, S7, S5B). This is particularly noteworthy

169

for the Trimerhg cohort as it did not include SARS-1 or WIV1 RBDs in the immunization regimen.

170

WIV1 in this instance is broadly representative of possible future emerging sarbecoviruses with

171

pandemic potential (31). To further epitope map the RBM-focused responses, we performed

172

ELISA-based antibody competition using cross-reactive antibodies CR3022, S309, ADI-55689,

173

and ADI-56046 and WIV1 RBD (Fig. 3B-C). The latter two antibodies bind a conserved

174

sarbecovirus RBM epitope also targeted by the antibody ADG-2, which is currently in clinical

175

development (10, 11). Competition ELISAs suggest that the cross reactive WIV1-directed

176

responses in the Trimerhg and Cocktailhg cohorts focus to the ADG-2-like epitope, as well as to the

177

CR3022 and S309 epitopes in the Cocktailhg cohort (Fig. 3B-C). Thus, SARS-2hg, rsSARS-1hg,

178

and rsWIV1hg RBDs can induce not only potent SARS-2 neutralizing antibodies, but also cross-

179

reactive antibodies that bind to a conserved RBM epitope (Fig. S8). Notably, these results are in

180

contrast to our previous work showing that a cocktail of sarbecovirus that included SARS-1 and

181

WIV1 RBDs could predominantly focus the antibody response towards the conserved CR3022

182

and S309 epitopic regions (27).

183
184

Many SARS-2 variants of concern include mutations within the RBM including B.1.1.7, B.1.351

185

and P.1 first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil, respectively (Fig. 4A). We

186

therefore asked what the consequence was of enhanced focusing to the RBM and whether the

187

elicited responses elicited were sensitive to these mutations. Interestingly, serum from the Trimerhg

188

and Cocktailhg cohorts showed no significant loss of binding to the B.1.351 RBD compared to the

189

wildtype SARS-2 RBD (Fig. 4A, B). This is in contrast to the control Trimer cohort, which showed

190

a significant loss of binding and parallels the observation of reduced serum binding from human

191

subjects immunized with current SARS-2 vaccines (9, 32, 33). Second, we tested all sera for

192

neutralization against SARS-2 variant pseudoviruses: B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. While the control

193

Trimer cohort could still neutralize P.1 and B.1.1.7 pseudoviruses, there was a significant loss of

194

neutralization to the B.1.351 variant, consistent with our ELISA data. In contrast, we find no

195

significant loss of neutralization against these variants in the Trimerhg, Cocktailhg, and DRBM

196

cohorts (Fig. 4C). For DRBM cohort, the elicited responses were likely focused to neutralizing

197

epitopes within the RBD (e.g., CR3022, S309) and therefore were not sensitive to these RBM

198

mutations. However, the neutralizing response observed in Trimerhg and Cocktailhg cohorts

199

potentially indicate that immune-focusing to the RBM may allow for greater recognition (i.e.,

200

accommodation) of mutations compared to the RBM-directed antibody response elicited via

201

infection or vaccination (32, 34).

202
203

Collectively, our results demonstrate immunogen design approaches that can be leveraged to

204

enhance an RBM-focused humoral response. It is a strategy that maintains protective SARS-2

205

neutralization while also eliciting humoral responses that recognize emerging variants and

206

coronaviruses with pandemic potential. Importantly, these design strategies are not limited to

207

coronaviruses and are adaptable to other viruses as a general approach to elicit protective responses

208

to conserved epitopes.

p < 0.01; ns = not significant). (C) Day 56 serum was assayed against SARS-2 variant

274

pseudoviruses for neutralization. Statistical significance was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis

275

test with post-hoc analysis using Dunn’s test corrected for multiple comparisons (* = p < 0.05).

276

Lower limit of detection for each cohort is shown with a dotted line, and y-axis values were

277

selected accordingly. Pseudovirus neutralization for WT SARS-2 was also performed with the

278

~102 limit of detection for the DRBM, Trimerhg, and Cocktailhg cohorts (Fig. S7), but NT50 values

279

at the limit of detection were adjusted to match the lower limit of detection (~101) for the variant

280

pseudoviruses to facilitate fair comparison.

METHODS

283
284

Immunogen and Coating Protein Expression and Purification

285

The SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank MN975262.1), SARS-CoV (Genbank ABD72970.1), WIV1-CoV

286

(Genbank AGZ48828.1) RBDs were used as the basis for constructing these immunogens. To graft

287

the SARS-2 RBM onto SARS-1 and WIV1 scaffolds to create the rsSARS-1 and rsWIV1

288

monomers, boundaries of SARS-2 residues 437 – 507 were used. All constructs were codon

289

optimized by Integrated DNA Technologies and purchased as gblocks. Gblocks were then cloned

290

into pVRC and sequence confirmed via Genewiz. Monomeric constructs for serum ELISA coating

291

contained C-terminal HRV 3C-cleavable 8xHis and SBP tags. Trimeric constructs also included

292

C-terminal HRV 3C-cleavable 8xHis tags, in addition to a previously published hyperglycosylated

293

GCN4 tag with two engineered C-terminal cystines (27, 28). Dr. Jason McLellan at the University

294

of Texas, Austin provided the spike plasmid, which contained a non-cleavable foldon trimerization

295

domain in addition to C-terminal HRV 3C cleavable 6xHis and 2xStrep II tags. The SARS-2

296

DRBM RBD construct was generated as previously described with four additional engineered

297

putative N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 448, 475, 496, and 501 (27).

298
299

Expi 293F cells (ThermoFisher) were used to express proteins. Transfections were performed with

300

Expifectamine reagents per the manufacturer’s protocol. After 5-7 days, transfections were

301

harvested and centrifuged for clarification. Cobalt-TALON resin (Takara) was used to perform

302

immobilized metal affinity chromatography via the 8xHis tag. Proteins were eluted using

303

imidazole, concentrated, and passed over a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare)

304

size exclusion column. Size exclusion chromatography was performed in PBS (Corning). For

305

immunogens, HRV 3C protease (ThermoScientific) cleavage of affinity tags was performed prior

306

to immunization. Cobalt-TALON resin was used for a repurification to remove the His-tagged

307

HRV 3C protease, cleaved tag, and remaining uncleaved protein.

308
309

Fab and IgG Expression and Purification

310

The variable heavy and light chain genes for each antibody were codon optimized by Integrated

311

DNA Technologies, purchased as gblocks, and cloned into pVRC constructs which already

312

contained the appropriate constant domains as previously described (35, 36). The Fab heavy chain

313

vector contained a HRV 3C-cleavable 8xHis tag, and the IgG heavy chain vector contained HRV

314

3C-cleavable 8xHis and SBP tags. The same transfection and purification protocol as used for the

315

immunogens and coating proteins was used for the Fabs and IgGs.

316
317

Biolayer Interferometry

318

Biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments were performed using a BLItz instrument (Fortebio)

319

with FAB2G biosensors (Fortebio). All proteins were diluted in PBS. Fabs were immobilized to

320

the biosensors, and coronavirus proteins were used as the analytes. To determine binding affinities,

321

single-hit measurements were performed starting at 10 µM to calculate an approximate KD in order

322

to evaluate which concentrations should be used for subsequent titrations. Measurements at a

323

minimum of three additional concentrations were performed. Vendor-supplied software was used

324

to generate a final KD estimate via a global fit model with a 1:1 binding isotherm.

325
326

Immunizations

327

All immunizations were performed using female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) aged 6-10

328

weeks. Mice received 20 µg of protein adjuvanted with 50% w/v Sigma adjuvant in 100 µL of

329

inoculum via the intraperitoneal route. Following an initial prime (day 0), boosts occurred at days

330

21 and 42. Serum samples were collected for characterization on day 56 from all cohorts, in

331

addition to day 35 for the HG Trimer and HG Cocktail cohorts. All experiments were conducted

332

with institutional IACUC approval (MGH protocol 2014N000252).

333
334

Serum ELISAs

335

Serum ELISAs were executed using 96-well, clear, flat-bottom, high bind microplates (Corning).

336

These plates were coated with 100 µL of protein, which were adjusted to a concentration of 5

337

µg/mL (in PBS). Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. After incubation, plates had their coating

338

solution removed and were blocked using 1% BSA in PBS with 1% Tween. This was done for 60

339

minutes at room temperature. This blocking solution was removed, and sera was diluted 40-fold

340

in PBS. A 5-fold serial dilution was then performed. CR3022 IgG, similarly serially diluted (5-

341

fold) from a 5 µg/mL starting concentration, was used as a positive control. 40 µL of primary

342

antibody solution was used per well. Following this, samples were incubated for 90 minutes at

343

room temperature. Plates were washed three times using PBS-Tween. 150 µL of HRP-conjugated

344

rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody, sourced commercially from Abcam (at a 1:20,000 dilution in

345

PBS), was used for the secondary incubation. Secondary incubation was performed for one hour,

346

similarly at room temperature. Plates were subsequently washed three times using PBS-Tween.

347

1xABTS development solution (ThermoFisher) was used according to the manufacturer’s

348

protocol. Development was abrogated after 30 minutes using a 1% SDS solution, and plates were

349

read using a SectraMaxiD3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) for absorbance at 405 nm.

350
351

Competition ELISAs

352

A similar protocol to the serum ELISAs was used for the competition ELISAs. For the primary

353

incubation, 40 µL of the relevant IgG at 1 µM was used at room temperature for 60 minutes. Mouse

354

sera were then spiked in such that the final concentration of sera fell within the linear range for the

355

serum ELISA titration curve for the respective coating antigen, and an additional 60 minutes of

356

room temperature incubation occurred. After removing the primary solution, plates were washed

357

three times with PBS-Tween. Secondary incubation consisted of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse

358

IgG, human/bovine/horse SP ads antibody (Southern Biotech) at a concentration of 1:4000. The

359

remaining ELISA procedure (secondary incubation, washing, developing) occurred as described

360

for the serum ELISAs.

361
362

ACE2 Cell Binding Assay

363

ACE2 expressing 293T cells (37) (a kind gift from Nir Hacohen and Michael Farzan) were

364

harvested. A wash was performed using PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. 200,000 cells were

365

allocated to each labelling condition. Primary incubation occurred using 100 µL of 1 µM antigen

366

in PBS on ice for 60 minutes. Two washes were performed with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS.

367

Secondary incubation was performed using 50 µL of 1:200 streptavidin-PE (Invitrogen) on ice for

368

30 mins. Two washes were performed with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS, and then cells were

369

resuspended in 100 µL of PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. A Stratedigm S1000Exi Flow

370

Cytometer was used to perform flow cytometry. FlowJo (version 10) was used to analyze FCS

371

files.

372
373

Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.15.435440; this version posted March 16, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

374

Serum neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and WIV1-CoV was assayed using

375

pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing spike proteins described previously (29). Transient

376

transfection of 293T cells was used to generate lentiviral particles. Viral supernatant titers were

377

measured using flow cytometry of 293T-ACE2 cells (37) and utilizing the HIV-1 p24CA antigen

378

capture assay (Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.). 384-well plates (Grenier) were used to perform

379

assays on a Tecan Fluent Automated Workstation. For mouse sera, samples underwent primary

380

dilutions of 1:3 or 1:9 followed by serial 3-fold dilutions. 20 µL each of sera and pseudovirus (125

381

infectious units) were loaded into each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room

382

temperature. Following incubation, 10,000 293T-ACE2 cells (37) in 20 µL of media containing

383

15 µg/mL polybrene was introduced to each well. The plates were then further incubated at 37°C

384

for 60-72 hours.

385
386

Cells were lysed using assay buffers described previously (38). Luciferase expression was

387

quantified using a Spectramax L luminometer (Molecular Devices). Neutralization percentage for

388

each concentration of serum was calculated by deducting background luminescence from cells-

389

only sample wells and subsequently dividing by the luminescence of wells containing both virus

390

and cells. Nonlinear regressions were fitted to the data using GraphPad Prism (version 9), allowing

391

IC50 values to be calculated via the interpolated 50% inhibitory concentration. IC50 values were

392

calculated with a neutralization values greater than or equal to 80% at maximum serum

393

concentration for each sample. NT50 values were then calculated using the reciprocal of IC50

394

values. Serum neutralization potency values were calculated by dividing the NT50 against a

395

particular pseudovirus by the endpoint titer against the respective RBD. For samples with NT50

396

values below the limit of detection, the lowest limit of detection across all neutralization assays

397

was used as the NT50 value to calculate neutralization potency. This prevents a higher limit of

398

detection from skewing neutralization potency results. Endpoint titers were normalized relative to

399

a CR3022 IgG control, which was run in every serum ELISA.

400
401

In comparing NT50 values for the various cohorts across the wildtype and variant pseudoviruses,

402

the lowest limit of detection across all neutralization assays performed for a given cohort was used

403

for any NT50 values that fell below the limit of detection. This prevents a higher limit of detection

404

in some assays from skewing the comparison results.

406

Statistical Analysis

407

Curve fitting and statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 9). Non-

408

parametric statistics were used throughout. To compare multiple populations, the Kruskal-Wallis

409

non-parametric ANOVA was used with post hoc analysis using Dunn’s test for multiple

410

comparisons. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare two populations without

411

consideration for paired samples. The ratio-paired t-test was used to compare two populations with

412

consideration for paired samples and evidence of normality. P values in ANOVA analyses were

413

corrected for multiple comparisons. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.
