SUMMARY
Adoptive cell therapy with viral-specific T cells has been successfully used to treat lifethreatening viral infections, supporting the application of this approach against COVID19. We expanded SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from the peripheral blood of COVID-19-recovered
donors and non-exposed controls using different culture conditions. We observed that the
choice of cytokines modulates the expansion, phenotype and hierarchy of antigenic
recognition by SARS-CoV-2 T-cells. Culture with IL-2/4/7 but not other cytokine-driven
conditions resulted in >1000 fold expansion in SARS-CoV-2 T-cells with a retained
phenotype, function and hierarchy of antigenic recognition when compared to baseline
(pre-expansion) samples. Expanded CTLs were directed against structural SARS-CoV-2
proteins, including the receptor-binding domain of Spike. SARS-CoV-2 T-cells could not
be efficiently expanded from the peripheral blood of non-exposed controls. Since
corticosteroids are used for the management of severe COVID-19, we developed an
efficient strategy to inactivate the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) in SARS-CoV-2
CTLs using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.

INTRODUCTION
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in
2019, marks the third and most devastating large-scale epidemic of coronavirus infection
(known as COVID-19) in recent times. A number of potential treatment options against
SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation, including the use of convalescent plasma,
remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon-beta(Beigel et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020;
Casadevall and Pirofski, 2020; Hung et al., 2020; NCT04315948, 2020). So far, none
appear to be curative, making it critical to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by profound T-lymphopenia associated with a
dysregulated/excessive innate response, thought to be the underlying mechanism for
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the major cause of morbidity and mortality
with this virus (Fathi and Rezaei, 2020; Mehta et al., 2020). Recent studies from patients
with COVID-19 point to an important role for T cell adaptive immunity in protection and
clearance of the virus (Braun et al., 2020), with T cell responses documented against the
structural SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)
(Grifoni et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020; Thieme et al., 2020). Indeed, in
preclinical models of SARS-CoV-1 infection, adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells
(VSTs) was shown to be curative in infected mice, supporting the use of adoptive cell
therapy (ACT) in coronavirus-related infection. ACT with allogeneic cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs) has been successfully used to treat other severe viral infections,
such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, BK virus, Epstein-Barr virus and human
herpes virus 6 in immunosuppressed patients, with responses ranging from 60-100%
(Haque et al., 2007; Muftuoglu et al., 2018; O’Reilly et al., 2016; Tzannou et al., 2017).
Thus, ACT may be an attractive approach for the management of COVID-19-related
disease. However, many patients with severe COVID-19 receive corticosteroids which,
due to their lymphocytotoxic effects, limit the efficacy of ACT. Here, we describe a novel
approach for the generation of highly functional and steroid-resistant SARS-CoV-2
reactive T cells for the immunotherapy of patients with COVID-19.

RESULTS
Expansion of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells from COVID-19-recovered donors
Our group has previously reported the feasibility of generating VSTs from the peripheral
blood (PB) of healthy donors for ACT (Muftuoglu et al., 2018). Here, we utilized this
approach to derive and expand SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells. Briefly, PBMCs from 10
CoV19-RD were cultured with 11 different peptide libraries (15mers overlapping by 11
amino acids) spanning the entire sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including both
the structural (S, M, N, E) and non-structural proteins (AP3A, Y14, NS6, NS7a, NS7B,
NS8, ORF9B and ORF10) in the presence of either IL-2/4/7, IL-2/7/15, IL-2/4/21 or IL2/7/21 for 14 days. At the end of the culture period, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells were
enumerated based on their ability to produce IFN-g in response to ex vivo stimulation with
the viral antigens. When cultured in the presence of IL-2/4/7 or IL-2/7/15, expansion was
successful in 8/10 cases, with a median fold expansion of 719.14 (range 7.16 – 45572.50)
and 1138.41 (range 15.97 – 27716.61), respectively. However, expansion using IL-2/4/21
or IL-2/7/21 was suboptimal, with a median fold expansion of only 0.71 (range 0.08 996.18) and 2.72 (range 0.85 – 415.98), respectively (Figure 1A, Tables 1, S2 and S3).
IL-2/4/7 and IL-2/7/15 culture conditions supported expansion of both CD4+ and CD8+
SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells with a predominance of CD4+ T-cells, while expansion with
IL-2/4/21 and IL-2/7/21 failed to result in significant expansion of either SARS-CoV-2
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (Figure 1B).
SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells generated from CoV-RD are polyfunctional
We next interrogated the functional phenotype of the ex vivo expanded SARS-CoV-2
CTLs. Since IL-2/4/7 and IL-2/7/15 resulted in the best cell expansion, we focused our
analysis on SARS-CoV-2 CTLs generated using these two conditions. Both culture
conditions supported expansion of effector memory (EM) and central memory (CM) T
cells although the use of IL-2/7/15 resulted in expansion of CM T cells (Figure 1C).
Previous studies in patients with severe COVID-19 have reported the presence of T cells
with an exhausted phenotype and reduced polyfunctionality (Chen et al., 2020; Zheng et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.298547; this version posted September 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

al., 2020a, 2020b). Thus, we performed a comprehensive single cell analysis of expanded
SARS-CoV-2 CTLs from 8 recovered donors using mass cytometry. Phenotypic
interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells expanded with IL-2/4/7 or IL-2/7/15
(identified based on their ability to produce IFN-g in response to ex vivo stimulation with
a mixture of S, M and N peptide libraries) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 specific CTLs are
polyfunctional based on their ability to secrete multiple cytokines and chemokines
simultaneously, including IFN-g, TNF-a and MIP-1b (cluster 32; Figure 1D and 1E).
Moreover, ex vivo expanded SARS-CoV-2 CTLs did not express high levels of
inhibitory/checkpoint molecules thus, arguing against an exhausted phenotype (cluster
32; Figure 1F). Indeed, analysis of functional markers revealed a cytotoxic Th1
phenotype, characterized by expression of IFN-g, TNF-a, CD107a and granzyme B (GrB),
indicating direct antiviral killing capacity (Figure 1F). Interestingly, they did not produce
significant amounts of IL-2 in response to antigenic stimulation. Single cell phenotypic
comparison of SARS-CoV-2 CTLs expanded using the two different culture conditions did
not reveal major differences in the expression patterns of activation and functional
markers between these two groups (Figure 1F). However, cells expanded in the
presence of IL-2/4/7 expressed lower levels of some exhaustion markers such as TIM3
and LAG3 compared to cells expanded with IL-2/7/15 (Figure 1G). Taken together, these
data support the notion that polyfunctional, non-exhausted T cells capable of reacting
against SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be expanded from the PB of CoV-RDs.
We also performed a multiplex analysis to measure cytokines in supernatants collected
from cultures of SARS-CoV-2 CTLs with SARS-CoV-2 antigens (n= 4 for each of the
culture conditions- IL-2/4/7 and IL-2/7/15). As expected, the expanded SARS-CoV-2
CTLs released effector cytokines such as IFN-g, TNF-a, MIP-1β in response to antigenic
stimulation; of note, they did not produce cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1a, or IL-10 that could
contribute to a higher risk of toxicity or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (Figure S1).

Expanded SARS-CoV-2 CTLs from CoV-RD are directed against structural proteins,
including both the C and N terminals of the S protein

In order to identify the dominant antigen(s) driving expansion of SARS-CoV-2 CTLs, the
expanded cells were stimulated ex vivo with peptide libraries derived from either M, N, S
or E (structural proteins) or AP3A, Y14, NS6 NS7a, NS7B, NS8, ORF9B or ORF10 (nonstructural proteins). Analysis of IFN-γ production showed that for the lines expanded with
IL-2/4/7, the overall T-cell response was mostly directed against S (median 10.60%,
range 0.21 –14.8%), with the remaining cells responding to M (median 4.27%, range
0.11– 33.6%) or N (median 4.98%, range 0.12 –17.10%) (Figure 2A). For the lines
expanded with IL-2/7/15, the CD3+ T-cell response favored M (median 6.05%, range 0.15
– 20.80%) followed by S (median 4.47%, range 0.48 – 26.00%) and N (median 3.60 %,
range 0.17-15.50%) (Figure 2A). In sum, for both IL-2/4/7 and IL-2/7/15 culture settings,
seven lines were directed against M + N + S, one line was directed against S + N, and no
line reacted to M and N in the absence of S. There was no significant expansion of CTLs
in response to the non-structural proteins or the structural E protein.
When we considered the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses separately, we found that the
response of CD4+ T cells to individual SARS-CoV-2 antigens followed a pattern similar
to that observed in the overall CD3+ T cell population. Interestingly, however, CD8+ T
cell responses were mostly directed against the N protein, irrespective of the cytokine
cocktail used for SARS-CoV-2 CTL expansion (Figure 2B, Table 1).
Peptides derived from the C-terminus of the S protein have higher homology with the S
glycoprotein of human endemic "common cold" coronaviruses; in contrast, the N-terminus
of the S protein includes peptides from the receptor-binding domain (the target of
neutralizing antibodies) that are more specific to SARS-CoV-2 (Braun et al., 2020; Walls
et al., 2020). Our expanded CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-2 CTLs were capable of reacting
to both N- and C-terminal epitopes (Pools 1 and 2 of the S protein respectively), indicating
their specificity for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2C,
Tables 2, S4 and S5).
Culture with IL-2/4/7 results in preferential expansion of T cells against the Nterminus of the S protein

Since the choice of cytokines used to expand SARS-CoV-2 T-cells modulates the
hierarchy of antigenic response, we compared the T cell response against S (S1 and S2),
M and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in PB samples at baseline (prior to expansion) with that
observed in paired expanded CTLs from Cov-RDs.
At baseline (pre-expansion), the responses were mostly CD4 dominant (Figure 3A), and
directed against the S protein (median 0.21%, range 0.02%-0.56%), followed by N
(median 0.15%, range 0.01-0.33%) and M (median 0.11%, range 0.01-0.24%) (Figure
3B), indicating an immunogenic dominance for S protein HLA class II epitopes. We did
not detect measurable responses against non-structural proteins (data not shown).
Following expansion, culture with IL-2/4/7 maintained the hierarchy of CD4+ T cell
response toward S protein, (Figures 2B, 3C, and 3D), with a greater proportion of T cells
directed against S1, while culture with IL-2/7/15 favored a response toward M protein
(Figures 2B, 3C, and 3D). Expansion with IL-2/4/21 and IL-2/7/21 yielded very low
numbers of CTLs, most of which were CD4+. Interestingly, the pattern of antigenic
response for cells cultured using these two conditions differed from that observed for IL2/4/7 and was similar to IL-2/7/15, in that the majority of CD4+ CTLs reacted instead to
M and N proteins (Figures S2A). For CTLs that did show a response to S protein, further
analysis detected no particular pattern of reactivity to either terminus of the protein
(Figure S2B).
Furthermore, we found a significant correlation (p=0.002, R2=0.82) between the spike
protein IgG antibody titer measured in plasma from the recovered donors and the
absolute number of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells following expansion with IL-2/4/7, but
not with the IL-2/7/15 cytokine cocktail (Figure S3).
These data indicate that the antigenic skewing can be driven both by the
immunodominance of the protein and by the culture conditions and support the use of IL2/4/7 for the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 T-cells for clinical use.

SARS-CoV-2 T-cells can be expanded from the PB of healthy donors but at lower
frequencies than for Cov-RD donors
Recent reports indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 T cells in the PB of healthy donors
(HD) not exposed to COVID-19 (Braun et al., 2020; Pia, 2020). Thus, we asked if SARSCoV-2 T-cells can be expanded from the PB of HD and whether they have a similar
pattern of SARS-CoV-2 recognition as those generated from Cov-RDs. PBMC from 5
HDs were expanded using the same protocol as for Cov-RDs. We achieved only a modest
expansion of CTLs recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigens over a 14-day culture period, with
a median 20.37-fold increase (range, 2.85 – 41.84) for IL-2/4/7 culture condition and
21.49-fold increase (range, 4.00 – 53.95) for IL-2/7/15 culture condition (Figure 4A). The
frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 CTLs from the PB of healthy donors after 14 days of culture
were significantly lower than those achieved with PB from Cov-RDs (Figure 4B). At
baseline (pre-expansion), assessment of IFN-γ production and CTL frequencies
suggested that in healthy donors responses were directed mostly against the N protein
(median 0.13%, range 0.03%-0.37%), followed by S (median 0.10%, range 0.04-0.12%)
and M (median 0.09%, range 0.01-0.75%) (Figure S4A). Culture in the presence of either
cytokine cocktail could skew the response towards S, albeit at much lower frequencies
than that observed with Cov-RDs (Figure S4B, Tables S6 and S7). We did not find any
particular pattern of antigenic response in the CD4 and CD8 compartments (Figure S4B,
Tables S6 and S7). Expansion was not successful in IL-2/4/21 or IL-2/7/21 stimulation
conditions.
Expanded SARS-CoV-2 T cells can be genetically modified to render them steroidresistant
Corticosteroids are used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19-related ARDS to
reduce mortality associated with this condition. SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell therapy is not
an option in such patients as corticosteroids induce apoptosis of adoptively transferred T
cells, thus, significantly limiting the efficacy of this approach. To address this challenge,
we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knockout the glucocorticoid receptor gene
(Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1 [NR3C1]) in SARS-CoV-2 CTLs and
confirmed high efficiency of deletion (>90%) as determined by PCR and western blot

analysis (Figures 5A and 5B). Annexin V apoptosis assay confirmed that the viability of
NR3C1 KO CTLs treated with dexamethasone was similar to that of control CTLs (defined
as CTLs electroporated with Cas9 alone) (Figures 5C and 5D). Moreover, NR3C1 KO
SARS-CoV-2 CTLs maintained similar phenotype and distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T
cell subsets when compared to control SARS-CoV-2 CTLs and retained their effector
functions (Figures 5E- 5G).

DISCUSSION
Here we show that large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 T-cells can be generated from buffy
coats of convalescent patients with specificity directed against multiple structural proteins
of this virus, including the RBD of the S protein. These cells can be genetically modified
to render them resistant to the lymphocytotoxic effect of corticosteroids, thus, making their
application clinically feasible.
We performed single cell analysis of the ex vivo expanded SARS-CoV-2 CTLs to better
understand their phenotypic and functional properties. SARS-CoV-2 T-cells were
classified based on their state of differentiation into naïve, central memory, effector
memory or terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA). SARS-CoV-2 T-cells
comprised mostly of effector and central memory T cells. This phenotype predicts for the
capacity to persist and provide long-term immunity after adoptive transfer (Powell et al.,
2005). We also investigated their functional state based on their ability to produce one or
more cytokines in response to ex vivo stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
Polyfunctionality is defined as the production of multiple cytokines by T cells and is
associated with protective immune responses to viruses and vaccines (Minton, 2014). We
confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 T-cells were polyfunctional and predominantly of Th1
phenotype.
T cells derived from patients with severe COVID-19 have been reported to express
multiple inhibitory molecules (Song et al., 2020), raising concerns that following ex vivo
expansion, they may have an exhausted phenotype with poor effector function and
replicative senescence. In our study, T cells from COVID-19-recovered individuals did not
have an exhaustion phenotypic signature following in vitro expansion, and retained their
functional phenotype. This observation is consistent with reversal of exhausted
phenotype upon antigen clearance, a phenomenon also reported in other virus infection
settings (Wieland et al., 2017).

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are directed against the RBD within the N-terminal
of the S glycoprotein. Peptides derived from this region of the protein are believed to be
specific to SARS-CoV-2, while peptides from the C terminus are shared with other betacoronaviruses (Braun et al., 2020). We showed that expanded SARS-CoV-2 T-cells from
CoV-RD were capable of recognizing epitopes from both the N- and C-terminus of the S
glycoprotein, indicating specificity for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, expanded CTLs
reacted against N and M proteins, which are reportedly also shared among different betacoronaviruses (Patrick et al., 2006). The specific antigens that drive an effective and
protective T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known. They may be proteins
that are shared with other beta-coronaviruses, or they may be unique to SARS-CoV-2
(e.g. RBD) or may likely be a combination of both.
Cytokines can modulate the phenotype of T cells by activating different signaling
pathways. We tested different cytokine cocktails to identify the optimal conditions for
promoting the expansion of SARS-CoV-2 T-cells with a memory phenotype and without
evidence of exhaustion. Since both CD4 and CD8 T cells are involved in successful
antiviral response, we also investigated whether cytokines would support expansion of
both subsets. We observed that cocktails including IL-2/4/7 or IL-2/7/15 resulted in
expansion of clinically relevant doses of polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 T-cells with a central
and effector memory phenotype. Interestingly, the combination of IL-2/4/7 preferentially
supported expansion of T cells against S and in particular the RBD-containing S1 region
of the protein, making this the cytokine cocktail of choice for the production of SARS-CoV2 T-cells for clinical use. Of note, the inclusion of IL-21 in the cytokine cocktail resulted in
poor expansion of SARS-CoV-2 T-cells, as previously observed in other memory T cell
expansion studies (Li et al., 2005).
CRS is a major complication of COVID-19 (Moore and June, 2020) and is caused by the
production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 by virus-infected myeloid cells. The
inflammatory milieu overstimulates cells of the innate and adaptive immune system that
in turn contribute to the observed cytokine storm (Kang et al., 2019). Therefore, a
legitimate concern with our approach is that the adoptively infused SARS-CoV-2 T-cells

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.298547; this version posted September 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

could amplify CRS and worsen the patient’s condition. However, we believe that ACT for
COVID-19 is unlikely to worsen CRS as the adoptively infused CTLs will target and kill
the SARS-CoV-2 infected myeloid cells, thus breaking the vicious cycle driving the
cytokine storm. Furthermore, CRS is not unique to beta-coronavirus infections and has
been reported with other viral infections such as CMV, EBV and adenovirus (Humar et
al., 1999; McLaughlin et al., 2018; Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) where adoptive cell therapy
with virus-specific CTLs has been used to treat hundreds of patients with severe
infections effectively and with minimal complications (Bollard and Heslop, 2016;
McLaughlin et al., 2018; Muftuoglu et al., 2018; Tzannou et al., 2017).

Our approach allows for cryopreservation and banking of SARS-CoV-2 T-cells, facilitating
the rapid identification and selection of viral-specific T-cells for ACT based on the most
closely HLA-matched third-party donor as published by our group and others for other
severe viral infections (Eiz-Vesper et al., 2012; Haque et al., 2007; Leen et al., 2011;
Muftuoglu et al., 2018; O’Reilly et al., 2016). An additional advantage to our approach is
that the genetic modification of SARS-CoV-2 T-cells to delete the glucocorticoid receptor
will allow treatment of patients with ARDS on high doses corticosteroids.
In summary, adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-2 T-cells may be a suitable therapeutic
strategy for treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. We intend to initiate a clinical
study at MD Anderson Cancer Center to test this approach in patients in the near future.

Figure 1. Successful expansion of SARS-CoV-2 T cells from COVID-19 recovered
donors. A, Bar graph showing the log 10 fold expansion of SARS-CoV-2 T cells cultured
with different cytokine cocktails, IL-2/4/7 (blue), IL-2/7/15 (red), IL-2/4/21 (green) and IL2/7/21 (purple). B, Bar graphs showing the log 10 fold expansion of the CD4+ (blue) and
CD8+ (red) subsets of SARS-CoV-2 T cells cultured under the different cytokine
stimulation conditions. C, Quantification of EM (CD45RO+ CD45RA- CD62L-, left panel),
CM (CD45RO+ CD45RA- CD62+, middle panel) and EMRA (CD45RO- CD45RA+
CD62L-, right panel) in SARS-CoV-2 T cells expanded with IL-2/4/7 (blue) or IL-2/7/15
(red) (n=8 samples per group); bars represent median values with interquartile range. pvalues are indicated at the top of each graph. D, Mass cytometry analysis of T cells (gated
on CD45+CD3+) expanded from 8 recovered donors using combination of M, N and S
peptide libraries and cytokine cocktails (IL-2/4/7 and IL-27/15 conditions are overlapped
in this phenograph). tSNE map shows the 32 clusters obtained, each highlighted in
corresponding color. Cluster 32 (circled) represents the polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 T
cells. E, Individual tSNE maps show the expression of IFN-γ, TNF-a and MIP-1β mostly
restricted to cluster 32. Expression levels are indicated by color scale, ranging from blue
representing low expression to red representing high expression. F, Cluster identity and
frequency are summarized in heatmaps showing marker expression levels (X axis) for T
cell populations (Y axis) expanded with the two different cytokine cocktails IL-2/4/7 (left
heatmap) or IL-2/7/15 (right heatmap). Markers associated with function, phenotype,
activation or exhaustion are indicated below each heatmap. Expression level is indicated
by color scale, ranging from low (blue) to high (red). Cluster 32 is indicated with a black
rectangle. G, Violin plots comparing expression of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, PD-1, and CTLA4 and between the two cytokine stimulation conditions IL-2/4/7 (blue) and IL-2/7/15 (red),
n = 8. p-values are indicated at the top of each graph.

Figure 5. Expanded SARS-CoV-2 CTLs can be genetically modified to become
steroid resistant. A,B NR3C1 KO efficiency shown by PCR gel electrophoresis (A) and
by western blot (B) in SARS-CoV-2 CTLs expanded with IL-2/4/7 or IL-2/7/15, after
electroporation with Cas9 alone (Cas9) or Cas9 complexed with crRNA 1 and crRNA 2
targeting exon 2 of the NR3C1 gene. SARS-CoV-2 CTLs electroporated with Cas9 alone
were used as controls. β-actin was used as loading control for western blot. C,
Representative FACS plots showing the percentage of apoptotic cells (Annexin V+) and
live or dead cells (live/dead stain) in control Cas9 vs NR3C1 KO SARS-CoV-2 CTLs after
culture with or without dexamethasone (Dexa; 200 μM) for 72 hours. Inset values indicate
the percentage of annexin V and alive/dead cells from each group. D, Bar graph
summarizing the percentage of live cells between control Cas9 and NR3C1 KO SARSCoV-2 CTLs treated with or without 200 μM dexamethasone for 72 hours (n = 3). Bars
represent median values with interquartile range. p-values are indicated above the
graphs. E, Representative FACs plots showing the distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
(upper panel) and phenotype based on CD62L and CD45RA expression (lower panel) in
Cas9 alone or NR3C1 KO SARS-CoV-2 CTLs with or without 200 μM dexamethasone.
F, Percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within SARS-CoV-2 CTLs treated with control
Cas9 (blue), NR3C1 KO (red), or NR3C1 KO plus dexamethasone (Dexa; 200μM; green).
G, Frequency of SARS-CoV-2 CTLs producing IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2 control Cas9 (blue),
NR3C1 KO (red), or NR3C1 KO plus dexamethasone (Dexa; 200μM; green) in response
to 6 hours of stimulation with viral PepMix (n = 3). The functional analysis of the Cas9 +
Dexa group was not performed due to the absence of viable cells resulting from the
lymphocytotoxic effect of steroids. The bars represent mean values with SD. NS, not
significant.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
COVID-19 recovered donors and healthy donors
Buffy coat units were processed from 500mL of whole blood collected from each of the
10 COVID-19 recovered donors (CoV-RD) and 20 mL of peripheral blood from 5 healthy
donors were collected under local Institutional Review Board approved protocols (Lab020630 and PA13-0647) and following informed consent. All donors were 18 years or older
and were recruited without consideration of disease severity, race, ethnicity or gender. All
CoV-RD had recovered from proven symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by a positive test
for SARS-CoV-2. At the time of blood collection, all were asymptomatic for at least 14
days and had a negative PCR test, confirming full recovery.
Blood from Cov-RD was collected in heparin-coated blood bags and stored at room
temperature prior to processing for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation.

freezing media containing 10% DMSO (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% heat inactivated
Human Serum AB (Gemini Bio) and stored in liquid nitrogen until used for phenotypic and
functional assays.
Functional assessment of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells
For intracellular assessment of cytokine production, cells were stimulated ex vivo with
15mer pepMixes overlapping by 11 amino acids derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
(peptide pool 1 or 2), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), or the non-structural
proteins (AP3A, Y14, NS6, NS7a, NS7B, NS8,ORF9B and ORF10) (JPT, Germany) [1µg
/ml per peptide] for 4 hours. Stimulation with an equimolar amount of DMSO was
performed as negative control and with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)Ionomycin (1.25ng/ul and 0.05ng/μl, respectively) as positive control. Brefeldin A
(Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added into the culture for 4 hours. Cells were stained
with an antibody cocktail containing live/dead viability dye Aqua (Invitrogen), CD3 APC
Cy7 (Biolegend, Clone HIT3A), CD4 APC (E Biosciences, Clone SK3), CD8 PerCP Cy5.5
(Biolegend, Clone SK1), CD95 BV785 (Biolegend, Clone DX2), CD45RO BV650 (BD
Biosciences, Clone UCHL1), CD45RA PECy7 (Biolegend, Clone HI100), CD27 BV711
(Biolegend, Clone O323), CCR7 FITC (BD Biosciences, Clone 150503) and CD62L
BV605 (Biolegend, Clone DREG56) for 30 minutes on ice, then fixed and permeabilized
using the BD fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were subsequently stained with antibodies against IL-2 PE
(BD Biosciences, Clone MQ1-17H12), IFN-g BV450 (BD Biosciences, Clone B27), and
TNF-a AF700 (Biolegend, Clone MAB11) for 30 mins. Following a final wash, cells were
re-suspended in FACS buffer and data were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa (BD
Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using Flowjo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). The
gates applied for the identification of IFN-g, IL-2, and TNF-a on the total population of
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were defined according to the negative control for each
individual. Similar functional assays were performed for NR3C1 knockout (KO) CTLs.

IgM and IgG responses against nucleocapsid, S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD), S1S2,
S2, S1, OC43, HKU1, NL63 Nucleoprotein, and 229E Spike derived from SARS-CoV-2
and other human coronaviruses were performed at Genalyte (Austin, TX) CLIA-certified
laboratory using plasma from convalescent patients.

Cytokine and chemokine measurement
Cells were stimulated ex vivo with 15mer pepMixes from S, M and N for 24 hours at 37oC
and 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected and assayed with the Milliplex® MAP Human
Cytokine/Chemokine panel (EMD Millipore Corporation, Burlington, MA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Generation of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells
Isolated PBMC from CoV-RD and HD were pulsed with a SARS-CoV-2 pepMix (JPT,
Germany) comprising the entire length of the structural (S, M, N, E) and non-structural
(AP3A, Y14, NS6, NS7a, NS7B, NS8, ORF9B and ORF10) proteins at a concentration of
1 µg/ml per peptide. Cells were cultured in complete media with 5% human AB serum
and supplemented with four different cytokine cocktails: IL-2 (50 IU/ml), IL-4 (60 ng/ml)
and IL-7 (10 ng/ml) vs. IL-2 (50 IU/ml), IL-7 (10 ng/ml) and IL-15 (10 ng/ml) vs. IL-2 (50
IU/ml), IL-4 (60 ng/ml) and IL-21 (30 ng/ml) vs. IL-2 (50 IU/ml), IL-7 (10 ng/ml) and IL-21
(30 ng/ml) every 3 days. After 14 days of expansion, the frequencies of SARS-CoV-2
specific T-cells were determined by intracellular cytokine staining.
Mass Cytometry
A panel of 40 metal-tagged antibodies was used for the in-depth characterization of
SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells (Table S1). All unlabeled antibodies were purchased in
carrier-free form (Fluidigm) and conjugated in-house with the corresponding metal tag
using Maxpar X8 polymer per the manufacturer’s instructions (Fluidigm) and as previously
described (Muftuoglu et al., 2018). Briefly, thawed PBMCs were rested overnight at 37oC
/ 5% CO2 and stained with a freshly prepared antibody mix against cell surface markers
for 30 minutes at room temperature on a shaker (100 rpm). For the last 3 minutes of

incubation, cells were incubated with 2.5 µM cisplatin (Pt198, Fluidigm) for viability
assessment, washed twice with cell staining buffer and fixed/permeabilized using BD
fixation/permeabilization solution for 30 minutes in dark at 4oC. Cells were washed twice
with perm/wash buffer, stained with antibodies directed against intracellular markers and
after an additional wash step, stored overnight in 500 µl of 1.6% paraformaldehyde (EMD
Biosciences)/PBS with 125 nM iridium nucleic acid intercalator (Fluidigm). Samples were
supplemented with EQ calibration beads (Fluidigm) and acquired at 300 events/second
on a Helios instrument (Fluidigm) using the Helios 6.5.358 acquisition software (Fluidigm).
Mass cytometry data were normalized based on EQTM four element signal shift over time
using Fluidigm normalization software 2. Initial data processing was performed using
Flowjo version 10.2. Calibration beads were gated out and singlets were chosen based
on iridium 193 staining and event length. Dead cells were excluded by the Pt198 channel
and manual gating was performed to select the CD45+CD3+ population which was
subsequently exported for downstream analyses. A total of 156,384 cells were evenly
sampled from 16 samples derived from 8 patients to perform automated clustering
analysis. The data were processed using the R package cytofkit (v1.11.3). Expression
values for each marker were arcsine transformed with a cofactor of 5. Data dimensionality
reduction was performed using the R package Rtsne (v0.15) for t-Distributed Neighbor
Embedding (tSNE) analysis. The R package Rphenograph (v0.99.1) was used to cluster
all cells into 32 clusters. Both the R package Rstne (v0.15) and the R package
Rphenograph (v0.99.1) were implemented in the R package cytofkit (v1.11.3). The t-SNE
plots were generated using the R package ggplot2 (v3.3.2). Normalized mean values of
marker expressions in each cluster were plotted as heatmap using the function
“pheatmap” from R package pheatmap (v1.0.12). Min-max normalization was used to
scale each marker’s mean expressions range to [0,1]. The normalized mean values of
marker expressions were plotted as box plots using the function “ggpaired” from R
package ggpubr (v0.4.0). The mean comparison p-values of Wilcoxon signed-rank test
were added to the plots using the function “stat_compare_means” from R package ggpubr
(v0.4.0).

CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of the glucocorticoid receptor
Knockout (KO) of NR3C1 (the glucocorticoid receptor gene) was performed on day 7 of
T cell expansion using ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. We used two crRNAs targeting
exon 2 of the human NR3C1 gene: crRNA #1 TGAGAAGCGACAGCCAGTGA, crRNA#2
GGCCAGACTGGCACCAACGG as previously described.(Basar et al., 2020) Briefly,
Cas9 protein (IDT) and gRNA (crRNA + tracrRNA combination) were complexed and
electroporated into 1 million SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells using the Neon transfection
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Annexin V apoptosis assay
Annexin V apoptosis assay was performed to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone on
the viability of CTLs from Cas9 control and NR3C1 KO groups. CTLs from both groups
were treated with 200 µM dexamethasone (Sigma) for 72 hours. Cells were then
collected, washed with annexin V buffer, and stained with annexin V (V500; BD
Biosciences) and live/dead viability dye (efluor 660; Invitrogen) in addition to CD3 APC
Cy7 (Biolegend, Clone HIT3A), CD4 APC (E Biosciences, Clone SK3), and CD8 PerCP
Cy5.5 (Biolegend, Clone SK1). The proportion of apoptotic (positive for annexin V) and
dead CTLs (positive for live/dead stain) was determined by flow cytometry.
PCR gel electrophoresis
DNA was extracted and purified (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit; Qiagen Inc) from SARSCoV-2 specific T cells (control and NR3C1 KO conditions). We used the Platinum SuperFi
Green PCR Master Mix from Invitrogen for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
using the following PCR primers spanning the Cas9–single-guide RNA cleavage site of
exon 2 of the GR gene: exon 2 forward primer, GGACTCCAAAGAATCATTAACTCC
TGG; exon 2 reverse primer, AATTACCCCAGGGGTGCAGA. DNA bands were
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis prepared with SYBR-safe DNA gel stain in 0.5×
Tris/Borate/EDTA. Gel images were obtained using GeneSys software in a G:BOX gel

To detect GR protein expression, CTLs were lysed in lysis buffer (IP Lysis Buffer; Pierce
Biotechnology Inc) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free
Cocktail tablets; Roche Holding) and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Protein
concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce
Biotechnology Inc). The following primary antibodies were used: GR (clone D6H2L) XP
rabbit monoclonal antibody and β-actin antibody (clone 8H10D10); both antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Blots were imaged using a G:BOX gel
documentation system and GeneSys software (Syngene).
