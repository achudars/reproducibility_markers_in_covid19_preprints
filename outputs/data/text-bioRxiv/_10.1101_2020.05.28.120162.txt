SUMMARY
Recently emerged beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the current pandemic
designated COVID-19. COVID-19 manifests as severe illness exhibiting systemic
inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
thrombotic events, and shock, exacerbated further by co-morbidities and age1–3. Recent
clinical reports suggested that the pulmonary failure seen in COVID-19 may not be solely
driven by acute ARDS, but also microvascular thrombotic events, likely driven by
complement activation4,5. However, it is not fully understood how the SARS-CoV-2
infection mechanisms mediate thrombotic events, and whether such mechanisms and
responses are unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other respiratory infections.
We address these questions here, in the context of normal lung epithelia, in vitro and in
vivo, using publicly available data. Our results indicate that plasmin is a crucial mediator
which primes interactions between complement and platelet-activating systems in lung
epithelia upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a potential for therapeutic intervention.

MAIN
Recent studies6,7 have rapidly provided molecular insights into the pathogenicity of the SARSCoV-2, mainly at the level of genomic, structural, and functional aspects of viral-host
interactions. Further, studies have identified key pathophysiological and molecular events
associated with infection pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19 including
thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, eosinophilia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and
fibrinogen 8,9. The molecular findings have included a delayed interferon (IFN) response type I
and III10,11 with a concomitant increase of proinflammatory cytokines (namely IL-17, IL-6

and/or IL-1B)12 leading to a “cytokine” storm coupled with the depletion of markers for platelets,
natural killer cells, and dysregulation of CD4+ and B-cell lymphocyte populations 13. In contrast
to other respiratory viral infections (e.g., ref14–17), SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in cells
of various tissues that express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and host serine protease
(TMPRSS2)18,19, thus contributing to the increased transmissibility and lower-lung pathogenicity
in humans 20. This observation led us to explore mechanisms which are unique to SARS-CoV-2
infection of lung epithelial cells and cause thrombotic events.
In this study, we utilized publicly available RNA-sequencing data, GSE10045710, in Normal
Human Bronchial Epithelial (NHBE) cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 (henceforth referred
to as the CoV-2 dataset). In particular, we compared the CoV-2 dataset with lung epithelial cells
infected with other respiratory infections, namely, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza
(H1N1), and rhinovirus (RV16) (see Methods)), using a stringent study inclusion criterion.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were called for each infection (with respect to their
respective controls) using limma/voom, at an adjusted p-value<0.05 (see Methods). We
identified a total of 339, 27, 1781 and 208 DEGs in CoV-2, RSV, H1N1 and RV16 datasets,
respectively, with a more significant proportion of genes upregulated, in all cases, in response to
infection (Supplementary Table 1). Our analysis indicated a significant over-representation of
functional categories associated with immune response, across all infections (among upregulated
genes) (Figure 1). The categories included, “response to virus”, “TNFα signaling via NFkB”,
“interferon response” (types I/α, II/γ) and “apoptosis”. However, “coagulation” and
“keratinocyte differentiation pathways” were among the top pathways to be uniquely enriched
within the CoV-2 dataset. Genes including MMP9, ANXA1, C1S, C3, CFB, F3, ITGB3, MAFF,
MMP1, MMP9, PDGFB, PLAT, PLAU, SERPINB2, TFPI2 associated with “coagulation” and

S100A7, ANXA1, TGM1, IVL, and small proline-rich proteins SPRR2A, SPRR2E, SPRR2D,
associated with the “keratinocyte differentiation pathway” were among the 161 genes that were
“uniquely” significantly upregulated within the CoV-2 dataset (Figure S1).
We posed the question if analyzing the molecular cascades associated uniquely with SARS-CoV2, identified above, could translate to findings that are relevant to thrombotic outcomes seen in
severe/acute COVID-19 patients2. In order to relate the clinical and molecular phenotypes
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we generated a protein interaction map (strength >0.85)
from DEGs identified within the CoV-2 dataset (see Methods) and annotated it with data from
the comparative analysis for the three other infections (RSV, RV16 and H1N1). We
subsequently clustered this network, to identify “functional modules” relevant to the pathology
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our clustering identified nine modules with five smaller functional
modules containing genes associated uniquely with SARS-CoV-2, involving angiogenesis,
tubulins, keratinocytes, and small proline-rich proteins (Figure 2). Three of the four remaining
modules were mainly associated with immune response. These functional modules included (i)
genes associated with response to IFN type I/III such as IFITM1, IFITM3, MX1, MX2, OAS1,
OAS2, IFIT1, IFIT3, and IRF9; (ii) Activation of the IL-17 pro-inflammatory cascades (IL6,
IL1B, and CXCL1) via the TNFα and NFkB signaling cascades (TNF, CSF2, CSF3, NFKB1,
NFKB2, RELB, and IRAK2) (iii) Signaling cascades downstream of interleukin response
including JAK-STAT containing genes such as IL6R, STAT1, SOCS3, IFNGR1 and PDGFB.
Interestingly, though these modules were broadly representative of vital immune mechanisms
seen in all respiratory infections21,22, they also highlighted certain mechanisms unique to SARSCoV-2. For example, subversion of innate immune response is inherent to cytopathic pathogens
like SARS-CoV (a related beta coronavirus), which causes an increased release of pyroptosis

products (e.g. IL-1B), inducing acute inflammatory responses. The antagonism of interferon
response by SARS-CoV viral proteins has been suggested to occur at multiple stages of the
interferon and NFKB signaling cascades, through multiple mechanisms, including IKBKE and
TRAF3 regulation, affecting downstream STAT1 associated signaling23. It is possible that, in the
SARS-CoV-2 infection, the observed upregulation of IKBKE, TRAF3, NFKB1, NFKB2, RELB,
IRAK2 at 24hpi could be a consequence of similar mechanisms7 The fourth large module,
contained genes specifically activated within the CoV-2 dataset, involved in fibrinolysis and
plasminogen activation cascades (PLAT, PLAU, PLAUR, and SERPINB2), the complement
activation cascade including C3, CSB, CXCL5, and platelet aggregation (platelet activation factor
receptor- PTAFR (Figure 2)). This module was particularly noteworthy given the enrichment
results (Figure 1A) and clinical findings of COVID-192. It is analyzed further in the following
sections.
Plasminogen is the precursor of the serine protease plasmin, a vital component of the fibrinolytic
system, essential for ensuring immune cell infiltration and cytokine production24. Plasminogen
can be activated to plasmin by two serine peptidases, the tissue tissue-specific (T-PA) and
urokinase (U-PA) plasminogen activators encoded by PLAT and PLAU, respectively. It has been
previously reported for SARS-CoV and influenza infections that dysregulation of the urokinase
pathway including U-PA(PLAU) and its inhibitor PAI-1(SERPINE1) might contribute to the
severity of lung disease by altering the dynamics of fibrin breakdown and intra-alveolar fibrin
levels and subsequently inflammation25,26. Here we observed a similar dynamic with SARSCoV-2 infection albeit through activation of tissue plasminogen, PLAT, and the inhibitor
SERPINB2. T-PA (which is triggered when bound to fibrin) and F3 (tissue factor, activated in
CoV-2) levels are known to correlate with d-dimer levels27. D-dimer, a product of fibrin

degradation by plasmin, is elevated in patients with COVID-19 and has been identified as a
marker for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and a worse patient prognosis28. These
findings indicate increased fibrinolytic activity, specifically via T-PA (PLAT) activation, in
SARS-CoV-2 infections.
The outcome of any viral infection is mediated through a complex interplay between viral and
host proteins, which allow for a coordinated innate immune response. Plasminogen inhibitor
(PAI)-1 (SERPINE1) has been reported to function as an anti-viral factor capable of inhibiting
extracellular maturation of influenza particles, specifically through their action on TMPRSS229.
A similar mechanism involving PAI-2 (SERPINB2) likely exists in SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Additionally, T-PA (PLAT) has been reported to interact with ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2
virus7; however, its consequence has not yet been elucidated. We hypothesize that if this
interaction titrates out T-PA, it is likely to result in reduced levels of plasmin which could
contribute to downstream thrombosis events, as seen in COVID-19 patients2. Increased
expression of PLAT validated this. Additionally, increased concentration of SERPINB2 is also
likely to reduce plasmin levels leading to thrombosis. The unique regulation of SERPINB2 and
PLAT in SARS-CoV-2 infections and their subsequent effect on viral- host interaction dynamics
is worthy of further investigation.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes that facilitate leukocyte
infiltration by breaking down the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane. The
genes MMP1 and MMP9 (both upregulated specifically within the CoV-2 dataset, see Figure 2)
can also activated by plasmin in vivo and in vitro30. Additionally, degranulation of neutrophils by
T-PA has been indicated as a source for increase of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)31.
Given the observed increase in MMPs, and their role in facilitating lung inflammation in ARDS

(by enabling neutrophil migration and ECM breakdown)32, it will be essential to evaluate the
impact of T-PA treatments33 on pulmonary remodeling (via MMPs) in patients with severe/acute
COVID-19.
We identified significant upregulation of several genes encoding components of the complement
system, including C3, CFB and C1S, uniquely within the CoV-2 dataset, in contrast to other
upper respiratory tract infections (at 24 hpi). The complement pathway is an integral part of the
innate immune response and is involved in immunosurveillance for pathogen clearance (bacterial
and many viral)34. It traditionally serves as a vital link between the innate and the adaptive
immunity, driving pro-inflammatory cascades. Several of the chemokines/chemoattractants
(CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL3, and CCL20) identified within this cluster can be also be activated by
signaling events precipitated by complement activation35. Overstimulation of these chemokines,
particularly CXCL5, is known to cause destructive inflammatory lung condition in certain
pathogenic models of lung disease36.
Plasmin also activates the complement cascade independently of established pathways (alternate,
lectin, and classical pathways) by cleaving C3 and C5 to functional C3a and C5a respectively,
both of which are known to be crucially involved in the inflammatory response37. Furthermore,
there is increasing evidence for the role of complement in coagulation. C3 is shown to bind
fibrinogen and fibrin with high affinity and prolonging fibrinolysis in a concentration dependent
manner38. Additionally, studies in animal models of thrombosis have identified a plasmin driven
C5a generation capable of driving procoagulant cascades39. Moreover, the presence of terminal
complement components includes C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannosebinding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP2) within the pulmonary
microvasculature and purpuric skin lesions of deceased COVID-19 patients5. These findings

further provide evidence for the activation of complement components observed here and their
role in plasmin- mediated thrombotic events, as a likely mechanism in COVID-19.
Unique activation of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor (PAFR, encoded by the gene
PTAFR) within the complement and coagulation cluster was particularly interesting (Figure 2).
PAF is a potent activator of platelet aggregation as well as immune cell types including
macrophages and neutrophils40. PAF binding to PAFR activates several intracellular signaling
events, and plays pathophysiological roles in molecular mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis,
bronchial asthma, cystic fibrosis41, and endotoxin shock/sepsis42. It is a crucial mediator of
systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic changes. Immune infiltration primed by interaction
between complement system and PAF has been reported previously. Specifically, C5b can
interact with PAF to bind PAFR on the lung epithelial cells increasing vascular permeability43,
and inducing massive eosinophil transmigration44. Eosinophils release leukotrienes and lipids
which can cause further epithelial damage and airflow obstruction45. Leukotrienes, C5a and PAF
are potent chemoattractants of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNs) which can
further activate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) leading to pulmonary damage seen in
COVID-19 patients46. Given the ubiquitousness of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and its ability to
infect a broad range of cell types18, analysis of PTAFR activation patterns in infected tissues
(including vascular endothelia cells) could provide further insights into increased platelet
aggregation (via PAF signaling) and the risk for arterial thrombosis seen in severe/acute COVID19 patients 2. Vitamin-D is known to attenuate ICAM1 (a potent activator of inflammation and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and PTAFR expression and subsequently NFkB mediated
inflammation, in rhinovirus infections47. Similar mechanisms can possibly underly the recent

reports on reduced risk for COVID-19 infections after Vitamin-D supplementation, and provide
evidence for PAF/PAFR mediated signaling in the progression of COVID-1948.
The significant enrichment of mechanisms identified above were indicative of active epithelial
remodeling and provided evidence for a plasmin-mediated complement activation within SARSCoV-2 in contrast to other respiratory infections. We also identified mechanisms that might
contribute to increased inflammation via immune infiltration and platelet aggregation, primed by
interactions between complement system, plasmin and the PAF/PAFR. Our findings further the
understanding of modulation of hemostatic factors, affecting the mechanics of circulating fibrin
and fibrin breakdown products8 and complement activation, underlying acute thrombotic events
including arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 patients2. Although we cannot wholly ascribe all
mechanisms observed within an in vitro study as contributing to observed clinical pathology of
COVID-19, our analysis highlighted SARS-CoV-2 driven response of healthy lung epithelial
cells and its ability to incite a misdirected cascade of interactions between the coagulation and
complement activation, mediated by plasmin. In addition, analysis of DEGs from transcriptomic
measurements in postmortem lung tissue from COVID-19 patients provided a partial insight into
the mechanisms associated with virus-altered epithelial function. Functional analysis of DEGs
identified with COVID-19 exhibited an upregulation of similar immune cascades as those
identified within the CoV-2 dataset (Figure S2 and S3). Significant correlation was also
identified for foldchanges between DEGs commonly regulated between COVID-19 lung and
CoV-2 dataset (rho=0.34). We present our current view of the crosstalk between plasminogen,
complement and platelet-activating systems in SARS-CoV-2 infection in Figure 3.
Further in vivo studies will be required to better understand the viral-host dynamics with respect
to T-PA (PLAT) and PAFR (PTAFR) activation and the subsequent systemic inflammatory

responses, both in symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. We believe that managing the
equilibrium between the complement, coagulation and platelet-activating components can
determine the overall biological activity and the outcome of a disease severity in COVID-19.
Investigation into the efficacy of complement inhibitors (such as Eculizumab49 or Compstatin50),
and plasminogen activators specifically for T-PA, combined with Vitamin-D supplementation to
alleviate symptoms associated with systemic thrombosis and ARDS, should be pursued in
patients with severe/acute COVID-19.

Figure 3 A schematic representation of the crosstalk between plasmin, complement, and
platelet-activating systems in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasminogen conversion is mediated by
either by tissue-specific plasminogen activator (T-PA) or urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA), whose activities can be inhibited by the inhibitors, PAI-1 (SERPINE1) or PAI-2
(SERPINE2B). The conversion of plasminogen to active plasmin is critical for blood clot
breakdown. Failure to breakdown the clots (fibrinolysis) leads to thrombosis. Fibrinolysis can be
inhibited by complement component C3 (C3). The complement components C3 and C5 can be
activated by plasmin (extrinsic pathway), in addition to intrinsic (classic, lectin, and alternative)
pathways. The anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, interact and stimulate mast cells to degranulate,
releasing histamine, cytokines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, leukotrienes,
heparin, and several proteases that damage the tissues. Overstimulation of complement cascade
leads to inflammation, cytokine storm resulting in epithelial damage, and airflow obstruction
that manifests as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Also, C5b and Leukotrienebound PAF are potent attractants of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to the site of
damage. The recruited PMNs can release microbiocidal molecules and form the neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are proinflammatory and promote tissue damage, thrombus
formation, and activate platelets. Degradation of the basement membrane/ ECM promote by
matrix metalloproteinases further promote immune cell infiltration and tissue damage. NETs,

ONLINE METHODS
Data acquisition
We analyzed the data recently published by Blanco-Melo et al51 to gain mechanistic insights into
the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The published dataset contained multiple cell lines treated with
SARS-CoV-2 including NHBE, Calu-3, A529 (with and without exogenous expression of ACE2)
in addition to COVID-19 lung and normal tissue samples (available via GSE147507). Histogram
of counts within normal and diseased lung samples indicated that one COVID-19 lung sample
(Covid Lung 2, Figure S4) is a likely an outlier and was ignored from further analysis. Based on
the sample clustering results of the raw counts (Figure S2.B), we limited our analysis to NHBE/
normal human bronchial epithelial cell lines (hence forth referred to as the CoV-2 dataset). All
available series (GSE) in GEO were extracted from the gene expression omnibus with key words“SARS-CoV”, “MERS-CoV”, “RSV” or “respiratory syncytial virus”, “Influenza” and
“Rhinovirus” for respiratory cell lines (NHBE or BEAS-2B). Since the CoV-2 transcriptional data
was processed at 24 hpi (hours post infection), we chose to compare only those infections which
had cell-lines at 24 hpi yielding the following series GSE3397, GSE71766, GSE100504,
GSE81909, GSE27973, and GSE28904. To limit the impact of sequencing technologies, we
utilized only Affymetrix, the technology with the most coverage among the series considered.
Applying the above stringent inclusion criteria yielded 3 GEO series GSE339752 (RSV),
GSE7176653 (Influenza/H1N1 and Rhinovirus/RV16) and GSE2797354 (Rhinovirus/RV16). We,
however, did not find studies on related beta-coronaviruses in NHBE/BEAS-2B cell lines which
matched our inclusion criterion.
Differential expression analysis
For the sake of reproducibility, we called differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at adjusted p.value
<0.05, using GEO2R for GSE3397, GSE71766 and GSE27973 comparing infected cells with their
respective mocks at 24 hpi only. The DEGs called for GSE27973 were a subset of GSE71766
RV16 comparisons and subsequently ignored. Since these were microarray studies, we aggregated
probes which were significantly differentially expressed, to gene names and calculated a mean fold
change (Supplementary Table 1) and considered these for all comparisons outlined in the
manuscript. We utilized the same pipeline implemented in GEO2R to call DEGs from CoV-2 data
(using the limma-voom pipeline in R). Low counts were filtered using the “FilterByExpression”
feature available through the edgeR package. “topTable” was used to extract all samples under our
significance threshold of p.adj <0.05.We would additionally like to point out that we reanalyzed
the CoV-2 data using the DESeq2 protocol as described in the original publication consistently
identified similar number of DEGs as detected through limma-voom. For the comparision of
COVID-19 lung biopsy sample against two healthy tissue biopsies, we utilized the exact T-test via
“edgeR” to establish significance and extracted the significant genes via “topTags”.
Protein network construction
The human protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) was downloaded from STRINGdb (v
11.0)55 for a combined edge strength of >0.85. We extracted a SARS-CoV-2 infection relevant
subnetwork from this PPIN using DEGs identified in the CoV-2 dataset. The resulting CoV-2
network contained 272 nodes and 608 edges (Figure S3). We additionally annotated this CoV-2
network with differential gene expression information (foldchange) identified in all infections, if
present, to allow us to identify DEGs unique to CoV-2. Functionally relevant modules were

extracted using the clusterMaker plugin in Cytoscape56. Clusters with >3 nodes were retained for
further analysis, resulting in a network size of 162 nodes and 9 clusters (Figure 2). The clusters
were named based on the most prominent terms associated with each cluster as identified using
Enrichr57. Functional enrichment was performed using gene ontology (biological process) and
mSigDB’s Hallmark genesets (v7.1). All visualizations were generated via the ClusterProfiler
library58 available through R/Bioconductor.
