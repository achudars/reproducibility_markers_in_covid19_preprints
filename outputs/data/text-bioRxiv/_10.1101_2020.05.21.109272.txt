Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated
with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized condition in which children with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection present
with a constellation of symptoms including hypotension, multiorgan
involvement, and elevated inflammatory markers. These symptoms
and the associated laboratory values strongly resemble toxic shock
syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response
triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to MHCII
molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, we used structure-based
computational models to demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCR, interacting closely with
both the α- and β-chains variable domains’ complementarity-determining regions. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif
unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in any other SARS coronavirus),
which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to bacterial
superantigens. Further examination revealed that this interaction
between the virus and human T cells is strengthened in the context
of a recently reported rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European
strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from a motif shared between the SARS viruses from
the 2003 and 2019 pandemics, which has intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like character. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2
S may act as a superantigen to drive the development of MIS-C as
well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important
implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.

Significance
Although children have been largely spared from severe COVID19 disease, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been described in Europe and the East Coast of the United States,
termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC). The symptoms and diagnostic lab values of MIS-C resemble
those of toxic shock, typically caused by pathogenic superantigens stimulating excessive activation of the adaptive immune
system. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike has a sequence and
structure motif highly similar to those of bacterial superantigens, and may directly bind to the T cell receptors. This sequence motif, not present in other coronaviruses, may explain
the unique potential for SARS-CoV-2 to cause both MIS-C and
the cytokine storm observed in adult COVID-19 patients.

S

evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which causes COVID-19, is a coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (1).
COVID-19 can manifest in adults as a severe interstitial pneumonia
with hyperinflammation while severe respiratory manifestations are
rare in children (2-4). Recently, however, multisystem inflammatory
system in children (MIS-C) has been recognized in patients that either

tested positive for COVID-19 (by PCR or serology) or had epidemiological links to COVID-19 (5-7). After initial reports in UK (5), many cases
have now been reported in Europe (6, 7), and New York (USA CDC).
However, no such cases have been reported in China, Japan, or South
Korea, which have also been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (ECDC).
MIS-C manifests as persistent fever and hyperinflammation with
multi organ system involvement including cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic and neurologic symptoms (5-7) which
are highly reminiscent of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) (8, 9) (Table 1),
rather than Kawasaki disease due to marked demographic, clinical,
and laboratory differences (6). The similarities to TSS and the association of MIS-C with COVID-19 led us to hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2
may possess superantigenic fragments that induce an inflammatory
cascade and perhaps also contribute to the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm features observed in severe adult COVID-19 cases (3, 4).
The question we raised is: does SARS-CoV-2 S possess superantigenic
fragments that could elicit such reactions upon binding proteins involved in the host cell cytotoxic adaptive immune response? Such a
reaction was not observed in the SARS-CoV pandemic of 2003 (shortly
SARS1). What is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and how recent mutations in
SARS-CoV-2 S may have promoted such an increased virulence?

TSS can be caused by two types of superantigens (SAgs): bacterial
or viral. Bacterial SAgs have been broadly studied. They include proteins secreted by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes
that induce inflammatory cytokine gene induction and toxic shock.
Typical examples are TSS toxin 1 (TSST1), and staphylococcal enterotoxins B (SEB) and H (SEH). They are highly potent T cell activators that
can bind to MHC class II (MHCII) molecules and/or to TCRs of both

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The ability of SAgs to bypass the antigen specificity of the TCRs results in broad activation of T cells and a cytokine
storm, leading to toxic shock (12, 13). Notably SAgs do not bind the
major (antigenic) peptide binding groove of MHCII, but instead bind
other regions as well as the αβTCRs, directly. While early studies
showed that bacterial SAgs activate T cells by binding the β-chain of
dimeric TCRs at their variable domain (V) (14-16), more recent studies
revealed that they can bind to either α- or β-chains, or both (17). The
question is then, does SARS-CoV-2 S possess any superantigenic fragments/domains that could bind to the αβTCRs?
Here, we used computational modelling to determine whether the
SARS-CoV-2 S possesses SAg activity. We demonstrate that an insert
present in SARS-CoV-2 S, which is absent from SARS1 and MERS, mediates high affinity, non-specific binding to the TCR. Notably, a motif
of ~20 amino acids enclosing this insert unique to SARS-CoV-2 among
beta coronaviruses has sequence and structure features highly similar
to those of the SEB toxin. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that a
SARS-CoV-2 S mutation detected in a European strain may enhance
TCR binding, suggesting such mutations may account for geographical
differences in MIS-C occurrence. These finding have important implications for the management and treatment of COVID-19.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
SARS-CoV-2 spike harbors a high affinity site for TCR β-chain binding,
which contains an insertion, P681RRA684, unique to SARS2. We first examined whether SARS-CoV-2 S could bind to the αβTCR. To this aim,
we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 S structural model based on the cryoEM structure resolved for the spike glycoprotein (18), and we used the
X-ray structure of αβTCR resolved in a ternary complex with SEH and
MHCII (17), and generated a series of structural models for possible
SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein – TCR complex formation using ClusPro
(19). Our simulations led to the binding pose presented in Fig. 1A as
one of the most probable mechanisms of complex formation, as described in detail in Supplemental Information (SI) and Supplementary
Fig. S1. Therein, the TCR binds at the interface between the S1 and S2
subunits of the spike protein, near the S1/S2 cleavage site. A closeup
view of the interface between the spike and TCRVβ domain (Fig. 1B)
reveals several strong interatomic interactions, involving residues
S680-R683 on the spike, and R70-E74 and [Q52, D56] on the respective
CDRs 3 and 2 on Vβ.

SARS-CoV-2 is distinguished by the existence of this four-residue insertion, PRRA, preceding the furin cleavage site (R685-S686 peptide bond)
between the subunits S1 and S2 of each protomer (Fig. 2A). Structural
comparison of the trimeric S proteins between SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 further shows their close structural similarity in general (except
for the RBD which is engaged in specific interfacial interactions (18)),
but the two spikes significantly differ near the PRRARS motif unique to
SARS-CoV-2, which is exposed to the extracellular medium (Fig. 2B).
Further examination of the motif near PRRA reveals close structural
similarity to the SEB superantigen as well as sequence similarities to
neurotoxins and a viral SAg. The insertion PRRA together with the sequentially preceding seven amino acids and succeeding Arg (fully conserved among β-coronaviruses) have been pointed out to form a motif,
Y674QTQTNSPRRAR685, homologous to that of neurotoxins from Ophiophagus (cobra) and Bungarus genera, as well as neurotoxin-like regions from three RABV strains (21) (Fig. 2C). We further noticed that
the same segment bears close similarity to HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120
superantigenic motif F164-V164.

including the PRRA insert and highly conserved cleavage site R685 is shown in van der

We note that the TCRVβ-binding epitope on SARS-CoV-2 S is centered around a sequence motif, P681RRA684 (or shortly PRRA, hereafter),
and its sequential and spatial neighbors. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 S
to other beta-coronavirus spike protein sequences showed (20) that

This close sequence similarity to both bacterial and viral SAgs, in
support of the potential superantigenic character of the amino acid
stretch Y674-R685 of SARS-CoV-2 S directed us to further analyze its
local sequence and structural properties. Our analysis led to an interesting sequence similarity between the partially overlapping fragment
T678-Q690 of the spike and the SEB superantigenic peptide Y150NKKKATVQELD161 (Fig. 3A). This dodecapeptide sequence within the SEB
shows strong conservation among a broad range of staphylococcal and
streptococcal SAgs (23, 24). We note that the sequentially aligned segment of SARS1 (S664-K672) bears minimal similarity to the SEB SAg
(Fig. 3A left). What is even more interesting is that SARS-Cov-2 motif
showed a palindromic behavior with respect to the superantigenic SEB
sequence in the sense that a broader stretch, from E661 to R685, could
be aligned to the superantigen peptide in the reverse direction as well
(Fig. 3A right). This brings to our attention the versatility and high propensity of the SARS-CoV-2 S TCRVβ-binding site residues to potentially
act as a superantigenic fragment.

Significantly, the structures of the two peptides exhibit a remarkable similarity (Fig. 3B-C), including a salt bridge stabilizing each structural motif (E159-K152 in SEB and E661-R685 in SARS-CoV-2 S), the relative orientations of three positively charged residues (K152-K153K154 in SEB and R682-R683-R685 in SARS-CoV-2 S ), a β-hairpin which
apparently serves as a scaffold, and may be further supported in SARS
coronavirus by a potential disulfide bond between C662-C671. The former two features are absent in SARS1 spike (Fig. 3D).

2003 pandemic (26). This led to the identification of the nine sequence
stretches including three Botulinum neurotoxin type D or G precursors,
and two motifs that have a high similarity with the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Comparative analysis with SARS-CoV-2 spike
sequence revealed that seven of these sequence motifs are conserved
between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Among
them, we note that Y279NENGTITDAVDCALDPLSETKC301, an ICAM-1
(CD54)-like motif, also participates in the association between the
SARS-CoV-2 spike and the bound αβTCR (see Fig. 4).
Note that ICAM-1 involvement is critical to mediating immune and
inflammatory responses. The observed interaction of the ICAM-1-like
motif of SARS-CoV-2 S with TCRVα, in tandem with the interaction of
the above discussed putative SAg motif (around the insert PRRA) with
TCRVα, is likely to further strengthen the association of the virus with
the T cell and the ensuing activation. Precisely, N280-E281-N282 and
T286 belonging to the ICAM-like fragment closely interact with the
TCRVα CDRs; mainly T286 (spike) makes close contacts with S94
(CDR3), E281 (spike) forms a hydrogen bond with T51 (CDR2), and
N280 and N282 (spike) closely associate with R69 (Fig. 4D).

SARS-CoV S exhibits totally distinctive structural features: a salt bridge, K152-E159 (in

poly-basic (with three lysines and three arginines in the respective motifs), whereas
SARS-CoV spike counterpart has one basic residue (R667) only; and the former two
possess a scaffolding ASN, which is absent on SARS1. (E) Structural alignment of CD28,
the receptor binding SEB, onto TCRVβ domain, in support of the adaptability of the
putative SAg site to accommodate spike-TCRβ or SEB-CD28 interactions.

This analysis overall indicates that the segment T678NSPRRAR685
forms a putatively superantigenic core, consistently aligned against
various bacterial or viral SAgs (Figs. 2C and 3A-C) with or without the
participation of the adjoining amino acids. However, combined
broader sequence and structure analysis in Fig. 3 panels A (right) and
B-C, reveals an even more compelling feature: this putative SAg core
is structurally consolidated by spatial proximity to a conserved acidic
segment, E661CD663, which forms a highly stable salt bridge with the
polybasic segment PRRAR of SARS-CoV-2 S, much in the same way as
to the salt bridge observed in SEB (but not in SARS1 S).
We note that the SEB superantigen peptide Y150NKKKATVQELD161
has been reported to bind CD28 (23), a T cell receptor that provides
co-stimulatory signals required for T cell activation and survival. CD28
and TCRV domains share the same (immunoglobulin) fold (Fig. 3E),
and the binding mechanism shown in Fig. 1B is likely to be adopted
with minor rearrangements for enabling the binding of SEB to CD28.
Finally, because of the homologous superantigenic segment of SEB
binding CD28, we also tested the potential binding of SARS2 spike
E661-R685 onto CD28, considering the possibility that the target of
SARS2 spike superantigenic segment might be CD28. Our simulations
indicated that the same segment can equally bind to CD28, further
supporting the strong propensity of the fragment to stimulate T cell
activation.
SARS-CoV-2 spike retains other superantigenic or toxic fragments observed in SARS1 spike, including an ICAM-1 like motif engaged in stabilizing interactions with TCRVα. The existence of potential superantigenic, toxic or intercellular-adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like sequence
fragments in SARS1 was thoroughly examined by Li et al. following the

A rare mutation, D839Y/E, recently observed in a SARS2 strain from
Europe contributes to stabilizing the interaction with TCR. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike binding region harbors three residues that
have been recently reported to have mutated in new strains from Europe and USA (27, 28): D614G, A831V and D839Y/N/E). The former
two may potentially interact with MHCII; while the latter (D839, European strain) is located close to TCRVβ and strongly interacts with N30;
(Fig. 4A and C, and Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4A). Its substitution
by glutamate in the mutant D839E increases the strength of the intermolecular (and thereby virus-T cell) association (Supplementary Fig.
S4C). Even stronger interactions between spike and TCRVβ are observed upon replacing D839 with a tyrosine as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S4D: The interfacial interactions in this case are further
stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Y839 and D32; an aromatic

(polar-π) interaction between Y839 and N30; as well as possible electrostatic interactions with K73 and S97. Quantitative evaluation of the
change in binding affinity between the spike and TCR upon mutating
D839 to Y, E and N yields ΔΔGD→Y = -2.2kcal mol-1, ΔΔGD→E = -2.1kcal
mol-1, and ΔΔGD→N = -1.3kcal mol-1 respectively (see Supplementary
Table S1 for details). Thus, the D839Y/N/E mutations would be expected to strengthen/support the above described association between the superantigenic PRRA-containing segment and the TCRVβ.
CONCLUSION
An understanding of the immunopathology leading to severe manifestations of COVID-19, in both adults and children, is of critical importance for effective management and treatment of the disease.
MIS-C shows remarkable similarity to pediatric TSS (5-9). Using in silico
modeling and analysis, we found that SARS-CoV-2 encodes a superantigen motif near its S1/S2 cleavage site. This region is highly similar in
structure to the SEB SAg motif that interacts with both the TCR and
CD28 (23) and mediates TSS. SEB enables large-scale T cell activation
and proliferation (13), resulting in massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2 from T cells as well as
IL-1 and TNFα from APCs (13). This cytokine storm leads to multi-organ
tissue damage similar to what is now observed in MIS-C. We therefore
propose that MIS-C observed in COVID-19 patients may be mediated
by superantigen activity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
To date, MIS-C is mostly observed in Europe and East Coast of North
America, and has not been described in Asia, despite sizeable outbreaks of COVID-19 (5-7) (CDC and ECDC). We show that a mutation at
D839 found in a European strain of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the binding
affinity of the SAg motif to the TCR. This could (at least partly) explain
the geographical skewing of MIS-C to areas where the European strain
is endemic, and identification of other strain-specific mutations may
help predict where future outbreak of MIS-C may occur.
Our findings raise the exciting possibility that immunomodulatory
therapeutic options used for TSS may also be effective for MIS-C, including IVIG and steroids. Indeed, initial published and unpublished
reports suggest that MIS-C patients respond well to IVIG with or without steroids (5-7). IVIG recognizes SEB epitopes (29), and thus may
function in part by neutralization of a superantigen. Given structural
similarities between SEB and the S protein SAg motif, there is potential
for cross-reactivity of these immunoglobins, explaining at least in part
the response of MIS-C cases to IVIG. Other FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drugs tested in models of SEB TSS may also be effective, including CTLA4-Ig which can inhibit CD28 co-stimulation (30), and the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (31), which is already in use for COVID-19.
In addition, humanized monoclonal anti-SEB Abs have been described
(32) that could also be of potential therapeutic benefit in MIS-C patients. Notably, it has been shown in the mouse model of TSS that lethal SEB superantigen challenge can be prevented by short peptide
mimetics of its superantigen motif (23). It would be interesting to examine whether short peptide mimetics of SARS-CoV-2 spike superantigen region might be employed to prevent/attenuate inflammatory
cytokine gene induction and toxic shock in MIS-C patients.
At present, the majority of antibody therapies under investigation
are designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains
(RBDs) (33, 34), and our simulations also indicated that RBD might potentially interact with TCRs. However, compared with RBDs, relatively
fewer mutations are found in the SAg region of SARS-CoV-2; notably,
the “PRRA” insert is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and retained among all of
its isolates sequenced to date (27, 28). It might be constructive to design antibodies or drugs targeting this SAg region, to not only block the
cleavage essential to enabling viral entry (1, 20), but also modulate the
SAg-induced inflammatory cytokine gene induction (13).
Fortunately, severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 in children as well as development of MIS-C are rare. This may be due to

trained immunity (2) or cross-viral immunity to other coronavirus
strains (35). T and B cells play an important role in the anti-viral response. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients
can recognize a range of SARS2 epitopes, and the S protein represents
a major target (35). Interestingly, T cells from unexposed individuals
can also respond to S protein epitopes from SARS-CoV-2, which supports the hypothesis of cross-viral immunity from other coronavirus
strains (35). However, why only a fraction of infected children develop
MIS-C is unclear. It is possible that a poor initial antibody response to
the virus fails to neutralize SAg leading to immune enhancement following re exposure or that certain HLA types are more permissive of
binding SAg, and indeed HLA has been shown to play a role in COVID
susceptibility (36). Of the nine cases initially reported in the UK, six
were of Afro-Caribbean descent, which also suggests a potential genetic component to susceptibility (5).
It is interesting to note that approximately a third or fewer of MISC patients tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2, but the majority (but
not all) have serologic evidence of infection or a history of exposure to
COVID-19 (5-7). This may suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 SAg causes a
delayed hyperinflammation response in certain children. SAgs have
been implicated in autoimmunity by triggering self-reactive T cells (12).
Antibody-mediated enhancement upon re-exposure to the virus may
also contribute to uncontrolled infection and inflammation (37). It is
also possible that despite a negative nasopharyngeal PCR test, the virus may still be present in the gastrointestinal tract (38). MIS-C patients demonstrate unusually severe GI symptoms, abdominal pain,
vomiting and diarrhea, in addition to severe myocardial dysfunction
and cardiac shock (5-7) and such severe GI symptoms are also frequently associated with the SAg (9).
In summary we made three major observations: (a) PRRAR and sequential neighbors interact with TCRVβ residues D56, R70 and E74 at
the CDRs, and this association closely resembles that of SEB SAg with
TCRVβ; (b) nearby D839 participates in this interaction and its mutation to tyrosine would further strengthen the association with TCRVβ;
and (c) a sequence motif (N280-T286) typical of ICAM-1 further interacts with the TCRVα further stabilizing/enhancing the association between the viral spike and host cell TCR. So, the binding pose of TCR
with respect to the spike allows simultaneously for all three associations. The first is the most important. The 2nd is significant because it
is the European strain. The 3rd may be imparting a stronger host-virus
adhesion. Therefore, strategies used for the treatment of SEB-mediated Toxic Shock or approaches to block the interaction of S protein
with the TCR may reduce hyperinflammatory manifestations of
COVID-19 in both adults and children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 (P0DTC2) and SARS-CoV (CVHSA_P59594) spike models were
generated using SWISS-MODEL (39), based on the resolved spike glycoprotein structures of SARS-CoV-2(18) (PDB: 6VSB) and SARS-CoV (40) (PDB:
6ACD).The missing loops in the crystal structures were built using libraries
of backbone fragments (41) or by constraint space de novo reconstruction
of these backbone segments (42). Two mutants associated with European
Covid-19 patients (28) were constructed using CHARMM-GUI (43): one is
the main strain mutant D614G and the other contains four mutations including Q239K, A831V, D614G and D839Y. These two SARS-CoV-2 spike
mutants together with the SARS-CoV-2 (P0DTC2) originally taken from Wuhan were used to investigate the binding to αβTCR, and MHCII (PDB: 2XN9)
(17) using ClusPro (19) and PRODIGY (44). See details in the SI.
