ABSTRACT
Here we describe a hypothesis free approach to screen for interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
protein with human cell surface receptors. We used a library screening approach to detect
binding interactions across one of the largest known panels of membrane-bound and soluble
receptors, comprising 5845 targets, expressed recombinantly in human cells. We were able
confirm and replicate SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 and other putative coreceptors such as
CD209 and CLEC4M. More significantly, we identified interactions with a number of novel
SARS-CoV-2 S binding proteins. Three of these novel receptors, NID1, CNTN1 and APOA4
were specific to SARS-CoV-2, and not SARS-COV, with APOA4 binding the S-protein with
equal affinity as ACE2. With this knowledge we may further understand the disease
pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients and how infection by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to differences
in pathology in specific organs or indeed the virulence observed in different ethnicities.
Importantly we illustrate a methodology which can be used for rapid, unbiassed identification of
cell surface receptors, to support drug screening and drug repurposing approaches for this and
future pandemics.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades there have been 3 major epidemics posing risk to human life, all of
which have been caused by strains of viral betacoronaviruses; the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) and the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2), which has seen the loss of >2.6
million lives worldwide (as of March 2021). When a new previously unidentified virus emerges,
a lack of knowledge of the virus and understanding of the mechanism by which it infects people
poses a major challenge with respect to applications of current treatment and to the design and
development of potential novel targeted therapies. As such identification and access to relevant
and rapid technologies that can aid deconvolution of the viral life cycle to inform therapeutic
options is essential.
Viral infections are initiated when virus particles bind to host cellular receptors, mediating viral
entry, hijacking the host cellular machinery for replicating the viral DNA and driving the
manifestation of infectious disease. Betacoronaviruses all share a similar structural configuration
with a central body core, containing the viral DNA, decorated with cell surface spike
glycoproteins (S), giving it the distinct crown-like appearance. The spike proteins consist of an
S1 domain responsible for host receptor binding, and an S2 domain responsible for cell
membrane fusion, important aspects for determining host tropism and transmission capacity (Li
et al, 2016; Lu et al, 2015; Wang et al, 2016; He et al, 2004). In addition, post-translational
modifications, such as glycosylation, may extend the diversity of the interaction of the spike
protein with other proteins, adding to the complexity and specificity of the mechanism by which
each virus causes infection (Fung et al, 2018).
Across the human betacoronoviruses, SARS-CoV-2 shares 86.22% overall homology with
SARS-CoV and 45.57% with MERS-CoV (Lu et al, 2020; Jaimes et al, 2020). However,
comparing commonality of the spike region alone, using the EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence
alignment tool, there is lower sequence identity with just 76.4% between SARS-CoV S and
SARS-CoV-2 S, with the most variable region occurring within the S1 domain. Given the
variation between the betacoronaviruses in sequence identity and post translational modification
of the spike proteins, differences in receptor recognition, mechanisms of viral entry and tropism
between the strains are expected.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the host-recognition receptor for
viral entry of SARS-CoV (Li et al, 2003; Wang et al, 2008). Despite the differences in amino
acid similarity within the receptor binding domain, SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to use
ACE2 for viral entry (Zhao et al, 2020; Hoffmann et al, 2020) and to bind with even higher
affinity than SARS-CoV (Tai et al 2020; Walls et al 2020). ACE2 has a wide distribution across
human tissues, including lung, liver, stomach, ileum, colon and kidney (Zou et al, 2020),
correlating with clinical effects in these target organs. However, there is a discordance in some
tissues between expression levels of ACE2 and the level of SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting
SARS-CoV-2 may depend on a co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its
infection and tropism in these tissues (Trypsteen et al, 2020).

Several groups have conducted studies to identify receptors and co-receptors involved in
mechanisms of infection for SARS-CoV-2. Qi et al (2020) looked at co expression of receptors
where those with similar expression patterns to ACE2 were considered to be putative coreceptors
e.g. ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP; Wei et al (2020) screened a genome-wide pooled CRISPR
library for pro and anti-viral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection; and Gordon et al (2020)
mapped protein-protein interactions between human and SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity
purification mass spectrometry (Gordon et al, 2020). Gu et al (2020) carried out an analysis of
SARS-CoV-2 spike interactions with the host receptome and identified 12 putative receptors
with KREMEN1, ASGR1 and CLEC4M showing greatest affinity. A number of cell surface
lectins have also been identified which bind spike protein of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
CLEC4G, CLEC4M and CD209 (CLEC4L) have been cited as receptors of SARS-CoV (Yang et
al, 2004; Marzi et al, 2004; Gramberg et al, 2005; Li et al, 2008), the latter two also cited as
coreceptors for SARS-CoV-2 (Brufsky & Lotze, 2020). The presence and biodistribution of
these glycan specific cell surface lectins, together with host-specific viral glycosylation could
influence transmission.
In an effort to rapidly develop therapies for the COVID-19 pandemic, drug repurposing has been
explored with efforts directed at mechanisms of virus replication and viral entry (Khodadadi et
al, 2020), but there are limited therapeutic options for inhibiting the receptors identified to date.
While there are no specific inhibitors of ACE2 binding, novel receptors or coreceptors involved
in SARS-CoV-2 infection may therefore offer potential as new therapeutic targets.
Here we describe a hypothesis free approach to screen for novel interactions of SARS-CoV-2
spike protein with human cell surface receptors. We designed, expressed and purified an optimal
recombinant natively folded trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and used a high throughput
library screening approach to detect binding interactions. To our knowledge, this is the largest
panel of membrane bound and soluble receptors, comprising 5845 targets, expressed
recombinantly in human cells. We were able to confirm and replicate SAR-CoV-2 binding to
ACE2 and other putative coreceptors CD209, ASGR1 (CLEC4H1) and CLEC4M. More
significantly, we identified additional novel receptors, CNTN1, NID1 and APOA4, which have
not been associated with coronavirus infection to date. With this knowledge we may further
understand disease pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients and how infection by SARS-CoV-2 may
lead to failure of specific organs or virulence in different ethnicities. Importantly we illustrate a
methodology which can be used for rapid and unbiassed identification of cell surface receptors,
to support drug screening and drug repurposing approaches for this and future pandemics.

RESULTS
Experimental design
The construct design for this study was based on published literature (Gui et al, 2017; Pallesen et
al, 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al, 2018; Amanat et al, 2020; Walls et al, 2017; Wrapp et al, 2020).
Constructs included a modified S1/S2 domain boundary cleavage site to avoid sample
heterogeneity, as well as a pair of proline mutations to stabilise the spike proteins in the
prefusion conformation (Fig 1A). Soluble, trimeric SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins
fused at the C-terminus to the Fc region of human IgG as a means of detection in the screening
process, and to a 6His tag (SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S, respectively) were produced
recombinantly using the HEK-293 expression system with yields of purified protein of up to 1.7
mg/L culture. Reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins showed single bands
between 140 and 200 kDa (Fig 1B). However, fusion of the Fc region also resulted in
dimerization of the spike trimers, with molecular weights estimated to be greater than 600 kDa
by size exclusion chromatography analysis (Fig 1C).
The experimental approach to identify and validate interactors of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
utilized systematic application of cell microarray-based expression library screens, followed by
cell microarray and flow cytometric confirmatory screens, as outlined in Figure 1d.

Identification of interactions for the SARS-CoV2 full-length spike protein
In order to identify receptors for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 S protein was
screened for binding to 5845 human HEK293 cell-expressed monomeric or heterodimeric human
plasma membrane proteins and cell-surface tethered human secreted proteins using the
Retrogenix cell microarray technology (Fig 1D). To maximize the likelihood of identifying
interactions, full library screens were performed using 4 different approaches: SARS-CoV-2 S
protein was added to live cell microarrays prior to cell fixation, or was added to fixed cell
microarrays. In each case, slides were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S protein followed by
incubation with an AlexaFluor647 labelled anti-Fc detection antibody; or, SARS-CoV-2 S
protein was pre-incubated with the same detection antibody at a 2:1 molar ratio prior to slide
incubations.
Twenty-three positive hits were identified in total from the 4 library screens, with a full range of
signal intensities. These comprised of 15 membrane proteins and 8 cell-surface tethered secreted
proteins. All 23 hits, and 5 control proteins (CD20, CD86, EGFR and a FCGR3A:FCER1G
heterodimer) were re-expressed in HEK293 cells on cell microarray slides, and a series of
confirmatory screens were performed on fixed cells, live cells (before fixation) and live cells (no
fixation) using the same SARS-CoV-2 S test protein, or SARS-CoV S control protein, each preincubated or sequentially incubated with the AlexaFluor647 detection antibody. Fig 2 shows a
representative cell microarray confirmatory screen on live cells (no fixation) using the preincubation method. Interactions specific to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and SARS-CoV S control
protein, that were not observed with the control treatments (Rituximab biosimilar and/or PBS)

are shown in green (non-underlined); and interactions specific to SARS-CoV-2 S protein but not
SARS-CoV S control protein, or the control treatments, are shown in green (bolded and
underlined). The results from all cell microarray based confirmatory screens with the SARSCoV-2 S test protein are summarised in Fig 3A, along with the library screen results with the
same interactors. In total, 10 proteins were identified which were specific to SARS-CoV-2 S test
protein, of which 5 were shared with SARS-CoV S protein (ACE2, ASGR1, CLEC4M, CD209,
MSMP) and another 2 (CD44 and CLPS) were observed with MERS-S1 protein (Fig 3B). The 3
remaining interactors (CNTN1 and cell-surface tethered forms of the secreted proteins NID1 and
APOA4) were exclusive to SARS-CoV-2 S test protein. Figs 3A and 3B show the relative
intensity of each interaction, and the incubation methods that yielded positive hits. ACE2,
CLEC4M and CD209 showed the highest signal intensities.
Five of the 10 interactions (ACE2, ASGR1, CLEC4M, CD209 and APOA4) were also detected
using a commercial SARS S1- sheep Fc domain fusion protein (Fig 3B). Nine of the 10
interactions (the exception being CNTN1) were detected when binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S
test protein binding was detected using an AlexaFluor647 anti-His detection instead of
AlexaFluor647 anti-hIgG Fc detection (Fig 3A). With both detection approaches, ACE2,
CLEC4M and CD209 showed the highest signal intensities. The fact that a control MERS-S1His protein showed detectable binding to CLPS and CD44 only indicates that the other
interactions are not general to all coronaviruses.
Validation of the identified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions
In order to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions further, nine of the 10
interactions identified above (ACE2, ASGR1, CLEC4M, CD209, CNTN1, MSMP, APOA4,
NID1 and CD44) were investigated further on live transiently transfected HEK293 cells by flow
cytometry, using a concentration range of 0–150 μg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S test protein or SARSCoV S control protein. The exception was CLPS, since an initial single dose experiment showed
this interaction could not be reproduced by flow cytometry. Fig 4 shows titration curves of the
two spike proteins against each expressed target, after normalising for background binding to
cells at each spike protein concentration. EC50 values were determined where possible, and are
independent of the relative expression level of each target protein (Table 1). These data
confirmed the specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to each of the 9 identified target
proteins, with EC50 values for binding ranging from 1.6 ± 0.5 μg/mL (ACE2) to greater than
150 μg/mL (CNTN1 and CD44, for which EC50 values could not be determined using the
concentrations tested). For 5 of the target proteins, namely ACE2, ASGR1, CLEC4M, CD209
and MSMP, there was no significant difference in the EC50 values between the SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV S proteins. In contrast, for 3 of the target proteins (CNTN1, APOA4 and NID1),
while no significant binding of SARS-CoV S protein was detected, SARS-CoV-2 S protein
showed specific binding interactions, consistent with the cell microarray data (Figs 3A and
3B). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S protein interacted with APOA4 as tightly as its interaction with
ACE2 (EC50 values: 1.8 ± 0.5 μg/mL and 1.6 ± 0.5 μg/mL, respectively).

DISCUSSION
In this study we employed an agnostic approach to the identification of human plasma membrane
and secreted protein binding partners for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, in order to identify
potential therapeutic targets for viral cell entry. We screened full length SARS-CoV-2 spike
trimer protein against a cell microarray platform, expressing a vast library of membrane and
secreted proteins expressed in human cells. We employed four different incubation
methodologies to maximise the success rate. The value of this platform technology is
demonstrated by the confirmation of a number of previously known receptors as well as the
discovery of three novel receptors.
The sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was available within 1 month of the initial cases of the
COVID pandemic being reported in Wuhan in Dec 2019 (Wu et al, 2020). This showed the virus
shared structural similarities with SARS-CoV exhibiting a spike protein on the surface of the
virion responsible for receptor binding and fusion, that is heavily glycosylated and formed by 3 S
protein monomers. In our study, we engineered the SARS-CoV-2 S sequence to produce fulllength S monomers that assembled to form a homo-trimer, ensuring the S protein was in its
physiologically relevant prefusion conformation. This enabled us to look solely at initial binding
events.
The unique cell microarray platform uses an array of expression vectors encoding a total of more
than 5,800 full length human integral plasma membrane and membrane-tethered secreted
proteins, which are reverse transfected and individually over-expressed on the cell surface of
human HEK293 cells. This physiologically-relevant system allows even low affinity interactions
with the viral spike protein to be detected with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.
Using this technology platform, we confirmed the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
spike proteins to ACE2 with equivalent affinities (half-maximal binding was achieved at
1.7μg/ml (2.8nM) and 1.6μg/ml (2.7nM) respectively). We also confirmed binding of SARSCoV-2 S at other receptors previously reported, namely ASGR1 (CLEC4H1), CLEC4M and
CD209 (CLEC4L) (Gu et al, 2020; Brufsky et al, 2020).
Importantly three novel binding proteins, APOA4, CNTN1 and NID1 were identified which
showed specificity for SARS-CoV-2 when compared with SARS-CoV. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S
protein demonstrated an equivalent affinity for APOA4 as for ACE2 (half-maximal binding was
achieved at 1.8μg/ml (3nM) and 1.6μg/ml (2.7nM) respectively).
While we had speculated alternative receptors or co-receptors of SARS-CoV-2 might exist in
addition to ACE2 this is the first time APOA4 has been identified, suggesting this is another
mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 may infect cells. APOA4 is a lipoprotein, previously shown
to influence viral attachment and interaction of Hepatitis C virus with its primary receptors
(Zeisel et al, 2013). APOA4 is expressed in the intestine, is a cellular marker of enterocytes and
plays role in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. Expression of APOA4 also correlates with the
highest level of ACE2 expression, which is found in intestinal enterocytes (Hamming et al, 2004;
Qi et al, 2020).The gastrointestinal tract is considered a target organ for SARS-CoV-2 infection

with up to 34% of COVID-19 patients reporting digestive symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, and
abdominal discomfort (Yang & Tu, 2020). While this may suggest a link for APOA4 and SARSCoV-2 infection in the gastrointestinal tract, further work is required to determine its functional
significance.
Our study also confirmed a number of receptors belonging to the C-Type Lectin Domain Family
4 (CLEC4), which exhibit high avidity for glycoproteins, that are present in viral envelope
proteins (Helenius et al, 2018; Feinberg et al, 2001) and also the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Of
significance, CD209 (CLEC4L/ DC-SIGN) has been cited as a coreceptor for SARS-CoV where
deglycosylation of the spike protein reduces infectivity of viral pseudotypes expressing SARSCoV S. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which increase glycosylation were identified in
clinical isolates, and shown to increase viral load and cytopathic effects in culture (Han et al,
2007; Yao et al, 2020). Interestingly, as viral glycosylation occurs in the host cell endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus, it is subject to host specific and genetic influences, and hence the
family of CLEC4 proteins offer potential for effect on virulence in different ethnicities.
Lectins differ in tissue expression and ligand affinities and therefore could influence the tissue
specific tropism seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease pathology. Especially of
interest are those lectins showing tissue specific expression in organs associated with disease
pathology and where ACE2 expression is low. ASGR1 (CLEC4H1) is an endocytic recycling
receptor which has been reported to facilitate entry of Hepatitis C virus (Saunier et al, 2003) and
is expressed exclusively in the liver. ACE2 however is expressed at low levels in the liver, yet
liver impairment is common in patients with COVID-19, where SARS-CoV-2 infection directly
causes cytopathy of hepatocytes and impairs liver function.
Overall, our data suggests COVID-19 may be a highly promiscuous virus exploiting multiple
mechanisms of cell entry, contributing to its severity and targeting of specific patient groups.
Furthermore, using recombinant full length spike trimer protein coupled with cell microarray
technology and flow cytometry, we have demonstrated a fast, accurate and comprehensive
approach for discovering the human cell surface targets of viruses. This technology can be
further applied to this pandemic, with the many emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, and to future
epidemics for the identification of exploitable drug targets to control viral infection.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Construct design, protein expression and purification
Constructs encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein aa14-1213 and SARS-CoV spike protein aa141195 were synthesised commercially codon optimised for mammalian cell expression (Genscript
and GeneArt, respectively). Residues 682-685 were mutated from RRAR to GSAS in SARSCoV-2 S and R667A mutation was introduced in SARS-CoV S, as well as two stabilising
mutations (K986P and V987P in SARS-CoV-2 S, K968P and V969P in SARS-CoV S) and a T4
foldon trimerization domain at the C-terminus. Both spike proteins were also fused to the Fc
region of human IgG for assay detection and to a hexahistidine tag for purification at the Cterminus. The resultant recombinant proteins, SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S respectively,
were produced in the HEK-293 cell system and were purified from the culture supernatants by
capture with Ni Sepharose excel affinity resin (Cytiva) followed by size exclusion
chromatography using a Superose 6 16/60 column in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
purified proteins were analysed by reducing SDS-PAGE for purity, mass spectrometry for
identity and A280 correcting for the extinction coefficient in order to determine concentration.
Cell microarray library screening
5845 mammalian cell expression vectors, each encoding a full-length human plasma membrane
protein or a cell-surface tethered secreted protein, including ACE2, were arrayed in duplicates
across 16 slide sets. Human HEK293 cells were grown over the vector microarray, leading to
reverse transfection at each location. ZsGreen1 encoded by the vector was used to monitor the
transfection efficiency and define the microarray position. All transfection efficiencies exceeded
the minimum threshold.
Either before or after fixing the cells, 10 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S protein alone, or pre-incubated
with AlexaFluor647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fcγ pAb (Jackson ImmunoResearch;
detection antibody) at a 2:1 molar ratio (‘pre-incubation method’), was incubated with the cell
microarray slides for 1 hour. In the case of cell microarray slides incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S
protein alone, the same detection antibody was added sequentially (‘sequential incubation
method’). Library hits (duplicate Alexa-Fluor647-positive spots) were captured by fluorescence
imaging (GE Ettan DIGE imager), and analysed using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).
Cell microarray confirmatory and specificity screening
Vectors encoding all library hits and negative control proteins (CD20, CD86 and EGFR) were
arrayed in duplicate, and human HEK293 cells were reverse-transfected as described above. Cell
microarray slides were incubated before, after, or in the absence of cell fixation with 10 μg/mL
SARS-CoV-2 S test protein, 10 μg/mL SARS-CoV S control protein, 1 μg/mL Rituximab
biosimilar (human IgG1; Absolute Antibody, UK), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) only,
each pre-incubated with AlexaFluor647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fcγ pAb at a 2:1 molar
ratio, or treated sequentially with the same detection antibody. Identical slides were treated
before cell fixation with 5 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S1-sheep Fc (Native Antigen Company, UK,
catalogue # REC31806) or PBS, each pre-incubated at a 2:1 molar ratio with AlexaFluor647

donkey anti-sheep IgG (H+L) (Thermo Fisher, UK, catalogue # A-21448); or 5 μg/mL SARSCoV-2 S test protein (Peak Proteins, UK, described above), 5 μg/mL MERS S1-His (Native
Antigen Company, UK, catalogue # REC31760) or PBS, each pre-incubated at a 2:1 molar ratio
with Penta His Alexa Fluor 647 Conjugate (Qiagen, UK). Hits (duplicate AF647 positive spots)
were captured and analysed as described above.
Hit validation by flow cytometry
Expression vectors encoding ZsGreen1 alone, or encoding ZsGreen1 and one of 9 cell
microarray hits were transfected into human HEK293 cells. After 48 h, cells were treated with
Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, UK), pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended into incubation
buffer (PBS supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum) containing a dose range of 0 to 150
μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S protein or SARS-CoV S protein, or 1 μg/mL Rituximab biosimilar
(human IgG1; Absolute Antibody, UK). After a 1 hour incubation, cells were again pelleted,
washed with PBS, and resuspended into incubation buffer containing AlexaFluor647-conjugated
goat anti-human IgG Fcγ pAb for a further incubation. Cells were further washed with PBS, and
analysed by flow cytometry using an Accuri (Becton Dickinson, UK). A 7-Aminoactinomycin D
live/dead dye was used to exclude dead cells in the analysis, and ZsGreen-positive (transfected)
cells were selected for analysis.
For each target transfectant, at each concentration of SARS-CoV-2 S protein or SARS-CoV S
protein, the median AlexaFluor647 value was corrected for background binding to the cells by
subtracting median binding to ZsGreen-only transfected cells at the same concentration. Dose
titration curves were plotted, and EC50 values determined, using Prism GraphPad.

Figure 2. Confirmation, validation and comparison of cell microarray hits for SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV. Representative images from one cell microarray-based confirmatory screen.
Expression vectors encoding both ZsGreen 1 and individual library ‘hits’ were reversetransfected into human HEK293 cells, and live transfectants were probed with the SARS-CoV-2
S test protein, SARS CoV S control protein, or other control treatments. This identified
interactions that were specific to SARS-CoV-2 S test protein (bold and underlined), and those
that were specific to SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S spike proteins (green, not underlined).
ZsGreen1 was used for spot localization. * indicates that these are secreted proteins which were
synthetically cell surface-tethered.

A. Representative of all cell microarray screening data arising library screens with 10 μg/mL
SARS-CoV-2 S test protein using 4 different incubation approaches, and from the cell
microarray-based confirmatory screens using 6 different incubation approaches. Either a
fluorescent anti-Fc detection antibody or a fluorescent anti-His detection antibody was used,
as indicated. Interaction intensities against the 10 SARS-CoV-2 S test protein-specific hits
were graded from very weak to strong intensity. White boxes indicate no interaction was
observed. * indicates that these are secreted proteins which were cell surface-tethered.
B. The 10 SARS-CoV-2 S test protein-specific hits were tested for cross-reactivity with three

Figure 4. Flow Cytometric analysis of binding of cell surface receptors between SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Live human HEK293 cells transiently over-expressing both ZsGreen
and each specific hit identified by cell microarray, were incubated with 0 to 150 μg/mL of
SARS-CoV-2 S protein (left hand panels) or SARS-CoV S protein (right hand panels), and
interactions were investigated by flow cytometry. After correcting for background binding,
binding curves were generated against each target, from which EC50 values were calculated.

protein or SARS-CoV S protein, except for CNTN1, APOA4 and NID1, which were exclusive to
SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The EC50 value for binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to APOA4 was
