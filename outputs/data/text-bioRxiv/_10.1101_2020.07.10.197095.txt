Abstract:

14

Humanity has seen numerous pandemics during its course of evolution. The list includes many

15

such as measles, Ebola, SARS, MERS, etc. Latest edition to this pandemic list is COVID-19,

16

caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As of 4th July 2020, COVID-19 has affected over

17

10 million people from 170+ countries, and 5,28,364 deaths. Genomic technologies have enabled

18

us to understand the genomic constitution of the pathogens, their virulence, evolution, rate of

19

mutations, etc. To date, more than 60,000 virus genomes have been deposited in the public

20

depositories like GISAID and NCBI. While we are writing this, India is the 3rd most-affected

21

country with COVID-19 with 0.6 million cases, and >18000 deaths. Gujarat is the fourth highest

22

affected state with 5.44 percent death rate compared to national average of 2.8 percent.

23

Here, 361 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from across Gujarat have been sequenced and analyzed in order

24

to understand its phylogenetic distribution and variants against global and national sequences.

25

Further, variants were analyzed from diseased and recovered patients from Gujarat and the World

26

to understand its role in pathogenesis. From missense mutations, found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-

27

2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in nucleocapsid (N) gene was found to be significantly

28

associated with mortality in patients. The other significant deleterious variant found in diseased

29

patients from Gujarat and the world is G25563T, which is located in Orf3a and has a potential role

Introduction

35

As per the recent situation report-166 released by the World Health Organisation (WHO), as

36

accessed on 4th July 2020, total confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 across the globe are

37

10,922,324 resulting in 5,23,011 deaths. In many countries like China, Spain, Australia, Japan,

38

South Korea, and USA, the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections has started (Xu and Li 2020;

39

Leung et al. 2020; Strzelecki 2020; Trade et al. 2020). India is the third most affected country

40

by COVID-19 after the USA and Brazil, with 6,48,315 cases and 18,655 deaths, respectively.

41

Gujarat, located in the western part of India, is the fourth highest affected state in the world, with

42

36,123 cases and 1944 deaths. However, the death rate is 5.44%, which is almost two times higher

43

than national average, with a recovery rate of 71.69% in the state of Gujarat, India. Therefore,

44

understanding the pathogen evolution and virulence through genome sequencing will be key to

45

understanding its diversity, variation and its effect on pathogenesis and disease severity. Global

46

depositories like GISAID and NCBI databases are flooded with SARS-CoV-2 genomes with an

47

average of 306 genomes per day being added from across the globe. SARS-CoV-2 genome size is

48

29 to 30.6 kb. The genome includes 10 genes which encode four structural and 16 non-structural

49

proteins. Structural proteins are encoded by the four structural genes, including spike (S), envelope

50

(E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes. The ORF1ab is the largest gene in SARS-CoV-

51

2, which encodes the pp1ab protein and 15 non-structural proteins (nsps). The ORF1a gene

52

encodes for pp1a protein, which also contains 10 nsps (Shereen et al. 2020; Du et al. 2009).

53

In the present study, the whole genome of 361 SARS-CoV-2 from Gujarat have been sequenced

54

and analyzed against 792 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, with the known patient status.

55

The overall dataset comprises 277 confirmed positive COVID-19 patients, which included 100

56

females and 177 male patients. These genomes were studied against a total of 57,043 complete

57

viral genome sequences as accessed on 4th July 2020 to characterize their clades and variants

58

distribution. Further statistical tools were applied to understand the differences in the variants with

59

respect to disease epidemiology. In absence of the clinically approved drugs, vaccine, and possible

60

therapy in treating COVID-19, tracking pathogen evolution through whole genome sequencing

61

can be a very good tool in understanding the progression of pandemic locally as well as globally.

This will also help in devising strategies for vaccine development, potential drug targets and host-

63

pathogen interactions.

Results

65

Samples were collected on the basis of COVID-19 incidence rate from across Gujarat from 13

66

different originating labs representing a total of 38 geographical locations from 18 districts of

67

Gujarat, India Supplemental Table 01. The geographical distribution of the top three locations of

68

viral isolates are represented by Ahmedabad (n=125), Surat (n=65), and Vadodara (n=53). Total

69

361 viral genomes from 277 patients have been sequenced in the study from which 132 were from

70

females while 229 were from males. These patients were from 1 year to 86 years of age group with

71

an average age of 47.80 yrs. Most of the COVID-19 positive patients had the symptoms of fever,

72

diarrhoea, cough and breathing problems while some of them had the comorbid condition like

73

hypertension and diabetes etc. The final outcome of these patients were classified as deceased,

74

recovered, hospitalized or unknown status for further data analysis based on the available metadata

75

information. These details are presented in Supplemental Table S2. Similarly, a data set of around

76

57,043 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (up to 4th July, 2020) downloaded from GISAID server

77

and classified as per the patient status mentioned above. Chi-square test was performed to test the

78

effect of gender and age group for Gujarat and global dataset. The female patients (at p-value

79

0.0240) in Gujarat dataset were observed to be at significantly higher death rate as compared to

80

global dataset in deceased and recovered patients. The genomic dataset was further divided into

81

different age groups of up to 40, 41-60 and over 60 years. The results indicated a significantly

82

higher mortality rate at the age groups of 41-60 (at p-value 0.0391) and over 60 years in Gujarat

83

(at p-value of 0.3932) compared against age groups in the global dataset. Mutation frequency

84

profile of the Gujarat genome with the mutation spectrum is highlighted in Figure 1. including

85

synonymous and missense mutations.

Comparative analysis of mutation profile in SARS-CoV-2 genomes: To understand the

121

significance of the mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from Gujarat, India we have

122

analyzed and compared the mutation profile of the 361 viral isolates from Gujarat along with the

123

global dataset obtained from GISAID with the known patient status of 753 viral genomes and 974

124

Indian genomes (unknown status). The bar chart displaying the comparative mutation analysis is

125

represented as Figure 4 displaying most frequently mutated regions on Gujarat SARS-CoV-2

126

genomes is described as in total, 23,711 mutations were observed in global sequences (n=57,043)

127

of SARS-CoV-2 from GISAID where in 2,191 mutations were observed from 974 Indian isolates

128

while 519 mutations were observed in genomes sequenced from Gujarat (n=361). Out of which 91

129

mutations were novel to Gujarat and 889 were novel to Indian genomes. A Venn diagram depicting

130

mutations shared between sequences from Global, Indian and Gujarat isolates is given Figure 5.

Similarly, comparison of the mutation profile analysis with p-value significance, frequency >5%,

132

absolute count of the number of genomes with prevalence as represented in Table 1. Further

133

frequencies of all the mutations were calculated by subtracting variants of Gujarat genomes from

Discussion

178

SARS-CoV-2 viral genome analysis from Gujarat highlights the distinct genomic attributes,

179

geographical distribution, age composition and gender classification. These features also highlight

180

unique genomic patterns in terms of synonymous and non-synonymous variants associated with

181

the prevalence of dominant clades and lineages with distinct geographical locations in Gujarat.

182

This work also highlights the most comprehensive genomic resources available so far from India.

183

Identifying variants specific to the deceased and recovered patients would certainly aid in better

184

treatment and COVID-19 containment strategy. The fatality rate compared with different

185

geographical locations may point towards the higher virulence profile of certain viral strains with

186

lethal genetic mutations, but this remains clinically unestablished. Perhaps the onset of clinical

187

features in the symptomatic patients help in prioritizing the diagnosis and testing strategy.

188

Genomes reported from India are having diverse mutation profiles. The first case report of

189

complete genome sequence information from India is from a patient in Kerala with a direct travel

190

history to Wuhan, China. Similarly, other isolates from India cluster with Iran, Italy, Spain,

191

England, USA and Belgium and probably similar isolates are transmitting in India and may also

192

have variable mutation profile (Mondal et al.; Yadav et al. 2020; Potdar et al. 2020). The

193

dominance of a particular lineage or clade at a particular location merely does not establish the

194

biological function of the virus type isolate in terms of higher death rate but the epidemiological

195

factors such as clinically diagnosed co-morbidity, age, gender or asymptomatic transmission most

196

likely influencing factor in transmission. Sampling biases could certainly influence the prediction

197

models but it would definitely narrow down to particular types of isolates and unique mutations

198

which further experimentally validated to establish their clinical significance. Further, in

199

subsequent analysis, we have also analysed and identified the mortality rate in different age groups

200

revealing the age group of 41-60 years were statistically significant with p-value of 0.03901.

201

The geographic distribution of the viral isolates is denoted in the phylogeny with the maximum

202

SARS-CoV-2 positive samples sequenced from Ahmedabad (n=125), followed by Surat (n=65),

203

Vadodara (n=53), Gandhinagar (n=28), Sabarkantha (n=18) and Rajkot (n=18). The distribution

204

of dominant lineages in Ahmedabad is steered by occurrences of B.1.36 (n=72), B.1 (n=51) and

205

B.6 (n=2). The concept of lineages, clades, haplotypes or genotypes is slightly perplexing and

206

overlapping in terms of definitions with respect to different depositories and analytics. Therefore,

207

it is most important to define mutations in the isolates that determine their unique position in

208

phylogeny with respect to geographical distribution, age, gender, and locations of the genotypes

209

etc. Phylogenetic distribution of the viral genomes across different geographical locations along

210

with metadata information should help in evaluation of the posterior distribution, virulence,

211

divergence times and evolutionary rates in viral populations (Drummond and Rambaut 2007).

212

The recurrent mutations occurring independently multiple times in the viral genomes are hallmarks

213

of convergent evolution in viral genomes with significance in host adaptability, spread and

214

transmission. Even though, contested in terms of mechanisms driving the pathogenicity and

215

virulence across different hosts and specifically to human populations across different

216

geographical locations (van Dorp et al. 2020; Grifoni et al. 2020).

217

Incidence of mutations in deceased and recovered patients: In the context of the globally

218

prevalent mutations across different geographical locations, we have analysed viral genome

219

isolates with most frequent mutations present in the patients from those who have suffered

220

casualties. The higher death rate, especially in Ahmedabad, India became a cause of serious

221

concern and remains elusive to be identified with enough scientific evidence. We have identified

222

differentially dominant and statistically significant mutations prevalent in the viral genome isolates

223

in Gujarat, India. The dominant mutations in the deceased patients were represented by the change

224

in A23403G was observed at a frequency of 97.67% in Gujarat (p-value of 0.2523) and 89.31%

225

frequency in global genomes with known patient status (p-value of <0.00001). These missense

226

mutations are found to be observed in the spike protein of the coronavirus genome. The well-

227

known function of the viral spike protein is in mediating the infection by interacting with the

228

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Guo et al. 2020; Li et al. 2005; Chu et al.

229

2020; Guan et al. 2020) of the human host species. Another mutation, C14408T with a frequency

230

of 95.35%, present in the Orf1b gene encoding RNA directed RNA polymerase (RDRP) non-

231

structural protein (nsp12) with a p-value of 0.2404 in deceased versus recovered patients from

232

Gujarat, while also being observed statistically significant in the global dataset with a p-value of

233

<0.00001 with a frequency of 87.79 percent. The comparative analysis of the patients deceased

234

(n=43) and recovered patients (n=172) in Gujarat as highlighted in Figure 6 as represented in

235

Venn diagram. In contrast, the functional role of the RDRP enzyme activity is necessary for the

236

viral genome replication and transcription of most RNA viruses (Imbert et al. 2006; Velazquez-

237

Salinas et al., 2020).

238

The exclusive dominant mutations present in the population of Gujarat, India, and those

239

simultaneously being statistically significant were at G25563T and at C28854T were present in

240

the Orf3a and N gene, respectively. The Orf3a gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation

241

of inflammation, antiviral responses, and apoptosis. Mutation in these regions alters the functional

242

profile of the nuclear factor-kβ (NF-kβ) activation and (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich

243

repeat-containing) NLRP3 inflammasome. One of the main features of Orf3a protein is having the

244

presence of a cysteine-rich domain, which participates in the enzymatic nucleophilic substitution

245

reactions. This protein is expressed abundantly in infected and transfected cells, which localizes

246

to intracellular and plasma membranes and also induces apoptosis in transfected and infected cells

247

(Issa et al. 2020). This enzyme mediates extensive proteolytic processing of two overlapping

248

replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, to yield the corresponding functional polypeptides that are

249

essential for coronavirus replication and transcription processes (Kohlmeier and Woodland

250

2009; Benvenuto et al. 2020). Whereas, in case of mutation at position C28311T leading to change

251

of amino acid proline to leucine lies in the nucleocapsid (N) gene which has a role in virion

252

assembly and release and plays a significant role in the formation of replication-transcription

253

complexes (Yin 2020; J Alsaadi and Jones 2019; Liu 2019; Wu et al. 2020). Similarly, the

254

nucleocapsid (N) protein is a highly basic protein that could modulate viral RNA synthesis (Millet

255

and Whittaker 2015; Hassan et al. 2020; Sarif Hassan et al. 2020). The Sorting Intolerant from

256

Tolerant (SIFT) scores of these mutations were determined and also signifies the functional effect

257

change in whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function or not in terms of the

258

deleterious effect or benign tolerated. The SIFT score ranges between 0.0 to 0.05 (deleterious) and

259

0.05 to 1.0 (tolerated) to differentiate the mutation effect (Vaser et al. 2016). The predicted SIFT

260

score of the mutation G25563T in the Orf3a and C28854T in the N gene was classified to be

261

deleterious in nature. Similarly, a comparison analysis of the global (n=57,043), India (n=974) and

265

mutations.

266

Analysis of the dataset of the global deceased (n=131) and recovered patients (n=622) with known

267

status from the metadata information available on GISAID server with the complete genome

268

sequences considered in the analysis indicates the dominance of the A23403G, C14408T and

269

G25563T. The overall comparison of the mutation profile of the patient dataset of deceased and

270

recovered samples is highlighted in Figure 8. While comparing the exclusive missense mutation

271

profile of the patients recovered and deceased in Gujarat (x=43, y=172) and global dataset (x=131,

272

y=622), where the “x” is number of deceased patients and “y” is number of recovered patients.

273

While analyzing missense variants from global and Gujarat dataset among deceased and recovered

274

patients, identified four major mutations to be significantly associated with deceased patients.

275

However, in the context of global dataset mutation C14408T in the RdRp gene and A23403G in

276

spike protein gene were found to be associated with deceased patients at p-value <0.00001.

277

Mutations in the N gene at C28854T and mutation in Orf3a at G25563T gene from diseased

278

patients in Gujarat were found to be significant among deceased patients at p-value 0.0094 and

279

0.231 respectively. Moreover, C28854T is forming a distinct sub-cluster under 20A (A2a as per

280

old classification of next strain) clade with a frequency of 37.95, 2.46 and 1.64 percent (p-value

281

<0.01) in Gujarat, India and global dataset respectively. The same is highlighted in Figure 7. The

282

same is proposed as a new sub-clade 20D in the next strain and GHJ in GISAID. This sub-clade is

283

also present in genomes sequenced from Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. Both these proteins have

284

a significant role in viral replication and pathogenesis (Pachetti et al. 2020; Luan et al. 2020;

Conclusion

301

The genomics approach has been a useful resource to identify and characterize the virulence,

302

pathogenicity, and host adaptability of the sequenced viral genomes. Identification and

303

characterization of the frequently mutated positions in SARS-CoV-2 genome will certainly help

304

in the further understanding of infection biology of the coronaviruses, development of vaccines

305

and therapeutics, and drugs repurpose candidates using predictive computational biology

306

resources. The present study highlights the genomic signature and mutation profile of the 361

307

SARS-CoV-2 viral genome isolates from 38 different locations representing 18 districts across

308

Gujarat, India. Further, we have reported significant variants associated with mortality in Gujarat

309

and Global genomes. As the pandemic is progressing, the virus is also diverging into different

310

clades. This also provides adaptive advantages to viruses in progression of the disease and its

311

pandemic potential. In this study, we have reported a distinct cluster of coronavirus under 20A

312

clade of Nextstrain and proposed it as 20D as per next strain analysis or GHJ as per GISAID

313

analysis, predominantly present in Gujarat genomes. Understanding the pathogen genome and

314

tracking its evolution will help in devising better strategies for the development of diagnosis,

315

treatment, vaccine in response to pandemic.

Material and methods

317

Sample collection and processing: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from a total of 277

318

individuals tested positive for COVID-19 from 38 locations representing 18 districts of Gujarat

319

were collected after obtaining informed consent and appropriate ethics approval. The numbers of

320

samples from these locations were selected on the basis of disease spread in Gujarat. The details

321

of the samples collected from each location is shown in Supplemental Table S1. Samples were

322

transported as per standard operating procedures as prescribed by the World Health Organisation

323

(WHO) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR, New Delhi; SoP No: ICMR-NIV/2019-

324

327

biosafety procedure. cDNA from the extracted RNA was made using SuperScript™ III Reverse

328

Transcriptase first strand kit (Cat. No: 18080093, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) as per the

329

procedures prescribed. SARS-CoV-2 genome was amplified by using Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-

330

2 Research Panel (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) that consists of two pools with amplicons

331

ranging from 125 bp to 275 bp in length and covering >99% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

332

including all serotypes. Amplicon libraries were prepared using Ion AmpliSeq™ Library Kit Plus

333

(Cat. No: A35907; ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). These libraries were quantified using the Ion

334

Library TaqMan™ Quantitation Kit (Cat. No: 4468802, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). The

335

quality of the library was checked on DNA high sensitivity assay kit on Bio-analyser 2100 (Agilent

336

Technologies, USA) and were sequenced on the Ion S5 Plus sequencing platform using 530 chip.

337

Raw data quality assessment and filtering: Quality of data was assessed using FASTQC v.

338

0.11.5 (Andrews et al., 2014) toolkit. All raw data sequences were processed using PRINSEQ-

339

lite v.0.20.4 (Schmieder and Edwards 2011) program filtering the data. All sequences were

340

trimmed from right to where the average quality of 5 bp window was lower than QV25, 5 bp from

341

the left end were trimmed, sequences with length lower than 50 bp and sequences with average

342

quality QV25 were removed.

343

Genome assembly, variant calling and global dataset: Quality filtered data further assembled

344

using reference-based mapping with CLC Genomics Workbench 12. Mapping was done using

345

stringent parameters with length fraction to 0.99 and similarity fraction 0.9. Mapping tracks were

346

used to call and annotate variants. Variants with minimum allele frequency 30% with minimum

347

coverage 10 reads were considered. For comparative analysis with the global dataset of 57,043

348

complete viral genomes and 974 viral genome isolates from India were downloaded from GISAID

349

flu server (https://www.gisaid.org/), as accessed on 4th July, 2020.

350

Phylogenetic analysis: A total of 361 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes sequenced in our research

351

laboratory, as described in the above sections, were analyzed for the phylogenetic distribution. The

352

reference genome, Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (EPI_ISL_402125) was downloaded from GISAID flu

353

server, which was sampled on 31st Dec 2019 from Wuhan, China. Additionally, three more viral

354

genomes were included in the phylogenetic analysis Wuhan/WH01/2019 (EPI_ISL_406798,

355

sampled on 26 Dec 2019, Male, 44 yrs.), Wuhan/WIV04/2019 (EPI_ISL_402124, sampled on 30
