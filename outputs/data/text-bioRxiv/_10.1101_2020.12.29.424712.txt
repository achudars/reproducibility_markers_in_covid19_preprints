ABSTRACT
In 2020 we suffered from a major global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Efforts to contain the virus include the development of rapid tests and vaccines, which require a
ready supply of viral proteins. Here we report the production of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins by
transient transformation of tobacco, leading to high expression within three days, and subsequent
purification of the intact proteins. Such efforts may help to develop testing resources to alleviate
the major impacts of this global pandemic.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on global health and economic productivity. A
major limitation in the management of the pandemic has been limited availability of testing, which
can be performed by PCR or by immunological testing. The latter is a better indicator of whether
a patient is developing and will maintain immunity to the virus, and requires the production of
viral proteins to test for patient antibodies.
Production of heterologous proteins in plants is a well-developed technology that has
already been commercialized in several countries. For example, the first FDA approved Ervebo
vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease was made in tobacco (Merck). A common
approach is to use transient expression in a tobacco species, Nicotiana benthamiana (Bally et al.,
2015), which is rapid and can be scaled up to commercial scale production (Fischer et al., 2013).
In addition, optimized vector systems that boost expression of target proteins have been developed
(Norkunas et al., 2018; Sainsbury et al., 2009), leading to the production of up to several grams
per kilogram of tobacco tissue. This production requires less specialized infrastructure than other
protein production systems, and is easily scalable.
Here we report the production of two SARS-CoV-2 proteins using transient expression in
tobacco. We compare different expression systems and codon optimized constructs, and show that
high levels of expression can be obtained in just a few days, and that recombinant proteins can be
purified using routine epitope tagging. Such approaches can help protein production for basic
research as well as applied applications such as development of diagnostics and vaccine
production.

RESULTS
To rapidly express SARS-CoV-2 proteins in plants, we chose Nicotiana benthamiana as a
convenient expression host. We focused on two surface proteins of the virus, the spike and the
nucleocapsid (N) proteins, which are likely to generate immune responses, and therefore most
useful for diagnostic testing or vaccine development. For spike protein expression, we based our
design on an approach optimized for expression in mammalian cells, lacking the transmembrane
domain, and with amino acid substitutions to avoid proteolytic cleavage and to promote assembly
of the trimeric spike complex (Wrapp et al., 2020). Since the spike protein is very large, and could
pose problems for expression, we also cloned constructs to express the receptor binding domain
(RBD) because it is likely to be a primary domain for immune responses. Each construct was
generated by amplification from the mammalian codon optimized template, or by synthesis of
tobacco codon optimized clones. We used Gateway cloning (Thermo Fisher) to insert the different
fragments into a vector along with epitope tags, including mCitrine (mCit), or a modified Flash
Tag (2xStrepII-6xHis-3xFlag; Pedmale et al., 2016) and all were expressed under the control of a
double cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (2x35S, Figure 1). We also cloned
fragments containing a 8xHis-2xStrepII tag into the pEAQ.HT DEST1 vector, which is designed
to maximize expression in N. benthamiana (Sainsbury et al., 2009). After sequence verification,
the constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium, and cultures used to infiltrate tobacco plants,
either by syringe infiltration or by submerging whole plants in an Agrobacterium suspension in a
vacuum chamber (Stephenson et al., 2018). Following infiltration, plants were sampled at different
time points to find the optimal expression of the tagged proteins, either by confocal microscopy
for the mCit tagged clones (Figure 2), or by western blotting (Figure 3). For mCit tagged spike
constructs, we observed the “full length” protein at the cell periphery, as well as in a perinuclear
and reticulate pattern, reminiscent of endoplasmic reticulum, as expected. However, it was not
clear if the protein was secreted, because it remained associated with the plasma membrane
following plasmolysis (Figure 2C). The RBD-mCit fusion protein appeared to localize
cytoplasmically, in as yet unidentified mobile puncta (Figure 2E, Supp movie). We used western
blotting to confirm that the proteins were intact and of the expected size, and also to find the
optimal expression period. Expression was highest at three days after infiltration when spike was
expressed in pB7m34GW, and at five days when expressed in pEAQ.HT. In summary, full length

and RBD domain spike proteins accumulated to high levels in tobacco, and were correctly
localized.
We next asked if codon optimization could enhance production of spike protein. The fulllength and RBD coding sequences were optimized to match tobacco codon usage, resulting in a
score of 0.78, compared to 0.64 for the mammalian optimized clone. We also changed the signal
peptide from the original viral one, to ones that are efficiently processed in tobacco; from alpha
amylase for the RBD domain or Pathogenesis-related protein 1b (PR1b) for full-length spike
protein (Streatfield et al., 2001; Tuboly et al., 2000). The tobacco codon optimized clones were
next inserted into the same expression vector, and infiltrated into tobacco plants. Protein
expression using the tobacco-codon optimized RBD clone was higher than that of the mammalian
optimized clone, as expected (Figure 3B). To our surprise, however, expression of the full-length
tobacco optimized spike protein was lower than that of the mammalian optimized version (Figure
3C), so we proceeded to use the latter for affinity purification. We next vacuum infiltrated whole
tobacco plants to collect several grams of expressing tissue, and used Strep-Tactin XT resin to
purify spike proteins, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Despite using tens of g of
tissue, purification was inefficient, leading to ~ 100 µg of purified protein. In several purification
attempts, we recovered an average of ~7.5 µg of spike protein /g of tissue. Although purification
was inefficient, spike protein appeared to be present as a trimer (Figure 3D), suggesting that it
folded properly. We observed trimer formation even under denaturing conditions because the
fibritin trimerization motif is resistant to denaturing agents such as high temperature and Bmercaptoethanol (Yang et al., 2002).
We used a similar approach for expression of N protein. N-mCitrine was readily observed
in tobacco leaf epidermal cells 1-day post infiltration (Figure 4A) by fluorescence wide-field or
confocal microscopy, and localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The nuclear N-mCit
protein was often found in puncta (Figure 4A). N. benthamiana also expressed high levels of NFlash protein, but attempts to purify it using its strepII-tag with the Strep-Tactin resin failed.
Similarly, efforts to purify it using its 6xHis-tag with cobalt IMAC beads under a variety of
conditions were unsuccessful. It is likely that the epitope tag in N-Flash was not accessible in our
capture methods, and therefore we used a C terminally tagged Flash-N construct for subsequent

purifications. Flash-N (Figure 4C) expressed readily, similar to N-Flash and N-mCitrine, and high
levels of expression were detected (Figure 4C). We employed the strepII-tag on Flash-N and Streptactin resin to purify it from total protein lysates prepared from leaves 3-days post infiltration. We
observed improved binding and subsequent purification of Flash-N protein (Figure 4D), indicating
that the position of the tag is important for purification from in planta systems.
In summary, we show that we can successfully express SARS-Cov-2 proteins in tobacco.
Other recent reports (Diego-Martin et al., 2020; Makatsa et al., 2020; Margolin et al., 2020;
Rattanapisit et al., 2020) indicate similar results. The rapid and high level of expression makes this
an attractive system for larger scale production for research, or development of tests or of vaccines.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we used N. benthamiana plants as a heterologous system to produce recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The rapid expression, ability to produce large amounts of protein, and
easily scalable system make this an attractive method to generate SARS-CoV-2 proteins for
diagnostic tests and as potential vaccine candidates (Capell et al., 2020).
We successfully purified recombinant spike and Nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 proteins from
N. benthamiana at a concentration comparable to other studies (Diego-Martin et al., 2020; Makatsa
et al., 2020; Margolin et al., 2020; Rattanapisit et al., 2020). The spike ectodomain was purified in
both monomeric and trimeric forms, suggesting that it was folding properly. Additionally, we
confirmed that the spike ectodomain localized to the ER, where protein glycosylation occurs
(Strasser, 2016). The spike protein is heavily glycosylated, and future work should examine
whether these modifications occur correctly in plants (Watanabe et al., 2020). Together, our data
support the idea that plants are a suitable eukaryotic system for recombinant production of SARSCoV-2 proteins. Indeed, other studies have used plant-produced SARS-CoV2 antigens in ELISA
assays to detect human antibodies, as well as monoclonal antibodies produced in planta,
demonstrating their efficacy in diagnostics (Diego-Martin et al., 2020; Makatsa et al., 2020;
Rattanapisit et al., 2020).

We were surprised that a tobacco codon optimized spike construct expressed at lower levels
than the mammalian codon optimized version, but several other reports expressing mammalian
proteins in tobacco have yielded similar results (Maclean et al., 2007; Margolin et al., 2020;
Mortimer et al., 2012). In contrast, however, the tobacco codon-optimized RBD construct
produced more protein than the mammalian codon-optimized version. The two tobacco codonoptimized spike constructs were synthesized with different signal peptides, which could explain
the difference in protein accumulation. We also tested two vector backbones, pEAQ.HT, which
contains a single 35S promoter, and pB7m34GW with 2x35S promoter, and found that spike
ectodomain expression levels were similar. This was surprising, since pEAQ.HT contains the 5’
and 3’ UTRs of cowpea mosaic virus to boost expression levels (Sainsbury et al., 2009). Despite
the fact that expression levels were similar, pEAQ.HT has the P19 gene silencing suppressor
incorporated into it, making it simpler to work with for large scale infiltrations.
While our yield of SARS-CoV-2 proteins from tobacco was modest compared to other
expression systems, plants still offer several advantages as a heterologous system for protein
production. Producing recombinant proteins in plants can easily and affordably be scaled up
compared to other systems, offering decentralized capabilities in times of rapid demand for
diagnostics (Diego-Martin et al., 2020). Although more research is needed to fully understand the
dynamics of COVID19 immunity, recent studies indicate that protective immunity may only last
over a period of months (Poland et al., 2020). This suggests we may need repeated vaccinations to
offer protective immunity to a global population, necessitating affordable vaccine candidates.
Future work should also explore the potential of plant-based oral vaccines to combat SARS-CoV2, as these are a cost-effective alternative suitable for repeated dosages (Chan and Daniell, 2015).

METHODS
Cloning
We used Gateway cloning (Thermo Fisher) to generate spike and Nucleocapisd constructs
for expression in N. benthamiana. Mammalian codon-optimized entry clones were generated by
PCR amplification of spike ectodomain vector as a template (Wrapp et al., 2020) using Phanta
High Fidelity polymerase (Vazyme). This mammalian codon-optimized sequence contained the

and Flash-tag in pDONR-221 to obtain 2x35Spro::Flash-N. Similarly, 2x35Spro::N-mCitrine and

Four- to five-week old N. benthamiana plants grown in long-day growth conditions were
infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens suspended to an optical density of 0.5 – 1.0 in
infiltration medium (10 mM MES, pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2) containing 150 µM acetosyringone
using either syringe or vacuum infiltration at 2 days post infiltration, unless otherwise indicated.
For vacuum infiltrations, whole plants were submerged in agrobacterium suspensions in a vacuum
chamber, and a vacuum pressure of approx. 30 in. Hg was applied for 3 minutes, until all leaves
were visibly infiltrated with the bacterial solution.
The pB7m34GW constructs were co-infiltrated with p19 expressing constructs to suppress
gene silencing in N. benthamiana.
Confocal microscopy
N. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing SARS-CoV-2 proteins were imaged using a
Zeiss LSM 900 confocal microscope. The objectives used for imaging were as follows: EC PlanNeofluar 10x/0.30 NA M27, Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 NA M27, LD LCI Plan-Apochromat
40x/1.2 NA Imm Korr DIC M27, C Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.4 NA.
For plasmolysis experiments, leaves were incubated in 0.75 M sorbitol for 15 minutes, and
counterstained with propidium iodide to visualize the plasma membrane. mCitrine was imaged
using 488 nm excitation, and the emission wavelength collected was from 410 – 546 nm.
Chlorophyll autofluorescence was imaged using 640 nm excitation, and emission wavelength
collected was from 650 – 700 nm. Propidium iodide was excited at 561 nm, and emission
wavelength collected was from 598 – 617 nm.
Protein extraction, affinity purification, and immunoblotting
To assess protein levels, two 0.75 mm leaf punches were ground and boiled for 10 min in
75 µL of 2X SDS loading buffer containing 5 % B-mercaptoethanol. 20 µL of the crude extract
was loaded onto a 1 mm thick 8% SDS-PAGE gel, run for 2 hours at 80 V, and then transferred
onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon) for 30 V overnight at 4 º C. Blots were dehydrated with a 10
second incubation in methanol, followed by drying for 15 min at room temperature. They were
next incubated in primary antibody solution for 2 hours at room temperature (1:1000 anti-Strep,
IBA Life Sciences, 1:10,000 anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, Sigma in 2% milk Tris buffered saline, 0.1% Tween (TBST)), followed by three ten minutes washes in TBST. Then, blots

were incubated for 1 hour in the secondary antibody solution (ECL Anti-mouse conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase, 1:10,000, GE in 2% milk), followed by three ten-minute washes in TBST.
Immunoblots were developed using Amersham Prime ECL Western blotting reagent (GE) and
imaged using autoradiography film.
For spike protein affinity purification, frozen N. benthamiana tissue was ground using
either a mortar and pestle or Nutriblend bullet blender (2 min blend) in three volumes of extraction
buffer per gram tissue (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X, protease inhibitor cocktail).
Samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 g, and the supernatant was passed through
Miracloth to remove debris. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min, and the
supernatant loaded onto a column containing Strep-Tactin XT resin (IBA Life Sciences) and
protein was purified according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Purification and detection of N protein. 3 days post infiltration, N. benthamina leaves were flash
frozen in liquid N2 and then ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle and resuspended
1:4 ratio in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with 1´ protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore Sigma) and
100 µg/avidin. The lysate was gently rotated for 5 min at 4°C and then sonicated at 45% intensity,
with 0.5 second on and off pulses for a total of 30 seconds. The lysate was then filtered through
miracloth and centrifuged at 20,000´g for 15 minutes. Pre-washed Strep-Tactin XT resin (IBA
Life Sciences) was then added to the cleared lysate and gently rotated at 4°C for 1 hr. The resin
was then washed 3 times with RIPA buffer and eluted with 1´ Strep-Tactin elution buffer with
biotin (IBA Life Sciences). The input, flow-through and eluted protein samples were then boiled
with 2´ LDS sample buffer for 5 minutes before performing Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE).
After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were immobilized on to a reinforced nitrocellulose
membrane (Millipore Sigma) with 1´ NuPage transfer buffer (Thermo Fisher) containing 10%
methanol. The membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk prepared in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 10 minutes and then incubated for 1 hr with
anti-Flag-HRP (Sigma) at 1:5000 dilution in 1% milk in TBST with gentle shaking at room
temperature. The membrane was then washed three times for 10 minutes each with TBST and

Figure 1. Spike constructs generated in this study. Mammalian codon-optimized (A), or tobacco
codon-optimized (B - C) spike ectodomain coding sequences were used to clone constructs. All
constructs lacked the C-terminal transmembrane domain and have amino acid substitutions that
abolish the proteolytic cleavage domain between the S1 and S2 subunits (RRAR>GSAS). A cterminal fibritin trimerization motif (purple) promotes trimerization in the absence of the
transmembrane domain. The tobacco codon-optimized full-length spike has a pathogenesisrelated 1b (Pr1b) signal peptide (pink) in place of the native spike signal peptide (SP), and the
RBD domain has an alpha amylase (AA) signal peptide (yellow). Mammalian codon-optimized
spike coding sequences were cloned into pB7m34GW destination vector with a 2x35S promoter
and either a C-terminal mCitrine or FlashTag (containing a Strep-His-Flag epitope, D). The
mammalian-optimized full-length spike CDS with a C-terminal 8xHis-2xStrepII tag was also
cloned into pEAQ.HT DEST1, which contains P19 and cowpea mosaic viral UTRs to maximize
expression in tobacco. Tobacco codon-optimized sequences were cloned into pEAQ.HT DEST1
(E), with a C-terminal 8xHis-StrepII tag, to maximize expression levels.

Figure 3. Expression and purification of spike proteins in tobacco. (A) Mammalian codonoptimized RBD proteins were detected using anti-FLAG antibody and were higher at three days
post infiltration (DPI) and guide optimal expression conditions. (B) Expression levels of N.
benthamiana codon-optimized (tob-opt) RBD in the pEAQ.HT expression vector were higher
than the mammalian codon-optimized version (mam-opt) in pB7m34GW. Proteins were detected
using the anti-Strep antibody, which is less sensitive than anti-FLAG. (C) Expression levels of
mammalian-optimized spike ectodomain were comparable between pEAQ.HT and pB7m34GW.
The tobacco-codon optimized spike ectodomain in pEAQ.HT DEST1 was expressed lower than
the mammalian-optimized spike. Proteins were detected using anti-Strep antibody. NS, nonspecific band, DPI, days post infiltration, AS, acetosyringone concentration. (D), For affinity
purification, total protein was extracted from N. benthamiana leaves vacuum-infiltrated with
Agrobacterium containing the mammalian-optimized spike-His-Strep, and spike protein was
purified using Strep-Tactin XT resin. Dashes indicate putative trimer and monomeric bands.
Spike protein was detected via western blot using the anti-Strep antibody.
