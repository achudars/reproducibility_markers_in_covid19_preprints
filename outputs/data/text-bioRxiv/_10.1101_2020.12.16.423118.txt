Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein needs to be in an open-state conformation to interact with ACE2 as
part of the viral entry mechanism. We utilise coarse-grained normal-mode analyses to model the
dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 Spike variants. Our
results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an
increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same
effect for several mutations on Glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and
N501, including the N501Y mutation, explaining the higher infectivity of the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 strains.
This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal-mode analysis to model conformational state transitions
and the effect of mutations thereon. The specific mutations of Spike identified here may guide future
studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and guide public health in
their surveillance efforts.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus pandemic has emerged as a major and urgent issue affecting individuals, families
and societies as a whole. Among all outbreaks of aerosol transmissible diseases in the 21st century, the
COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) virus [1,2], has the highest infection and death cumulative numbers - 83 million infections and over
1.8 million deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological report of
January 5, 2021 [3]. Recent WHO reports also show significant weekly increases in the number of
infections and deaths as countries start to face upcoming waves of the disease. In 2003 the SARS
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic caused 8,098 infections and 774 deaths before it was brought under
control [4,5]. In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak
caused 2499 infections and 858 deaths, presenting the highest fatality rate [6]. SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV and MERS-CoV, as coronaviruses in general, present considerable mutation rates, which may
contribute to future outbreaks. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have a mutation rate close to
the ones presented by MERS-CoV [7] and by SARS-CoV [8], as well as other RNA viruses, showing a
median of 1.12 × 10−3 mutations per site per year [9]. The high mutation rate may in part be responsible
for the zoonotic nature of these viruses and points to a clear risk of still-undetected additional members
of the coronavirideae family of viruses making the jump from their traditional hosts to humans in the
future.
The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Uniprot ID P0DTC2) is responsible for anchoring the virus to the
host cell. The entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineages of human coronaviruses is the human
cell-surface protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Uniprot ID Q9BYF1) [10]. Therefore,
studying the Spike protein family is essential to understand the evolution of coronaviruses.
SARS-CoV-2 Spike is a homo-trimeric glycoprotein, with each chain built by subunits S1 and S2,
delimited by a furin cleavage site at residues 682-685. The S1 subunit comprises the N-terminal Domain
(NTD), located in the peripheric part of the extramembrane extreme, and the Receptor Binding Domain
(RBD), the most flexible site, located in the central part of this same extreme. The S2 subunit consists of
the fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), the transmembrane domain (TM),
and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) (Figure 1). The interaction between Spike and ACE2 relies on Spike to be
in its open conformation, in which the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) is extended [11]. The study of
the binding properties between Spike and ACE2, although important, cannot explain all the nuances of
the infection mechanism. An example of this limitation is the comparison between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, which have different rates of infection even though they share similar Spike-ACE2

affinities [12]. These facts lead us to consider the contribution of the dynamics of the Spike protein to
the infection process.

Computational structural biology methods have grown in both accuracy and usability over the years
and are increasingly accepted as part of an integrated approach to tackle problems in molecular biology.
Such integration permits to speed up research, decrease needs in infrastructure, reagents, and human
resources and allows us to evaluate increasingly larger data sets. Computational approaches are being
extensively used in the study of SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanisms of infection [13-15]. Among these,
we highlight the study of dynamic properties of the Spike protein as well as in antibody recognition and
the search for therapeutic interventions [16-18].
Several aspects of the dynamics of the Spike protein are being currently studied, with a range of
particular goals: to evaluate the docking of small molecules to the RBD domain [19], to search for
alternative target binding-sites for vaccine development [20], to understand residue-residue interactions

and their effects on conformational plasticity [21] and to investigate the flexibility of different domains
in particular conformational states [22].
Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) methods are being employed in the study of different conformational
states [23] and of different coronavirus variants [24]. These methods, however, are limited with respect
to their ability to study the effects of mutations on dynamics due to the fact that such methods are either
extremely taxing on computational resources (e.g., molecular dynamics) or agnostic to the nature of
amino acids (e.g., traditional coarse-grained NMA methods). In the past, our group developed a coarsegrained NMA method called ENCoM (for Elastic Network Contact Model) that is more accurate than
alternative coarse-grained NMA methods due to the explicit consideration of the chemical nature of
amino acids and their interactions and consequently their effect on dynamics [25]. ENCoM performs
better than other NMA methods on traditional applications and is the only coarse-grained NMA method
capable of predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability and function as a result of dynamic
properties [26-28].
In this study, we use the ENCoM method to study the dynamics of the Spike protein, considering
different conformational states and several sequence variants observed during the current pandemic, as
well as through large-scale analysis of in silico mutations. Experimental analysis of the effect of the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation D614G and the comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike
proteins show unique dynamic characteristics that correlate with epidemiological and experimental data
on infection. The present work shows that we can replicate such results computationally, suggesting that
rigidity or flexibility of different Spike conformational states affects infectivity. We present a high
throughput analysis of simulated single amino acid mutations on dynamic properties to seek potential
hotspots and individual Spike variants that may be more infectious and therefore may guide public health
decisions if such variants were to appear in the population. We also introduce a Markov model of
occupancy of molecular states with transition probabilities derived from our analysis of dynamics that
recapitulates experimental data on conformational state occupancies. This is the first application of an
NMA method that derives transition probabilities from normal modes and employs them in a dynamic
system to predict the occupancy of different conformational states. We model the occupancy of several
variants and highlight those that may be useful in studying future epidemiological trends that can be
responsible for new outbreaks.

We performed our analyses using the crystallographic models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in
the open (PDB ID 6VYB) and closed (PDB ID 6VXX) states. The open (prefusion) state was designed
with an abrogated Furin S1/S2 cleavage site and two consecutive proline mutations that improve
expression [29]. Despite the mutations, the engineered structures correctly represent the conformational
states of Spike, as confirmed by independently solved structures [23,30]. The PDB structures used for
the SARS-CoV comparison were 5X58 and 5X5B for closed state and one RBD open state, respectively
[31].
We removed heteroatoms, water molecules, and hydrogen atoms from the PDB structures. Missing
residues were reconstructed using template-based loop reconstruction and refinement with Modeller [32].
Single amino acid mutants were generated using FoldX4 [33]. ΔΔSvib and occupancy calculations were
performed with reconstructed closed and one-RBD-open structures using as template 6VXX and 6VYB.
These engineered structures contain the GSAS sequence in the Furin cleavage site as well as two prolines
in positions 986 and 987. In order to minimize potential artefacts in the calculations due to modelling
errors, we chose to model all mutations and subsequent calculations using the above engineered
structures and sequences unless otherwise noted. That is to say, when we refer to the wild type SARSCoV-2 Spike protein in our calculations, it is the Spike protein with the above alterations in the Furin
recognition site as well as the pair of prolines. This choice in our methodology is made as stated to
decrease the possibility of modelling artefacts as the alternative would have required modelling 6
additional mutations to ‘de-engineer’ the structures of the open and closed states.
For the parameter fitting used in the calculation of occupancies, we utilized the following
experimentally determined structures for which occupancy data exists as follows (acronyms described in
results): S-GSAS/WT: 7KDG,7KDH; S-GSAS/D614G: 7KDI,7KDJ [30]; S-R/x2: 6ZOX; S-R/PP/x1:
6ZOY,6ZOZ; S-R: 6ZP0; S-R/PP: 6ZP1,6ZP2 [34].
2.2 Dynamic analyses
We analysed dynamic properties of the Spike protein with ENCoM [25]. ENCoM employs a
potential energy function that includes a pairwise atom-type non-bonded interaction term and thus makes
it possible to consider the effect of the specific nature of amino-acids on dynamics. NMA explores protein
vibrations around an equilibrium conformation by calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
associated with different normal modes [35-37]. Representing each protein residue as a single point, for
a given conformation of a protein with N amino acids, we obtain 3N - 6 nontrivial eigenvectors. Each
eigenvector represents a linear, harmonic motion of the entire protein in which each amino acid moves

along a unique 3-dimensional Euclidean vector. The associated eigenvalues rank the eigenvectors in
terms of energetic accessibility, lower values corresponding to global, more easily accessible motions.
NMA calculations allow us to computationally estimate b-factors associated with the protein
structure, as shown in Equation 1 for the ith residue, which in turn are related to local flexibility. Higher
predicted b-factors denote more flexible positions. Individually calculated b-factors are combined in a
vector for a protein sequence or part thereof and called Dynamic Signature.

The eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues can also be used to obtain a variable called vibrational
entropy that can be used to compare the relative stability of two states. For example, by measuring the
difference of vibrational entropy (ΔSvib) between a mutant and a wild type (WT), one can calculate how
much a mutation affects the overall flexibility and stability of the mutant relative to the WT. The ΔSvib
value predicted by ENCoM is positive when the mutation makes the protein more flexible and negative
when the mutation makes the protein more rigid. The differences between the ΔSvib values for closed and
open states were calculated for each mutant (ΔΔSvib = ΔSvib (open) – ΔSvib (closed)) in order to evaluate
individual mutations according to a single score. Vibrational Entropy calculations are dependent on the
thermodynamic b factor, that for pseudo-physical models such as ENCoM serves as a scaling factor. This
term was optimized to fit experimental Gibbs free energy differences [38] and established as b = 1. The
vibrational contribution of the entropic components of the free energy is calculated as described in Eq. 2
[39] in units of J.K-1, where N is the total number of amino acids in the protein, vi is the vibrational
frequency and KB is the Boltzmann constant. Equation 3 shows the association between eigenvalues and
vibrational frequency.

The Najmanovich Research Group Toolkit for Elastic Networks (NRGTEN) [38], with the latest
implementation of ENCoM, also includes a function to evaluate state occupancies by calculating
transition probabilities between different states. A probability Pj of moving along each eigenvector j can
be obtained using a Boltzmann distribution given its associated eigenvalue λ j and a scaling factor γ.

Let's consider two conformations A and B of the same protein and the vector EA®B, which represents
the conformational change going from conformation A to conformation B. The overlap between each
normal mode Mj computed from conformation A and the EA®B vector is a value between 0 and 1
describing how well that normal mode recapitulates the conformational change required to go from one
state to the other [40].

We can then calculate the transition probability of going from conformation A to conformation B as

The reverse probability PB®A can be computed in the same fashion, giving an indication of which
conformation is favored between the two.
A simple way of computing the occupancies of these conformations from the transition probabilities
is to use a Markov model. Each conformation is represented by a state, and the transition probabilities
between states are computed as described above. We add a constant k to all states as the probability of
staying in that state. Since all states must have outgoing transition probabilities that sum to 1, we
normalize these values after the addition of k. For a two-state Markov chain representing the open and
closed states of the Spike protein, we obtain the diagram shown in Figure 2. All transition probabilities
are computed using ENCoM and Eq. 6. The parameters k and γ need to be optimized for the system being
studied as they are not directly coupled to physical quantities because of the pseudo-physical, coarsegrained nature of the ENCoM model. Once the parameters are set, there is a unique equilibrium solution
that gives the occupancies of the two states. This approach could be easily generalized to a Markov model
with more than two states, where the transition between any two states is computed exactly as described
above if that transition is deemed possible.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Dynamic Signature of different Spike variants
3.1.1. G614 and D614 dynamic comparison
An important event in the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic was the appearance of the D614G
variant in mid-February 2020 in Europe. The fast spread of this variant raised the possibility that this
mutation conferred advantages relative to other forms of the virus in circulation at the time [41,42].
Studies revealed that the mutation has indeed greater infectivity, triggering higher viral loads [43,44].
Several hypotheses have emerged to explain the mechanisms behind this higher infectivity primarily
focused on possible effects on the Furin cleavage site [30,45,46], but recently also considering possible
important dynamic differences [44,47,48].
In order to test if Dynamic Signatures reveal differences between Spike variants, we analysed the
13741 sequences of the protein available on May 08 in the COVID-19 Viral Genome Analysis Pipeline,
enabled by data from GISAID [49,50]. The mutant Spike proteins harboring mutations (Table S1) were
modelled in the open and closed states. Dynamic Signatures were calculated for each mutant in both
states and clustered (Figure 3). Mutations in positions that had no occupancy in the original templates
used for the open and closed states (positions 5, 8, and 1263) were ignored.

Analysis of the effect of mutations on the Dynamic Signature show that the D614G mutation
produces similar dynamic patterns largely independent of the other mutations accumulated, and dynamic
patterns that are distinct from that of the wild type and other mutants on both the open and closed states.
The dynamic characteristics of D614G are very specific and cannot be obtained with random mutations
(Figure S1, Table S2). Performing the clustering using segments of the Dynamic Signature representing
lengths of 100 amino acids identifies a section of the Spike protein from around position 250 to around
position 750, responsible for the unique characteristics that the mutation D614G confers to the dynamics
of the Spike protein (data not shown). This section of Spike includes part of the N-Terminal Domain
(NTD) and all of the RBD domain.
When checking the difference between the Dynamic Signatures of the wild type D614 and the mutant
G614 we observe that for the closed conformation, the pattern tends towards negative values, indicating
that this mutation makes the closed state more flexible, especially around the position of the mutation.
On the other hand, for the open B chain conformation the pattern is positive for the open RBD, the same
chain NTD and the adjacent chain NTD, indicating that this mutation makes these areas of the open
conformation more rigid (Figure 4).

as represented in the colours of the structures. The coordinate axis counts residues linearly through the three Spike subunits.

This result led us to hypothesize that a more flexible closed state would favor the opening of Spike
and that a more rigid open state would disfavor its closing, thus shifting the conformational equilibrium
towards the open state and favouring interaction with ACE2, leading to increased cell entry. Mutating
position 614 to every other amino acid, we observe a correlation in the closed state between residue size
and flexibility. Namely, smaller amino acids tend to make the closed state more flexible. However, we
do not observe the opposite effect on the open state. Mutation of D614 to Glutamine, which is similar to
Aspartate, barely shows any effect. Nevertheless, we can see that other amino acids have a similar effect
as Glycine, such as Proline and Threonine (Figure S2).
3.1.2. Comparison of the Dynamic Signatures of Spike from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
It has been previously observed that RBD flexibility in SARS-CoV influences binding to ACE2 and
facilitates fusion with host cells [51]. Thus, considering the lesser infectivity of SARS-CoV relative to
SARS-CoV-2 and our aforementioned results for the D614G mutation, we expected the SARS-CoV
Spike to be more rigid in the closed state and more flexible in the open state relative to Spike from SARSCoV-2. This is indeed the case (Figure 5). The dynamic signature values of SARS-CoV are smaller than
those of SARS-CoV-2 in several areas throughout the closed structure, indicating that when in the closed
state, the SARS-CoV Spike protein is more rigid. For the open state we can see that SARS-CoV open
RBD and adjacent NTD are significantly more flexible than for SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

open B chain RBD (blue) between aligned residues of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with SARSCoV chains represented in the top bar and equivalent colors in the structures and SARS-CoV-2 chains represented in the bar
just below. The coordinate axis counts residues linearly through the three Spike subunits.

3.2. Vibrational entropy
It is possible to combine the trend of a Dynamic Signature into a single value to represent the overall
flexibility of any given mutation and compare it to the WT. This can be achieved with ΔSvib, calculated
with Eq. 2 for each state (see materials and methods). For any given state, positive ΔSvib values represent
mutants that relative to the wild type make the protein more rigid, whereas negative values of ΔSvib
describe mutations that cause the protein to be more flexible in the given state relative to the wild type.
In the case of the mutation D614G, we obtain ΔSvib (open) = 5.26x10-2 J.K-1 and ΔSvib (closed) = -9.27x10-2
J.K-1 with a ΔΔSvib (calculated as ΔSvib (open) – ΔSvib (closed)) of 1.45x10-1 J.K-1.
We generated in silico the 19 possible single mutations in each position from residue 14 to residue
913 and calculated ΔSvib (open), ΔSvib (closed) and ΔΔSvib. Other positions were ignored due to uncertainties
in modelling or the fact that they are not expected to have a pronounced effect on dynamic [23]. It should
be noted that Spike cannot accommodate the vast majority of such single mutations, particularly in its
core as these would lead to unstable or misfolded conformations. However, those that occur near the
surface are more likely to represent single residue variations of the Spike protein that lead to a stable,
correctly folded protein. Therefore, the stability of specific mutations highlighted in this work, unless
otherwise stated (such as those already observed experimentally or within the RBD domain as stated
below), needs to be validated experimentally.
The heatmap in Figure 6A shows ΔSvib values associated with mutations on the closed
conformational state (left) and open conformational state (right). Lighter colors represent high ΔSvib
values, meaning that the specific mutant is more flexible than the WT, and darker colors represent low
ΔSvib values, meaning that the specific mutant is more rigid than the WT. The second heatmap (Figure
6B) shows ΔΔSvib values, or Difference Scores, highlighting positions and specific mutations with great
contrast between their effect on the open and closed states. In this representation, blue mutants are more
rigid in the closed state and more flexible in the open state, therefore candidates for less infectious
mutants, and red mutants are more flexible when closed and more rigid when open, candidates for more
infectious mutants.

In Figure 7 we map ΔΔSvib values (Figure 6B) on the structure of Spike, colored according to the
median value for each position with the same color scheme as the heatmap. From the 17081 single
mutations considered, we show the top 64 mutants with with ΔΔSvib>0.3 (Tables 1 and S3) as well as the
bottom 20 in terms of ΔΔSvib values (Table S3). The mutants with predicted open state occupancy higher
than that of the wild type are presented in Table 1. The Dynamic Signature comparison for 3 of those
most infectious candidates (Figure 8A) and 3 of the least infectious candidates (Figure 8B) shows some
of the patterns that could lead to a greater or lesser effect on infectivity. For instance, in Figure 8A we
can see that high scores can come from a large flexibility of the closed state, a very large rigidity of the
open state, or have the contribution of both. We can also observe that these effects can be different in
each chain and can affect more the NTD, the RBD, or both. Finally, these single mutants also show how
a point mutation can have widespread impacts across the protein.

unclear if any additional conformational states other than those with either all three RBD domains in the
closed state or only one RBD open state are biologically relevant. Specifically, Yurkovetskiy et al. [44]
observed an occupancy for states with two or three RBD domains in the open conformation, but these
were not observed by Gobeil et al. [30] and Xiong et al. [34] or taken into consideration in several other
structural studies [20-24]. As such, we employ the two-state model shown in Figure 2, with one state
representing all three RBD domains closed and the second state representing one RBD open. We
calculated the robustness of this Markov occupancy model utilizing 60 different reconstructed structures,
varying the positions of loops and with minor differences in the core structure, representing the closed
state and the open state for each chain. The results are equivalent no matter what specific structural
template is used to represent each of the two states above.
The Markov model calculation of occupancies requires two parameters (see Materials and Methods)
that were optimized based on experimental data for six Spike variants. These variants were: SGSAS/D614, an engineered Spike with the sequence GSAS in the furin cleavage site and no 614
mutation; S-GSAS/G614, with the same furin site modifications and the D614G mutation [30]; S-R, the
Spike protein with original furin site RRAR; S-R/x2, with added S383C, D985C mutations inducing a
disulfide bond; S-R/PP, engineered with two prolines in positions 986 and 987; S-R/PP/x1, in which
from the double prolines sequence the mutations G413C, V987C were performed to induce a disulfide
bond [34]. It is worth stressing that all 6 variants used to calibrate the two parameters affecting the
occupancy were modelled on the same open and closed state conformations. All differences in observed
occupancies and the agreement with experimental occupancy data came about as a consequence of the
effect of the mutations on the normal modes and derived transition probabilities and not as a result of
structural differences between variants. We obtained a good fitting to the experimental results with k and
g of 0.5 and 0.001, respectively (Pearson correlation = 0.89, p-value = 1.94x10-2). Predicted occupancies
of the open and closed states for each of the six variants above, as well as the experimental data, are
presented in Table 2.

We utilized this data to calculate occupancy differences for each variant (Figure 9). The range of
variation of our predicted occupancies is small compared to that of experimental values. We believe that
given the limitations of our coarse-grained model as well as additional phenomena that ultimately affect
occupancy, our predictions reflect only a fraction of the myriad of factors contributing to the occupancy.
Nonetheless, our predictions correctly capture the pattern of relative variations of occupancy observed
in the experimental data. To ensure that the calculated correlation is not due to chance, we simulated
random sets of occupancies for the 6 sequence variants and calculated simulated correlations for the 110
different combinations of k and g to determine if the observed correlations represent an actual signal in
the data or could be randomly obtained with different values for the parameters k and g. We observed a
marked shift with higher correlations for the data representing our predicted occupancies when compared
to the gaussian noise data (Figure S3), suggesting that the predicted occupancies are not due to chance.

The computational resources needed for the calculation of occupancies for all 8250 mutations with
ΔΔSvib>0 is beyond our current capabilities. We set a threshold of ΔΔSvib>0.3 to select candidates for the
calculation of occupancies. This threshold corresponds to 64 mutations (Table 1, in red). Using the
parameters k and g obtained above, we calculated occupancies for these 64 mutants as well as the 20
mutants with lowest ΔΔSvib values (Table 1, in blue). In Figure 10A we show the difference in occupancy
between the open and closed states using a non-linear scale adapted to better show the results around the
wild type occupancy. Whereas ΔΔSvib values for particular mutations may hint at a more flexible closed
state and more rigid open state, this is a global measure that may not reflect the necessary pattern of
flexibility across the structure that leads to effective transition probabilities between the open and closed
states. Yet, for the most part, ΔΔSvib can predict the shifts in occupancy, showing a clear distinction
between the 64 mutants predicted using ΔΔSvib as shifting occupancy towards the open state and the 20
mutants predicted to shift the equilibrium towards the closed state (p-value=2.04x10-6). Figure 10B
shows the location in the structure of the mutants in Table 1. We can see that the least infectious
candidates (blue) are positioned in the interfaces between NTD and RBD domains, while the most
infectious candidates, especially the ones validated by the occupancy prediction (dark red), are more
concentrated in the interfaces between different RBD domains.

Residue G252 stands out as capable of accommodating a large number of mutations (C, D, E, H, M,
P, Q, S, T, W) that shift the occupancy in favour of the open state. The fact that variants in this position
do not seem to be prevalent in outbreaks to date, points to the possibility that this position may be under
additional functional constraints that prevent the emergence of variants. A number of other Glycine
residues also could accept mutations that we predict to increase the occupancy of the open state: G72W;
G404W; G413M; G416E,W; and G404I. In fact, three of the top four mutations are mutations on Glycine.
A number of other potential mutations are adjacent to Glycine residues above. Namely, R403S and
K417D,E,G,P. Additionally, D467P,W and I468T are also positions that are adjacent to others that can
accommodate mutations that may lead to a conformational shift favouring the open state. The mutation
that favours the open state the most in our calculations is N501W with ΔSvib (open) = 6.02x10-1 J.K-1 and
ΔSvib (closed) = 2.30x10-1 J.K-1 and a resulting ΔΔSvib value of 3.72x10-1 J.K-1 leading to occupancies
compared to those of the wild type (in parenthesis) of 62.7% (25.8%) and 37.3% (74.2%) for the open
and closed states respectively. It is important to stress, as discussed in methods, that the calculations are
performed using structures containing a modified Furin recognition site and prolines in positions 986 and
987. Furthermore, the contribution of vibrational entropy changes is one among potentially several
effects whose overall importance remains to be determined. Therefore, relative changes in occupancy are
relevant whereas the specific values are less so.
The COG-UK consortium (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/about/) monitors the appearance and
spread of new strains of SARS-CoV-2. COG-UK recently detected a strain containing the mutation
N501Y that has been observed to be spreading rapidly at the time of writing. We believe that shifts in
occupancy may be in part responsible for its emergence. According to our calculations, the N501Y
mutant shows ΔSvib (open) = -1.60x10-2 J.K-1 and ΔSvib (closed) = 2.37x10-1 J.K-1, with ΔΔSvib = 2.53x10-1
J.K-1. The predicted occupancies for the N501Y mutant compared to those of the wild type (in
parenthesis) are 54.3% (25.8%) and 45.7% (74.2%) for the open and closed states, respectively.
Therefore, the N501Y mutant shows a marked increase of the occupancy of the open state relative to
other mutations. Additionally, this mutation was shown to also increase binding affinity to the ACE2
receptor relative to the wild type with a Δlog10(KD,app) of 0.24 [52]. Therefore, we predict that N501Y
has a strong potential to contribute to increased transmission. The calculations above were performed in
the context of D614. However, the double mutant representing the N501Y mutation in the context of
G614 also shows an increase in the occupancy of the open state to 35.06%. The recently observed A222V
mutation on the other hand [53], does not show in our analysis any propensity of altering the occupancy
of states with a negative ΔΔSvib of -1.64x10-2 J.K-1. Predicted occupancies for A222 and V222 are nearly
identical either in the context of D614 (WT) or the mutant containing G614.

Notice that N501Y has a ΔΔSvib value of 2.53x10-1 J.K-1 that is slightly below the 3.00x10-1 J.K-1
threshold, suggesting that there may be many other mutations with ΔΔSvib values below our set threshold
that turn out to have augmented occupancies for the open state relative to the wild type.
D614G shows that changes in the occupancy of conformational states can impact infectivity despite
no changes or even weaker binding affinities [44]. A recent study [52] on binding and expression of
Spike mutations within the RBD domain (positions 331 to 531) shows that several (but not all, see below)
of the mutations that we predicted to have increased occupancy of the open state are associated with a
decrease of binding affinity with ACE2. Incidentally, the data also shows that the mutations in Table 1
within the RBD produce stable and properly folded Spike proteins. As shown for D614G, infection does
not rely on binding affinity alone, and even a strain with higher dissociation rates from ACE2 can bring
about fitness advantages.
The mutation N501W is predicted to have the largest effect in augmenting the occupancy of the open
state relative to the wild type. This mutation is associated with stronger binding to ACE2
(Δlog10(KD,app)=0.11) [52] relative to the wild type Spike (but lower than N501Y). Furthermore, N501W
appears to have increased expression relative to the wild type with a Δlog(MFI) of 0.1 compared to
decrease in relative expression of -0.14 for N501Y [52]. The authors note that changes in expression
correlate with folding stability [52]. However, even with a Δlog(MFI) of -0.14, N501Y is viable and
spreading. Therefore, N501W might be even more stable and infective.
We consider all mutations with increased predicted occupancy of the open state in Table 1 as good
candidates for further experimental validation to better understand the role of binding and dynamics of
Spike and their role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Furthermore, we suggest that their appearance in
outbreaks should be closely monitored.
3.4. SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.1.7 and 501.V2
The mutation N501Y above appears in both the B.1.1.7 variant first observed in the UK [54] as well
as the 501.V2 variant first observed in South Africa [55] that rapidly spreading around the globe. These
two strains contain additional mutations in Spike. Namely B.1.1.7 contains N501Y, A570D, D614G,
P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H and deletions on positions 69, 70 and 144. As the number of normal
modes is related to the number of amino acids, we are unable to model deletions while still making
comparisons with the wild type strain given the nature of the quantities calculated (Eq. 2 and 6).
Therefore, the deletions of three residues at positions 69,70 and 144 that are present in B.1.1.7 were not
modelled here. 501.V2 includes the mutations L18F, D80A, D215G, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y,

D614G, A701V. The dynamic signatures for both B.1.1.7 as well as 501.V2 show a strong rigidification
of the open state and added flexibility of the closed state (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5 respectively)
leading to ΔΔSvib values of 5.30x10-1 J.K-1 and 6.45x10-1 J.K-1 and open state occupancies of 36.2% and
35.8%, for B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 respectively. Both variants show an increase in occupancy of
approximately 40% relative to the wild type (25.8%). Despite our preference of modelling the smaller
number of mutations and therefore using the engineered structure containing the modified Furin binding
site and proline modification, we also modelled B.1.1.7 (except the deletions) and 501.V2 using the
original sequence of Spike. In that case we obtain 33.0% and 33.6% occupancy for B.1.1.7 and 501.V2,
respectively.
3.5. Polyclonal human serum antibody escape
Recently the Bloom group utilised human serum antibodies from subjects that recovered from
COVID-19 and tested mutations in the RBD for their capacity to escape recognition [56], i.e. mutations
leading to weaker binding to polyclonal serum antibodies. The presented patterns of escape vary between
subjects but a number of positions and specific mutations at those positions are relevant to the present
study. Positions Y369, N448, F456, Y473 and F486 are noteworthy as specific mutations at these
locations not only allow varying levels of escape in particular subjects [56] but also lead to positive
values of ΔΔSvib above a threshold of 0.1 J.K-1 (Table S4). Among these, the mutations N448G; Y473
mutations to A, Q and T; and lastly, F486E all show occupancy of the open state modestly higher than
that of the wild type (Table S4). The mutations noted, by virtue of potentially increasing infectivity as
well as displaying varying levels of escape to immune responses, may give the virus an evolutionary
edge and therefore should be closely monitored.
3.6. Data Availability
Raw data and structures used to build the images presented here are available in a Github repository

visualisation and analysis through a link to the dms-view open-access tool, available on GitHub [57]

ΔΔSvib values, one of them being zero (corresponding to the amino acid found in the wild type). The

4. Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2 mutations are still arising and spreading around the world. The A222V mutation,
reportedly responsible for many infections, emerged in Spain during the Summer of 2020 and since then
has spread to neighbor countries [53]; In Denmark, new strains related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission in
mink farms were confirmed in early October by the WHO and shown to be caused by specific mutations
not previously observed with the novelty of back-and-forth transmission between minks and humans
[58]. A new strain containing N501Y first appeared in the UK and is now on the rise worldwide at the
time of writing. Such occurrences point to the possibility that new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 may bring
about more infectious strains.
Using the methods described in this paper, it is possible to predict potential variants that might have
an advantage over the wild type virus insofar as these are the result of changes in occupancy of states
and with the limitations of the simplified coarse-grained model employed here. In our analyses, flexibility
properties and conformational state occupancy probabilities contribute to the infectivity of a SARS-CoV2. Our results explain the behaviour of the D614G strain, the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2
relative to SARS-CoV as well as offers a possible explanation for the rise of new strains such as those
harboring the N501Y mutation.
The results we present on SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutations have several limitations. First and foremost,
some of the in silico mutation discussed may not be thermodynamically stable, may affect expression,

and the sugar molecules may have an effect on dynamics. However, the remarkable agreement between
our model and experimental observations shows that the simplified model of Spike and the coarsegrained methods used here allow us to calculate dynamic properties of Spike that are relevant to
understand infection and epidemiological behavior. It is important to keep in mind that all of the
mutations that we discuss in Table 1 that lay within positions 331 and 531 within the RBD domain were
already experimentally validated and are viable [52]. However, we highlight the need for experimental
validation of our predictions particularly for those candidates that we believe would help elucidate the
extent of the effect of the conformational dynamics of Spike on infectivity. Beyond in vitro biophysical
studies, experimental alternatives exist such as using pseudo-type viruses or virus-like-particles that
would not require studying gain-of-function mutations using intact viruses. Alternatively, loss-offunction mutations can be created with intact viruses and compared to the wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus
to validate the role of dynamics on infectivity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a Normal Mode Analysis method is used to
model the effect of mutations on the occupancy of conformational states opening a new opportunity in
computational biophysics to create dynamic models of transitions between conformational states of
proteins based on physical properties and sensitive to sequence variations. We hope that our results help
public health surveillance programs decide on the risk posed by new strains, contribute to inform the
research community in understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and open new possibilities in
computational biophysics to study protein dynamics.
