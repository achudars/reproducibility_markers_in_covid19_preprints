Abstract
COVID-19 that emerged as a global pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus
genome analysis during disease spread reveals about its evolution and transmission. We did
whole genome sequencing of 225 clinical strains from the state of Odisha in eastern India
using ARTIC protocol-based amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis identified the
presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The
analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe
and South-east Asia followed by local transmission. Interestingly, 19B clade was found to be
much more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) as compared to other genomes
reported so far from India. The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and
19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A
and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it
to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March
and April. We found that with the time 20A and 20B clades evolved drastically that originated
from central Europe. At the same time, it has been observed that 20A and 20B clades
depicted selection of four common mutations i.e. 241 C>T (5’UTR), P323L in RdRP, F942F
in NSP3 and D614G in the spike protein. We found an increase in the concordance of G614
mutation evolution with the viral load in clinical samples as evident from decreased Ct value
of spike and Orf1ab gene in qPCR. Molecular modelling and docking analysis identified that
D614G mutation enhanced interaction of spike with TMPRSS2 protease, which could impact
the shedding of S1 domain and infectivity of the virus in host cells.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus belonging to the coronaviridae
family. The first occurrence of this novel coronavirus was observed in Wuhan, China in late
December, 2019 which later spread globally via human-to-human contact transmission [1] .
According to the COVID-19 dashboard by Johns Hopkins University the virus has spread to
more than 180 countries with 14.1 million total confirmed cases and 600,000 deaths
worldwide [2].The first occurrence of coronavirus case in India was observed in mid-January
but the number of cases started to increase from the first week of March. According to
official sources the number of cases in India has reached 1.2 million with 29,000 deceased.
Genomic studies performed to understand the origin of SARS-CoV2, a positive single
stranded RNA virus, unravelled that it has a zoonotic origin and is transmitted to humans
from bats via malayan pangolins [3] .The nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV2 is ~79%
similar to SARS-CoV1 and about 50% with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) [1]. Approximately 30 kb genome of SRAS-CoV2 features a cap structure in 5’
and 3’ poly (A) like other members of the coronavirus family. Major portion of the genome is
covered by two ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) which codes for 15 non-structural proteins
including crucial proteins required for viral replication like viral proteases nsp3, nsp5 and
nsp12 also known as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) [4]. The gRNA also codes
for structural proteins like spike protein(s), nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M)
and envelope protein (E) required for packaging of the virus and at least accessory proteins
but their ORFs are still not experimentally validated [4].
The entry of viral particles in the human body occurs through binding with angiotensin I
converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor present on lung epithelial cells [5]. The predominant
infection site is respiratory tract due to route of infection. Other than lungs it is known to
infect other organs of the body such as kidney, liver and intestine as ACE2 expression is
found to be quite high. After the viral entry into host cells, to initiate viral replication first

negative-sense RNA intermediates are synthesized by RdRP activity, these templates are
then utilized for synthesis of gRNA and sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs) [4]. Because of the
low-fidelity of RdRP, mutations are incorporated with high frequency in gRNA [6] and often
such mutations are known to increase the pathogenicity and fitness of the virus [7],[8].
Recently a predominant mutation i.e. D614G in spike protein has been identified in virus
strains sequenced from European population [8].There are several reports depicting that
D614G mutation in spike protein is associated with enhanced infectivity and spread of the
virus owing to increased interaction with ACE2 receptor present on host cells [8]. It has also
been indicated that this mutation is present on the S2 domain of spike protein that is
important for cleavage by TMPRSS2 enzyme for cleavage of S1 for facilitating the fusion of
the viral spike with the host cell membrane [8, 9]. It is indeed interesting to understand
further at molecular level, the changes in protein structure induced by this mutation and its
functional association with the infectivity and disease severity.
At the same time, it has been reported that D614G mutation co-occurs with 3 more mutation
i.e. 241 in UTR, 3307 and 14408 [8]. The functional significance of these co-occurring
mutations in evolution and selectivity of virus is interesting to understand.
In the present study we have sequenced 225 COVID-19 isolates from patient samples from
the state of Odisha those migrated from 13 most affected Indian states as a part of DBT's
PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV2 RNA genome sequencing consortium, using amplicon
sequencing based methodology. The travel history of these patients was collected along with
their symptomatic and asymptomatic behaviour. We performed phylogenetic analysis from
sequenced data to understand the genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV2 in the
Indian subcontinent. From the sequenced isolates we have identified 247 single nucleotide
variants most of them are observed in ORF1ab, spike and nucleocapsid protein coding
region. Moreover, we have analysed the D614G mutations in the samples to obtain
information on its evolution in Indian population. Protein-modelling analysis of D614G
mutation was carried out to identify the impact on structural changes at protein levels. We
further performed protein-protein docking simulation to predict the impact of D614G mutation

on the interaction between of wild-type and mutated spike protein with TMPRSS2 enzyme to
assess its impact on binding and perhaps viral infectivity.

Results
Demographics, clinical status and travel history
The average age of the 225 subjects were 30.98 ± 11.79 years with age range 1-75 years
and median age of 30 years. The overall gender ratio of male: female was 201: 24 with
median age of male subjects 31.75 years and 24.5 years for female subjects
(Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B). Almost every female subject in this study reported no strong
symptoms during sample collection whereas in case of the male subjects we found that the
numbers of symptomatic cases were almost same with the number of asymptomatic cases
(Supplementary Figure 1C). For the samples in our study, we didn’t observe any fatality in
the subject group to our knowledge.
Majority of the subjects (89%) disclosed their travel history during the sample collection
procedure. We found that the majority of the subjects included in the study were found to
migrate from Gujarat, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala and Andhra
Pradesh state in India (Supplementary Figure 1D). As most of the subjects did not had any
direct foreign travel (n = 1) history the primary source of infection is local contacts in their
workplaces and this helped us to understand the COVID-19 strain diversity in the most
affected states of India (Supplementary Figure 1D).

Mutation analysis
After filtering out low quality samples with <5% N’s in the assembly and at least 10x average
coverage we observed a total of 247 single nucleotide variants from 202 SARS-CoV2
isolates. Out of these variants 156 variants observed only in single isolates, 25 variants were
classified as common variants with occurrence in more than 5% isolates and 19 variants as
rare with 2-5% occurrence in all samples (Supplementary Table 1). Among the common

variants the most frequent mutations are 23403 A>G (D614G, S gene), 241 C>T (5’ UTR),
14408 C>T (P4715L, RdRP gene), 3037 C>T (F942F, NSP3), 28881 G>A (R203K, N gene),
28882 G>A (R203R, N gene), 28883 G>C (G204R, N gene), 28144 T>C (L84S, ORF8) with
presence in more than 15% of all of our sequenced samples (Supplementary Table 1).
Plotting mutation diversity (>2%) in a clade wise manner we observed distinct mutation
signatures in different clades. The isolates that were grouped in 19A clade depicted
prevalence of mostly ORF1ab mutations with one distinct N gene C>T mutation at 28311
position (Figure 2C). In clade 19B samples we observed a very distinct ORF8 T>C mutation
at 28144 position, two N gene mutations at position 28326 and 28878 with some ORF1ab
mutation in lower frequency (Figure 2C). Clade 20A and 20B has almost similar mutation
profile with major mutated positions 241 C>T mutation in leader sequence, ORF1ab 3037
C>T, ORF1ab 14408 C>T (RdRP) and S gene 23403 A>G mutations. The very distinct
characteristic that we observed for 20B clade is three consecutive N gene mutations at
position 28881, 28882 and 28883 (Figure 2C). Out of these three mutations two are
missense mutations resulting in change of protein sequence. In clade 20A we observed two
mutations at ORF3a and M protein coding gene at position 25563 G>T, 26735 C>T but in
less frequencies in comparison with other mutated sites (Figure 2C). Overall, to conclude we
summarised all the mutated sites present in all the samples and observed ORF1ab is the
most mutated region followed by N gene, S gene and ORF8 in SARS-CoV2 samples from
India (Figure 2A). Among the ORF1ab mutation 4715 P>L change in nsp12 also known as
RdRP (the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase) was the most prevalent one followed by a
synonymous change (F924F) in nsp3 protein (Figure 2B).

Haplotype network analysis
First we created a median-joining haplotype network to look for transmission within India we
observed two major branches (Supplementary Figure 2A). When we coloured the sequences
with clade information the branched represented 19A and 20A which later furcate into 19B,
20B and 20C (Supplementary Figure 2A). When we overplayed migration information in the

network we observed majority of 19A and 19B isolates migrated from Gujarat (Figure 3A).
Migration of isolates identified in newly prevalent clades occurred from southern path of India
(Figure 3A). To understand the source transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in India, we
constructed haplotype networks using sequencing data combined with genome sequences
from the countries (China 15, Germany 23, Italy 25, Saudi Arabia 23, Singapore 14 and
South Korea) from where the migration of individuals has occurred to India. From the
haplotype network we observed distinct clusters of genome sequences that were grouped in
4 major nodes. A large group of sequences clustered in two major haplotype clusters one
with genome sequences from China, Singapore, South Korea and the other one with Italy,
Saudi Arabia and Germany with 2-4 nucleotide substitutions (Figure 3B). From the collection
date we observed that 20A clade which is prevalent in Europe, became abundant in Odisha
from April representing the top cluster, while the bottom cluster represents samples
belonging to clade 19A, 19B having a common origin in South-east Asia (Figure 3B).

Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis was carried out with 202 high quality SARS-CoV2 sequences that
revealed presence of four major clades i.e. 19A (n = 39), 19B (n = 36), 20A (n = 73), 20B (n
= 60) and one minor clade 20C (n = 4) (Figure 1 A). To understand the abundance of clades
with time, we plotted cumulative counts of clades against the sample collection date and
observed the introduction of clade 20A occurred in April, 2020 with parallel emergence of
19A, 19B and 20B in May (Figure 1B). After May no new occurrence of clade 19A or 19B
were observed in our data but in mid-June we started to observe emergence of 20C clade
(Figure 1B). Further to understand the transmission of the virus in our subjects, we
performed phylogenetic analysis of our dataset with 1042 high coverage Indian SARS-CoV2
whole genome sequences (N <1%) obtained from GISAID on 12th July 2020
(Supplementary Figure 1F). From the transmission map generated using Nextstrain, we
observed that most of the sequences in 20A clades share sequence similarity with samples
from Gujarat, which has very high prevalence of this clade (Supplementary Figure 1E). The

19A clade is very prevalent in Delhi and Telangana region and Tamil Nadu but the 20B
clade is only prevalent in the southern parts of India (Supplementary Figure 1E). Both 20A
and 20B clade predominantly contain a mutation in Spike protein coding sequence
23403A>G and the mutation is traced back to the West European region in late January [8].
The missense mutation in spike protein coding gene causes a change in 614 D>G position
of Spike protein and reported to increase the shedding of S1 subunit of the protein which
leads to the increased infectivity [8]. To understand the prevalence and effect of G614 in our
sequencing dataset we plotted week wise count (based on collection date) of D614 and
G614 and observed that the occurrence of the mutation has been observed in early march
(12th week) and the cumulative frequency increased over the time (Figure 4A). Every sample
we sequenced as a part of the study was also checked for the levels of ORF1 and S gene
using quantitative PCR. The Ct obtained is also a direct indicator of viral load (lesser the Ct,
higher the viral load) in the individual. When we plotted the Ct values of all sequenced
samples, we observed that except week of 21 the Ct values of the isolates having G614
mutation is less in comparison to isolates having D614 (Figure 4B, 4C). We also had Ct
values (ORF1, S gene) of 637 positive isolates available as a partner institute of the
COVID19 surveillance program in Odisha, India. Plotting the data against the date of sample
collection for testing, we observed a sharp and significant (p<0.05) decline (median ~5 Ct
change) in the Ct values (Figure 4E) from April, 2020 to May 2020 and there was median ~1
Ct change of S gene as well as ORF1ab (Figure 4D, 4E, 4F) from month of May to June
2020. In the case of ORF1 expression we also observed a sharp change between April and
May but there is almost no change between May to June 2020 (Supplementary Figure 2A).
When we overlaid the clinical status information (Asymptomatic vs symptomatic), we
observed that isolates from clade 20A, 20B and 20C depicted higher number of symptomatic
patients (Figure 1C). Although without the information about predisposition of complication in
patients it’s hard to establish an association between mutations and the clinical
manifestations.

Protein structure analysis
To understand the impact of identified prominent missense mutations (present on >10% of
the samples) on the annotated viral proteins in our sequenced population, we used protein
crystal structures and protein models as crystal structures were not available. The

stereochemistry. First, we looked into the location of the mutated amino acid with respect to
its functional domains as any change in the functional domain has high probability to perturb
the protein function. The sites of mutation on the modelled protein structures (Nucleocapsid,
NPS3, NSP4b, NSP6, ORF8 and RdRP) are marked to indicate their location (Figure 2D2F). As reported in earlier publications, we also noticed D614G as highly prevalent mutation
in highly transmitted and evolved strains belonging to clades 20A and 20B in Indian
scenario, therefore we carried out molecular modelling analysis. It was observed that the
wild-type (D614) and mutated form (G614) of Spike protein showed a slightly different
arrangement of structural elements near the mutation site, which is present in hinge region
linking S1 and S2 domain i.e. S1 furin cleavage site (Figure 4G). The S2 domain of the
Spike protein is reported to interact with TMPRSS2 protease necessary for shedding of S1
domain for viral entry inside the host cells by facilitating the merging of virus with the host
cell membrane. The proteolytic cleavage of spike protein by TMPRSS2 results in the
formation of two fragments S1/S2, which is one of the key steps of the virus infection in host
cells. The Spike protein contains a hydrogen bond between T859-D614 keeping S1 and S2
domains together (Figure 4H). The mutation of Asp to Gly at 614 eliminates this hydrogen
bonding (Figure 4I) which enables a more favourable orientation of Q613 that may facilitate
cleavage by TMPRSS2 by perturbing its affinity with S2 domain. It has also been proposed
that D614 forms an intra-salt bridge with R646 which makes the conformation unfavourable
for S1 association with S2 domain [9]. Interestingly, the protein docking analysis suggested
better hydrogen bonding interactions between the spike protein cleavage sites (Arg685,
Ser686) with the catalytic triad of TMPRSS2 in mutant condition as compared to wild-type. In
the case of mutant Spike protein, the Arg682 and residues at primary cleavage site of Spike

protein (Arg685 and Ser686) formed six hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu299, Lys300,
Asp338, Gln438 residues of TMPRSS2 (Figure 5A, 5B). Whereas in the D614 wild-type form
there were five hydrogen bonds observed between the cleavage site of Spike protein S2
domain and TMPRSS2 (Figure 5C, 5D). The binding energy was observed to be better for
the G614 mutant (-143.03 kcal/mol) as compared to that of the wild type (-113.67 kcal/mol)
indicating better binding of TMPRSS2 with the mutant Spike protein (Figure 5E).

Discussion
The pattern of COVID-19 pandemic spread in India is quite different from all over the world
in term of slow transmission and lower mortality rates in the begining. Therefore, it was
extremely important to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV2 and its
evolution during different phases of disease in India. The mutations that accumulate in the
virus genome with time acts as a molecular clock that can provide insight into emergence
and evolution of the virus. These analyses could be helpful to prevent or control the
transmission of the virus. To track the COVID-19 outbreak and understand the genomic
clades of SARS-CoV2 prevalent in India as compared to rest of the world, we performed the
genome sequencing of isolates collected from the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal
swabs of individuals migrated from different regions of India to the state of Odisha after the
reported incidences of COVID-19 pandemic in India.
For SARS-CoV2 genome sequencing, we did amplicon-based sequencing for 225 SARSCoV2 genomes to capture the major clade diversity in India. We selected migrant groups
from different parts of the country so that diversity of COVID-19 virus prevalent in the country
could be captured in the phylogenetic analysis, to understand disease transmission and
virus evolution with time. The sequenced samples represent migratory populations from
North, East, West and Southern parts of India. Our analysis depicted that all the genomes
analysed in our study were grouped into 4 major clades 19A, 19B, 20A and 20B according to
the new Nextstrain clade nomenclature. The clade 19A is the Wuhan clade from China.
Interestingly, we were able to capture occurrence of a rare clade with very less occurrence in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217430; this version posted July 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

India i.e. 19B with 17% (n=36) in our samples. This clade was found to be prevalent in East
and South-east Asia during early outbreak of the pathogen. This confirmed that the
foundation of the source of early outbreak infection in India also came from South-east Asian
countries. The migration information for these early collected samples were not well defined
therefore, it was difficult for us to exactly pinpoint from which South-east Asian country the
transmission of 19B started. The mutation analysis depicted that both 19A and 19B clades
almost evolved in parallel as prevalent mutations in both the clades are highly variable. On
the other side, the phylogenetic analysis showed that clades 20A and 20B evolved quite
rapidly in the Indian population and are major source of disease transmission in the country.
Whereas 20C strain is rarely detected and appeared to be less adapted or somehow
contracted by contact tracing at early stages of infection. The haplotype network construction
also pointed to the later strains belonging to 20A, 20B clades originated from Western
Europe and transmitted directly or via Saudi Arabia are mostly prevalent in the southern and
western part of India. In the clade we also observed a very less frequent clade 20C only
prevalent in a handful of the Middle-eastern countries makes up a marginal portion (n=4) of
our sequenced samples. This suggests the requirement of constant monitoring of COVID19
isolates with sequencing technology to understand the source of infection and design
prevention mechanisms like strategic lookdowns and region specific travel restrictions.
The fitness of the virus strain and its transmission depends on the adaptive mutations that it
acquires with time. We found that four common variants i.e. 241 C>T in the UTR region,
3037 C>T in NSP3 gene, 14408 C>T in the NSP12 and 23403 A>G in S gene co-evolved
mostly in the 20A and 20B clade. As 20A, 20B clade frequency increased with time in the
population, which indicates that these strains have some selective advantage with time for
increased transmission. It has been reported that the leader sequence present in the UTR
region of positive strand RNA viruses like SARS-CoV is important for the replication and
strand switching to generate negative strands [4]. This mutation in leader sequence is 20
nucleotides upstream of translation start site of ORF1ab gene. Therefore, it might be
providing an advantage to virus in preventing stem loop generation required during strand

switching by RdRP, which needs further experimental evaluation. At the same time, several
reports documented that 23403 A>G (D614G) missense mutation in the Spike protein
enhanced the infectivity rate of the virus. One of the reports showed that the shedding of S1
domain of Spike protein changes due to change in the hydrogen bonding between S1-S2
domain. We observed in our protein modelling analysis that, TMPRSS2 binding to Spike
protein is enhanced by this mutation of Aspartic acid to Glycine (D614G) as it resulted in
increased hydrogen bonding interactions. This change enhances the interaction of
TMPRSS2 with the S2 domain, which is important for the cleavage of the S1 domain and
virus entry into cells by facilitating its entry into the host cells. The overall primary in-silico
docking study showed that mutant Spike protein has a greater number of hydrogen bonds
with TMPRSS2 at the cleavage site as compared to the wild type resulting in better docking
energy. Overall analysis indicates that the breakage of a hydrogen bond as a result of the
mutation may facilitate greater cleavage of the mutant spike protein as compared to the wild
type. All the sequenced genomes were submitted in the GISAID database.

Materials & Methods
Sample collection
All hospitalized and quarantined patients (March, 2020 to June, 2020) based on their clinical
symptoms (fever or respiratory symptoms) or travel history, were preliminarily involved in this
study. We received throat swabs in viral transport media (VTM) samples of these patients
used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Patients absent of or with negative SARS-CoV-2 test
results were excluded from this study based on Ct values obtained by qPCR of isolated
RNA. All patients involved in this study were residents of Odisha, India, during the outbreak
period of COVID-19.

Viral load detection
RNA isolation for all the 248 human subjects were performed using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 52906). The isolated RNA was subjected to qPCR for determining viral

load by Ct values. For qPCR we performed one-step multiplex real time PCR using
TaqPath™ 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat. No. A28526) targeting
3 different gene-specific primer and probe sets - envelope glycoprotein spike (S),
nucleocapsid (N), and open reading frame 1 (ORF1).

Viral DNA library preparation & sequencing
We prepared a viral DNA library for viral genome sequencing using QIAseq FX DNA Library
Kit (Qiagen, Cat. no. 180475) as instructed by the manufacturer’s manual and the library
was subsequently sequenced using Illumina platform. The adapter sequence used for each
sample was compatible with Illumina sequencing instrument with 96-sample configurations
(Qiaseq unique dual Y-adapter kit). The average insert length was in the 250-500bp range.
Prepared libraries were then pooled as a batch of 96 samples and sequenced using Illumina
NextSeq 550 platform in 150 x 2 layout.

Raw data pre-processing:
Quality of the sequenced files were checked using FastQC tool (0.11.9) [11] , followed by
removal of low quality bases (--nextseq-trim, Q<20), Illumina Universal adapter sequence
and reads with less than 30bp length using Cutadapt(2.10) [12]. To access the quantity of
host genomic DNA and other contaminants Kraken (2.0.9-beta) [13] was used and the
reports were summarised using Krona(2.7.1)[14]. All the files were then aligned to human
genome (assembly versionGRCh38) using HISAT2 (2.2.0)[15] and unmapped reads were
extracted

using

SAMTOOLS(1.10)[16]

and

converted

to

FASTQ

format

using

BEDTOOLS(2.29.2) [17] bamToFastq option.

Alignment with viral genome:
The unmapped reads were then aligned to SARS-CoV2 reference assembly (NCBI
accession NC_045512) using HISAT2 (2.2.0) [15]. Amplicon primes from the aligned file
were removed using iVar (1.2.2)[18]

guided by

Artic Network V3 primer scheme

(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV2019/V3). The aligned files were then de-duplicated using Picard Tools (2.18.7,
https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

Alignment

quality

was

checked

using

SAMTOOLS(1.10)[16] flagstat option.

Consensus sequence generation and variant calling:
Consensus sequence for each isolate was generated using Bcftools(1.10)[19] and SEQTK
(https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). After generating a reference-based consensus sequence we
selected 202 isolates with <5% N’s and more than 10x coverage for phylogenetic and
mutation analysis. Single nucleotide variants were called and filtered (QUAL > 40 and DP
>20) using Bcftools (1.10) [19]. Effect of the filtered variants were annotated using SnpEff
(4.5)[20] . All of the consensus sequences were deposited in GISAID[21] (Supplementary
table 1).

Phylogenetic analysis:
Phylogenetic tree of samples were performed using SARS-CoV-2 analysis protocol
standards and tools provided by Nextstrain [22] pipeline. First all the sequences are aligned
against the WH01 reference genome using Augur wrapper of MAFFT[23] and low quality
variant sites are masked from the alignment. Initial tree was generated using Augur tree
command using IQTREE algorithm[24]. The primary tree was further refinement of the tree
was done using Augur refine command and the tree was rooted using the reference
sequence with timeline information incorporation using TimeTree[25]. To finalize the tree for
Nextstrain auspice visualization the tree was annotated using ancestral traits, clades,
nucleotide mutation and amino acid mutation. The resulting tree was visualized using an
Auspice instance.

Haplotype network analysis
For haplotype network analysis we took a total of 287 (China 15, Germany 23, Italy 25,
Saudi Arabia 23, Singapore 14 and South Korea) SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences
with less than 1% N and with collection date of March, April and May from GISAID database.
The selected samples are then aligned to the WH01 reference genome using MAFFT[23]
After filtering aligned sequences we used POPART [26]software to generate haplotype
network using Median Joining method with 2000 iterations.

Modelling of the protein structures
The sequences of SARS-CoV2 proteins (NPS3, NSP4b, NSP6, Nucleocapsid, and Spike)
were retrieved from NCBI. Since most of the proteins do not have a 3D structure in PDB,
they were modelled using Modeller9.21 [27]. The suitable templates for modelling of the
proteins (Supplementary Table 1) were selected by DELTA-BLAST[28] against the protein
data bank (PDB) proteins. One hundred models were generated for each of the proteins.
The best model was selected based on the lowest DOPE score [29]. The D614G mutant of
the spike protein was generated by Modeller9.21. The loop in spike protein (670-690) was
refined using loop modelling procedure in Modeller by generating 100 loop models. The
model with the lowest dope score was finally chosen for both the mutant and wild type
protein. Similarly, the host trans-membrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) was also
modelled using modeller. The PROCHECK [10] server was used to assess the
stereochemistry of the generated models.

Protein-Protein docking
The standalone version of HADDOCK2.2 [30] was used to perform protein-protein docking
with SARS-CoV2 spike protein with human TMPRSS2. The docking was conducted by the
restraining of the receptor (Spike) and ligand (TMPRSS2) residues known to be at the
interface Spike-TMPRSS2 interface. Specifically, residues within 5 Å of the reported
cleavage site (Arg685, Ser686) (Hoffman et al 2020) of the Spike and catalytic triad of

TMPRSS2 (H296, D345, and S441) and binding residue D435 were restrained to be at the
docking interface. A total of 100 docking poses were generated and ranked based on the
HADDOCK2.2 docking score [30], which is composed of Van der Waals energy, electrostatic
energy, restraints energy, etc. The best-ranked docking pose was visualized using Pymol.

Statistical analysis and plotting:
All the statistical analysis and plots were generated in R (3.6.1) statistical programming
language using ggplot2, dplyr, reshape2, lubridate, ggsci and ggpubr package available from
CRAN and Bioconductor (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyvers) repository.
