Abstract:
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an influenza-like disease with a respiratory route
of transmission, yet clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another
viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal
organoids, enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as
demonstrated by confocal- and electron-microscopy. Consequently, significant titers of
infectious viral particles were measured. mRNA expression analysis revealed strong
induction of a generic viral response program. We conclude that intestinal epithelium
supports SARS-CoV-2 replication.
One Sentence Summary: SARS-CoV-2 infection of enterocytes in human small intestinal
organoids
Main Text:
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV,
emerged in 2003 (1). Late last year, a novel transmissible coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was
noted to cause an influenza-like disease ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe
lung injury, multi-organ failure and death (2–4). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus
subgenus (genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae), together with SARS-CoV (5–7).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV receptor (8, 9). The spike
proteins of the two viruses both bind to ACE2, while soluble ACE2 blocks infection by
SARS-CoV-2 (10–13). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur through respiratory
droplets and fomites. In accordance, the virus can be detected in upper respiratory tract
samples, implicating the nasopharynx as site of replication. In human lung, ACE2 is

expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial type II cells and ciliated cells (14–16). Yet, highest
expression of ACE2 in the human body occurs in the brush border of intestinal enterocytes
(14, 17). Even though respiratory symptoms dominate the clinical presentation of COVID-19,
gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in a subset of patients (18, 19). Moreover, viral RNA
can be found in rectal swabs, even after nasopharyngeal testing has turned negative, implying
gastro-intestinal infection and a fecal–oral transmission route (20–22). Here, we have utilized
human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs) to study infection by SARS-CoV-2.
We first demonstrated that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 readily infect organoid-derived
human airway epithelium cultured in 2D (Fig 1A). The viruses targeted ciliated cells, but not
goblet cells (Fig. 1B-C). hSIOs are established from primary gut epithelial stem cells, can be
expanded indefinitely in 3D culture and contain all proliferative and differentiated cell types
of the in vivo epithelium (23). Of note, hSIOs have allowed the first in vitro culturing of
Norovirus (24). We exposed ileal hSIOs grown under four different culture conditions to
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. hSIOs grown in Wnthigh expansion medium (EXP) overwhelmingly consist of stem cells and enterocyte
progenitors. Organoids grown in differentiation medium (DIF) contain enterocytes, goblet
cells and low numbers of enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Addition of BMP2/4 to DIF (DIFBMP) leads to further maturation (25). In the final condition, we induced expression of
NeuroG3 with doxycycline to raise EECs numbers (JB and HC, unpublished; Suppl Fig 3D).
Samples were harvested at multiple timepoints post infection and processed for the analyses
given in Figs 2-5. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hSIOs as
assessed by qRT-PCR targeting the E gene and by live virus titrations on VeroE6 cells (Fig. 2
for lysed organoids; Fig. S1 for organoid supernatant). Infectious virus particles and viral
RNA increased to significant titers for both viruses in all conditions. As EXP medium
supported virus replication (Fig. 2A, E), enterocyte progenitors appeared to be a primary viral
target. Differentiated organoids (DIF; DIF-BMP) produced slightly (non-statistically
significant) lower levels of infectious virus (Fig. 2; Fig. S1). In organoids induced to generate
EECs, virus yields were similar to those in EXP medium (Fig. 2D, H). In differentiated
hSIOs, SARS-CoV-2 titers remained stable at 60 hours post infection, while SARS-CoV
titers dropped 1-2 log (Fig. 2B, C, F, G). The latter decline was not observed in infected
hSIOs grown in EXP. Culture supernatants across culture conditions contained lower levels
of infectious virus compared to lysed hSIOs, implying that virus was primarily secreted
apically (Fig. S1A-D). Despite this, viral RNA was detected readily in culture supernatants
correlating with the infectious virus levels within hSIOs (Fig. 2E-H; Fig. S1 E-H).
ACE2 mRNA expression differed greatly between the four conditions. EXP-hSIOs express
300-fold less ACE2 mRNA compared to DIF-hSIOs, when analyzed in bulk (Fig. S2). BMP
treatment induced 6.5-fold upregulation of ACE2 mRNA compared to DIF treatment alone.
Since this did not yield infection rate differences, the DIF-BMP condition was not analyzed
further.
To determine the target cell type, we then performed confocal analysis on hSIOs cultured in
EXP, DIF, or EEC conditions. We stained for viral dsRNA, viral nucleocapsid protein, KI67
to visualize proliferative cells, actin (using phalloidin) to visualize enterocyte brush borders,
DNA (DAPI) and cleaved caspase 3 to visualize apoptotic cells. Generally, comparable rates
of viral infections were observed in the organoids growing under the three remaining
conditions. We typically noted staining for viral components (white) in rare, single cells at 24
hours. At 60 hours, the number of infected cells had dramatically increased (Fig. 3A).

Infected cells invariably displayed proliferative enterocyte progenitor-phenotypes (EXP, Fig.
3B, top) or ApoA1+ enterocyte-phenotypes (DIF, Fig. 3B, bottom). Of note, SARS-CoV also
readily infected enterocyte precursors (Fig. S3A-B) as shown previously (26, 27). Some
infected enterocyte progenitors were in mitosis (Fig. S3C). While EEC-organoids produced
appreciable titers, we never observed infection of Chromogranin-A+ EECs (Fig. S3D-E). We
also did not notice infection of Goblet cells across culture conditions. At 60 hours, apoptosis
became prominent in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected enterocytes (Fig. S5).
ACE2 protein was readily revealed as a bright and ubiquitous brush border marker in hSIOs
in DIF medium (Fig. 3C). In hSIOs in EXP medium, ACE2 staining was much lower -yet
still apical- in occasional cells in a subset of organoids that displayed a more mature
morphology (Fig. 3C). In immature (cystic) organoids within the same cultures, the ACE2
signal was below the detection threshold. Percentage of infected organoids under EXP and
DIF conditions are given in Fig S4. Fig. S5 gives images and quantification of apoptotic cells
upon infection.
Unsupervised transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (26) was performed on selected
highly infected samples. Figure 4 shows two hSIOs, selected from 42 imaged hSIOs, 60 h
post SARS-CoV-2 infection. These differ in the state of infection: whereas the cellular
organization within organoid 1 was still intact (Fig. 4A entire organoid; intermediate
magnification B-D; high magnification E-K), many disintegrated cells can be seen in
organoid 2 (Fig. 4 Bottom (Fig. 4L entire organoid; intermediate magnification 4M-O; high
magnification 4P-R). Viral particles of 80-120 nm occurred in the lumen of the organoid (4I),
at the basolateral (4J) and apical side (4K) of enterocytes. The double-membrane vesicles
which are the subcellular site of viral replication (27) are visualized in Figure 4E and 4P. The
nuclei in both organoids differed from nuclei in mock-infected organoids by a slightly
rounder shape. The nuclear contour index (28) was 4.0+/-0.5 vs 4.3+/-0.5 for control set.
There was more heterochromatin (4N), and one or two dense nucleoli in the center (4O).
We then performed mRNA sequence analysis to determine gene expression changes induced
by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infection of hSIOs cultured continuously in EXP medium
and hSIOs cultured in DIF medium. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 elicited a broad signature
of cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) attributed to type I and III interferon
responses (Fig 5A, Supplementary table 1-2), as confirmed by Gene Ontology analysis (Fig.
5B). An overlapping list of genes appeared in SARS-CoV-2-infected DIF organoids (Fig. S6,
Supplementary table 3). RNA sequencing analysis confirmed differentiation of DIF
organoids into multiple intestinal lineages, including ACE2 upregulation (Fig. S7). SARSCoV also induced ISGs, yet to a much lower level (Supplementary table 4). Fig 5C visualizes
the regulation of SARS-CoV-2-induced genes in SARS-CoV infected organoids. This
induction was similar to infections with other viruses like norovirus (29), rotavirus (30) and
enteroviruses (31, 32). A recent study (33) describes an antiviral signature induced in human
cell lines after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the ISG response is broader in intestinal
organoids, the induced gene sets are in close agreement between the two datasets (Fig.
S8). One striking similarity was the low expression of Type I and III interferons: we only
noticed a small induction of the Type III interferon IFNL1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected
organoids. In SARS-CoV-infected organoids, we did not observe any type I or type III
interferon induction. We confirmed these findings by ELISA on culture supernatant and qRTPCR, which in addition to IFNL1 picked up low levels of type I interferon IFNB1 in SARSCoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV infected organoids (Fig. S9). The specific induction of IP10/CXCL10 and ISG15 by SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed by ELISA and qRT-PCR,
respectively (Fig. S10). As in (33), a short list of cytokine genes was induced by both viruses

albeit it to modest levels. For a comparison with (33), see Fig S11. Altogether these data
indicate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a stronger interferon response than SARS-CoV in HIOs.
Finally, the infection was repeated in a second experiment in the same ileal HIO line and
analyzed after 72 hours. Analysis involved viral titration (Fig S12), confocal imaging (Fig
S13) and RNA sequencing (Fig S14). This experiment essentially confirmed the observations
presented above. A limited, qualitative experiment applying confocal analysis demonstrated
infectability of two other lines available in the lab (one ileal, one duodenal) from independent
donors (Fig S13).
This study shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infect enterocyte lineage cells in a
human intestinal organoid model. It appears of interest that we see at least equal infection
rates of enterocyte-precursors and enterocytes whereas ACE2 expression increases ~1000fold upon differentiation at the mRNA level (Fig. S2). This suggests that low levels of ACE2
may be sufficient for viral entry. The scale of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic suggests
that this virus may continue to circulate in humans, causing yearly seasonal outbreaks. The
fact that SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus (after SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV) to jump to humans within less than 20 years suggests that novel zoonotic
coronavirus spillovers are likely to occur in the future. Despite this, limited information is
available on coronavirus pathogenesis and transmission. This is in part due to the lack of in
vitro cell models that accurately model host tissues. Very recently, it was already shown that
human iPS cells differentiated towards a kidney fate support replication of SARS-CoV-2
(13). Our data imply that human organoids represent faithful experimental models to study
the biology of coronaviruses.

Materials and Methods
Viruses and cell lines
Vero E6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), HEPES, sodium bicabonate, penicillin (10,000
IU/mL) and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. SARS-CoV
(isolate HKU 39849, accession no. AY278491) and SARS-CoV-2 (isolate
BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020; European Virus Archive Global #026V-03883; kindly
provided by Dr. C. Drosten) were propagated on Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL 1586™) cells in OptiMEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco), supplemented with penicillin (10,000 IU/mL) and
streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate
was obtained from a clinical case in Germany, diagnosed after returning from China. Stocks
were produced by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and
incubating the cells for 72 hours. The culture supernatant was cleared by centrifugation and
stored in aliquots at −80°C. Stock titers were determined by preparing 10-fold serial dilutions in
Opti-MEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX. Aliquots of each dilution were added to monolayes of 2 × 104
Vero E6 cells in the same medium in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four replicates were performed per
virus stock. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 5 days and then examined for cytopathic effect.
The TCID50 was calculated according to the method of Spearman & Kärber. All work with
infectious SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet under
BSL-3 conditions at Erasmus Medical Center.
Cell culture of human intestinal organoids
Tissues from the duodenum and ileum was obtained from the UMC Utrecht with informed consent
of the patient. All patients were males that were operated for resection of an intestinal tumor. A
sample from non-transformed, normal mucosa was taken for this study. The study was approved
by the UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands) ethical committee and was in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and according to Dutch law. This study is compliant with all relevant
ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants.
Human small intestinal cells were isolated, processed and cultured as described previously (23,
25). Instead of Wnt conditioned media, the medium was supplemented with Wnt surrogate (0,15
nM, U-Protein Express). This was termed expansion (EXP) medium. For differentiation towards
EECs, organoids were treated with 1 µg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) in ‘ENR’ medium (Beumer et
al., in press). General differentiation (termed DIF) was achieved in ‘ENR’. BMP activation was
achieved by withdrawing Noggin from ‘ENR’ and addition of BMP-2 (Peprotech, 50 ng/ml) and
BMP-4 (Peprotech, 50 ng/ml) (termed DIF+BMP).
Human airway organoid culture and differentiation
Adult human lung stem cells were derived from non-tumour lung tissue obtained from patients
undergoing lung resection. Lung tissue was obtained from residual, tumor-free, material obtained
at lung resection surgery for lung cancer. The Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus MC
Rotterdam granted permission for this study (METC 2012-512). Isolation of human bronchial
airway stem cells was performed using a protocol adapted from Sachs and colleagues (2019).
Bronchial tissues of adult lungs were cut into ~4mm sections, washed in Advanced DMEM
supplemented with GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher), HEPES, penicillin (10,000 IU/mL) and
streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL) (AdDF+++), and incubated with dispase (Corning) mixed with
airway organoid (AO) medium (34) at a 1:1 ratio for 1 hour at 37°C. The digested tissue
2

suspension was sequentially sheared using 10‐ and 5‐ml plastic and flamed glass Pasteur
pipettes. After shearing and filtering, lung cell pellets were then resuspended in 200 μL of
growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) and plated in ~30 μL droplets in a 48 well tissue
culture plate. Plates were placed at 37 degrees Celsius with 5% CO2 for 20 min to solidify the
Matrigel droplets upon which 250uL of media was added to each well. Plates were incubated
under standard tissue culture c
To obtain differentiated organoid-derived cultures, organoids were dissociated into single cells
using TrypLE express. Cells were seeded on Transwell membranes (Corning) coated with rat tail
collagen type I (Fisher Scientific). Single cells were seeded in AO growth medium: complete
base medium (CBM; Stemcell Pneumacult-ALI) at a 1:1 ratio. After 2-4 days, confluent
monolayers were cultured at air‐liquid interphase in CBM. Medium was changed every 5 days.
After 4 weeks of differentiation, cultures were used for infection experiments.
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Infection
Organoids were harvested in cold AdDF+++, washed once to remove BME, and sheared using a
flamed Pasteur pipette in AdDF+++ or TrypLE express, for undifferentiated and differentiated
organoids, respectively. After shearing, organoids were washed once in AdDF+++ before
infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in expansion or differentiation medium. After 2
hours of virus adsorption at 37°C 5% CO2, cultures were washed twice with excess AdDF+++ to
remove unbound virus. Organoids were re-embedded into 30 μL BME in 24-well tissue culture
plates and cultured in 500 μL expansion or differentiation medium at 37°C with 5% CO2. Each
well contained ~100,000 cells per well. Samples were taken at indicated timepoints by
harvesting the medium in the well (supernantant) and the cells by resuspending the BME droplet
containing organoids into 500 μL AdDF+++. Samples were stored at -80°C, a process which
lysed the organoids, releasing their contents into the medium. 2D differentiated airway cultures
were washed twice with 200 ul AdDF+++ before inoculation from the apical side at a MOI of
0.1 in 200 μL AdDF+++ per well. Next, cultures were incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 for 2 hours
before washing 3 times in 200 μL AdDF+++. At the indicated timepoints, virus was collected
from the cells by adding 200 μL AdDF+++ apically, incubating 10 min at 37°C 5% CO2, and
storing the supernatant at -80°C. Prior to determining the viral titer, all samples were centrifuged
at 2,000 g for 5 min. Live virus titers were determined using the Spearman & Kärber TCID50
method on VeroE6 cells. All work was performed in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3
conditions at Erasmus Medical Center.
Determination of virus titers using qRT-PCR
Supernatant and organoid samples were thawed and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 min. Sixty μL
supernatant was lysed in 90 μL MagnaPure LC Lysis buffer (Roche) at RT for 10 min. RNA was
extracted by incubating samples with 50 μL Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter)
for 15 min at RT, washing beads twice with 70% ethanol on a DynaMag-96 magnet (Invitrogen)
and eluting in 30 μL MagnaPure LC elution buffer (Roche). Viral titers (TCID50 equivalants per
mL) were determined by qRT-PCR using primers targeting the E gene (35) and comparing the Ct
values to a standard curve derived from a virus stock titrated on VeroE6 cells.
Fixed immunofluorescence microscopy on differentiated human airway
Transwell inserts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized in 70% ethanol,
and blocked for 60 min in 10% normal goat serum in PBS (blocking buffer). Cells were
3

incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in blocking buffer, washed twice with PBS,
incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies Alexa350-, 488- and 594-conjugated antirabbit and anti-mouse (1:400; Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature, washed
two times with PBS, incubated with indicated additional stains (TO-PRO3), washed twice with
PBS, and mounted in Prolong Antifade (Invitrogen) mounting medium. Viral nucleocapsid was
stained with anti-NP (1:200; Sino biological), ciliated cells were stained with anti-AcTUB
(1:100; Santa Cruz, 6-11B-1) and goblet cells with anti-MUC5AC (1:100; Invitrogen, 45M1)
Samples were imaged on a LSM700 confocal microscope using ZEN software (Zeiss).
Immunostaining of hSIOs
Organoids were stained as described before (25). Primary antibodies used were goat antichromogranin A (1:500; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-nucleoprotein (1:200; Sino Biological), mouse
anti-dsRNA (1:200;Scicons), mouse anti-APOA1 (1:100; Thermofisher, PA5-88109), rabbit
anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology, 9661), goat anti-ACE2 (1:100; R&D
Systems, AF933) and rabbit anti-KI67 (1:200; Abcam, ab16667). Organoids were incubated with
the corresponding secondary antibodies Alexa488-, 568- and 647-conjugated anti-rabbit and
anti-mouse (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer containing 4ʹ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; 1;1,000, Invitrogen) and Phalloidin-Alexa488 (Thermofisher). Sections
were embedded in Vectashield (Vector Labs) and imaged using a Sp8 confocal microscope
(Leica). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software.
Quantitative PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed using biological and technical duplicates as
described before (36). Primers were designed using the NCBI primer design tool, tested using a
standard curve, and include:
ACE2_fw CGAAGCCGAAGACCTGTTCTA
ACE2_rev GGGCAAGTGTGGACTGTTCC
GAPDH_fw GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT
GAPDH_rev GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG
For qPCR analysis of IFNB1, IFNL1 and ISG15 we used RNA extracted from lysed organoids as
described above. We used the following ThermoFisher TaqMan primer-probe mixes:
IFNB1: Hs00277188-s1
IFNL1: Hs00601677-g1
ISG15: Hs01921425-s1
Beta actin was amplified using the following primer set:
Bact_fw GGCATCCACGAAACTACCTT,
Bact_rev AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG
Bact_probe FAM-ATCATGAAGTGTGACGTGGACATCCG-BHQ1.
Bulk RNA sequencing
Library preparation was performed at Single Cell Discoveries (Utrecht, The Netherlands), using
an adapted version of the CEL-seq protocol. In brief:
Total RNA was extracted using the standard TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol and used for library
preparation and sequencing. mRNA was processed as described previously, following an adapted
version of the single-cell mRNA seq protocol of CEL-Seq (37, 38). In brief, samples were
barcoded with CEL-seq primers during a reverse transcription and pooled after second strand
4

synthesis. The resulting cDNA was amplified with an overnight In vitro transcription reaction.
From this amplified RNA, sequencing libraries were prepared with Illumina Truseq small RNA
primers. Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nextseq500 platform using
barcoded 1 x 75 nt read setup. Read 1 was used to identify the Illumina library index and CELSeq sample barcode. Read 2 was aligned to the CRCh38 human RefSeq transcriptome, with the
addition of SARS-CoV1 (HKU-39849) and SARS-CoV-2 (Ref-SKU: 026V-03883) genomes,
using BWA using standard settings (39). Reads that mapped equally well to multiple locations
were discarded. Mapping and generation of count tables was done using the MapAndGo script.
Samples were normalized using RPM normalization.
Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package (40). SARSmapping reads were removed before analyzing the different datasets. After filtering for an
adjusted p-value < 0.05, the row z-score for the 25 genes with the highest upregulation after 60
hours of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was calculated. Data will be deposited in GEO.
The 50 genes which were most strongly induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 (padj < 0.05,
ranked by fold change) were subjected to functional enrichment analysis for a biological process
using ToppFun on the ToppGene Suite (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/enrichment.jsp) as described
before (41). The 5 biological processes with highest enrichment (after FDR correction and a pvalue cutoff of 0.05) for each virus are displayed with the corresponding GO term and corrected
p value.
Transmission electron microscopy
Organoids were chemically fixed for 3 hours at room temperature with 1.5% glutaraldehyde in
0.067 M cacodylate buffered to pH 7.4 and 1 % sucrose. Samples were washed once with 0.1 M
cacodylate (pH 7.4), 1 % sucrose and 3x with 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4), followed by incubation
in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% K4Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 1 hour
at 4 ᵒC. After rinsing with MQ, organoids were dehydrated at RT in a graded ethanol series (70,
90, up to 100%) and embedded in epon. Epon was polymerized for 48h at 60 ᵒC. 60nm Ultrathin
sections were cut using a diamond knife (Diatome) on a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome, and
transferred onto 50 Mesh copper grids covered with a formvar and carbon film. Sections were
post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
All TEM data were collected autonomously as virtual nanoscopy slides (26) on FEI Tecnai T12
microscopes at 120kV using an Eagle camera. Data were stitched, uploaded, shared and
annotated using Omero (42) and PathViewer.
Data was deposited to the Image Data Resource (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org) under accession
number idr0083.”
Multiplex cytokine ELISA
Organoid supernatant samples, stored at -80ᵒC, were thawed and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5
min. The Anti-virus response panel multiplex ELISA kit (BioLegend) was used to determine
cytokine concentrations in the samples using a FACSLyric (BD biosciences) flow cytometer.
The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the addition that
capture beads were inactivated in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and
washed once in wash buffer after completion of the staining protocol in a Class II Biosafety
Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the GraphPad Prism 8 software. We compared
differences in cytokine levels and log10 transformed viral titers by a two-way ANOVA followed
by a Sidak multiple-comparison test.
