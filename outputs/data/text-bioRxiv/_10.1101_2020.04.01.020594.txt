Significance Statement

Although genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are growing daily and contain sufficient
phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be
interpreted with caution.

Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been growing exponentially, affecting nearly 900 thousand
people and causing enormous distress to economies and societies worldwide. A plethora of
analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as
through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and
spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined full genome sequences currently available to assess

the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in
countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases. Although number of-available full-genomes is
growing daily, and the full dataset contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow
reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 datasets still
present severe limitations. Studies assessing within country spread or transmission
clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating. Hence the need for
continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust
tracing of the epidemic.

Introduction

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, as the
etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which by March 2020 has already
spread across more than 80 countries (1). Common symptoms of infection include fever, cough,
and shortness of breath, while severe cases are characterized by advanced respiratory distress
and pneumonia, often resulting in death (2). It is still unknown what proportion of infected people
that only present mild or no symptoms are spreading the virus. A recent study showed that in
Wuhan whom roughly 60% of all infections were spread by asymptomatic subjects (3). This
characteristic significantly thwarts the job of public health officials who are trying to detect
transmission clusters. Few transmission clusters have been identified in China recently through
epidemiological contact tracing. However, because of the ongoing nature of the outbreak, it is
even more complicated if not impossible to detect transmission clusters using genetic data.

Soon after the first epidemiological and SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data were made
available, a glut of phylogeny-based analyses began to circulate discussing, in scientific papers
as well as (social) media, countries that might have been fueling the spread. The implications of
misunderstanding the real dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic are extremely dangerous. Ethnic
or social discrimination resulting from unsupported assumptions on viral contagion – often

amplified by irresponsible, uncontrollable communications – can be highly damaging for people
and countries. In particular, the US-based NextStrain (4) team has been posting real-time
updates on the epidemic tracing by molecular analyses. Despite (social) media are often vehicle
for fake news and boast news hype, it is also worth noting the tremendous effort of the scientific
community to provide free, up-to-date information on ongoing studies, as well as critical
evaluations. Several discussions and evidence-based debates on controversial hypotheses on
the epidemic have ensued — such as the number of untraced infections in the US, the putative
virus introduction in Italy through Germany, and the alleged lineage diversification in China (5)
later criticized (6). Recently, an editorial published on Science (7) has also highlighted how
unsupported or misleading claims circulating in forums, social media, and even peer-reviewed
articles, have been led by a substantial over interpretation of the available data. Hence, the
urgency to reframe the current debate in more rigorous scientific terms, and quantitatively
evaluate whether sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies
currently exists, or which gaps need to be addressed. We explored the characteristics of few
datasets through time and assess phylogenetic signal to understand whether we this data is
useful of not.

Results

Sampling and phylogeographic uncertainly

Before carrying out any phylogeny-based analysis of virus evolution and spatiotemporal spread, it
is crucial to test the quality of sequence data, since uneven sampling, presence of phylogenetic
noise, and absence of temporal signal can affect reliability of the results (e.g. ancestral state
reconstructions, molecular clock calibrations) (8). SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences were
obatained from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (9) at different timepoints. As of March 30th, we
compared the number of full genomes sampled per country with the number of confirmed cases
at the time of sampling, as well as the country’s total population (Figure 1). We obtained 2608 full
genomes from 55 countries (Figure 1). During the past month, the number of genomes has

steeply been increasing: March 3rd, 169 genome sequences from 22 countries; March 10th, 331
genome sequences from 29 countries; March 18th, 794 genome sequences from 35 countries,
ρ=0.45; March 25th, 1662 genome sequences from 42 countries. We found spearman (rank)
correlation between confirmed cases and genomes per country to be 0.49 on March 30th, and we
considered it as a proxy for sampling homogeneity. However, correlation could only be
investigated with confirmed cases (again as proxy), since not all affected countries have made
publicly available the total number of coronavirus testing performed. Moreover, even within the
same country, sequenced genomes were usually sampled from few hotspots, not necessarily
representative of the whole epidemic in that country. It is worrisome that, as of March 30th 2020,
the two top countries in terms of confirmed cases do not show sufficiently large and
representative sampling. SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences available from patients in the US,
the country with the highest number of confirmed cases, have mainly been sampled in
Washington state (66%) during the early epidemic, while less than one third (32%) are available
from the epicenter of the US epidemic, the state of New York. Italy, the second country per
confirmed cases, uploaded 26 genomes, of which one from the Marche region, four from Friuli
Venezia Giulia, seven from Abruzzo, nine from Lazio, and only five from Lombardy, which is
epicenter of the Italian epidemic (Table S1) (10). The top 10 contributors per number of genomes
are USA (612), Iceland (343), UK (321), China (300), Netherlands (190), France (119), Japan
(83), Canada (80), Australia (64), and Belgium (46). Notably, some countries uploaded a high
number of genomes despite having a relatively low number of cases (e.g., Georgia, Iceland,
Senegal, DRC).

Phylogenetic noise in sequence data

Lack of resolution and uncertainty in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree is to be expected,
considering that relatively little genetic diversity can be accumulated during the first three months
of an epidemic, even for an exponentially spreading and fast-evolving RNA virus. Assessment of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020594; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

phylogenetic signal in the dataset was carried out using likelihood mapping analysis (11), which
estimates the likelihood of each of possible tree topology for any group of four sequences
(quartet), randomly chosen from an alignment, and reports them inside an equilateral triangle (the
likelihood map) where the corners represent distinct tree topologies and the center star-like trees.
Quartets are considered “resolved” when the three likelihoods are significantly different
(phylogenetic signal, most dots equally distributed in the corners, i.e. data are suitable for robust
phylogeny inference), unresolved or partially resolved, when all three likelihood values or two of
them are not significantly different (phylogenetic noise, most dots in sides or center areas, i.e.
data may not be sufficient for robust phylogeny inference). Extensive simulation studies have
shown that, for sequences to be considered robust in terms of phylogenetic signal, side/center
areas of the likelihood mapping must include <40% of the unresolved quartets (12). Overall,
phylogenetic signal in the present data has been increasing with number of genomes been
released. Percentage of unresolved quartets detected in the SARS-CoV-2 full genomes
alignment on March 3rd and 10th was still too high to allow reliable inferences (Figure S1). In other
words, such a lack of phylogenetic signal has likely resulted in overall unreliable topology of any
SARS-CoV-2 tree obtained using those data, and even clades with high bootstrap values should
have been interpreted with extreme caution.

The effect of inhomogeneous sampling, lack of phylogenetic signal and missing data on
phylogeography reconstructions, like the ones recently rushed through news and (social) media
to claim specific dissemination routes of SARS-CoV-2 among countries, can be quite dramatic.
An instructive example is the putative introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy from Germany. A
preliminary maximum likelihood (ML) tree, inferred from the full genome viral sequences available
on March 3rd 2020, showed a well-supported cluster of European and Asian sequences (reported
in Figure S2), which contained a subclade (Subclade A, Figure 2a) including a sequence isolated
in Germany that appears to be paraphyletic (with strong bootstrap support) to an Italian sequence
clustering, in turn, with sequences from Finland, Mexico, Germany and Switzerland. Based on
this observation (which was available on NextStrain), a heated discussion circulated on social
media about a transmission event from Germany to Italy followed by further spread from Italy the

other countries. However, in a new tree inferred just one week later, when more than 135 new full
genome sequences were made available on GISAID (9), the direct link between Germany and
Italy in Subclade A disappeared due to the additional clustering of previously unsampled
sequences from Portugal, Brazil, Wales and Netherland (Figure 2b). In addition, likelihoods of
alternative tree topologies generated arbitrarily switching branches in the tree (arrows in Figure
2b), implying different dissemination scenarios, were not significantly different (ShimodairaHasgawa test, Table S2) than the likelihood of the tree inferred from the real data. In other words,
it is not possible, with present data, to decide which branching pattern (and, therefore,
phylogeographic reconstruction) is the one most likely representing actual dissemination routes
among European countries.

Available genome sequences are rapidly growing. SARS-CoV-2 full genome dataset is now
showing less than 40% of unresolved quartets in the center: 38.6% unresolved quartets on March
18th (794 genome sequences) (Figure S1c) and 32.3% on March 25th (1,660 genome sequences)
(Figure S1d). This indicates that the amount of phylogenetic information is now potentially usable
to define phylogenetic relationships among strains. Plotting mean genetic distance of each
sequence from the root of a phylogeny versus the sequence sampling time allows to testing for
significant linear correlation, which is necessary for the calibration of a reliable molecular clock
(13) (Figure S3). As expected in genomes obtained over a very short period of time (~ three
months) since the beginning of the outbreak, correlation in the current data is fairly week (Table
S3). However, Bayesian analysis (14), which infers phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns
from a posterior distribution of trees, might facilitate comparisons about different evolutionary
scenarios, help in retrieving the correct topology, and estimate an accurate evolutionary rate
using relaxed clock methods (15). Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of the same
European Subclade A discussed above with sequence available on March 18th 2020 showed a
much more complex snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 spreading (Figure S4). Taking a closer look at the
Sublade A reveals that even with more genomes available, inference is bias by over-sampling of
some countries and under-sampling of others (Figure S4). Yet, even with more genomes
available, inference is bias by over-sampling of some countries and under-sampling of others

(Figure S4). Recently, methods were developed to estimate, for each pair of viral sequences from
two infected individuals, how many intermediates there are in the putative transmission chain
connecting them, using a transmission matrix (16). The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows
that numerous links among samples are still missing (Figure S5). In such a scenario, it is not
advisable to extrapolate conclusions on the origin and dissemination of strains.

Phylogenetic signal is increasing in the global alignment; yet, likelihood mapping per country,
using data from countries reporting highest number of cases – USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, and
France – indicate that some local datasets lack sufficient signal (Figure S6). Lack of signal was
found in datasets from Italy (26 genomes, 45 variant sites – 0.2% of total sites in the genome - 11
parsimony informative), USA (612 genomes, 675 variant sites - 2.3% of total sites in the genome
- 158 parsimony informative) and China (300 genomes, 742 variant sites – 2.5% of total sites in
the genome - 98 parsimony informative). The top 5 contributing states in US are Washington
(405, 66%), California (45, 7%), Minnesota (33, 5%), Wisconsin (29, 5%), and Utah (22, 4%); 42
genomes are not labeled with a state or city. USA dataset comprised mostly of sequences
collected in Washington State (423 genomes, 69.1%). The top 5 contributing provinces in China
are Shanghai (96, 32%), Guangdong (80, 27%), Hong Kong (30, 10%), Hubei (31, 10%),
Hangzhou (9, 3%), and Shandong (9, 3%); 20 genomes are not labeled with a province or city.
Neither China nor US showed phylogenetic signal despite the high number of genome sequences
available (Figure S6). On the contrary, and unexpectedly, countries with low number of genome
sequences did show presence of phylogenetic signal: Germany, Spain and France (Figure S6).
Despite the presence of phylogenetic signal in these countries, only genomes form France also
show temporal signal that would allow for calibration of a molecular clock and re-framing
phylogenetic and phylogeography inferences in spatiotemporal dimension. On the other hand, the
transmission matrix for France indicates that considerable links are still missing due to unsampled
infected individuals, limiting the reliability of transmission cluster studies based on sequence data
(Figure S8).

Conclusions and Future directions

As more genome sequences, sampled at different time points and from diverse geographic areas,
are daily becoming available, in depth Bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeography analyses of
the COVID-19 pandemic may soon be a viable option. As long new data do not increase
phylogenetic and temporal signal, results will remain highly questionable. Characterization of
transmission events is fundamental to understand the dynamics of any infectious disease. From a
public health standpoint, being able to trace transmission at the local level is crucial. Within
country identification of active transmission clusters would open the way to more effective public
health measures. The most optimal inference of transmission events would have a combination of
genetic and epidemiological data for a joint analysis. However, it is not possible, at the moment,
to identify transmission clusters within regions, counties, or cities, solely on genetic data, since
micro-scale genetic data is not yet available. Indeed, transmission investigations that have been
performed so far have been based on contact-tracing, epidemiological and clinical data (17, 18).

Published scientific data and media are, nowadays, easily accessible to a worldwide audience;
properly weighing the information being shared is important more than ever. We deem that
current molecular epidemiology data are not solid enough to provide a scientifically sound
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spread. Despite overall increasing of phylogenetic and temporal signal,
we suggest that any conclusion drawn, at present, about existing lineages and direction of viral
spread, based on phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, should be considered at
the very best preliminary, and hypothesis-generating. The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
spread is unveiling an unprecedented amount of information, essential to make policy decisions.
The whole of humanity is threatened by the current pandemic, and policy makers need to adjust
their mitigation measures while the pandemic itself is developing. Some of the urgent answers
required lie in the timely availability of abundant, high quality genetic data not only from countries
experiencing a high number of reported cases, but also from others that seem to be experiencing,
at least for now, a lower number of infections.

Methods

Data
GISAID was accessed on March 30th 2020 (Table S1). After quality control of sequences that
were not full genomes or contained extensive stretches of unknown nucleotides, March 30th
March 30th 2020 of 2608 from 55 countries. Confirmed cases were retrieved from the March 29th
data of the Covid19 website provided by Johns Hopkins University (16). Top ten countries per
confirmed cases were USA (121,146), Italy (97,689), China (82,122), Spain (80,110), Germany
(62,095), France (40,708), Iran (38,309), UK (19,778), Switzerland (14,829), and Netherlands
(10,930).
Phylogenetic signal and ML phylogeny inference
Transition/transversions vs. genetic distance plot were calculated using DAMBE6 (19). Evaluation
of the presence of phylogenetic signal satisfying resolved phylogenetic relationships among
sequences was carried out with IQ-TREE, allowing the software to search for all possible quartets
using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model (11). ML tree reconstruction was performed in
IQ-TREE based on the best-fit model chosen according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
(20, 21). Exploration of temporal structure, i.e. presence of molecular clock in the data, was
assessed by regression of divergence -root-to-tip genetic distance- against sampling time using
TempEst (13). In this case, absence of a linear trend indicates that the data does not contain
temporal signal and that the data is not appropriate for phylogenetic inference using molecular
clock models. TransPhylo R package was used to infer transmission matrices of SARS-CoV-2
(16).

* Alternative topology obtained by switching branches in the ML tree inferred from SARS-CoV-2
full genome sequences. 1: Italy (EPI_ISL_412973) switched with Wales (EPI_ISL_413555); 2:
Germany (EPI_ISL_406862) with Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964); 3: Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648) with
Brazil (EPI_ISL_412964); 4: Germany (EPI_ISL_406862) with Portugal (EPI_ISL_413648). **
LogL: log likelihood estimated for each alternative topology. # DL: difference between LogL and
the log likelihood of the original tree. ## SH: Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (22).
