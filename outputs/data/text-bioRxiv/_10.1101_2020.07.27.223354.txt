T cell receptors (TCRs) are formed by stochastic gene rearrangements, theoretically generating

20

>>1019 sequences1. They are selected during thymopoiesis, which releases a repertoire of

21

about 108 unique TCRs2,3 per individual. How evolution shaped a process that produces TCRs

22

that would effectively respond to infectious agents is a central question of immunology. The

23

paradigm is that a diverse enough repertoire of TCRs should always provide a proper, though

24

rare, specificity for any given need. Expansion of such rare T cells would provide enough fighters

25

for an efficacious immune response and enough antigen-experienced cells for memory3,4. We

26

show here that thymopoiesis releases a large population of CD8+ T cells harbouring diverse

27

a/bTCRs with innate-like properties. These TCRs (i) have high generation probabilities and a

28

preferential usage of some V and J genes, (ii) are shared between individuals, (iii) are highly

29

enriched for viral antigen recognition and (iv) have a fuzzy rather than tight specificity. In vitro,

30

T cells expressing these TCRs bind to and are activated by multiple unrelated viral peptides; in

31

vivo, they respond to vaccination and infection, being notably found in bronchoalveolar lavages

32

of COVID-19 infected patients. Our results support an evolutionary selection of pleiospecific

33

a/bTCRs for broad antiviral responses and heterologous immunity.

35

We analysed the TCR repertoire dynamics of developing thymocytes. We first focused

36

on the hypervariable CDR3 region of the TCR that interacts with the antigenic peptide, while

37

CDR1 and CDR2 usually interact with HLA molecules5. CDR3 analyses can therefore be used to

38

investigate the sharing of TCR specificities between individuals with distinct HLA molecules. We

39

analysed the repertoire of purified CD4+CD8+CD3- (DPCD3-), CD4+CD8+CD3+ (DPCD3+) and CD4-

40

CD8+CD3+ (CD8+) thymocytes. DPCD3- thymocytes represent the earliest stage of TCR b-chain

41

gene recombination and their repertoire embodies the unaltered outcome of the TCR

42

generation process; DPCD3+ thymocytes are at an early stage of the selection process and their

43

repertoire should be minimally modified; CD8+ thymocytes have passed the selection process

44

and bear a fully selected repertoire. We analysed and represented the structure of these

45

repertoires by connecting CDR3s (nodes) differing by at most one single amino acid (AA)

46

(Levenshtein distance less than or equal to one: LD≤1) as such similar CDR3s most often bind

47

the same peptide6–12 (Supplementary Figure 1. In these networks, connected CDR3s are

48

designated as clustered nodes and the others as dispersed nodes. For normalisation, we

49

represented the first 18,000 most expressed b or a CDR3s from each sample. We observed a

50

marked increase in the number of clustered CDR3s from DPCD3- to CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 1a

51

and c, Supplementary Figure 2), which was remarkably consistent among all individuals studied,

52

independently of their age, sex or HLA (Supplementary Figure 3). The node degree, i.e. its

53

number of connections, was also significantly increased during T cell differentiation for

54

clustered CDR3s (Fig. 1b and d, Supplementary Figure 2). The major and statistically significant

55

(p<0.0001) increase in the proportion of clustered TCRs from DPCD3+ to CD8+ thymocytes,

56

which was also accompanied by a significant increase (p<0.0001) in the node degree of

57

clustered TCRs, reveals a positive selection of TCRs with shared recognition properties during

58

thymopoiesis.

59

The probability of generation (Pgen) of a given TCR varies enormously from one TCR to

60

the other, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude1. The clustered TCRs from both DPCD3+ and

61

CD8+ thymocytes have a significantly higher Pgen (p<0.0001) than the dispersed ones (Fig. 1e).

62

Pgen also increased significantly (p<0.0001) from DPCD3+ to CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 1e).

63

Moreover, the Pgen of CD8+ thymocytes is significantly correlated with the node degree

64

(Supplementary Figure 4). Clustered TCRs have a preferential usage of some V and J genes,

65

resulting in a markedly different VJ recombination usage, notably similar across individuals (Fig.

66

1f, Supplementary Figure 5). As there is a remarkably shared clustered structure of CD8+

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.223354; this version posted July 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

67

thymocytes bCDR3s across individuals (Supplementary Figure 3), we investigated their private

68

or public nature (Fig. 1g, Supplementary table 1). We found a significant increase of public (i.e.

69

shared between at least 2 individuals) bCDR3s in CD8+ versus DPCD3+ thymocytes, which is

70

mostly that of the clustered bCDR3s. For CD8+ thymocytes, up to 31.7% of clustered bCDR3s

71

are public compared to barely 1% of the dispersed ones (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Figure 6).

72

These results are independent of HLA alleles sharing (Supplementary Figure 7). The bCDR3s

73

with the highest Pgen values and degree were the most shared between individuals

74

(Supplementary Figure 8). Moreover, there is a convergence of specificities between

75

individuals’ repertoires, as many bCDR3s of one individual are connected to those of other

76

individuals (up to twelve), and more frequently in CD8+ versus DPCD3+ thymocytes

77

(Supplementary Figure 9). Altogether, these results indicate that the mechanisms for TCR

78

generation and for their further thymic selection are biased to shape a public repertoire of

79

connected bCDR3s with shared recognition properties.

97

sampled repertoire (Fig. 1g) raises the question of their specificities13. As the main function of

98

CD8+ T cells is cytotoxicity towards virally infected cells, we investigated whether the clustered

99

TCRs could be associated with virus recognition. We curated databases of βCDR3s specific for

100

human infectious pathogens14,15 to retain only those 5,437 that had been identified by

101

tetramer-based selection, i.e. binding to a soluble HLA bound to a defined peptide. We

102

detected an enrichment of these βCDR3s in CD8+ versus DPCD3+ thymocytes (p<0.0001) and in

103

clustered versus dispersed CD8+ thymocytes (p<0.0001) (Fig. 2a and b, Supplementary Figure

104

10. , Supplementary table 2). Moreover, these virus-specific βCDR3s were significantly enriched

105

within βCDR3s with the highest Pgen and node degree (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Figure 11. ) and

106

were highly shared between individuals (Fig. 2d).

The preferential selection of clustered public TCRs that could represent over 8% of the

107

We aimed to confirm these observations with virus-specific paired a and b TCR chains

108

obtained from single-cell TCR sequencing. These sequences were obtained from 160,914 blood

109

CD8+ T cells isolated from four healthy donors and incubated simultaneously with barcoded

110

dextramers complexed with peptides from CMV, EBV, HIV, HPV, HTLV and influenza16. We

111

observed a significant increase in the representation of the virus-specific a and b TCR chains in

112

CD8+ versus DPCD3+ thymocytes (Fig. 2e and f), with a higher representation of the virus-

113

specific alpha chains than that of the beta chains. Noteworthily, these TCRs are also mostly

114

represented in clustered rather than dispersed TCRs from CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 2g,

115

Supplementary table 3). Altogether, these results indicate that the selection of clustered TCRs

116

with high generation probabilities corresponds, at least in part, to the selection of virus-

117

associated TCRs whose CDR3s are remarkably conserved between individuals independently of

118

their HLA.

of CD8+ thymocytes from one individual with virus-specific βCDR3s identified in single-cell sequencing
datasets16.

135

Intriguingly, we noted that TCRs with different assigned specificities could be detected

136

within close proximity in single clusters (Supplementary Figure 12), although this should

137

suggest similar specificities6–12 (Supplementary Figure 1. ). We thus investigated this

138

observation in greater detail, at the single-cell level16. We first analysed the different TCRs

139

assigned to recognise EBV peptides, i.e. binding dextramers (Dex+) matching the HLA of a given

140

individual loaded with EBV peptides (Fig. 3a). Single TCRs were found to bind multiple

141

dextramers loaded with distinct peptides from EBV (Fig. 3b) and some TCRs also bound

142

dextramers loaded with peptides from unrelated viruses such as CMV, HIV, HPV, HTLV-1 or

143

influenza (Fig. 3c); TCRs able to bind dextramers specific for both EBV and CMV were even

144

found in a CMV and EBV seronegative patient (Supplementary Figure 13). TCRs binding multiple

145

viral peptides have binding scores for the different viral peptides that are highly positively

146

correlated (Fig. 3d); for example, the different TCRs that bind a dextramer expressing the

147

“IPSINVHHY” CMV peptide have a strong positive correlation (blue dot) for the binding of a

148

dextramer expressing the “YLLEMLWRL” EBV peptide (Fig. 3d; red arrows), indicating that most

149

of the TCRs that bind one of these peptides have an equivalent binding score for the other.

150

Noteworthily, there is only rare negative correlation (red dots) for the binding of dextramer

151

harbouring different peptides.

152

We also analysed the binding of HLA-mismatched dextramers. When HLA-mismatch

153

EBV Dex+ cells are overlaid on a TSNE representation based on single-cell specificity (Fig. 3e),

154

some of them corresponded to cells also labelled by HLA-matched EBV dextramers (Fig. 3a),

155

while some others did not (Fig. 3e, red arrow). As for the HLA-matched dextramers, single TCRs

156

were found to bind HLA-mismatched dextramers loaded with distinct unrelated peptides from

157

EBV (Fig. 3f) and some TCRs even bound HLA-mismatched dextramers loaded with epitopes

158

from different viruses such as CMV, HIV, HPV, HTLV-1 or influenza (Fig. 3g). There were also

159

mostly positive correlations for the binding to different HLA-mismatched dextramer

160

specificities (Fig. 3h). Altogether, within a dataset of >160,000 single CD8+ T cells, among the

161

66,191 that did bind dextramers, 24,083 could bind more than one viral-derived peptide from

162

either the same or different viruses, and presented by HLA-matched or even HLA-mismatched

163

dextramers. Thus, there are pleiospecific CD8+ T cells (psT cells) whose TCRs are diverse and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.223354; this version posted July 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

164

bind HLA class-I based dextramers, but are not strictly constrained by HLA matching and the

165

presented peptide. Such binding properties markedly differ from the classical cross-reactivity

166

of TCRs for mimotopes17 and from those of innate-like MAIT and NKT cells18,19. The latter have

167

a restricted diversity, with an invariant TCRa chain and a constrained TCRb repertoire, and are

168

MR1- or CD1-restricted, respectively18,19.

192

These peculiar properties led us to assess the functional relevance of the innate-like

193

recognition of psT cells’ TCRs. We first evaluated the in vitro cross-activation of T cells with

194

different peptides. Human effector memory CD8+ T cells (emCD8+) were purified according to

195

their binding of CMV or EBV fluorescent dextramers; the sorted cells were then stimulated by

196

either the peptide that was used to purify them, or by different ones, and their activation was

197

measured by their IFNg production (Fig. 4a). All T cells were efficiently non-specifically activated

198

by PMA/ionomycin. T cells that did not bind any dextramers could not be stimulated by any

199

peptide. In contrast, dextramer-sorted cells could be activated by their cognate peptide and

200

almost as well by the other (Fig. 4b). Thus, the binding of multiple dextramers appears

201

functionally relevant, translating into proper psT cells activation by multiple unrelated peptides.

202

We then investigated whether we could detect the involvement of psT cells during in vivo

203

immune responses. We first analysed individuals vaccinated against yellow fever (YFV) (Fig.

204

4c)20 or influenza (Flu) (Fig. 4d), identifying their TCR repertoires responding to YFV and Flu

205

using the ALICE21 and TCRNET algorithms22,23, respectively. Within these repertoires, we looked

206

for known viral-specific TCR sequences. Besides YFV- and Flu-specific b and a CDR3s (Fig. 4c &

207

d), we could also detect CDR3s of psT cells, i.e. assigned to one or even multiple other viral

208

specificities, notably for CMV and EBV. We then also analysed the TCR repertoire of T cells from

209

bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) from patients with COVID-19 pulmonary infections24, i.e. cells

characteristics of psT cells: their CDR3s (i) could be detected within the clusters of psT cells

212

responding to YFV and Flu infection (Fig. 4 c & d); (ii) they are highly connected to virus-specific

213

sequences from databases (Fig. 4 e & f) and (iii) many harbour a TCR assigned to at least two

214

specificities from CMV, EBV or Flu. Thus, psT cells migrate to the sites of primary antiviral

215

immune responses.

Identification of unconventional T cells responding to influenza vaccination. The identification of a and
β CDR3 significantly recruited following influenza vaccination was performed using the TCRNET
algorithm22,23 for one representative individual. e. Node degree a and β CDR3 of TCRs from
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of COVID-19 patients24 and from control repertoire clustered with virusspecific a and β CDR3 from databases14–16. Each node represents a single CDR3, the colour of which
represents its degree (log scale). f. Statistical analysis of node degree from e. (****p<0.0001, MannWhitney test). g. Multiple viral specificities of the a and β CDR3s from BAL of COVID-19 patients. Every
combination of specificities is represented by the middle-coloured plot (same colour codes as in c & d).
The occurrence of each combination is shown for a (top bar plot) and β CDR3s (bottom bar plot).

234

Our findings have important implications for the study of the adaptive immune response

235

in health, diseases and immunotherapies. They prompt reconsideration of the paradigm of

236

highly diverse adaptive immune repertoires driving a highly antigen-specific antiviral immune

237

response. The immune response may instead proceed through tinkering, as evolution does25.

238

For life-threatening situations, the initial recruitment of frequent pleiospecific effector T cells

239

might be more efficient and rapid than having to rely on rare cells with stringent specificity.

240

This would be another mechanism of preparedness of the immune system, reminiscent of the

241

role of (i) other unconventional T cells like MAIT and NKT cells4, (ii) TCR activation by bacterial

242

superantigen26 and (iii) natural antibodies specific for microbial determinants27. Our findings

243

would also explain the overlooked observation that a very restricted repertoire of only about

244

1,000 different TCRs arising from a single T cell progenitor was sufficient to cope with viral

245

infections in a child with severe combined immunodeficiency28.

246

A fuzzy recognition by pleiospecific TCRs would explain the so-called “heterologous

247

immunity”29,30 in which T cell responses to one pathogen can have a major impact on the course

248

and outcome of a subsequent infection with an unrelated pathogen31. In support of this

249

concept, in humans, (i) there are abundant virus-specific memory-phenotype T cells in

250

unexposed adults32, (ii) vaccination against measles provides better overall survival

251

independently of measles infection33 and (iii) CMV infection enhances immune responses to

252

influenza31. Individuals’ histories of fuzzy immune responses may create “antigenic sins” that

253

might be responsible for the diverse immune responses to viruses, from inapparent infection

254

to fulminant immunopathology34–36. Interestingly, heterologous immunity has rarely been

255

linked to B cell/antibody responses, which might thus be the mediators of more specific

256

immune responses. In this regard, it is noteworthy that B cells have a machinery for somatic

257

mutations of their BCRs that ultimately allows them to generate antibodies with increased

258

affinity (specificity) for antigens. While TCR generation and BCR generation share many

259

common mechanisms, the fact that T cells did not evolve to use this available machinery is

260

another indication that T cell recognition could have been selected to be more fuzzy than

261

stringent. Further studies will have to evaluate the contribution of fuzzy immune responses to

262

the efficacy but also the immunopathology of antimicrobial responses and to autoimmunity.

263

Materials and methods:

264
265

Human samples:

266

Thirteen human thymus samples were obtained from organ donors undergoing surgery

267

(Department of Cardiac Surgery, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, France) after approval by the

268

Agence de Biomédecine and the Ministry of Research. Their age at the time of sampling ranged

269

from 19 to 65 years old. The male-to-female sex ratio was 2.6.

270

For cross-activation experiments, six leukapheresis samples were freshly collected from healthy

271

donors at EFS Paris Saint-Antoine-Crozatier (Etablissement Français du Sang, Paris, France)

272

after informed consent and according to institutional guidelines. Donor selection was based on

273

matching HLA-A2 class I allele.

274

For the influenza vaccination protocol, two unrelated healthy individuals were vaccinated with

275

inactivated influenza vaccine (Influvac Tetra, Mylan) after written informed consent. The blood

276

was collected with informed consent.

277
278

Isolation of thymocytes and extraction of RNA:

279

Single-cell suspensions were prepared from the thymus by mechanical disruption through

280

nylon mesh (cell strainer). Single-cell suspensions from whole thymus were stained with

281

antibodies anti-CD3 (AF700), anti-CD4 (APC), anti-CD8 (FITC). Cells were sorted by fluorescent

282

activated cell sorting (Becton DickinsonTM FACSAria II) with purity >95% to collect populations

283

based on the following labelling: DPCD3- were gated as CD3-CD4+CD8+, DPCD3+ were gated as

284

CD3+CD4+CD8+ and CD8+ were gated as CD3+CD4-CD8+. RNA was isolated from sorted

285

populations by means of lysis buffer with the RNAqueous-Kit (Invitrogen®) extraction kit,

286

according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration and sample integrity were

287

determined on NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher®).

288
289

TCR repertoire library preparation and sequencing

290

T cell receptor (TCR) beta libraries were prepared on 100 ng of RNA from each sample with the

291

SMARTer Human TCR a/b Profiling Kit (Takarabio®) following the provider’s protocol. Briefly,

292

the reverse transcription was performed using TRBC reverse primers and further extended with

293

a template-switching oligonucleotide (SMART-Seq® v4). cDNAs were then amplified following

294

two semi-nested PCRs: a first PCR with TRBC and TRAC reverse primers as well as a forward

295

primer hybridising to the SMART-Seqv4 sequence added by template-switching and a second

296

PCR targeting the PCR1 amplicons with reverse and forward primers including Illumina Indexes

297

allowing for sample barcoding. PCR2 were then purified using AMPure beads (Beckman-

298

Coulter®). The cDNA samples were quantified and their integrity was checked using DNA

299

electrophoresis performed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer System in combination with the

300

Agilent DNA 1000 kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was performed

301

with Hiseq 2500 (Illumina®) SR-300 protocols using the LIGAN-PM Genomics platform (Lille,

302

France).

303
304

TCR deep sequencing data processing

305

FASTQ raw data files were processed for TRB sequence annotation using MiXCR37 software

306

(v2.1.10) with RNA-Seq parameters. MiXCR extracts TRBs and provides corrections of PCR and

307

sequencing errors.

308
309

Network generation and representation

310

To construct a network, we computed a distance matrix of pairwise Levenshtein distances

311

between CDR3s using the “stringdist”38 R package. When two sequences were similar under

312

the defined threshold, LD>1 (i.e., at most one amino acid difference), they were connected and

313

designated as “clustered” nodes. CDR3s with more than one amino acid difference from any

314

other sequences are not connected and were designated as “dispersed” nodes.

315

Layout of networks for Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 9a were obtained by using the graphopt

316

algorithm of the “Igraph”39 R package and plotted in 2D with “ggplot2” to generate figures40.

317

Only clustered nodes are represented, edges are not shown and colours represent the node

318

degree (log scale).

319

Layouts of detailed networks in Fig. 1a, Fig. 2g, Fig. 4c, Fig. 4d & Supplementary Fig. 1a,

320

Supplementary Fig. 3 & Supplementary Fig. 12 were done with Cytoscape41.

321
322

Statistical analysis and visualisation

323

Normalisation was performed by sampling on the top a or b 18,000 CDR3s based on their

324

frequency in each sample. The repertoires with less than 18,000 a or b CDR3s were not

325

included in the statistical analysis. The numbers of samples included in the statistical analysis

326

for the b repertoire were: two for DPCD3-, ten for DPCD3+ and twelve for CD8+. The numbers

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.223354; this version posted July 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

327

of samples included in the statistical analysis of the a repertoire were: six for DPCD3+ and ten

328

for CD8+. Statistical tests used to analyse data are included in the figure legends. Comparisons

329

of two groups were done using the Mann-Whitney test (Fig. 1c, Fig. 1d, Fig. 1e, Fig. 1g, Fig. 2a,

330

Fig. 2c, Fig. 2e Fig. 2f, Fig. 4b) and multiple t-test (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 9).

331

The correlation coefficient was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient

332

(Supplementary Fig. 4). Enrichment of public CDR3s or virus-associated CDR3s was done using

333

the two-tailed Chi-square test with Yate’s correction (Fig. 2f, Supplementary table 1, 2 & 3) and

334

the Fisher test (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Fig. 11). Statistical comparisons and

335

multivariate analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and using

336

R software version 3.5.0 (www.r-project.org). PCA was performed on the frequency of VJ

337

combination usage frequency within each donor using the factoextra R package. Tsnes were

338

generated using the binding scores of each cell across all the antigens present in the dataset,

339

disregarding the HLA matching with the donor. The function Rtsne of the homonymous R

340

package42 was applied with the perplexity parameter set to 10. Correlograms were generated

341

using the cells that have a significant binding score (i.e. >10) for at least one of the virus-specific

342

dextramers tested. The correlation was calculated across all the antigens present on each

343

correlogram (Pearson test). Correlograms were plotted using the corrplot R package.

344
345

Probability of generation calculation

346

The generation probability (Pgen) of a sequence is inferred using the Olga

347

is inferred by IGoR 44, for Fig. 1e, Fig. 2c. IGoR uses out-of-frame sequence information to infer

348

patient-dependent models of VDJ recombination, effectively bypassing selection. From these

349

models, the probability of a given recombination scenario can be computed. The generation

350

probability of a sequence is then obtained by summing over all the scenarios that are

351

compatible with it. We also used OLGA to generate a random repertoire of 500,000 sequences

352

for each a or b repertoire and 3 down-sampling (of unique sequences) to get control repertoire

353

equal to the size of COVID-19 BAL dataset used in fig. 4c, 4d. The control repertoire was

354

parametrized by the predefined genomic templates provided with the package.

CDR3 connections between individuals

33

algorithm, which

357

In Supplementary Fig. 9, the top 1,500 bCDR3s were sampled from each of the 12 datasets of

358

DPCD3+ and CD8+, then merged to obtain two datasets of 18,000 bCDR3s for DPCD3+ and CD8+.

359

We generated and represented networks, as described above, to investigate the bCDR3 inter-

360

individual network structure.

361
362

Virus-specific bCDR3 tetramer public databases

363

The virus-associated CDR3 databases used for the search for specificity was compiled from the

364

most complete previously published McPAS-TCR14 and VDJdb15 databases. Virus-associated

365

bCDR3s were selected from the original datasets only when derived from a TCR of sorted CD8

366

T cells that were bound by a specific tetramer. A total of 5,437 such unique tetramer-associated

367

bCDR3s were identified and used. Peptides used for tetramer sorting were from

368

cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus

369

2 (HSV2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza and yellow fever virus (YFV).

370
371

Virus-specific CDR3 single-cell dextramer public dataset

372

This dataset contains single-cell alpha/beta TCRs from 160 914 CD8+ T cells isolated from

373

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 4 healthy donors. Briefly, 30 dCODE™

374

Dextramer® reagents (Immudex®) with antigenic peptides derived from infectious diseases (9

375

from CMV, 12 from EBV, 1 for influenza, 1 for HTLV, 2 for HPV and 5 for HIV) were

376

simultaneously used to mark cells. Each Dextramer® reagent included a distinct nucleic acid

377

barcode. A panel of fluorescently labelled antibodies was used to sort pure Dextramer®-

378

positive cells within the CD8+ T cell population using an MA900 Multi-Application Cell Sorter

379

(Sony Biotechnology) in a reaction mix containing RT Reagent Mix and Poly dT RT primers. The

380

Chromium Single Cell V(D)J workflow generates single cell V(D)J and Dextramer® libraries from

381

amplified DNA derived from Dextramer®-conjugated barcode oligonucleotides, which are

382

bound to TCRs. Chromium Single Cell V(D)J enriched libraries and cell surface protein libraries

383

were quantified, normalised, and sequenced according to the user guide for Chromium Single

384

Cell V(D)J reagent kits with feature barcoding technology for cell surface protein. We used this

385

dataset to study the presence of multiple specificities in TCR and CDR3. There were 139,378

386

unambiguous TCRs (with only one α and one β chain). We set the threshold defining positive

387

binding at UMI counts greater than 10 for any given dextramer. This identified 15,195 unique

388

virus-specific TCRs with at least one binding.

Single-cell sequencing of TCRs from bronchoalveolar lavages from COVID-19 patients

391

This dataset contains single-cell alpha/beta TCRs from T cells isolated from bronchoalveolar

392

lavage (BAL) of 9 patients infected by COVID-1924. We excluded the TCRs from cells in which

393

more than 1 CDR3aa alpha and 1 CDR3aa beta were detected.

394
395

Cross-activation experiment

396

PBMCs were separated on Ficoll gradient. CD8+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs by positive

397

isolation using the DYNABEADS® CD8 Positive Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according

398

to the manufacturer’s instructions. emCD8 T cells were purified after staining with CD3-AF700,

399

CD8-KO, CD45RA-PeCy7 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were also

400

stained either with CMV pp65 NLVPMVATV or with EBV BMLF-1 GLCTLVAML PE-conjugated

401

Dextramers (Immudex®). emCD8+Dex+ cells were sorted by FACS (FACS Aria II®; BD Biosciences)

402

with a purity >95%. Sorted cells were cultured at a maximum of 5 × 105 cells/mL in round-

403

bottom 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1%

404

penicillin/streptomycin and glutamate at 37°C with 5% CO2. In vitro stimulation was performed

405

24 hours after cell sorting. Sorted cells were stimulated for 6 hours with either nothing or 1

406

μg/mL of SIINFEKL ovalbumin peptide (OVA), NLVPMVATV cytomegalovirus pp65 peptide

407

(CMV) or GLCTLVAML Epstein-Barr virus BMLF-1 peptide (Ozyme®). The positive control (Ctl

408

PMA/Iono) was performed with 50 ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 1 mM

409

ionomycin. Intracellular IFN-γ production with an IFN-γ-FITC antibody (BD Pharmingen) was

410

detected in the presence of Golgi-Plug (BD Pharmingen®) after fixation and permeabilisation

411

(BD Cytofix/Cytoperm). Data were acquired using a Navios flow cytometer and analysed with

412

Kaluza analysis software (Beckman Coulter).

413
414

Influenza vaccination protocol

415

Peripheral blood was obtained before vaccination and on day 14 after vaccination. PBMCs were

416

stained with antibodies anti-CD3 (AF700), anti-CD8 (FITC), CD45RA (PeCy7), CCR7 (BV421). Cells

417

were sorted by fluorescent activated cell sorting (Becton DickinsonTM FACSAria II) with purity

418

>95% to collect populations based on the following labelling: naïve CD8 were gated as CD3+CD8-

419

CD45RA+CCR7+ and effector memory CD8 were gated as CD3+CD8-CD45RA-CCR7-. RNA

described above.

Identification of TCR enrichment after vaccination

424

Homologous groups of TCRs that are specifically recruited during an antigen-specific response

425

following yellow fever or influenza vaccination were sought using with the previously published

426

algorithms ALICE21 and TCRNET22,23, respectively. The difference between the two algorithms

427

is that ALICE uses the VDJ rearrangement model as a control45 while TCRNET uses real control

428

samples as background.

Supplementary table 1. Enrichment of public bCDR3s in CD8+ thymocytes vs DPCD3+.
Contingency table for the Chi-square analysis performed with Yates' correction to test the null
hypothesis of independence between the sharing of bCDR3s (Public or Private) vs the cell
phenotype (DPCD3+ and CD8+). We performed this test in the 10 donors for which we have
18,000 bCDR3s in both DPCD3+ and CD8+ thymocytes. A bCDR3 is defined as public if it is found
at least once in the 18,000 bCDR3s of the same cell phenotype from other donors. The results
(p-value < 0.0001) rejected the null hypothesis, thereby indicating the interdependency of the
two variables.

Supplementary table 3. Enrichment of virus-specific bCDR3s from the single-cell sequencing
dataset16 in clustered CD8+ thymocytes. Contingency table for the Chi-square analysis

performed with the Yates correction to test the null hypothesis of independence between the
specificity of bCDR3s (Virus Dex+ and Unknown specificity) vs the connection of bCDR3s
(“clustered” and “dispersed”) in all CD8+ thymocytes from 12 donors. The results (p-value <
0.0001) rejected the null hypothesis, thereby indicating the interdependency of the two
variables.
