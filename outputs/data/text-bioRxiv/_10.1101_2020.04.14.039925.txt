Summary

46

Antiviral treatments targeting the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently required.

47

We screened a panel of already-approved drugs in a cell culture model of severe acute respiratory

48

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and identified two new antiviral agents: the HIV protease inhibitor

49

Nelfinavir and the anti-inflammatory drug Cepharanthine. In silico modeling shows Nelfinavir binds the

50

SARS-CoV-2 main protease consistent with its inhibition of viral replication, whilst Cepharanthine inhibits

51

viral attachment and entry into cells. Consistent with their different modes of action, in vitro assays

52

highlight a synergistic effect of this combined treatment to limit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. Mathematical

53

modeling in vitro antiviral activity coupled with the known pharmacokinetics for these drugs predicts that

54

Nelfinavir will facilitate viral clearance. Combining Nelfinavir/Cepharanthine enhanced their predicted

55

efficacy to control viral proliferation, to ameliorate both the progression of disease and risk of transmission.

56

In summary, this study identifies a new multidrug combination treatment for COVID-19.

Introduction

60

The novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory

61

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health problem that is impacting social and

62

economic damage worldwide (Huang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). As of April 12,

63

2020,

64

countries/areas/territories (WHO). COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health

65

Organization (WHO), however, there is no approved treatment. Several drugs have been evaluated in

66

COVID-19 patients in clinical trials: including Lopinavir (LPV) and Ritonavir, Chloroquine (CLQ),

67

Favipiravir (FPV), and Interferon, all repurposed FDA-approved drugs, together with Remdesivir (RDV),

68

an antiviral agent that awaits clinical approval (Cao et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020; Touret and de

69

Lamballerie, 2020).

treatment options are urgently needed.

In this study, we screened a panel of FDA/EMA/PMDA-approved drugs in a SARS-CoV-2 infection cell

72

culture assay and identified two, Nelfinavir (NFV) and Cepharanthine (CEP), that show more potent

73

antiviral activity in this in vitro screen compared to drugs currently being trialed. Our screen shows that

74

both NFV and CEP inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations that can be achieved in the clinic and their

75

different modes of action provide an exciting opportunity for combined multidrug treatment against

76

COVID-19.

Results

80

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Nelfinavir and Cepharanthine.

81

We established a cell-based drug screening system to identify compounds that protect cells from

82

SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathology (Fig. 1A): VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were treated with compounds for

83

1 h during inoculation with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (Matsuyama et al., 2020) at a multiplicity of

84

infection (MOI) of 0.01. Unbound virus was removed by washing and the cells treated with compounds

85

for 48 h to assess cell viability (Fig. 1A) (Methods).

86

induced a cytopathic effect and to validate our assay we show that two compounds, LPV and CLQ, that

87

were reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection (Wang, M. et al., 2020), reduced virus-induced

88

cytopathicity (Fig. 1B, compare b and c, d).

SARS-CoV-2 replication in VeroE6/TMPRSS2

89

After screening 306 FDA/EMA/PMDA-approved drugs, we identified compounds that protected cell

90

viability by 20-fold compared with a DMSO solvent control (Methods) (Supplementary Table S1). Among

91

these, we selected to study NFV and CEP as candidates showing the greatest anti-cytopathic activity

92

(Fig. 1B, f and g). NFV targets human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease and CEP is a Stephania-

93

derived alkaloid extract having anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities (Bailly, 2019; Kao et al.,

94

2015; Markowitz et al., 1998). To confirm and extend these observations we assessed SARS-CoV-2

95

encoded N protein expression 24 h post-inoculation by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C, red) and

96

immunoblotting (Fig. 1D). Both NFV and CEP significantly reduced N protein expression, confirming

97

these compounds inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation.

98

treated cells with a range of drug concentrations and measured secreted viral RNA 24 h post-infection.

99

NFV and CEP, together with CLQ and LPV, significantly reduced viral RNA levels in a dose-dependent

100

manner to 0.001 ~ 0.01% of the untreated control infections (Fig. 1E). FPV showed negligible antiviral

101

activity against SARS-CoV-2, consistent with previous reports (Choy et al., 2020; Wang, M. et al., 2020).

102

In parallel we assessed cell viability and noted cell death at high drug concentrations up to 64 µM (Fig.

103

1F). The concentration of drugs required to inhibit 50% (IC50) or 90% (IC90) of virus replication along

104

with their 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) are listed in Fig. 1E and F. These experiments highlight a > 70-fold

105

window (CC50/IC50) where NFV and CEP can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation with minimal toxicity.

To quantify their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, we

106

We previously reported a method to quantify instantaneous inhibitory potential (IIP) (Koizumi et al.,

107

2017) and imply that NFV and CEP will have higher antiviral potentials than LPV and CLQ, respectively

108

(Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table S2).

109
110

Modes of action of Nelfinavir and Cepharanthine.

111

To define how these compounds impact on the viral replicative life cycle, we performed a time of

112

addition assay (Fig. 2A). We measured the antiviral activity of drugs added at different times: (a) present

113

during the 1 h virus inoculation step and maintained throughout the 24 h infection period (whole life

114

cycle); (b) present during the 1 h virus inoculation step and for an additional 2 h and then removed

115

(entry); or (c) added after the inoculation step and present for the remaining 22 h of infection (post-entry).

116

CLQ, a known modulator of intracellular pH that non-specifically inhibits virus entry (Akpovwa, 2016), was

117

recently reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 (Liu, J. et al., 2020; Wang, M. et al., 2020) and we confirmed its

118

activity in the early stages of infection (Fig. 2B, lane 8). RDV was previously reported to inhibit the

119

process for intracellular viral replication (Wang, M. et al., 2020) and we confirmed this mode of action

120

showing a reduction in viral RNA levels with a negligible effect on virus entry (Fig. 2B, lane 5).

121

This assay identified NFV as a replication inhibitor whilst CEP targeted the virus entry phase (Fig. 2B,

122

lanes 10-15). These data are consistent with reports that LPV and NFV inhibited the replication of other

123

coronaviruses, SARS-CoV (Liu et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2004; Yamamoto et al., 2004), and that CEP

124

reduced the entry of human coronavirus OC43 (Kim et al., 2019).

125

Since NFV binds the HIV-1 protease we used an in silico docking simulation to assess its potential

126

interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 encoded main protease (Fig. 2C). NFV was ranked in the top 1.5% of

127

compounds following an in silico screen of the SARS-CoV-2 encoded main protease (see Methods) (Fig.

128

2C, cyan stick: NFV, green: main protease). Our docking model predicts that NFV interacts with the

129

SARS-CoV-2 protease active site pocket and would block the recruitment of substrates.

130

To investigate whether CEP inhibits SARS-CoV-2 particle attachment or internalization into cells, we

131

established an assay to measure viral attachment to cells by pre-chilling to inhibit particle endocytosis.

132

Cell-bound virus particles are measured by qPCR of viral RNA.

133

heparan sulfate proteoglycans to initiate low affinity attachment and heparin shows broad-spectrum

134

inhibition of virus-cell attachment (De Clercq, 1998; Lang et al., 2011). Unsurprisingly, heparin blocked

135

SARS-CoV-2 particle attachment to VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (Fig. 2D).

136

significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 attachment to cells, whereas CLQ that targets intracellular trafficking

137

pathways (Liu, J. et al., 2020) had no effect (Fig. 2D). In silico docking simulation confirms that CEP

138

molecule (a major component of the pharmaceutical preparation of CEP) can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Spike

139

protein and interfere with the Spike engagement to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

140

(Lan et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wang, Q. et al., 2020) (Fig. 2E, green stick: CEP molecule, orange:

141

Spike, semi-transparent cyan: ACE2). These data highlight a new role for CEP to inhibit SARS-CoV-2

142

particle attachment to cells.

We demonstrate that CEP

143
144

Nelfinavir and Cepharanthine show synergistic antiviral activity.

145

NFV showed a modest increase in antiviral activity (IC90 of 1.18 µM) compared to LPV (IC90 of 3.61

146

µM), similarly CEP (IC90 of 0.91 µM) showed greater antiviral activity than CLQ (IC90 of 3.97 µM).

147

Importantly, both NFV and CEP show anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity within the concentration ranges achieved

148

in patients, where the Cmax of both drugs are 6.9 and 2.3 µM (by administration of 500 mg NFV orally and

149

of 100 mg CEP by intravenous injection) respectively (Markowitz et al., 1998; Yasuda et al., 1989).

150

Since NFV and CEP have different mode of actions, we examined their potential for synergistic effects.

151

Antiviral activity and cell viability were determined by qPCR enumeration of viral RNA and MTT activity,

152

respectively, following treatment with each compound alone or in combination (Fig. 3).

153

experiments, we infected cells with lower amounts of SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.001) than used in our earlier

154

drug screen. Single treatment with NFV or CEP reduced viral RNA in a dose-dependent manner and

155

co-treatment further reduced viral RNA levels (Fig. 3A): e.g. NFV (2.24 µM) or CEP (3.20 µM) alone

156

reduced viral RNA to 5.8% and 6.3% of untreated control, respectively, however, their combination

157

reduced viral RNA level to 0.068%. Higher doses of the NFV/CEP combined treatment (4 µM each)

158

reduced the viral RNA to undetectable levels. We compared the observed experimental antiviral activity

159

(Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S1A) with theoretical predictions calculated using a classical Bliss

160

independence method that assumes the drugs act independently (Supplementary Note, Supplementary

161

Fig. S1B) (Greco et al., 1995; Koizumi and Iwami, 2014). The difference between the observed values

162

and theoretical predictions suggest that NFV and CEP exhibit a synergistic activity over a broad range of

163

concentrations (Fig. 3C red: synergistic effect).

Modeling the impact of Nelfinavir and Cepharanthine on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics.

166

Combining the published clinical pharmacokinetics information for these drugs with our observed

167

dose-dependent antiviral activities, we can predict the time-dependent antiviral activity (Fig. 4A: left, NFV

168

oral; center, CEP intravenous drip; right: CEP oral) and the resultant viral load dynamics after drug

169

administration (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Note, Supplementary Fig. S2). From such viral dynamics shown

170

in Fig. 4B, we calculated the cumulative viral RNA burden (i.e., area under the curve of viral load) (Fig.

171

4C, upper) and the time period to reduce the viral load to undetectable levels (Fig. 4C, lower). Our

172

modeling analysis predict that NFV would reduce the cumulative viral load by 91.4% (Fig. 4C, upper, red)

173

and would require 11.9 days to eliminate virus (Fig. 4B, upper left, red), 3.98 days shorter than non-

174

treatment condition (Fig. 4C, lower, red). In contrast, treatment with CEP alone showed a limited effect

175

on the viral load [Fig. 4B, upper right or lower left, green], most likely reflecting the low concentration of

176

the drug when administered orally or by intravenous drip (see Discussion). However, co-administering

177

NFV (oral) and CEP (intravenous drip) resulted in a more rapid decline in viral RNA, with undetectable

178

levels 5.5 days earlier than non-treatment and 1.5 days earlier than NFV alone (Fig. 4C).

179

advantage of combination treatment is discussed in Discussion. In summary, NFV is likely to show

180

antiviral activity at clinically achievable drug concentration and combination treatment with CEP will

181

facilitate virus elimination.

Another

184

Discussion

185

Screening a panel of approved drugs identified two agents, NFV and CEP, with potent antiviral activity

186

against SARS-CoV-2. NFV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication and our modeling data suggests this is

187

mediated via a direct interaction with the viral encoded main protease (Fig. 2B and C). A recent study

188

reported that CEP exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (Fan et al., 2020), these authors speculated that

189

CEP targeted both the entry and viral replication phase. However, our time of addition experiments

190

suggest that CEP predominantly inhibits viral entry (Fig. 2B, lane 14).

191

attachment assays and docking simulations confirm that CEP inhibits virus attachment to target cells (Fig.

192

2D and E). There is a significant global effort to generate a COVID-19 vaccine that will target the SARS-

193

CoV-2 encoded Spike glycoprotein (Thanh Le et al., 2020) that is required for particle engagement of the

194

receptor ACE2 for infecting cells. We predict that CEP may work synergistically with vaccine induced

195

anti-S antibody responses and such experiments are worthy of future investigation. Further mechanistic

196

studies will be required to confirm the proposed mechanisms of action of these compounds. However,

197

our observation that NFV and CEP target different steps in the viral life cycle support the development of

198

multidrug combination therapies for treating COVID-19.

Furthermore, virus-cell

199

Our mathematical modeling studies assess how anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates can suppress virus

200

proliferation and facilitate virus elimination (Fig. 4). At clinical doses NFV can maintain strong antiviral

201

effect over time and thus can reduce SARS-CoV-2 RNA burden that results in shortening the time required

202

to eliminate infection.

203

because of a low concentration in vivo when administered by oral or intravenous drip. However, higher

204

doses of CEP, based on its relatively safe toxicity profile (Rogosnitzky and Danks, 2011), may increase

205

drug efficacy in a clinical setting. It is noteworthy that combining CEP with NFV further reduced the

206

cumulative viral load and facilitated virus elimination. As the cumulative viral load in patients is likely to

207

be closely related with the progression of disease and the risk for new transmission (Liu, Y. et al., 2020),

208

such multidrug treatment will be of benefit to improve clinical outcome and to control epidemic.

209

addition to potentiating antiviral effects, multidrug treatment can limit the emergence of viral drug-

In contrast, CEP monotherapy is predicted to have a modest antiviral effect

210

resistance which is frequently reported for RNA viruses such as coronavirus.

211

One limitation of our modeling of drug efficacy is the use of in vitro data derived cell culture infection

212

systems without confirmation using in vivo infection models. Recently, a SARS-CoV-2 infection system

213

was reported using ferrets, but as yet there is no evidence on the usefulness of this model for evaluating

214

anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs (Kim et al., 2020). Given the urgency of the problem, this lack of in vivo testing

215

should not prevent the assessment of new antiviral agents.

216

identified NFV and CEP as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. As both NFV and CEP show superior

antiviral activities compared to many current drug candidates, these agents offer a promising new

multidrug treatment to combat COVID-19.
