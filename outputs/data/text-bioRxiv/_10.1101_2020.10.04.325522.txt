Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate
viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2’ site is known to activate the S
protein for viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane.
Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin,
which expands viral tropism to lung cells. Here, we analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in related
CoVs and offer thoughts on the implications of SARS-CoV-2’s unique insert on its origin. We also utilized
viral pseudoparticles to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate
that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential for plasma membrane entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial
cell line, but not for endosomal entry Vero E6 cells, a model cell culture line, and that other proteases in
addition to furin are responsible for processing SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2.

Introduction
The 21st century has seen the rise of pathogenic strains of human coronaviruses (CoVs) causing major
public health concerns, first with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 20021,
then the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in 20122, and now, with
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease
syndrome known as COVID-193, now classified as a pandemic with global reach and devastation.
CoV host cell entry is mediated by its spike (S) glycoprotein, a large transmembrane protein that decorates
the virus particle4. The S protein is demarcated into two domains, the S1 domain, which is the receptor
binding domain, and the S2 domain, which contains the membrane fusion machinery. There are two
cleavage events associated with S-mediated membrane fusion5. The first is a priming cleavage that occurs

at the interface of the S1/S2 region (S1/S2) for some coronaviruses, and the second is the obligatory
triggering cleavage that occurs within the S2 region (S2’)5. The priming cleavage generally converts the S
protein into a fusion competent form, by enabling the S protein to better bind receptors or expose hidden
cleavage sites5. The triggering cleavage initiates a series of conformational changes that enable the S
protein to harpoon into the host membrane for membrane fusion5.
There are a variety of proteases capable of priming and triggering CoV S proteins. Depending on which
protease are available, CoV can fuse with either the plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane6.
SARS-CoV was found to utilize the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 to fuse at the plasma membrane
surface7. However, TMPRSS2 expression is limited to respiratory cell lines, and in TMPRSS2 negative cell
lines, SARS-CoV utilized endosomal cathepsin L to fuse to the endosomal membrane8. MERS-CoV was also
found to utilize TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L with one major difference. The MERS-CoV S1/S2 boundary
contains an RSVR insert that can be recognized by furin or related proprotein convertases (PC), proteases
commonly found in the secretory pathway of most cell lines9,10. During the S maturation process, the S
protein can be cleaved by furin/PCs9,10. Thus, MERS-CoV particles harbor cleaved S protein and it was
observed that the S1/S2 pre-cleavage was crucial for MERS-CoV10, but not SARS-CoV11, to infect via the
plasma membrane route. However, the S1/S2 cleavage was not a requirement for MERS-CoV endosomal
pathway infection10.
For SARS-CoV-2, early studies showed that the S1/S2 junction contained an insert with two additional
basic residues, P-R-R-A (R – arginine, A- alanine), that was not present in SARS-CoV or its closest bat
ancestor viruses12,13. This insert forms a P-R-R-A-R sequence and while it does contain the minimum furin
recognition motif, R-X-X-R, it is unusual and diverges from the preferred and canonical R-X-K/R-R motif.
Compared to the canonical motif, the residues at the P2 and P3 location for SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 are
reversed, with R at the P3 instead of the P2 location, and an A at the P2 instead of the P3 location14,15

(Figure 1). Intriguingly, the only other known example of this insert on FurinDB16, a database of furin
substrates, is found in proaerolysin, a bacterial toxin, and was determined to be activated by furin17.
Indeed, early studies suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 is also processed by furin since SARS-CoV-2 harbors a
cleaved S protein, likely due to furin processing at the S1/S2 site18–20. Similar to what was observed for
MERS-CoV, this S1/S2 cleavage was determined to be a prerequisite for TMPRSS2 activation at the S2’ for
SARS-CoV-2 infection in respiratory cell lines, such as Calu-321,22. Furthermore, like MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV2 can also utilize cathepsin L in the endosomal pathway in TMPRSS2-negative cell lines, such as Vero E620.
In this study, we sought to better characterize the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 S and raise some
intriguing possibilities for how the site might have emerged. Using pseudoparticles, we investigated the
impact of this S1/S2 cleavage for successful infection of cells via the plasma membrane and endosomal
route. Our data suggests that the S1/S2 cleavage is essential for TMPRSS2 mediated plasma membrane
entry, but not for cathepsin L mediated endosomal entry, and that furin may not be the only protease
responsible for the S1/S2 cleavage event.

Results and Discussion
Furin-cleavage predictions of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site. We used the PiTou23 and ProP24 cleavage
prediction tools to analyze the likelihood that the S1/S2 site is processed by furin, with positive scores
(PiTou) and 0.5 (ProP) indicating furin cleavage. ProP predicts furin cleavage sites based on networks
derived from experimental data, whereas PiTou uses a combination of a hidden Markov model and
biological knowledge-based cumulative probability score functions to characterize a 20 amino acid motif
from P14 to P6’ that reflects the binding strength and accessibility of the motif in the furin binding pocket.
Thus, the PiTou algorithm has been reported to be more sensitive and specific than ProP for predicting

furin cleavage23. Both algorithms agree with each other in predicting furin cleavage, strengthening the
predictions (Figure 2), but since the PiTou algorithm is more sensitive and specific, we decided to focus
on the PiTou values for further analysis.
The PiTou algorithm predicts that the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site (score: 9.2) can be cleaved by furin, whereas
other lineage B CoVs that have been proposed as SARS-CoV-2 precursors, such as SARS-CoV, RaTG13, ZC45,
ZXC21 and RmYN02, cannot be cleaved by furin. These predictions have been confirmed experimentally
as recombinant furin was shown to process the purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein, generating appropriate
cleavage products25, whereas no cleavage products were detected when processing the SARS-CoV S.
Notably, the PiTou scores of traditionally accepted furin cleavage sites, such as those found in influenza
H5N1 (score: 13.6) and HCoV-HKU1 (score: 14.6), are much higher than for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that
while SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site has increased furin recognition when compared to other lineage B-betaCoVs,
the site is not optimal for furin cleavage. The modest SARS-CoV-2 PiTou score raises question about the
origin and evolution of the virus, possibly suggesting that it does not represent an “insertion” into the viral
genome as is typically assumed26.
In this scenario, it is worth noting that in betaCoV lineage C, MERS-CoV (score: 5.2) is barely above
threshold. In fact, within the betaCoV lineage C, there is a range of PiTou scores for the closest known bat
virus ancestors to MERS-CoV; i.e. BatCoV-HKU4 (score: <0) to BatCoV-HKU5 (score: 10.3). With this in
mind, the MERS-CoV S1/S2 site can be seen as either a gain-of-furin-cleavage mutation from BatCoV-HKU4,
or equally a loss-of-furin-cleavage from BatCoV-HKU5. Thus, for SARS-CoV-2, a simple gain-of-furincleavage may not necessarily be the cause of increased disease, leaving open the potential for a yet-to-be
discovered ancestor virus in bats with a robust furin cleavage site (i.e. score approx. 13-15), but one that
may not have gained the capacity to bind a human receptor and for which a robust furin cleavage site may
be been down-regulated or expanded to other proteases with less specific recognition motifs. These

suggested parallels are informed by betaCoV lineage C where MERS-CoV (score: 5.2) and BatCoV-HKU4
bind hDPP4, but with BatCoV-HKU5 (score: 10.3) unable to bind this receptor27. Overall, while it is
generally believed that the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site is a gained furin insert, we consider it is important to
consider alternative explanations—especially as the search continues to determine the origin of SARSCoV-2.
MLV pseudoparticles as a system to study SARS-CoV-2 entry. To assess the functional importance of the
S1/S2 site for SARS-CoV-2 entry, we utilized viral pseudoparticles. These particles consist of a murine
leukemia virus (MLV) core and are decorated with the viral envelope protein to accurately recapitulate
the entry steps of their native counterpart28. These particles also contain a luciferase reporter that
integrates into the host cell genome upon successful infection and drives the cells to produce luciferase,
which is quantifiable. We and others have used MLV-based pseudoparticles widely to study CoV entry
pathways9,19,29. MLV pseudoparticles exhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (SARS-CoV-2pp), or the SARSCoV S protein (SARS-CoVpp) were generated alongside positive control particles containing the vesicular
stomatitis virus G protein (VSVpp) or negative control particles (Δenvpp) lacking envelope proteins.
Since coronaviruses can enter via the plasma membrane or via endosomes, we chose to infect cell lines
representative of each pathway, as the entry mechanism can be highly cell-type dependent30. We utilized
the Calu-3 and the Vero E6 cell lines for these studies, as they are commonly used cell lines for studying
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 plasma membrane and endosomal entry, respectively. As expected, VSVpp
(positive control) infected Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells with several orders of magnitude higher luciferase
units than the values reported with Δenvpp infection (negative control) (Figure 3A, 3B). This confirms that
the envelope protein is driving infection, and not the particle itself. In the case of SARS-CoVpp and SARSCoV-2pp, both particles are infectious as they drive luciferase production several orders of magnitude
higher than Δenvpp. (Figure 3A, 3B).

It is noted that SARS-CoVpp are more infectious than SARS-CoV-2pp. To determine the cause of this
difference, we analyzed the particles via Western blot to visualize S content. For the SARS-CoV-2pp, we
detected a band at 85 kDa and for SARS-CoVpp, a strong band at 185 kDa (Figure 3C). The 85 kDa band
corresponds to the S2 segment of the S protein following S1/S2 cleavage. The 185 kDa band for the SARSCoVpp corresponds to uncleaved S protein. We observe that the SARS-CoV S band is more intense than
the SARS-CoV-2 S2 band, despite both particles showing similar intensities for the MLVp30 loading control
band. As a result, we infer that the SARS-CoVpp incorporated more S protein than SARS-CoV-2pp, resulting
in the higher infectivity observed for SARS-CoVpp transduction.
Use of the dec-RVKR-CMK protease inhibitor to produce SARS-2pp with uncleaved S. To examine the
functional role of S priming by furin/PC proteases, we needed to produce SARS-CoV-2pp expressing
uncleaved S protein. This can be accomplished by adding in an appropriate protease inhibitor to producer
cells to prevent S1/S2 cleavage during biogenesis. We chose dec-RVKR-CMK because it has been shown
to inhibit furin/PCs, preventing S1/S2 cleavage21,29,31. Indeed, we previously showed that addition of decRVKR-CMK to producer cells generates MLV pseudotyped particles that harbor full-length MERS-CoV S
protein (MERS-CoVpp)29 and we observe a similar trend with SARS-CoV-2pp generated from cells treated
with dec-RVKR-CMK (Figure 4C, lanes 1 and 4).
The dec-RVKR-CMK-treated (uncleaved) particles were used to transduce either the Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells
to observe the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infection. In Vero E6 cells, the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2pp
were 30-fold more infectious than their cleaved counterparts, suggesting that uncleaved particles result
in more infectious particles, and that the S1/S2 pre-cleavage is not required or hinders infection via the
endosomal pathway (Figure 4A). However, in Calu-3 cells, the opposite trend was observed; the uncleaved
particles were significantly less infectious than their cleaved counterparts (Figure 4B), suggesting that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.04.325522; this version posted October 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential21,22for plasma membrane entry and increased uncleaved S incorporation
cannot compensate.
Thus, we were curious if we could restore the infection of the uncleaved particles by treating them with
exogeneous furin, which has been previously shown to process purified SARS-CoV-2 S protein25. In Calu3, we observed a 2-fold increase in infection when uncleaved particles were treated with exogeneous
furin, but with cleaved particles, we did not observe any statistically significant increase with furin
treatment (Figure 4B). In Vero E6 cells, for both types of particles, we did not observe a statistically
significant increase in infection with furin treatment. (Figure 4A).
Since furin treatment only modestly increased infectivity in all cases observed, we wanted to visualize
how efficiently furin was processing the SARS-CoV-2 S. For cleaved particles, exogeneous furin was able
to fully reduce the faint full-length S band into S2 (Figure 4C, lanes 1 and 2). For uncleaved particles, furin
treatment had no observable impact, as the intensity of the full-length S bands are the same and there
are no additional bands shown between furin treated and non-treated particles (Figure 4C, lanes 3 and 4).
Additional bands at >185 kDa likely corresponding to dimeric and trimeric S20.
In addition, the intensity of the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2pp S bands are greater than the intensity of the
cleaved SARS-CoV-2pp S bands and this trend was observed with MERS-CoVpp S29. This likely suggests that
the increased infectivity we observed with the uncleaved SARS-CoV-2pp is due to greater S incorporation,
though the S is uncleaved.
Due to the limited ability of exogenous furin to rescue and cleave SARS-CoV-2 S, we re-evaluated the role
of furin in processing the S1/S2 site. Since dec-RVKR-CMK can also inhibit a number of furin related PCs,
the effects that have been observed with dec-RVKR-CMK particles could have resulted from inhibition of
other proteases and not furin. Therefore, we produced particles in the presence of alpha1-PDX, a potent
and more selective furin inhibitor32 than dec-RVKR-CMK. Infectivity results of these particles in Vero E6

cells that a highly furin specific inhibitor failed to recapitulate the high level of enhancement provided by
dec-RVK-CMK at all tested inhibitor concentrations (Figure 5). This indicates that furin itself may not in
fact be the only active protease processing the S1/S2 site, as is generally assumed. Other PCs within the
secretory pathway may also assist with the S1/S2 cleavage and have been observed to cleave SARS-CoV2 S1/S2 peptide33.
Lastly, we wanted to investigate if dec-RVKR-CMK inhibition affects viral proteins that do not feature a
furin S1/S2 site, such as SARS-CoV. dec-RVKR-CMK treatment had no significant impact on SARS-CoV S
mediated infection of Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells (Figure 6A and 6B), suggesting that dec-RVKR-CMK impacts
on SARS-CoV-2 S is due to inhibiting the S1/S2 pre-cleavage and not due to some general effect on protein
expression. Treatment of SARS-CoVpp with exogeneous furin also yielded no difference in protein
conformation (Figure 6C).
Overall, the results support observations21,34 that the role of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 site is to expand viral
tropism to lung cells. Cleaved S1/S2 site is crucial for the SARS-CoV-2 to be subsequently cleaved at the
S2’ location by TMPRSS2 for immediate plasma membrane entry in respiratory cells. Without the S1/S2
pre-cleavage, SARS-CoV-2 would be endocytosed, and due to low cathepsin L expression in respiratory
endosomes10, coupled with expression of antiviral restriction factors in endosomes 34, SARS-CoV-2 would
not effectively infect via respiratory endosome. If SARS-CoV-2 is infecting TMPRSS2 negative cells, it can
utilize endosomal cathepsin L, an ubiquitous protease generally found throughout mammalian cells 35, to
activate the S protein20, though at undetermined sites. However, for cathepsin L activation, S1/S2 precleavage is not required, and our results indicate that preventing this cleavage increases infectivity of
SARS-CoV-2. This may be connected to recent work showing that S1/S2 pre-cleavage reduces S thermal
stability25. Interestingly, the S1/S2 site activation appears to also have a role in the immune response

against SARS-CoV-2, as it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 S with a deleted S1/S2 loop can provide better
protective immune response than with the S1/S2 loop36.
The role of furin in activating the S1/S2 site was also investigated. As protease inhibitors commonly
employed in cell entry studies, such as dec-RVKR-CMK, can also inhibit other PCs in addition to furin31, it
is difficult to ascertain the impact of individual proteases. While furin likely can process the SARS-CoV-2
site, our data suggests that other PCs are also involved, since Western blots show poor processing of
uncleaved S upon addition of purified furin and also the use of a highly selective furin inhibitor has a
modest impact on infectivity. As we consider protease-based inhibitors in treating COVID-19, especially
those targeting furin37, it is important to thoroughly consider evaluate the role of these proteases to be
certain that the relevant proteases are targeted.
