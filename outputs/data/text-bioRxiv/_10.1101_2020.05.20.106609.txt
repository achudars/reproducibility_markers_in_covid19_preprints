Abstract
The novel highly transmissible human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus far, there is no approved therapeutic drug, specifically
targeting this emerging virus. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a panel
of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding
domain (RBD). These antibodies were selected from a phage display library constructed
using peripheral circulatory lymphocytes collected from patients at the acute phase of the
disease. These neutralizing antibodies are shown to recognize distinct epitopes on the viral
spike RBD, therefore they represent a promising basis for the design of efficient combined
post-exposure therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
The present global pandemic of coronavirus induced disease 19 (COVID-19), declared by
the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international
concern, is caused by the highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To this date, about 5 million confirmed cases and over
300,000 deaths have been reported worldwide1. Yet, there is no approved therapeutic drug
specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged as
the seventh type of coronavirus infecting humans and the third most pathogenic preceded
by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
Due to their exceptional antigen specificity, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are
considered an attractive candidate to target exposed antigenic sites on viruses, and prevent
their infectivity2. The therapeutic efficacy of mAbs, specifically targeting surface viral
proteins was demonstrated before for several viruses including SARS-CoV, MERS and
Ebola3-6.
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the surface homotrimeric Spike glycoprotein (S) as a major mediator
of cellular infection. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is composed of two distinct subunits, S1
and S2. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), known to bind the
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cell surfaces7. The S2 subunit
mediates the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, essential for viral entry into the
cell. The receptor interaction site on S1 is considered the main target for efficient
neutralization of cell infection and therefore a prime candidate for therapeutic antibody
development8-12. Although the S protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 77.5%
identity, most of the mAbs isolated against SARS-CoV reportedly failed to cross-neutralize
the novel virus13-15.
For designing optimal therapeutic strategies, there is an urgent need for the identification
of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 (such
antibodies may be identified either in humans in the course of illness/recovery, or in
immunized animals). Recently, first two mAbs, elicited against the SARS-CoV-2, were
reported16. Furthermore, efficient post-exposure therapy in humans, may require

integration of several noncompeting mAbs, ideally neutralizing the virus infectivity by
different mechanisms. Such combined therapies are expected to provide superior control
of potential neutralizing escape variants9,17.
Here we describe the isolation of a panel of neutralizing mAbs selected against the SARSCoV-2 RBD from phage display library constructed based on patient samples collected in
the acute phase of the disease. These specific antibodies were found to recognize distinct
epitopes and can potentially be used either for therapy or immune prophylaxis.

Materials and methods
Blood samples
Sera and whole blood samples collected from five convalescent or severe COVID-19
patients were obtained under written inform consent and treated in accordance with the
biosafety guidelines of the IIBR in BL3 facility. PBMCs were separated from fresh whole
blood using density centrifugation by Ficoll. Sera samples were heat-inactivated (30 min
at 60°C) prior to use for binding or neutralizing assays. The study was approved by the
Sheba Medical Center IRB Ethical Committee as well as by the Baruch Padeh Medical
Center IRB Ethical Committee.

Phage Display scFv libraries construction and phage Abs selection
Total RNA was purified from PBMCs using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany).
CDNA synthesis was performed using Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermoscientific, USA)
and used as a template for Abs variable region coding fragments amplification, as detailed
in Supplementary. Briefly, heavy and light Ig variable domains (VH and VL) were
amplified, using specific primer set (supplementary Table 1). The VH and VL used in PCR
overlap extension reaction, resulted in scFv repertoire cloned into pCC16 phagemid
vector22 using NcoI/NotI. Total of 9.2e6 independent clones obtained, representing the
library complexity.
Panning performed against huFc-RBD directly absorbed to polystyrene plates and against
biotinylated-huFc-RBD (biotinylation performed using a commercial kit: EZ-Link sulfoNHS-biotin, Pierce-Thermoscientific, USA) attached to streptavidin coated magnetic
beads (Dynabeads Invitrogen, USA). All routine phage display techniques, performed as

USA) to evaluate sequence variability of scFv individual clones. Following colony PCR,
5µL of the PCR products were taken directly for restriction with 0.5 µL MvaI and 1 µL
buffer x10 (provided by the manufacturer) in a 10 µL reaction volume. Restriction was
conducted for one hour at 37 ˚C, and the entire reaction mix was then resolved on 3%
agarose gel. Nucleic acid sequence analysis of individual scFv fragments, performed to the
colony PCR product, using SeqStudio Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA).

Expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike recombinant protein
Mammalian cell codon optimized nucleic sequence, coding for SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein (GenPept: QHD43416 ORF), used to design pcDNA3.1+ based expression
plasmids, mediating recombinant expression of the entire spike glycoprotein, receptor
binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), S1 and S2. Stabilized soluble version
of the spike protein (amino acids 1-1207) designed essentially as described earlier 24,25. Cterminal his-tag as well as streptag, included in all constructs in order to facilitate protein
purification.
In addition, huFc-RBD fused protein was expressed using previously designed Fc-fused
protein expression vector 26, giving rise to a protein comprising a homodimer of two RBD
moieties (amino acids 318-542, GenPept: QHD43416 ORF) fused to a dimer of IgG1
human Fc (huFc). Expression performed using ExpiCHOTM Expression system
(ThermoFisher scientific, GibcoTM).

Production of scFv-Fc Antibodies
Phagemid DNA of the desired clones were isolated using QIAprep spin Miniprep kit
(Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and the entire scFv was cloned into a pcDNA3.1+
based expression vector that was modified, providing the scFv with the human (IgG1)
CH2-CH3 Fc fragments, resulting in scFv-Fc antibody format. ScFv-Fc were expressed
using ExpiCHOTM Expression system (ThermoFisher scientific, GibcoTM) and purified on
HiTrap Protein-A column (GE healthcare, UK).

ELISA
Routine ELISA protocol applied essentially as described27. Coating performed using 2
μg/ml protein. For phage ELISA, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Sino Biologicals,
USA) was used following detection with TMB substrate (Millipore, USA). ELISA of both
sera and recombinant scFv-Fc human antibodies applied with AP-conjugated anti-human
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) following detection using PNPP substrate (Sigma,
Israel).

Biolayer interferometry for affinity measurements and epitope binning
Binding studies were carried out using the Octet system (ForteBio, USA, Version 8.1,
2015) that measures biolayer interferometry (BLI). All steps were performed at 30°C with
shaking at 1500 rpm in a black 96-well plate containing 200 μl solution in each well.
Streptavidin-coated biosensors were loaded with biotinylated antibody (1-5 µg/ml) to reach
0.7-1 nm wavelength shift followed by a wash. The sensors were then reacted for 300
seconds with increasing concentrations of RBD (association phase) and then transferred to
buffer-containing wells for another 600 seconds (dissociation phase). Binding and
dissociation were measured as changes over time in light interference after subtraction of
parallel measurements from unloaded biosensors. Sensorgrams were fitted with a 1:1
binding model using the Octet data analysis software 8.1 (Fortebio, USA, 2015), and the
presented values are an average of several repeated measurements. For the binning
experiments of antibodies pairs, antibody-loaded sensors were incubated with a fixed RBD
concentration (300 nM), washed and incubated with the non-labeled antibody counterpart.

Cells
Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL-1586TM) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Summit Pharmaceuticals International, Japan). Cells were used and maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), MEM non-essential amino acids, 2 nM L-Glutamine, 100 Units/ml Penicilin,
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 12.5 Units/ml Nystatin (Biological Industries, Israel). Cells
were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 at 95% air atmosphere.

Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)
SARS-CoV-2 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_406862) was kindly provided by Bundeswehr
Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany. Stocks were prepared by infection of Vero
E6 cells for two days. When CPE was observed, media were collected, clarified by
centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at -80°C. Titer of stock was determined by plaque
assay using Vero E6 cells. Handling and working with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in
BL3 facility in accordance with the biosafety guidelines of the IIBR.

400 μl of MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, MEM non-essential amino acids, 2 nM LGlutamine, 100 Units/ml Penicilin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 12.5 Units/ml Nystatin
(Biological Industries, Israel). 400 μl containing 300 PFU/ml of SARS-CoV-2 virus were
then added to the mAb solution supplemented with 0.25% guinea pig complement sera
(Sigma, Israel) and the mixture incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Monolayers were
then washed once with DMEM w/o FBS and 200 μl of each mAb-virus mixture was added
in duplicates to the cells for 1 hour. Virus mixture w/o mAb was used as control. 2 ml
overlay [MEM containing 2% FBS and 0.4% tragacanth (Sigma, Israel)] were added to
each well and plates were further incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 hours. The number of
plaques in each well was determined following media aspiration, cells fixation and staining
with 1 ml of crystal violet (Biological Industries, Israel). NT50 was defined as mAb
concentration at which the plaque number was reduced by 50%, compared to plaque
number of the control (in the absence of Ab).

Results and Discussion
Isolation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
Several blood samples, either from COVID-19 convalescence or from patients with severe
ongoing disease, were evaluated for titers of RBD binding and viral neutralization activity.
Two blood samples, exhibiting the highest neutralizing ability (NT50 >5000),
demonstrating significant binding to both S1 subunit [DIL50 (half-dilution value) of 494
and 473] and RBD (DIL50 of 252 and 226; Fig. 1a), were subsequently selected for antibody
library generation.
A phage display (PD) single chain Fv (scFv) library, representing approx. 10 million
distinct antibodies, was constructed. With the objective of isolating neutralizing Abs, three
consecutive enrichment steps of panning were performed against both S1 and RBD.
Resulting clones were tested for their ability to bind S1, the positive once were expressed
as full-length antibodies (in a scFv-Fc format) for further analysis. Subsequently, eight
RBD-specific antibodies carrying unique sequences were selected (Fig 1b).
Binding specificity assays of these eight antibodies confirmed their specificity to the spike
protein, the S1 subunit and the RBD, while no reactivity was observed against the Spike N
terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein (Fig. 1c). Evaluation of the Abs affinity toward
S1 by ELISA evidenced apparent KD values of 1.8-3.8 nM of six of the antibodies, and a
KD values of 12.7 and 15.6 nM of MD45 and MD63, respectively (Fig. 1d). To further
characterize these antibodies, biolayer interferometry (BLI) measurements of the
antibodies affinity specifically toward RBD was conducted, revealing KD values of 0.4 to
5.8 nM for all antibodies, with MD29 showing the highest affinity and MD67 showing the
lowest affinity (Fig. 1e). It should be noted that the biotinylation of MD47 was found to
significantly hinder its ability to bind RBD and therefore was not evaluated in this format.
Additional sequence analysis by IgBlast18 (Fig 1b) revealed that antibodies MD17, MD29
and MD63 share common germ line origin of both their VH and VK (IGHV3-64 and
IGKV1-39, respectively). Similarly, MD45 and MD67, share common VH and VK germ
lines (IGHV3-53 and IGKV3-20). The VH of MD62, is similar to the one of MD45 and
MD67, accompanied by a unique VK (IGKV1-12), while MD65 shared the same VK with

MD45 and MD67, accompanied by a unique VH (IGHV3-66). MD47 originated from
unique VH (IGHV3-23) and was the only mAb, carrying VL (IGLV3-21).

Classification of antibody epitopes
SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD is known to mediate the binding of the human ACE2 receptor
and thus, this domain is considered as main target for neutralizing mAbs. However, direct
blocking of the RBD-ACE2 interaction is not the exclusive modality by which neutralizing
antibodies can exert their effect21. Consequently, the selected mAbs, were classified on the
basis of their epitope specificity determined by BLI epitope binning. In this assay, each
individual antibody was biotinylated, immobilized to a streptavidin sensor, loaded with
RBD and then challenged with each of the other antibodies. Simultaneous binding of the
second antibody to RBD induces a wavelength shift in the interference pattern, which
indicates that the two antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes19. Conversely, if the two
antibodies bind the same or partially-overlapping epitope on RBD, no or very low
wavelength shift, respectively, is induced. As a representative example, sensograms of the
various antibody interactions with a pre-complexed MD65-RBD is shown (Fig. 2a).
Antibody MD65 used as a negative control, and did not elicit any wavelength shift, as
expected. In contrast, antibodies MD29, MD47, MD62 and MD63 induced a marked
wavelength shift indicating that they could bind to RBD simultaneously with MD65. The
analysis revealed that antibodies MD45 and MD67 could not bind to RBD in the presence
of MD65, indicating that these three antibodies target the same epitope. Analysis was then
performed for the next seven antibodies and the ability of each pair to simultaneously bind
RBD was determined (Fig. 2b). Results ranged from full to no competition and enabled the
classification of the mAbs into 4 groups recognizing distinct epitopes (Fig 2c): I (MD17,
MD29 and MD63); II (MD45, MD65 and MD67); III (MD62) and IV (MD47).
Most notably, the classification of the antibodies on the basis of their specific targeted
antigenic epitopes, is strongly supported by their observed sequence similarity, as
discussed above. Group I mAbs shared the same V germ lines and were found to target the
same epitope. Similarly, mAbs MD45 and MD67 which shared the same V germ lines and
the same epitope, were classified as group II. Although MD65 differ in its VH germ line,
he was included in this group as well. On the other hand, MD62 sharing the same VH germ
line with MD45 and MD67, appears to bind a distinct epitope (III). Finally, MD47
exhibited both a unique sequence and targeted a unique epitope (Fig. 2c).

Recently, the RBD-located epitope recognized by the SARS-CoV specific antibody
CR3022, was determined14,20. We chose to use this antibody in order to further determine
the epitopes recognized by the antibodies described in this report. Therefore, a recombinant
in-house version of this antibody was generated (Supplementary data) and used in epitope
binning assays, together with the selected set of novel mAbs. CR3022 IgG was
immobilized to the BLI sensor, loaded with RBD and further challenged with each of the
selected mAbs. Group I mAbs were found to compete with the CR3022 as evidenced by
the lack of interaction with the mAb-RBD complex (Supplementary Fig. 1). The remaining
five tested mAbs did bind the RBD in the presence of the CR3022 antibody. These results
suggest that antibodies MD17, MD29 and MD63 bind to the RBD epitope that spans the
RBD residues 369-386, previously defined as the CR3022 epitope20.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by the novel human antibodies
The neutralization potency of the antibodies was evaluated by plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT) using VeroE6 cells infected with the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2.
A fixed amount of the virus was incubated with increasing concentrations of each antibody,
the mixture was then added to the cells, and the number of plaques was quantified 48 hours
later. Antibodies MD45, MD67, MD62 and MD65 displayed the highest neutralization
potency, with a neutralization dose needed to inhibit 50% of the plaques (NT50) of 2.1, 1.9,
1.6 and 0.22 g/ml, respectively. MD65 exhibited the highest neutralization capacity
amongst the entire set of antibodies (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, antibodies MD17, MD29 and
MD63 shared DNA sequence homology indicative of a common germ line and competed
for the same epitope, yet only the first two showed neutralizing activity (NT50 of 43 and 13
g/ml, respectively). This discrepancy may be explained by differences in the affinities of
the antibodies in this group. A recent report similarly documented that antibody CR3022
(targeting an epitope overlapping with MD17 and MD29, see above) does not neutralize
the novel SARS-CoV-2 presumably due to its low binding affinity to the RBD (115 nM)20.
Additional antibody tested in this study, MD47, which represents a unique epitopic group,
also showed neutralizing activity with NT50 of 13 g/ml. Note that irrelevant Ab, RB18
(scFv-Fc) targeting abrin toxin, showed no neutralization against the virus.

To conclude, we report the isolation and characterization of a set of fully human SARSCoV-2, neutralizing antibodies that target four distinct epitopes on the spike RBD. As
neutralizing antibodies are generally known to be useful as post-exposure therapy for viral
infection and more specifically for treatment of human corona viral diseases3,21, we suggest
that these antibodies might serve as an efficient treatment of COVID-19 patients or for

epitopes, they can be combined to further improve treatment efficacy and to reduce the risk
of the emergence of treatment-escaping viral variants.
