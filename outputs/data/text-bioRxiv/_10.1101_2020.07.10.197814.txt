Abstract
The trimeric spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus of most vaccine design and
development efforts. Due to intrinsic instability typical of class I fusion proteins, S tends to
prematurely refold to the post-fusion conformation, compromising immunogenic properties and
prefusion trimer yields. To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structurebased design of soluble S trimers, with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of
single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify two regions in the S-protein critical for
the protein’s stability: the heptad repeat region 1 of the S2 subunit and subunit domain 1 at the
interface with S2. We combined a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create
a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no
longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly
folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation. Highly stable and well producing S protein
and the increased understanding of S protein structure will support vaccine development and
serological diagnostics.

Introduction
Development of effective preventative interventions against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Zhou, Yang et al. 2020, Zhu, Zhang et al. 2020) is urgently
needed. The viral surface spike (S) protein is a key target for prophylactic measures as it is critical
in the viral life cycle and the primary target of neutralizing antibodies (Brouwer, Caniels et al.
2020, Chen, Hotez et al. 2020, Liu, Wang et al. 2020, Yuan, Wu et al. 2020). S is a large, trimeric
glycoprotein that mediates both binding to host cell receptors and fusion of virus and host cell

membranes, facilitated by its S1 and S2 subunits respectively (Bosch, van der Zee et al. 2003, Li
2016, Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020). The S1 subunit comprises two distinct domains: an N-terminal
domain (NTD) and a host cell receptor-binding domain (RBD). For infection, S requires
proteolytic cleavage by a furin-like protease between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2), and by
TMPRSS2 at a conserved site directly preceding the fusion peptide (S2’) (Bestle, Heindl et al.
2020, Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber et al. 2020). In the pre-fusion state, the S-protein's RBD domains
alternate between open (‘up’) and closed (‘down’) conformations, transiently exposing the
receptor’s binding site, in the ‘up’ conformation, which can bind to human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2). Like other class I fusion proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is intrinsically
metastable as a consequence of its ability to undergo these conformational changes to drive fusion.
The prefusion conformation of S as present on the infectious particle contains the epitopes
for neutralizing antibodies and thus holds most promise as vaccine immunogen (Brouwer, Caniels
et al. 2020, Chen, Hotez et al. 2020, Hsieh, Goldsmith et al. 2020, Liu, Wang et al. 2020, Robbiani,
Gaebler et al. 2020, Yuan, Wu et al. 2020). Prefusion stabilization typically increases the
recombinant expression of viral glycoproteins which facilitates the production of protein for
(subunit) vaccines and improves the immune response elicited by recombinant protein and viral
vector vaccines (Graham, Gilman et al. 2019). In recent years, efforts have been made to stabilize
various class I fusion proteins through structure-based design (for review see (Graham, Gilman et
al. 2019)). A particularly successful approach to enhance prefusion stability was shown to be the
stabilization of the so-called hinge loop preceding the central helix (CH) which has been applied
to a range of viral fusion glycoproteins, (Sanders, Vesanen et al. 2002, Krarup, Truan et al. 2015,
Battles, Mas et al. 2017, Hastie, Zandonatti et al. 2017, Rutten, Lai et al. 2018, Rutten, Gilman et
al. 2020). Stabilization of the hinge loop of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been

achieved by mutation of two consecutive residues to proline in the S2 subunit between the central
helix (CH) and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) (Pallesen, Wang et al. 2017, Kirchdoerfer, Wang et al. 2018)
and this approach (2P) has successfully been applied into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Wrapp,
Wang et al. 2020). However, the S protein carrying these substitutions with additional furin site
mutations (S-2P) remains unstable and strategies have recently been described to improve stability
(Henderson, Edwards et al. 2020, Hsieh, Goldsmith et al. 2020, McCallum, Walls et al. 2020,
Xiong, Qu et al. 2020). Comparison of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-2P (Walls, Park et al. 2020,
Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020) with that of native SARS-CoV-2 S (Cai, Zhang et al. 2020, Ke, Oton et
al. 2020) shows that the former adopts a more open conformation with one or more of the RBDs
in the ‘up’ conformation. Although neutralizing antibodies have been mapped to the RBD in the
up as well as in the down state, the antibodies that bind the conserved epitopes on RBD in the
down state were described to have the highest neutralizing potency (Brouwer, Caniels et al. 2020,
Liu, Wang et al. 2020, Robbiani, Gaebler et al. 2020). Therefore, stabilizing the S in its closed (3
RBDs down) state and arresting the first step in the conformational change may result in an
improved vaccine immunogen.
Using structure-based design, we found novel stabilizing mutations in both the S1 and S2
domains. Combining several of the novel mutations resulted in a highly stable S trimer, S-closed,
with increased expression that remained stable in the absence of a heterologous trimerization
domain that is typically required in soluble S designs (Walls, Tortorici et al. 2016, Pallesen, Wang
et al. 2017, Walls, Park et al. 2020, Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020). Assessment of its antigenicity and
high-resolution EM confirm that this trimer adopts a closed conformation.

To stabilize the S-protein in the closed pre-fusion state, we took a rational approach based
on the structure of S (Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020). We searched for cavity filling substitutions, buried
charges and possibilities for forming disulfides. We expanded our search for proline and glycine
mutations, beyond the previously described hinge loop in the S-2P variant. Mutations were
identified computationally with Rosetta’s mutant design (Kuhlman, Dantas et al. 2003) and
Bioluminate cysteine bridge scanning (Salam, Adzhigirey et al. 2014) followed by visual
inspection of molecular interactions. Selected mutations are presented in Fig. S1 and fall in two
structural categories – SD1 head mutations N532P, T572I, D614N and S2 loop mutations A942P,
T941G, T941P, S943G, A944P, A944G (loop α13α14) and A892P (loop α10α11). Disulfides
F888C+G880C (DS1) and S884C+A893C (DS2) were identified in loop α10α11.
S ectodomain variants with mutations according to Fig. S1 were expressed as single chain
by mutation of the furin site (ΔFurin) and addition of a C-terminal foldon (Fd) trimerization
domain with (S-2P) or without the two previously described stabilizing prolines in the hinge loop
(Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020). Supernatants of Expi293F cells transfected with plasmids encoding
the S variants were tested for trimer content (Fig 1A) and for RBD exposure of the S protein by
ACE2 binding (Fig. 1B). All mutations significantly increased trimer yields and ACE2 binding of
the S protein for either the ΔFurin or S-2P variants. A strong effect was observed with T941P,
A942P and A944P. A942P showed a ~11-fold increase in expression for ΔFurin, and ~3-fold for
S-2P (Fig. 1A). For T941P, A944G and K986P shorter retention times were observed likely
indicating opening of the trimers. T941P and A944G showed the highest ACE2 binding amongst
the α13α14 loop mutations and K986P resulted in a ~10-fold higher ACE2 binding, whereas the
trimer yield was only ~3-fold higher than Furin. This indicates that the RBD domains are more
exposed.

Stability of the single point mutants was further characterized with purified proteins using
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). First, we tested the contribution to stability of the
individual proline mutations of the S-2P variant (Fig. 1C left panel, Table S1). All curves showed
two melting events (Tm50’s), albeit with different ratios. ΔFurin and additional V987P show a
major Tm50 at 64C and a minor Tm50 around 49C. This is inverted for the K986P mutant in which
the lower temperature transition is dominant. Combination of both prolines reduced the lower and
increased the higher Tm50. Amongst the S2 mutants (Fig. 1C central panel, Table S1) D614N
diminished the peak height of the first Tm50 and increased the second by almost 2C, which was
confirmed with differential scanning fluorimetry DSF (Fig. S2). A similar effect was observed for
T572I and the loop stabilizing mutations A892P and DS1, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 1C right
panel, Table S1). A942P which increased trimer yields hardly affected thermal stability in DSC
(Fig. 1C right panel) nor DSF (Fig. S2).
RBD exposure was characterized by binding of ACE2; neutralizing antibody SAD-S35 and
non-neutralizing antibody CR3022 that compete with ACE2. ACE2 and SAD-S35 can only bind
RBD in the ‘up’ configuration and CR3022 can only bind when 2 RBDs are in the ‘up’
configuration (Yuan, Wu et al. 2020). The variant with K986P showed higher binding of SADS35, ACE2 and CR3022 than S-2P (Fig. 1D left panel), in accordance with the results obtained
with SEC and AlphaLISA in supernatants. D614N and T572I showed very low binding to SADS35 and ACE2 and almost no CR3022 binding (Fig. 1D right panel), indicating more closed
trimers. A892P improved trimer closure to a lesser extent, while A942P seemed to increase its
opening. These mutants likely exhibit a mixture of closed, 1-up and 2-up structures.
The purified S variants with higher Tm50 and lower Ab binding compared to S-2P also
showed longer retention times in SEC (Fig. S3), in agreement with a more compact structure. The

largest shift was caused by D614N. Since 614 corresponds to a position in the S protein subject to
most extensive adaptation to the human host - D614G (Korber, Fischer et al. 2020), this variant
was also tested for expression and stability. The results show that the D614G change has a very
similar effect as D614N. Both increase trimer yields, increase Tm by ~2C (Fig. S4) and reduce
SAD-S35, ACE2 and CR3022 binding substantially (data not shown). Interestingly, both D614G
and D614N full length variants show increased fusogenicity compared to wildtype D614 (Fig. S5).
Next, we made variants with combined mutations to evaluate if the effects on expression, trimer
closure and stability are additive. Being located in different protein domains, D614N and A892P
were both selected for their positive effect on the stability of the spike and A942P for its strong
increase in protein yields (Fig 1A). These mutations were combined with hinge loop prolines
resulting

D614N+A892P+A942P+V987P and a quintuple mutant S-closed+Fd+K986P. Although both
combos showed similar, approximately 5-fold improvement in yields compared to S-2P, the
addition of K986P increased ACE2 binding (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the quadruple mutant in which
the foldon trimerization domain is deleted (S-closed), showed a 6.4-fold improvement in yields
compared to S-2P. Its trimer peak was shifted towards longer retention times due to the smaller
size which was confirmed by MALS analysis (Fig. 2A, Table S2).
S-closed with and without foldon were further characterized for resilience during repeated
freeze-thaw cycles (Fig. 2B and Table S3). Analytical SEC showed that only 8% of the original S2P trimer was present after 3, and only 1% after 5 cycles (Fig 2B, right panel). The trimer content
is significantly improved for S-closed retaining 55% of intact trimers after 3, and 35% after 5
freeze-thaw cycles. Higher thermal stability of the combos was shown with only a single Tm50 at

about 66C (Fig. 2C). All combos displayed decreased levels of ACE2 and antibody binding
compared to S-2P control (Fig 2D, Fig. S6).
The S-closed+Fd quadruple mutant was then imaged by cryo-EM. A 2-steps 3D
classification illustrates that out of 833,000 classified particles, ~80% was closed with all RBDs
in the down state and 38% was categorized into a well-defined closed class and ~20% showed 1
RBD-up (Figure S7). Further processing of the 320,000 closed conformation particles allowed us
to obtain a 3.06Å electron potential map (Figure S8). An atomic model that was built into the
potential confirmed that S retains the prefusion spike conformation (Fig 3). The NTDs and RBDs
density is less defined than for the rest of the map, suggesting flexibility in these regions. The
closed structure (see Fig 3A) is highly reminiscent of the one previously solved by Walls et al
(Walls, Park et al. 2020).

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are unstable and although introduction of a double proline (K986P
and V987P) in the hinge loop at the C-terminus of HR1 of S-2P was shown to improve stability of
the prefusion conformation (Walls, Park et al. 2020, Wrapp, Wang et al. 2020), the S protein still
suffered from instability (Fig 1C, 2B). We show that while each proline mutation increases trimer
expression, the K986P variant also reduces the interaction with the S1 head releasing the RBD to
the ‘up’ configuration based on increased ACE2 and CR3022 binding (Fig 1D) and a leftward shift
in the SEC profile (Fig. 1A). The effect is partially compensated by the introduction of the second
stabilizing mutation - V987P. We describe here two groups of substitutions that further stabilized
the S-2P prefusion trimers and reduced RBD exposure. The first group of additionally novel

stabilizing mutations was identified in the S2 HR1 region that undergoes an extensive
conformational change during fusion. Stabilizing proline and glycine mutations in loops α10α11
and α13α14, and disulfides in loop α10α11 and between the central helix and C-terminus of HR1
showed significantly increased trimer yields. It is likely that the mutations in S2 facilitate folding
of the protein during expression, by fixing loop conformations with otherwise intrinsic alpha
helical propensity, necessary for driving the fusion conformational change. This strategy greatly
improved prefusion S protein expression levels (Fig 1A). Recently, also Hsieh et al. in parallel to
our study, demonstrated the stabilizing effect of the A942P and A892P mutations (Hsieh,
Goldsmith et al. 2020). Mutations identified in the head region clustered near the SD1 subdomain.
Interestingly, two of these mutations (D614N and T572I), aside of increasing expression in the S2P variant, displayed a striking improvement of thermal stability (Fig. 1C) and exhibited very low
RBD exposure (Fig.1D).
Based on the experimental characterization of single point mutants and their subdomain
placement we selected four substitutions with low surface exposure (D614N, A892P, A942P and
V987P) to create S-closed which doesn’t contain a heterologous trimerization domain and exhibits
6.4-fold increase in expression (Fig 2A), high thermal and freeze-thaw stability (Fig. 2B, C) and
antigenicity reminiscent of a closed trimer (Fig. 2D). Both D614G and D614N variants show
increased fusogenicity and stability (Fig. 1C, Fig. S5) which may be explained by a decrease in
premature shedding of S1 (Zhang, Jackson et al. 2020). The interaction of D614 with the fusion
peptide proximal region (FPPR) may play a role in stabilizing the spike during expression, as
recently elucidated by a low pH structure (Zhou, Tsybovsky et al. 2020), in which D614 is in direct
proximity of D839 and forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of V860, suggesting aspartate
protonation. In our new structure N614 forms two interprotomeric hydrogen bonds with the

sidechain of T859 and backbone carbonyl of V860 (Fig. 3B), effectively mimicking the stabilizing
effect of the protonated aspartate residue, without the pH dependence. It remains unknown why
the D614G has a similar positive effect on stability, but perhaps the high cluster of negative charges
in the interface between S1 and S2 destabilizes the protein and the 614N or 614G mutation reduces
this repulsion. None of the stabilizing proline mutations modify the local structure of the protein,
while A892P adds new interprotomeric interactions with the neighboring hybrid sheet, composed
of both S1 and S2 strands (see Fig 3B). The stabilizing mutations and presence of K986 which
interacts with Asp427 in the RBD of the neighboring monomer and Glu748 in S2 (Fig 3B) allow
the S trimer to maintain predominantly the closed prefusion configuration.
The viral spike is mostly closed (Ke, Oton et al. 2020) and although many neutralizing
antibodies are directed against RBD, the antibodies with the highest neutralizing activity bind RBD
in the down state (Brouwer, Caniels et al. 2020, Liu, Wang et al. 2020, Robbiani, Gaebler et al.
2020). Similar to other class I fusion proteins, a closed conformation may be more reminiscent of
transmitted virus and antibodies that recognize the closed state may be more important for
protection as has been shown for HIV (Sanders and Moore 2017). Furthermore, the closed
conformation can potentially induce antibodies with higher cross reactivity since the down state
surface is more conserved. A stable closed S trimer with minimal non-exposed mutations and
without a foldon that shows a significant increase in expression levels may advance development
of novel (subunit) vaccine immunogens and further improve genetic vaccines, diagnostics or
isolation of antibodies.

mutagenesis and PCR and sequenced. The expression platform used was the Expi293F cells. The
cells were transiently transfected using ExpiFectamine (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and cultured for 6 days at 370oC and 10% CO2. The culture
supernatant was harvested and spun for 5 minutes at 300 g to remove cells and cellular debris. The

Differential scanning fluorometry (DSF)
0.2 mg of purified protein in 50 µl PBS pH 7.4 (Gibco) was mixed with 15 µl of 20 times diluted
SYPRO orange fluorescent dye (5000 x stock, Invitrogen S6650) in a 96-well optical qPCR plate.
A negative control sample containing the dye only was used for reference subtraction. The

CTF estimation by CTFFIND-4.1.18 (Rohou and Grigorieff 2015). Detailed steps of the image
processing workflow are illustrated in Figure S8. Final reconstructions were sharpened and locally
filtered in RELION post-processing (Fig. S8).
Model building and refinement
The SARS-CoV-2 S PDBID 6VXX and 6VSB structures (Walls, Park et al. 2020, Wrapp, Wang
et al. 2020) were used as starting models. PHENIX-1.18.261 (Liebschner, Afonine et al. 2019),
Coot (Emsley, Lohkamp et al. 2010) and the Namdinator webserver (Kidmose, Juhl et al. 2019)
were iteratively used to build atomic models. Geometry and statistics are given in Table S4. Final
maps were displayed using UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard, Huang et al. 2018).

Crude supernatants were diluted 300 times in AlphaLISA buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween-20
+ 0.5 mg/mL BSA). Then, 10 µL of each dilution were transferred to a 96-well plate and mixed
with 40 µL acceptor beads, donor beads and ACE2-Fc. The donor beads were conjugated to ProtA
(Cat#: AS102M, Perkin Elmer), which binds to ACE2Fc. The acceptor beads were conjugated to
an anti-His antibody (Cat#: AL128M, Perkin Elmer), which binds to the His-tag of the construct.
The mixture of the supernatant containing the expressed S protein, the ACE-2-Fc, donor beads,
and acceptor beads was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours without shaking. Subsequently,
the chemiluminescent signal was measured with an Ensight plate reader instrument (Perkin Elmer).
The average background signal attributed to mock transfected cells was subtracted from the
AlphaLISA counts. Subsequently, the whole data set was divided by signal measured for the SARS
CoV-2 S protein having the S backbone sequence signal to normalize the signal for each of the S
variants tested to the backbone.
Analytical SEC
An ultra high-performance liquid chromatography system (Vanquish, Thermo Scientific)
and µDAWN TREOS instrument (Wyatt) coupled to an Optilab µT-rEX Refractive Index Detector
(Wyatt), in combination with an in-line Nanostar DLS reader (Wyatt), was used for performing
the analytical SEC experiment. The cleared crude cell culture supernatants were applied to a SRT10C SEC-500 15 cm column, (Sepax Cat# 235500-4615) with the corresponding guard column
(Sepax) equilibrated in running buffer (150 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) at 0.35
mL/min. When analyzing supernatant samples, µMALS detectors were offline and analytical SEC
data was analyzed using Chromeleon 7.2.8.0 software package. The signal of supernatants of nontransfected cells was subtracted from the signal of supernatants of S transfected cells. When
purified proteins were analyzed using SEC-MALS, µmMALS detectors were inline and data was

analyzed using Astra 7.3 software package. For the protein component, a dn/dc (mL/g) value of
0.1850 was used and for the glycan component a value of 0.1410. Molecular weights were
calculated using the RI detector as [C] source and mass recoveries using UV as [C] source.
Cell-cell fusion assay
Quantitative cell-cell fusion assays were performed to ascertain the relative fusogenicity of the
different D614 S protein variants by using the NanoBiT complementation system (Promega).
Donor HEK293 cells were transfected with full-length S and the 11S subunit in 96-well white flat
bottom TC-treated microtest assay plates. Acceptor HEK293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates
(Corning) with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and the PEP86 subunit, or just the PEP86 subunit (‘Mock’) as
negative control. All proteins were expressed from pcDNA2004 plasmids using Trans-IT
transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 18hr after transfection, the
acceptor cells were released by 0.1% trypsin/EDTA and added to the donor cells at a 1:1 ratio for
4 hr. Luciferase complementation was measured by incubating with Nano-Glo® Live Cell Reagent
for 3 min, followed by read-out on an Ensight plate reader (PerkinElmer).
