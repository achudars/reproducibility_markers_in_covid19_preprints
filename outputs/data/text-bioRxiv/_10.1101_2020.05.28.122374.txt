Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 has created a global crisis. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is characterized by
pneumonia, respiratory distress and hypercoagulation and is often fatal1. An early sign of infection is loss of
smell, taste and chemesthesis - loss of chemical sensation2. Other neurological effects of the disease have
been described, but not explained3,4. We show that human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express the
SARS-CoV-2 receptor5,6, ACE2. ACE2 mRNA is expressed by a subset of nociceptors that express MRGPRD
mRNA suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may gain access to the nervous system through entry into neurons that
form free-nerve endings at the outer-most layers of skin and luminal organs. Therefore, sensory neurons are a
potential target for SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the nervous system.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor. The spike protein of the virus binds to ACE25,6 and can be primed by a number of proteases
(TMPRSS27 and Furin8) that are sometimes co-expressed by ACE2 positive cells9. A set of genes that are
involved in the response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated factors and receptors
(SCARFs)10, have emerged allowing for assessment of virus effects on tissues through analysis of RNA
sequencing or other high-throughput datasets.
Neurological symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients. Loss of smell (anosmia) is an early
symptom which is now explained by non-neuronal ACE2 expression within the olfactory epithelium11. It is now
appreciated that this anosmia is sometimes accompanied by loss of taste and loss of chemical sensation,
chemesthesis2. This chemesthesis includes loss of capsaicin and menthol sensitivity2, sensations that are
mediated by nociceptive sensory neurons12. Other neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 associated with
nociceptors have been described, including headache and nerve pain1,4,13. Molecular mechanisms underlying
these effects are not known.
Bulk RNA sequencing datasets support the conclusion that ACE2 is expressed in human DRG14,15, but
cellular resolution is lacking. Single cell sequencing experiments from mouse DRG show weak Ace2
expression in a subset of neurons that also express the Mrgprd and Nppb genes16. MrgprD is selectively
expressed in a nociceptor population that forms free nerve endings in the skin17, cornea and luminal organs
such as the colon18 as well as the meninges19. We tested the hypothesis that ACE2 mRNA is expressed in a
subset of human DRG neurons using tissues obtained from organ donors or vertebrectomy surgery based on
RNAscope in situ hybridization. Our findings support the conclusion that approximately a quarter of human
DRG neurons express ACE2 and that most of these neurons are nociceptors that likely form free nerve
endings in skin or other organs creating a potential entry point for the virus into the nervous system.
Results
We conducted RNAscope for ACE2 mRNA on human DRG to assess cellular expression of the SARSCoV-2 receptor. We found that ACE2 mRNA was localized in neurons, many of which expressed calcitonin
gene-related peptide gene, CALCA (Fig 1A-B), and/or the P2X purinergic ion channel type 3 receptor gene,
P2RX3. Both CALCA and P2RX3 have been widely utilized to delineate nociceptor subpopulations in rodent

Having established that the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is likely expressed by a specific subset of
human nociceptors, we sought to use existing sequencing datasets to assess expression of other SCARFs10 in
human DRG. We grouped these into receptors, proteases, replication factors, trafficking factors (shown only in
supplementary file 1 because they were all ubiquitous) and restriction factors (Table 2 and supplementary
file 1) as described in other surveys of RNA sequencing databases, none of which included DRG. While
ACE2 expression is low in these bulk RNA sequencing datasets, it was reliably detectable above 1 transcript
per million (TPM) in certain thoracic DRG samples (Supplementary file 1). Some other potential receptors for
SARS and MERS viruses were also found in human DRG and expressed in mouse DRG neurons, suggesting
they may also be neuronally expressed in human DRG. Among proteases, the two main proteases for the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein priming, TMPRSS2 and FURIN, were robustly expressed in human DRG and they
were also expressed by mouse DRG neurons (Table 2). Most other SCARFs were also expressed in human
DRG and, again, their expression in mouse DRG neurons suggests that most of them are likely to also be

Discussion
Our work highlights neuronal expression of ACE2 in a select subset of nociceptors that express
CALCA, P2RX3, MRGPRD, NPPB and SCN10A. While we cannot state with certainty the anatomical
projections of these neurons because tracing studies cannot be done in humans, the neurochemical signature
of these neurons is consistent with nociceptors that form free nerve endings in the skin17, luminal organs18 and
meninges19. Therefore, one potential consequence of this ACE2 expression could be infection of nociceptors
through the nasal passages, cornea, or upper or lower airway. To this end, we noted higher expression of
ACE2 in thoracic DRGs, and these DRGs contain nociceptors that innervate the lungs23,24, a major site for
proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus1.
It has recently been recognized that an early symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is loss of smell and
taste2,13,25. This has now been explained by SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cells in the olfactory
epithelium25. Another interesting early symptom of SARS-CoV-2 is chemesthesis2. This symptom is less
frequent than loss of smell and cannot be explained via the same mechanisms as anosmia because the
sensing of noxious chemicals in the oral cavity is mediated by nociceptors. Our data suggests that a possible
explanation of chemesthesis in COVID-19 is silencing of nerve endings by viral infection. If pulmonary
afferents are also infected by SARS-CoV-2, as our data would predict, this could have important
consequences for disease severity. Previous studies have shown that ablation of airway nociceptors increases
the severity of respiratory disease due to a loss of the trophic action of CGRP within the airway26. Widespread
silencing of nociceptors innervating the oral and nasal cavity as well as the upper and lower airway may have
important impacts on COVID-19 disease severity.
There are many currently unexplained neurological features in COVID-19 patients4,13. It is mysterious
how the virus enters the nervous system as most neurons do not express ACE210,27. Our work presents a
plausible entry point – through a select subset of ACE2 expressing nociceptors that then form synapses with
spinal and brainstem CNS neurons. While our findings can be taken as putative evidence for this idea, ACE2
expression is very low in these neurons, and we have not tested whether ACE2 protein can be detected in free
nerve endings in appropriate organs, and whether such expression can be harnessed by the virus to gain
entry. More work will be needed to make these determinations, but our results lay a foundation for

nervous system.

Materials and Methods
Tissue preparation
All human tissue procurement procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the
University of Texas at Dallas and University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Human dorsal root
ganglion (at levels T4, T5, and L5) were collected, frozen on dry ice (L5) or liquid nitrogen (T4 and T5) and
stored in a -80°C freezer. Donor and/or patient information is provided in Table 1. The human DRGs were
gradually embedded with OCT in a cryomold by adding small volumes of OCT over dry ice to avoid thawing. All
tissues were cryostat sectioned at 20 μm onto SuperFrost Plus charged slides. Sections were only briefly
thawed in order to adhere to the slide but were immediately returned to the -20°C cryostat chamber until
completion of sectioning. The slides were then immediately utilized for histology.
RNAscope in situ hybridization
RNAscope in situ hybridization multiplex version 1 was performed as instructed by Advanced Cell
Diagnostics (ACD). Slides were removed from the cryostat and immediately transferred to cold (4°C) 10%
formalin for 15 minutes. The tissues were then dehydrated in 50% ethanol (5 min), 70% ethanol (5 min) and
100% ethanol (10 min) at room temperature. The slides were air dried briefly and then boundaries were drawn
around each section using a hydrophobic pen (ImmEdge PAP pen; Vector Labs). When hydrophobic
boundaries had dried, protease IV reagent was added to each section until fully covered and incubated for 5
minutes at room temperature. The protease IV incubation period was optimized as recommended by ACD for
the specific lot of Protease IV reagent. Slides were washed briefly in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4) at room temperature. Each slide was then placed in a prewarmed humidity control tray (ACD) containing
dampened filter paper and a mixture of Channel 1, Channel 2, and Channel 3 probes (50:1:1 dilution, as
directed by ACD due to stock concentrations) was pipetted onto each section until fully submerged. This was
performed one slide at a time to avoid liquid evaporation and section drying. The humidity control tray was
placed in a HybEZ oven (ACD) for 2 hours at 40°C. A table of all probes used is shown in Table 3. Following
probe incubation, the slides were washed two times in 1X RNAscope wash buffer and returned to the oven for

30 minutes after submersion in AMP-1 reagent. Washes and amplification were repeated using AMP-2, AMP-3
and AMP-4 reagents with a 15-min, 30-min, and 15-min incubation period, respectively. AMP-4 ALT C
(Channel 1 = Atto 550, Channel 2 = Atto 647, Channel 3 = Alexa 488) was used for all experiments. Slides
were then washed two times in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB, pH7.4). Human slides were incubated in DAPI
(ACD) for 1 min before being washed, air dried, and cover-slipped with Prolong Gold Antifade mounting
medium.

Tissue Quality Check
All tissues were checked for RNA quality by using a positive control probe cocktail (ACD) which
contains probes for high, medium and low-expressing mRNAs that are present in all cells (ubiquitin C >
Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B > DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1). All tissues showed
signal for all 3 positive control probes (Supplementary Fig 1). A negative control probe against the bacterial
DapB gene (ACD) was used to check for non-specific/background label.
Image Analysis
DRG sections were imaged on an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope at 20X or 40X magnification.
For the CALCA/P2RX3/ACE2 and SCN10A/ACE2 experiments, 3-4 20X images were acquired of each human
DRG section, and 3-4 sections were imaged per human donor. For the MRGPRD/NPPB/ACE2 experiments, 8
40x images were acquired of each human DRG section, and 3-4 sections were imaged per donor. The
sections imaged were chosen at random, but preference was given to sections that did not have any sectioning
artifact, or sections that encompassed the entire DRG bulb. The acquisition parameters were set based on

guidelines for the FV3000 provided by Olympus. In particular, the gain was kept at the default setting 1, HV ≤
600, offset = 4 (based on HI-LO settings; doesn’t change between experiments), and laser power ≤ 10% (but
generally the laser power was ≤ 5% for our experiments). The raw image files were brightened and contrasted
in Olympus CellSens software (v1.18), and then analyzed manually one cell at a time for expression of each
gene target. Cell diameters were measured using the polyline tool. Total neuron counts for human samples
were acquired by counting all of the probe-labeled neurons and all neurons that were clearly outlined by DAPI
(satellite cell) signal and contained lipofuscin in the overlay image.
Large globular structures and/or signal that auto-fluoresced in all 3 channels (488, 550, and 647;
appears white in the overlay images) was considered to be background lipofuscin and was not analyzed. Aside
from adjusting brightness/contrast, we performed no digital image processing to subtract background. We
attempted to optimize automated imaging analysis tools for our purposes, but these tools were designed to
work with fresh, low background rodent tissues, not human samples taken from older organ donors. As such,
we chose to implement a manual approach in our imaging analysis in which we used our own judgement of the
negative/positive controls and target images to assess mRNA label. Images were not analyzed in a blinded
fashion.
RNA Sequencing Sources
We used previously published RNA sequencing datasets to generate Table 2 and Supplementary file
1.

Human DRG sequencing data was described previously14,15 and mouse single cell sequencing data from

DRG was described previously16,28.
Data Analysis
Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism version 7.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA
USA). Given that the percentage of ACE2-expressing neurons was assessed in each experiment, we averaged
these numbers for each donor to generate the final data values. A total of 2,224 neurons were analyzed
between all three donors and all three experiments. A relative frequency distribution histogram with a fitted
Gaussian distribution curve was generated using the diameters of all ACE2-positive neurons detected in all
experiments.

Supplemental Figure 1. mRNA quality check for each human donor DRG. All tissues were chec
ecked for
mRNA quality by using a positive control probe cocktail (ACD) which contains probes for high, mediu
dium and
low-expressing mRNAs that are present in all cells (ubiquitin C > Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B > DNAdirected RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1). All DRGs showed signal for all 3 positive control probes indicating
ind
that the mRNA quality is excellent and that low-expressing transcripts such as ACE2 should be able
ble to be
detected. 20x scale bar = 50 μm.
