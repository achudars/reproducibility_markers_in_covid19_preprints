Abstract

22

Zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) infections, like those responsible for the current SARS-CoV-2

23

epidemic, cause grave international public health concern. In infected cells, the CoV RNA-

24

synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are

25

transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). While double-membrane vesicles

26

(DMVs) appear to be a pan-coronavirus RO element, studies to date describe an assortment

27

of additional coronavirus-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains

28

unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed

29

2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same

30

membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs)

31

previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites

32

of replication. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative

33

EM autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells

34

infected with the beta-CoVs MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and the gamma-CoV infectious

35

bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-

36

induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish

37

DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in coronavirus

38

infection.

Introduction

40

The RNA synthesis of all positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses of eukaryotes occurs in the

41

cytoplasm of the host cell, in conjunction with modified endomembranes that are often

42

referred to as viral replication organelles (ROs) [1-3]. ROs are generally believed to provide

43

tailored platforms that facilitate viral replication by concentrating relevant factors and

44

spatially organizing distinct steps in the viral cycle. Additionally, ROs may contribute to the

45

evasion of cellular innate immune defences that detect viral RNA (vRNA) [4].

46

Two main RO prototypes have been discriminated: small spherular invaginations and large(r)

47

vesiculotubular clusters consisting of single- and/or double-membrane structures, to which

48

viral replicative proteins and specific host factors can be recruited. The formation of

49

invaginations can occur at the membrane of various organelles, including endoplasmic

50

reticulum (ER), endolysosomes, and mitochondria [5-9]. The lumen of the resulting micro-

51

compartment is connected with the cytosol by a ‘neck-like’ channel that can mediate

52

transport of metabolites and export of newly made positive-sense vRNAs to the cytosol for

53

translation and packaging. In general, the morphological and functional characterization of

54

ROs of the second, vesiculotubular type is lagging behind. Such structures, which always

55

include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), commonly derive from membranes of the

56

secretory pathway and have been found in cells infected with e.g. picornaviruses [10, 11],

57

noroviruses [12], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [13], and different nidoviruses, including the

58

arterivirus and coronavirus (CoV) families [14-18].

59

The first electron tomography analysis of a coronavirus-induced RO, that of the severe acute

60

respiratory syndrome-CoV [15] (SARS-CoV, genus Betacoronavirus), raised a variety of

61

functional considerations. Intriguingly, while double-stranded (ds) RNA, a presumed

62

intermediate and marker for vRNA synthesis [19], was found inside the virus-induced DMVs,

63

these lacked visible connections to the cytosol [15]. Viral RNA synthesis inside fully-closed

64

DMVs would pose the conundrum of how metabolites and newly made genomic and

65

subgenomic mRNAs could be transported across the double-lipid bilayer. Nevertheless,

66

experimental evidence for the location of vRNA synthesis within the RO was lacking.

67

Importantly, dsRNA is not a bona fide marker for vRNA synthesis as it may no longer be

68

associated with the active enzymatic replication complexes in which most of the 16 viral non-

69

structural proteins (nsps) come together. Thus, the possibility of vRNA synthesis taking place

70

in alternative locations, like the convoluted membranes (CM) that are also prominent

71

elements of the beta-CoV RO [15, 20, 21], was entirely possible and started to attract

72

attention. Notably, DMVs can be also formed in the absence of vRNA synthesis by

73

expression of key transmembrane nsps [22-26]. Moreover, several studies suggested a lack of

74

direct correlation between the number of DMVs and the level of CoV replication in the

75

infected cell [27, 28].

76

The interpretation of the CoV RO structure and function was further compounded by the

77

discovery of different RO elements, never reported in beta-CoV infections, that set apart

78

other distantly-related CoVs genera. In particular, zippered ER (instead of CM) and double-

79

membrane spherules (DMSs) were detected for the avian gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis

80

virus (IBV) [29] and, recently, for the porcine deltacoronavirus [30]. The size and topology

81

of these DMSs, invaginations in the zippered ER, were remarkably similar to those of the

82

spherular invaginations induced by other +RNA viruses and, consequently, DMSs were

83

suggested to be sites of vRNA synthesis [29, 31].

84

In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and function of the RO induced

85

by members of different CoV genera, with a special focus on beta-CoVs like SARS-CoV and

86

MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) [32, 33]. While the SARS-CoV

87

outbreak was contained in 2003, MERS-CoV continues to pose a serious zoonotic threat to

88

human health since 2012 (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Very recently, a

89

previously unknown beta-CoV (2019-nCoV, recently renamed into SARS-CoV-2) has

90

emerged in China [34] and is causing major public health concerns worldwide. The 2019-

91

nCoV genome sequence is 79.5% identical to that of SARS-CoV [35], yielding 86% overall

92

nsp sequence identity and suggesting strong functional similarities in the replication of both

93

viruses.

94

Our observations on the 3D morphology of the MERS-CoV RO were compared with data

95

from cells infected with other alpha-, beta-, and gamma-CoVs. This comparative analysis

96

made it clear that all these CoV induce essentially the same membrane structures, including

97

DMSs. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized vRNA was used to determine the site(s) of

98

vRNA synthesis within the CoV RO. To this end, we used a radiolabeled nucleoside

99

([3H]uridine) and applied the classic and highly-sensitive technique of EM autoradiography

100

[36, 37] in combination with advanced quantitative analysis tools. This approach revealed

101

that DMVs are the primary site of CoV RNA synthesis, with neither DMSs nor CM or

102

zippered ER being labelled to a significant extent. Our study provides a comprehensive and

103

unifying model of the CoV RO structure. It also returns DMVs to centre stage as the hub of

104

CoV RNA synthesis and a potential antiviral drug target.

Results

106

MERS-CoV induces a membrane network of modified membranes that contains

107

double-membrane spherules (DMSs)

108

We first set out to analyse the ultrastructure of MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells under sample

109

preparation conditions favourable for autoradiography (see Materials and Methods) (Fig 1, S1

110

Video). Strikingly, in addition to the DMVs and CM that are well established hallmarks of

111

beta-CoV infections, the presence of small spherules, occasionally in large numbers, was

112

readily apparent (Fig 1A and 1B). These spherules were notably similar to the DMSs

113

previously described for the gamma-CoV IBV [29]. Their remarkably regular size of ~80 nm

114

(average diameter 79.8 ± 2.5 nm, n=58), a delimiting double membrane and their electron-

115

dense content, made these spherules clearly distinct from other structures, including progeny

116

virions, which had comparable diameter (Fig 1C and 1D). The double-membrane spherules

117

(DMSs) generated during IBV infection were previously described as invaginations of the

118

zippered ER that remain open to the cytosol [29]. In MERS-CoV-infected cells, the DMSs

119

were connected to the CM from which they seemed to derive (Fig 1E). Clear openings to the

120

cytosol could not be detected for the large majority (~80%, n=54) of the fully reconstructed

121

DMSs, which suggests that the original invagination may eventually transform into a sealed

122

compartment. This type of apparently closed DMSs were also present, though in a lower

123

proportion (~50%, n=39), in IBV-infected cell samples processed in an identical manner (S1

124

Fig).

diameter, 80 nm), while the median diameter of the DMVs is 247 nm. (E) Models and tomographic

139

140

In open DMSs, both the inner and outer membranes (dark blue and orange, respectively) are

141

continuous with CM. Two ~8-nm apart slices through the reconstruction are shown. For closed DMSs

142

only the outer membrane is connected to CM, while the inner membrane seems to define a closed

143

compartment. (F) Gallery of tomographic slices highlighting membrane connections between different

144

elements of the MERS-CoV RO, and of these with the ER. These include CM-ER (black arrowheads),

145

DMV-ER (white arrowheads), CM-DMV (dark grey arrowheads), and CM-DMS (light grey

146

arrowhead) connections. Scale bars, 250 nm (A, B), and 100 nm (C -F).

147
148

Our data suggests a functional analogy between zippered ER and CM, as both structures

149

appear to provide membranes for DMS formation. In fact, both bore a striking resemblance

150

under the same sample preparation conditions: MERS-CoV-induced CM noticeably consisted

151

of zippered smooth membranes that were connected to the rough ER and branched and

152

curved in intricate arrangements. Although unbranched zippered ER was most common in

153

IBV-infected cells, as described [29], we also detected zippered ER morphologically closer to

154

CM (S1B Fig). These observations argue for zippered ER and CM representing alternative

155

configurations of essentially the same virus-induced RO element.

156

The 3D architecture of MERS-CoV-induced RO aligned with previous observations for other

157

CoV [15, 29]. No clear openings connecting the interior of the DMVs and the cytosol could

158

be detected. All three types of MERS-CoV-induced membrane modifications appeared to be

159

interconnected, either directly or indirectly through the ER. While DMSs were connected to

160

CM, and CM to ER, ER membranes were often continuous with DMVs (Fig 1F, arrowheads).

161

Therefore, like other CoVs, MERS-CoV infection appears to induce a network of largely

162

interconnected modified ER membranes that, as a whole, can be considered the CoV RO.

163
164

Diverse coronaviruses across different genera induce the same RO elements

165

Intriguingly, DMSs had never been reported for beta-CoV infections in previous

166

characterizations, including ours, that used different sample preparation conditions and/or

167

different cell lines. This prompted us to revisit those samples for a closer examination. A

168

targeted search for DMSs in MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells [21] and SARS-CoV-infected

169

Vero E6 cells [15] readily revealed similar DMSs, embedded and somewhat concealed in CM

170

with a denser and more tangled appearance that can be attributed to sample preparation

171

differences (S2 Fig, compare to Fig 1 and Fig 2A). To further explore whether these

172

observations could be extended to other coronaviruses, we analysed a third beta-CoV (murine

173

hepatitis virus, MHV) as well as a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus (human

174

coronavirus 229E, HCoV-229E). Both in MHV-infected 17Cl1 cells and in HCoV-229E-

175

infected Huh7 cells, virus-induced DMSs could be detected, with their characteristic size,

176

appearance, and spatial association with CM (Fig 2B and 2C). These results demonstrate that

177

virus-induced DMSs are not exclusive to some CoV genera or

184
185

Coronavirus RNA synthesis is confined to RO regions

186

To investigate the subcellular localization of vRNA synthesis in cells infected with different

187

CoVs, we metabolically labelled newly-synthesized vRNA by arresting cellular transcription

188

with actinomycin D and using a radiolabelled nucleoside precursor ([5-3H]uridine) for

189

subsequent detection by EM autoradiography [36, 37] (see S1 Appendix). A key advantage of

190

this approach over the use of modified precursors (e.g. Br-uridine), is that detection of the

191

label does not rely on immunolabelling. This makes autoradiography compatible with high-

192

contrast EM sample preparation protocols that provide excellent morphology at the price of

193

epitope integrity. Moreover, as the signal derives from radioactive disintegrations, EM

194

autoradiography is a very sensitive technique, which in principle should allow for short

195

labelling pulses, essential to minimize the chance of migration of labelled vRNA products

196

from their site of synthesis. Nevertheless, the pulse should be long enough to enable the

197

internalization of the tritiated uridine, its conversion into 3H-UTP in the cell, and its

198

incorporation into vRNA. In order to explore the practical limits of the approach, we tested

199

different labelling pulses in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV, measuring the amount of

200

radioactive label incorporated into RNA (Fig 3A). While minimal labelling occurred within

201

the first 10 minutes, a sharp increase in signal was observed between 10 and 20 min after

202

label administration. Consequently, only samples labelled for 20 min or longer were prepared

203

and processed for EM autoradiography analysis.

regions) and these cells lack ROs and virions.

223

Abundant autoradiography signal was detected by EM in SARS-CoV-infected cells pulse-

224

labelled for 20 min (Fig 3B), accumulating in the regions that contained virus-induced

225

membrane modifications, which aligned with the idea that these structures are the primary

226

platforms for vRNA synthesis. This largely accepted notion, however, does not formally

227

exclude the possibility vRNA synthesis could also be associated with other cellular

228

membranes, albeit to a lower extent. Such an association with morphologically intact

229

membranes could be important, for example, in the first stages of infection, when the levels

230

of the viral membrane-remodelling proteins are still low.

231

Importantly, establishing the association of autoradiography signal with specific subcellular

232

structures requires a detailed quantitative analysis, as the autoradiography signal can spread

233

up to a few hundred nanometers from the original radioactive source (see S1 Appendix). This

234

type of analysis was used to compare CoV- and mock-infected cells labelled for different

235

periods of time. To this end, we analysed the autoradiography signal present in hundreds of

236

regions that were randomly picked from large EM mosaic images [38] and calculated

237

labelling densities and relative labelling indexes (RLI) per compartment [39] (see Materials

238

and Methods, S1 Table). The results for SARS-CoV did not show association of vRNA

239

synthesis with any subcellular structure other than ROs (Fig 3C). In infected cells labelled for

240

a short period of time (20 min), the RO labelling densities were one order of magnitude

241

higher than for any other subcellular structure. Even though the dispersion of signal around

242

the radioactive source would inevitably cause ‘signal leakage’ from these active ROs to

243

neighbouring organelles like the ER, none of those alternative locations showed an RLI

244

significantly higher than 1 (RLI≤1 indicates unspecific labelling), and their labelling densities

245

were comparable to those in the control mock-infected cells. An increase in labelling

246

densities in some subcellular regions was observed in infected cells when the labelling time

247

was extended to 60 min. This could be explained by signal leakage in combination with the

248

migration of vRNA from its site of synthesis, possibly towards the site of virus assembly on

249

membranes of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [40-42]. Indeed, virion-

250

containing regions showed the sharpest increase in labelling density when extending the

251

labelling time. Similar results followed from the analysis of MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells

252

(Fig 3D), although no clear signs of RNA migration were observed in this case. Taken

253

together, these results suggest that CoV RNA synthesis is restricted to the RO-containing

254

regions of the infected cell.

256

DMVs are the primary site of coronaviral RNA synthesis

257

Our next goal was to determine which elements of the coronaviral RO (DMVs, CM/zippered

258

ER and/or DMSs) are directly involved in vRNA synthesis. A first answer to this question

259

became readily apparent as regions containing DMVs, but not either of the other RO

260

structural elements, were densely labelled in cells infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or

261

IBV (Fig 4A and 4B, Fig 3B, and S3 Fig, respectively). Interestingly, not all the DMV

262

clusters in a sample, and sometimes even within a cell, appeared equally densely labelled,

263

which suggests that the levels of vRNA synthesis in DMVs are variable and could change in

264

time. The active role of DMVs in vRNA synthesis in MERS-CoV-infected cells was further

265

corroborated by a detailed analysis of the distribution of autoradiography signal around

266

isolated DMVs (Fig 4C). In case of a random distribution (i.e. if the DMVs were not a true

267

radioactive source), the number of autoradiography grains around the DMVs would simply

268

increase with the distance, as the perimeter of the screened area also increases and with it the

269

chances of detecting background signal. The signal around DMVs was clearly not random,

270

showing maximum levels in the proximity of these structures (Fig 4C). Moreover, the

271

distribution normalized by the distance made apparent a maximum around the average radius

272

of the DMVs analysed (133 ± 28 nm, n=36) (Fig 4E), aligning with the idea that vRNA

273

synthesis takes place in membrane-bound enzymatic complexes.

Next, we specifically investigated the possible involvement in vRNA synthesis of CM and/or

287

DMSs, which always were present in membrane-modification clusters that also contained

288

DMVs. A close inspection of CM showed that these structures were mainly devoid of signal

289

and that the occasional silver grains present primarily appeared in the periphery of CM,

290

therefore likely stemming from surrounding labelled DMVs (Fig 5A and B). Similar

291

observations were made for DMSs (Fig 5C-E): most of them (85%) lacked signal and the rest

292

was close to abundantly labelled DMVs. Furthermore, no signs of DMSs acting as a signal

293

source were apparent in the distribution of signal around them, which resembled that of a

294

random pattern (Fig 5E, compare with Fig 4D).

308
309

To explore whether these observations could be extended to distantly-related CoVs, we

310

expanded this type of analysis to the gamma-CoV IBV. IBV-induced DMSs are particularly

311

abundant and a large proportion of them have an open configuration, which contributed to the

312

hypothesis that these open DMSs could be engaged in vRNA synthesis [29, 31]. However, no

313

evidence supporting this hypothesis could be derived from our detailed analysis of the

314

autoradiography signal in IBV-infected cells, which essentially produced the same results as

315

for MERS-CoV (S3 Fig). Taken together, our observations clearly point at coronaviral DMVs

316

as the active site of vRNA synthesis and seem to indicate that neither CM/zippered ER nor

317

DMSs are effectively involved in this process, at least not to a significant level above the

318

detection limits of our method.

319
320

DMSs do not label for viral envelope proteins or dsRNA

321

If CM and DMSs are not involved in vRNA synthesis, what is the role (if any) of these RO

322

structural elements in coronavirus replication? To investigate this, we analysed the

323

subcellular location of different viral markers in MERS-CoV-infected cells by

324

immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) (Fig 6).

335
336

Coronavirus-induced DMSs, with their electron-dense content and their remarkably regular

337

size, are particularly intriguing structures. Revealing DMSs in IEM samples, however, was

338

challenging and, in our hands, required a modified protocol for the preparation of thawed

339

cryo-sections [43] that, unfortunately, failed to make DMVs apparent (see Materials and

340

Methods). Given the similar size of DMSs and virus particles, we first considered the

341

possibility that the DMSs would represent some kind of non-productive virus assembly event

342

on the CM. While new CoV particles typically assemble in the ERGIC [40-42, 44, 45], virus

343

budding from ER membranes, from which CM originate, can also occur [40, 46, 47], and we

344

regularly observed it in MERS-CoV- and IBV-infected cells (e.g. S1 Fig).To investigate this

345

possibility, we used antibodies against several of the structural proteins, namely, the

346

nucleocapsid protein N, the envelope membrane protein M and the spike protein S. As

347

expected, all of them were detected in newly-formed MERS-CoV particles present in

348

budding vesicles (Fig 6A-C).The M and S proteins also localized to the Golgi complex,

349

aligning with previous observations for other CoVs [20, 44, 48, 49]. The MERS-CoV N

350

protein was found in regions with CM and DMSs, though the distribution of signal was

351

homogenous and DMSs were not particularly densely labelled (Fig 6D). The presence of the

352

N protein in the viral RO has also been shown for MHV [20] and suggested by a number of

353

colocalisation studies [42, 50-53], and may be related to a possible role in vRNA synthesis of

354

this multifunctional protein [54]. Importantly, neither DMSs nor CMs labelled for the M

355

protein, the most abundant viral envelope protein and the presumed orchestrator of virion

356

assembly, or the S protein (Fig 6E and 6F).

357

Previously, the CM induced by SARS-CoV and MHV were shown by IEM to accumulate

358

viral nsps, while dsRNA signal was primarily found inside the DMVs [15, 20]. Similarly,

359

nsp3 mapped to the CM induced in MERS-CoV infection, but also to the DMSs to a

360

comparable extent (Fig 6G). Our attempts to combine dsRNA antibody labelling with thawed

361

cryo-sections were unsuccessful, which made us resort to HPF-FS samples. In these,

362

however, while DMVs were easily detected, the morphology of CM and DMSs was less

363

clearly defined. Nevertheless, dsRNA signal was clearly associated with DMVs, while the

364

dark membranous regions between DMVs that we interpreted as CM and DMSs clusters

365

appeared devoid of signal (Fig 6H and 6I).

366

In summary, for the antibodies tested (recognizing N, M, S, nsp3, and dsRNA), the labelling

367

pattern in MERS-CoV-induced DMSs closely resembled that of the CM, from which they

368

seem to derive. The absence of labelling for key proteins in virus assembly, like the M and S

369

proteins, strongly suggest that DMSs do not represent (spurious) virus assembly events.

Discussion

371

The comprehensive analysis presented here demonstrates that viruses across different CoV

372

genera induce essentially the same type of membrane structures. After somewhat disparate

373

observations [15, 20, 21, 29, 30, 47], the unifying model that emerges from our study is that

374

of a coronavirus RO comprising three basic types of double-membrane structural elements:

375

(i) DMVs, (ii) CM or zippered ER, which would represent branched or un-branched

376

configurations of paired-ER membranes, and (iii) small DMSs that appear to arise from CM

377

or zippered ER. These structural elements are largely interconnected and connected to the

378

ER, together forming the reticulovesicular network that is typical of the coronaviral RO,

379

including in all likelihood the RO of the 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2), a close relative of

380

SARS-CoV.

381

Our results clearly establish DMVs as the primary –if not only- site of vRNA synthesis

382

within the coronaviral RO. This point has been subject to quite some speculation, due in part

383

to the limited experimental data directly addressing this question. An early study using Br-

384

UTP and IEM to detect newly-synthesized vRNA mapped signal in DMV regions of MHV-

385

infected cells [14], but the poor preservation of IEM samples did not allow the recognition of

386

CM and DMSs, typically present in these regions. Later, a light microscopy study using 5-

387

ethynil uridine labelling and click chemistry suggested that vRNA synthesis could take place,

388

at least partially, in a different location than the DMVs [55]. Alternative interpretations of

389

those results, like migration of vRNA from the DMVs during the relatively long labelling

390

times used (60 min) appear now more plausible. Several other studies further contributed to

391

undermine the idea of DMVs being the sites of vRNA synthesis by showing that higher

392

numbers of DMVs did not necessarily translate into larger amounts of vRNA or provide a

393

competitive advantage [27, 28]. It should be noted, however, that the number of DMVs may

394

not necessarily correlate with the number of active replication complexes that they contain at

395

a given time, something that is also suggested by our observed variations in the level of

396

vRNA synthesis signal among DMVs.

397

While the finding of open DMSs, similar to the invaginations that many +RNA viruses use as

398

replication sites, made them attractive candidate sites for vRNA synthesis [29, 31], we could

399

not detect vRNA synthesis associated with them, nor with CM or any other subcellular

400

structure using a highly-sensitive technique like autoradiography. Although some level of

401

vRNA synthesis in any of these structures cannot be completely discarded, our results suggest

402

that, if present, this would only be marginal compared to the abundant synthesis clearly

403

associated with DMVs. However, given the prevalence of DMSs and CM across different

404

CoV genera, it is tempting to speculate that these structures must play a role in virus

405

replication. It has been proposed that CM could be a form of cubic membranes [25, 56],

406

which are membrane aggregates resulting from ER protein overexpression [57]. CM, which

407

abundantly label for viral nsps [15, 20] and proliferate late in infection [15, 20, 21], could

408

thus be a by-product of viral protein overexpression. Although DMSs seem to be derived

409

from CM, it is harder to imagine that these highly-regular structures would also lack a

410

specific function. However, their possible role remains elusive. The idea that DMSs could be

411

DMV precursors seems unlikely, considering that no intermediate structures between the two

412

were found, and that DMV formation precedes the appearance of CM, from which DMSs

413

seem to originate. A suggestive possibility was that DMSs represented non-productive virus

414

assembly events, but the lack of DMS labelling for key structural proteins seems to rule out

415

this option. In fact, no differences were apparent in the labelling patterns of CM and DMSs

416

for the viral markers tested. While their distinct morphology likely implies that DMSs contain

417

specific host or viral proteins, these factors, which may give important clues about the DMS

418

role, remain to be identified.

419

Our results add to studies that, in the last years and after much speculation, have started to

420

provide experimental evidence that the DMVs induced by +RNA viruses are active sites of

421

vRNA synthesis [11, 58-60]. However, it is not clear that DMVs always play the primary role

422

in virus replication that we demonstrate here for CoV. For picornaviruses, for example, virus-

423

induced single membrane structures, which are DMV precursors and also active sites of

424

vRNA synthesis, could well be more relevant as they predominate at the peak of vRNA

425

replication [10, 11, 60]. By clearly pointing to DMVs as the key sites for CoV replication, our

426

results also bring back to centre stage some of the challenges that CoV-induced DMVs pose,

427

which extend to the distantly-related arterivirus family, and probably also to other members

428

of the order Nidovirales. In contrast with the DMVs induced by other +RNA viruses [10, 11,

429

13, 60], the DMVs in nidovirus-infected cells appear to lack membrane openings that would

430

connect their inner compartment with the cytosol to allow import of precursors and export of

431

genomic and subgenomic viral mRNAs [15, 16, 29]. This topological conundrum, however,

432

starts with the assumption that vRNA synthesis takes place inside the DMVs, yet the

433

evidence so far is insufficient to ascertain this point. Shielding of vRNA inside DMVs

434

arguably provides the most straightforward explanation for the observation that intact

435

membranes protected vRNA from nuclease treatment [61]. However, protection of vRNA

436

could also be achieved in the outer DMV membrane through protein complexes that would

437

rely on membranes for assembly/stability.

438

While a definitive answer to this issue is still missing, our results allow narrowing down the

439

possible scenarios. If the DMVs are closed structures lacking an import/export mechanism,

440

vRNA synthesis on the outer DMV membrane appears as a necessity to provide vRNA for

441

translation and encapsidation. Then, vRNA synthesis inside the DMVs would also be

442

required to explain the observed accumulation of (presumably viral) dsRNA. Although this is

443

not at all an attractive possibility, as vRNA synthesis inside the DMVs and even DMV

444

formation would appear spurious, it cannot be completely discarded at this stage. The most

445

appealing scenario is that in which vRNA synthesis only takes place inside the DMVs. This

446

would provide the compartmentalization of vRNA synthesis that may be most beneficial for

447

viral replication, although it would require the existence of a yet unidentified import/export

448

mechanism. Notice that a transport mechanism would also be needed in the third possible

449

scenario, i.e. if vRNA synthesis occurs only on the outer DMV membrane, to account for the

450

accumulation of dsRNA inside the DMVs that could then perhaps serve to hide excess vRNA

451

from detection by innate immune sensors [62].

452

Despite the lack of clear openings in the membranes of CoV-induced DMVs, a mechanism

453

allowing exchange of material with the cytosol is conceivable. The openings of DMV may be

454

extremely short-lived, and therefore they may have eluded detection by EM. This may

455

become apparent in the future, if mutant CoV inducing DMVs with slower dynamics are

456

found. An appealing alternative is the existence of molecular pores that may well be

457

undetectable in conventional EM samples. Precedents of molecular complexes bridging

458

double membranes include the large nuclear pore complex, but also small transporters

459

through the mitochondrial or chloroplast membranes. Visualizing such a putative small

460

molecular pore on DMVs is a formidable challenge that would likely require the use of cryo-

461

EM to preserve macromolecular components. Emerging techniques like in situ

462

cryotomography, which allows the visualization of structures in their cellular context at

463

macromolecular resolution, may be key to realize this next step and to understand how CoVs

464

exploit the complex architecture of DMVs.

Cells, viruses and infections

Huh7 cells (kindly provided by Ralf Bartenschlager, Heidelberg University) were grown in

468

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Lonza) supplemented with 8% (v/v) fetal

469

calf serum (FCS; Bodinco), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA Laboratories) and nonessential amino

470

acids (PAA Laboratories). Vero cells (ECACC 84113001) were cultured in Eagle’s minimal

471

essential medium (EMEM; Lonza) with 8% FCS and 2 mM L-glutamine. Vero E6 cells

472

(ATCC CRL-1586) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 8% FCS. Mouse 17 clone

473

1 (17Cl1) cells (gift from Stuart Siddell, University of Bristol) were grown in DMEM

474

supplemented with 8% FCS and 8% (v/v) tryptose phosphate broth (Life technologies).

475

Penicillin and streptomycin (90 IU/ml, PAA Laboratories) were added to all media.

476

The coronaviruses used in this study include MERS-CoV (strain EMC/2012, [32, 33], SARS-

477

CoV (strain Frankfurt-1, [63]), MHV (ATCC VR-674), human coronavirus strain 229E

478

(HCoV-229E, [64]), and IBV (strain Beau-R, [65]). All the infection experiments were

479

carried out at 37oC, except for HCoV-229E infections which were performed at 33oC. Cells

480

were infected at high multiplicity of infection (MOI 5-10), with the exception of IBV

481

(MOI<1). In this case, the time post-infection chosen (~16 hpi) allowed for two cycles of

482

IBV replication to maximize the number of infected cells. For MHV infections, 1 µM HR2

483

peptide was added to the cell medium to prevent syncytia formation [66]. Control mock-

484

infected cells were included in all the experiments. Infections were routinely assessed by

485

immunofluorescence assays on parallel samples, essentially processed as previously

486

described [51]. All work with live SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was performed inside

487

biosafety cabinets in the biosafety level 3 facility at Leiden University Medical Center.

Antibodies

490

For IEM of MERS-CoV-infected cells, the antibodies used included a previously described

491

rabbit antiserum that recognizes SARS-CoV nsp3 protein and cross reacts with MERS-CoV

492

nsp3 [21, 67], a polyclonal rabbit antibody generated against full-length MERS-CoV N

493

protein (Sino Biological), and a mouse monoclonal antibody (J2) specific for dsRNA [68],

494

purchased from Scicons. A MERS-CoV M-specific rabbit antiserum was ordered from

495

Genscript and produced using as antigen a synthetic peptide representing the C-terminal 24

496

residues of the protein (CRYKAGNYRSPPITADIELALLRA). The specificity of the

497

antiserum was verified by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy using

498

samples from MERS-CoV-infected Vero or Huh7 cells, as described previously [21], whilst

499

using pre-immune serum and mock-infected cell lysates as negative controls. The human

500

monoclonal antibody used against MERS-CoV spike protein was kindly provided by Dr.

501

Berend Jan Bosch (Utrecht University) and has been described elsewhere as 1.6f9 [69].

Metabolic labelling and label incorporation measurements

504

To label newly-synthesized RNA, CoV-infected cells and control mock-infected cells were

505

incubated for different periods of time with tritiated uridine ([5-3H]uridine, 1 mCi/ml, Perkin

506

Elmer), which was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with double-concentrated medium. Cellular

507

transcription was blocked by providing the cells with 10 µg/ml actinomycin D both during

508

labelling and in a pre-incubation step of 1-2 h, depending on the specific set of samples.

509

Directly after labelling, the cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline

510

(PBS) and immediately fixed for EM autoradiography. A parallel set of samples was included

511

in every experiment for label incorporation measurements. These cells were lysed using

512

TriPure Isolation Reagend (Roche) and the RNA isolated following the manufacturer’s

scintillation counting.

516

Sample preparation for electron microscopy

517

For ultrastructural analysis, autoradiography and tomography, EM samples of CoV-infected

518

cells were prepared by chemical fixation. Chemical fixation was chosen over the alternative

519

of high-pressure freezing (HPF) and freeze-substitution (FS) to increase the yield of cells per

520

EM grid and thus facilitate the autoradiography quantitative analysis, as it was observed that

521

infected cells were easily washed away and lost during FS. At the desired times post

522

infection, the cells were fixed for 30 min with 1.5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde (GA) in 0.1 M

523

cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Cells infected with SARS- or MERS-CoV were further

524

maintained in the fixative overnight. After fixation, the samples were washed with 0.1 M

525

cacodylate buffer either once or, in samples destined to autoradiography, 3 times (5 min each)

526

to favour the elimination of unincorporated [5-3H]uridine. Next, the samples were treated

527

with 1% (wt/vol) OsO4 at 4oC for 1 hour, washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and Milli-Q

EM autoradiography samples

537

To facilitate the different steps in the preparation of autoradiography samples, EM grids with

538

ultrathin cell sections (50 nm thick) were first attached to glass slides by gently pressing the

539

grid edge against a line of double-sided sticky tape applied along the length of the slide.

540

Each glass slide included a grid for every condition tested within a given experiment, to be

541

later developed simultaneously. A thin layer of carbon was then evaporated onto the grids to

542

prevent direct contact between the stained section and the photographic emulsion that could

543

lead to undesired chemical changes in the emulsion. Samples were transferred to a dark room,

544

and a thin layer of nuclear emulsion ILFORD L4 was placed on top of the grids with the help

545

of a wire loop [36]. Samples were maintained in the dark in a cold room for several weeks

546

until development, which was performed as described in [70]. The progress in the exposure

547

of the nuclear emulsion to radioactive disintegrations was evaluated regularly by EM until the

548

number of autoradiography grains was sufficient for analysis (~6 weeks for SARS-CoV-

549

infected cells, ~21 weeks for MERS-CoV-infected cells, and ~12-13 weeks for IBV-infected

550

cells).

551

IEM

552

Several types of MERS-CoV-infected cell samples were prepared for IEM. The labelling of

553

viral proteins was performed on thawed cryo-sections, which are optimal for epitope

554

preservation. To this end, at 12 hpi, infected and mock-infected cells were first chemically

555

fixed for 1 hour at room temperature with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.25%

556

(vol/vol) GA in 0.1 M PHEM buffer (60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM

557

MgCl2, ph 6.9), briefly washed with 0.1 M PHEM buffer and stored at 4oC in 3% (wt/vol)

558

PFA in 0.1 M PHEM buffer until transfer from the biosafety level 3 facility for further

559

processing. To prepare EM samples, the cells were first pelleted and embedded in 12%

560

(wt/vol) gelatin. Cubes of approximately 1 mm3 in size were cut from these pellets, infiltrated

561

with 2.3 M sucrose for cryo-protection, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned by cryo-

562

ultramicrotomy. Thawed cryo-sections (70 nm thick) deposited on EM grids were incubated

563

first with the corresponding primary antibody and then with protein A coupled to colloidal

564

10-nm gold particles. However, virus-induced membrane modifications were not discernible

565

in these samples, and clear signs of membrane extraction were present. To tackle this issue,

566

we used a previously described modification of the protocol that includes sequential post-

567

staining steps with 1% 1% (wt/vol) OsO4, 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead

568

citrate after immunogold labelling and prior to the final embedding in a thin layer of 1.8%

569

methyl cellulose [43]. Both CM and DMSs were clearly recognizable in these samples, while

570

DMVs were still not apparent and may have been extracted, as empty areas were often found

571

in the vicinity of CM regions.

572

The detection of dsRNA required the preparation of HPF-FS samples. For biosafety

573

considerations, Huh7 cells grown on sapphire disks and infected with MERS-CoV, were first

574

fixed overnight at 13 hpi with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 0.25% (vol/vol) GA in 0.1

575

M PHEM buffer. Then, the samples were frozen with a Leica EM PACT2, after which they

576

were freeze-substituted in a Leica AFS2 system with 0.1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate as

577

previously described [71], with the only modification that acetone was replaced by ethanol

578

from the last washing step before Lowycril infiltration onwards. Cell sections (75 nm thick)

579

were incubated with the primary mouse antibody, then with a bridging rabbit anti-mouse-IgG

580

antibody (Dako Cytomation), and finally with protein A coupled to 15-nm gold particles.

581

After immunolabelling, samples were additionally stained with 7% uranyl acetate and

582

Reynold’s lead citrate.

Electron Microscopy Imaging

585

Individual 2D-EM images were acquired in a Tecnai12 BioTwin or a Twin electron

586

microscope, equipped with an Eagle 4k slow-scan change-couple device (CCD) camera

587

(Thermo Fisher Scientific (formerly FEI)) or a OneView 4k high-frame rate CMOS camera

588

(Gatan), respectively. Mosaic EM images of large grid areas were generated for the

589

quantitative analysis of autoradiography samples, using overlapping automatically-collected

590

images (pixel size 2 nm, Tecnai 12 BioTwin) that were subsequently combined in a

591

composite image as described in [38].

592
593

Electron Tomography

594

Prior to the post-staining step, semi-thin sections (150 nm thick) of CoV-infected cells were

595

incubated with protein A coupled to 10-nm colloidal gold particles that served later as

596

fiducial markers for alignment. Dual-axis tilt series were collected in a Tecnai12 BioTwin

597

microscope using Xplore 3D acquisition software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), covering each

598

120-130o around the specimen with an angular sampling of 1o and a pixel size of 1.2 nm. The

599

alignment of the tilt series and tomogram reconstruction by weighted back-projection was

600

carried out in IMOD [72]. The diameters of DMVs, DMSs and virions were measured at their

601

equator. DMV profiles, often only roughly circular, were measured over their longest and

602

shortest axes, and the diameter was estimated as the geometric mean of the two values. For

603

visualization purposes, the tomograms were first mildly denoised and then processed in

604

Amira 6.0.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a semi-automatic segmentation protocol as

605

previously described [10].

607

Quantitative analysis of autoradiography samples

608

Large mosaic EM maps containing dozens of cell profiles were used for the quantitative

609

analysis of the newly-synthesized RNA autoradiography signal (see S1 Table). For each

610

CoV, different conditions (infected and mock-infected cells, plus different labelling times)

611

were compared using only samples developed after the same period of time. The analysis of

612

the signal in different subcellular regions was carried out using home-built software. Areas of

613

4 µm2 were randomly selected from the mosaic EM maps and the autoradiography grains

614

present in those areas were manually assigned to the underlying cellular structures. The

615

abundance of the different types of subcellular structures was estimated through virtual points

616

in a 5×5 lattice superimposed to each selected area, which were also assigned to the different

617

subcellular classes. Regularly along the process, the annotated data per condition was split

618

into two random groups and the Kendall and Spearman coefficients, which measure the

619

concordance between two data sets [73], were calculated. New random regions were added

620

until the average Kendall and Spearman coefficients resulting from 10 random splits were

621

higher than 0.8 and 0.9, respectively (maximum value, 1). Labelling densities and relative

622

labelling indexes (RLI) were then calculated from the annotated points [39].

623

For the analysis of the association of vRNA synthesis with each of the different ROs motifs,

624

the specific DMVs, DMSs and CM included in the analysis were carefully selected. Only

625

individual DMVs that were at least one micron away from any other virus-induced membrane

626

modification were included in the analysis. For every grain present in an area of 750 nm

627

radius around each DMV, the distance to the DMV centre was measured. In the case of

628

DMSs, which were always part of clusters of virus-induced membrane structures, only DMSs

629

in the periphery of these clusters were selected. The quantified signal was limited to sub-

630

areas devoid of other RO motifs, which were defined by circular arcs (typically 30o to 100o,

631

radius 500 nm) opposite to the RO clusters. CMs are irregular structures that appear partially

632

or totally surrounded by DMVs. Only large CM (> 0.6 µm across) were selected in order to

633

make more apparent (if present) any decay of the autoradiography signal as the distance to

634

the surrounding DMVs increased. For each autoradiography grain, both the distance to the

635

closest CM boundary (d1) and the distance to the opposite CM edge (d2) were measured. The

636

relative distance to the CM edge was then calculated as d1/(d1+d2) and expressed in

637

percentages. All the measurements in different DMVs, DMSs and CM were made using

638

Aperio Imagescope software (Leica) and pooled together into three single data sets.

S1 Appendix: EM autoradiography

3

Autoradiography is a classic technique that allows the EM visualization of a radioactive

4

marker, usually targeting a certain process, and thus reveals the subcellular localization of

5

that process [1, 2]. Tritiated uridine, for example, can be used to locate active RNA synthesis

6

[3-5], as shown also in this study. A clear advantage over the use of alternatives for metabolic

7

labelling of newly-synthesized RNA (e.g. Br-uridine, Br-UTP, 5-ethynil uridine) is that the

8

radioactive precursor is chemically identical to the natural substrate.

9

After labelling, the samples are immediately fixed and processed for EM. The location of the

10

radioactive marker can then be made apparent by applying a highly-sensitive photographic

11

emulsion (a nuclear emulsion) on top of the cell sections and exposing it for several weeks to

12

months. The beta particles that are emitted as a result of tritium disintegrations generate

13

electrons that get trapped in the silver halide emulsion and create a “latent image”. When the

14

emulsion is developed, these negative charges promote the reduction to metallic silver,

15

generating electron-dense grains that are visible by EM. In principle, given enough time to

16

accumulate enough radioactive disintegrations, even low levels of the radioactive marker

17

could be detected. In practice, other factors (e.g. background radiation, emulsion aging) set

18

some limits to autoradiography, which is nonetheless a very sensitive technique.

19

The resolution of EM autoradiography is limited by the fact that radioactive disintegrations

20

generate beta particles that are emitted in random directions. Importantly, the probability of

21

giving rise to signal degreases with the distance from the radioactive source; however, some

22

beta particles may travel up to a few hundred nanometers before striking the photographic

23

emulsion [2]. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the silver grains may not directly

24

overlay the structure containing the radioactive source. Quantitative analyses of the signal

that take this factor into account, like those presented in this study, become indispensable to

26

maximize the information that autoradiography can provide.

cryo-plunging (B). A targeted search revealed the presence of DMSs (white arrowheads) in

42

close association with CM. In comparison with the chemically fixed samples used in this

43

study, the superior ultrastructural preservation of cryo-fixation results in less distorted

44

membranes, but also in a denser cytoplasm and darker CM that makes DMS less apparent.

fixed at 16 and 17 hpi, respectively, and processed for autoradiography EM. (A) Overview of

52

an IBV-infected Vero cell (60 min labelling). The areas containing DMVs and zippered ER

53

are outlined in yellow and blue, respectively, and other subcellular structures annotated (N,

54

nucleus; m, mitochondria; Au, autophagosome; VCR, virion-containing regions). The

55

autoradiography signal accumulates in areas of virus-induced membrane modifications that

56

often only contain DMVs, in alignment with DMVs having an active role in vRNA synthesis.

57

(B) Close-up of the area boxed in black in (A), which contains DMVs, zippered ER and

58

DMSs (orange arrowheads). The contrast between the densely labelled DMVs and the

59

zippered ER and DMSs largely lacking signal is apparent and suggests that the

60

autoradiography grains sometimes present on the latter structures arose from radioactive

61

disintegrations in the surrounding active DMVs. (C) In agreement with this possibility, most

62

of the DMSs (96%) were devoid of signal, and most of those that contained label where close

63

to an active DMV (nDMS = 178). (D) Furthermore, the distribution of autoradiography grains

64

around DMSs resembled that of a random distribution, where the number of grains increase

65

with the distance (nDMS =106). (E) In contrast, a similar analysis of the signal around the

66

DMVs proved that these structures are associated with vRNA synthesis, as the signal reaches

67

maximum values in the proximity of the DMVs (nDMVs = 51). ((C, D) See Materials and

68

Methods for the selection criteria and details). Scale bars, 1 µm.
