Abstract
Viral entry mechanisms for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an important
aspect of virulence. Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease
isoform 2 (TMPRSS2). The distribution of expression of these genes across cell types representing multiple
organ systems in healthy individuals has been recently demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as
diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) and associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2
virulence remain unclear. Here we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entryrelated genes are modulated in target organs of select disease states. In tissues such as heart, which normally
express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in
individuals with comorbidities vs healthy individuals. Additionally, we found increased expression of viral entryrelated genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer or smoking across target organ systems. Our results
demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and suggest new
therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.
Introduction
Comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in
patients with COVID-19 and associated with worse outcomes (1, 2). However, whether these conditions
contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence or simply worsen outcomes through independent mechanisms and
reflect the general disease burden of the population remain unclear (2, 3). Furthermore, clinical and
experimental evidence has demonstrated that in addition to the lungs, SARS-CoV-2 infection of other target
organ systems such as heart, kidney, and blood may have important deleterious consequences which can
potentially compromise organ function and compound disease burden in COVID-19 patients (4, 5).
The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is a key facilitator for host cell entry through its binding
to host cell membrane-bound ACE2 (6). Therefore, the impact of the modulation of ACE2 and related reninangiotensin-aldosterone system genes on COVID-19 has been an area of interest (3) and were included in the
current study. Additionally, after binding, cleavage of the S protein is necessary for S protein-mediated

membrane fusion which drives viral entry into host cells. This proteolytic activity may be cathepsin-L dependent
and occur upon pH change in cellular endosomes, or may occur through the action of membrane bound serine
proteases at the host cell membrane surface or within vesicles (7). Additionally, viral entry mechanisms have
been proposed which involve cleavage of ACE2 itself by membrane bound serine proteases leading to
increased viral entry (7). In fact, the importance of serine proteases in a viral entry mechanism may be
emphasized by the success of serine protease inhibition in vitro (6). However, while this and current
mechanistic studies have focused on the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2 and human airway trypsin-like
protease (HAT, also referred to as TMPRSS11D) additional TTSPs are hypothesized to have similar
extracellular cleavage activity (8) and were included in the current study. Furthermore, the influence of
comorbidities on these genes is unknown. Thus, in the current study we examined the influence of
comorbidities on the expression of key renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and protease genes which may
prime the cell entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 across various organ systems.
Results and Discussion
In a recent thorough report, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was mapped across various body sites in normal
healthy tissue by single cell RNA sequencing (9). However, a more complete model of viral entry for SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 describe a potential role for TMPRSS2, HAT, and potentially other TTSPs (7).
Therefore, to confirm these recent findings and to better understand the expression patterns of other TTSPs in
a healthy setting, expression data was analyzed for 27 different body sites from 3 healthy individuals (Figure
1). In healthy human tissues, there was a diverse transcription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system related
genes (ACE, ACE2, and AGTR1) as well as proteases (ADAM17, TMPRSS1-5, TMPRSSD, TMPRSSE, and
TMPRSS15) which may prime the cell entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 across various organ systems. The
results from our analysis are in agreement with previously reported expression patterns (9). Specifically, both
surveys found high levels of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 expression in colon, heart, kidney, lung, and prostate. In
addition, our analysis suggests salivary gland, small intestine, testis, thyroid, and trachea as sites of high
expression.
Additionally, we examined the impact of a variety of common comorbidities on the expression of these genes in
select organ systems (pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and blood tissues) based on their relevance to infection and

expression levels at baseline. Expression data displayed in each comorbidity heatmap is displayed from
greatest (left) to least (right) expression of ACE2.
In pulmonary tissues (Figure 2A) we found the greatest increase in ACE2 in cancer with substantial increases
in nearly all of the TTSPs, which is consistent with their role in tumor cell proliferation, motility and invasion (8).
Additionally, samples from patients with a history of smoking showed increases in ACE2 in both small and
large airways, consistent with recent findings (10). While expression levels in the context of pre-existing
asthma appeared to be largely unaffected in pulmonary tissues on average, there were more pronounced
increases in bronchial compared to nasal epithelium.
In renal tissues (Figure 2B), we found the greatest expression of ACE2 in obesity. Similar to what has been
seen in pulmonary tissues, a history of smoking or cancer associated with an increase in ACE2 as well as
slight increases in TTSPs in renal biopsy. Hypertensives had increases in ACE2, TMPRSS1 and TMPRSS4 in
renal cortical and tubulointerstium, but not glomerular or medullar samples. Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
resulted in the greatest diversity in modulation of these genes, however, with consistent increases in
TMRPSS4 in 67% of DataSets from both tubular and glomerular origin.
In cardiac tissues (Figure 2C), we found the greatest increases in ACE2 in patients who had experienced heart
failure with pre-existing diabetes or patients with aortic stenosis. While cardiomyopathies resulted in variable
expression levels, increases in ACE2 were found in left ventricle (LV) tissues while decreases were found in
right ventricle (RV) tissues. On average, slight increases were found for many TTSPs with 33% of DataSets
resulting in increases in TMPRSS2.
In blood (Figure 2D), remarkable increases in all selected genes were found in patients with coronary artery
disease. Hypertension and chronic lung pathologies resulted in slight, but consistent increases in most of the
selected genes including ACE2 and many of the TTSPs. Specifically, in hypertension, increases were found in
at least 20% of DataSets for ACE2, ADAM17, AGTR1, TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS3, TMPRSS5,
TMPRSS11A, and TMPRSS15. In contrast to the results seen in renal tissues, obesity did not appear to
modulate the expression of any of these genes in circulating immune cells. Notably, increased expression
levels were found in the context of type 1 diabetes, while decreases were apparent in type 2 diabetes in whole
blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Lastly, highly variable modulation was found in the

context of CKD with or without hemodialysis with increases in ACE, ACE2, AGTR1, TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2,
TMPRSS3, and TMPRSS4 in at least 25% of DataSets.
Because interest in TTSPs seems to have blossomed only within the last decade, their appearances on micro
array technologies and therefore their appearances in these data are limited. However, understanding the
modulation of the expression of these genes across various organ systems and in the context of common
comorbidities should provide us with a more complete understanding of the potential impact of these
comorbidities on viral proliferation. Increases in the expression of these genes as suggested by this data in
common comorbidities across tissues such as hypertension, cancer and a history of smoking may help to
partially explain their association with higher morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. In other comorbidities, such
as obesity, and diabetes or in those with tissue specificity such as in cardiomyopathies and chronic lung
disease, the lack of consistent alteration across tissues may suggest a mechanism for tropism of the virus. To
be sure, while SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virulence is driven by factors outside of viral entry, it may be
important to understand the influence of the varied expression of these genes among target organ systems
and across comorbidities as demonstrated.
In conclusion, expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral-entry related genes in patients suffering from common
comorbidities such as hypertension, cancer, a history of smoking, obesity, diabetes, cardiomyopathies, or
chronic lung or kidney disease may be increased in target organ systems and be capable of directly
contributing to infection. This represents an important step in designing effective therapeutic and preventative
strategies to improve outcomes in vulnerable populations.
Methods
In the current study, we examined the expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in target organ
systems including pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and PBMCs from 2032 patients across a variety of common
comorbidities including hypertension (n=94 hypertensives vs. n=61 normotensives), diabetes (n=131 diabetic
vs. n=101 normoglycemic), obesity (n=56 obese vs. n=58 healthy weight), chronic lung disease (n=200
asthmatic vs. n=106 non-asthmatic and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) n=94 vs. healthy
tissue n=42) and cardiovascular disease (ischemic n=36 and dilated n=91 cardiomyopathy vs. healthy tissue
n=69), as well as other common pathologies such as CKD and cancer. Differential gene expression was

curated from genetic data deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), U.S. National
Library of Medicine, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets and the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory (EMBL), European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Exhaustive queries in these databases in the form
of “[tissue] and [hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, asthma]” were performed using the NCBI and
iLINCS website (ilincs.org) and all hits were considered. DataSeries not containing disease state vs. healthy
controls for the tissues concerned were excluded and common off-target hits such as cancer were included.
Differential Expression analysis was performed using the GEO2R (NCBI) interactive web tool, and the iLINCS
integrative web platform for the analysis of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures
(LINCS). The expression values in healthy tissues are reported as logarithm to base 2 of the fold change
(Log2FC) as described in the GEO DataSet (GDS3113) and visualized by Morpheus (Broad Institute). For
comorbidity disease condition data, expression levels are described in log2FC in relation to each unaffected
control group specific to each DataSeries and heatmaps were generated in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software Inc.). All log2FC values outside of the -2 to 2 range are shown as either -2 or 2. DataSeries in this
