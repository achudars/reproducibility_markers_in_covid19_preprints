Abstract
COVID 19 has emerged as global pandemic with largest damage to the economy and
human psyche. The genomic signature deciphered during the ongoing pandemic period is
valuable to understand the virus evolutionary patterns and spread across the globe. Increased
availability of genome information of circulating strain in our country will enable to generate
selective details in virulent and non virulent markers to prophylaxis and therapeutic
interventions. The first case of SARS CoV-2 was detected in Chambal region of Madhya
Pradesh state in mid of March 2020 followed by multiple introduction events and expansion of
COVID-19 cases within 3 months in this region. We analyzed around 5000 COVID -19
suspected samples referred to Defence Research and Development Establishment, Gwalior,
Madhya Pradesh. A total of 136 cases were found positive over a span of three months period
this includes virus introduction to region and further spread. Whole genome sequences
employing Oxford nanopore technology were deciphered for 26 SARS-CoV-2 circulating in 10
different districts in Madhya Pradesh State of India. The region witnessed index cases with
multiple travel history responsible for introduction of COVID-19 followed by remarkable
expansion of virus. The genome wide substitutions including in important viral proteins were
observed. The detailed phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulating SARS-CoV-2 clustered in
multiple clades A2a, A4 and B. The cluster wise segregation was observed suggesting multiple
introduction links and evolution of virus in the region. This is the first comprehensive details of
whole genome sequence analysis from central India region, which will add genome wide
knowledge towards diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Introduction
Emergence of novel virus is considered as a major challenge to humanity. SARS CoV-2,
the etiology of “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19) has emerged in Wuhan, China, in
December 2019 (CSG, 2020). COVID-19 was declared as a public health emergency of
international concern (PHEIC) by WHO in 30 January 2020. Subsequently, the incidence of
disease and mortality increased across the globe. Finally, WHO declared COVID-19 as a
pandemic on 11th March, 2020 based on the speed and scale of transmission across the globe
(Andersen et al., 2020). The disease has affected more than 17 million persons as on 30th July
2020 and still rising rapidly. The common signs of infection include cough, fever, sore throat,
respiratory symptoms inclusive of shortness/difficulties in breathing. More severe symptoms
can include pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death with
coalescence of factors (Zhu et al., 2020, Youg et al., 2020). Many COVID-19 cases have been
reported to be asymptomatic and they serve as carrier of SARS-CoV-2 (Xu et al., 2020; He et
al., 2020).
SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19 is a novel virus and a member of
subgenus- Sarbecovirus, genus- Betacoronavirus of family- Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV and
MERS CoV, etiology of SARS and MERS are the closest relative within this group. Whole
Genome Sequences (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 suggest bat-CoV to be its closest progenitor with
96% homology. However, Receptor binding domain (RBD) of its Spike protein with an
efficient binding to ACE-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cell seems to have been
derived from Pangolin CoVs (Wan et al., 2020, Andersen et al., 2020).
The first three cases in India were reported from the state of Kerala in late January and
early February, with a travel history of Wuhan, China. India took drastic steps to contain the

further spread of the virus including imposition of travel restrictions to-and-from the affected
countries. There were no new cases of COVID-19 for almost a month. All three cases
subsequently tested negative making India free of the disease at that point of time (Press
Information Bureau, PIB, India, 2020). However, while the global focus was on China and
other eastern countries like South Korea and Japan; European countries, middle-east and the
USA reported a surge in cases of COVID-19, pressing the WHO to declare it as a pandemic.
Since March 2020 onwards, India also witnessed a surge of imported cases from countries other
than China which has been further assisted with local transmission. In March, imposition of
nationwide lockdown checked the epidemic curve. Despite these measurements, the exodus of
individual from their place of work to native places led to rapid transmission of virus to remote
corners of the country. India now stands dangerously at 3rd position with overall 1.8 million
reported infections with the cases accelerating rapidly.
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 comprises of a single stranded positive sense RNA of
approximately 29.9kb long that codes for 14 ORFs and 27 proteins. Out of these, there are four
structural proteins viz., spike surface glycoproteins (S), Envelope protein (E), Membrane
protein (M) and Nucleocapsid protein (N); 15 non structural protein (nsp1-nsp10) and nsp12nsp16 and 8 accessory proteins 3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b and ORF 14.
Genetic characterization of a virus is extremely important from both epidemiological and
microbial forensics points of view. We at Defence Research & Development Establishment
(DRDE) Gwalior being a nodal center for COVID-19 diagnosis engaged in screening of COVID19 suspected cases from 10 different districts viz., Gwalior, Morena, Ashoknagar, Sheopur,
Shivpuri, Guna, Datia, Bhind, Jabalpur, Bhopal. In this region the specimens were collected by
medical authorities at different district hospitals from mid of March to May 2020. Around 5000

samples were referred with detailed patient history from the district health authorities to DRDE,
Gwalior.
Next generation sequencing (NGS), an emerging technology aided understanding of
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and its transmission patterns after it enters a new
population (Chen and Li et al., 2020). This is proving to be an important step towards
formulating strategies for management of this pandemic. In this study, we characterized the
genome of representative viruses involved in index cases of the region along with expansion
and fatal cases. Further the whole genome analysis was performed to annotate genome wide
amino acid substitutions. The detailed molecular phylogentic analysis was carried out to classify
viruses into different clusters and to understand their transmission linkages.

Methods
COVID-19 laboratory screening
Nasopharyngeal/Nasal/Oropharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium (VTM) received from
acute phase patients with defined symptoms, asymptomatic cases with contact history with
positive patients/ travel history were processed for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 at
Defence Research and Development Establishment, (DRDE) Gwalior, M.P., India. These
samples were referred from 10 different districts health authorities of Madhya Pradesh, India
during the period of March –May 2020. The laboratory diagnosis was accomplished through a
Taqman qRT-PCR as recommended by WHO and ICMR.

Isolation of viral RNA
The samples were processed in a BSL-3 facility (High Containment Facility) following
biosafety precautions at DRDE, Gwalior. The viral RNA was extracted from the referred samples

using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
560 µl of lysis buffer was added to 140 µl of clinical specimen and incubated for 10 min at room
temperature, the sample was passed through silica column followed by washing in 500 µl wash
buffer and finally the viral RNA was eluted in 50 µl of elution buffer in a nuclease free tube and
stored at 4ºC before addition to downstream molecular detection assay.

Laboratory Investigation of COVID-19
Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated by performing SARS-CoV-2 screening and
confirmatory assays targeting Envelope, RdRP, ORF 1ab, N genes along with Human Rnase P
as a housekeeping gene control to ensure RNA quality during sample collection as per WHO
protocol. The Taqman qRT-PCR was performed with dual labeled hydrogenic probes labeled
with FAM/VIC (E/Rnase P- Screening Assay), FAM/VIC (RdRP/ORF- Confirmatory Assay),
N gene (Confirmatory assay). The fluorescence signals were recorded in ABI 7500 Dx Real
time PCR (ABI, USA).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 whole genome sequencing
The representative positive cases were selected on the basis of patients with travel history
in the region (n=6), patients with different age group from similar contact history (n=10);
introduction links from different areas to different families (n=4), COVID-19 positive death
cases (n=2) and index cases from different districts (n=4). Based on above mentioned criteria,
qRT-PCR positive cases (n=26) were selected for whole genome sequencing. Briefly cDNA
was synthesized using Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (NEB, USA) along with 23 mer
oligo dT linker, 50μM random hexamer and 10mM dNTPs mix. The reaction was incubated at
65ºC for 5 min and snap chilled at ice, Further reverse transcription was performed at 42ºC 50
min followed by 70ºC 10min. The cDNA was stored at -80ºC until further use.

Amplification of Whole genome by Oxford Nanopore Platform
SARS CoV-2 whole genome sequencing was performed as per ARCTIC protocol by Josh
Quick. Briefly cDNA from samples were used as template for multiplex PCR to amplify SARSCoV-2 genome and the amplified products were purified. Purified cDNA amplicons from each
sample were barcoded individually and pooled at equimolar concentration to prepare nanopore
library. The quality and quantity of the pooled library was assessed using standard methods and
sequenced on GridION-X5 nanopore sequencer. To generate tiled PCR amplicons from the
SARS-CoV-2 viral cDNA, primers were designed using primal scheme. These primers were
pooled into three different primer sets named as pool 1, 2 and 3.
Briefly multiplex PCR was set with initial denaturation at 98ºC for 30sec followed by 25
cycles of denaturation at 98ºC for 15 sec and annealing and extension at 65ºC for 5 min.
Amplification from respective primers sets were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Raw
data generated was subjected to analysis using ARCTIC protocol to generate consensus
sequences for SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Nanopore library preparation and sequencing
Amplified products obtained from multiplex PCR of pool 1, 2 and 3 were pooled and
purified by using Ampure-XP beads. 50ng from each samples were taken for library preparation
using native barcoding kit and ligation kit from Oxford nanopore technology (ONT). Equimolar
DNA from each sample was taken and end-repaired using NEBNext Ultra II End repair/datailing Module and cleaned with 0.4X AmPure xp Beads. Native barcode ligation was performed
with NEBNext Ultra II Ligation Module using Native Barcoding kit. All barcode ligated samples
were pooled together and purified using 0.4X of AmPure beads. Further sequencing adapter
liagation was performed using NEB next quick ligation Module. Library mix was cleaned up

using 0.4X AmPure beads and finally sequencing library was eluted in 15 μl of elution buffer
and used for sequencing on SpotONflowcell in a 48hr sequencing protocol on GridION release
19.06.9. Nanopore raw reads (‘fast5” format) were basecalled (‘fastq5’ format) and multiplexed
using Guppy v3.2.2.

Data Analysis
Base-calling and demultiplexing of nanopore raw data was done using Guppy. The
processed data was used for variant calling using Arctic pipeline and consensus generation using
bam based method. The Arctic pipeline uses processed reads to align against the available SARS
CoV-2 reference genome. Further, variant calling and consensus sequence generation was done
using Nanopolish. The good quality variants were used for annotation using snpEff tool.

Genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2
The nucleotide sequences of representative SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and NCBI GenBank, edited and analysed
employing EditSeq and MegAlign modules of lasergene5 software package (DNASTAR Inc,
USA). The complete genome of 26 SARS-CoV-2 deciphered in this study was comparatively
analysed with prototype SARS CoV-2 isolated from Wuhan, China (GenBank Acc No
MN908947). Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using MUSCLE alignment method in
Bioedit software module. The amino acid substitutions of viruses sequenced in this study was
compared to prototype SARS CoV-2 Wuhan strain.
Phylogenetic analysis based on SARS CoV-2 whole genomes were carried out with
respect to globally diversified SARS CoV-2 (n=37) available at NCBI GenBank and GISAID
data base from December 2019- May 2020 (Table 3). The phylogenetic tree was constructed

employing Neighbor Joining method with 1,000 replicates of bootstrap analysis with general
time- reversible model with gamma distributed rates of variations among sites using Mega 5.03
software.

Results
Clinical representation and laboratory diagnosis of COVID -19 cases
One hundred thirty six Cases referred to DRDE, Gwalior were found positive in period
of three months (Last week of March- May 2020) diagnosed for COVID-19. All samples were
investigated by WHO approved real time RT-PCR using SARS CoV-2 specific primers and
probes for E, RP, RdRP and N genes. RNaseP as a housekeeping control was kept to ensure
sample collection quality. All positive samples had shown clear positive amplification curve for
presence of above mentioned genes (Fig. 1). The overall RT-PCR positivity was observed as 4%.
The minimum age of COVID-19 infected cases were observed as 05 months whereas highest
observed as 98 yrs. The maximum positive cases were found to belong to 21 to 30 year age
group. Death in immunocompromised patients was reported within 24-48 hrs of hospitalization.
The clinical history revealed the maximum symptomatic cases suffered from fever, sore throat,
breathlessness. Maximum case positivity (68%) was reported from district Morena.

SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing
Twenty six reference samples detailed in Table 3 along with GISAID accession numbers,
patient age, location were sequenced in this study. The Ct values of all these 26 samples in
respect to different genes were provided in Table 2. The viral RNA from above samples were
converted to cDNA. The cDNA was processed for amplification through 3 pools of specific

primers (Fig 2). The NGS led to generation of around 0.03 to 0.30 million nanopore reads. The
length of RNA genomes was found to be 29.89 kb. The sequencing coverage for all samples was
in range of 590X to 5000X showing high depth of sequence data. The processed reads from
Guppy was used for variant calling using Arctic pipeline. The good quality filtered variants
obtained was in the range of 5-13 across 24 samples. The predicted variants were further
annotated using SnpEff TOOL. The reference genome of SARS CoV-2 was used for annotating
good quality variants. The alignment files from Arctic pipeline were used for generating
consensus sequence based on read depth of 10 supporting a position across genome. The bases
present in consensus sequence are of two types: A, G, C, T having read depth of 10 or more and
lower case base a, t, g, c, n having read depth of less than 10 a/t/g/c and read depth of 0(n).
Around 30 kb size consensus was generated for all samples with a range of 0.003-3.86% N’s
(non-ATGC) observed in the consensus.

Molecular analysis of whole genome sequences
The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences including viruses from different global location and
within India for a period of December 2019 to May 2020, were retrieved from GISAID, EpiCov
global reference web interface representative cases (Table 3). The amino acid substitutions were
observed scattered throughout the genome. A total of 38 amino acid substitutions were observed
compared to prototype Wuhan strain (n=38). Out of these, 24 were found in ORF1ab protein, 5
in S protein, 2 in ORF 3a, 1 each in (E, M and ORF 7a) and 4 in N protein. The unique nonsynonymous variants from all samples are shown Table 4.
Important non-synonymous variants includes RdRp: A97V observed in 7 strains
including virus introductory index cases from three different districts, N: P13L observed in 4
strains, NSP3: T2016K observed in 7 strains including introductory index cases from three

different districts. Five amino acid substitutions observed in spike protein viz., E583D in a strain
from Datia, D614G observed in 17 strains from Morena, Datia, Gwalior, Ashoknagar, S884F in
one strain from Morena, S929T in one strain from Ashoknagar and S943P observed in one strain
of introductory index case from Gwalior district. Amino acid substitutions D614G was also
observed in one of fatal case sequenced in this study.

Phylogenetic Analysis
Whole genome based phylogenetic analysis conducted for SARS CoV-2 complete
genome (29.89 Kb, n= 37) retrieved from GISAID web interface includes the representatives
from all location at globe including Asia, Europe, Americas sampled between December 2019 to
May 2020. The detailed molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed circulation of A1-A4 and B
clades globally. Indian viruses were found to belong to multiple evolutionary genetic clades
(A2a, A3, A4 and B). However, the Indian viruses sequenced in this study were found belong to
three clades viz., A2a, A4 and B. Majority of virus were clustered in clade A2a (n=17), whereas
seven and two viruses were found belong to clade A4 and clade B respectively. The detailed
phylogeny was depicted in Fig 3.

DISCUSSION
SARS-CoV-2 the etiology of COVID pandemic has been spreading throughout the world
at a very rapid pace. The disease was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The
rapid transmission and expansion of geographical territories has led to devastating effect on
global health and economy. India is also witnessing one of the fastest growing COVID-19
infections in the world. The early lockdown in India resulted in a pause in rise of new infections.
However following the mass movement of people across the nation, there is an unprecedented
expansion of pandemic in different parts. The sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China is not

well understood. Several reports have traced the evolutionary origins of SARSCoV-2 to SARS
CoV from bats (Zhou et al, 2020) and Pangolins (Lam et al 2020). There is also a renewed
interest to understand the evolutionary path being followed by SARS CoV-2 to undertake
effective control and mitigation measures. In spite of large number of reported cases in India, the
genomes of few Indian circulating viruses are available. Further, there is a paucity of sequence
data on the genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in central India.
We have been investigating COVID-19 suspected cases from mid of March to May 2020,
where 136 cases were found positive from central India region (10 different districts including
whole Chambal region from Madhya Pradesh state). We report the sequencing of 26 whole
genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses directly from infected patients, from ongoing COVID-19
pandemic in India.
The length of RNA genomes was found to be 29.89 kb. SARS-CoV-2, being a RNA
(ribonucleic acid) virus is highly prone to mutations. A number of mutations including non
synonymous substitutions (responsible for change in protein) were identified across the viruses
sequenced in this study. These mutations were spread across the genome including in ORF1ab,
spike, matrix, envelope and nucleoprotein regions. High evolutionary activity has been recorded
in some regions (district Morena, Shivpuri, Gwalior, Datia) of the genome. An important
substitution (Spike: D614G) was identified in 17 SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in this study. D614G
mutation in spike protein is an interesting substitution and has been reported with increased tally
[Korber et al., 2020; Chnadrika et al., 2020]. Structurally, this mutation is located in the S1
subunit that also contains the RBD domain. Although present outside the functional region, the
proximity of D614G around S1 cleavage site implicates an important change in the local
environment. In addition, the key mutation in spike protein (D614G) also involves loss of the

charged group. These mutations that lead to positively charged groups may cause more severe
structural and functional effects. Recently, this mutation has been reported to make the virus
more infectious. This mutation was further linked to higher number of cases and significant
mortality rate in Europe (Pachetti et al, 2020). In vitro studies also seem to support the
hypothesis of increased transmissibility (Korber et al, 2020; Hu et al, 2020). The mutation was
also recorded in one of fatal cases sequenced in this study. Presence of this mutation in majority
of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in this study indicates towards the circulation of this highly
infectious virus variant in central part of India.
Of notable other significance is the P13L variant (C28311T) in the Nucleocapsid protein which
is required for the viral entry into the cells (Maitra et al., 2020). The amino acid substitution was
recorded in 4 viral strains, including two index cases from (Shivpuri and Morena) were recorded
in samples sequenced in this study. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region
involved in viral capsid formation. Another important amino acid substitution P323L (RNA
dependent RNA polymerase protein) was recorded in 16 viral strains sequenced in this study.
This amino acid substitution is also a specific mutation for clade A2a.
The first index case (A) was identified from district Shivpuri from a person with travel
history to Hyderabad in southern India. This led to emergence of the virus in this region, prior to
which only 10 cases were confirmed from the whole state. During the first lockdown period
another important index case (B) was reported from district Morena having travel history to
Dubai. This index case led to emergence of SARS CoV-2 from district Morena. The index cases
from district Sheopur and Gwalior was traced to patients having travel history to Indore and
United States. Since these introductory events happened during stringent lockdown period, the

infections were contained rapidly through implementation of contact tracing, quarantine and
isolation.
Following the lifting of lockdown, spread of infections was reported from different
districts with a remarkable positivity in whole state. The highest number of case positivity (68%)
reported from district Morena in post lock down period, primarily due to reverse migration of
workforce. The detailed analysis revealed multiple introduction events with diverse geographical
linkage. A sudden rise in cases was observed which indicates a rapid evolution of virus in central
India region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a very distinct cladding pattern of virus emergence
and evolution in different districts. The introductory index cases were found belong to clade B,
whereas, virus sequence from same district were found belong to clade A4/ A2a after a gap of
one month during post lock down (Unlock 1).
Majority of Indian viruses sequenced in this study were found belong to clade A2a
(n=17). This is a clade having travelers importation links to Italy, UK, France. Another n=7
viruses clustered in clade A4 comprises viral entries from Southeast Asia and central Asia. The
index case from district Morena, Sheopur, Shivpuri and Gwalior was having a travel history from
Dubai, Indore, Hyderabad and USA. These initial index cases were found belong to separate
clusters (Clade B). The further expansions in viral emergence in these districts were found with
clear shift to worldwide circulating A2a and A4 clades. The independent grouping with different
clusters of infection with region was also observed.
In summary, this is the first detailed genomic signature analysis of SARS-CoV-2
emergence and expansion in the Chambal region of state Madhya Pradesh, central India. This
analysis also explained the initial introductory link to further virus evolution in different districts

in pre and post lockdown period. Continuous monitoring of genomic architecture of SARS-CoV2 for possible mutations is crucial for success of diagnostics, vaccine and therapeutics. This will
be useful in mapping the spread and evolution of COVID-19 in future and can aid in microbial
forensics investigation.
