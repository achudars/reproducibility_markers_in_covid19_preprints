Abstract
An inexpensive readily manufactured COVID-19 vaccine that protects against severe disease is
needed to combat the pandemic. We have employed the LVS ΔcapB vector platform, previously
used successfully to generate potent vaccines against the Select Agents of tularemia, anthrax,
plague, and melioidosis, to generate a COVID-19 vaccine. The LVS ΔcapB vector, a replicating
intracellular bacterium, is a highly attenuated derivative of a tularemia vaccine (LVS) previously
administered to millions of people. We generated vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural
proteins and evaluated them for efficacy in the golden Syrian hamster, which develops severe
COVID-19 disease. Hamsters immunized intradermally or intranasally with a vaccine coexpressing the Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins, then challenged 5-weeks later
with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2, were protected against severe weight loss and lung pathology
and had reduced viral loads in the oropharynx and lungs. Protection by the vaccine, which
induces murine N-specific interferon-gamma secreting T cells, was highly correlated with prechallenge serum anti-N TH1-biased IgG. This potent vaccine against severe COVID-19 should
be safe and easily manufactured, stored, and distributed, and given the high homology between
MN proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, has potential as a universal vaccine against the
SARS subset of pandemic causing β-coronaviruses.

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths as of this writing 1. A
safe and potent vaccine that protects against severe COVID-19 disease is urgently needed to
contain the pandemic. Ideally, such a vaccine would be safe, inexpensive, rapidly manufactured,
and easily stored and distributed, so as to be available quickly to the entire world population.

Previously, our laboratory developed a versatile plug-and-play Single Vector Platform Vaccine
against Select Agents and Emerging Pathogens wherein a single live multi-deletional attenuated
Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica vector, LVS ΔcapB, is used to express recombinant
immunoprotective antigens of target pathogens 2,3 . The LVS ΔcapB vector was derived via
mutagenesis from Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), a vaccine against tularemia originally developed
in the Soviet Union via serial passage and subsequently further developed and tested in humans
in the USA 4,5. As with wild-type F. tularensis, LVS is ingested by host macrophages via
looping phagocytosis, enters a phagosome, escapes the phagosome via a Type VI Secretion
System, and multiplies in the cytoplasm 6-8. While much more attenuated than LVS, the LVS
ΔcapB vector retains its parent’s capacity to invade and multiply in macrophages 9. Using this
platform technology, we have developed exceptionally safe and potent vaccines that protect
against lethal respiratory challenge with the Tier 1 Select Agents of four diseases – tularemia,
anthrax, plague, and melioidosis 2,3. These vaccines induce balanced humoral
(antibody/neutralizing antibody in the case of anthrax toxin) and cell-mediated immune
responses (polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells) against key immunoprotective antigens of
target pathogens 3. We have now used this platform to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins – the Spike (S) glycoprotein, Membrane (M), Envelope
(E), and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Virtually all COVID-19 vaccines in development have
focused on the S protein, which mediates virus entry into host cells via the Angiotensin
Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 10,11. These vaccines have been tested for efficacy most
prominently in the rhesus macaque model of COVID-19. However, this is primarily a model of
asymptomatic infection or mild disease, as animals typically do not develop either fever or
weight loss; hence, vaccine efficacy in the rhesus macaque is quantitated primarily in terms of
the vaccine’s impact on viral load rather than on clinical symptoms. In contrast, the golden
Syrian hamster develops severe COVID-19 disease, akin to that of hospitalized humans 12,
including substantial weight loss and quantifiable lung pathology.

Herein, we have employed the LVS ΔcapB vector platform to construct six COVID-19 vaccines
expressing one or more of all four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (S, SΔTM, S1, S2, S2E,
and MN) and tested the vaccines for efficacy, administered intradermally (ID) or intranasally
(IN), against a high dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge in hamsters. We show that the
vaccine expressing the MN proteins, but not the vaccines expressing the S protein or its subunits
in various configurations, is highly protective against severe COVID-19 disease including weight
loss and lung pathology, and that protection is highly correlated with serum anti-N antibody
levels.

Construction and verification of rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 vaccine candidates. We constructed six
recombinant LVS ΔcapB vaccines (rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2) expressing single, subunit or fusion
proteins of four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins: S 13, E, M, and N (Fig. 1A). The S protein is
synthesized as a single-chain inactive precursor of 1,273 residues with a signal peptide (residue
1-15) and processed by a furin-like host proteinase into the S1 subunit that binds to host receptor
ACE2 10 and the S2 subunit that mediates the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. S1
contains the host receptor binding domain (RBD) and S2 contains a transmembrane domain
(TM) (Fig. 1B, top panel). We constructed rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 expressing S (stabilized) and,
so as to express lower molecular weight constructs, SΔTM, S1, S2, and the fusion protein of S2
and E (S2E), and additionally, a vaccine expressing the fusion protein of M and N (MN) (Fig.
1B, bottom panels). A 3FLAG-tag was placed at the N-terminus of the S, SΔTM, S1, and MN
proteins. The antigen expression cassette of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins was placed downstream
of a strong F. tularensis promoter (Pbfr) and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Fig. 1B) that we have
used successfully to generate potent vaccines against F. tularensis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia
pestis, and Burkholderia pseudomallei.
All six rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 vaccine candidates, abbreviated as S, SΔTM, S1, S2, S2E,
and MN, expressed the recombinant proteins from bacterial lysates. As shown in Fig. 1C, three
protein bands – a minor 75 kDa, a major 46 kDa, and a minor 30 kDa band – were detected from
lysates of 4 individual clones of the MN vaccine candidate (Fig. 1C, lanes 3-6), but not from the
lysate of the vaccine vector (lane 2) by Western blotting using guinea pig polyclonal antibody to
SARS-CoV, which also detected the N and S protein of SARS-CoV (lanes 7 and 8, respectively).
The 75-, 46-, and 30-kDa protein bands represent the full-length MN, the N, and degradations of
the MN protein. The S, SΔTM, S1, S2, and S2E proteins were also expressed by the rLVS

ΔcapB/SCoV2 vaccines, as evidenced by Western blotting analysis using monoclonal antibody
to FLAG to detect S, SΔTM, and S1 (each with an N-terminus FLAG tag) and polyclonal
antibody to SARS-CoV to detect non-tagged S2 protein (Fig. S1, A-D). Of note, SΔTM and S1
(Fig. S1B) were expressed more abundantly than the full-length S protein (Fig. S1A), possibly as
a result of the removal of the TM domain and reduced size of the protein.

Study of vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in the hamster model. We
immunized Syrian hamsters (8/group, ½ female, ½ male) ID or IN twice, 3 weeks apart, with six
rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 vaccine candidates – S, SΔTM, S1, S2, S2E, and MN – singly and in
combination (MN + SΔTM; MN + S1). Five weeks later, we challenged the animals with 105
plaque forming units (pfu) of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 strain) administered
IN, and then closely monitored them for clinical signs of infection including weight loss.
Animals immunized with PBS (Sham) or with the vector LVS ΔcapB served as controls. At 1, 2,
and 3 days post-challenge, oropharyngeal swabs were collected daily and assayed for viral load
by plaque assay. At 3 and 7 days post-challenge, half of the animals in each group (4 animals, ½
male, ½ female) were euthanized and evaluated for lung viral load and lung histopathological
changes, respectively (Fig. 2A).

MN vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 induced weight loss in the hamster model.
As shown in Fig. 2B (top and middle panels), hamsters immunized either ID (top panels) or IN
(middle panels) with the MN vaccine, alone or in combination with the SΔTM or S1 vaccines,
were significantly protected against severe weight loss after high dose SARS-CoV-2 IN
challenge [P<0.0001, P<0.01, and P<0.0001 for Sham vs MN administered ID, IN, or ID/IN

(either ID or IN), respectively (Day 7) and P<0.0001 for Sham vs. all MN vaccine groups
administered ID/IN] (Table S1A). All animals lost weight during the first 2 days after
challenge; however, hamsters immunized with the MN vaccine, alone or in combination with the
SΔTM or S1 vaccine, began to recover from the weight loss starting on Day 3, whereas shamimmunized animals continued to lose weight until euthanized on Day 7, by which time they had
lost a mean of 8% of their total body weight. Hamsters immunized with the vector control
continued to lose weight until Day 5 and then exhibited a small partial recovery, possibly
reflecting a small beneficial non-specific immunologic effect as has been hypothesized for BCG
and other vaccines. In contrast to hamsters immunized with the MN vaccine, hamsters
immunized with the S, SΔTM, S1, S2, or S2E vaccines, administered ID or IN, were not
protected against severe weight loss (Fig. 2B, bottom panels).

MN vaccine protects against severe lung pathology in the hamster model. To evaluate
vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2-induced lung disease, we assessed cranial and caudal lung
histopathology on Day 7 post-challenge, which peaks in unvaccinated animals at this time point.
As shown in Fig. 3A and Table S2, hamsters immunized either ID or IN with the MN vaccine,
alone (MN) or in combination with SΔTM or S1, were consistently protected against severe lung
pathology after high dose SARS-CoV-2 IN challenge (P< 0.0001 vs. sham-immunized hamsters
for all MN containing groups, whether administered ID or IN; P<0.0001 vs. vector control for all
MN groups when administered ID and P<0.01 - P<0.0001 vs. vector control for all MN groups
when administered IN) (Table S1B). Compared with sham-immunized hamsters, the
histopathology score in the cranial and caudal lungs of hamsters vaccinated with the MN vaccine
was reduced on average by 71% when administered ID and 63% when administered IN. In

contrast, hamsters immunized with one of the five S protein vaccines were not significantly
protected against severe lung pathology whether the vaccines were administered ID or IN (Fig.
3B).

MN vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in the oropharynx and lungs of
hamsters. To examine the impact of vaccines on viral replication, we collected oropharyngeal
swabs of all hamsters (n = 8/group) on Days 1, 2, and 3 post-challenge and assayed viral load by
plaque assay. Hamsters immunized ID or IN with MN alone, or in combination with SΔTM or
S1, showed significantly reduced viral titers in the oropharynx. Specifically, compared with
sham-immunized animals, hamsters immunized ID with MN showed a 0.8±0.4, 1.0±0.4, and
1.2+0.4 log reduction (Mean ± SE) in viral load at Days 1, 2, and 3 post-challenge, respectively
(P = 0.04, 0.02, and 0.004, resp.); hamsters immunized ID with MN+SΔTM or MN+S1 also
showed significant reductions in viral titer compared with sham-immunized animals on Day 1
(P<0.05 for both vaccines) and, for MN+S1, on Day 3 (P<0.01) post-challenge (Fig. 4A, left
graph). Animals immunized IN with MN vaccines (MN, MN+SΔTM, MN+S1) also showed
reduced viral load compared with sham- and vector-immunized animals on Days 1-3 postchallenge, on average 0.8±0.3, 0.8±0.3, and 0.6±0.3 logs fewer than Sham on Days 1-3 postchallenge (P <0.02 for all MN vaccines vs. Sham on Days 1 and 2 post-challenge) (Fig. 4A,
right graph). All MN vaccines combined, whether administered ID or IN, showed mean
reductions compared with Sham of 0.9±0.3, 0.6±0.3 and 0.8±0.3 logs on Days 1, 2, and 3,
respectively (P< 0.01, P< 0.05, and P< 0.01, resp.). In contrast, hamsters immunized with the S
protein vaccines (S, S∆TM, S1, S2, and S2E) did not show significantly reduced viral titers

compared with sham-immunized animals whether the vaccines were administered ID or IN (data
not shown).

To evaluate viral replication in the lungs, we assayed cranial and caudal lungs for viral load on
Day 3 post-challenge, which peaks at this time point in unvaccinated animals. Hamsters
immunized ID with the MN vaccine, alone or in combination with the SΔTM or S1, showed
significantly reduced viral loads in their cranial and caudal lungs compared with sham- or vectorimmunized animals (Fig. 4B, left panel). Hamsters immunized ID with the MN vaccines as a
group showed a mean reduction of 0.8±0.1 log compared with Sham (P< 0.0001). In contrast,
hamsters immunized ID with the S (S, SΔTM, S1, S2, S2E) protein vaccines did not show
reduced viral loads in their cranial and caudal lungs (data not shown). Similar results were
observed in hamsters immunized IN (Fig. 4B, right panel).

MN expressing vaccines induce antibody to N protein with a TH1 bias. To assess antibody
responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins expressed by the vaccine, we analyzed antibodies to the
RBD of the S protein and to the N protein (Fig. 5). As expected, sera from sham- and vectorimmunized hamsters lacked antibody to either antigen (Fig. 5A-C). In contrast, sera from
hamsters immunized once with the MN vaccine, alone or in combination with the SΔTM or S1
vaccine, showed high levels of N specific IgG, whether immunized ID or IN, at 3 weeks postimmunization (Fig. 5A), which somewhat increased at Week 8, 5 weeks after the second
immunization at Week 3 (Fig. 5B), displaying a TH1 type bias, with IgG2 dominating the
response (Fig. 5C). Differences in serum anti-N IgG titers between hamsters immunized with
the MN vaccine, alone or in combination with S protein vaccines, and sham- or vector-

immunized hamsters were highly significant at both Week 3 and Week 8 (P<0.0001) (Fig. 5D).
Surprisingly, hamsters immunized with S protein vaccines did not show anti-RBD antibody at
Week 3 (Fig. 5A), nor SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody at Week 8 (data not shown). In mice
immunized at Weeks 0 and 3 with second generation vaccines expressing MN in combination
with S1 or SΔTM, serum obtained at Week 4 showed anti-RBD antibody as well as anti-N
antibody (Fig. S2). Anti-N IgG antibody displayed a TH1 type bias both in hamsters (Fig. 5C),
where IgG2 dominated the IgG response, and in mice, where IgG2a dominated the IgG response
(Fig. S2). This TH1 bias was also reflected by murine splenocyte secretion of IFN- in response
to S and N peptides (Fig. S3).

Serum anti-N antibody correlates with protection in hamsters. We assessed the correlation
coefficient between serum anti-N IgG antibody just before challenge at Week 8 and lung (cranial
+ caudal) histopathological scores at Day 7 post-challenge by linear regression analysis. Anti-N
antibody was highly and inversely correlated with histopathology score (R2= 0.9903, P< 0.0001)
(Fig. 5E). This antibody, which does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (data not shown), likely is not
itself protective but instead correlates with a protective T cell response such as that shown in Fig.
S3.

Discussion
We show that a replicating LVS ΔcapB-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 MN,
that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 M and N proteins, protects against COVID-19 disease in the
demanding golden Syrian hamster model. The vaccine significantly protects against weight loss
and severe lung pathology, the two major clinical endpoints measured, and significantly reduces
viral titers in the oropharynx and lungs. The vaccine was protective after either ID or IN
administration.

Surprisingly, of the six vaccines expressing one or more of the four SARS-CoV-2 structural
proteins, only the vaccine expressing the MN proteins was protective. Such a vaccine has the
potential to provide cross-protective immunity against the SARS subgroup of β-coronaviruses
including potential future pandemic strains. While the S protein shows only 76% sequence
identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the M and N proteins each show 90% identity
14

. In an analysis of T-cell epitopes in humans recovered from COVID, the M and N antigens

together accounted for 33% of the total CD4+ T cell response (21% and 11% for M and N,
respectively) and 34% of the total CD8+ T cell response (12% and 22% for M and N,
respectively), an amount exceeding the 27% and 26% CD4 and CD8 T cell responses,
respectively, of the S protein 15. Hence, the MN vaccine has potential for universal protection
against this group of especially severe pandemic strains.

We evaluated our vaccines in the hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of its high
similarity to serious human COVID-19 disease, which likely reflects at least in part the high
genetic similarity of the hamster and human ACE2 receptor – S protein interface. A modelling

of binding affinities showed that the hamster ACE2 has the highest binding affinity to SARSCoV-2 S of all species studied with the exception of the human and rhesus macaque.

In our previous studies of vaccines utilizing the LVS ΔcapB vector platform, three immunization
doses consistently yielded superior efficacy to two doses. Here, given the urgency for a COVID19 vaccine and the desire to simplify the logistics of vaccine administration, we opted to test
only two immunizations, while still maintaining a reasonably long immunization-challenge
interval (5 weeks after the second immunization). Future studies will examine if three doses are
superior to two and the longevity of immunoprotection.

Generally speaking, vaccine efficacy in a relevant animal model of disease is the best predictor
of vaccine efficacy in humans. That non-human primates (NHPs) challenged with SARS-CoV-2
develop only mild disease or remain asymptomatic brings into question the utility of this animal
model as a predictor of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in humans. Nevertheless, most published
studies on vaccine efficacy have been conducted in NHPs 16-21; the absence of quantifiable
clinical symptoms limited these studies to measuring differences in viral load between
immunized and control animals. In contrast to NHPs, SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters
develop quantifiable clinical symptoms, especially weight loss and lung pathology, akin to
humans seriously ill with COVID-19. Since the major utility of a vaccine is in preventing
serious infection and death, the hamster is a highly relevant animal model for assessing COVID19 vaccine efficacy, and studies in hamsters can be conducted at a fraction of the cost,
complexity, human and facility resources, and ethical concerns of studies in NHPs.

Many types of vaccines are being developed against COVID-19 including DNA, RNA, and
protein/adjuvant vaccines, non-replicating and replicating viral-vectored vaccines, whole
inactivated virus vaccines, and virus-like particles. To our knowledge, ours is the only vaccine
comprising a replicating bacterial vector. Replicating vaccines are among the most successful
vaccines in history with a reputation for inducing comprehensive immune responses and longlasting immunity 22.

Our LVS ΔcapB-vectored vaccine platform offers several advantages including 1) low toxicity;
2) ability to express multiple antigens of target pathogens from two different sites (shuttle
plasmid and chromosome); 3) balanced immunogenicity – B-cell and T-cell (TH1 type); 4) ease
of administration by multiple routes (intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal, oral,
etc.); 5) no animal products in contrast to viral-vectored vaccines grown in cell culture; 6) no
need for adjuvant; 7) no pre-existing immunity as with adenoviruses; 8) low cost of manufacture
as extensive purification is not required, in contrast to RNA, protein/adjuvant and viral-vectored
vaccines; 9) ease of large scale manufacture via bacterial fermentation in simple broth culture;
and 10) after lyophilization, convenient storage and distribution at refrigerator temperatures.
These last three advantages are particularly important with respect to making a COVID-19
vaccine available rapidly and cheaply to the entire world’s population.

Safety is always a major consideration in vaccine development, especially so in the case of
replicating vaccines. In our vaccine’s favor, its much less attenuated parent (LVS) was already
considered safe enough to justify extensive testing in humans, including recently, and it has
demonstrated safety and immunogenicity 5,23-29. LVS has two major attenuating deletions and

several minor ones 30. As many as 60 million Russians were reportedly vaccinated against
tularemia with the original LVS strain 31, and over 5,000 laboratory workers in the United States
have been vaccinated with the modern version of LVS by scarification 5. Our further attenuation
of LVS by introduction of the capB mutation reduced its virulence in mice by the IN route by
>10,000-fold 9. Hence, rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 MN and other LVS ΔcapB-vectored vaccines are
anticipated to be exceedingly safe.

Correlates of protective immunity to COVID-19 are not well understood. Almost all of the
vaccines in development are centered on generating immunity to the S protein - especially
neutralizing antibody to this protein. However, neutralizing antibody alone may not be sufficient
for full protection; vaccines generating strong neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV were not necessarily highly protective, especially in ferrets, which exhibit SARS disease more
akin to that in humans 32,33. T-cell responses may be as or more important. T cell responses
were demonstrated to be required to protect against clinical disease in SARS-CoV challenged
mice and adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV specific CD4 or CD8 T-cells into immunodeficient
mice infected with SARS-CoV lead to rapid viral clearance and disease amelioration 34.

Our S protein vaccines were ineffective, likely due to suboptimal S protein immunogenicity,
reflected by the rapid decline of antibody titer in mice and the negligible antibody neutralization
titers in hamsters just before challenge (data not shown). Possibly, enhanced or alternative
expression of the S protein, for example display on the bacterial surface in addition to secretion,
would improve immunogenicity, as reported for the S protein of SARS-CoV 35. This would

allow immune responses to the S protein to contribute to the already substantial protective
efficacy provided by immune responses to the M and N proteins.

Our replicating bacterial vaccine expressing the M and N proteins has demonstrated safety and
efficacy in an animal model of severe COVID-19 disease. If its safety and efficacy is reproduced
in humans, the vaccine has potential to protect people from serious illness and death.
Considering the ease with which our vaccine can be manufactured, stored, and distributed, it has
the potential to play a major role in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby saving thousands
of lives and more rapidly restoring the world’s battered economy.

expression of rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 MN. Total bacterial lysates of 4 clones of rLVS
ΔcapB/SCoV2 MN (lanes 3-6, as indicated at the bottom of the lower panel) were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-SARS-CoV-1 guinea pig polyclonal antibody
(BEI Resources, NR-10361), which readily detected the full length MN (~ 75 kDa, less
abundant), indicated by blue asterisks to the right of the protein bands, and the highly abundant
breakdown product N (~ 46 kDa) protein, indicated by red asterisks to the right of the protein
bands. The anti-SARS-CoV-1 guinea pig polyclonal antibody also detected the N (red arrow and
asterisk) and S (green arrow and asterisk) proteins of SARS-CoV-1 (lanes 7 and 8), which served
as positive controls. V, LVS ΔcapB vector (lane 2). The sizes of the molecular weight markers
(M) are labeled to the left of the panels.

Fig. 2 Experimental schedule and weight loss after challenge. A. Experiment schedule.
Golden Syrian hamsters (8/group, ½ Female, ½ Male) were immunized ID or IN twice (Week 0
and 3) with rLVS ΔcapB/SCoV2 vaccines, singly and in combination (MN+SΔTM; MN+S1);
challenged IN 5 weeks later (Week 8) with 105 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USAWA1/2020 strain), and monitored closely for clinical signs of infection including weight loss.
Single vaccines expressed the S, SΔTM, S1, S2, S2E or MN proteins, as indicated. Control
animals were sham-immunized (PBS) or immunized with the vector (LVS ΔcapB) only. All
hamsters were assayed for oropharyngeal viral load at 1, 2, and 3 days post infection (dpi). Half
of the hamsters (n=4/group) were euthanized at 3 dpi for lung viral load analysis and half
(n=4/group) were monitored for weight loss for 7 days and euthanized at 7 dpi for lung
histopathology evaluation. B. Weight loss post infection. Data are mean % weight loss from 1
dpi. *P<0.05; P ≤0.01; ***, P<0.001; ****, P≤0.0001 comparing means on Day 7 post-challenge
by repeated measure (mixed) analysis of variance model. Sham vs. M-N: P<0.0001, ID route;
P<0.01, IN route.
