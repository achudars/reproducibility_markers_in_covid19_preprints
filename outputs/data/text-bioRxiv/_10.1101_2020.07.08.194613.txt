Abstract

25

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid multi-faceted response by the

26

scientific community, bringing researchers, health officials and industry together to address the

27

ongoing public health emergency. To meet this challenge, participants need an informed

28

approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-

29

CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment

30

laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given

31

the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it

32

is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23

33

commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction and

34

virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common

35

chemicals including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five

36

filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent,

37

permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment. In

38

addition to providing critical data informing inactivation methods and risk assessments for

39

diagnostic and research laboratories working with SARS-CoV-2, these data provide a framework

40

for other laboratories to validate their inactivation processes and to guide similar studies for other

41

pathogens.

Introduction
Infection with the novel human betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can cause a severe or fatal

45

respiratory disease, termed COVID-19 (1–3). As the COVID-19 pandemic has developed,

46

millions of clinical samples have been collected for diagnostic evaluation. SARS-CoV-2 has

47

been classified as a Hazard Group 3 pathogen in the UK, and as such, deliberate work with the

48

virus must be carried out in high containment laboratories (containment level 3 (CL3) in the UK)

49

with associated facility, equipment and staffing restrictions. Guidance from Public Health

50

England (PHE) and the World Health Organization (WHO) enable non-propagative testing of

51

clinical specimens to be carried out at the lower CL2, with the requirement that all non-

52

inactivated material is handled within a microbiological safety cabinet (MSC) and that the

53

process has been suitably and sufficiently risk assessed (4, 5). Guidance from the U.S. Centers

54

for Disease Control and Prevention requires that specimens must be inactivated (e.g. in nucleic

55

acid extraction buffer) before handling at biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) (6). To allow safe movement

56

of clinical samples from CL3/BSL-3 laboratories to CL2/BSL-2, virus inactivation procedures

57

should be validated, and formal validation of inactivation protocols are often an operational

58

requirement for clinical and research laboratories handling SARS-CoV-2.

59

Efficacy of virus inactivation depends on numerous factors, including the nature and

60

concentration of pathogen, sample matrix, concentration of inactivation agent/s and contact time.

61

To date, there are limited data on efficacy of SARS-CoV-2-specific inactivation approaches in

62

the scientific literature and risk assessments have largely been based upon inactivation

63

information for genetically related coronaviruses. Previous studies have found that treatment

64

with heat, chemical inactivants, ultraviolet light, gamma irradiation and a variety of detergents

65

are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus

66

(MERS-CoV), other high-consequence human coronaviruses (7–13). However, limited

67

validation data exist for coronavirus inactivation by commercial sample transport media and

68

molecular extraction lysis buffers used in steps prior to nucleic acid extraction for diagnostic

69

testing. Furthermore, the precise composition of many commercial reagents is proprietary,

70

preventing ingredient-based inference of inactivation efficacy between reagents. Some limited

71

preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation are available (14–19), but given the current level

72

of diagnostic and research activities, there is an urgent need to comprehensively investigate

73

SARS-CoV-2-specific inactivation efficacy of available methods to support safe virus handling.

74

An important consideration in inactivation assays is cytotoxicity, a typical effect of many

75

chemical inactivants. To mitigate cytotoxic effects, the inactivation agent needs to be either

76

diluted out or removed from treated samples prior to testing for infectious virus. Each of these

77

methods for addressing cytotoxicity present their own challenges. Sample dilution requires the

78

use of high titer stocks of virus (e.g. >108 PFU/mL) to be able to demonstrate a significant titer

79

reduction and reduces recovery of low level residual virus from treated samples, making it

80

difficult or impossible to distinguish complete from incomplete virus inactivation. In contrast,

81

methods for purification of virus away from cytotoxic components in treated samples may also

82

remove virus or affect virus viability. Accurate quantification of remaining infectious virus

83

ideally requires complete removal of cytotoxicity without compromising assay sensitivity, which

84

needs careful consideration of reagent and purification processes prior to performing inactivation

85

tests.

86

Here, we describe optimal methods for the removal of cytotoxicity from samples treated

87

with commercial reagents, detergents and fixatives. These data were then used in evaluations of

88

the effectiveness of these chemicals for inactivating SARS-CoV-2. This work, applicable to both

diagnostic and research laboratories, provides invaluable information for public health and basic

90

research responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting safe approaches for collection,

91

transport, extraction and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples. Furthermore, our studies

92

investigating purification of a wide range of cytotoxic chemicals are highly applicable to

93

inactivation studies for other viruses, thereby supporting rapid generation of inactivation data for

94

known and novel viral pathogens.

Materials and Methods

97

2.1.

Cells and virus

98

Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008; ATCC CRL-1586) were cultured in modified Eagle's

99

minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). Virus

100

used was SARS-CoV-2 strain hCOV-19/England/2/2020, isolated by PHE from the first patient

101

cluster in the UK on 29/01/2020. This virus was obtained at passage 1 and used for inactivation

102

studies at passage 2 or 3. All infectious work carried out using an MSCIII in a CL3 laboratory.

103

Working virus stocks were generated by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection

104

(MOI) of 0.001, in the presence of 5% FCS. Cell culture supernatants were collected 72 hours

105

post infection, clarified for 10 mins at 3000 × g, aliquoted and stored at -80°C until required.

106

Viral titers were calculated by either plaque assay or 50% tissue culture infectious dose

107

(TCID50). For plaque assays, 24-well plates were seeded the day before the assay (1.5 × 105

108

cells/well in MEM/10%FCS). Ten-fold dilutions of virus stock were inoculated onto plates

109

(100µL per well), inoculated at room temperature for 1 hour then overlaid with 1.5% medium

110

viscosity carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 3 days.

111

For TCID50s, ten-fold dilutions of virus stock (25µL) were plated onto 96-well plates containing

112

Vero E6 cell suspension (2.5 × 104 cells/well in 100µl MEM/5%FCS) and incubated at 37°C/5%

113

CO2 for 5-7 days. Plates were fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde/PBS, and stained with 0.2%

114

(v/v) crystal violet/water TCID50 titers were determined by the Spearman-Kärber method (20,

115

21).

141

assessed at the indicated concentrations. All methods were evaluated in a spin column format, for

142

ease of sample processing within the high containment laboratory. Pierce Detergent Removal

143

Spin Columns (0.5mL, Thermo Scientific), Microspin Sephacryl S400HR (GE Healthcare), and

144

Amicon Ultra-0.5mL 50KDa centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore) were prepared according to

145

manufacturer’s instructions. Sephadex LH-20 (GE Healthcare) and Bio-Beads SM2 resin (Bio-

146

Rad) were suspended in PBS and poured into empty 0.8mL Pierce centrifuge columns (Thermo

147

Scientific), and centrifuged for one min at 1000 × g to remove PBS immediately before use. For

148

all matrices aside from the Amicon Ultra columns, 100µl of treated sample was added to each

149

spin column, incubated for two mins at room temperature, then eluted by centrifugation at 1,000

150

× g for two mins. For Amicon Ultra filters, 500µl of sample was added, centrifuged at 14,000 × g

151

for 10 mins, followed by three washes with 500µl PBS. Sample was then collected by

152

resuspending contents of the filtration device with 500µl PBS. To assess remaining cytotoxicity,

153

a two-fold dilution series of treated filtered sample was prepared in PBS, and 6.5µl of each

154

dilution transferred in triplicate to 384-well plates containing Vero E6 cells (6.25 × 103 cells/well

155

in 25µl MEM/5%FCS) and incubated overnight. Cell viability was determined by CellTiter

156

Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to manufacturer’s

157

instructions. Normalized values of absorbance (relative to untreated cells) were used to fit a 4-

158

parameter equation to semilog plots of the concentration-response data, and to interpolate the

159

concentration that resulted in 80% cell viability (CC20) in reagent treated cells. All analyses

160

were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (v8.4.1, GraphPad Software).

163

For commercial products, virus preparations (tissue culture fluid, titers ranging from 1 ×

164

106 to 1 × 108 PFU/ml) were treated in triplicate with reagents at concentrations and for contact

165

times recommended in the manufacturers’ instructions for use, where available, or for

166

concentrations and times specifically requested by testing laboratories. Where a range of

167

concentrations was given by the manufacturer, the lowest ratio of product to sample was tested

168

(i.e. lowest recommended concentration of test product). Specimen transport tube reagents were

169

tested using a ratio of one volume of tissue culture fluid to ten volumes of reagent, unless a

170

volume ratio of sample fluid to reagent was specified by the manufacturer. Detergents, fixatives

171

and solvents were tested at the indicated concentrations for the indicated times. For testing of

172

alternative sample types, virus was spiked into the indicated sample matrix at a ratio of 1:9, then

173

treated with test reagents as above. All experiments included triplicate control mock-treated

174

samples with an equivalent volume of PBS in place of test reagent. Immediately following the

175

required contact time, 1mL of treated sample was processed using the appropriately selected

176

filtration matrix. Reagent removal for inactivation testing was carried out in a larger spin column

177

format using Pierce 4mL Detergent Removal Spin Columns (Thermo Fisher), or by filling empty

178

Pierce 10mL capacity centrifuge columns (Thermo Fisher) with SM2 Bio-Beads, Sephacryl S-

179

400HR or Sephadex LH-20 to give 4mL packed beads/resin. For purification using Amicon

180

filters, 2 × 500µl samples were purified using two centrifugal filters by the method previously

181

described, then pooled together. For formaldehyde and formaldehyde with glutaraldehyde

182

removal, one filter was used with 1× 500µl sample volume, resuspended after processing in

183

500µl PBS, and added to 400ul MEM/5% FBS. For inactivation of infected monolayers, 12.5

184

cm2 flasks of Vero E6 cells (2.5 × 106 cells/flask in 2.5mL MEM/5% FBS) were infected at MOI

185

SARS-CoV-2 quantification and titer reduction evaluation
Virus present in treated and purified, or mock-treated and purified, samples was

194

quantified by either TCID50 or plaque assay. As additional assay controls, unfiltered mock-

195

treated sample was titrated to determine virus loss during filtration, and filtered test-reagent only

196

(no virus) sample titrated to determine residual test buffer cytotoxicity. For TCID50 assays, neat

197

to 10-7 ten-fold dilutions were prepared, and for plaque assays, neat to 10-5 ten-fold dilutions

198

were prepared, both in MEM/5% FCS. TCID50 titers were determined by the Spearman-Kärber

199

method (20, 21). Conditions where low levels of virus were detected such that TCID50 could not

200

be calculated by Spearman-Kärber, TCID50 was calculated the Taylor method (22). Where no

201

virus was detectable, values are given as less than or equal to the Taylor-derived TCID50 titer

202

given by a single virus positive well at the lowest dilution where no cytotoxicity was observed.

203

Titer reduction was calculated by subtracting the mean logarithmic virus titer for test-buffer-

treated, purified conditions from the mean logarithmic virus titer for the PBS-treated, purified

205

condition, with standard errors calculated according to (22).

208

In parallel to virus quantification, 12.5 cm2 flasks of Vero E6 cells (6.25 × 104 cells/flask

209

in 2.5mL MEM/5% FBS) were inoculated with either 500µl or 50µl of treated filtered sample.

210

Flasks were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE) and 500µl culture medium from each flask

211

was used to inoculate new 12.5 cm2 flasks of Vero E6 cells after seven days. If no CPE was

212

observed, this process was continued for up to four serial passages. For the duration of the

213

passage series, a flask of untreated cells was included as a control for cross-contamination

214

between flasks, and a SARS-CoV-2 infected control was included to ensure suitable conditions

215

for virus propagation. To distinguish CPE from any residual cytotoxicity associated with test

216

reagents, samples of cell culture medium were taken from each flask at the beginning and end of

217

each passage. Nucleic acid was extracted from cell culture media manually using a QIAamp

218

Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) or using NucliSENS easyMAG or EMAG platforms (both

219

BioMérieux). Viral RNA levels were quantified by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-

220

PCR) specific for the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (23) using TaqMan Fast 1-Step Master Mix (Applied

221

Biosystems) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). A positive result for

222

virus amplification was recorded if effects on the monolayer consistent with CPE and a decrease

223

in Ct across the course of a passage were observed.

Reagent filtration optimization to minimize cytotoxicity and maximum virus

227

recovery

228

Prior to evaluating their effectiveness at inactivating SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the

229

cytotoxicity of each reagent before and after filtration though one of five matrices: Sephadex

230

LH-20, Sephacryl S400HR, Amicon Ultra 50kDa molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filters,

231

Pierce detergent removal spin columns (DRSC), and Bio-Beads SM2 nonpolar polystyrene

232

adsorbents. Reagents were diluted with PBS to the working concentrations recommended by the

233

manufacturer (for commercial sample transport and molecular extraction reagents), or the

234

indicated concentrations (for all other chemicals), followed by a single reagent removal step with

235

each filtration matrix. Dilution series of filtered and unfiltered samples were generated to

236

determine concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, from which the CC20 value for each

237

combination of reagent and filtration method were interpolated (Supplementary Figure 1). CC20

238

was chosen as, at this concentration, cells retain 80% viability and enable distinction of active

239

SARS-CoV-2 replication by visualisation of CPE in the monolayer. Table 1 shows the dilution

240

factor of reagent-treated sample required to achieve the CC20 after filtration, with <1 indicating

241

complete removal of cytotoxicity. These data were used to determine the relative cytotoxicity

242

removed by one filtration step for each combination of reagent and matrix (Figure 1A).

243

All unfiltered reagents tested here were cytotoxic, but the degree of cytotoxicity varied

244

considerably as did the optimal filtration matrix for each reagent. The detergent Tween 20 used

245

at 1% concentration was the least cytotoxic unfiltered, only requiring a dilution factor of 7.7 to

246

reach the CC20, although only the Bio-Bead SM2 filters were effective at removing all

247

cytotoxicity. The chemical fixative combination of 2% formaldehyde plus 1.5% glutaraldehyde

248

was the most cytotoxic unfiltered, requiring a dilution of over 4000 to reach the CC20, with only

249

the Amicon Ultra columns able to remove 100% of the cytotoxicity. However, for the majority

250

reagents (27/34) tested, filtration through at least one matrix type removed 100% of cytotoxicity

251

allowing neat eluate to be used directly in cell culture without further dilution. There were

252

several exceptions to this: DNA/RNA shield (maximum 99.4% cytotoxicity removal using

253

SM2); 40% GHCl (99.1% using Pierce DRSC); 4M GITC (99.7% using Pierce DRSC); MagNA

254

Pure (99.7% using SM2); AL buffer (87.4% using S400HR); Cobas Omni LYS (97.0% using

255

SM2); and NeuMoDx (93.4% using S400HR). For these reagents, filtered eluate was still

256

cytotoxic when used undiluted in cell culture. However, CC20 values indicated that this

257

remaining cytotoxicity would be removed by first or second (10-1 – 10-2) dilutions in the TCID50

258

assay allowing evaluation of titer reduction using these reagents with the caveat that the effective

259

assay limit of detection (LOD) would be higher. Passing treated samples through more than one

260

column, or increasing the depth of the resin/bead bed within the spin column can also improve

261

cytotoxicity removal for some reagents (unpublished data).

262

In addition to cytotoxicity removal, a successful filtration method must also purify virus

263

without adversely affecting titer or integrity. We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2 recovery after

264

each filtration method. Using an input titer of 1.35 × 106 TCID50/mL, triplicate purifications of

265

virus through Sephadex LH-20 or Pierce detergent removal spin columns resulted in recovery of

266

100% of input virus (Figure 1B). In contrast, the recoverable titer after one filtration through

267

Amicon Ultra filters was 2.13 × 105 TCID50/mL, an 85% reduction from input. Purification with

268

S400HR and Bio-Beads SM2 matrices resulted in recoverable titers of 1.08 × 106 TCID50/mL

269

and 8.99 × 105 TCID50/mL, a loss of 30% and 35% of input virus, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by specimen transport and molecular extraction reagents
Specimen transport tubes are designed to inactivate microorganisms present in clinical

273

specimens prior to sample transport, while preserving the integrity of nucleic acids for molecular

274

testing. If effective, these products have the potential to streamline SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic

275

processing in testing laboratories by eliminating the requirement for CL3 processing or, for

276

activities derogated to CL2, permitting processing outside an MSC. The BS EN 14476 standard

277

requires demonstration of a >4 log10 titer reduction for virucidal suspension tests (22), and we

278

were able to demonstrate a ≥4 log10 TCID50 titer reduction for all specimen transport media

279

evaluated in a tissue culture fluid matrix (Table 2). However, infectious virus remained

280

recoverable in treated samples after inactivation with most reagents tested (by either TCID50 or

281

blind passage). The exceptions to this were PrimeStore MTM and 4M GITC, from which no

282

residual virus was detectable by either TCID50 or by the passaging of treated purified sample.

283

While several contact times were evaluated for all these reagents, length of contact time had no

284

effect on either the level of virus titer reduction or whether virus remained detectable upon

285

passage.

286

We also sought to inform sample processing by examining inactivation by molecular

287

extraction lysis buffers used in several manual and automated extraction protocols within SARS-

288

CoV-2 diagnostic and research laboratories. We could demonstrate a ≥4 log10 reduction in

289

TCID50 titer for all but two molecular extraction reagents when evaluated using tissue culture

290

fluid (Table 3). The exceptions to this were AL and Cobas Omni LYS, where remaining

291

cytotoxicity in the filtered eluate increased the TCID50 LOD to a level such that the maximum

292

calculable titer reductions were ≥3.5 and ≥3.9 log10 TCID50s, respectively. However, given no

293

virus was detected at any passage it is likely that infectious virus was effectively inactivated by

14

294

these two reagents. For reagents tested with multiple contact times (NucliSENS, Panther Fusion),

295

shorter times (10 mins) were as effective at reducing virus titers as longer contact times. Most

296

reagents reduced viral titers to around the TCID50 assay LOD, indicating that any remaining

297

virus post treatment was present only at very low titers (<10 TCID50/mL), but higher levels of

298

virus were recoverable from samples treated with some extraction buffers. For NeuMoDx lysis

299

buffer, although titers were reduced by ≥4 log10 TCID50s, an average of 91 (±38) TCID50/mL

300

remained detectable. Similarly, Buffer AVL reduced virus titers by 5.1 log10 TCID50s, but after

301

treatment virus was detectable in all treated samples replicates (average 54 (±18) TCID50/mL).

302

However, addition of four sample volumes of absolute ethanol following a 10 minute contact

303

time with AVL (the next step in the QIAGEN Viral RNA Mini Kit manual), a ≥5.9 log10 titer

304

reduction was recorded with no virus recoverable following passages in cell culture.

305

Panther Fusion lysis buffer was further tested against a relevant clinical sample matrix,

306

pooled fluid from oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens, resulting in a

307

≥5.1 log10 titer with no remaining infectious virus detectable. We additionally evaluated the

308

tissue lysis buffer RLT using homogenised ferret lung as sample material, with treatment

309

resulting in a ≥4.8 log10 titer reduction with no residual infectious virus detectable.

3.3.

SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by detergents
Detergents can be used to inactivate lipid enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses by

313

disrupting the viral envelope, therefore rendering them unable to attach or enter cells (24–27).

314

Here, we evaluated Triton X-100, SDS, NP40 and Tween 20 for their ability to inactivate SARS-

315

CoV-2. SDS treatment at 0.1% or 0.5% reduced titers by ≥5.7 and ≥6.5 log10 TCID50s,

316

respectively, while both concentrations of NP40 reduced titers by ≥6.5 log10 TCID50 with no

15

317

residual virus detectable following NP40 treatment. In contrast, up to 0.5% Tween 20 had no

318

effect on viral titers. Triton X-100 is commonly used in viral inactivation reagents, and here we

319

show that at both 0.1% and 0.5% v/v concentration, virus titers in tissue culture fluid were

320

reduced by ≥4.9 log10 TCID50s, even with less than 2 min contact time (Table 4). Furthermore,

321

we were unable to recover infectious virus from samples treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10

322

mins or longer. We also saw effective inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by SDS, NP40 and Triton X-

323

100 in spiked NP and OP swab specimen fluid, but, importantly, we were not able to replicate

324

this in spiked serum; 1% Triton X-100 only reduced titers in human serum by a maximum of 2

325

log10 TCID50s with contact times of up to two hours.

326

In addition to evaluating inactivation efficacy by detergents, we assessed the effects of

327

treatment on RNA integrity to determine their suitability for inactivation prior to nucleic acid

328

testing. Extracted RNA from treated samples was tested using a SARS-CoV-2-specific qRT-

329

PCR, and the Ct difference between detergent-treated samples and mock-treated controls

330

determined (Table 4). A time-dependent increase in Ct value following treatment with 0.5%

331

Triton X-100 was observed, indicating a detrimental effect on RNA stability with increasing

332

treatment times. Treatment with NP40 had a marked effect, with a 30 minute treatment leading

333

to an increase in 9-10 Cts. While we saw no increase in Ct in tissue culture fluid samples treated

334

with 0.5% SDS, we observed an increase in Ct for SDS-treated swab fluid samples, likely due to

335

an increased concentration of RNases in clinical samples.

SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by other chemical treatments
Fixation and inactivation of viruses by addition of formaldehyde, or a combination of

formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, is a well-established protocol, particularly for diagnostic

340

electron microscopy (28, 29). 4% or 2% formaldehyde treatment for 15 or 60 mins reduced virus

341

titers by ≥4.8 log10 TCID50s when evaluated against a tissue culture fluid matrix, with no

342

remaining infectious virus detectable (Table 5). When infected monolayers were subjected to the

343

same treatment protocol, titer reductions were all ≥6.8 log10 TCID50s, with 60 min contact time

344

moderately more effective than 15 min. However, in this format, a 60 min 4% formaldehyde

345

treatment was the only one from which no infectious virus was detectable. A mixture of 2%

346

formaldehyde with 1.5% glutaraldehyde tested on infected monolayers reduced virus titers by

347

≥6.7 log10 TCID50s with no remaining infectious virus detectable for both a 15 and 60 min

348

contact time. Polyhexanide biguanide (PHMB) is a polymer used as a disinfectant and antiseptic,

349

evaluated here as a potential lysis buffer, but it was only able to reduce viral titers by 1.6 log10

350

TCID50s at the highest concentration tested (2%).

Discussion
Samples containing infectious SARS-CoV-2 require an initial inactivation step before

354

downstream processing; given the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2, these inactivation protocols

355

have been guided by existing data for other coronaviruses and there is an urgent need to both

356

confirm these historical data using the new virus and to validate new approaches for inactivating

357

SARS-CoV-2. We therefore analysed numerous commercially and commonly available reagents

358

used by public health agencies and research laboratories around the world in their response to the

359

pandemic. In addition, to address challenges of reagent cytotoxicity in inactivation evaluation,

360

we provide data on the effectiveness of filtration methods for removing cytotoxicity from

361

chemically treated samples.

362

Knowledge of the expected amount of infectious virus in clinical samples obtained from

363

COVID-19 patients is important when applying viral inactivation study data to diagnostic sample

364

processing, allowing end users to interpret whether material they are handling is likely to

365

represent an infectious risk to themselves and others. These values are dependent on several

366

factors, including time post symptom onset, duration of symptoms, time elapsed between

367

sampling and testing, the presence of neutralizing antibody responses, and immunocompetency

368

of the individual (30). Data regarding quantitative infectious viral levels in typical clinical

369

specimens are minimal, with most studies reporting viral loads determined by qRT-PCR only

370

(31–33). One study of 90 qRT-PCR positive NP or endotracheal (ETT) samples from COVID-19

371

patients estimated the median titer at 3.3 log10 TCID50/mL (30). Given we demonstrate >4 log10

372

reduction in titer for all specimen transport reagents, this suggests that these reagents may

373

considerably decrease, even eliminate, the infectivity of a clinical sample. However, our

374

observation that residual virus could be recovered from most treated samples indicates that these

18

375

media cannot be assumed to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in samples and that additional

376

precautionary measures should be taken in laboratories when it comes to sample handling and

377

transport.

378

Limited SARS-CoV-2 inactivation data on molecular extraction reagents used in nucleic

379

acid detection assays are currently available. One study reported that Buffer AVL either alone or

380

in combination with ethanol was not effective at completely inactivating SARS-CoV-2 (15). By

381

contrast, we could not recover any infectious virus from samples treated with AVL plus ethanol,

382

consistent with previous studies indicating that AVL and ethanol in combination is effective at

383

inactivating MERS and other enveloped viruses (10, 34), and indicating that both AVL and

384

ethanol steps of manual extraction procedures should be performed before removal of samples

385

from primary containment for additional assurance. Our detergent inactivation data, indicating

386

that SDS, Triton X-100 and NP40, but not Tween 20, can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in

387

tissue culture fluid and in pooled NP and OP swab fluid, corroborate findings of a recent study

388

(17); however, as has been demonstrated for other viruses (31), we observed an inhibitory effect

389

of serum on virus inactivation by detergent, highlighting the importance of validating

390

inactivation methods with different sample types.

391

Based on our findings comparing filtration matrices, we found that the optimum method

392

for reagent removal for inactivation studies is determined by evaluating three factors: (i)

393

effectiveness of cytotoxicity removal; (ii) efficiency of virus recovery; and (iii) the ease of

394

performing these methods within a containment space. Methods permitting complete removal of

395

cytotoxic reagent components with no or little effect on virus recovery give assurance that low

396

levels of residual virus, if present, could be detected in virus inactivation studies. During reagent

397

testing, there were several instances where we noted residual cytotoxicity in the neat eluate

19

398

contrary to what was expected based on the initial reagent removal data and is likely due to the

399

extended incubation period required for inactivation testing (up to 7 days, compared with

400

overnight for cytotoxicity evaluation). In all cases however, we were still able to enhance the

401

levels of titer reduction detectable when compared with what would have been achieved by

402

sample dilution alone.

403

In conclusion, we have evaluated methods for straightforward, rapid determination of

404

purification options for any reagent prior to inactivation testing, enabling establishment of

405

effective methods for sample purification while minimising virus loss. This is applicable to

406

inactivation studies for all viruses (known and novel), not only SARS-CoV-2. We have applied

407

these methods to obtain SARS-CoV-2 inactivation data for a wide range of reagents in use (or

408

proposed for use) in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and research laboratories. In addition to guiding

409

laboratory risk assessments, this information enables laboratories to assess alternative reagents

410

that may be used for virus inactivation and nucleic acid extraction, particularly considering

411

concerns about extraction reagent availability due to increased global demand caused by the

412

COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, chemical treatments evaluated here are commonly used for

413

inactivation of a wide range of different viruses and other pathogens, and the results presented

414

may be used to directly inform and improve the design of future inactivation studies.

Figure 1: Effectiveness of five filtration matrices at removing cytotoxicity. (A) SARS-CoV-2
virus in clarified cell culture supernatant was treated with indicated reagent for 2mins at room
temperature before being purified through one of 5 filtration matrices: Sephadex LH-20 (blue);
Sephacryl S400HR (orange); Amicon Ultra 50kDa molecular weight cut off (red); Pierce
detergent removal spin columns (DRSC) (purple); or Bio-Bead SM2 (green). Values indicate the
percentage toxicity removal after one purification cycle relative to unpurified samples (based on
CC20 values – for more details see Table 1). (B) Percentage of input virus remaining in eluate
after one purification cycle through each filtration matrix. GHCl - guanidine hydrochloride;
GITC - guanidinium isothiocyanate; Tx – Triton X-100; PHMB - polyhexamethylene biguanide;
SDS - sodium dodecyl sulfate; NP40 - nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol. LB – lysis buffer; TM
– transport medium

Supplementary Figure 1: Cytotoxicity of virus inactivation reagents after passing through
purification matrices. Concentration-response curves in Vero cells treated with a 2-fold serial
dilution of reagent. At 24 h post treatment cell viability was determined, with values normalized
to mock treated cells. Each point represents the mean of triplicate wells, with error bars
indicating standard deviation. Graphs are representative of at least 2 independent experiments.
Matrices used: Sephadex LH-20 (blue); Sephacryl S400HR (orange); Amicon Ultra 50kDa
molecular weight cut off (red); Pierce detergent removal spin columns (DRSC) (purple); or BioBead SM2 (green). (A) Reagents used in specimen transport tubes: GHCl - guanidine
hydrochloride; GITC - guanidinium isothiocyanate; Tx – Triton X-100; TM – Transport Medium
(B) Reagents used in molecular extraction protocols: PHMB - polyhexamethylene biguanide. (C)
Detergents commonly used for virus inactivation: SDS - sodium dodecyl sulfate; NP40 - nonyl
phenoxypolyethoxylethanol. (D) Other reagents commonly used for virus inactivation.
