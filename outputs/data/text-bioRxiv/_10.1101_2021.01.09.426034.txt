Abstract (248)
Double stranded RNA is generated during viral replication. The synthetic analogue poly I:C is
frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and
neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinson’s disease and
Alzheimer’s disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these
responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore
fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and
integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of
different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C
(1-6kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNFa
responses than poly I:C of <500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with
higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFNb nor brain transcription of Irf7
were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain
IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFNb binding of IFNAR1.
In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1b and IFN-I in the plasma and similar
exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits
selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent
effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS
symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of
maternal immune activation.

Introduction
Systemic viral infection may have multiple adverse outcomes for the developing and the
degenerating brain as well as producing changes in mood, behaviour and cognitive function even
in normal individuals. A burgeoning field of neuroscience is now investigating several processes
related to the impact of viral infection on brain function and this has become particularly pressing
in the light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of 2019-2021. Although some laboratories employ
active infection with specific viruses, the majority studying CNS effects use the synthetic double
stranded RNA (dsRNA) analogue poly I:C, since dsRNA is generated intracellularly during
replication of dsRNA, positive sense RNA (+ssRNA) and DNA viruses (Weber et al., 2006). Poly
I:C activates the immune system by signalling through toll-like receptor (Alexopoulou et al., 2001)
and RIG-I like (RLR) receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 (Kato et al., 2008), which can induce
both NFkB and IRF3, with these transcription factors up-regulating production of type 1
interferons (IFN-I), other cytokines and dendritic cell maturation (Takeuchi et al., 2004; Stetson &
Medzhitov, 2006; Gurtler & Bowie, 2013).
The behavioral and neuroinflammatory response to systemic poly I:C challenge includes
hypolocomotion, reduction in species-typical behaviours and body weight and a biphasic febrile
response accompanied by marked increases in peripheral and CNS pro-inflammatory cytokine
expression (IFN-β, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β) peaking at approximately 3h post treatment
(Cunningham et al., 2007; Konat et al., 2009). IL-1b is a mediator of the fever response to poly
I:C in rats (Fortier et al., 2004) while studies using mice lacking the type I interferon receptor
IFNAR1 indicate an interdependent relationship between type 1 interferons (IFN-I) and IL-6 in
mediating reduced activity during sickness (Murray et al., 2015). More recent studies have
indicated that IFNAR1, specifically in endothelial and epithelial barriers, is essential for mediating
the sickness behavior response to poly I:C and that CXCL10 is a key brain mediator of these
effects (Blank et al., 2016).
Systemically applied poly I:C has also been widely used to induce ‘maternal immune activation”
in order to mimic systemic infection during pregnancy for the purposes of investigating deleterious
phenotypes such as autism-like and schizophrenia-like symptoms in the offspring (Shi et al.,
2003) and this approach has now been widely adopted (Meyer, 2014), with researchers
investigating brain inflammatory, behavioural, transcriptomic and white matter changes (Garay et
al., 2013; Crum et al., 2017; Richetto et al., 2017; Murray et al., 2019). Those studies aim to
activate the innate immune response in a manner that mimics viral infection, but the nature of the

innate immune response is often not verified, instead relying on previously published reports.
However, there is significant variability in outcomes in MIA models and there is evidence from the
immunology literature that responses to poly I:C are dependent on the source, length and
molecular weight of the poly I:C used (Mian et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2013). Recent studies partly
characterised variable immune responses to different poly I:C preparations (Careaga et al., 2018;
Mueller et al., 2019) but no study to date has examined the ability of different preparations to
induce type I interferon responses despite the dominant role of these cytokines in the anti-viral
response (Stetson & Medzhitov, 2006).
The importance of understanding CNS impacts of anti-viral innate immune responses has
recently been given new impetus by the seismic impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on healthcare, science
and society. Patients with mild symptoms include typical sickness behaviors (Eyre et al., 2020),
while more deleterious neurological effects of the novel coronavirus have also been reported
(Paterson et al., 2020). In particular, confusion or delirium was present in approximately 25% of
all patients in a study of 20K+ patients (Docherty et al., 2020) and older patients more often show
delirium as the initial presenting symptom (Kennedy et al., 2020; Poloni et al., 2020). The use of
systemic poly I:C in older animals allows interrogation of the extent to which older individuals are
more susceptible to CNS effects of systemic anti-viral responses in the absence of viable viral
infection of the brain.
We hypothesized that different poly I:C preparations would produce markedly different innate
immune and anti-viral inflammatory activation in periphery and brain and we thus performed a
detailed analysis of innate immune responses to different dsRNA preparations. Since IFN-I is the
prototypical anti-viral cytokine and an important contributor to poly I:C-induced sickness
responses (Murray et al., 2015; Blank et al., 2016), we focussed particularly on the IFN-I pathway
in normal and IFNAR1-/- mice and also assessed the extent to which these responses were altered
in aged animals and whether these lead to new cognitive sequalae. The data described herein
have significant implications for understanding the CNS consequences of systemic anti-viral
responses.

Methods

Animals
All procedures involving mice were performed in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 566
of 2002 (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876) and performed, after institutional ethical
review, under licence from the Department of Health and Children, Republic of Ireland and the
Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA). C57BL/6J mice were sourced from an in-house,
inbred, colony and later compared with C57BL/6J mice purchased from Harlan UK. These mice
were housed in a 12h/12h light/dark cycle, in a specific pathogen free animal unit. Food and water
were provided ad libitum.
Treatments
Poly I:C was sourced from Sigma (Poole, UK), Amersham (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK)
and Invivogen (Toulouse, France). Because the proportionate content of polymer varies between
suppliers and also from lot to lot, poly I:C was initially prepared according to manufacturers
instructions with equalisation of final injected concentrations but not ‘equalisation’ of stock solution
concentration across different preparations. Stock solutions were as follows: Amersham (2 mg/ml),
Sigma (10 mg/ml), Invivogen LMW (20 mg/ml) and Invivogen HMW (1 mg/ml), including
potassium salts. Lot numbers are shown in Table 1. Poly I:C solutions, prepared with sterile saline,
were mixed well and heated to 50oC (or 65-70oC in the case of Invivogen high molecular weight
poly I:C) in order to solubilize and melt dsRNA and then cooled to room-temperature to allow reannealing before freezing in 1 ml aliquots and storing at -20 oC. Concentration of double stranded
poly I:C was then calculated by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop) before use and subsequently
diluted to the appropriate concentration (stated as concentration of poly I:C (0.5 mg/ml), excluding
salt).
Endotoxin contamination was quantified using Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) chromogenic kit
(Thermo Scientific, UK). The plate was heated to 37°C for 10 minutes (10min) following which
endotoxin standards (serially diluted: 1EU/ml, 0.5EU/ml, 0.25EU/ml, 0.1EU/ml and 0EU/ml) and
samples were added in duplicate (25 ul). The plates were then incubated at 37°C for 5min and
the LAL lysate was added to each well (25ul). Following further 10 min incubation at 37°C the
chromogenic substrate was added to each well (50ul). After 6min incubation at 37°C a 25% acetic
acid stop solution was added to each well and chemi-luminescence was read at 405 nm.

Preparations of poly I:C from different commercial sources were analysed by agarose gel
electrophoresis in order to determine the RNA length i.e. the molecular weight. This included five
different poly I:C preparations, two from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK) and one from Amersham, of
unknown molecular weight, one from Invivogen of high molecular weight (HMW) (1.5 kb – 8 kb)
and one from Invivogen of low molecular weight (LMW) (0.2 kb – 1 kb). An RNA concentration
was determined using A260/A280 nm using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. Optimal
parameters for gel electrophoresis encompassing a large range of RNA sizes were: 0.5% agarose
gel with 15 µg of sample per lane, with visualisation using GELREDTM. Agarose gel was made by
mixing agarose (1 g) with 200 ml of Tris-Borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer
(TBE) heating to a boil in a microwave before adding GELREDTM (15 µL), pouring and inserting
the well comb. The set gel was then placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which was then filled
with 1X TBE buffer and the wells loaded with amounts of between 0.1 µg and 1 µg poly I:C, with
low molecular weight samples requiring loading of higher concentrations to ensure clear
visualisation with GELREDTM. (prepared with 4 µL loading buffer and made up to 24 µL with sterile
saline). BenchTop 100bp DNA ladder (Promega) and HyperLadderTM 1000bp (Bioline) were
loaded for reference. The gel was run at 100V for approximately 60 minutes, captured and
analysed by exposure for 1/30th using an LAS-3000 Imaging System (Fuji).
Sickness behaviour & Working memory
Body temperature
Core body temperature was measured using a thermocouple rectal probe (Thermalert TH5,
Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA). In the time-course analysis, just prior to euthanasia temperatures
were recorded for each animal at 30min, 1h, 2h, 3h and 5h post-treatment with poly I:C.
Open field activity
Open field activity was assessed using s Benwick Electronics (AM1051) activity monitor in
Perspex arena of 32 x 20 x 18 cm (height). Each activity monitor ia equipped with two sets of
horizontal infra-red beams at 3 an 7 cm above the base. The beans consist of a 12 beam x 7
beam matrix, forming a grid of 66 x 2.54 cm2 cells and data for all beams were logged as unbroken
or broken, resulting in data expressed as number of lower and number of upper beam breaks.
Lower, mobile, beam breaks are used as a measure of locomotion while upper beam breaks are
used to assess rears, a measure of purposeful exploratory activity. For all open field locomotor
activity experiments, mice were moved from the housing room and left in the test room for 10-15

minutes prior to beginning the task to ensure an optimal state of arousal. Animals were measured
for 10 minutes after placing in the middle of the open field, 3 hours post-challenge with saline or
poly I:C. This time post-poly I:C, IS appropriate to capture the acute effect of poly I:C on locomotor
activity (Murray et al., 2015). Separate cohorts of mice were tested in the open field and T maze
analyses.
T-maze alternation: working memory
Hippocampal-dependent working memory was assessed as previously described in our “paddling”
T-maze alternation task (Murray et al., 2015). Each mouse was placed in the start arm of the
maze with one arm blocked by a guillotine style door so that they were forced to make a left (or
right) turn to exit the maze, selected in a pseudorandom sequence (equal number of left and right
turns, no more than 2 consecutively to the same arm). The mouse was held in a holding cage for
25 s (intra-trial interval) during which time the guillotine style door was removed, and the exit tube
was switched to the alternate arm. The mouse was then replaced in the start arm and could
choose either arm. Alternation from its original turn on the choice run constitutes a correct trial,
meaning that 100% alternation constitutes perfect responding in this maze. On choosing
incorrectly, the mice were then allowed to self-correct to find the correct exit arm. Animals were
trained in blocks of 10 trials (20 min inter-trial interval) over a period of 2 weeks until reaching
performance criterion: most animals reached an alternation of ≥80% but no animals were
challenged with poly I:C or saline unless they showed consecutive days performing at 70% or
above, showed no evidence of a side preference and did not score ≤80% in the last block of five
trials before challenge. Animals were then tested 15 times over 6 hours between 3-9 hours postpoly I:C.
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA)
IL-6 & TNFα
ELISA plates (96-well; NUNC, Denmark) were incubated overnight at room temperature with
capture antibody (R&D Systems, UK). Plates were washed 3 times by adding and removing 300
μl of wash buffer to each well (PBS + 0.05%Tween-20; Sigma, UK) and incubated for 1 hour
with blocking buffer (Reagent Diluent, R&D Systems, UK). Plates were washed 3 times with wash
buffer and 100 ul of samples and standards were added (R&D Systems, UK). Plates were left to
incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer and then

Amsterdam, dilution in High Performance ELISA Buffer, HPE, Sanquin, Amsterdam). Plates were
washed and 100 ul of substrate solution, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma) was added to each
well. Plates were stored in the dark for 20-30 minutes or until the colour reaction developed. The
colour reaction was stopped using 50 ul per well of stop solution (H2SO4 1M). Absorbance was
read at 450 nm and 570 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Labsystem Multiskan RC, UK). The
readings at 570 nm were subtracted from the readings at 450 nm. A standard curve was plotted
using the log of the concentrations of the standards and their relative absorbance intensities.
Protein concentrations of samples were determined by reading their relative absorbance intensity
from the standard curve.
IFNβ
ELISA plates (Biosciences, UK) came pre-coated with capture antibody. Samples and standards
(100 ul) were added in duplicate, at least. Plates were left to incubate at room temperature for 1
hour. Plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer and then incubated for 1 hour at room
temperature with 200ul of detection antibody (Biosciences, UK). Plates were washed and
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin
(strep-HRP; IFNβ: 1:285 strep-HRP dilution in Concentrate Diluent, Biosciences, UK). Plates
were washed and 100 ul of substrate solution, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; IFNβ: Biosciences,

Analysis of mRNA by quantitative PCR
RNA Extraction
Tissue was weighed and homogenised in lysis Buffer (600 μl; Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini, RLT
containing GITC RNase inhibitor) and β-mercapoethanol (10 μl/ml; Sigma, UK). Homogenised
samples were filtered through Qiashredder to further homogenise tissue (Qiagen, UK) and
centrifuged (11,000g; 6minutes). The Qiashredder filter units were then discarded and the
supernatant was put through a genomic DNA eliminator filter and centrifuged (11,000 g; 30
seconds). The filter was discarded and 70% ethanol (350 µl; ETOH, prepared using RNase free
H2O; both Sigma, UK) was added to the homogenized lysate. Qiagen RNeasy filters, which bind
the RNA, were placed in new 2 ml centrifuge tubes, the lysate was loaded and the samples were
centrifuged (11,000 g; 15 seconds) and the flow through was discarded. The columns were placed
in new collecting tubes and RW1 Buffer was applied (350 µl; Qiagen, UK), the samples were then
centrifuged (11,000 g; 15 seconds). In order to digest the DNA, rDNase Reaction Mixture (80µl;
10 µl rDNase + 70µl RDD buffer per sample; Qiagen, UK) was added directly to the centre of the
silica membrane of the column and left at room temperature for 15 minutes. The silica membrane
was washed by adding RW1 buffer (350 μl) and centrifuged (11,000 g; 30 seconds), and flow
through discarded. RPE buffer (500 µl) was added to the filters and centrifuged (11,000 g; 15
seconds). RPE buffer (500μl) was again added to the filter and centrifuged (11,000g; 2 minutes).
The column was placed in a new collecting tube and centrifuged to eliminate any carryover of
RPE buffer. (11,000 g; 1 minute). The filter was placed in a new pre-labelled nuclease free 1.5 ml
collection tube. The RNA was eluted using RNase free H2O (30 µl) and centrifuged (11,000 g; 1
minute) and the filters discarded. RNA concentration was quantified using the Nanodrop
Spectrophotometer ND-1000.

Reverse transcription for cDNA Synthesis
RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using high-capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied
Biosystems, US). The master mix was prepared from the components of the high-capacity cDNA
archive kit (10X Reverse transcription buffer; 25X dNTPs; 10X RT random primers; MultiScribe
reverse transcriptase (50 U/uL); RNase free H2O) the amounts of which were scaled depending
on how much cDNA was needed. The Mastermix was then kept on ice. Isolated RNA was
equalised to 400ng/20μl with RNase free H2O. Mastermix and equalised RNA were added in a
1:1 ratio. The appropriate quantity of Mastermix was added to each PCR tube and the same
quantity of RNA was added. The contents were mixed by pipetting up and down and placed in
the mini centrifuge to eliminate any bubbles and then placed in the thermal cycler (10 minutes at
25ºC; 120 minutes 37ºC; 5minutes 85°C). cDNA was stored at 4ºC until needed.
Quantitative PCR
Mastermix was prepared using forward and reverse primers (Sigma, UK) and where possible a
labelled probe for each gene (Table 1). For each gene the specific forward and reverse primers
and probe were combined with Fast Start Universal Probe Master (Rox) Mastermix (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) and RNase free H2O (Sigma, UK). In the absence of a specific
probe, Fast Start Universal SYBR Green Master (Rox) Mastermix was used (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Germany). The finished Mastermix was added to each well of a PCR plate (24μl per well)
and the cDNA was added to the Mastermix (1μl per well). The plate was run as a relative
quantitative plate with the correct detectors selected using 7500 Fast System V1.3.1. The run
contains 40 cycles (45 for IL-6) with the following conditions: stage 1, 50ºC for 2 minutes; stage
2, 95ºC for 10 minutes; stage 3, 95ºC for 15 seconds and; stage 4, 60ºC for 1 minute. Following
the 40 cycles the plate can be removed and the data analysed using 7500 Fast system V1.3.1
relative quantitative study. A standardised control at a protein concentration of 1600ng/20ul was
included on the plate in 1:4 dilutions that produced a linear amplification plot to which samples
were calibrated. This control was produced using brain tissue from an animal treated IP with a
high dose of the inflammatory agent LPS. This induces a strong up-regulation of inflammatory
genes in all tissues. The first gene to be analysed was GAPDH and all other genes were analysed
as a ratio of this genes’ expression in arbitrary units.

Immunohistochemistry
Animals were euthanized using sodium pentobarbital (~200μl i.p, Euthatal, Merial Animal Health,
Essex, UK) and transcardially perfused with saline containing 1% heparin for 3min and then with
10% formalin for 15min to fix the tissue. The brains were then removed and post-fixed in 7ml
sterilin tubes over 2 days in 10% formalin, stored thereafter in PBS and wax embedded. Brains
were placed in plastic cassettes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dublin, Ireland) and transferred to a
container of 70% alcohol for 20 minutes to begin the dehydration process. This was followed by
1.5 hourly changes in alcohol of successively increasing concentration: (70%, 80%, 95%, 100%).
Cassettes were then placed in 100% alcohol III overnight. The following day cassettes went
through two five hour periods in the clearing agent Histoclear II (National Diagnostics, Manville,

put through two changes of molten paraffin wax (McCormick Scientific, St Louis, MO, USA),
heated to 60°C, each for 2 hours. Embedding moulds were filled with wax, placed on a cooling
stage and brains were removed from their cassettes and placed in the mould. Cassettes were
placed on top of the mould and more wax was placed on top. The wax was allowed to solidify on
a cooling stage. Coronal sections (10 μm) of brains were cut on a Leica RM2235 Rotary
Microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at the level of the hippocampus and floated
onto electrostatically charged slides (Menzel-Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany) and dried at 37°C
overnight. Sections (10µM) of fixed tissue were dewaxed and hydrated using serial xylene,
followed by histoclear and then ethanol in decreasing concentrations. The endogenous
peroxidase was blocked by the quenching the tissue in 1% H2O2 Methanol and followed by

antigen retrieval using citrate buffer under heat and pepsin (0.04%) digestion. Primary antibody
for CXCL10 (Peprotech 1:10,000) was incubated at 4 degrees overnight in 10% normal goat
serum. Secondary goat anti-rabbit (Vector, Peterborough, UK, 1:100) was incubated at room
temperature as well the following signal amplifier step with ABC (Vector, 1:125). PBS wash steps
were used in between each step. For final reaction the slides were placed in DAB solution and
monitored by periodically checking the staining under the microscope. Finally the tissue was
counterstained using haematoxylin, dehydrated and the slides were coverslipped using DPX
mounting media.
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) except where indicated. Ttest, One-way and Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to analyse data. Posthoc analyses were performed using the Bonferroni multiple comparison test. The statistical
package 'Graph Pad Prism' was used to complete all statistical analysis, (GraphPad Prism v9.0.0;
GraphPad software, US).

Results
Different preparations of poly I:C have different effects on C57BL6J mice.
Establishing the Maternal Immune activation (MIA) model of schizophrenia in our laboratory,
using prior dose indications from other laboratories (20 mg/Kg i.p. Smith et al., 2007), we dosed
pregnant C57BL6 dams with poly I:C at 20 mg/kg. Our prior characterisation of cytokine induction
following systemic poly I:C treatment is one of the more widely cited accounts of innate immune
activation (Cunningham et al., 2007) and we initially used the same poly I:C preparation that we
used in those studies (i.e. that from Amersham). Using this preparation we were unable to deliver
any viable offspring. Progressive reduction of the dose from 20 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg failed to prevent
abortion of whole litters. Treatment, instead, with Sigma preparations of poly I:C, lead to full and
healthy litters (Table 2). These preparations of poly I:C are thus likely profoundly different in their
activation of innate immunity. In order to compare the potency of preparations of poly I:C from
Amersham and Sigma we assessed their ability to induce sickness behaviour and proinflammatory cytokine responses at a dose of 12 mg/kg in adult female mice, which was that
previously used in our laboratory to induce such changes. Locomotion and exploration were
measured, at 2h 50min post-treatment, as the number of lower horizontal mobile beam breaks
(Fig 1a) and as the number of rears, or higher horizontal beam breaks, respectively (Fig 1b).

Treatment with 12 mg/kg Amersham poly I:C caused a reduction in locomotion and exploration
that is not seen in response to 12 mg/kg Sigma poly I:C. One-way ANOVA showed a significant
difference between treatment groups for locomotion (F=5.368, df 2,11, p=0.0236) and exploration
(F=7.899, df 2,10, p<0.0088) and Bonferroni post-hoc analysis confirmed a significant decrease
in activity and rearing in animals treated with 12 mg/kg Amersham poly I:C compared to animals
treated with both Saline and 12 mg/kg Sigma poly I:C, who showed no change in activity.
ELISAs were performed for IL-6 (1c), TNFα (1d), and IFNβ (1e) on plasma from blood collected
at 3h post-treatment. Treatment with 12 mg/kg Amersham poly I:C produced significantly greater
induction of all three pro-inflammatory cytokines than treatment with 12 mg/kg Sigma poly I:C.
One-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between treatment groups for IFN-β, IL-6 and
TNF-α (F≥11.67, df 2,15, p≤0.0009). Bonferroni post-hoc analysis confirmed a significant
elevation in all three cytokines following treatment with 12 mg/kg Amersham Poly I:C compared
to animals treated with and 12 mg/kg Sigma Poly I:C.
Innate immune responses are determined by molecular weight of poly I:C
Hypothesising that these fundamentally different innate immune responses were underpinned by
a difference in length of double stranded RNA (poly I:C) we repeated this comparison, but now
included poly I:C preparations with known approximate molecular weights (Invivogen) and also
assessing whether the differences in circulating cytokines were also borne out in the brain.
Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1b, IL-6, TNFα and IFNβ were assessed in blood plasma
collected 3h post-treatment with saline, and 4 preparations of poly I:C (20mg/kg): Amersham,
Sigma, Invivogen High molecular weight (HMW) and Invivogen low MW (LMW) (Fig. 2a). HMW
poly I:C at doses of 20mg/kg produced systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that were
much greater than those induced by low molecular weight poly I:C (Figure 2a, individual cytokines
labelled therein). One-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between treatment groups for
IL-1β (F=6.271, df 4,17 p=0.0027), IL-6 (F=10.96, df 4,18 p=0.0001), TNF-α (F=8.393, df 4,18
p=0.0005) and IFN-β (F=19.50, df 4,18 p<0.0001). In all cases, Amersham poly I:C was not
significantly different to HMW poly I:C. IL-1β levels were significantly greater in the Amersham
poly I:C and Invivogen HMW poly I:C groups compared to saline and Sigma poly I:C. Differences
were even more striking for the other 3 cytokines. At 3 hours TNF-a was only detectable after
Amersham and Invivogen HMW poly I:C and these treatments also induced large and comparable
increases in IFN-β that were 30-100 fold higher than those present in Sigma and LMW Invivogen

poly I:C-treated animals. IL-6 levels were 10-fold greater in Amersham vs. Sigma preparations
and 4 fold greater in HMW vs. LMW (Bonferroni post-hoc analysis in figure legend 2).
Transcripts for inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were assessed in the same animals
to compare peripheral and central responses (Fig. 2b). Quantitative PCR was performed for Il1b,
Il6, Tnfa and Ifnb on cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from dissected hippocampus. All poly
I:C preparations produced increases in mRNA induction for Il6, Tnfa and Ifnb but variable and
limited induction of Il1b mRNA was seen. The large inductions seen in the plasma, that differed
markedly dependent by different poly I:C preparations, were not obvious in the hippocampus.
One-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between treatment groups for Il6 (F=3.455, df
4,20, p=0.0266) and Tnfa (F=4.153, df 4,19, p=0.0139), no significant differences were seen for
Il1b (F=1.674, df 4,18, p=0.1997). Thus, despite wide divergence between HMW and LMW poly
I:C in the production of systemic cytokine synthesis, all cytokines were approximately equal in the
hippocampus following treatment with all 4 poly I:C preparations.
The different inflammatory potencies observed with Amersham and Sigma poly I:C preparations,
appeared to align to with the differences between HMW and LMW preparations. Therefore poly
I:C preparations were run in a 0.5% agarose gel to assess their molecular weights. This agarose
gel comparison (Fig. 2c) confirmed the predicted differences in molecular weight: Amersham poly
I:C ran as a smear between 1000 and 6000 bp, centred on approximately 5000 bp, very similar
to that observed for invivogen HMW. Two different preparations of Sigma poly I:C ran at
approximately 400 bp and 300 bp, similar to that shown by Invivogen LMW. This confirms that
Sigma and Amersham preparations of poly I:C are fundamentally different in length: Amersham
is HMW and at least these two Sigma preparations are LMW. We also assessed endotoxin
contamination using LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation. Sigma poly I:C showed
detectable levels of endotoxin contamination (36 EU/ml) while all other samples showed
negligible levels (0.4-0.6 EU/ml; data not shown). Therefore endotoxin contamination does not
contribute meaningfully to differential potency of different preparations used here.
Robust Sickness behaviour but limited IFNb is achieved at higher doses of LMW poly I:C
Since Sigma poly I:C was ineffective at inducing sickness behaviour at 12 mg/kg and at producing
TNF-a and IFNb at 20 mg/kg we assessed whether this relative unresponsiveness to LMW poly
I:C could be overcome at significantly higher poly I:C doses. We challenged animals at 40 and 80
mg/kg poly I:C (Sigma) and compared these to 20 mg/kg poly I:C from Amersham, assessing
sickness behaviour, circulating IL-6, TNFα, and IFN-β and liver transcription of the same cytokines.

LMW poly I:C induces sickness behaviour responses that are even more robust than HMW poly
I:C if administered at sufficiently high doses (Fig. 3a). All poly I:C treatments produced significant
decreases in locomotor activity and rearing (after a significant one-way ANOVA, all treatments
were p<0.001 vs saline by Bonferroni post-hoc tests). Moreover, LMW at 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg
produced suppression of locomotion and rearing activity that was significantly greater than
Amersham poly I:C at 20 mg/kg (p<0.01 for activity and p<0.05 for rears).
Analysis of circulating cytokines (Fig. 3b) showed that levels of IFNb remain at very low levels
even with these highly sickness-inducing doses of Sigma poly I:C. After a one-way ANOVA
(F=20.75, df 3,13 p<0.0001) only Amersham poly I:C showed significant elevation of IFNb and
levels were more than 15 fold higher than those induced by 80 mg/kg Sigma poly I:C. TNFa
showed a similar trend (F=146.7, df 3,13, p<0.0001) with very high levels observed only with
Amersham poly I:C, although levels induced by 80 mg/kg Sigma were now statistically
significantly different from saline, albeit still 8 fold lower than Amersham poly I:C.
IL-6 was quite distinct from this profile (F=146.7, df 3,13, p<0.0001). There was a clear doseresponse relationship between Sigma poly I:C dose and circulating IL-6 with levels after 80 mg/kg
now statistically significantly higher than all other groups (p<0.05 with respect to Amersham poly
I:C; Figure 3b).
Comparing these levels to liver transcription of the genes for these cytokines proved quite
consistent with the circulating measures. Similarly to the systemic response 20mg/kg Amersham
poly I:C induced robust induction of IFN-β and TNF-α mRNA that was not seen following treatment
with either 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg Sigma poly I:C (Figure 3c). One-way ANOVA showed significant
differences between treatment groups for IFN-β (F=10.60, df 3,13, p=0.0008) and TNF-α
(F=19.81, df 3,13, p<0.0001) and Bonferroni post-hoc analysis showed that Amersham>Sigma
80 mg/kg (p<0.01 for IFNb and p<0.001 for TNFa). However, the 80 mg/kg dose of Sigma poly
I:C induced very robust increases in hepatic IL-6 mRNA transcription, which were not significantly
different from those induced by Amersham poly I:C (F=7.032, df 3,13, p<0.0047). The pattern of
pro-inflammatory cytokine induction seen in the blood is quite well reflected in liver proinflammatory cytokine gene transcription.

Time course analysis of innate responses to poly I:C of different MWs.
Given the robust sickness responses to high dose LMW poly I:C we sought to assess whether
the 3h time point used for previous analysis of innate immune responses might have missed
increases in some analytes with LMW poly I:C. Therefore we compared 80 mg/kg LMW poly I:C
to 20 mg/kg HMW poly I:C at 30, 60, 120, 180 and 300 minutes post-challenge.
a) Plasma cytokines. All cytokines were increased in time-dependent fashion (main effects of time
and treatment by one way ANOVA analysis for all analytes) and we present selected Bonferroni
post-hoc results. IL-6 was significantly higher with LMW poly I:C but shared a very similar time
course with HMW, barely increasing at 60 minutes and peaking at 120 minutes but remaining
high at 180 minutes before largely resolving by 300 minutes (LMW > HMW at 120 & 180 min,
Bonferroni p<0.0001 ****). TNF-a showed a different time course: LMW poly I:C TNF-a was
markedly induced by 60 min, while secretion had not yet begun with HMW (p<0.01 +). Both LMW
and HMW had high expression at 120 min (both +++ vs saline) but TNF secretion had resolved
by 180 mins after LMW but remained highly elevated 180 min post-HMW poly I:C (HMW > saline
p<0.01 ++ and > LMW *). Resolution occured by 300 min post-HMW poly I:C. With HMW poly I:C
IFNb showed no induction at 30 or 60 min, very strong induction at 120 min (P<0.0001) which
increased further at 180 min (P<0.0001) before partial resolution at 300 min. Conversely, LMW
induced very little IFNb, with a small increase at 120 min (P<0.05 vs. saline +) and essentially
nothing thereafter.
b) Hypothalamic transcripts. The timecourses of Il6, Tnfa, Il1b were very similar between HMW
and LMW poly I:C, although levels of Il6 were much higher after LMW. Comparing transcription
of Ifnb and interferon-responsive genes revealed a remarkable pattern. Although the expression
of Ifnb was apparent in both groups by 180 min, it was much higher by 300 min after LMW
compared to HMW (p< 0.0001). However the expression of the IFN-dependent genes Irf7 and
Eif2ak2 (PKR) was very much higher post-treatment with HMW poly I:C. This suggests that the
induction of interferon-dependent genes in the hypothalamus is driven by circulating IFNb (Figure
4a) rather than by local, hypothalamic synthesis of IFNb (Figure 4b).
A similar pattern of inducing significantly higher Il6 witih LMW but much higher Irf7 and Eif2ak2
(PKR) with HMW poly I:C was also observed in the hippocampus (Figure 4c) indicating that in
multiple brain regions systemic LMW poly I:C induces higher brain transcription of innate genes
but downstream, interferon-dependent genes are actually driven by circulating IFNb.

Relationship between circulating IFNb and brain interferon-dependent responses.
Given the finding that brain expression of IFN I-dependent genes associates strongly with
circulating IFNb rather than brain expression of Ifnb transcripts, we assessed an additional panel
of IFN-I-dependent genes to assess whether circulating IFNb was sufficient to induce their
expression in brain. In order to examine whether their expression was exclusively regulated by
IFNb, we assessed whether IFNAR1 was necessary to facilitate their expression upon poly I:C
treatment. IFNb, administered at a dose of 25,000 units, induced robust increases of Irf7, Isg15
and Cxcl10 in the hippocampus of normal C57BL6J mice with respect to saline challenges in the
same animals (Figure 5a, all p<0.01 by students t-test).
Challenging normal C57 mice with HMW poly I:C (Figure 5b), it was clear once again that Irf7
expression in the hippocampus was expressed to a much lower extent with LMW poly I:C (p<0.01).
Another interferon-dependent gene, Isg15, was also expressed less robustly after LMW poly I:C
treatment (p<0.01), but levels were still significantly elevated with respect to saline controls
(p<0.01). The interferon-dependent gene Cxcl10 showed somewhat variable transcription but
was equally induced by LMW poly I:C (80 mg/kg) and HMW poly I:C (20 mg/kg) despite quite
different levels of circulating IFNb (Figure 4a). This may indicate that the high expression of other
cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-a or IL-1b may act cooperatively to induce its transcription.
Challenging WT and IFNAR1-/- mice with HMW poly I:C (Figure 5c), it was apparent that IFNAR1
was essential for the expression of Irf7 in the hippocampus. Although expression of both Isg15
and Cxcl10 were both very much reduced in IFNAR1-/- mice, some limited expression of these
genes remained, supporting a role for induction by cytokines other than type I IFN. Nonetheless,
at the protein level, using immunohistochemistry we show that CXCL10 is expressed at the brain
endothelium in WT mice treated with HMW poly I:C but is absent in IFNAR1-/- mice (Figure 5d).

Effect of poly I:C on innate immune responses in young and aged mice.
Now focusing on HMW due to its robust IFN-I responses, we examined the impact of age upon
IFN-I and other cytokine responses. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in blood plasma
(IL-6, IFNβ, TNF-α and IL-1β) from animals treated with saline or poly I:C (at 3 or 21 months).
Statistically significant differences in responses in of these groups were assessed by two-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis.
IL 1β was significantly induced (Figure. 6a), showing a main effect of treatment (F1,19 = 18.18, p=
0.0005) and of age (F1,19= 6.67, p = 0.0194) with a trend towards interaction between these factors
(F1,19= 3.46, p=0.08). Bonferroni post-hoc comparison showed that poly I:C at 21 months induced
significantly more IL-1b than the same challenge at 3 months (p=0.025). Poly I:C also robustly
increased TNF-α (fig. 6a; main effect of treatment: F1,19 = 24.44, p<0.0001). However, young and
aged groups showed similar increases and there was no effect of age and no interaction between
treatment and age. Poly I:C had a marked effect on IL-6 secretion (Figure 6a; main effect of
treatment F1,19 = 58.97, p<0.0001, and of age: F1,19 = 25.96, p<0.0001). Importantly, there was
also an interaction between treatment and age, illustrating that poly I:C has greater impacts on
plasma IL-6 in those with more advanced age (F1,19 = 22.84, p=0.0001). Age also significantly
affected IFNb responses to poly I:C in IFN β (fig. 6b). There was a significant main effect of
treatment (F1,19 = 49.35, p<0.0001) and of age (F1,19 = 12.28, p= 0.0024). Again there was an
Interaction between treatment and age showing exaggerated IFNb responses with advanced age
(F1,19=12.28, p=0.0024). Therefore there is evidence for more intense IL-1b, IL-6 and IFNb
responses to poly I:C in aged animals compared to young ones.
Hypothalamic inflammatory transcripts (Il1b, Tnfa, Il6, Ifnb, Irf7) were measured in the same 3
month and 21 month old animals (Figure 6b). There were large effects of treatment for Il1b, Tnfa
and Il6 (F1,17 ≥18.18, p≤0.0005) while treatment also significantly affected Ifnb (F1,17=5.75,
p=0.028). Among the cytokines, age was only a significant influence on Il1b (F1,17=6.67,
p=0.0194), but the IFN-dependent gene Irf7 also showed significant effects of age and treatment
and, importantly, an interaction between these factors (F1,17=9.93, p=0.007). Bonferroni post-hoc
analysis on all 5 transcripts showed that only Il1b (p=0.025) and Irf7 (p=0.038) showed
heightened responses in poly I:C at 21 months compared to 3 months.
Hippocampal inflammatory transcripts (Il1b, Tnfa, Il6, Ifnb, Irf7) were measured in the same
animals (Figure 6c), with Cxcl10 now added because of its reported impact on hippocampal-

dependent cognitive function in recent studies (Blank et al., 2016). Transcription of Il1b was
modest in young animals but marked in 21 month old mice. There was a significant interaction of
treatment and age, with aged animals showing exaggerated Il1b expression (F1,19 = 29.19,
p<0.0001). For Tnfa, (figure 6c) there was an effect of treatment and (F1,19 =38.31, p< 0.001) but
levels were not different as a function of age and there was no interaction between age and
treatment. Poly I:C produced quite variable increases in Il6 in both young and aged animals (main
effect of treatment F1,19 = 30.74) but there was no effect of age nor an interaction between age
and treatment. Ifnb, expression in these samples was highly variable (qPCR assays for this single
exon gene can be variable since they are prone to amplification of genomic DNA impurities in
RNA) (Figure 6c). Poy I:C did induce Ifnb (main effect of treatment: F1,19 = 11.13, p=0.0035) but
there was no effect of age and no interaction.
The Irf7 response to poly I:C was exaggerated in aged mice with respect to young mice,
(significant age x treatment interaction: F 1,18 = 6.00, p=0.0248). Bonferroni post-hoc showed that
poly I:C Irf7 response at 21 months was significantly larger than that at 3 months (p<0.003).
Cxcl10 was also significantly elevated by poly I:C (main effect of treatment: F1,18 54.85, P<0.0001)
but there was no significant effect of age. There was a modest increase at 21 months with respect
to 3 months but this was not quite significant (p=0.096). Therefore there is evidence of
exaggerated Il1b response and exaggerated type I interferon action when aged mice are exposed
to systemic double stranded RNA.
Systemic poly I:C induces acute cognitive dysfunction selectively in aged animals.
A separate batch of animals of 6 and 24 months of age were trained on an ‘escape from shallow
water’ version of T-maze alternation, designed to test animals on working memory during
concurrent sickness behavior (Murray et al., 2012). Mice were trained for >10 blocks of 10 trials
in order to reach criterion performance of 80% correct responding and all animals, at baseline
were capable of learning the alternation strategy to escape the maze regardless of age. Upon
challenge with poly I:C (12 mg/kg i.p.) there was an acute disruption of working memory that
occurred selectively in 24 month old animals challenged with poly I:C. The same challenge in
young animals had no impact on cognitive function. There were main effects of age (F1,68=17.96)
and poly I:C (F1,68=18.26, p<0.0001), but importantly there was an interaction of age and poly I:C
(F1,68=4.733, p=0.033) illustrating that poly I:C has distinct effects on cognitive function in older
animals.

Discussion
In the current study we have shown that LMW dsRNA (such as that supplied by Sigma) induces
much lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a than HMW and induces
negligible circulating IFNb. Limited effects of LMW poly I:C on sickness behaviour can be
overcome using significantly higher doses of poly I:C, but the refractory IFNb responses persist.
Time course studies indicate that brain IFN-I responses are directly dependent on circulating IFNb
and that brain Ifnb transcription is not, of itself, sufficient to trigger downstream anti-viral
responses in the brain. IFNb challenge is a strong driver of brain Cxcl10 responses but both
sickness and Cxcl10 remain inducible in IFNAR1-/- mice with higher LMW poly I:C dosing,
consistent with recently described roles for CXCL10 in sickness behavior. Importantly IL-6, IL-1b
and IFNb or IFN-dependent responses were exaggerated in older animals, both in plasma and in
brain and this was associated with significantly worse cognitive impairments in aged animals.

Differential responses to HMW and LMW
We have shown widely different cytokine responses to Sigma and Amersham preparations of
poly I:C and then used Invivogen poly I:C preparations, explicitly described, and verified here, as
HMW or LMW, to show that Sigma preparations are LMW (<500 bp) and those of Amersham are
HMW (1-6 kb). HMW poly I:C lead to spontaneous abortion in pregnant dams (table 1), which
never occurred with LMW poly I:C, and this was recently reported elsewhere for HMW poly I:C
(Mueller et al., 2019). This is likely to be caused by TNF-a since this was absent in LMW
challenges at 20 mg/kg and TNF-a has been described to be a key mediator in inducing
miscarriage in LPS and malaria models (Gendron et al., 1990; Poovassery et al., 2009). Two
recent studies (Careaga et al., 2018; Mueller et al., 2019) have also suggested there is also
significant variability between different Sigma preparations, showing variable amounts of higher
MW dsRNA, which strongly predicted temperature and cytokine changes. Although HMW induced
significantly greater cytokine levels (Mueller et al., 2019) neither study examined the prototypical
anti-viral cytokine family, IFN-I. The data from all 3 studies show that cytokine responses require
characterisation with each individual poly I:C preparation but the current data indicate that IFN-I
responses are unlikely to have been prevalent in the majority of published studies of maternal
immune activation that have been performed to date, since most of those studies use Sigma poly
I:C preparation. IFN-I responses are important contributors to the sickness behaviour response
in poly I:C treated animals (Murray et al., 2015; Blank et al., 2016) and also facilitate the IL-6
response. That is, while IL-6 appears to contribute to the hypolocomotion and reduction in
species-typical behaviours associated with poly I:C induced sickness, IL-6 production is itself
dependent on baseline IFN-I levels (Matsumoto & Seya, 2008b; Murray et al., 2015). IL-6 is an
important mediator of poly I:C- and virally-induced behavioural changes in the offspring of
maternal immune activation models (Matsumoto & Seya, 2008b; Murray et al., 2015) so it is
apparent that levels of IFN-I and IL-6 are intimately linked and models purporting to mimic viral
infection must be cognisant of this deficiency as well as the variability inherent in LMW
preparations.
Different cytokine responses: different receptors and different locations?
The fundamentally different cytokine responses observed here, and in recent studies, showing
quantitative (Careaga et al., 2018; Mueller et al., 2019) and qualitative (IFN-I: current study)
differences, suggest that distinct receptors are being engaged by these different preparations.
Synthetic dsRNA, poly I:C, activates the immune system by signaling through TLR3, RIG-I and

MDA5. TLR3 is found on the endosomal lumen of innate immune cells. Cell surface TLR3
expression is also seen on fibroblast and epithelial cells but successful poly I:C-TLR3 interactions
are dependent on an acidic pH within the endosome (de Bouteiller et al., 2005; Matsumoto &
Seya, 2008a; Gürtler & Bowie, 2013). Macrophages and, in particular, plasmacytoid dendritic
cells can take up extracellularly applied poly I:C, reflecting their essential ‘sentinel’ response to
viral infection of the host, while other cell types require transfection of RNA in order to access
cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors and induce IFNb responses. Given their primary role in recognising
viral infection, it is significant that pDCs and macrophages do not require transfection (Zhou et al.,
2013).
Both RIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic and thus dsRNA must reach the cytoplasm to facilitate
sensing by these receptors. Cytoplasmic delivery (with transection agents such as
polyethylenimine (PEI) derivates) was required to trigger MDA5 responses but not TLR3
responses (Kato et al., 2008). In vitro, naked dsRNA requires TLR3 while liposome encapsulated
poly I:C does not, since it has access to the cytoplasm (Dauletbaev et al., 2015). Most
neuroscience studies with poly I:C do not use transfection agents. Prinz and colleagues (Blank et
al., 2016) used jetPEI to ‘transfect’ multiple cell types, in vivo, with poly I:C and showed a
requirement for mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) and the IFNAR1 receptor to
induce sickness behaviour and cognitive effects of poly I:C and VSV infection. Other authors
using 10 mg/Kg poly I:C i.p., without transfection (similar to current study), still found MAVS to be
essential in inducing IFN-I and the full IL-6 response (Sun et al., 2006). Thus, cytosolic sensing
of dsRNA is essential for full responses and MAVS is important whether transfection of poly I:C
has been performed (Blank et al., 2016) or not (Sun et al., 2006). This implicates either RIG-I or
MDA5 in the current study.
The length of dsRNA induces different IFN-I and cytokine responses to virally-generated dsRNA
(DeWitte-Orr et al., 2009) and it is now clear that MDA5 binds long dsRNA while RIG-I
preferentially recognises LMW: while extremely similar in structure, RIG-I binds to the blunt end
or 5’ triphosphate (5’ ppp) end of dsRNA while MDA-5 alternatively recognises the duplex
structure of dsRNA rather than any particular base pair sequence and is particularly sensitive to
long strands (Kato et al., 2008). Despite their different dsRNA length preferences, MDA-5 and
RIG-I signalling converge on MAVS signalling, recruiting dsRNA to the mitochondria where it acts,
via TBK-1 and IKK-i, to induce NF-κB and IRF3 (Gürtler and Bowie, 2013). Though RIG-I and
MDA5 can both induce IFNb (Dauletbaev et al., 2015; Palchetti et al., 2015) HMW appears
necessary for IFNb (Zhou et al., 2013). LMW cannot induce IFNb expression in various cell types

without transfection and the lower efficiency of cytoplasmic exposure to LMW dsRNA (Zhou et al.,
2013) may be sufficient to effectively allow Ifnb induction to occur only at trivial levels with LMW
poly I:C in the current study. However in TLR3 replete cells, MAVS is not necessary for initial pDC
responses to poly IC (Sun et al., 2006) and TLR3 activation and IFNb production by HMW poly
I:C is higher than that with LMW in vitro (Zhou et al., 2013). Based on the above findings, and the
data suggesting TLR3 also contributes to influenza-induced sickness behaviour (Majde et al.,
2009), its likely that TLR3 has a role in facilitating organismal responses to extracellularly
available dsRNA, but that MDA5 plays the major role in cytokine and IFNb induction. This may
occur upon sensing poly I:C distributed to the cytoplasm by extracellular vesicles (FrankBertoncelj et al., 2018) or other routes.
Brain responses, Sickness behaviour, IFN-I and CXCL10
Systemic IFNb responses and brain expression of IFN-dependent genes were minimal with LMW
poly I:C despite clear evidence of transcription of Ifnb and other cytokine transcripts in brain
homogenates, even at lower LMW doses (figure 2). Since these animals had very low levels of
circulating cytokines it seems reasonable to conclude that these brain transcripts represent a
direct endothelial and epithelial response to 20 mg/kg poly I:C appearing in the circulation.
Despite clear Ifnb transcription arising from both LMW and HMW treatment (becoming even
higher than with HMW poly I:C at high concentrations of LMW), LMW did not robustly induce Irf7,
which is a definitive indicator of local response to active IFNb (Gurtler & Bowie, 2013). This
indicates that the brain IFN-dependent response (Irf7) is in response to circulating IFN-I, as
validated in figure 5 and consistent with the observation of widespread brain interferon-dependent
gene expression in response to IFNa (Wang et al., 2008). The brain Irf7 response to HMW poly
I:C was completely ablated in IFNAR1-/- mice, as was Cxcl10, but Cxcl10 expression was robustly
induced by LMW poly I:C when this was applied at high doses, even when Irf7 was minimally
expressed. This reflects the finding that Cxcl10 expression can also be induced directly by poly
I:C, regulated by NFkB (Brownell et al., 2014). This failure of transcribed Ifnb to induce IFNdependent responses may be because type I IFN signaling in the absence of other cues activates
the expression of IFN-inducible genes that make cells more sensitive to further virus-induced
signals (Stetson & Medzhitov, 2006). That could mean that dsRNA recognition triggers Ifnb
transcription in cells that are unable to complete the synthesis of IFNb to induce downstream
programs without additional recognition of circulating IFNb. There is some evidence of posttranscriptional regulation of IFN-I (Khabar & Young, 2007). There is also evidence that the brain

responds differently to poly I:C compared to peripheral tissues, with increasing Ifnb expression in
MyD88-/- after icv poly I:C (Zhu et al., 2016) but this does not offer a satisfactory explanation for
the failure to express Irf7 downstream of Ifnb transcription after LMW poly I:C challenge.
Although we found that even at high doses LMW poly I:C did not produce significant IFNb, these
animals nonetheless became significantly more sick than the IFNb-inducing HMW poly I:C at 20
mg/kg. That implies that, although IFNAR1 may be central to sickness behaviour responses to
systemic poly I:C (Murray et al., 2015; Blank et al., 2016), high levels of other cytokines are
sufficient to drive the sickness response in the absence of circulating IFNb. Although the study of
Blank et al shows that IFN-dependent CXCL10 drives the sickness behaviour response, we have
previously shown that elements of the sickness response that are IFNAR1-dependent can be
recapitulated, in IFNAR1-/- mice, by supplementation with IL-6 (Murray et al., 2015). Here,
treatment with high dose of LMW poly I:C fails to produce circulating IFNb but does induce very
high levels of circulating IL-6 (figure 3,4) and also robust brain induction of Cxcl10 despite the
lack of IFNb (Figure 5). The data can thus be reconciled with prior data demonstrating the role of
IFNb and CXCL10 in poly I:C-induced sickness behaviour. Further studies are required to
determine whether the induction of CXCL10 in the absence of IFNb or IL-6 is sufficient for the
production of sickness behaviour.
Exaggerated responses to dsRNA with age and relevance to viral infection in the elderly.
There is significant interest in determining whether aged individuals respond differently to
equivalent exposure to dsRNA, as might occur with viral infections encountered by the older
population. The current data demonstrate exaggerated IFN-I and cytokine responses to poly I:C
in aged mice (Figure 6). Both IL-6 and IFNb show exaggerated induction in the blood while Il1b
and Irf7 (indicating IFN-I action) showed exaggerated induction in the hippocampus. The
molecular basis for this exaggerated cytokine response has not been elucidated here, but there
is evidence that low level IFN-I expression facilitates more robust IFN-I and IL-6 responses to
subsequent challenge (Gough et al., 2012) and there is existing evidence for low-grade IFN-I
expression in aged mice (Baruch et al., 2014). Moreover, microglia are known to be primed to
produced exaggerated cytokine responses in aged mice (Godbout et al., 2005).
These data are important in a general sense since many viruses shed dsRNA during infection
and the innate immune response occurring during viral infection may be a key driver of acute
cognitive deficits in infected individuals. The current data indicate that, at least with respect to

dynamic cognitive processes like working memory, aged animals are significantly more
susceptible to these changes upon exposure to dsRNA (Figure 7). These cognitive data, have
particular resonance in the current coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in which CNS symptoms
including confusion and delirium have been widely observed. In the largest report on hospitalised
cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe, the ISARIC consortium report that confusion was the most 5th
most common symptom on admission, representing 25% of all patients (Docherty et al., 2020)
(Docherty et al., 2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020). It is known that delirium is more prevalent in older
age (Cole, 2004) and that older SARS-CoV-2 patients often present with delirium in the absence
of even the characteristic COVID19 symptoms (Kennedy et al., 2020; Poloni et al., 2020). There
is, quite rightly, significant attention on the evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the brain
(Meinhardt et al., 2020) and whether this contributes to the frequent neuropsychiatric features
observed, but the current data show that even in the absence viable virus, peripheral dsRNA
alone is sufficient to trigger disruption of dynamic cognitive functions relying on attention and
working memory, selectively in older individuals.
Double stranded RNA is a relevant immune stimulus with respect to SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped
positive sense ssRNA virus (like flaviviruses, retroviruses). Once inside the cytoplasm +sense
RNA is read by ribosomes to make viral proteins and acting as a template to form an intermediate
hybrid state with negative sense RNA to facilitate making multiple copies of the original +ssRNA.
Thus significant dsRNA is present for a period, which allows the activation of dsRNA sensors
such MDA5 (Kato et al., 2008) and with a genome of approximately 30 kb (Bar-On et al., 2020)
long RNA (i.e. HMW) duplexes are likely to occur. Nothwithstanding evidence that coronaviruses
can form double membrane vesicles that sequester dsRNA and limit their engagement of PRRs
(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Vabret et al., 2020), RNAemia was detected in 78.6% of SARS-CoV-2
patients who required hospital admission (Hogan et al., 2020). There is a type I interferon
response in SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. Not all studies concur (Hadjadj et al., 2020), but
recent scRNAseq evidence suggests that IFN-I, along with IL-1- and TNF-dependent pathways
may be particularly important in severe infection (Lee et al., 2020).
Whether there are heightened IFN-I responses in aged individuals exposed to viral infection more
generally requires investigation, but it remains striking that aged animals show exaggerated proinflammatory and IFN-I responses and also show exaggerated vulnerability to acute cognitive
deficits relevant to delirium. This selective disruption of working memory in aged animals, and its
relevance to viral infection-induced delirium requires investigation. The increased risk of delirium
in aged patients is true for many infections, including influenza, but information on specific viral

infections is scant and this requires investigation. There is prior evidence for poly I:C-induced
memory impairments. Poly I:C affected contextual fear conditioning memory consolidation in
normal animals (Weintraub et al., 2014) and more detailed studies show motor learning deficits
and spine remodelling that was dependent on TNF-a and peripheral monocytes (Garre et al.,
2017), most likely with LMW poly I:C. While aged mice showed slightly increased sickness
behaviour responses to poly I:C compared to younger animals (McLinden et al., 2012) agedependent impacts of dsRNA on cognitive function such as those shown here, have not
previously been described.
Arguing for a cytokine-mediated basis for the acute cognitive changes seen here, we have
previously shown direct causative roles of IL-1b (Skelly et al., 2019) and TNF-a (Hennessy et al.,
2017) in similar deficits and there are also now a number of studies indicating that IFNb can also
have direct or indirect impacts on neuronal physiology and cognition (Costello et al., 2011; Baruch
et al., 2014; Blank et al., 2016). Given the current trials of IFNa or b in SARS-CoV2 patients, it is
very important to elucidate the cognitive effects of IFN-I in aged individuals and patients with
cognitive impairment at baseline.
We posit that at least some of the very commonly observed CNS disturbances associated with
SARS-CoV-2 can be understood in the context of well-described systemic inflammation causing
acute cognitive dysfunction when superimposed on the vulnerable brain. The contribution of
SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation is also important to examine in the context of new
brain injury and acceleration of dementia and cognitive aging. We have shown that repeated poly
I:C treatments produce acute episodes of dysfunction but also accelerate neurological decline
(Field et al., 2010) and this mirrors the reported impact of delirium on subsequent dementia
diagnoses and rate of decline (Fong et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2012). The recent description of
increased markers of brain injury in SARS-CoV-2 patients (Kanberg et al., 2020) is consistent
with the view that this infection produces new brain injury that may accelerate cognitive decline.
Supporting a possible role for IFN-I in such disease exacerbation we (Nazmi et al., 2019) and
others (Taylor et al., 2014; Abdullah et al., 2018) have shown that brain IFNAR1 contributes to
progression and severity of neurodegenerative disease. It is important to add that while
inflammatory cytokines can directly impact on brain function, hypercoagulation, which is triggered
by inflammation-induced microvascular damage, is likely an important determinant of more
severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients (Liao et al., 2020) and post-mortem studies showing
these features are beginning to emerge (Nath et al., 2020). Hypercoagulation can also be induced

contribute to neurodegeneration require investigation.
Conclusion
HMW poly I:C has substantially more robust effects on systemic and brain inflammation than
LMW poly I:C in C57BL6 mice. In addition, LMW poly I:C fails to induce a robust type I IFN
response, the prototypical cytokine system of the antI-viral response. The data showing that
circulating IFNb is the major determinant of brain IFN-I responses, that this response is
exaggerated in aged mice and that working memory disruption is exaggerated in aged mice
treated with poly I:C has implications for understanding acute cognitive effects of viral infections
in older individuals and raise questions about the contribution of systemic viral infections to
neurodegenerative changes.
