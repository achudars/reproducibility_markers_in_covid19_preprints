Production the industrial levels of bioethanol from glycerol by engineered
yeast "Bioethanol-4th generation"

Besides the pledges for expanding uses of biofuels to sustain the humanosphere, abruptly massive

6

needs emerged for sanitizers with turns COVID-19 to a pandemic. Therefore, ethanol is topping the

7

social-demanding, although the three generations of production, from molasses/starch,

8

lignocelluloses, and algae. Owing to the limited-availability of fermentable sugars from these

9

resources, we addressed glycerol as a fourth bio-based carbon resource from biodiesel, soap, and

10

fatty acid industries, which considers as a non-applicable source for bioethanol production. Here, we

11

show the full strategy to generate efficient glycerol fermenting yeast by innovative rewriting the

12

oxidation of cytosolic nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NADH) by O2- dependent dynamic

13

shuttle while abolishing glycerol biosynthesis route. Besides, imposing a vigorous glycerol-oxidative

14

pathway, the engineered strain demonstrated a breakthrough in conversion efficiency (up to 98%).

15

Its capacity extending to produce up to 90g /l ethanol and > 2 g l-l h-l, which promoting the industrial

16

view. Visionary metabolic engineering here provides horizons for further tremendous economic and

17

health benefits with assuring for its enhancing for the other scenarios of biorefineries.

Summary: Efficiently fermenting glycerol in yeast was developed by comprehensive engineering

the glycerol pathways and rewriting NADH pathways.

One of the challenges for sustaining the future humanosphere is producing adequate bio -

24

and biotechnologies for apt emerging needs of biofuels, materials, and chemicals has been

25

envisioned and created on a commodity scale 1-3. An abruptly massive needs in ethanol arose for

26

medical uses as sanitizers, with turns COVID-19 to a pandemic; it had confirmed the efficiencies

27

of 62-71% of ethanol for deactivating infection of the viruses’ attached to the hands and ward -off

28

the infectious germs on persistent inanimate surfaces like metal, glass, and plastic 4. Baker’s yeast

29

(Saccharomyces cerevisiae), has several superior characteristics such as the ancient history with

30

the safety of use, unicellular structure, short life cycle, distinguished powers of fermentation,

31

robustness against inhibitors, stress-tolerance during different industrial levels of production,

32

global infrastructures for production of bioethanol from starch and molasses, and the availability

33

the toolboxes of genetic recombination. Besides, it is subjecting to the adaptive evolutions or

34

even the hybridization, thence a Baker’s yeast had appointed as a top model platform of microbial

35

cell factories for several biotechnological applications 5-7. The first generation of bioethanol

36

globally has successfully established with its uses for blending with gasoline as transportation

37

biofuel. Owing to environmental, political, security, bio-economic issues, the demanding for

38

bioethanol increases, although the resources for fermentation limited and the attempts are still

39

enduring of overcoming the drawbacks of application of second and third generation of

40

bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass and the algae; basically, through evolving the maximum

41

efficiencies in ethanol production during xylose fermentation with glucose or even coupled to

42

acetic acid8- 12.

43

In the last decade, glycerol producing industries, especially biodiesel, have expanded and

44

accumulated substantial quantities of glycerol, which led to dropping its price13. Although the

45

reductive merit in glycerol (C3H8O3) higher than other fermentable sugars14, glycerol is classifying

46

as a non-fermentable carbon in the native S. cerevisiae5, besides, it is used poorly as feedstock,

mainly through the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway, referred to as G3P pathway here, which

48

composed of glycerol kinase (GUT1), and FAD-dependent-mitochondrial-glycerol-3-phosphate-

49

dehydrogenase (GUT2)15. Conversely, yeast biosynthesizes glycerol for mitigating the osmotic stress

50

and optimize the redox balance16, with subjection to the repression and transcriptional regulation of

51

glucose through respiratory factors (RSF), and GUT1 and GUT2 genes17-20. The importance of

52

glycerol as a carbon source, which could be utilized by yeast cells, has recognized. It promoted a

53

study of the relationship between the molecular inheritance and the physiology of glycerol uptake

54

and its metabolism. This study revealed a high interspecies diversity ranged from the good-glycerol

55

grower to negative-glycerol grower in 52 of S. cerevisiae strains on a synthetic medium without

56

supporting supplements and that the glycerol growth phenotype is a quantitative trait. It has

57

confirmed that GUT1 is one of these genetic loci that sharing glycerol growth phenotype in one of

58

these good-glycerol grower strains, a haploid segregant CBS 6412-13A21. Hereafter, two further

59

superior alleles of cytoplasmic-ubiquitin protein-ligase-E3 (UBR2) and cytoplasmic-phosphorelay-

60

intermediate osmosensor and regulator (SSK1) had found to link with GUT1 for the growing on the

61

synthetic medium without supporting supplements22. These pivotal roles of UBR2 and GUT1 during

62

glycerol assimilation by yeast had further confirmed by another study that re-sequenced the whole-

63

genomes a glycerol-evolved strains23, 24. Although G3P-pathway has evidenced the main catabolic-

64

pathway for glycerol catabolism in S. cerevisiae, its heterologous-replacing with DHA-pathway that

65

combined glycerol facilitator (FPS) resulted in restores the similar growth of the parental strain.

66

Furthermore, this replacement in a negative-glycerol grower strain bearing the swapped

67

UBR2CBS6412-13A allele had guided the growth rate to the highest specific growth rate ever reported on

68

glycerol-synthetic medium25.

With an approach for the production of 1, 2- propanediol from glycerol, a significant amount

69
70

of ethanol (18 g/l) had accumulated during the first day as a byproduct, particularly on the rich

71

media. This study addressed metabolic engineering strategy combined heterologous-replaces of the

72

G3P route by DHA-FPS pathway25 with a module for the production of 1, 2- propanediol, besides,

73

the down-expression to the gene triosephosphate-isomerase gene (TPI1)26. Limiting oxygen

74

availability in the shake flask cultures showed increasing the production of ethanol from glycerol

75

(8.5 g ethanol / 51.5 g glycerol) to (15.7 g ethanol / 45 g glycerol) with production rate 0.1g l-1h-1 on

76

synthetic medium in a recent study for facilitating understanding the future engineering of valuable

77

products more reduced than ethanol27 using genetic modifications of heterologous-replaces of the

78

G3P route by DHA-FPS pathway25. It is worth emphasizing glycerol has considered a non-

79

fermentable carbon source in S. cerevisiae5; although, such attempts for fermenting it by S.

80

cerevisiae. These experiments had initiated by overexpressed a native oxidative-glycerol pathway

81

(DHA), includes glycerol dehydrogenase (GCY1) and dihydroxyacetone-kinase (DAK), beside

91

On the other hand, we developed a novel pretreatment method for biomass using glycerolysis

92

with the catalysis of alum AlK(SO4)2, with additionally promoted by a microwave30. Hence, there

93

emerged a need for evolving a model of yeast that can ferment glycerol efficiently after this

94

glycerolysis for complete establishing our scenario by synergist current 4th generation of bioethanol

95

with its analog of the second or third generation, as well as either first generation. In this study, we

96

report the details of how is the modeling of yeast cell to redirect the glycerol traffic to bioethanol

97

production until the industrial levels even in the presence of glucose through the innovation of the

98

forthcoming systematic metabolic engineering showed in (Fig 1): I) abolishing the inherent glycerol

99

biosynthesis pathway by knocking-out NAD-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase

100

(GPD1) and retaining the second isoform GPD2 for requirements of glycerol 3-phosphate for lipid

101

metabolism. II) Replacing cytosolic NADH-oxidation through the GPD1 shuttle by a more effective

102

O2-dependent dynamic shuttle of water forming NADH-oxidase (NoxE) to renovate NAD+ for that

fermentation. Initial verification for overexpressing of glycerol dehydrogenase from Ogataea

polymorpha OpGDH31 in the D452-2 strain of S. cerevisiae showed strong effects compared with

114

116

recombinant strain GF2 (Table 1). The strain harboring the GDH gene, which named GDH, is

117

consuming glycerol faster than GF2 with an increase of 21% in ethanol production, whereas it was

118

only 10% in GF2 compared with the parental strain (Fig. 2). In full aerobic fermentation (1/10

119

liquid culture/flask volume) of mixed glucose and glycerol using GDH strain improved the glycerol

120

consumption and ethanol production from 25% to 40% and from 21%–64%, respectively, before

121

switching to the re-utilization of ethanol when compared with the previous semi-aerobic condition

122

(Figs. 2 and 3). These results indicating the first step for the efficiency of glycerol fermentation

123

should be through an effective GDH started here with an act of OpGDH. Furthermore, we confirmed

124

that glycerol consumption was through the constructed DHA, where glycerol consumption has not

125

significantly decreased after knocked-out the ScGUT1 gene, which is the first gene in the G3P

126

pathway (Fig. 2). Also, activating the genes of the G3P pathway (ScSTL1, ScGUT1, ScGUT2, and

127

ScTPI1) in a recombinant strain named GA2 (Table 1) did not impose significant improvement in

128

the ethanol production (Fig. 2).

129
130

Step no. 2: efficient rewriting NADH pathway oxidation in S. cerevisiae by an O2-dependent

131

dynamic shuttle of water forming NADH-oxidase (LlNoxE) replaces GPD1. We

132

comprehensively studied replacing GPD shuttles by water-forming-NADH-oxidase from

133

Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (LlNoxE). As the GPD shuttle is the first step in glycerol

134

biosynthesis and represents one of the well-known systems for renovating a cytosolic NAD + from

135

NADH produces during the metabolic process such as those from the oxidation of glyceraldehyde

136

3- phosphate (GA3P). As a consequence, glycerol is secreting at the unbalances of redox -

137

reactions toward NADH. Therefore, we first rated the participation levels of GPD1 and GPD2 in

138

glycerol biosynthesis in our ancestor strain D452-2 at 10% of glucose fermentation by deleting

139

each isoform separately. The data obtained, reveals that the participation ratio of GPD1 in

140

glycerol biosynthesis was 82%, where glycerol secretion from ∆ GPD1 was 0.47g/2.56g of wild

141

type WT; while it was 23% (2.08g/2.56g WT) with ∆ GPD2 (Table 2; Fig.S1a). Replacing GPD1

142

with LlNoxE reduced glycerol secretion by 98%, where 0.14g glycerol /2.56g of WT has secreted,

143

whereas it only 29% with NoxE/ GPD2 strain which secreted 1.82g/ 2.56 of WT (Table 2;

144

Fig.S1a). On the other hand, replacing both GPD1 and GPD2 with LlNoxE not only prevent glycerol

145

formation but also reduced glucose consumption significantly and obstructed cell growth and

146

fermentation by almost the same levels at 15% while increased secretion of acetate by 2.46 fold

147

(Table 2; Fig.S1a-e). Similarly, replacing GPD1 by LlNoxE with deleting GPD2 (Table 2; Fig.S1a-

148

e). Comparatively, the overexpressed LlNoxE gene in the URA3 locus with the conserved native

149

activity of glycerol biosynthesis pathway exhibited a moderate reduction in glycerol production of

150

only 41% (1.53g/ 2.56g) in the D452-2 strain (Table 2; Fig.S1a). Notably, replacing GPD

151

with LlNoxE switched the glycerol production to an increase in acetate production (Table 2;

152

Fig.S1b). Exclusively, replacing GPD1 with LlNoxE is an excellent approach to eliminating glycerol

153

formation during glucose fermentation to ethanol, where ethanol production increased by 9 %

154

(0.474/ 0.432 g ethanol / g glucose as calculated in table 2, therefore, consolidating this replacement

155

with GDH could improve glycerol conversion to ethanol.

156
157

Step no. 3: integrating GDH and NoxE with ∆GPD1. Owing to the previous results from the

158

recombinant GDH strain and the data of replaced the shuttles of oxidizing the cytosolic NADH by

159

LiNoxE, therefore, we studied the recycling outputs of NAD +/NADH between the GDH and

160

LiNoxE. In addition to this recycling, deleting GPD1 during that substitution with LiNoxE will

161

abolish glycerol formation and decreases the ramification of DHAP, which consolidates the

162

straightforward to glycolysis route. As a result of that thinking, we engineered a further strain that

163

combined GDH with LiNoxE with a ∆ GPD1 as listed in table 1. This round of recombination

164

(GDH+NOXE strain) has tested for ability fermenting glycerol in comparison with GDH or

165

LiNoxE, as well as the wild type strain. This innovative integration clearly showed improvements

166

in both efficiency of glycerol conversion to ethanol and delayed in the time of reprogramming the

167

cell to utilize a produced ethanol. In figure 3 at 6h, both strains of the ancestor, and the

168

engineered GPD1/LlNoxE started their re-utilize the produced ethanol from glucose without

169

significant consumption in glycerol, where maximum ethanol produced was 4.7 g/l ethanol. In

170

GDH strain, the time of reusing the produced ethanol delayed to 26h with raises in the ethanol

171

production to 11.82 g/l, which represents 0.27 g ethanol/ the consumed glucose and glycerol. In

172

the case of GDH+NOXE, the integration here not only boosted the ethanol production to 13.27 g/l

173

(0.31g ethanol/ the consumed glucose and glycerol) at 26h, but also extended the fermentation

174

time to 32h, and further raised production of ethanol to 14.42 g/l before the switching to consume

175

that ethanol (Fig. 3).

176
177

Step no. 4: overexpressing the rest of the DHA pathway genes; TPI1, DAK1, DAK2, and

178

FPS. Although clear impacts of recycled inputs in the previous recombination, we deduced a

179

further limiting in the activity of other genes in the DHA pathway TPI1, DAK, FPS genes, which

180

affect that full traffic of glycerol conversion to ethanol. Therefore, we proceeded to overexpress

181

the rest of the genes included in the DHA pathway at this stage of systematic engineering. A

182

promoter phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) with its terminator had used to activate the endogenous

183

genes TPI1, DAK1, and DAK2. The gene of glycerol facilitator from Candida utilis (CuFPS1)32

184

had heterologous-expressed under the control of PGK promoter and Ribosomal 60S subunit

185

protein L41B terminator (RPL41B). The previous recombinant-strain GDH+NOXE has used as a

186

competent cell for receiving this one-set of genes in AUR-1C locus to generate a new strain,

187

which had named GDH+NOXE+FDT (Table 1). Unequivocally, this fourth step of recombination

188

solved one of the main problems in this study, where is prevented the phenomena of the switching

189

to utilizing ethanol before the full consumption of glycerol. A consumption rate reached 1 g l -1h-1

190

and produced 20.95 g/l of ethanol by this recombinant strain. Nonetheless, its conversion

191

efficiency of ethanol production appeared to be less than 48% of the theoretical value (Fig. 3).

192
193

Step no. 5: Super-expressing the DHA pathway genes by another copy of genes; ScTPI1,

194

ScDAK1, OpGDH, and CuFPS1 with abolishing the native G3P pathway. The stemming

195

results from the fourth step of genetic engineering posited the effect of the limited activities of the

196

other genes on paced productivity with the visibility to strengthen the pathway activity by another

197

copy. We carefully selected and designed the strongest-expression systems that may not be

198

affected by the repressors of regulators to constitutively-express this assortment of genes 33-36. By

199

merits of using the hybrid of Gibson assembly and PCR, we constructed one module named M1

200

(Table 3; Fig. S2) were their expression systems; TEF1 promoter-CYC1 terminator, TYS1

201

promoter-ATP15 terminator, TDH3 promoter-mutated d22DIT1 terminator, and FBA1 promoter-

202

TDH3 terminator, respectively with genes CuFBS1, OpGDH, ScDAK1, and ScTPI1. Therefore,

203

we intensified a whole glycerol oxidation pathway by integrating another copy of

204

genes CuFPS1, OpGDH, ScDAK1, and ScTPI1 during the replacement of the GUT1, which

205

abolished the G3P pathway, for continuing the overcoming of the previous inadequacies in this

206

fifth stage of recombination. Interestingly, we griped unique findings with step five of

207

recombination in the glycerol consumption and ethanol production that never reported in any

208

organism with the evolved strain GDH-NOXE-FDT-M1 named SK-FGG (Table 1, Fig.3). Its

209

consumption rate reached 2.6 g l -l h-l from glycerol at the described experimental conditions, and

210

the productivity paced 1.38 g l -l h-l of ethanol with conversion efficiency reached 0.44g ethanol/g

213

Osmotolerance of the engineered strain (SK-FGG) and the effect of higher aeration: the

214

strain SK-FGG exhibiting outstanding performance in aerobic conditions at that higher initial

215

concentration of glycerol in YP medium, where its conversion efficiency reached 0.49 g

216

ethanol/g glycerol with a production rate of> 1 g l -l h-l of ethanol (Fig. 4a). Even with the

217

mixing of glucose with glycerol at the same initial concentration, its conversion efficiency was

218

comparatively the same (Fig 4b). Interestingly, the strain engineered here glows in its capacity

219

to harmonize fermenting the glycerol with glucose, as well as, accumulation of 9% of

220

bioethanol with additional fed-batching of glycerol, although the efficiency decreased to 0.43 g

221

ethanol/g glycerol (Fig. 4c). Notably, increasing the aeration by increasing the volume of

222

flasks with keeping the constant of the broth volume accelerated the glycerol consumption

223

remarkably to >5 g l -l h-l. Also, the rate of ethanol production increased to >2 g l -l h-l.

224

Nonetheless, its conversion efficiency decreased to 0.42 g ethanol/g glycerol (Fig. 4d). We

225

observed some other minor uncharacterized peaks during the analysis of these samples, as a

226

further point for research in the future. It is also worth mentioning that a strain SK -FGG has

227

proved its capability to convert glycerol at larger volumes where we scaled up the

228

experimental capacities to 1, and 3 liters via the mini-jar 5L fermentor (see Methods section).

229

Nonetheless, its rates and efficiencies decreased due to higher fluctuating of the dissolved

230

oxygen during the fermentation by our available system, where a more advanced control

231

system is required.

Discussion

236

valuable products have gained higher attention, where a considerable amount of glycerol as an

237

unavoidable by-product from the expansion of biodiesel industries had accumulated. In our other

238

scenario, glycerol has evidenced as a delignifing agent during pretreating biomass with alum in the

239

glycerolysis process30. Therefore, working on engineering the yeast genetically for generating the

240

ability to convert glycerol into ethanol becomes inevitable for such all of these perspectives. S.

241

cerevisiae has full genes for two metabolic pathways (DHA and G3P) for glycerol catabolism

242

showed in Fig.1; nonetheless, glycerol had considered as non-fermentable and unfavorable carbon as

243

a feedstock5, 15. The distinctive differences seen in the ability to grow on the synthetic medium had

244

based on the genetic background of strains. Besides, that growth is a quantitative trait based on

245

alleles on genome21. Hence, prompted to scrutinize in the strain used here, where D452-2 originated

246

from three different ancestor strains via five sequential segregates crossing, one of the parental

247

strains is known its belonging to S. cerevisiae S288C37-39 (Table 1 and Fig. S3). D452-2 didn’t show

248

the ability of growth on synthetic medium without supplementing supports of uracil, leucine, and

249

histidine, although we confirmed that the UBR2 allele not truncated as in the CEN.PK family22, 23.

250

At the moment, it is not clear whether this disability to grow on synthetic medium in our strain

251

related to the genetic background as those of the negative-glycerol grower in 13 of S.

252

cerevisiae strains21 or generated by the interrupted genes Ura3, Lue2, and His3 in D452-2 strain.

253

Further studies are needed to reveal this point or ranking its growth rate with that previous well

254

studied strains21 to quantify trait the growth alleles on synthetic medium. In addition to these

255

unstudied points, we decided to use the rich medium represented in yeast peptone (YP), where it

showed a significant accumulated amount of ethanol onset fermentation of glycerol with engineered

257

for production of 1, 2- propanediol26.

258

Although revoking the TPI1 gene has considered a pivotal hub for the production of glycerol

259

from glucose40, which is the reverse direction here, it hasn’t integrated with the previous study that

260

examined overexpressing the native DHA-pathway28. Therefore, we combined the overexpression of

261

the TPI1 gene with the DHA pathway to track the restrictions in that oxidative pathway in

262

fermenting glycerol. Hence, we constructed a strain named GF2, which overexpressed its genes

263

ScSTL1, ScGCY1, ScDAK1, ScDAK2, and ScTPI1. Concurrently, we recognized the limited

264

activity of the ScGCY gene compared with a glycerol dehydrogenase from Ogataea polymorpha41.

265

Therefore, we constructed a yeast harbored OpGDH named GDH to be testing with GF2 during

266

fermenting glycerol. As a result of these comparing studies, such an active OpGDH gene is the first

267

key for deciphering glycerol fermentation, although the sole integration of OpGDH not enough to

268

induce an efficient fermentation (Fig. 2). On the other hand, overexpressing the native glycerol

269

catabolic pathway G3P in strain named GA2 did not demonstrate promising results as this oxidative

270

pathway. The assumption that may be contemplating here is the limit of the respiratory chain during

271

glycerol consumption, thus, restrict the renovation of FAD+ for converting glycerol 3-phosphate to

272

DHAP through GUT2, considering this phosphorylated G3P-pathway is subjecting to the repression

273

and transcriptional regulation with the presence of glucose17-20, 42, 43.

274

Besides the induction for expressing target genes, one of the other main obstacles affecting

275

the efficiency of microbial production is to meet the stoichiometries of the engineered metabolic

276

pathways, cofactors, and ATP/oxygen ratios, especially those pathways which require cofactors for

277

their activation2, 9, 44. As long as an integrated OpGDH in S. cerevisiae, we visualized the GPD

278

shuttles will promote to activates the oxidation of the plethora from cytosolic NADH and a reduction

279

of DHAP into G3P pathway. Besides, a ramification of glycerol 3-phosphate into glycerolipid

280

pathway takes place45. Likewise, the DHAP may be distributing into phospholipid and

281

methylglyoxal biosynthesis45, 46. Moreover, inasmuch of fermentable sugar, especially in the

282

presence of oxygen, there is a plethora of cytosolic NADH. As a result, there is a need for shuttles

283

for re-oxidizing this surplus. The shuttle of GPD plays an essential role in this regard with reducing

284

DHAP to glycerol 3-phosphate to keep this homeostasis. Intracellular redox homeostasis in S.

285

cerevisiae comprising > 200 reactions; thus, the shuttles oxidizing NADH has been well studied16, 44,

286

47

287

overexpressing a water-forming oxidase gene from Streptococcus pneumoniae in S. cerevisiae for

288

reducing the cytosolic NADH, and the overflow to glycerol biosynthesis44. Nonetheless, there are no

289

studies regarding the effects of replacing the native shuttles of GPD by other shuttles for oxidizing

290

the cytosolic NADH, such as those of water-forming. Therefore in the second round of

291

recombination in this study, we comprehensively focused on preventing that overflows to glycerol

292

biosynthesis with the conservation of intracellular redox homeostasis during fermenting glucose. The

293

Investigation of the nine constructed strains of either deleted or replaced GPD1 or/and GPD2 by the

294

NoxE gene, showed replacing GPD1 by LiNoxE is the best approach, where glycerol biosynthesis

295

effectively abolished by 98%, and an improvement in the fermentation efficiency by 9% (Table 2).

296

Expectedly, this single replacement will not exhibit further progress toward glycerol

297

fermentation (Fig.3). Assuredly, we referred to the act of the low activity of native glycerol

298

dehydrogenase ScGCY141. As detailed above, a ramification of DHAP represents another hindrance

299

for the straightforward toward glycolysis from glycerol. In this juncture, a reduced circulation of

300

DHAP into the G3P pathway had confirmed to be efficient for glycerol fermentation by integrating

301

this replacement of GPD1 by LiNoxE within the GDH strain. As expected, the strain harbored this

. One of the interesting ones is the catalyzing oxidation of cytosolic NADH by heterologous-

302

unique point of integration (GDH-NOXE) in this regard showed substantial improvement in ethanol

303

production from glycerol reached 28 % compared with GDH strain at that studied conditions, which

304

not considered the other parameters such as oxygen level (Fig.3). The role of abolishing GPD1 had

305

explicitly calculated from the data of fig. 3, which has represented 43 % of that improved ratio.

306

Utilize the recycles of cofactors NADH/NAD+ for production of 1, 2- propanediol has been well

307

studied during fermenting glycerol26. Nevertheless, it seems non-stoichiometries of cofactors in the

308

engineered pathway have compensated with the flowed to the ethanol accumulation relatively with

309

rich media and the faster growth rates at the onset of fermentation and lately with re-consumption of

310

ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2)26.

311

The importance around the activation of the other genes in the DHA pathway has confirmed,

312

through the continued bioethanol production until the full consumption of glycerol (Fig.3). Although

313

we didn’t evaluate the effect of overexpressing each gene individually, we recognized the

314

cooperative effects for overcoming that traditional-ambiguous phenomenon of re-consuming the

315

onset produced ethanol earlier than the full consumption of glycerol. In this regard, it had reported

316

that the permeability of the three-carbon compounds including glycerol in Candida utilis is much

317

faster than in the baker’s yeast, which supports the efficient utilization of glycerol, even at low

318

concentrations48. Therefore, heterologous-expressing CuFPS1 in S. cerevisiae could support the

319

influxes of glycerol in our strain as reported earlier25, 26, 32. Also, DAK1 and DAK2 had characterized

320

for detoxifying DAH, with Km(DHA) of 22 and 5 µM and Km(ATP) of 0.5 and 0.1 mM, respectively,

321

thus overexpressing DAK2 which is a much lower Km(DHA- ATP) with DAK1 here definitely detoxify

322

DHA that may accumulate by the action of the introduced OpGDH and CuFPS1 in this . Besides,

323

efficiently transfer DHA to DHAP. Furthermore, with presented genetic modifications during the

324

introduction of CuFPS1, and OpGDH, with overexpressing ScDAK1, and ScDAK2, DHAP may be

326

the native activity of TPI1 to be turned into pentose phosphate pathway especially with the presence

327

of glucose49. Through scrutinizes in the previous studies abolished the activity of TPI1, we

328

recognized the pivotal role of overexpressing TPI1 in this study, where the intracellular

329

concentration of DHAP accumulated to 30-fold50 and when this deactivation further coupled with

330

other deletions of NDE1, NDE2, and GUT2, the fermentation product had shifted from ethanol to

331

glycerol40.

332

However, integrate one copy of the whole DHA- pathway with NoxE generated the ability of

333

yeast to convert all supplemented glucose and glycerol to ethanol. Nonetheless, we recognized that

334

conversion efficiency may still be affected by the robustness of native programed-glycolysis.

335

Thence, further strengthening of the whole genes in the DHA pathway by another copy under

336

different expression systems could overcome this obstacle. Interestingly, the other copy

337

of CuFPS1, OpGDH, ScDAK1, and ScTPI1 that replaced GUT1 met our expectations and reaches

338

by efficiencies and the production rates to that comparable with the industrial application, where the

339

efficient conversions reached 98% of theoretical ratio with production rates 1.38 g l-l h-l. A potential

340

using the strategy of multi-copy with optimizing the stoichiometries of the metabolic pathway had

341

considerably boosted the production, e. g. six copies of the farnesene synthase gene, which

342

integrated into yeast to improve the synthesize of farnesene2. Here, with the second copy of

343

integration, we further selected highly constitutive expressing system in yeast33-36 to extend the

344

production levels and efficiencies, where TEF1 promoter-CYC1 terminator, TYS1 promoter-ATP15

345

346

respectively with genes CuFBS1, OpGDH, ScDAK1, and ScTPI1. Owing to the efficient SK-FGG

347

strain generated, and its introduced pathway, oxygen supplements were the limit. Surprisingly,

fermentation rates doubled with increasing aeration to >2 g l-l h-l. Nonetheless, we are currently

349

working on further improvements to increase the efficiency during such production rates, as well as

350

utilize glycerol’s high reduction merit for improving the fermentation efficiencies of other carbons.

351

In this study, we are reporting the discovery for the modeling of glycerol traffic to the

352

industrial levels of bioethanol production. This modeling includes the integration of (i) Impose

353

355

which controls the reaction stoichiometries with regenerate the cofactor NAD+. (iii) Revoking the

cerevisiae with tracking ethanol production to the highest levels that never attained by any other

359

native or genetically engineered organism27, 28, 52, 53, 54. Enormous considerations for the global

360

demands for bioethanol reported, although the limited resources. Thus, it constrained the global

361

annual bioethanol production to nearly 28.5 million gallons, which represents <2.7% of the

362

transportation fuels55-57. Therefore, the current study is expanding the horizon of utilizing the surplus

363

of glycerol directly to produce bioethanol. By fermenting glycerol, we avoid the burden of the

364

pretreatments, and enzymatic saccharification, besides the problems of fermentation inhibitor s.

365

Furthermore, the engineered strain in this study has revised a promising scenario of biorefinery. SK-

366

FGG dramatically improved bioethanol production from bagasse with the incorporation of glycerol,

367

which has pretreated the bagasse with alum30 and produced the industrial levels of bioethanol from

368

that glycerolysis mixture (Data not showed). The outcome of this study is to promote the association

369

between bioethanol and biodiesel industries, which may develop their expansions with

378

We obtained the genes’ DNA from the ancestor strain D452-2 to clone the plasmids in this

379

section. At first, disrupting the cell walls by re-suspended toothpick-touched cells in 20 µl 30 mM

380

NaOH at 95ºC for 10 min and then used directly as a template for PCR, fresh 1µl of that disrupted

381

cells is suitable for 50 µl of PCR mixture. All primers used to obtain the native genes were designed

382

based on the sequences available on the Saccharomyces Genome Database

383

(SGD): https://www.yeastgenome.org/. For assembling the following plasmids: pPGK-ScTPI1,

384

pPGK-ScDAK2, pPGK-ScDAK, pPGK-ScGCY1, and pPGK-ScSTL, the following genes: STL1,

385

GCY1, DAK1&2, and TPI1 obtained from genomic DNA of ancestor strain by PCR. High fidelity

during this amplification. Xhol site of DAK2 deleted before cloning. These DNA genes were

388

purified from the PCR mixtures by columns obtained from Nippon Genetics Co., Ltd., with its

389

accessories, and then form their cohesive ends according to the designated primers and restriction

390

enzymes. At first, we separately cloned each gene in pPGK/URA3 plasmid58, under the control of

391

the expression system PGK promoter and its terminator (Table 3). We further replaced the URA3

392

gene in a pPGK-URA3 plasmid with a gene of HIS3 (Ref59) using the feature of a synthetically

393

adding an overlapped sequences from pPGK plasmid to HIS3 marker using PCR and primes and

394

vice-versa (Section 3 – table S1). Then, a Gibson Assembly Master Mix assembles the overlapping

395

ends of the two fragments to form PGK-HIS3 plasmid. With construct pPGK-HIS3 plasmid (Table

396

3), we granted HIS3 locus for homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae after linearizing the

397

plasmid at the BsiWI site. We obtained the previous plasmids and confirming their genes sequences

398

by sequencing, detailed relevant primers listed in (Section 2 – table S1). Next, we cut XhoI/SalI-

399

TPI1 cassette and inserted it into XhoI/SalI sites of a newly constructed plasmid pPGK-HIS3

400

plasmid. Following, integrating the genes with their systems together in one plasmid started by

401

connecting the DAK2 set into the SalI site of the template plasmid started here by pPGK-TPI 1. The

402

deadly ligations (XhoI/SalI sites) that cannot reopen were used repeatedly during the ligation of

403

new cassettes and form the new plasmids. Repeatedly, DAK1, GCY1, and STL1 combined.

404

Ultimately, pPGK-ScTPI1- ScDAK2- ScDAK1- ScGCY1- ScSTL1 plasmid was constructed (Table

405

also established.

We also purchased, (synthetically from IDT Company), the water-forming NADH oxidase gene

433

of Lactococcus lactis based on sequence available on gene bank accession number AAK04489.1 and

434

cloned it into TDH3p-d22DIT1t to assemble TDH3-d22- LlNoxE plasmid (Tables 3, and S2).

3- Construct multiplex pCAS-gRNA-CRISPR systems.
The multiplex pCAS-gRNA system was a gift from Prof. Jamie Cate60 (Addgene plasmid #

442

60847; https://www.addgene.org/60847/). For that, we used the online tool for the rational design of

443

CRISPR/Cas target to allocate the highest probability of the on-target sites for the gRNA in the

444

genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae: https://crispr.dbcls.jp/ (Ref61). Accordingly, the sequence of the

445

primers designed based on previously allocated sequence (20 bp before the PAM), with another 20

446

bp from sgRNA or HDV ribozyme for overlapping (Sections 4.2, 5.1 and 7.1 – table S1). First, PCR

447

synthesizes two fragments from the template, pCAS-gRNA plasmid. The first one amplified by PCR

448

using a forwarding primer called pCas For., which located upstream of the gRNA scaffold at the

449

SmaI site of pCas and the antisense primer, which has a reverse sequence of target gRNA. The

450

second fragment amplified by forwarding primer, which has a sense sequence of gRNA and a

451

reverse primer called pCas Rev., located downstream of the gRNA scaffold (Section 4.2 – table S1).

452

After purifying each DNA part, overlapping and integration carried out by PCR using the pCas For.,

453

and pCas Rev. primers. Then, the produced fragment restricted to SmaI-PstI sites for the cloning into

454

a truncated pCAS-gRNA plasmid with SmaI-PstI. As a result, a new multiplex pCAS-gRNA

455

plasmid formed. Repeatedly steps have done with constructing all multiplex pCAS-gRNA plasmids

456

that target GPD1, GPD2, and GUT1 (Table 3). We confirmed the newly constructed systems by

457

sequencing their whole scaffolds.

463

gene glycerol facilitator FPS1 (CuFPS1). The sequence of CuFPS1 included in the deposited gene

464

bank accession number BAEL01000108.1. Original pAUR101 plasmid purchased from Takara Bio,

465

Inc., Japan, and the primers used to establish this plasmid listed in (Section 6 – table S1). A full

466

sequence for cassette, PGK-CuFPS1-RPL41Bt, transferred to (table S2). First, we constructed a

467

pAUR101-PGKp-RPL41Bt vector by one-step cloning of the SmaI-Not1 PGK promoter (fragment1)

468

and NotI-SalI-RPL41B terminator (fragment 2) into SmaI-SalI pAUR101 vector and then cloning a

469

cohesive ended-NotI-CuFPS gene into dephosphorylated NotI site of pAUR101-PGK-RPL41B

470

vector to assemble pAUR101-PGKp-CuFPS1-RPL41Bt vector. To constitute pAUR101-

471

CuFPS1, ScTPI1, ScDAK2, ScDAK1 plasmid, we detached the set of cassettes, ScTPI1, ScDAK2,

472

and ScDAK1, from previously constructed plasmids, pPGK-ScTPI1, ScDAK2 and ScDAK1 (Table

473

S1), using restriction enzymes Xhol-SalI and re-inserted that set of cassettes, ScTPI1, ScDAK2,

474

and ScDAK1, into the SalI site of pAUR101-PGK-CuFPS1-RPL41B plasmid (Table 3).

476

477

5- Construct Module M1; CuFPS1, OgGDH, ScDAK1, ScTPI1 cassettes with flanking
sequences of GUT1 promoter and terminator in plasmid pAUR101.
At first, we obtained all fragments which will form the module M1 separately by PCR (Fig. S2);

478

also, CuFPS1and OpGDH genes mutated d22DIT terminator amplified from their synthetic DNA

479

stocks, whereas other fragments magnified from the genomic DNA of the D452-2 strain (Fig. S2).

480

The full sequence of the module M1 is also accessible in (table S2), and the details of the primer

481

listed in (Section 7 – table S1). Purification of the 12 amplified DNA fragments was carried out on

482

1%–2% agarose gel and then recovered by the FastGene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (Nippon Genetics

483

Co. Ltd) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Accordingly, we obtained highly purified

484

fragments before the onset of assembles using the Gibson Assembly Master Mix. Effectively, we

485

joined the first three parts seamlessly, as well as for every next three fragments (Gibson’s protocol).

486

Also, we directly amplified each set by PCR and then purified them again on the agarose gel.

487

Repeatedly, we gathered the first six parts, as well as the other six fragments, and then assembled the

488

whole module M1. We further added the SacI site to the upstream of the module M1and SmaI site to

489

the downstream as well. These restriction sites provided for cloning the module M1 into SacI- SmaI

490

sites of pAUR101 vector to form pAUR 101-M1 (table 3). Finally, we transferred that vector, pAUR

Section II: Transformation and strains recombination in this study
All the previous plasmids stored in E. coli NEB 10-beta, for further the uses of production the

496

required plasmids or cassettes, using the heat shock method according to the procedures provided

497

with the competent cells. All plasmid extractions performed using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit

498

following the manufacturer’s protocol. All measurements of DNA were estimated using BioSpec-

499

nano (Shimadzu, Japan) and stocked in freezing at -20 ºC for future uses. Yeast transformation by

500

Fast Yeast TransformationTM kit (Takara Bio) used for integrated linear pAUR101 vector and its

501

associated genes in AUR1-C locus, linear pPGK plasmid with its cloned genes in either HIS3 or

502

URA3 loci as well37. For achieving editing the genome and the replacement of GPD1, GPD2, and

503

GUT1 genes with its designated DNA repairing cassette or module, we used the protocol of

504

CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in S. cerevisiae cells62. We confirmed target replacements using

505

PCR check for the inserted repairing cassettes with primers from upstream and downstream of the

506

flanking recombined loci. Primers listed down in each section (Table S1). Furthermore, we

507

cultivated up to 10 generations of the selected evolved strains to confirm the loss of pCAS plasmid

Section III: Fermentation procedures and analysis:

512

The initial fermentation experiments tested in 100 ml shaking flasks with 1/5 (liquid/flask

513

volume) with 200 rpm at 30ºC for the estimation of semi-aerobic conditions while 1/10 (liquid/flask

514

volume) for the aerobic conditions and then enlarged to 500 ml flasks. Additionally, we tested the

515

scale-up of fermentation volume to 1L, 3L, using a mini jar 5L fermentor (TSC-M5L; Takasugi

516

Seisakusho, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a DO controller (DJ-1033; ABLE Corporation, Tokyo,

517

Japan). The dissolved oxygen was adjusted automatically by the rotation speeds. Cells initially

518

harvested for fermentation with the same volume of pre-culture YPD medium for ~24 h. The

519

harvesting carried out by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min at 4ºC and washed with sterile water,

520

then collected cells were re-supplemented by the Yeast-Peptone (YP) medium with glucose, glycerol

521

or both, as shown in Figs. 2-4. Different initial concentrations tested to determine fermentation

522

abilities at those different initial concentrations as well as with the fed patch for an estimate the

523

maximum tolerance to the product under these unprecedented fermenting conditions. The cell

524

density monitored using spectrophotometry at 600 nm (AS ONE, China).

525

All analyses estimated using auto-sampling a 10 µl to fractionated in an Aminex HPX-87H

526

column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), analyzed in a refractive index detector (RID-

527

10A; Shimadzu) equipped to auto-sampled Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography (UFLC) (Shimadzu,

528

Japan). Fractionation accomplished with 0.6 ml/min of a mobile phase 5 mM H2SO4 at 50ºC.

529

Reactant concentrations were estimated by monitoring the peak areas compared with the standards

530

of the authentic reactant's glucose, glycerol, ethanol, and acetic acid.
