Abstract

2

SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV) that causes COVID-19, has recently emerged causing

3

an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While distinct from SARS-CoV, both

4

group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization, origins to bat CoVs, and an arsenal of

5

immune antagonists. In this report, we evaluate type-I interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-

6

CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2

7

maintains similar viral replication to SARS-CoV, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I.

8

In Vero and in Calu3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 is substantially attenuated in the context of IFN-I

9

pretreatment, while SARS-CoV is not. In line with these findings, SARS-CoV-2 fails to

10

counteract phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of ISG proteins, while SARS-CoV is able

11

to suppress both. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in human airway epithelial

12

cultures (HAEC), we observe the absence of IFN-I stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 alone, but detect

13

failure to counteract STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN-I pretreatment resulting in near ablation

14

of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we evaluated IFN-I treatment post infection and found SARS-

15

CoV-2 was sensitive even after establishing infection. Finally, we examined homology between

16

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonists. The absence

17

of an equivalent open reading frame (ORF) 3b and changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN-I

18

antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify

19

key differences in susceptibility to IFN-I responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that

20

may help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.

21

Importance

22

With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the original

23

SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options.

24

In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as

25

further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early during

26

infection.

Introduction

28

At the end of 2019, a cluster of patients in Hubei Province, China was diagnosed with a

29

viral pneumonia of unknown origins. With community links to the Huanan seafood market in

30

Wuhan, the disease cluster had echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

31

(SARS-CoV) outbreak that emerged at the beginning of the century (1). The 2019 etiologic

32

agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and subsequently renamed SARS-

33

CoV-2 (2). The new virus has nearly 80% nucleotide identity to the original SARS-CoV and the

34

corresponding CoV disease, COVID-19, has many of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV disease

35

including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung infiltration, and death in the most extreme

36

cases (3, 4). In addition, the most severe SARS-CoV-2 disease corresponded to old age (>50

37

years old), health status, and healthcare workers, similar to both SARS- and MERS-CoV (5).

38

Together, the results indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease have strong similarity to the

39

original SARS-CoV epidemic occurring nearly two decades earlier.

40

In the wake of the outbreak, major research efforts have sought to rapidly characterize

41

the novel CoV to aid in treatment and control. Initial modeling studies predicted (6) and

42

subsequent cell culture studies confirmed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human

43

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry, the same receptor as SARS-CoV (7, 8).

44

Extensive case studies indicated a similar range of disease onset and severe symptoms seen

45

with SARS-CoV (5). Notably, less severe SARS-CoV-2 cases have also been observed and

46

were not captured in the original SARS-CoV outbreak. Importantly, screening and treatment

47

guidance has relied on previous CoV data generated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

48

Treatments with both protease inhibitors and type-I interferon (IFN-I) have been employed (4);

49

similarly, remdesivir, a drug targeting viral polymerases, has been reported to have efficacy

50

against SARS-CoV-2 similar to findings with both SARS- and MERS-CoV (9-12). Importantly,

51

several vaccine efforts have been initiated with a focus on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the

52

major antigenic determinant (13). Together, the similarities with SARS-CoV have been useful in

53

responding to the newest CoV outbreak.

54

The host innate immune response is initiated when viral products are recognized by host

55

cell pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors

56

(RLRs) (14, 15). This response ultimately results in production of IFN-I and other cytokines,

57

which together are essential for an effective antiviral response (16). IFN-I then triggers its own

58

signaling cascade via its receptor, in an autocrine or paracrine manner, which induces

59

phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2.

60

Together, STAT1, STAT2, and a third transcription factor, IRF9, form the Interferon Stimulated

61

Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which is essential for induction of many IFN-stimulated genes

62

(ISGs), and ultimately elicit an effective antiviral response (17, 18). To establish productive

63

replication, viruses have developed different mechanisms to escape this antiviral response

64

targeting different parts of the IFN-I response machinery (19).

65

In this study, we further characterize SARS-CoV-2 and compare it to the original SARS-

66

CoV. Using Vero E6 cells, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication

67

kinetics as SARS-CoV following a low dose infection. In contrast, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is

68

significantly more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment as compared to SARS-CoV. Infection of IFN-I

69

competent Calu3 2B4 cells resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication compared to SARS-

70

CoV. Similar to Vero cells, Calu3 cells pretreated with IFN-I had a greater reduction of

71

replication of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. In human airway epithelial cultures, SARS-

72

CoV-2 showed robust replication and an absence of IFN-I stimulation contrasting influenza A

73

virus. However, pretreatment with IFN-I confirmed SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity and inability to

74

control IFN-I responses once initiated. These results suggest distinct changes between SARS-

75

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in terms of IFN-I antagonism and we subsequently examined sequence

76

homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that may be responsible for

77

these differences. Together, the results suggest SARS-CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to

78

control the IFN-I response as SARS-CoV.

Results

80

SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN-I pre-treatment

81

Our initial studies infected Vero E6 cells using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to

82

explore the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV. Following infection,

83

we found that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar kinetics, peaking 48

84

hours post infection (Fig. 1A). While SARS-CoV-2 titer was slightly lower than that of SARS-

85

CoV at 24 hours post infection, the results were not statistically different.

86

replication of both viruses had plateaued and significant cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed

87

for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Together, the results indicated that SARS-CoV

88

and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells.

By 48 hours,

89

We next evaluated the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I pretreatment. Treatment

90

with IFN-I (recombinant IFN-α) has been attempted as an antiviral approach for a wide variety of

91

pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses as well as HIV (20). During both the SARS and

92

MERS-CoV outbreaks, IFN-I has been employed with limited effect (21, 22). In this study, we

93

pretreated Vero E6 cells with 1000 U/mL of recombinant IFN-I (IFN-α) 18 hours prior to

94

infection. Vero E6 lack the capacity to produce IFN-I, but are able to respond to exogenous

95

treatment (23). Following pretreatment with IFN-I, SARS-CoV infection has a modest reduction

96

in viral titer of 1.5 log10 plaque forming units (PFU) as compared to untreated control 24 hours

97

post infection (Fig. 1A). However, by 48 hours, SARS-CoV has nearly equivalent viral yields as

98

the untreated conditions (7.2 log10PFU versus 7.5 log10PFU). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 shows a

99

significant reduction in viral replication following IFN-I treatment. At both 24 and 48 hours post

100

infection, SARS-CoV-2 had massive 3-log10 (24 HPI) and 4-log10 (48 HPI) drops in viral titer as

101

compared to control untreated cells. Together, the results demonstrate a clear sensitivity to a

102

primed IFN-I response in SARS-CoV-2, which is not observed with SARS-CoV.

103

To explore differences in IFN-I antagonism between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we

104

examined both STAT1 activation and IFN stimulated gene (ISG) expression following IFN-I

105

pretreatment and infection. Examining Vero cell protein lysates, we found that IFN-I treated cells

106

infected with SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylated STAT1 by 48 hours post infection (Fig. 1B).

107

SARS-CoV had no evidence of STAT1 phosphorylation in either IFN-I treated or untreated cells,

108

illustrating robust control over IFN-I signaling pathways. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 is unable to

109

control signaling upon IFN-I treatment. Examining further, IFITM1, a known ISG (17), had

110

increased protein expression in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection following IFN-I

111

pretreatment compared to SARS-CoV under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). Basal STAT1 levels

112

are reduced during SARS-CoV infection relative to uninfected control and to a lesser extent

113

during SARS-CoV-2, likely due to the mRNA targeting activity of non-structural protein 1 (NSP1)

114

(24). However, IFN-I treatment results in augmented protein levels for IFITM1 following SARS-

115

CoV-2 infection as compared to untreated SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, IFN-I treated SARS-CoV

116

had no significant increase in IFITM1 relative to control infection. Together, the STAT1

117

phosphorylation, ISG production, and viral protein levels indicate that SARS-CoV-2 lacks the

118

same capacity to modulate the IFN-I stimulated response as the original SARS-CoV.

119

SARS-CoV-2 attenuated in interferon competent cells.

120

While capable of responding to exogenous IFN-I, Vero cells lack the capacity to produce

121

IFN-I following infection which likely plays a role in supporting robust replication of a wide range

122

of viruses. To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 in a IFN-I responsive cell type, we infected Calu3 2B4

123

cells, a lung epithelial cell line sorted for ACE2 expression and previously used in coronavirus

124

and influenza research (25). Using an MOI of 1, we examined the viral replication kinetics of

125

SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV in Calu3 cells. We found that both SARS-CoV and SARS-

129

reduction) indicating a significant change in total viral titers between SARS-CoV and SARS-

130

CoV-2. Notably, no similar attenuation was observed in untreated Vero cells (Fig. 1A)

131

suggesting possible immune modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory cell line,

132

due to differential sensitivity to secreted IFN-I during infection. We next evaluated the

133

susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I pretreatment in Calu3 cells. When pretreating cells with

134

1000 U/mL of recombinant IFN-I 18 hours prior to infection, SARS-CoV infection has a modest

135

reduction in viral titer of ~0.8 log10 PFU as compared to untreated control at both 24 and 48

136

hours post infection (Fig. 2A). Similar to Vero cell results, SARS-CoV-2 shows a significant

137

reduction in viral replication following IFN-I treatment in Calu3 cells. At both 24 and 48 hours

138

post infection, SARS-CoV-2 had 2.65- log10 (24 HPI) and 2- log10 (48 HPI) drops in viral titer,

139

respectively, as compared to control untreated Calu3 cells. Together, the results demonstrate a

140

clear sensitivity to a primed IFN-I response in SARS-CoV-2, which is not observed with SARS-

141

CoV.

The attenuation in viral replication expands at 48 hours (1.4 log10

142

To further evaluate activation by IFN-I, we examined both STAT1 phosphorylation and

143

ISG expression following infection of Calu3 2B4 cells at 48 hours. Probing cell protein lysates,

144

we found that untreated cells infected with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylated

145

STAT1 by 48 hours post infection (Fig. 2B). However, the level of STAT1 is markedly

146

diminished in SARS-CoV infection as compared to SARS-CoV-2 suggesting the original

147

epidemic strain disrupts the expression of the ISG. The diminished STAT1 levels in SARS-CoV

148

correspond to robust spike expression in untreated cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 spike is

149

reduced as compared to SARS-CoV, consistent with lower replication observed in untreated

150

Calu3 cells (Fig. 2A). The noticeable IFITM1 expression levels observed in untreated Calu3

151

cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 that were not observed in Vero cells may signify higher ISG

152

levels in Calu3 cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may contribute to its attenuation relative

153

to SARS-CoV.

154

Following IFN-I pretreatment in Calu3 cells the differences in STAT1 activation and ISG

155

induction are less prominent compared the Vero experiments, likely due to an already induced

156

IFN-I response to the virus infection. However, we still found a reduction in STAT1

157

phosphorylation and ISG induction in IFN-I pretreated SARS-CoV versus SARS-CoV-2

158

infection. Total STAT1 levels were augmented in IFN-I treated cells following SARS-CoV

159

infection to values similar to control IFN-I treated cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 STAT1 levels

160

remained amplified relative to SARS-CoV, but were similar to untreated SARS-CoV-2 infection.

161

Although marginal, IFITM1 expression was slightly increased in IFN-I pretreatment SARS-CoV-

162

2 relative to SARS-CoV. Importantly, the spike protein levels show a significant impact of IFN-I

163

on SARS-CoV infection consistent with titer. For SARS-CoV-2, the spike blot demonstrates the

164

massive attenuation in the presence of IFN-I. Overall, the results in Calu3 cells are consistent

165

with Vero cell findings and indicate a significant sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I

166

pretreatment.

167

SARS-CoV-2 blocks IFN-I signaling in polarized human airway epithelial cultures.

168

Having established IFN-I sensitivity in Vero cells and Calu3 respiratory cell lines, we next sought

169

to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 in polarized human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC). These cultures

170

provide both the complexity of different cell types and the architecture of the human respiratory

171

epithelium. Previous work with SARS-CoV had already established its capacity to control the

172

IFN-I response in human airway cultures (26). Therefore, to examine the impact on overall level

173

of IFN-I signaling in HAECs, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection to influenza A virus (H1N1)

174

infection, known to induce robust innate immune responses in these cultures. Briefly, HAEC

175

were pretreated with IFN-α on the basolateral side prior to and during infection (Fig. 3A). Apical

washes were collected at multiple time points and analyzed for viral infectious titers by plaque

assay. In addition, culture lysates at endpoint were examined for STAT1 phosphorylation by

180

phosphorylated STAT1 48 hours post infection. In stark contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection alone

181

indicated no increase in STAT1 or phosphorylated STAT1. IFN-I pretreatment resulted in robust

182

induction of STAT1 and pSTAT1 in all cultures. Despite the distinct immune stimulation profiles

183

upon infection alone, both viruses robustly replicated in the HAEC, with influenza A virus

184

achieving higher viral yields as compared to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3C & 3D). Pretreatment

185

reduced influenza infection ~1.5 log10 at both 24 and 48 hours post infection, consistent with

186

previous reports (27). In contrast, IFN-I pretreatment nearly ablated SARS-CoV-2 with 2-log10

187

and 4-log10 reduction in viral titers at 24 and 48 hours relative to untreated controls. Together,

188

the results highlight the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent IFN-I signaling, but also

189

demonstrate the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I pretreatment.

190

SARS-CoV-2 impacted by IFN-I post treatment. Having established that SARS-CoV-2 cannot

191

overcome a pre-induced IFN-I state, we next evaluated the impact of IFN-I treatment post

192

infection. Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI 0.01 and

193

subsequently treated with 1000 U/mL IFN-α four hours post infection. For SARS-CoV, treatment

194

post infection had no significant impact on viral yields either 24 or 48 hours post infection,

consistent with findings from pretreatment experiments.

substantial 2-log10 reduction in viral titers at 24 hours post infection relative to control. However,

197

by 48 hours, SARS-CoV-2 replication had achieved similar level to untreated controls indicating

198

that post treatment had only a transient impact in Vero cells. We subsequently performed the

199

post-treatment experiment utilizing Calu3 respiratory cells at an MOI 1. Similar to Vero cells,

and expanded at 48 hours post (~4-log10 reduction). The results indicate that in Calu3 cells,

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in modulation of IFN-I pathways.

207

Conservation of IFN-I antagonists across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

208

Previous work has established several key IFN-I antagonists in the SARS-CoV genome,

209

including NSP1, NSP3, ORF3b, ORF6, and others (28). Considering SARS-CoV-2’s sensitivity

210

to IFN-I, we next sought to evaluate conservation of IFN-I antagonist proteins encoded by

211

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and several bat SARS-like viruses including WIV16-CoV (29),

212

SHC014-CoV (30), and HKU3.1-CoV (31). Using sequence analysis, we found several changes

213

to SARS-CoV-2 that potentially contribute to IFN-I sensitivity (Fig. 4). For SARS-CoV structural

214

proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M) protein, a high degree of sequence

215

homology (>90%AA identity) suggests that their reported IFN-I antagonism is likely maintained

216

in SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like viruses. Similarly, the ORF1ab poly-protein retains high

217

sequence identity in SARS-CoV-2 and several known IFN-I antagonists contained within the

218

poly-protein (NSP1, NSP7, NSP14-16) are highly conserved relative to SARS-CoV. One notable

219

exception is the large papain-like protease, NSP3, which is only 76% conserved between

220

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 does maintain a deubiquitinating domain

221

thought to confer IFN-I resistance (32). For SARS-CoV ORF3b, a 154 amino acid (AA) protein

222

known to antagonize IFN-I responses by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation (33), sequence

223

alignment indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 equivalent ORF3b contains a premature stop codon

224

resulting in a truncated 24 AA protein. Similarly, HKU3.1-CoV also has a premature termination

225

resulting in a predicted 39 AA protein. Both WIV16-CoV and SHC014-CoV, the most closely

Overall, the pre- and post-treatment data highlight distinct differences between

226

related bat viruses to SARS-CoV, encode longer 114 AA truncated protein with >99% homology

227

with SARS-CoV ORF3b suggesting that IFN-I antagonism might be maintained in these specific

228

group 2B CoV strains. In addition, SARS-CoV ORF6 has been shown to be an IFN-I antagonist

229

that disrupts karyopherin-mediated transportation of transcription factors like STAT1 (33, 34). In

230

contrast to ORF3b, all five surveyed group 2B CoVs maintain ORF6; however, SARS-CoV-2

231

had only 69% homology with SARS-CoV while the other three group 2B bat CoVs had >90%

232

conservation. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has a two amino acid truncation in its ORF6; previous

233

work has found that alanine substitution in this C-terminus of SARS-CoV ORF6 resulted in

234

ablated antagonism (34). Together, the sequence homology analysis suggests that differences

235

in NSP3, ORF3b, and/or ORF6 may be key drivers of SARS-CoV-2 IFN-I susceptibility.

236

Discussion

237

With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, viral characterization remains

a key factor in responding to the emergent novel virus. In this report, we describe differences in

239

the IFN-I sensitivity between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV. While both viruses

240

maintain similar replication in untreated Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 has a significant decrease

241

in viral protein and replication following IFN-I pretreatment. The decreased SARS-CoV-2

242

replication correlates with phosphorylation of STAT1 and augmented ISG expression largely

243

absent following SARS-CoV infection despite IFN-I pretreatment. Infection of IFN-I competent

244

Calu3 2B4 cells resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication relative to SARS-CoV; IFN-I

245

pretreatment also corresponded to increased sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 in Calu3 cells.

246

However, SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce IFN-I pathways during infection of unprimed polarized

247

HAEC as compared to influenza A virus, suggesting a capacity to control IFN-I signaling. Yet,

248

pretreatment nearly ablates replication of SARS-CoV-2 highlighting robust sensitivity to IFN-I

249

pathways once activated. Finally, SARS-CoV-2, unlike SARS-CoV, responded to post-infection

250

IFN-I treatment with reduced viral yields in both Vero and Calu3 cells. Analysis of viral proteins

251

finds SARS-CoV-2 has several changes that potentially impact its capacity to modulate the IFN-

252

I response, including loss of an equivalent ORF3b and a short truncation of ORF6, both known

253

as IFN-I antagonists for SARS-CoV (33). Together, our results suggest SARS-CoV and SARS-

254

CoV-2 have differences in their ability to antagonize the IFN-I response once initiated and that

255

this may have major implications for COVID-19 disease and treatment.

256

With a similar genome organization and disease symptoms in humans, the SARS-CoV-2

257

outbreak has drawn insights from the closely related SARS-CoV. However, the differences in

258

sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment illustrate a clear distinction between the two CoVs. Coupled with

259

a novel furin cleavage site (35), robust upper airway infection (8), and transmission prior to

260

symptomatic disease (36), the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could prove

261

important in disrupting the ongoing spread of COVID-19. For SARS-CoV, in vitro studies have

262

consistently found that wild-type SARS-CoV is indifferent to IFN-I pretreatment (37, 38).

263

Similarly, in vivo SARS-CoV studies have found that the loss of IFN-I signaling had no

264

significant impact on disease (39), suggesting that this virus is not sensitive to the antiviral

265

effects of IFN-I. However, more recent reports suggest that host genetic background may

266

majorly influence this finding (40). For SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that IFN-I pretreatment

267

produces a 3 - 4 log10 drop in viral titer. This level of sensitivity is similar to MERS-CoV and

268

suggests that the novel CoV lacks the same capacity to escape a primed IFN-I response as

269

SARS-CoV (41, 42). Notably, the sensitivity to IFN-I does not completely ablate viral replication;

270

unlike SARS-CoV 2’O methyl-transferase mutants (37), SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate to low,

271

detectable levels even in the presence of IFN-I. This finding could help explain positive test

272

results in patients with minimal symptoms and the range of disease observed. In addition, while

273

SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV employ

274

effective means to disrupt virus recognition and downstream signaling until late during infection

275

(25).

While SARS-CoV-2 may employ a similar mechanism early during infection, STAT1

276

phosphorylation and reduced viral replication are observed in IFN-I primed and post-treatment

277

conditions indicating that the novel CoV does not block IFN-I signaling as effectively as the

278

original SARS-CoV.

279

For SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity to IFN-I indicates a distinction from SARS-CoV and

280

suggests differential host innate immune modulation between the viruses. The distinct ORF3b

281

and truncation/changes in ORF6 could signal a reduced capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to interfere

282

with IFN-I responses. For SARS-CoV ORF6, the N-terminal domain has been shown to have a

283

clear role in its ability to disrupt karyopherin-mediated STAT1 transport (34); in turn, the loss or

284

reduction of ORF6 function for SARS-CoV-2 would likely render it much more susceptible to

285

IFN-I pretreatment as activated STAT1 has the capacity to enter the nucleus and induce ISGs

286

and the antiviral response. In these studies, we have found that following IFN-I pretreatment,

287

STAT1 phosphorylation is induced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The increase in ISG

288

proteins (STAT1, IFITM1) suggests that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 does not effectively block nuclear

289

transport as well as SARS-CoV ORF6. For SARS-CoV ORF3b, the viral protein has been

290

shown to disrupt phosphorylation of IRF3, a key transcriptional factor in the production of IFN-I

291

and the antiviral state (33). While its mechanism of action is not clear, the ORF3b absence in

292

SARS-CoV-2 infection likely impacts its ability to inhibit the IFN-I response and eventual STAT1

293

activation. Similarly, while NSP3 deubiquitinating domain remains intact, SARS-CoV-2 has a 24

294

AA insertion upstream of this deubiquitinating domain that could potentially alter that function

295

(32). While other antagonists are maintained with high levels of conservation (>90%), single

296

point mutations in key locations could modify function and contribute to increased IFN-I

297

sensitivity. Overall, the sequence analysis suggests that differences between SARS-CoV and

298

SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins may drive attenuation in the context of IFN-I pretreatment.

299

The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 suggests utility in treatment using IFN-I. While

300

IFN-I has been used in response to chronic viral infection (43), previous examination of SARS-

301

CoV cases found inconclusive effect for IFN-I treatment (44). However, the findings from the

302

SARS-CoV outbreak were complicated by combination therapy of IFN-I with other treatments

303

including ribavirin/steroids and lack of a regimented protocol. While IFN-I has been utilized to

304

treat MERS-CoV infected patients, no conclusive data yet exists to determine efficacy (45). Yet,

305

in vivo studies with MERS-CoV have found that early induction with IFN-I can be protective in

306

mice (46); importantly, the same study found that late IFN-I activation can be detrimental for

307

MERS-CoV disease (46). Similarly, early reports have described treatments using IFN-I in

308

combination for SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet the efficacy of these treatments and the parameters

309

of their use are not known (47). Overall, sensitivity data suggest that IFN-I treatment may have

310

utility for treating SARS-CoV-2 if the appropriate parameters can be determined. In addition, use

311

of type III IFN, which is predicted to have utility in the respiratory tract, could offer another

312

means for effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2.

313

In addition to treatment, the sensitivity to IFN-I may also have implications for animal

314

model development. For SARS-CoV, mouse models that recapitulate human disease were

315

developed through virus passage in immune competent mice (48). Similarly, mouse models for

316

MERS-CoV required adaptation in mice that had genetic modifications of their dipeptidyl-

317

peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV (49, 50). However, each of these MERS-CoV

318

mouse models still retained full immune capacity. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to IFN-I

319

may signal the need to use an immune deficient model to develop relevant disease. While initial

320

work has suggested incompatibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice based on receptor usage

321

(8), the IFN-I response may be a second major barrier that needs to be overcome. Similar to

322

the emergent Zika virus outbreak, the use of IFN-I receptor knockout mice or IFN-I receptor

323

blocking antibody may be necessary to develop a useful SARS-CoV-2 animal models for

324

therapeutic testing (51).

325

Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher sensitivity to type I IFN

326

than the previously emergent SARS-CoV. This augmented type I IFN sensitivity is likely due to

327

changes in viral proteins between the two epidemic CoV strains. Moving forward, these data

328

could provide important insights for both the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as well as developing

329

novel animal models of disease. In this ongoing outbreak, the results also highlight a distinction

330

between the highly related viruses and suggest insights from SARS-CoV must be verified for

331

SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

Methods

334

Viruses and cells. SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 was provided by the World Reference Center

335

for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) or BEI Resources and was originally

336

obtained from the USA Centers of Disease Control as described (52). SARS-CoV-2 and mouse-

337

adapted recombinant SARS-CoV (MA15) (48) were titrated and propagated on Vero E6 cells,

338

grown in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimytotic (Gibco). Calu3 2B4

339

cells were grown in DMEM with 10% defined fetal bovine serum, 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco),

340

and 1% antibiotic/antimitotic (Gibco). Standard plaque assays were used for SARS-CoV and

341

SARS-CoV-2 (26, 53). All experiments involving infectious virus were conducted at the

342

University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) or New York University School of Medicine

343

(New York City, NY) in approved biosafety level 3 (BSL) laboratories with routine medical

344

monitoring of staff.

345

Infection and type I IFN pre- and post-treatment. Viral replication studes in Vero E6 and

346

Calu3 2B4 cells were performed as previously described (37, 54). Briefly, cells were washed two

347

times with PBS and inoculated with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection

348

(MOI) 0.01 for 60 minutes at 37 °C. Following inoculation, cells were washed 3 times, and fresh

349

media was added to signify time 0. Three or more biological replicates were harvested at each

350

described time. No blinding was used in any sample collections, nor were samples randomized.

351

For type I IFN pretreatment, experiments were completed as previously described (37). Briefly,

352

Vero E6 cells were incubated with 1000 U/mL of recombinant type I IFN-α (PBL Assay

353

Sciences) 18 hours prior to infection (37). Cells were infected as described above and type I IFN

354

was not added back after infection.

356

hTert-immortalized human normal airway tracheobronchial epithelial cells, BCi.NS1.1 (55) were

357

maintained in ExPlus growth media (StemCell). To generate HAEC, BCi.NS1.1 were plated

358

(7.5E4 cells/well) on rat-tail collagen type 1-coated permeable transwell membrane supports

359

(6.5mm; Corning Inc), immersed in ExPlus growth media in both the apical and basal chamber.

360

Upon reaching confluency, media in the apical chamber was removed (airlift), and media in the

361

basal chamber was changed to Pneumacult ALI maintenance media (StemCell). Pneumacult

362

ALI maintenance media was changed every two days for approximately 6 weeks to form

363

differentiated, polarized cultures that resemble in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium.

IFN-I treatment and infection of HAEC.

365

For interferon pretreatment of human airway epithelial cultures, 1000 U/mL of universal

366

recombinant interferon-alpha was added to the basolateral chamber 2 h prior to viral infections.

367

For viral infections, cultures were washed apically with 50 µl of prewarmed PBS three times for

368

30 min at 37°C. Virus inoculates (1.3E6 PFU for influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus

369

and 1.35E5 PFU for SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA/1/2020 in 50 µl PBS Mg/Ca) were added apically for

370

two hours. Inoculates were then removed and cultures were washed three times with PBS, the

371

third wash was collected and then the cultures were incubated for the indicated times. Progeny

372

virus was collected in apical washes with 50 µl PBS Mg/Ca for 30 min at 8, 24 and 48 hpi

373

(endpoint). At endpoint, the membranes were collected and lysed in 300 µl LDS lysis buffer (Life

374

Technologies). Protein levels were measured by western blot. Briefly, 5 µl of cell lysates were

375

loaded into a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes

376

were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk and then incubated overnight at

377

4°C with appropriate primary antibody dilution: anti-STAT1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-

378

pSTAT1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling) or anti-beta actin (1:5000, Invitrogen). Then, the membranes

379

were incubated with the recommended dilution of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat

380

anti-rabbit IgG HRP 1:10000, Invitrogen; goat anti-mouse IgG HRP 1:10000, Invitrogen) at room

temperature for 1 h. Super Signal West Dura Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used for signal

382

development according to manufacturer’s recommendations and the chemiluminescence was

383

detected with a ChemiDoc Imager (BioRad).

384

Phylogenetic Tree and Sequence Identity Heat Map. Heat maps were constructed from a set

385

of representative group 2B coronaviruses by using alignment data paired with neighbor-joining

386

phylogenetic trees built in Geneious (v.9.1.5). Sequence identity was visualized using EvolView

387

(http://evolgenius.info/) and utilized SARS-CoV Urbani as the reference sequence. Tree shows

388

the degree of genetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV across selected group 2B

389

coronaviruses.

390

Immunoblot Analysis and Antibodies:

391

Viral and host protein analysis were evaluated as previously described (52, 56). Briefly, cell

392

lysates were resolved on 7.5% Mini-PROTEAN TGX SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to

393

polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-

394

Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in TBST (TBS with 0.1% (v/v)

395

Tween-20) for 1 hr, and then probed with the indicated primary antibody in 3% (w/v) BSA in

396

TBST at 4°C overnight. Following overnight incubation, membranes were probed with the

397

following secondary antibodies in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in TBST for 1 hr at room

398

temperature: anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugated antibody from sheep (both 1:10,000

399

GE Healthcare). Proteins were visualized using ECL or SuperSignal West Femto

400

chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and detected by autoradiography. The following primary

401

antibodies were used: anti-pSTAT1 (Y701) (1:1000 9171L Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-

402

STAT1 D1K9Y (1:1000 14994P Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-IFITM1 (1:1000 PA5-20989

403

Invitrogen), anti-SARS-CoV/CoV-2 Spike 1A9 (1:1000 GTX632604 GeneTex), and anti-β-Actin

404

(1:1000 ab8227 Abcam).

Statistical analysis. All statistical comparisons in this manuscript involved the comparison

406

between 2 groups, SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infected groups under equivalent conditions.
