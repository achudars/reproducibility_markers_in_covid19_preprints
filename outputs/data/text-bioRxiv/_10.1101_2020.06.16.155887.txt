Abstract
The current RT-qPCR assay recommended for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the United
States requires analysis of three genomic targets per sample: two viral and one host. To simplify
testing and reduce the volume of required reagents, we developed a multiplex RT-qPCR assay to
detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single reaction. We used existing N1, N2, and RP primer and probe sets
by the CDC, but substituted fluorophores to allow multiplexing of the assay. The cycle threshold
(Ct) values of our multiplex RT-qPCR were comparable to those obtained by the singleplex
assay adapted for research purposes. Low copies (>500 copies / reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
were consistently detected by the multiplex RT-qPCR. Our novel multiplex RT-qPCR improves
upon current singleplex diagnostics by saving reagents, costs, time and labor. (Word count: 125)

Introduction
The ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) and associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 7.5
million infections and killed more than 423,000 people as of June 14, 2020, and the virus
continues to spread throughout the globe [1]. In the absence of a specific vaccine or effective
therapy for the treatment of COVID-19, public health infection prevention measures, including
contact tracing and isolation measures, are currently our only tool to stem transmission.
However, testing, contact tracing and isolation measures require rapid and widespread testing.
Here, we developed a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for the detection
of SARS-CoV-2 to allow for more rapid and widespread testing.
While a number of primer and probe sets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by
RT-qPCR have become available since the identification of this novel virus, its broad
deployment has been hampered partially by the availability of testing reagents. The current RTqPCR assay developed by the CDC targets two different conserved segments of the viral
nucleocapsid gene (N1 and N2) as well as the human RNase P gene as a sampling control [2].
This protocol therefore requires 3 reactions to be performed per patient sample, which, in
addition to requiring a large amount of resources, also increases the chance for error. In an effort
to reduce reagents, time, potential error and labor per sample, we developed a multiplex RTqPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. To do this, we utilized the existing N1 and N2 primer
and probe sets published by the CDC; however, we substituted different fluorophores to enable
multiplexing. We found the accuracy and specificity of this method to be similar to singleplex
RT-qPCR. While there are commercially available tests that employ multiplex PCR, their
methods remain proprietary to the companies and are not published. Important consideration in

this regard is the such tests are cost prohibitive in low and middle income countries in which
COVID-19 pandemic is spreading. Therefore, this novel multiplex RT-qPCR assay provides the
first publicly available multiplex PCR protocol, which provides equivalent diagnostic accuracy
to current singleplex methods in fewer reactions and utilizes less reagents and time.

Materials and Methods
Clinical samples
Clinical samples from Yale-New Haven Hospital COVID-19 diagnosed inpatients and health
care workers were collected as part of Yale‚Äôs project IMPACT biorepository. RNA was extracted
from nasopharyngeal and saliva samples using the MagMax Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid
Isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to a modified protocol
[3].

Control samples
Full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA (WA1_USA strain from University of Texas Medical Branch
(UTMB); GenBank: MN985325) [4] was used as positive control for validation. Total RNA
extracted from human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was used for detection of internal host
gene control.

Singleplex and multiplex RT-qPCR
All reactions were performed on a CFX96 Touch instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
using Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A final reaction volume of 20 Œºl containing 5 Œºl

template was used. The following cycling conditions were applied; a cDNA synthesis 10
min/55‚ÑÉ, a hold step 1 min/95‚ÑÉ, and subsequently 45 cycles of denaturation 10 s/95‚ÑÉ and
annealing/elongation 30 s/55‚ÑÉ. Nuclease-free water was used as the non-template control. The
primer pairs and probes for single- and multiplex RT-qPCR are shown in Table 1. We calculated
analytic efficiency of RT-qPCR assays tested with full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the

Results
Determination of lower limit of virus concentration detected by multiplex RT-qPCR
The limit of detection (LOD) was analyzed using 10-fold serially diluted full-length
SARS-CoV-2 RNA into RNA extracted from pooled nasopharyngeal swabs from COVIDuninfected research participants. The Ct values and detection rates are shown in Table 2. The
slope of the standard curves for N1 and N2 were -3.36 and -3.52, respectively. The amplification
efficiency was above 90% for both primer probe sets (Figure 1). All primer-probe sets and
conditions were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 at 500 virus copies per reaction (Table 2).

Comparison of performance of multiplex and singleplex RT-qPCR
To confirm the specificity of the primer-probe sets (FAM, HEX, and Cy5
fluorophores) either tested as single or multiplex reactions, as well as in comparison to the
original singleplex assay (FAM), we used nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples from patients
to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The Ct values generated by the multiplex RT-qPCR were similar

with FAM only or multi-color of singleplex RT-qPCR (Figure 2 and Table 3). These data
indicated that our RT-qPCR with multicolor fluorophores under single- and multiplex conditions
has similar performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the currently utilized
singleplex RT-qPCR.

Comparison of single- and multiplex assay sensitivity with clinical samples
To evaluate the accuracy of our RT-qPCR multiplex assay, we tested RNA extracted
from nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples obtained from COVID-19-positive hospitalized
patients and COVID-19-uninfected health care workers. Total of 42 samples included 34
COVID-19-positive inpatients and 8 uninfected health care workers. The results of our multiplex
RT-qPCR were 100% sensitive as compared with singleplex RT-qPCR (Figure 3 and Table 4).
These data show that our multiplex RT-qPCR method could provide an alternative to the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 by currently published singleplex methods.

Discussion
We developed a multiplex RT-qPCR for molecular diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2
by improving on an existing research singleplex RT-qPCR method using the CDC primer-probe
sets. This multiplex RT-qPCR approach simultaneously detected the CDC-recommended two
gene segments of the SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2) and the internal control human RNase P gene in
a single reaction for research purposes. This method performed as well as the singleplex RTqPCR with clinical samples and was very specific for detecting all target genes. Generally, an
important consideration for this multiplex RT-qPCR approach is that cycling conditions may
vary depending on qPCR machines, sample type and target gene. We therefore recommend that

when implementing new assays, primer and probe concentrations should be optimized to
individual lab conditions.
The US CDC primer and probe sets for COVID-19 testing are recommended for
clinical testing in the US [2]. We reported sensitivity of US CDC primer and probe sets
compared with others; China CDC [5], Charit√© Institute of Virology, Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin
[6] and Hong Kong University [7]. In singleplex RT-qPCR, CDC N2 primer set has a lower
detection capability than CDC N1 primers [8]. Our multiplex RT-qPCR assay also showed that
N1 and N2 primer-probe set were 60 % and 25 % detection in 50 copies per reaction,
respectively (Table 2).
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already claimed the lives of over 400,000 people, and
halted the global economy and changed our daily lives worldwide. A rapid and accurate
diagnosis that is not cost prohibitive to test for infected individuals is urgently needed. Our
multiplex RT-qPCR protocol described in this study provides rapid and highly sensitive
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for research purposes. In the future, FDA approval of such
multiplex PCR technique for clinical testing could provide a cost effective solution to mass
testing.
