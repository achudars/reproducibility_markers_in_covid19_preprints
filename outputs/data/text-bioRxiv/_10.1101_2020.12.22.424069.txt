ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2,
has led to substantial morbidity, mortality and disruption globally. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the viral spike
protein and affinity ligands to this surface protein have the potential for applications as antivirals and diagnostic reagents.
Here, we describe the affinity selection of cyclic peptide ligands
to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain
(RBD) from three distinct libraries (in excess of a trillion molecules each) by mRNA display. We identified six high affinity
molecules with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar
range (15-550 nM) to the RBD. The highest affinity ligand could
be used as an affinity reagent to detect spike protein in solution
by ELISA, and the co-crystal structure of this molecule bound
to the RBD demonstrated that it binds to a cryptic binding site,
displacing a E-strand near the C-terminus. Our findings provide
key mechanistic insight into the binding of peptide ligands to
the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the ligands discovered in this
work may find future use as reagents for diagnostic applications.

Oxford University and AstraZeneca) have completed phase III
clinical trials and demonstrated a favorable safety profile and
promising efficacy.1-3 In addition to the requirement for a vaccine, effective antiviral drugs are also critically needed for
COVID-19 treatment; these drugs will be particularly important for use in unvaccinated individuals, in cases where the
efficacy of a vaccine wanes or the virus develops resistance to
vaccine-induced responses.4
While several candidate antiviral molecules are already in clinical trials, none were developed specifically for treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, even the most promising of
these, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir and type I interferon therapy, have been deemed

Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with the severe
acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), has led to widespread morbidity and mortality and has resulted in crippling effects on the global economy. At the time of
writing there had been > 77 million confirmed cases of COVID19 and >1.7 million deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Since the first reported case of COVID-19 in the province
of Hubei, China in December 2019, there has been an intense
global research effort centered on the development of an effective vaccine for the control of the disease. Very recently, two
mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, respectively) and a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, from

ineffective or only modestly efficacious in clinical trials.5-13
Thus, in addition to investigations into the repurposing of existing drugs, there is an urgent need for the development of
novel molecules that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 for the
treatment of COVID-19. These molecules may also find use for
immediate deployment in situations where SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, including for pre-exposure prophylaxis in
high-risk populations, or for further SARS-CoV outbreaks, e.g.
through future zoonoses.
The critical initiating step in viral infection involves entry of
SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, a process that is mediated by interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the
viral spike protein with cell-surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Figure 1).14 Crystal structures of RBD-ACE2
complexes have elucidated the mechanism of this interaction
and shown that the RBD-binding site on ACE2 is located on an
N-terminal helical region, distinct from the catalytic site (Figure 1).15, 16 Importantly, it has recently been demonstrated that
blocking this interaction (through addition of either soluble
RBD protein or soluble ACE2 protein) potently inhibits viral infection of cultured cells in a dose dependent manner.17-19 These
data provided early evidence that the RBD-ACE2 interaction
was a valid target for the development of novel antivirals
against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several approaches have since
been adopted for the discovery of novel RBD binding ligands,
including full antibodies,20-28 as well as antibody fragments
such as VH domains,29, 30 nanobodies31-35 and monobodies.36 In
addition, engineered ACE2 mimetics/decoy receptors,37-39 de
novo designed miniproteins,40, 41 peptide-based ACE2 mimetics42, 43 and synthetic peptide libraries44 have also been reported that are capable of binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD.
Macrocyclic peptides are a class of molecules demonstrated to
be highly effective at disrupting protein-protein interactions,
particularly in cases such as the spike-ACE2 interaction where
a defined binding pocket is lacking.45-54 In this work we explored this chemotype for the development of SARS-CoV-2
RBD-binding molecules that block the spike-ACE2 interaction,

with a view to discovering novel inhibitors of viral entry. To
discover novel cyclic peptides we employed cyclic peptide
mRNA display, an approach that enables the generation of libraries of >1012 macrocyclic peptides that can be subsequently
selected against the target of interest, in our case the RBD of
the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1).
Results and Discussion
To identify ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we performed
three parallel affinity selections using very high diversity macrocyclic peptide libraries (Figure 2A). Two of these were genetically reprogrammed Random non-standard Peptide Integrated Discovery (RaPID) libraries, comprising thioetherclosed macrocyclic peptides (one initiated with N-chloroacetylL-tyrosine and one initiated with N-chloroacetyl-D-tyrosine).
The third comprised disulfide-closed macrocyclic peptides. In
each case, a semi-random DNA library was transcribed into
mRNA, followed by covalent ligation to puromycin and in vitro
translation to yield a cyclic peptide-mRNA fusion library in excess of 1012 unique molecules. Following counter selection (to
remove streptavidin ligands), each library was panned against
biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD immobilized on streptavidin
beads, and an enriched DNA library was recovered by RT-PCR.
After seven iterative rounds of this process, the final DNA library was sequenced to identify peptide ligands predicted to
bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with high affinity (see Supporting Information). From this sequencing we chose nine diverse and
enriched peptides for further evaluation: three L-tyrosine initiated, three D-tyrosine initiated, and three disulfide closed cyclic
peptides (Figure 2B).
The nine target cyclic peptides 1-9 were subsequently synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Specifically, the
target peptide sequences were first assembled on Rink amide
resin using Fmoc-strategy SPPS (Scheme 1). For peptides 1-6
the N-termini were derivatized with chloroacetic acid (Scheme
1A), while the N-terminal methionine was N-acetylated in 7-9
(Scheme 1B). Each of the peptides was subsequently cleaved

Figure 2. A) Schematic of the cyclic peptide mRNA display technology used. DNA libraries incorporating 4-15 randomized NNS (N
= A, C, G, or T; S = C or G) codons were transcribed into mRNA, covalently ligated to puromycin (to allow conjugation between each
mRNA and its cognate peptide), translated in in vitro reactions and reverse transcribed to afford very high diversity (>1012 molecules) peptide-mRNA:cDNA libraries. Iterative rounds of affinity selection against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein followed
by recovery of the DNA by PCR and re-synthesis of the peptide-mRNA:cDNA library were conducted to enrich for SARS-COV-2 RBD
ligands. In two libraries, the initiating N-formyl-methionine residue was genetically reprogrammed to N-chloroacetyl-L-tyrosine or
N-chloroacetyl-D-tyrosine (DY), which spontaneously cyclizes to a downstream cysteine residue to form a thioether. A third library
included an additional cysteine residue affording cyclic peptides through disulfide formation. B) Sequence alignment of the nine

With the synthetic cyclic peptides 1-9 in hand, we next assessed the ability of each to bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
spike protein using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Briefly,
RBD was expressed and purified before immobilizing onto a
CM5 SPR chip using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry
according to the manufacturerโs protocol (see Supporting Information). Of the nine cyclic peptides screened, the six N-chloroacetylated peptides all exhibited high affinity for the RBD
with dissociation constants (KD) in the nanomolar range (KD =
12 โ 550 nM, Table 1, see Supporting Information for SPR sensorgrams). The highest affinity of these was peptide 4, with an
observed KD = 15 nM against RBD and a markedly low rate of
dissociation (koff = 1.4 x 10-3 s-1). Interestingly, this molecule is
a higher affinity cyclic analogue of a linear RBD ligand recently
identified through an affinity selection-mass spectrometry approach.44 Peptide 5 was also notable in the series with a KD =
76 nM against the RBD. The disulfide-closed peptides showed
very high apparent RBD affinity, but also strong non-specific
binding (data not shown). Based on these data we selected peptides 4 and 5 for assessment of antiviral activity against SARSCoV-2.

from resin with concomitant side chain deprotection by treatment with an acidic cocktail. It should be noted that, despite
significant optimization of the solid-phase synthesis, the precursor linear peptides to 5 and 7 were generated with significant sequence truncations (as judged by LC-MS analysis after
the cleavage step); these peptides were also poorly soluble in
both aqueous media and organic solvents. We therefore chose
to re-synthesize these two sequences with a hexaethyleneglycol solubility tag on the C-terminus. Given that the RaPID peptides were panned on the RBD bearing a large mRNA tag on the
C-terminus, we were confident that this modification would
not influence the binding affinity to the RBD55, 56 (Scheme 1).
For the thioether-linked peptides 1-6, the linear peptide precursors were cyclized by treatment with Hรผnigโs base in DMSO
or acetonitrile/water mixtures (depending on the solubility of
the linear peptides, see Supporting Information). In contrast,
the disulfide-linked cyclic peptides 7-9 were generated
through oxidation of the linear cleaved peptides by incubating
in aqueous ammonium bicarbonate. Purification of each of the
macrocyclic peptide targets by reverse-phase HPLC afforded 19 in 2-14% yield over the iterative SPPS and cyclization steps.

thioether cyclic peptide targets 1-6 and B) disulfide linked cyclic peptide targets 7-9.

The antiviral activity of 4 and 5 was assessed in VeroE6 cells
using high content fluorescence microscopy. Briefly, the cyclic
peptides and SARS-CoV-2 were pre-incubated for 1 h and then
co-incubated with VeroE6 cells for 72 h (MOI 0.5) within 384well plates. SARS-CoV-2 infection under these conditions leads
to viral cytopathic effects (CPE) and cell loss that is correlated
to the level of available infectious virus in the initial inoculum.
Addition of inhibitors that bind the RBD of the spike protein,
thus preventing interactions with cell surface ACE2, e.g. monoclonal antibodies, reduce CPE/cell loss in a dose dependent
manner.20-22 To enumerate the reduction of CPE in high content, live cell nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 (NucBlue) and then the entire 384-well plate imaged (see Supporting Information). Nuclei were then counted in high content using InCarta image analysis software used to give a quantitative
measure of cytopathic effect (see Supporting Information). Unfortunately, despite their nM affinities for RBD, neither 4 nor 5
showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 up to a concentration of 10 PM. Additionally, no inhibition was seen in a SARSCoV-2 pseudovirion neutralization assay at peptide concentrations of up to 50 ฮผM (see Supporting Information). These data

were corroborated by biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments, in which 4 and 5 were unable to disrupt the interaction
between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (see Supporting Information).
Although disappointed with the lack of antiviral activity of the
RBD-binding cyclic peptides, we rationalized that the affinity of
the peptides could instead prove useful for detection of the
spike protein. In order to assess this possibility, we developed
an ELISA-based detection assay for the full spike ectodomain
and the spike RBD. Peptides 4 and 5 were first re-synthesized
bearing a C-terminal biotin tag (see Supporting Information).
ELISA plates were first coated with BD-218, a neutralizing
monoclonal antibody identified from a COVID-19 patient.28 Either spike ectodomain trimer or RBD alone was captured and
then detected with biotinylated 4 or 5 and HRP-conjugated
streptavidin (Figure 3A). In a second strategy, ELISA plates
were directly coated with spike or RBD protein and antigen detected as above (Figure 3B). Gratifyingly, detection of both the
RBD and spike ectodomain was possible with biotinylated 4
and 5, however 5 had substantial non-specific binding, as evidenced by detection of unrelated protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). In further quantitative assays, biotinylated 4 allowed detection of spike ectodomain trimer at concentrations
as low as 30 ng mL-1 (see Supporting Information).

Figure 3. Detection of the spike ectodomain or the spike RBD
from SARS-CoV-2 using biotinylated variants of 4 and 5 by
ELISA. A) Antigen capture ELISA. Plate was coated with antibody BD-218, blocked with BSA, then spike or RBD (1 ฮผg mL-1)
was captured and detected with biotinylated 4 and 5. B) Direct
ELISA. Plate was coated with spike ectodomain or RBD (1 ฮผg
mL-1), blocked with BSA, and viral antigen detected with biotinylated 4 and 5. Individual data points for technical triplicates
are shown, with SEM.
Finally, we sought to understand the mechanism by which peptide 4 binds to the RBD. To this end, we obtained crystals of the
RBD-4 complex and solved the structure of the complex by Xray crystallography to a resolution of 3.96 ร (Figure 4; PDB
code 7L4Z). Despite the relatively low resolution, we could
identify the binding site of peptide 4, which lay near the clearly
N- and C-termini of the RBD (Figure 4B and Figure S7). Unexpectedly, the peptide binds to a cryptic region of the RBD by
displacing a C-terminal E-strand of the domain (523TVCG526)
with residues 5VVYG8 of the peptide, which adopt essentially
the same backbone conformation and make corresponding

interactions with the RBD. Interestingly, a similar motif is observed in a linear RBD peptide ligand (1TVFG4; Figure 4C) that
was previously identified by affinity selection-mass spectrometry by Pentelute and co-workers.44 Ala mutagenesis of this 13residue linear peptide highlighted the importance of the motif,
particularly residues Val2 and Gly4, which are also present in
the sequences of both the RBD C-terminus and peptide 4. It is
therefore tempting to speculate that a similar mode of binding
for RBD would be observed for the linear peptide that was discovered through an independent affinity selection method.

of the RBD undergoes a similar rearrangement to what we observe in our RBD-4 crystal structure. Moreover, conformational changes in the regions directly flanking the RBD domain
would also be required, as the helix formed by peptide 4 residues 9YNAWIR14 would otherwise clash with these regions. Although peptide 4 could differentially detect spike when the latter was immobilized either by direct adsorption or indirectly
via BD-218 antibody capture (Figure 3), we were unable to detect an interaction between 4 and spike using SPR under the
conditions tested (see Supporting Information). Together,
these data suggest that spike may undergo conformational
changes that expose the peptide-binding site when directly immobilized onto plates, and that 4 may therefore be useful in detecting full-length spike using ELISA-based approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have shown the utility of cyclic peptide mRNA
display for the discovery of high affinity ligands to a viral glycoprotein, specifically the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We
identified six peptides that bind to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein with nanomolar dissociation constants, including
two with KD values <100 nM. While these peptides were unable
to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, we identified a 15residue cyclic peptide (4) which was capable of selectively and
quantitatively detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD protein in an
ELISA-based detection assay. Moreover, we solved the structure of 4 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. The unexpected binding mode of the cyclic peptide adjacent to the Nand C-termini of the domain suggests that significant structural
reorganization of the spike protein would be necessary to accommodate the ligand. The binding of the ligand distal to the
ACE2 binding site of the RBD explains the lack of antiviral activity of the cyclic peptide. Importantly, while there have been
more than 120 structures of RBD-ligand complexes deposited
in the protein data bank over the past 12 months, this represents the first structure of a peptide complexed with the domain, and the first structure of a ligand bound in this cryptic
site. This binding mode is likely made possible by the small size
of cyclic peptide 4 that enables it to access the compact site on
the RBD. A similar binding mode would be difficult to achieve
with ACE2 mimics, antibody and antibody fragments that have
been the primary focus of RBD- and spike-binding ligands to
date. Future work in our laboratories will capitalize on the
unique binding mode discovered here by investigating cyclic
peptide 4 (and analogues thereof) as easily accessible and
cheap reagents for use in rapid, reproducible and simple
ELISA-based quantitation of virally expressed SARS-CoV-2
spike protein in patient or environmental samples. Furthermore, the location of this new binding site adjacent to a recently discovered fatty acid binding pocket on the SARS-CoV-2
RBD raises the interesting possibility of designing lipid-linked
variants of 4 (Figure 4D).57 This hybridization approach may
lead to molecules that possess improved affinity for the spike
RBD, as well as antiviral activity.
