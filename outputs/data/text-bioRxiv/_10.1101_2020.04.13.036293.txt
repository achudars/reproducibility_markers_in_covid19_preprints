Abstract:
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to infect humans via the
dromedary camel reservoir and can transmit between humans, most commonly via nosocomial
transmission. Currently, no licensed vaccine is available. Previously we showed that vaccination
of transgenic mice with ChAdOx1 MERS, encoding the MERS S protein, prevented disease
upon lethal challenge. In the current study we show that rhesus macaques seroconverted rapidly
after a single intramuscular vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS. Upon MERS-CoV challenge
vaccinated animals were protected against respiratory injury and pneumonia and had a reduction
in viral load in lung tissue of several logs. Furthermore, we did not detect MERS-CoV
replication in type I and II pneumocytes of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals. A prime-boost
regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS boosted antibody titers, and viral replication was completely absent
from the respiratory tract tissue of these rhesus macaques. Finally, we investigated the ability of
ChAdOx1 MERS to protect against six different MERS-CoV strains, isolated between 2012 to
2018, from dromedary camels and humans in the Middle East and Africa. Antibodies elicited by
ChAdOx1 MERS in rhesus macaques were able to neutralize all MERS-CoV strains.
Vaccination of transgenic hDPP4 mice with ChAdOx1 MERS completely protected the animals
against disease and lethality for all different MERS-CoV strains. The data support further clinical
development of ChAdOx1 MERS supported by CEPI.

Introduction
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012 and has
since infected >2400 people. The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection in humans varies
from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease and death. Patients present with influenza-like
symptoms such as a fever and shortness of breath. Thereafter, they may develop pneumonia and
may require mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. The case-fatality rate of
MERS-CoV infection is currently 34.5% (1).
Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is relatively limited and occurs mainly in
nosocomial settings but has been reported in local communities as well (2). In 2015, a traveler
from the Middle East to South Korea caused an outbreak involving 186 people and 38 fatalities
(3). The nosocomial outbreak lasted from May to July, and 16,752 people were isolated with
MERS-CoV-like symptoms. At least three superspreaders were identified in the outbreak, who
infected 28, 85 and 23 patients respectively (4). The introduction and spread of MERS-CoV in
South Korea underscores the potential of this virus to cause epidemics outside of the Arabian
Peninsula. MERS-CoV has continued to cause disease in humans and so far in 2019, 199 cases
have been reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), of which 24% were fatal (1). The
ongoing circulation of MERS-CoV and subsequent outbreaks in the human population highlight
the need of an efficient MERS-CoV vaccine.
MERS-CoV is mainly prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, with the majority of cases occurring in
KSA (84%) (5). However, phylogenetically diverse MERS-CoV strains have been isolated from
Africa and the Middle East (6-8) and antigenic differences have been reported between spike (S)
proteins, the main antigen utilized in MERS-CoV vaccines, from the Middle East and Africa (7).
Thus, it is important that a MERS-CoV vaccine is protective against a variety of diverse MERSCoV strains.
Thus far, only four vaccines have been tested in rhesus macaques. These are a DNA vaccine (9),
a vaccine based on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV S adjuvanted with
alum (10), a combination of S plasmid DNA and S1 protein (11), and virus-like particles based
on MERS-CoV S, matrix, and envelope proteins (12). Of the four vaccine studies, only three
studies included challenge studies, all of which used MERS-CoV isolates from 2012. To date
there have been no reports of efficacy of a single-dose MERS-CoV vaccine in NHPs.

We recently demonstrated that vaccination of mice with a replication-deficient simian
adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAd) encoding full-length MERS-CoV S protein (ChAdOx1
MERS) elicited high-titer MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and a robust CD8+ T cell response
against the S protein (13). In addition, ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination resulted in full protection of
human DPP4 transgenic mice against a lethal challenge with MERS-CoV (14). ChAdOx1 MERS
vaccination of dromedary camels was immunogenic and reduced MERS-CoV shedding after
challenge in a natural transmission model (15). ChAd-vectored vaccines against malaria, HIV,
influenza, hepatitis C, tuberculosis, Ebola, and others show an excellent immunogenicity and
safety profile in humans. In the current manuscript, we show that a single dose of ChAdOx1
MERS vaccine protects rhesus macaque model against a mucosal challenge with HCoVEMC/2012. Serum obtained from vaccinated rhesus macaques was able to neutralize six diverse
MERS-CoV strains. Furthermore, a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine protects hDPP4
transgenic mice against all evaluated MERS-CoV strains.
Results
ChAdOx1 MERS elicits a productive immune response in rhesus macaques
Three groups of six animals each were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS via a prime-boost
regimen (-56 DPI and -28 DPI) or prime-only regimen (-28 DPI) or with ChAdOx1 GFP (-56
DPI and -28 DPI). Animals were then challenged with 7 x 106 TCID50 HCoV-EMC/2012 on 0
DPI via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular route (16). Blood samples were taken
at days of vaccination, 14 days post each vaccination, and at challenge (Figure 1A). The humoral
immune response to vaccination was examined by ELISA using S protein as well as by virus
neutralization assay. S protein-specific IgG antibodies were detected as early as 14 days post
vaccination in both ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated groups. All animals in these groups had Sprotein-specific antibodies at 0 DPI, whereas no antibodies against S protein were found before
vaccination, or at any time in the ChAdOx1 GFP vaccinated group (Figure 1B). Neutralizing
antibodies were detected in 11 out of 12 ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals at time of
challenge. One animal in the prime-only vaccination group did not have detectable neutralizing
antibodies at this time and had the lowest antibody titer as measured by ELISA (1600) (Figure
1C). A second ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination at -28 DPI resulted in a statistically significant
increase in S protein-specific ELISA titer (mean titer -28 DPI = 1867; 0 DPI = 10,667;

P<0.0001) and neutralizing antibody titer (mean titer -28 DPI = 28; 0 DPI = 160; P<0.0001) as
determined via Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparisons test, even though neutralizing antibodies against
the ChAdOx1 vector could be detected at the time of the second vaccination (Figure S1A). This
suggests that the presence of neutralizing antibodies against ChAdOx1 does not prevent the
vaccine vector from boosting the immune response.

Vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS reduces disease severity
Animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP and challenged with MERS-CoV showed similar
clinical signs as previously reported (16), such as a decreased appetite and increased respiratory
rate. Clinical signs were scored using a standard non-human primate scoring sheet, focusing on

areas such as general appearance, nasal discharge and food intake. On average, ChAdOx1 MERS
vaccinated animals had a lower clinical score than ChAdOx1 GFP vaccinated animals (Figure
2A). All animals underwent exams on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 DPI. No significant changes in weight or
body temperature were observed for the duration of the study. Peripheral capillary oxygen
saturation (spO2) measurements supported a decrease in oxygen saturation from the baseline in
ChAdOx1 GFP vaccinated animals, but not in ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals (Figure 2B).

compared to ChAdOx1 GFP vaccinated animals. (A) Animals were evaluated daily and clinical score
assessed using an established scoring sheet. (B) Changes in oxygen saturation from pre-inoculation values

p-value<0.01; *** = p-value<0.001; **** = p-value<0.0001.

Ventrodorsal and lateral thoracic radiographs were collected on all exam days. All animals
vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP showed moderate to severe pulmonary interstitial infiltrations,
whereas animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS showed only mild signs of respiratory
disease. A severe collapsed lung was observed on 3 DPI in two animals in the prime-boost
group, likely caused by the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed on 1 DPI. Full details of all
observed signs can be found in Table S2. (Figure 3A, Table S2). All lung lobes (right cranial,
right middle, right caudal, left cranial, left middle, left caudal) of each individual animal were
scored for severity of disease signs for each day radiographs were taken, and average scores were
compared. Scores obtained from animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP were significantly
higher from animals vaccinated with a prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS on 3, 5, and 6
DPI (Figure 3B).

Upon necropsy on 6 DPI, gross lung lesions were more prevalent in animals vaccinated with
ChAdOx1 GFP than animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS (Figure 3C-D). Animals
vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP showed focally extensive areas of consolidation in all lung lobes
and lungs generally failed to collapse. Mediastinal lymph nodes were often edematous and
enlarged. Animals that received a vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS, either via a prime-boost or
prime-only regimen, had either no lesions or limited small multifocal areas of consolidation and
congestion.
An increased lung:body weight ratio is an indicator of pulmonary edema. Animals in the control
group had significantly higher lung:body weight ratios compared to ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated
animals and there was minimal difference between prime-boost and prime-only ChAdOx1
MERS vaccinated animals (Figure 3F).
Lung tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with MERS-CoV specific
antibodies. All slides were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to study
group allocations. In animals which received a vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS, either primeboost or prime-only, a minimal to mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia was present characterized
by mild thickening of alveolar septae by lymphocytes and macrophages. Pulmonary vessels were
bound by moderate numbers of lymphocytes. In stark contrast, in lung tissue obtained from
animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP, moderate to marked bronchointerstitial pneumonia was
present throughout the lung lobes characterized by thickening of the alveolar septae by
lymphocytes and macrophages, edema and fibrin. Alveoli contained abundant edema and fibrin
and moderate to abundant numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and necrotic debris.
Inflammation often surrounded bronchioles and pulmonary vasculature and type II pneumocyte
hyperplasia was prominent. Additionally, presence of MERS-CoV antigen by
immunohistochemistry was found only in lungs of animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP
within type I & II pneumocytes and was not found in lung tissue of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated
animals. Severity of bronchointerstitial pneumonia, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and
hemorrhages, edema, and fibrin deposits was scored. Statistically significant differences between
animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS or ChAdOx1 GFP were found for all three categories.
(Figure 3E, F, H). Thus, vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS, either via a prime-boost regimen or
prime-only regimen, significantly decreased the severity of pulmonary pathology and protected
rhesus macaques against bronchointerstitial pneumonia.

Vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS limits virus replication in the respiratory tract
BAL was performed on all animals on 1, 3, 5 and 6 DPI and the amount of viral RNA, mRNA
and infectious virus was determined. In the prime-boost group, infectious virus was only
detected at 1 DPI (N=3) after inoculation, and in the prime-only group at 1 DPI (N=6) and 3 DPI
(N=3) but not thereafter. In contrast, infectious virus was detected on all days in BAL fluid from
the control group (Figure 4A). Viral mRNA in BAL fluid of animals in the prime-boost group
was only detected at 1 DPI (N=5) and 3 DPI (N=1). In contrast, viral mRNA in BAL fluid from
animals who received a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS mRNA was detected on all
days, but the amount was reduced compared to animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP (Figure
S1B). Viral RNA as measured by UpE qRT-PCR assay could be detected in all groups up to 6
DPI. However, the number of genome copies/mL detected was lower in animals vaccinated with
ChAdOx1 MERS compared to animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP (Figure 4A). A
significant association was found between higher ELISA titer or VN titer and lower levels of
viral RNA, mRNA or infectious virus in BAL fluid for all days, except 6 DPI for infectious virus
(Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficient, Table S2).
All animals were euthanized on 6 DPI and tissues were analyzed for the presence of viral RNA,
mRNA or infectious virus. Infectious virus titers were only found in nasal turbinate tissue (N=1)
and lung lobe tissue (N=4) from control animals. No viral mRNA was found in all tissues
obtained from animals that received a prime-boost regimen. In tissue from animals that received
a prime-only regimen, limited viral mRNA could be found in upper and lower lung lobe tissues

(N=4). In contrast, mRNA could be found in respiratory tract tissues of all control animals, as
well as in conjunctiva (Figure 4B). Viral RNA was detected in tissues from all groups but was
mainly found in lung lobes and bronchi. Viral load was higher for lower respiratory tract tissue
obtained from animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP (N=6) than from animals receiving a
prime-only (N=6) or a prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS (N=2), (Figure 4B).

Cytokines are upregulated in lung tissue of ChAdOx1 GFP vaccinated animals compared to
ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated animals
The presence of 23 cytokines was evaluated in lung tissue. Several cytokines were upregulated in
animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP compared to animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS,
including IL2, IL6, IL8, IL18, MCP-1, MIP-1a, and TGF-Î± (Figure 5). This is indicative of a
local enhanced immune response in animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 GFP, but not in animals
vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS.

excluded. Line = median; * = p-value<0.025.

Antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination neutralize different MERS-CoV strains
We selected six different strains of MERS-CoV (Figure S2) and tested neutralizing capability of
serum obtained at 0 DPI from animals vaccinated with a prime-boost regimen. Strains were
selected based on geographical location (Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Burkina Faso), host
(dromedary camel or human) and time of isolation (2012 to 2018). All six strains were
neutralized by antibodies elicited by ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination (Table 1).

ChAdOx1 MERS protects mice against different strains of MERS-CoV
To investigate whether vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination provides protection
against a variety of different MERS-CoV strains, we vaccinated balb/c mice transgenic for
human DPP4 with ChAdOx1 MERS or ChAdOx1 GFP 28 days before challenge with 104
TCID50 of one of six diverse MERS-CoV strains (Figure S2) via the intranasal route. All mice
vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS survived challenge with MERS-CoV, independent of the
challenge virus used, whereas most control mice were euthanized due to >20% weight loss or
poor body condition (Figure 6A). Four animals per group were euthanized at 3 DPI and
infectious MERS-CoV titers in lung tissue were evaluated. Whereas infectious virus could be

found in lung tissue of control animals, we were unable to find infectious virus in lung tissue of
ChadOx1 MERS vaccinated animals (Figure 6B). Thus, ChAdOx1 MERS protects against a
variety of different MERS-CoV strains in hDPP4 transgenic mice.

Discussion
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus is circulating in the dromedary camel population
and continuously reintroduced into the human population (17). MERS is associated with a high
case-fatality rate (34.5%) and human-to-human transmission is a major contributor to patient
infections (2). Currently, no MERS-CoV vaccine is available. Ideally, such a vaccine would only
require a single administration and would protect against a wide variety of different MERS-CoV
strains.
Several studies have evaluated different types of MERS-CoV vaccines in animal models, but few
have taken these vaccines into NHPs. In the current study, we show the efficacy of ChAdOx1
MERS in rhesus macaques. Unlike other NHP vaccine studies (9-12), we investigate vaccine
efficacy after a single dose. Animals that received a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS showed an
induction of a neutralizing antibody response associated with mostly normal clinical parameters,
showing no breathing irregularities or reduced lung function by spO2 values, limited evidence of
infiltration by radiograph analysis after challenge and no signs of gross pathological lesions.

Vaccination reduced viral RNA load in tissues collected at 6 DPI compared to ChAdOx1 GFP
vaccinated animals by several logs. Importantly, evidence of the presence of infectious virus in
the lungs was absent and presence of mRNA in the lungs was very limited, whereas this was
abundantly present in control animals. This was completely absent in animals vaccinated with a
prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 MERS.
A variety of different MERS-CoV strains have been isolated from dromedary camels and
humans over the last eight years of MERS-CoV emergence (17). Dromedary camels are
distributed throughout Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia (18). Although MERS-CoV
has not been detected in dromedary camels in Australia (19), strains have been isolated from
Africa (8) and the Middle East (6) and seropositive dromedary camels have been found in Asia
(20, 21). Phylogenetic analyses show a clustering of MERS-CoV by geographical location (7, 8)
and analysis of 219 complete MERS-CoV genomes, which only included one African strain,
showed the presence of two clades, with human isolates in both clades (22). Notably, antigenic
differences have been reported between S proteins from the Middle East and Africa (7),
potentially affecting the efficacy of a vaccine based on S protein. It is important that a MERSCoV vaccine does not only provides homologous protection, but also against other MERS-CoV
strains. We previously showed full protection of ChAdOx1 MERS (based on the
Camel/Qatar/2/2014 strain) vaccinated hDPP4 transgenic mice after heterologous challenge with
HCoV-EMC/2012 (14). Here, we repeated this challenge and extended the experiment to include
five other MERS-CoV strains. We utilized strains from Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Burkina
Faso, obtained from dromedary camels or humans, and isolated between 2012 and 2018 and
showed full protection against all strains when mice were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS in a
prime-only regimen. Moreover, sera obtained at day of challenge from rhesus macaques
vaccinated with ChadOx1 MERS efficiently neutralized all six MERS-CoV strains indicating
that vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS can protect against a variety of different MERS-CoV
strains. Based on these results, future clinical development studies are planned with this
ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine, supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations
(CEPI).
In conclusion, we show that a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 MERS results in protection
against disease progression and virus replication associated with MERS-CoV challenge in the
rhesus macaque, and a prime-boost regimen reduced viral replication further. Furthermore,

ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination protected against a diverse panel of contemporary MERS-CoV
strains in hDPP4 mice. This is the first time that broad protection after a single vaccination has
been shown for any MERS-CoV vaccine.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
Animal experiment approval was provided by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) at Rocky Mountain Laboratories. All animal experiments were executed in an
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC)-approved
facility by certified staff, following the guidelines and basic principles in the NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Animal Welfare Act, United States Department of
Agriculture and the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Rhesus macaques were housed in individual primate cages allowing social
interactions, in a climate-controlled room with a fixed light-dark cycle (12-hr/12-hr). Rhesus
macaques were monitored a minimum of twice daily throughout the experiment. Commercial
monkey chow, treats, and fruit were provided twice daily by trained personnel. Water was
available ad libitum. Environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of human interaction,
commercial toys, videos, and music. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved
work with infectious MERS-CoV virus strains under BSL3 conditions. All sample inactivation
was performed according to IBC-approved standard operating procedures for removal of
specimens from high containment.
Vaccine generation and production
The spike protein gene from MERS-CoV strain Camel/Qatar/2/2014 (GenBank accession
number KJ650098.1) was codon optimized for humans and synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The synthesized S gene was cloned into a transgene expression plasmid
comprising a modified human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (CMV promoter) with
tetracycline operator (TetO) sites and the polyadenylation signal from bovine growth hormone
(BGH). The resulting expression cassette was inserted into the E1 locus of a genomic clone of
ChAdOx1 using site-specific recombination (23). The virus was rescued and propagated in TREx-293 cells (Invitrogen). Purification was by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation, and the virus

was titered as previously described (24). Doses for vaccination were based on infectious units
(IU).
Non-human primate study
18 adult rhesus macaques (17M, 1F) were purchased from Morgan Island and randomly divided
into 3 groups of six animals each. Group 1 was vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS at -56 DPI and
-28 DPI, group 2 was vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS at -28 DPI, and group 3 was vaccinated
with ChAdOx1 GFP at -56 DPI and -28 DPI. All vaccinations were done with 3.9 x 108
IU/animal/vaccination. Blood samples were obtained before vaccination and 14 days thereafter.
Animals were challenged with MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012 on 0 DPI; with
administration of 4 mL intratracheally, 1 mL intranasally, 1 mL orally and 1 mL ocularly of 107
TCID50/mL virus solution. Clinical exams were performed on -56, -42, -28, -14, 0, 1, 3, and 5
and 6 DPI; animals were euthanized on 6 DPI. All exams existed of the following: Weight and
temperature measurements, radiographs, and blood sampling. BAL was performed on 1, 3, 5,
and 6 DPI by insertion of an endotracheal tube and bronchoscope into the trachea, then past the
3rd bifurcation, and subsequent installation of 10 mL of sterile saline. Manual suction was
applied to retrieve the BAL sample. Necropsy was performed on 6 DPI. Radiographs were
evaluated and scored by a board-certified veterinarian who was blinded to the group assignment
of the animals according to the following criteria: 0, normal examination; 1, mild interstitial
pulmonary infiltrates; 2, moderate interstitial infiltrates, perhaps with partial cardiac border
effacement and small areas of pulmonary consolidation (alveolar patterns and air bronchograms);
and 3, pulmonary consolidation as the primary lung pathology, seen as a progression from grade
2 lung pathology (25).
Mouse study
Groups of 10 mice were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS or ChAdOx1 GFP (1x108 IU/mouse)
intramuscularly 28 days prior to intranasal inoculation with 104 TCID50 MERS-CoV. Mice were
challenged with one of six MERS-CoV strains: HCoV-EMC/12 (EMC/12, JX869059);
Aseer/KSA-Rs924/62015 (KSA/15, KY688119); Korea/Seoul/SNU1-035/2015 (SK/15,
KU308549); Riyadh/KSA-18013832/2018 (KSA/18, MN723544); Camel/Saudi Arabia/KFUHKU1/2013 (C/KSA/13, KJ650297); or Camel/Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU785/2015 (C/BF/15,

MG923471). Animals were monitored daily for signs of disease. Four animals were euthanized
at 3 DPI and lung tissue was harvest. The remaining animals were monitored for survival.
Animals were euthanized upon reaching >20% of body weight loss or poor body condition.
Cells and virus
EMC/12 was provided by Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; KSA/15 and
KSA/18 were provided by CDC, Atlanta, USA; SK/15 was provided by Seoul National
University, Seoul, South Korea; C/KSA/13 and C/BF/15 were provided by Hong Kong
University, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong. Virus propagation was performed in VeroE6 cells in
DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and
50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. VeroE6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin.
Virus titration assay
Virus titrations were performed by end-point titration in VeroE6 cells, which were inoculated
with tenfold serial dilutions of virus. After 1hr incubation at 37Â°C and 5% CO2, tissue
homogenate dilutions were removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 100 Î¼l
2% DMEM. Cytopathic effect was scored at 5 dpi and the TCID50 was calculated from 4
replicates by the Spearman-Karber method (26).
Virus neutralization assay MERS-CoV
Sera were heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 Â°C) and two-fold serial dilutions were prepared in 2%
DMEM. Hereafter, 100 TCID50 of MERS-CoV was added. After 60 min incubation at 37 Â°C,
virus:serum mixture was added to VeroE6 cells and incubated at 37Â°C and 5% CO2. At 5 dpi,
cytopathic effect was scored. The virus neutralization titer was expressed as the reciprocal value
of the highest dilution of the serum which still inhibited virus replication.
Virus neutralization assay ChAdOx1
Chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1 specific neutralizing antibody titers were assessed using a
Secreted placental Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) quantitation assay. Briefly, GripTiteâ„¢ MSR
293 cells (Invitrogen cat no. R795-07) were cultured as per manufacturerâ€™s instructions and were

seeded at 3x104 cells per well in a 96 well plate the day prior to starting the assay (24hrs +/- 2
hrs). Cells were infected with the test sera dilutions (4 fold dilution series) at 1:18, 1:72, 1:288,
1:1152, 1:4608 in phenol red free 0% FBS DMEM (Life Technologies cat no. 31053028) and the
ChAdOx1-SEAP reporter virus in a 1:1 mixture (pre-incubated for 1 hour to allow any
neutralization to occur) for 1 hour before replacing with phenol red free 10% FBS DMEM for a
further 24 hours (+/- 2 hrs). Sample dilutions were tested in duplicate lanes. SEAP concentration
was tested on 50Âµl media supernatants of the samples using CPSD (Tropix PhosphaLite
Chemiluminescent Assay Kit, Life Technologies cat no. T1017) using a minor variant of the
manufacturerâ€™s instructions and luminescence intensity was measured using a Varioskan Flash
luminometer (Thermo Fisher). Serum dilution neutralization titers were measured by linear
interpolation of adjacent values (to 50% inhibition) to determine the serum dilution required to
reduce SEAP concentration by 50% compared to wells with virus alone.
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
Tissues (30 mg) were homogenized in RLT buffer and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted from BAL fluid using
the QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) on the QIAxtractor. The UpE MERS-CoV (27) or mRNA
(28) detection assay was used for the detection of MERS-CoV viral RNA. 5 Î¼l RNA was tested
with the Rotor-GeneTM probe kit (Qiagen) according to instructions of the manufacturer.
Dilutions of MERS-CoV virus stock with known genome copies were run in parallel. Genome
copies were determined using Droplet Digital PCR (Biorad) and the corresponding qRT-PCR.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
A soluble, trimeric recombinant spike protein of MERS coronavirus (isolate
Ca/Jeddah/D42/2014) incorporating amino acids 1â€“1,273 and a carboxyl-terminal trimerization
domain was produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (expiCHO; ThermoFisher) and purified
by immunoaffinity chromatography. Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at room
temperature (RT) with 5 Âµg of S protein per plate in PBS. Plates were blocked with 100 Âµl of
casein (Thermo Fisher) for 90 minutes at RT. Serum (2x serial diluted in casein starting at 100x
dilution) was incubated at RT for 2 hrs. Antibodies were detected using affinity-purified
polyclonal antibody peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-monkey IgG (Seracare, 074-11-021) in casein

and TMB 2-component peroxidase substrate (Seracare) and read at 450 nm. All wells were
washed 3x with PBST in between steps. Treshold for positivity was set at 3 x OD value of
negative control (serum obtained from non-human primates prior to start of the experiment).
Cytokine and chemokine profiles
Samples for analysis of cytokine/chemokine levels were inactivated with Î³-radiation (2 MRad)
according to standard operating procedures. Concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL1 receptor antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12/23 (p40), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17,
IL-18 monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1Î±, MIP-1Î², soluble CD40-ligand (sCD40L), TGF-Î±, TNF-Î±, and VEGF were measured on a
Bio-Plex 200 instrument (Bio-Rad) using the Non-Human Primate Cytokine MILLIPLEX map
23-plex kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Necropsies and tissue sampling were performed according to IBC-approved protocols. Lungs
were perfused with 10% formalin and processed for histologic review. Harvested tissues were
fixed for a minimum of seven days in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and then embedded in
paraffin. Tissues were processed using a VIP-6 Tissue Tek, (Sakura Finetek, USA) tissue
processor and embedded in Ultraffin paraffin polymer (Cancer Diagnostics, Durham, NC).
Samples were sectioned at 5 Âµm, and resulting slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Specific anti-CoV immunoreactivity was detected using MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein rabbit
antibody (Sino Biological Inc.) at a 1:4000. The tissues were processed for
immunohistochemistry using the Discovery ULTRA automated IHC/ISH staining instrument
(Ventana Medical Systems) with a Discovery Red (Ventana Medical Systems) kit. All tissue
slides were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary anatomic pathologist blinded to study group
allocations.
Statistical analyses
Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparison test or a two-tailed unpaired studentâ€™s t-test was conducted to
compare differences between vaccine groups and the control group. A Bonferroni correction was
