understanding of the molecular pathways of SARS-CoV-2
and constituent structures. The structural biology community
has made rapid progress towards this goal by experimentally
determining several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the spike
(S) [3]–[6], nucleocapsid (N) [7], and main protease (Mpro )
[8]. The S protein is particularly important since it resides on
the viral envelope and is responsible for host cell entry by
engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors
[2], [9], [10]. Recent experimental structures of the SARSCoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in complex
with ACE2 provide detailed interface information [4], [6];
targeting this interface represents an active area of research
for therapeutic development [11]. However, there may exist
potential targets on the S protein besides the RBD domain.
Further motivating our work is the need to understand
SARS-CoV-2 structure in the context of structures from previous coronaviruses. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2,
comparisons of the trimeric S protein from different viruses
showed they possess overall similar structures but with some
local differences [12], [13]. With the appearance of SARSCoV-2, it is necessary to investigate the S protein structure
[3], and compare it to previous human coronaviruses.
Here, to obtain deeper insights into S protein structure for
biological understanding and therapeutic targeting, we employ
a combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and artificial
intelligence (AI) methodology on a series of coronavirus S
proteins. Specifically, we investigate the S proteins from the
current SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human coronavirus
HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1). From structural analysis of extensive
MD simulations, we find substantial flexibility between the
subunits of the S proteins. We find that reduced distance matrix
representations, interpreted by unsupervised deep learning
(DL), reveal important regions for S protein trimerization.
These regions present potential targets for therapeutic development.

Abstract—The emergence and rapid worldwide spread of the
novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has prompted concerted
efforts to find successful treatments. The causative virus, severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses
its spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. Therefore, the
S protein presents a viable target to develop a directed therapy.
Here, we deployed an integrated artificial intelligence with
molecular dynamics simulation approach to provide new details
of the S protein structure. Based on a comprehensive structural
analysis of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and previous human
coronaviruses, we found that the protomer state of S proteins
is structurally flexible. Without the presence of a stabilizing
beta sheet from another protomer chain, two regions in the S2
domain and the hinge connecting the S1 and S2 subunits lose
their secondary structures. Interestingly, the region in the S2
domain was previously identified as an immunodominant site
in the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We anticipate that the molecular
details elucidated here will assist in effective therapeutic
development for COVID-19.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes respiratory illness and has
now reached a pandemic scale. Denoted as coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), its global spread is currently ongoing
with symptoms that can range from mild flu-like to severe
pneumonia, leading to death in certain cases. Early investigations in China showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a high genomic
sequence similarity to the previous SARS-CoV-1, along with
a bat coronavirus [1], [2]. Similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARSCoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the
betacoronavirus genus.
Given the health crisis caused by the mounting number
of COVID-19 cases worldwide, there is an urgent need to
develop effective therapeutics and eventual vaccines. A critical
step in developing targeted treatments is obtaining a detailed

II. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
Human coronavirus spike (S) proteins are molecular complexes each formed by three protein chains [3], [14]–[16].
To better understand S protein structure [3], we started by
studying the protomer, the structural unit of the trimeric
complex, and compared the protomer structure of the current

SARS-CoV-2 with protomers of previously identified human
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 [15], MERS-CoV [16],
and HCoV-HKU1 [14]. We modeled each protomer system
from the corresponding cryo-EM S protein structure (see
Methods for more details). There are three major structural
domains which constitute the protomer: the amino-terminal
domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and the S2
domain.
The NTD and RBD are within the S1 subunit and are
responsible for binding to host receptors, while the S2 domain
is in the S2 subunit which mediates fusion of the viral and
host membranes [14], [15]. Fig. 1 A-D shows the initial
protomer structures of the four S proteins, each highlighted
by the three domains. To determine the dynamic change of
the domain organization in the protomer structures, we measured the distribution of the interdomain distances from 5,000
structures of each system taken from 25 independent 200 ns
MD simulations (Fig. 1 E-G). Given the limited timescale, we
made no attempt to reproduce the thermodynamics but focused
on computing the structural features of the systems [17].
The overall distributions of the three interdomain distances
are broad, ranging from 40 Å to 110 Å between S2 and
NTD/RBD domains and 30 Å to 100 Å between NTD and
RBD domains. These wide distributions indicate enhanced
structural flexibility in the domain arrangement of the four
protomer systems compared to the cryo-EM structures.
To gain further insight into the 20,000 protomer structures,
we applied convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to

encode the high dimensional protein structures from the MD
simulations into 3-D latent spaces for visualization. Compared
to commonly applied structural analysis methods, which are
mostly limited to specific regions of the protein of interest,
our DL approach allows us to evaluate a protein structure as
a whole yet still capture detailed local structural features. We
found individual clusters corresponding to each of the four
protomer systems, suggesting that the structural features of the
four systems embedded in the latent spaces are distinct from
each other (Fig. 2 A-C). Representative structures selected
from the clusters also show high structural flexibility in their
domain arrangement (Fig. 2 D-F). The hinge region connecting
the S1 and S2 subunits opens up, causing broad distributions
of the interdomain distances observed in Fig. 1 E-G.
The exposed surface in the protomer may provide new
targets for therapeutic action. Therefore, we further explored
the structural flexibility of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We
compared the structures between the protomer and trimer to
investigate whether the large structural arrangement of the
domains in the protomer is affected by the trimeric state. We
found that domain organization is stabilized by trimerization.
Unlike the protomer, the three domains are closely arranged
in the trimer (Figs. 3 A-B and S4). In addition to their
interdomain distances, the differences in structural flexibility
between the protomer and trimer is captured in solventaccessible surface area (SASA) values (Fig. 3 C). The SASA
values of the protomer and one chain of the trimer are 532
± 10 nm2 and 450 ± 8 nm2 , respectively. The difference in

become an extended loop (Fig. 4 E). Oligomeric proteins are
often stabilized by oligomerization and hold highly flexible
regions in the protomer state [18]. The transition between
the structured and unstructured form of these flexible regions
is sometime reversible, but due to the size of the S protein
protomer and the timescale applied in this study, we did not
observe reversible behavior of the two loop regions in the
protomer state. Interestingly, a fragment between residues 784
and 810 was identified previously as an immunodominant site
in SARS-CoV-1 S protein [19]. Complementary antibodies
acting on this site provided the dominant immune response
for patients who recovered from the SARS-CoV 1 infection.
Our results provide structural comprehension on the previous experimental observation and posit that targeting these
residues might not only interfere with S protein trimerization
and the subsequent viral activity but also aid antibody immune
response. Our findings provide insights into therapeutic design
targeting the S protein beyond the oft-targeted RBD domain.

these values largely comes from their S2 domains, which have
the values of 228 ± 7 nm2 and 170 ± 5 nm2 , respectively.
Again, we applied a CVAE to encode the 10,000 protomer
and trimer structures into 3-D latent spaces. We found two
individual clusters, one corresponding to the protomer and the
other to the trimer, suggesting that the structural features of
the two oligomeric states embedded in the latent spaces are
different (Fig. 3 D-G).
To locate the different structural features between the protomer and trimer in their 3-D structures, we compared the
difference between the distance matrices of the representative
protomer and trimer structures selected from the clusters in
the latent dimensions (Fig. 4 A). Most differences between
the distance matrices result from interdomain arrangement.
However, there are some disparities within the S2 domain
(Fig. 4 B). One region of difference corresponds to residue
numbers 784 to 810 in the PDB. In the 3-D structure, this
region forms a beta sheet in the trimer while the structure is
lost in the protomer (Fig. 4 C). Further investigation into this
region reveals that the beta sheet in the trimer is stabilized
by another beta sheet constituted by residues 700 to 710
of another chain (Fig. 4 D). Without the presence of other
chains, this stability is lost; not only do residues 784 to 810
in the S2 domain lose the beta sheet structure, but residues
700 to 710 in the hinge region connecting the two subunits

III. C ONCLUSION
Here, we used unsupervised deep learning routines based on
CVAEs to systematically compare S protein ensembles from
MD simulations across lower-dimensional, latent spaces. By
first comparing the S protein protomer structure of SARSCoV-2 to those from previous human coronaviruses, we identified distinct clusters for each virus in the 3-D latent space,

where representative structures from these clusters highlight
their differences in domain flexibility. Next, we compared the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein protomer and trimer structures, which
also displayed a clear separation of clusters in the latent space.
While the main distinctions between these two states arise
from the general gain in structural stability as the protomer
self-assembles into the trimer state, we pinpointed structural
transitions in specific flexible regions of the protomer that
warrant consideration as potential therapeutic targets. These
regions are promising as natural targets of immune recognition, but more importantly, they are involved in S protein
oligomerization, suggesting they are susceptible to therapeutic
action for protein destabilization. Overall, our study provides a
more complete molecular view of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
that may assist in accelerating both vaccine and drug design
efforts.

B. Deep learning analysis
To further understand the molecular structures of different
human coronavirus S proteins and the oligomeric state of
SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we deployed a custom-built deep
learning architecture, a convolutional variational autoencoder
(CVAE), to encode the high dimensional protein structures
from the MD simulations into lower dimensional latent spaces.
The goal of our AI method is to reduce the high dimensionality of the molecular system while preserving the inherent
characteristics of the system and learning novel behavior in a
latent space that is normally distributed. The direct comparison
between the decoded and original input data ensures the
accuracy of the latent space representation. This customized
CVAE approach has been successfully applied to study the
folding pathways of small proteins and structural clustering of
biomolecules [26]–[28].
1) Data preparation: We used translation and rotation
invariant input data for the DL networks. We represented each
MD structure by a distance matrix using the C↵ atoms of
the protein and generated two input datasets for the CVAEs.
Input 1 included the matrices of the protomer structures of
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1.
Input 2 included the matrices of the protomer structure and
the chain A of the trimer structure of SARS-CoV-2. For Input
1, as the proteins are different in length, we first performed
a multiple sequence alignment of the protomer structures of
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1
by Clustal Omega [29]. Based on the alignment, we inserted
gaps into the corresponding aligned residue location in the
distance matrix and set the distance between gaps to be 0 Å.
The size of each distance matrix after the alignment was 1,342
⇥ 1,342. To reduce the matrix size, we applied a convolution
layer with padding of 2 and a 14 ⇥ 14 filter with strides of
size 7 in both the x and y directions. The size of each resulting
matrix became 191 ⇥ 191. Finally, after alignment and size
reduction we merged a total of 20,000 distance matrices of
the four S proteins. An example of a distance matrix following
the alignment and size reduction is represented in Fig. S1. For
Input 2, as the proteins are of the same length, no alignment
was required. The size of each matrix was 959 ⇥ 959. We
again applied a convolution layer with padding of 1 and a 10
⇥ 10 filter with strides of size 5 in both the x and y directions
to reduce the matrix size. The size of each resulting matrix
was also 191 ⇥ 191, and we merged a total of 10,000 distance
matrices of the protomer and trimer of SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
2) CVAE implementation: For each of the two input
datasets, we randomly split the aligned matrices into training

IV. M ETHODS
A. Molecular systems and MD simulations
To generate initial systems for the structural study of human
coronavirus S proteins, we built protomer structures from
chain A of the cryo-EM S protein structures of SARS-CoV-2
(PDB 6VSB [3]), SARS-CoV-1 (PDB 6CRZ [15]), MERSCoV (PDB 6Q05 [16]), and HCoV-HKU1 (PDB 5I08 [14]).
The trimeric state of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein consists of all
three chains in PDB 6VSB. Each structure was solvated in the
center of a water box with a minimum distance of 15 Å from
the edge of the box to the nearest protein atom, neutralized
with counter ions and ionized with 150 mM NaCl. Table 1
summarizes the details of the five molecular systems studied.
Following a similar protocol to our previous studies [20],
[21], the resulting systems were each subjected to 20,000 steps
of energy minimization, followed by 1 ns equilibration with
harmonic restraints placed on the heavy atoms of the protein.
The force constant was 1 kcal/mol/Å [15]. After equilibration,
the restraints were released, and a 200 ns trajectory was generated in a production run. For each system, 25 independent 200ns trajectories were performed. Structures were taken every 1
ns for analysis, yielding a total of 5,000 structures for each
system.
All MD simulations were performed with NAMD [22] in
NPT ensemble at 1 atm and 310 K with a time step of 2 fs.
The CHARMM36m force field [23] and TIP3P water model
[24] were used. The nonbonding interactions were calculated
with a typical cutoff distance of 12 Å, while the long-range
electrostatic interactions were enumerated with the Particle
Mesh Ewald algorithm [25].

and validation datasets using the 80/20 ratio and applied
a CVAE to capture the important structural features and
projected them in the three-dimensional (3-D) latent space for
visualization. The encoder network of each CVAE consisted
of three convolutional layers and a fully connected layer. We
used a 3 ⇥ 3 convolution kernel and a stride of 1, 2, and
1 at the three convolutional layers, respectively. We trained
each CVAE until the training and validation loss converged.
Fig. S2 shows the loss curves along the 150 epochs. The
difference between decoded and original images is minimal,
suggesting the models were trained successfully (Fig. S3). We
then selected representative structures from the clusters in the
latent space and visualized them using VMD [30].
All MD simulations and DL analysis were performed on
the Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership
Computing Facility.
