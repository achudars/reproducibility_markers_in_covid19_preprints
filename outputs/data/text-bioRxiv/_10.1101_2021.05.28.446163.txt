Abstract

18

The spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in 2019 contained a

19

suboptimal furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction with the sequence 681PRRAR/S686. This cleavage

20

site is required for efficient airway replication, transmission, and pathogenicity of the virus. The

21

B.1.617 lineage has recently emerged in India, coinciding with substantial disease burden across the

22

country. Early evidence suggests that B.1.617.2 (a sublineage of B.1.617) is more highly transmissible

23

than contemporary lineages. B.1.617 and its sublineages contain a constellation of S mutations

24

including the substitution P681R predicted to further optimise this furin cleavage site. We provide

25

experimental evidence that virus of the B.1.617 lineage has enhanced S cleavage, that enhanced

26

processing of an expressed B.1.617 S protein in cells is due to P681R, and that this mutation enables

27

more efficient cleavage of a peptide mimetic of the B.1.617 S1/S2 cleavage site by recombinant furin.

28

Together, these data demonstrate viruses in this emerging lineage have enhanced S cleavage by furin

29

which we hypothesise could be enhancing transmissibility and pathogenicity.

30

Introduction

31

Unlike its closest known relatives, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein contains a furin cleavage

32

site at the S1/S2 junction that enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication in airway cells and contributes to virus

33

pathogenicity and transmissibility (1-6). Pre-cleavage of the S protein in producer cells allows SARS-

34

CoV-2 to enter target cells at the cell surface avoiding endosomal restriction factors (4, 7). However,

35

the cleavage site of the early SARS-CoV-2 isolates that emerged in late 2019 are suboptimal, leaving

36

the potential for evolution of variants with increased transmission as a result of an optimised cleavage

37

site (4).

38

Towards the end of 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic entered a new phase with repeated

39

emergence of ‘variants of concern’ lineages with altered viral properties such as transmissibility,

40

pathogenicity, and antigenicity (8). The most widespread and best characterised of these variants is

41

the B.1.1.7 lineage, first found in the UK, which has increased transmissibility and pathogenicity

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446163; this version posted May 28, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

42

compared to other circulating strains (9-11). We and others have previously described that the S1/S2

43

cleavage site of B.1.1.7 S contains a P681H mutation that enhances post-translational S1/S2 cleavage

44

during virus budding (12, 13). Other widely circulating variants that arose around the same time

45

include the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages, first found in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, that show

46

antigenic escape but do not contain alterations at the furin cleavage site (14). As of May 2021, an

47

increasing number of variant lineages have been described, one of which is the B.1.617 lineage. The

48

emergence of this lineage in India coincided with a period of record disease burden across the country,

49

leading to partial collapse of its health infrastructure (15). Early evidence from the UK suggests one

50

B.1.617 sublineage (B.1.617.2) likely has enhanced transmissibility, comparable to, or greater than

51

B.1.1.7 (16). B.1.617 and its sublineages contain several S mutations, some shared with other variants

52

and associated with antigenic escape (see Table 1). One S substitution shared by all B.1.617

53

sublineages is P681R which we hypothesise further optimises the furin cleavage site (681PRRAR/S686 to

54

681RRRAR/S686,

55

site.

56

Results and discussion

Figure 1a). In this report we characterise the impact of P681R on the S1/S2 cleavage

57

To investigate whether the S protein of B.1.617 undergoes a higher degree of post-

58

translational cleavage at S1/S2 than previously circulating strains, we isolated several B.1.617 lineage

59

viruses (1 x B.1.617.1 and 2 x B.1.617.2) and compared their S1/S2 cleavage to that of a previously

60

circulating strain of lineage B.1.238, which contains only D614G. The B.1.617 lineage S proteins were

61

all more highly cleaved (≥50% cleaved), with a higher proportion of cleaved S2 and a lower proportion

62

of full-length S detectable than the control virus (~33% cleaved) (Figure 1b, c).

63

To characterise which amino change in the B.1.617 S is responsible for its enhanced cleavage,

64

we generated pseudovirus containing the SARS-CoV-2 full B.1.617.1 S and compared it to pseudovirus

65

with D614G spike (WT). As we had previously observed, SARS-CoV-2 spike expressed on pseudovirus

66

contains a larger proportion of cleaved spike (4). While WT S displayed both full length (~20%) and

67

cleaved (~80%) S, B.1.617.1 S showed significantly enhanced cleavage (~95%), with an almost

68

complete lack of full-length protein (Figure 1d,e). P681R alone (on a D614G backbone) was sufficient

69

to convey this phenotype (~96% cleaved), with cleavage enhanced to a similar level as for a previously

70

described S protein carrying the fully optimised furin cleavage site from an H5N1 avian influenza virus

71

haemagglutinin (~97% cleaved) (4). This suggests P681R alone is responsible for the enhanced S

72

cleavage seen in the B.1.617 lineages viruses.

73

We then performed assays to determine whether the optimised cleavage site found in the

74

B.1.617 S enables better cleavage directly by furin. We measured the ability of recombinant furin to

75

cleave fluorescently labelled peptides corresponding to the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 testing

76

peptides containing 681P (WT), 681R, or a monobasic mutant (monoCS) whereby two of the arginines

77

are substituted to non-basic residues (see Figure 1a) (4). As expected, monoCS was poorly cleaved by

78

recombinant furin compared to the WT peptide which was efficiently cleaved by furin as previously

79

described (Figure 1f)(2). P681R significantly enhanced the ability of furin to cleave the peptide

80

confirming that the arginine substitution is responsible for the enhanced cleavage of the B.1.617 S

81

protein.

82

To conclude, we speculate that enhanced S1/S2 cleavage seen in B.1.617 and B.1.1.7 (which

83

contains P681H (12)) may be contributing to the enhanced transmissibility of these SARS-CoV-2

84

variants. As well as B.1.1.7 and B.1.617, several other emerging lineages contain mutations in the furin

85

cleavage site (8). We would advise that these lineages be kept under close monitoring for any early

86

evidence of more rapid transmission or higher pathogenesis.

87

Materials and methods

88

Cells and viruses

89

Vero E6-ACE2-TMPRSS2 (Glasgow University)(17), were maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS, 1x

90

non-essential amino acids, 200 µg/ml hygromycin B (Gibco) and 2mg/ml G418 (Gibco). Cells were kept

91

at 5% CO2, 37oC.

92

Upper respiratory tract swabs used to isolate viruses were collected for routine clinical

93

diagnostic use and sequenced using the ARTIC network protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) to

94

confirm the presence of B.1.617 lineage virus, under approval by the Public Health England Research

95

Ethics and Governance Group for the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium (R&D NR0195). Virus was

96

isolated by inoculating 100 µL of neat swab material onto Vero cells, incubating at 37oC for 1 h before

97

replacing with growth media supplemented with 1x penicillin/streptomycin and 1x amphotericin B.

98

Cells were incubated for 5-7 days until cytopathic effect was observed. Isolates were passaged a

99

further two times in Vero E6-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells (17), the supernatant clarified by centrifugation and

100

concentration for western blot analysis viruses by centrifuging in an Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal

101

Filter Unit followed by an Amicon® Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit with 50 kDa exclusion size.

102

Plasmids and Pseudovirus

103

The B.1.617.1 plasmid was generated from a previously described codon-optimised SARS-

104

CoV-2 spike plasmid (Wuhan-hu-1)(18), using the QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed

105

Mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Pseudovirus was generated and concentrated as previously described (4).

106

All spike expression plasmids used in this study contain D614G and K1255*STOP (that results in

107

deletion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of spike containing the endoplasmic retention signal, aka

108

the Δ19 spike truncation).

109

Western Blotting

110

Virus or pseudovirus concentrates were lysed in 4x Laemmli buffer (Bio-rad) with 10% β-

111

mercaptoethanol and run on SDS-PAGE gels. After semi-dry transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane,

112

samples were probed with mouse anti-p24 (abcam; ab9071), rabbit anti-SARS spike protein (NOVUS;

113

NB100-56578), or rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (SinoBiological; 40143-R019). Near infra-red

114

(NIR) secondary antibodies, IRDye® 680RD Goat anti-mouse (abcam; ab216776) and IRDye® 800CW

115

Goat anti-rabbit (abcam; ab216773) were subsequently used to probe membranes. Western blots

116

were visualised using an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).

117

Peptide cleavage assays

118

The peptide cleavage assay was adapted from the protocol by Jaimes et al (2, 19). Briefly

119

fluoregenic peptides were synthesised (Cambridge research biochemicals) with the sequences

120

TNSPRRARSVA (WT), TNSRRRARSVA (P681R) and TNSPSLARSVA (monoCS) and, N-terminally

121

conjugated with the fluorophore 5-Carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and the C-terminal quencher 2,4-

122

Dinitrophenyl.

123

Each peptide was tested for its ability to be cleaved by recombinant furin (10 U/mL; NEB;

124

P8077) in a buffer of 100 mM HEPES, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1mM CaCl2, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH

125

7.5. Assays were performed in triplicate at 30oC and fluorescence intensity was measured at

126

wavelengths of 485 and 540 nm every 1 minute for 1 hour using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG

127

Labtech). Vmax was then calculated.
