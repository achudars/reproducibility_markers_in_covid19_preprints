ABSTRACT:

23

People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible

24

to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are

25

exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly

26

dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace.

27

The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2

28

receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we donâ€™t yet understand

29

how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS

30

and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of

31

human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in

32

zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell

33

transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have

34

two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site

35

of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the

36

Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell

37

subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific

38

genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to

39

COVID-19 comorbidities.

INTRODUCTION

43

Coronaviruses have already led to three major epidemics in the 21st century: Severe Acute Respiratory

44

syndrome caused by SARS-CoV (WHO, 2004), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, caused by MERS-CoV

45

(WHO, 2016), and in the worst pandemic in over a century, in December 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019

46

(COVID-19) (Lu et al., 2020) caused by SARS-CoV-2, with symptoms including pneumonia, fever, persistent

47

cough, lung inflammation, and often diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and death (Cheng Y et al., 2020; Meo et

48

al., 2020).

49

Remarkably, about 20% of SARS-CoV-19 infections are asymptomatic (Bai et al., 2020; Streeck et al.,

50

2020), which promotes surreptitious dissemination. A question of great interest is: what makes some people

51

more susceptible to severe COVID-19 outcomes than others? Risk factors include sex, race, and age (Du et

52

al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Price-Haywood et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020). These factors correlate with

53

certain chronic health problems: among nearly 6000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, 94%

54

had a pre-existing health issue, frequently hypertension (57%), obesity (42%), and diabetes (34%)

55

(Richardson et al., 2020). We do not yet fully understand how these underlying conditions exacerbate

56

COVID-19, but they are related to the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which modulates

57

blood volume and blood pressure (Cabandugama et al., 2017; Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa, 2008). The RAAS is

58

linked to COVID-19 in two important ways. First, COVID-19 comorbidities mimic a chronically over-active

59

RAAS and second, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is a key RAAS component.

60

COVID-19 comorbidities mimic RAAS action through Angiotensin II (Ang II). This 8-amino acid peptide

61

promotes vasoconstriction, salt and water retention, inflammation, and production of reactive oxygen species

62

(ROS) (Supplementary Fig. S1). These features help counteract a sudden drop in blood pressure but are

63

harmful when chronic (Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa, 2008). Some of these features contribute to COVID-19

64

comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease (Wang

65

et al., 2020). Ang II forms when Ace cleaves two amino acids from Ang I, a peptide produced by Renin

66

digesting Angiotensinogen (Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa, 2008). Ace inhibitor drugs decrease Ang II production

67

and thus dampen hypertension and other COVID-19 comorbidities (Rice et al., 2004) (Messerli et al., 2018;

68

Natesh et al., 2004; Sommerstein et al., 2020). Ang II receptor blockers also improve cardiovascular health.

69

About 19% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 had been taking one of these drugs for hypertension

70

(Richardson et al., 2020). It is not fully known whether Ace inhibitors or Ang receptor blockers benefit or harm

71

COVID-19 patients (Sommerstein et al., 2020; Vaduganathan et al., 2020).

72

COVID-19 is further linked to the RAAS because the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds

73

near the active site of Ace2, a cell-surface monocarboxy peptidase, allowing infection (Gallagher and

74

Buchmeier, 2001; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Simmons et al., 2013; Walls et al., 2020;

75

Yan et al., 2020). The normal role of Ace2 is to metabolize Ang II to Ang1-7, thus decreasing hypertension

76

and retention of water and salt. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to Ace2, however, inhibits Ace2 activity (Kuba et

4

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.278366; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

77

al., 2005), which would decrease the destruction of Ang II and contribute to more intense COVID-19

78

morbidities. Knockout mice lacking Angiotensinogen or Ang II receptors support the notion that RAAS

79

activation leads to COVID-19 comorbidities because they show less obesity, less insulin resistance, and less

80

hypertension (Massiera et al., 2001; Yvan-Charvet et al., 2005). Ace2 can also cleave Apelin (Apln) peptides,

81

which cause vasodilation, increased heart muscle contractility, angiogenesis, fluid homeostasis, and

82

regulation of energy metabolism; thus, countering effects of Ang II (De Mota et al., 2004; Dray et al., 2008;

83

Kasai et al., 2004; Szokodi et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2017). Apln is a positive regulator of Ace2, so decreasing

84

Apln downregulates Ace2 expression, thereby decreasing the number of virus receptors, but increasing Ang

85

II levels, prolonging harmful effects on COVID-19 comorbidities (Sato et al., 2013).

86

The molecular genetic bases of complex diseases like COVID-19 are often illuminated by investigations in

87

model organisms (Wangler et al., 2017). Among vertebrate models for human disease, zebrafish (Danio

88

rerio) is a workhorse for understanding COVID-19-related organs, including heart and vasculature, kidney,

89

liver, and many others (e.g., (Bournele and Beis, 2016; Goessling and Sadler, 2015; Morales and Wingert,

90

2017)). Zebrafish can even contribute to understanding communicable human diseases (Bouz and Al

91

Hasawi, 2018; Sullivan et al., 2017); for example, transgenic cell markers and body transparency helped

92

identify a specific macrophage type as the long-sought reservoir for asymptomatic tuberculosis (Clay et al.,

93

2007).

94

Although humans are more closely related to other mammals than to fish, zebrafish can help accelerate

95

research into the mechanisms of vertebrate health and disease. Zebrafish embryos and larvae are

96

accessible, developing in a dish and are optically favorable, so disease mechanisms can be visualized

97

through transgenic fluorescent imaging of functioning organs in living animals (e.g., (Wiles et al., 2016)). For

98

example, transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP in TNFA-positive cells and mCherry in neutrophils (Lam et al.,

99

2012; Marjoram et al., 2015) allow visualization of components of the â€˜cytokine stormâ€™ that can lead to death

100

of adult COVID-19 patients and to the pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome that affects some

101

SARS-CoV-2-infected children (Health, 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Zebrafish have vertebrate-

102

specific organs and organ systems that mimic our own and they develop and function using similar regulatory

103

mechanisms. In addition, small size makes zebrafish suitable for screens of therapeutic molecules at a scale

104

not possible in mammals (Lam and Peterson, 2019).

105

To evaluate zebrafish as a model for mechanistic insights into the links between COVID-19 comorbidities

106

and the RAAS, we first identified the orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS-related genes in zebrafish.

107

Zebrafish orthologs of human genes are sometimes obscured by genome duplication events (two rounds in

108

stem vertebrates (Dehal and Boore, 2005; Simakov et al., 2020) and a third round in stem teleosts (Amores

109

et al., 1998; Jaillon et al., 2004; Postlethwait et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2001)). Second, we explored the

110

expression of RAAS-related genes in single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) experiments from zebrafish

111

embryos and larvae, providing the first organism-wide view of RAAS gene expression at the level of individual

112

cell types. Analyses showed first, that the RAAS is nearly identical in zebrafish and human while identifying

113

orthologs and previously unrecognized co-orthologs of important components; and second, that a specific

114

under-characterized cell type expresses many RAAS components and is hence a focal cell type for the RAAS

115

that merits further exploration. An apparently similar cell type in humans allows SARS-CoV-2 infection, the

116

production of infectious virus, and likely some COVID-19 pathologies (Stanifer et al., 2020). These studies

117

support zebrafish as a model for investigating the relationship of the RAAS to COVID-19 pathologies.

118

RESULTS

119

To identify RAAS components in the zebrafish genome and to detect potential COVID-19-related cellular

120

systems, we combined our ongoing efforts in defining the relationships of zebrafish and human genomes

121

(Braasch et al., 2016; Braasch et al., 2015; Postlethwait et al., 1999; Postlethwait and Braasch, 2020) and

122

our efforts in developing a scRNA-seq Atlas for zebrafish development (Farnsworth et al., 2020). Analyses

123

described below follow an outline of RAAS function portrayed in Supplementary Figure S1 (see (Fyhrquist

124

and Saijonmaa, 2008; Zhang et al., 2018)).

125

Angiotensinogen (Agt) is the protein precursor of Ang II (Fig. S1.1). AGT on human (Homo sapiens)

126

chromosome 1 (Hsa1) and agt (ENSDARG00000016412) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) chromosome 13 (Dre13)

127

conserve syntenies (Fig. 1A). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that zebrafish has a single ortholog of human

128

AGT (ENSGT00890000139531, Supplementary Fig. S2A). Mammalian and zebrafish Agt proteins share their

129

overall 3-dimensional structure (Lu et al., 2016b) and are both strongly expressed in the adult liver (Cheng et

130

al., 2006; Fagerberg et al., 2014)). Our zebrafish scRNA-seq Atlas, which combines cells from 1 and 2 day

131

post fertilization (dpf) embryos and from 5dpf larvae (Farnsworth et al., 2020), extended these results,

132

identifying two 5dpf hepatocyte sub-types (c121, c217) that strongly expressed agt and a third (c55) that

133

weakly expressed agt (Fig. 1B, C).

134

Cortisol and inflammation both control agt expression via the glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 and by Cebpb,

135

Cebpd, and other factors that bind enhancers (Brasier and Li, 1996; Demura et al., 2015). Many liver cells in

136

the Atlas expressed nr3c1 at low levels (Supplementary Fig. S2B,C), but other cell types, including periderm,

137

basal skin cells, ionocytes, fast skeletal muscle, photoreceptors, and vascular endothelium, expressed nr3c1

138

at higher levels. Nearly all agt-expressing cells in 5dpf zebrafish livers expressed the agt-regulator cebpb in

139

the Atlas, while liver cells not expressing agt generally didnâ€™t express cebpb (Fig. 1D) or cebpd

140

(Supplementary Fig. S2D). This result shows that genes expected to initiate the RAAS are already in place in

141

hepatocyte cell types in 5dpf zebrafish.

142

Renin encodes the enzyme that cleaves Ang I from Angiotensinogen (Fig. S1.1). Conserved syntenies (Fig.

143

1E) support the orthology of human REN to zebrafish ren (ENSDARG00000041858) (Liang et al., 2004).

144

Phylogenetics (ENSGT00940000157898, Fig. S3A) confirmed a single copy of ren in zebrafish. Renin is

145

expressed by kidney juxtaglomerular cells in adult mammals and adult zebrafish (Gomez et al., 1988;

146

Hoshijima and Hirose, 2007; Jones et al., 1990; Liang et al., 2004). In mammalian embryos and fetuses,

147

however, Ren-expressing cells arise predominantly from the adrenal but also other primordia, including skin,

148

nervous system, spleen, testis, eyes, and others (Gomez et al., 1988; Jones et al., 2000; Sequeira Lopez et

6

149

al., 2004). Only three cells in the Atlas expressed detectable levels of renin, and, as in mammalian fetuses,

150

each of the zebrafish ren cells was in a different cluster. As predicted from mammals and zebrafish (Gomez

151

et al., 1988; Liang et al., 2004; Sequeira Lopez et al., 2004), one of these cells was an interrenal (adrenal

152

homolog) precursor (c89) verified by expression of steroidogenic genes star and hsd3b1 (Fig. 1F,G). The

153

hypothesis that Renin, Ctsd, and Napsa derived by duplication events in stem bony vertebrates (Liang et al.,

154

2004) derived support from our genomic analyses showing that the portions of Hsa1, Hsa11, and Hsa19 that

155

contain these three genes, along with a part of Hsa12, make up four ohnologous regions (Supplementary

156

Figure S3B) predicted by two rounds of Vertebrate Genome Duplication (VGD (Dehal and Boore, 2005;

157

Simakov et al., 2020)).

158

Angiotensin I (Ang I, Fig. S1.1) varies in sequence among vertebrates (Takei et al., 1993). To follow the

159

evolution of Ang I sequences, we downloaded Agt sequences across vertebrate phylogeny. Most placental

160

mammals have the same Ang I sequence as humans, likely the ancestral state for eutherian mammals

161

(DRVYIHPFHL, Fig. 2). Some Artiodactyls, like cows and whales, however, have a valine (V) at position 5, as

162

do squirrel-related mammals and some bats. These replacements are due to lineage-specific mutations

163

because each is embedded in a clade with isoleucine at position 5. The little brown bat Myotis lucifugus has

164

the most variant Ang I among sampled therian mammals, with leucine rather than the otherwise invariant

165

valine at position 3 and methionine rather than the otherwise invariant leucine at position 10. This Ang 1-

166

divergent bat belongs to the group (Vespertilioniodea) that harbors coronaviruses most closely related to

167

SARS-CoV-2 and are the presumed wild source of this zoonotic virus (Anthony et al., 2017; Cotten et al.,

168

2013; Lau et al., 2020; Toosy AH and S., 2019). Monotremes and marsupials have valine rather than

169

isoleucine at position 5, which appears to be the ancestral mammalian state (DRVYVHPFHL) because most

170

non-mammalian tetrapods also have valine at this position. Most non-mammalian sarcopterygians (lobe-

171

finned vertebrates) have, like mammals, aspartic acid at position 1, although basally diverging lobe-finned

172

vertebrates, including amphibia and coelacanth, have asparagine at this position. Because actinopterygians

173

(ray-finned vertebrates) also have asparagine at position 1, this is likely the ancestral state for all osteichthys

174

(bony vertebrates). Although mammals have histidine at position 9, non-mammalian lobe-finned vertebrates

175

have a variety of amino acid residues at this position. Because the most basally diverging lobe-finned

176

vertebrates (clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis and coelacanth) both have asparagine at position 9, and because

177

basally diverging ray-finned vertebrates also have asparagine at position 9, the sequence NRVYVHPFNL is

178

likely the ancestral state for lobe-finned vertebrates.

179

Ang I sequences vary more among ray-finned than lobe-finned vertebrates (Fig. 2). Because coelacanth

180

and several basally diverging ray-finned vertebrates (sturgeon, elephant fish) have the sequence

181

NRVYVHPFNL, this is likely the ancestral Ang I sequence for all bony vertebrates. Several ray-finned

182

vertebrates have isoleucine at position 5, representing independent mutations that happen to match placental

183

mammals. Position 9 is highly variable in ray fins as in lobe fins. Zebrafish Ang I is NRVYVHPFNL, differing

184

from the human form at positions 1, 5, and 9.

185

The Angiotensin system was likely already active in stem vertebrates because chondrichthys (cartilaginous

186

fish) and even agnathans (jawless vertebrates) possess Angiotensinogen genes (Takei et al., 1993). At

187

position 1, some cartilaginous fish have arginine like most ray-finned vertebrates, but others have asparagine

188

or tryptophan, and position 9 is variable. The ancestral Ang I sequence in jawed vertebrates was likely the

189

same as in ancestral bony fishes (NRVYVHPFNL).

190

Angiotensinogen genes in jawless vertebrates appear to encode an Angiotensin that shares the amino-

191

terminal four residues with mammals but varies in the carboxy-terminal six residues (Wong and Takei, 2011).

192

At position 1, lampreys have either aspartic acid or glutamic acid, but the conserved isoleucine or leucine at

193

position 5 is replaced with methionine followed by glutamine replacing the otherwise invariant histidine.

194

Lamprey Ang II alters cardiovascular dynamics in live lampreys but teleost Ang II (NRVYVHPF) did not

195

(Wong and Takei, 2011), showing that stem jawless vertebrates already had key components of the RAAS

196

but that ligands and receptors evolved differences. Atg searches against the non-vertebrate chordate

197

amphioxus returned serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs), but not Angiotensinogin, suggesting that Ang I

198

signaling originated in vertebrates after divergence from non-vertebrate chordate ancestors.

199

Angiotensin converting enzyme (Ace) changes Ang I to Ang II (Fig. S1.2). Syntenies are conserved

200

between ace (ENSDARG00000079166) in zebrafish and ACE (ENSG00000159640) in human supporting

201

orthology (Fig. 3A). In humans, ACE is expressed four times stronger in the small intestine than in lungs

202

(Fagerberg et al., 2014) and in 5dpf zebrafish, ace is also expressed in the gut (Rauch et al., 2003 ). In the

203

Atlas ace was expressed almost exclusively in the 5dpf intestinal epithelium cluster c152 (Fig. 3B-D). The

204

most statistically differentially expressed genes in the ace-expressing cluster c152 encode fatty acid binding

205

proteins and apolipoproteins, suggesting a function in lipid biology.

206

Angiotensin II (Ang II) forms when Ace cleaves two C-terminal amino acid residues from Ang I (Fig. S1.3).

207

Ang II contributes to hypertension, an important COVID-19 comorbidity, and likely promotes the inflammation

208

that leads to poor disease outcomes. Human and zebrafish Ang II differ only at the first and fifth residues

209

(DRVTIHPF vs. NRVTVHPF, Fig. 2). Importantly, the fish and human peptides act about equally in

210

stimulating heterologous systems (Russell et al., 2001; Vilella et al., 1996). Treating zebrafish with Ang II

211

causes increased sodium uptake as expected if Ang II function is conserved between human and zebrafish

212

(Kumai et al., 2014).

213

Angiotensin II receptor type 1 and type 2 (Agtr1, Agtr2, Fig. S1.4) transduce Ang II signals on vascular and

214

other cells. In mammals, Agtr1 mediates inflammation and the production of aldosterone in the adrenal

215

cortex, thereby increasing the kidneyâ€™s reabsorption of sodium (Higuchi et al., 2007). Agtr2 broadly opposes

216

Agtr1 by decreasing cell proliferation and vasoconstriction (Wang et al., 1998b). Zebrafish has two co-

217

orthologs of AGTR1 (agtr1a (ENSDARG00000018616) and agtr1b (ENSDARG00000045443)) that reside in

218

double conserved syntenies with human AGTR1, verifying orthology (Fig. 3E). (The gene formerly called

219

agtrl1a (Tucker et al., 2007) is now recognized as an Apelin receptor gene aplnra

220

(ENSDARG00000002172)). Human AGTR1 and AGTR2 are expressed in vascular endothelial cells; likewise,

221

the Atlas showed agtr1b expression strongest in endothelial cells (c88, Fig. 3F) and in an unidentified type of

222

mesenchyme (c135), likely vascular precursors. In mammals, the kidney controls ion and water balance and

223

expresses Agtr1 (Miyata et al., 1999), but in fish, ionocytes in the skin control ion and water balance

224

(Dymowska et al., 2012; Guh et al., 2015; Inokuchi et al., 2017; Kwong et al., 2016) although they did not

225

have detectable agtr1a or agtr1b expression in the Atlas despite the fact that eel ionocytes express a protein

226

that binds a mouse antibody to Agtr1 (Marsigliante et al., 1997). Expression of agtr1a was not detected in the

227

Atlas.

228

Zebrafish has a single ortholog of human AGTR2 with conserved syntenies (Fig. 3G) (Wong and Takei,

229

2013). In situ hybridization identified agtr2 (ENSDARG00000035552) expression in zebrafish endothelia

230

(Wong et al., 2009), which the Atlas confirmed (Fig. 3H). Expression of agtr2 was also detected in 5dpf

231

mesenchyme (c135) and in 5dpf enteric smooth muscle cells (c197). Agtr antagonists taken to control

232

hypertension also ameliorate zebrafish models of heart failure (Quan et al., 2020), showing conserved

233

structure and function of angiotensin receptors.

234

In mammals, Agtr1 mediates adrenal secretion of aldosterone (Rainey et al., 2004). Teleosts have no

235

aldosterone, lacking an ortholog of the aldosterone-synthesizing enzyme Cyp11b2, but nevertheless have an

236

ortholog of Nr3c2, which encodes the aldosterone (mineralcorticoid) receptor (Bridgham et al., 2006). In fish,

237

Nr3c2 is stimulated either by the aldosterone precursor 11-deoxycorticosterone or by cortisol (Kumai et al.,

238

2014; Sturm et al., 2005). Human and zebrafish share strong conserved syntenies around NR3C2 and nr3c2

239

(ENSDARG00000102082, Fig. 3I). In the Atlas, nr3c2 was expressed in a few cells of the 5dpf intestinal

240

epithelium (c101, c168), in the periderm in 1dpf and 2dpf embryos (c0), in the gills in 5dpf larvae (c5) (Fig. 3J-

241

L), and in one NaK ionocyte cell (c128), cell types that contribute to water and salt balance at these stages

242

(Dymowska et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2018; Rombough, 2007). Zebrafish embryos also

243

expressed nr3c2 in some retinal progenitors and a few other scattered cells in the Atlas.

244

Angiotensin I converting enzyme-2 (Ace2, Fig. s1.7) is the SARS-CoV-19 receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020)

245

but its normal function is to remove an amino acid from Ang II to form Ang 1-7 (the seven amino terminal

246

residues in Fig. 2). Phylogenetics (ENSGT00940000158077, Fig. S4A) and conserved syntenies (Fig. 4A)

247

support orthology of human ACE2 (ENSG00000130234) to zebrafish ace2 (ENSDARG00000016918) (Chou

248

et al., 2006). Human ACE2 is expressed 3- to 4-times stronger in the intestine than in gall bladder, kidney,

249

and testis, 6-fold stronger than in heart, and 190-fold stronger than in lungs (Fagerberg et al., 2014). ACE2 is

250

also strongly expressed by epithelial cells of the human oral mucosa (Xu et al., 2020), perhaps providing a

251

route of infection. In the Atlas, ace2 was expressed exclusively in c152, the same intestinal epithelial cell

252

cluster that expressed ace (Fig. 4B vs. 3B). The co-expression of ace and ace2 identifies this incompletely

253

characterized cell type of the digestive tract as a key mediator of RAAS activity and may help account for the

254

gastrointestinal pathologies of COVID-19 that often occur in children and adults (Guan et al., 2020; Health,

255

2020).

256

Mas1 is a receptor for Ang 1-7 (Fig. S1.8,9) (Santos et al., 2003). MAS1 is present in mammals, sauropsids,

257

and amphibians, and a related gene (ENSLACG00000015240) is found in coelacanth, a basally diverging

258

lobe-finned vertebrate, but appears to be missing from ray-finned vertebrates (Fournier et al., 2012).

259

Conserved syntenies suggest a mechanism for this situation. In human, MAS1 lies in the gene sequence:

260

TCP- MRPL18-MAS1-IGF2R-SLC22A1-SLC22A2. Zebrafish orthologs of genes to the right of MAS1 are

261

adjacent as expected, but zebrafish orthologs of genes to the left of MAS1 are on different chromosomes in

262

both zebrafish and spotted gar, a basally diverging ray-finned vertebrate (Braasch et al., 2016). Thus, the

263

genomic neighborhood expected to contain the ray-fin ortholog of MAS1 is rearranged with respect to the

264

human genome, consistent with either gene loss due to a chromosome rearrangement breakpoint in stem

265

ray-fins, or to the origin of MAS1 in stem lobe-finned vertebrates. A different G-protein coupled receptor

266

(GPCR) in this large protein family (Rinne et al., 2019) may act as a zebrafish Ang 1-7 receptor.

267

Enpep (glutamyl aminopeptidase) converts Ang II to Ang III (Fig. S1.10), thereby stimulating systemic blood

268

pressure (Mizutani et al., 2008). Zebrafish has a single enpep (ENSDARG00000057064) gene on Dre13;

269

phylogenetic analysis (ENSGT00940000156946) and conserved syntenies with human ENPEP on Hsa4 (Fig.

270

S4B,C) verify orthology. Cells in the Atlas that expressed enpep also expressed ace and ace2 in c152 and

271

c168 (Fig. 4C vs. Figs. 3B, 4B), increasing the relevance of this cell type to COVID-19.

272

Anpep (alanyl aminopeptidase) metabolizes Ang III to Ang IV (Fig. S1.11) and is a receptor for the human

273

common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). Humans have a single ANPEP gene, but

274

zebrafish has five ANPEP-related genes distributed on three chromosomes. To connect the zebrafish

275

genome to human biology, we analyzed gene trees and conserved syntenies. Results showed that before the

276

divergence of lobe-finned and ray-finned vertebrates, a tandem duplication produced anpep and anpepl

277

genes (Fig. S5,S6). The anpepl gene was lost in stem lobe-finned vertebrates. In ray-finned vertebrates, the

278

TGD produced â€˜aâ€™ copies of both anpep and anpepl on one chromosome and â€˜bâ€™ copies of both genes on the

279

duplicate chromosome. One chromosome became Dre7 containing anpepa (ENSDARG00000036809, ZFIN

280

si:ch211-106j24.1) and anpepla (ENSDARG00000089706, ZFIN si:ch211-276a23.5). The â€˜bâ€™ copy fates were

281

more complex: first, a previously identified chromosome fission event (Nakatani and McLysaght, 2017)

282

separated anpeplb (ENSDARG00000041083, ZFIN: anpepa) on Dre18 from the temporary anpepla gene on

283

Dre25, which then duplicated to form the tandemly duplicated anpeplb.1 (ENSDARG00000103878, ZFIN:

284

anpepb) and anpeplb.2 (ENSDARG00000097285, ZFIN: si:ch211-147g22.5). This genomic analysis clarifies

285

relationships of zebrafish ANPEP paralogs necessary to connect human and zebrafish biology.

286

In human, ANPEP is expressed about six times stronger in the duodenum and small intestine than in the

287

third highest organ, the kidney (Fagerberg et al., 2014). In zebrafish, anpepb and anpeplb.1 were expressed

288

in the same intestinal cell type as ace, ace2, and enpep (c152) (Fig. 4D, E). In contrast, anpepa was not

289

expressed in the intestine, but was expressed in a 5dpf blood vessel cell type (c201, Fig. 4F) different from

290

the cell types expressing Angiotensin receptors agtr1b and agtr2, as well as in a few cranial neural crest cells

291

that had developed by 5dpf. The other two ANPEP-related zebrafish genes (anpepla, anpeplb.2) were not

292

expressed in the Atlas. These five zebrafish ANPEP-related genes may share among them the original

293

functions of the ancestral anpep gene, some or most of which might have been retained by the human

294

ANPEP gene.

295

DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) is the receptor for MERS-CoV (Raj et al., 2013). DPP4 inhibitors also inhibit

296

Ace and are anti-diabetic (Abouelkheir and El-Metwally, 2019). Ang II stimulates DPP4 activity in the

297

mammalian kidney (Aroor et al., 2016). Zebrafish dpp4 (ENSDARG00000079420) shares syntenies with

298

human DPP4, verifying orthology (Fig. S7). In the zebrafish Atlas, dpp4 was expressed exclusively in the

299

same cells that express ace, ace2, enpep, anpepa, and anpepb (Fig. 4G), improving the resolution of in situ

300

hybridization (Thisse and Thisse, 2004). These results show that zebrafish orthologs of receptors for at least

301

three coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 (Ace2), HCoV-229E (Anpep), MERS-CoV (Dpp4)) are expressed almost

302

exclusively in the same specialized cell type of the larval digestive tract.

303

Slc6a19 (Fig. S1.12) is a neutral amino acid transporter and forms a heteromeric dimer with ACE2, the

304

human SARS-CoV-19 receptor (Yan et al., 2020). Zebrafish has three SLC6A19 co-orthologs: two

305

(slc6a19a.1 (ENSDARG00000018621) and slc6a19.2 (ENSDARG00000091560)) are tandem duplicates on

306

chromosome Dre19 and the third (slc6a19b, ENSDARG00000056719) on Dre16 represents the TGD

307

duplicate (Fig. 5A), confirmed by the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S8). Double conserved synteny of slc6a19

308

paralogs on Dre19 and Dre16 with human SLC6A19 (ENSG00000174358) on Hsa5 confirms orthology (Fig.

309

5A). SLC6A19 expression is about equally in small intestine, duodenum, and kidney, about 22-fold stronger

310

than the next organ, the colon (Fagerberg et al., 2014). In the Atlas, all three slc6a19 paralogs were

311

expressed exclusively in the same intestinal cell type as ace2 (c152, Fig. 5B-D), as expected if Slc6a19

312

proteins interact in a similar way in zebrafish and human.

313

The role of Slc6a19 in COVID-19 is as yet unknown. Hints, however, come from recent population genetic

314

studies. SLC6A19 and SLC6A18 paralogs are adjacent in human and zebrafish and, along with SLC6a20 on

315

Hsa3, represent a closely related phylogenetic gene clade (Kristensen et al., 2011). In birds, Slc6a19

316

(ENSJHYG00000013510) and Slc6a18 (ENSJHYG00000013530) loci are adjacent and syntenic with

317

Slc6a20 (ENSJHYG00000002729). The phylogeny and genomics imply origin by tandem duplication followed

318

by translocation in mammals after their divergence from the bird lineage. Like Slc6A19 and Ace2, Slc6A20 is

319

expressed in intestinal enterocytes and kidney cells (Romeo et al., 2006). Furthermore, SLC6A20 interacts

320

functionally with ACE2 (Vuille-dit-Bille et al., 2015). Importantly, recent analyses showed that SLC6A20 is at

321

the peak of a genome wide association study for poor outcomes from COVID-19 (Ellinghaus et al., 2020).

322

These findings raise the novel hypothesis that SLC6A20 variants contribute to variation in COVID-19

323

outcomes due to differences in expression or protein function related to interactions with ACE2, the SARS-

324

CoV-2 receptor.

325

Adam17 (Fig. S1.13) is a metalloendopeptidase that cleaves the membrane isoform of Ace2 to make the

326

soluble protein sAce2 (Lambert et al., 2005). Zebrafish has two copies of adam17 in double conserved

327

synteny with human ADAM17 (Fig. 6A), showing that they are co-orthologs of human ADAM17 from the TGD.

328

The zebrafish Atlas showed expression of adam17a (ENSDARG00000043213) stronger in embryonic

329

intestinal epithelium than in larval ace2-expressing c152 cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, several cells in the

330

vascular endothelium expressed adam17a (Fig. 6C). The TGD duplicate adam17b (ENSDARG00000093093)

331

was expressed in the Atlas in a few widely dispersed individual cells. Because expression of adam17

332

paralogs was not detected in c152, zebrafish may not have soluble Ace2; alternatively, a different enzyme in

333

zebrafish might cleave Ace2 to make the soluble form or expression levels may be too low for detection.

334

Tmprss2 (Fig. S1.16) is a transmembrane serine protease that activates the coronavirus spike protein,

335

stimulating virus entry into cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Walls et al., 2020). In

336

humans, TMPRSS2 expression is highest in prostate, followed by the digestive system, and below that, the

337

lung (Fagerberg et al., 2014). TMPRSS2 in human and tmprss2 (ENSDARG00000098686) in zebrafish

338

occupy regions of conserved synteny, confirming orthology (Fig. 6D). Only one intestinal epithelial cell

339

expressed tmprss2 in the Atlas (c168, Fig. 6E) as well as three kidney cells (not shown).

340

Ctsl (cathepsin L) can cleave the spike protein of SARS-CoV (Simmons et al., 2005). CTSL on Hsa9 shows

341

strong conserved synteny with zebrafish ctsla (ENSDARG00000007836) on Dre5 (Fig. 6F). Zebrafish ctslb

342

(ENSDARG00000074306) on Dre12 is in a cluster of 12 ctsl-related tandemly duplicated paralogs; it does not

343

show conserved synteny with human CTSL and thus does not support the conclusion that ctslb is a TGD

344

paralog of ctsla. In the Atlas, ctslb is expressed exclusively in the hatching gland, the egg-shell digesting

345

organ (Rauch et al., 2003 ; Thisse and Thisse, 2004). In contrast, ctsla is expressed in the endothelium (Fig.

346

6G), along with agtr1b and agtr2 (Fig. 3F, H), in the intestine, like ace and ace2, and in liver, kidney, spleen,

347

and gill. Because Ctsl cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV (Simmons et al., 2005), it may also activate the

348

spike protein of SARS-CoV-2; expression of ctsla in zebrafish ace2-expressing cells makes it a likely

349

candidate to model SARS-CoV-2 function in COVID-19.

350

Apelin (Apln, Fig. S1.17-18) peptidets oppose the effects of Ang II (De Mota et al., 2004; Dray et al., 2008;

351

Kasai et al., 2004; Szokodi et al., 2002). Zebrafish has a single copy of apln (ENSDARG00000053279, see

352

ENSGT00390000014020) (Quertermous, 2007; Scott et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2007) that has strong

353

conserved synteny with human (Fig. S9). Expression of apln in zebrafish has been reported in the axial

354

chordamesoderm, notochord, heart primordium, and vasculature (Helker et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2016; Scott

355

et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2007). The Atlas confirms these expression domains; for example, apln was

356

expressed in endothelial cell type c88 (Fig. 7E) at 1,2 and 5dpf but not in the other two endothelial cell types.

357

The co-expression of venous markers (efnb2a, notch3, hey2, and tbx20) and arterial markers (flt4, ephb4)

358

(Fischer et al., 2004; Lawson et al., 2001; Saint-Geniez et al., 2003; Szeto et al., 2002; Thompson et al.,

359

1998; Wang et al., 1998a; Zhou et al., 2015) show that apln was expressed in venous endothelium. In

360

addition, apln was expressed in cardiac muscle (c205) at 1 and 2dpf, cardiac neural crest (c69) at 1dpf,

361

vessel precursors (c117) at 1dpf, NCC type ionocytes at 1 and 2dpf, photoreceptors (c115) at 5dpf, and

362

notochord (c158, c149). These results confirm and extend prior studies (Helker et al., 2015; Kwon et al.,

363

2016; Scott et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2007). A zebrafish knockout mutant allele had normal vasculogenesis

364

(Helker et al., 2015), suggesting that Apln is not required for development of the vessels that secrete it, but

365

affects regulates the migration of myocardial progenitors to the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (Helker et al.,

366

2015; Scott et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2007).

367

Apln receptor (Aplnr, alias Agtr1l1 or Apj) is single copy in mammals but has three copies in zebrafish

368

(aplnra (ENSDARG00000002172), aplnrb (ENSDARG00000036670), and aplnr2 (ENSDARG00000004447,

369

alias aplnr3a (Zhang et al., 2018))). It is claimed (Zhang et al., 2018) that these names do not reflect

370

mammalian orthologs. To resolve this controversy, we investigated phylogenetic trees and conserved

371

syntenies. Phylogenetic analysis for APLNR-related genes (ENSGT01000000214406) showed that human

372

ALPNR (ENSG00000134817) branched with chicken Alpnr (ENSGALG00000004841) and zebrafish aplnr2

373

(ENSDARG00000004447), as expected if these three genes were orthologs (Fig. 7A). Analysis of conserved

374

syntenies showed that about half of Hsa11, including Hsa11p and the proximal part of Hsa11q that contains

375

ALPNR, are orthologous to the portion of Dre7 that contains aplnr2 (Fig. 7C). The TGD copy of this part of

376

Hsa11 includes parts of Dre25 and Dre14 or Dre21, which lost the co-ortholog of aplnr2 (Fig. 7C). Dre8 and

377

Dre10, the locations of aplnra and aplnrb, respectively, had substantially fewer conserved syntenies with

378

Hsa11, suggesting that they represent paralogons from earlier genome duplication events in stem vertebrates

379

(VGD1 and VGD2). These phylogenetic and conserved synteny analyses converged to support the orthology

380

of APLNR in human to alpnr2 in zebrafish. This conclusion differs from an earlier report (Zhang et al., 2018)

381

that did not consider phylogenetic analysis or analyze conserved synteny for the relevant parts of Hsa11 to

382

Dre7. These considerations suggest that changing the name of the zebrafish gene alpnr2

383

(ENSDARG00000004447) to alpnr would conform better to zebrafish nomenclature rules and better connect

384

the zebrafish medical model to human biology.

385

Analysis of the zebrafish aplnra and aplnrb genes in the same tree (ENSGT01000000214406) showed that

386

most teleost clades have orthologs of each gene, that the bonytongues, which branch deep in the teleosts,

387

root each clade; furthermore, spotted gar and reedfish serve as pre-TGD outgroups, as expected from

388

historical species relationships (Fig. 7B). The tree showed that the sister group of the ray-finned

389

aplnra+alpnrb clade is a lobe-finned vertebrate clade rooted on coelacanth and amphibia as expected and

390

includes â€˜reptilesâ€™ and birds (Fig. 7B). This clade, which we tentatively here call the Aplnrl clade, contains only

391

monotremes and marsupials among mammals, indicating that this gene was lost in eutherian mammals

392

(Zhang et al., 2018). Conserved syntenies showed that chicken (Gallus callus) chromosome Gga15, which

393

contains Aplnrl (ENSGALG00000047717), has orthologs on both Dre8 and Dre10, the sites of aplnra and

394

aplnrb, respectively, as well as Dre5 (Fig. 7D). These conserved syntenies independently verify that: 1) Aplnrl

395

was present in the last common ancestor of human and zebrafish; 2) Aplnrl was lost from eutherians after

396

they diverged from marsupials; and 3) the TGD produced aplnra and aplnrb paraogs.

397

These analyses support the hypothesis that the last common ancestor of zebrafish and human had at least

398

two Aplnr-related genes; one became APLNR in human and â€˜aplnr2â€™ in teleosts and the other was lost in

399

eutherians but retained in other tetrapods, and subsequently duplicated in the TGD, becoming â€˜aplnraâ€™ and

400

â€˜aplnrbâ€™ in zebrafish. Renaming aplnr2 (ENSDARG00000004447) to aplnr, aplna (ENSDARG00000002172)

401

to aplnrla, and aplnrb (ENSDARG00000036670) to aplnrlb would better connect zebrafish to human biology.

402

Atlas cells expressing aplnr (ENSDARG00000004447) occupied midline fates, including prominently the

403

floorplate (c176), hypochord (c218), and scleroderm (c33), as well as an embryonic intestinal epithelium cell

404

type (c101). Expression of alpnr was detected in the spleen and heart of zebrafish adults by qPCR (Zhang et

405

al., 2018) and we detected low expression in larval spleen cluster c162 but not in embryonic spleen cluster

406

c210. Expression of aplnr in the Atlas was weak in three cardiac neural crest cells (c69) at 1dpf and a single

407

cardiac muscle cell (c205) at 2dpf but was not expressed in the heart primordium (c147) at 1dpf or embryonic

408

heart tube at 1 and 2dpf (c130). Expression of aplnrla was strongest in endothelial cell cluster c79, which

409

arterial markers flt4 and ephb4 showed to represent arterial cells (c88, Fig. 7G); thus, venous cells were

410

expressing the ligand apln (Fig. 7E) and arterial cells were expressing the receptor gene aplnrla. In addition,

411

aplnrla was expressed in several clusters of basal skin cells (c46, c70, c108, c118, c145), in the pharyngeal

412

endoderm (c45, c179), in the retina (c83) and lens (c106), confirming and extending previous reports (Helker

413

et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2015). Expression of aplnrlb was detected in the Atlas both in the

414

venous and arterial cell clusters (c79 and c88, Fig. 7H), as well as in a few slow muscle cells at 1dpf (c209)

415

and several myoblasts at 2 and 5dpf (c84, c44), confirming in situ hybridizations (Tucker et al., 2007). These

416

single cell gene expression clusters are consistent with Apelin signaling in COVID-19 comorbidities because

417

they act in cardiovascular development (Deshwar et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2007).

418

DISCUSSION

419

These analyses show that: 1) nearly all components of the human Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System

420

are conserved in zebrafish; 2) that zebrafish has multiple paralogs of some RAAS components and we

421

identify their evolutionary relationships to human genes; 3) that zebrafish and human RAAS genes are

422

generally expressed in equivalent cell types; and 4) that a specialized intestinal cell type is a focus of RAAS

423

component expression including the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Because many components of the RAAS

424

function in zebrafish as in humans, these investigations focus attention on genes and cell types essential for

425

utilizing zebrafish as a model to understand mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.

426

Zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS components related to COVID-19 comorbidities.

427

Key conserved RAAS features include ace2 â€“ the zebrafish ortholog encoding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor â€“

428

and ace â€“ the zebrafish ortholog encoding the enzyme that produces Ang II, which exacerbates COVID-19

429

comorbidities and likely worsens disease outcomes. Zebrafish has a functional Renin enzyme (Gomez et al.,

430

1988; Hoshijima and Hirose, 2007; Jones et al., 1990; Liang et al., 2004) that acts on its structurally

431

conserved Angiotensinogen protein (Lu et al., 2016a) to produce Angiotensin with a sequence that matches

432

the ancestral tetrapod sequence and differs from the human form at three positions. After cleavage by Ace,

433

zebrafish Ang II differs at position 1 and 5 from the human form. The zebrafish genome preserves enzymes

434

that metabolize Angiotensin-related peptides, including importantly, Ace, Ace2, Enpep, and Anpep. Zebrafish

435

conserves genes encoding Ang II receptors Agtr1 and Agtr2. Zebrafish also has orthologs encoding Slc6a19,

436

which binds Ace2 and Adam17, the enzyme that creates the soluble form of Ace2. Furthermore, zebrafish

437

has an ortholog encoding Tmprss2, which activates coronavirus spike protein for binding to ACE2 and

438

bringing the virus into human cells. Zebrafish also has the ligand and receptors for the Apelin signaling

439

system.

440

Zebrafish has a single ortholog of most RAAS genes but has duplicates of some. Many zebrafish duplicates

441

of human RAAS genes derive from the teleost genome duplication event, including 1) agtr1a and agtr1b, 2)

442

anpepa and anpepb, 3) slc6a19a and slc6a19b, and 4) aplnrla and aplnrlb. Other duplicated RAAS genes

443

appeared by tandem duplication, including 1) anpep and anpepl, 2) anpepla.1 and anpepla.2; and 3)

444

slc6a19a.1 and slc6a19a.2. The significance of these discoveries is that the actions of both zebrafish co-

445

orthologs must be considered when translating zebrafish science to human biology.

446

The RAAS/Apelin system also provides an example of â€˜ohnologs gone missingâ€™, in which one ohnolog

447

(paralog from a genome duplication) arising in vertebrate genome duplication events is lost in either ray-

448

finned or lobe-finned vertebrates but reciprocally retained in the other taxon (Postlethwait, 2007); this

449

situation happened for Apln receptor genes.

450

Two major RAAS components are missing from zebrafish. First, zebrafish and other ray-finned vertebrates,

451

lack an ortholog of the Ang1-7 receptor MAS1 (Bader et al., 2014; Fournier et al., 2012; Hoffmann et al.,

452

2018). MAS1 is a member of a large gene family derived by genome and tandem duplication events, followed

453

by chromosome rearrangements (Rinne et al., 2019). Some other G-protein-coupled receptor may perform a

454

similar function in ray-finned vertebrates or Ang1-7 may not function in ray-finned vertebrates.

455

The second component of the RAAS missing from zebrafish is aldosterone. In tetrapods, the adrenal steroid

456

aldosterone acts on kidney collecting ducts to stimulate reabsorption of sodium and secretion of potassium

457

and hydrogen ions, thereby regulating water balance and blood pressure. In contrast, teleosts, cartilaginous

458

fishes, and jawless fishes lack aldosterone (Bridgham et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 1998; Nunez and Trant, 1999;

459

Simpson and Wright, 1970). Aldosterone emerged in tetrapods after the evolution of the ability of Cyp11b1 to

460

hydroxylate corticosterone and produce aldosterone (Bulow and Bernhardt, 2002; Jiang et al., 1998; Nonaka

461

et al., 1995). Teleosts nevertheless have the aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) receptor Nr3c2 (Bridgham et al.,

462

2006), which in fish is stimulated by either the aldosterone precursor 11-deoxycorticosterone or by cortisol

463

(Kumai et al., 2014; Sturm et al., 2005). In the Atlas, nr3c2 was expressed in embryonic periderm and larval

464

gills, which help regulate salt balance at these developmental stages (Dymowska et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2010;

465

Hoffmann et al., 2018; Rombough, 2007), suggesting that an ancestral role of Nr3c2 included salt and water

466

balance even in the absence of aldosterone. Zebrafish mutants lacking active nr3c2 responded poorly to a

467

swirling stress test, but their response to hypotonic or hypertonic stress has not been reported (Faught and

468

Vijayan, 2018). We also donâ€™t know whether zebrafish Angiotensin receptors stimulate the release of 11-

469

deoxycorticosterone, cortisol, or another steroid.

470
471

The conservation of nearly all RAAS components makes zebrafish an appropriate model to investigate the
roles of the RAAS in the generation of COVID-19 comorbidities.

472

Zebrafish express COVID-19-related RAAS genes in tissues similar to human.

473

Results showed that, like humans and other mammals, zebrafish liver cells express Angiotensinogen. In the

474

Atlas, 5dpf zebrafish larvae had three types of hepatocytes, two of which expressed agt, adding cellular

475

precision to expression studies in adult zebrafish (Cheng et al., 2006). Induction of Agt expression in

476

mammals relies on cortisol and inflammation (Brasier and Li, 1996; Demura et al., 2015). Cortisol binds the

477

glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 and inflammation acts via interleukins and Tnfa to cause CCAAT-binding

478

proteins like Cebpb and Cebpd to bind Agt enhancer elements. The co-expression of cebpb, cebpd, and to

479

some extent nr3c1 shows that gene expression is as expected if the initiation of the RAAS cascade is similar

480

in humans and zebrafish.

481

Angiotensinogen is cleaved to form Ang I by Renin, which adult kidney juxtaglomerular cells secrete in

482

mammals and zebrafish (Gomez et al., 1988; Hoshijima and Hirose, 2007; Jones et al., 1990; Liang et al.,

483

2004)}(Rider et al., 2015). Renin-expressing cells in fetal mammals first appear in several tissues and organs,

484

but predominantly in the adrenal (Gomez et al., 1988; Sequeira Lopez et al., 2004). Zebrafish apparently

485

shares this developmental pattern because one of the three cells in the Atlas expressing Renin was a cell of

486

the interrenal (the fish adrenal equivalent) (Liang et al., 2004), and the other two were cell types appropriate

487

for different organs, as in mammals.

488

Ace, which cleaves Ang I to Ang II, was surprisingly shown by our scRNA-seq analysis to be co-expressed

489

almost exclusively in a specific cell type in the zebrafish larval intestinal epithelium along with several other

490

RAAS-components. The Atlas identified four different types of intestinal epithelial cells, one embryonic cluster

491

and three larval clusters (Farnsworth et al., 2020). Larval intestinal cluster c152 expressed not only ace, but

492

also ace2, the human ortholog of which encodes the enzyme that degrades Ang II and serves as a SARS-

493

CoV-2 receptor. The coronavirus spike protein is activated after cleavage by Tmprss2, which stimulates the

494

entry of the coronavirus into cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Walls et al., 2020). We

495

found that tmprss2 is also expressed in c152 and two other intestinal epithelium cell types in the Atlas, and it

496

is also strongly expressed in the human digestive system (Fagerberg et al., 2014). Another protease, Ctsl,

497

cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV (Simmons et al., 2005) and we show that ctsla is also strongly

498

expressed in ace2-expressing c152 cells in zebrafish.

499

The c152 cell type also makes the enzymes that cleave Ang peptides encoded by enpep, anpepa, anpepb,

500

and dpp4. Expression of these genes makes the human homolog of c152 cells a nexus of coronavirus

501

infections because: 1) ANPEP is a receptor for the human common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E (Fehr and

502

Perlman, 2015), 2) DPP4 is the receptor for MERS-CoV, the causative agent of the Middle East Respiratory

503

Syndrome (Raj et al., 2013), 3) ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This cell type is likely responsible for

504

the digestive tract symptoms experienced by many COVID-19 patients.

505

C152 cells also express zebrafish slc6a19 genes. In human, SLC6A19 binds ACE2 to form the SARS-CoV-

506

19 receptor (Yan et al., 2020). The co-expression of ace2 and slc6a19 in zebrafish suggests functions shared

507

with human. SLC6A20, which our genomic analysis shows is a likely tandem duplication-derived paralog of

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.278366; this version posted September 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

508

SLC6A19, also interacts functionally with ACE2 (Kristensen et al., 2011; Vuille-dit-Bille et al., 2015).

509

Significantly, SLC6A20 is at the peak of the strongest of two genome wide association study loci for

510

undesirable COVID-19 outcomes (Ellinghaus et al., 2020). We suggest the hypothesis that genetic variants

511

near SLC6A20 affect the severity of COVID-19 symptoms due to variations in interactions with ACE2.

512

Angiotensin peptides are related to COVID-19 comorbidities because they bind to Agtr1 and Agtr2 receptors

513

on vascular cells to help regulate vasoconstriction, and on the adrenal to stimulate secretion of aldosterone,

514

leading to salt and water retention related to the comorbidity of obesity-related kidney damage (Fyhrquist and

515

Saijonmaa, 2008). As in humans, zebrafish scRNA-seq analysis showed that agtr1b is expressed in

516

endothelial cells and confirmed that agtr2 is also expressed in endothelial cells (Wong et al., 2009).

517

The conserved expression of zebrafish RAAS-related genes supports the contention that RAAS regulation

518

and function are similar in zebrafish and human and the novel finding of the nexus of RAAS component

519

expression in a specific intestinal epithelial cell type focuses future research on c152 cells.

520

The zebrafish RAAS functions like that of mammals.

521

Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are major COVID-19 comorbidities (Richardson et al., 2020) and all

522

relate to the role of the RAAS in salt and water balance, vessel function, and inflammation, which all lie

523

downstream of Ang II (Cabandugama et al., 2017; Fyhrquist and Saijonmaa, 2008). In humans, adrenal-

524

derived glucocorticoids and inflammation induce Angiotensinogen (Brasier and Li, 1996; Stockhammer et al.,

525

2010); inflammation also upregulates agt in zebrafish (Stockhammer et al., 2010), suggesting conserved

526

regulatory mechanisms. The role of cortisol in agt regulation in zebrafish remains to be investigated.

527

As in human, Renin transcription in zebrafish is regulated by plasma salt concentration (Hoshijima and

528

Hirose, 2007; Rider et al., 2015). In larval zebrafish, levels of the Renin product Ang II increase after

529

exposure to acidic or ion-poor water (Kumai et al., 2014) similar to the response of Ang II in humans with high

530

levels of circulating sodium (Crowley and Coffman, 2012). Zebrafish ren mutants are normally adult viable but

531

have enlarged swim bladders, expected from aberrant water balance, and dramatically more Renin cells in

532

the kidney, suggesting regulation by a negative feedback loop (Mullins et al., 2019). Treating larval zebrafish

533

with fish Ang I or Ang II peptides caused animals to accumulate Na+ (Kumai et al., 2014), showing that

534

zebrafish larvae respond as expected from the mammalian system. In mammals, Ang II acts on sodium

535

uptake via aldosterone binding to the aldosterone receptor, but fish have no aldosterone, so although the

536

input and outcome are similar between these taxa, the hormones must differ; likely either cortisol or 11-

537

deoxycorticosterone in fish (Sturm et al., 2005). Recent investigations in zebrafish with knockout mutations in

538

the glucocorticoid receptor and the mineralocorticoid receptor promise to clarify these issues (Faught and

539

Vijayan, 2018; Faught and Vijayan, 2020; Ziv et al., 2013).

540

The zebrafish RAAS is pharmacologically similar to that of mammals. The Ace inhibitor lisinopril blocks the

541

effects of Ang I on sodium uptake in zebrafish, as predicted if Ace were required to convert Ang I to Ang II

542

(Kumai et al., 2014). Zebrafish cultured from 24hpf to 96dpf in water containing the Ace inhibitor captopril do

17

543

not differ in survival from controls and neither do fish in water with 5% of the normal salt concentration (Rider

544

et al., 2015), but the combination of captopril and low ionic strength water reduces the survival of larval

545

zebrafish by about 95% and causes an increase in Renin expression (Rider et al., 2015). Ace inhibition by

546

captopril also upregulates ren in adult and larval zebrafish (Hoshijima and Hirose, 2007; Rider et al., 2017;

547

Rider et al., 2015) and affects cardiovascular function (Margiotta-Casaluci et al., 2019). The Ace inhibitor

548

enalapril, used to treat patients with high blood pressure, causes intraocular blood vessels to dilate in

549

zebrafish (Kitambi et al., 2009) as expected from conserved functions. The fact that several different Ace

550

inhibitors have similar effects in humans and zebrafish supports both the physiological conservation of the

551

Ace (Prokop et al., 2015).

552

Drugs that block the Ang II receptor Agtr1 also provide evidence that the RAAS works similar in zebrafish

553

and human. The selective Agtr1 antagonist telmisartan blocks sodium uptake in zebrafish cultured in low

554

ionic strength water as expected if Ang II acts on sodium retention by binding to Agtr1 (Kumai et al., 2014),

555

even though fish lack aldosterone. The high blood pressure medication fimasartan, an Ang II receptor

556

antagonist, also ameliorates zebrafish models of heart failure, normalizing the expression of atrial natriuretic

557

peptide, reducing cell death around the heart, and improving blood flow (Quan et al., 2020). These results

558

show that Agtr1 structure and function are conserved in human and zebrafish.

559

Conclusions

560

These discussions show that zebrafish has nearly all RAAS and Apelin signaling components, distinguish

561

between previously confusing zebrafish orthologs and paralogs of human RAAS-related genes, identify for

562

the first time specific cell types in which zebrafish RAAS components are expressed, and first identify a

563

specific intestinal epithelial cell type that is a previously unrecognized focus of RAAS component expression

564

in zebrafish and likely other vertebrates, including humans. Coupled with data from the literature showing that

565

the RAAS functions in similar ways in zebrafish and human and that RAAS-related drugs tend to act in

566

zebrafish as they do in humans makes zebrafish an ideal model for interrogating the roles of the RAAS in the

567

origin of COVID-19 comorbidities. Coupled with the exquisite imaging that zebrafish embryos and larvae

568

provide and the ease of precise mutagenesis, zebrafish offers a highly useful system for research into the

569

mechanisms of COVID-19 pathologies and comorbidities.

570

MATERIALS AND METHODS

571

Phylogenies and conserved syntenies. To identify genes that encode zebrafish proteins related to the

572

human RAAS, we utilized phylogenetic analysis embedded in the ComparaTree method at Ensembl (Flicek

573

et al., 2010). This method uses phylogenetic distance and tree structure to identify gene duplications. To

574

verify orthologs and co-orthologs of mammalian genes, we analyzed conserved syntenies using the Synteny

575

Database (Catchen et al., 2009). Nomenclature rules for genes and proteins in human, mouse, and zebrafish

576

use conventions described at the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN,

577

https://wiki.zfin.org/display/general/ZFIN+Zebrafish+Nomenclature+Conventions). For non-human

578

sarcopterygians, we use mouse conventions and for actinopterygians, we use zebrafish conventions.

Single cell transcriptomics. Expression patterns of zebrafish RAAS components were identified from the

580

zebrafish single cell transcriptomic Atlas (Farnsworth et al., 2020). Animals: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were

581

reared using standard husbandry ((Westerfield, 2007). Strains used were Tg(olig2:GFP)vu12 for two samples

582

at 1 and 5dpf and one sample at 2 dpf, and Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) for one sample at 2dpf. Embryos were

583

dissociated as described (Farnsworth et al., 2020). Fifteen animals of mixed but unknown sex were used for

584

each of the six batches. Work was conducted under the approval of the University of Oregon IACUC,

585

Protocol # 18-31. Reagents: Dissociated cells were prepared for scRNA-seq using the 10X Chromium

586

platform v.2 chemistry. cDNA libraries were amplified by 15 PCR cycles and sequenced on Illumina Hi-seq or

587

Next-seq. Statistics: Sequencing data were analyzed by Cell Ranger version 2.2.0 (Zheng et al., 2017) and

588

Seurat (Satija et al., 2015). For further details, see (Farnsworth et al., 2020) and

Figure 4. Genomics and expression of ace2, enpep, anpep and dpp4. A. Conserved synteny supports

1082

the orthology of human ACE2 to zebrafish ace2. Expression of ace2 (B), enpep (C), anpeplb (D), anpepb.1,

1083

(E), anpepa (F), and dpp4 (G). All were expressed in c152, the same intestinal epithelium cell type that

1084

expressed ace, except anpeplb, which was expressed in blood vessels at 5dpf and a few neural crest cells,

1085

but not in intestinal epithelium.

Figure 5. Conserved syntenies and scRNA-seq expression of zebrafish orthologs of SLC6A19. A.

1089

Conserved syntenies showing paralogy of a part of Dre16 containing slc6a19b and a portion of Dre19

1090

containing slc6a19a.1 and slc6a19.2 and their relationship to human chromosome Hsa5 around SLC6A19. B-

1091

D. Expression of slc6a19a.1, slc6a19a.2, and slc6a19b, respectively in the zebrafish Atlas was detected in

1092

c152 and c168, which represent the same larval intestinal epithelial cells that were expressing ace and ace2.

Figure 6. Conserved syntenies and expression of adam17, tmprss2, and ctsl. A. Double conserved

1096

synteny between Dre17 and Dre20 confirming orthology of zebrafish adam17a and adam17b to human

1097

ADAM17 and their origin in the teleost genome duplication. B. Expression of adam17a weakly in intestinal

1098

epithelium cells and (C.) stronger in the vascular endothelium. D. Conserved syntenies verify orthology of

1099

tmprss2 to TMPRSS2. E. Expression of tmprss2 was detected in one cell in intestinal epithelium c168 and in

1100

12 other cells broadly dispersed in the atlas. F. Human CTSL shares conserved syntenies with zebrafish

1101

ctsla. G, H. Expression of ctsla in the endothelium and intestinal epithelium, respectively.
