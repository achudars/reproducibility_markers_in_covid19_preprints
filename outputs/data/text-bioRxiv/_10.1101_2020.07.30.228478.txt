Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies the general need to better understand viral infections. The
positive single strand RNA genome of its causative agent, the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes
all viral enzymes. In this work, we focus on one particular methyltransferase (MTase), nsp16, which in
complex with nsp10 is capable of methylating the first nucleotide of a capped RNA strand at the 2′-O
position. This process is part of a viral capping system and is crucial for viral evasion of the innate immune
reaction. In light of recently discovered non-canonical RNA caps, we tested various dinucleoside
polyphosphate-capped RNAs as substrates for nsp10-nsp16 MTase. We developed an LC-MS-based
method and discovered five types of capped RNA (m7Gp3A(G)-, Gp3A(G)- and Gp4A-RNA) that are
substrates of the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Our technique is an alternative to the classical isotope labelling
approach for measurement of 2′-O-MTase activity. Further, we determined the IC50 value of sinefungin
(286 ± 66 nM) to illustrate the value of our approach for inhibitor screening. In the future, this approach
can be used for screening inhibitors of any type of 2′-O-MTase.

Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the current
COVID-19 pandemic [1] that has already infected more than ten million human beings and claimed over
600 thousand lives according to the World Health Organization (WHO, www.who.int). It belongs to the
Coronaviridae family that has already produced at least two other deadly human viruses during the last two
decades. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus was identified as the virus causing atypical
pneumonia in the Guangdong Province of China in 2002 [2] and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS) virus was responsible for the outbreak of a respiratory disease in 2012 in the Arabian Peninsula
region [3].
Coronaviruses are now recognized as a major threat to global human health [4]. Their genome is a singlestranded positive sense RNA that encodes four structural and sixteen non-structural (nsp1-16) proteins [5].
It is the non-structural proteins that perform all enzymatic activity essential for the viral lifecycle that are
not available in the host cell. Those are the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp); the two proteases,
papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like main proteases (3CLpro); the nsp13 helicase and two
methyltransferases [5]. Each of these enzymes is a potential target for antivirals [6] and SARS-CoV-2
enzymes are therefore intensively studied. The prime target is the RdRp, a heterotrimeric protein complex
composed of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12. The only small molecule currently approved for experimental treatment
by the FDA, remdesivir, inhibits the RdRp [7]. The RdRp was well structurally characterized including its
interaction with RNA and with remdesivir [8-11]. Also the structure and first inhibitors of the main protease
3CLpro were recently described [12] and the first structures of MTases were solved [13-15].
Innate immunity is a crucial part of the human immune system and viruses have evolved abilities to evade
it [16]. The 5′-end of the nascent RNA is a part of the pattern recognized by the RIG-I (retinoic acidinducible gene I) pattern recognition receptor. It recognizes short viral dsRNA with a 5′-triphosphate [17]
or 5′-diphosphate [18] which leads to interferon (IFN) expression. Subsequently IFN-induced proteins with
tetratricopeptide repeats 1 and 5 (IFIT 1 and IFIT5) sequester uncapped (5′-triphosphorylated) and 5′capped RNAs lacking 2′-O-methylation at the first transcribed nucleotide (RNA carrying cap-0) which
prevents binding to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E) and inhibits its translation [19].
Coronaviruses have two RNA MTases, nsp14 and nsp16, that ensure the creation of the RNA cap (Figure
1). Nsp14 is an N7-MTase that methylates the first GTP nucleobase and, subsequently, nsp16, a 2′-OMTase methylates the following nucleotide. Interestingly the SARS-CoV nsp16 is only active when it is in
complex with nsp10 that acts as its activation factor [20].

The chemical variations in RNA caps and their
physiological

implications

are

not

fully

understood. Recently, it has been shown that
beside the common canonical m7Gp3N cap,
RNA can be capped by cofactors such as
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [21, 22] or
coenzyme A [23, 24]. While the regulatory role
of the NAD-cap in bacteria has been partially
elucidated [25], its function in mammalian cells
has not been fully understood yet [26], albeit it
was suggested that it promotes RNA decay
[22]. The role of the CoA-cap is unknown.
Recently, we reported the discovery of an
entirely new class of 5′ RNA caps in bacteria
[27]. These caps have the structure of
dinucleoside polyphosphates (NpnNs) and are
incorporated into RNA co-transcriptionally by
the RNA polymerase [28]. Dinucleoside
polyphosphates have been known for more than
50 years and have been detected in all
kingdoms of life, including human cells [29].
They are often called alarmones, as their
intracellular concentration increases under
stress condition [30]. As NpnNs are also present
also in eukaryotic cells, we hypothesize that
they might be incorporated into RNA as non-

canonical initiating nucleotides where they can
represent an additional layer of information. Moreover, NAD or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) capped
RNA was detected in viral particles of Dengue 2 virus [31], suggesting that non-canonical RNA caps might
play a role in the viral life cycle.
So far, RNA capped with non-canonical initiating nucleotides such as NAD, CoA or NpnNs have not been
studied as substrates for any viral encoded enzyme.

Here, we aimed to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 2′-O-MTase. We prepared a recombinant
nsp10-nsp16 complex and analysed its substrate specificity using LC-MS. First, we tested whether nsp10nsp16 is capable of methylation of free caps or short hexamer RNA capped with canonical and noncanonical RNA nucleotides. As we did not observe any methylation of the free caps and the methylation of
the short hexamer RNA was only partial, we used a longer RNA (35mer). Usually, the methylation of RNA
at the 2′-O of ribose is studied by radioactive labelling [20]. We developed a new general technique that
can be used for the analysis of any cellular or viral RNA MTase. RNA prepared bearing various caps in
vitro is treated with an MTase and then digested by the Nuclease P1 into nucleotides and caps. The
efficiency of the reaction is followed by LC-MS analysis of digested RNA before and after methylation
reactions. Our analysis showed that nsp10-nsp16 2′-O-MTase can methylate ribose at the 2′ position of
RNA capped with m7Gp3A, Gp3A, m7Gp3G, Gp3G and Gp4A. We discovered that the m7Gp3A-RNA was
the best substrate for nsp10-nsp16 in accordance with studies on MTases from other coronaviruses [20, 32,
33]. We also show that this method is suitable for characterization of MTases inhibitors. As a model
compound, we used the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin [34] and we obtained an IC50 value of 286 ± 66
nM.

Results and Discussion
Methyltransferase complex of nsp10-nsp16 does not methylate free RNA caps
In the light of our recent discovery of a new class RNA caps based on dinucleoside polyphosphates (NpnNs)
[27], we tested whether nsp16/nsp10 may methylate 2′-O position of ribose from various NpnNs. We let
m7Gp3A, Gp3A, Ap3A, m7Gp3G, Gp3G, Np4N (N=A, G) react with nsp10-nsp16 complex in the presence
of SAM for 2 h at 30 °C or 37 °C. The reaction mixture was analysed by HPLC. We did not observe any
2′-O-methylated products. This finding was in an agreement with previously observed SARS-CoV nsp10nsp16 activity [20] (Figure S1).
Methyltransferase complex of nsp10-nsp16 partially methylates the short m7Gp3A-RNA
We also tested whether a short RNA (6mer) capped with various dinucleoside polyphosphates can be
methylated by this complex. The hexameric RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA
polymerase and free caps. After HPLC purification, RNA was treated by nsp10-nsp16 complex with SAM
for 2 h at 30 °C. The samples were then digested by the nuclease P1 to release 5’-mononucleotides and
intact RNA caps and analysed by HPLC. From all the tested substrates (m7Gp3A-, Gp3A-, NAD-RNA) only
m7Gp3A-RNA was methylated in approximately 20 % yield (Figure S2). This experiment showed that the

activity of the complex can be observed once a hexameric RNA is used. Although for the development of
an inhibitor screening assay another approach with higher enzymatic activity is desired.
LC-MS method for the methyltransferase activity of nsp10-nsp16
Since the hexamer RNA was not an ideal substrate for nsp10-nsp16, we prepared a 35mer RNA with
m7Gp3A cap by in vitro transcription and treated it with nsp10-nsp16 complex and SAM at 30 °C for 30
min, 1 h and 2 h. After indicated times, the samples were digested by Nuclease P1 and analysed by LC-MS
[27]. We followed the disappearance of the unreacted cap (m7Gp3A) and observed the formation of 2′-Omethylated m7Gp3A (m7Gp3Am). After 2 h, all m7Gp3A cap was converted to m7Gp3Am. We choose these
conditions for the following screening of other capped-RNAs.

We tested thirteen differently capped RNAs in total (m7Gp3A, m6Ap3A, m7Gp3G, Ap3-5N, Gp3-4G, NAD,
CoA) as a substrate for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 MTase complex. The RNA was prepared as a 35mer
by in vitro transcription, treated by the nsp10-nsp16 complex in the presence of SAM at 30°C for 2 h.
Afterwards, the samples were digested by nuclease P1 and the disappearance of the unreacted cap and
formation of the methylated strand was observed (Figure 2A). The efficiency of the enzyme activity was

calculated by disappearance of the unreacted cap (Figure 2B). The values were normalized using guanosine
monophosphate (GMP) area under the curve (AUC). Under the conditions optimized for m7Gp3A-RNA,
four other capped RNAs (Gp3A-, Gp3G-, m7Gp3G- and Gp4A-RNA) were methylated at the 2′-O position
of the +1 nucleotide. All of them were methylated approximately from 50 % to 10 % (Figure 2C, Figure
S3-7) in comparison with m7Gp3A-RNA. When Ap3G was incorporated into RNA in the opposite manner
[28], i.e. A is flanking, such capped RNA was not accepted as substrate of nsp10-nsp16 MTase at all.
Besides NpnNs-RNA, which have not been detected in eukaryotic cells so far, we also tested the recently
discovered eukaryotic NAD-[22] and CoA-RNA [24] as substrates for the nsp10-nsp16 MTase. Even
though the NAD cap has a positive charge similar to that of the canonical m7Gp3A cap, we did not observe
any methylated products. Ap3-5A-, m6Ap3A-, Gp5A-, Gp4G-, m7Gp4G-, and CoA-RNA were not accepted
as substrates either. In general, the common pattern shared by all methylated substrates is a polyphosphate
bridge with 3 to 4 phosphates and a flanking G (Figure 3). Moreover, methylation at the N7 position of G
led to a higher yield of 2′-O methylation of the +1 nucleotide, both m7Gp3A-RNA and m7Gp3G-RNA were
better substrates for the nsp10-nsp16 MTase than their non-methylated counterparts Gp3A-RNA and Gp3GRNA (Figure 2C). This finding is in a good agreement with observations on other coronaviruses, showing
that the methylation at the position N7 of the flanking guanosine occurs first and the 2′-O methylation at
position +1 follows as the second step.

any RNA MTase and RNA of any sequence. We prepared the m7Gp3A-RNA substrate in vitro and treated
it with the nsp10-nsp16 MTase in the presence of SAM and various concentration of the inhibitor. As a
model inhibitor, we chose the pan-MTase inhibitor Sinefungin [35]. We optimized the MTase reaction
conditions to reach half conversion of the starting capped-RNA. The LC-MS was performed in a positive
mode to ensure higher sensitivity of the measurement. Using this method, we were able to determine the
IC50 value of Sinefungin as 286 ± 66 nM (Figure 4). This value is in a good agreement with the previously
published value (736 ± 71 nM) for the SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 MTase obtained by a filter-binding assay
[20].
Discussion
Here, we report on the development of an LC-MS-based method for analysis of RNA methylation. Our
method is non-radioactive which is the current trend for safety reasons and also advantageous for high
throughput screening [36, 37]. We applied our method to the nsp16 MTase from the SARS-CoV-2 to
characterize this important drug target. In total, we tested fourteen differently capped RNAs to characterize
the substrate specificity of nsp16. As expected, based on the similarity to the SARS-CoV nsp16, the best
substrate was m7Gp3A-RNA [20]. However, we observed that RNAs modified with different caps can also
be efficiently methylated: Gp3A – 49 %, Gp3G – 23 %, m7Gp3G - 36 % and Gp4A - 10 %. This is,
surprisingly, not in contradiction to results obtained on coronaviral MTases because previous studies on the
SARS-CoV nsp16 used a short (5mer) RNAs that can be methylated only when m7Gp3A capped [20] which
we observed as well when using short 6mer RNA (Figure S1). This has important implication for the viral
life cycle. Here we show that RNA that is not yet methylated by the nsp14 N7 MTase can be also a substrate
for the 2'-O nsp16 MTase albeit not as good substrate. Nevertheless, this observation challenges the dogma
of step-by-step methylation process of coronaviral RNA (Figure 1). Interestingly, the observation of four
different caps (Gp3A, Gp3G, m7Gp3G and Gp4A) also accepted as a substrate for the nsp16 MTase could
also play a regulatory role in the stability of viral RNAs. Coronaviruses produce besides the ~30 kb genomic
RNA (serves as mRNA for nsp1-16 proteins) also up to ten subgenomic mRNAs that encode structural and
accessory proteins [5]. It would be tempting to speculate that methylation of the subgenomic RNAs could
serve a regulatory role and control expression of coronaviral structural and accessory proteins, however,
that is unlikely because it was reported that each positive sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA starts with the same 5'
leader sequence [38]. However, various caps can be on an identical sequence. For several polymerases it
was shown that if NpnNs are in the proximity of the RNA polymerase, then it accepts them as non-canonical
initiating nucleotides [28]. So far, we do not know, if that is also the case for the coronaviral RdRp.
The SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 MTase is an important drug target. Often, drug-like candidate molecules are found
using high throughput screening (HTS) [39] and subsequently optimized using medicinal chemistry. Our

LC-MS-method could be easily optimized for HTS using a robotic pipeline and small analytical high
throughput LC-MS instruments [40, 41] providing a new tool for drug discovery against COVID-19.
Taken together, our LC-MS based approach and an in-depth analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 has
a broader substrate specificity than previously believed. Especially the ability of nsp16 to use a nonmethylated Gp3A has important implications for the viral life cycle because it reveals that nsp16 can, in
principle, act before the nsp14 N7 MTase.

Material and methods
General
All chemicals were either purchased from Merck or Jena Biosciences and used without further purification.
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Generi Biotech. m7GpppA was synthesized in house according to
Baranowski et al. [42] as detailed in Supplementary Methods.
Protein expression and purification
The plasmid encoding for nsp10 and nsp16 proteins was described previously as was the purification
protocol [13]. Briefly, the expression vector was transformed into E.coli BL21 cells and the cells were
grown at 37°C in LB media supplemented with 25 µM ZnSO4 until the OD600 nm reached 0.5. Subsequently,
the expression was induced by IPTG (final concentration 300 µM) and the temperature lowered to 18°C
overnight. Cells were harvested, resuspended, and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8,
300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were
purified by affinity chromatography using the NiNTA agarose (Machery-Nagel), dialyzed against lysis
buffer and digested with Ulp1 protease at 4°C overnight. The last purification step was size exclusion
chromatography at the HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in SEC buffer
(10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Purified proteins were concentrated to 7
mg/ml and stored in -80°C until needed.

Preparation of hexamer
In vitro transcription was performed in a 50 L mixture containing: 80 ng/L of template DNA (6A), 1
mM NTPs (only those necessary for the RNA production), 1.6 mM NpnNs, 5% DMSO, 0.12% triton X100, 12 mM DTT, 4.8 mM MgCl2 and 1x reaction buffer for T7 RNAP and 62.5 units of T7 RNAP (New
England BioLabs, NEB). The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After incubation the samples were
injected, without any further purification, in the HPLC and only the hexamer RNA was collected. The
purified RNA was dried up on a Speedvac system for three times to remove the excess of
Triethylammonium acetate (TEAA).
In vitro transcription with T7 RNAP for 35mer
In vitro transcription was performed in a 50 or 75 L mixture containing: 80 ng/L of template DNA (35A
or 35G), 1 mM NTPs, 1.6 mM NpnNs (or ATP or GTP for the control experiments), 5% DMSO, 0.12%
triton X-100, 12 mM DTT, 4.8 mM MgCl2 and 1x reaction buffer for T7 RNAP and 62.5 units of T7 RNAP
(New England BioLabs, NEB). The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37°C.

DNAse I treatment
After the transcription, the DNA template was digested by DNAse I to obtain pure RNA. Transcription
mixture (50 μL), 6 μL of 10× reaction buffer for DNAse I (10 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2,
pH 7.6 at 25 °C, supplied with the enzyme) and 4 units of DNAse I (NEB) were incubated at 37 °C for
60 min. The enzyme was thermally deactivated at 75 °C for 10 min followed by immediate cooling on ice.
All samples were purified with RNA Clean and ConcentratorTM from ZYMO research for further use.
nsp10-nsp16 reaction for screening of the substrates
To test the methyltransferase activity, the cap or the capped-RNA samples were divided into two parts. The
positive control contained 200 µM of free cap or ~40 µM of the RNA (in vitro transcribed after DNAse I
treatment and purified on RNA Clean and ConcentratorTM), 1 mM of SAM and 1.5 μM of nsp10/16 in the
reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, pH 8 at 25 °C). nsp10-nsp16 was replaced
by water for the negative control. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The enzyme was heat
deactivated at 75 °C for 10 min followed by immediate cooling on ice. The reaction with free caps was
analyzed without further purification by HPLC and capped-RNA was digested before analysis by LC-MS.
HPLC Data Collection and Analysis
HPLC was performed using a Waters Acquity HPLC e2695 instrument with PDA detector and with a
Kinetex ® XB-C18 column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm x 50 mm). The mobile phase A was 100 mM TEAA pH 7,
and the mobile phase B 100% acetonitrile. The flow rate was kept at 1 mL/min and the mobile phase
composition gradient was as follows: linear decrease from 0% to 12% B (6.5% for dimer analysis) over 20
min; linear decrease to 100% B over 7 min; maintaining 100% B for 3 min; returning linearly to 0% B over
10 min. Waters Fraction Collector III was used for collection of the hexamer RNA.
RNA digestion for LC–MS
The capped-RNA after nsp10-nsp16 reaction was digested using 3 U of Nuclease P1 (Merck) in 50 mM
ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested RNA was purified using AmiconMillipore filters 10 kDa (Merck) to get rid of Nuclease P1. The flow through was dried on a Speedvac
system and dissolved in 10 μL of a mixture of acetonitrile (10%) and ammonium acetate (10 mM, pH 9).
LC–MS data collection and analysis
LC–MS was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC SYNAPT G2 instrument with an Acquity UPLC
BEH Amide column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm, Waters). The mobile phase A consisted of 10 mM
ammonium acetate, pH 9, and the mobile phase B of 100% acetonitrile. The flow rate was kept at
0.25 mL/min and the mobile phase composition gradient was as follows: 80% B for 2 min; linear decrease
to 50% B over 4 min; linear decrease to 5% B over 1 min; maintaining 5% B for 2 min; returning linearly
to 80% B over 2 min. For the analysis, electrospray ionization (ESI) was used with a capillary voltage of
1.80 kV, a sampling cone voltage of 20.0 V, and an extraction cone voltage of 4.0 V. The source temperature
was 120 °C and the desolvation temperature 550 °C, the cone gas flow rate was 50 L/h and the desolvation
gas flow rate 250 L/h. The detector was operated in negative ion mode. 8 μL of the dissolved material was
injected and analyzed.

MassLynx software was used for data analysis and quantification of the relative abundance of all caps. The
Area Under the Curve (AUC) for all cap in the positive and negative samples were calculated and
normalized for the area of GMP of each negative. The decreasing of the AUC of the starting material
(unmethylated cap) in the nsp10-nsp16 treated sample was compared with the AUC of the starting material
(unmethylated cap) in the untreated sample and expressed as percentage.
nsp10-nsp16 reaction for testing of inhibitor
For each reaction ~10 µM m7Gp3A-RNA (in vitro transcribed, DNAse I treated and purified on RNA Clean
and ConcentratorTM), 100 μM of SAM, 500 nM of nsp10-nsp16 and 50 nM – 5 μM of Sinefungine were
added in the reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, pH 8 at 25 °C). The mixtures
were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The enzyme was heat deactivated at 75 °C for 10 min followed by
immediate cooling on ice. The m7Gp3A-RNA was digested by Nuclease P1 and analyzed by LC-MS.
LC–MS condition for screening of the nsp10-nsp16 inhibitor
The LC-MS conditions were optimized for the highest signal/noise ratio of m7Gp3Am RNA cap. LC–MS
was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC SYNAPT G2 instrument with an Acquity UPLC BEH Amide
column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm, Waters). The mobile phase A consisted of 10 mM ammonium acetate,
pH 9, and the mobile phase B of 100% acetonitrile. The flow rate was kept at 0.25 mL/min and the mobile
phase composition gradient was as follows: 80% B for 2 min; linear decrease to 50% B over 4 min; linear
decrease to 5% B over 1 min; maintaining 5% B for 2 min; returning linearly to 80% B over 2 min. For the
analysis, electrospray ionization (ESI) was used with a capillary voltage of 2.7 kV, a sampling cone voltage
of 30.0 V, and an extraction cone voltage of 3.0 V. The source temperature was 120 °C and the desolvation
temperature 500 °C, the cone gas flow rate was 70 L/h and the desolvation gas flow rate 600 L/h. The
detector was operated in positive ion mode. 8 μL of the dissolved material was injected and analyzed.

Synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of m7GpppA
m7GpppA (2160 mOD, 0.101 mmol, 72%) was synthesized by coupling between adenosine 5’-diphospahte
triethylammonium salt (ADP) and N7-methylguanosine 5’-phosphorimidazolide sodium salt (m7GMP-Im),
which were both prepared as described earlier (Baranowski, J. Org. Chem. 2015, 80, 3982−3997).
ADP (2100 mOD, 0.140 mmol) was mixed with DMSO (0.8 mL) and ZnCl2 (228 mg, 1.68 mmol) and left
for 10 min under vigorous stirring at room temperature. Then, m7GMP-Im (3985 mOD, 0.350 mmol) was
added and the reaction progress was monitored by RP HPLC until total conversion of ADP to m7GpppA
was observed. The reaction was quenched by addition of a solution of Na2EDTA (8−10 mmol) and NaHCO3
(∼35 mmol) in deionized water (10 ml). The product was purified by DEAE Sephadex chromatography
using a linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (0.9 M) in water. Fractions containing the
desired products (as verified by UV, HPLC, and MS analysis) were mixed together and evaporated under
reduced pressure with repeated additions of 96% and, then, 99.8% ethanol (to decompose TEAB and
remove residual water, respectively). The product was additionally purified by semi-preparative RP HPLC
on a VisionHT C18 HighLoad column (Dr. Maisch, 250 mm x 20 mm, 10 µm, flow rate 5 mL/min) using
a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05 M ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.9). The final product was
lyophilized three times from water and analyzed by NMR and electrospray MS (ESI-).
