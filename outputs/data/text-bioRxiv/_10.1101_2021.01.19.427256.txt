Abstract

23

Solid-state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for

24

emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining cost-effective manufacturing with

25

high sensitivity, specificity and fast sensing response, remains challenging. Here we develop

26

low-temperature solution-processed In2O3/ZnO heterojunction transistors featuring a

27

geometrically engineered tri-channel architecture for rapid real-time detection of different

28

biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the quasi-

29

two-dimensional electron gas (q2DEG) at the buried In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close

30

proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri-channel

31

design enables strong coupling between the buried q2DEG and the minute electronic

32

perturbations occurring during receptor-analyte interactions allowing for robust, real-time

33

detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (aM) concentrations. By functionalizing the tri-

34

channel surface with SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)

35

antibody receptors, we demonstrate real-time detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein

36

down to attomolar concentrations in under two minutes.

Miniaturised biochemical sensors fabricated via high-throughput manufacturing methods

3

promise cost-effective, large-volume production for use in various technology sectors1. The

4

present needs for biochemical detection are diverse and include environmental monitoring2,

5

security systems3, and preventative medical care4. An ideal biochemical sensing platform

6

should be able to accommodate a wide range of applications in biological and chemical

7

detections with high-sensitivity5 and selectivity6. Among the various types of sensing platforms,

8

a solid-state transistor sensor is a highly-anticipated tool that could address these requirements

9

as it provides the functionality of a transducer for converting a biochemical interaction into an

10

amplified electrical signal7. This characteristic enables direct readout without the need of bulky

11

peripheral driving (opto)electronics, such as amplifiers, excitation light sources and photo-

12

detectors8.

13

For the successful use of solid-state transistors as biosensors, the channel should exhibit

14

a large surface area9 and tuneable surface chemistry10. The former allows tethering of a

15

sufficient quantity of molecular receptors whilst the latter helps to preserve charge transport in

16

the channel without unintentionally reacting with the environment. One widely reported

17

biosensor technology platform is based on silicon-nanowire (Si-NW) transistors, but their

18

manufacturing remains technologically demanding11,12,13. Alternative technologies such as

19

solid-state thin-film transistors (TFT) made of metal oxide semiconductors offer scalable

20

manufacturing and intriguing physical properties14-17. However, due to parasitic gating effects

21

and associated performance deterioration18-21, the use of metal oxide transistors as biosensors

22

has remained limited with most effort dedicated on liquid-gated transistors (LGTs)6,22-24. In

23

spite of being one of the most studied device, LGT biosensors face the detrimental Debye

24

screening effect6,25,26 – a direct result of the operating principles that rely on electrochemical

25

reactions27, or on the movement of analytes28, upon liquid-gating. Thus managing or

26

overcoming the Debye screening effect is critical for developing ultra-sensitive transistor-

27

based sensor technologies for emerging applications29.

28

Here, we introduce a nanometres-thin In2O3/ZnO heterojunction channel and combine

29

it with a geometrically engineered tri-channel architecture several millimetres in size as a

30

universal platform for rapid, selective and ultra-sensitive biosensing. The all-solid-state device

31

features a central sensing channel and two side channels featuring a quasi-two-dimensional

32

electron gas (q2DEG) formed at the buried heterointerface a few nanometres below the

33

channel’s surface. The flexible surface chemistry of metal oxides, on the other hand, allows

34

direct functionalisation of different receptors. The unusual channel architecture offers ultrahigh

surface-area-to-volume ratio (106 cm2 cm-3) and facilitates nm-proximity between the

2

electrostatic perturbations occurring during surface-tethered receptor and analyte interaction,

with the buried q2DEG channel. These unique features enable simultaneous signal transduction

4

and amplification in an all-solid-state TFT platform enabling real-time detection of specific

5

biomolecules down to attomolar (aM) concentrations under physiological relevant conditions.

6

As a proof-of-concept we demonstrate selective sensing of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute

(LoD) of 865 aM.

Quasi-two-dimensional oxide heterojunction channel

11

We hypothesised that our recently developed solution-processed, high electron mobility

12

In2O3/ZnO heterojunction (HJ) transistors30 offers unique features that could prove attractive

13

for biosensing. Firstly, the buried electron channel located at the oxide HJ is physically

14

separated from the receptor units tethered on its surface a few nm above31,32. This feature is

15

expected to prevent degradation of electron transport upon sensing (due to Coulomb scattering)

16

and preserve the transistor’s performance. This is not the case for most biosensor transistors

17

reported to date where the channel interacts directly with the receptor units and hence the

18

analyte. To overcome this, liquid gating has been exploited for analyte detection in the liquid

19

phase6,22,33. Secondly, the high electron mobility of the HJ TFTs offers the possibility for large

20

electrical signals that are easy to detect and amplify even in large-size devices31.

21

We fabricated metal oxide HJ transistors using the staggered bottom-gate, top-contact

22

(BG-TC) architecture shown in Fig. 1a. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy

23

(HRTEM) analysis (Fig. 1b) of the channel reveals the formation of a well-defined HJ channel

24

with thickness in the range of 8-10 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements show

25

the existence of smooth layers as being deposited sequentially (Fig. 1c-d). In2O3 exhibits the

26

lowest peak-to-peak height (Z) of 1.87 nm with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) value

27

of 0.20 nm, which are comparable to that of SiO2 (Z = 1.91 nm, RMS = 0.21 nm). Subsequent

28

deposition of ZnO atop In2O3 leads to a slightly rougher topography (Z = 4.00 nm, RMS =

29

0.58 nm) indicative of a more textured surface31,34.

30

The In2O3/ZnO forms a type-II heterojunction where electrons migrate from the

31

conduction band (CB) of ZnO to that of In2O3, leading to the formation of a q2DEG (Fig. 1e)32.

32

The latter resembles 2DEG systems found in high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) based

33

on epitaxial inorganic heterointerfaces35. Although uncommon, the existence of q2DEG in

All solid-state tri-channel transistor sensor

2

To investigate the suitability of the In2O3/ZnO transistors for biosensing, we fabricated devices

3

based on a tri-channel configuration on 4-inch Si wafers (Fig. 2a). The source-drain (S-D)

4

electrodes are deposited atop the In2O3/ZnO channel followed by the deposition of another

5

ultrathin (2-4 nm) protective ZnO layer. Next the known deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)

6

intercalator37,38 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) was functionalised directly to ZnO39 acting as the

7

DNA receptor. A second functionalisation step using butyric acid (BA) was also applied to

8

ensure complete passivation of the ZnO surface (see Supplementary Note 1 and

9

Supplementary Figure 1). The presence of the PBA molecules was verified using ultraviolet–

10

visible (UV-Vis) absorption measurements before and after functionalisation as evidenced by

11

the appearance of distinct absorption peaks associated with the pyrene unit (Supplementary

12

Figure 2). The completed device consists of two identical ‘conventional’ channels (hereafter

13

termed CC) 100 m in length (L), formed on the sides, and a third long (L = 2000 m) ‘sensing’

14

channel (hereafter termed SC) formed in the central region of the device between the S-D

15

electrodes (see Supplementary Figure 3). This unique channel layout offers a large sensing

16

area channel where the analyte-containing solution can be easily applied while avoiding direct

17

contact with the S-D electrodes (Fig. 2b-c) which is known to induce parasitic gating effects40.

tip (EP). f, 2D (top)/3D (bottom) maps of the electrostatic potential across a tri-channel

source-drain potentials: VD = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 3 V. The relative positions of the S-D electrodes
are shown in the 2D map for VD = 0 V.

15
16

In Supplementary Figures 4 and 5, we plot the transistor transfer and output

17

characteristics, respectively, measured before and after PBA and BA functionalisation. Unlike

18

conventional transistor biosensors22,41, our tri-channel device shows negligible changes in its

19

operating characteristics after receptor functionalisation. The narrow parameter distribution is

20

better illustrated in Fig. 2d which shows the density plots42 of the dual-sweep transfer

21

characteristics for 30 individual tri-channel transistors fabricated on a single wafer. Critically,

22

the tri-channel transistors exhibit robust operation even when subjected to 90 repeated dual I-

23

V sweeps with negligible leakage current (IG) which is critical for optimal device operation and

24

signal amplification (Supplementary Figure 6)43. These data demonstrate the high operational

25

stability and reproducibility of the proposed tri-channel HJ transistor architecture.

26

To better understand the electrostatic potential landscape across our unconventional tri-

27

channel device, we performed scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) measurements (Fig. 2e). Fig. 2f

28

shows the two-dimensional (2D, bottom) and three-dimensional (3D, top) work function (WF)

29

or Fermi energy (EF) maps for a tri-channel device measured. The influence of the buried Al

30

electrodes beneath the ZnO results in local WF changes (3.8-4 eV), with the higher potential

31

observed in the middle of the SC region. SKP measurements were also performed while

32

applying a drain bias (VD) in the range of 0-3 V (Fig. 2g; the respective location of the device

33

illustrated for VD = 0 V image). The application of low voltages (e.g. VD = 0.6-1 V) causes a

34

substantial change within the SC, while increasing the applied bias to 3 V affects the potential

35

landscape across the entire SC region, suggesting strong coupling between the SC and the two

36

side CCs. Thus, the tri-channel architecture appears to enable spatially decoupling of the signal

37

transduction occurring within the SC region from the current-driving CCs.

our previous studies on the same materials31,44,45. The small difference seen in the subthreshold

2

region between the modelled and experimental data is attributed to the presence of trap states

3

in the channel46,47, while the higher off current measured experimentally is due to the use of a

4

common Si++ gate substrate and the un-patterned layout of the In2O3/ZnO channel. Apart from

5

these minor discrepancies, the model provides a good description of the tri-channel transistor

6

operation and validates its applicability.

7

The main function of a transistor biosensor is to induce a perturbation in the channel

8

current upon exposure to an external stimulus (analyte). To best illustrate this process in our

9

and the streamlines of the channel current flow. Fig. 3b-f show the static distributions of the

11

electron density and the streamlines of the current flow within the In2O3/ZnO heterostructure

12

biased at VD = 3 V and VG = -1, 0, 1, 8 and 20 V. The results are in good agreement with our

13

experimental observations and reveal the staggering enhancement in the current density within

14

the In2O3 of the heterointerface31,46. Next, we modelled the electrical characteristics of the

15

device in the presence of an analyte. We hypothesize that the analyte species interacts with the

16

surface-tethered receptor units and induce free charges at the surface of the SC region. To

17

establish the sensing condition close to the limit of detection for our sensor, we assumed the

18

number of additional charges induced by the analyte to be equivalent or lower than the number

19

of mobile charges in the channel. Based on the literature48 and our own measurements on

20

similar metal oxide heterointerface channels31, device operation should remain largely

21

unaltered when the additional electron concentration remains below 1017 cm-3.34 To ensure that

22

this condition is satisfied, we used a more conservative estimation for the analyte-induced

23

electron concentration of 1016 cm-3 and a channel thickness of 10 nm (Fig. 1b). The equivalent

24

surface charge density due to analyte was then derived from the modelling yielding a value of

25

≈1010 cm-2, which will be considered for the different device operating scenarios next.

bias. This is not the case for In2O3 and In2O3/ZnO transistors with conventional channel

geometry (Supplementary Figure 7b,d), where the analyte induces only a small perturbation

in the current around the subthreshold region consistent with filling of sub-gap states49. The

modelled electron density and current flow for the tri-channel transistor biased at VD = 3 V and

2

VG = -1, 0, 1, 8 and 20 V, are presented in Fig. 3h-l, whilst the corresponding modelling results

3

for the conventional channel In2O3 (at VD = 3 V, VG = 1 V) and In2O3/ZnO (at VD = 3 V, VG =

4

-1 and 1 V) transistors are shown in Supplementary Figure 8a-b and 8c-f, respectively.

5

Strikingly, we find that unlike the geometrically engineered heterojunction In2O3/ZnO

6

transistors (Fig. 3h-l), electron flow in the In2O3 device is pinned at the interface with the gate

7

dielectric while being fully decoupled from the surface/analyte (Supplementary Figure 8b).

8

From these data we conclude that the tri-channel design is highly sensitive to the presence of

9

surface charges as compared to conventional channel design, while single layer In2O3 channel

10

transistors are not ideal for all-solid-state biosensing applications.

11

Next, we considered the scenario where the heterojunction transistor is operated in

12

depletion (VG = -1 V) and in the presence of analyte (i.e. additional ≈1010 cm-2 on the SC

13

surface). Clear perturbations in the current flow are observed for both the tri-channel

14

In2O3/ZnO (Fig. 3h-l) and the conventional channel designs of In2O3/ZnO (Supplementary

15

Figures 8d and 8f) transistors. The broader distribution of streamlines seen in the tri-channel

16

is consistent with the large negative shift in the turn-on voltage (VON) of the device seen in Fig.

17

3g. Regardless of the biasing scenarios (depletion or accumulation), the tri-channel architecture

18

shows much stronger coupling to the analyte. Specifically, we find the electron flow

19

streamlines to extend ≈1 nm beneath the SC surface (Fig. 3h-l) due to the asymmetric design

20

of the source-drain electrodes50, which prevent the local electric field to fully pinch-off the

21

channel for VG between -1 to 1 V. As the VG increases (+20 V), the benefits associated with

22

the presence of a q2DEG in the In2O3/ZnO become even more apparent as the area beneath the

23

sensing surface remains free from electrostatic screening induced by the gate (Fig. 3l).

24

Nevertheless, it is known to be more advantageous for solid-state transistor sensors to be

25

operated within the subthreshold region as it yields optimal sensitivity due to high signal gain51.

27

Receptor engineering for ultra-sensitive and real-time biosensing

28

To demonstrate that the working principle of our all-solid-state tri-channel transistor is

29

fundamentally different from that of conventional liquid-gated sensors, we studied the ability

30

of our transistors to detect different types of DNAs (analytes) dispersed in deionised (DI) water

31

rather than in a high ionic strength solution. We note that the latter is essential for the function

32

of liquid-gated transistor sensors in order to drive the analyte towards the semiconducting

33

channel, which in turn modulates its transconductance via electrochemical processes6. To prove

34

that our sensors do not rely on such processes, the DI-water based solutions containing double-9-

stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of different sequences, were

2

applied directly onto the SC area while recording the device’s response. Fig. 4a depicts the

3

envisioned interaction between dsDNA and PBA where the pyrene units on PBA intercalate

4

into the dsDNA52. Fig. 4b-d show the measured transfer characteristics (VD = 3 V) for different

5

concentrations of 20 base-pair segments of synthetic DNAs based on single-stranded adenine

6

(A) [abbreviated as A20], and thymine (T) [abbreviated as T20], as well as their

7

complementary dsDNA (AT)20. For (AT)20, a much larger change in the transistor’s transfer

8

characteristics is observed with the lowest dsDNA concentrations studied down to 100 aM (Fig.

9

4b). The strong response is attributed exclusively to the intercalation of the pyrene units into

10

the minor grooves of the double-stranded (AT)20 since the presence of DI water has no

11

measurable effect (Supplementary Figure 9). The progressive shift of VON towards more

12

negative VG seen in Fig. 4b is consistent with the modelling results of Fig. 3g where we

13

considered the presence of additional free charges on the surface of the SC. This observation

14

indicates that pyrene-NDA association generates free electrons that are eventually injected into

15

the channel. Further evidence supporting our hypothesis comes from sensing experiments

16

involving the single-stranded A20 (Fig. 4c) and T20 (Fig. 4d) where only minute changes are

17

observed in the transistors’ characteristics due to the absence of pyrene-NDA intercalation.

Figure 4 | Tri-channel transistor sensor for synthetic DNA sensing. a, Illustration of the
envisioned intercalation between the pyrene units and dsDNA. b,c,d, Transfer I-V
characteristics (VD = 3 V) measured from PBA/BA functionalised tri-channel transistor sensors
with the presence of three different DNA analytes of (b) (AT)20; (c) A20; (d) T20 at different
analyte concentrations. e, Plot of the increase in areal charge carriers Δeareal that results from
the sensing activity of the tri-channel transistor sensor to the analytes as a function of analyte
concentration. Δeareal is calculated from the shift in the turn-on voltage of the device upon the
application of analyte solution. AT(20) shows the highest response due to its interaction via
intercalation with pyrene units of the PBA-functionalised tri-channel transistor sensor. f, Realtime response signal measured from a PBA/BA functionalised solid-state tri-channel transistor
sensor operated at VG = -1 V and VD = 3 V upon exposure to synthetic (AT)20 with
concentrations from 100 aM to 1 µM. g, recorded response to 100 aM showing ≈30 times

applied to the SC area of the tri-channel transistor. h, Fitting of experimental results of synthetic
AT(20) sensing at different analyte concentrations according to the Langmuir adsorption
isotherm. The error bars denote standard deviations from three real-time measurement sets.

18

In an effort to quantify the sensor’s response, we analysed the change in VON as a

19

function of increasing analyte concentration. This shift reflects the increase in the electron

20

concentration (eareal) within the channel and is given as53

22

Here, Careal is the areal capacitance of the gate dielectric (34.4 nF cm-2), 𝑞 is the elementary

23

charge, VON(init.) is the initial VON measured in the presence of blank solution (no analyte),

24

and VON(conc.) is the transistor’s VON measured upon application of the analyte at each

25

concentration. For simplicity, we assume all electrons are confined in a two-dimensional plane

26

at the vicinity of the oxide HJ32. Fig. 4e shows the evolution of eareal as a function of analyte

27

concentration measured using a tri-channel sensor. (AT)20 induces the highest eareal, a direct

28

consequence of the large VON shift observed in Fig. 4b. These results demonstrate

29

unambiguously that pyrene-(AT)20 intercalation produces signals several orders of magnitude

30

larger than the non-intercalating ssDNAs A20 and T20 and showcase the ability of the tri-

31

channel sensor to differentiate between double and single stranded DNAs without the need for

32

complex fluorescence labelling54. To this end, the DNA conformation with respect to the

33

substrate (i.e. lying-down or standing up), should not be critical as sensing relies exclusively

34

on the charge transfer upon pyrene-DNA association. This hypothesis is corroborated by the

35

sensor’s ability to selectively detect different analytes, such as avidin and SARS-CoV-2 spike

11

Due to the diverse range of biosensor transistor technologies5,6 there is currently no

12

clear consensus on the important figures of merit that can be used to define the performance of

13

such devices. Here we attempt to draw an analogy from the field of phototransistors, since both

14

types of sensors act as transducers with a highly VG-dependent response and define two

15

practical figures of merit namely the responsivity (Ranalyte) and sensitivity (Sanalyte)

16

(Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figure 11). We first investigated the suitability

17

of our tri-channel biosensor TFTs for real-time sensing of (AT)20 at an extremely broad range

18

of analyte concentrations (10-18 to 10-6 M), while simultaneously assessing the sensors’ ability

19

to operate in aqueous conditions9,55. Specifically, we monitored the evolution of ΔID at VG = -

20

1 V and VD = 3 V, as a function of time for different (AT)20 concentrations. The biasing

21

condition were chosen to maximise the sensor’s response by operating it in the subthreshold

22

region51 (Supplementary Figure 12). Fig. 4f shows a representative real-time recording of

23

ΔID/I0 (where I0 = 3.16×10-8 A) for analyte concentrations in the range 10-18 to 10-6 M, where

24

a clear response across the entire range is observed. Even at 100 aM of (AT)20, the tri-channel

25

TFT shows a significant increase in the ΔID by ≈ 30 times (Fig. 4g) in under 2 min. This

26

represents the highest response signal reported to date for biosensing transistors, including

27

liquid-gated devices5,6,24. Importantly, the sensor’s sensitivity can be tuned by the VG as shown

28

in Supplementary Figure 13 where the Sanalyte is plotted vs. (AT)20 concentration for different

29

VG (-1, 0, +1 V). Even at sub-optimal biasing conditions (i.e. VG = 1 V), the measured ID for

30

100 aM (AT)20 increases to 4.2 µA (ΔID ≈ 2.8 µA) which is ≈ 300% higher than the baseline

31

signal (I0 ≈ 1.4 µA) (Fig. 4b). The large ΔID indicates that the actual sensitivity of the tri-

32

channel sensors is well below 100 aM. To this end, we note that in the literature the most

33

frequently reported parameter is the LoD, which is determined by the minimum detectable

34

signals that are often far from suitable for real-time monitoring 5,6,41,56.

1

To further demonstrate the capabilities of our high Sanalyte sensor, we analysed the

2

sensing kinetics using the linear form of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm57,58.

3

Supplementary Figure 14a displays a series of such measurements taken from Fig. 4f but

4

replotted by setting the time (t) at which the different concentrations of analyte were applied,

5

to 0 sec. Supplementary Figure 14b shows a representative trace for 1 pM of (AT)20 where

6

three different sensing stages can be clearly distinguished:

7

(i)

Concentration-limited diffusion stage where the receptor-analyte reaction rate

8

is determined by the diffusive transport of the analyte on the sensor’s surface as

9

its concentration increases.

10

(ii)

11
12
13

Association of analyte with the tethered receptor moieties i.e. ‘primary’ sensing
process.

(iii)

Dissociation of analyte-receptor complexes before reaching a thermodynamic
equilibrium.

14

The rate of the ‘primary’ sensing process depicted in Supplementary Figure 14b is

15

representative of a zero-order reaction and is independent of the analyte concentration or the

16

method with which the analyte solution is being applied. For each concentration, a distinct peak

17

between association and dissociation stages is observed and attributed to the immobilisation of

18

analyte species by the tethered receptors59-61. Therefore, and regardless of the sensing method,

19

the existence of two-phase kinetics relates solely to the association and dissociation stages.

20

Using the high fidelity sensing data from Supplementary Figure 14, the equilibrium constant

21

(Keq) was calculated yielding values of (5.88 ± 0.03) ´ 108 M-1 (Fig. 4h).

22

In addition to short synthetic DNA, we have also tested natural dsDNA extracted from

23

calf thymus tissue, which has much longer DNA sequences. Fig. 5a-b, respectively, show the

24

transfer characteristics (VD = 3 V) and real-time response recorded at fixed VD = 3 V and VG

25

= -1 V (Supplementary Figure 15, I0 = 2.63 × 10-8 A). The response is similar to that recorded

26

for (AT)20 indicating that the sensing mechanism remains identical for the natural dsDNA.

27

Even when aM concentration of the dsDNA is applied, the recorded signal (ΔID/I0) increases

28

by more than 100× (inset of Fig. 5b), further corroborating the unprecedented sensitivity of

29

the tri-channel sensor. When compared to (AT)20, the sensor exhibits stronger response to

30

natural dsDNA with a higher binding constant Keq of (8.71 ± 0.01) ´109 M-1 (Fig. 5c). This

31

difference is attributed to the stronger interaction between the longer sequence of calf thymus

32

DNA and the surface-tethered pyrene receptor.

charged nature of avidin and its electron accepting character. Fig. 5e shows real-time sensing

2

of different concentrations of avidin. Here a higher voltage bias of VD = 3 V, VG = 8 V

3

(Supplementary Figure 16, I0 = 1.89 × 10-5 A) was used in order to compensate for the large

4

positive shift in VON upon biotin-avidin association. Analysis of the binding constant between

5

avidin and surface-immobilised biotin (Fig. 5f) yields a Keq of 1.73 (±0.09) ´ 1010 M-1. This

6

value is lower than that reported for free avidin-biotin pairs (1013–1015 M-1)63,64 – a result most

7

likely attributed to the smaller number of tethered biotin receptors.

8

To summarize, the sensing mechanism in our all-solid-state tri-channel transistor

9

sensors is starkly different to that of liquid-gated sensor platforms5,6,22-28. The sensing process

10

is modelled by considering the generation of free charges on the SC’s surface upon receptor-

11

analyte association (Fig. 3g-l) and its strong coupling to the channel current. The higher

12

gradients in the electron flow streamlines observed towards the HJ/analyte interface and the

13

higher electron density highlight how excess charges are introduced and transported across the

14

device upon receptor-analyte interaction. Importantly, the sensor can be easily repurposed via

15

receptor engineering to detect both negatively (i.e. DNAs) as well as positively charged (i.e.

16

biotin-avidin) analytes. In the case of biotin-avidin interaction the channel current was found

17

to reduce due to the electron accepting nature of the formed complex. Another important

18

feature of the tri-channel sensor is the large size SC and its ability to accommodate a high

19

density of receptors which in turn enable dynamic sensing over an extraordinary wide range of

20

analyte concentrations (Supplementary Figure 14).

22

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein

23

To demonstrate the potential of the tri-channel transistors in a real-world sensing scenario, we

24

engineered the surface of the SC by immobilizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody acceptors designed

25

for specific binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein (Fig. 6a)56. The receptor-binding

26

domain (RBD) of the spike protein is known to bind the human cell receptor angiotensin-

27

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by subsequent viral entry. During binding the

28

positively charged polybasic cleavage site on the spike protein binds strongly with the

29

negatively charged human cell receptor ACE265. We hypothesized that such interaction would

30

induce electrostatic perturbations that are detectable by the tri-channel sensor. The sensing

31

scheme is rather straightforward and could prove highly versatile for the detection of the new

32

corona virus and other pathogens of interest.

To test our hypothesis, we first examined the ability of the sensor to operate under

2

physiological-relevant conditions. The antibody-tethered tri-channel sensor show negligible

3

response upon application of different concentrations of the high ionic strength phosphate

4

buffered saline (PBS) solution onto the SC (Supplementary Figures 17 and 18). Next, a series

5

of PBS solutions containing different concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein were

6

prepared and applied to the SC of the sensor while the transfer characteristics were recorded

7

for each analyte concentration (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Figure 19a). A clear and

8

systematic shift in VON towards more negative gate voltages with increasing analyte

9

concentration, is observed. Strikingly, even at 10 aM the sensor’s response remains large and

10

clearly visible in the quasi-static transfer characteristics of Fig. 6b indicating a high sensitivity.

21

To further demonstrate the versatility of the tri-channel sensor, we performed real-time

22

sensing measurements of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein. Prior to this the sensor was biased

23

at VG = -1 V and VD = 3 V to acquire a stable baseline channel current of ≈1 µA (∆ID/I0 = 0).

Following, PBS solutions containing varying concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1

2

protein where applied sequentially to the SC while the sensor current being recorded in real-

3

time (Supplementary Figure 19b). Evidently, the sensor can detect the analyte across an ultra-

4

wide range of concentrations (aM to pM) demonstrating the tremendous potential of the

5

technology. Similar to dsDNA real-time sensing data, the recorded signal (ΔID/I0) for each

6

concentration increases and reaches an equilibrium followed by a small deep due to the

7

diffusion limited, association and dissociation stages discussed previously (Supplementary

8

Figure 14b).

9

Lastly, we evaluated the specificity of our sensor towards the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1

10

protein by comparing its real-time response against that of Middle East respiratory syndrome

11

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein due to their genome similarities66. As can be seen in

12

Fig. 6c, the tri-channel sensor can differentiate between the two proteins under physiological

13

relevant conditions. For the MERS-CoV protein, the sensor shows no response with the signal

14

remaining largely unaltered with increasing analyte concentration from 1 fM to 100 pM. On

15

the contrary, exposure of the device to SARS CoV-2 spike S1 protein leads to a strong and

16

systematic signal increase with increasing SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein concentration. The

17

lowest concentration at which these differences are detectable can be deducted from Fig. 6c

18

yielding a value of approximately 1 fM56. The LoD67 was estimated by applying the

19

International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) protocol68 to the calibration plot

20

for SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein in Supplementary Figure 19c yielding a value of 865 aM.

Conclusions

23

We have developed a simple-to-manufacture, millimetre-scale, all-solid-state metal oxide

24

transistor sensor that can detect the presence of biomolecules down to attomolar concentrations

25

in real time while being operated under physiologically relevant environments. The unique

26

device architecture combines high sensitivity and a large dynamic range in an all-solid-state

27

sensing platform capable for analyte sensing in the liquid-phase. The versatile surface

28

chemistry of the metal oxides employed allows for the incorporation of different receptor units

29

(e.g. antibodies, enzymatic recognition elements, aptamers), which is anticipated to enable the

30

detection of a broader range of biomolecules with extraordinary sensitivity and specificity.

31

Furthermore, the ability to distinguish between negatively and positively charged biomolecules

32

as well as between the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV spike proteins, showcases the

33

universality of the sensor platform, which could be exploited for addressing the most urgent

34

sensing applications.

METHOD

2

Preparation of metal-oxide precursors. ZnO and In2O3 precursor solutions were prepared by

3

dissolving zinc oxide (99.99%; Sigma-Aldrich) in ammonium hydroxide (50% v/v; Alfa Aesar)

4

at a concentration of 10 mg ml-1 and anhydrous indium nitrate (99.99%; Indium Corporation)

5

in 2-methoxyethanol (99.8%; Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 20 mg ml-1, respectively.

6

As‐prepared solutions were then stirred rigorously at room temperature for 24 h before use.

7

This process yielded clear transparent oxide precursor solutions.

8
9

Fabrication of low-dimensional oxide transistors. Heavily doped silicon (Si++) wafers with

10

a thermally grown SiO2 top-layer (100 nm) were used as the common gate electrode and the

11

gate dielectric, respectively. Prior to the semiconductor deposition, the substrates were

12

sonicated in a solvent bath each lasting for ≈10 min in the following sequence: 1) deionised

13

(DI) water with a Decon 90 detergent (5 vol%); 2) DI water; 3) acetone; 4) isopropanol. The

14

solvent residue was dried with dry nitrogen over the substrate surface. As the last cleaning step,

15

the substrates were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) ozone treatment for 10 min. The In2O3 ultra-

16

thin film was deposited by carrying out spin‐casting of the as-prepared precursor solution onto

17

the Si substrates at 6000 rpm for 30 s in ambient air, followed by a post‐deposition thermal‐

18

annealing process for 60 min at 200 °C in ambient air. The top ZnO layer was deposited with

19

the same procedure as that for the In2O3 layer. Fabrication of the transistors (channel

20

width/length = 1000/100 m/m) was completed with thermal evaporation of 40-nm thick Al

21

top source and drain (S–D) electrodes through a shadow mask in high vacuum (≈10−6 mbar).

22
23

Transistor characterisation. Electrical characterisation of transistors was carried out using

24

three micro-positioners (EB-700, EVERBEING), a homemade probe station and an Agilent

25

B2902A source/measure unit in a nitrogen‐filled glove box.

27

Self-assembled layer preparation and surface modification. To prepare the modified device

28

for DNA sensing, firstly 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA, 97%; Sigma-Aldrich) solution (1 mg ml-

30

and thoroughly rinsed with THF and dried under nitrogen atmosphere. Butyric acid (BA, ≥

31

99%; Sigma-Aldrich) solution (1 mg ml-1 in anhydrous THF) was then applied to the PBA

32

modified surface for 30 min and thoroughly rinsed with THF and dried under nitrogen

33

atmosphere. To prepare the modified device for avidin sensing, biotin (99%; Sigma-Aldrich)

in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF)) was applied on the surface of the transistor for 30 min

solution (0.8 mg ml-1 in anhydrous ethanol) was first applied on the surface of the transistor for

Scanning Kelvin probe measurement. Scanning Kelvin probe investigations were carried out

3

using a KP Technology system (model SKP5050/APS02) with a 1 mm tip. Scanning was

4

achieved by taking an individual Kelvin probe (KP) measurement in one location and then

5

moving the motorised stage to bring the sample in position for the next KP measurement. This

6

was repeated until data was gathered in a grid pattern of 60´60 points, spanning an area of ca.

keep the average tip-to-sample-distance constant. Additional drain bias in the range of 0 to 3

temperature for 5 h in order to immobilise the spike S1 antibodies via covalent bonding. To

3

complete the immobilisation process, the devices were rinsed with 0.1× PBS to remove

4

unbound antibodies. The presence of the antibodies on the surface of the sensing channel was

Device modelling and simulations. The oxide transistor sensors were modelled and simulated

9

using the semiconductor module in COMSOL Multiphysics. The cross-sectional model was

10

constructed based on the actual device dimensions shown in Supplementary Figure 3. The

11

oxide semiconductors were modelled based on material parameters taken from our previous

12

reports31,32,70. The semiconducting In2O3/ZnO interface was modelled as a continuous quasi-

13

Fermi-level heterojunction. The S-D electrodes were modelled as Ohmic contacts whilst the

14

gate was modelled using the Thin Insulator Gate node, employing the same SiO2 dielectric

15

condition as the actual device stack. The analyte was modelled as equivalent surface charges

16

with a density of 1010 cm-2. All the other boundaries were modelled as insulations, indicating

17

no normal flux such as current and electric displacement fields. Due to the large aspect ratio of

18

the ultrathin oxide structures, the mapped mesh was generated for the entire transistor channel

19

area with fine rectangular meshes.
