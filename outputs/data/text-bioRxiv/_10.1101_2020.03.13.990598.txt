Abstract
Recently emerged coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or Wuhan coronavirus) is a causative agent of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading throughout the world now. More than 9,00,000
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 47,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities
have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing
every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2
spread as a global public health emergency and admitted that the COVID-19 is a pandemic
now. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on
the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied
Human SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are
associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have
exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes
of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of
intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome
contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for Nucleocapsid, Nsp8,
and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing

less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2
proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab
polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were
shown to contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based
protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with
specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of the SARSCoV-2 proteome will have important implications for the structural and non-structural
biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.
Significance: The infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe
respiratory disease with pneumonia-like symptoms in humans is responsible for the current
COVID-19 pandemic. No in-depth information on structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2
proteins is currently available in the public domain, and no effective anti-viral drugs and/or
vaccines are designed for the treatment of this infection. Our study provides the first
comparative analysis of the order- and disorder-based features of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome
relative to human SARS and bat CoV that may be useful for structure-based drug discovery.

Introduction
Emerging Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent pandemic, which is recently
declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since its
first appearance in visitors of the Wuhan’s seafood and meat market, China, reported in
December 2019, COVID-19 has now large scale socio-economic impact [1]. According to the
WHO, till 2nd April 2020, the infection spread over at least 170 countries and territories,
where there were more than 0.93 million confirmed cases, with more than 47,000 patients
died due to COVID-19. One should also keep in mind that these data on the COVID-19
spread and related casualties are rapidly becoming outdated, almost with the speed of typing
of these sentences. Symptoms of COVID-19, which is a respiratory illness, include fever,
cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, as well as mild gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in
some patients, and, in more serious cases, the infection can cause severe pneumonia and even
death [2].
According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), SARS-CoV-2
comes under the coronavirinae sub-family of coronaviridae family of order nidovirales.
Viruses of the nidovirales order are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses [3]. The major variations among Nidovirus family occur in the
number, type, and sizes of the structural proteins [3]. The family coronaviridae comprises of
vertebrate infecting viruses that transmit horizontally mainly through oral/fecal route and
cause gastrointestinal and respiratory problems to the host [4]. Sub-family coronavirinae
consists of four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses based on the
phylogenetic clustering of viruses [5,6]. Coronavirinae having the largest genomes among
the RNA viruses, incorporate their ~30kb genomes inside the enveloped capsid. These
viruses have variations among genome due to significant differences in the structure and
morphology of their nucleocapsids [7].
SARS-Coronavirus genomic RNA includes a 5’ cap, leader sequence, UTR, a replicase gene,
genes for structural and accessory proteins, 3’ UTR, and a poly-A tail (Figure 1). Two-third
of genome codes for replicase gene (~20kb) containing genes for all non-structural viral
proteins, while the remaining part of the genome (~10kb) contains genes for accessory
proteins interspersed between the genes responsible for coding structural proteins [7]. For the
expression of structural and accessory proteins, additional transcriptional regulatory
sequences (TRS) are present within the viral genome. 5’ and 3’ UTRs contain stem-loop
regions required for viral RNA synthesis [8]. The ~20kb (replicase gene) ssRNA is translated
first into two long polyproteins: replicase polyprotein 1a and 1ab inside host cells. The newly
formed polyproteins, after cleavage by two viral proteases, result in 16 non-structural proteins
that perform a wide range of functions for viruses inside the host cell. They also induce ERderived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) for viral replication and transcription. Structural
proteins shape the outer cover of the virion, while accessory proteins are mostly involved in
host immune evasion [9,10].
In this study, we analyzed the dark side of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (i.e., a part of a
proteome that includes proteins or protein regions, which are not amenable to experimental
structure determination by existing means and inaccessible to homology modelling; i.e.,

intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs)),
in order to better understand an interplay between the ordered and disordered components of
the proteome. In classical structure-function-paradigm, it is believed that a unique, stable, and
well-defined 3-dimensional structure is a prerequisite for a protein to accomplish its unique
biological function. Although this notion dominated scientific minds for over the hundred
years, eventually an idea of the presence of functional intrinsic disorder in proteins came to
the attention of the structural biologists. According to this “heretic” viewpoint, a noticeable
amount of biologically active proteins (of protein regions) fail to fold into the well-defined
structures and instead remain disordered, existing as highly dynamic ensembles of rapidly
interconverting conformations under the physiological conditions. These proteins and protein
regions are known now as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered
protein regions (IDPRs), respectively. The propensity of being functional intrinsically
disordered proteins (similar to the propensity of forming unique biologically active structures
of ordered proteins) is determined by the amino acid sequences [11–13]. IDPs exhibit their
biological functions in numerous biological processes commonly associated with cellular
signalling, gene regulation, and control by interacting with their physiological partners [14–
18]. These functions of IDPs and IDPs are regulated by their protein-protein, protein-RNA,
protein-DNA interactions [19,20]. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are the regions in
IDPs implicated in regulation of IDPs function by protein-protein interactions and serve as
the primary stage in molecular recognition.

Figure 1. Genome architecture of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 contains a positive single-stranded
mRNA as genetic material. The 5’ capped mRNA has a leader sequence (LS), poly-A tail at 3’ end,
and 5’ and 3’ UTR. It contains the following genes: ORF1a, ORF1b, Spike (S), ORF3a, ORF3b,
Envelope (E), Membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF14, Nucleocapsid (N),
and ORF10.

Zhang and colleagues have reported the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with GenBank
accession number NC_045512 having 29,903 nucleotides. The virus was isolated from the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient, went through a circle or renaming, from novel
Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus to deadly Wuhan coronavirus, to the 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the Wuhan-2019 novel coronavirus (Wuhan-2019-nCoV, and
was eventually named SARS-CoV-2 by the WHO [21].
It is known that the IDPs/IDPRs are present in all three kingdoms of life, and viral proteins
often contain unstructured regions that have been strongly correlated with their virulence
[22–25]. In this report, we investigated the disordered side of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome

using a complementary set of computational approaches to check the prevalence of IDPRs in
various SARS-CoV-2 proteins and to shed some light on their disorder-related functions. We
also have comprehensively analyzed IDPRs among the closely related viruses, such as human
SARS CoV and bat SARS-like CoV. Furthermore, we have also identified protein functions
related to protein-protein interactions, RNA binding, and DNA binding from all three viruses.
Since these three viruses are closely related, our study provides important means for a better
understanding of the sequence and structural peculiarities of their evolution. We believe that
this study will help the structural and non-structural biologists to design and perform
experiments for a more in-depth understanding of this virus and its pathogenicity. This also
will have long-term implications for developing new drugs or vaccines against this currently
unpreventable infection.

Materials and Methods
Sequence retrieval and multiple sequence alignment. The protein sequences of Bat CoV
(SARS-like) and Human SARS CoV were retrieved from UniProt (UniProt IDs for individual
proteins are listed in Table 1). The translated sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins [GenBank
database [26] (Accession ID: NC_045512.2)] were obtained from GenBank. We used these
sequences for performing multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and predicting the IDPRs. We
have used Clustal Omega [27] for protein sequence alignment and Esprit 3.0 [28] for
constructing the aligned images.
Per-residue predictions of intrinsic disorder predisposition: For the prediction of the
intrinsic disorder predisposition of CoV proteomes, we have used multiple predictors, such as
members of the PONDR® (Predictor of Natural Disordered Regions) family including
PONDR®VLS2 [29], PONDR®VL3 [30], PONDR®FIT [31], and PONDR® VLXT [32], as
well as the IUPred platform for predicting long (≥30 residues) and short IDPRs (<30
residues) [33]. These computational tools predict residues/regions, which do not have the
tendency to form an ordered structure. Residues with disorder scores exceeding the threshold
value of 0.5 are considered as intrinsically disordered residues, whereas residues with the
predicted disorder scores between 0.2 and 0.5 are considered flexible. Complete predicted
percent of intrinsic disorder (PPID) in a query protein was calculated for every protein of all
the three viruses from outputs of six predictors. The detailed methodology has been given in
our previous reports [34,35].
Combined CH-CDF analysis to predict disorder predisposition of proteins: Charge
hydropathy plot [36] and PONDR® VLXT-based cumulative distribution function are two
binary predictors of disorder (i.e., tool evaluating entire protein as mostly ordered or mostly
disordered), which are available on the PONDR web server (https://www.pondr .com/).
Combining the result from these binary predictors helps one to classify the proteins into
different groups, depending on the flavours of their global disorder [37].
Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) determination in CoV proteomes: The authentic
online bioinformatics predictors that use a different set of algorithms for the prediction of
MoRFs were used: These include MoRFchibi_web [38], ANCHOR [39,40], MoRFPred [41],

and DISOPRED3 [42]. The protein residues with ANCHOR, MoRFPred, and DISOPRED3
score above the threshold value of 0.5 and MoRFchibi_web score above the threshold value
of 0.725 are considered MoRF regions.
Identification of DNA and RNA binding regions in CoV proteomes: Often IDPs and
IDPRs facilitate interactions with RNAs and DNAs and regulates many cellular functions
[43]. Thus, for predicting the DNA binding residues in CoV proteins, we have used two
online servers: DRNAPred [19] and DisoRDPbind [43]. For RNA binding residues, we used
Pprint (Prediction of Protein RNA- Interaction) [44] and DisoRDPbind [43].

Results and Discussion
Comprehensive computational analysis of the intrinsic disorder in proteins from SARSCoV-2, human SARS and bat CoV (SARS-like)
The mean values of the predicted percentage of intrinsic disorder scores (mean PPIDs), that
were obtained by averaging the predicted disorder scores from six disorder predictors
(Supplementary Table 1-3) for each protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as Human SARS, and
Bat CoV are represented in Table 1.

These sequences are based on genome annotations conducted by Wu et al. [45].

Proteins and their PPIDs are coloured to reflect their disorder status (ordered – blue, moderately disordered –
pink, highly disordered – red)

Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C are 2D-disorder plots generated for SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS
and Bat CoV proteins, respectively, and represent the PPIDPONDR-FIT vs. PPIDMean plots. Based
on their predicted levels of intrinsic disorder, proteins can be classified as highly ordered
(PPID < 10%), moderately disordered (10% ≤ PPID < 30%) and highly disordered (PPID ≥
30%) [46]. From the data in Table 1, Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C, as well as the PPID based
classification, we conclude that the Nucleocapsid protein from all three strains of coronavirus
possesses the highest percentage of the disorder and is classified as highly disordered protein.
ORF3b protein in Bat Cov, ORF6 protein in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV, and
ORF9b protein in Human SARS and SARS CoV belong to the class of moderately disordered
proteins. While the structured proteins, namely, Spike glycoprotein (S), an Envelope protein
(E) and Membrane protein (M) as well as accessory proteins ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 (ORF8a
and ORF8b in case of Human SARS) of all three strains of coronavirus are ordered proteins.
ORF14 and ORF10 proteins also belong to the class of ordered proteins.

Figure 2. Analysis of overall disorder status of proteins of SARS-CoV–2, Human SARS, and Bat
CoV (SARS-like): 2D plot representing PPIDPONDR-FIT vs. PPIDMean in (A) SARS-CoV-2 (B) Human
SARS and (C) Bat CoV. In CH-CDF plot of the proteins of (D) SARS-CoV-2 (E) Human SARS and
(F) Bat CoV, the Y coordinate of each protein spot signifies distance of corresponding protein from
the boundary in CH plot and the X coordinate value corresponds to the average distance of the CDF
curve for the respective protein from the CDF boundary.

In order to further investigate the nature of the disorder in proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human
SARS, and Bat CoV, we utilized the combined CH-CDF tool that uses the outputs of two
binary classifiers of disorder, Charge hydropathy (CH) plot and Cumulative distribution
function (CDF) plot. This helped in retrieving more detailed characterization of the global
disorder predisposition of the query proteins and their classification according to the disorder
“favours”. The CH plot is a linear classifier that differentiates between proteins that are
predisposed to possess extended disordered conformations that include random coils and premolten globules from proteins that have compact conformations (ordered proteins and molten
globule-like proteins). The other binary predictor, CDF is a nonlinear classifier that uses the
PONDR®VLXT scores to discriminate ordered globular proteins from all disordered
conformations, which include native molten globules, pre-molten globules, and random coils.
The CH-CDF plot can be divided into four quadrants: Q1 (bottom right quadrant) is an area
of CH-CDF phase space that is expected to include ordered proteins; Q2 (bottom left
quadrant) includes proteins predicted to be disordered by CDF and compact by CH (i.e.,
native molten globules and hybrid proteins containing high levels of both ordered and
disordered regions); Q3 (top left quadrant) contains proteins that are predicted to be
disordered by both CH and CDF analysis (i.e., highly disordered proteins with the extended
disorder); and Q4 (top right quadrant) possesses proteins disordered according to CH but
ordered according to CDF analysis [34]. Figures 2D, 2E and 2F represent the CH-CDF
analysis of proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV and show that all the
proteins are located within the two quadrants Q1 and Q2. The CH-CDF analysis leads to the
conclusion that all proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are ordered except

Nucleocapsid protein, which is predicted to be disordered by CDF but ordered by CH and
hence lies in Q2.
Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are short interaction-prone disordered regions found
within IDPs/IDPRs that commence a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to their
partners [47,48]. These regions are important for protein-protein interactions and may initiate
an early step in molecular recognition [48]. In this study, we have analyzed and compared
MoRFs (protein-binding regions) in SARS-CoV-2 with Human SARS and Bat CoV. The
results of this analysis are summarized in Table 2, which clearly shows that most of the
SARS-CoV-2 proteins contain at least one MoRF, indicating that disorder does play an
important role in the functionality of these viral proteins. All of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins
have been predicted to contain MoRFs except ORF7b and Nsp13 proteins for which none of
the predictors have located any MoRF. MoRFs in Human SARS and Bat CoV proteomes are
listed in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 proteome, Bat CoV
proteins ORF7b, and Nsp13 were not predicted to have any MoRF by any of the servers used.
In Human SARS proteome the proteins ORF7b, Nsp13, Nsp2, and Nsp15 proteins does not
show the presence of any MoRF. Interestingly, structural N protein from SARS-CoV-2,
Human SARS, and Bat CoV shows high number of short and long MoRF regions, signifying
its central role in virus pathogenesis.

Nucleotide-binding propensity in proteins of coronaviruses
In addition to protein-protein interactions/protein-binding functions, IDPs and IDRs also
mediates functions by facilitating their interactions with nucleotides such as DNA and RNA
[20,49]. Therefore, we have used a combination of two different online servers for locating
protein residues that are showing the propensity to bind with DNA as well as RNA.
Nucleotide-binding residues in proteins of three studied coronaviruses are listed in
Supplementary Table 9-11. These results mostly contain the residues in viral proteins that
suitably bind viral RNA and host DNA. Interestingly, all the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2,
Human SARS, and Bat CoV have shown the propensity to bind to nucleic acid (DNA/RNA).
In particular, structural (S, M, and N proteins) and non-structural (Nsp 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13,
14, 15, and 16) proteins of all three viruses displays large number RNA binding residues.
However, ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF10, and ORF14
shows less RNA binding and more DNA binding residues.

Intrinsic disorder analysis of structural proteins of Coronaviruses
Coronaviruses encode four structural proteins, namely, Spike (S), Envelope (E) glycoprotein,
Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins, which are translated from the last ~10kb
nucleotides and form the outer cover of the CoVs, encapsulating their single-stranded
genomic RNA.
Spike (S) glycoprotein. S protein is a large multifunctional protein forming the exterior of the
CoV particles [50,51]. It forms surface homotrimers and contains two distinct ectodomain
regions known as S1 and S2. In some CoVs, the S protein is actually cleaved into these
subunits, which are joined non-covalently, whereas an additional proteolytic cleavage within
the N-terminal part of the S2 subunit that takes place upon virus endocytosis generates spike
proteins S2’. Subunit S1 initiates viral infection by binding to the host cell receptors, S2 acts
as a class I viral fusion protein that mediates fusion of the virion and cellular membranes and

thereby promotes the viral entry into the host cells, whereas S2’ serves as a viral fusion
peptide [52,53]. Spike binds to the virion M protein through its C-terminal transmembrane
region [54]. Belonging to a class I viral fusion protein, S protein binds to specific surface
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cell plasma membrane through its
N-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) and mediates viral entry into host cells [55].
The S protein consists of an N-terminal signal peptide, a long extracellular domain, a singlepass transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain [56]. A 3.60 Å resolution
structure (PDB ID: 6ACC) of S protein from Human SARS complexed with its host binding
partner ACE2 has been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In this PDB
structure, few residues (1-17, 240-243, 661-673, 812-831 and 1120-1203) are missing [57],
suggesting their flexible nature. Also, the structure of the S protein (3.5 Å) from SARS-CoV2 has been recently deduced by Wrapp et. al. using electron microscopy (PDB ID: 6VSB)
[58] (Figure 3A). In this structure, residues 1-26, 67-78, 96-98, 143-155, 177-186, 247-260,
329-334, 444-448, 455-490, 501-502, 621-639, 673-686, 812-814, 829-851, 1147-1288 were
missing, suggesting that the corresponding regions of a protein are characterized by high
conformational flexibility. The biophysical analysis reported in previous study has also
revealed that the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity to ACE2 than S
protein from Human SARS [58].

which has been calculated by averaging the disorder scores from all six predictors is represented by a
short-dot line (sky-blue line) in the graph. The light sky-blue shadow region signifies the mean error
distribution. The residues missing in the PDB structure or the residues for which PDB structure is

disorder profiles generated for spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 (black line), Human SARS (red
line), and Bat CoV (green line) based on the outputs of the PONDR® VSL2.

MSA analysis among all three coronaviruses demonstrates that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has
a 77.71% sequence identity with Bat CoV and 77.14% identity with Human SARS
(Supplementary Figure S1A). All three S proteins are found to have a conserved C-terminal
region. However, the N-terminal regions of S proteins display noticeable differences. Given
that there is significant sequence variation RBD located at the N-terminal region of S protein,
this might be the reason behind variation in its virulence and its receptor-mediated binding
and entry into the host cell.
According to our intrinsic disorder propensity analysis, S protein from all three CoVs
analysed in this study are highly structured, as their predicted disorder propensity lies below
10% (Table 1). In fact, the mean PPID scores of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat
CoV are calculated to be 1.41%, 1.12%, and 1.85%, respectively. Figures 3B, 3C, and 3D
represent the intrinsic disorder profiles of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and
Bat CoV obtained from six disorder predictors. Finally, Figure 3E shows aligned disorder
profiles of S proteins from these CoVs and illustrates remarkable similarity in their disorder
propensity, especially in the C-terminal region.
It is of interest to map known functional regions of S proteins to their corresponding disorder
profiles. The maturation of S protein requires specific posttranslational modification (PTM),
proteolytic cleavage that happens at two stages. First, host cell furin or another cellular
protease nicks the S precursor to generate S1 and S2 proteins, whereas the second cleavage
that takes place after the viral attachment to host cell receptors leads to the release of a fusion
peptide generating the S2’ subunit. In Human SARS CoV, the first and second cleavage site
is located at residues R667 and R797, respectively, whereas in Bat CoV, the corresponding
cleavage sites are residues R654 and R784. As it follows from Figure 3, these cleavage sites are
located within the IDPRs. In Human SARS CoV S protein, fusion peptide (residues 770-788)
is located within a flexible region, is characterized by the mean disorder score of
0.232±0.053. Similarly, in Bat CoV S protein, fusion peptide (residues 757-775) has a mean
disorder score of 0.320±0.046. S protein contains two heptad repeat regions that form coiledcoil structure during viral and target cell membrane fusion, assuming a trimer-of-hairpins
structure needed for the functional positioning of the fusion peptide. In Human SARS CoV S
protein, heptad repeat regions are formed by residues 902-952 and 1145-1184, which have
mean disorder scores of 0.458±0.067 and 0.353±0.062, respectively. The analogous situation
is observed for the S protein from Bat CoV, where these heptad repeat regions are positioned
at residues 889-939 (0.44±0.11) and 1132-1171 (0.353±0.062). Another functional region
found in S proteins is the receptor-binding domain (residues 306-527 and 310-514 in Human
SARS CoV and Bat CoV, respectively) containing a receptor-binding motif responsible for
interaction with human ACE2. In human S protein of Human SARS CoV this motif (residues
424-494) is not only characterized by structural flexibility, possessing a mean disorder score

of 0.30±0.16, but also contains a disordered region (residues 461-466). Since S protein is
known as spike glycoprotein, it contains numerous glycosylation sites. Due to rather close
similarity of disorder profiles of S proteins analysed here, we can assume that all the
aforementioned indications of the functional importance of disorder and flexible regions in S
proteins from SARS CoV and Bat CoV are also applicable to SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
Finally, Table 2 shows that S protein from SARS-CoV-2 contain one MoRF region at its Cterminal (residues 1265-1272) by MoRFchibi_web, two MoRF regions ((residues 2-6) &
(residues 819-823)) by MoRFPred, and one MoRF region at N-terminal (residues 1-10) by
DISOPRED3. These results indicating that intrinsic disorder is important for its interaction
with binding partners. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of S protein (residues 1-10) from
all three viruses are observed to be a disorder-based protein binding region by two predictors
(MoRFPred and DISOPRED3). N-terminal MoRF displays its role in viral interaction with
host receptor and C-terminal MoRF displays its role in M protein interaction and viral
assembly. Moreover, MoRF region mainly lies in the N- and C-terminal regions suggesting a
possible role during cleavage as well. In addition to protein-binding regions, S protein also
shows many nucleotide-binding residues. Tables 9, 10, and 11 shows that numerous RNA
binding residues predicted by PPRint in all three viruses and a single RNA binding residue
were predicted by DisoRDPbind in human SARS. Further, DRNApred and DisoRDPbind
predicted the presence of many DNA binding residues in S protein of all three viruses. These
results signify the role of S protein functions related to molecular recognition (protein-protein
interaction, RNA binding, and DNA binding) such as interaction with host cell membrane
and further viral infection. Therefore, identified IDPs/IDPRs and residues/regions from S
protein crucial for molecular recognition can be targeted for disorder-based drug discovery.
Envelope (E) small membrane protein. Envelope (E) protein is a small, multifunctional inner
membrane protein that plays an important role in the assembly and morphogenesis of virions
in the cell [59–61]. E protein consists of two ectodomains associated with N- and C-terminal
regions, and a transmembrane domain. It homo-oligomerize to form pentameric membrane
destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpins to form a pore necessary for its ion channel
activity [62]. Figure 4A shows the NMR-structure (PDB ID: 2MM4) of Human SARS
envelope glycoprotein of 8-65 residues [63].

glycoprotein. (A) The solution NMR generated structure of envelope glycoprotein of Human SARS
(PDB ID: 2MM4). The structure is shown for the region consists of residues 8-65. (B) MSA profile of
envelope glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV. Red shaded sequences
represent identical regions of these proteins. (C-E) graph represents the intrinsic disorder profiles of E
protein from SARS-CoV-2 (C), Human SARS CoV (D), and Bat CoV (E). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3.

MSA results illustrate (Figure 4B) that this protein is highly conserved, with only three
amino acid substitutions in E protein of SARS-CoV-2 conferring its 96% sequence similarity
with Human SARS and Bat CoV. Bat CoV shares 100% sequence identity with Human
SARS. Mean PPID calculated for SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV E proteins are
5.33%, 6.58%, and 6.58% respectively (Table 1). The E protein is found to have a reasonably
well-predicted structure. Our predictions suggest that the residues of N- and C-terminals are
displaying a higher tendency for the disorder. The last 18 hydrophilic residues (residues 5976) have been reported to adopt a random-coil conformation with and without the addition of
lipid membranes [64]. Literature suggests that the last four amino acids of the C-terminal
region of E protein containing a PZD-binding motif are involved in protein-protein
interactions with a tight junction protein PALS1. Our results support literature as we
identified long N-terminal region of approximately 30 residues long as disorder-based protein
binding region in all three viruses (see Table 2, Supplementary Table 7 and 8). PALS1 is
involved in maintaining the polarity of epithelial cells in mammals [65]. Respective graphs in
Figures 4C, 4D, and 4E show the predicted intrinsic disorder profiles for E proteins of
SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. We speculate that the disordered region content
may be facilitating the interactions with other proteins as well. In agreement with this
hypothesis, Table 2 shows that in E protein from SARS-CoV-2, the C-terminal domain

serves as protein-binding region. We found that the residues from 45-75 is a long MoRF in E
proteins of all three viruses as predicted by MoRFchibi_web (Table 2, Supplementary
Table 7 and 8). As aforementioned, these randomly-coiled binding-residues at C-terminus
may gain structure while assisting the protein-protein interaction mediated by E protein. One
more MoRF region (residues 26-30) in the transmembrane domain was observed by
DISOPRED3 in the E protein of all three viruses. Since these residues are the part of ion
channel, we speculate that these residues do specific interactions and may be guiding the
specifi functions of ion channel activity.
Few RNA binding residues by PPRint and DisoRDPbind and several DNA binding residues
by DRNApred are predicted for E protein in all three viruses.
Membrane (M) glycoprotein. Membrane (M) glycoprotein plays an important role in virion
assembly by interacting with the nucleocapsid (N) and E proteins [66–68]. Protein M
interacts specifically with a short viral packaging signal containing coronavirus RNA in the
absence of N protein, thereby highlighting an important nucleocapsid-independent viral RNA
packaging mechanism inside the host cells [69]. It gains high-mannose N-glycans in ER,
which are subsequently modified into complex N-glycans in the Golgi complex.
Glycosylation of M protein is observed to be not essential for virion fusion in cell culture
[70,71].
Cryo-EM and Tomography data indicate that M forms two distinct conformations, a compact
M protein having high flexibility and low spike density, and an elongated M protein having a
rigid structure and narrow range of membrane curvature [72]. Some regions of M
glycoproteins might serve as important dominant immunogens. Although no structural
information is available for the full-length M protein as of yet, a short peptide of the
membrane glycoprotein (residues 88-96) from Human SARS CoV was co-crystallized with a
complex between A-2 alpha chain of the HLA class I histocompatibility antigen and β2microglobulin (PDB ID: 3I6G) [73]. Figure 5A shows that within this complex, the cocrystallized M protein region exists in an extended conformation.

dimer. Therefore, each member is present here in two copies. Chains corresponding to the fragment of
the membrane glycoprotein (residues 88-96) are shown by red and pink colours, A-2 alpha chain and
β2-microglobulin in this dimer of heterotrimers structure are shown as blue/ice-blue and tan/yellow
surfaces. (B) MSA profile of Membrane glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV

represent the intrinsic disorder profiles of M protein from SARS-CoV-2, (D) Human SARS CoV, and
(E) Bat CoV. The colour schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3.

M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a sequence similarity of 90.1% with Bat CoV and 89.6% with
Human SARS M proteins (Figure 5B). Our analysis revealed that the intrinsic disorder levels
in M proteins of SARS-COV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are relatively low since
these proteins show the PPID values of 2.70%, 1.36%, and 1.36% respectively. This is in line
with the previous publication by Goh et al. on Human SARS HKU4 where they found the
mean PPID of 4% using additional predictors such as TopIDP and FoldIndex along with the
predictors used in our study [74]. Figures 5C, 5D, and 5E represent per-residue disorder
profiles generated for M proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV and
show that with the exception to their N- and C-terminal regions, these proteins are mostly
ordered. The last 20 residues of MERS-CoV M protein are important for intracellular
trafficking and contains a determinant that localizes it into the Golgi network [75]. Our
results in Table 2 illustrates that the disordered C-tail of the M protein is predicted to have
disorder based protein-binding region and therefore can serve as a binding site for its specific
partner required for its localization inside the host cell. A long MoRF region (residues 186220) at the C-terminal of M protein in all three viruses were observed by MoRFchibi_web.
Two MoRF regions (one at N-terminus (residues 1-16) and one at C-terminus (residues 205-

221)) was observed by DISOPRED3 in human SARS and Bat CoV. However, single MoRF
(residues 117-132) observed in SARS-CoV-2 by DISOPRED3. MoRFPred also predicts a
short MoRF at C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 (residues 214-222), Human SARS (residues 214221), and Bat CoV (residues 211-221) (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).
Furthermore, the M protein from all three viruses displays strong tendency to bind with RNA
(as predicted by PPRint and DisoRDPbind) and DNA (as predicted by DRNApred and
DisoRDPbind) (see Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11). Our understanding on M protein
of CoVs (IDPs and MoRF at C-terminus and molecular recognition) elucidates its crucial role
in interaction with the N and E proteins for viral assembly.
Nucleocapsid (N) protein: Nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the major viral proteins
playing several significant roles in transcription, and virion assembly of coronaviruses [76]. It
binds to viral genomic RNA forming a ribonucleoprotein core required for the RNA
encapsidation during viral particle assembly [77]. SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs)
formation has been reported to depend upon either M and E proteins or M and N proteins. For
the effective production and release of VLPs, co-expression of E or N proteins with M
protein is necessary [78].
N protein of Human SARS consists of two structural domains, the N-terminal RNA-binding
domain (NTD: 45-181 residues) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD: 248-365
residues) with a disordered patch in between these domains. N protein has been demonstrated
to bind viral RNA using both NTD and CTD [79]. Figure 6A1 displays the NMR solution
structure of the NTD of Human SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein (45-181 residues) (PDB ID:
1SSK) [80]. Figure 6A2 shows an X-ray crystal structure of the CTD of Human SARS CoV
nucleocapsid protein (270-366 residues) (PDB ID: 2GIB) [81]. A model of the domain
organization of the N-protein from SARS-CoV-2 is shown in Figure 6B.

The 419 amino acid-long N protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows a percentage identity of 88.76%
with N protein of Bat CoV N protein and 89.74% with Human SARS N protein
(Supplementary Figure S1B). Our analysis revealed that the N proteins of coronaviruses
contain the highest levels of intrinsic disorder (see Figure 6 and Table 1). In fact, N proteins
from SARS-COV-2 Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are characterized by the mean PPID of
64.91%, 71.09%, and 65.80%, respectively. In accordance with the previously evaluated

intrinsic disorder predisposition [74], N protein is highly disordered in all three SARS viruses
analysed in this study (Table 1). Graphs in Figures 6C, 6D, and 6E depict the disorder
profiles of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV nucleocapsid proteins and show
that their N- and C-terminal regions are completely disordered, and all three proteins also
contain the central unstructured segment. As expected, the intrinsic disorder predisposition of
the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to that for the N protein of Human
SARS CoV as reported in a previous study [74]. This is further supported by Figure 6F,
where PONDR® VSL2-generated disorder profiles of these three proteins are overlapped to
show almost complete coincidence of their major disorder-related features. It is clear that in
N-proteins, the N- and C-termini and a log central segment are completely disordered. Figure
6C shows that in the N protein from SARS-CoV-2, residues 1-57, 64-102, 145-162, 166-289,
and 362-422 are found to be disordered. Many of these residues are lying within the NTD and
CTD regions, and which, due to their structural plasticity, were not crystallized in Human
SARS CoV N protein. SARS-CoV-2 has a disordered segment from 168-289 residues while
Human SARS has predicted to have an unstructured segment from 145-289 residues. Overall,
all three N proteins are found to be highly disordered.
The N protein from Human SARS CoV has one phosphorylation site (residue S177) and
several regions with compositional biases, such as Ser-rich (residues 181-213), Poly-Leu,
Poly-Gln, and Ploy-Lys (residues 220-225, 240-245, and 370-376), all predicted to be
disordered. Similarly, in N protein from Bat CoV, S176 is phosphorylated, and this protein
has Ser-rich, Poly-Leu, and Ploy-Lys regions (residues 176-206, 219-224, and 369-375,
respectively), all of which are disordered. It has been reported to interact using the central
disordered region with M protein, hnRNP A1, and self N-N interaction [82–84]. The middle
flexible region is also responsible for its RNA-binding activity [85]. Deletion of 184-196
residues, 169-308 residues, 161-210 residues of N abolishes its multimerization, RNAbinding capacity, and hnRNP A1 interactions respectively. Supplementary Table 7 and 8,
and Table 2 shows that N protein is heavily decorated with numerous MoRFs, suggesting
that this protein is a promiscuous binder. Long disorder-based protein bonding regions at Nand C- terminus of N protein of all three viruses were observed by all four predictors
(MoRFchibi_web, ANCHOR, MoRFPred, and DISOPRED3). Indeed, this is the single
protein where we found many MoRFs as compared with the other structural, non-structural
and accessory proteins of CoVs. The MoRFs present in these regions may mediate the abovementioned interactions of N proteins. Figure 6A2 represents another important disorderrelated functional feature of the N protein. In fact, the CTD homodimer shown there is
characterized by highly intertwined morphology, which is typically a result of bindinginduced folding [86–88], indicating that a very significant part of CTD gains structure during
dimerization. We identified numerous RNA binding residues in all three viruses using PPRint
server. This finding supports the function of N protein as it interacts with genomic RNA for a
ribonucleoprotein core formation which is crucial step for RNA encapsidation during viral
particle assembly. In addition, DRNApred and DisoRDPbind predicts multiple DNA binding
residues for N protein in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. The long flexible
(IDPRs) regions at N and C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 have long protein-binding as well as
nucleotide-binding regions that may have important role in its interaction with viral RNA.

These flexible regions can be targeted to inhibit interaction of N protein with viral genomic
RNA.

Intrinsic disorder analysis of accessory proteins of Coronaviruses
Literature suggests that some viral proteins are translated from the genes interspersed in
between the genes of structural proteins. These proteins are known as accessory proteins, and
many of them are proposed to be involved in viral pathogenesis [89].
Proteins ORF3a and ORF3b. ORF3a is a multifunctional protein with the molecular weight
of ~31 kDa that has been found to localize in different organelles inside the host cells. Also
referred to as U274, X1, and ORF3, the gene for this protein is present between the S and E
genes of the SARS-CoV genome [90–92]. The homo-tetrameric complex of ORF3a has been
demonstrated to form a potassium-ion channel on the host cell plasma membrane [93]. It
performs a major function during virion assembly by co-localizing with E, M, and S viral
proteins [94,95]. ORF3b protein can be found in the cytoplasm, nucleolus, and outer
membrane of mitochondria of the host cells [96,97]. In Huh 7 cells, its over-expression has
been linked with the activation of AP-1 via ERK and JNK pathways [98]. Transfection of
ORF3b-EGFP leads to cell growth arrest at the G0/G1 phase of Vero, 293, and COS-7 cells
[99]. ORF3a induces apoptosis via caspase 8/9 directed mitochondrial-mediated pathways,
while ORF3b is reported to affect only the caspase 3-related pathways [100,101].

Figure 7. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of ORF3a protein. (A-C) graphs represent the
intrinsic disorder profiles of ORF3a protein from (A) SARS-CoV-2, (B) Human SARS CoV, and (C)
Bat CoV. The colour schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) MSA
profile of ORF3a proteins from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV. Red shaded
sequences represent identical regions of these proteins, whereas red characters show similar residues.

On performing MSA, results of which are shown in Figure 7D, we found that ORF3a protein
from SARS-COV-2 is slightly evolutionary closer to the ORF3a of Bat CoV (73.36%) than to
the ORF3a of Human SARS CoV (72.99%). Graphs in Figures 7A, 7B, and 7C depict the
propensity for disorder in ORF3a proteins of novel SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and
Bat CoV (SARS-like), respectively. Mean PPIDs in these ORF3a proteins are 9.1% (SARSCoV-2), 8.8% (Human SARS), and 6.2% (Bat CoV (SARS-like)). ORF3a of SARS CoV-2
shows protein-binding regions at its N-terminus (by MoRFchibi_web (residues 1-6),
MoRFPred (residues 7-12), and DISOPRED3 (residues 1-19)) and at C-terminus (by
MoRFchibi_web (residues 261-268) and MoRFPred (residues 259-263)) (Table 2).
Similarly, ORF3a of Human SARS and Bat CoV also shows MoRFs at N- and C-terminus
with the help of MoRFchibi_web and MoRFPred (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). These
protein-binding regions in ORF3a may have role in its co-localization with E, M, and S viral
proteins. Apart from MoRFs, it also displays several nucleotide-binding residues in all three
viruses (see Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11). In fact, this represents maximum number
of RNA and DNA binding residues as compared with all other accessory proteins. These
results indicate that the IDPs/IDPRs of this protein could be utilized in molecular recognition
(protein-protein, protein-RNA, and protein-DNA interaction).
According to the intrinsic disorder predisposition analysis of ORF3b proteins, their mean
PPID values in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are 0%, 7.1%, and 23.1%
respectively, as represented in Figures 8A, 8B, and 8C. MSA results (Figure 8D)
demonstrate that ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 is not closer to ORF3b protein of Human SARS
and ORF3b protein of Bat-CoV, having a sequence similarity of only 54.6% and 59.1%,
respectively. As we can see in Table 2, there is not a single MoRF found in ORF3b of
SARS-CoV-2. However, for Human SARS we identified three MoRFs (residues 32-37, 4170, and 125-153) and for Bat CoV one MoRF at N-terminus (residues 1-38) by
MoRFchibi_web server.

Protein ORF6. ORF6 is a short coronavirus protein with just 63 residues. Also known as P6,
this membrane-associated protein serves as an interferon (IFN) antagonist [102]. It
downregulates the IFN pathway by blocking a nuclear import protein, karyopherin α2. Using
its C-terminal residues, ORF6 disrupts karyopherin import complex in the cytosol and,
therefore, hampers the movement of transcription factors like STAT1 into the nucleus
[102,103]. It contains a YSEL motif near its C-terminal region, which functions in protein
internalization from the plasma membrane into the endosomal vesicles [104]. Another study
has also demonstrated the presence of ORF6 in endosomal/lysosomal compartments
[104,105].
MSA results demonstrate that (Figure 9D), SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is closer to ORF6 protein of
Human SARS CoV, having a sequence similarity of 68.85% than to the ORF6 of Bat CoV
(SARS-like) (67.21%). Novel SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is predicted to be the second most
disordered structural protein, with PPID of 22.95%, and with especially disordered Cterminal region.

Figure 9. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of ORF6 protein. Graphs represent the intrinsic
disorder analysis of ORF6 proteins from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS (B), and Bat CoV (C). The
colour schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) MSA profile of ORF6 of
SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV. Red shaded sequences represent identical regions of
these proteins, whereas red characters show similar residues.

Our analysis of the intrinsic disorder predisposition using six predictors revealed the mean
PPID in ORF6 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV to be 22.95%, 20.63%,
and 20.63%, respectively (Table 1). Graphs in Figures 9A, 9B and 9C illustrate that ORF6
proteins from all three studied coronaviruses are expected to be moderately disordered
proteins with the high disorder content in their C-terminal regions. These disordered regions
are important for the biological activities of ORF6. As aforementioned, this hydrophilic
region contains lysosomal targeting motif (YSEL) and diacidic motif (DDEE) responsible for
binding and recognition during translocation [104]. However, the N-terminal region does not
contain a noticeable disorder. The 1-38 residues of the N-terminal region of Human SARS
CoV ORF6 was shown to be α-helical and embedded in the membrane, although ORF6 is not
a transmembrane protein [106]. A long MoRF region ((residues 26-61 in SARS-CoV-2),
(residues 31-63 in Human SARS), and (residues 30-60 in Bat Cov)) is also present at Cterminus of ORF6 proteins which are tabulated in Table 2, and Supplementary Tables 7 and
8. No predictor other than MoRFchibi_web has located MoRFs in this protein.
Supplementary Table 9, 10, and 11 shows nucleotide-binding residues in ORF6 of all three
viruses. It represents very few RNA binding residues by PPRint and few DNA binding
residues by DRNApred.
ORF7a and ORF7b proteins. Alternatively called U122, ORF7a is a type I transmembrane
protein [107,108]. It has been proven to localize in ER, Golgi, and peri-nuclear space. The
presence of a KRKTE motif near the C-terminal region is needed for importing this protein
from the ER to the Golgi apparatus [107,108]. ORF7a contributes to viral pathogenesis by
activating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-8 and

RANTES [109,110]. In another study, overexpression of BCL-XL in 293T cells blocked the
ORF7a mediated apoptosis [111]. On the other hand, ORF7b is an integral membrane protein
that has been shown to localize in the Golgi complex [112,113]. The same reports also
confirm the role of ORF7b as an accessory as well as a structural protein in SARS-CoV
virion [112,113].
Figure 10D represents the 1.8 Å X-ray crystal structure of the 14-96 fragment of the ORF7a
from Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 1XAK) and demonstrates the compact seven-stranded 𝛽
topology of this protein, which is similar to that of the Ig-superfamily members [114].
Importantly, in this crystal structure, residues 82-96 constituted the region with missing
electron density, indicating high structural flexibility of this segment. In line with this
hypothesis, the NMR solution structure of the 16-99 fragment of the ORF7a from Human
SARS CoV (PDB ID: 1YO4) showed that residues 81-99 are highly disordered [115]. At the
domain level, the structure of the ORF7a protein includes a signal peptide, a luminal domain,
a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail at the C-terminus [95,114].

Figure 10. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of ORF7a protein. The graphs represent the
results of the intrinsic disorder analysis of ORF7a protein from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS (B),

We found that 121-residue-long ORF7a protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 89.26% and 85.95%
sequence identity with ORF7a proteins of Bat CoV and Human SARS CoV, respectively
(Figure 10E). On the other hand, the ORF7b of SARS-CoV-2 is found to be closer to ORF7b

of Human SARS than to ORF7b of Bat CoV, showing sequence identities of 81.40% and
79.07%, respectively (see Figure 11D).

Figure 11. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of ORF7b protein. The graphs represent the
results of the intrinsic disorder analysis of the ORF7b protein from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS
CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure
3. (D) MSA profile of ORF7b from SARS CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV. Red shaded
sequences represent identical regions of these proteins, whereas red characters show similar residues.

As can be observed from Table 1, our disorder predisposition analyses resulted in the overall
PPID for ORF7a proteins of 1.65% for SARS-CoV-2, 0.82% for Bat CoV and 0.82% for
Human SARS CoV. Mean PPIDs estimated for ORF7b proteins are 9.30% for SARS-CoV-2,
4.55% for Bat CoV and 4.55% Human SARS CoV. Figures 10A, 10B, and 10C represent the
residues predisposed for disorder in ORF7a proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV,
and Bat CoV, respectively. Table 2 shows that ORF7a protein is expected to have several
MoRFs indicating the potential involvement of this protein in disorder-dependent proteinprotein interactions. At the N-terminus, we observed one MoRF region (residues 1-10) with
the help of DISOPRED3 in all three viruses. In addition to protein binding regions, ORF7a
also contains several RNA and DNA binding residues. Analysis also represents, ORF7b
proteins from all three viruses have low disorder content, likewise, they are not predicted to
contain any MoRF by any of the predictors used in this study (Table 2, Supplementary
Table 7 and 8). Although the ORF7b does not contain protein-binding regions, it was found
to contain nucleotide (RNS and DNA) binding regions in the protein Figures 11A, 11B, and
11C depict the residues predisposed for disorder in ORF7b proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human
SARS CoV, and Bat CoV, respectively. According to our analysis, both proteins in all three
studied coronaviruses have a mostly ordered structure.
Proteins ORF8a and ORF8b. In animals and isolates from early human infections, the ORF8
gene codes for a single ORF8 protein. However, in late infections, more specifically, at
middle and late stages, a 29 nucleotide deletion in the ORF8 gene led to the formation of two
distinct proteins, ORF8a and ORF8b containing 39 and 84 residues respectively [116,117].

Both proteins have conformations different from that of the longer ORF8 protein. It has been
reported that overexpression of ORF8b resulted in the downregulation of E protein while the
proteins ORF8a and ORF8/ORF8ab have no effect on the expression of protein E. Also,
ORF8/ORF8ab was found to interact very strongly with proteins S, ORF3a, and ORF7a.
ORF8a interacts with S and E proteins, whereas ORF8b protein interacts with E, M, ORF3a
and ORF7a proteins [118]. The disorder-based protein binding regions of this protein
identified in this study may have important role in interaction with other proteins.

Human SARS CoV. (A) The graph represents the disorder profile generated for ORF8a protein from
Human SARS CoV. (B) The graph shows the disorder profile generated for ORF8b protein from

ORF8 protein found in early SARS-CoV-2 isolates having 121 residues and according to our
analysis, it shares a 90.05% sequence identity with ORF8 protein of Bat CoV (Figure 12C).
Furthermore, Figures 12A and 12B show that there is no intrinsic disorder in both ORF8
proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and Bat CoV. Therefore, these two proteins predicted to be
completely structured having a mean PPID of 0.00%. In ORF8a and ORF8b proteins of the
Human SARS, the predicted disorder is estimated to be 2.56% and 2.38%, respectively
(Table 1). Graphs in Figures 13A and 13B illustrate the presence of some disorder near the
N- and C-terminals of ORF8a and ORF8b proteins. Table 2 shows the identified MoRF
regions in ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2. It shows three MoRF regions (residues 1-5, 26-52, and 6991) by MoRFchibi_web and one MoRF region (residues 1-10) by DISOPRED3. In Human
SARS, the N-terminus of both ORF8a (residues 1-39) and ORF8b (residues 1-83) was found
to be MoRF by MoRFchibi_web server (Supplementary Table 7). Further, four proteinbinding regions (residues 26-53, 70-91, 98-104, and 113-130) were identified by
MoRFchibi_web server in Bat CoV (Supplementary Table 8). Apart from protein-binding,
ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2, ORF8a and ORF8b of Human SARS, and ORF8 of Bat CoV also
comprise several nucleotide-binding residues (see Supplementary Table 9, 10, and 11).
ORF9b protein. This protein is expressed from an alternative ORF within the N gene through
a leaky ribosome binding process [119]. Inside the host cells, ORF9b enters the nucleus,
which is a cell cycle-independent process and represents a passive entry. This protein was
shown to interact with a nuclear export protein receptor Exportin 1 (Crm1), using which it
translocate out of the nucleus [120]. Our MoRFs analysis shows the presence of disorderbased protein binding regions in ORF9b protein which may have role in its interaction with
Crm1 and further translocation outside the nucleus. A 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of
ORF9b protein from Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 2CME) shows the presence of a dimeric
tent-like 𝛽-structure along with the central hydrophobic amino acids (Figure 14D). The

published structure has the highly polarized distribution of charges, with positively charged
residues on the one side of the tent and negatively charged on the other [121].

Figure 14. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of ORF9b protein. The graphs represent
results of the intrinsic disorder analysis of the ORF9b of SARS-CoV-2 (A) and Human SARS CoV
(B), as well as Bat CoV of ORF9 protein (C). The colour schemes are the same as in the
corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 2.8 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of ORF9b protein
from Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 2CME). This asymmetric unit includes four ORF9b homodimers
and consists of A, B, E, and G chains of 9-98 residues (purple colour) and C, D, F, and H chains of
10-98 residues (purple colour). (E) MSA of ORF9b of Human SARS CoV and ORF9 of Bat CoV.
Red shaded sequences represent identical regions of these proteins, whereas red characters show
similar residues.

Based on the sequence availability of accession ID NC_045512.2, the translated protein
sequence of ORF9b is not reported for the SARS-CoV-2 as of yet. However, based on the
report by Wu and colleagues [45], the sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 are already annotated.
Therefore, we took the corresponding amino acid sequences from that study and conducted
the intrinsic disorder analysis. According to the MSA, results shown in Figure 14E, ORF9b
protein from SARS-CoV-2 shares 73.2% identity with Human SARS and 74.23% identity
with Bat CoV.
Our IDP analysis (Table 1) shows that ORF9b from Human SARS is a moderately
unstructured protein with a mean PPID estimated to 26.53%. As depicted in Figure 14A,
14B, and 14C, disorder mainly lies near the N-terminal end 1-10 residues and 28-40 residues
near the central region with a well-ordered inner core of Human SARS ORF9b protein. The
x-ray crystal structure of ORF9b has a missing electron density of the first 8 residues and 2637 residues near the central region. This indicates that the corresponding regions are
disordered, which are difficult to crystallize due to their highly dynamic structural
organization. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein with a mean PPID of 10.31% has an N-terminal
(1-10 residues) predicted disordered segment. ORF9b of Bat CoV is shown to have an

intrinsic disorder content of 9.28%, comparatively lower than that of the Human SARS
ORF9b protein. MoRFs lies in the N-terminal region of ORF9b proteins (Table 2,
Supplementary Table 7 and 8). In the absence of other viral proteins, its first 41 residues
have been demonstrated to induce membranous structures similar to DMVs [106]. The
available crystal structure also has the missing electron density in the N-terminal region
suggests that these flexible amino acids are likely to interact with host lipids. The first 3-29
residues of SARS-CoV2 are identified as disorder-based protein binding region that may
have role in its interaction with host lipids and formation of DMVs. Supplementary Tables
9, 10, and 11 represents nucleotide-binding residues for ORF9b of SARS-CoV-2, Human
SARS, and Bat CoV.
ORF10 protein. The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 has an ORF10 protein of 38 amino acids.
ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2 has a 100% sequence similarity with ORF10 of Bat CoV strain BatSL-CoVZC45 [21]. However, we did not conduct the disorder analysis for ORF10 from the
Bat-SL-CoVZC45 strain, since all our studies reported here are related to a different strain of
Bat CoV (reviewed strain HKU3-1). Therefore, we report here only the results of disorder
analysis for the ORF10 protein from SARS-CoV-2, according to which this protein has a
mean PPID of 0.00% (see also Figure 15 for disorder profile of ORF10). This protein
contains a MoRF from 3-7 residues at its N-terminus as predicted by MoRFchibi_web.
Further, we found its tendency to nucleotides and found the presence of few RNA binding
sites, however, it does not contain DNA binding residues.

colour schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3.

Protein ORF14. This is a 70-amino-acid-long uncharacterized protein of unknown function,
which is present in Human SARS and Bat CoV. In SARS-CoV-2, ORF14 is a 73-amino-acidlong protein. According to the MSA, ORF14 of SARS-CoV-2 has 77.1% identity with
Human-SARS and 72.9% identity with Bat CoV as represented in Figure 16D. We have
performed the intrinsic disorder analysis to see the peculiarities of the distribution of disorder
predisposition in this protein. Figures 16A, 16B, and 16C show the resulting disorder

profiles of ORF14 of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV. Although these
proteins have calculated mean PPID values of 0.00%, 2.86%, and 0.00% respectively, Figure
16 shows that they have flexible N- and C-terminal regions. This protein can use intrinsic
disorder or structural flexibility for protein-protein interactions since it possesses MoRFs. It
mainly contains MoRFs at N- and C-terminal regions as tabulated in (Table 2,
Supplementary Table 7 and 8). It was also found to contain several RNA and DNA binding
residues (Supplementary Table 9, 10, and 11). These results indicating its vital role in
protein function related to molecular recognition such as protein-protein, protein-RNA, and
Protein-DNA interaction.

Intrinsic disorder analysis of non-structural proteins of Coronaviruses
In coronaviruses, due to ribosomal leakage during translation, two-third of the RNA genome
is processed into two polyproteins: (i) Replicase polyprotein 1a and (ii) Replicase polyprotein
1ab. Both contain non-structural proteins (Nsp1-10) in addition to different proteins required
for viral replication and pathogenesis. Replicase polyprotein 1a contains an additional Nsp11
protein of 13 amino acids, the function of which is not investigated yet. The longer replicase
polyprotein 1ab of 7073 amino acids accommodates five other non-structural proteins
(Nsp12-16) [122]. These proteins assist in ER membrane-induced vesicle formation, which
acts as sites for replication and transcription. In addition to this, non-structural proteins work
as proteases, helicases, and mRNA capping and methylation enzymes, crucial for virus
survival and replication inside host cells [122,123].

Global analysis of intrinsic disorder in the replicase polyprotein 1ab

Table 3 represents the PPID mean scores of 15 non-structural proteins (Nsps) derived from
the Replicase polyprotein 1ab in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV. These
values were obtained by combining the results from six disorder predictors (see
Supplementary Table S4-S6). Figures 17A, 17B, and 17C represent the 2D-disorder plots
of the Nsps coded by ORF1ab in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS Cov, and Bat CoV,
respectively. Based on the mean PPID scores in Table 3, Figures 17A, 17B, 17C, and taking
into PPID based classification [46], we conclude that none of the Nsps in SARS-CoV-2,
Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are highly disordered. The highest disorder was observed
for Nsp8 proteins in all three Coronaviruses. Both Nsp1 and Nsp8 are moderately disordered
proteins (10% ≤ PPID ≤ 30%). We also observed that Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp9,
Nsp10, Nsp15, and Nsp16 have less than 10% disordered residues and hence, belong to the
category of mostly ordered proteins. Other non-structural proteins, namely, Nsp4, Nsp12,
Nsp13, and Nsp14 have negligible levels of disorder (PPID < 1%), which tells us that these
are highly structured proteins.

Figure 17. Analysis of the overall intrinsic disorder status of non-structural proteins (Nsps)
coded by ORF1ab in SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV: 2D plot representing
PPIDPONDR-FIT vs PPIDMean in (A) SARS-CoV-2 (B) Human SARS and (C) Bat CoV (SARS-like). In
CH-CDF plot of the proteins of (D) SARS-CoV-2 (E) Human SARS and (F) Bat CoV, the Y
coordinate of each protein spot signifies distance of corresponding protein from the boundary in CH
plot and the X coordinate value corresponds to the average distance of the CDF curve for the
respective protein from the CDF boundary.

The CH-CDF analysis of the Nsps from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV have
been represented in Figures 17D, 17E, and 17F respectively. It was observed that all the
Nsps of the three coronaviruses are located within the quadrant Q1 of the CH-CDF phase
space, indicating that all the Nsps are predicted to be mostly ordered.
Replicase polyprotein 1ab. The longer replicase polyprotein 1ab is a 7,073 amino acid-long
polypeptide, which contains 15 non-structural proteins listed in Table 3. Nsp1, Nsp2, and
Nsp3 are cleaved using a viral papain-like proteinase (Nsp3/PL-Pro), while the rest of Nsps
are cleaved by another viral 3C-like proteinase, Nsp5/3CL-Pro. We mapped the cleavage
sites of the replicase 1ab polyprotein from Human SARS CoV to the disorder profile of this
polyprotein. Figure 18 represents the results of this analysis by showing zoomed-in regions
surrounding all the cleavage sites with few residues spanning at both terminals. Interestingly,
we observed that all the cleavage sites are largely disordered, suggesting that intrinsic
disorder may have a crucial role in the maturation of individual non-structural proteins. As
the Nsps of Human SARS CoV are evolutionary close to the Nsps of SARS-CoV-2, we
hypothesize that the cleavage sites in the SARS-CoV-2 replicase 1ab polyprotein are also
intrinsically disordered or flexible. To shed more light on other implications of IDPRs, the
structural and functional properties of Nsps and their predicted IDPRs are thoroughly
described below.

SARS CoV. Plots A to N denotes the cleavage sites (magenta coloured bar for PL-Pro protease and
grey coloured bar for 3CL-Pro protease) in relation to disordered regions present between the
individual proteins (Nsp1-16) of replicase 1ab polyprotein of Human SARS. All proteins are
represented by different coloured horizontal bars.

Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). This protein acts as a host translation inhibitor as it binds to
the 40S subunit of the ribosome and blocks the translation of cap-dependent mRNAs as well
as mRNAs that uses the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [124]. Figure 19D shows the
NMR solution structure (PDB ID: 2GDT) of Human SARS nsp1 protein (13-128 residues),
whereas residues 117-180 were not included in this structural analysis [125].

Figure 19. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity and structural characterization of Nsp1.
Intrinsic disorder profiles generated for Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and
Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) NMR
solution structure of a 13-128 fragment of Human SARS Nsp1 (PDB ID: 2GDT). (E) MSA profile of
Nsp1 from SARS CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV. Red shaded sequences represent
identical regions of these proteins, whereas red characters show similar residues.

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 shares 84.44% and 83.80% sequence identity with Nsp1s of Human
SARS CoV and Bat CoV, respectively. Its N-terminal region is found to be more conserved
than the rest of the protein sequence (Figure 19E). Mean PPIDs of Nsp1s from SARS-CoV2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are 12.78%, 14.44%, and 12.85%, respectively. Figure
19A, 19B, and 19C represent the graphs of predicted per-residue intrinsic disorder propensity
of these Nsp1s. According to the analysis, the following regions are predicted to be
disordered: SARS-CoV-2 (residues 1-7 and 165-180), Human SARS CoV (residues 1-5 and
165-180), and Bat CoV (residues 1-5 and 165-179). NMR solution structure of Nsp1 from
Human SARS revealed the presence of two unstructured segments near the N-terminal (1-12
residues) and C-terminal (129-179 residues) regions [125]. The disordered region (128–180
residues) at C-terminus is important for Nsp1 expression [126]. Based on sequence homology
with Human SARS CoV Nsp1, the predicted disordered C-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2
Nsp1 may play a critical role in its expression. Alanine mutants at K164 and H165 in the Cterminal region of Nsp1 protein is reported to abolish its binding with the 40S subunit of the
host ribosome [127]. In conjunction with this data, several MoRFs are present in the
unstructured segments of Nsp1 proteins. These regions are tabulated in Table 2, and
Supplementary Tables 7 and 8.

Non-structural protein 2 (Nsp2). This protein functions by disrupting the host survival
pathway via interaction with the host proteins Prohibitin-1 and Prohibitin-2 [128]. Reverse
genetic deletion in the coding sequence of Nsp2 of the SARS virus attenuated little viral
growth and replication and allowed the recovery of mutant virulent viruses. This indicates the
dispensable nature of the Nsp2 protein for SARS viruses [129].

Figure 20. Analysis of the intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp2. Intrinsic disorder profiles
generated for Nsp2 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour
schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3.

The sequence identity of the Nsp2 protein from SARS-CoV-2 with Nsp2s of Human SARS
CoV and Bat CoV amounts to 68.34% and 68.97%, respectively (Supplementary Figure
S2A). We have estimated the mean PPIDs of Nsp2s of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV,
and Bat CoV to be 5.17%, 2.04%, and 2.03% respectively (see Table 3). The per-residues
predisposition for the intrinsic disorder of Nsp2s from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV,
and Bat CoV are depicted in Figures 20A, 20B, and 20C. According to this analysis, the
following regions in Nsp2 proteins are predicted to be disordered, residues 570-595 (SARSCoV-2), residues 110-115 (Human SARS), and residues 112-116 (Bat CoV). As listed in
Table 2, and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8, Human SARS CoV does not contain MoRF
while SARS-CoV-2 and Bat CoV have an N-terminally located MoRF region predicted by
MoRFchibi_web.

Figure 21. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp3. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp3 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 1.85 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of
the region containing residues 723-1036 of Nsp3 of Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 2FE8). (E) Aligned
disorder profiles generated for Nsp3 from SARS-CoV-2 (black line), Human SARS CoV (red line),
and Bat CoV (green line) based on the outputs of the PONDR® VSL2.

Non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3). Nsp3 is an almost 2,000-residue-long viral papain-like
protease (PLP) that affects the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and therefore
antagonizes the IFN pathway [130]. It was also demonstrated that Nsp3 works by stabilizing
NF-𝜅𝛽 inhibitor further blocking the NF-𝜅𝛽 pathway [130]. Figure 21D represents the 1.85
Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic core of Nsp3 protein from Human SARS
CoV (PDB ID: 2FE8), which was obtained by Andrew and colleagues [131]. This structure
consists of the residues 723-1036 of Nsp3. The structure revealed folds similar to a
deubiquitinating enzyme in-vitro deubiquitinating activity of which was found to be
efficiently high [131].
Nsp3 protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains several substituted residues throughout the protein. It
is equally close with both Nsp3 proteins of Human SARS and Bat CoV sharing respective
76.69% and 76.31% identity (Supplementary Figure S2B). According to our results, the
mean PPIDs of Nsp3 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 7.40%,
7.91%, and 7.78% respectively (Table 3). Graphs in Figures 21A, 21B, and 21C portray the
tendency of Nsp3 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV for the intrinsic
disorder. Nsp3 proteins of all three studied SARS viruses were found to be highly structured
and characterized by rather similar disorder profiles. This is further supported by Figure 21E,
where PONDR® VSL2-generated disorder profiles of these three proteins are overlapped to
show almost complete coincidence of their major disorder-related features. According to the

mean disorder analysis (see Figures 21A, 21B, and 21C), Nsp3 proteins are predicted to have
the following IDPRs, SARS-CoV-2 (1-5, 105-199, 1221-1238), Human SARS (102-189,
355-384, 1195-1223) and Bat CoV (107-182, 352-376, 1191-1217). The First 112 residues in
Nsp3 represent a ubiquitin-like globular fold while 113-183 residues form the flexible acidic
domain rich in glutamic acid. It is thought to bind and ubiquitinate viral E protein using the
N-terminal acidic domain [132,133]. This unstructured segment has many MoRFs predicted
by ANCHOR and MoRFPred servers which may facilitate the protein-protein interaction
(Table 2). Interestingly, Nsp3 of all three viruses was found with highest number of RNAbinding residues (Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11).
Non-structural protein 4 (Nsp4). Nsp4 has been reported to induce the formation of the
double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) with the co-expression of full-length Nsp3 and Nsp6
proteins for optimal replication inside host cells [134–136]. It localizes itself in ERmembrane, when expressed alone but is demonstrated to be present in replication units in
infected cells. It was observed that Nsp4 protein contains a tetraspanning transmembrane
region having its N- and C-terminals in the cytosol [137]. No crystal or NMR solution
structure is reported for this protein as of yet.

Figure 22. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp4. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp4 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3.

Nsp4 protein of SARS-CoV-2 has multiple substitutions near the N-terminal region and has a
quite conserved C-terminus (Supplementary Figure S2C). It is found to be closer to Nsp4 of
Bat CoV (81.40% identity) than to Human SARS Nsp4 (80%). Mean PPIDs of Nsp4s from
SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are estimated to be 0.80%, 0.60%, and 0.60%
respectively. The low level of intrinsic disorder is further illustrated by Figures 22A, 22B,
and 22C. With PPIDs around zero, Nsp4 were classified as highly structured proteins, which,
however, contain some flexible regions. Likewise, Table 2 shows the presence of only Nand C-terminal MoRFs which possibly assist in cleavage of Nsp4 protein from long
polyproteins 1a and 1ab.
Non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5). Also referred to as 3CL-pro, Nsp5 works as a protease that
cleaves the replicase polyproteins (1a and 1ab) at 11 major sites [138,139]. X-ray crystal
structure with 1.5 Å resolution (PDB ID: 5C5O) obtained for Human SARS CoV Nsp5 is
shown in Figure 23D. Here, 3CL-protease is bound to a phenyl-beta-alanyl (S, R)-N-declin

type inhibitor. Another crystal structure resolved to 1.96 Å revealed a chymotrypsin-like fold
and a conserved substrate-binding site connected to a novel α-helical fold [140]. Recently, the
X-ray crystal structure (resolution 2.16 Å) was solved for the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 in complex
with an inhibitor N3 (PDB ID: 6LU7) (Figure 23E).

Figure 23. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp5. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp5 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 1.50 Å X-ray crystal structure of Nsp5 from
Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 5C5O). (E) A 2.16 Å X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5
(PDB ID: 6LU7).

Nsp5 protein is found to be highly conserved in all three studied CoV viruses. SARS-CoV-2
Nsp5 shares a 96.08% sequence identity with Human SARS Nsp5 and 95.42% with Nsp5 of
Bat CoV (Supplementary Figure S2D). Therefore, it not surprising that our analysis
demonstrated the identical mean PPID values of 1.96% for Nsp5s from SARS-CoV-2,
Human SARS, and Bat CoV (Table 3). The predicted per-residue intrinsic disorder
propensity of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV Nsp5s are presented in Figures
23A, 23B, and 23C, respectively. As the graphs depict, Nsp5s have several flexible regions
and N-terminally IDPR of six residues. Due to the low flexibility of this protein, a single
MoRF predicted by MoRFchibi_web is present in the N-terminal region (residues 3-8) in
Nsp5s of all three viruses (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Further, the identified
nucleotide-binding residues in Nsp5 of all three viruses are tabulated in Supplementary
Tables 9, 10, and 11.
Non-structural protein 6 (Nsp6). Nsp6 protein is involved in blocking ER-induced
autophagosome/autolysosome vesicle formation that functions in restricting viral production
inside host cells. It induces autophagy by activating the omegasome pathway, which is
normally utilized by cells in response to starvation. SARS Nsp6 leads to the generation of
small autophagosome vesicles thereby limiting their expansion [141].

Figure 24. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp6. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp6 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) MSA profile of Nsp6 of SARS-CoV-2,
Human SARS, and Bat CoV. Red shaded sequences represent identical regions of these proteins,
whereas red characters show similar residues.

Nsp6 of SARS-CoV-2 is equally close to Nsp6s from both Human SARS and Bat CoV,
having a sequence identity of 87.24% (Figure 24D). According to our analysis, mean PPIDs
for Nsp6s are calculated to be 1.03%, 1.03%, and 1.03% for SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS
CoV, and Bat CoV, respectively. Figures 24A, 24B, and 24C show the corresponding graphs
of intrinsic disorder tendency of Nsp6s from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat
CoV and demonstrate that these proteins are highly ordered and show low flexibility. As it is
a membrane protein, Nsp6 proteins are predicted to have only a single MoRF near the Nterminal region (residues 1-19 in SARS-CoV-2, residues 1-22 in Human SARS, and residues
1-21 in Bat CoV) by the DISOPRED3 server (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). The
role of these protein-binding regions for the induction of autophagy is need to be elucidated.
Non-structural proteins 7 and 8 (Nsp7 and 8). The ~10 kDa Nsp7 helps in primaseindependent de novo initiation of viral RNA replication by forming a hexadecameric ring-like
structure with Nsp8 protein [142,143]. Both non-structural proteins 7 and 8 contribute 8
molecules to the ring-structured multimeric viral RNA polymerase. Site-directed mutagenesis
in Nsp8 revealed a D/ExD/E motif essential for the in vitro catalysis [142]. Figure 25D
depicts the 3.1 Å resolution electron microscopy-based structure (PDB ID: 6NUR) of the

RDRP-nsp8-nsp7 complex bound to the Nsp12. The structure identified conserved neutral
Nsp7 and Nsp8 binding sites overlapping with finger and thumb domains on Nsp12 of the
virus [144].

the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 3.10 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of
Nsp12-Nsp8-Nsp7 complex (PDB ID: 6NUR). Chain C includes 2-71 residues of Nsp7 (gold colour),

CoV. (E) MSA profile of NSP7 of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat CoV. Red shaded sequences

We found that Nsp7 of SARS-CoV-2 share 100% sequence identity with Nsp7 of Bat CoV
and 98.80% with Nsp7 from Human SARS (Figure 25E), while SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 is closer
to Nsp8 of Human SARS (97.47%) than to Nsp8 of Bat CoV (96.46%) (Figure 26D).

Figure 26. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp8. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp8 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) MSA profile of Nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2,
Human SARS and Bat CoV. Red shaded sequences represent identical regions of these proteins,
whereas red characters show similar residues.

Due to the high levels of sequence identity, mean PPIDs of all Nsp7s were found to be
identical and equal to 9.64%. Both SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS Nsp8 proteins were
calculated to have a mean PPID of 23.74% and, for Nsp8 of Bat CoV mean disorder is
predicted to be 22.22%. Figures 25A, 25B, and 25C display the intrinsic disorder profiles for
Nsp7s, whereas Figures 26A, 26B, and 26C represent the predicted intrinsic disorder
propensity of Nsp8s. As our analysis suggests, Nsp7s might have a well-predicted structure,
while Nsp8s are moderately disordered. Nsp8s are predicted to have a long IDPR (residues
44-84) in both SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS, and a bit shorter IDPR in Bat CoV (residues
48-84). Furthermore, SARS-CoV Nsp7 using its N-terminus residues (V11, C13, V17, and
V21) forms a hydrophobic core with Nsp8 residues (M92, M95, L96, M99, and L103).
Additionally, H-bonding takes place between Nsp7 Q24 and Nsp8 T89 residues [143]. These
amino acids are the part of MoRFs predicted in Nsp7 and Nsp8 proteins. The results are
tabulated in both Table 2, and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. Three protein binding regions
in Nsp7 of SARS-CoV-2 (residues 1-30, 39-58, and 65-83), Human SARS (residues 1-30,
44-58, and 64-83), and Bat CoV (residues 1-30, 39-58, and 65-83) was identified by
MoRFchibi_web server. Nsp7 was found with the presence of very few nucleotide-binding
regions and Nsp8 contains several DNA as well as RNA binding residues (see
Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11).

Non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9). Nsp9 protein is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein
[145]. It might protect RNA from nucleases by binding and stabilizing viral nucleic acids
during replication or transcription [145]. Our results on nucleotide-binding tendency of Nsp9
shows the presence of several RNA binding and few DNA binding residues in Nsp9 of
SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV (Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11).
Presumed to evolve from a protease, Nsp9 forms a dimer using its GXXXG motif [146,147].
Figure 27D shows a 2.7 Å crystal structure of the homodimer of Human SARS Nsp9 (PDB
ID: 1QZ8) that identified a unique and previously unreported for other proteins,
oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide fold-like fold [145]. Here, each monomer contains a coneshaped β-barrel and a C-terminal α-helix arranged into a compact domain [145].

Figure 27. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp9. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp9 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 2.70 Å X-ray crystal structure of 3-113
residues of Nsp9 from Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 1QZ8). (E) MSA profile of Nsp9s from SARSCoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. Red shaded sequences represent identical regions of these
proteins, whereas red characters show similar residues.

Nsp9 of SARS-CoV-2 is equally similar to Nsp9s from both Human SARS and Bat CoV,
having a percentage identity of 97.35%. The difference in three amino acids at 34, 35 and 48
positions accounts for these similarity scores (Figure 27E). As calculated, the mean PPIDs of
Nsp9s of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS CoV, and Bat CoV are 7.08%, 7.96%, and 7.08%
respectively. Figures 27A, 27B, and 27C depict the predicted intrinsic disorder propensity in
the Nsp9 protein from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV. According to our
analysis, all three Nsp9s are rather structured but contain flexible regions. Nsp9 contains
conserved residues (R10, K52, Y53, R55, R74, F75, K86, Y87, F90, K92, R99, and R111) of
positively charged side chains suitable for binding with the negatively charged phosphate
backbone of RNA and aromatic side-chain amino acids providing stacking interactions [145].

These residues are a part of multiple disorder-based binding sites predicted by
MoRFchibi_web server (Table 2, Supplementary Table 7 and 8).
Non-structural protein 10 (Nsp10). Nsp10 performs several functions for SARS-CoV. It
forms a complex with Nsp14 for dsRNA hydrolysis in 3′ to 5′ direction and activates its
exonuclease activity [148]. It also stimulates the methyltransferase (MTase) activity of Nsp14
required during RNA-cap formation after replication [149]. Figure 28D represents the X-ray
crystal structure of the Nsp10/Nsp14 complex (PDB ID: 5C8T) [150]. In agreement with the
results of previous biochemical experimental studies, the structure identified important
interactions with the ExoN (exonuclease domain) of Nsp14 without affecting its N7-MTase
activity [148,149].

Figure 28. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp10. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp10 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 3.20 Å X-ray crystal structure of the
Nsp10/Nsp14 complex (PDB ID: 5C8T). In this structure, A and C chain (cornflower blue colour)
signify show 1-131 residues of Nsp10 and B and D chains correspond to residues 1-453 and 465-525
of Nsp14 (dim grey colour). (E) MSA profile of Nsp10s from SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat
CoV. Red shaded sequences represent identical regions of these proteins, whereas red characters show
similar residues.

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10 protein is quite conserved having a 97.12% sequence identity with
Nsp10 of Human SARS and 97.84% with Nsp10 of Bat CoV (Figure 28E). Mean PPIDs of
all three studied Nsp10 proteins are found to be 5.04%. Figures 28A, 28B, and 28C represent
disorder profiles of Nsp10s and signify the lack of long IDPRs but presence flexible regions
in these proteins. Furthermore, Table 2, and Supplementary Table 7 and 8 shows that all
three virus Nps10 has multiple MoRFs. For SARS-CoV-2, three MoRFs (residues 25-32, 9199, and 133-138) was identified by MoRFchibi_web server and one MoRF (residues 11-18)

was predicted by MoRFPred server. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV Nsp10 residues F16, F19,
and V21 form van der Waals interactions with many of the Nsp14 amino acids [150] and one
residue (F16) is located in MoRF region which we have identified. Furthermore, many
nucleotide-binding residues which are found in all three viruses (Supplementary Table 9,
10, and 11) and above-mentioned residues are not found to interact with DNA/RNA.

Non-structural protein 12 (Nsp12). In coronaviruses, Nsp12 is an RNA-dependent RNA
Polymerase (RDRP). It carries out both primer-independent and primer-dependent synthesis
of viral RNA with Mn2+ as its metallic co-factor and viral Nsp7 and 8 as protein co-factors
[151]. As aforementioned, a 3.1Å resolution structure of Human SARS Nsp12 in association
with Nsp7 and Nsp8 proteins (PDB ID: 6NUR) has been reported using electron microscopy
(Figure 25D). Nsp12 has a polymerase domain similar to “right hand”, finger domain (398–
581, 628–687 residues), palm domain (582–627, 688–815 residues) and a thumb domain
(816–919) [144].

Figure 29. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp12. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp12 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3.

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 protein has a highly conserved C-terminal region (Supplementary
Figure S2E). It is found to share a 96.35% sequence identity with Human SARS Nsp12 and
95.60% with Bat CoV Nsp12. Mean PPID values for all three Nsp12s are estimated to be
0.43% (Table 3). Figures 29A, 29B, and 29C show that although these proteins are mostly
ordered, they have multiple flexible regions. As RDRP protein is observed to be mostly
structured, significant MoRFs in disordered regions are not found (Table 2, Supplementary
Table 7 and 8).

Figure 30. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp13. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp13 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 2.80 Å X-ray crystal structure of 1-596
residues of Human SARS Nsp13 (PDB ID: 6JYT).

Non-structural protein 13 (Nsp13). Nsp13 functions as a viral helicase and unwinds
dsDNA/dsRNA in 5’ to 3’ direction [152]. Recombinant viral helicase expressed in E.coli
Rosetta 2 strain was reported to unwind ~280 bp per second [152]. Figure 30D represents a
2.8 Å X-ray crystal structure of Human SARS Nsp13 (PDB ID: 6JYT) [153]. This helicase
contains a 𝛽19-𝛽20 loop on 1A domain, which is primarily responsible for its unwinding
activity. Furthermore, the study revealed an important interaction of Nsp12 with Nsp13 that
further enhances its helicase activity [153].
The 601-amino-acid-long Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2 is almost completely conserved, as it
shares 99.83% with Nsp13 of Humans SARS and 98.84% with Nsp13 of Bat CoV
(Supplementary Figure S2F). In accordance with our results, the mean PPIDs of all three
Nsp13 proteins are estimated to be 0.67%. Figures 30A, 30B, and 30C show that Nsp13s
contain multiple flexible regions but do not possess significant disorder. As expected, being a
low disorder protein Nsp13 does not contain any MoRF region and not a single bindingregion is located by any server used in all three viruses (Table 2, Supplementary Table 7
and 8). It has many nucleotide-binding residues (RNA and DNA) which are tabulated in
Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11.

Non-structural protein 14. Nsp14 is a multifunctional viral protein that acts as an
Exoribonuclease (ExoN) and methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in SARS coronaviruses. It's 3’ to
5’ exonuclease activity lies in the conserved DEDD residues related to exonuclease
superfamily [154]. Its guanine-N7 methyltransferase activity depends upon the S-adenosyl-Lmethionine (AdoMet) as a cofactor [149]. As aforementioned, Nsp14 requires Nsp10 for
activating its ExoN and N7-MTase activity inside the host cells. Figure 28D depicts the 3.2
Å crystal structure of human SARS nsp10/nsp14 complex (PDB ID: 5C8T), where amino
acids 1-287 form the ExoN domain and 288-527 residues form the N7-MTase domain of
nsp14. A loop (residues 288-301) is essential for its N7-MTase activity [150].

Figure 31. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp14. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp14 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3.

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein shares a 95.07% identity with Human SARS Nsp14 and 94.69%
with Bat CoV Nsp14 (Supplementary Figure S2G). Mean PPID values for Nsp14s from
SARS-CoV-2 and Human SARS is calculated to be 0.38%, while the Nsp14 from Bat CoV
has a mean PPID 0.57%. Predicted per-residue intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp14s from
SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV is represented in Figures 31A, 31B, and 31C,
respectively. As can be observed from these plots and corresponding PPID values, all Nsp14s
are found to be highly structured. Likewise, Table 2 shows Nsp14 contains two protein
binding regions (residues 8-13 and 441-445) predicted by the MoRFPred server in all three
viruses. As shown in Supplementary Tables 9, 10, and 11, the ORF14 represents multiple
nucleotide-binding residues.
Non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15), Nsp15 is a uridylate-specific RNA Endonuclease
(NendoU) that creates a 2′–3′ cyclic phosphates after cleavage. Its endonuclease activity
depends upon Mn2+ ions as co-factors. Conserved in Nidovirus, it acts as an important genetic
marker due to its absence in other RNA viruses [155]. Figure 32D represents a 2.6 Å crystal
structure of Uridylate-specific Nsp15 (PDB ID: 2H85) that was deduced by Bruno and
colleagues using X-ray diffraction [156]. The monomeric Nsp15 has three domains: Nterminal domain (1-62 residues) formed by a three anti-parallel 𝛽-strands and two α-helices
packed together; a middle domain (63–191 residues) that contains an α-helix connected via a
39-amino-acid-long coil to an ordered region containing two α-helices and five 𝛽-strands;

and a C-terminal domain (192–345 residues) consisting of two anti-parallel three 𝛽-strand
sheets on each side of a central α-helical core [156].

Figure 31. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp15. Intrinsic disorder profiles generated
for Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour schemes are
the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 2.60 Å X-ray crystal structure of Nsp15
from Human SARS CoV (PDB ID: 2H85) (rosy brown colour). Residues 151-157 predicted to be
disordered are represented in forest-green colour.

The Nsp15 is found to be quite conserved across human SARS and bat CoVs. SARS-CoV-2
Nsp15 shares an 88.73% sequence identity with Nsp15 of Human SARS and 88.15% with
Nsp15 of Bat CoV (Supplementary Figure S2H). Calculated mean PPIDs of Nsp15s from
SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 1.73%, 2.60%, and 2.60%, respectively.
Similar to many other non-structural proteins of coronaviruses, Nsp15s from SARS-CoV-2,
Human SARS, and Bat CoV are predicted to possess multiple flexible regions but contain
virtually no IDPRs (see Figures 32A, 32B, and 32C). Similarly, no significant disorderbinding regions are predicted in Nsp15 proteins (Table 2). SARS-CoV-2 contain one MoRF
(residues 9-13) predicted by MoRFPred server. Human SARS do not have a single MoRF
while Bat CoV possesses two very short binding regions (Supplementary Table 7 and 8).
Supplementary Table 9, 10, and 11 depicts the presence of many RNA binding residues and
few DNA binding residues in Nsp15 of all three viruses.

Non-structural protein 16 (Nsp16). Nsp16 protein is another MTase domain-containing
protein. As methylation of coronavirus mRNAs occurs in steps, three proteins Nsp10, Nsp14,
and Nsp16 acts one after another. The first event requires the initiation trigger from Nsp10
protein, after which Nsp14 methylates capped mRNAs forming cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs.
Nsp16 protein, along with its co-activator protein Nsp10, acts on cap-0 (7Me) GpppA-RNAs
to give rise to final cap-1 (7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)-RNAs [149,157]. A 2 Å X-ray crystal
structure of the Human SARS nsp10-nsp16 complex is depicted in Figure 33D (PDB ID:
3R24) [158]. The structure consists of a characteristic fold present in class I MTase family
comprising of α-helices and loops surrounding a seven-stranded β-sheet [158].

Figure 33. Analysis of intrinsic disorder propensity of Nsp16. (A) Intrinsic disorder profiles
generated for Nsp15 from SARS-CoV-2 (A), Human SARS CoV (B), and Bat CoV (C). The colour
schemes are the same as in the corresponding plots of Figure 3. (D) A 2.60 Å X-ray crystal structure
of the Human SARS Nsp10-Nsp16 complex (PDB ID: 3R24). Chain A shown in turquoise colour
corresponds to the residues 3-294 of Nsp16

Nsp16 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is found to be equally similar to Nsp16s from Human SARS
and Bat CoV (93.29%) (Supplementary Figure S2I). Mean PPIDs for Nsp16s from SARSCoV-2, Human SARS, and Bat CoV are 5.37%, 3.02%, and 3.02%, respectively. In line with
these PPIDs values, Figures 33A, 33B, and 33C show that Nsp16s are mostly ordered

proteins containing several flexible regions. Correspondingly, no significant MoRFs are
present in this protein (Table 2, Supplementary Table 7 and 8). A single MoRF (residues
151-156) were found with the help of MoRFPred in all three viruses. Further, several RNAbinding and few DNA-binding residues are also identified (Supplementary Table 9, 10, and
11).
Replicase polyprotein 1a. Since replicase polyprotein 1a contains non-structural proteins 110 identical to those found in replicase polyprotein 1ab, we did not perform their disorder
analysis separately. However, replicase polyprotein 1a has one additional non-structural
protein designated as Nsp11.
Non-structural protein 11 (Nsp11). Nsp11 is a small uncharacterized protein cleaved from
the replicase polyprotein 1a. This small protein with unknown function requires experimental
insights to further characterize this protein. The intrinsic disorder predicting software used in
this study requires amino acid sequences, which are at least 30-residue long. Therefore,
because of their short sequences (just 13 residues) Nsp11s from all three studied
coronaviruses were not checked for the intrinsic disorder, disorder-based protein binding
regions, and nucleotide-binding residues. Based on the MSA outputs, Nsp11 from SARSCoV-2 was found to have a sequence identity of 84.62% with Nsp11s from Human SARS
and Bat CoV (Figure 34).

sequences represent identical regions of these proteins, whereas red characters show similar residues.

Concluding remarks
The emergence of new viruses and associated deaths around the globe represent one of the
major concerns of modern times. Despite its pandemic nature, there is very little information
available in the public domain regarding the structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2
proteins. Based on its similarity with Human SARS CoV and Bat CoV, the published reports
have suggested the functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. In this study, we utilized information
available on SARS-CoV-2 genome and translated proteome from GenBank, and carried out a
comprehensive computational analysis of the prevalence of the intrinsic disorder in SARSCoV-2 proteins. Additionally, a comparison was also made with proteins from close relatives
of SARS-CoV-2 from the same group of beta coronaviruses, Human SARS CoV and Bat
CoV. Our analysis revealed that in these three CoVs, the N proteins are highly disordered,
possessing the PPID values of more than 60%. These viruses also have several moderately
disordered proteins, such as Nsp8, Orf6, and Orf9b. Although other proteins have shown
lower disorder content, almost all of them contain at least some IDPRs, and all CoV proteins

analysed in this study definitely have multiple flexible regions. Importantly, our study
provides novel information on presence of intrinsic disorder at the cleavage sites of the
replicase 1ab polyprotein of CoVs. This observation confirms the crucial role of IDPRs in
maturation of individual proteins. We also established that many of these proteins contain
disorder-based binding motifs. Since IDPs/IDPRs might undergo structural transition upon
association with their physiological partners, our study generates important grounds for better
understanding of the functionality of these proteins, their interactions with other viral
proteins, as well as interaction with host proteins in different physiological conditions. This
will also guide structural biologists to carry out a structure-based analysis of SARS-CoV-2
proteome to explore the path for the development of new drugs and vaccines.

Future perspective
The periodical outbreaks of pathogens worldwide always remind the lack of suitable drugs or
vaccines for proper cure or treatment. In 2003, nearly 750 deaths were reported due to the
SARS outbreak in more than 24 countries. But this time, the outbreak of Wuhan's novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly surpassed this number, indicating more causalities
soon. The lack of accurate information and ignorance of primary symptoms are major
reasons, which cause many infection cases. Although efficient transmission from human to
human is confirmed, the actual reasons for fast SARS-CoV-2 spread are still unknown, but
some assumptions were made by researchers and Chinese authorities. The fast spread of
SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, and associated introduction of quarantine also have
made major impacts on economy and education worldwide due to several restrictions, such as
limited transportation, restrained or frozen traveling, halted attendance of mass events, the
introduction of distant teaching and learning, etc. Due to advancements in sequencing
techniques, the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was made available in a few days of
the first infection report from Wuhan, China. However, massive subsequent research needs to
be done to identify the actual cause of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and to design suitable
treatment in the coming future. Certain possibilities can be explored with the available
information. The mutational pressure study on this virus will be very interesting to see if this
virus transforms from Bat SARS to Human SARS to SARS-CoV-2. More in-depth
experimental studies using molecular and cell biology techniques to establish structurefunction relationships are required for a better understanding of the functioning of SARSCoV-2 proteins. Additionally, based on the sequence homology and information on proteinprotein interactions, the associated viral and host proteins should be explored, for finding
means suitable for limiting replication, maturation, and ultimately pathogenesis of this virus.
Although structural biology techniques (so-called rational drug design) can be used in drug
development utilizing high throughput screening of compounds virtually or experimentally,
the applicability of these techniques is limited by the presence of intrinsic disorder in target
proteins. Therefore, the thorough disorder analysis of three coronaviruses conducted in this
study will help structural biologists to rationally design experiments keeping this information
in mind.
