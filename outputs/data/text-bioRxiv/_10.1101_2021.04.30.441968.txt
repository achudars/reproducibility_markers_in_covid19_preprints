Abstract

31

Vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 have gained emergency FDA approval, however the

32

breadth against emerging variants and the longevity of protection remains unknown.

33

Post-immunization boosting may be required, perhaps on an annual basis if the virus

34

becomes an endemic pathogen.

35

developed every year, an undertaking made possible by a robust global vaccine

36

production and distribution infrastructure. To create a seasonal combination vaccine

37

targeting influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 that is also amenable to frequent

38

reformulation, we have developed a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) genetic platform

39

that “reprograms” the virus to package an immunogenic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike

40

(S) protein onto IAV particles. Vaccination with this combination vaccine elicits

41

neutralizing antibodies and provides protection from lethal challenge with both pathogens.

42

This technology may allow for leveraging of established influenza vaccine infrastructure

43

to generate a cost-effective and scalable seasonal vaccine solution for both influenza and

44

coronaviruses.

Seasonal influenza virus vaccines are already

Introduction

47

Every year, sufficient influenza virus vaccines to vaccinate the global population are

48

produced, distributed, and administered1. These vaccines are widely accepted to be safe

49

and efficacious, however they must be constantly reformatted due to viral antigenic drift2,

50

51

developed, allowing for precise manipulation of the influenza viral genome5. Reverse

52

genetics has allowed for the introduction of non-influenza proteins and immune epitopes

.

Additionally, a robust reverse genetics system for influenza viruses has been

53

into influenza viral strains6, 7, 8. Thus, at least in theory, leveraging existing influenza virus

54

vaccine production infrastructure to produce recombinant viral strains that express

55

immunogenic antigens from other pathogens of concern may be a practical approach to

56

generating cost-effective, easily implemented combination vaccines or boosters.

57
58

SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory RNA virus that causes COVID-19 disease that is similar in

59

many respects to influenza-virus induced disease9. While a number of vaccines designed

60

to vaccinate immunologically naïve people and provide protection from COVID-19 are

61

either in use under emergency authorization from the FDA or in advanced stages of

62

development, these vaccines are for the most part: expensive, associated with higher-

63

than-standard side effects, and difficult to produce/distribute10,

64

complicating vaccination efforts is the emergence of variant or mutant strains of SARS-

65

CoV-2 that have been associated with reduced protective vaccine efficacy14. Additionally,

66

protective immunity against human coronaviruses in general, is thought to be relatively

67

short lived15, 16, 17, 18. Thus, it is likely that a cost-effective, scalable, and safe vaccine to

68

periodically boost immunity against SARS-CoV-2 will be needed.

11, 12, 13

.

Further

70

In order to develop a platform-based solution to regularly boost immunity against SARS-

71

CoV-2 and associated variants, we have developed and tested a combination influenza

72

virus-based vaccine that can incorporate both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

73

generating a replication competent IAV that encodes, stably expresses, and packages a

74

key immunogenic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we have generated a

combination vaccine that can be manufactured in the exact same way most influenza

virus vaccines are already produced. To limit cost and the human vaccine burden, a

84

Generation of an H1N1 IAV encoding the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

85

Our initial goal was to develop a strain of influenza A virus (IAV) that would encode a

86

gene for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the major antigen of SARS-CoV-2, the

87

spike (S) glycoprotein19, 20. We wanted this gene to be expressed at high levels and for

88

the translated SARS-CoV-2 antigen to be packaged onto the IAV particle such that the

89

resulting vaccine could be administered as either live attenuated or inactivated vaccines,

90

formulations both currently approved for use in humans21. We have previously published

91

viral genetic modification strategies that allows for the incorporation of a foreign open

92

reading frame into the viral genome22. Using the classical A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1

93

IAV strain as a proof-of-concept platform, we selected one viral locus, 5’ to the viral

94

hemagglutinin (HA) ORF, for insertion of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 1A, top) as it is

95

associated with high expression of a foreign gene22. In order to facilitate incorporation of

96

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD onto nascent viral particles, we fused the ORF to a specific N-

97

terminal sequence from the IAV neuraminidase (NA) protein which contains the

98

transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of that protein. In between the two proteins

100

is a picornaviral 2A motif which ensures that the proteins are co-translationally separated
and can be independently packaged onto the viral particle (Figure 1A, bottom).

101
102

We rescued the virus and verified appropriate insertion of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ORF

103

into the HA-encoding IAV segment via RT-PCR (Figure 1B). To determine if the RBD

104

protein was being expressed and localized appropriately to the plasma membrane, we

105

infected cells and applied antibodies against the IAV HA protein and the SARS-CoV-2

106

RBD to non-permeabilized cells. While infection with both non-modified wild-type (WT)

107

IAV as well as the recombinant vaccine strain (TM-RBD HA) led to expression of HA to

108

the cell surface, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 RBD was only detectable after

109

infection with the recombinant virus (Figure 1C).

110

expressing virus was able to grow to high titers and with similar kinetics to WT virus

111

(Figure 1D-F). Additionally, we wanted to ensure that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF would

112

remain stable in the virus genome. After 10 serial passages, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ORF

113

remained detectable with no appreciable change in RT-PCR product (Figure 1G). Thus,

114

we have demonstrated that we can engineer influenza viruses to stably express a

115

membrane-anchored foreign protein (the SARS-CoV-2 RBD) that grows to levels similar

116

to those of unmodified influenza viruses.

Further, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

117
118

The SARS-CoV-2 RBD is packaged into IAV particles without disruption of native viral

119

proteins

120

Next, we wanted to ensure that the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 RBD was in fact

121

incorporated into the viral particle. We therefore purified WT IAV and the recombinant

122

TM-RBD HA viruses and analyzed their protein composition via western blot. We first

123

normalized loading based on the levels of the IAV matrix (M1) protein in the two samples.

124

The M1 protein forms the viral capsid and is not expected to be altered by changes to

125

glycoprotein composition23. As expected, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 RBD was

126

detectable in the recombinant RBD virus, but not in the WT virus (Figure 2A). In order to

127

determine the influence of the incorporation of another protein in the viral envelope on the

128

native influenza viral surface proteins, we probed for expression of M2 as well as the HA

129

and NA proteins. While the levels of the M2 protein were unchanged, there was a slight

130

reduction in the amount of HA and an increase in the amount of NA packaged into nascent

131

virions compared to WT virus (Figure 2A). Thus, this genetic approach can facilitate

132

packaging of a foreign protein onto a viral particle without dramatic effects on native viral

133

protein incorporation.

134
135

We also wanted to assess the protein packaging under non-denaturing conditions by

136

performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with fully intact virions.

137

Confirming our western blot results, we observed a statistically significant but minor

138

reduction of HA in the recombinant TM-RBD HA virus compared to unmodified WT virus

139

(Figure 2B). We further probed for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD using antibodies that recognize

140

either linear or structural epitopes. A non-conformation specific antibody raised against

141

the RBD yielded strong signal only against the RBD virus (Figure 2C). To test if the RBD-

142

TM fusion protein was folding correctly, we utilized DH1041 and DH1044 which are

143

conformation specific human monoclonal antibodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

144

and also display neutralizing abilities24. Both of these antibodies specifically bound the

145

TM-RBD HA virus and not the parental WT IAV (Figure 2D-E). Taken together, these

146

results indicate that the recombinant TM-RBD HA virus packages properly folded SARS-

147

148

HA, NA, and M2.

149
150

The H1N1/SARS-CoV-2 combination vaccine elicits IAV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

151

antibodies

152

Our next step was to define if the recombinant IAV/SARS-CoV-2 virus elicited the desired

153

immune responses after vaccination. We therefore took naïve mice and primed them

154

with a live vaccination of either WT or the combination IAV/SARS-CoV-2 viral vaccines.

155

Three weeks later, the animals were boosted with an IM injection of the inactivated

156

vaccine preps or BSA as a negative control. Two weeks after the boost, peripheral blood

157

was collected and serum reactivity against the IAV HA protein or the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

158

protein, as well as the neutralizing viral titers against IAV and SARS-CoV-2, were

159

determined (Figure 3A).

160
161

We observed high serum IgG reactivity against the IAV HA protein in both experimental

162

vaccine groups but not the BSA control (Figure 3B). Further, there was no significant

163

differences in the reactivity against HA between the two viral vaccine groups, despite

164

there presumably being slightly less HA in the IAV/SARS-CoV-2 combination vaccine

165

preparation (Figure 3C).

166

binding reactivity was correlated with high antibody neutralizing activity against authentic,

167

infectious H1N1 IAV (Figure 3D). The average 50% plaque reduction neutralization titer

For both experimental vaccine groups, the high antibody

168

(PRNT50) was calculated to be 1:3236 for WT and 1:2767 for TM-RBD HA, however those

169

values were not significantly different from each other (Figure 3E).

170
171

Mouse immune serum from the combination viral vaccine group also showed strong

172

reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, with no notable reactivity from the WT IAV

173

vaccine groups (Figure 3F,G). Plaque reduction assays with SARS-CoV-2 showed that

174

while sera from WT IAV vaccinated animals had no appreciable neutralizing ability, the

175

sera from the IAV/SARS-CoV-2 combination vaccine had strong neutralizing activity with

176

a PRNT50 of approximately 1:679 (Figure 3H,I). Thus, the combination viral IAV/SARS-

177

CoV-2 vaccine is immunogenic and elicits a potentially protective humoral response

178

against SARS-CoV-2. This additional antigenicity comes at no apparent cost for IAV

179

directed immune responses, validating the platform concept of a combination viral

180

particle-based vaccine

181
182

The IAV/SARS-CoV-2 combination vaccine induces a protective immune response

183

against lethal challenges with IAV or SARS-CoV-2

184

Finally, we wanted to determine if the neutralizing antibody responses would also be

185

associated with protection from influenza or SARS-CoV-2 induced disease. We therefore

186

repeated the vaccination schemes and subsequently challenged mice with lethal doses

187

of either IAV or SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4A). For the IAV challenge, we performed an

188

intranasal infection of C57BL/6 mice with the vaccine matched H1N1 strain A/Puerto

189

Rico/8/1934 (PR8). While the BSA control vaccinated animals rapidly lost weight and

190

succumbed to infection, both the WT IAV and the recombinant IAV/SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

191

group were fully protected from virus-induced weight loss or mortality (Figure 4B,C).

192
193

In parallel, we also performed the same prime/boost regiment on transgenic Krt18-hACE2

194

mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background25. These mice express the human SARS-CoV-

195

2 receptor and are thus infectible with WT SARS-CoV-226. Two-weeks after the boost, a

196

lethal dose of SARS-CoV-227 was administered intranasally. While the control mice

197

vaccinated with the WT IAV rapidly lost weight and succumbed to infection, the mice

198

vaccinated with the combination IAV/SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were significantly more

199

protected from viral disease (Figure 4D,E). Thus, at least in mouse models, vaccination

200

with IAV-based SARS-CoV-2 combination vaccine can induce protective immunity, likely

201

via the generation of neutralizing antibodies.

202
203

Discussion

204

The development and production of novel vaccines is frequently labor intensive, costly,

205

and difficult to scale upon high demand. The existing infrastructure for producing influenza

206

vaccines is highly optimized and capable of delivering more than a billion doses per

207

year28. In order to potentially leverage influenza vaccine infrastructure for the production

208

of other vaccines, we have demonstrated that a lab adapted vaccine backbone (A/Puerto

209

Rico/8/1934) can be genetically manipulated to express and package the receptor binding

210

domain from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination of mice with this recombinant

211

virus elicited a high level of immunity and protected against lethal challenge with both IAV

212

and SARS-CoV-2. These data together show that genetic engineering of influenza

213

viruses may be a feasible platform approach to generate combination seasonal vaccines

214

produced in a manner analogous to standard influenza vaccines.

215
216

Our data are in general agreement with previous work that has shown recombinant

217

influenza viruses can be used as a vector to express other antigens. From expressing

218

additional influenza proteins22,

219

pathogens as divergent as Mycobacterium tuberculosis31 and Chlamydia trachomatis32,

220

the IAV can be modified to help elicit non-influenza directed responses from the immune

221

system.

222

that does not package SARS-CoV-2 proteins on viral particles, but expresses them on

223

the surface of cells during infection, can also induce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies33. Thus,

224

data from multiple groups in addition to ours show that recombinant influenza viruses,

225

delivered either as live attenuated or inactivated preparations, are a viable strategy for

226

combination vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.

to expression of antigens and/or epitopes for

In further support of this idea, another recombinant influenza-based strategy

227
228

Despite the data presented in this study, there remain a number of questions that need

229

to be answered. Perhaps most obvious question is if the S protein RBD is the most

230

appropriate antigen relative to either the full S protein or other coronaviral proteins. While

231

clearly vaccine responses against the RBD are sufficient to mediate some protection, it

232

will be important to determine if boosting only RBD directed responses is ultimately an

233

efficacious strategy in people.

234

associated with a reduction in viral yield. Additional studies will be required to understand

235

how decreased yield would affect the eventual vaccine cost or timelines for

236

manufacturing. Finally, we have only utilized one genetic background and corresponding

237

set of viral glycoproteins for these studies. While PR8 is a standard background for

238

vaccine development, it will also be important to understand if other H1 (or indeed, H3 or

239

influenza B virus) HA proteins are amenable to our manipulations to segment length and

240

composition such that a membrane anchored RBD domain can be functionally encoded.

241
242

In conclusion, the influenza-based, multi-valent vaccines may represent a generalizable

243

approach to reduce the time and manufacturing requirements for development of novel

244

vaccines. Since the current influenza vaccine is composed of three or four distinct

245

strains34, this approach could be even more highly multiplexed than eliciting responses

246

against two pathogens. While there remain questions to be answered and technical

247

challenges to overcome, “reprogramming” influenza viruses may be an attractive

248

approach to produce and package antigens that are difficult to purify or are poorly

249

immunogenic on their own. Continued work on this and other generalizable vaccine

250

platforms will not only help with the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic but will

251

help poise us for rapid response during future epidemic/pandemic outbreaks.

allantoic fluid was then harvested from and titer determined via plaque assay on MDCK

305

cells. This was accomplished by serially diluting allantoic fluid and then incubating

306

MDCKs with 500 µL of the diluted sample for 1 hour at 37 °C. After incubation, the viral

307

suspension was aspirated, agar overlay was applied, and cells were incubated at 37 °C

308

for 48-72 hours depending on plaque size. Plaque assays were then fixed by adding 2mL

309

of 4% paraformaldehyde solution and incubating overnight at room temperature in a fume

310

hood. The next day paraformaldehyde was aspirated, and cells were washed prior to

above. For viral growth curves and endpoint titer assays, eggs were injected with 10,000

313

pfu/egg and eggs were collected for plaque assay at 24, 48, and 72 hours post infection.

314

Hemagglutination assays were performed by serially diluting virus 1: 2 in PBS in a 96 well

315

plate then adding chicken blood to each well. Plates were incubated 1 hour then each

316

well was scored as positive or negative. SARS-CoV-2 stocks were grown on Vero E6

317

cells in virus infection media (MEM+Earl’s Salts, penicillin/streptomycin, 2% FBS, 1mM

318

Na Pyruvate, 1x MEM NEAA) for 72 hours. Stocks were frozen at -80 °C and were titered

319

by serially diluting virus in virus infection media then infecting a confluent monolayer of

320

Vero E6 cells growing in 6-well, poly-L-lysine treated, plates for 1 hour. Inoculum was

321

then removed and an agarose overlay was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and

322

5% CO2 for 72 hrs then were stained with 0.05% neutral red in PBS for 3 hours.

323
324

Viral purification

325

Purification of influenza viral particles was performed prior to use in vaccination and

326

ELISA experiments. First, viral stocks were grown in 10-day old embryonated hen eggs

327

as described above. Then allantoic fluid was collected and dialyzed overnight using the

328

Spectra-Por Float-a-lyzer G2 10 mL, 100 kDA MWCO tubes according to manufacturer’s

329

instructions (Millipore Sigma cat. no. Z727253-12EA). After samples were dialyzed to

330

remove larger impurities, the allantoic fluid was collected and virus samples concentrated

331

by ultracentrifugation using a 30% sucrose cushion for 1 hour at 25,700 RPM using the

332

Sorvall TH-641 swinging bucket rotor. Virus samples were then resuspended in PBS and

333

pooled prior to being fixed in 0.02% formalin for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples

RT-PCR and serial passage experiments

338

Viral RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by cholorform/ethanol

339

precipitation or using Qiagen viral RNA miniprep kits. RT-PCR reactions were performed

340

using SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System kits (Thermo cat. no. 12574026)

341

according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Primers used were, HA 5’ Forward: 5’-

GTAGATGCAGCAAAAGCAGGGGAAAATA-3’,

343

CCATCCTCAATTTGGCAC-3’. RT-PCRs using RNA generated from miniprep kits varied

344

in template concentration as the presence of carrier RNA inhibits nucleic acid

345

quantification via photometric means. RT-PCR products were analyzed on 0.8-1%

346

agarose gels run at 50V. For serial passage experiments, an 80% confluent monolayer

347

of MDCK cells was infected with a MOI of 0.01 for 48 hrs. After 48 hrs, cell supernatants

348

were collected and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500 x g. Supernatant was removed and

349

100 µl was added to 1ml of Trizol and frozen at -80 °C. The titer of the remaining virus

350

was then estimated by Hemagglutination assay and a new monolayer of cells was

351

subsequently infected. This protocol was repeated 10 times.

Animal infections/Live-attenuated vaccination

406

Animal infections were performed using age-matched C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs 000664)

407

or B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J mice (Jackson Labs 034860) in accordance with Duke

408

University IACUC approved protocol numbers A189-18-08 and A081-20-04. For influenza

409

infections, mice were anesthetized using 100 µL of a 14.2 mg/ml ketamine-xylazine

410

mixture via intraperitoneal injection. After administration of anesthesia, mice were marked

411

and baseline weights were measured. Mice were then given a 40 µL intranasal inoculum

412

of virus, at the 10 pfu WT PR8 or 250 pfu PR8 TM-RBD HA, diluted in pharmaceutical-

413

grade PBS. After infection, mice were weighed daily and euthanized once their body

414

weight reached 75% of the baseline weight for IAV. This cutoff was determined respective

415

to the weight prior to infection. Euthanasia was performed via a primary method of CO2

416

asphyxiation and bilateral thoracotomy as a secondary confirmation. These methods

417

were used during both challenge experiments and administration of the live virus vaccine

418

prime. For SARS-CoV-2 challenge experiments, prior to infection, mice were injected

419

subcutaneously with IPT-300 transponders capable of reading body temperature and

420

animal ID (BMDS IPT-300) and baseline weights and temps were measured. On the day

421

of infection, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane then given a 50 µL intranasal

422

inoculum of virus, 3x104 pfu, diluted in pharmaceutical-grade PBS. After infection, mice

423

were monitored daily for weight, temperature and clinical signs. Mice were euthanized

body weight reached 80% of the baseline weight measured prior to infection or reached

426

a clinical score of 4 in accordance with the approved protocol above A081-20-04.

Vaccination of mice

429

Vaccine doses for the boost were prepared using the purified inactivated virus described

430

above. Virus samples were then diluted 1:1 with the adjuvant Addavax (Invivogen cat. no.

431

vac-adx-10) to a final concentration of 100 µg/mL. After preparation of doses, mice were

432

anesthetized as described above and then administered a 100 µL injection

433

intramuscularly into the left leg. Mice were then monitored the next day for side effects

434

and then housed for the indicated period of time before collection or viral challenge. If

435

serum was collected, mice were administered a lethal dose of the ketamine-xylazine (200

436

µL) and then blood was harvested and serum collected using Sarstedt Z-Gel tubes

437

according to manufacturer’s instruction (Sarstedt cat. no. 41.1378.005). Serum was then

438

stored at -20 °C until use.

440

Plaque reduction neutralization assays

441

MDCK and Vero cells were used for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction assays,

442

respectively. A master mix of virus was diluted to the indicated concentration (~40-80

443

PFU/mL) and aliquoted prior to being mixed with antibody dilutions. Following a 45-minute

444

incubation at room temperature with antibody, the media was aspirated from cells and

445

500 µL of the virus-antibody mixture was added to each well of cells. For each experiment

446

a no antibody control was included to accurately record how much virus had been used

447

to infect cells. Cells were incubated with the virus-antibody mixture at 37 °C for 1 hour,

448

rocking the samples every 15 minutes to ensure cells were completely covered by the

449

solution. After this period, the solution was aspirated, and an agar overlay was applied.

450

For influenza plaque reduction assays, staining and plaque counting was performed as

451

described above in the titering section. SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction assays were

452

evaluated by first staining plaques with .05% Neutral Red solution for 3 hours at 37 °C

453

(Sigma Aldrich cat. no. N2889-100mL). Neutral red was then aspirated from the wells and

454

plaques were counted. The percent reduction in plaques was calculated in reference to

455

a no sera control. The PRNT50 value was calculated by using a non-linear regression

456

model, [Agonist] vs. response—Find ECanything with f constrained to 50. The reciprocal

457

50% neutralization titer was calculated by averaging the greatest dilution of mouse sera

458

that had a >50% reduction in plaques compared to a no sera control for each sera sample

459

in a vaccination group.

Figures and Legends

Figure 1. Generation of an IAV strain that stably incorporates the SARS-CoV-2
spike RBD domain into the viral particle. (A) Diagram showing genetic modulation of
the HA segment to enable insertion of a foreign ORF. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD was fused
to the NA transmembrane domain and a PTV1-2A site was introduced to allow for cotranslation of the RBD and HA. (B) Segment 4 RT-PCRs with WT and TM-RBD HA
viruses. (C) Immunofluorescence microscopy images of non-permeablized cells infected
with WT or TM-RBD virus and stained for HA (top) or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (bottom). Scale
bar indicates 100 µm. (D) HA assays of WT/TM-RBD HA viruses after growth in
embryonated chicken eggs for 72 hours. (E) Plaque assays of WT/TM-RBD HA viruses
grown in embryonated chicken eggs at 24, 48, and 72 hours. (F) Plaque assays WT/TMRBD HA viruses of after growth in embryonated chicken eggs for 72 hours. (G) Segment
4 RT-PCRs with WT and TM-RBD HA viruses after 10 passages on MDCK cells. P0
indicates the stock of virus used for the experiment. Statistical analyses were performed
using unpaired t-tests. For all panels, P-values denoted with asterisks correspond to the
following values: * < 0.05, *** < 0.001, and ns = not significant.

Figure 2. The TM-RBD-HA virus incorporates appropriately folded RBD without
disrupting incorporation of the IAV viral envelope proteins. (A) Western blot analysis
of WT and TM-RBD HA viruses. Samples were normalized via M1 protein signal using
pixel densitometry. (B) (left) ELISAs using the PY102 anti-HA antibody against whole
virus particles and (right) area under the curve analysis. (C) (left) ELISAs using a SARSCoV-2 anti-RBD antibody (binds a non-structural epitope) against whole virus particles
and (right) area under the curve analysis. (D) ELISAs using a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibody (DH1041, binds a structural epitope on the RBD), against whole virus particles
and (right) area under the curve analysis. (E) Same analysis as in (D) using a different
conformation-specific SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, DH1044. Statistical analyses
were performed using unpaired t-tests. For all panels, P-values denoted with asterisks
correspond to the following values: * < 0.05, **** < 0.0001, and ns = not significant.

Figure 3. Vaccination of mice with the TM-RBD HA virus elicits strong neutralizing
antibody responses to both IAV and SARS-CoV-2. (A) Experimental design displaying
vaccination strategy, sample collection, and downstream assays. (B) ELISAs using serum
from vaccinated mice against purified soluble HA protein. (C) Area under the curve
analysis for (B). (D) IAV plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) with serum from
vaccinated mice. (E) Reciprocal 50% neutralization titer using IAV plaque neutralization
data. (F) ELISAs using serum from vaccinated mice against purified soluble SARS-CoV2 RBD protein. (G) Area under the curve analysis for (B). (H) SARS-CoV-2 plaque
reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) with serum from vaccinated mice. (I) Reciprocal
50% neutralization titer using SARS-CoV-2 plaque neutralization data. Statistical
analyses were performed using unpaired t-tests. For all panels, P-values denoted with
asterisks correspond to the following values: ** < 0.01, and **** < 0.0001.
