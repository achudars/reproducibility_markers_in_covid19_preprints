ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been
identified as the causative agent for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The ability of this agent to be
transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in
serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne
pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in
reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and
whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen
Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the
samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells. Each plasma
pool (n=9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then
repeated using individual whole blood donations (n=3).
RESULTS: Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection
for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended
by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and
3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units.
CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of
detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood. Two clades of SARS-CoV-2
have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong
immunity to the other. Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients
with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.

INTRODUCTION
Due to a combination of factors including rapidly mutating viral strains, increasingly close animal-human
contacts, and ever burgeoning rates of travel and urbanization, the rate at which new human pathogens
emerge and spread globally appears to be rising over the last 80 years (1). Climate change is likely to
accelerate pandemic emergence because temperate zones encompass a larger area of the globe,
expanding vector territories and favoring bacterial pathogens (2,3). Mass gatherings and higher Basic
Reproduction Numbers further contribute to rapid dissemination around the globe (4,5). The emergence
of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), whose causative agent is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is only the latest example of the speed with which a pathogen can travel
around the globe causing successive waves of outbreaks (5).

Despite the recent emergence of this pandemic, community spread of COVID-19 is well recognized but
transfusion transmission has yet to be reported (4,6). In the early days of the pandemic experts debated
whether asymptomatic transmission was possible, a necessary precondition for transmission through
transfusion given rigorous donor screening practices (7). That question; however, is no longer debated as
the degree of community transmission in Italy and now New York have accelerated despite symptomatic
screening. COVID-19 is characterized by viral shedding which starts during an initial asymptomatic phase
that can last more than 14 days, followed by active disease and post-resolution viral shedding that can
persist for up to 37 days (7). Furthermore, findings of viral RNA in multiple bodily fluids tested including
blood raises considerable concern regarding the safety of convalescent plasma (8). In one study, viral RNA
was detected in the blood of 96.8% of affected patients (9). While SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have not been documented to cause transfusion-transmitted disease, those
pathogens resulted in higher mortality, but lower infectivity due to a lower binding efficiency with the

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptors, respectively. By
contrast, SARS-CoV-2 binding strength to the ACE2 receptor is higher, suggesting a cause for the greater
propensity for human to human transmission (10,11). Observations regarding the absence of documented
transfusion transmission of SARS and MERS may not be a good indication of whether COVID-19 poses a
threat to the blood supply.

Pathogen reduction with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R+UV PRT) has demonstrated excellent activity
against MERS CoV, suggesting that R+UV PRT could be protective against the possibility of transfusion
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (12). In this study, we used infectivity assays to test the efficacy of R+UV PRT
to reduce the level of infectious SARS-CoV-2 inoculates in plasma and whole blood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasma Products
Nine plasma products were collected at an accredited blood bank and shipped to Colorado State
University on dry ice. The products were classified as PF24, prepared from whole blood products collected
in Citrate Phosphate Double Dextrose (CP2D) and frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy to ≤ -20°C.
Products were thawed in a water bath at 36°C and pooled in sets of 3 by ABO type to create 3 unique
pools. This was performed for two distinct volumes of plasma with average of 170 mLs and average of
250 mLs each.

Whole Blood Products
Three non-leukoreduced whole blood (WB) products were collected in Citrate Phosphate Dextrose (CPD)
anticoagulant at an accredited blood bank and shipped to Colorado State University at room temperature.

SARS-CoV-2 Propagation
Virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was acquired through BEI Resources (product NR-52281) and amplified in
Vero cell culture. Medium harvested from infected cells 3-4 days after inoculation was clarified by
centrifugation, supplemented with FBS to 10% and frozen to -80°C in aliquots. All virus propagation
occurred in a BSL-3 laboratory setting.

Pathogen Reduction Process, Plasma
After pooling, each pool was divided in 3 equal volumes of 175 mL dispensed into an illumination bag
(Mirasol Illumination Bag, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). Riboflavin solution (35 mL, 500 µmol/L) was added
to each product, followed by inoculation with 5 mL SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the bags were placed into the
Illuminator (Mirasol PRT System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO) for treatment with UV light. The products
in each set of 3 were treated to either 30%, 60%, or 100% of the total recommended light dose, calculated
based on the volume of each product (a full treatment consists of exposure to 6.24 J/mL UV light). Samples
were removed from each product pre- and post-illumination for viral titer determination via plaque assay.
All processing occurred in a BSL-3 laboratory setting.

Pathogen Reduction Process, Whole Blood
Each WB product was transferred to an illumination bag per the manufacturer’s instructions. Riboflavin
solution (35 mL, 500 µmol/L) was added to each product, followed by inoculation with 20 mL SARS-CoV2 virus, and the bags were placed into the illuminator for treatment with UV light -calculated using the
measured hematocrit and volume of each product - to a dose of 80 J/mL RBC. Samples were removed from
each product pre- and post-illumination for viral titer determination via plaque assay. All processing
occurred in a BSL-3 laboratory setting.

Viral Plaque Assay
All pre- and post- illumination samples were serially diluted in sterile PBS. Plaque assays were performed
using Vero cells at confluency in 6-well cell culture plates. Briefly, plates were washed with sterile PBS. All
samples were then plated in duplicates at 100 µL per well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes
with occasional rocking. Then 2 mL of 0.5% agarose in minimal essential media (MEM) containing 2% FBS
and antibiotics was added per well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. The cells were fixed with
10% buffered formalin, followed by the removal of the overlay, and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet
to visualize plaque forming units (PFU). All assays were performed in BSL-3 laboratory setting. Figure 1.

Calculation of Limit of Detection and Log Reduction
When the posttreatment samples were negative for the presence of virus, the limit of detection had been
reached. All values at the limit of detection were considered less than or equal to the calculated limit of
detection. The theoretical limit of detection and overall log reduction was calculated using the following
equations:
LOD = log [1/ (N x V)]

(1)

Log Reduction = Log (Starting Titer, PFU/mL)- Log (Final Titer, PFU/mL) (2)

where N is the number of replicates per sample at the lowest dilution tested; V is the volume used for
viral enumeration (volume inoculated/ well in mL). No cytotoxicity was observed at the zero dilution,
hence all replicates for determination of LOD and final titer were done at zero dilution with 10 replicates
using 0.1 mL per replicate well.

RESULTS
Data on dilution factors for virus titration into plasma and whole blood are included in Table 1. This data
indicates reasonable recovery of the stock virus titer after dilution of the virus stock into the blood
products. Values between predicted and observed titers in the recovered virus from stock sample dilution
into plasma and whole blood were on the order of +/-0.45 log10, indicating that adsorption of virus to
protein or cellular components is unlikely.

The in vitro plaque assays demonstrated that pathogen reduction of plasma inoculated with SARS-CoV-2
was able to reduce infectious titers to the limit of detection by > 3.77 +/- 0.27 and > 3.76 +/- 0.15 log10 at
60% and 100% of the UV dose recommended by the manufacturer, respectively at volumes of 170 mLs
(Table 2). The fact that the limit of detection was achieved in plasma at 60% of the recommended UV dose
suggests that higher starting viral titers could have resulted in higher log kill. At higher volumes of plasma
and higher spike titers, the level of reduction observed was ≥ 4.72 +/- 0.24 and ≥ 4.79 +/- 0.15 log10 at 60%
and 100% of the UV dose, respectively (Table 3). Similarly, R + UV PRT was effective at reducing infectious
viral loads in whole blood with a mean log reduction of 3.30+/-0.26 log10 in infectious titers (Table 4) but
did not achieve complete inactivation, suggesting that the maximum log reduction was achieved in those
samples. The level of reduction observed generally exceeded 3 log10 for both plasma and whole blood.
Given the current limits on detection using PCR methods for screening, these results suggest at a minimum
coverage for potential window period transmission risk.

DISCUSSION
The novel COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in recent memory and the disease results in a severe
pulmonary syndrome in a subset of patients. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted through
transfusions is unknown. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in blood at very low levels and no

documented cases of transfusion transmission have been reported in the literature (13). Despite this, the
World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended deferring
donors based on risk of SARS due to a theoretical risk of transmission (8). The current novel coronavirus
pandemic exhibits higher viral loads in blood samples and far greater human-to-human spread. Early in
the course of the pandemic in the United States, FDA suggested a 28-day deferral for travel-associated
risk; however, with over 85 thousand cases at the time of writing and no states free of cases, this strategy
is no longer tenable.

M.B. Pagano et al. described their experience with adapting to pandemic conditions in Washington State
and stated that blood donations fell precipitously as the number of cases rose exponentially (14).
Shortages were resolved with a combination of decreasing demand by cancelling elective surgeries,
transporting blood from other states, and careful management of the supply. With a majority of the
country experiencing exponential growth in cases, this may be increasingly difficult to replicate in other
areas. Community spread has accelerated since the publication of the BloodWorks Northwest experience
and the ability to trace the origin of each case has been lost as the pandemic has accelerated.

For a blood industry that is dependent on the use of human volunteer donors, such an event poses an
existential threat to the blood supply, albeit temporary. Reduced access to donors due to restricted
movement and concerns over the risk of proximity to hospitals and donor centers place severe constraints
on the ability to maintain an adequate supply. With increasing prevalence of the disease and recognition
of the risk of asymptomatic viral shedding come concerns that the donations may themselves serve as a
vector for disease transmission. Furthermore, diagnostic testing of the blood is not feasible as the health
care system struggles to address the growing number of cases needing evaluation.

In this environment, determining whether transfusion transmission in human subjects has occurred is not
possible and eliminating donors with potential asymptomatic infectivity is problematic. Despite
widespread cancelations of elective cases throughout the country, blood products will still be required
due to injury or illness for patients who are presumed to be naïve. Additionally, FDA released an
Emergency Use Authorization for compassionate use of convalescent plasma in the most critically ill
patients and has signaled the willingness to consider research studies to assess the safety and efficacy in
other populations. Clinical studies to assess the potential of convalescent plasma to circumvent full blown
COVID-19 in exposed high-risk subjects are under consideration; however, concerns remain regarding
potential inadvertent transfusion of viable virus.

The plasma fractionation industry has experience with a high risk of infection due to the large number of
plasma units pooled and have developed processing methods that inactivate or reduce the levels of
infectious agents in blood products. In these manufacturing settings, blood is processed to remove or
inactivate pathogens and render the resulting product safe for use. Contamination with new, emerging
agents is determined via direct testing or is extrapolated based on the behaviors of similar agents treated
under these conditions.

Methods employed include ultrafiltration, heat inactivation and solvent-

detergent treatment, all of which have been found to significantly reduce pathogen contaminants when
used alone or in combination in processing of donated plasma for fractionation.

Plasma fractionation techniques are not suitable for cellular components or single donation products such
as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Frozen Plasma-24 Hours (FP-24) units. Recently, however, new
pathogen reduction methods have emerged for the treatment of plasma, platelets and whole blood
products that can be used for treatment of single or pooled donations such as buffy coat platelets.
Riboflavin is a photosensitizer that, in the presence of UV excitation, can induce changes to DNA and RNA

via electron transfer chemistry and reactive oxygen species generation. These changes result in the
inability of treated agents to replicate. R + UV PRT has received market approval in Europe, Africa, Asia,
and South America and is in clinical development in the United States under an Investigation Device
Exemption.

Our results in this study demonstrate that R + UV PRT is effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity to the
limit of detection in plasma inoculated with virus. Pathogen reduction was also effective for whole blood
units, suggesting that the riboflavin and UV method can provide a measure of safety against this
enveloped, positive-sense, single strand RNA virus. In a rapidly moving environment in which cases are
rising by over 15,000 cases per day at the time of writing and major cities across the country struggling to
contain the spread of the pandemic, security of the blood supply is in serious question. A pathogen
reduction technology would provide a measure of security that would allow donations from asymptomatic
adults to continue to support the critically ill requiring transfusions. Recovered patients with antibody
response could provide convalescent plasma to help protect health care workers exposed to who will be
needed to contain the crisis. Passive immunity could also assist high risk patients and the critically ill to
clear viral loads. Previous studies have demonstrated that R + UV PRT is a potential tool to mitigate the
risk of infection from convalescent plasma. An in vitro study conducted with Ebola Virus (EBOV) in serum
and whole blood from non-human primates with Ebola disease demonstrated that antibody titers were
maintained within protective thresholds after R+UV PRT (15).

This study has limitations. Other blood components such as platelets and red blood cells were not
assessed. Plasma and whole blood from infected patients were not assessed for infectivity. The capacity
of transfused blood products from an animal infected with SARS-CoV-2 to cause disease was not assessed
but is the focus of ongoing studies in our labs. The limit of detection was reached in the plasma

experiments thus the full range of pathogen inactivation was not measured but is greater than 4.79 ± 0.15
logs at the UV dose recommended by the manufacturer.

SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated frequent mutations since it was first recognized in December of 2019,
evolving into two different strains (designated L and S), suggesting a possible propensity to develop
subtypes that could result in seasonal variability and lack of immunity to the new strains for those exposed
to the previous strains (16). To date, the differences in the two strains appear to be related to infectivity
and the impact on conferred immunity is not clear. In the setting of this rapidly expanding pandemic, a
significant number of severely ill patients, and unclear transmissibility in blood, experts are advising
caution. Even though a mere month has passed since the article by Drs. Dodd and Stramer were published,
it is becoming clear that deferment is becoming increasing untenable as a strategy to address the risk (6).
Pathogen reduction may be the only viable solution to protect the blood supply during this crisis.

CONCLUSIONS
Pathogen reduction with riboflavin and UV light results in high levels of reduction of SAR-CoV-2 infectivity
in inoculated plasma and whole blood. While the infectivity of blood from COVID-19 patients and its
transmissibility via transfusion is not proven, the presence of viral RNA in blood is of concern and rapidly
expanding community spread combined with a long asymptomatic latent period is limiting the ability of
blood centers to identify who should be deferred. The rapid rise of cases suggests the US is still in the
exponential phase of pandemic. Pathogen reduction could be a viable strategy to protect the blood supply
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
