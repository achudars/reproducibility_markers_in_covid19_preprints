Abstract:

28

IgG antibodies are crucial for protection against invading pathogens. A highly conserved N-

29

linked glycan within the IgG-Fc-tail, essential for IgG function, shows variable composition in

30

humans. Afucosylated IgG variants are already used in anti-cancer therapeutic antibodies for

31

their elevated binding and killing activity through Fc receptors (FcγRIIIa). Here, we report that

32

afucosylated IgG which are of minor abundance in humans (~6% of total IgG) are specifically

33

formed against surface epitopes of enveloped viruses after natural infections or

34

immunization with attenuated viruses, while protein subunit immunization does not elicit

35

this low fucose response. This can give beneficial strong responses, but can also go awry,

36

resulting in a cytokine-storm and immune-mediated pathologies. In the case of COVID-19,

37

the critically ill show aggravated afucosylated-IgG responses against the viral spike protein. In

38

contrast, those clearing the infection unaided show higher fucosylation levels of the anti-

39

spike protein IgG. Our findings indicate antibody glycosylation as a potential factor in

40

inflammation and protection in enveloped virus infections including COVID-19.

Main Text:

42

Antibodies have long been considered functionally static, mostly determined by their isotype

43

and subclass. The presence of a conserved N-linked glycan at position 297, in the so called

44

constant Fc-domain of IgG, is essential for effector functions (1–3). Moreover, it is now

45

generally accepted that the composition of this glycan is highly variable and has functional

46

consequences (2–4). This is especially true for the core fucose attached to the Fc glycan. The

47

discovery that IgG variants without core fucosylation cause elevated antibody dependent

48

cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), via increased IgG-Fc-receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa) affinity (5, 6),

49

resulted in next-generation glyco-engineered monoclonal antibodies (mAb) without core

50

fucosylation for targeting tumors (7).

51

Generally, changes in the Fc glycans are associated with age, sex and autoimmune diseases

52

(8). Serum IgG are highly fucosylated at birth and slightly decrease to ~94% fucosylation at

53

adulthood (9). Until now, no strong clues on how IgG core fucosylation is controlled have

54

come forward.

55

We have previously observed that alloantibodies against red blood cells (RBC) and platelets

56

show remarkably low IgG-Fc-fucosylation in most patients, even down to 10% in several

57

cases (10–12), whereas the overall serum IgG Fc-fucosylation show consistently normal high

58

levels. Moreover, we have reported the lowered IgG-Fc fucosylation to be one of the factors

59

determining disease severity in pregnancy associated alloimmunizations, resulting in

60

excessive thrombocytopenia’s and blood cell destruction when targeted by afucosylated

61

antibodies (11–13). In addition to the specific afucosylated-IgG response against platelets

62

and RBC antigens, this response has also been identified against HIV and Dengue virus (14,

63

15), but not for any other immune response so far, e.g. not against inactivated influenza,

64

pneumococcal, meningococcal or tetanus vaccines (16, 17). Interestingly, low core

65

fucosylation of anti-HIV antibodies has been suggested to be a feature of elite controllers of

66

infection, and for Dengue it has been associated with enhanced pathology due to excessive

67

FcγRIIIa-activation (14, 15).

68

Inspired by the similarities between the unique afucosylated IgG responses in various

69

alloimmune responses (10–12, 18), HIV (15) and Dengue(14) – all being directed against

70

surface exposed and membrane embedded proteins -we analyzed IgG glycosylation in anti-

71

human platelet and red-blood cell alloimmune responses as well as in natural infections by

72

other enveloped viruses, including HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and SARS-CoV-2. Similarly,

73

we also assessed for a non-enveloped virus (Parvovirus B19), vaccination with a protein

74

subunit, and live attenuated enveloped viruses, to test if the antigen context is indeed an

75

important determinant for IgG-Fc glycosylation.

76

To investigate the Fc-glycosylation of total- and antigen-specific antibodies, first IgG from

77

>400 human serum samples was affinity-purified using protein G affinity beads and

78

immobilized antigens, respectively. Thereafter, isolated IgG was digested with trypsin and

79

resulting IgG1-Fc-glycopeptides were analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass

80

spectrometry (LC-MS) (Fig. 2A) (11, 16, 18). Subsequently, intensities were extracted and IgG-

81

glycosylation profiles were calculated (Fig. 1B-C).

Antigen-specific antibodies against the alloantigen human platelet antigen (HPA)-1a showed

alloantigens (11, 18).

110

Analogous to the platelet and Red Blood cell alloantigens (10–12, 18), the response to these

111

enveloped viruses also showed significant afucosylation of the antigen-specific IgG (Fig.2B),

112

while the afucosylation was absent against the non-enveloped virus Parvo B19 (Fig.2C). Of

113

note, total IgG showed high fucosylation levels throughout (Fig.2A-C), underlining that the

114

majority of human IgG responses consists of fucosylated IgG responses (11, 16, 19). The

115

extent of the response to the enveloped viruses was highly variable, both between

116

individuals and between the types of antigen, which is in agreement with the variable

117

tendency of different RBC-alloantigens to induce an afucosylated response (18).

118

Afucosylation was particularly strong for CMV and to a lesser degree for HIV (Fig. 2B). The

119

anti-HIV response is in line with what was previously described by Ackerman et al., showing a

120

decreased fucosylation of HIV-specific IgG compared to total IgG (15). Other glycan traits are

121

depicted in Fig. S1.

122

To test whether some individuals had a greater intrinsic capacity to generate an afucosylated

123

IgG response than others, we compared IgG-Fc fucosylation levels formed against different

124

antigens within the same individual. No correlation in IgG1 Fc fucosylation was observed

125

between anti-HPA1a and anti-CMV (Fig. S2), nor between anti-HIV and anti-CMV antibodies

126

in the same individual (Fig. S2), suggesting that the level of afucosylation is not determined

127

by a general host factor such as genetics but is rather stochastic or multifactorial, with the

128

specific triggers remaining obscure.

129
130

To further investigate the immunological context by which potent low fucosylated IgG is

131

formed, we compared immune responses to identical viral antigens in different contexts.

132

First, we compared Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-specific antibody glycosylation in

133

humans naturally infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or vaccinated with the recombinant

134

HBsAg protein (Fig. 2D). Whereas total-IgG1 fucosylation levels were similar in the two

135

groups, anti-HBsAg IgG1 fucosylation was elevated in individuals vaccinated with the HBsAg

136

protein both compared to the fucosylation of total IgG of both groups and antigen-specific

137

IgG of the naturally infected group. The finding that HBsAg-specific antibodies in individuals

138

that cleared a natural infection showed lowered Fc-fucosylation compared to protein subunit

139

vaccination strongly suggests that a specific context for the antigenic stimulus is required for

140

afucosylated-IgG responses.

141

We then compared antiviral-IgG responses against Mumps- and Measle viruses-formed after

142

a natural infection or vaccination with live attenuated viruses. Unlike the HBV protein subunit

143

vaccine, both attenuated live vaccines showed a similar Ag-specific Fc-fucosylation compared

144

to their natural infection counterpart (Fig. 2E, Fig. S3). Both showed reduction, with a more

145

prominent difference for the mumps response (Fig. 2E, Fig S3). Other glycan traits for anti-

146

measles and anti-mumps are shown in Fig. S1.

147

We then tested if this type of response also plays a role in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-

148

19). Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly diverse, ranging from asymptomatic or mild self-

149

limiting infection to a severe airway inflammation leading to respiratory distress, often with a

150

fatal outcome(20, 21). Both extreme trajectories, follow similar initial responses: patients

151

have approximately a week of relatively mild symptoms, followed by a second wave that

152

either clears the disease or leads to a highly-aggravated life-threatening phenotype (20, 21).

153

Both the timing of either response type and the differential clinical outcome suggests

154

different paths taken by the immune system to combat the disease. So far no clear evidence

155

has emerged that can make a distinction between these two hypothetical immunological

156

paths. In accordance with our theory and responses seen in other enveloped viruses, anti-S

157

IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), expressed on cell surface/viral envelope,

158

were strongly skewed towards low core fucosylation, while those against the nucleocapsid

159

protein (N), not expressed on cell surface/viral envelope, was characterized with high level

160

of fucose. Importantly, the afucosylated anti-S IgG-responses of patients with Acute

161

Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) hospitalized in intensive care units were significantly

162

lower than in convalescent plasma donors consisting of individuals who were asymptomatic

163

or had relative mild symptoms (non-ARDS) (Fig. 3A).

Figure 3: Fucosylation levels of anti-S IgG1, but not anti-N, are significantly decreased in

166

critically ill COVID-19 patients . A) Fucosylation was significantly lowered for ARDS patients

167

for anti-S, but not in non-ARDS donors naturally clearing the infection. Anti-N responses were

168

similar to total IgG. B) Galactosylation, was increased for both anti-N and anti-S in non-ARDS

169

donors as well as ARDS patients C) Sialylation shows similar pattens as galactosylation, and

170

D) Bisection was very low for both anti-N and anti-S in both patient groups. Statistical

171

analysis was performed as a one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test,

groups. Only statistically significant differences are shown. *= p<0.1, **= p<0.01, ***=

This lowered fucosylation of the anti-S was not a general issue of the inflammation as total

176

IgG-fucosylation levels were similar in the two groups and to what has been reported in the

177

general population (~94%) (11, 16). In addition, IgG galactosylation of both anti-S and anti-N

178

responses tended to be higher than seen in total IgG, compatible with increased

179

galactosylation observed in active or recent immunization (16, 22). However, IgG

180

galactosylation levels in general were lower in the ARDS patients, perhaps suggesting lower

181

capacity to clear the infection by reduced complement activity (23). This may be a reflection

182

of a slight age difference in these two groups (non-ARDS donors median 53±12,

183

ARDS patients 61±7.9), as galactose generally decreases slightly with advancing age (9, 19).

184

More importantly, the lowered fucosylation in the anti-S responses of the ARDS patients,

185

strongly suggest a pathological role through FcγRIIIa, similar to what was previously

186

proposed for Dengue (14). In Dengue, non-neutralizing antibodies formed to previous

187

infections of other Dengue serotypes, also tend to have low level of core-fucosylated IgG

188

and, as they are not capable of preventing infection, leading to aggravated Dengue-disease

189

due to FcγRIIIa-mediated overreactions by immune cells (14).

190
191

In conclusion, our results show a pattern of afucosylated IgG1 immune responses against

192

membrane-embedded antigens such as surface membrane proteins of allo-antigens on blood

193

cells or on enveloped viruses, in contrast to soluble protein antigens and non-enveloped

194

viruses for which immune responses with high levels of IgG1 fucosylation are consistently

195

observed. We hypothesize that antigen-presenting membranes are directly sensed by B cells

196

combining at least two signals provided by the B cell receptor and a yet unknown host

197

receptor-ligand pair, not occurring for soluble proteins, internal protein of enveloped viruses

198

or non-enveloped viruses(Fig. 4).

Fig. 4 Hypothetical model explaining how the context of antigen can lead to altered immune signaling, giving rise to altered IgG-glycosylation A) Immune response to soluble protein antigen: B-cell receptor (BCR, a membrane immunoglobulin) is activated, resulting in the
production of normal fucosylated antibodies. B) Immune response to allo-antigens: Paternal
allo-antigen on a Red Blood Cell (RBC) recognized by the BCR, and possibly by a yet unknown
immune regulatory receptor-ligand pair providing a signal for self. C) Immune response to
enveloped viral infection: Recognition of enveloped-virus infected cells by B cells is similar as
for cellular-alloantigen recognition. The initial recognition can potentially occur towards enveloped-virally infected cells and possibly after viral assembly (far right). The proposed signaling in b-c) causes altered glyco-programming of the B cells culminating in a unique IgGresponse characterized by a low fucosylation (fucose red triangle) and enhanced ADCC. The
model potentially explains both why immune response to soluble proteins, non-enveloped
viruses and cellular pathogens such as bacteria is different to responses to enveloped-viruses
and why immune responses to allo-antigens mimic that of an enveloped viral infection.

214
215

Alternatively, the differential recognition may be more complex and require additional

216

interactions from antigen-presenting cells, T cells and/or cytokines. Importantly, our studies

217

imply that a membrane context may be necessary but not always sufficient to trigger an

218

immune response with high levels of afucosylated IgG. (18). This translates into a vast spread

219

of afucosylation levels between individuals as well as for distinct responses of the same

220

individual against different antigens. The large difference in the level of antigen-specific

221

afucosylated responses observed between patients contributes to the variability of disease

222

severity, as has been shown for the neonatal alloimmune cytopenias (11, 12, 18), Dengue

223

(14) and now also for COVID-19. This underscores the significance for diagnosis of possible

224

disease trajectories and guides future treatments aimed at minimizing this FcγRIIIa-stimulus.

225

Importantly, when IgG afucosylation does occur, the final outcome, results in a potent

226

immune response, honed for destruction of targets cells by FcγRIIIa-expressing NK cells,

227

monocytes and macrophages but also FcγRIIIb-expressing granulocytes. This can be desired

228

in some responses such as against HIV (15), which can be achieved with available attenuated

229

enveloped viral vaccine shuttles (24) against difficult targets. On the other hand, this can also

230

lead to an undesired exaggerated response, as is apparent for both Dengue (14) and COVID-

231

19. This is exemplified in experiments in monkeys, where vaccination with Modified Vaccinia

232

Ankara virus ferrying spike proteins of SARS-CoV lead to strong ADE response (25) mimicking

233

pathologies in critically ill SARS-CoV2 patients (21). This suggests that a subunit protein

234

vaccine to be a safer option as seen in rat models for SARS-CoV2 (26), unless the vaccine also

235

induces a strong neutralizing effect.

236

For COVID-19, the data suggest that afucosylation of anti-S IgG may contribute to the

237

exacerbation of the disease in an subset of patient ending up in Intensive care units with

238

ARDS. Thus although they can be protective, they might potentially behave as double-edged

239

swords, and may contribute to the observed cytokine storm (27). As such this has direct

240

consequences for improving current therapies with IVIg, convalescent plasma and the route

241

taken towards vaccine development. In addition, the suggested role of afucosylated

242

antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 might open new opportunities for therapy of this

243

disease. Future attempts of generating high-titer COVID-19 immunoglobulin treatments,

244

should preferably use plasma enriched in fucosylated anti-COVID-19 antibodies. These may

245

outcompete afucosylated anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG-responses developing in the patients to avoid

246

symptom escalation and promote virus neutralization.

Materials and Methods:

249

Patient samples

250

Healthy blood donor samples from Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, were used to

251

analyze ParvoB19 (n=22), Measle virus (n=21 natural infection, n=24 Live Attenuated

252

vaccine), Mump virus (n=21 natural infection, n=24 Live Attenuated vaccine) and HBV

253

antibodies (n=17 natural infection, n=16 HBsAg vaccination). Anti-HPA-1a samples have been

254

described elsewhere (13). HIV-samples (n=80) from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV

255

infection and AIDS (ACS) were used to analyze HIV-specific antibody glycosylation. SARS-CoV2

256

patient samples from ICU patient from the Amsterdam UMC COVID study group were

257

included, as well as from Sanquin blood donors found positive. The ACS have been

258

conducted in accordance with the ethical principles set out in the declaration of Helsinki and

259

all participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Academic

260

Medical Center institutional Medical Ethics Committee of the University of Amsterdam.

261

Peripheral blood samples from patients with HPA-1a alloantibodies and CMV-specific

262

antibodies (n=62) were collected by the Finnish Red Cross Blood service, Platelet

263

Immunology Laboratory, Helsinki, Finland.

264
265

Purification of CMV-specific antibodies from sera

266

CMV-specific antibodies were purified using antigen-coated plates (Serion ELISA classic,

267

Cytomegalovirus IgG, Würzburg, Germany). Sera (20 µL) diluted in specimen diluent (80 µL)

268

from kit was incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C degrees. Positive and negative controls from the

269

kit and CMV-negative patients samples were used as controls. The plates were washed seven

270

times: three times with 300 µL wash-buffer from the kit, followed by two washed with the

271

same volume Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and deionized water. The bound antibodies

272

were then eluted using 100 µL of 100 mmol/l formic acid. No IgG was found in eluates from

273

blank wells and CMV-negative patients samples.

284

Purification of HBV-specific antibodies from sera

285

To isolate HBsAg specific antibodies from patients after infection and vaccination, HBs

286

antigen-coated plates (ETI-AB-AUK-3, Diasorin, Schiphol-Rijk, The Netherlands) were used.

287

Sera were diluted five times in specimen diluent from kit (20 µL serum with 80 µL diluent)

288

and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking 450 r.p.m. (Heidolph Titramax

289

100, Schwabach, Germany). HBV-naive and HBV-resolved samples from Sanquin, Amsterdam,

290

The Netherlands were used as controls. Washing and eluting specific antibodies was done as

291

described above for CMV-specific antibodies.

292
293

Purification of HIV-specific antibodies from sera

294

HIV-specific antibodies were isolated using HIV antigen-coated plates (Murex HIV1.2.0 kit

295

9E25-01, Diasorin, Schiphol-Rijk, The Netherlands). Sera were diluted two times in sample

296

diluent from kit (50 µL serum with 50 µL diluent) and incubated for 1 hour at room

297

temperature shaking 450 r.p.m. (Heidolph Titramax 100, Schwabach, Germany). As positive

298

control, anti-HIV gp120 monoclonal was used (IgG1 b12; 100 µg purified antibody in PBS at 1

301
302

Purification of ParvoB19-specific antibodies from sera

303

ParvoB19-specific antibodies were isolated using ParvoB19 antigen-coated plates

304

(Abcam1788650- Anti-Parvovirus B19 IgG ELISA, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Sera were

305

diluted five times in sample diluent from kit (20 µL serum with 80 µL diluent) and incubated

306

for 1 hour at room temperature shaking 450 r.p.m. (Heidolph Titramax 100). Positive and

307

negative controls from the kit were used as controls. Washing and eluting specific antibodies

308

was done as described above for CMV-specific antibodies.

309
310

Purification of anti-N and anti-S specific antibodies from plasma

311

SARS-Cov-2-specific antibodies were purified using antigen-coated plates (NUCN, Roskilde,

312

Denmark). Plates were coated (over-night, 4°C) with recombinant trimerized spike protein

313

produced as described recently (28) or N protein (accession number MN908947, produced in

314

HEK cells with HAVT20 leader peptide, 10xhis tag and a Brit tag as in (23)) in PBS(5 µg/mL

315

and 1 µg/mL, respectively). Plates were washed 3× with PBS supplemented with 0.05 %

316

TWEEN 20® (PBS-T) and plasma (20 µL) diluted in PBS-T (180 µL) was incubated on the

317

plates(1 hour, 37 °C, shaking). Sera dating pre COVID-19 pandemic were used as negative

318

controls. The plates were washed seven times: 3× with PBS-T, 2× with PBS and 2× with

319

ammonium bicarbonate (50mM). The bound antibodies were then eluted with formic acid

320

(100 mM, 5 min, shaking).

321

326

on the AssayMAP Bravo (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) Briefly, 1 µL serum diluted in

327

PBS were applied to the cartridges, followed by washes of PBS, LC-MS pure water and finally

328

eluted with formic acid (1%).

329
330

Mass spectrometric IgG-Fc glycosylation analysis

331

Eluates containing either antigen-specific antibodies or total IgG were collected in V-bottom

332

plates, dried by vacuum centrifugation for 2.5 hours at 50°C. The HPA1a, CMV, HIV, ParvoB19,

333

HBV, and COVID-19 samples were then subjected to proteolytic cleavage using trypsin as

334

described before (11). The measles and mumps cohort samples were dissolved in a buffer

335

containing 0.4% sodium deoxycholate(SDC), 10mM TCEP, 40mM chloroacetamide, 100 mM

336

TRIS pH8.5. After 10min incubation at 95C, 250 ng Trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate

337

was added. The digestion was stopped after an overnight incubation by acidifying to 2%

338

formic acid. Prior to MS injection, SDC precipitates were removed by centrifuging samples at

339

20 000 rcf for 30 minutes.

340

Analysis of IgG Fc-glycosylation was performed with nanoLC reverse phase (RP)-electrospray

341

(ESI)- MS on an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex/Thermo Scientific, Breda, The

342

Netherlands) coupled to an amaZon speed ion trap MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany)

343

(11) for all samples except for the Measles and mumps cohorts that were measured on a

344

Impact HD quadrupole-time-of-flight MS (Bruker Daltonics). (Glyco-)peptides were trapped

345

with 100% buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) and separated on a 15 min 0-25% buffer B

346

(95% acetonitrile, 5% water) linear gradient. In the current study we focused on IgG1,

347

without analyzing IgG3 due to its possible interference with IgG2 and IgG4 at the

348

glycopeptide level (29). Mass spectrometry results were extracted and evaluated using

349

FlexAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics) for all samples except for the Measles virus, and

350

Mumps virus cohorts that were analyzed with Skyline software. Data was judged reliable

351

when the sum of the signal intensities of all glycopeptide species (Table S1) was at least

352

higher than background plus 10 times its standard division, otherwise the data was excluded

(11). The total level of glycan traits was calculated as described in Table S2.

354
355

Statistical analysis

356

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.02 for Windows

357

(GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, www.graphpad.com). To analyze whether Fc-

358

fucosylation for total and antigen specific IgG differs between the tested cohorts, statistical

359

analysis was performed using t tests. To investigate whether Fc-fucosylation profiles of two

360

specific antibodies in the same individual are correlated statistical analysis was performed

361

using a Pearson correlation. The level of significance was set at P<0.05.

Fig. S1: IgG1-glycosylation for A) anti-HPA-1a, HIV, CMV and Parvo-B19 and B) anti-Measles
and Mumps (next page).
Shown are total IgG glycan traits (x-axis) vs the corresponding antigen-specific glycosylation on
the Y-Axis for Fucosylation, Galactosylation, Bisection and sialylation.

Fig. S1 continued
B)

Fig. S2. Antibody fucosylation is not determined by a general host factor. a.

No correlation was found between the level of IgG1 Fc-fucosylation made during alloimmunization against
HPA1a in pregnancy (y-axis) and CMV (x-axis) in the same individual. b. Also no correlation was found
between the level of IgG1 Fc-fucosylation made against HIV (y-axis) and CMV (x-axis) in the same individual.
Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation.

Fig. S3: Fucosylation of anti-Measles. Compared to total IgG fucosylation,
the antigen-specific IgG fucosylation, of anti-measle antibodies was only
significantly lowered in the younger vaccinated cohort (mean age 19.5). This is
likely to be masked by the natural tendency of lowered total IgG-fucosylation
with increasing age (9), as the naturally infected cohort (before introduction of
the MeV/MuV vaccination program in 1980s in the Netherlands) is older than
the vaccine cohort (average 63.5 vs 19.5 years, respectively). In line with this,
the total IgG fucosylation of the older cohort showed significantly lowered totalIgG fucosylation compared to the younger vaccinated cohort / Statistical
analysis was performed as paired t-test for A,B, and C and as a one-way
ANOVA Sidak’s multiple comparisons test comparing total IgG to antigenspecific IgG within groups, and same specificity IgG between groups, for D and
E. Only statistically significant differences are shown. (*= p<0.1 )
