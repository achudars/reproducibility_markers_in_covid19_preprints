ABSTRACT
Recently published transcriptomic data of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus show that there is a
large variation in the frequency and steady state levels of subgenomic mRNA sequences. This
variation is derived from discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis where the polymerase
switches template from a 3’ proximal genome body sequence to a 5’ untranslated leader
sequence. This leads to a fusion between the common 5’ leader sequence and a 3’ proximal
body sequence in the RNA product. This process revolves around a common core sequence
(CS) that is present at both the template sites that make up the fusion junction. Base-pairing
between the leader CS and the nascent complementary minus strand body CS, and flanking
regions (together called the transcription regulating sequence, TRS) is vital for this template
switching event. However, various factors can influence the site of template switching within
the same TRS duplex. Here, we model the duplexes formed between the leader and
complementary body TRS regions, hypothesising the role of the stability of the TRS duplex in
determining the major sites of template switching for the most abundant mRNAs. We indicate
that the stability of secondary structures and the speed of transcription play key roles in
determining the probability of template switching in the production of subgenomic RNAs.

KEYWORDS: SARS-CoV-2, RNA structure, TRS, template-switching, duplex
INTRODUCTION
The human coronaviruses include a diversity of viruses that cause diseases such as the
common cold as well as those resulting in epidemics and pandemics, such as the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. They belong to the family Coronaviridae in the
order Nidovirales

1,2

. Coronavirus genomes consist of a positive sense single stranded RNA

molecule of approximately 30 kb in length. They share a common architecture that includes
highly structured 5’ and 3’ terminal untranslated regions (UTRs) flanking two overlapping nonstructural polyprotein encoding open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1a, ORF1b). 1a/1b
comprises the 5’ two-thirds of the intervening sequence and the remaining one-third of the
genome encodes structural and accessory proteins. The structural proteins include the spike
protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). The six
accessory proteins present in SARS-CoV-2 include 3a, 6,7a,7b, 8 and, putatively, 10 3.
The replication of the genome and the production of mRNAs for translation are intimately
linked processes. They both require RNA-dependent RNA synthesis, beginning with the
synthesis of a negative sense strand from the incoming positive sense genome by the virusencoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This begins at the 3’ terminus of the positive
strand and moves in the (negative sense) 5’ – 3’ direction 4. Full length and truncated negative
strands are then used as templates to amplify positive strand RNAs. The full genome length
RNA (gRNA), containing ORF1a and ORF1b, is used for translation and/or packaging, while
smaller positive strand subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), encoding structural and accessory
proteins, are primarily destined for translation 4,5. In SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, there are nine
canonical positive sense sgRNAs that are produced in addition to the gRNA, each identified
by the product of their 5’-terminal open reading frame – S, 3a, E, M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and N.
The canonical sgRNAs are produced through a process called discontinuous transcription,
conserved in both arteriviruses and coronaviruses 6. These positive strand mRNAs contain a
common 5’ leader sequence (70 - 100 nt) derived from the 5’ terminus of the positive strand
genome 7. During canonical discontinuous transcription, chimeric mRNA molecules are
produced each consisting of an identical segment of the leader sequence fused with one of
several non-contiguous regions in the body of the genome found 5’ of each ORF. Pseudocircularisation of the genome by unknown viral and/or cellular factors brings together
transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) found in the leader (TRS-L, 5’) and at the 5’ end of
the body sequence (TRS-B, 3’) 1. The TRS includes a conserved core sequence (CS) of 6-7
nt common to both the TRS-L and the TRS-B 8; in SARS-CoV-2 this is ACGAAC. Thus, a

duplex is formed between the CS-L and the complementary CS-B (cCS-B) in the nascent
negative strand leading to a switch in the polymerase template from the body sequence to the
5’ leader sequence. If this does not occur, the polymerase progresses until it either encounters
a subsequent TRS and makes a template switch to the 5’ positive strand leader or completes
the full antigenomic strand (van Marle et al. 1999; Pasternak et al. 2001; Zúñiga et al. 2004).
The 5’ UTR consists of a series of stem-loops (SL), not all of which are conserved between
different coronaviruses. SL1 and SL2 are highly conserved and are required for genome
replication and possibly RNA production 12–14. The SL3 stem-loop, present in SARS-CoV-2, is
not universally conserved but this region contains sequences important for transcription in all
coronaviruses 15. Downstream of this is a conserved SL4 hairpin that may be responsible for
orientating the SL1, SL2 and SL3 regions during transcription 16. The 5’ UTR ends with a large
SL5 stem-loop consisting of a 4-way junction. It is common to many SARS-related viruses and
contains of the ORF1ab start codon. It has been proposed to function as a packaging signal
17

.

The role of the various conserved stem-loops of the 5’ UTR in discontinuous transcription is
unclear. SL1, SL2 and SL4 show functional conservation between viruses; swapping them
between related coronaviruses yields viable chimeric viruses unless the TRS is also replaced
14,18,19

. In mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), mutational analyses showed that neither the sequence

nor structure of SL4 is vital for viral replication. However, deletion of SL4 was found to inhibit
sgRNA production 14,16. Experiments involving mutation or deletion of part of, or the complete
stem-loop suggest that the structural features of these stem-loops are more important than
their nucleotide sequence 1,19. However, their exact function remains unclear.
Recent modelling informed by RNA structure probing generated a single nucleotide resolution
map of the secondary structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This predicted a high degree of
structure compared to other positive sense RNA viral genomes such as those of HIV-1 and
ZIKV

20

and even more structure than the related viruses, MERS and SARS-CoV

21

. The

probing confirmed that an estimated 38.6% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is structured with
around 8% of the structures exhibiting significant covariance with other coronaviruses,
implying that these structures are conserved between the different viruses and thus of
functional importance (Manfredonia et al. 2020). These experiments confirmed structure and
sequence conservation in the SL1-SL4 stem-loops between many coronaviruses. Unlike the
corresponding structure of some other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 ACGAAC CS-L is
found in the SL3 stem-loop with part of the sequence exposed in an apical loop. A similar
architecture has been described in some other coronaviruses where the CS is also found in a
stem-loop 17,20,23.

The stability of the TRS duplex is a key determinant of the occurrence of and rates of template
switching. Mutations in the TRS-L of Equine arteritis virus (EAV) exposed new sites of
complementarity in the genome leading to the production of novel minor sgRNAs

24

.

Furthermore, changing the level of complementarity by mutating the TRS-L or changing the
length of the complementary TRS-flanking regions led to a higher or lower incidence of
template switching depending on whether the stability of the duplex formed between the TRSL in the positive strand and the complementary sequence in the nascent negative strand is
increased or decreased respectively 24.
If the canonical TRS-L is mutated, alternate cryptic TRSs, downstream of the site of the
canonical TRS and upstream of the initiation codon, can be recruited which allow production
of sufficient amounts of sgRNAs to yield infectious progeny virus albeit at a reduced titer

25

.

By contrast, the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome contains a second
canonical CS (CS-2) in its S gene that does not initiate discontinuous transcription and the
production of detectable levels of mRNA. Base pairing between the CS-2 and complementary
leader sequence alone is seemingly not sufficient to cause template switching. In many cases,
base pairing of adjacent nucleotides flanking the CS is vital for polymerase strand transfer.
This phenomenon is genome position-independent 26 and lends credence to a model in which
template switching is primarily determined by the overall free energy of the duplex formed and
not specifically defined by the core sequence or by its location in the genome.
Transcriptomic analysis of members of the order Nidovirales has identified multiple noncanonical fusion events resulting in additional sgRNAs to those produced by template
switching at cTRS-B/TRS-L sequences. Some of these lead to translation products derived
from alternative open reading frames identified by mass spectrometry and ribosome profiling
27

. Recent transcriptomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed that in addition to the canonical

TRS-mediated leader-body fusion events, which account for ~93% of the transcripts,
recombination events also occur between regions where only one or neither of the two TRSs
is present. Moreover, there were a variety of leader-body junction sequences associated with
each canonical ORF, suggesting that there are additional factors that govern template
switching 3. Here, we use published transcriptomic data to model the cTRS-L:TRS-B duplex
structures proposed by the discontinuous transcription model and use this to infer how duplex
formation and secondary structure determine the probability of template switching.

METHODS
The leader-body junction sequences were extracted from the supplementary data provided in
Kim et al. (2020). Since all the template switching events that occurred within the duplex or
immediately after duplexes would produce identical fusion junctions, the region of possible
template switching was identified and a sequence was constructed in silico containing 94
nucleotides of the 5’ UTR (uppercase), a 10 nt ‘spacer’ that is forced to be single-stranded
and a nascent negative strand sequence (uppercase) of varying lengths ending at the last
possible site of the template switching or up to 6 nucleotides after this position (Supplementary
figure 1). Then, RNA secondary structure was modelled using the RNAstructure software
Summarised structures were drawn using the XRNA software

were marked using information provided by Kim et al. (2020).
RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomic data published by Kim et al., (2020) showed that the most
abundant sgRNAs derive from fusion events involving both the TRS-L and one or other TRSB sequence. The top 24 sgRNAs analysed in this paper comprise those products of
discontinuous transcription that are above 0.01% of the total transcripts and are mostly derived
from a TRS-L:cTRS-B fusion event. Despite sharing common core sequences, there are large
differences in the abundance of the individual sgRNAs. The reasons for this are not obvious
but point to there being multiple factors controlling the rates of template switching and the
quantity of individual sgRNAs generated. Moreover, multiple different variants of the same
sgRNA were found that had utilised different sites of template switching. Examining the relative
abundance of the canonical and non-canonical sgRNAs, of the nine canonical sgRNAs (S, 3a,
E, M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, N), ORF7b is fourteenth in the order of most abundant sgRNAs produced
(Fig. 1). By contrast four different versions of the sgRNA encoding the nucleocapsid (N)
protein appear before the most abundant ORF7b sgRNA. Plausibly this may be due to the
non-canonical core sequence (AAGAAC) that occurs in the ORF7b TRS-B. There are also
non-canonical sgRNAs that are produced where the body junction is found within the ORF1ab
open reading frame (labelled ORF1ab, producing a putative 28 aa N-terminal peptide) or within
the N open reading frame (labelled N*, producing a putative 103 aa peptide) (Fig 1).
The TRS duplex determines the site of template switching
To determine the effect of the TRS duplex formation upon the incidence of template switching,
we modelled the RNA structures formed between cTRS-L and TRS-B and surrounding
sequences and compared these with junctional sequences and the abundance of transcripts
determined by Kim et al. (2020). The abundance is a measure of the steady state levels of the
RNA species rather than a direct measure of nascent transcript production. Therefore, the

abundance would represent a minimum steady state level of the sgRNA species. We modelled
duplex structures of the 5’ leader sequence (up to 94 nts) which includes SL1-SL3 and a small
section of SL4, and the nascent negative strand sequence with varying lengths of nucleotides
before and after the cCS-B, beyond the site of complementarity, and compared these to the
transcript abundance. We do not show structures associated with TRS-L/cTRS-B-independent
fusion events. We also modelled body sequences of different lengths, up to 6 nucleotides
beyond the cCS, to simulate the structures that may be formed when the polymerase has
produced a longer nascent negative strand. In some cases, changing the length of the
nucleotide sequence modifies the RNA secondary structure. In these cases, we have depicted
them separately.
By comparing the duplex structures to junctional sequences between the 5’ leader and the
cTRSs in the body of the nascent negative strand, we observe that in the most abundant
sgRNAs, a majority of template switching appears to occur within or immediately after the last
base-paired nucleotide in the CS-L:cCS-B duplex (i.e. 5’ of the duplex on the +strand) or 1-2
nucleotides after the duplex (less commonly). Due to the shared core sequence at the CS-L
and the CS-B, in most cases, the junctional sequence products of template switching events
that have occurred within the duplex or immediately after, look identical. All of these events
have been depicted with a single arrow at the last possible site of template switching. Template
switching was also found in bulges or at weak G-U base pairs. This is seen for the most
abundant sgRNAs for S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and N (Figs. 2, 3, 4). All the
duplexes shown are more stable (lower Gibbs free energy) than the structure where the
template switch-causing duplex is not formed. The exception is the ORF6 duplex which
showed the same free energy of secondary structure formation for the structure with the
duplex as the structure without the template switch-causing duplex where the cCS-B is
sequestered in a weak stem-loop (Fig. 2). This may explain why this sgRNA is the 8th most
abundant sgRNA.
The second most abundant ORF7a sgRNA which accounts for 0.09% of total transcripts is
produced from a template switching event occurring after a bulge and a second duplex beyond
the primary CS-L:cCS-B duplex (Fig. 2). This is also seen in the lower abundance N sgRNAs
(0.03% and 0.06% abundance) where template switching occurs after the site of a onenucleotide bulge (Fig. 3). It may be that in some cases a small bulge is disregarded during
template switching if it is followed by another duplex, perhaps indicating the coaxial stacking
of those helices on either side of a single nucleotide bulge 30.

Speed of transcription affects duplex formation
Of the 23 sgRNAs studied, six of them are N sgRNAs (68.05%, 0.37%, 0.13%, 0.10%, 0.06%
and 0.03% abundance). This may be due to its 3’ terminal position in the genome making it
the first TRS-B sequence that the polymerase encounters or may be a function of sequence
composition or both. The second most abundant alternate N sgRNA (0.37%) is not formed
from the canonical CS-L:cCS-B duplex (Fig. 3, left hand panel). The TRS-B for the N sgRNA
is found within a 5’ACNAACNAAC3’ sequence where the CS-L can base pair with the
complement of both ACNAAC sections. Topologically, the cCS-B is the second CS to be
produced in the nascent negative strand. However, unlike the alternate cCS-B which relies on
a G-U base pairing for duplex formation, the duplex formed with a longer nascent -ve strand
and the canonical cCS-B is predicted to be more stable and thus leads to a higher incidence
of template switching (Fig. 3, right hand panel). The availability of multiple template switching
points, all producing the same N ORF, indicates a viral strategy favouring N sgRNA synthesis
and contributing consequently to making the nucleocapsid protein the most abundantly
expressed protein in infected cells 31.
The length of the nascent negative transcript is closely related to the speed of polymerase
progression. A slower polymerase would allow more time for a duplex to be produced earlier
in the nascent transcript. AU-rich regions have been previously described to promote more
efficient recombination and template switching than GC-rich sequences in unrelated RNA
dependent RNA polymerases in plant viruses 32. One of the SARS-CoV-2 N sgRNAs (0.10%)
is unusual in that it is created from a template switching event that occurs even before the
core sequence (Fig. 3, right hand panel). This occurs after a stretch of As and Us,
homopolymeric runs of which are known to be associated with frequent polymerase pausing
and dissociation and thus will favour template switching events 33.
The effect of the polymerase processivity and the length of the nascent strand on template
switching is also evident in simulations of the formation of the M and E sgRNAs. If a nascent
transcript is produced that ends with the M cCS-B, the cCS-B is partly sequestered in a stemloop that is more stable than a duplex with the CS-L. However, if a longer transcript is
produced, a duplex is formed between the CS-L and cCS-B which leads to template switching
(Fig. 4A). Conversely, a shorter nascent transcript that ends closer to the cCS-B in the E
sgRNA is more likely to lead to the CS-L:cCS-B duplex that results in template switching, than
a longer transcript where the cCS-B is partly sequestered in a stem-loop. This sequestration
of the cCS-B in the stem-loop may also prevent the inhibition of downstream duplex formation.

The non-canonical ORF7b CS-B prevents frequent template switching
Of the four ORF7b sgRNAs shown, the sgRNAs are predicted to produce 20 (0.08%), 4
(0.06%), 43 (0.04%) and 43 (0.02%) amino acid peptides (in order of decreasing transcript
abundance). The least abundant 43 aa ORF7b-producing sgRNA (0.02%) is not produced
from a CS-L:cCS-B mediated fusion event, but rather from within the body of the genome
further upstream from the ORF7b CS-B. It is not yet clear if these RNAs are translated as the
presence of the two shorter translation products has not been experimentally confirmed.
Of the 24 most abundant RNAs produced from the viral genome, only two sgRNAs (with a
total abundance of 0.056%) encode the full ORF7b 43 aa protein. Of all the RNA species
detected in the Kim et al. (2020) paper, 0.085% encode the full protein. The low abundance
of these RNA species is caused by a proposed non-canonical CS-B 5’AACAAG3’ which does
not produce a complement that is able to form a perfect duplex with the 5’ACGAAC3’ CS-L.
When recombination does occur the most common site of template switching within the CSL, while the other frequent event occurs immediately after the cCS-B. However, in both cases,
template switching still occurs immediately after one or to two nucleotides after a duplex, as
is observed with the other sgRNAs. The low levels of ORF7b coding sgRNAs may have
evolved to reduce dosage of the protein. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV, ORF7b, which may be
a viral structural protein, is translated by an inefficient mechanism of leaky ribosomal scanning
possibly with the same consequence of limiting its quantity 34.

DISCUSSION
The abundance of sgRNA species and thus the translational expression of the virally encoded
proteins is controlled by TRS-mediated duplex formation. Structural modelling of the duplex
formed between the SARS-CoV-2 negative strand nascent transcript and the positive strand
leader sequence identified stable structures. Here we show that the site of template switching
correlates with the length and stability of the duplex. In most cases, the polymerase probably
switches templates from within the CS-L:cCS-B duplex up to 1-2 nucleotides after the duplex.
Since the chimeric RNA created from a template switching event that occurs within the
complementary duplex sequence would look identical regardless of where the template
switching event occurs within the duplex, it would be difficult to conclude that all the modelled
template switching events happen after the duplex. Indeed, 0.10% of all sgRNAs are produced
from template switching that occurs even before the CS-L:cCS-B duplex in the case for the
second most abundant N sgRNA. In the case of the alternate N sgRNA that is produced from
a non-canonical duplex, the presence of a G-U base pair in the duplex indicates that the
template switching event must occur after this point (Fig 3). Since different lengths of nascent

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.416818; this version posted December 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this

RNAs can sequester the cTRS-B in a structure, thus preventing contact between the leader
and body sequences, a minimum length and stability of duplex dependent on the sequence
composition would be required.
In the case of the N sgRNA, multiple highly abundant RNA products are produced from
different template switching events (Fig 3). This may be due to its proximity to the 3’ end of
the genome. However, this positional argument is not substantiated by the high abundance of
other sgRNAs which are not also relatively 3’ proximal. Alternatively, the presence of an
alternate duplex conformation increases the likelihood of template switching and nucleocapsid
production. The high abundance of nucleocapsid protein enables multiple RNA contact points,
which may not only protect the RNA from innate immune recognition, but also encourage
oligomerisation and genome encapsidation

35,36

. This is caused by the recruitment of DDX1

helicase mediated by N that enables progression of the polymerase to the 5’ end of the
genome 37. Thus, increased nucleocapsid production would not only be involved in a positive
feedback loop regulating discontinuous transcription and further nucleocapsid production, but
also, as a packaging protein, this could allow temporal control of when the gRNA is prioritised
for packaging over transcription. Contrasting with this, the absence of a canonical core
sequence at the 5’ terminus of ORF7b prevents the formation of strong duplexes and thus
produces low levels of ORF7b encoding sgRNA. Alternatively, more abundant ORF7b
sgRNAs produced at the associated duplex could produce other as yet unidentified translation
products from alternate ORFs 3.
Template switching seems to be controlled by the length of the nascent negative transcript.
This could be due to the sequestration of the cTRS-B in their own stem-loops. Structure
modelling of the positive strand also revealed that most TRS-B sequences are found in
secondary structures 20. Recent DMS-MaPseq of the SARS-CoV-2 positive strand RNA in the
cell showed that, except for the TRS-B for ORF7a and ORF7b, all the TRS-Bs were found
completely or partially enclosed in secondary structures 38. Four of these TRSs were found to
be highly stable 21. From the modelling data presented here, we see the formation of cTRS-B
stem-loops in the negative strand which reflect the structures observed in the positive strand
(Fig 4).
We posit that such a mechanism has three roles. Firstly, the melting of the structures required
for RNA synthesis slows down the approaching polymerase on the template. It has been
shown that structures and composition of the template, such as the presence of
homopolymeric runs of nucleotides, particularly adenosines, sequences as seen in the N
duplex,

dissociation/reattachment of the polymerase would allow further opportunities for duplex
formation between the cTRS-B and TRS-L.
Secondly, the formation of the structures prevents the inhibition of downstream TRS-Bs. It has
previously been reported that, in the event of two closely positioned TRSs, the downstream
TRS may inhibit the upstream TRS but not vice versa 39,40. We postulate that the reformation
of secondary structures in the nascent negative strand prevents inappropriate TRS-L:cTRS-B
duplex formation and allows the polymerase to progress to the site of the next TRS-B. This
process of unwinding and reformation of secondary structures before and after the polymerase
would be vital again during RNA-dependent RNA synthesis of the positive strand.
Thirdly, the chances of triggering the cellular dsRNA detection mechanisms are reduced.
Virally encoded nsp13 helicase unwinds the dsRNA duplexes produced during replication or
transcription

41

. We speculate that the formation of secondary structures on the unwound

nascent negative strand in cis may prevent the reformation of long dsRNA between the
template and the nascent strand and may thus provide an additional mechanism by which the
virus avoids dsRNA-triggered host cell responses.
We conclude that the strength and stability of secondary structures during nascent RNA
negative strand synthesis at the site of the TRS-B provides a plausible explanation for
regulation of numerous mechanisms involved in discontinuous transcription including the site
of template switching. Experimental studies will be required to confirm these conclusions.
Interfering with structures formed during discontinuous transcription may serve as potential
RNA targets for therapeutic intervention.
