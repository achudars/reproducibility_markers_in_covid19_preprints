ABSTRACT

20

Spain is one of the countries that has suffered the most from the impact of severe acute

21

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the strain that causes coronavirus disease

22

2019 (COVID-19). However, there is a lack of information on the characteristics of this disease in

23

the Spanish population. The objective of this study has been to characterize our patients from

24

an epidemiological point of view and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in our

25

geographical area. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study on 188 hospitalized cases of

26

SARS-Cov-2 infection in Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, in Reus, Spain, admitted between

27

15th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. We recorded demographic data, signs and symptoms and

28

comorbidities. We also calculated the Charlson and McCabe indices. A total of 43 deaths

29

occurred during the study period. Deceased patients were older than the survivors (77.7 ± 13.1

30

vs. 62.8 ± 18.4 years; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that fever, pneumonia,

31

acute respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes mellitus and cancer were the variables that

32

showed independent and statistically significant associations with mortality. The Charlson index

33

was more efficient than the McCabe index in discriminating between deceased and survivors.

34

This is one of the first studies to describe the factors associated with mortality in patients

35

infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain, and one of the few in the Mediterranean area. We identified

36

the main factors independently associated with mortality in our population. Further studies in

37

are needed to complete and confirm our findings.

Introduction
42

In January 2020, a new type of coronavirus was identified as the causative factor in a series of

43

cases of severe pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, province of Hubei, in the People's Republic of

44

China [1]. The World Health Organization gave the official name 'COVID-19' for this coronavirus

45

disease, as well as the term 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2) for

46

the virus [2]. This virus is currently the cause of a global pandemic, producing hundreds of

47

thousands of hospital admissions and deaths, with enormous effects on the health and life of

48

the population and serious economic consequences for society. On 1st February, 2020, the first

49

case of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient in Spain was reported on the island of La Gomera [3] and,

50

following that, the first cases diagnosed in the autonomous region of Catalonia date from 5th

51

March [4]. The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 5 to 6 days on average, with cases

52

being possible from 0 to 14 days [5]. The most common period of transmission of the virus

53

begins 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms, and lasts for up to 5-6 days after the onset of

54

symptoms [6]. The basic reproductive rate R (the average of new cases secondary to a primary

55

case) in our country is, at the time of writing, estimated to be <1; globally, the R number ranges

56

from 0 to 6 depending on various factors, in particular the political and public health measures

57

imposed by the various governments that focus on complete cleaning of public spaces and a

58

decrease in contact between individuals [7]. Identifying the epidemiological characteristics of

59

this disease will help appropriate decisions to be made and thus to control the epidemic. Certain

clinical symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported previously. The most frequent are: fever, dry

61

cough, asthenia, expectoration, dyspnea, sore throat, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills,

62

nausea or vomiting, nasal congestion, diarrhea, hemoptysis and conjunctival congestion (from

63

highest to lowest frequency) [8,9]. Occasionally, symptoms of a different nature appear:

64

neurological, such as altered consciousness or dizziness; cardiological, such as acute myocardial

65

damage or heart failure; or ophthalmological, such as dry eye, blurred vision, foreign body

66

sensation and conjunctival congestion [10-13].

67

To date, there is still a lack of information on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection

68

outside China. Spain is one of the Western European countries that has suffered

69

the most from the impact of COVID-19 and this pandemic has had a great impact on our public

70

health system. The present study reports the results of an analysis of all cases hospitalized in

71

the Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan, which is affiliated to the Universitat Rovira i Virgili, in

72

Reus, Catalonia, Spain. The objective of the present study has been to characterize our patients'

73

epidemiology and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality for this disease in our

74

geographical area.

Study design

77

This is a prospective longitudinal study conducted on all hospitalized cases of SARS-CoV-2

health care and is part of the Hospital Network for Public Use in Catalonia. It acts as a general

81

hospital for a population of over 175,000 inhabitants, including primary care centers and

82

residences for the elderly in the area. It is a reference center for the specialities of Oncology and

83

Radiotherapy for the whole of the Tarragona province, which has a population of 550,000

84

inhabitants. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain

85

reaction (RT-PCR) using swab samples from the upper respiratory tract

86

(nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal exudate), from the lower respiratory tract

87

(sputum/endotracheal aspirate/bronchoalveolar lavage/bronchial aspirate) or from the lower

88

digestive tract (rectal smear). Tests were carried out with the VIASURE SARS-CoV-2 Real Time

89

PCR Detection Kit that detects ORF1ab and N genes (CerTest Biotec, Zaragoza, Spain). RNA was

90

extracted in a QIAcube apparatus with RNeasy reagents (Qiagen N.V., Hilden, Germany)

91

according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and analyses were carried out in a 7500 Fast RT-

92

PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,USA). We recorded demographic data,

93

comorbidities, and other acute or chronic infections. We also calculated the McCabe score as an

94

index of clinical prognosis [14] and the Charlson index (abbreviated version) as a way of

95

categorizing a patient's comorbidity [15]. The only inclusion criterion was to be a hospitalized

96

patient with an analytical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. We excluded hospitalized patients with

97

suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection but without laboratory confirmation, or patients who did not

98

require hospitalization, with or without laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirty-

99

four patients required transfer to the Intensive Care Unit based on the attending specialist's

criteria, and taking into account the CURB65 scale and the ATS/IDSA criteria [16,17]. This study

101

was approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institution (Resolution CEIM 040/2018, amended

102

on 16 April 2020).

103

Statistical analyses

104

Data are shown as means and standard deviations or as numbers and percentages. Statistical

105

comparisons between two groups were carried out with the Student’s t test (quantitative

106

variables) or the χ-square test (categorical variables). Logistic regression models were fitted to

107

investigate the combined effect of selected variables on mortality. The diagnostic accuracy of

108

the McCabe and Charlson indices in predicting mortality was assessed by receiver operating

109

characteristics (ROC) analysis [18]. Statistical significance was set at p ≤0.05. All calculations

110

were made using the SPSS 25.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

111

Results

112

During the study period, a total of 188 patients were hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The

113

mean age was 66.4 ± 18.4 years (Range: 0 - 102) and a small majority were men (55.8 vs. 44.2%;

114

p < 0.001). One hundred and eighteen patients were admitted to the Department of Internal

115

Medicine, 34 to the Intensive Care Unit, and 36 to the Social Health Unit. Thirty-two patients

116

were admitted to hospital due to causes unrelated to the suspicion of COVID-19 infection but

117

gave a positive result in the RT-PCR. A total of 43 deaths occurred during the entire study period

118

(Fig. 1), so the case fatality rate was 22.9% based on the total number of COVID-19 hospitalized

119

patients. Deceased patients were significantly older than the survivor patients (77.7 ± 13.1 vs.

62.8 ± 18.4 years; p < 0.001). A total of 125 patients (66.5%) had chronic underlying diseases.

121

The relationships between COVID-19 and the demographic and clinical variables are shown in

122

Table 1 and Fig. 2. Most of the cases and deaths were of patients between 70 and 89 years old

123

(Fig. 2A). The signs and symptoms present in more than 50% of the patients were, in descending

124

order, fever (64.9%), dyspnea (58.0%), pneumonia (57.4%), and cough (51.6%) (Fig. 2B). The

125

most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases (50.5%), type 2 diabetes mellitus

126

(26.0%), and chronic neurological diseases (19.1%) (Fig. 2C). We also evaluated whether

127

patients had had any behaviour that might be considered risky in the days prior to admission,

128

and we observed that a high proportion of patients had attended another health center in the

129

previous month or had been in contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or with

130

respiratory problems over the previous 14 days (Fig. 2F). Five employees of our institution or

131

the associated residences were hospitalized for COVID-19, although not requiring either

132

intensive measures or ventilatory support.

133

Most of the patients presented low values on the Charlson and McCabe indices and, as

134

expected, higher scores were associated with higher mortality (Fig. 2 D and E). When comparing

135

the diagnostic accuracy of the ROC curves of these indices in their ability to discriminate

136

between deceased patients and survivors, we found that Charlson index was more efficient,

137

with higher values of the area under the curve (Fig. 3).

138
139

Finally, since the different symptoms and comorbidities can be mutually interdependent
and present cause-effect relationships between them, we wanted to identify which factors were

140

independently associated with mortality. Logistic regression analyses showed that the presence

141

of fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer

142

were the only variables that showed an independent and statistically significant association with

143

mortality when they were adjusted for differences in age, gender, smoking status and alcohol

144

intake (Tables 2 and 3) .

145

Discussion

146

We carried out a RT-PCR determination for all the patients admitted to our center, regardless of

147

the diagnosis. Thirty-two patients (17.0%) admitted for reasons other than suspected SARS-CoV-

148

2 infection gave a positive result despite not presenting any symptoms. We believe that this is

149

important since it highlights the need to perform diagnostic tests for this disease in all

150

hospitalized patients, something which has not been given sufficient attention in the scientific

151

literature.

152

Most of our patients were over 60 years old and mortality was very high (47.0%) among

153

those over 80 years old. These results are consistent with those published so far, which show

154

that age is one of the most important risk factors for COVID-19 [19-22]. It is accepted that age is

155

a risk factor for respiratory diseases [19,23,24] and impairment of immune function associated

156

with age has been identified as a major cause of high mortality due to severe pneumonia [23].

157

Among the signs and symptoms of the disease, we found that fever, pneumonia, and acute

158

respiratory distress syndrome were the only factors independently associated with mortality

159

when adjusted for age, smoking and alcohol intake. These factors are among those that have

160

been most frequently found in patients with COVID-19 in most of the studies conducted in

161

China [19,25,26]. We did not observe any independent relationship between cough, chills or

162

gastrointestinal disturbances and mortality, despite being present in a relatively high proportion

163

of subjects, something which differs from what has been published previously [19].

164

The comorbidities showing a significant relationship with mortality were type 2 diabetes

165

mellitus and cancer. We did not find any independent association with any other chronic

166

metabolic disease, such as cardiovascular disease or others. The univariate analysis showed a

167

high number of patients with these chronic alterations and the logistic regression analysis

168

identified diabetes as the most relevant. Indeed, all of these metabolic diseases are closely

169

related. Diabetes is a causative factor of hypertension and metabolic syndrome and these, in

170

turn, can cause heart, vascular, liver, neurological and kidney diseases. Our study therefore

171

suggests that diabetes might be a triggering factor for these disorders and therefore is related

172

to mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has also been

173

reported to be one of the most important factors related with COVID-19 severity in previous

174

investigations conducted in China, Israel and Italy [25,27-29]. Indeed, the Italian study reported

175

that 2/3 of the patients who died were diabetic [29]. Furthermore, diabetes is linked to a higher

176

mortality in other viral infections, such as those caused by influenza A(H1N1), MERS-CoV and

177

SARS-CoV viruses [30,31]. We also found a close relationship between cancer and COVID-19

178

mortality. One aspect that caught our attention is that, despite our hospital being the reference

179

center for Oncology in our province, the number of cancer patients infected with COVID-19 was

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.122986; this version posted May 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

10
180

relatively low. It might be that the corticosteroids often prescribed for the treatment of these

181

patients offered some protection, as some studies have suggested [32] or perhaps these

182

patients were more careful than the general population during confinement, which

183

unfortunately cannot be proven. Having said that, the relationship between cancer and the

184

mortality of our patients was evident. Patients with cancer are often immunosuppressed and as

185

a result they are more likely to worsen rapidly if infected by SARS-Cov-2. Wuhan studies report

186

that the incidence of cancer is higher in COVID-19 patients than in the general population

187

[33,34]. However, definitive conclusions on this issue are hampered by the small sample size,

188

the retrospective nature of most studies, the limited follow-up duration, and the heterogeneity

189

of the disease and treatment strategies [35,36].

190

The influence of smoking on COVID-19 is controversial. An unusually low prevalence of

191

current smoking among infected patients was observed in China [37] and the plausibility of

192

using medicinal nicotine to lower infection and mitigate disease severity has been proposed

193

[38]. However, other studies indicate that smokers might be at higher risk because nicotine can

194

directly impact the putative receptor for the virus (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and lead

195

to harmful signaling in lung epithelial cells [39]. In the present study, we have found no firm

196

positive or negative relationship between tobacco use and mortality because only 9 patients

197

(4.8%) were active smokers at the time of the study. That might be explained by their generally

198

advanced age and because many of them were suffering from chronic ailments that had advised

199

them to quit tobacco use.

11
200

A novel aspect of our study has been to investigate the usefulness of some frequently

201

used clinical scores in the evaluation of infectious diseases. For example, the Charlson index,

202

which categorizes comorbidity might be more useful than the McCabe index in predicting death

203

in these patients. A limitation of the present study is the small sample size. Ours is not a big

204

hospital and covers a relatively small geographical area. However, we believe that the results

205

obtained are relevant since they might be representative of many similar centers in Western

206

Europe and in the Mediterranean area, and little information is yet available on this issue.

207

Conclusion

208

This is one of the first studies to describe the factors related with death in patients infected with

209

SARS-CoV-2 in Spain, and one of the few from the Mediterranean basin. Our results identify age,

210

fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer as

211

independent factors predicting lethality. Further studies are needed in similar centers to

212

complete and confirm our findings.
