Abstract
2019-nCoV, which is a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019,
has caused at least infected 11,844 as of Feb 1, 2020. However, there is no specific antiviral
treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would
use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a
novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the
Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity
was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion
proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and
2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins
potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit
cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis,
prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV.

2019-nCoV, which is a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of
2019, has caused at least infected 11,844 as of Feb 1, 2020. However, there is no specific
antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses, including the
coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the 2019-nCoV,
associate with cellular receptors to mediate infection of their target cells.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a carboxypeptidase that potently degrades
angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7, has been identified as a functional receptor for
SARS-CoV1 and a potent receptor for 2019-nCoV2. This metallopeptidase is also playing
key role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)3.
As ACE2 is a key player in the hormonal cascades that plays a central role in the
homeostatic control of cardiorenal actions, earlier researchers had exerted effect on the
pharmacodynamics studies of recombinant ACE2 (rACE2) to protect against severe acute
lung injury and acute Ang II-induced hypertension4-6. In mice models, administration of
rACE2 also showed to adverse myocardial remodelling, attenuate Ang II-induced heart
hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction,7, as well as renal oxidative stress, inflammation,
and fibrosis.8,9 However, both in humans and mice10,11, rACE2 exhibits fast clearance
rates with a reported half-life of only hours by pharmacokinetic studies. Recently, fusion
protein of rACE2 with an Fc fragment (rACE2-Fc) showed organ protection in both acute
and chronic models of angiotensin II-dependent hypertension in mice12, interestingly, the
fusion protein also showed long-lasting effects.
Based on the receptor function of ACE2 for coronavirus, we hypothesis that ACE2
fusion protein may have neutralization potential for coronavirus, especially the
2019-nCoV. To further evaluated the therapeutic potential of ACE2, fusion protein
(ACE2-Ig) consisting of the extracellular domain of human ACE2 linked to the Fc
domain of human IgG1 was constructed and generated (Fig. 1). An ACE2 variant
(HH/NN) in which two active-site histidines (residues 374 and 378) have been altered to
asparagines was also used in our study to reduce the catalytic activity. The fusion protein
contain the ACE2 variant were termed as mACE2-Ig. The expression and purification
methods were described in our previous reports13,14. The affinities of the fusion proteins
for SARS-CoV RBD and 2019-nCoV RBD were determined with BIAcore binding

assays (Fig. S1) and both fusion proteins showed high affinity to RBDs. Moreover, the
fusion proteins had similar denaturation temperature compared with the Fc fusion protein
TIGIT-Ig reported in our pervious report13, suggesting a IgG-like stability. The lowest
concentration (< 2%) of high molecular weight and low molecular weight products was
observed after 1 week of storage at 40 °C at a 1 mg/ml concentration. Pharmacokinetic
(PK) parameters of the fusion proteins were then tested in our study. Mice were treated
separately with a single intravenous dose of fusion proteins and the serum concentrations
of fusion proteins were determined by ELISA. The results showed that the main PK
parameters of ACE2-Ig, mACE2-Ig and TIGIT-Ig were very similar in mice and
demonstrated the high stability of the fusion proteins. The experimental data are
summarized in Table S1.
After we identified that ACE2 fusion proteins binds to the RBDs with high affinity,
we next sought to test the inhibitory activity of ACE2 fusion proteins against 2019-nCoV
and compare it with that against SARS-CoV, by using viruses pseudotyped with the S
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Our data shows that Both SARS-CoV and
2019-nCoV viruses were potently neutralized by ACE2-Ig and mACE2-Ig. The IC50 of
SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV viruses neutralized by ACE2-Ig were 0.8 and 0.1 μg/ml,
respectively. And The IC50 of the two viruses neutralized by mACE2-Ig were 0.9 and
0.08 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 2). No evidence of neutralization was observed for the
TIGIT-Ig. We next using cell fusion assay to further characterize the in vitro
neutralization effect of the fusion proteins (Fig .3). ACE2-Ig potently inhibited the SARS
CoV-S protein-mediated fusion with an IC50 of 0.85 μg/ml, and the 2019 nCoV-S
protein-mediated fusion with an IC50 of 0.65 μg/ml. Under the same experimental
conditions, another fusion protein mACE2-Ig exhibited an IC50 of 0.76 μg/ml and
0.48μg/ml, for the SARS CoV and 2019 nCoV, respectively. The control TIGIT-Fc did
not show any inhibitory effect in this assay. These data suggest that both ACE2-Ig and
mACE2-Ig exhibit potent inhibitory activity against SARS CoV and 2019 nCOV.
ACE2 has already been identified as an important drug targets for the treatment of
cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Although it has been established that ACE2 is a key
function receptor for the coronavirus infection, the practical use of rACE2 protein may be
impede by the short half-life of rACE2. Recombinant Fc fusion technique, which enable

soluble proteins to extend plasma residence time, improve in vivo efficacy, and gain
immunoreactive functions, has been widely used in modern biopharmaceuticals. For
example, new long-acting forms of both recombinant coagulation factors rFVIII-Fc and
rFIX-Fc were recently approved for clinical treatments of hemophilia A and B that
require less frequent infusions15,16. And the TNF receptor fusion protein has been use in
clinic for decades17. Unlike the blood resident enzymes of coagulation factors, full-length
endogenous ACE2 is a transmembrane protein anchored to the cell surface and that ACE2
activities are, in fact, present at very low levels in systemic circulation18-20. Therefore,
one safety concern of the ACE2 fusion protein is that they may have systemic
cardiovascular side-effect. Interestingly, one recently report shows that treatment of
murine ACE2 fusion proteins in mice show no evidence of side-effect12. Moreover, our
preliminary studies showed that the neutralization effect remained efficient when two
active-site histidines of ACE2 were modified to asparagine.
To sum up, our data investigate the therapeutic potential of ACE2 based strategies
against 2019-nCoV which could be used alone or in combination. Based on the molecular
mechanisms of blocking of ACE2, the fusion proteins have the potential to have broad
neutralizing activity to coronavirus. These ACE2 fusion proteins could be also used for
diagnosis and as research reagents in the development of vaccines and inhibitors.

Methods
Generation of fusion proteins
For recombinant fusion plasmid, DNA sequences of extracellular domains (ECDs) of
ACE2 (aa: 1-740) were ligated to the Fc segment of human IgG1. Mutations were
generated by integrated DNA Technologies. We use the FreeStyle 293 expression system
(Invitrogen) to express the fusion proteins. Vectors and detailed methods were according
to our previous study21. Fusion proteins were further purified using protein A Sepharose
with the harvested cell culture supernatant. TIGIT-Ig, which were described in our
pervious report13, served as a control in our study. The concentration and purity of the
fusion protein were determined by measuring the UV absorbance at a wavelength of 280
nm and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively.
Affinity measurement
CoV RBDs were prepared as previously described1. We use a previously reported

method14 with immobilized anti-human Fc polyclonal antibody on a CM5 chip (~150 RU)
to capture the fusion proteins and and then injected CoV RBDs (12.5 nM~200 nM). blank
flow cells were used for the correction of the binding response. The surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) method with a BIAcore-2000 was used to measure the monovalent
binding affinity of the fusion protein and performed kinetic analysis using a 1:1 L model
that simultaneously fit ka and kb.
Pharmacokinetics
We used BALB/c mice to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the fusion protein.
Eight-week-old mice were administered the fusion protein at a dose of 5 mg/kg body
weight by tail vein injection. Mice were divided into 15 groups, corresponding to day 1 to
day 15. Blood was collected from the septum in heparin-containing tubes and then
centrifuged to remove blood cells and to obtain plasma samples. The serum concentration
of the fusion protein was determined by ELISA.
Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay.
Pseudoviruses containing the S glycoprotein from various virus, and a defective HIV-1
genome that expresses luciferase as a reporter protein, were prepared, and the assays
performed as described previously22-25.
Cell Fusion Inhibition Assay.
A quantitative cell fusion assay based on β-galactosidase (β-gal) as a reporter gene was
used for the assessment of the neutralization activity of the fusion proteins, as described
previously26. 293T cells transfected with the indicated CoV S glycoprotein genes were
preincubated with different fusion proteins at room temperature for 15 min, then mixed
with 293T cells transfected with ACE2 at 1:1 ratio and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Cells
were then lysed, and the β-gal activity was measured. The protein concentrations during
fusion were used for calculation of the IC50 defined as the concentration at which the
β-gal activity was reduced by 50%.
