SUMMARY
Antibodies with heavy chains that derive from the VH1-2 gene constitute some of the most
potent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies yet identified. To provide insight into whether
these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determined structures of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4.
All three utilized VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD),
with heavy chain N53I enhancing binding and light chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD.
Despite these similarities, class members bound both RBD-up and -down conformations of
the spike, with a subset of antibodies utilizing elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343
on a neighboring RBD – a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD
separation of up to 12 Å. The VH1-2-antibody class thus utilizes modular recognition
encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with VH-gene
component specifying recognition of RBD and CDRH3 component specifying quaternary
interactions.

Introduction
Studies on human antibody responses to viral pathogens including HIV-1, influenza,
EBOLA, and malaria have revealed prominent classes of similar neutralizing antibodies (nAbs),
which arise commonly in numerous individuals in response to infection or vaccination (Zhou et al.,
2013, Ehrhardt et al., 2019, Zhou et al., 2015, Joyce et al., 2016, Imkeller et al., 2018, Kallewaard
et al., 2016, Pappas et al., 2014). Such multi-donor antibody classes are defined based on similar
V(D)J gene recombination and similar mode of structural recognition – with this combination
indicative of a common evolutionary process in antibody development (Kwong and Mascola,
2012). Multi-donor antibody classes are thought to arise based on effective function, combined
with genetic accessibility due to class requirements for V(D)J recombination and somatic
hypermutations of sufficient frequency as to be present in the antibody human repertoire. Some
multi-donor antibody classes are potent, broadly neutralizing, and frequent in human antibody
repertoire (Joyce et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2013, Imkeller et al., 2018). A prominent mode of
rational vaccine design – “lineage-based vaccine design” –endeavors to elicit such antibody classes
by vaccination (Kwong and Mascola, 2018, Jardine et al., 2013, Haynes et al., 2012) and this
approach to human vaccination has recently entered clinical assessment (Diemert and McElrath,
2018).
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected over 80 million people
and has claimed over one million deaths since the outbreak began in late 2019 (Zhu et al., 2020,
Zhou et al., 2020, Dong et al., 2020). Therapies and vaccines are urgently needed to end the
pandemic. Many nAbs have now been isolated from COVID-19 convalescent donors with the most
potent nAbs showing promise as prophylactic or therapeutic agents (Liu et al., 2020, Robbiani et

al., 2020, Rogers et al., 2020, Brouwer et al., 2020, Zost et al., 2020, Kreer et al., 2020, Tortorici et
al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020). This growing set of nAbs provides an opportunity to identify effective
human antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 common in the population, which will inform
therapeutic strategies and help to interpret vaccine readouts.
SARS-CoV-2 nAbs predominantly target the viral spike glycoprotein, which interacts with
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host-cell surface to mediate virus entry
(Hoffmann et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The ectodomain of the prefusion spike comprises three
copies of both S1 and S2 subunits (Wrapp et al., 2020). The S1 subunit is responsible for ACE2
binding, and the S2 subunit mediates fusion with host cell membrane. Each S1 subunit comprises
an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor binding domain (RBD). The RBDs are very flexible,
adopting either an ‘up’ conformation (open state) or a ‘down’ conformation (closed state), with
only the ‘up’ RBDs capable of interacting with ACE2 (Wang et al., 2020). Currently, many nAbs
have been characterized which bind to epitopes on either the ‘up’ and/or ‘down’ RBDs (Tortorici
et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020, Barnes et al., 2020a). These RBD-targeting nAbs neutralize SARSCoV-2 through mechanisms that include competition with ACE2 for RBD binding and locking the
RBDs in the ‘down’ conformation.
Human SARS-CoV-2 nAbs develop with few somatic hypermutations and strong avidity
effects (Liu et al., 2020, Robbiani et al., 2020, Barnes et al., 2020b, Kreer et al., 2020).
Characterization of genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs identified to date show enrichment of
antibody variable genes including VH3-53, VH1-2, VH1-69, VH3-66, VH1-58, and VH3-30
(Yuan et al., 2020, Robbiani et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020). So far, structural characterization of
multiple nAbs have revealed two separate RBD-targeted classes derived from the similar VH3-53
and VH3-66 genes. One of these is characterized by heavy chain complementarity-determining

region 3 (CDRH3) of 15 amino acids or shorter – and recognizes RBD ridge in the ‘up’ position on
SARS-CoV-2 spike (type I) (Yuan et al., 2020). The second VH3-53/-66 class – with longer
CDRH3s – recognizes a similar region of RBD, but adopts an approach angle with the heavy and
light chain orientation rotated 180 degrees (type II), suggesting CDRH3 to be critical for the
classification of VH3-53/-66 antibodies (Wu et al., 2020a, Barnes et al., 2020a). Different VH3-30
originated antibodies can recognize at least three different regions of RBDs (Barnes et al., 2020a,
Hansen et al., 2020), demonstrating that they do not form a single gene-restricted antibody class.
Nevertheless, whether nAbs derived from VH1-2 and other germline genes form gene-restricted
classes that represent shared effective antibody responses remains unaddressed. Currently, three
VH1-2 potent nAbs (2-4, S2M11, and C121) show similar modes of RBD recognition but
differences in quaternary epitope recognition (Tortorici et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020, Barnes et al.,
2020a). It is thus still unclear whether RBD-targeting VH1-2 antibodies form a gene-restricted
class. If so, what are the key genetic and structural signatures and determinants of neutralization
potency?
Here we present structures of three VH1-2-derived nAbs (2-15, 2-43, and H4), revealing
that they recognize a SARS-CoV-2 RBD epitope with similar modes of RBD recognition and
similar angles of approach. Overall, recognition is modular with RBD predominantly recognized
by a VH1-2 gene encoded module. The second recognition module is represented by the diverse
CDRH3s of the VH1-2 antibodies, which mediate quaternary recognition of N343 glycan from an
adjacent RBD for a subset of class members. Thus, we define a multi-donor VH1-2 antibody class,
members of which can achieve very high neutralization potency, which is prevalent in human
responses to SARS-CoV-2. The shared genetic and structural signatures inform strategies to
improve members of the VH1-2 antibody class.

Results
VH1-2 antibodies are prevalent in human response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
To identify common features of the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, 158 spikespecific antibodies with characterized neutralization potencies were collected from 10 studies
(Table S1) (Liu et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020b, Hansen et al., 2020, Robbiani et al., 2020, Rogers et
al., 2020, Brouwer et al., 2020, Ju et al., 2020, Zost et al., 2020, Kreer et al., 2020, Tortorici et al.,
2020). V(D)J gene usage analysis showed that VH1-2 was the second most frequently utilized
germline gene (Figure 1A, 25 in total). Comparison of neutralization potencies revealed that 11 of
25 (44%) of the VH1-2 antibodies are potent (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
<0.1µg/ml, Figure 1B). Within four studies (Zost et al., 2020, Tortorici et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020,
Hansen et al., 2020), VH1-2 antibodies ranked the most potent of gene-delimited sets of antibodies
(IC50 ranges from 0.015 to 0.0007µg/ml). All 25 of the VH1-2-derived antibodies have been
reported to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Liu et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020b, Hansen et al., 2020,
Robbiani et al., 2020, Rogers et al., 2020, Brouwer et al., 2020, Ju et al., 2020, Zost et al., 2020,
Kreer et al., 2020, Tortorici et al., 2020). Sequence alignment of the VH1-2 nAbs showed the
heavy chains to carry few somatic hypermutations, with each having a unique CDRH3 with length
varying from 11 to 21 amino acids (Figure 1C and S1A, Kabat definition), and using different D
genes (Figure S1B). The VH1-2 antibodies used both kappa and lambda genes with enrichment of
the IGLV2-14 gene (Figure 1C).
As described below, we determined structures of three nAbs: 2-15, 2-43, and H4, with the
highly potent antibodies 2-15 and 2-43 isolated from donor ‘2’ of our previous study (Liu et al.,
2020) while H4 was from a different donor (Wu et al., 2020b). 2-15, 2-43, and H4 neutralize

authentic SARS-CoV-2 “live” virus with IC50 of 0.0007, 0.003, and 0.896 µg/ml, respectively.
These three antibodies derived from different heavy and light chain gene recombinations, and
hence three different B cell lineages (Figure S1B). Both 2-43 and 2-15 utilize the DH2-15*01 gene
and have a long CDRH3 of 20 amino acids (Figure S1C), but they have different HJ gene origins
(JH6*03 and JH3*02 respectively). The light chains of 2-43 and 2-15 were derived from
recombination of a novel allele of the VL2-14 gene with JL3*02 and JL1*01 respectively (Figure
S1D). H4 used DH2-2*01 and JH2*01 genes and had a CDRH3 of 17 amino acids (Wu et al.,
2020b). The H4 light chain was derived from VK2-40*01 and JK4*01.

Structures of antibodies 2-15, 2-43, and H4 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD
To understand SARS-CoV-2 spike recognition by the VH1-2-derived antibodies, we used
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to produce high-resolution 3D-reconstructions
of antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) from 2-15, 2-43, and H4 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2
spike (Table S2). The reconstruction of the 2-43 complex with spike, refined to a global resolution
of 3.60Å (Figure S2A-S2E), is significantly improved than in our previous study (5.8Å resolution)
(Liu et al., 2020). The reconstruction revealed a predominant class with 3 Fab molecules bound per
spike trimer (Figure 2A). Each 2-43 Fab used heavy chain variable domain to bind one primary
RBD with an orientation similar to the previously published antibody 2-4 (Liu et al., 2020), with
all RBDs in the ‘down’ conformation (Figure 2A). 2-43 heavy and light chains also recognize a
quaternary epitope from the adjacent RBD. 3D classification revealed less populated states with 1
and 2 Fabs bound, but in every case the Fab was bound to a ‘down’ RBD. This dependence upon
the ‘down’ conformation is likely due to extensive interactions between the Fab CDRH3 loop and
the N-linked glycosylation at residue N343 on the adjacent RBD (Figure S2E). This suggests a

neutralization mechanism whereby the Fab simultaneously occludes ACE2 binding and locks the
RBDs in the ‘down’ conformation.
For the complex of 2-15 with spike (Figure 2B), approximately 56% of particles were
bound to an RBD in the ‘up’ conformation, and 44% bound to RBD ‘down’ (Figure S2F-S2I),
differing from antibody 2-43, which bound only to “down” RBDs. Due to increased
conformational heterogeneity of the RBD ‘up’ class, the RBD ‘down’ class was the focus of our
structural analysis (Figure 2B). In our initial attempt, a 9-fold molar excess of Fab was incubated
with the S trimer. However, this resulted in spike disassembly (Figure S2J). To overcome this
issue for structure determination, we found that a 1:1 molar ratio left spike-complexes intact,
though some spike disassembly was still observed (Figure S2K). Although we were unable to
resolve the 2-15:spike interaction at atomic resolution, the cryo-EM analysis did reveal the overall
orientation of the Fab along with the position of the peptide backbone for several of the CDR
loops.
To understand the binding mode of 2-15 at atomic resolution, we determined the crystal
structure of 2-15 in complex with isolated RBD. The structure was determined by molecular
replacement at 3.18 Å resolution to a final crystallographic Rwork/Rfree of 18.6%/23.8% with good
overall geometry (Table S3). The electron density for RBD (corresponding to S1-subunit residues
333-527) was well defined for residues 344-518, with missing internal stretches of four (362-366)
and seven (383-390) residues, with the C-terminal eighteen residues (519-537) disordered (Figure
2C). For Fab 2-15 all residues were visualized in density, with the exception of heavy chain
residues 142-145 in the Fc region. We then docked the crystal structure to the 2-15-spike complex
cryo-EM density map by superposing RBD from the crystal structure on RBD from the cryo-EM
map, with subsequent rigid body fitting to density.

Overall, the conformation of 2-15 in the crystal structure agrees with the density observed
in the cryo-EM map of the complex with spike – particularly in the V-gene-encoded CDR regions.
However, the conformation of the long CDRH3 loop differs, and is far more elongated in the
crystal structure (Figure S2L). In the cryo-EM map, it appears that the CDRH3 loop is pushed
away from the N343 glycan and the helix encompassing residues 364-371 from the adjacent
‘down’ RBD. The two light chains exhibit more significant conformational differences. Save for
CDRL3, which bends slightly away from RBD in the crystal structure, the conformations of the
loops are quite similar, but the chain is shifted down closer to the RBD.
Finally, a reconstruction of Fab H4 revealed spike complexes with a single Fab bound to
RBD in the ‘up’ conformation (Figure 2D and S2M to S2P). Interestingly, no Fab was seen bound
to a ‘down’ RBD. The conformational flexibility of the RBD while in the ‘up’ conformation made
a high-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction unattainable, and the map was refined to an overall
resolution of 5.08Å. Similar to Fab 2-15, the peptide backbone for many CDR loops are observed,
and a homology model of the Fab variable domain was docked into the density. The
superimposition of modeled H4 to the 2-43/spike complex showed that H4 adopts an RBD
approaching angle similar to 2-43 (Figure S2Q). However, the light chain of H4 rotates toward the
interface between RBDs such that the long CDRL1 of H4 clashes with N343 glycan from an
adjacent ‘down’ RBD (Figure S2R), which suggests a possible explanation for the apparent lack of
H4 binding to ‘down’ RBDs.

Conserved mode of RBD recognition
To understand the similarity in RBD recognition, we characterized the epitope and paratope
interactions of 2-43 and 2-15 and compared to the three published VH1-2 antibodies 2-4, S2M11,

and C121 (Tortorici et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020, Barnes et al., 2020a). Overall, 2-43 interacts
predominantly with the receptor binding motif (RBM, residues 438-508) on one ‘down’ RBD
protomer while simultaneously binding the N343 glycan from an adjacent ‘down’ RBD protomer
(Figure 3A). We describe the N343 glycan interaction below in the last section focused on
quaternary interactions. The interaction between 2-43 and the ‘primary’ RBD bound through its
receptor binding motif buries a total of 756Å2 paratope surface area (BSA), 83% of which is
contributed by heavy chain (Figure 3A and S3A). Heavy chain framework 1 (FWH1), CDRH1,
CDRH2, and CDRL3 of 2-43 form hydrogen bond networks with three RBD regions. In the first
region, residues in FWH1 (G26HC, Y27HC, T28HC, F29HC, and T30HC) and the DE-loop in FWH3
(T73HC, S74HC, and T76HC) form a groove to hold Y449RBD which contributes 111Å2 BSA.
Hydrogen bonds are observed between the backbone atoms of Y27HC and F29HC and the side chain
hydroxyl of Y449RBD and between the side chain hydroxyl of T28HC and the side chain amino
group of Q498RBD (Figure 3A). In the second region, involving the ‘flat’ region of RBM, the
hydroxyl group of T30HC forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl from S494RBD. In
the third region or the RBD ridge region, Y33HC, N52HC, and S54HC form a hydrogen bond
network with E484RBD. The side chains of Y91LC and S95LC hydrogen bond with backbones of
G485RBD and F486RBD. In addition, Y30LC, Y32LC, Y91LC, and Y100jHC also form a hydrophobic
pocket to hold F486RBD (Figure S3B), with π-π stacking observed between Y30LC and F486RBD
(Figure 3A right).
The crystal structure of 2-15 complexed with SARS-CoV-2 RBD revealed 2-15 to use
similar heavy and light chain regions to recognize the RBM (Figure 3B left panel). Similar to 2-43,
2-15 forms convergent hydrogen bonds to Y449RBD, S494RBD, E484RBD, and G485RBD through
residues Y27HC, F29HC, T30HC, Y33HC, N52HC, and S95LC (Figure 3B right three panels). 2-15

Y30LC and Y91LC engage in π-π stackings with F486RBD. Nonetheless, 2-15 interactions different
from 2-43 are also observed at the RBM flat and ridge regions. The side chain of 2-15 I53HC
interacts with a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues L452RBD, F490RBD, L492RBD, Q493RBD,
and S494RBD– interactions that are not observed in 2-43 which instead includes germline residue
N53HC (Figure 3B third panel). Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between G31HC and S97HC
and Q493RBD and between N58HC and E484RBD (Figure 3B right two panels).
Compared to 2-43 and 2-15, the published VH1-2 antibodies 2-4, S2M11, and C121
showed similar RBM approach angle and binding mode (Figure 3C, 3D, S3C, and S3D). Typically,
interactions between the VH1-2 antibodies and the RBD buried a total of about 1300-1600Å2 BSA
(RBDA column in Figure S3C), with antibody heavy chains contributing about 80% of the paratope.
For all antibodies, shared paratope residues are observed in FWH1, CDRH1, CDRH2, FWH3,
CDRL1, and CDRL3 (Figure S1A and S1C). FWH1, CDRH1, and CDRH2 residues form
conserved hydrogen bond networks with Y449RBD, E484RBD, and Q493. Thus, these VH1-2
encoded residues form a module for RBM recognition. Despite these antibodies having different
light chain gene origins, convergent tyrosine residues (Y30LC, Y32LC, and Y91LC) in CDRL1 and
CDRL3 pack against F486RBD (Figure S3B), which constitutes another module for RBD
recognition. Because each antibody has a unique CDRH3, no conserved polar or hydrophobic
interaction is observed (Figure 3 and S3B-S3D), albeit CDRH3 contributes the most BSA among
the CDRs except in 2-15 (Figure S3A). Altogether, the germline gene residues from the VH1-2
gene as well as light chain V genes anchor the antibodies to the RBM in a similar mode with heavy
chain V region playing a dominant role in determining the mode of recognition.

The VH1-2 antibody class and similarity to other SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting antibodies

To gain an overall understanding of similarity in binding orientations of the VH1-2
antibodies, we superposed RBD and antibody complexes and calculated pairwise root mean square
deviation (RMSD) to compare relative binding orientations of the six VH1-2 antibodies (2-43, 2-15,
H4, 2-4, C121, and S2M11) as well as 31 additional RBD-targeting antibodies originated from other
VH genes. Overall, the VH1-2 antibodies have similar binding orientations (Figure 4A). Clustering
of the 37 antibodies using pairwise RMSDs showed that the six VH1-2 antibodies group together
(Figure S4A). The six VH1-2 antibodies also have highly overlapping heavy and light chain
approach angles and epitopes (Figure 4B and S4B), which overlap with ACE2 binding site (Figure
S4D). The similarity in genetic origin, details of their interactions with RBD (unavailable for H4),
and angle of approach, suggests that these six antibodies form a VH1-2 antibody class.
The structural, recombination, and somatic hypermutation analyses (described below in the
next section) presented here revealed critical residues that determine the specificity and binding
affinity of the VH1-2 class antibodies. We define residues forming conserved side chain polar and/or
hydrophobic interactions as genetic signatures. The heavy chain signatures include a T30-x-x-Y33
motif in CDRH1 and a [NS]52-x-[NIV]-S54 motif (x represents any amino acid) in CDRH2 (Figure
4C), with no conserved motif observed in CDRH3 (Figure S1A). Searches of germline gene
databases using this signature showed only alleles of the VH1-2 gene to match both motifs (Figure
4E), suggesting that the antibody class is likely to be strictly VH1-2-restricted.
For light chain, the side chains of Y32LC and Y91LC interact with F486RBD (Figure 3 and
S3B). In 2-43, 2-4, and S2M11, Y32LC also interacts with N343 glycan from adjacent RBDs
(described below in the quaternary recognition section). Because the light chain interactionsignatures can be found in many germline genes (Figure 4D and S4C), the VH1-2 antibody class
may not be restricted with respect to light chain origin gene.

To understand the conservation of the VH1-2 antibody epitope, we calculated the
conservation score for each RBD residue and observed that the flat region is highly conserved in the
natural SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. The four RBD residues critical for VH1-2 antibody recognition,
Y449RBD, E484RBD, F486RBD, and Q493RBD, showed low mutation frequencies (approximately 0, 3,
7, and 7 per 10,000 sequences, respectively). Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 strains with mutations at
the four positions are resistant to C121 and S2M11 of the VH1-2 antibody class (Tortorici et al.,
2020, Barnes et al., 2020a).
In addition, the VH1-2 antibodies show high similarity in approach angle and epitope to
antibody C144 (Figure 4C and S4A), a type II VH3-53/-66 antibody. However, C144 uses different
CDRH1 and CDRH2 motifs for interacting with the conserved residues in the flat region and ridge
of RBD (e.g. the N32-Y33 and [T/S]54-G-G-[T/S]57 motifs in the VH3-53/-66 antibodies) (Figure
4C) (Wu et al., 2020a, Barnes et al., 2020a). The CDRH2 of C144 shifts towards the RBD ridge,
perhaps because the CDRH2s of the VH3-53/-66 genes are one residue shorter than the VH1-2 gene.
Nonetheless, both antibody classes use similar light chain genes including VL2-14 and VL2-23,
which provide key Tyr residues that interact with F486RBD.

Somatic hypermutations and avidity improve antibody potency
To understand the effects of somatic hypermutation (SHM) on binding affinity and
neutralization potency, we reverted SHMs in the paratope regions of 2-43, 2-15, and 2-4 to their
germline residues individually and in combination. 2-43 only has one SHM in the paratope region,
S76THC (Figure S1A), the reversion of which reduces the IgG apparent binding affinity and
pseudovirus neutralization potency by about 2-fold and 5-fold respectively (Figure 5A, 5B, and
S4E). For 2-15, three paratope SHMs were observed: N53IHC, G55DHC, and Y32FLC. The

reversion of N53IHC and Y32FLC individually reduced binding affinity by 16-fold and 5-fold
respectively (Figure 5A) as well as neutralization potency by 217-fold and 42-fold respectively
(Figure 5B). The results suggested that the N53IHC and F32YHC mutations are critical for the
affinity maturation of 2-15. Structural analysis showed that the N53IHC mutation allows the Ile side
chain to fit a hydrophobic pocket on RBD (Figure 3B and S5A). A convergent mutation is also
observed in S2M11 (N53IHC) and C121 (N53VHC). We then introduced the N53IHC mutation to 243 and 2-4 and observed significant improvements of both binding affinity and neutralization
potency (Figure 5). These results suggested that mutation to a hydrophobic residue at 53HC can be
used to improve members of the VH1-2 antibody class. The crystal structure further showed that 215 32LC does not interact with RBD, but instead locates between W100gHC and Y91LC, which
interact with RBD (Figure S3B). This implies that the Y32FLC SHM may alter the interaction with
RBD indirectly. For 2-4, the SHM A60THC generates an N-glycosylation site at position N58HC.
The N58HC glycan interacts with the RBD ridge (Figure 3C). The reversion of this SHM reduces
binding affinity and neutralization by about 5-fold and 9-fold respectively (Figure 5). In summary,
somatic hypermutation analysis revealed that the precursors of these antibodies could bind
antigens with nanomolar apparent binding affinity, suggesting that the precursors of these
antibodies can be activated efficiently by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Nonetheless, SHMs
significantly improve both the binding affinity and the neutralization potency of these antibodies.
Because the observed SHMs are frequently generated by the somatic hypermutation machinery
(Figure S1A), we anticipate that requirements for somatic hypermutations are unlikely to present a
significant barrier for affinity maturation of this antibody class.
In addition, we evaluated effect of avidity on antibodies 2-43, 2-15, and 2-4. Comparison
of neutralization potency between IgGs and Fabs revealed that the Fabs of 2-43, 2-15, and 2-4

have potencies of about 140-, 95-, and 14-fold lower than their IgG forms respectively (Figure
S5C), suggesting that avidity effects are critical for achieving high neutralization potency.

Recognition of quaternary epitopes modulates spike conformation.
Our previous study with a low resolution cryo-EM structure showed that 2-43 recognizes a
quaternary epitope (Liu et al., 2020). However, details on the quaternary interactions and their
functional relevance have not yet been characterized. Here, high resolution cryo-EM
reconstructions revealed atomic-level interactions between 2-43 and the quaternary epitope.
Overall, 2-43 interacts comprehensively with N343 glycan as well as helix 364-371 from an
adjacent ‘down’ RBD protomer (RBDB) (Figure 6A and S6A), burying a total of 999Å BSA
(Figure S3A). The quaternary interaction is predominantly mediated by the long CDRH3, which is
held by the two branches of the N343 glycan, the structure of which is highly flexible and has not
been observed in previous studies. The 2-43 CDRH3 forms two hydrogen bond networks to
stabilize N343 glycan (Figure 6A). The tip of one N343 glycan branch is further stabilized by
hydrogen bonding with 2-43 Y32LC and the ridge of RBDA (N487RBD and Y489RBD) (Figure S6A).
In addition, the tip of the elongated CDRH3 interacts with helix 364-371 of RBDB (Figure 6A).
Altogether, 2-43 forms strong quaternary interactions with the adjacent ‘down’ RBD, which is
critical for locking RBDs in the all ‘down’ conformation. In contrast to 2-43, the cryo-EM density
maps of the 2-15 and H4 spike complexes revealed no quaternary contacts (Figure 2D, S2L, and
6B).
Comparison of quaternary interactions among the five VH1-2-derived antibodies revealed
two structural groups. Group 1 includes 2-43, 2-4, and S2M11, which bind predominantly ‘down’
RBDs. Group 2 includes 2-15, H4, and C121, which bind both ‘up’ and ‘down’ or only ‘up’ RBDs.

For group 1, the quaternary recognition is mediated mostly by CDRH3, followed by CDRL1 and
CDRL2 (Figure 6C and S3A). Differences between each antibody-specific CDRH3 determines
that each antibody has a unique quaternary epitope (Figure 6A, 6B, 6C, S3B, and S6B). Different
from S2M11, the quaternary interaction is indispensable for 2-43 which binds to spike trimer but
not isolated RBD (Liu et al., 2020). The quaternary epitope of 2-4, only part of which appears to
be visible in the cryo-EM map (Liu et al., 2020) comprises only N343 glycan from the adjacent
‘down’ RBD protomer (Figure 6C), likely because 2-4 has a short CDRH3. A hydrogen bond
network is observed between CDRH3 Y100bHC, CDRL1 Y32LC, and N343 glycan of the adjacent
RBD. The quaternary epitope of S2M11 includes N343 glycan and helices 339-343 and 364-371 of
the adjacent RBD (Figure S6B). Altogether, accommodation of N343 glycan from the adjacent
‘down’ RBD is a common feature of quaternary recognition by group 1 antibodies. The diverse
CDRH3s of the group 1 antibodies form a module for quaternary recognition. In contrast, group 2
antibodies 2-15 and C121 show minor interactions with neighboring ‘down’ RBDs (Figure 2C, 6B,
S2R, and S3A), which may explain why they do not lock the trimeric RBDs in an all ‘down’
conformation.
To understand whether antibody binding induces conformation change in the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein, we compared the antibody-bound and ligand-free spike structures in the closed (all
‘down’) prefusion conformation. These comparisons showed that the binding of the VH1-2
antibodies (except S2M11), as well as other RBD-directed antibodies leads to significantly larger
distances and less contacts between the trimeric ‘down’ RBDs (Figure 6D and 6E). Each of these
antibodies plays a role in bridging the interactions between RBDs as well as reorienting the
conformation of N343 glycan. However, antibodies like 2-15, which does not form strong
interactions with the adjacent RBD, may disassemble the spike when 3 Fabs bind to the RBDs

(Figure S2J and S2K). In addition, superposition of 2-15 on the ‘down’ RBD in ligand-free spike
revealed the light chain to significantly clash with an adjacent ‘up’ RBD (Figure S6D), suggesting
members of the VH1-2 antibody class to either bind only ‘down’ RBDs when a neighboring
‘down’ RBD is available or push the neighboring ‘up’ RBD away to bind ‘down’ RBDs.
Consistent with the first mechanism, we did not observe a neighboring ‘up’ RBD adjacent to 2-15
and 2-4 bound ‘down’ RBDs in the cryo-EM data. In contrast, C121 adopts the second mechanism
through light chain interaction with the adjacent ‘up’ RBD (Figure S6D) (Barnes et al., 2020a). In
summary, the quaternary interaction and angle of approach determine that the VH1-2 antibody
class modulates SARS-CoV-2 spike conformation when binding to a ‘down’ RBD.

Discussion
In this study, we determined structures of three nAbs: 2-43, 2-15, and H4, which revealed a
VH1-2 antibody class with a common RBD-binding mode and similar angle of approach. The VH12 antibody class uses two modules for spike recognition with the VH1-2 gene encoded module for
recognition of RBD and CDRH3 module for quaternary recognition. The VH1-2 antibody class has
little or no restraint on CDRH3 length. The prevalence of the VH1-2 antibody class in numerous
donors (Liu et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020b, Hansen et al., 2020, Robbiani et al., 2020, Rogers et al.,
2020, Brouwer et al., 2020, Ju et al., 2020, Zost et al., 2020, Kreer et al., 2020, Tortorici et al.,
2020) suggests it to be a common component of the effective antibody response to SARS-CoV-2
that can include highly potent neutralizing antibodies.
For some members of the VH1-2 class, recognition of a quaternary epitope can lock RBDs
in the ‘down’ conformation, providing an additional mechanism to achieve high neutralization
potency. The quaternary epitopes of the VH1-2 class include the N343 glycan and helix 364-371 of

an adjacent RBD. A similar quaternary epitope is recognized by the type II VH3-53/-66 class
antibody C144 (Barnes et al., 2020a). Thus, this quaternary epitope appears to represent a supersite
at which antibodies lock the RBDs in the all ‘down’ conformation. We also observe that the
quaternary interaction can induce distinct conformational changes of the trimeric ‘down’ RBDs.
The quaternary interaction observed in S2M11 does not significantly alter the distance between
spike protomers (Figure 4E) (Tortorici et al., 2020). In contrast, the quaternary interactions of 2-43
and 2-4, mediated predominantly by CDRH3, increase the distance of the trimeric RBDs (Figure 4).
For 2-15, the cryo-EM structure of one Fab bound spike revealed a CDRH3 conformation moving
away from the adjacent ‘down’ RBD to avoid steric clash. Despite this, 2-15 also increases the
distance between RBDs, which may be the result of mobile quaternary contacts that cannot be
observed in the low resolution cryo-EM reconstruction. We anticipate that the interactions between
RBDs could be further weakened when all three protomers are bound by 2-15, which may be the
cause of the observed spike disassembly by 2-15 (Figure S2J and S2K). The disassembly of spike
may be another mechanism for 2-15 to achieve ultrapotent neutralization. In addition, the crystal
structure of 2-15 in complex with isolated RBD showed 2-15 to have another stable binding mode
in the absence of a quaternary contact. We hypothesize that this binding mode may be observed
when 2-15 binds to ‘up’ RBDs and cannot form quaternary interactions.
The structural information we present also provides clues for further optimization of the
VH1-2 antibody class. Despite members of the class achieving high potency with germline gene
mediated interactions, we observe that somatic hypermutations can further improve this class
significantly. The conserved mode of RBD recognition implies that members of the antibody class
will be sensitive to similar viral escape mutations (e.g. C121 is sensitive to E484KRBD and
Q493RRBD) (Barnes et al., 2020a, Tortorici et al., 2020).

Cell lines
Expi293 cells and Expi293F™ GnTI- Cells were from ThermoFisher Scientific Inc
(ThermoFisher, cat#A14527 and cat# A39240 respectively). HEK 293T/17(cat# CRL-11268™)
and Vero E6 cells (cat# CRL-1586™) were from ATCC.

METHOD DETAILS
Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD Proteins
The mammalian expression vector that encodes the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer was
kindly provided by Jason McLellan (Wrapp et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 S trimer expression vector
was transiently transfected into Expi293TM cells using 1 mg/mL of polyethylenimine
(Polysciences). Five days post transfection, the S trimer was purified using Strep-Tactin XT Resin
(Zymo Research).
The SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 331-528), was cloned into the pVRC-8400 mammalian
expression plasmid, with a C-terminal 6X-His-tag and an intervening HRV-3C protease
cleavage site. Expression vector was transiently transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney
(HEK) 293 GnTI- Freestyle cells suspension culture in serum-free media (Invitrogen) using
polyethyleneimine (Polysciences). Media was harvested 4 days after transfection and the
secreted protein purified using Ni-NTA IMAC Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare)
followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in 10
mM, Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions containing RBD were pooled and HRV-3C
protease (Thermo fisher) was added in a mass ratio 1:100 relative to RBD, followed by
incubation for 24 h at 20ºC, to remove the C-terminal histidine-tag. The protein solution was
again passed through the NI-NTA column to remove the His-tag and any traces of uncleaved

protein. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and buffer exchanged to SEC buffer and
concentrated to ~5 mg/mL and used for crystallization experiments.

Antibody production and mutagenesis
For each antibody, the variable genes were optimized for human cell expression and synthesized
by GenScript. VH and VL were inserted separately into plasmids (gWiz or pcDNA3.4) that
encoding the constant region for heavy chain and light chain respectively. Monoclonal antibodies
were expressed in Expi293 (ThermoFisher, A14527) by co-transfecting heavy chain and light
chain expressing plasmids using polyethylenimine (PEI, Linear, MV~25,000, Polysciences, Inc.
Cat. No. 23966) and culture in 37.0C degree shaker at 125RPM and 8% CO2. Supernatants were
collected on day 5, antibodies were purified by rProtein A Sepharose (GE, 17-1279-01) affinity
chromatography.
For H4, the antibody expression constructs were synthesized (Gene Universal Inc, Newark DE)
and subcloned into corresponding pVRC8400 vectors. To express the antibodies, equal among of
heavy and light chain plasmid DNA were transfected into Expi293F cells (Life Technology) by
using Turbo293 transfection reagent (Speed BioSystems). The transfected cells were cultured in
shaker incubator at 120 rpm, 37 °C, 9% CO2 for 5 days. Culture supernatants were harvested and
purified over Protein A (GE Health Science) resin in columns. Each antibody was eluted with IgG
elution buffer (Pierce), immediately neutralized with one tenth volume of 1M Tris-HCL pH 8.0.
The antibodies were then buffer exchanged in PBS by dialysis.
Antibody gene mutations were introduced by QuikChange II site directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent,
Cat. No. 200524)

Production of Fab from IgG
Fab fragments were produced from purified IgGs of monoclonal antibodies 2-15, 2-43 and H4 by
digestion with Papain in the presence of the reducing agent 30 mM cysteine and were purified by
affinity chromatography on protein A following the manufacturer’s protocols (Thermo fisher). The
purity of the resultant Fabs was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and buffer exchanged into SEC buffer
(10 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl) for crystallization experiments.

Binding Affinity Measurements by Surface Plasmon Resonance
The binding affinities of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined using surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) and a BIAcore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25°C. The anti-his
antibody was first immobilized onto two different flow cells of a CM5 sensorchip (BR100030,
Cyvita) surface using the His Capture Kit (28995056, Cyvita) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was then injected and captured on flow cells
2. Flow cells 1 was used as the negative control. A three-fold dilution series of antibodies with
concentrations ranging from 300 nM to 1.2 nM were injected over the sensor surface for 55
seconds at a flow rate of 50 µl/minute. The dissociation was monitored for 300 seconds and the
surface was regenerated with 10 mM Glycine pH 1.5 (BR100354, Cyvita). The running sample
buffer is 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% P-20 (HBS-EP+ buffer,
BR100826, Cyvita). The resulting data were fit to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore Evaluation
Software and were plotted using Graphpad (Graphpad Prism 7.01, San Diego).

Recombinant Indiana VSV (rVSV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 spikes were generated as
previously described (Han et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020). HEK293T cells were grown to 80%
confluency before transfection with pCMV3-SARS-CoV-2-spike (kindly provided by Dr. Peihui
Wang, Shandong University, China) using FuGENE 6 (Promega). Cells were cultured overnight at
37°C with 5% CO2. The next day, medium was removed and VSV-G pseudo-typed ΔG-luciferase
(G*ΔG-luciferase, Kerafast) was used to infect the cells in DMEM at an MOI of 3 for 1 hr before
washing the cells with 1X DPBS three times. DMEM supplemented with anti-VSV-G antibody
(I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC) was added to the infected cells and
they were cultured overnight as described above. The next day, the supernatant was harvested and
clarified by centrifugation at 300g for 10 min and aliquots stored at −80°C.
Neutralization assays were performed by incubating pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of
antibodies, and scored by the reduction in luciferase gene expression. In brief, Vero E6 cells were
seeded in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells per well. Pseudoviruses were incubated
the next day with serial dilutions of the test samples in triplicate for 30 mins at 37°C. The mixture
was added to cultured cells and incubated for an additional 24 hrs. The luminescence was
measured by Britelite plus Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer). IC50 was defined as the
dilution at which the relative light units were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control
wells (virus + cells) after subtraction of the background in the control groups with cells only. The
IC50 values were calculated using non-linear regression in GraphPad Prism.

Antibody gene assignments and genetic analyses
The 158 SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies were collected from ten publications. We
annotated these antibodies using IgBLAST-1.16.0 with the default parameters (Ye et al., 2013).

For antibodies which have cDNA sequences deposited, the V and J genes were assigned using
SONAR version 2.0 (https://github.com/scharch/sonar/) with germline gene database from IMGT
(Schramm et al., 2016, Lefranc et al., 2009). For each antibody, the N-addition, D gene, and Paddition regions were annotated by IMGT V-QUEST (Brochet et al., 2008). To identify somatic
hypermutations, each antibody sequence was aligned to the assigned germline gene using
MUSCLE v3.8.31 (Edgar, 2004). Somatic hypermutations were identified from the alignment. In
addition, the analysis of single cell antibody repertoire sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 patient 2
from (Liu et al., 2020), from which 2-15 and 2-43 were isolated, showed that 29 of the 38 unique
transcripts assigned to IGLV2-14*01 share nucleotide mutations G156T and T165G. These
mutations lead to amino acid mutations E50D and N53K. Both nucleotide mutations are also
observed in 82 of 90 unique IGLV2-14 transcripts from patient 1 of the same study. Because these
transcripts having different VJ recombination and paired with different heavy chain genes, the
chances that the two convergent mutations are the results of somatic hypermutation are very low.
Thus, we suspect that both donors contain a new IGVL2-14 gene allele (IGVL2-14*0X), which
was deposited to European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with project accession numbers:
PRJEB31020. 2-43 and 2-15 were assigned to the IGLV2-14*0X allele.

Cryo-EM data collection and processing
For mAb 2-43, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at a concentration of 2 mg/ml was incubated
with six-fold molar excess per spike trimer of the antibody Fab fragments for 30 minutes in 10 mM
sodium acetate pH 5.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM). 2µL of the
sample was incubated on C-flat 1.2/1.3 carbon grids for 30 seconds and vitrified using a Leica EM
GP. Data were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV, equipped with

a Gatan K3 direct electron detector and energy filter, using the Leginon software package
(Suloway et al., 2005). A total electron fluence of 51.69 e-/Å2 was fractionated over 40 frames,
with a total exposure time of 2.0 seconds. A magnification of 81,000x resulted in a pixel size of
1.058 Å, and a defocus range of -0.4 to -3.5 µm was used.
For mAb 2-15, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was incubated
with a molar ratio of 1:1 Fab fragments to spike trimer for 30 minutes in 10 mM sodium acetate
pH 5.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% % DDM. 2µL of the sample was incubated on C-flat 1.2/1.3
carbon grids for 30 seconds and vitrified using a Leica EM GP. Data were collected on a Titan
Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector
and energy filter, using the Leginon software package (Suloway et al., 2005). A total electron
fluence of 52.40 e-/Å2 was fractionated over 60 frames, with a total exposure time of 3.0 seconds.
A magnification of 81,000x resulted in a pixel size of 1.070 Å, and a defocus range of -0.8 to -3.4
µm was used.
For mAb H4, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was incubated with
eight-fold molar excess per spike trimer of the antibody Fab fragments for 30 minutes in 10 mM
sodium acetate pH 5.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% % DDM. 2µL of the sample was incubated on

All processing was done using cryoSPARC v2.15.0 (Punjani et al., 2017). Raw movies
were aligned and dose-weighted using patch motion correction, and the CTF was estimated using
patch CTF estimation. A small subset of approximately 200 micrographs were picked using blob
picker, followed by 2D classification and manual curation of particle picks, and used to train a
Topaz neural network. This network was then used to pick particles from the remaining
micrographs, which were extracted with a box size of 384 pixels.
For the mAb 2-43 dataset, 2D classification followed by ab initio modelling and 3D
heterogeneous refinement revealed 61,434 particles with three Fabs bound, one to each RBD. A
reconstruction of these particles with imposed C3 symmetry resulted in a 3.78 Å map, as
determined by gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC). Symmetry expansion followed by
masked local refinement was used to obtain a 3.81 Å map of the Fab and RBD. The remainder of
the S trimer was subjected to local refinement to obtain a 3.61 Å map. These two separate local
refinements were aligned and combined using the vop maximum function in UCSF Chimera
(Pettersen et al., 2004). This was repeated for the half maps, which were used along with the
refinement mask from the global non-uniform refinement to calculate the 3D FSC (ref) and obtain
an estimated resolution of 3.60 Å. All maps have been submitted to the EMDB with the ID EMD#####.
For the mAb 2-15 dataset, 2D classification followed by ab initio modelling and 3D
heterogeneous refinement revealed 16,590 particles with one Fab bound to an RBD in the ‘down’
conformation and 21,456 particles with one Fab bound to an RBD in the ‘up’ conformation. The
particles with Fab bound to RBD down were refined using Non-uniform refinement and C1
symmetry to a global resolution of 5.73 Å as determined by gold standard FSC. The RBD and Fab
were masked and subjected to local refinement to obtain a map at 6.21 Å. The remainder of the

trimer was also refined locally to 5.63 Å. A consensus map was obtained as described for mAb 243, with a resolution of 5.87 Å. All maps have been submitted to the EMDB with the ID EMD#####.
For the mAb H4 dataset, 2D classification followed by ab initio modelling and 3D
heterogeneous refinement revealed 102,290 particles with one Fab bound to an RBD in the ‘up’
conformation. No classes with Fab bound to ‘down’ RBD were identified. 3D Variability Analysis
was used to visualize the significant conformational heterogeneity of the ‘up’ RBD. Using the first
and last frames of the reaction coordinate as reference maps, representing the extremes of the
orientations adopted by the RBD, heterogeneous refinement was repeated to separate the Fabbound spikes into more homogeneous classes. 56,080 particles adopted a more stable conformation
and were refined to 4.78 Å using homogeneous refinement and C1 symmetry. Like the previously
described datasets, the Fab and RBD were refined locally to 5.03 Å, with the remainder of the S
trimer being refined to 4.32 Å. The final consensus map was estimated to have a resolution of 5.07
Å. All maps have been submitted to the EMDB with the ID EMD-#####.
Cryo-EM model building
An initial homology model of the 2-43 Fab was built using Schrödinger Release 20202:BioLuminate (Zhu et al., 2014) and of H4 using ABodyBuilder (Leem et al., 2016). For mAb 215, the crystal structure determined here (PDB ID ####) was used as a starting model for the Fab
variable domain and the associated RBD. For all models, the S trimer was modeled using the
coordinates from PDB ID 6XEY. These models were docked into the consensus map using
Chimera. The model was then fitted interactively using ISOLDE 1.0.1 (Croll, 2018) and COOT
0.8.9.2 (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and using real space refinement in Phenix 1.18 (Adams et al.,
2004). For Fab 2-43, in cases were side chains were not visible in the experimental data, they were

truncated to alanine except for residues very close to the RBD:Fab interface. Both H4 and 2-15
were built as poly-alanine models due to the low resolution of the experimental data. Validation
was performed using Molprobity (Davis et al., 2004) and EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015). Models
were submitted to the PDB with the following IDs: mAb 2-43 is 7L56, mAb H4 is 7L58, and 2-15
is 7L57. Figures were prepared using UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et al., 2018).
X-ray data collection, structure solution, model building and refinement
For determination of the complex of with RBD, the two proteins were mixed at 1:1 molar
ratio and incubated at 4.0°C for 60 min. RBD:2-15 complex was then isolated by gel filtration on
Superdex-200 (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing complexes were pooled and concentrated to
6.5 mg/ml in SEC buffer. Screening for initial crystallization conditions was carried out in 96-well
sitting drop plates using the vapour-diffusion method with a Mosquito crystallization robot (TTP
LabTech) using various commercially available crystallization screens. Diffracting crystals were
obtained from 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5 and 70% MPD. Crystals were directly frozen and X-ray
diffraction data was collected to 3.18 Å resolution at 100 K from a single flash-cooled crystal on
beamline ID-C at the Advance Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction
data were processed with XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and scaled using AIMLESS (Evans, 2006) from the
CCP4 software suite (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Molecular replacement was
performed with Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007), with previously reported RBD structure (PDB 7BZ5)
and Fab (PDB code, 4HK0) as search models. Manual rebuilding of the structure using COOT
(Emsley et al., 2010) was alternated with refinement using Phenix refine (Afonine et al., 2012) and
PDB-REDO (Joosten et al., 2014). The Molprobity server was used for structure validation and
PyMOL (version 2.1, Schrödinger, LLC) for structure visualization (Chen et al., 2010). A
summary of the X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S2. PISA was

used to identify paratope-epitope interfaces and to calculate buried surface area (Krissinel and
Henrick, 2007). Hydrogen bonds were identified with a cutoff of 3.8Å. 2-15 model was submitted
to the PDB with the following IDs: 7L5B.

Calculation of angle of approach
To measure the RBD approaching angle of antibodies, we first identify shared epitope
residues among the five members of the VH1-2 antibody class. PyMOL was used to determine the
centre of mass of the shared epitope residues. We then determined the center of mass for heavy
(the centre of mass of the conserved Cys at 22 and 92) and light chains (the centre of mass of the
conserved Cys at 23 and 88). The heavy and light chain approaching angle was determined by
linking the chain centre of mass to the centre of mass of the shared epitope. PyMOL was used to
make structure figures. For antibody B38, the epitope center of mass was determined using the
epitope residues of the antibody.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analyses for the pseudovirus neutralization assessments were performed
using GraphPad Prism. The SPR data were fitted using Biacore Evaluation Software. Cryo-EM
data were processed and analyzed using CryoSparc and Relion. Cryo-EM structural statistics were
analyzed with Phenix and Molprobity. Statistical details of experiments are described in Method
Details or figure legends.
