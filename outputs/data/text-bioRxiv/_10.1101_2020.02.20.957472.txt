Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential.
Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune
response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane
fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding
around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural
approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the
formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS
and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes
with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and
influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic
epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively
target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are
not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune
response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across
class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the
immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.

Main
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped pathogens responsible for multiple respiratory disorders
of varying severity in humans1. Certain CoVs represent a significant threat to global human
health, as illustrated by outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV) in 20032, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 20123, and
most recently of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan4. Given their mortality rates, the current lack of targeted
treatments and licensed vaccines, and their capacity to transmit between humans and across
species barriers5–10, there is an urgent need for effective countermeasures to combat these
pathogens. Ongoing vaccine development efforts have primarily focused on the spike (S)
proteins that protrude from the viral envelope and constitute the main target of neutralizing
antibodies11,12.
These trimeric S proteins mediate host cell entry with the S1 and S2 subunits
responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and facilitating membrane fusion,
respectively13–17. MERS S binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4)18, whereas SARS S19 and
2019-nCoV20 utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host cellular receptor. CoV
S proteins are the largest class I viral fusion proteins known15, and are extensively glycosylated,
with SARS and MERS S glycoproteins both encoding 69 N-linked glycan sequons per trimeric
spike with 2019-nCoV containing 66 sites. These extensive post-translational modifications
often mask immunogenic protein epitopes from the host humoral immune system by occluding
them with host-derived glycans21,22. This phenomenon of immune evasion by molecular
mimicry and glycan shielding has been observed and well characterised across other viral
glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 envelope protein (Env)23–25, influenza hemagglutinin (HA)26–28
and Lassa virus glycoprotein complex (LASV GPC)29–31.
Previous analyses of viral glycan shields have revealed the presence of
underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans that seemingly arise due to steric constraints that
prevent access of glycan processing enzymes to substrate glycans29,32,33, especially when the
viral glycoprotein has evolved to mask immunogenic epitopes with a particularly dense array
of host-derived glycans31,34. Restricted access to these glycan sites or interference with
surrounding protein surface or neighbouring glycan residues can render glycan processing
enzymes ineffective in specific regions32,33,35. Glycan processing on soluble glycoproteins has
also been shown to be a strong reporter of native-like protein architecture and thus immunogen

integrity36–38; and glycan processing on a successful immunogen candidate should therefore
mimic, as closely as possible, the structural features observed on the native virus39,40.
Here, we provide global and site-specific analyses of N-linked glycosylation on
soluble SARS, MERS and HKU1 CoV S glycoproteins and reveal extensive heterogeneity,
ranging from oligomannose-type glycans to highly processed complex-type glycosylation.
Mapping of these glycans onto the structures of the trimeric S proteins revealed that some of
these glycans contribute to the formation of a cluster of oligomannose-type glycans at specific
regions of high glycan density on MERS-CoV S. Molecular evolution analysis of SARS and
MERS S genes also reveals a higher incidence of amino-acid diversity on the exposed surfaces
of the S proteins that are not occluded by N-linked glycans. Additionally, we compare the
structures of the respective glycan coats of SARS and HIV-1 envelope proteins using cryogenic
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computational modelling, which delineate a sparse glycan
shield exhibited on SARS S compared to other viral glycoproteins. We therefore undertook a
comparative analysis of viral glycan shields from characterized class I fusion proteins to
highlight how glycosylation density influences oligomannose-type glycan abundance, and the
relationship between effective glycan shields and viral evasion ability. Together, these data
underscore the importance of glycosylation in viral immune evasion.

Results & Discussion
Glycan Processing of Trimeric SARS and MERS Spike Glycoproteins
In order to generate a soluble mimic of the viral S proteins, we used the 2P stabilised nativelike SARS and MERS S protein antigens, the design and structures of which have been
described previously by Pallesen et al.41. SARS, MERS and HKU1 S genes encode a large
number of N-linked glycan sequons 23, 23 and 29, respectively (Fig. 1A). We initially sought
to quantitatively assess the composition of the carbohydrate structures displayed on the S
glycoproteins. To this end, N-linked glycans were enzymatically released, fluorescently
labelled, and subjected to hydrophilic interaction chromatography-ultra-performance liquid
chromatography (HILIC-UPLC). Cleavage of the fluorescently labelled glycans by
endoglycosidase H (Endo H) revealed a population (SARS 32.2%; MERS 33.8%, HKU1
25.0%) of under-processed oligomannose-type glycans (Fig. 1B). This observation of both
complex and oligomannose-type glycans reveals that the majority of N-linked glycans are able
to be processed, although there is limited processing at specific sites across the S proteins. It is
also interesting to note that the distribution of oligomannose-type glycans was broad, with
Man5GlcNAc2 to Man9GlcNAc2 glycans all present, without one particular dominant peak, as
is the case for some viral glycoproteins, such as HIV-1 Env36. The proportion of oligomannosetype glycans on recombinant coronavirus S proteins is consistent with previous studies
performed on virally derived MERS and SARS coronavirus S proteins22,42. Coronaviruses have
been previously been reported to form virions by budding into the lumen of endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC)43–45. Observations of hybrid- and
complex-type glycans on virally derived material22,42 would, however, suggest that it is likely
that coronavirus virions travel through the Golgi apparatus after virion formation in the ERGIC
en route to the cell surface, thus supporting recombinant immunogens as models of viral
glycoproteins.
In order to ascertain the precise structures of N-linked glycans from the released
pool, the glycans of each coronavirus S protein were analysed by negative-ion ion-mobilityelectrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (IM-ESI MS) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent
with the UPLC data, IM-ESI MS confirmed an array of complex-type glycans ranging from
mono- to tetra-antennary, but also oligomannose- and hybrid-type glycans. The glycan
compositions characterised in the spectra were largely invariant among the coronaviruses with
no major structural differences observed.

(magenta) were identified by Endo H digestion, with quantification of major glycan types
summarised as a pie chart. Oligomannose-type glycans are schematically annotated with
mannose residues as green circles and GlcNAc residues as blue squares.

Structural Clustering of Underprocessed Glycans on MERS S Head Region.
Following UPLC and IM-ESI MS analysis of released N-linked glycans, we performed
glycopeptide analysis to ascertain the compositions of glycans present at all of the potential Nlinked glycosylation sites (PNGs). MERS, SARS and HKU1 recombinant S proteins were
reduced, alkylated and digested with an assortment of proteases to yield glycopeptides, which
were subjected to in-line liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This analysis
revealed that each site presents differential levels of oligomannose, hybrid, and complex-type
glycan populations (Fig. 2A & 2B). Using structures of the trimeric MERS and SARS S
proteins (PDB ID: 5X59 and 5X58, respectively), we generated models of fully glycosylated
coronavirus spikes using our experimentally determined glycan compositions (Fig. 3A and
3B). This analysis revealed that underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans on MERS S colocalize to a specific cluster on the head of the S protein, consisting of glycans at Asn155,
Asn166, and Asn236 (Fig. 3A). We hypothesized that the fully oligomannose-type glycan

population in this cluster arises due to the hindered accessibility of glycan processing enzymes
to access the substrate glycan33. As such, we performed mutagenesis to knock out glycosylation
sites with N155A, N166A, and N236A mutations. Site-specific analysis of these glycan-KO
mutants revealed enhanced trimming of mannose residues, i.e. increased processing, when
clustering of glycans was reduced (SI Fig. 4). The presence of clustered oligomannose-type
glycans is reminiscent of that found on other viral glycoproteins, including HIV-1 Env and
LASV GPC29,36,46.
Interestingly, SARS and HKU1 (SI Fig. 2) S proteins did not exhibit a specific mannose
cluster that contributes to the overall mannose abundance, but rather only isolated glycans were
underprocessed. We would speculate that the oligomannose-type glycans here arise from
protein-directed inhibition of glycan processing, as opposed to the glycan-influenced
processing observed on MERS. The presence of oligomannose-type glycans has also been
implicated in innate immune recognition of coronaviruses by lectins47,48 that recognise these
underprocessed glycans as pathogen-associated molecular patterns.
Given that the receptor binding domain is the main target of neutralising antibodies12,
it is surprising that the DPP4 receptor binding site of MERS S was not occluded at all by
glycans (Fig. 3A), as observed for other receptor-binding sites of class I viral fusion proteins,
including SARS S (Fig. 3B), HIV-1 Env49, LASV GPC29, and influenza HA50,51.

Sequence Diversification Occurs at Antibody-accessible Regions of CoV spikes
We hypothesized that solvent-accessible, amino-acid residues on S proteins would be
undergoing higher rates of mutations compared to buried residues and regions that are occluded
by glycans, which are unable to be targeted by host immune responses. To that end, we
performed an evaluation of amino-acid diversification on a residue-specific level, using
publicly available gene sequences of SARS and MERS S. Firstly, we found that amino-acid
diversity was elevated at known epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, such as the N9

terminal domain and the receptor binding domains, and reduced in the regions in the S2
domain, such as the fusion peptide, heptad repeat one, and the central helix domains, which are
likely subject to greater functional constraints (Fig. 4A).
Analysis of the relative ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide
substitutions (i.e. dN/dS ratios) revealed that exposed residues exhibited significantly higher
dN/dS values (Fig. 4B). Buried residues on SARS had mean dN/dS ratios of 0.31 compared to
2.82 for exposed resides. Likewise, the buried residues on MERS had a calculated dN/dS ratio
of 0.10 compared to exposed residues with a value of 0.45. Furthermore, when per-site aminoacid diversities were mapped onto the fully glycosylated structural model of the respective CoV
S proteins (Fig. 4C), hotspots of mutations were highlighted on the protein surface throughout
the trimer revealing extensive vulnerabilities permeating through the glycan shield of SARS
and MERS CoVs.
Although dN/dS estimates are comparable within each viral outbreak, they are not
directly comparable between viral families as they can only be considered in the environment
in which they are measured (i.e. multiple differences in transmission ecology and host-virus
interactions disallow meaningful comparisons). For example, differences in the epidemic
behaviour and host immune environment of MERS and SARS outbreaks likely contribute to
the observed genetic diversity and thus dN/dS. MERS was characterized by repeated spillover
events from camels into humans, where it circulated transiently. In contrast, the SARS outbreak
corresponded to a single zoonotic event followed by extensive human-to-human transmission.
Consequently, inferring the degree of selection acting upon MERS and SARS from dN/dS
analysis is extremely difficult.

Visualisation of HIV-1 Env and SARS S glycan shields by cryo-EM analysis
HIV-1 Env is a prototypic viral class I fusion protein that exhibits extensive surface
glycosylation, resulting in an effective glycan shield to aid evasion from the host adaptive
immune response25,52. In order to visualize the structure of the respective glycan “shields” of
HIV-1 and SARS coronavirus, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM),
as recently described53. The results for HIV-1 Env were reproduced from Berndsen et al.53
while the previously published SARS 2P dataset54 was reprocessed for this study. Although
cryo-EM datasets of fully glycosylated MERS S41 and chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIVcpz)55 are also available, only the HIV and SARS data were of sufficient quality
(Fig. 5). Using combination of low-pass filtering and thresholding, along with 3D variability
analysis, we can reveal the previously hidden structure of the SARS glycan shield and compare
it with the HIV-1 Env glycan shield53 (Fig. 5). We observe the nearly all-encompassing glycan
density on HIV-1 Env and evidence for extensive glycan-glycan interactions, especially in the
oligomannose patch regions, whereas the glycans on SARS S are more isolated and lack the
wide-ranging glycan networks that are the hallmark of an effective glycan shield56,57. The high
variability around the S1 receptor binding domains is indicative of their flexibility, which is
necessary for the spike to engage its receptor58; however, this intrinsic property complicates
the analysis of the signal from glycans in this region.

Comparison of Viral Glycosylation Reveals Disparate Shielding Efficacies
Viral envelope proteins are glycosylated to varying degrees, but depending on their overall
mass, surface area, and volume, the overall density of glycan shielding may differ significantly.
For example, both LASV GPC and coronavirus S proteins consist of 25% glycan by molecular
weight. However, given the significantly larger protein surface area and volume of coronavirus
S proteins, coverage of the glycan “shield” over the proteinaceous surface is considerably
sparser in comparison to the smaller LASV GPC, which occludes a far greater proportion of
the protein surface with fewer glycans. To demonstrate that the presence of glycosylation plays
a major role in the immune response to these different glycoproteins, we studied the glycome
of several biomedically important coronaviruses and compared their glycan compositions in a
structural context.
We then investigated the glycan shield densities of seven viral class I fusion proteins
using a global structural approach which was calculated by dividing the number of amino-acids
that interact with glycans by the number of solvent-accessible amino-acid residues of each
respective glycoprotein and plotted this against oligomannose abundance. A strong correlation
was observed (Fig. 6) and viruses historically classified as “evasion strong”59 had significantly
elevated glycan shield densities and oligomannose abundance, which underscores the
importance of glycan shielding in immune evasion.

Fig. 6. Comparison of the glycan shields of viral class I fusion proteins. Glycan shield densities
were calculated using Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies (PISA)60 analyses of
fully glycosylated models of SARS S, MERS S, HKU1 S, LASV GPC, HIV-1 Env (BG505),
Influenza H3N2 hemagglutinin (Victoria 2011), SIV Env (PDB ID 5X58, 5X59, 5I08, 5VK2,
4ZMJ, 4O5N, 6OHY, respectively)15,17,55,61–63. Oligomannose abundances of viral
glycoproteins were ascertained by HILIC UPLC analysis of PNGase F released N-linked
glycans that were fluorescently labelled with procainamide29,46,55 (SI Fig. 5). The number of
amino-acid residues interacting with N-linked glycans was divided by the number of solventaccessible amino-acid residues of the glycoprotein as a measure for global glycan shield
density. All viral glycoproteins analysed were expressed as trimers in HEK 293F cells apart
from LASV GPC, which was derived from virus-like particles from Madin-Darby canine
kidney II cells.

Whether the restricted glycan shielding observed on coronaviruses is linked to the
zoonosis of the pathogens is unknown. However, it is tempting to speculate, for example, that
MERS has not evolved a dense shield since it would not offer as much of a protective advantage
against camel nanobodies (also known as single-domain antibodies) which could more easily
penetrate it. Investigation of the host immune response to viruses in their natural reservoirs
may offer a route to understanding why coronavirus glycosylation does not reach the density
of other viruses such as HIV-1. Additionally, it may be that functional constraints, such as
maintaining flexibility of the receptor binding domains, limit the accretion of glycans on

coronavirus spikes, which would render it incapable of performing its primary functions,
including receptor binding and membrane fusion. This phenomenon has been observed on other
viral glycoproteins, including influenza HAs, where there is a limit to the accumulation of
glycosylation sites that can be incorporated in vivo64,65, compared to in vitro66, with H3N2 and
H1N1 HAs replacing existing PNGs rather than continually adding them upon the
glycoprotein26,65.
More topically, it is interesting to note the conservation of N-linked glycosylation sites
on S proteins from the novel coronavirus found in the Wuhan in 2019 and SARS (SI Fig. 6).
The Wuhan 2019-nCoV possesses a total of 22 N-linked glycan sites compared to 23 on SARS,
with 18 of these sites being in common. As such, it is likely that these glycans on this novel
coronavirus would shield similar immunogenic epitopes that are observed on SARS S. As
expected, most of the differences between the two viruses are observed on the S1 subunit, due
to its amenability to substitutions whilst still remaining functionally competent. Furthermore,
likely targets for the majority of antibodies targeting the spike are located on S1, resulting in
greater levels of immune pressure upon this subunit. This notion is further reflected in terms
of glycosylation, with all of the glycan sites conserved on the S2 subunit between SARS and
2019-nCoV, whereas the S1 subunit exhibits glycan site additions and deletions (SI Fig. 7).
Although it is difficult to directly compare viruses in terms of immunogenic responses,
on the one hand, SARS and MERS coronaviruses readily elicit neutralizing antibodies
following infection or immunization67–70. Indeed, many potential MERS CoV vaccine
candidates are able to elicit high titres of serum IgG upon immunization but fail to produce
sufficient mucosal immunity70. In contrast, the high mutation rate71 and the evolving glycan
shield of HIV-124, which firmly exemplifies it as “evasion strong” virus, hinders the
development of broadly neutralizing antibodies72.Viruses classified as “evasion strong”31,59
may then differ due to varied efficacies of protein surface shielding by glycans.
Overall, this study reveals how the extensive N-linked glycan modifications of SARS
and MERS CoV S proteins do not constitute an effective shield, which is reflected by the
overall structure, density and oligomannose abundances across the trimeric glycoproteins. We
also demonstrate that amino-acid diversification indeed occurs at antibody accessible regions
on the trimer, which confirms that glycans play a role in occluding specific regions if

number of viruses highlight the importance of a glycan shield in immune evasion and reveal
structural principles that govern glycosylation status.

Methods
Expression and purification of coronavirus spike glycoproteins.
Human embryonic kidney 293 Freestyle (HEK293F) cells were transfected with mammaliancodon-optimised genes encoding 2P-stabilised SARS MERS and HKU1 S proteins, as
previously described

41

. H3N2 Victoria 2011 hemagglutinin was also expressed in the HEK

293F cells. Cultures were harvested 6 days after transfection, filtered and purified by nickelaffinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography using a SuperdexTM 16/600 75 pg
column (GE Healthcare).
Release and labelling of N-linked glycans.
Excised coronavirus S gel bands were washed alternately with acetonitrile and water before
drying in a vacuum centrifuge. The bands were rehydrated with 100 μL of water and incubated
with PNGase F at 37 °C overnight. Aliquots of released N-linked glycans were also
fluorescently labelled with procainamide, by adding 100 μL of labelling mixture (110 mg/mL
procainamide and 60 mg/mL sodium cyanoborohydrate in 70% DMSO and 30% glacial acetic
acid) and incubating for 4h at 65 °C. Labelled glycans were purified using Spe-ed Amide 2
columns (Applied Separations), as previously described 33.
Glycan analysis by HILIC UPLC.
Labelled glycans were analysed using a 2.1 mm x 10 mm Acquity BEH Glycan column
(Waters) on an Acquity H-Class UPLC instrument (Waters), as performed previously 33, with
fluorescence measurements occurring at λex = 310 nm and λem = 370 nm. Quantification of
oligomannose-type glycans was achieved by digestion of fluorescently labelled glycans with
Endo H, and clean-up using a PVDF protein-binding membrane (Millipore). Empower 3
software (Waters) was used for data processing.
Mass spectrometry of glycans.
Ion-mobility electrospray ionisation MS and tandem MS of released N-linked glycans were
performed on a Synapt G2Si instrument (Waters) as previously described 46. N-linked glycans
were purified on a Nafion® 117 membrane (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to injection. Data acquisition

and processing were carried out using MassLynx v4.11 and Driftscope version 2.8 software
(Waters).
Mass spectrometry of glycopeptides.
Aliquots of 30-50 μg of coronavirus spikes were denatured, reduced and alkylated as described
previously36. Proteins were proteolytically digested with trypsin (Promega), chymotrypsin
(Promega), alpha-lytic protease (Sigma-Aldrich) and Glu-C (Promega). Reaction mixtures
were dried and peptides/glycopeptides were extracted using C18 Zip-tip (MerckMilipore)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid prior to
analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using an Easy-nLC 1200 system
coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Glycopeptides
were separated using an EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 μm x 75 cm) with a 240minute linear solvent gradient of 0-32% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, followed by 35
minutes of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Other settings include an LC flow rate of 200
nL/min, spray voltage of 2.8 kV, capillary temperature of 275 °C, and an HCD collision energy
of 50%. Glycopeptide fragmentation data were extracted form raw files using ByonicTM
(Version 3.5.0) and ByologicTM (Version 3.5-15; Protein Metrics Inc.). Glycopeptide
fragmentation data were manually evaluated with true-positive assignments given when correct
b- and y- fragments and oxonium ions corresponding to the peptide and glycan, respectively,
were observed. The extracted ion chromatographic areas for each true-positive glycopeptide,
with the same amino-acid sequence, were compared to determine the relative quantitation of
glycoforms at each specific N-linked glycan site.
Model construction.
Structural models of N-linked glycan presentation on SARS, MERS and HKU1 S were created
using electron microscopy structures (PDB ID 5X58, 5X59, and 5I08, respectively)15,17, along
with complex-, hybrid-, and oligomannose-type N-linked glycans (PDB ID 4BYH, 4B7I, and
2WAH). The most dominant glycoform presented at each site was modelled on to the N-linked
carbohydrate attachment sites in Coot73.
Molecular evolution analysis.
Publicly available sequences encoding full-length GPC spike gene for SARS-CoV (3765bp)
were downloaded from GenBank and manually aligned. For MERS-CoV, we leveraged the
whole genome alignment collated by Dudas et al.74.Specifically, the alignment corresponding

to the spike gene was extracted (4059bp), excluding sequences isolated from humans. Final
alignments for SARS- and MERS-CoV corresponded to 70 and 100 sequences, respectively.
For the dN/dS analysis, we first estimated Bayesian molecular clock phylogenies for SARSand MERS-CoV independently using BEAST v 1.8.475. For both viruses, we assumed an
uncorrelated log-normal distributed molecular clock76, Bayesian Skyline coalescent prior77 and
a codon-structured substitution model78 Multiple independent MCMC runs of 10-20 million
steps were executed to ensure stationarity and convergence had been achieved. Empirical
distributions of time-scaled phylogenies were obtained by combining (after the removal of
burnin) the posterior tree distributions from the separate runs, which were subsequently used
to estimate dN/dS ratios using the renaissance counting approach 79,80 implemented in BEAST
v 1.8.4. We also estimated per-site amino-acid diversity, which was calculated as the average
number of amino-acid difference between two sequences at an amino-acid position in all
possible pairs in the sequence alignment.
Cryo-EM data analysis and visualization
Single-particle cryo-EM data analysis of BG505 SOSIP.664 in complex with RM20A3 Fab
was reproduced from Berndsen et al.53. Data for the SARS-CoV S 2P ectodomain was
previously published54 and reprocessed for this analysis according to the methods outlined by
Berndsen et al.53. In summary, both datasets were acquired on a FEI Titan Krios (Thermo
Fisher) operating at 300 KeV equipped with a K2 Summit Direct Electron Detector (Gatan).
Movie micrographs were aligned and dose weighted with MotionCor281 and CTF estimation
was performed with Gctf82. Single-particle data processing was performed using CryoSparc
v.283 and Relion v.384. 3D variability analyses were performed in SPARX85,86. Map filtering
and visualisation was performed in UCSF chimera87.
Clustering analysis of viral glycan shields.
Interactions between N-linked glycans and amino-acid residues were calculated using Proteins,
Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies (PISA) European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)60.
Glycan shield density was calculated by the number of amino-acid residues interacting with
glycans divided by the total number of amino-acid residues.
