ABSTRACT

27

During the first months of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in a new host, contrasting hypotheses

28

have been proposed about the way the virus has evolved and diversified worldwide. The aim

29

of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human

30

outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2.

31

The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three

32

different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid

33

substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since

34

the virus emergence.

35

All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and trees topologies were in agreement

36

with those signals. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify

37

regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal,

38

since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones

39

presenting greater variability, was estimated to values of 1.37 x 10-3 and 2.19 x 10-3

40

substitution/site/year, respectively.

41

In conclusion, results obtained in this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions

42

and the determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand

43

essential feature of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow characterizing for the first

44

time, the evolutionary rate of S protein that is crucial for vaccines development.

Introduction

48

Coronaviruses belong to Coronaviridae family and have a single strand of positive-sense

49

RNA genome of 26 to 32 kb in length [1]. They have been identified in different avian hosts as

50

well as in various mammals including bats, mice, dogs, etc.

51

mammalian coronaviruses are identified. In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities

52

identified groups of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei Province,

53

China

54

hospitals using a surveillance mechanism for "pneumonia of unknown etiology"

55

pandemic has spread rapidly and, to date, more than 22 million confirmed cases and nearly

56

750,000 deaths have been reported in just over a six months period

57

spread raises interesting questions about the way its evolution is driven during the

58

pandemic. From the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16), 4 structural

59

proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N)], and other proteins

60

essential to complete the replication cycle are translated

61

information currently available allows knowing, as never before, the real-time evolution

62

history of a virus since its interspecies jump

63

characterized the viral genome and evolution by analyzing complete genomes sequences

64

[12,13,14,15]

65

information to characterize SARS-CoV-2, could not be established. This lack of information

66

prevent from investigating its molecular evolution and monitoring biological features affecting

67

the development of antiviral and vaccines. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a

68

comprehensive viral evolutionary analysis in order to describe the human outbreak and the

69

molecular evolution rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2.

Datasets

72

In order to generate a dataset representing different geographic regions and time evolution

73

of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from December 2019 to April 2020, data of all the complete

74

genome sequences available at GISAID (https: //www.gisaid.org /) on April 18, 2020 were

75

collected. Data inclusion criteria were: a.- complete genomes, b.- high coverage level, and

76

c.- human hosts only (no other animals, cell culture, or environmental samples). Complete

77

genomes were aligned using MAFFT against the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome

78

(NC_045512.2, EPI_ISL_402125). The resulting multiple sequence alignment (dataset 1)

79

was split in nine datasets corresponding to nine coding regions: a.- four structural proteins

80

[envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), Orf3a], b.- four nonstructural proteins (nsp1,

81

nsp3, Orf6, and nsp14), and c.- an unknown function protein (Orf8).

82

More than six thousand SARS-CoV-2 publicly available nucleotide sequences were

83

downloaded. After data selection according to the inclusion criteria, 1616 SARS-CoV-2

84

complete genomes were included in dataset 1. Sequences of this dataset 1 came from 55

85

countries belonging to the five continents as follow: Africa: 39 sequences, Americas: 383

86

sequences, Asia: 387 sequences, Europe: 686 sequences and Oceania: 121 sequences.

87

After elimination of sequences with indeterminate or ambiguous positions, the number of

88

analyzed sequences for each region were: nsp1, 1608; nsp3, 1511; nsp14, 1550; S, 1488;

89

Orf3a, 1600; E, 1615; Orf6, 1616; Orf8, 1612; and N, 1610. Finally, nucleotide sequences

90

were grouped by fortnight (FN) according to their collection date. Table 1 summarizes the

91

number of sequences per fortnight since the beginning of the pandemic up to FN 8. On the

92

other hand, Dataset 2 was created using only variable sequences of each region analyzed in

93

Dataset 1. Thus, Dataset 1 was used for the analysis of amino acid substitutions and

Results

145

Phylogenetic signal

146

Using bioinformatics tools, a phylogenetic signal study was carried out in order to identify the

147

most informative SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions. The likelihood mapping analysis showed

148

that most genes has very poor phylogenetic signal with high values in central region which

149

represents the area of unresolved quartets (Figure 1). Accordingly, genes could be

150

separated into three groups. A group with little or no phylogenetic signal (E, Orf6, Orf8, nsp1,

151

and nsp14), a second group with low phylogenetic signal (Orf3a and N), and a last group

152

with relatively more phylogenetic signal (S and nsp3) but still low to be considered a robust

153

one (unresolved quartets >40%).

154
155

Analysis of amino acid substitutions

156

The analysis of amino acids substitutions by fortnights was useful to study the viral

157

evolutionary dynamics in the context of the beginning of the pandemic. By analyzing different

158

time periods amino acid sequences, changes were observed in 5 out of 9 genomic regions

159

and only in 14 out of the 4975 (0.28%) evaluated residues. In most of the regions, except

160

nsp1, nsp14, E, and Orf6, 2 to 6 amino acids were selected since FN3 and remain

161

unchanged until the end of the follow up period (Table 2). Particularly, in Orf8 region, early

162

selection of two amino acid substitutions (V62L and L84S) was observed from FN2. On the

163

other hand, in the S region, the D614G substitution started with less than 2% in FN3 and

164

FN4 and reached 88% in the last fortnight. In a similar way, the Q57H (Orf3a) substitution

165

went from 6% to 34% while L84S (Orf8) start to be selected in FN2 and reached 6% by FN8.

166

The R203K and G204R substitutions of the N region was selected in FN4 and increased

167

their population proportion with values greater than 20% towards the end of the follow up

168

period. Moreover, selection of a great number of sporadic substitutions remaining in the

169

population for a short period (1-3 fortnights) was observed in the nine analyzed regions.

170

Indeed, 333 (6.83%) of the analyzed positions presented at least one substitution throughout

171

the eight fortnights. Table 3 summarizes the number of variable positions, number of

172

mutations, and number of sequences with mutations by region.

173
174

Bayesian coalescence analysis

175

In this study, trees were performed by Bayesian analysis instead of by distance, likelihood,

176

or parsimony methods. Consistently with the phylogenetic signal analysis, trees for nsp1, E,

177

and Orf6 showed a star-like topology. Nevertheless, different proportions of clades formation

178

could be observed in trees of Orf8, nsp14, Orf3a, N, S, and nsp3 regions (Figure 2). Finally,

179

from mentioned regions, nsp3 and S showed a better clade constitution. This analysis

180

allowed to differentiate regions presenting a diversification process (nsp3, nsp14, Orf3a, S,

181

Orf8, and N) from those that even after four months showed an incipient one (nsp1, E, and

182

Orf6). Furthermore, this nucleotide analysis is complemented by the previous study of amino

183

acid variations in each region. However, it is important to note that due to the low

184

phylogenetic signal observed for each region, results can only be considered as preliminary.

185
186

Evolutionary rate

187

Nsp3 and S sequences were selected to perform the evolutionary rate analysis since both

188

regions provided the best phylogenetic information among studied regions. The observed

189

evolutionary rate for nsp3 protein of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 1.37 x10-3 (ESS 782)

190

nucleotide substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) (95% HPD interval 9.16 x10-4 to 1.91 x10-3).

191

On the other hand, the corresponding figures for S were estimated to be 2.19 x10-3 (ESS

192

383) nucleotide s/s/y (95% HPD interval 3.19 x10-3 to 1.29 x10-3). In both genomic regions,

193

date-randomization analyses showed no overlapping between the 95% HPD substitution-

Discussion

198

The phylogenetic characterization of an emerging virus is crucial to understand the way the

199

virus and the pandemic will evolve. Thereby, a detailed study of the SARS CoV-2 genome

200

allows, on the one hand, to contribute to the knowledge of viral diversity in order to detect

201

the most suitable regions to be used as antivirals or vaccines targets. On the other hand, the

202

large amount of information that is continuously generated, is allowing studying the SARS

203

CoV-2 genome and describing a new viral real time evolution like never before.

204

In the present study, the molecular evolution and viral lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in nine

205

genomic regions, during eight successive fortnights, was analyzed using three different

206

approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and

207

Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation. In this context, the observed phylogenetic signals of

208

nine coding regions were very low and the obtained trees were consistent with this finding,

209

showing star-like topologies in some viral regions (nsp1, E, and Orf6). However, after a four

210

months evolution period, it was possible to identify regions (nsp3, S, Orf3a, Orf8, and N)

211

revealing an incipient formation of viral lineages, despite the phylogenetic signal, both at the

212

nucleotide and amino acid levels from FN3. Based on these findings, the SARS-CoV-2

213

evolutionary rate was estimated, for the first time, for the two regions showing higher

214

variability (S and nsp3).

215

As regards the phylogenetic signal, several simulation studies has proven that for a set of

216

sequences to be considered robust, the central and lateral areas representing the

217

unresolved quartets, must not be greater than 40%

218

analyzed regions met this requirement. Three regions (E, nsp1, and Orf6) presented values

219

of 100% unresolved quartets. Most regions (nsp14, Orf3a, Orf8, and N) reached values

220

higher than 85%. Only in regions nsp3 and S the number of unresolved quartets dropped to

221

~ 60%. Thus, despite being a virus with an RNA genome, the short time elapsed since its

[16]

. In this regard, none of the nine

11

222

emergence, and possibly genetic restrictions have led to a constrained evolution of SARS-

223

CoV-2 in these months. For this reason, it is expected that trees generated from SARS-CoV-

224

2 partial sequences in the first months of the pandemic are unreliable for defining clades.

225

Therefore, they should be analyzed with great caution.

226

Since Bayesian analysis allows to infer phylogenetic patterns from tree distributions, it

227

represents a more reliable tool to compare different evolutionary behaviors. Bayesian

228

analysis helps to obtain a tree topology that is closer to reality in the current conditions of

229

SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

230

confirmed the star-like topologies in accordance to a lower diversification of these regions

231

using the sequences available up to FN8 (Figure 2). Trees generated from nsp14 and Orf8

232

are at an intermediate point, where the formation of small clusters can be observed. In fact,

233

a mutation at position 28,144 (Orf8: L84S) has been proposed as a possible marker for viral

234

classification

235

best clade formation. Indeed, in the most variable regions nsp3 and S, it can be clearly seen

236

that sequences are separated into two large groups. Despite the aforementioned for the

237

nsp3 and S regions, even clusters with very high support values should be taken with

238

precaution and longer periods should be considered to obtain more accurate phylogeny

239

data. However, even when data are not the most accurate to study the spread or clade

240

formation [29, 30], they provide a good representation of the way the virus is evolving.

241

The analysis of amino acids frequencies allowed identifying different degree of region

242

conservation throughout the viral genome as a consequence of positive and negative

243

pressures. In particular, nsp3, S, Orf8, and N showed some substitutions in high

244

frequencies. This would indicate, as other authors previously report, the frequent circulation

245

of polymorphisms due to significant positive pressure

246

among candidates to be used in the formulation of vaccines and antibody treatment, it will be

. The phylogenetic analysis for nsp1, E, and Orf6 regions

247

important to monitor these substitutions in different geographic regions in order to improve

248

treatment and vaccination efficacy [32,33,34]. In particular, the appearance of the D614G variant

249

in the third week and its rapid increase until reaching a prevalence of 88% in the eighth week

250

could reflect an improvement in viral fitness, as several studies reported [35].

251

Contrarily, in regions nsp1, nsp14, E, and Orf6 no substitutions were selected and lasted

252

during the first 4 months of the pandemic. This would suggest that these are regions with

253

constraints to change due to the great negative selection pressure, as it has been recently

254

reported [13].

255

In the present study, the evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 genes was estimated by

256

analyzing a large number of sequences, which were carefully curated and had a good

257

temporal and spatial structure. Additionally, the most phylogenetically informative regions of

258

the genome (nsp3 and S) were used for analysis, reinforcing the results confidence.

259

Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 have reported similar data ranging from 1.79 x 10−3 to

260

6.58 x 10−3 s/s/y for the complete genome

261

complete genomes were used (N=32 and 54, respectively). As studies were performed early

262

in the outbreak and due to datasets temporal structure, analysis could have led to less

263

precise estimates of the evolutionary rate

264

Dorp et al. (2020), analyzing 7,666 sequences has obtained different results with a

265

remarkably low evolutionary rate (6 x 10-4 nucleotide/genome/year)

266

important to consider that van Dorp et al. (2020) estimate the evolutionary rate using the

267

complete genome, including several highly conserved genomic regions, while in our work,

268

the estimation was performed with the most variable regions of the genome. Additionally,

269

tests randomizing the dates of nsp3 and S datasets were carried out; they showed that these

270

partial genomic regions have enough temporal signal. In this context, our results (1.37 x 10-3

271

s/s/y for NSp3 and 2.19 x 10-3 s/s/y for S) are in close agreement with those published for

[6,36]

2004). Moreover, our values are in the same order magnitude as other RNA viruses

275

Even though we should be cautious with these results interpretation, the date-randomization

276

analysis indicated a robust temporal signal.

277

In addition, the importance of separately studying the evolutionary rate in S region arises

278

from the fact that it represents the main target for antiviral agents and vaccines since it

279

includes the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor domain (RBD), a crucial structure for the virus to

280

enter host cells and binding site for neutralizing antibodies [41].

281

Despite limitations of the evolutionary study of an emerging virus, where the selection

282

pressures are still low and therefore its variability is also low, this work has a great strength:

283

it lies on the extremely careful selection of a big sequence dataset to be analyze. First, it was

284

considered selected sequences to have a good temporal signal and spatial (geographic)

285

structure. Secondly, much attention was paid to the elimination of sequences with low

286

coverage and indeterminacies that could generate a noise for the phylogenetic analysis of a

287

virus that is beginning to evolve in a new host.

288

The appearance of a new virus means an adaptation challenge. The SARS-CoV-2 overcome

289

the spill stage and shows a significantly higher spread than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,

290

thus becoming itself the most important pandemic of the century. In this context, the results

291

obtained in this work about the variable diversity of nine crucial viral regions and the

292

determination of the evolutionary rate, are consequently decisive to understanding essential

293

feature of viral emergence. Nevertheless, monitoring SARS-CoV-2 population will be

294

required to determine the evolutionary course of new mutations as well as to understand the

295

way they affect viral fitness in human hosts.

Phylogenetic signal for SARS-CoV-2 datasets. Presence of phylogenetic signal was

475

evaluated by likelihood mapping, unresolved quartets (center) and partly resolved quartets

476

(edges) for genomes available on April 17 for the nine analyzed regions: nsp1 (29

477

sequences), nsp3 (225 sequences), nsp14 (65 sequences), S (183 sequences), Orf3a (74

478

sequences), E (11 sequences), Orf6 (12 sequences), Orf8 (23 sequences), and N (113

479

sequences). Presence of strong phylogenetic signal (<40% unresolved quartets) was not

480

reached for any region.

Comparison of the evolutionary rates estimated using BEAST for the original dataset and the

490

date-randomized datasets (312 sequences). This analysis was performed for regions nsp3

491

(5835nt) and S (3822nt). s.s.y = substitutions/site/year.
