ABSTRACT
Pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response; however, the precise
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly understood. Here we investigated
direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that
spike (S) protein potently induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1b,
TNFa, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such
inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and
neucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human lung epithelial
cells A549 also produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells
expressing S protein intracellularly are non-inflammatory, but elicit an inflammatory response in
macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation
via activation of the NF-kB pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation
of the NF-kB pathway is abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of
S protein induces IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Together these
data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that
TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus induced disease (COVID) 19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged as a major public health crisis since December 2019
(1-3). SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense single stranded RNA virus. Like other coronaviruses, such
as SARS (retrospectively named SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome
(MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes infection in the respiratory tract, leading to either
asymptomatic infection or a range of symptoms including cough, fever, pneumonia, respiratory
failure, along with other complications like diarrhea and multi-organ failure (4-7). In the absence
of effective therapies, COVID-19 has caused 1.8 million deaths worldwide by the end of 2020.
Although our knowledge is still evolving, immunopathology caused by cytokine storm plays a
decisive role in COVID-19 pathogenesis (4, 5, 8).

SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells through its Spike (S) protein, which binds to the receptor
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on alveolar epithelial cells, allowing
endocytosis of the viral particle (1, 9). Following endocytosis, the viral genome is replicated using
both viral and host machineries, leading to the death of virally infected cells (10). The pathology
of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung is further worsened with inflammatory responses of innate immune
cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, which are activated by viral components
and products of apoptotic and necrotic cells (3). While innate immune response is essential for
anti-viral host defense, excessive inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are cytotoxic for
respiratory epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells (11). Indeed, clinical manifestation of
COVID-19 is marked by higher levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNFa, IFNg, MCP1, MIP1a, IP-10,
and GMCSF in patient’s blood (3, 12, 13). Disease severity and death of COVID-19 patients have

been correlated to the elevated levels of IL-6 and TNFa (3, 14). However, our understanding of
the precise mechanism of induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines during SARSCoV-2 infection is very limited.

The innate immune inflammatory response is initiated with the recognition of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors
(TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs). Activated PRRs involve
multiple signaling adapters to activate transcription factors, such as NF-kB, AP1, and IRF3, which
regulate the expression of genes involved in immunity and inflammation. RNA sensing receptors
such as TLR7, RIG-I, and MDA5 play a central role in anti-viral immunity by inducing type I
interferons (IFNa and IFNb) via IRF3 and NF-kB(15-19). Although the relative contribution of
RNA sensing pathways in SARS-CoV-2-mediated immunopathology is yet to be explored,
previous studies reported that macrophages and dendritic cells infected with SARS-CoV-1 produce
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but not type I interferons (20, 21). Consistently,
inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by high levels of
proinflammatory cytokines, but poor type I interferon response (8, 14). Beyond these phenotypic
observations, the precise mechanism of the hyperinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2
infection is poorly understood.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus consisting of four major structural proteins – S, nucleocapsid
(N), membrane (M), and envelop (E) (22). S protein binds to the receptor binding domain of ACE2
through its S1 subunit allowing proteasomal cleavage of S protein and fusion of the S2 subunit
with the host cell membrane (9, 10, 23-25). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins are likely to be

exposed to PRRs located on the cell membrane, endosome, and cytosol of the infected cell.
However, our knowledge on the role of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in the innate immune
response is very limited. Here, we investigated inflammatory properties of S, M, N and E proteins
and revealed that S protein, but not M, N, and E proteins, is a potent viral PAMP, which stimulates
macrophages, monocytes, and lung epithelial cells. We demonstrated that S protein is sensed by
TLR2, leading to the activation of the NF-kB pathway and induction of inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines. This study provides critical insight into molecular mechanism that may contribute
to cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 S protein induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in macrophages
and monocytes
Macrophages play a central role in hyperinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2
infection(26). To understand whether SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins can activate macrophages
and monocytes, we stimulated human monocytic cell THP1-derived macrophages with
recombinant S1, S2, M, N and E proteins. Interestingly, both S1 and S2 proteins induced
proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNFa, and IL-1b, with S2 being more potent, as measured by
real-time PCR and ELISA (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). Chemokines produced by macrophages
and monocytes recruit T cell and other immune cells in the inflamed tissue, aggravating
inflammatory damage(4, 26). Both S1 and S2 subunits of S protein induced chemokines including
CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2 in THP1 cells (Figure 1A). Three other structural proteins - M, N and
E – did not induce any cytokines and chemokines (Figure 1A). Interferons are critical for adaptive
immune response and anti-viral immunity (16). However, THP1 cells did not express either type

I (IFNa and IFNb) and Type II (IFNg) interferons in response to any of the SARS-CoV-2 structural
proteins (Figure 1A). Notably, THP1 cells are not defective in producing interferons when
activated by PolyI:C, a ligand for TLR3 (Figure S1B).

The expression of cytokines and chemokines in response to S protein was dose dependent (Figure
1B). Similarly, S protein-induced inflammatory response was time dependent, with highest being
at 8h post stimulation (Figure 1C). Notably, heat-denatured S2 protein failed to stimulate THP-1
cells, confirming the specificity of S protein and requirement of its native structural configuration
in inducing inflammatory response (Figure S1C). To obtain a direct evidence that S protein can
induce inflammatory mediators in human immune cells, we stimulated human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (hPBMC) with S2. There was robust induction of IL1b, IL6, TNFa, CXCL1,
and CXCL2 in hPBMC at 4 h post stimulation (Figure 1D).

SARS-CoV-2 do not infect mouse cells since S protein cannot bind mouse ACE2 receptor. To
understand whether recognition of S protein by ACE2 is required for induction of inflammatory
molecules, we stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDMs) with S1 and S2.
Interestingly, both S1 and S2 proteins stimulated mBMDMs, expressing Il6, Il1b, Tnfa, Cxcl1 and
Cxcl2 (Figure S2A). Similar to THP1 cells, mBMDMs did not produce type I and Type II
interferons in response to S protein (Figure S2A). Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells
also responded to S2 protein, producing Il6, Tnfa, and Il1b (Figure S2B). Taken together, SARSCoV-2 S protein potentially induces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in macrophages
and monocytes.

Epithelial cells produce inflammatory mediators in response to SARS-CoV-2 S protein
SARS-CoV-2 primarily infect epithelial cells of the lung, kidney, intestine, and vascular
endothelial cells (9, 27-29). However, it is poorly understood whether SARS-CoV-2-infected
epithelial cells produce proinflammatory cytokines and contribute to cytokine storm of COVID19 patients. To address this concern, we stimulated human lung cancer epithelial cells A549 and
human embryonic kidney epithelial cells HEK293T cells with S1 or S2 proteins. However, there
was no induction of IL6, IL1b, TNFa, CXCL1, and CXCL2 in either of the epithelial cells in
response to S proteins at 4 h post stimulation (Figure S3). Given that epithelial cells are weaker
than innate immune cells in expressing inflammatory mediators, we wondered whether the
expression of inflammatory molecules in A549 cells is delayed. We, therefore, measured cytokines
and chemokines in A549 cells following stimulation with S1 and S2 at 12 and 24h. Interestingly,
both S1 and S2 proteins induced proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL1b, TNFa, and chemokines
CXCL1 and CXCL2, with highest being at 24h post stimulation (Figure 2A). IFNg, but not Type I
interferons, was poorly induced by S2 protein in A549 cells (Figure 2A).

We next verified whether cytosolic S protein can stimulate inflammatory response in epithelial
cells. Therefore, we transfected HEK293T and A549 cells with plasmids expressing flag-tagged S
protein or green florescent protein (GFP). The expression of S protein in HEK293T and A549 cells
was confirmed by Western blotting and ELISA (Figure S4A-C). However, cytosolic expression
of S protein did not induce any cytokines and chemokines in HEK293T cells or A549 cells (Figure
2B and 2C). These data suggest that intracellular S protein does not induce inflammatory
responses in epithelial cells.

Epithelial cells expressing S protein trigger inflammation in macrophages
Since airway and other epithelial cells are primary target of SARS-CoV-2, we wondered whether
virally infected epithelial cells trigger inflammatory response in macrophages and monocytes in a
paracrine manner. To address this concern, we collected culture supernatant of HEK293T-S cells
or A549-S cells and added (30% V/V) into the culture medium of THP1 cells (Figure 3A).
However, culture supernatants of S protein-expressed epithelial cells failed to induce cytokines
IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa in THP1 cells (Figure 3B and 3C). In fact, S protein was not detectable
in the culture supernatant of HEK293T and A549 cells expressing S protein (Figure S4C). Flow
cytometric analysis suggested that S protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm, not on the cell
surface (Figure S4D).

We then sought to examine whether innate immune cells become activated when they physically
interact with S protein-expressed epithelial cells. Hence, we co-cultured HEK293T-S or A549-S
cells with THP1 cells at 1:2 ratio (Figure 3D). Impressively, inflammatory cytokines were
appreciably induced in co-cultured cells (Figure 3E-F). We confirmed protein levels of IL-6, IL1b, and TNFa in the culture supernatant of co-cultured cells by ELISA (Figure 3G and H).
Notably, similar to Figure S4A-C, S protein was not detected in the culture supernatant of cocultured cells as measured by ELISA (data not shown), suggesting that THP1 cells are activated
by S protein-transfected epithelial cells through an unknown mechanism. To further confirm that
S protein expressing epithelial cells can stimulate macrophages, we lysed HEK293T-S cells, and
added the cell lysate to THP-1cells in culture (Figure S5A). Lysates of HEK293T-S cells
efficiently induced inflammatory cytokines in THP-1 cells while no such induction was observed
in response to cell lysate of HEK293T-GFP (Figure S5B). Together, these data imply that SARS-

CoV-2 infected epithelial cells may stimulate macrophages and monocytes in a paracrine manner
to produce inflammatory mediators.

S protein activates the NF-kB pathway
Inflammatory genes are transcriptionally regulated by transcription factors that are activated by
signaling pathways such as NF-kB, MAPK, STAT3, and AKT. To obtain further insight into how
S protein induce the expression of inflammatory mediators, we stimulated THP1 cells with S2
protein. Cell lysates collected at various times following stimulation were analyzed for the
activation of these inflammatory pathways by western blotting. As shown in Figure 4A, P65 and
IkB were phosphorylated in cells treated with S2 protein. The activation of NF-kB pathway is
often accompanied by the activation of MAPK pathways, including ERK, P38 and JNK.
Surprisingly, there was no activation of ERK and JNK in S2 stimulated cells (Figure 4A). There
was no activation of the AKT pathway as well (Figure 4A), while STAT3 was phosphorylated at
2h following stimulation (Figure 4A). Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, can activate STAT3;
thus, the observed activation of STAT3 could be a secondary response of S protein-mediated
activation of the NF-kB pathway. S2 protein also activated the NF-kB and STAT3 pathways in
A549 cells (Figure 4B). To confirm that S protein-induced inflammation was NF-kB dependent,
we inhibited the NF-kB pathway using Sc514, an inhibitor of IKKb, during stimulation with S
protein. As expected, inhibition of the NF-kB pathway abrogated inflammatory responses in S
protein-stimulated macrophages (Figure 4C and D).

S protein-mediated activation of the NF-kB pathway is TLR2 dependent

Upon recognition of diverse PAMPs at the cell surface or in the endosome, TLRs activate the NFkB and MAPK pathways through the adapter protein MyD88. To verify if TLR pathways are
involved in S protein-mediated activation of the NF-kB pathway, we stimulated WT and Myd88-/BMDM with S2. Interestingly, there was no activation of the NF-kB pathway in Myd88-/- BMDM
(Figure 5A). Consistently, there was no cytokine expression in Myd88-/- macrophages upon
stimulation with S protein (Figure 5B). This observation suggests that S protein-mediated
activation of the NF-kB pathway involves TLR/MyDD88. We then interrogated which TLR sense
S protein. Since S is a glycoprotein, we anticipated that TLR2, a receptor for lipoprotein, or TLR4,
which senses lipopolysaccharide and several other stimuli (18), could be the immune sensor for S
protein. Therefore, we stimulated Tlr2-/- and Tlr4-/- BMDMs with S2 protein and measured the
activation of the NF-kB pathway. There was no activation of the NF-kB pathway in Tlr2-/- BMDM,
while activation of this pathway was intact in Tlr4-/- macrophages (Figure 5C). We confirmed that
Tlr2-/- macrophages were defective in sensing Pam3CSK4, a ligand for TLR2, while they were
fully responsive to TLR4 ligand LPS (Figure S6). Similar to S2, S1 protein activated the NF-kB
pathway in WT macrophages but not Tlr2-/- macrophages (Figure 5D). Consistent with the
defective activation of the NF-kB pathway, there was no induction of proinflammatory cytokines
in S2-stimulated Tlr2-/- macrophages (Figure 5E), suggesting that S protein induces inflammatory
molecules via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-kB pathway.

Finally, to understand whether S protein induce inflammation in vivo and what role TLR2 plays,
we administered S1 and S2 proteins into WT or Tlr2-/- mice intraperitoneally (i.p.). 16h following
administration of S protein, we measured the cytokine IL-6, IL-1b and TNFa in the blood by
ELISA before and after challenge with S protein. As shown in Figure 5F, the concentrations of

IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa were elevated following S protein administration in WT mice, whereas no
such induction of these cytokines was observed in Tlr2-/- mice (Figure 5F). Together, these data
suggest that TLR2 is the immune sensor for SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which potentially triggers
inflammatory responses through the activation of the NF-kB pathway.

DISCUSSION
Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and aberrant host immune responses are responsible for COVID-19
pathogenesis (4, 5, 8, 26). The initial host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection
involves innate immune cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells
(30, 31). Cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators produced by these cells inhibit
virus replication, heal the damage, and activate the adaptive immune system. However,
uncontrolled release of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species often
exert pathological consequences such as tissue injury, systemic inflammation, and organ failure
(4, 5, 8). Non-surviving COVID-19 patients exhibited massive influx of macrophages and
neutrophils, but reduced T cells in their blood (30), pointing to the association of hyperactivation
of innate immune cells with COVID-19 pathogenesis. Indeed, innate immune response is
heightened in the lung of COVID-19 patients(31, 32). A better understanding of the mechanism
through which SARS-CoV-2 stimulates innate immune cells and activates inflammatory signaling
pathways are key to finding better treatment regimens for COVID-19. Our finding that SARSCoV-2 S protein is a potent viral PAMP involved in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines via TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-kB pathway, therefore, is a valuable
addition to the tremendous scientific effort aiming at combating COVID-19.

Being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 may activate RNA sensors TLR7, RIG-I and MDA5, which
primarily responsible for production of type I interferons (17). Interestingly, type I interferon
response is attenuated in COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (8, 14).
Transcriptomic analysis of bonchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
COVID-19 patients also demonstrated higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, but not type I interferons (32). Our knowledge on type I interferon response of SARSCoV-2 infected macrophages is limited. However, previous studies on SARS-CoV-1, which share
80% similarity with SARS-CoV-2, showed that macrophages and dendritic cells infected by
SARS-CoV-1 produce chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2, but not type I interferons (20, 21). Lack
of an interferon response can be explained by the fact that several structural and non-structural
proteins including M, N, PLP, ORF3b, ORF6, and NSP1 inhibit type I interferon signaling (3338). Despite this evidence, the precise mechanism of excessive production of inflammatory
cytokines along with reduced of type I interferons in COVID-19 patients remains elusive. In this
regard, our findings that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a potential trigger for proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines help understand why inflammatory response of COVID-19 is marked
by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but poor type I interferon
response. Our findings suggest that S protein of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 shares similar
inflammatory function (39, 40). Further studies are required to clarify relative contribution of S
protein, viral RNA, and other non-structural proteins in COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.

Inflammatory responses of COVID-19 patients are mostly implicated to innate immune cells, but
they weakly express ACE2 (41). There is no strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infect and
propagate in immune cells. Thus, it is intriguing how innate immune cells become activated to

produce inflammatory mediators during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose three mechanisms
involved in hyperinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, innate immune cells
like macrophages and monocytes recognize S protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the cell surface through
TLR2, leading to the activation of the NF-kB pathway. Immune sensing of S protein is likely
independent of ACE2 since mouse macrophages, whose ACE2 receptor does not bind to S protein,
express inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to S protein. Second, innate immune
cells get activated by virally infected epithelial cells. Our data suggest that epithelial cells
expressing S protein in the cytosol can activate macrophage when they physically interact.
Although the underlying mechanism is not clear, macrophage may engulf or recognize cell surface
molecule expressed on SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells. In a third mechanism, like myeloid
cells, epithelial cells can be activated by S protein extracellularly, leading to the induction of
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Although inflammatory responses of epithelial cells
are weaker than that of innate immune cells, epithelial cell-derived chemokines recruit neutrophils,
monocytes and lymphocytes in SARS-CoV2-infected lungs and thereby contribute to
immunopathology of COVID-19 patients.

Our data demonstrate that TLR2 is the innate immune sensor for the S protein. Like other MyD88dependent TLR pathways, ligation of TLR2 leads to the activation of transcription factors NF-kB
and AP-1 (17). Interestingly, while there was activation of NF-kB, AP-1 upstream signaling
kinases such as ERK and JNK were not seen activated by S proteins. SARS-CoV-1 S protein
activates the NF-kB pathway in human monocyte derived macrophages (39, 40). COVID-19
patients also exhibited increased activation of the NF-kB pathway (14). Interestingly, in contrast
to these findings, a separate study reported that SARS-CoV-1 S protein expressing baculovirus

activates AP-1 but not NF-kB in A549 cells (42). Future studies dissecting the signaling pathway
regulated by S protein of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 may reveal further insight.

In summary, this study documents a potential mechanism for the inflammatory response induced
by SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a potent viral PAMP that upon
sensing by TLR2 activates the NF-kB pathway, leading to the expression of inflammatory
mediators in innate immune and epithelial cells. The effort so far in combating the COVID-19
pandemic is unprecedented, making it possible for the development of a number of vaccines within
a year of outbreak. Since S protein is being targeted by most of the vaccine candidates, it is
important to consider its inflammatory function in vaccine design. Considering the fact that new
variants of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations in the S protein spread more easily and may confer more
severe disease, the effectiveness of current vaccines remain uncertain (43). Thus, the importance
of developing therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 remains high. This study suggests that TLR2 or its
downstream signaling adapters could be therapeutically targeted to mitigate hyperinflammatory
response in COVID-19 patients.

Culture of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM)
Mouse bone marrow cells were collected as described previously (44). Bone marrow cells were
cultured in L-cell-conditioned IMDM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential
amino acid, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 6 days to differentiate into macrophages. BMDMs
were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates at a concentration of 1.2x106 cell/well and incubated
overnight before in vitro studies. BMDMs were stimulated as described above.
cDNA constructs and transient transfection
At 50 – 60 % confluency, HEK293T and A549 cells were transfected with GFP-Flag (VB2005072985cmv) or SARS-CoV-2 S-Flag (VB200507-2984jyv) (1.5 µg/ml) constructs using
Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer`s instructions, and confirmed
by observing GFP under fluorescence microscope and western blot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S
and Flag proteins. 48h post transfection, cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer containing
complete protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for the detection
of S protein by western blot or ELISA, or resuspended in TRIzolÔ reagent (Invitrogen) for the
isolation of RNA and subsequent measurement of S mRNA by real-time qPCR.
In-vitro stimulation of epithelial cells
To examine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on inflammatory responses in epithelial cells,
HEK293T and A549 cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 S1 (RayBiotech, 230-30161),
SARS-CoV-2 S2 (Ray Biotech, 230-30163) for 4 hrs. RNA was isolated and measured for the
expression inflammatory genes by real-time PCR

Co-culture of macrophages and epithelial cells
HEK293T-GFP and HEK293T-SARS-CoV-2 S or A549-GFP and A549-SARS-CoV-2 S cells
were cultured with THP-1 macrophage-like cells in a ratio of 1:2 (macrophages were twice in
number to epithelial cells). Following 16h of co-culture, culture medium was collected, filtered
with 0.2 µM filter, and used for ELISA. RNA was isolated and measured for the expression
inflammatory genes by real-time PCR.
Stimulation of macrophages with conditioned medium of S-protein expressed epithelial cells
At 50 – 60 % confluency, HEK293T and A549 cells were transfected with GFP-Flag or SARSCoV-2 S-Flag (1.5 µg/ml) constructs using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer`s instructions, and confirmed by observing GFP under fluorescence microscope and
western blot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and Flag. 48h post-transfection, culture medium
(conditioned medium) was collected, filtered with 0.2 µM filter and store at -80 ºC. At about 85%
confluency, culture medium of macrophage like THP-1 cells were replaced with new media
containing 30% (V/V) of epithelial cell conditioned medium. After 4 h incubation with conditioned
medium, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured.
Real-time PCR
Epithelial cells, BMDMs, and THP-1 macrophage-like cells, RAW264.7 cells were lysed in
TRIzolÔ reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzolÔ reagent (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using
iScript (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix

Primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S1.
In-vitro studies with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
Human PBMCs were obtained from STEMCELLÔ TECHNOLOGIES (70025), and were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (R8758, Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma) and
1% (v/v) PenStrep (Sigma) and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. After 48 h, hPBMCs
were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium for 3 h, and then stimulated with SARS-CoV2 S (500ng/mL) for 4 hrs.
Inflammatory response of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mice
WT and Tlr2-/- mice were intraperitoneally injected with S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S
protein at equal concentration (1ug each/mouse). Blood was collected before S protein
administration by cheek puncturing. 15 h following treatment, mice were sacrificed, and blood
was drawn from the heart. Serum was separated from the blood by centrifugation and used for the
measurement of cytokines by ELISA.
ELISA
BMDMs and THP-1 macrophage-like cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer supplemented with
complete protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Protein concentration
was measured by the PierceÔ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific-23227). Serum was
isolated from mouse blood by centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 min at 4ºC. The concentration

Figure 2. Lung epithelial cells produce inflammatory molecules in response to SARS-CoV-2
S protein. (A) A549 cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S2 (500 ng/ml) protein for 12 and
24h. RNA was isolated and measured for the expression of inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines. (B-C) SARS-CoV-2 S protein was overexpressed in HEK293T and A549 cells. 48h
following transfection with expression plasmids, the mRNA levels of IL6, IL1b, TNFa, CXCL1,
and CXCL2 were measured. Data represent mean ± SD (n=3). Experiments were repeated two
times and data of a representative experiment is presented.

Figure 3. Macrophages get stimulated by epithelial cells expressing S protein. (A-C) SARSCoV-2 S2 protein was overexpressed in either HEK293T or A549 cells. Forty eight hours
following transfection with S2 or GFP plasmids, cell culture supernatants were collected and added
into THP1 cell cultures at 30% V/V. (B-C) 4h post incubation, the expression of IL6, IL1b, and
TNFa in THP1 cells treated with culture supernatant of HEK293T (B) or A549 (C) was measured
by real-time qPCR. (D) HEK293 or A549 cells expressing S protein were co-cultured with THP1
cells at 1:2 ratio for 16 h. (E-F) The expression of IL6, IL1b, and TNFa were measured by realtime PCR. (G-H) Protein levels of IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa in culture supernatant described in D
