Abstract
Despite global efforts, there are no effective FDA-approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Potential therapeutics focus on repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. Here we
report on a preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess
cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a
mock clinical trial. The MPS contained human heart muscle derived from patient-specific induced
pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug response was measured using outputs that correlate with
clinical measurements such as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing.
Chronic exposure to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and increased QT interval
from day 6 onwards. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from day 7 onwards and arrhythmias
were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results closely mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon
chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4-8..
Interestingly, a decrease in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to
monotherapy, in concordance with published clinical trials. Furthermore, biomarkers, most of them
measurable in patients’ serum, were identified for negative effects of single drug or polytherapy on
tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection.
The cardiac MPS can predict clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and rhythm
instabilities. This high content system can help clinicians design their trials, rapidly project cardiac
outcomes, and define new monitoring biomarkers to accelerate access of patients to safe COVID-19
therapeutics.

Introduction
When the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic on March 11th 2020, little was known
about the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was
described and treated as a respiratory disease, in which the virus targeted the epithelial cells of the
respiratory tract, resulting in alveolar damage, edema and fibrosis. Now, with more than 45 million
cases and a million deaths worldwide, there is clinical evidence that the virus also has non-negligible
long-term effects on multiple organs, including heart, kidney, vasculature, liver and even brain[1-7].
With the absence of FDA-approved medicines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19, clinicians
have been pressed to treat patients in critical stages without FDA approved protocols. They have
therefore relied on several small scale clinical studies to repurpose compounds approved by regulatory
bodies as monotherapies in the hope of improving patient outcomes. Early clinical trials identified
chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) as promising drugs to help treat
or reduce the effects of SARS-CoV-2 [8-12]. A non-randomized clinical trial in France identified HCQ, in
combination with AZM, as being capable of significantly reducing respiratory viral loads [8]. This was
confirmed by more recent retrospective studies[13, 14], but was also heavily criticized and refuted by
other recent studies employing a priori designs[15-18]. Several additional small clinical trials have
shown mixed outcomes for HCQ treatment of COVID-19 patients[19].
A serious concern with these studies is that patients were treated with drugs that have known cardiac
complications, and their effects on the heart in polytherapy were unknown. HCQ inhibits hERG (IKr)
potassium channels, it is known to increase in QT interval of cardiomyocytes, and can induce
arrhythmias that are responsible for sudden death [20]. AZM is also associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular death, due to Torsade de Pointes (TdP) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [21].
With respect to polytherapy, clinical trials have demonstrated a synergistic effect of HCQ and AZM to
prolong QT interval [22, 23]; however, alterations in arrhythmic event frequency were controversial
when compared to HCQ or AZM alone.

In the absence of rapid clinical trials for polytherapy safety, there is an urgent need for screening tools
to increase the speed at which potential therapeutics are evaluated for cardiac liabilities. Common in
vitro systems used for cardiac drug screening include cell 2D monolayers and animal testing, which
often fail to replicate human physiology, particularly electrophysiology, and pharmacokinetic properties
[24]. Engineered heart tissue, organoids or microfluidic-based microphysiological system are emerging
alternatives for state-of-the-art drug screening [25, 26]. With the rapid spread of COVID-19,
microphysiological systems (MPS) have recently shown to be a promising tool to study virus entry and
replication mechanisms, subsequent cytokine production, as well as effects of existing and novel
therapeutics or vaccines [27, 28].
In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of a cardiac MPS (Figure 1) for determining the cardiac liability
associated with HCQ and AZM polytherapy in an in vitro design analogous to a Phase I safety clinical
trial. Our cardiac MPS contains a three-dimensional (3D) cell chamber in which human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are confined and self-assemble to form
uniaxially beating heart muscle [24, 29]. HiPSC-CMs have been successfully used for in vitro
assessment of drug-induced arrhythmias, especially since they respond consistently to hERG channel
block (QT prolongation and arrhythmias) and calcium channel block (action potential duration
shortening, impaired contractile function) [6, 30]. It makes them excellent candidates to screen for
cardiac liability of HCQ and AZM, both of which are known to block hERG channels, and also act upon
other cardiac ion channels[31]. By assaying hiPSC-CMs expressing a genetically encoded calcium
sensor (GcAMP6f), loaded with a voltage-sensitive fluorescent probe (BeRST), we assessed the
electrophysiology and calcium handling of the tissues during serial drug exposures. We showed that
HCQ and AZM significantly increase 80% repolarization time (APD80) and rhythm instabilities, starting
at clinically relevant exposure days, and were accompanied with EAD and TdP instances. HCQ+AZM
combination also showed a significant increase in APD80, however, few instabilities or arrhythmic
events were observed. Finally, proteomics analysis of cell culture effluent enabled detection of

biomarkers that were directly correlated with cardiotoxicity, apoptosis and contraction mechanics
alteration.

Results and Discussion
Chronic exposure to HCQ for 10 days resulted in QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities that
correlated with arrhythmic events and clinical observations
Chronic exposure to an HCQ dose mimicking clinical protocols decreased the beat rate starting at day
4 with a statistically signifcant decrease on days 4, 7 and 8 (Figure 2A). APD80 increased markedly
from day 7 onwards (Figure 2B), with the maximum APD80 increase reaching 850ms. All but one tissue
exhibited an APD80 at least 400 ms longer on day 7 and day 9 than prior to HCQ exposure. These
arrhythmogenic changes to the AP were tightly correlated with the appearance of instabilities in the
HCQ tissues from day 5 onwards (Figure 3A). APD80 was directly correlated to calcium transient
duration (CaD) (Supp. Figure 1D), and an increase of CaD80 above 600ms was observed at day 2 and
increased over the duration of HCQ treatment. Arrhythmic events began appearing at day 4 in 50% of
the tissues. At day 7, tissues exhibited both arrhythmogenic AP waveforms and CaD80 increase, and by
days 9 and 10, 50% of tissues exhibited weak or no dynamic signal change, suggesting loss of resting
membrane potential (Figure 3D). Representative traces of arrhythmic events are shown in Figure 3 GJ, comparing 30 second calcium traces at day 0 and day 9 (Figure 3G). Late calcium peaks are a
signature of EADs in membrane potential and were clearly observed (red arrows) in day 9 HCQ
recordings, as were the marked increases in duration of the calcium transient, itself a marker for APD
prolongation. Together these data reflect HCQ’s well known block of IKr, which prolongs the QT interval
and its in vitro proxy APD [22, 32] which are associated with arrhythmic events[20, 33, 34]. Our AP
data, which is consistant with the clinical literature, indicates that the cardiac MPS system is a good
predictor of clinical cardiotoxicity of HCQ.

Chronic exposure of AZM for 10 days showed QT prolongation and rhythm instabilities that
correlated with arrhythmic events and clinical observations
Chronic AZM exposure did not significantly change beat rate (Figure 2C). However, as for HCQ,
chronic AZM treatment increased APD80 by day 7, and a trend for persisting prolonged APD80
continued until day 10, albeit with large variation (Figure 2D). Triangulation also trended (p<0.2) to
increase from day 8 onwards, although this did not reach significance (p=0.07 at day 10) (Supp. Figure
1B). Instabilities arose at day 6 and worsened over time (Figure 3B). Non-parametric analysis of
instability showed a significant increase of chaotic polygons in AZM-treated tissues when compared
with HCQ (p<0.05, not shown). CaD80 increased beyond 600ms at day 4, and day 6 onwards in 30-50%
of the tissues. Arrhythmic events were observed from day 3 onwards, reaching 60% of tissues at day
10, with some tissues exhibiting both arrhythmia and CaD80 increase. Day 6 and 9 had respectively
16% and 33% of tissues with weak or no signal (Figure 3E). Figure 3 shows a representative trace of
arrhythmic events at day 0 versus day 10 (Figure 3H) of AZM exposure. Overall, APD80 increased on
all treatment days compared to day 0, and EADs appeared after day 3, and were most prevalent on day
10. Since clinical AZM application is typically limited to 5 days, the observed incidence of proarrhythmic events during longer exposure times cannot be directly compared to clinical outcomes.
However, AZM has been associated with increase in cardiovascular death, mostly through QT
prolongation and arrhythmia [21, 35], and these outcomes are clearly indicated by our MPS
measurements.

Chronic exposure to both HCQ and AZM for 10 days showed QT prolongation and rhythm
instabilities that correlated with arrhythic events and clinical observations
The beat rate increased at day 3 and 6; however, there was no clear overall trend (Figure 2E). APD80
was significantly increased on days 5 and 8, with a trend towards APD prolongation for all recordings
after day 7 (p<0.2) (Figure 2F). This data set closely mimics clinical trials performed by Chorin et al.
[36], where the QT interval increased starting at day 2 to day 5 with high variability in patient population.

Triangulation was not significantly altered over the 10 days during our in vitro polytherapy trials,
although there was a very slight trend towards increasing triangulation at day 4, 5 and 10 (p<0.2)
(Supp. Figure 1C). Interestingly, instabilities were almost absent in this data set, when running nonparametric analysis on Poincare plots from the combination study (Figure 3C) versus those for
individual HCQ (significant, p<0.05) or AZM (non significant trend) (Figure 3 A,B). Although we
observed a clear increase in APD80, and an increase of CaD80 above 600ms at day 2 and day 4-10
(Figure 3E), chronic polytherapy resulted in fewer arrhythmic events and only mild instability compared
to monotherapy (Figure 3I). At most, 33% of tissues showed arrhythmia at day 3 and 6, with 16%
arrhythmias at day 4, 5, 7 and 9 (Figure 3F). Non-parametric contigency analysis showed a decrease
between EAD instances in polytherapy versus HCQ (significant, p<0.05) or AZM (trend, p<0.1)
monotherapy. No tissues had weak signal or stopped beating. At the pathophysiologic level, this data fit
well with prior studies describing the important role of AP triangulation in the transition from benign AP
prolongation to unstable repolarization[37].
Together, these observations suggest that polytherapy rescues arrhythmogenesis resulting from the
individual drugs. Recent clinical studies demonstrated chronic exposure to combination of HCQ and
AZM led to QT increases with few arrhytmia events [17, 35, 38]. The concordance of the cardiac MPS
data to arrive at similar conclusions demonstrates its power in predicting cardiac liabilities for
combination therapy of repurposed drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2. Mechanisms explaining how arrhythmic
events are absent despite a significant increase of the QT interval, can be complex and additional
studies would be required to elucidate HCQ and AZM polytherapy-dependent mechanisms. However,
based on the fact that HCQ and AZM have known multichannel blocking effects, and that ICaL and INa
block is known to reduce IKr dependent arrhythmias[33], we can hypothesize that the combination of
both drugs can synergistically increase multichannel block responsible for lower arrhythmic instances
when compared to monotherapies.

Proteomics analysis of MPS effluent reveal candidate biomarkers for cardiotoxicity monitoring
in patients treated with HCQ and AZM:
For the polytherapy pharmacology study, media were analyzed for over 92 proteins as biomarkers of
tissue injury (Figure 4A). The proteomics analysis of the MPS effluent included a wide array of
biomarkers, most of them measurable in patients’ plasma, associated with different cardiac
mechanisms, from morphology, cytoskeleton, mechanics to apoptosis and stress response. Cardiac
troponin I (TNNI3), is a well known biomarker of cardiac injury and increased risk in mortality, common
in COVID19 patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions[39]. Chronic exposure to the
combination of AZM and HCQ showed no significant change in TNNI3 expression, suggesting that
arrhythmic tissues are not undergoing major tissue damage. However, a clear decrease in
erythropoietine (EPO) was observed. HPGDS, an intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
PGH2 to PGD2, was shown to decrease significantly. Interestingly, similar significant changes were
also observed for carbonic anhydrase 14 (CA14) and tyrosine-protein kinase Fes/Fps (FES). These
intracellular proteins are typically not secreted[40], and therefore are not strong biomarkers unless cells
were damaged. The fact that alterations in levels for these proteins were observed in our study,
suggests some degree of cell damage or stress, but not to the extent where troponin-actin complexes
break down[41]. It is known that CA14 facilitates lactic acid transport across the cardiac sarcolemma
[42], as well as improves myocardial energetics by facilitating mitochondria CO2 clearance [43]. We
hypothesize the drug-related change in CA14 expression is a mechanism for the muscle to adapt
antioxidant, contraction or waste management mechanisms to counter-balance cardiotoxic effects.
Identification of biomarkers in the context of HCQ and AZM, or other polytherapies, will be a valuable
tool in the design of COVID-19 therapeutics trials.

The outcomes of this paper suggest that chronic drug exposure in this MPS format elicits arrhythmic
outcomes similar to those observed in published clinical trials[17, 22, 23, 35, 36, 38]. Specifically, the
known arrhythmia risk of HCQ and AZM alone was recapitulated by our in vitro observation of APD80
increase in combination with arrhythmic events. Combination therapy also exhibited an increase in QT,
but compared to monotherapy, was benign at inducing arrhythmogenic behaviors. This also
corresponds with recent clinical findings [38]. Together, these data suggest that this our high content in
vitro heart muscle model can aid clinicians in clinical trial design, rapidly predict the cardiac outcomes
of polytherapy for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, and help to identify relevant biomarkers to monitor during
clinical trials for potential COVID-19 therapeutics.

Limitations:
Clinical QT interval values represent the summation of all the electrical activity in the ventricles. We
used APD80 as a proxy for clinical QT prolongation, which is a credible and common approach to
compare directional effects and provide some mechanistic insight, but is not sufficiently sensitive for
precise prediction of instability thresholds [30]. COVID-19 patients with drug-induced QT interval
changes of > 60 ms or QT interval values above 500ms are considered high risk, and treatment is
suspended[32]. Our cardiac muscle exhibited unphysiologically high APD80 values in response to
chronic drug exposure. The mechanism for these large responses is unclear, but likely related to a
combination of the hiPSC source, well-known modest maturity of hiPSC-CMs relative to the adult
human heart, and possibly due to the altered current source-sink relationship in these very small
tissues. Additionally, we have used a single patient line to perform this study, albeit with a significant
number of replicates. By screening more patient lines one can achieve a clinically relevant dataset;
although anticipated patient variability will require further expansion of the data size. In future work, this
study can be extended to diseased cell lines to better understand the arrhythmic risk of patients with

cardiovascular complications or comorbidities (i.e., diabetes) who are most likely to be seriously
affected by SARS-CoV2.

Study highlight
What is the current knowledge on the topic?
As the global pandemic of COVID-19 has expanded, clinicians were pressed to treat patients with new
drug combinations, in the absence of regulatory approval. Even ten months after the first cases, FDAapproved medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are just emerging with mixed results. There is a
need for tools to rapidly screen for cardiac liability associated with potential therapeutics.
What question did this study address?
Does Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin COVID-19 polytherapy show synergetic cardiac liability
when compared to their monotherapy?
What does this study add to our knowledge?

In this in vitro safety ‘clinical trial’, hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin alone showed significant APD80
(proxy for QT) prolongation and arrhythmia, whereas their combination polytherapy rescued instances
of arrhythmias while increasing APD80.

How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science?
This study demonstrates that a complex in vitro tissue model (cardiac MPS) can predict arrhythmias
and rhythm instabilities under experimental conditions mimicking safety clinical trials. We also identified
biomarkers associated with cardiac injury, which can be used to design clinical trial monitoring
protocols.

Materials and Methods
Cardiomyocyte Differentiation
The cardiomyocytes (CM) used in this study were derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(hiPSC) via small molecular manipulation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway [52] and were purified
using glucose deprivation[53] to select for cardiomyocytes only.
Fabrication and cell loading of Cardiac MPS
The microfluidic design for each MPS consisted of 4 identical cell culture chambers (1300 by 130 µm)
with media channels running parallel on either side of the cell culture chambers. The microfluidic
devices were fabricated from Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using classic replica molding techniques
[24, 29]. Upon loading, 4000 lactate purified hiPSC-CM were injected into each tissue chamber. The
following day and every other day from then on, media was changed to our in-house ‘Maturation Media’
(MM) as described in [29]. MPS tissues were allowed to mature for at least 10 days before any
subsequent experiments were performed.

We based our study on the following protocols: Clinical drug administration for HCQ is 400 mg twice
per day followed by 200 mg twice per day for 4 days. AZM is 500mg on day 1 followed by 250mg per
day for the following 4 days. Based on clinical peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under curve
for 24h[44][45], we exposed the MPS tissues to 0.24 μM HCQ at day 1 and 0.12 μM HCQ from day 2 to
day 10; and to 2.67μg*h/ml / 24h = 0.111 μg/ml = 0.15 μM AZM at day 1 and 0.056 μg/ml (0.075 μM)
AZM at day 2 to day 10.

Thorough Action Potential Analysis As A Proxy For Clinical QT Interval Study And Arrhythmia
Prediction
Clinically, drug-induced QT prolongation is a strong predictor of arrhythmic cardiotoxicity in patients. At
the cellular level, AP prolongation and increased AP triangulation indicate slowed repolarization and are
strong markers of whole heart QT prolongation and arrhythmia [37], translated by observations of Early
afterdepolarizations (EADs) [46-49], and subsequent Torsade de Pointes[46]. Large beat-to-beat
variation in AP duration is a specific indicator of repolarization instability, which can be readily
visualized by Poincare plots, plotting CaD80 of each (nth) beat in the 30 second calcium recording,
against CaD80 of the preceding beat (n-1)th, normalized to the CaD80 mean (Figure 3A-C). We also
performed a qualitative and non-parametric evaluation of drug arrhythmogenesis by categorizing
arrhythmic behaviors present in the calcium time-series (Figure 3D-F).

Plasma Protein Profiling Using Olink Multiplex Panel
Effluents were sent to Olink Proteomics for quantification of proteins associated with toxicity and tissue
damage. Olink Proteomics uses multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) panels [50]. In this study,
we have used the Organ Damage panel which consist of 92 unique markers of toxicity and cellular
damage.

Statistics
All statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism. All electrophysiology data were analyzed with one
way ANOVA repeated measures and Dunnett’s post-hoc correction with multiple comparison to day 0
and to one another was run. If some values were missing, mixed-effects model was run. Non

Figure Legends
Figure 1. The cardiac microphysiological system. (A) Photograph of a cardiac MPS in fluorescent
light with feeding tubing. (B) Brightfield image of a cardiac MPS loaded with 4,000 human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. The cell chamber is separated from adjacent feeding
channels via a fenestration barrier of 2μm wide grooves allowing for nutrient diffusion while protecting
the tissue in the cell chamber from media flow-induced shear stress. The anchoring pillars on either
side of the cell chamber help keep the heart muscle elongated and provide resistance for contraction.
(C) Representative images of the same tissue under GFP fluorescence for calcium transient recordings
(top) or FarRed voltage dye staining (bottom). (D) The top graph shows a typical ECG recording from
which the clinical QT interval can be determined. We use APD80 as a proxy for QT duration,
corresponding to the duration of the action potential at 80% of its repolarization (bottom). The APD
(red) and Ca (green) waveforms are timestamped identifying temporal kinetics.
Figure 2. Electrophysiology analysis of chronic exposure to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),
azithromycin (AZM) or their polytherapy. Doses were chosen to closely mimic clinical trial drug
prescription used for COVID-19 treatment: 0.24μM HCQ and 0.15 μM AZM on day1 followed by 0.12μM
and 0.075 μM AZM on day 2 to day 10. Polytherapy was the combination of both monotherapy doses
(Supp. Table 1). Violin plots demonstrate spontaneous beating during the therapy for HCQ (A), AZM
(C) or polytherapy (E). Violin plots depicting the change in APD80 during the therapy for HCQ (B), AZM
(D) or polytherapy (F). APD80 values were calculated from spontaneous recording, corrected for beat
rate using the Fredericia correction[1]. In all graphs, the values were normalized to baseline at day 0 for
each tissue. Each point corresponds to one heart muscle. The violin plots show the arithmetic median
(solid line) and upper and lower quartile (dashed lines) as well as minimum and maximum values
(truncation of violin shape). All tissues analyzed were within inclusion criteria of APD80 <500ms at
baseline. Statistics run were one-way ANOVA repeated measures with multiple comparison to baseline
day 0 and Dunnett’s post-hoc correction. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001.

Figure 3. Instability and arrhythmic study of chronic exposure to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),
azithromycin (AZM) and their polytherapy. Poincare plots[2] were used to visualize rhythm
instabilities in different tissues. Where small cluters of daily traces represent minimal arrhythmic risk,
and large complex polygons are indicative of rhythm instability and high arrhythmic risk. (A)
Representative Poincare graph of a tissue exposed to HCQ only. Disorganized polygons can be
observed at day 5 and 10 indicative of drug-indueced arrhythmia. (B) Poincare graph of AZM-treated
heart muscle where instabilities were observed starting on day 6. (C) Representative graph of
polytherapy instabilities, which show fewer and smaller polygons when compared to monotherapy,
indicative of reduced arrhythmic risk. (D-F) Histograms showing weak or no signal (black), CaD80 above
600ms with (striated) or without (grey) EAD and arrhythmic event (pink) as percentage of total heart
muscles (i.e., MPS). The analysis was performed for HCQ alone (D), AZM alone (E), and for
polytherapy (F). Representative calcium transient trace at baseline and after exposure to 9 days of
HCQ (G) or 10 days of AZM (H) where EAD instances can be observed (red arrows). (I) Representative
calcium transient trace at 10 day exposure polytherapy showing no EAD.
Figure 4. Proteomics analysis of microphysiological systems effluent during chronic exposure
to HCQ and AZM polytherapy. Scatter plot of biomarkers showing significant changes with increasing
doses of polytherapy in chronic study. The effluent media was analyzed on day 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. In the
data post-processing, we only included experiments with > 65% of samples above limit of detection.
The limit of detection is set at 3 standard deviation above negative control values. Statistics run were
one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison to one another and Dunnett’s post-hoc correction. * p<0.05;
** p<0.01. TNNI3 (cardiac troponin I), EPO (Erythropoietine), HPGDS (Hematopoietic prostaglandin D
synthase), CA14 (Carbonic anhydrase 14), FES (FES proto-oncogene, Tyrosine Kinase)
