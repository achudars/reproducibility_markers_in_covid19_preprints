Abstract

20

A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2)

21

emerged in late 2019, causing an outbreak of pneumonia [coronavirus disease 2019

22

(COVID-19)] in Wuhan, China, which then rapidly spread globally. Although the use

23

of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-

24

19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges

25

to already overburdened logistics networks. Here, we present an optimized freeze-

26

drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at

27

ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were

28

freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by

29

Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with ~1.2% residual

30

moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity,

31

specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly

32

prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature

33

(18~25℃) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37℃ and 56℃,

34

respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by

35

transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and

36

hospital laboratories. This method can also be applied to the generation of freeze-dried

37

PCR mixes for the detection of other pathogens.

1 Introduction

42

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute

43

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a public health emergency of

44

international concern[1, 2]. At the time of writing (6th April 2020), at least 207 countries
2

45

have been affected, with at least 1 210956 cases and 67 594 deaths globally[3]. Both

46

infected persons and asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 are likely sources of new

47

infections[4, 5]. Timely diagnosis and management are essential for disease control. Real-

48

time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is an accurate and

49

sensitive molecular technique and is considered the “gold standard” for the diagnosis

50

of COVID-19[6, 7].

51

However, to maintain bioactivity, PCR reagents must be transported and stored at

52

a low temperature. This presents challenges to already overburdened transport logistics

53

networks and cold storage space at diagnosis and hospital laboratories.

54

Freeze-drying (lyophilization) is a low-temperature dehydration process mainly

55

used for stabilizing of heat-labile biological drug substances contained in aqueous

56

solutions[8]. Because water drives many destabilization pathways, removing most of the

57

water can prolong the shelf-life of the product [9, 10]. Because freeze-dried reagents

58

typically contain all of the necessary components for testing (at appropriate

59

concentrations), errors associated with improper handling of wet reagents can also be

60

reduced. This reduces preparation time and, thus, testing throughput.

61

There have been several recent publications investigating the possibility of freeze-

62

drying PCR mixes. Klatser et al. freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of

63

mycobacterium, which could be stored at 4℃ and 20℃ for 1 year and at 56℃ for 1

64

week[11]. Tomlinson et al. freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of Phytophthora

65

ramorum, which could be stored at room temperature for 20 weeks. [12] Takekawa et al.

66

freeze-dried a PCR mix for the detection of avian influenza virus in wild birds, but did

67

not report the preservation time[13, 14].

68

However, there are some important challenges associated with the freeze-drying of

69

PCR mixes that have not yet been adequately addressed. Efforts to lyophilize PCR

70

mixes for the detection of RNA virus are complicated by the instability of reverse

71

transcriptase[15, 16]. Klatser et al.[11] and Tomlinson et al.[12] did not include a reverse

72

transcriptase in their PCR mixes. Although Takekawa et al. targeted an RNA virus, they

73

did not report long-term stability test or accelerated stability test data[13, 14]. This is

74

particularly relevant to the current study given that SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded

75

RNA coronavirus[17].

76

Physical evaluation methods are critical when developing storable molecular

77

biology tools, but the published works have often neglected this. For example, the

78

residual moisture content is the most important factor affecting the quality and stability

79

of freeze-dried reagents[18, 19], and the commonly applied reduced weight method is

80

inadequate. Karl-Fischer (KF) titration is an absolute method for measuring residual

81

moisture content and is accepted as the standard method for water content

82

determination in freeze-dried reagents[20], but is rarely applied in studies because of its

83

complexity.

84

In addition, the choice of assessment method to evaluate the freeze-dried reagents

85

is pivotal. For example, regular PCRs are not quantitative, whereas rRT-PCR can report

86

the dynamic changes in product abundance during the whole process, and can be used

87

to detect reaction inhibitors or reduced activity.

88

Here, we propose a methodology for freeze-drying PCR mixes for the detection of

89

SARS-CoV-2. Multiple physical assessment methods, such as Karl-Fischer titration and

90

appearance evaluation, have been applied. To better assess the detection performance

91

of the freeze-dried PCR reagents, we have used rRT-PCR to test samples gathered at

92

the Xiamen International Travel Healthcare Center. We compare the sensitivity,

93

specificity, and repeatability between the freeze-dried reagents and the wet reagents

94

with consistent results. The freeze-dried reagents are thermostable and can be store at

95

room temperature, 37℃, or 56℃ for lengthy periods.

2 Materials and methods

98

2.1 Clinical specimens

99

Twenty-six clinical throat swab specimens were collected at the Xiamen international

100

travel healthcare center. Five of these were from patients who had been diagnosed as

101

having COVID-19. The collected specimens were stored in a 1.5-ml sample freezer

102

tube and maintained at -80℃ before nucleic acid extraction. RNA was extracted using

103

the DOF-9648 purification system (GenMagBio, China) according to the

104

manufacturer’s protocol.

111

of each deoxyribose triphosphates (dNTPs) (TAKARA, Japan), and 1 μl of 10 mM of

112

primers or TaqMan probes.

113

The primers and probes were designed according to the open reading frames of the

114

genes encoding the 1ab (ORF1ab), nucleocapsid (N), and spikes (S) proteins of SARS-

115

CoV-2. We downloaded these sequences from GenBank, and designed the related

116

primers and probes using Mega version 7 and Oligo version 6 software. All

117

oligonucleotides were synthesized and provided by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China)

118

(Table 1).

119

Thermal cycling was performed at 50℃ for 5 min for reverse transcription,

120

followed by 95℃ for 10 min and then 40 cycles of 95℃ for 15 s, and 55℃ for 30 s.

121

All rRT-PCR assays were done using a CFX96 Touch instrument (CT022909, Bio-Rad,

122

USA).

123
124

2.3 Freeze-drying

125

The PCR mixes were supplemented with trehalose [10% final concentration (w/v),

126

Sigma-Aldrich], mannitol [1.25% final concentration (w/v), Sigma-Aldrich], BSA

127

[0.002% final concentration (w/v), TAKARA] and polyethylene glycol 20000

128

(PEG20000) [0.075% final concentration (w/v), Sigma-Aldrich]. Then, the mixes were

129

aliquoted into PCR tube strips (TCS-0803, Rio-Rad) before freeze-drying.

130

The freeze-drying process consists of multiple consecutive phases. First, we loaded

131

the PCR tube strip containing the reagents into the shelf of the freeze dryer (Advantage

132

2.0，VITRIS), then lowered the shelf temperature gradually until -40℃ to freeze the
6

133

liquid in the PCR tubes strip for 2 hrs. Next, the chamber pressure was decreased (from

134

760 mTorr to 100 mTorr) to establish the primary drying phase, enabling the

135

sublimation of all ice and the formation of a porous network. All freeze-drying phases

136

(freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying) were programmed sequentially at

137

fixed time points, and within each phase, critical process parameters were typically kept

138

constant or linearly interpolated between two setpoints. The procedure was as follows:

139

-40℃ for 720 min, -20℃ for 60 min, 0℃ for 60 min, 10℃ for 60 min, and 25℃ for

140

480 min. The pressure of the freeze dryer chamber was maintained at less than 100

141

mTorr throughout the freeze-drying. Once the freeze-drying was complete, we

142

packaged the dried mix into an aluminum foil bag using a vacuum packaging machine

143

(DZ-400, Shanghai Hongde Packaging Machinery Co. LTD, China). The entirety of the

144

above process was performed in an environment with a humidity of less than 3%.

145
146

2.4 Karl-Fischer titration

147

Residual moisture determination was performed on a Karl-Fischer titrator (ZDJ-2S,

148

Beijing Xianqu Weifeng Technology Development Co., China) according to the

149

manufacturer’s protocol. First, we cleaned the pipeline of the Karl-Fischer titrator using

150

Karl-Fischer reagent (Sangon Biotech, China), then added the reaction buffer [50%

151

methyl alcohol (China National Medicines Corporation Ltd.) and 50% formamide

152

(Sigma-Aldrich)] to the reaction cup. We then weighed the freeze-dried reagents using

153

an analytical balance (BS 224 S, 0.1 mg, Sartorius) and measured their moisture content

154

using a calibrated Karl-Fischer titrator.

155
156

2.5 Sensitivity, stability, and specificity of the tests

157

The sensitivity of the freeze-dried PCR reagents (relative to freshly-prepared wet

158

reagents) was tested using a 10-fold serial dilution of nucleic acid. Each reagent was

159

reconstituted in 35 µl of nuclease-free water before adding 5 µl of the sample. We also

160

tested how the freeze-dried PCR reagents performed if reconstituted directly in 40 µl

161

of the sample solution. To verify the stability of the freeze-dried PCR reagents, 12

162

batches of SARS-CoV-2 PCR reagents were tested using a 10-fold serial dilution of

163

nucleic acid. To evaluate the specificity, we used throat swab samples collected from

164

five COVID-19 patients and 21 healthy controls.

165
166

2.6 Long-term stable test and accelerated stable test

167

The freeze-dried PCR mixes were stored at ambient temperature, 37℃, and 56℃, and

168

then reconstituted to their original volume with nuclease-free water at a periodic

169

interval. Retention of the reaction activity of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was tested

170

(relative to freshly-prepared wet reagents) by rRT-PCR.

172

173

3.1 Do the supplemental ingredients affect PCR performance?

174

To test whether the lyophilization additives had an effect on the PCR, we added

175

trehalose [10% final concentration (w/v), Sigma-Aldrich], mannitol [1.25% final

176

concentration (w/v), Sigma-Aldrich], BSA [0.002% final concentration (w/v),

177

TAKARA] and PEG20000 [0.075% final concentration (w/v), Sigma-Aldrich] to the

178

PCR mix. The amplification efficiency and cycle threshold (Ct) value were mostly

179

unaffected by the addition of the lyophilization additives, but the fluorescence intensity

180

(Rn) was marginally decreased (Fig. 1A–C). This indicates that the lyophilization

181

additive had no obvious effect on PCR and could be used for subsequent lyophilization.

182
183

3.2 Physical appearance of the freeze-dried reagents

184

After lyophilization, the PCR mixes became solid with good appearance, and no

185

obvious defects or powder diffusion were detected (Fig. 2A). To test whether the freeze-

186

dried reagents aggregate to the edge of the PCR tubes during transportation, we placed

187

the PCR tube strips in a regularly used vehicle for 28 days to simulate their transport

188

by road.

189

Figure 2B shows the freeze-dried PCR mixes after 28 days of simulated transport.

190

The appearance of the reagents was unchanged by the simulated transport, and no

191

powder floating was observed. This is likely because of the inclusion of PEG20000, a

192

biomacromolecule that helps maintain the shape of the freeze-dried product.

193
194

3.3 Residual moisture content of the lyophilized reagents

195

Residual moisture content determination was performed on a Karl-Fischer titrator. Each

196

set of the lyophilized mixes was measured three times with residual moisture around

197

1.2% (Table 2). In general, the level of addition agents in the PCR reagents and freeze-

198

drying procedure should be adjusted to allow moisture levels of less than 3%; the
9

199

residual moisture obtained by the lyophilization method presented here is appropriate.

200

By comparing the residual moisture of the ORF1ab, N, and S gene-targeting PCR

201

mixes, we found that the differences among these was not obvious, and are smaller than

202

the error caused by the measurement method itself. This indicates that the primers and

203

probes were not major factors affecting the moisture content. Based on this finding, we

204

propose that this method can now be transferred to other PCR mixes, changing only the

205

primers and probes.

206
207

3.4 Sensitivity and repeatability of the lyophilized reagents

208

In these rRT-PCR assays, a 10-fold dilution series of nucleic acid was used as the

209

reaction template. Each freeze-dried reagent was reconstituted in 35 µl of nuclease-free

210

water before adding 5 µl of the sample, whereas the wet reagent reactions were made

211

up of 35 µl of freshly-prepared PCR mix and 5 µl of the sample. The amplification

212

efficiencies and Ct values were similar when comparing the freeze-dried reagent and

213

wet reagent, while the fluorescence intensity of the freeze-dried mixes was lower than

214

that of the wet reagent (Fig. 3A–C). Our assay was sensitive at template concentrations

215

of 10-5, but not at 10-6 (Table 3).

216

To enhance sensitivity, we attempted to reconstitute the freeze-dried regent as a 40-

217

µl total volume mix. This equates to an 8-fold increase in the sample template, which

218

would theoretically reduce the Ct values by three. The amplification results are shown

219

in Table 3 and Figure 3D–F. The fluorescence intensity and amplification efficiency of

220

the former did not decrease, and the Ct values were consistent with the theoretical
10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029934; this version posted April 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

221

calculation, reduced by three. By this approach, the assay was sensitive down to

222

template concentrations of 10-6.

223

In the repeatability assay, a 10-fold serial dilution of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was

224

selected as the reaction template, and 12 batches of lyophilized mixes were randomly

225

selected for testing. We detected no meaningful differences in Ct value when comparing

226

the lyophilized reagents and wet reagents (Table 4). The CV of the lyophilized reagent

227

was larger than that of the wet reagent, but the difference was not statistically significant

228

（PORF1ab = 0.9920; PN = 0.5851; PS = 0.9374, respectively). However, it is worth noting

229

that CV tended to increase with the decrease of sample concentration in both the

230

lyophilized group and the control group. This is determined by the characteristics of

231

PCR detection itself, which has little relation to lyophilization. Thus, we show that the

232

lyophilized reagents possess good repeatability.

233
234

3.5 Stability of the lyophilized reagents

235

The freeze-dried PCR mixes were stored for up to 28 days at either room temperature,

236

37℃, or 56℃, and, upon reconstitution, were tested relative to freshly-prepared wet

237

reagents. At day zero, the Ct values and fluorescence intensities obtained using the

238

lyophilization reagent were not decreased relative to the wet reagent (Fig. 4), indicating

239

that PCR mixes could retain activity following lyophilization.

240

The freeze-dried PCR mixes were then tested at multiple time points during storage.

241

After storing at room temperature for 28 days, similar Ct values (Fig. 4A) and

242

fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4B) were observed for freeze-dried and wet reagents. It
11

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.029934; this version posted April 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

243

should be noted that the fluorescence intensity reported by the instrument fluctuates.

244

Therefore, we use the fluorescence intensity change relative to the wet reagents as our

245

main evaluation criterion.

246

We also simulated transport of the freeze-dried reagents at room temperature. After

247

28 days of simulated transport, the appearance of the freeze-dried mixes was unchanged

248

(Fig. 2B). Similar Ct values (Fig. 4C) and fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4D) were

249

observed for freeze-dried and wet reagents when targeting the ORF1ab, N, and S genes.

250

Ideally, we would have liked to test the activity of the freeze-dried master mix after

251

12 months of storage at ambient temperature. However, given the ongoing outbreak and

252

our eagerness to share our findings, we opted to perform accelerated stability tests at

253

37℃ and 56℃. After storing at 37℃ for 2 weeks, the freeze-dried reagents performed

254

similar (Ct values) to the wet reagents (Fig. 4E). The fluorescence intensities were

255

initially similar, but decreased gradually from the sixth day. The mixes retained half of

256

their original fluorescence intensity until the 14th day (Fig. 4F). When stored at 56℃,

257

the freeze-dried reagents and freshly-prepared wet reagents initially perform similarly

258

(Ct values), but the freeze-dried mixes lose activity from the tenth day (Fig. 4G). The

259

fluorescence intensity values decreased sharply at the beginning, and little fluorescence

260

could be detected on the 14th day (Fig. 4H).

261

In conclusion, the freeze-dried mixes retain activity at room temperature for 28

262

days, and for 14 and 10 days at 37℃ and 56℃ respectively. Also, there were no obvious

263

differences in the results obtained for the ORF1ab, N, and S genes. This indicates that

264

probes and primers are not the shelf-life limiting components, and that this method
12

265

could be transferred to the detection of other pathogens by simply changing the probes

266

and primers.

267
268

3.6 Clinical sample results

269

Five samples of clinical pharyngeal swabs from patients with a positive diagnosis of

270

COVID-19 and 21 samples from healthy controls were tested using both the freeze-

271

dried mix and freshly-prepared wet reagents. All reactions using the five patient

272

samples tested positive (Table 6). All 21 healthy subject samples tested negative in all

273

reactions. This indicates that the freeze-dried reagents have good specificity and can

274

distinguish between healthy and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples, matching the

275

performance of the freshly-prepared wet reagents.

276
277

4. Discussion

278

Freeze-drying is widely applied for the preservation and transportation of heat-labile

279

biological drug substances at ambient temperature[21, 22]. In this study, we present an

280

optimized freeze-drying formulation and procedure, allowing the stabilization of the

281

PCR mixes at ambient temperature. We used both physical and biological methods to

282

evaluate them comprehensively and systematically.

283

An ideal appearance is the basic requirement for lyophilized reagents’ packing,

284

transportation, and preservation. It is mainly influenced by additive formulation and

285

freezing process. Trehalose, as an important lyophilization protectant, and plays a

286

crucial role in the lyophilization process. However, if the trehalose concentration is too
13

287

high, the appearance of the final product can be compromised. If some macromolecular

288

substances (e.g., PEG20000) are added in the PCR mixes, the mixed reagents can

289

become tightly connected after lyophilization, which can help to avoid disturbance

290

during transportation. The freezing process of freeze-drying can be divided into three

291

stages, and it is important to ensure that the reagents can be maintained at low

292

temperatures for sufficient time during the freezing process to make sure that ice

293

crystals can grow to the extent that no further ice crystal growth is possible. Otherwise,

294

the appearance of the freeze-dried reagents may be affected[23].

295

Residual moisture content is an impact factor influencing the quality and stability

296

of freeze-dried PCR mixes[18, 19]. A high moisture level will decrease the stability of the

297

reagent. Since glycerol is hygroscopic, its presence in the final freeze-dried product

298

likely results in a high moisture content, which might affect the stability of the

299

product[24]. The commercial availability of glycerol-free Taq polymerases (enzyme)

300

would help to prolong the shelf life of freeze-dried PCR mixes[11]. However, removing

301

all water from the reagent would have deleterious effects on those reaction components,

302

proteins for example, that require certain amounts of bound water in order to maintain

303

proper conformations. Here, we found that a residual moisture content of 1–3% is

304

optimal for freeze-dried PCR mixes.

305

We chose rRT-PCR to evaluate the detection performance of the freeze-dried PCR

306

mixes. The supplemental ingredients added to the freeze-dried mixes did not affect the

307

Ct values, fluorescence intensity, or amplification efficiency of the PCR mixes. The

308

sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of freeze-dried reagents were similar to those

309

of the freshly-prepared wet reagents. We also found that the sensitivity of freeze-dried

310

PCR mixes could be improved by reconstituting the dried mix using the test sample

311

solution (to a volume of 40 µl). However, we did not observe the activity of lyophilized

312

PCR mixes beyond 28 days of storage. Given the ongoing outbreak and our eagerness

313

to share our findings, we opted to use an accelerated stability test to predict the long-

314

term storage effect of the lyophilized reagent at room temperature. Klatser et al.

315

described a freeze-dried PCR mix for detection of mycobacteria, which could retain

316

activity at 4℃ and 20℃ for 1 year and at 56℃ for 1 week[11]. Unlike in the work of

317

Klatser et al., our freeze-dried PCR mixes contain a reverse transcriptase. Given that

318

our freeze-dried PCR mix could retain activity at 56℃ for 10 days, we predict that it

319

would remain active for 1 year when stored at room temperature.

320

In conclusion, we describe a method for producing thermostable freeze-dried PCR

321

mixes for use in COVID-19 diagnosis, with sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability

322

values that match those of freshly-prepared wet reagents. There were no obvious

323

differences in the performance of the freeze-dried mixes targeting the ORF1ab, N, and

324

S genes of SARS-CoV-2. Based on this finding, we propose that the primers and probes

325

do not affect the efficiency of the lyophilization.

326

We propose that the method described here can now be transferred to the

327

lyophilization of PCR mixes targeting other pathogens by simply changing the primers

328

and probes. This approach will also be useful in tackling future major outbreaks or other

329

public health hazards.
