Abstract
The predominant approach for antibody generation remains animal immunization, which can yield exceptionally
selective and potent antibody clones owing to the powerful evolutionary process of somatic hypermutation. However,
animal immunization is inherently slow, has poor compatibility with certain antigens (e.g., integral membrane proteins),
and suffers from self-tolerance and immunodominance, which limit the functional spectrum of antibodies that can be
obtained. Here, we describe Autonomous Hypermutation yEast surfAce Display (AHEAD), a synthetic recombinant
antibody generation technology that imitates somatic hypermutation inside engineered yeast. In AHEAD, antibody
fragments are encoded on an error-prone orthogonal DNA replication system, resulting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
populations that continuously mutate surface-displayed antibody repertoires. Simple cycles of yeast culturing and
enrichment for antigen binding drive the evolution of high-affinity antibody clones in a readily parallelizable process that
takes as little as 2 weeks. We applied AHEAD to generate nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, a GPCR,
and other targets. The SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, concurrently evolved from an open-source naïve nanobody library in 8
independent experiments, reached subnanomolar affinities through the sequential fixation of multiple mutations over 38 AHEAD cycles that saw ~580-fold and ~925-fold improvements in binding affinities and pseudovirus neutralization
potencies, respectively. These experiments highlight the defining speed, parallelizability, and effectiveness of AHEAD
and provide a template for streamlined antibody generation at large with salient utility in rapid response to current and
future viral outbreaks.

Main Text
Autonomous Hypermutation yEast surfAce Display (AHEAD) pairs orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) with yeast
surface display (YSD) to achieve a system for the rapid evolution of antibodies. In OrthoRep, an orthogonal error-prone
DNA polymerase (DNAP) replicates a special cytosolic plasmid (p1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae without elevating
genomic mutation rates (1, 2). This results in the durable continuous hypermutation of p1-encoded genes at a mutation
rate of 10-5 substitutions per base (spb), which is 100,000-fold higher than yeast’s genomic mutation rate of 10-10 spb.
We reasoned that when antibody fragments are encoded on p1, yeast cells would self-diversify their displayed antibodies,
resulting in autonomous exploration of sequence space. When subjected to sequential rounds of sorting for antigen
binding, the continuously diversifying antibodies would rapidly improve (Fig. 1A) and yield high-affinity, high-quality
antibody clones in a short period of time. This is in contrast to typical in vitro antibody generation methods such as phage
display (3) where sequence search space is defined by library complexity at the outset of an experiment but is static
throughout the selection process. We first tested whether two known antibody fragments could be encoded on p1 for cell
surface display. Specifically, we tested a single-chain variable fragment called 4-4-20 that binds fluorescein (4) and a
camelid single-domain antibody fragment (“nanobody”) called AT110 that recognizes a prototypical G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) (Figs. 1B, 1C) (5). Constitutive expression of 4-4-20 and AT110 fused to the mating adhesion receptor,
Aga2p, along with induced expression of the genome-encoded cell wall anchoring subunit, Aga1p (4), resulted in
functional display on the yeast surface as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Information). This
set the stage for cycles of yeast culture and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on target binding to effect the
rapid evolution of high-affinity antibodies, akin to somatic hypermutation for affinity maturation in vertebrate immune
systems (6, 7).
To test whether AHEAD could generate high-affinity antibodies through cycles of yeast culture and FACS, we sought to
improve the nanobody, AT110. Nanobodies are single-domain antibody fragments derived from the VHH domains of
heavy chain antibodies in llamas, camels, and their relatives (Fig. 1B) (8). These unique antibody fragments are capable
of stabilizing distinct functional conformations of GPCRs and other dynamic proteins by virtue of their propensity to
bind concave epitopes (9). This has made the discovery of high-affinity nanobodies a mainstay of GPCR structural
biology and pharmacology (10, 11). Nanobodies are also particularly appropriate for animal-free antibody generation
approaches, as the alternative of immunizing camelids carries logistical challenges of large animal husbandry and animal

welfare considerations (12). AT110 is a low-affinity nanobody which binds selectively to the active-state conformation
of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), discovered via in vitro selection from a naïve synthetic nanobody library.
However, AT110 required several rounds of manual error-prone PCR diversification, selection, and engineering to reach
the affinity necessary for co-crystallization and structural studies (5, 13). Using AHEAD and starting from AT110, we
carried out iterative cycles of yeast culture and FACS to improve AT110 (Fig. 2A). This experiment yielded nanobody
AT110i104 (Table S1), with an allosteric modulation potency of 2.5 nM for enhancing agonist binding to the AT1R
GPCR (Fig. 2B), representing a roughly 20-fold functional affinity enhancement compared to the parent clone. Notably,
some mutations (e.g., I98V and a non-synonymous change at Y113) were identified both by AHEAD and previous efforts
(5), while other affinity-enhancing mutations (e.g., R45C and R66H) were distinct (Fig. S1). Interestingly, Y113H and
I98V were synergistic in their ability to modulate agonist-bound AT1R (Fig. 2B), showing that AHEAD could find
complex functional outcomes. Overall, this experiment demonstrated that AHEAD can produce high-affinity antibodies
in a much more streamlined manner than conventional approaches.
Although successful, lessons learned during anti-AT1R nanobody evolution motivated us to redesign AHEAD’s
nanobody display constructs (Fig. S2A). In particular, we found that the average level of AT110 display was low, which
complicated the FACS selection process in cycles of AHEAD. We overcame this problem by using magnetic activated
cell sorting (MACS) before each FACS round in order to enrich subpopulations of cells with high AT110 display. Since
OrthoRep maintains p1 in multiple copies (1), copy number fluctuations create subpopulations that express substantially
more nanobody than average, allowing effective MACS enrichment of these higher expressers when large numbers of
cells are used. However, the requirement for MACS steps significantly increased the time and effort needed for antibody
evolution, counter to AHEAD’s potential as a rapid and streamlined antibody generation system. To obtain a general
solution to suboptimal nanobody display, we adopted an improved display architecture (14), evolved a new p1-specific
promoter, engineered a stronger secretory leader, and utilized a polyadenosine tail (15) encoded downstream of the
nanobody gene for AHEAD (Figs. S2A-C and Supplementary Information). These features together increased the
expression and display level of nanobodies by ~25-fold, allowing the typical cell in a population to display enough
nanobody for direct antigen binding selection by FACS even when binding was weak (Fig. S2D). This second-generation
AHEAD system supports our intended process of cycling directly between yeast culture and FACS to generate antibodies
(Fig. 1A).
To test our upgraded system, we ran several antibody fragment evolution experiments against additional targets including
human serum albumin (HSA) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). High-affinity nanobodies against HSA are desired as
domains that can be fused to therapeutic proteins in order to increase their serum half-life (16). High-affinity nanobodies
against GFP are useful for immunostaining in GFP-expressing tissue samples where conventional antibodies take too
long to penetrate due to their high molecular weight (i.e. cleared brain) (17, 18). Starting from relatively low-affinity
nanobodies targeting HSA and GFP, namely Nb.b201 (19) and Lag42 (20), respectively, we successfully evolved highaffinity clones through 4-6 cycles of AHEAD (Fig. S3 and Table S1).
AHEAD is distinguished by its coincident speed, parallelizability, and evolutionary process for antibody maturation.
These properties are particularly valuable for outbreak response where urgency demands rapid discovery (speed) of highaffinity antibodies through many independent antibody generation campaigns that collectively maximize the probability
of success (parallelizability). In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we asked whether AHEAD would be capable
of generating collections of potent nanobodies against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (21). Starting from an opensource naïve nanobody YSD library (19), we selected 8 clones that bound the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (Fig. S4A and Table S1). Each of these distinct clones was then encoded on p1 for
streamlined evolution (i.e., affinity maturation). The parallelizability of AHEAD allowed us to simultaneously run 8
independent affinity maturation experiments, one for each of the parental clones, in order to avoid clonal interference
among initial lineages and increase the chance of obtaining matured nanobodies with functional diversity in binding
modes (Fig. S4B) (22). After 3-8 cycles of AHEAD (Fig. S5) where the uninterrupted cycle time defined by yeast

culturing and FACS was only 3 days, all eight experiments produced multi-mutation nanobodies (Figs. 3A, 3B and Table
S1) with higher affinity for RBD than their parents (Fig. 3C, Table 1, Table S2 and Fig. S6). For example, RBD1i13,
RBD3i17, RBD6id, RBD10i10, RBD10i14, and RBD11i12 exhibited monovalent RBD-binding affinity improvements
up to ~580-fold over the course of affinity maturation (Fig. 3 and Table 1), and one nanobody, RBD10i14, reached a
subnanomolar monovalent Kd of 0.72 nM (Fig. 3C and Table 1). These levels of evolutionary improvement from naïve
nanobodies, achieved through a fast and parallelizable process, confirm the power of AHEAD.
Anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies have emerged as promising therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 (23, 24). These
antibodies act by inhibiting the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), thereby blocking entry into cells. To probe the potential of our anti-RBD nanobodies as therapeutic candidates,
we genetically fused the nanobodies to the Fc region of the human IgG1 antibody isotype and carried out neutralization
assays against SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped virus. We found that many of the evolved anti-RBD nanobodies had
exceptional neutralization potencies representing up to ~925-fold improvements over their parent sequences (Fig. 3D,
Table 1, and Fig. S7A). For example, RBD1i13, RBD3i17, RBD6id, RBD10i10, RBD10i14, and RBD11i12 exhibited
low nanomolar or subnanomolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.66, 1.51, 0.72, 2.44, 5.38, and
0.52 nM, respectively (Fig. 3D, Table 1, Table S2, and Fig. S7A). Interestingly, RBD1i13 and RBD11i12, which had
the strongest viral neutralization potencies among all evolved variants, descended from parents that were relatively poor
neutralizers (Table 1 and Table S2). This highlights the value of experimental parallelizability available to AHEAD:
through evolution experiments that kept each parent clone’s lineages separate, early high achievers such as RBD6 could
not outcompete the initially low performing lineages that ultimately gave rise to the most potent neutralizers. This is akin
to ‘demes’ in natural evolution, which act to reduce clonal interference and increase overall functional diversity (25, 26)
Indeed, AHEAD’s ability to maximize diversity of high-affinity clones through independent experiments should be
valuable in all antibody generation campaigns, given that antibody performance depends on secondary features beyond
affinity alone.
To assess the functional diversity of nanobody clones from AHEAD, we tested potent neutralizers for their ability to
compete with ACE2 binding. Clones RBD1i13, RBD6id, and RBD11i12 strongly or moderately competed with ACE2
binding whereas a fourth clone, RBD10i10, did not compete at all (Fig. 3E, Table 1, and Fig. S7B). This suggests that
the sites of RBD binding and mechanisms of neutralization differ across our collection of potent nanobodies, which could
be exploited in nanobody cocktails or fusions between different nanobodies. Such strategies can lead to higher
neutralization potency or limit mutational escape as SARS-CoV-2 evolves in the field (27).
The rapid evolution of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies where 8 independent antibody generation experiments were carried
out in an uninterrupted time of only 1.5-3 weeks that saw major improvements in both affinity and neutralization
potencies (Fig. 3F and Table S2) may serve as a template for future outbreak response. Since we started from naïve
synthetic nanobody libraries, our experiments did not depend on the prior discovery of antibodies from patients or
animals, demonstrating capacity for immediate response once a molecular target is identified. Since we ran multiple
independent evolution campaigns simultaneously, we readily obtained a collection of functionally diverse nanobody
sequences, important for hedging against biological uncertainty in the face of new pathogens going forward. Since we
relied only on simple cycles of yeast culturing and FACS to evolve potent nanobodies, our experiments should be broadly
accessible, and may enable wider and more distributed antibody development efforts in future pandemics. In the particular
case of anticipating novel coronavirus outbreaks, our collection of SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, already encoded on
AHEAD, should be a privileged starting point for rapid response as additional evolutionary cycles may be able to direct
our current nanobodies to become specific for new spike variants. In fact, we estimate that given an SARS-CoV-2 RBD
escape variant (28) we would be able to discover multiple high-affinity binders in 2 weeks.
Beyond outbreak response, AHEAD has the potential to broadly upgrade antibody generation supporting all areas of
biomedicine, especially as the AHEAD technology matures. For example, we foresee expansions of AHEAD where
instead of starting evolution from isolated initial clones encoded on p1, diverse naïve antibody collections are encoded

as libraries. Such off-the-shelf libraries of yeast would allow AHEAD experiments to encompass both initial clone
discovery and affinity maturation in an end-to-end process for antibody generation against arbitrary targets. To test the
feasibility of this possibility, we carried out experiments where a 200,000-member naïve nanobody library capturing key
features of camelid immune repertoires was computationally designed and synthesized (29), encoded in AHEAD strains
with 50-fold coverage, and subjected to selection for binding GFP as a test target. After three cycles of AHEAD, a single
nanobody, NbG1, dominated the population, and after two additional cycles, a C96Y mutation that increased GFP binding
(EC50) by 4.4-fold arose and fixed (Fig. S8 and Table S2), emulating the entire process of somatic recombination, clonal
expansion, and somatic hypermutation in the immune system. As more libraries and developments in the underlying
OrthoRep system (e.g., higher mutation rate orthogonal DNAPs) become available, AHEAD’s core functionality as a
rapid and parallelizable affinity maturation process involving only the culturing and sorting of yeast will form a new
foundation for antibody generation.

Materials and Methods
AHEAD base yeast display strain construction
We generated strain yAW301, which is essentially the EBY100 yeast surface display strain (4) harboring a ‘landing pad’
version of p1 along with p2 (30). yAW301 served as the base strain for all AHEAD experiments where 1) antibody
fragment display cassettes were integrated onto the landing pad p1 and 2) a nuclear plasmid, pAR-633-Leu2 (Table S3),
encoding an error-prone orthogonal DNAP replicating p1, was transformed into the strain in order to drive continuous
hypermutation of p1 and the antibody fragment display cassette encoded therein. To make strain yAW301, we first
generated F102-2 (30) cells containing p1 and p2 but lacking the MET17 gene from the genome. To delete MET17,
F102-2 cells were transformed with a linear DNA fragment encoding a G418 resistance cassette flanked on both sides by
45bp sequences homologous to the surrounding regions of MET17 (SG ID S000004294). Following selection on solid
media with G418, colonies were isolated and verified for the deletion of MET17 by PCR. In addition, the colonies’
inability to grow without the supplementation of methionine and cysteine was verified. F102-2 cells harbor the
unmodified cytosolic p1 and p2 plasmids. However, we wished to engineer a version of p1 designed for ease of integration
and selection of antibody yeast display cassettes. To generate such a ‘landing pad’ p1, a DNA fragment was designed to
recombine with F102-2’s p1 plasmid (8.9kb) in order to replace positions 3201-8400 of p1 with MET17 driven by the
p1 specific promoter, p2O5. This integration resulted in the desired landing pad p1 (5.3kb) harbored in F102-2. The
shifted size of p1 was validated by gel electrophoresis of total DNA treated with proteinase K (Thermo Fisher, USA), as
previously described (30), and sequenced verified. This landing pad p1 could then be subsequently transported from
F102-2 to other strains through protoplast fusion, as previously described (30). In particular, EBY100 yeast surface
display cells (4) that had their genomic MET17 deleted using the same strategy for deleting MET17 in F102-2 were fused
with F102-2 cells containing the landing pad p1. Selection for prototrophies uniquely encoded by nuclear genes in
EBY100 (and not in F102-2) as well as selection for MET17 uniquely encoded on p1 resulted in strain yAW292 (Table
S4). Finally, plasmid pAR-633-Leu2, which encodes the error-prone orthogonal DNAP, TP-DNAP1-4-2 (2), was
transformed into yAW292 so that the p1-encoded nanobody expression cassette would be replicated by the error-prone
orthogonal DNAP to drive hypermutation. The resulting strain was dubbed yAW301 (Table S4).
Cloning nanobodies into AHEAD
pAW24 or pAW240, plasmids that encode the linear cassette needed for integration of nanobodies into the landing pad
p1, were designed and constructed for nanobody expression from p1 (Fig. S2 and Table S3). In pAW24 (corresponding
to AHEAD 1.0, see Fig. S2), the nanobody gene within the integration cassette is driven by a previously reported p1specific promoter called p10B2 (15) and fused to a standard alpha mating factor secretory leader sequence (4). In
pAW240 (corresponding to AHEAD 2.0, see Fig. S2), the nanobody gene within the integration cassette is driven by a
new p1-specific promoter (pGA) that was discovered in an unrelated OrthoRep-based protein evolution project. (pGA is
the same sequence as p10B2 with two G->A mutations at positions -5 and -34 upstream from the start codon.) The
nanobody gene within the integration cassette of pAW240 also includes a mutated leader sequence, app8i1, which was
selected for higher efficiency display (Fig. S2C). Finally, the nanobody expression cassette in pAW240 contains a hardcoded poly-A tail (15) to maximize expression. Single nanobodies or libraries were amplified with PCR using primers
Nb_P240_F and Nb_P240_R (Table S5), gel purified and assembled into BseR1-digested pAW24 or pAW240 with a
Gibson reaction. For pAW240, it is important to use BseR1 digested pAW240 as the “backbone” for Gibson assembly
as opposed to a PCR amplified “backbone” of pAW240 because PCR causes truncation of the hard-coded poly-A tail
sequence, which results in lower expression and a drop in antibody display levels. Once pAW24 or pAW240 were
properly assembled to contain desired nanobodies, the resulting plasmids were linearized with ScaI to expose flanking
regions homologous to the landing pad p1 to direct their homologous recombination into p1 in yAW292 or yAW301.
The ScaI linearized pAW24 or pAW40 plasmids containing desired nanobodies were then transformed into yAW301 by
a standard yeast chemical transformation protocol (31). Cells that successfully integrated the nanobody expression
cassette onto p1 were selected on Synthetic Complete without Histidine, Leucine, Uracil, Trptophan, Methionine, and

replaced by the nanobody expression cassette, we found that the exclusion of methionine was appropriate for selection,
since some copies of the landing pad p1 would still be present in cells containing the p1 integration product. We
empirically found that selection for cells still containing the unmodified landing pad p1 increased the success rate of
integration, possibly because the unmodified landing pad p1 also encodes an additional source of TP-DNAP1, allowing
for a higher overall p1 copy number to aid the replication of both the unmodified landing pad p1 and the modified
nanobody-expressing p1 integration product. Proper integration of the nanobody expression cassette into the landing pad
p1 was varied by gel electrophoresis on total DNA, PCR using primers unique to the integration product, and DNA
sequencing. For further cultivation, cells were grown in SC-HLUW (Synthetic Complete without Histidine, Leucine,
Uracil, and Trptophan with 2% glucose, US Biological) liquid dropout media. AHEAD experiments were started after
this point.
Affinity maturation of anti-AT1R nanobodies using the first-generation AHEAD 1.0 system
Yeast strain yAW301 harboring pAR-633-Leu2 encoding the error-prone orthogonal DNAP and an AT110 expression
cassette (linearized plasmid pAW24) integrated onto p1 were grown and passaged in SC-HLUW. In preparation for each
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) selection step, display of AT110 was induced by transferring yeast to SCHLUW but where glucose was replaced with 2% galactose as the sole sugar source. This results in the induction of Aga1p
expression and subsequent surface display of the AT110 nanobody. Because of the low expression of nanobodies in the
first-generation AHEAD 1.0 system (Fig. S2), cells expressing the highest levels of AT110 nanobodies were deliberately
enriched before each AHEAD cycle. Accordingly, the following process defined each AHEAD 1.0 cycle, which is longer
than the 3-day AHEAD 2.0 cycle used for the majority of evolution experiments in this work. Between 2 x 109 and 1 x
1010 induced yeast were pelleted and resuspended in 2.5-5 mL of AT1R staining buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 3 mM CaCl2, 0.1% MNG, 0.01% CHS, 0.2% maltose, 20 µM angiotensin II) with 1 µM anti-HA
antibody that was fluorescently labeled, alternately, with AlexaFluor (AF) 647 or FITC. After incubation at 4°C for 30
min, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2.5-5 mL AT1R staining buffer, followed by the addition of 250-500 µL
anti-647 or anti-FITC microbeads (Miltenyi). Yeast cells were incubated with microbeads for 20 min at 4°C and then
pelleted, resuspended in staining buffer, and added to 2 or 3 LS columns (Miltenyi). The columns were then washed with
staining buffer and bound yeast cells were eluted in 5 mL staining buffer. From these elutions, ~1 x 108 cells were pelleted
for FACS and stained with FLAG-tagged angiotensin II type 1 receptor (5) for 45 min at 4°C. Following this, yeast cells
were again pelleted and stained with fluorescently labeled anti-FLAG antibody and fluorescently labeled anti-HA
antibody for 20 min at 4°C, alternating between FITC, 647, and 488 labeled antibody for each AHEAD cycle to avoid
selection for dye binding. FACS was performed with a Sony SH800 using a 100 µm Sony Sorting Chip. Over the course
of nanobody AT110 affinity maturation, cells were grown for a total of ~400 divisions. During that time, eight cycles of
AHEAD were performed.
In preparation of next-generation sequencing, p1 plasmid was extracted, as previously described (6), from yeast cultures
after the FACS step of each AHEAD cycle. PCRs were performed with Q5 Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and
primers NGS_p1_F and NGS_p1_R. Following PCR reactions, samples were PCR purified (Qiagen). Amplicon
sequencing was performed by the MGH CCIB DNA Core and the resulting sequences were analyzed with Geneious
Prime.
Radioligand binding assay for anti-AT1R nanobodies
Nanobodies were purified from the periplasm of Escherichia coli by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and dialyzed into
buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl. Since AT110 and its derivatives allosterically increase the
affinity of agonists for the AT1R, the effect of serially diluted nanobodies on the binding of the inverse agonist [3H]olmesartan was assessed in the absence versus the presence of an ~IC20 concentration of the low-affinity agonist,
TRV055. Purified wild-type AT1R (75 ng) (6) was added to 2.5 nM [3H]-olmesartan (American Radiolabeled Chemicals,
Inc), the indicated concentration of nanobody, and either assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01%

lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) or 1 µM TRV055. The final reaction volumes were
200 µL, with single replicates for each condition. Assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl,
0.01% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After a 90 minute incubation at room
temperature, reactions were harvested onto GF/B glass-fiber filter paper using a 96-well harvester (Brandel) and quickly
washed three times with cold 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl. The fraction of [3H]-olmesartan bound in the
presence versus the absence of TRV055 was determined at each nanobody concentration. Data from three independent
experiments were fit to a one-site model in GraphPad Prism.
Engineering a stronger secretory leader sequence for the second-generation AHEAD 2.0 system
One of the parts responsible for higher nanobody display levels in AHEAD 2.0 is a mutated app8 secretory leader, which
we selected from an error-prone PCR library of app8 (Fig. S2). Nanobody AT110 was fused to an app8 secretory leader
(32) and cloned into a nuclear CEN/ARS plasmid containing either a pREV1, pSAC6, pRPL18B or a pTDDH3 promoter
(32). Nanobody display from the pSAC6 promoter was determined to be most similar to expression from p1 with the
pGA promoter. This plasmid, dubbed pAW258 was then used as template for preparing a library of mutated app8
secretory leader sequences. app8 was amplified by error prone PCR (GeneMorph II, Agilent) using primers
AW_Sac6_mut_F and AW_Sac6_mut_R and cloned back into pAW258 using Gibson assembly. The library size was
determined to be 2x107 by counting colonies on serially diluted antibiotic selection plates. Twelve single clones were
picked and sequenced. All tested clones had intact reading frames while the average number of mutations per clone was
1.4. The library was then transformed into EBY100 cells, induced through growth in 2% galactose as the sole sugar
source for 1-2 days, and subjected to three rounds of FACS selection for strong HA tag display, as the HA tag is fused to
AT110 and acts as a surrogate for AT110 display level. In each round, the top 0.05% expressing cells as determined by
anti-HA signal were sorted (Fig. S2C). After the third round, the cell population was plated, 48 single colonies were
picked and screened for nanobody display. The 12 clones that displayed the highest levels of nanobody expression were
sequenced. Three different mutations were discovered, namely, V10A, F48V and D28G. Those mutations were
reintroduced to plasmid p258 and assayed for their effect on AT110 display level. While mutations F48V and D28G did
not confer any increase in display levels, mutation V10A increased nanobody display by ~90% (Fig. S2C). App8 with
V10A was dubbed app8i1 and used in the second-generation AHEAD 2.0, along with other modifications described
above.
Affinity maturation of Nb.b201 and Lag42 using the second-generation AHEAD 2.0 system
HSA (Sigma) was directly labeled with AF647. 6XHis tagged GFP was expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA
agarose (ThermoFisher). Nb.b201 was amplified using PCR from pYDS-Nb.b201 (19) and cloned into pAW240. Lag42
was synthesized as a gBlock (IDT DNA technologies) and cloned into pAW240. The resulting plasmids were linearized
using ScaI, transformed into yAW301, and plated as described above (see Materials and Methods section “cloning
nanobodies into AHEAD”). A single colony was picked into SC-HLUW, grown to saturation, pelleted, induced in SCHLUW with 2% galactose replacing glucose as the sole sugar source for ~24 hours, and labeled with 50 nM HSA-AF647
(for Nb.b201 cells) or 200 nM GFP-AF647 (for Lag42 cells) and 1 µM mouse anti-HA antibody for 1 hour at 4°C in
binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% maltose). Cells were washed with binding buffer
and incubated with 0.5 µM polyclonal goat anti-mouse AF488-labeled antibody (ThermoFisher) for 15 minutes. Cells
were washed again with binding buffer and sorted (SONY SH800) for increased affinity for HSA or GFP (Fig. S3) into
a tube containing 2 ml SC-HLUW. Cells were incubated with shaking for 1-2 days at 30°C and subjected to the next
AHEAD cycle.
Over 4 cycles of AHEAD (for Nb.b201) or 6 cycles of AHEAD (for Lag42), the selection stringency was increased by
reducing the concentration of HSA or GFP as indicated (Fig. S3). During each FACS step, ~2 x 107 cells were used for
sorting out 200-1000 cells. After AHEAD, nanobodies were amplified from p1 and either sequenced directly or subcloned
into a plasmid to isolate individual clones for sequencing and further characterization.

Isolation of anti-RBD nanobody parents
In order to isolate RBD-binding nanobodies, two initial rounds of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) were
performed using a synthetic yeast-displayed library of nanobodies (19) followed by two rounds of FACS. S. cerevisiae
containing the library were grown in tryptophan dropout media (US Biological) with 2% glucose for 1 day and then,
expression and display was induced in tryptophan dropout with 2% galactose for 2 days. For the first round, 1 x 1010
yeast were centrifuged and resuspended in a ‘pre-clearing’ solution of 4.5 mL of binding buffer, 500 µl of anti-PE
microbeads (Miltenyi), and 200 nM streptavidin-PE (BioLegend). After incubation for 40 min at 4°C, yeast cells were
passed through an LD column (Miltenyi) to remove cells interacting with microbeads or streptavidin. Yeast cells that
flowed through the column were collected, centrifuged, resuspended in a ‘staining solution’ consisting of 2 mL binding
buffer with 1 µM SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 250 nM streptavidin-PE and incubated for one hour at 4°C. After incubation,
yeast cells were centrifuged, resuspended in a ‘secondary solution’ of 4.5 mL binding buffer and 500 µL anti-PE
microbeads, and incubated an additional 15 min at 4°C. These yeast cells were then centrifuged, washed with binding
buffer, and passed into an LS column (Miltenyi). The LS column was washed with 7 mL of binding buffer and remaining
yeast were eluted in 5 mL of binding buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in 5 mL tryptophan dropout media for
expansion. The second round of MACS was performed similarly to the first but starting with 1 x 109 yeast and substituting
PE-labeled streptavidin with FITC-labeled streptavidin and anti-PE microbeads with anti-FITC microbeads.
Additionally, volumes of the pre-clearing and secondary solutions were reduced 5-fold and the staining solution by 2fold.
For the first round of FACS, 1 x 108 induced cells were stained with 1 µM of directly AF488-labeled SARS-CoV-2 RBD
and 0.5 µM anti-HA AF647 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibody, to visualize expression, for 1 hr at 4°C. These cells
were then centrifuged, resuspended in 2 mL binding buffer, and sorted. In total, 35,000 cells from 11,431,000 were
collected and expanded. The second round of FACS was performed with similar conditions to the first; however, the
RBD was labeled with AF647, anti-HA with AF488, and the concentration of RBD was reduced to 150 nM. For the
second round, 104,000 cells were collected from 2,330,000 sorted. These cells were expanded in culture and then plated
on tryptophan dropout media to isolate single clones. Twenty-four colonies were picked, cultured, and induced. Each
culture was screened for binding by staining ~1 x 106 cells with 200 nM of 647- and 488-labeled RBD along with 488and 647-labeled anti-HA antibody, respectively, and binding reactions were evaluated using a BD Accuri flow cytometer.
Promising clones were selected as parents for AHEAD experiments.
FACS selection for improved RBD binders using the improved second-generation AHEAD system
After cloning the RBD-binding parent nanobodies into AHEAD (see Materials and Methods section “cloning
nanobodies into AHEAD”), initial cultures (50 mL SC-HLUW) were grown to saturation and optionally passaged once
or twice into 50 mL SC-HLUW at a ratio of 1:1000 to prolong diversification of the nanobodies before the first AHEAD
cycle. Upon final saturation (1-2 days), cells were pelleted and resuspended in SC-HLUW with 2% galactose replacing
glucose as the sole sugar source for induction. Induction was done for 24 hours at room temperature with shaking at 250
rpm. Cells were collected, washed in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% maltose)
and incubated with 1 µM mouse anti-HA antibody labeled and SARS-CoV-2 RBD directly labeled with AF647. Cells
were then washed and incubated with 0.5 µM goat anti-mouse AF488-labeled antibody (ThermoFisher) for 15 minutes.
The cells were subjected to FACS (SONY SH800) whereby 200-500 cells were collected into a culture tube containing
3 mL SC-HLUW out of ~2 x 107 sorted cells. Each subsequent cycle of AHEAD involved growing the 3 mL of sorted
cells with shaking at 30°C until saturation (1-2 days), induction with 2% galactose as the sole sugar source for ~24 hours
at room temperature with shaking at 250 rpm, washing of cells in binding buffer, incubation with anti-HA and labeled
RBD, washing steps to remove unbound RBD, and FACS sorting into 3 mL SC-HLUW. RBD concentrations were
diminished from cycle to cycle while the stringency of washes increased. After several rounds of AHEAD, nanobodies

were amplified from p1 and either sequenced directly or subcloned into a plasmid to isolate individual clones for
sequencing and further characterization.
Nanobody-Fc fusion purification
Nanobodies targeting RBD were expressed and secreted as Fc fusions by cloning into pFUSE-hlgG1-Fc2 (Invivogen)
using the NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites or by Gibson assembly. For each nanobody-Fc fusion, 100 mL of Expi293
cells were transfected with 90-150 µg of plasmid. After 1 day, cells were enhanced with 3 mM valproic acid and 0.45%
glucose. Cell supernatants were harvested 4 days after transfection. Before purification, supernatants were treated with
benzonase nuclease and protease inhibitor, then passed through a 0.22 µm filter. Nanobody-Fc fusion supernatants were
passed over a column with 4 mL protein G resin (ThermoFisher), which was then washed with 40 mL of HBS, eluted
with 100 mM citrate (pH 3) and then neutralized to pH 7 with concentrated HEPES (pH 8). Nanobody-Fc fusions were
then dialyzed twice with HBS (pH 7.5).
On-yeast EC50 measurements
To determine nanobody affinities for their targets as surface-displayed proteins, individual nanobody sequences were
cloned into plasmid p253, a plasmid for galactose-inducible expression of nanobodies for surface display in EBY100
cells. Plasmids were transformed into EBY100, induced in appropriate dropout media with 2% galactose as the sole sugar
source for ~24 hours at room temperature, washed with binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
BSA, 0.2% maltose), and labeled with biotinylated antigen across a range of concentrations as well as with 1 µM mouse
anti-HA antibody for 1 hour at 4°C. Cells were then washed and incubated 0.5 µM with goat anti-mouse AF488-labeled
antibody (ThermoFisher) and streptavidin conjugated PE (Abcam) for 15 minutes. After additional washing, fluorescence
was measured using an Attune flow cytometer (Life Technologies). Antigen binding (PE signal) was recorded only for
cells that express the nanobody, namely cells in populations showing anti-HA staining signal. Average PE signal at each
antigen concentration was determined and used to fit a one-site model in GraphPad Prism in order to determine the EC50.
In all cases, volumes and number of cells used were chosen to accommodate doing assays in 96-well format and to avoid
ligand depletion. Binding was measured in triplicate for each antigen concentration.
Surface plasmon resonance
SPR was performed using a Biacore T200 (Cytiva). Nanobody Fc fusion proteins were immobilized to a protein A sensor
chip (Cytiva) at a capture level of approximately 85–255 response units (RU). Binding experiments with dilutions of
RBD were performed in running buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween). RBD dilutions were
injected at a flow rate of 30 µL/min with a contact time of either 160 seconds or 280 seconds and a dissociation time of
600 seconds or 900 seconds. After each cycle, the protein A sensor chip was regenerated with 10 mM glycine-HCl pH
1.5. Kinetic data were double reference subtracted and fit to a 1:1 binding model. For samples in which the on or off rates
could not be determined, data were fit to a steady-state affinity model.
SARS-CoV-2 and VSV-G Lentivirus Production
To generate lentivirus pseudotypes, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein with the last 27 amino acids deleted (Genbank
ID: QJR84873.1 residues 1-1246) was cloned into a pCAGGS vector and modified to include at its C-terminal tail the
eight most membrane adjacent residues of the cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (NRVRQGYS).
Pseudotypes were packaged by transfecting HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-11268) using lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen)
with SARS-CoV-2 S in pCAGGS or VSV G in pCAGGS (as previously described (34)), in addition to a packaging vector
containing HIV Gag, Pol, Rev, and Tat (psPAX2, provided by Didier Trono, Addgene # 12260), and a pLenti transfer
vector containing GFP (pLenti-EF1a-Backbone, a gift from Feng Zhang (35), Addgene plasmid #27963). After 18 hours,
the transfection medium was removed from cells and replaced with DMEM containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 50 mM HEPES. Cells were incubated at 34°C, before the supernatant was then harvested at 48 and 72 hours,
centrifuged at 3000 x g, and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter. The filtered supernatant was then concentrated by layering

on a 10 % (v/v) sucrose cushion in Tris Buffered Saline (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA) and
spun at 10,000 x g for 4 hours at 4°C. The viral pellet was resuspended in Opti-MEM containing 5% (v/v) FBS and stored
at -80°C.
Pseudotype Neutralization Experiments
Nanobodies or PBS alone were pre-incubated with SARS-CoV-2 or VSV G lentivirus for 60 minutes at 37°C in a mixture
that also contained 0.5 µg/ml polybrene. Mixtures were then added to HEK293T cells overexpressing human ACE2 (a
gift from Dr. Huihui Mou and Dr. Michael Farzan, Scripps Research). After 24 hours the virus medium was removed
and replaced with DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 5% (v/v) Pen/Strep, and 1 µg/mL puromycin. The percentage of
GFP positive cells was determined by flow cytometry with an iQue Screener PLUS (Intellicyt) 48 hours after initial
infection. Percent relative entry was calculated using the following equation: Relative Entry (%) = (% GFP positive cells
in nanobody well)/(%GFP positive cells in PBS alone well). Percent neutralization was calculated using the following
equation: Neutralization (%) = 1- (% GFP positive cells in nanobody well)/(% GFP positive cells in PBS alone well). All
experiments were performed twice in triplicate.
ACE2 competition assays using biolayer Interferometry
Biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments for ACE2 competition assays were performed with an Octet RED96e
(Sartorius). For ACE2 competition assays, biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD was loaded onto streptavidin (SA) sensors
(ForteBio) at 1.5 µg/ml for 80 seconds. After a baseline measurement was obtained, nanobodies were associated at 250
nM for 300 seconds, followed by an association with ACE2-Fc at 250 nM for 300 seconds. Representative results of two
replicates for each experiment are shown.
Recombinant RBD expression and purification
Two preparations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank ID: QHD43416.1, residues 319541) were used in this study. For ACE2 competition assays, RBD was cloned into the pHLsec vector (Ref. PMID:
17001101). The construct contains an N-terminal 6xHis tag, a TEV protease site, and a BirA ligase site followed by a 7residue linker. RBD was produced by transfecting HEK293T cells grown in suspension and harvested after 5 days and
was purified by reverse nickel affinity purification. The RBD was then biotinylated with BirA ligase and again purified
using reverse nickel affinity purification to remove the BirA ligase, followed by size exclusion purification on a Superdex
200 Increase column (GE Healthcare). For all other experiments including AHEAD evolution of anti-RBD nanobodies
and their characterization, a pVRC8400 plasmid containing RBD was used for RBD expression (36). The construct
(pVRC8400-RBD) has RBD fused to a C-terminal HRV C3 protease cleavage site followed by an 8XHis tag and a
streptavidin binding peptide (SBP). 0.5 mg of plasmid was transfected into HEK293T cells and grown in suspension for
3 days. Culture media was then dialyzed against PBS overnight and RBD was purified using Ni-NTA agarose
(ThermoFisher). The eluted His-tagged RBD was then incubated with biotin-tagged HRV C3 protease (Sigma) and
passed through a streptavidin-agarose column to deplete the protease and the 8XHis-SBP peptide. The eluate was
collected and analyzed on a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel to confirm purity of the RBD.
Recombinant ACE2-Fc fusion protein expression and purification
To generate a recombinant ACE2 Fc-fusion protein, we cloned the ectodomain of human ACE2 (GenBank ID:
BAB40370.1 residues 18-740) with a C-terminal Fc tag into the pVRC8400 vector containing the human IgG1 Fc. We
transfected the construct (pVRC8400-hACE2) into Expi293FTM cells using an ExpiFectamineTM transfection kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The supernatant was harvested after 5 days and purified using a MabSelect
SuRE Resin (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion purification on a Superose 6 Increase column (GE Healthcare).
The supernatant was harvested 5 days after transfection and purified with a CaptrueSelect KappaXL Affinity Matrix
(Thermo Scientific) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex200 Increase column (GE Healthcare).

Cloning a 200,000-member nanobody library into AHEAD2.0
A computationally designed 200,000-member naïve nanobody CDR3 library was synthesized as an oligonucleotide pool
of CDR3 sequences by Agilent, as previously reported (29). To clone this CDR3 library into AHEAD, we first made
plasmid pAW240-NbCM, which encodes the nanobody scaffold with fixed CDR1 and CDR2 sequences but with CDR3
replaced with a NotI restriction site. The CDR3 oligo library was then inserted into pAW240-NbCM using the NotI site
and ligation. Transformation of the ligated plasmid products into E. coli resulted in ~108 transformants. 200 µg of plasmid
DNA was then prepared, linearized with ScaI (NEB) and transformed into strain yAW301 by scaling up the process
described in Materials and Methods section “cloning nanobodies into AHEAD” 100-fold. The total transformation
resulted in ~107 transformants such that the 200,000-member library was covered 50X.
Selection and affinity maturation of a GFP binding nanobody from a computationally designed naïve nanobody library
encoded on AHEAD
A 10 mL saturated culture of yAW301 cells expressing the computationally deigned 200,000-member naïve nanobody
library was induced in SC-HLUW with 2% galactose replacing glucose as the sole sugar source. Induction was done for
24 hours at room temperature with shaking at 250 rpm. Cells were collected, washed in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% maltose), and first subjected to negative selection against streptavidin binders
by MACS. Specifically, cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4 °C with 0.5 µM streptavidin-conjugated FITC, washed, and
incubated with anti-FITC microbeads (Miltenyi). Cells were washed again and passed through an LD column to deplete
streptavidin binders. Recovered cells eluted from the column were incubated with 200 nM GFP-biotin and 1 µM mouse
anti-HA antibody. Cells were washed and incubated for 15 minutes in binding buffer containing 0.5 µM goat anti-mouse
AF488-labeled antibody (ThermoFisher) and streptavidin-conjugated AF647. Cells were washed again and subjected to
the first cycle of FACS for GFP binders. In the following cycles of AHEAD, cells were incubated with GFP directly
labeled with AF647 (Fig. S8). These cycles of AHEAD followed the same process for nanobody evolution using AHEAD
2.0 described above.

Functional display of AT110 and 4-4-20 from AHEAD1.0.
When we first examined whether functional surface display was feasible from p1, by testing the 4-4-20 scFv and the
AT110 nanobody, we used the wild type DNAP for replicating p1 (Fig. 1C). However, when we transitioned to using
the error prone polymerase, TP-DNAP1-4-2 the functional display levels dropped significantly (Fig. S2D) resulting from
a decline in p1’s copy number as described previously (3, 4). The weak binding signal limited FACS selections, thus we
overcame these limitations by MACS, and later on by designing AHEAD2.0 as described below.
Enhancing nanobody expression by promoter and secretory leader engineering.
Our evolution of improved AT110 nanobodies was performed using AHEAD 1.0, a system that conferred low nanobody
expression. As discussed in the main text, in that experiment, insufficient nanobody expression was overcome by
implementing a MACS enrichment protocol for cells that had the highest levels of nanobody expression. However, this
introduces additional days to the AHEAD cycle because of the time required for MACS and because cells from the (N1)th cycle of AHEAD need to populate larger culture volumes in the Nth cycle of AHEAD in order to have sufficient
numbers of cells for FACS after a selective MACS step for high expressers. Therefore, the requirement for MACS
enrichment, while seemingly simple, significantly eroded the goals of AHEAD by both extending the time for an AHEAD
cycle and reducing parallelizability, given the increased difficulty of working with large cultures. To solve these issues,
we sought to increase expression of nanobodies to the point where MACS pre-enrichment for expression was not
required. To obtain higher expression of yeast displayed nanobodies from p1, we targeted the promoter and the secretory
leader sequence for engineering. Fortunately, in an unrelated OrthoRep continuous experiment performed (G.
Arzumanyan, unpublished), three expression-enhancing promoter mutations were discovered in the p1-specific p10B2
promoter, which was the strongest promoter for driving expression from p1 at that time (4). We tested all possible
combinations of the three promoter mutations, which revealed a pair of mutations, G5A and G34A (upstream to the start
codon) that together increased nanobody expression by 3.5-fold. The new promoter containing those mutations was
dubbed pGA. To improve display efficiency further, we chose to engineer the strongest known alpha factor secretory
leader, app8 (8). As described in Materials and Methods, an error-prone PCR library of app8 variants was screened for
mutants that raised display levels, leading to app8i1. Finally, a poly adenosine tail (A75) followed by a self-cleaving
hammerhead ribozyme (RZ) was added to the nanobody expression and display cassette on p1 in order to confer an
additional increase in expression following our past work (4). With the improved system, productive FACS selections
for antigen binding by displayed nanobodies could be implemented after every cycle of cell propagation in small culture
volumes of 2-5 mL. This led to an AHEAD 2.0 cycle time of only 3 days with high parallelizability.
Interestingly, many of the AHEAD 2.0 evolution experiments described in this paper led to fixation of additional
mutations in the pGA promoter as well as the app8 leader. Although these mutations have not been characterized in this
study, they likely fixed because they increased nanobody display efficiency and robustness and will be useful for future
versions of AHEAD.

Specific considerations for gating during FACS in AHEAD experiments.
In yeast display antibody evolution, one typically gates for target-binding normalized to the nanobody display level. To
measure nanobody display levels, we used a human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag fused to the nanobody. We then
gated on the ratio of [target (i.e. RBD) binding]:[HA tag binding by a fluorescently labeled anti-HA antibody]. In other
words, during selection for better target binding, we gate along a slope on the FACS plot where the Y-axis is HA level
and X-axis is target-binding level (see Fig. S5 for examples). However, since AHEAD hypermutates the entire content
of p1, it is possible to obtain mutations in the HA tag that disable it, creating cells that have seemingly strong target
binding per nanobody displayed if sorted exclusively for cells with a high [target binding]:[HA signal] ratio. This can
lead to the gradual fixation of cheaters that actually bind the target weakly but were selected because they also have
disabled HA tags. To overcome this issue, it is important to gate with a strict floor on HA signal rather than solely on the
[target binding]:[HA signal] ratio. In our experiments, we found that if the floor for HA signal was set to include only
the top ~20% of cells on the HA signal axis (Y-axis), we could maintain selection for target-binding throughout rounds
without carrying over cheaters that mutated the HA tag.

Table S3. List of key plasmids used in this study
Name
Details
pGKL1-shortIntegration plasmid for replacing wild-type p1’s
M17
immunity genes with MET17 in order to generate the
landing pad p1 for transfer into other strains and ease of
nanobody integration onto p1.
pAR-633-Leu2
A yeast CEN/ARS nuclear plasmid that expresses the
error prone TP-DNAP1-4-2 with a Leu2 marker for
selection.
pAW24
Integration plasmid for encoding nanobodies onto p1 in
the AHEAD 1.0 format. In the parent plasmid, the
nanobody AT110 is encoded in the integration cassette in
the plasmid, but this nanobody can be replaced with any
nanobody of interest through subcloning. The linear
integration cassette generated from this plasmid by ScaI
digestion integrates into p1 or landing pad p1 while
deleting immunity genes (in the case of p1) and the TPDNAP1 (in the case of p1 and landing pad p1).
pAW240
Integration plasmid for encoding nanobodies onto
landing pad p1 in the AHEAD 2.0 format. In the parent
plasmid, the nanobody AT110 is encoded in the
integration cassette in the plasmid, but this nanobody can
be replaced with any nanobody of interest through
subcloning. The linear integration cassette generated
from this plasmid by ScaI digestion integrates into
landing pad p1 while deleting the TP-DNAP1 on the
landing pad p1.
pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc Nanobody-Fc fusion expression plasmid. All RBD
nanobodies characterized by SPR and neutralization
assays were subcloned into this plasmid, expressed, and
purified.
FDP-P10B2Source for polyA-RZ to augment nanobody expression.
