Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent coronavirus
that has caused a worldwide pandemic. Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some
develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent
need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to
40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARSCoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLAAddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong
Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral
replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2.
CORAVAX also prevented lung disease, as indicated by the significant reduction in lung
pathology. This study highlights CORAVAX as a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious vaccine
that warrants further assessment in human trials.

Introduction
More than 150 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are in preclinical trials, and over 51 candidate
vaccines are in human trials (1). They include adenovirus and other viral vector-based vaccines
and protein-, DNA-, and mRNA-based vaccines (2).
These vaccine approaches have different advantages and disadvantages. mRNA vaccines,
including the 2 U.S. FDA-approved coronavirus vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech,
can be produced efficiently, but they can be costly to produce and have temperature sensitivity
(3); furthermore, questions remain unanswered about the longevity of the immune response
with mRNA vaccines and if they block transmission. Meanwhile, DNA-based vaccines benefit
from temperature stability and low production costs, but their immunogenicity has been a
concern, and the need for multiple vaccinations challenges their feasibility (4). Virus-like particle
(VLP)- and recombinant protein-based vaccines have an excellent safety advantage because
they do not replicate in the host, and often they can also be made more temperature stable.
However, VLP-based vaccines are not always as immunogenic as replication-competent or
replication-deficient viral vector vaccines and often require an adjuvant to increase their
immunogenicity to an adequately protective level (5, 6). Finally, viral vector-based vaccines the
advantage of being typically cheaper to produce, efficacious after a single vaccination, and often
highly immunogenic (1, 7-9), but those based on live viral vaccines sometimes fail because of
safety concerns and production scalability, and they usually require a low storage temperature
(8). The disadvantages of viral vector vaccines are largely overcome, however, when they are
based on an inactivated virus.
Using this approach, we have developed an inactivated viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV2 that is based on the rabies virus (RABV). We have previously utilized this approach to develop
inactivated RABV-based vaccines for several other human pathogens (e.g., Ebola virus,
Marburg virus, Lassa Fever virus and others) (10-27). These rabies virus-based vaccines have
been proven to be highly immunogenic and protective against several emerging viral infections

and bacterial toxins, as well as safe and temperature stable (28). The RABV vaccine itself has
been safely used for decades in more than 100 million people, including children, pregnant
women, and the elderly, and proven to result in long-lasting immunity (29).
CORAVAX, our rabies vectored SARS COV-2 vaccine, expresses the S1 domain of the SARSCoV-2 spike (S) protein fused to part of the N terminal domain of the RABV glycoprotein (G) and
is incorporated in RABV particles. Mice immunized with adjuvanted CORAVAX developed
potent neutralizing antibodies about 5-10 times higher than the virus-neutralizing antibodies
(VNA) detected in convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected people (30). Here, to learn
more, we evaluated the efficacy of CORAVAX in the Syrian hamster model for SARS-CoV-2,
which is currently considered the best model to study COVID-19 therapies and therapeutics.
Our results showed that two immunizations with the adjuvanted CORAVAX vaccine induced
high VNA and cleared infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the lung and the nasal turbinates on day 3
post challenge. Moreover, the pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 was reduced with only some
early infiltration of cells into the lung tissue. Taken together, this study indicates that CORAVAX
warrants further development as a disease-preventing human vaccine.

Results

Immunogenicity of CORAVAX in Syrian hamsters
CORAVAX a rabies vectored SARS COV-2 vaccine was generated by inserting the S1 subunit
of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike into the SAD-B19 rabies vaccine strain. To promote the incorporation
of the S1 domain, we prepared a fusion protein between SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RABV G. Toward
this approach, the N-terminal 682 aa of SARS-CoV-2 S1 were fused to a truncated RABV
glycoprotein, which comprises 31 aa of the ectodomain (ED) of RABV G and the complete
cytoplasmic domain (CD) and transmembrane domain of RABV G to allow chimeric glycoprotein
incorporation into RABV virions. We previously showed that CORAVAX induces high virus
neutralizing antibodies as a live or inactivated vaccine in mice (30). Here we extend these
studies in the more relevant SARS CoV-2 Syrian Hamster model of severe disease.
To evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of the CORAVAX vaccine in golden Syrian
hamsters, we vaccinated each group comprising 12 animals with either 10 g of inactivated
CORAVAX or control vaccine FILORAB1 (rabies vectored Ebola vaccine) adjuvanted with
MPLA-AddaVax in a 100 L injection volume via the intramuscular route (Figure 1A). The
animals received a prime on day 0 and a booster on day 28. Blood was collected on days -2,
26, and 56 (Figure 1B). On day 60, vaccinated and control hamsters were challenged
intranasally with a dose of 105 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA_WA1/2020 (31).
In the next step, sera from immunized hamsters and controls were assayed for SARS CoV-2
specific antibody responses by ELISA specific for SARS-CoV-2 S1 and receptor binding site
(RBD) (Figure 2). High titers of SARS-COV-2 S1 specific IgG responses were detected in the
CORAVAX vaccinated hamsters on day 26 with no significant differences in antibody titers on
day 56 (Figure 2A). As expected, no SARS-CoV-2 S1 immune response was detected in the
control animals vaccinated with the EBOV vaccine FILORAB1. As previously seen for other
inactivated and adjuvanted RABV-based vaccines, CORAVAX induced a Th1 biased immune

response as indicated by the high SARS CoV-2 S1 IgG2/3 responses detected on days 26 and
56 (Figure 2B). We could not detect S1 specific IgG1 responses in any of the hamsters (data
not shown). Similar to the responses detected by ELISA to SARS CoV-2 S1, we observed high
titers of SARS-CoV-2 VNA with mean titers of 976  SD 685 on day 56 (Figure 2C). Of note, no
VNA against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in FILORAB1 immunized animals before the
challenge (Figure 2C).
We next analyzed the immune responses post-challenge (p.c.). By day 63, 3 days p.c.,
we observed a significant reduction (P=0.0069) in S1 IgG responses in CORAVAX vaccinated
animals, while no S1-specific IgG responses were observed in the controls hamsters
(FILORAB1) (Figure 2A,C). By day 75, both in CORAVAX and FILORAB1 vaccinated and
challenged hamsters, S1-specific IgG and VNA were detected (Figure 2A,B,C). However, both
S1-specific IgG and VNA were significantly higher in the CORAVAX vaccinated animals on day
75 (Figure 2A, C). Moreover, p.c. CORAVAX vaccinated animals indicated a more robust Th1biased immune response compared to FILORAB1 control animals, as indicated by the IgG2/3
responses (Figure 2B). In addition to the antibodies directed against the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) SARS-CoV-2, high RBD-specific IgG titers were detected in the CORAVAX
vaccinated animals on day 56 as well as p.c. on days 63 and 75. Interestingly, the RBD IgG
titers were undetectable in the FILORAB1 vaccinated controls on day 63 but were higher than
the ELISA titers detected in CORAVAX vaccinated animals on day 75, challenging the dogma
that high ELISA titer against RBD predict the VNA against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2D).

CORAVAX induces potent immune responses against RABV
We also analyzed the VNA induced by the two vaccines against RABV. CORAVAX is a vaccine
against both SARS-CoV-2 and RABV, and in large part of the world RABV is still a significant
problem, <<annually?>> killing about 55,000 people, mostly children. We detected a titer of anti-

RABV neutralizing antibodies above the WHO's 0.5 IU standard in both the FILORAB1 and
CORAVAX vaccinated animals, with no significant differences (Figure 3).

CORAVAX protects the hamsters from weight loss and viral burden in the lungs and
nasal turbinates post-SARS CoV-2 challenge
The hamsters were challenged intranasally on day 60 with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 isolate
USA_WA1/2020 and were monitored for up to 15 days. The CORAVAX vaccinated animals
showed significantly less weight loss than the FILORAB1 controls (P=0.0098), which lost more
than 10% weight and recovered only at day 11 (Figure 4). At days 3 and 15 p.c., half of the
hamsters in each study group were euthanized, and lungs and nasal turbinates were harvested
and virus isolated to determine viral loads by plaque reduction assay (Figure 5A, B).
Additionally, the number of viral copies was analyzed by RT-qPCR assay (Figure 5C, D). The
lack of weight loss coincided with the absence of any infectious virus in the lungs and nasal
turbinates of the CORAVAX vaccinated animals on days 3 and 15 p.c. (Figure 5A and B).
In contrast to the CORAVAX immunized animals, the FILORAB1 controls had high titers of
infectious virus in the lungs and nasal turbinates on day 3 p.c.. As expected, both groups
cleared the SARS-CoV-2 15 days.
A similar trend between the two groups was detected when RNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 were
analyzed via RT-PCR. CORAVAX vaccinated animals had significantly reduced RNA copies in
the lungs and nasal turbinates at necropsy (day 3 and 15 p.c.) than the control FILORAB1 group
(Figure 5C, D). The presence of viral RNA in the absence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 is wellestablished and based on the stability of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (32, 33). However, it
should be noted that the ~1000-fold lower copy number in CORAVAX vaccinated animals
indicates a significant reduction of viral replication by CORAVAX.

CORAVAX vaccinated animals have significantly reduced lung pathology than controls
Lung sections were collected from control and vaccinated animals at days 3 and 15 p.c. (Figure
6, 7). Sections were scored in a blinded manner. Histopathological changes consistent with viral
interstitial pneumonia were noted in all animals, regardless of treatment or time of collection
(Figure 6, representative pathology pictures; Figure 7A, B mean overall pathology scores).
These included consolidation, widespread alveolar septal thickening, and airway pathology
consisting of airway epithelial hyperplasia and accumulation of inflammatory cells in airways,
occasionally leading to obstruction of the lumen. On day 3 p.c., CORAVAX vaccinated animals
had significantly lower average pathology scores. Specifically, component scores for
inflammatory foci size and number and airway pathology were improved (Figure 7A). Animals
cleared the virus by day 15 (Figure 5A, B), and consistent with expected tissue damage repair
following clearance, we observed reduced pathology in both CORAVAX and the control
FILORAB1 vaccinated animals (Figure 7B).

Discussion
There is an urgent need for a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 that can be
administered to pregnant women, children, elderly and the immunocompromised. The two FDA
emergency use authorization (EUA) COVID-19 vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and
mRNA-1273 (Moderna), are based on the mRNA platform have shown promising results with
efficacy above 90% (34, 35). Neither of these EUA COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use in
pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children below the age of 18, and the
immunocompromised (36), and they have yet to demonstrate long-lasting immune responses.
Therefore, other vaccine approaches are still needed.
This study is the first to show the efficacy of a RABV vectored COVID-19 vaccine, CORAVAX,
in the Syrian hamster model of severe disease.

advantages: 1) it has an excellent safety profile, as it is used as an inactivated vaccine; 2) there
is historical evidence of long-term immunity; 3) it can be administered safely and effectively to
the vulnerable populations of children, pregnant women, elderly, and immunocompromised; 4)
pre-existing rabies immunity does not affect the boosting potential of the vaccine; 5) RABV
virions incorporate foreign antigens easily; and 6) RABV-based vaccines show excellent
temperature stability (2, 19, 28).
Our vaccine approaches used only part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using S1 rather than
the full spike protein as the immunogen ensures the immune responses against the important
neutralizing epitopes identified in human convalescent patients recognizing the RBD, NTD S1,
and quaternary epitope that bridges the two RBDs (37). Our use of the S1 in CORAVAX might
explain the higher VNA titers in the Syrian hamsters compared to other Covid-19 vaccines
utilizing the full spike as the antigen in yellow fever and Ad26 vectors as well as in a DNA
vaccine platform (38-40).
Several candidate vaccines against Covid-19 utilizing DNA, RNA, viral vectors, inactivated
vaccines and subunit vaccine platforms are in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical
development (41). While the immune correlates of protection are yet to be determined, most
candidate vaccines trials compare their antibody and neutralizing response to SARS-CoV-2
convalescent sera. Clinical trials with convalescent plasma treatment have shown little or no
significant difference in outcomes among SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to placebo group (42,
43). Also, most convalescent plasma samples obtained from individuals who recover from
COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity (44).
CORAVAX induced high SARS CoV-2 S1 and RBD specific antibody and neutralizing titers on
day 26 post the prime vaccination. The antibody and neutralizing titers were slightly (but not
significantly) increased on day 56 after the boost (on day 28). CORAVAX also induced a strong

Th1 biased immune response indicated by the IgG2/3 response before the challenge. Postchallenge, CORAVAX vaccinated animals induced significantly higher S1 IgG titers than the
controls that correlated well with the neutralizing antibody response. Interestingly the RBD IgG
titers were higher in the control animals at day 15 p.c. than CORAVAX vaccinating animals. The
correlation of the S1 IgG titers with that of neutralizing antibody responses in the CORAVAX
vaccinated animals suggests that the S1 IgG titers are a better predictor of protection than the
RBD IgG titers. Our result aligns with the Chi et al. study that identified non-RBD binding, SARS
CoV-2 S1 N terminal domain (NTD) binding neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent
patients (45). It has also been suggested that the non-RBD binding S1 antibodies could be
restraining the conformational changes of the S protein, thereby preventing viral entry.
Conversely, vaccines that induce only RBD antibodies alone might induce resistance mutations
in the virus (46). CORAVAX induces antibodies against the RBD as well other epitopes of S1.
Antibodies induced in the CORAVAX vaccinated hamsters protected them from weight loss post
challenge, while FILORAB1 vaccinated animals showed weight loss. The absence of infectious
virus in the lungs and nasal turbinates of the CORAVAX vaccinated animals at day 3 p.c.
suggests that CORAVAX can control viral transmission. Additionally, CORAVAX vaccinated
animals showed significantly reduced lung pathology and inflammatory foci in comparison to the
control group, suggesting that CORAVAX can dramatically reduce disease in vaccinated
animals.
Regarding the adjuvant, we previously showed that

GLA-SE adjuvanted FILORAB1 rabies

virus-based EBOLA vaccine, protected 100% of NHPs challenged with Ebola, an improvement
from the unadjuvanted FILORAB1 vaccine, which was less protective. This protection was
attributed to the strong Th1 biased immune response induced by GLA-SE, which is a synthetic
TRL4 agonist (20). To induce a stronger Th1 biased response in our study, we utilized another
TRL4 agonist, MPLA-AddaVax, because MPLA is a TLR4 agonist and AddaVax is squalene-

based oil-in-water nano-emulsion (similar to SE component in GLA-SE). MPLA has been shown
to enhance the immunogenicity and protection of the rabies vaccine with induction of plasma
cell responses. MPLA vaccinated mice accelerated the activation of dendritic cells, improving Tdependent B cell responses driving antibody production that skewed towards a strong Th1 bias
(47). As seen for mild COVID-19 patients, a Th1 biased immune response is beneficial for
protection protection against disease (48). Our previous work demonstrated that CORAVAX
induced a strong Th1 biased immune response in Balb/C mice by generating higher IgG2a
antibodies (30). In Syrian hamsters, CORAVAX vaccinated animals induced a stronger S1
IgG2/3 response before challenge. More importantly, the CORAVAX vaccinated hamsters
mounted a significantly higher S1 IgG2/3 on day 15 p.c. than the FILORAB1 vaccinated
animals. We could not detect S1 IgG1 responses, but we could detect RABV-G IgG1
responses, suggesting that S1 IgG1 antibodies are present at low levels or absent.
In conclusion, our RABV-vectored COVID-19 vaccine CORAVAX is efficacious and is able to
prevent viral replication and reduce disease in Syrian hamsters. CORAVAX also serves as a
vaccine against RABV because it induces high RABV VNA. Future studies assessing the
efficacy of a single CORAVAX vaccine will be performed since we did not see a dramatic
booster effect in immune responses among the hamsters. CORAVAX production should be
relatively easy as it would follow the existing RABV vaccine manufacturing facilities and
technologies. Additionally, the use of the adjuvant might allow for dose sparing. These results
warrant further examination of CORAVAX in clinical trials to be conducted by Bharat Biotech
International Ltd.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies
The following SARS-CoV-2 specific human monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by
Distributed Bio: COVID-19 DB_A03-09, 12; DB_B01-04, B07-10, 12; DB_C01-05, 07, 09, 10;
DB_D01, 02; DB_E01-04, 06, 07; DB_F02-03.

Viruses
The SARS-CoV-2 strain used in this study is the first U.S. isolate SARS-CoV-2 USA_WA1/2020
from the Washington State patient identified on January 22, 2020 (31). Passage 3 was obtained
from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at UTMB.
Virus stocks were propagated in Vero E6 cells. The challenge stock used in this study is
passage 5. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing Neon Green protein (SARS-CoV-2-mNG)
(49) used in the neutralization assay was developed by Dr. Pei-Yong Shi at UTMB. Virus stocks
were propagated in Vero E6 cells and a passage 4 was used.

Vaccine production and purification
Recombinant RABV were recovered, purified, inactivated, and titered. Briefly, X-tremeGENE 9
transfection reagent (Millipore Sigma, Cat# 6365809001) was used to cotransfect the full-length
viral cDNA clone encoding CORAVAX along with the plasmids encoding RABV N, P, and L
proteins and the T7 RNA polymerase into BEAS-2B human lung cells in 6-well plates (RABV).
At 8 days post transfection, supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane
filter (Millipore), and titrated on VERO cells. The presence of recombinant virus was verified by
immunostaining with monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein (FujiRebio, Cat# 800-092)
and polyclonal antiserum against the S1 domain (Thermo Fisher, Cat# PA581798). The filtered
virus was then used to inoculate VERO cells seeded in Cellstack Culture Chambers (Corning)
and propagated in VP-SFM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) over a period of 18 days.

Supernatant collected on day 10 post infection was filtered through 0.45 µm PES membrane
filters (Nalgene) and layered onto 20% sucrose in DPBS. Virions were sedimented by
ultracentrifugation in a SW32 rotor for 1.5 h at 25,000 rpm. Viral particles were resuspended in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inactivated with 50 μl per mg of particles of a 1:100
dilution of β-propiolactone (BPL, Millipore Sigma, Cat# P5648) in cold water. The absence of
infectious particles was verified by inoculating BSR cells with 10 μg of BPL-inactivated viruses
over 3 passages.

Animal studies
The studies were carried out in a strict accordance with the recommendations described in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. UTMB is
an AAALAC-accredited institution and all animal work was approved by the IACUC Committee
of UTMB. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and all procedures involving
potential pain were performed with the appropriate anesthetic or analgesic. The number of
hamsters used was scientifically justified based on statistical analyses of virological and
immunological outcomes.

Vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 challenge
Seven-week-old golden Syrian female hamsters (Envigo) were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane
prior to immunization and blood collections and with ketamine/xylazine prior to the SARS-CoV-2
challenge. On day 0, 12 animals per group were inoculated with 10 g of CORAVAX or
FILORAB1 (control vaccine), adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax (Per animal: 5 g MPLAs,
InvivoGen, cat# vac-mpls; 50L AddaVax, InvivoGen, cat#-adx-vac) in a 100 µl injection volume
via the intramuscular route (50 µl per hind leg). The animals received a boost on day 28. Vena
cava blood collections were performed two days prior the immunization, on day 26 and day 56.

On day 60, vaccinated and control animals were exposed intranasally to the targeted dose of
105 PFU of isolate SARS-CoV-2. Animals were monitored daily for weight loss and signs of
disease. Half of the animals in each group (6 vaccinated and 6 control hamsters) was
euthanized by overdose of injectable anesthetics on day 3 p.c. (day 63) for viral load
determination. The remaining animals (5 vaccinated and 6 control hamsters) were euthanized
on day 15 post challenge (p.c.) (day 75). One animal in the CORAVAX group did not recover
from anesthesia after challenge.

Recombinant proteins for ELISA
Purification of the HA-tagged protein from the supernatant of transfected cells for ELISA
Sub-confluent T175 flasks of 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were transfected
with a pDisplay vector encoding amino acids 16 to 682 of SARS-CoV-2 S (S1) fused to a Cterminal hemagglutinin (HA) peptide using X-tremeGENE 9 reagent (Millipore Sigma, Cat#
6365809001). Supernatant was collected 6 days post-transfection, filtered through 0.22 um PES
membrane filters (Nalgene) and the loaded onto an anti-HA agarose (Pierce, Cat# 26182)
column equilibrated in PBS. After washing with ten bed volumes of PBS the column was loaded
with 2 column volumes of HA peptide at a concentration of 400 µg/ml in PBS and incubated
overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of HA
peptide followed by two column volumes of PBS. Fractions were collected and analyzed by
western blotting with polyclonal antiserum against the S1 domain (Thermo Fisher, Cat#
PA581798). Peak fractions were then pooled and dialyzed against PBS in 10,000 molecular
weight cutoff (MWCO) dialysis cassettes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove excess HA
peptide. After dialysis, the protein was quantitated by UV spectrophotometry and frozen in small
aliquots at −80 °C.

RBD-HIS (50): The SARS CoV-2 RBD-His tagged plasmid was purchased from Bei Resources
(NR-52309). Sub-confluent T175 flasks of 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were
transfected with the RBD-His tagged plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 reagent (Millipore Sigma,
Cat# 6365809001). Supernatant was collected 6 days post-transfection and filtered through
0.22 μm PES membrane filters (Nalgene). The 5 mL HisTALON cartridge (Clontech
Laboratories, Cat # 635683) column was equilibrated with 10 column volumes of Equilibration
Buffer (HisTALON™ Buffer Set, Clontech Laboratories, Cat# 635651). The filtered supernatant
was loaded onto the HisTALON cartridge (Clontech Laboratories, Cat# 635683) column at a
speed of 1 mL/min. After washing with ten column volumes of Wash Buffer (prepared by mixing
6.6 parts of Elution Buffer with 93.4 parts of Equilibration Buffer of the HisTALON™ Buffer Set),
the sample is eluted (at a flow rate of ~1 ml/min) with approximately 8 column volumes of
Elution Buffer, collecting 1 ml fractions. The sample protein concentration was assessed by
measuring the absorbance of the eluted fractions at 280 nm (Nanodrop, Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Eluted fractions were analyzed by western blotting with a mouse monoclonal RBD
specific antibody (InvivoGen, Cat# srbd-mab10). Peak fractions were then pooled and dialyzed
against PBS in 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) dialysis cassettes (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). After dialysis, the protein was quantitated by UV spectrophotometry and frozen in
small aliquots at −80 °C.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
To determine antibody responses to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, an indirect ELISA was
developed utilizing purified S1 or receptor binding domain (RBD) protein. The production of the
recombinant proteins is described above. Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD
protein were measured by an indirect ELISA. We tested individual hamster sera by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of IgG specific to SARS-Cov-2 S1 or
RBD. In order to test for anti-SARS CoV-2 S1 humoral responses, we produced soluble S1 or

RBD as described above. The two recombinant proteins were resuspended in coating buffer
(50 mM Na2CO3 [pH 9.6]) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL of S1 or 2 μg/mL of RBD, and then
they were plated in 96-well ELISA MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) at 100 μl in each well. After overnight
incubation at 4 °C, plates were washed 3 times with 1× PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in 1× PBS),
followed by the addition of 250 μl blocking buffer (5% dry milk powder in 1× PBST) and
incubation at room temperature for 1.5 h. The plates were then washed 3 times with PBST and
incubated overnight at 4 °C with serial dilutions of sera (in triplicate) in 1× PBST containing 0.5%
BSA. Plates were washed 3 times the next day, followed by the addition of HRP-conjugated
goat anti-Syrian hamster IgG secondary antibody (Jackson immunoresearch, Cat# 107-035142, 1:8000 in PBST) or mouse anti-hamster-IgG2/3-HRP (Southern Biotech, Cat# 1935-05,
1:8000 in PBST) or mouse anti-hamster-IgG1-HRP (Southern Biotech, Cat# 1940-05, 1:8000 in
PBST) for 2 h at RT. After the incubation, plates were washed three times with PBST, and
200 μl of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) substrate (Sigma) was added to each well.
The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 3 M H2SO4 per well. Optical density was
determined at 490 nm (OD490) and 630 nm (OD630) using an ELX800 plate reader (Biotek
Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Plates were incubated for 15 min (IgG) or 20 min (IgG2/3 or
IgG1) with OPD substrate before the reaction was stopped with 3 M H 2SO4. Data were analyzed
with GraphPad Prism (Version 8.0 g) using 4-parameter nonlinear regression to determine the
titer at which the curves reach 50% of the top plateau value (50% effective concentration
[EC50]).

Neutralizing antibody response
Sera collected from animals were tested for neutralizing capabilities against SARS-CoV-2.
Briefly, serum samples were heat-inactivated (30 min at 56°C), and then 10-fold diluted sera
were further diluted in a 2-fold serial fashion, and 60 µl of each serum dilution was mixed with
60 µl of SARS-CoV-2-mNG (200 PFU) (49). The serum/virus mixtures were incubated for 1 h at

37°C. 100 µl of the serum/virus mixtures were then transferred to Vero E6 cell monolayers in
flat-bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 2 days at 37°C. Virus fluorescence was measured
with a Cytation Hybrid Multi-Mode reader at 488 nm (Biotek Instruments).

Tissue processing and viral load determination
Animals were euthanized on days 3 and 15 p.c., and lungs and nasal turbinates were
harvested. Right lungs and nasal turbinates were placed in L15 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (Gibco). Tissues were
homogenized using the TissueLyser II system (Qiagen) and tissue homogenates were aliquoted
and stored at -80ºC. Tissue homogenates were titrated on Vero E6 cell monolayers in 24-well
plates to determine viral loads. Plates were incubated 3 days at 37°C before being fixed with
10% formalin and removed from containment. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining with
1 µg/mL cocktail of 37 SARS-CoV-2 specific human antibodies kindly provided by Distributed
Bio. As the secondary antibody, HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (SeraCare) was used at
dilution 1:500. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1X DPBS with 5% milk.
Plaques were revealed by AEC substrate (enQuire Bioreagents).

Viral RNA copies by qRT-PCR
Tissue homogenates were mixed with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) at a 1:5 volume ratio
of homogenate to TRIzol. The RNA extraction protocol for biological fluids using TRIzol Reagent
was followed until the phase separation step. The remaining RNA extraction was done using the
PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion). The quantity and quality (260/280 ratios) of RNA extracted
was measured using NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein cDNA was
generated from RNA from Bei Resources (NR-52285) by One-Step RT PCR (SuperScript IV,

Histopathology
Following euthanasia, necropsy was performed, gross lesions were noted, and left lungs were
placed in 10% formalin for histopathological assessment. After a 24-h incubation at 4ºC, lungs
were transferred to fresh 10% formalin for an additional 48-hour incubation before removal from
containment. Tissues were processed by standard histological procedures by the UTMB
Anatomic Pathology Core, and 4 μm-thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. Sections of lungs were examined for the extent of inflammation, type of inflammatory foci,
and changes in alveoli/alveolar septa/airways/blood vessels in parallel with sections from
uninfected or unvaccinated lungs. The blinded tissue sections were semi-quantitatively scored
for pathological lesions using the criteria described in Supplemental Table 1. Examination was
performed with an Olympus CX43 microscope at magnification 40X for general observation and
100X magnification for detailed observation. Each section was scored by a trained member of
staff.
