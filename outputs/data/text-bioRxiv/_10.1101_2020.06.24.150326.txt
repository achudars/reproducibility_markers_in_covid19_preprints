ABSTRACT

2
3

Emergence of a highly contagious novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, has

4

precipitated the current global health crisis with over 479,000 deaths and more than 9.3 million

5

confirmed cases. Currently, our knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 disease

6

pathogenesis is very limited which has hampered attempts to develop targeted antiviral strategies.

7

Therefore, we urgently need an effective therapy for this unmet medical need. Viruses hijack and

8

dysregulate cellular machineries in order for them to replicate and infect more cells. Thus,

9

identifying and targeting dysregulated signaling pathways that have been taken over by viruses

10

is one strategy for developing an effective antiviral therapy. We have developed a high-throughput

11

drug screening system to identify potential antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. We utilized a

12

small molecule library of 430 protein kinase inhibitors, which are in various stages of clinical trials.

13

Most of the tested kinase antagonists are ATP competitive inhibitors, a class of nucleoside

14

analogs, which have been shown to have potent antiviral activity. From the primary screen, we

15

have identified 34 compounds capable of inhibiting viral cytopathic effect in epithelial cells.

16

Network of drug and protein relations showed that these compounds specifically targeted a limited

17

number of cellular kinases. More importantly, we have identified mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-

18

BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) pathways as key cellular signaling pathways

19

critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, a secondary screen confirmed compounds such

20

as Berzosertib (VE-822), Vistusertib (AZD2014), and Nilotinib with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity.

21

Finally, we found that Berzosertib, an ATR kinase inhibitor in the DDR pathway, demonstrated

22

potent antiviral activity in a human epithelial cell line and human induced pluripotent stem cell

23

(hIPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. These inhibitors are already in clinical trials of phase 2 or 3 for

24

cancer treatment, and can be repurposed as promising drug candidates for a host-directed

25

therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we have identified small molecule inhibitors

26

exhibiting anti SARS-CoV-2 activity by blocking key cellular kinases, which gives insight on

27

important mechanism of host-pathogen interaction. These compounds can be further evaluated

28

for the treatment of COVID-19 patients following additional in vivo safety and efficacy studies.

INTRODUCTION

2
3

The current pandemic is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory

4

syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of today, the disease has spread to 213

5

countries or territories, and the number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 9.3 million globally,

6

with over 479,000 deaths1,2. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single positive-sense RNA virus, which

7

codes a large non-structural polyprotein ORF1ab, four structural proteins and five accessory

8

proteins3. The virus enters into host cell by binding its transmembrane spike glycoprotein (S

9

protein) to the cellular membrane angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor4. ACE2 is

10

expressed in various organs, including lung, heart, kidney, and small intestine4. A recent study

11

showed a gradient of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract with the highest levels in the nose

12

and decreasing expression in the lower respiratory tract5. In the proximal airway, SARS-CoV-2

13

infected ciliated cells, while type 2 alveolar cells (AT2) were found to be infected in the distal

14

airway5. The major causes of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 are acute lung injury with

15

diffuse alveolar damage resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)6. This results

16

from viral replication in lung epithelial cells causing cell injury, a vigorous immune response,

17

respiratory failure, and death. Moreover, there have been additional reports of patients exhibiting

18

acute kidney injury7-9, vascular inflammation (endotheliitis), and cardiac complications10.

19

Underlying cardiac ailments, diabetes, and obesity are linked to with increased risk of

20

mortality11,12. Developing a therapeutic that prevents viral replication is likely to significantly

21

reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease in affected individuals.

22
23

Our strategy for developing COVID-19 treatment is based on two main facts about the disease:

24

1) all patients presenting with symptoms have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the virus has

25

gained entry into the airway cells and spread systematically. Given the high affinity and potential

26

avidity in the viral Spike-cellular ACE2 receptor interaction, targeting the viral receptor to prevent

27

cell entry may not a viable strategy to treat patients with this infection, and 2) viruses are

28

dependent on cellular proteins for each step of their life cycle and they hijack many of the host

29

cell factors for their replication. Moreover, these host proteins are not subjected to evolutionary

30

pressure at the short duration of acute infection, therefore there is limited chance of emergence

31

of drug resistant viral mutants. On the other hand, RNA viruses mutate during each round of

32

genome replication due to error prone nature of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp)

33

and develop resistance to direct acting antivirals agents (DAA’s). For Influenza A, resistance to

34

adamantanes quickly increased from 1.9% in the 2004 influenza season to 92.3% in 2005-2006

season13,14. Viruses take over a large number of host kinases at distinct steps of their life cycle15-

2

18

combined with the development and approval of a large number of kinase inhibitors for the

4

treatment of cancer19 and inflammatory conditions20 have sparked efforts aimed to determine the

5

therapeutic potential of such drugs to combat viral infections.

, thus the kinases represent attractive targets for broad-spectrum therapy. These findings,

6
7

Currently approved antiviral drugs treat fewer than ten viral infections. The majority of these drugs

8

are direct-acting antivirals that target proteins encoded by individual viruses. As such, this

9

approach provides a narrow spectrum of coverage and therefore cannot address the large clinical

10

need. The high average cost (over two billion dollars) and long timeline (8–12 years) to develop

11

a new drug21, further limit the scalability of the DAA approach to drug development, particularly

12

with respect to emerging viruses. This approach is therefore not feasible for the short-term

13

development of a cure that is specific for SARS-CoV-2. The screening of approved drugs to

14

identify therapeutics for drug repurposing is therefore a valid and more universal approach, and

15

several approved drugs have been identified as having activity against many viral diseases22-26.

16

Previous drug screening of FDA approved compounds for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-

17

CoV-2 demonstrated the efficiency of screening approved or clinically developed drugs for

18

identification of potential therapeutic options for emerging viral diseases, which also provided an

19

expedited approach for supporting off-label use of approved therapeutics 26,27.

20
21

The objectives of this study are: 1) to identify small molecule kinase inhibitors with anti SARS-

22

CoV-2 activity, and 2) to understand the mechanism of host-pathogen interactions by defining the

23

cellular signaling pathways critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication.

RESULTS

26
27

Infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture system. To identify antiviral compounds that could be used

28

for COVID-19 treatment, we established a SARS-CoV-2 infectious cell culture system and

29

virological assays using Vero-E6 cells. SARS-CoV-2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, was obtained from

30

BEI Resources of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and all studies

31

involving live virus was conducted in UCLA BSL3 high-containment facility. SARS-CoV-2 was

32

passaged once in Vero-E6 cells and viral stocks were aliquoted and stored at -80°C. Virus titer

33

was measured in Vero-E6 cells by TCID50 assay. Striking cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed

34

in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Figure 1A), indicating viral replication and associated cell injury. At

48 hours post infection (hpi), viral infection was examined by immunofluorescent (IFA) analysis

2

using SARS-CoV Spike (S) antibody. Spike protein was detected in the cytoplasm of the infected

3

cells, revealing presence of viral infection (Figure 1B). We also demonstrated that the drugs,

4

hydroxychloroquine (HQ; 10 µM), a known endosomal acidification inhibitor, as well as interferon-

5

β effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection28 (Figure 1C). Therefore, we used this platform has

6

been used for the subsequent drug screening studies.

7
8

High throughput drug screen of Kinase inhibitors. Next, we set out to evaluate the antiviral

9

property of cellular protein kinase inhibitors. A step by step workflow of our drug screen is provided

10

in Figure 2A. The drug compound library was selected to broadly cover kinase inhibitors and the

11

screening concentration was identified that would have optimal activity and minimal toxicity. We

12

tested a set of 430 kinase inhibitors that have typically been tested for oncologic and immunologic

13

indications and which also have Phase 1/2/3 data available (Supplementary Table 1). However,

14

data for these compounds are not available on SARS-CoV-2. Since this kinase inhibitor library is

15

targeting cancer indications, we decided to avoid using human lung cancer epithelial cell lines.

16

Compounds were formulated into DMSO and pre-plated into media at a 2x concentration (final

17

drug concentration 250 nM). Compounds were added to the Vero-E6 cells in the BSL-3 laboratory

18

followed by the SARS-CoV-2 at a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) 0.1. After the 48-hour incubation

19

at 37°C, 5% CO2, viral CPE was scored and imaged (Figure 3). The compounds that prevented

20

the viral CPE were identified (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1) and subjected to pathway

21

analysis. The drug-cellular protein interaction network was created by mining the collection of 34

22

hit compounds against the STITCH database in an unbiased fashion, using the standard and

23

unmodified settings29. The hit compounds targeted just a few selected kinases, such as mTOR,

24

AKT, PI3K, SRC, ABL, and ATR and a very limited set of pathways, mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-

25

BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage Response (DDR) (Figure 2B), suggesting the specific nature of

26

the identified antiviral agents.

27
28

Secondary screen. From the primary screen, 34 compounds were selected for secondary

29

screening with multiple drug doses (2.5, 25, 250 and 500 nM) in triplicates using 96-well plates.

30

We used an immunofluorescent assay to quantify viral infected cells from each well. This

31

comprehensive screen verified many hits of the primary screen (Figure 3A). Berzosertib (VE-822)

32

and Vistusertib (AZD2014) demonstrated antiviral activities at IC50 of below 25 nM. Nilotinib,

33

NVP-BHG712, VPS34-INI and YM201636 showed IC50 ranges between 50 nM – 125 nM (Figure

34

3B). These compounds act against SARS-CoV-2 by limiting viral infection through inhibiting

critical cellular enzymes needed for viral replication. These kinase inhibitors are nucleoside

2

analogues. Nucleoside analogues such as Remdesivir, EIDD-2801, and Ribavirin, have shown to

3

inhibit viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme and inducing compromising errors

4

during viral genome replication.

Drug validation in human cells. The screens were conducted using Vero-E6, a monkey kidney

7

epithelial cell line. Subsequently, we performed additional validation in human cells. We mainly

8

focused on a new class of antiviral compound Berzosertib, which is already in Phase 2 clinical

9

trial for cancer ailments. Initially, we have utilized an ACE2 entry receptor over expressing human

10

embryonic kidney 293T cell line (293T-ACE2). The SARS-CoV-2 infected 293T-ACE2 cells were

11

treated with Berzosertib (100 nM) and immunostaining analysis showed complete inhibition of

12

virus replication at 48 hpi (Supplementary Figure 2). We also included hydroxychloroquine (10

13

µM) as a positive control. These observations provides additional confirmation of Berzosertib as

14

a potential candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

15
16

COVID-19 patients have presented with cardiovascular complications. Recently, human induced

17

pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) have been shown to be great at

18

recapitulating cardiovascular diseases at a cellular level30,31, and have demonstrated susceptibility

19

to SARS-CoV-2 infection32. Thus this cardiomyocyte system would be useful for antiviral drug

20

testing against SARS-CoV-2. To further evaluate the potency of Berzosertib, hiPSC-CMs were

21

treated with this compound (250 nM) and the inhibition of virus production was evaluated by

22

quantifying infectious virus in the supernatant at various timepoints (Figure 4A). We observed

23

Berzosertib treatment had significantly reduced the virus production as well as apoptotic cell death

24

associated with viral infection (Figure 4B-C). The infected cardiomyocytes were confirmed by

25

specific staining of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and viral Spike proteins (Figure 4D). Subsequently,

26

untreated cells had infection-mediated cell injury with disrupted troponin T fibers. We specifically

27

focused on toxicity associated with Berzosertib. We found treatment of cardiomyocytes infected

28

SARS-CoV-2 with Berzosertib stabilized cardiomyocyte function with similar beats per minute to

29

uninfected cardiomyocytes (Figure 4E, and Supplementary Videos). SARS-CoV-2 infected cells

30

had significantly reduced cardiomyocyte beating with non-synchronous twitching of few cluster of

31

cells (Refer to Supplementary Videos). Taken together, our results shows that Berzosertib is a

32

potent, safe, and effective new class of antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2.

Berzosertib’s Mode of Action. Berzosertib (Figure 5A) is a selective inhibitor of

2

Serine/threonine-protein kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein) which can

3

inhibit the DNA Damage Response pathway. Previous studies have shown that Berzosertib

4

blocks the phosphorylation of downstream signaling factor CHK1 (phospho-CHK1-S345) and

5

potentiates phosphorylation of H2AX (phospho-H2AX-S139 or γH2AX) marker by DNA damaging

6

agents33,34. It has been known that many viruses hijack this pathway for efficient replication35,36.

7

One of the mode of actions could be inhibition of the aberrant activation of DNA repair signaling

8

pathway by the virus, which can result in virus replication blockage. Indeed, we observed that

9

SARS-CoV-2 infection has activated DDR pathway in Vero-E6 cells (Figure 5B). Currently,

10

additional mechanistic and pre-clinical in vivo studies are being conducted for submission of an

11

Investigational New Drug (IND) application towards clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.

12
13

DISCUSSION

14
15

We performed an antiviral drug screen using kinase inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 infection.

16

We have identified 34 drugs out of 430 compounds with anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity. These

17

selected compounds mainly targeted mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-Damage

18

Response (DDR) Pathways (Figure 2B and 5C). Our secondary screen confirmed the antiviral

19

activities of the following kinase inhibitors: AZD2014, Torin2, Nilotinib, NVP-BHG712, VPS34-INI,

20

YM201636 and Berzosertib. Critical cellular pathways are subjected to activation, suppression,

21

or some form of modulation by viral infection.

22
23

Interestingly, we have observed that several antiviral compounds targeted mTOR-PI3K-AKT

24

pathway, including AZD2014 and Torin2 (Figure 2B). The mammalian target of rapamycin

25

(mTOR) regulates cell growth, autophagy, and various metabolic processes37,38 and have been

26

shown to be targeted by various viruses. Upon influenza virus infection, mTORC2 and PDPK1 (3-

27

phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) differentially phosphorylate AKT. Viruses such as

28

Kaposi’s Sarcoma Herpesvirus, Hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Adenovirus are well

29

known to activate PI3K 37,39-42. Torin compound has shown to inhibit virus replication by blocking

30

mTOR kinase43. Our findings suggest that AZD2014 and Torin2 targeting PI3K/AKT1/MTOR

31

pathway could be developed as potential therapeutics against COVID-19.

32
33

We identified a lead drug Berzosertib, which acts as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 by

34

limiting viral genomic RNA replication. Berzosertib is a selective inhibitor of ATR kinase, which

1

has been previously shown to block the DNA damage response pathway in cancer cells, with no

2

discernable effect on normal cells

3

maintaining cellular genome integrity which is also modulated by DNA tumor viruses45. An

4

alphaherpesvirus, Marek’s disease virus (MDV), and BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) have been shown

5

to induce the DDR during infection46,47. It is apparent that many RNA viruses can induce significant

6

DNA damage, even in cases where viral replication takes place exclusively in the cytoplasm. DNA

7

damage can contribute to the pathogenesis of RNA viruses through triggering of apoptosis,

8

stimulation of inflammatory immune responses and the introduction of deleterious mutations that

9

can increase the risk of tumorigenesis. In addition, activation of DDR pathways can contribute

10

positively to replication of viral RNA genomes. Elucidation of the interactions between RNA

11

viruses and the DNA damage response (DDR) would provide important insights into modulation

12

of host cell functions by these pathogens.

44

. The DNA damage response pathway is responsible for

13
14

For all of these reasons the DDR ATR signaling pathway appears to be a valid target for host-

15

directed therapeutic development for COVID-19 and warrants further investigation. As of June

16

2020, there have been eight clinical studies (at Phase 1 and 2) based on Berzosertib and the side

17

effect profile is mild and the drug is well tolerated. Further evaluation of the targets using CRISPR

18

based KO studies is in progress. Thus, we consider this compound can be rapidly repurposed to

19

treat COVID-19 patients. Overall, this present study illustrates key signaling proteins involved in

20

SARS-CoV-2 replication and provides potential avenues for novel antiviral drug development.

Biosafety and IRB Approval. Appropriate institutional review boards (IRB) approvals were

9

obtained at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. All hiPSC lines used in this study have been

10

approved by the UCLA and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center human pluripotent stem cell research

11

oversight committees.

13

SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Vero cells were seeded at 5 x 103 cells per well in 0.2 ml volumes using

14

a 96-well plate and hiPSC-CMs were replated at 1 x 105 cells per well. The following day, viral

15

inoculum (MOI of 0.01 and 0.1; 100 µl/well) was prepared using serum free media. The spent

16

media from each well was removed and 100 µl of prepared inoculum was added onto Vero cells.

17

For mock infection, serum free media (100 µl/well) alone was added. The inoculated plates were

18

incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The inoculum was spread by gently tilting the plate

19

sideways at every 15 minutes. At the end of incubation, the inoculum was replaced with serum

20

supplemented media (200 µl per well) and for hiPSC-CM, cell culture medium was replaced with

21

RPMI 1640 + B27 supplement with insulin. At selected timepoints live cell images were obtained

22

by bright field microscope. At 48 hours post infection (hpi), viral infection was examined by

23

immunocytochemistry (ICC) analysis using SARS-CoV Spike (S) antibodies [BEI Resources: NR-

24

27

Antiviral Drug Study. Vero-E6 cells were seeded on 96-well plates and were pretreated with

28

drugs for 1 hour, then SARS-CoV-2 inoculum (MOI 0.1) was added. DMSO vehicle treated cells,

29

with or without viral infections, were included as controls. 48 hpi, the cells were fixed and

30

immunostained with anti-dsRNA antibody (J2 clone; Absolute Antibody Inc, USA) to assess viral
