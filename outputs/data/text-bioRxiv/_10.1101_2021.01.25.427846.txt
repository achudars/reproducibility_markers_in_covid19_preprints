SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding mutations and antibody mediated immunity
Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 mutations can impact infectivity, viral load, and overall morbidity/mortality during
infection. In this analysis, we look at the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor
binding domain, a structure that is antigenic and allows for viral binding to the host. We analyze
104193 GISAID sequences acquired on October 15th, 2020 with a majority of sequences (96%)
containing point mutations. We report high frequency mutations with improved binding affinity to
ACE2 including S477N, N439K, V367F, and N501Y and address the potential impact of RBD
mutations on antibody binding. The high frequency S477N mutation is present in 6.7% of all
SARS-CoV-2 sequences, co-occurs with D614G, and is currently present in 14 countries. To
address RBD-antibody interactions we take a subset of human derived antibodies and define
their interacting residues using PDBsum. Our analysis shows that adaptive immunity against
SARS-CoV-2 enlists broad coverage of the RBD suggesting that antibody mediated immunity
should be sufficient to resolve infection in the presence of RBD point mutations that conserve
structure.
Introduction:
Coronaviruses encompass a large family of viruses that can infect both humans and animals.
To date, there are seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, causing relatively mild
to severe respiratory infections. Human coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 typically
replicate within the upper respiratory tract, resulting in infections that resemble the common
cold1. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recent SARS-CoV-2 can replicate within the
lower respiratory tract, causing a pneumonia that can be fatal1.
SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic that has spread to 218
countries, infecting more than 97 million people, and causing more than 2 million deaths. This
virus is most commonly characterized by fever and cough but is also associated with pulmonary
embolisms, kidney injury, and gastrointestinal symptoms2-5. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has a
high transmission efficiency and can lead to mortality, especially when infecting the elderly or
individuals with underlying medical conditions6,7.
Upon entry into the respiratory tract, coronaviruses use a homotrimeric spike glycoprotein (S
protein) on the surface of the virion to mediate an interaction with the host receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the protease TMPRSS28,9. These interactions facilitate viral
envelope fusion to the cell membrane via the endosomal pathway10,11. The release of (+) sense
RNA into the host cytoplasm allows for viral RNA translation and replication. Viral proteins and
genomic RNA are subsequently assembled into virions and released from cells via vesicle
transport. This infectious cycle causes host cells to undergo inflammatory pyroptotic cell death
resulting in an aggressive inflammatory response and damage to the airways1.
The S glycoprotein is essential for the initial interaction and internalization of the SARS-CoV-2
virus by the host making it an important structure on the virion12-15. The S protein is comprised of
the S1 and S2 domains with S1 containing the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly
interacts with the peptidase domain (PD) of the ACE2 protein (Figure 1a, b). The S2 domain
contains a fusion peptide (FP), two heptad repeats, a transmembrane region, and an
intracellular region (Figure 1a). RBD mediated receptor binding causes dissociation of the S1
domain and allows for the S2 domain to reach a post-fusion state enabling viral membrane
fusion10,11.

Structural studies have resolved in detail the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and
human ACE2, pinpointing essential contact residues (Table 1)16-20. Mutations in either the RBD
or ACE2 can have an effect on the affinity of this interaction and may therefore impact
infectivity, viral load, and overall morbidity/mortality during infection21,22. In this work we sought
to provide insight RBD mutations using the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) database23,24. Multiple works have characterized the mutational landscape of the full
SARS-CoV-2 genome or the S coding sequence using the GISAID database downloaded at
various timepoints21,25-28. SARS-CoV-2 regions with high mutation frequency have been shown
to include ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3a, and N coding sequences26. Mutational analyses led to
the discovery of a D614G mutation found on the S protein that was later shown to be
responsible for higher infectivity in a pseudo typed viral infection assay, showed higher Ct
values in patients, and was shown to enhance viral load in the upper respiratory tract of
patients27-33.
Noting the significance of these findings, it is essential that we continue to assess SARS-CoV-2
mutations as the GISAID database expands. Here we report an analysis of 104,596 GISAID
RBD sequences acquired on October 15th, 2020. We use a combination of bioinformatics and
published affinity data to determine the mutational landscape and affinities of SARS-CoV-2 RBD
mutants to wild-type ACE2 proteins21. Finally, it has been reported that the antibody
neutralization sensitivity of some RBD mutants including A475V, F490L, and V483A (among
others) is reduced, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has mutated to evade host immunity 27,34. Here
we analyze RBD amino acid mutations found at antibody interacting contact sites and assess
the breadth of antibody mediated immunity across the RBD structure35. Specifically, our work
focuses on mutations found at interacting residues between the RBD and the structurally
characterized human antibodies BD23, COVA2-39, CV07-250, B38, CV30, CB6, P2B2F6,
CV07-270, BD-368-2 and S30935-46.
Results:
SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide mutations:
A total of 9,275 RBD mutants were found across 104,193 sequences (8.7%) when aligned
against the Wuhan reference strain (NC_045512.2). Of the 9,275 RBD mutants there were
8,871-point mutations, 179 double mutants, and 14 mutants with three to six mutations each for
a total of 9064 mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains. These data are consistent with previous work
showing a relatively high number of mutations at the S protein for SARS-CoV-226. Analysis of
mutational frequency showed that approximately 75.2% of all nucleotide mutations were
G1430A, 6.8% were C1317A, 0.9% were at G1144T, and 42 additional mutants ranged
between 0.1 and 0.9% frequency (Figure 2a, Supplementary Table 1). Whole genome
mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 previously showed a high number of C -> U transitions and
suggested that host-driven antiviral editing mechanisms may be driving this preference 47,48. In
the context of RBD analysis alone, the most common mutation was a G->A transition (7.4% of
mutants), followed by a C->A transversion 0.67% of the time, a G ->T transversion 0.51% of the
time, and a C->U transition 0.42% of the time (Figure 2b, Supplementary Table 1). Although
seemingly contrasting, these data are complementary in suggesting a high C->U transition
frequency when excluding the high number of G1430A mutations in this dataset, as it
represents a potentially selected mutation. Collectively, our analysis of RBD sequences show a
large number of mutations occurring at the RBD with one mutant predominating the SARS-CoV2 population.
SARS-CoV-2 amino acid mutations:
To determine the effects of these nucleotide mutations we looked at the amino acid output. Of
the 9,275 nucleotide mutations approximately 1.7% of them were synonymous, whereas the

remaining 98.3% modified the amino acid sequence of the RBD. The G1430A mutation led to
the S477N mutant which represented 76.5% of all 9121 amino acid mutations. C1317A at 5%
and G1558T at 0.9% lead to N439K and A520S mutations, respectively (Figure 3,
Supplementary Table 1). Noting the high frequency of these residue modifications we wanted to
assess their relevance in the context of ACE2 binding affinity. Published data on deep
mutational scanning of the RBD had already reported RBD-ACE2 affinity data for all possible
RBD mutants. Importantly, at the time, mutations at residues S477N and N439K represented
0.09% and 0.4% of the total GISAID sequences (31,570 total sequences)21. Moreover, these
data showed that the S477N and the N439K mutant RBDs had a higher affinity for the ACE2
receptor than their WT counterparts, with only S477N showing improved expression in yeast
cells. Here we report that these mutations now represent 6.7% (S477N) and 0.6% (N439K) of
the total GISAID population (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 1). Although no significant
frequency change has been observed for the N439K mutant there has been a more than 70-fold
increase in the presence of the S477N mutation suggesting that selection may be playing a role
in the propagation of this RBD mutant. Collectively, 13 mutations found in our GISAID analysis
coded for an RBD that improved binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor, these included S477N,
N439K, V367F, and N510Y amongst others (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 4). The potential
negative impact of improved ACE2 binding during SARS-CoV-2 infection led us to analyze
whether the high frequency S477N mutant co-occurred with the D614G spike mutation (a high
frequency mutation producing more infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles). As expected, all S
proteins carrying the S477N mutation also carried the D614G mutation providing evidence for
this co-occurrence (Supplementary Table 2). We elaborate on this in the next section.
Global distribution of RBD mutations:
We wanted to analyze the global distribution of individual RBD mutants as a function of country
(Figure 4a, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1 & 2). Approximately 69% of all
SARS-CoV-2 sequences in Australia contained the S477N mutation in the RBD (Figure 4b).
England, Scotland and Switzerland showed an incidence of 4.7, 0.9, and 0.8% for this mutation,
respectively. The highest incidence of N439K mutants was found in England (4.1%) followed by
Scotland, Ireland and Wales (Figure 4c). There was no incidence of a sequenced N439K/S477N
double mutant. Overall, the S477N mutation was present in 14 countries with N439K present in
10 (Supplementary Table 2). To look at the association of D614G with S477N or N439K we
reanalyzed the dataset by increasing the length of our RBD nucleotide sequence to include the
D614G codon (see materials and methods for details). In both cases, all SARS-CoV-2
sequences containing either the S477N mutation or N439K mutation also contained the D614G
mutation. As expected, no triple mutant was found. The S477N/D614G double mutant was
found in 14 countries with a high prevalence in Australia (Supplementary Table 2). The
N439K/D614G double mutant was found in 10 countries with a high prevalence in England
(Supplementary Table 3).
Mutations in antibody interacting residues found on the RBD:
Structural data of human antibodies interacting with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was coupled with
our mutational analysis. RBD mutations were found at 75% of all antibody interaction sites
(Supplementary Table 5). High frequency RBD mutations included sites S477 (6.7%), V483
(0.069%), A344 (0.065%), T478 (0.065%) and N501 (0.050%) (Figure 5). S477 interacts with
antibodies CV07-250, CV30, CB6, and BD-368-2, V483 interacts with COVA2-39 and P2B-2F6,
A344 interacts with S309, T478 interacts with CV07-250, and N501 interacts with CV07-250,
B38, and BD-368-2 (Figure 5). A number of high frequency mutants such as N439 and A520 did
not show any direct interactions to antibodies in our analysis but may impact binding of other
antibodies27,34 (Supplementary Table 5). Furthermore, no single point mutation on the RBD was
found to have a direct interaction with every antibody in our analysis.

Discussion:
Analyzing the GISAID database for SARS-CoV-2 mutations is essential as the pandemic
continues. In this analysis, we provide a snapshot of all publicly available GISAID SARS-CoV-2
RBD sequences with a focus on emerging mutations that may have a negative health impact to
the host. Coupling our data with previous mutational scanning work has led to multiple RBD
mutants with improved affinities for their ACE2 binding target21 (Supplementary Table 4). Some
of the highest frequency mutations with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor included S477N,
N439K, V367F, and N501Y. The S477N mutation represented the highest frequency of all with
N501Y displaying the highest binding affinity21 (Supplementary Table 4). For future analysis, it
may be important to look at the potential frequency changes that occur at any RBD mutations
which improve ACE2 binding affinity Table 2. The GISAID database contained no mutations at
residues N487, T500, Y489, G502, and G496. This was expected as mutations at any of these
key sites reduces RBD affinity for the ACE2 receptor21. These data strongly suggest that
selection is playing a role in improving SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, with some key exceptions.
There were no SARS-CoV-2 mutations found at the Q498 residue of the RBD. This is
perplexing as the Q498H, Q498Y, and Q498F all improve RBD expression and ACE2 binding,
moreover, the Q498H mutation boasts the highest affinity for ACE2 of any RBD mutant21.
Furthermore, there were a number of mutations that could significantly improve RBD-ACE2
binding but were either completely absent in our data or of extremely low frequency, including
N501F, Y453F, T385R, Q493M, and Q414A amongst others21 (Supplementary Table 1). These
contradictions may be explained by the transmission-mortality trade-off theory49. This theory
suggests that fitness is not defined by a high mortality rate due to symptoms, but rather a high
transmission rate or R0. It is possible that mutations at Q498 would negatively impact viral
fitness by increasing mortality and reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. If correct, this theory
suggests that the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 should decrease over time while transmission
rate should improve to a yet unknown maximum. This may be the case with the recently
increased frequency of a new spike deletion variant ΔH69/ΔV70 (unpublished work).
Finally, we expected that in some cases RBD mutations may impact the affinity of antibodies to
the RBD27,34. To that extent we combined analysis with previously published work on RBDantibody binding to address the potential for immune deficiencies35. Specifically, we analyzed
ten human derived antibodies and assessed the frequency of RBD mutations at antibody
contact sites. In our analysis, the pool of human derived antibodies showed that adaptive
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 enlists broad coverage of the RBD. Moreover, no single RBD
point mutation was found to have a direct interaction with every antibody in our analysis. This
suggests that immunization with wild type and potentially any RBD point mutant that conserves
structure will likely elicit the development of RBD antibodies sufficient for binding and resolving
infection27,34. It should be noted that antibody neutralization may vary based on certain
mutations as shown with the E484K mutation which in our dataset was found in 11 SARS-CoV2 sequences50. The extent to which some of these mutations modify transmission efficiency and
infectivity remains to be seen, but in the context of natural infection or vaccine immunization,
both wild type and point mutant RBD antigens represent excellent targets for adaptive immune
mediated prophylaxis.
Materials and Methods:
Database development:
A MATLAB program was developed (https://github.com/LMSE/COVID_19_Mutations) to
analyze viral sequences reported on the (GISAID) database23,24. The GISAID database contains
thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences isolated from patients around the world. All complete and
high coverage sequences were downloaded from September 1st, 2019 to October 15th, 2020,

totalling 110,761 sequences. The data was curated by removing duplicates, sequences with
gaps, sequences found in animals, and sequences with a similarity score lower than 97%,
yielding a 106,941-sequence dataset. The developed code generates all three reading frames
for input nucleotide sequences and enables analysis of amino acid and nucleotide mutations to
a reference strain. Furthermore, the code analyzes each sequence's metadata to extract and
store the collection date and the isolation location of samples reported in the database. We
hope that the bioinformatic workflow and code presented here will be a valuable community tool
for analyzing the spread of mutations in SARS-CoV2 sequence.
Analyses overview:
This program was used to assess the similarity of patient sequences to the reference genome of
SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2). Two analyses were conducted in this work. First, RBD fragment
nucleotide sequences from patient samples were locally aligned to the reference genome RBD
fragment, nucleotides 22544 to 23146. For the extended RBD analysis, nucleotides 22544 to
23407 were used. The RBD fragment was subsequently translated to its amino acid sequence
comprising 201 amino acid residues. These RBD sequences were locally aligned to the
reference SARS-CoV-2 RBD amino acid sequence. The second dataset expanded the
alignment and analyzed residues 22544 to 23407 in order to include the D614 amino acid
residue. The methodology for the second dataset was the same as the first. For affinity analysis,
all RBD mutants with a frequency higher than 0.0067% or mutations at the RBD-ACE2 binding
interface were analyzed (Supplementary Table 4).
Sequence alignment:
The program locally aligns the nucleotide sequence of patient samples and their three reading
frames to a reference sequence. The algorithm executes local alignment in parallel using the
MATLAB bioinformatics toolbox51. The alignment algorithm uses a pam250 scoring matrix to
obtain the similarity scores of patient samples52. Similarity scores are then normalized to
percentage to yield more meaningful datasets. For each sample, the reading frame with the
maximum similarity score to the standard amino acid sequence is selected as a baseline for
identifying mutations.
Antibody Interacting Residues:
The PDBsum server was used to obtain interacting residues on the protein-protein interface
between antibodies and the RBD of SARS-CoV-253. Specifically, antibodies B38 (PDB: 7BZ5),
CV30 (PDB: 6XE1), CB6 (PDB: 7C01), BD23 (PDB: 7BYR), COVA2-39 (PDB: 7JMP), CV07250 (PDB: 6XKQ), P2B-2F6 (PDB: 7BWJ), CV07-270 (PDB: 6XKP), BD-368-2 (PDB: 7CHE),
and S309 (PDB: 6WPS). Detailed interactions can be found in Supplementary Table 5.
