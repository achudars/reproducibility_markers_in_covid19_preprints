Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global crisis. There is no therapeutic
treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against
SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and, thus, repurpose them for
treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such
as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental
validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods.
Here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based
absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting
SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of
a new restraint energy distribution (RED) function designed to accelerate the FEP-ABFE
calculations and make the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library
possible for the first time. As a result, out of twenty-five drugs predicted, fifteen were confirmed
as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The most potent one is dipyridamole (Ki=0.04 µM)
which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for
treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki=0.36 µM) and
chloroquine (Ki=0.56 µM) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the first time.
We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in
many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.

Significance Statement
Drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from
a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is
generally rather low with traditional computational methods. It has been demonstrated that a new
virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free
energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions can reach an unprecedently high hit rate, leading to successful
identification of 16 potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) from computationally
selected 25 drugs under a threshold of Ki = 4 M. The outcomes of this study are valuable for not
only drug repurposing to treat COVID-19, but also demonstrating the promising potential of the
FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach.

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)(1, 2) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV), has become a
global crisis. To date, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. Thus, there is an
urgent need to repurpose drugs for treatment of COVID-19.(3) The SARS-CoV-2 replicase gene
(Orf1) encodes two overlapping translation products, polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab),
which mediate all of the functions required for the viral replication. The main protease (Mpro) as a
key enzyme for the viral replication is initially released by the autocleavage of pp1a and pp1ab.
Then, Mpro cleaves pp1a and pp1ab to release the functional proteins nsp4-nsp16 that are necessary
for the viral replication.(4) In view of the essential functions of Mpro in the viral life cycle and its
high level of conservation, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a naturally attractive target for treatment of
COVID-19. Hence, there have been efforts to identify therapeutic candidates targeting Mpro using
various virtual screening methods based on pharmacophore, molecule docking, and molecular
simulations.(5) As a result of the reported efforts, six drugs were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2

Mpro with IC50 ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM.5 There have been also drug repurposing efforts
associated with other potential targets of SARS-CoV-2.5-14
In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19,
usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs through computational modeling and
simulations, followed by experimental validation. However, the actual hit rate of a virtual
screening using traditional computational methods has been rather low, with vast majority of
computationally predicted drug candidates being false positives, because it is difficult to reliably
predict protein-ligand binding free energies. Most recently, Gorgulla et al.(6) reported an
interesting new virtual screening platform, called VirtualFlow, used to screen numerous
compounds in order to identify inhibitors of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), but
the hit rate was still not very high. Within 590 compounds predicted by the virtual screening, 69
were found to be KEAP1 binders (with a hit rate of ~11.7% for detectable binding affinity), and
10 of these compounds were confirmed to be displacers of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2related factor 2 (NRF2) with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 60 μM (with a hit
rate of ~1.4% under the threshold of IC50 < 60 μM).(6) Obviously, the hit rate of a virtual
screening is dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the receptor-ligand binding free energy
predictions used in the virtual screening process. So, the key to the success of a virtual screening
effort is use of a reliable computational approach to accurately predict binding free energies.
The free energy perturbation (FEP) simulation of intermolecular interactions (7, 8) is
recognized a reliable method for binding free energy calculations with satisfactory accuracy,(7-18)
but the traditional FEP method was limited to simulating some minor structural changes of ligands
for the relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations.(9, 19) The RBFE calculations can be
used to guide lead optimization starting from a promising lead compound (or hit),(9, 19-22) but

not suitable for virtual screening of completely different molecular structures to identify new hits
for drug repurposing. For the virtual screening to identify new hits or leads, it is necessary to
predict absolute binding free energy (ABFE) for each ligand binding with the target without the
requirement to use any reference ligand structure. The FEP-ABFE approach has the advantage of
predicting binding affinities between ligands and their targets more accurately than conventional
computational methods, such as pharmacophore, molecule docking, and molecular simulations.(23)
However, the previously used FEP-ABFE calculations are extremely expensive and timeconsuming and, thus, not suitable for virtual screening purposes (that required to screen a large
number of compounds).(24, 25)
To make the FEP-ABFE approach practically feasible for our virtual screening and drug
repurposing effort, here we report a new algorithm using a restraint energy distribution (RED)
function to accelerate the FEP-ABFE prediction and its first application to a drug repurposing
effort which targets SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Our FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening (which
predicted 25 drugs as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) was followed by in vitro activity
assays, confirming that 15 out of the 25 drugs can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 0.04 to
3.3 M (with a remarkably high hit rate of 60% under a threshold of Ki = 4 M); nine drugs have
Ki < 1 M (with a submicromolar hit rate of 36%). Particularly, among these drugs, the most potent
inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is dipyridamole (DIP, Ki = 0.04 M). Following the computational
prediction and in vitro activity validation, DIP was tested for its antiviral activity against SARSCoV-2 in vitro and in clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19, and the preliminary
clinical data are promising for its actual therapeutic effects. While the clinical data are reported
separately elsewhere(26) to timely guide further clinical studies and possibly practical clinical
application, we describe and discuss in this report the detailed computational and in vitro activity

results of DIP along with other promising drugs identified. The encouraging outcomes suggest that
the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening is a truly promising approach to drug
repurposing.

Results and Discussion
Identification of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for drug repurposing
Prior to the virtual screening for drug repurposing, the accuracy of the accelerated FEP-ABFE
prediction protocol was validated by using three different protein targets (BRD4, HIV-1 protease,
and human factor Xa) and 28 ligands with diverse chemical scaffolds. According to the validation
data, given in Supporting Information (SI) section S7, the accelerated FEP-ABFE algorithm can
achieve a high accuracy for the ABFE predictions. So, in order to identify potent SARS-CoV-2
Mpro inhibitors, we first carried out the FEP-ABFE based virtual screening of all existing drugs,
followed by in vitro activity assays, as shown in Figure 1.

Specifically, after all the existing drugs were docked into the binding site of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro, 100 molecules that had specific interactions with the six key amino acid residues, Cys145,
His41, Ser144, His163, Gly143, and Gln166, were subjected to further FEP-ABFE calculations.
Among these 100 drugs, 49, 46, and 5 were electrically neutral, negatively charged, and positively
charged, respectively. Since the FEP method is known to encounter systematic errors when the
ligands are not electrically neutral, the drugs selected on the basis of the FEP-ABFE results were
grouped by their formal charges to ensure that the error is cancelled within each group. In each
group, the top 20% to 40% of the molecules were selected based on their ABFE values. As a result,
25 drugs were selected for subsequent in vitro experimental activity testing. According to the in
vitro results, 15 out of these 25 drugs exhibited considerable potency of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
Mpro (Figures 2 and S8). DIP was found to be the most potent inhibitor, with Ki = 0.04 μM.
Following the computational prediction and in vitro activity confirmation, DIP was further tested
for its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that DIP dose-dependently
suppressed the SARS-CoV-2 replication with EC50 = 0.1 M. The antiviral activity was consistent
with the inhibitory activity against Mpro. In addition, DIP was also tested clinically in treatment of
patients with COVID-19, resulting in promising therapeutic data that are reported separately
elsewhere (along with the raw antiviral activity data)(26) due to the urgent need of further clinical
studies and possibly practical clinical application.
The FEP-ABFE results calculated for all the confirmed potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors
are given in Table 1 in comparison with the subsequently determined experimental activity data.

As seen in Table 1, 13 out of the 15 FEP-ABFE predicted binding free energies were within 2
kcal/mol of the corresponding experimental values, and for the other two (disulfiram and
maribavir), the deviations were all about 2.2 kcal/mol. Specially for disulfiram, according to its
molecular structure, it might be a covalent inhibitor of Mpro, which could be part of the reason of
the relatively larger computational error. However, further studies are needed for disulfiram to
draw a more reliable conclusion. Overall, for the 15 protein-ligand binding complexes, the mean
unsigned error (MUE) was about 1.2 kcal/mol. For comparison, we also carried out the MM-PBSA
and MM-GBSA calculations on the 15 binding complexes, and the MUE values for both of the
two methods were larger than 17.0 kcal/mol. Thus, the FEP-ABFE method is indeed much more
accurate than both the MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA methods for the drug repurposing prediction.

labeled use (treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure). Hence, we also computationally
and experimentally examined its metabolite, candesartan (the active drug corresponding to the prodrug
for the labeled use) which was not in the drug library screened. Interestingly, candesartan was also
predicted and confirmed as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with a slightly lower inhibitory
activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Ki = 0.62 M). So, it is interesting to note that for potential
treatment of patients with COVID-19, the prodrug candesartan cilexetil would serve as a more active
molecular species against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro compared to candesartan itself.
Altogether, a total of 16 potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were identified in this study, and
their molecular structures and in vitro inhibitory activity data are shown in Figures 2 and S8. Among
these 16 compounds, nine (with names shown in black in Figure 2) were identified as potential
candidate treatments of patients with COVID-19 for the first time in this study. The remaining seven
drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, disulfiram, montelukast sodium, atazanavir,
indinavir, and maribavir, were also proposed as potential candidate treatments for patients with
COVID-19 in previous studies.(27, 29-32) However, within these seven drugs, only disulfiram and
atazanavir were previously identified as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, whereas the other five drugs
were either reported to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 without knowing the specific targets or
predicted by computational modeling only without knowing their actual experimental activity. All
these drugs were confirmed to be potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors in this study. Overall, a total of
14 compounds were confirmed as potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for the first time in this study.
Within the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors identified, DIP is the most potent one with Ki = 0.04 M
(or 40 nM). The computationally modeled structure of DIP binding with SARS-CoV-2 is depicted in
Figure S9 (showing the roles of key residues of the protease, including Thr25, Asn142, Gly143, Ser144,
His163, and Glu166, for binding with DIP).

is 5.72 M in the literature and 4.7 M in this work when the concentration of the same substrate used
was as high as 20 µM).

Molecular mechanism for the antiviral activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against
SARS-CoV-2
Notably, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently under clinical trials for treatment of
patients with COVID-19. Particularly, chloroquine was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 of
0.1  1.13 M,(26)(27) although the exact molecular mechanism and drug target(s) have not been
confirmed. Concerning the molecular mechanism for their known antiviral activity, chloroquine or
hydroxychloroquine was previously proposed to inhibit acidification of endosome and viral
endocytosis.(33, 34) However, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which was a model virus belonging
to Rhabdoviridae and had a similar endocytosis process as coronavirus, was not as sensitive as SARSCoV-2 to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (Figure S10); no significant inhibition was observed
for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine at a concentration 6.25 M. Comparing to VSV, coronavirus
is much more sensitive to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine inhibited SARSCoV-2 at EC50 of 0.72 M and chloroquine reduced SARS-CoV replication to 53% at 1.0 μM.(35) We
were always wondering if chloroquine and its analogue hydroxychloroquine would directly target a
viral protein of coronavirus. Here, we demonstrated in this report for the first time that chloroquine
and its analogues inhibited the main protease (Mpro) activity, which is an essential and conserved
enzyme in Coronaviridae. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV2 Mpro with Ki = 0.56 and 0.36 M, respectively (see Figure 3). Here, we cautiously concluded that
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibition of Mpro in
addiction to the well-known mechanism of abrogation of viral endocytosis. Moreover, norovirus,

was hypersensitive to chloroquine treatment.(36) It furtherly supported that chloroquine and its
analogues would inhibit viral 3C-like protease and inhibit viral replication. The Ki value of 0.36 M
for hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is slightly lower than the reported EC50 of 0.72 M
against SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the possible molecular mechanism that the antiviral
activity of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 is mainly due to the inhibitory activity against
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Overall, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is expected to have both some
beneficial effect associated with its antiviral activity due to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition and
adverse side effects associated with other complicated mechanisms of the drug.
Further, in light of our finding that these drugs are potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, it would
be interesting to design hydroxychloroquine analogs that can more potently and selectively inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro without the unwanted adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine. Similar drug
development strategies may also apply to development of analogs of other confirmed SARS-CoV-2
Mpro inhibitors such as DIP and candesartan cilexetil with further improved potency and selectivity for
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Conclusion
By using the accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE)
predictions for drug repurposing targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, followed by experimental validation,
we successfully identified a total of 16 potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro from existing drugs,
including 14 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors that were confirmed (with Ki = 0.04 to 3.3 µM) for the first
time in this study. The identified most potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor is dipyridamole (with Ki =
0.04 µM) which is currently under clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19, with the
promising therapeutic effects reported in a separate report. Among other newly identified SARS-CoV2 Mpro inhibitors, prodrug candesartan cilexetil and the corresponding drug candesartan both can
potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Interestingly, prodrug candesartan cilexetil (with Ki = 0.18 µM) is
even more potent than candesartan itself (with Ki = 0. 62 µM) for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki = 0.36 µM) and chloroquine (Ki = 0.56 µM) were found to
potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the first time in this study, suggesting that the previously known
antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine might be mainly due to the inhibitory activity
against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, in addition to other well-known mechanisms. Further, based on the finding
that these drugs are potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, it would be interesting to design
hydroxychloroquine analogs that can more potently and selectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to
improve its antiviral activity and avoid the unwanted adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine associated
with other mechanisms. Similarly, the identified other drugs, such as dipyridamole and candesartan
cilexetil etc., can also be used as promising starting drug structures to design new drug candidates with
further improved potency and selectivity for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
In summary, the virtual screening through accelerated FEP-ABFE predictions has demonstrated
an excellent accuracy, with a remarkably high hit rate of 60% under a threshold of Ki = 4 M. We

Methods
Virtual screening based on accelerated FEP-ABFE approach
The accelerated FEP-ABFE approach was based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution
(RED) function. The RED function was derived to accelerate the FEP-ABFE calculations, and the
accelerated FEP-ABFE approach are extensively tested and evaluated; see details given in Supporting
Information (SI) sections S1 to S7. Briefly, the RED function accelerated FEP-ABFE approach was
extensively tested and showed remarkable accuracy. Compared to the previously reported FEP-ABFE
approaches which normally use 42 λ values(24, 25), the RED function accelerated FEP-ABFE can be
calculated by using just 16 λ values. With such acceleration, the application of FEP-ABFE calculation
in virtual screening was made possible. The accuracy of the accelerated 16-λ-FEP-ABFE calculation
was then tested against 28 ligands with diverse chemical scaffolds, as given in SI section S7. The test
results suggested that the accelerated FEP-ABFE algorithm can achieve a remarkable accuracy, which
encouraged us to perform the FEP-ABFE prediction-based practical virtual screening to identify
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for drug repurposing.
During the virtual screening, molecular docking was first performed by using the crystal structure
(PDB ID: 6LU7)(31) of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro which causes COVID-19. More than 2500 small molecules
in the existing drug library (including all FDA-approved drugs) were screened by docking method,
and 100 ligands were selected by molecular docking and further evaluated by RED function
accelerated FEP-ABFE calculations. Compounds with the highest binding free energies were selected
for further in vitro activity assays. The detailed method for FEP-ABFE based virtual screening is given
in SI section S1. The derivation of the RED function and extensive evaluations of the accelerated FEPABFE method are given in detail in SI section S2 to S7.

In vitro activity assays of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors
The pGEX4T1-Mpro plasmid was constructed (AtaGenix, Wuhan) and transfected into the E. coli
strain BL21 (CodonPlus, Stratagene). A GST-tagged protein was purified by GST-glutathione affinity
chromatography and cleaved with thrombin. The purity of the recombinant protein was greater than
95% as assessed by SDS–PAGE. The catalytic activity of Mpro was measured by continuous kinetic
assays, using an identical fluorogenic substrate MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (Apetide Co.,
Ltd, Shanghai, China). The fluorescence intensity was monitored with a Multifunctional Enzyme
Marker (SpectraMax®i3x, Molecular Devices, U.S.A.) using wavelengths of 320 and 405 nm for
excitation and emission, respectively. The experiments were performed in a 100 μL reaction system
with a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 1 mM EDTA. To determine IC50 for each
compound, the compound was diluted in 100% DMSO to the desired concentrations, solution
containing Mpro (at the final concentration of 500 nM) was dispensed into black 96-well plates with
glass-bottom (Jing’an, Shanghai, China) and was incubated with 1 μL compound at room temperature
for 10 min. The reaction was initiated by adding the substrate (at the final concentration of 20 μM).
Fluorescence was monitored once every 45 s. Initial reaction velocities were calculated by fitting the
linear portion of the curves (within the first 5 min of the progress curves) to a straight line using the
program SoftMax Pro and were converted to enzyme activity (substrate cleaved)/second.
