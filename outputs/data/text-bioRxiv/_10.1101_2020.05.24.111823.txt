Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection have caused global pandemic and claimed over 5,000,000
tolls1-4. Although the genetic sequences of their etiologic viruses are of high homology,
the clinical and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 significantly differ from
SARS5,6. Especially, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes vast replication in vivo
without being effectively monitored by anti-viral immunity7. Here, we show that the
viral protein encoded from open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2, which
shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins, can directly
interact with MHC-I molecules and significantly down-regulates their surface
expression on various cell types. In contrast, ORF8a and ORF8b of SARS-CoV do
not exert this function. In the ORF8-expressing cells, MHC-I molecules are
selectively target for lysosomal degradation by an autophagy-dependent mechanism.
As a result, CTLs inefficiently eliminate the ORF8-expressing cells. Our results
demonstrate that ORF8 protein disrupts antigen presentation and reduces the
recognition and the elimination of virus-infected cells by CTLs8. Therefore, we
suggest that the inhibition of ORF8 function could be a strategy to improve the
special immune surveillance and accelerate the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease has been spreading around the
world rapidly1-4. Although both COVID-19 and SARS cause severe respiratory illness,
the epidemiological and clinical data suggest that the disease spectrum of COVID-19
significantly differ from that of SARS: COVID-19 shows longer incubation period,
which is around 6.4 days, ranged from 0 to 24 days; the interpersonal transmissions
could occur from pre-symptomatic individuals5,6; asymptomatic infection has been
widely reported for COVID-19 and severely jeopardize the prevention system in a
community5; a significant portion of recovered patients still keep shedding viral
genetic substances in upper respiratory tract and digestive tract, leading to their stay
in the hospital for a significant long time9-11; a certain amount of recovered patients
turn to re-detectable viral RNA positive after discharge from the hospital12. The
desynchronization of viral titer and clinical symptom development suggest that the
etiologic agent SARS-CoV-2 could have undergone extensive replication in infected
host cells without being effectively monitored by host anti-viral immunity.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are important for the control of viral infections
by directly eradicating the virus-infected cells. In a virus-infected cell, MHC-I
molecules present peptides derived from a variety of viral proteins. Once the T cell
receptor on CD8+ T cells recognizes the special signal presented by MHC-I-peptide
complex, the CTL releases various toxic substances including perforins, granzyme,
and FasL which directly induce the death of viral-infected cells, as well as many other
cytokines such as interferon-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, etc8. As a result, the cells supporting
the viral replication will be eradicated and the spread of viruses will be effectively

prevented13. Some viruses leading to chronic infection, such as human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(KSHV), can disrupt antigen presentation for immune envision by down-regulating
MHC-I on the surface of cells and evading the immune surveillance14-16. Given that
SARS-CoV-2 exerts some characteristics of viruses causing chronic infection, we
hypothesize that the viral protein(s) of SARS-CoV-2 may affect the antigen
presentation system and assist the viruses to escape from immune surveillance.

Identification of ORF8 as a potent regulator for MHC-I.
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is comprised of ~30,000 nucleotides, sharing 79%
sequence identity with SARS-CoV. Similar with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has four
structure proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N)17,18.
It also harbors some accessory proteins at its 3’ portion (Fig. 1A). Given that the
function of almost all structural and non-structural viral proteins of SARS-CoV has
been identified, we reasoned that the possible HIV-1 Nef- or Vpu-like function, if
exist, would likely fall into the membrane-bound structural proteins or these 3’
accessory ORFs. Initially, we examined the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and these
un-clarified ORFs for the possible anti-immunity function. Among them, we found
that the overexpression of ORF8 in 293T cells indeed significantly down-regulated
MHC I (HLA-A2) molecules (Fig. 1B). Specially, the protein sequence of ORF8 of
SARS-CoV-2 exhibited the lowest homology with that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1A)17-19.
The sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the early-phase SARS-CoV

(SARS-CoV_GZ02) in 2003, both of which contain a full-length ORF8, was
approximate 26% (Fig. S1A). However, all SARS-CoV strains identified from the
mid- and late- phase patients in 2003, such as SARS-CoV_BJ01, contain a
29-nucleotide deletion, resulting in a split ORF8, named as ORF8a and ORF8b
respectively (Fig. S1A). The SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein was more distant from
ORF8a (at 10% sequence identity) and ORF8b (at 16% sequence identity) of
SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV_BJ01) (Fig. S1A). Neither the intact ORF8 from
SARS-CoV_GZ02, nor ORF8a or ORF8b of SARS-CoV_BJ01 standing for most
SARS-CoV strains exerted any effect on downregulating MHC-I (Fig. 1C). The
mutation L84S found in the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein was significant for
genotyping and phylogenetic analysis20,21. However, both L and S subtype of
SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 exerted similar effect on down-regulating MHC-I (Fig. 1D).
In order to further analyze the effect of ORF8 upon downregulating MHC-I,
ORF8-expressing plasmid with separate GFP expression (ORF8-IRES-GFP) and
control plasmid (3.1-IRES-GFP) were constructed and transfected into 293T cells. A
HIV-1-Nef-expressing plasmid (HIV-Nef-IRES-GFP), constructed previously by us,
was served as a positive control22. The expression of cell surface level of MHC-I
heavy chain and the second polypeptide component of MHC-I complex
β2-microglobulin (β2M) was determined by flow cytometry (Fig. S1B). We found that

both the frequency and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MHC-I and β2M were
significantly downregulated by ORF8 overexpression (Fig. 1E and F), as well as the
total protein of MHC-I (Fig. 1G). This effect is dose-dependent and increased along

with the incubation time (Fig. S1C and D). Furthermore, the MHC- I molecules on
various cell lines including human fetal colon cell line FHC, human bronchial
epithelial cell line HBE, and human liver cell line Huh7 were also significantly
downregulated by ORF8 (Fig. S1E, and Fig1. H). Finally, an authentic SARS-CoV-2
strain

were

to

infect

ACE2-overexpressed 293T cells at MOI 0.1. After 48 h, the infected cells were
collected for analysis. We first confirmed the protein expression of ORF8 with
Western blot, which is consistent with a recent proteomics data23 (Fig. S1F).
Importantly, we also found that the expression of MHC-1 on the infected 293T cells
was significantly decreased (Fig. 1I).

MHC-I is targeted for lysosomal degradation by ORF8
To define the mechanism of ORF8-mediated MHC-I reduction, cells were treated
with a variety of inhibitors that block membrane protein degradation via different
pathways, including N2, N4-dibenzylquinazoline-2,4-diamine (DBeQ), which blocks
endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD); MG132, which
blocks ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS); and bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1), which
blocks lysosomal degradation. Among these inhibitors, the most significant counteract
of MHC-I protein expression reduction by ORF8 was mediated by bafilomycin A1,
suggesting that the lysosomal degradation is the major pathway for ORF8-mediated
MHC-I downregulation (Fig. 2A and B). Indeed, we found that MHC-I was enriched
in lysosomes in ORF8-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in ORF8-expressing

cells, the surface expression of MHC-I was almost abrogated, and redistributed into
cytoplasm showing a strong co-localization with LAMP1 (Fig. 2D). We further
determined whether ORF8 and MHC-I could interact physically. Through confocal
experiment, we first found that ORF8 strikingly co-localized with MHC-I (Fig. 2E).
Immunoprecipitation (IP) data further confirmed the binding of ORF8 with either
endogenous or exogenous MHC-I (Fig. 2F and G). Collectively, these data suggest
that ORF8 can directly bind to MHC-I molecules and targets for lysosomal
degradation.

ORF8 mediates MHC-I degradation through an autophagy-dependent pathway.
To further identify how SARS-CoV-2 decreases MHC-I expression through
ORF8, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis to search for the proteins
interacting with ORF8 protein. Consisting with others’ report24, the top enrichments
of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 interacting proteins were located at endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), indicating that the host interactions of ORF8 may facilitate the significant
reconfiguration of ER trafficking during viral infection (Fig. S2A). In addition, ORF8
showed strong co-localization with CALNEXIN+ ER and LAMP1+ lysosome, rather
than GM130+ Golgi or RAB5+ early endosome (Fig. 3A, Fig. S2B, and Fig. S2C),
suggesting that ORF8 most likely performed its function for down-regulating MHC-I
at ER or lysosome rather than Golgi or plasma membrane. Also, the knockdown of
vesicle-trafficking-related AP1, AP2, or AP3 proteins failed to counteract the MHC-I
downregulation mediated by ORF8, further excluding the possible involvements of

vesicles transport cargo from the trans-Golgi network, plasma membrane, or
endosomal network (Fig. S3A)25. Conversely, the knockdown of ERAD-related
proteins including HDR1, SEL1L1, ERLIN2, CANX, OS9, or ERLEC1 did not
counteract the ORF8-mediated MHC downregulation (Fig. S3B)26. The ubiquitination
of MHC-I had not significantly changed upon ORF8 over-expression, further
excluding the possible involvement of ERAD pathway (Fig. S3C). Thus, we reasoned
that ORF8 could mediate MHC-I trafficking from ER to lysosome for degradation.
The trafficking from ER to lysosome is most likely mediated by ER-phagy, which
is a kind of selective autophagy and could be divided into three categories:
macro-ER-phagy, micro-ER-phagy, and vesicular delivery27. Six autophagy cargo
receptor proteins bind to and recruit substrates to autophagosomal membranes. To
examine their possible involvement, these receptors, including FAM134B, RTN3,
ATL3, SEC62, CCPG1, or TEX264, were knocked down with siRNAs respectively27.
However, we did not observe any effect upon MHC-I expression in the presence of
ORF8 (Fig. S3D).
Nevertheless, to search for the possible involvement of autophagy, we first
examined the co-localization between ORF8 or MHC-I and autophagosomes within
the cells. A substantial fraction of ORF8 co-localized with LC3B-labeled
autophagosomes in the ORF8-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). A substantial fraction of the
MHC-I puncta also co-localized with LC3B-labelled autophagosomes (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, the specific autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) and E64/pep
restored the expression of MHC-I both on cell surface and total protein level (Fig. 3D,

S3E). LC3B was also highly enriched in lysosomes in ORF8-expressing cells (Fig.
3E). Specifically, we found that the knockdown of ATG5, ATG7, Beclin1, and the
autophagy cargo proteins RB1CC1 (FIP200) or GABARAP also restored the MHC-I
expression, either on the cell surface or cell totality (Fig. 3F-G, S3F-H). However, the
knockdown of NBR1 which participates in the MHC-I downregulation in pancreatic
cancer cells did not exert any effect, excluding its involvement (Fig. S3I)28. Together,
although we did yet not observe solid evidence for ER-phagy, at least we found that
autophagy plays an important role in ORF8-mediated downregulation of MHC-I.

ORF8 mediates the resistance of SARS-CoV-2 to antiviral CTLs

SARS-CoV spike-protein derived peptide-1 (SSp-1, RLNEVAKNL) is predicted to be
a potential SARS-CoV-2 epitope30, and well characterized for immune response31. In
order to assess the immune evasion caused by ORF8-mediated MHC downregulation,
we generated SSp-1 specific CTLs by sensitization of HLA-A2+ healthy donor PBLs
with autologous DCs pre-pulsed with SSp-1 (Fig. 4A). SSP-1 pulsed control 293T or
ORF8-expressing 293T cells were used as target cells. The result showed the SSp-1
CTLs eliminated ORF8-expressing target cells with lower efficiency (Fig. 4B).
Further, we isolated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells from 5 patients who

recently recovered from the infection. To evaluate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of
CD8+ T cells, a mixture of synthetic peptides derived from the S and N proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 were used by following the previous SARS studies with minor amino
acid modifications31-33(supplemental table 1). The PBMCs were treated with the
peptide mixture for 7 days, followed by ELISpot analysis to detect IFN-γ secretion.
As shown in Figure 4C, compared with healthy donors, the numbers of
IFN-γ-secreting CTLs in patient #2, 3 and 5 were much higher than other patients,
suggesting that the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response in these
patients. The CD8+ T cells of HLA-A2+ donor Patient #3 was therefore used for CTL
killing assay. The 293T or ORF8-expressing 293T cells were pulsed with synthetic
peptide mixture of SARS-CoV-2 and served as target cells, followed by mixture with
the effector T cells. Compared with the control, the SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs also
eliminated ORF8-expressing target cells with lower efficiency, indicating that ORF8
protected the target cells from CTL-mediated lysis (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
Viral infection would elicit effective innate and adoptive immune response to
inhibit the viral replication. Apparently, the anti-viral immunity on SARS-CoV-2
infection remains largely unknown. A proportion of recovered patients still exhibit as
the virus carriers and the case of CD8+ lymphocytes dysfunction was reported9-12.
These clinical characters of COVID-19 suggest that SARS-Cov2 could lead to
adoptive immune disorder while remain active viral replication. In this report, we

have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 mediates MHC-I downregulation, which
is not observed in any other strains of SARS-CoV. The discrepancy of ORF8 between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV could at least partially be responsible for specific
COVID-19 clinical and pathological characteristics, which somehow behaves as a
chronic viral infection.
Although some other viruses have also developed the capability to evade the
immune surveillance by impairing the antigen presentation, the underlying
mechanism is different from each other. HIV-1 Nef mainly facilitates the interaction
between AP-1 and MHC and prevent the MHC-I molecule move to plasma membrane.
Instead, it re-routes the MHC-I from trans-Golgi network to late endosome/lysosome
for degradation25,34. K3 and K5 protein of KSHV induce the ubiquitination of MHC-I
on the plasma membrane and facilitate its endocytosis15,35. Moreover, E3/E19 protein
encoded by adenovirus disrupt the association between ER protein TAP and MHC-I
and retains MHC-I molecule in ER, impairing the peptide-MHC-I assembly and
presentation36,37. In this study, we found that ER-resident ORF8 induces the
degradation of MHC-I. After excluding the possible involvement of ERAD and other
abnormal trafficking, it is reasonably assumed that ER-phagy could participate in this
process. However, as we did not find any role played by 6 identified ER-phagy
receptors, it is difficult to conclude the involvement of ER-phagy at present38. It has
been known that ER-phagy is divided into three categories: macro-ER-phagy,
micro-ER-phagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The former is
dependent upon the formation of autophagosome27,39,40. As we found that the

autophagy cargo proteins RB1CC1 (FIP200) or GABARAP are important for
ORF8-mediated MHC-I downregulation, it is possible that an unidentified receptor
harboring GABARAP-interacting motif (GIM) or FIP200-interacting region (FIR)
play a critical role for this process27,41,42. Nevertheless, multiple lines of evidence
have indicated the participation of autophagy. Based upon our data, we propose that,
instead of regular routing through Golgi to plasma membrane, MHC-I at ER is
captured by ORF8 and is re-routed to autophagosome and subsequently to
autolysosome for degradation (Fig.S4).
SARS-CoV-2 utilize its ORF8 as a unique mechanism to alter the expression of,
but not limited to, surface MHC-I expression to evade immune surveillance. Although
questions regarding the more detailed molecular mechanisms remain to be further
discovered, we provided an important aspect for understanding of how ORF8 disrupts
antigen presentation and assistant SARS-CoV-2 immune envision. While current
anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs mainly target enzymes or structural proteins essential to viral
replication, our study may promote the development of compounds specifically
targeting the impairment of MHC-I antigen presentation by ORF8, and therefore
enhancing immune surveillance on SARS-CoV-2 infection.

cells (1.6 × 105 cells/mL) were transfected with pcCMV-ACE2-Flag. After 24 h, cells
were washed with PBS and infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2 at MOI=0.1 for 1 h
at 37 °C. Then, cells were washed with PBS, and replaced with DMEM (2% FBS).
Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were harvested for western blot or testing
HLA-A2 expression with flow cytometry.

Immunofluorescence assay
Immunofluorescence assay was performed as previously described48. HEK293T cells
were seeded on in μ-slide chambered coverslips (Ibidi; 80826), and transfected as
indicated. The transfected cells were treated with DMSO or Baf A1 (100 nM) for 16 h.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4%
poly-formaldehyde in room temperature for 10 min, then permeabilized with 0.1%
Saponin in PBS for 15 min and blocked with 5% BSA PBS for 30 min. Cells were

incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with
0.1% Tween-20 PBS for three times, cells were stained with secondary antibodies for
1 h, and 4’,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for 5 min. Samples
were scanned with Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscopy and analyzed with Imaris.
Primary antibodies used in IF assay include anti-GM130 (CST), anti-Calnexin
(Proteintech),

anti-Rab5

(CST),

anti-HA (MBL),

anti-Lamp1

(CST),

and

anti-HLA-A2 (abcam). Images were obtained with LSM880 confocal microscopy
(Zeiss). Image analysis and quantification were performed with Imaris 8.4 software
(Bitplane).

Lysosome isolation
For lysosome isolation experiments, HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated
plasmids. The cells were treated with 10 μg/mL E64d and 10 μg/mL pepstatin A (pep)
for 6 h. Forty-eight hours post transfection, cells were collected for lysosome isolation.
The preparation of Lysosomal Fraction was performed by following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma, LYSISO1). In brief, the 2.7 PCV of 1× Extraction
buffer was added into the cells. The lysis samples were vortexed to achieve an even
suspension, and then broken in a 7 mL Dounce homogenizer using Pestle B. Trypan
Blue solution staining was used to ascertain the degree of breakage. The samples were
centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new
centrifuge tube. The samples were centrifuged again at 20,000 × g for 20 min in
microcentrifuge tubes and the supernatant liquid was removed.

In-cell cross-linking
In-cell cross-linking was performed using dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP)
(Thermo Scientific) as previously described49. DSP were freshly prepared as a 25 mM
solution in DMSO and diluted to a working concentration of 0.5 mM in PBS. Cells
were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with the cross-linker solution for 30
min at room temperature. Then cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min
with quenching solution (1M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5). Quenching solution was then removed,
and cells were washed twice with PBS and cell lysates were prepared for
co-immunoprecipitation assay.

Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)
Co-IP assay were performed as our previously described47. In brief, HEK293T cells
were lysed with NP40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%
NP-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 Mm EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1% protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (TOPSCIENCE)
for 30 min on ice with briefly vertaxing every 10 min. During this period, anti-HA-tag
beads were washed three times with ice-cold STN buffer (10 mM Tri-HCl buffered at
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100). The lysates were collected
and incubated with the prepared anti-HA-tag beads for 4 h or overnight at 4°C with
rotating. Then, the immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with ice-cold STN buffer,

eluted by boiling SDS loading buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE for western
blotting or mass spectrometry analysis.

Mass spectrometry analysis
HEK293T cells were seeded on 10 cm dish and transfected with 12 μg of ORF8-HA,
At 48 hours (h) after transfection, cells were collected and lysed for co-IP assay, and
the elution was boiled at 100°C with loading buffer supplemented with DTT and
separated through 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then visualized with
ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain Kit (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The whole lane was cut into ten slices and prepared for liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis as previously
described48. Functional pathways representative of each gene signature was analyzed
for enrichment in gene categories from the Gene Ontology Biological Processes
(GO-BP) database (Gene Ontology Consortium) using DAVID Bioinformatics
Resources, observing correlation between two replicate experiments.

Generation of CTLs in healthy donors.
The PBMCs derived from HLA-A2+ healthy donors were isolated from peripheral
blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient separation. PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI
1640 and allowed to adhere to plates at a final concentration of 5×106/ml. After 37°C
overnight, non-adherent cells were gently removed. The resulting adherent cells were
cultured in medium supplemented with GM-CSF (100 ng/ml, Peprotech) and IL-4

(100 ng/ml, Peprotech) in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Every 2 days, one-half of the medium
was replaced by fresh medium containing double concentration of GM-CSF and IL-4
as indicated above. After 5 days of culture, 10 ng/mL recombinant human tumor
necrosis factor (TNF-α, Peprotech) was added to the medium to induce phenotypic
and functional maturation. Then, 48 hours later, DCs were pulsed with 20μg/mL
SSP-1 peptide in the presence of 3μg/mL

β

-microglobulin (Sino Biological) at 37°C

for 3 hours before use. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs, 2×106) were cocultured
with 2×105 peptide-pulsed autologous DCs in a 24-well plate in the presence of 10
ng/mL recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2; Peprotech). The next day,
recombinant human IL-10 (Peprotech) was added to the culture medium, to give a
final concentration of 10 ng/mL. After 7 days, lymphocytes were re-stimulated with
peptide-pulsed autologous DCs in medium containing 10 ng/mL IL-2. Lymphocytes
were re-stimulated each week in the same manner. At 7 days after the fourth round of
re-stimulation, cells were harvested and CD8+ cells were purified by microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec) tested by cytotoxicity assay, and tetramer staining.

Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot
The PBMCs derived from recovered SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were isolated
from peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient separation. PBMCs (1×106/ml)
were cultured with the synthetic peptide mixture of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhangzhou
Sinobioway Peptide Co.,Ltd.). Each peptide was diluted at a final concentration of
1μg/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 20 U/ml recombinant human

IL-2 in 24-well culture plate. Half of the medium was changed at day 3 with
supplementation of IL-2 at 10 ng/ml. At day 7, IFN-γ-secreting T cells were detected
by Human IFN-γ ELISpot assay kits (DKW22-1000-096s; Dakewe) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. PBMCs were plated in duplicate at 4×105 per well and then
incubated 24 hours. Spots were then counted using an S6 ultra immunoscan reader
(Cellular Technology Ltd.), and the number of IFN-γ positive T cells was calculated
by ImmunoSpot 5.1.34 software (Cellular Technology Ltd.). The number of spots was
converted into the number of spots per million cells and the mean of duplicate wells
plotted.

Generation of new specificity tetramer using peptide exchange
The peptide exchange experiment was performed with QuickSwitch Quant
HLA-A*02:01 Tetramer Kit-PE (MBL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, dissolve each lyophilized peptide (SSp-1) in DMSO at a stock concentration
of 10 mM. 50 μl of QuickSwitchTM Tetramer was pipetted into a microtube, and 1ul
of target peptide was added and mixed gently with pipetting. Then, 1 μl of peptide
exchange factor was added and mixed gently with pipetting. The samples were
incubated at least for 4 hours at room temperature protected from light.

medium containing 10% FCS and 20 U/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Peprotech) for 7
days. Then, CTLs from recovered SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were isolated and
counted. A total of 5×105 HEK293T cells transfected with either 3.1-GFP or
ORF8-GFP were loaded with 20 ug/ml synthetic peptide mixture of SARS-CoV-2 or
HIV-gag peptides (SL9) at 37 °C for 1 h31. The CD8+ T cells were cocultured with
target cells.
Afterwards, cells were labeled with the fixable viability dye eFluor 780 (FVD,
eBioscience) and analyzed by flow cytometry. For determination of antigen: nontarget
ratio, cell counts of dead SARS-CoV-2 peptides loaded GFP+ cells were divided by
the counts for dead HIV-gag peptides loaded GFP+ cells50.

Statistical analysis
Differences between two or more groups were analyzed by Student's t-test or one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Statistical significance performed using GraphPad
Prism 6. Flow cytometry results were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).
