ABSTRACT

35

In the absence of effective vaccines and with limited therapeutic options, convalescent plasma is

36

being collected across the globe for potential transfusion to COVID-19 patients. The therapy has

37

been deemed safe and several clinical trials assessing its efficacy are ongoing. While it remains

38

to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in

39

the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of ≥1:160 have been recommended in

40

some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here we performed repeated analyses at one-

41

month interval on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the

42

SARS-CoV-2 Spike, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that receptor-

43

binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG slightly decreased between six and ten weeks after

44

symptoms onset but RBD-specific IgM decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a

45

significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing

46

SARS-CoV-2 S wild-type or its D614G variant. If neutralization activity proves to be an

47

important factor in the clinical efficacy of convalescent plasma transfer, our results suggest that

48

plasma from convalescent donors should be recovered rapidly after symptoms resolution.

MAIN TEXT

52

Until an efficient vaccine to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection is available, alternative

53

approaches to treat or prevent acute COVID-19 are urgently needed. A promising approach is the

54

use of convalescent plasma containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies collected from donors who

55

have recovered from COVID-19 (1). Convalescent plasma therapy was successfully used in the

56

treatment of SARS, MERS and influenza H1N1 pandemics and was associated with

57

improvement of clinical outcomes (2-4). Experience to date shows that the passive transfer of

58

convalescent plasma to acute COVID-19 patients has been shown to be well tolerated and

59

presented some hopeful signs (5-9). In one study, the convalescent plasma used had high titers of

60

IgG to SARS-CoV-2 (at least 1:1640), which correlated positively with neutralizing activity (10).

61

While it remains to be formally demonstrated, neutralizing activity is considered an important

62

determinant of convalescent plasma efficacy (11) and regulatory agencies have been

63

recommending specific thresholds for qualifying convalescent plasma prior to its release. While

64

neutralizing function has been associated with protection against reinfection in rhesus macaques

65

(12), other antibody functions may be relevant for controlling an acute infection and should be

66

examined to better understand the correlates of convalescent plasma-mediated efficacy (7).

67
68

It was recently reported that the humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 are built

69

rapidly, peaking at weeks 2 or 3 after symptoms onset but steadily decreases thereafter (13-15).

70

Moreover, in a cross-sectional study we reported that the neutralization capacity decreased

71

between the third and the sixth week after symptoms onset (14). Since convalescent patients are

72

generally required to wait for 14 days after recovery to start plasma donations and that they may

73

give multiple times in the following weeks, most donations are likely to occur even later than

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.194639; this version posted July 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

74

this. Whether the neutralization capacity of convalescent plasma is stabilized after six weeks or

75

decreases further remains unknown. To answer this question, which might have practical

76

implications in the selection of plasma from convalescent donors, we analyzed serological

77

samples from 31 convalescent donors collected at six and ten weeks after symptoms onset.

78
79

All convalescent donors initially tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on

80

nasopharyngeal specimens with complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days before

81

blood sampling. The average age of the donors was 46 years old (22 males and 9 females). We

82

collected plasma samples from each individual at two time-points: 6 weeks after symptoms onset

83

(baseline, median 43 days) and 4 weeks after (1 month, median 74 days after symptoms onset)

84

(Supplemental Table 1).

85
86

We first evaluated the presence of RBD-specific IgG and IgM antibodies by ELISA as

87

we recently described (14). In agreement with a recent report (16), we observed that both RBD-

88

specific IgG and IgM titers significantly decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after symptoms

89

onset. We noted that IgM titers diminished significantly more abruptly than IgG titers (Figure

90

1B and E respectively). Accordingly, the percentage of convalescent individuals presenting

91

detectable titers of IgM decreased by ~13% at 10 weeks after symptoms onset (Figure 1C) while

92

the percentage of infected individuals presenting detectable titers of IgG remained stable (Figure

93

1F).

94
95

We next used flow cytometry to examine the ability of convalescent plasma to recognize

96

the full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike expressed at the cell surface. Briefly, 293T cells expressing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.194639; this version posted July 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

97

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins were stained with plasma samples, followed by incubation with

98

secondary antibodies recognizing all antibody isotypes. Since the SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating

99

in Europe and North America has the D614G mutation (17), we also evaluated recognition of

100

this variant by flow cytometry. As presented in Supplemental Figure 1A, convalescent plasma

101

from 96.8 % of donors (all but one) recognized both SARS-CoV-2 S (WT and D614G) at

102

baseline. While this percentage remained stable four weeks later, the recognition (mean

103

fluorescence intensity, MFI) was significantly diminished for both WT and D614G S-expressing

104

cells, indicating that Spike-reactive antibodies were less abundant in convalescent plasma

105

collected at this later time point. Interestingly, the MFI were almost identical for cells expressing

106

the WT or D614G variant S (7206 and 7209 respectively, Fig. S1A), suggesting that the mutation

107

did not significantly affect S conformation. In agreement with recent work, we observed that

108

SARS-CoV-2-elicited antibodies cross-react with human Sarbecoviruses (14) (SARS-CoV;

109

Figure S1B) and with another Betacoronavirus (OC43) whereas no cross-reactive antibodies to

110

Alphacoronavirus (NL63, 229E) S glycoproteins (Figure S1C and S2) were detected. Cross-

111

reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV and OC43 S glycoproteins decreased between the

112

two time-points following a trend similar to SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies.

113
114

We next measured the capacity of plasma samples to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing

115

SARS-CoV-2 S, its D614G variant, SARS-CoV S or VSV-G glycoproteins using 293T cells

116

stably expressing ACE2 as target cells (Figure 2). Neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2

117

WT or D614G S glycoprotein, as measured by the neutralization half-maximum inhibitory

118

dilution (ID50), was detected in 71% of patients six weeks after symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2

119

neutralization was specific since no neutralization was observed against pseudoparticles

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.194639; this version posted July 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

120

expressing VSV-G. Neutralizing activity against pseudoparticles bearing the SARS-CoV S

121

glycoprotein was detected in only 25% of convalescent plasma and exhibited low potency, as

122

previously reported (Figure 2) (14). Of note, while we observed enhanced infectivity for the

123

D614G variant compared to its WT SARS-CoV-2 S counterpart (Figure S3A), no major

124

differences in neutralization with convalescent plasma were detected at both time-points (Figure

125

S3B), thus suggesting that the D614G change does not affect the overall conformation of the

126

Spike, in agreement with recent findings (18).

127
128

The capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S WT or D614G-pseudotyped particles

129

significantly correlated with the presence of RBD-specific IgG, IgM and anti-S antibodies

130

(Figure S4). Interestingly, we observed a pronounced decrease (20-30%) in the percentage of

131

patients able to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein between 6 and

132

10 weeks after symptoms onset. Moreover, with plasma that still neutralized, the neutralization

133

activity significantly decreased between these two time-points (Figure 2C). Interestingly, RBD-

134

specific IgM and neutralizing activity declined more significantly in convalescent plasma

135

overtime compared to RBD-specific IgG and anti-S Abs (Figure S5A, B). Moreover, while the

136

loss of neutralizing activity on the WT and D614G pseudoparticles over time correlated with the

137

loss of anti-RBD IgM and IgG antibodies, the correlation was higher for IgM than IgG (Figure

138

S5C, D), suggesting that at least part of the neutralizing activity could be mediated by IgM, as

139

recently proposed (13, 14).

140
141

In summary, our study indicates that plasma neutralization activity keeps decreasing

142

passed the sixth week of symptom onset (14). It is currently unknown whether neutralizing

143

activity is truly driving the efficacy of convalescent plasma in acute COVID-19. If this was

144

found to be the case, our results suggest that efforts should be made to ensure convalescent

145

plasma is collected as soon as possible after recovery from active infection.

3

Ethics statement

4

All work was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in terms of informed

5

consent and approval by an appropriate institutional board. Convalescent plasmas were obtained

6

from donors who consented to participate in this research project at Héma-Québec (REB # 2020-

7

004) and CHUM (19.381). The donors met all donor eligibility criteria: previous confirmed

8

COVID-19 infection and complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days.

10

Plasmids

11

The plasmids expressing the human coronavirus Spikes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, NL63 229E

12

(1, 2) and OC43 (3) were previously described. The D614G mutation was introduced using the

13

QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The presence of the desired

14

mutations was determined by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-

15

2 S RBD was synthesized commercially by Genscript. The RBD sequence (encoding for residues

16

319-541) fused to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression

17

vector. The vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-encoding plasmid (pSVCMV-IN-VSV-G) was

18

previously described (4).

Protein expression and purification

27

FreeStyle 293F cells (Invitrogen) were grown in FreeStyle 293F medium (Invitrogen) to a density

28

of 1 x 106 cells/mL at 37°C with 8 % CO2 with regular agitation (150 rpm). Cells were transfected

29

with a plasmid coding for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD using ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagent, as

30

directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). One week later, cells were pelleted and discarded.

31

Supernatants were filtered using a 0.22 µm filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The recombinant

32

RBD proteins were purified by nickel affinity columns, as directed by the manufacturer

33

(Invitrogen). The RBD preparations were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and

34

stored in aliquots at -80°C until further use. To assess purity, recombinant proteins were loaded on

35

SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue.

36
37

Plasma and antibodies

38

Plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected donors were collected, heat-inactivated for 1

39

hour at 56 °C and stored at -80°C until ready to use in subsequent experiments. Plasma from

40

uninfected donors were used as negative controls and used to calculate the seropositivity threshold

41

in our ELISA and flow cytometry assays. The monoclonal antibody CR3022 was used as a

42

positive control in ELISA assays and was previously described (5-7). Horseradish peroxidase

43

(HRP)-conjugated antibody specific for the Fc region of human IgG (Invitrogen) or for the Fc

44

region of human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, inc.) were used as secondary

45

antibodies to detect antibody binding in ELISA experiments. Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated goat

ELISA

50

The SARS-CoV-2 RBD assay used was recently described (3). Briefly, recombinant SARS-CoV-

51

2 S RBD proteins (2.5 μg/ml), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (2.5 μg/ml) as a negative control,

52

were prepared in PBS and were adsorbed to plates (MaxiSorp; Nunc) overnight at 4°C. Coated

53

wells were subsequently blocked with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing

54

0.1% Tween20 and 2% BSA) for 1h at room temperature. Wells were then washed four times with

55

washing buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing 0.1% Tween20). CR3022 mAb (50ng/ml)

56

or serial dilutions of plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected or uninfected donors (1/100; 1/250;

57

1/500; 1/1000; 1/2000; 1/4000) were prepared in a diluted solution of blocking buffer (0.1 % BSA)

58

and incubated with the RBD-coated wells for 90 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed

59

four times with washing buffer followed by incubation with secondary Abs (diluted in a diluted

60

solution of blocking buffer (0.4% BSA)) for 1h at room temperature, followed by four washes.

61

HRP enzyme activity was determined after the addition of a 1:1 mix of Western Lightning

62

oxidizing and luminol reagents (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Light emission was measured with

63

a LB941 TriStar luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Signal obtained with BSA was subtracted

64

for each plasma and was then normalized to the signal obtained with CR3022 mAb present in each

65

plate. The seropositivity threshold was established using the following formula: mean of all

66

COVID-19 negative plasmas + (3 standard deviation of the mean of all COVID-19 negative

67

plasmas).

Flow cytometry analysis of cell-surface staining

70

Using the standard calcium phosphate method, 10μg of Spike expressor and 2μg of a green

71

fluorescent protein (GFP) expressor (pIRES-GFP) were transfected into 2 × 106 293T cells. At 48h

72

post transfection, 293T cells were stained with plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected or uninfected

73

individuals (1:250 dilution). The percentage of transfected cells (GFP+ cells) was determined by

74

gating the living cell population based on the basis of viability dye staining (Aqua Vivid,

75

Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on a LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON,

76

Canada) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo vX.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).

77

The seropositivity threshold was established using the following formula: mean of all COVID-19

78

negative plasmas + (3 standard deviation of the mean of all COVID-19 negative plasma + inter-

79

assay coefficient of variability).

80
81

Virus neutralization assay

82

293T-ACE2 target cells were infected with single-round luciferase-expressing lentiviral particles.

83

Briefly, 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the lentiviral vector

84

pNL4.3 R-E- Luc (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and a plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike

85

(WT or D614G), SARS-CoV Spike or VSV-G at a ratio of 5:4. Two days post-transfection, cell

86

supernatants were harvested and stored at –80°C until use. 293T-ACE2 target cells were seeded at

87

a density of 1×104 cells/well in 96-well luminometer-compatible tissue culture plates (Perkin

88

Elmer) 24h before infection. Recombinant viruses in a final volume of 100μl were incubated with

89

the indicated plasma dilutions (1/50; 1/250; 1/1250; 1/6250; 1/31250) for 1h at 37°C and were

90

then added to the target cells followed by incubation for 48h at 37°C; cells were lysed by the

91

addition of 30μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) followed by one freeze-thaw cycle. An LB941

92

TriStar luminometer (Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the luciferase activity of each

93

well after the addition of 100μl of luciferin buffer (15mM MgSO4, 15mM KPO4 [pH 7.8], 1mM

94

ATP, and 1mM dithiothreitol) and 50μl of 1mM d-luciferin potassium salt (Prolume). The

95

neutralization half-maximal inhibitory dilution (ID50) represents the plasma dilution to inhibit 50%

96

of the infection of 293T-ACE2 cells by recombinant viruses bearing the indicated surface

Statistical analyses

100

Statistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.2 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, (USA).

101

Every data set was tested for statistical normality and this information was used to apply the

102

appropriate (parametric or nonparametric) statistical test. P values <0.05 were considered

Figure S3. D614G mutation enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity but does not affect its susceptibility to plasma neutralization.(A) Reverse Transcriptase normalized levels of pseudoviral particles bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S WT or D614G variant
were used to infect 293T/ACE2 cells and infectivity measured 48h later by luciferase activity. Graph shown represents the
percentage of infectivity relative to pseudoviral particle bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S WT. Statistical significance was tested using
Mann-Whitney U tests (**** p < 0.0001). (B) Comparison between the neutralization ID50 from pseudoparticles bearing
SARS-CoV-2 S WT and SARS-CoV-2 S D614G. Statistical significance was tested using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank
test. (ns, not significant).
