SARS-CoV-2 is a highly virulent and deadly RNA virus causing the Covid-19 pandemic and several
deaths across the world. The pandemic is so fast that any concrete theory of sudden widespread
of this disease is still not known. In this work, we studied and analyzed a large number of publicly
available SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the world using the multifractal approach. The mutation
events in the isolates obey the Markov process and exhibit very high mutational rates, which occur
in six specific genes and highest in orf1ab gene, leading to virulent nature. f (α) analysis indicated
that the isolates are highly asymmetric (left-skewed), revealing the richness of complexity and
dominance by large fluctuations in genome structure organization. The values of Hq and Dq are
found to be significantly large, showing heterogeneous genome structure self-organization, strong
positive correlation in organizing the isolates, and quite sensitive to fluctuations in and around it.
We then present multiple-isolates hosts-virus interaction models, and derived Price equation for
the model. The phase plane analysis of the model showed asymptotic stability type bifurcation.
The competition among the mutant isolates drives the trade-off of the dominant mutant isolates,
otherwise confined to the present hosts.

Introduction
The special concern about the Covid-19 is the type of pneumonia, which is deadly and highly infectious [1] causing
the sudden outbreak of this disease from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] and, spread to different parts of
the world that led to WHO to declare this epidemic as an emergency in global public health [3]. Coronaviruses
(CoVs) belongs to Coronaviridae subfamily (which have α, β, γ, δ-CoVs genera) in the family Coronaviridae of
the Nidovirales order [4]. The Covid-19 causing virus SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member in β-CoV genus [5],
which can infect humans [6], and it’s genetic manipulation studies, and sequence analysis has led to the claim
that it is not laboratory manipulated virus [6, 7]. It’s genome is +ssRNS (single-stranded positive-sense RNA
virus) [4, 5] having 30kb genome size [8] which becomes 100-160nm in compact form [4, 6, 7]. Further, it’s genome
has been found 80% similarity with that of SARS-CoV, whereas around 96% similarity with that of bat coronavirus [9].
Clinical symptoms of Covid-19 include dry cough, sore throat, headache, fever, problems in breathing, dyspnea [3],
which may lead to developing problems of organ failure, severe pneumonia, septic shock, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, etc. to some patients [10]. However, SARS-CoV-2 enter and infect target host cells (lung, intestine,
kidney, and blood vessels) through the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and ACE2 expression is
found to be increased in diabetes (type 1 or type 2) [11]. Further, hypertension is treated with ACE inhibitors and
angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) [11], resulting in an increase in ACE2 expression [12]. Hence, diabetes
and hypertension patients might have a severe risk of developing Covid-19 as these patients use ACE inhibitors and
ARBs as a drug which upregulate ACE2 expression [13]. Moreover, there are number of reports and unsolved cases
regarding the infection of this virus to different people at different geographical conditions, people of different ages,
sex and pregnant woman, demographical parameters, etc. [3, 14, 15].
There is no concrete theory so far why SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity to human host cells, which in turn led
to extremely fast human-to-human transmission as compared to other members of CoVs and even among seven
members in β-CoV. One belief is that SARS-CoV-2 has receptor binding protein (RBD) that has high cohesive
towards human receptor ACE2 [7, 9], it’s spike protein has functional polybasic cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction
which is quite variable [7, 9, 16]. Then it might allow jumping to the human host cells via comfortable adap-

tation for fast transmission [7]. However, theory of the origin of this virus and pandemic caused by it are still debatable.
Winsor theory of Covid-19 pandemic
The initial growth of the infected people of Covid-19 pandemic in any country across the world follow interesting
Malthusian exponential growth law with time [17] as shown in Fig. 1 adapted from Roser et. al. world data [18]).
If N (t) is the time-dependent confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected population (Fig. 1A), or confirmed death population
(Fig. 1B), one can see that each curve of each country follow one of the following growth law at different growth
stages [17, 19–21],

where, C and D are constants, and H(t) is a function of t. The initial growth rate of Covid-19 pandemic is dominated
by Malthus growth rate [17], and if we consider significant amount of time of the pandemic, coronavirus infected or
death population nicely follow logistic [19] or more systematically Gompertz growth law [20]. The spread of every
disease epidemic or pandemic generally increase monotonically (following Malthus law [17]) due to availability of
large susceptible population till it reach threshold value [22] (follow logistic or Gompertz law [19, 20]). After reaching
this threshold size of epidemic, it will gradually decrease the size of epidemic due to removal of all susceptible
populations and gradual decrease of the virus virulence, die out slowly [22]. In such scenario, the Winsor growth
model [21] is quite suitable to explain and forecast, because, the function H(t) in the solution of Winsor model

growth law, N (t) = De−e
, which is modified form of Gompertz model, can well explain the pandemic. The
uncontrolled fast growth of N (t) due to lack of proper checking in the N (t) outgrowth may cause inevitable shortage
of food, trapping in (starvation-N (t) outgrowth) cycle which may lead to fast decrease in N (t), the condition known

as Malthusian catastrophe given by, N
iC [17, 23]. However, happening of this condition is unlikely, even though the
dynamical process could lead to the sacrifice of a certain population of infected people NU (t), who is most probably
unhealthy/non-immune population out of N (t), and the most fitted one NF (t) = N (t) − NU (t) will survive. But,
the question of why the growth rates of both infected and death are different in different countries at the epidemic
network level or genetic level and how to control the epidemic/pandemic size are still open questions.

Mutation effect: Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 divergence
Mutations are considered as the basic units of species evolution [24], which are sometimes harmful and sometimes
beneficial [26] but play important roles in genetic diversity via natural selection [25]. RNA viruses are generally
mutation prone viruses during virus-host interaction, and their mutation rates are high (10−4 − 10−6 ) due to
lack of proofreading activity, and the small increase in mutation rates in them may cause inability to evolve
with the host [26]. It is also found that this high mutation rate intensifies virulence and coevolution of the virus
with the host [24]. Further, these mutations in them are accountable for viral genome replication [27]. Hence
high mutation rates in them have some significance, namely, in helping adaptability to the host [27], in enhancing
the degree of viral genome replication kinetics [28] etc. leading to increase in their virulence causing human pandemic.
We have mined publicly available complete genomic data of various SARS-CoV-2 isolates (42 isolates in total) for
seven countries (Supplementry TABLE 1). Taking Wuhan seafood market isolate with accession number N C 045512.2
as the reference genome, sequence comparison of these isolate genomes of SARS-CoV-2 with the reference genome is
done, and clustered the isolates as phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). The phylogenetic tree thus obtained (Fig. 2) indicates
that there are approximately three main clusters of isolates (shades colors in Fig. 2) distributed across the countries.
Surprisingly, it is also found that some of the isolates obtained in other countries (LR757996, MN988668, MN988669,
MN996528, MN996530, MT019532) are completely similar to that of the reference genome. Further, the distribution
of the virus isolates across these countries are found to be random.
We, then, calculated mutation rates (mutation per unit nucleotide) of the mined isolates, and found that the
mutation rate (mr ) of these isolates are very high (mr ∈ [10−4 − 10−5 ]), which could be a reason of causing the
pandemic. The calculated mean value of the mutation per gene of the virus with error bars given by first and
third quartiles (Fig. 2A) indicates that mutations take place at some specific genes only (mainly in orf1ab, S,

ORF3a, M, ORF8, N genes). The results show that mr of orf 1ab and ORF 3a, such that morf 1ab imORF 3a , and
these two genes could be key genes for enhancing virus virulence and transmission [24, 27] which may lead to a
disease epidemic. Further, the mean values of mutation rates of all isolates in each country are calculated and
found the overall mutation rates S. Korea, Sweden, Japan, and the USA are large in comparison. The confirmed
Covid-19 positive case, as well as death rate in these countries, are found to be comparatively large in comparison
with other countries (Fig. 1), indicating an increase in mutation rate enhances the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 virus
[24, 28]. Further, we calculated mutation rates of all six types of mutations Ni → Ni−1 , where, i = 1, 2, 3, 4,
Ni ∈ [A, C, T, G] and, for the sake of simplicity, Ni → Ni−1 and Ni−1 → Ni are taken to be the same in the
calculation (Fig. 3B). The results show that the average mutation rates of these mutation types in each country
are found to be random and follow the Markov process [29]. It is observed that the transition is more frequent
than transversion. During the evolution of genomes, the transition is more frequently observed as compared to
transversion as the former usually does not lead to altering the protein, but the later has a higher impact on the
change in the protein structure and function [30]. Some isolates of Wuhan, China contains transversion indicating
that there is rapid evolution leading to adaptation with the new environment for survival or possibly making these
isolates more virulent compared to their counterpart. On the other hand, LR757995 out of a total of 15 isolates
only consist of C → T mutation type at genomic location 8781. This specific mutation is seen to mutate along
with mutation from T → C at genomic position 28143. These two mutations at positions 8781 and 28143 are
highly prevalent in the USA (14 out of 16) and Japanese isolates (3 out of 4). Besides the isolates available from
South Korea, Nepal, Sweden, one isolate from Taiwan and Australia does not contain these two specific mutations.
It is probable that the genomic isolates spreading in the USA are less virulent compared to the reference Wuhan virus.
On the other hand, out of all Japanese isolates available, only one isolate showed transversion mutation at genomic
location 29704. This mutation is at the coding region and codes for the 3′ stem-loop II-like motif (also known as s2m)
whose function is not yet fully known, but have been found to have a role in viral replication [31]. But we observed
that most of these isolates have transitional mutation C → T at genomic location 8781. This mutation falls in the
coding region, namely, nsp4 and codes for transmembrane domain 2(TM2). Maximum mutation type is observed to
be C → T in most genomic isolates falling in the orf 1ab gene (Fig. 3A and B).
Complexity in SARS-CoV-2 isolates:
We analyze the genomic complexity of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates using multifractal analysis [32, 33] to get an insight
into the impact of genome variability and to understand the virulence of the virus isolates in a different perspective.
In this technique, we first convert the symbolic genome sequence to time series like DNA walk by taking purine( A
or G) as step-up (+1) and pyrimidine as step down (−1) [see the Methods]. DNA walk is a cumulative sum, which
means that the effect of a single point mutation can lead to different walk altogether, and hence we can quantify
them using Multifractal parameters [see the Methods]. Then multifractal analysis can be done from the DNA walk of
each viral isolate to calculate various multifractal parameters. The DNA walks of all SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus isolates
collected from the patients’ data from various countries (42 isolates) as a function of order parameter q obey Markov
process (Fig. 4A). The calculated fluctuation function Fq (s) of order q as a function of normalized s [s = int(S/L),
L is the length of the DNA walk of the virus genome] for all SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates follow overall power-law
behavior Fq (s) ∼ sHq , where, Hq is the Hurst exponent of order q [34] (Fig. 4B) indicating fractal nature in the virus
genome organization. Further, the calculated Hq as a function of q is found to be q and s dependent (Fig. 4B and
Fig. 5D) indicating the scaling nature in Fq (s) is inter-event dependent showing multifractal nature [32]. Since the
Fq behavior indicate local multiple fractal natures at various local domains of s with various local Hurst exponents,

in each country with error bars indicated by first and third quartiles (Fig. 4C). We found that FqA in S. Korea is
much higher than in other countries, and FqA variability is much more in Wuhan and then in Japan. The high value
of FqA indicates the presence of multiple isolates in Wuhan, and induces large variability in the virus genome could

cause large variability in FqA which might be harm to the hosts in the disease epidemic.
We then calculated singularity function f (α) of all the virus isolates (Fig. 4D) and found the curves collapse roughly
at α ∼ 1 and left and right hand parts of of the curves around the value of α = α∗ at which f (α∗ ) → fmax (fmax is the
maximum value of f ) is quite biased and even left parts of the curves about α∗ are quite small. Since f (α∗ ) → fmax
for α∗ ∼ 1.13 ± 0.012i1 for all curves, the virus isolates are of heterogeneous structure driving genome organization
complex [36] (Fig. 4D). To understand the behavior of f around α∗ , we can expand f (α) around α∗ by Taylor series
expansion,

where, u∗ is the degree of f (α) after truncation. Then the symmetry of f (α), which can characterize the complexity
in the system, is defined by a skew parameter χ,

where, f (α) is right-skewed if χi1, left-skewed if χh1 and perfect symmetry if χ = 1 [32]. It is clearly seen from
Fig. 4D that ∆αR ≫ ∆αL indicating asymmetric nature of χ. Hence, we calculated average ∆αA ≈ ∆αA
R of each
country taking into account all the virus isolates in the country (Fig. 4E), and found that the value of ∆αA is much
higher in Sweden, Australia, Taiwan and USA indicating richness in genome structure showing strong signature
of multifractality, leading to the complex behavior of the virus. However, the variability of ∆αA is quite large in
Wuhan, which could be due to the presence of multiple isolates indicating virulence of the virus leading to epidemic
[37, 38]. Then we calculated average χA for the countries we have taken and found that χA h1 (left-skewed) revealing
the dominance of the virus genome organization and scaling in multifractality by large fluctuations [32, 36] (Fig. 4F).
The values of χA are found to similar for all the countries, but the variability is much large for Wuhan, Taiwan and
Japan which could be dependent of the large fluctuations in the virus isolates on demography.
Now, we calculated generalized dimension Dq for the virus isolates from their corresponding DNA walks using,

where, Ukq (r) = limN →∞ NNk is the probability that kth DNA walk segment of length scale r will have Nk observations,
and obeys Ukq (r) ∼ rλ [34], where, λ is Holder exponent [39]. The results of Dq shows that Dq is quite dependent
on q (Fig. 5A) indicating rich heterogeneous structure in the virus isolates [32], where, local structures in the
genome could have various properties and functions. The changes in those local structure may induce drastic change
in genome as well as phenotypic behavior of the virus isolates. We then calculated relative change of the isolates
with respect to reference virus genome Dq − DqC with q (Fig. 5B) shows significant changes in the parameters and
Dq − DqC i0 indicating increase in complexity due to increase in heterogeneous structure as compared to reference
virus genome. The complexity in virus isolate in Japan is quite high (DqA is highest) as compared to other countries
(Fig. 5C), and variability in complexity in Wuhan is much more as compared to other countries.
We, then, calculated Hq as a function of q (Fig. 5D) by using the MFDFA approach described in Methods.
Since the Hq values are quite variable with respect to q, the isolate genomes show high heterogeneous structures.
Further, since Hq i0.5, genomic signal in the whole virus isolate genome sequences indicate positive correlations
in them [40] indicating possibility of strong self-organizing behavior in each virus isolate [32, 41]. The calculated
change in Hq with respect to reference virus genome Hq − HqC i0 is positive (Fig. 5E), the correlations in the
virus genome increases in the mutated isolates which could be one reason for increase in virulence in virus
isolates. The average value in HqA and variability are much more in Wuhan virus isolates as compared to other
countries (Fig. 5F). The multifractal analysis of the virus isolates across the countries reveals that mutated virus
isolates have increased virulence as compared to the reference virus. Further, presence of multiple isolates in a
host also enhances virulence of the virus. The virus isolate is quite sensitive to fluctuations and might correlated
to increase in virus mutations which cause heterogeneity in genome structure exhibiting strong multifractal properties.
Price theory of evolution of mutant isolates in infected disease
One of most important basic reasons of outbreak of an epidemic could be due to sudden trade-off of multiple viral

species modulated by high mutation effects, which obey Markov process, due to virus-hosts interaction [26, 42]. This
epidemic process could be dependent on various factors, namely, virus virulence, transmission (passive and active)
etc [43]. Let us consider M mutationally different isolates of the virus in the hosts, and xi be the quantitative trait
of ith individual virus or parasite (0 ≤ xi ≤ 1) in the hosts, then the dynamics of mean of this variable (x̄) is given
by Price equation [43–45],

s
qi as the frequency and x as the expected value of survived individual virus during [t, t + dt] respectively [44]. The
model we consider incorporates the mechanism of infecting susceptible hosts S by a virus isolate of type ’i’ (yi is the
concentration of the ith isolate) and then turn into new dominating mutant isolate type ’j = i + 1’ due to mutation
event in hosts-virus interaction [46]. The model allows the presence of different isolate types during the interaction
with the host causing more virulent harming the hosts which could be one of the most important factors which could
drive the virus transmission among the hosts [37, 38]. Then the dynamics of ith isolate variable yi is given by,

The fitness parameter of individual virus isolate type i of jth parent is composed of two forces arises from competition

will be given by, ωi = (1 − xi ). Now, this ωij become one important parameter that determine virus isolate trade-off

Now, if one consider κi is the genetic variability (additive in nature) of the ith mutant isolate group, then, xi can be

and the system will diverge for slight perturbation to it. Further, x̄∗ , in this case, is unstable fixed point because
λi0 for ai0. This condition corresponds to the Malthusian explosion. Following a similar argument for the case
ah0, it can be shown that x̄∗ is a stable fixed point. Hence, the bifurcation diagram of this dynamical system
exhibit asymptotic stability (Fig. 6). Since, µ = µ2 − µ1 , we have, a = (µ2 − µ1 ) [M − 1]. The bifurcation
diagram indicates that for µ2 iµ1 , x̄∗ is unstable fixed point. This is the condition where the rate of generating new
dominating mutant isolates is much more than that of generating its own isolates. This condition could lead to
the trade-off of the new mutant isolates away from the original hosts. This could be the origin of the spreading of
viral infection due to the generation of new mutant viral isolates. This claim can be correlated to the notion that
since mutations in RNA virus is high [26, 27] causing harm to the hosts and hence, transmitted by diffusing from
one host to another causing infection to other hosts [28]. Otherwise, the old viral isolates will stick to the old hosts
(µ2 hµ1 , x̄∗ is a stable fixed point since λh0) without diffusing from the hosts. Further, the characteristics time scale,

which is the time required to determine significant change in x̄ around fixed point x̄∗ , is given by, τ = dF (x̄

such that, ’i’ and ’j’ mutant isolates competitive if µ1 pj;1≤j≤i−1 ≥ µ2 pj;i+1≤j≤M . This condition allows the two
mutant isolates compete among themselves, and if the new mutant ’j’ dominates over ’i’, then there could be high
chance of more virulence due to it’s mutation and may trade-off from the present hosts to the others. However,

Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly virulent RNA virus causing pandemic across the world. Some of the most important factors
of the origin of this virulence could be due to high mutational events in the virus genome when hosts-virus interaction
takes place, and the presence of multiple virus isolates in the host. The Covid-19 pandemic is all of a sudden first
epicenter from Wuhan, China, and spread all over the work, killing nearly two lakh people across the world. The
pandemic is so fast, no concrete theory of the widespread of this disease, and still no vaccine is discovered yet. In this
work, we studied and analyzed a large number of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from patients
from different parts of the world to explore the possibility of the origin of this pandemic. Our study of mutational
profiles of SARS-CoV-2 isolates across the world show very high mutational rates in these isolates, which led the
isolates more virulent, causing significant harm to the hosts and enhance viral transmission to hosts. The mutations
in these isolates also take place mainly in six specific genes out of eleven genes, and the highest mutation takes place
in the orf1ab gene and the mutation events follow the Markov process. It is also found from the mutational profile
study that transition is much more frequent than transversion.
We, then, analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 isolates using the multifractal approach to understand the complexity in
the isolates genome variability and structural organization. The calculated multifractal parameters reveal that
structural variability in the isolates is caused by the presence of multiple isolates in the hosts. These isolates are
highly asymmetric (left-skewed) in the singularity function, indicating the richness of complexity and dominance
by large fluctuations in genome structure organization imparting virulence in the virus. The large values obtained
for Hurst exponent and generalized dimension indicates heterogeneous genome structure organization and strong
positive correlation in the organization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The genome structures of the isolates are far from
equilibrium, self-organized, and quite sensitive to fluctuations in and around it. This could also be the origin of multiple isolates in a certain geographical area. The presence of multiple isolates in hosts may lead the Covid-19 pandemic.
We then study a simple model of hosts-virus interaction by taking into consideration multiple isolates in it and applied
Price theory to understand the epidemic. The theory indicates that the fitness parameter of the isolates, which is
dependent on various factors, namely virulence, fluctuations, etc., is quite sensitive and affected by fluctuations,
multiple isolate interactions with the host, etc. However, Price theory needs to be investigated by taking into account
various factors such as quarantine, exposed, health care, optimized economy, and many other factors.

Materials and Methods
The detailed methods of this study are given below.
Conversion of genomic sequence into DNA Walk
The whole genome of every isolate as well as the reference genome are converted in DNA walk {xi ; i = 1, 2, ..., N } by
considering purine (A or G) as step up (xi =+1) and pyrimidine (C or T) as step down (xi =-1) [48]. The DNA walk
is considered to be a non stationary time series data due to its stochastic behavior and is the input considered for
P
various parameters. This DNA walk is considered as the profile, Y (i) = ij=1 (xj − hxi), where, hxi is the mean, and
i = 1, 2, ..., N .
Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) The Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) is a powerful method for analysing and studying fractal characteristics in non-stationary time series data[34].Using the numerical technique mentioned in Kantelhardt et al.[32, 33] various multifractal parameters
that describe the fractal nature in the time series can be calculated such as generalized dimension(Dq),Hurst exponent(Hq),singularity spectrum(f (α)) etc. We calculate these parameters for all the three types of isolates. The
procedure of MF-DFA has five steps which are summarized.
• Step 1. We consider the nonstationary time series data as the input to MF-DFA algorithm for calculating all
the multifractal parameters. In the first step in MF-DFA the DNA walk time series signal xj having length N
is considered and profile representing the time series is calculated as below,

Y (i) =

i
X
j=1

where < x > is the average value and i = 1,2,3,...N.

(xj − hxi)

• step 2. The profile Y (i) is divided in non-overlapping segments of length (l) of same size as Ns ≡ int(N/s). It
is to note that as the length N of the time series is not usually the multiple of examined time scale s therefore
at the tail part of profile some small part could be remaining. Keeping this in mind the same protocol is redone
from the other end of the time series.Therefore 2Ns segments are calculated altogether.
• step 3. Using the least-square method of fitting calculate the local trend for every segment(2Ns ). We calculate
the variance as follows,
s

F 2 (s, η) =

1X
{Y [(η − 1)s + i] − yη (i)}2
s i=1

(15)

where for every segment η, η = 1, 2, 3, ..., Ns and
s

F 2 (s, η) =

1X
{Y [N − (η − Ns )s + i] − yη (i)}2
s i=1

(16)

for η = Ns + 1, ..., 2Ns and yη (i) is the polynomial that will be fitted in the segment η.
• step 4. The fluctuation function of q th order is estimated using the average of all the segments as,
Fq (s) =

(

2N
1 Xs
[Y [(η, s)]q/2
2Ns η=1

)1/q

(17)

where, q an index variable is any real valued number except zero[33].
• step 5. The scaling behaviour of fluctuation Fq (s) is calculated after analysing the log-log plots (Fq (s) with
respect to s) for a single q value and if time-series is has long range power-law correlation then Fq (s) will increase
for larger values of s following power law as,
Fq (s) ∼ sHq

(18)

The H(q) is the generalised hurst exponent and in our analysis we have calculated the H(q) by considering q from
qmin = −5 to qmax = +5. The value of H(q) changing with the change in value of q represents that our DNA walk
data multifractal nature and it is to note that if varying the value of H(q) with respect to q is constant then it
indicates that time series is monofractal in nature.
The relationship between H(q) and mass exponent is calculated for the various isolates as follows,
τ (q) = qHq − 1

(19)

Another important multifractal parameter is the singularity spectrum for characterizing a multifractal time series. It
is related to τ (q) with the Legendre transformation. α and f (α) are calculated as below,

α=

τ (q)
dq

(20)

and
f (α) = qα − τ (q)

(21)

Here, α is called the Holder exponent also called singularity strength and f (α) is the singularity spectrum and can
be simply expressed in the form of q and H(q) as the following equation[33].
α = H(q) + qH ′ (q) and f (α) = q[α − H(q)] + 1

(22)

The generalised multifractal dimension(Dq ) is another multifractal parameter and is defined as follows[33],
Dq ≡

qH(q) − 1
τ (q)
=
q−1
q−1

here, τ (q) is Mass exponent and H(q) is Hurst exponent. where, The f (α) is the subset dimension of the series
characterised by α whereas the α is called Holder exponent or singularity strength. We performed the alignment of all
the genomes and find out the point mutation present in all the isolates with respect to the reference Wuhan genome
and calculated the various multifractal parameters.
