Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and since
evolved into a global threat with nearly 4.4 million infected people and over 290,000 confirmed deaths
worldwide.1 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus presenting spike (S) glycoproteins on its outer surface.
Binding of S to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is thought to be critical for cellular
entry. The host range of the virus extends far beyond humans and non-human primates. Natural and
experimental infections have confirmed high susceptibility of cats, ferrets, and hamsters, whereas dogs,
mice, rats, pigs, and chickens seem refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate the reason for
the variable susceptibility observed in different species, we have developed molecular descriptors to
efficiently analyze our dynamic simulation models of complexes between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2.
Based on our analyses we predict that: (i) the red squirrel is likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection
and (ii) specific mutations in ACE2 of dogs, rats, and mice render them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the recent
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic.2 SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1),
which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002–2004, are different
strains of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped viruses that present characteristic spike (S) glycoproteins on the
surface of infectious virions that are essential for viral entry.3
S is a trimeric glycoprotein containing two functional subunits.4 The first subunit (S1) is responsible for
binding to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2. The second subunit (S2) is
responsible for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The S1 subunit harbors the receptorbinding domain (RBD), which is responsible for binding to host cells.3 The SARS-CoV-2 RBD forms an
antiparallel β-sheet structure, which is connected via short helices and loops.5 The contact to the host
receptor is mainly established via loops known as the receptor-binding motif (RBM, Figure 1A).
Compared to the SARS-CoV the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less restricted in its conformation,
because four of five prolines present in a loop structure essential for binding to the ACE2 protein are
replaced by more flexible residues such as glycine in the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.6
ACE2 is a membrane-bound zinc-metalloprotease expressed on the surface of cells not only in the
respiratory tract but also in the heart, arteries, kidneys, and intestines were it acts as critical player in
the endocrine renin–angiotensin system. Independent of its enzymatic function, ACE2 functions as the
cellular entry receptor for coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 S shows nanomolar binding affinity
to this cellular receptor.7 ACE2 forms a big substrate-binding cleft between the subdomains I and II.8
The SARS-CoV S binds to the ACE2 exploiting a non-competitive binding site on the outer site of
subdomain I (Figure 1A, B).
Crystal structures of the RBD of the S in complex with human ACE2 have been described for both SARSCoV 9 and SARS-CoV-2.5 The studies have shown that binding interfaces contain three homologous
binding regions (pockets) in the ACE2-RBD interface, hereinafter referred to as binding pocket A, B, and
C (Bp A, B, C). The RBD of the SARS-CoV S protein establishes hydrophobic contacts via its T487 in Bp A
to a lipophilic pocket formed by K353 and Y41 of ACE2.9 Moreover, hydrogen bonds are formed between
N479 and ACE2-residue H34 in Bp B, while lipophilic contacts are made between M82 (ACE2) and L472
in Bp C (Figure 1B).
The SARS-CoV-2 S features a binding interface consisting of three contact regions that are homologous
to SARS-CoV. The binding interface is reported5 to utilize (i) hydrogen bonds in Bp A from N501
(homologous to T487 in SARS-CoV1) to Y41 of ACE2, (ii) a hydrogen bond network via Q493
(homologous to N479 in SARS-CoV) to ACE2-residues K31, H34, E35 in Bp B, and (iii) lipophilic contacts
in Bp C via F486 (homologous to L472 in SARS-CoV) to ACE2-L79, M82, and Y83 (Figure 1A).
Recent reports confirm that in addition to primates, cats10, ferrets10, and hamsters11 are susceptible to
COVID-19 infection, but dogs, pigs, chickens10, mice, and rats11 remain unaffected. Previous studies on
SARS-CoV9 showed that differences in ACE2 sequences are responsible for the variable susceptibility
observed in different species9. Based on these observations, we chose a structural approach to
investigate how genetic diversity of ACE2 orthologs may affect the susceptibility of animal species to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. On atomistic level, we have developed dynamic computational models for ACE2RBD complexes of different species allowing us to anticipate the effects of amino acid sequence
variation of ACE2 on viral entry.

Results and Discussion
Sequence comparison of animal ACE2 does not explain differences in COVID-19 susceptibility
between investigated species.
We focused on animal species based on (i) their importance as natural reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 due
to frequent contacts with humans and (ii) availability of studies reporting susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection enabling discrimination between differences in our models. The multiple sequence alignment
of canine, feline and human ACE2 orthologs revealed that the residues reported as hotspots5, 9 (referred
to the human sequence positions 31, 34, 35, 41, 79, 82, and 83; canine positions are numbered one value
lower than other species) show polymorphic mutations H34/33Y in dog and M82/81T in dog and cat.
Since the difference in position 34/33 is present in dogs only, we searched for sequences harboring the
same polymorphism. We found that ACE2 of common ferret (Mustela pultorius) also contains a tyrosine
at this position. However, ferrets can be infected with SARS-CoV-210, which suggests that the H34Y
polymorphism does not prevent viral entry. Moreover, we compared ACE2 sequences from rodents

(mouse, rat, hamster, and red squirrel) to sample additional binding pockets in the ACE2-RBD interface
and predict susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris).
Unfortunately, no protein structures are available for animal ACE2. To compare three-dimensional
binding interfaces of animal ACE2-RBD complexes, we developed homology models of dog, cat, ferret,
hamster, mouse, rat, and red squirrel proteins. We used the previously reported x-ray crystal structure
of human ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (PDB-ID: 6M0J15) as a template. All homology models
show high quality with no major deviation in dihedral angles of the backbone (max. two Ramachandran
outliers). Both outlier residues are located on flexible loops of ACE2 distal to the S binding site and
represent polymorphic mutations from glycine in human crystal structure to serine in homology models.
All homology models show comparable flexibility in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (measured
as root mean square deviation of backbone heavy atoms) to the human enzyme in the range of 3-5 Å.
Since the homology models of animal ACE2 are based on coordinates of human ACE2 in complex with
the S RBD, we were able to superpose our models to the templates, yielding animal ACE2-SARS-CoV-2
RBD complexes. All binding interfaces of animal ACE2-S models remain in the same coordinate frame
as the template crystal structure and thus comparable.
We compared ACE2 residues with direct contact to the RBD (distance of max. 4.5 Å) in all 3D complexes
and searched for mutations possibly contributing to low SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility observed in dogs.
However, polymorphisms were present in both non-susceptible and susceptible species, which did not
explain the possibly lower affinity of RBD to dog, rat or mouse ACE2.
In the next step, we investigated dynamic properties of ACE2-RBD complexes. All structures were
simulated in five MD simulation replicas (100 ns each) showing stable binding without dissociation
events. For further analysis, we focused on three binding regions in the ACE2-RBD interface.
Hot Spot Residue F486-Binding to Bp C Depends on ‘Depth’ and Conformation of Bp C.
We discovered that the RBM shows considerably larger movements for canine and rat ACE2 complexed
with the RBD when compared to other species. We focused on the hotspot residue F486 placed on top
of RBM and occupying the lipophilic pocket (Bp C) of ACE2.
We chose the distance between the Cz-atom of F486 (position 4 on phenyl ring) and the Cb-atom of
Bp C central residue 83 (or homologous position 82 in the dog model; Figure 2) as a surrogate parameter
for F486 contacts. We observed three different states, which can be adopted by the F486-side chain: (i)
‘perfect’ fit into binding pocket (with distance of ca. 5-7 Å, ‘bound state’, Figure 2A), (ii) contact with
ACE2 outside the binding pocket preferable with lipophilic or aromatic side chain of residue 78/79 (with
distance of ca. 10-13 Å, ‘fixed state’, Figure 2B), and (iii) contact to lipophilic residues 27/28 and 78/79
with outwards rotated central Y82/83 in a ‘deformed state’ (with a distance of ca. 5-6 Å, Figure 2C). The
contribution of the ‘fixed’ and ‘deformed state’ to RBD binding is yet unclear: Careful manual analysis of
the performed MD simulations only revealed loose ACE2-RBD F486 contacts in these states, which
suggests negligible binding contributions.

From all analyzed species, cat, ferret, hamster, human, and mouse showed one or two peaks with a
narrow distance distribution around 5-7 Å suggesting frequent occupation of Bp C (Figure 3). Although
mouse ACE2 frequently occupies Bp C, we assume that weak interactions in the other two pockets (Bp A
and B) might be responsible for the low SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of mice. The simulations of rat ACE2RBD complexes shows a dominant peak at around 11 Å implying F486 conformation in the fixed state.
Canine ACE2-RBD complex simulations show three peaks suggesting transitions between bound, fixed,
and deformed F486 states. All these results (with exception of murine simulations) correlate well with
the susceptibility of the species to SARS-CoV-2.
We surmised that the conformational changes of F486 in dog and rat simulations might be caused by
either flattening or conformational deformation of Bp C. To validate this hypothesis, we calculated
distances between the Cb atom of central residue 83 (or 82 in the dog ACE2) as the deepest point of
Bp C and all side chain atoms of residues at positions 24, 79 and 82 (dog homologues 23, 78 and 81)
flanking this pocket. We plotted the occurrence of the shortest distance per frame (SDpF) for each
residue (Figure 4). From all three descriptors, SDpF between residues 83-79 (or 82-78 in dog) correlate
well with Bp C occupation in rat ACE2. The residue 83-79 SDpF average of rat (7.1 Å) is the lowest
distance in comparison with other species, which indicates a flatter Bp C. This would result in a
suboptimal fit into the binding pocket and entails unbinding events of residue F486. MD simulations
revealed that the polymorphism I79L (rat – all other species) might be responsible for the narrowing of
rat Bp C. We observed that the methyl group of I79 restricts the Bp C and hinders fitting of F486.
The canine ACE2 shows a broad SDpF distribution between residue 82-78 with a minimal distance of
6 Å, which is comparable to rat simulations. However, this state is less frequent in canine simulations.
Additional χ1 angle measurements of epitope 83/82 show that this residue rotates out of Bp C, which
causes a deformation of the binding pocket in canine ACE2. We chose the distance between Cb atoms
of residues 83 and 28 (or 82 and 27 in dog) localized in the upper and lower helix, respectively, forming
Bp C (Figure 4, last panel). We surmised that the higher distance causes a larger shift between both
helices and the resulting deformation of Bp C. In this state, the central residue Y83/82 can only establish
weak interaction with F486. As expected, only canine ACE2-RBD simulations show higher distances than
9 Å for the Y83/82-F486 distance, which altogether suggests weak interactions. MD simulations
revealed that the polymorphism V24/25A (dog – all other species) might be responsible for the outward
rotation of canine Y82. The larger and more rigid V24 pushes Y82 out of Bp C and towards the Nterminus.
Subsequently, we analyzed the differences in distribution of residue 83-82 SDpF (or 82-81 SDpF in dog).
Hamster, human, and rat show remarkably denser distance distributions (at approximately 5.5 Å) than
other species. The sequence comparison shows that the three species express a long and non-branched
side chain residue (asparagine in hamster and rat, methionine in human) at position 82 (dog 81). These
amino acids might stabilize F486 in the ‘bound state’ with Bp C by steric effects. The most favorable
residue at position 82/81 for binding F486 seems to be the methionine present in human ACE2, which
also increases lipophilic contacts at this position.

Mouse Mutation E/D30N and K31N in Bp B Disrupts Hydrogen Bond Network and Salt Bridges Found
in Other Species
Due to contradictory findings in murine Bp C models, we surmise that the low SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility
observed in mice might be caused by unfavorable or less frequent interactions in Bp B and/or A. Hence,
we searched for polymorphisms exclusively occurring in the mouse ACE2 sequence. We found two
mutations in murine Bp B (E/D30N and K31N), which are surrounded by charged amino acids. Both
mutations replace a charged with a neutral residue, suggesting that RBD stabilizing salt bridges cannot
be formed. Further analysis of MD trajectories of susceptible species led us to the hypothesis that (i)
residue E/D30 can interact with K417 of RBD and (ii) K31 interacts with E35 within the same helix of
ACE2 introducing stable amino acid pairs coordinated by viral residue Q493. Our hypothesis is
supported by distance (SDpF) measurements between residues 30 (ACE2) - 417 (RBD) (Figure 5) and
31 (ACE2) - 35 (ACE2) / 31 (ACE2) - 493 (RBD) (Figure 6).

Simulations of the murine protein complex show a considerably greater distance between residues N31,
E35 and Q493 compared to other species (6 versus 3 Å). This indicates disruption of the hydrogen bond
network in Bp B. Similarly, the mutation E/D30N occurring in mouse and rat breaks a salt bridge to K417
of RBD and the main distance peak occurs at 5-7 Å (in contrast to other species showing close contacts
at ca. 3 Å). Due to larger distances for mouse and rat residues to RBD, water might invade the binding
pocket resulting in lower S-protein RBD affinity to murine ACE2.

Figure 5. Shortest Distance per Frame (SDpF) between Nz atom of RBD K417 and side chain of ACE2 residue 30
(or 29 for dog) as surrogate parameter for interactions between these residues in the Binding pocket B for wild type
ACE2.

In addition, we found that a serine residue occurs at position 27 in rat ACE2 while more lipophilic
threonine epitopes are found in other species. Since residue 27 is surrounded by lipophilic residues of
the RBD (F456 and Y489), we surmise that the T27S polymorphism in rat might contribute to less
favorable interactions in Bp B.
Position 353 Regulates Hydrogen Bonding in Bp A and Explains Rat/Mouse Difference
To our knowledge, the role of residues involved in interactions within Bp A could not be clarified so far.6
We therefore compared the ACE2 sequence of rat and mouse with other species and identified the
mutation K353H as relevant difference. Inspecting MD trajectories of rodent ACE2-RBD complexes, we
observed that a lysine side chain in hamster ACE2 establishes a salt bridge to D38. Similar to the residue
pair K31-E35 in the Bp B, which is coordinated by viral residue Q493, the pair K353-D38 interacts with
RBD residue Q498. This region of Bp A is surrounded by a hydrogen bond network comprised of ACE2
residues 37, 41, 42, 355 and RBD residues 449, 496, 500, 501, 505. We assume that, according to the Oring theory12, this hydrogen bond network ‘seals’ the hotspot K353/D38 (ACE2) - Q498 (RBD) and
prevents water from invading the protein-protein interface. The histidine at position 353 in mouse and
rat decreases the average number of hydrogen bonds established in the Bp A (7 in hamster versus 3 or
4 in rat or mouse, respectively; Figure 7).
Since histidine is less basic than a lysine, the formation of a salt bridge to D38 is less likely. MD
simulations show that the histidine residue is too short to establish hydrogen bonds with D38 (ACE2) or
Q498 (RBD). D38 can rotate out of the Bp A and water can reach the binding site, which results in less
frequent interactions between the two proteins. This could explain why the RBD shows lower affinity to
mouse and rat ACE2.

Analysis of Squirrel ACE2 Suggests High Chance of Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
Red squirrels can be broadly found in urban environments in Europe. We therefore strived to predict
squirrel ACE2 binding to S from SARS-CoV-2 since no information about susceptibility of the red squirrel
to SARS-CoV-2 has been published yet. We prepared a red squirrel ACE2-RBD complex similarly to other
species and conducted the workflow described above; (i) the depth parameters (83-79-SDpF) and
occupancy of Bp C by RBD F486, (ii) distance plots between residues 30 (ACE2) - 417 (RBD) and 31
(ACE2) - 35 (ACE2) / 31 (ACE2) - 493 (RBD) in Bp B and (iii) H-Bond counts for Bp A show similar values
to that registered in human ACE2-RBD complexes (Figure 8). Our analyses of Bp A-C indicate red squirrel
is highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Prediction of Gain-of-function Mutations
Based on our descriptors and sequence comparisons, we suggest mutations contributing to
SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in unaffected species (Table 1). We have investigated some of these mutants
in-silico with dynamic models.
In a first step, we mutated residue 24 of canine ACE2 from valine to alanine. This polymorphism should
prevent the rotation of Y82 and corresponding of Bp C. The V24A mutant showed the predicted effect
(Figure 9). In the 82-78-SDpF torsion diagram of mutated ACE2, the additional peak associated to
deformation cannot be observed, which is comparable to feline RBD binding. Moreover, we surmise that
mutation T81M in dogs increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in a fashion that is similar to that
conferred by human ACE2.

of the Bp C based on the SDpF-83-79 (Shortest Distance per Frame) parameter.

To test the hypothesis of narrowing the Bp C by branched side chains at position 79, we prepared and
simulated an I79L mutant of rat ACE2. This mutation clearly increased Bp C occupancy and showed
wide opening of Bp C (Figure 10), which supported our hypothesis.
We further suggest to mutate rat and mouse ACE2 in Bp A and B to stabilize RBD binding. In Bp B,
mutating positions 30 and 31 from neutral amino acids back to charged ones, as is the case in hamster
ACE2, might increase SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of rat and mouse. Similarly, the mutation H353K in rat
and mouse ACE2 Bp A should result in a hydrogen bond network comparable to hamster protein and
therefore enhancing the RBD binding.

Conclusion
We present mechanistic, dynamic models on atomistic level to understand of the ACE2/SARS-CoV-2
interaction in different animal species that might serve as natural reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 due to
frequent contacts with humans. In addition to previous studies13, we present extensive molecular
dynamics simulations that rationalize RBD binding to ACE2. Based on known susceptibility of animal
species to SARS-CoV-2 and the comparison of MD trajectories, we were able to develop models for
prediction of RBD binding to ACE2. Hence, we propose gain-of-function mutations for non-susceptible
species (dog, rat and mouse) as validation for our model and predict that the red squirrel has a high
chance to get infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Homology Modeling and ACE2-Spike Models
Homology and loop models were prepared using MOE 2019. [Chemical Computing Group, Montreal,
Canada] The models were constructed using GB/VI scoring14 with a maximum of ten main chain
models. ACE2 models of cat, dog and ferret were prepared using human ACE2 bound to RBD of SARSCoV-2 (PDB-ID: 6M0J5) as template. ACE2-S complex models were prepared via superposition of
receptor homology models on template crystal structure and removing human protein. The catalytic
center as well as clashing side chains in binding interface were adjusted using rotamere tool and OPLSAA force field15 in MOE.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
All systems (including substrate- and hit-protease complexes) were prepared in MOE 2019 by
protonation (at 300 K and pH of 7) and capping protease termini. ACE2-RBD-complex simulations were
prepared with Maestro 11.7 [Schrödinger, LLC: New York, USA] and carried out with Desmond 5.5. 16 All
systems were inspected for atom clashes, optimized for H-bonds, filled in 12 Å large padding box with
SCP water model17, sodium chloride 0.15 M and sodium ions to keep isotonic and electrostatic neutral
conditions. The simulations were performed under default minimizing protocol and periodic boundary
conditions over 100 ns resulting in 2000 frames each simulation. For visual inspection, all trajectories
were wrapped and aligned on backbone Cα atoms of ACE2-RBD-complex and first simulation frame
using VMD 1.9.3.18
Trajectory Analysis
Initially, trajectories were analyzed visually to find possible differences in dynamic complexes, such as
backbone movements. Further analysis was performed with Python 3.719 using MDAnalysis 0.19.3 for
the extraction of distances, angles, and hydrogen bonds from trajectories after an equilibration period
of 10 ns (resulting in 1800 complex conformations per replicon). Data processing and transformation
was done with pandas 0.25.3.20 Plots were created with seaborn 0.9.0.21 and matplotlib 3.1.1.22
