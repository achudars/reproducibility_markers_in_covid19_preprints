Abstract
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing explosive epidemic of COVID19 disease has
generated a need for assays to rapidly and conveniently measure the antiviral activity of SARSCoV-2-specific antibodies. Here, we describe a collection of approaches based on SARS-CoV-2
spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1
(HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARSCoV-2 chimeric virus. While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity
with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both convalescent
plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus correlated quantitatively
with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The
assays described herein are adaptable to high throughput and are useful tools in the evaluation
of serologic immunity conferred by vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the
potency of convalescent plasma or human monoclonal antibodies.

Introduction
The emergence of a new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in late 2019 has sparked an
explosive global pandemic of COVID19 disease, with many millions of infections and hundreds
of thousands of deaths (as of early June, 2020). The socioeconomic impact of the COVID19
pandemic has also been profound, with the mobility and productivity of a large fraction of the
world’s population dramatically curtailed.
Human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the other severe epidemic coronaviruses
(MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV), and the mild the seasonal coronaviruses, all elicit neutralizing
antibodies (Kellam and Barclay, 2020). These antibodies likely provide at least some degree of
protection against reinfection. However, in the case of the seasonal coronaviruses,
epidemiological and human challenge experiments indicate that protection is incomplete and
diminishes with time, concurrent with declining neutralizing antibody titers (Callow et al., 1990;
Kiyuka et al., 2018). The neutralizing antibody response to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is highly
variable (Alshukairi et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2007; Choe et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2006; Mo et al.,
2006; Okba et al., 2019; Payne et al., 2016), and because human infection by these viruses is
rare (MERS-CoV) or apparently absent (SARS-CoV), the extent to which prior infection elicits
durable protection against reinfection is unknown. For SARS-CoV-2, early studies, including our
own, indicate that the magnitude of antibody responses is extremely variable, and a significant
fraction of convalescents have comparatively low to undetectable levels of plasma neutralizing
antibodies (Robbiani et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). Thus, the effectiveness and durability of
immunity conferred by primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, particularly in those who
mount weaker immune response and is obviously a pressing issue, given the global spread of
this virus. Moreover, because treatment and prevention modalities for SARS-CoV-2 are urgently
sought, convalescent plasma is being evaluated for COVID19 therapy and prophylaxis (Bloch et
al., 2020). Clearly, the effectiveness of such an intervention is likely to be profoundly impacted
by the levels of neutralizing antibodies in donated convalescent plasma.

Effective vaccination and administration of cloned human monoclonal antibodies may be
more successful than prior natural infection and convalescent plasma in providing antibodybased protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, recent work from our own laboratories
and others has shown that closely related, highly potent, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) can be isolated from multiple
convalescent donors (Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; Chi et al.,
2020; Ju et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Shi et al.,
2020; Wec et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Zost et al., 2020). Potent antibodies can be isolated
from individuals with high or unexceptional plasma neutralizing titers, suggesting that natural
infection in some individuals does not induce sufficient B-cell expansion and maturation to
generate high levels of such antibodies (Robbiani et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). However,
these findings suggest that such antibodies might be straightforwardly elicited by vaccination.
Whether elicited by natural infection or vaccination, or administered as convalescent
plasma or in recombinant form, neutralizing antibodies will likely be crucial for curtailing the
global burden of COVID19 disease. For this reason, the availability of rapid, convenient and
accurate assays that measure neutralizing antibody activity is crucial for evaluating naturally
acquired or artificially induced immunity. Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using
traditional plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) is labor intensive, requires biosafety
level (BSL)-3 laboratory facilites and is not amenable to high throughput. Thus, various assays
based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or human immunodeficiency virus type -1 (HIV-1)
virions, pseudotyped with the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are high-throughput and
can executed at BSL-2 will be essential to evaluate neutralization activity. These pseudotype
virus assays offer numerous advantages (Crawford et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020), but their ability
to predict plasma neutralization activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2, or correctly identify the
most potent human monoclonal antibodies has not been rigorously evaluated.

Herein, we describe assays based on pseudotyped and chimeric viruses that our
laboratories have used to measure the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma and to
identify potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These assays
are rapid and convenient. Using a panel of convalescent plasma and human RBD-specific
monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrate that these assays provide measurements of virus
neutralization that are well correlated with a neutralizing antibody test employing authentic
SARS-CoV-2 virions. As such, these tools are useful to estimate SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the
context of recovery from infection, in experimental vaccine recipients and to evaluate the
potency of antibody-based therapy and prophylaxis

Results
HIV-1-based SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virions
To generate SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 particles, we constructed a replication
defective HIV-1 proviral plasmid (pHIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc Fig. 1A) that lacks a functional viral
env gene, and contains sequences encoding a NanoLuc luciferase protein in place of the nef
gene. This proviral construct is similar to the widely used pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- proviral reporter
plasmid (Connor et al., 1995), but NanoLuc luciferase yields ~100-fold brighter luminescence
than firefly luciferase, facilitating the detection of small numbers of infected cells. Indeed, we
estimate that single infection events can be detected in a 96-well assay format (see below).
Because some localities require that two-plasmid HIV-1-based pseudotyped viruses be
used in BSL2+ or BSL3 laboratories, we also developed HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses using a
three-plasmid approach in which the packaged viral-vector genome and GagPol expression
functions are installed on separate plasmids (Fig. 1B). We also constructed a packageable HIV1 vector (pCCNanoLuc/GFP) that encodes both a NanoLuc luciferase reporter and a GFP
reporter (Fig. 1B). This 3-plasmid format recapitulates that used in commonly used lentivirus

vector procedures, except that the conventionally used VSV-G envelope expression plasmid is
omitted. Instead, for both the two-plasmid (HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc) and three-plasmid
(CCNanoLuc/GFP) HIV-1 pseudotype formats, we constructed plasmids encoding codonoptimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins (Fig. 1A, B). We also generated several 293T and
HT1080 derived cell lines expressing the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (Li et al.,
2003), of which several populations and clones expressing varying levels of ACE2 were used
herein (Fig. S1 A,B).
Incorporation of envelope or spike proteins into heterologous viral particles is
unpredictable. Indeed, even minor alterations to the cytoplasmic tail of the HIV-1 Env protein
can block its incorporation into homologous HIV-1 particles (Murakami and Freed, 2000). For
this reason, we compared infection using CCNanoLuc/GFP particles pseudodotyped with either
the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or derivatives with either 18 or 19 amino acids
truncated from the C-terminus. While the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein supported the
generation of infectious virions that gave a luminescence signal higher than that of virions
lacking S, both the Δ18 and Δ19 truncated forms generated ~10-fold higher titers of infectious
particles than the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. S1C). Thus, the Δ19 variant of SARSCoV-2 was used hereafter unless otherwise indicated. Similarly, the SARS-CoV S protein
generated infectious virions, but higher infectious titers were obtained when a Δ18 and Δ19
truncated SARS-CoV S protein was used (Fig. S1C).
Both the two-plasmid (HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc) and three-plasmid (pCCNanoLuc/GFP)
derived SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses infected ACE2-expressing 293T and HT1080 cells,
yielding a strong luminescence signal of up to 107 to108 relative light units (RLU), while
unmanipulated parental cell lines were infected poorly (293T), or not at all (HT1080) (Fig 1C, D,
Fig S1D, E). A cell line (Huh7.5) that endogenously expresses ACE2 was also infected by both
HIV-1 SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes, although the luminescent signal was not as high as in the
engineered 293T/ACE2 or HT1080/ACE2 cell lines (Fig. 1 C, D). The SARS-CoV-2

pseudotyped HIV-1 virions could be concentrated by ultracentrifugation and without loss of titer
and without effects on the background level of NanoLuc luciferase (Fig. S1F).
Examination of the panel of ACE2-expressing 293T derived cell lines revealed that the
level of infection appeared dependent on the level of ACE2 expression (Fig S1A, S2A, S2B).
Conversely, the level of infection was not dramatically affected by varying the amount of cotransfected pSARS-CoV-2-SΔ19 during pseudotyped virus production (Fig S2C).
A common misconception is that the maximum dynamic range of infection assays
measured via expression of a viral genome-encoded luciferase reporter (such as those
described herein) is the same as the dynamic range of the luciferase assay. The ability to count
the number of CCNanoLuc/GFP infected cells (by flow cytometry) and measure NanoLuc
luciferase activity in replicate wells (Fig. 1E), afforded the ability to readily determine the
average NanoLuc luciferase activity generated by a single CCNanoLuc/GFP infectious unit. This
calculation led to the conclusion that a single infectious unit of CNanoLuc/GFP pseudotyped
virus generated an average of approximately 1.2 x 104 RLU in infected 293T/ACE2*(B) cells. A
second estimate, based on immunofluorescent detection of HIV-1 Gag expressed in
293T/ACE2(B) cells following infection with the HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc/SARS-CoV-2
pseudotype (Fig. S2D) suggested that single infected cells generate approximately 5 x 103 RLU.
Given that the highest signals generated in the NanoLuc luciferase assays following infection
with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc or CNanoLuc/GFP are between 107 and
108 RLU (depending on the target cell line, Fig 1C, D, Fig S1C-E), this value is commensurate
with the observation that ~10% or greater of the 104 cells plated in each well became infected
(Fig. S2A). Thus, the dynamic range of these HIV-1 pseudotype infection assays, formatted in
96-well plates, is between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude, depending on the amount of
pseudotyped virus and the particular target cell line used. This dynamic range is more than
adequate for accurate determinations of plasma neutralizing activity as well as determination of

potency (IC50 and IC90) of monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Sdependent viral entry.

VSV-based SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped virions
Another commonly used platform for evaluation of virus envelope or spike protein
function is based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking a G protein (VSVΔG) (Whitt, 2010).
This approach is possible because VSVΔG can replicate well when complemented in trans by
either its own envelope (G) protein or (sometimes) by a heterologous viral glycoprotein. We
constructed a VSVΔG genome that contained a dual reporter (mNeonGreen and NanoLuc
luciferase) termed rVSVΔG/NG-NanoLuc (Fig. 2A). The dual reporter enabled infection by
rVSVΔG/NG-NanoLuc pseudotype to be monitored by imaging (Fig S3A), flow cytometry or
NanoLuc luciferase assay (Fig. 2B). An advantage of VSV pseudotypes over their HIV-1
counterparts is that the rapid intracellular replication of the VSV genome enables robust reporter
gene expression to be detected within a few hours after infection (Fig 2C Fig S3B). To maximize
signal over background, we used an overnight 16h infection protocol, unless otherwise stated.
Like HIV-1 pseudotypes, the rVSVΔG/NG-NanoLuc pseudotypes selectively infected ACE2
expressing 293T and HT1080 cells, although unmodified 293T cells also exhibited low level
susceptibility (Fig. 2D, Fig. S3C, D). As was the case with HIV-1 pseudotypes, the level of
rVSVΔG/NG-NanoLuc/SARS-CoV-2 infection was dependent on the level of ACE2 expression
(Fig. S3E), although the levels of endogenously expressed ACE2 in Huh7.5 cells and Vero E6
cells were sufficient to give a robust signal (Fig. 2D). Indeed, we used Huh7.5 cells hereafter,
unless otherwise indicated
A disadvantage of the NanoLuc luciferase reporter, is that this protein is highly stable,
more so than other luciferases. Because rVSVΔG replication is quite cytopathic, pseudotype
virion preparations were contaminated with NanoLuc luciferase protein, which elevated the
assay background. However, this problem could be relieved by pelleting virions by

ultracentrifugation through sucrose, or concentration using Lenti-X (Fig S3F). Indeed, counting
of mNeonGreen infected cells and luciferase quantitation (Fig 2B, Fig S3A) revealed that
individual infected Huh7.5 cells yielded ~6x103 RLU per infected cell. Thus, like the HIV-1-based
assay, the rVSVΔG/NG-NanoLuc/SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infection assay had a dynamic
range of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, when formatted in 96-well plates.

Construction of a replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV2 chimeric virus
The aforementioned assays both employ single-cycle, replication-defective constructs
and do not allow for any viral spread in the presence of antibody. This feature could impact the
sensitivity with which neutralizing activity is detected (see discussion). To construct a replication
competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimera, we inserted sequences encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein lacking the C-terminal 18 codons into a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
background that contains green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA between the inserted S
sequence and the L (polymerase) gene. Thus, in this construct, the SARS-CoV-2 S replaces the
native VSV-G protein (Fig. 3A). The recombinant virus was rescued in 293T cells by coexpressing T7 polymerase and complementing VSV proteins. The rescued virus was passaged
once in 293T cells transfected with a VSV-G-expression plasmid to facilitate initial virus
amplification. Since G is not encoded in the recombinant virus genome, subsequent rounds of
infection were dependent on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Thus, thereafter the complemented
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP virus was used to infect 293T/ACE2(B) cells (in the absence of the
complementing VSV-G protein) and infection monitored by observation of GFP expression.
Initially, the rescued rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 replicated poorly – several days were required for the
majority of the cells in the culture to become infected (GFP-positive). Supernatant (500 μl/75cm2
flask) from these infected 293T/ACE2(B) cells was used to infect fresh 293T/ACE2(B) cells, and
this process was repeated for three additional passages. After three passages, accelerated
replication was clearly observed. Specifically, all cells in a 75cm2 flask became GFP-positive

within 24 h of inoculation with 100 μl of supernatant from the previous passage. Thereafter,
individual viral variants were isolated by limiting dilution in 96-well plates containing
293T/ACE2(B) cells. Cells and supernatant were harvested from two wells that each contained
one individual GFP-positive plaque (signifying infection by single viruses) and designated
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1.
The adapted rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 both grew
rapidly and achieved titers of between 1x107 and 1x108 plaque forming units/ml following
replication for 36-48h in 293T/ACE2(B) or 293T/ACE2cl.22 cells. (Fig 3B, C). We extracted RNA
from the supernatant of cells infected each of these viruses and determined the nucleotide
sequence of the introduced SARS-CoV-2 spike cDNA and flanking regions. The S proteins were
each found to encode two nonsynonymous changes: rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 encoded
F157S and R685M mutations, while rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 encoded D215G and R683G
mutations (Fig. 3D). Notably, R685M and R683G both alter the putative furin-like protease
cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Other isolated plaques whose SARS-CoV-2 Sencoding regions were sequenced, but were not further investigated, also contained furin
cleavage site mutations (R682G or R685K) suggesting that modification of the furin cleavage
site is a key adaptation for high-level rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 replication in 293T/ACE2 cells.

Neutralization of pseudotyped HIV-1 and VSV, chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 and authentic
SARS-CoV-2 by antibodies.
Because infection by the aforementioned viruses is dependent on SARS-CoV-2 S and
ACE2 proteins, these assays should be good surrogates for the measurement of the SARSCoV-2 neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma or candidate therapeutic/prophylactic
monoclonal antibodies. Indeed, we have made extensive use of HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc virions
to measure levels of neutralizing activity in plasma of COVID19 patients, and to identify potent
human monoclonal antibodies (Robbiani et al., 2020). Notably, the use of dual GFP and

NanoLuc reporters in pseudotyped viral genomes provides for a rapid and flexible assessment
of neutralizing activity, that can be assessed quantitively either microscopically or by flow
cytometry and NanoLuc luciferase assays, which can be used interchangeably (Fig S4A, B, C).
To compare the neutralization properties of the aforementioned pseudotyped and
chimeric viruses with authentic SARS-CoV-2, we used an antibody staining-based SARS-CoV-2
infection assay to quantify the numbers SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in 96-well plates. Twenty
convalescent plasma samples that displayed a range of neutralization activities against
authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4A) were also evaluated in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc and rVSVΔG/NG-NanoLuc as well as in replication competent VSV/SARSCoV-2 neutralization assays (Fig 4B). Despite the fact that these neutralization assays have
quite different dynamic ranges, employ different virion scaffolds and target cell lines, and involve
single-cycle replication-defective or multi-cycle replication-competent viruses, the plasma
neutralization titers obtained with the surrogate virus approaches were each well correlated with
titers obtained using authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4C). Notably, the HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc and
rVSVΔG/NG-NanoLuc pseudotyped viruses gave NT50 values that indicated marginally reduced
sensitivity to plasma antibodies as compared to authentic SARS-CoV-2, with the rVSVΔG/NGNanoLuc appearing to more sensitively detect weak plasma neutralizing activity (Fig 4C) than
HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc. Conversely, the replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 was more
sensitive to plasma neutralization than authentic SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, each of the
surrogate viruses was able to provide a good indication of plasma neutralizing potency against
authentic SARS-CoV-2
Next, we evaluated 15 human monoclonal antibodies that were identified by sorting of
individual SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding B-cells (Robbiani et al., 2020). The panel was selected on
the basis of neutralization potency using the HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc assay, and all had IC50
values ranging between 3ng/ml and 60ng/ml in this assay. These antibodies all potently
neutralized SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 5A), as well as the HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc and rVSVΔG/NG-

NanoLuc pseudotyped viruses and the replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Fig
5B). Each of the surrogate viruses gave IC50 values for the antibody panel that correlated well
with IC50 values measured using authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, among the
surrogate viruses, the two VSV-based viruses were the most different in terms of relative
sensitivity to the monoclonal antibody panel. Specifically, while there was a good linear
relationship between the IC50 values measured using SARS-CoV-2 and the rVSVΔG/NGNanoLuc pseudotype virus, the latter was generally less sensitive to neutralization (Fig. 5C).
The replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP virus appeared to most accurately predict the
IC50 values of the monoclonal antibodies against authentic SARS-CoV-2, despite the fact that,
unlike the pseudotyped viruses, its S protein encoded adaptive changes that arose during
adaptation (Fig 3D). Importantly however, the most potent monoclonal antibodies had IC50
values of less than 10ng/ml, measured using all four viruses, indicating that each surrogate
virus could correctly identify the most potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies.

Discussion
Herein, we describe pseudotyped and chimeric viruses that can evaluate the neutralizing
activity of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific monoclonal antibodies as well as convalescent sera or
plasma. Many factors could, in principle, affect the apparent potency of neutralizing antibodies
as measured using surrogate viruses. One key factor may be the density of spikes on the virion
envelope. Spike density could affect the avidity of bivalent antibodies, particularly those that are
unable to engage two S-protein monomers within a single trimer and whose potency is
dependent on engaging two adjacent trimers {Barnes, 2020 #41}(Galimidi et al., 2015). Electron
microscopic images of coronaviruses indicate a fairly high spike density, and the extent to which
pseudotyped viruses mimic this property might be important for determining the accuracy of
neutralization assays. Notably, we found that truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV-2
dramatically increased the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes, likely by facilitiating

incorporation of S protein into virions. During virion assembly SARS-CoV-2 buds into secretory
compartments (Stertz et al., 2007), while HIV-1 and VSV assemble at the cell surface (Jouvenet
et al., 2006). Truncation of the S protein cytoplasmic tail may increase cell surface levels, and/or
enable incorporation by alleviating structural incompatibility of the S protein cytoplasmic tail and
HIV-1 or VSV matrix proteins.
To the extent that RBD-specific antibodies may compete with target cell surface ACE2
for binding to virion spikes, the density of ACE2 molecules on the target cell surface could
additionally affect antibody potency in neutralization assays. Moreover, the use of replication
competent, multicycle replication-based assays, versus single-cycle infection with defective
reporter viruses could additionally affect apparent neutralizing antibody potency. Partial
neutralization at marginal antibody concentrations in a single replication cycle might be
amplified over multiple rounds of replication. Alternatively, the increase in viral dose during
multiple replication cycles, or the high multiplicity associated with direct cell-to-cell viral spread
might overwhelm neutralizing antibodies at marginal dilutions in multi-cycle neutralization
assays. Such a scenario would reduce apparent antibody potency compared to single-cycle
assays. Finally, viruses may also generate defective or noninfectious particles to varying
degrees which could sequester neutralizing antibodies and therefore affect neutralization
potency. Despite the very different nature of the assays employed herein, as well as their
different dynamic ranges, each of the surrogate virus-based assays generated quantitative
measurements of neutralizing activity that correlated well with neutralization measured using
authentic SARS-CoV-2. Naturally, the above considerations mean that these correlations are
not precise; for example, both HIV-1 and VSV-based pseudotyped viruses were somewhat less
sensitive to neutralization than authentic SARS-CoV-2, particularly by weakly neutralizing
plasma. This finding may be because they are single-cycle assays, or perhaps because
pseudotyped virions may have lower spike density than SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to replication-defective single-cycle pseudotyped viruses we also developed a
replication competent rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric virus. Notably, adaptation of
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP in 293T/ACE2 cells led to the acquisition of mutations at the S protein
furin cleavage site. Adaptation of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP in different target cells, that express
different furin-like or other proteases may result in the acquisition of alternative adaptive
mutations. Crucially, the sensitivity of the adapted rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP to neutralization by
monoclonal antibodies mimicked that of authentic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the rVSV/SARSCoV-2/GFP appeared slightly more susceptible to plasma neutralization than SARS-CoV-2, for
unknown reasons. Given that the design of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP is similar to that of the
successful VSV/EboV ebolavirus vaccine, derivatives of the adapted 1D7 or 2E1 viruses could
potentially be vaccine candidates. Additionally, these viruses could also be used in laboratory
selection experiments to identify mutations that enable escape from inhibition by antibodies or
other therapeutic agents that target the spike protein.
Some of the pseudotype neutralization assays described herein can be executed in a
standard BSL-2 laboratory. Indeed, we have used the HIV-1 and VSV pseudotype approaches
to conduct determine the neutralizing potencies of hundreds of plasma samples and monoclonal
antibodies in a BSL-2 laboratory in a few weeks. Automation and additional miniaturization is
certainly feasible to further increase throughput – a notable consideration given the sheer
number of vaccine candidates in the development pipeline (Chen et al., 2020a). We note
however, that miniaturization reduces the number of infected cells and the dynamic range of
neutralization assays. We also note that the HT1080/ACE2cl.14 and Huh7.5 cell lines are
significantly more adherent than 293T-derived cell lines and are recommended (for HIV-1 and
VSV pseudotype assays, respectively) in high throughput situations, as great care is necessary
when using 293T-derived cells whose adhesive properties during washing steps are suboptimal.
A key caveat associated with the measurement of neutralizing antibody activity, whether
using pseudotype assays or authentic SARS-CoV-2 virions, is that the level of neutralizing

activity required to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a natural situation is unknown
(Kellam and Barclay, 2020). Moreover, while neutralization assays measure the ability of
antibodies to inhibit viral entry, they do not capture features of the antiviral activity of antibodies
such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity that may be germane in vivo (Bournazos and
Ravetch, 2017). Nevertheless, in vitro neutralizing activity has long been identified as a
correlate of protection against infection in many viral infections (Plotkin, 2010), including
coronaviruses (Kellam and Barclay, 2020). As such, we envisage that the techniques described
herein might be of significant utility in curtailing the COVID19 pandemic.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid constructs
The env-inactivated HIV-1 reporter construct pHIV-1NL4-3 ΔEnv-NanoLuc was generated
from pNL4-3 (Adachi et al., 1986). The human codon-optimized NanoLuc Luciferase reporter
gene (Nluc, Promega) was inserted in place of nucleotides 1-100 of the nef-gene. Thereafter a
940 bp deletion and frameshift was introduced into env, immediately 3’ to the vpu stop-codon,
The pHIV-1NLGagPol has previously been described.
The pCCNG/nLuc was construct was derived from pCSGW by inserting a CMV promoter in
place of the native SFFV promoter. Thereafter, a NanoLuc-(FMDV2A)-EGFP cassette was
inserted 3’ to the CMV promoter.
The rVSVΔG/NG/NanoLuc plasmid was derived from rVSVΔG (Kerafast)
(PMID: 20709108). A cassette containing an mNeonGreen/FMDV2A/NanoLuc luciferase cDNA
was generated by overlap extension PCR and inserted between the M and L genes, maintaining
the intergenic VSV sequences required for gene expression.
Two pSARS-CoV-2 protein expression plasmids containing a C-terminally truncated
SARS-CoV-2 S protein (pSARS-CoV-2Δ19) were generated. One was derived by insertion of a
synthetic human-codon optimized cDNA (Geneart) encoding SARS-CoV-2 S lacking the C-

terminal 19 codons into pCR3.1. A second construct was derived from a codon-optimized
plasmid (SinoBiological) behaved identically in our assays and were used interchangeably.
To construct a replication competent rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus clone, a codonoptimized cDNA sequence encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SinoBiological) but lacking
the C-terminal 18 codons was inserted, using Gibson cloning, into a recombinant VSV
background that contains GFP immediately upstream of the L (polymerase) following a strategy
we previously described for the exchange of VSV-G with HIV-1 Env proteins (Liberatore et al.,
2019).
An ACE2 lentivirus expression CS(ACE2)IB vector was constructed by inserting a cDNA
encoding an unaltered ACE2 (Addgene:1786) or an catalytically inactive ACE2 mutant (ACE2H374N&H378N) into the lentivirus expression vector CSIB (Kane et al., 2018). In this vector,
expression of the inserted cDNA is driven by a an SSFV promoter and is linked to an IRESblasticidin.

Cell lines
HEK-293T cells, HT1080 cells, Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells (H. sapiens) and VeroE6 kidney
epithelial cells (Chlorocebus sabaeus) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) at 37oC and 5% CO2. All cell lines have been tested negative for contamination with
mycoplasma and were obtained from the ATCC (with the exception of Huh-7.5). Derivatives of
293T and HT1080 cells expressing ACE2 or ACE2* (a catalytically inactive mutant of ACE2)
were generated by transducing 293T cells with CSIB(ACE2) or CSIB(ACE2*), respectively.
Cells were used as an uncloned bulk populations (designated (B)): 293T/ACE2*(B) and
293T/ACE2(B). Alternatively, single cell clones (cl.) were derived by limiting dilution from the

293T/ACE2cl.22 and HT1080/ACE2cl.14

Two-plasmid-based (HIV/NanoLuc)-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles
To generate (HIV/NanoLuc) SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles, 5x106 293T cells were
plated per 10 cm dish in 10ml in growth medium. The following day, 7.5 µg of pHIV-1NL4-3 ΔEnvNanoLuc reporter virus plasmid and 2.5 µg of a SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV plasmid (unless
otherwise indicated pSARS-CoV-2-SΔ19 was used) were mixed mix thoroughly with 500 µl
serum-free DMEM (this represents a molar plasmid ratio of 1:0.55). Then, 44 µl
polyethylenimine (PEI, 1 mg/ml) was diluted in 500 µl serum free DMEM and mixed thoroughly.
To generate control virus lacking S, the S expression plasmid was omitted from the
transfection and PEI amount was reduced to 30 µl. The diluted DNA and PEI were then mixed
thoroughly by pipetting or vortexing, incubated at 20 min at RT and added dropwise to the 293T
cells. After 8h or overnight incubation, the transfected cells are washed carefully twice with PBS
and incubated in 10ml DMEM++. At 48h after transfection, the 10ml supernatant was harvested,
clarified by centrifugation at 300xg for 5 min and passed through a 0.22 µm pore size PVDF
syringe filter (e.g. SLGVR33RS, Millipore), aliquoted and frozen at -80oC

Three-plasmid-based (HIV-1/NG/NanoLuc)-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles
To generate (HIV-1/NanoLuc2AEGFP)-SARS-CoV-2 particles, 3 plasmids were used,
with the reporter vector (pCCNanoLuc2AEGFP) and HIV-1 structural/regulatory proteins
(pHIVNLGagPol) provided by separate plasmids. Specifically, 293T cells were transfected as
described above, with 7 µg pHIVNLGagPol, 7 µg pCCNanoLuc2AEGFP and 2.5 µg 2.5 µg of a
SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV plasmid (unless otherwise indicated pSARS-CoV-2-SΔ19 was used,
at a molar plasmid ratio of 1:1:0.45) using 66 µl PEI. To generate control virus lacking the S
expression plasmid was omitted from the transfection and PEI amount was reduced to 56µl. At

48h after transfection, the 10ml supernatant was harvested, clarified, filtered and stored as
described above

Recombinant VSVΔG-based (VSV/NG/NanoLuc)-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles
To generate (VSV/NG/NanoLuc)-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles 293T cells were
plated at 1x106 cells/well in 6-well plates. The following day cells were rinsed with with serum
free medium (SFM) and infected with recombinant T7-expressing vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) in
SFM at MOI of ~5 for 30-45 min, gently rocking the plate every 10-15 minutes. Thereafter, cells
were washed with DMEM and 1.5 ml DMEM++ added per well. Next a mixture of plasmids
encoding the rVSV antigenome; rVSVΔG/NG/NanoLuc, (500ng) and rescue plasmids pBS-N
(300ng) pBS-P (500ng) pBS-L (100ng) pBS-G (800ng) were mixed with 5.5 ul PLUS reagent in
100ul Opti-MEM. Then, 9ul Lipofectamine LTX was added to 125ul Opti-MEM, and the diluted
plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine LTX mixed and incubated for 20 minutes prior to addition to the
vTF7-3-infected cells. The growth medium was replaced the following morning. At ~24h post
transfection the supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.1μm filter and used to infect
VSV-G expressing cells for amplification.
To amplify rescued rVSVΔG/NG/NanoLuc. 5x106 293T cells were plated per 10 cm dish
in 10ml in growth medium or 1.2x107 293T cells were plated in 15cm dishes. The following day,
cells were transfected with 5μg (10cm dish) or 12.5μg (15cm dish) of pCMV-VSV-G expression
plasmid, using PEI. The following day, the transfected cells were infected with the rescued virus
and 16h later the supernatant was collected centrifuged at 350g to clarify and filtered through a
0.22μm filters.
To prepare stocks of (VSV/NG/NanoLuc)-SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles, 293T cells
were plated at 1.2x107 293T cells were plated in 15cm dishes, and transfected the following day
with 12.5μg pSARS-CoV2Δ19. The next day the transfected cells were infected with the above
described VSV-G complemented rVSVΔG/NG/NanoLuc virus at an MOI of 1. At 16h later the

supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 350xg to clarify and filtered through a 0.22μm filter.
Next the filtered supernatant was layered on top of a 20% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at
25,000 rpm for 1.5h in a SW32 Ti rotor in a Beckman Optima XE-90 Ultracentrifuge.
Alternatively, virions were concentrated using Lenti-X-Concentrator (Takarabio). The pelleted
virus was resuspended in DMEM aliquoted and stored at -80oC. Prior to infection of target cells,
the viral stock was incubated with 20% I1 hybridoma (anti-VSV-G) supernatant (ATCC CRL2700) for 1h at 37oC to neutralize contaminating rVSVΔG/NG/NanoLuc/VSV-G particles.

Replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimera
To recover the infectious rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric virus, 293T cells were plated in 6well plates infected with vTF7-3 and transfected with a mixture of plasmids encoding the
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP (500ng) and rescue plasmids including pBS-G, as described above for
VSVΔG pseudotype particles. At ~24h post transfection the supernatant was collected, filtered
through a 0.1μm filter to remove vaccina virus and used to infect 293T cells transfected with the
pCMV-VSV-G expression plasmid for amplification of the rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP population.
Thereafter, the complemented virus was used to infect 293T/ACE2(B) cells in 25cm2 flasks in
the absence of the complementing VSV-G protein, and the virus population passaged, as
described in the Results section. To isolate adapted variants, the viral supernatant was serially
diluted and aliquots of each dilution used to inoculate 12 wells of a 96-well plate containing
293T/ACE2(B) cells. Virus was harvested from wells that contained individual green fluorescent
plaques (signifying infection by single viruses). Two plaque purified viruses that were
investigated further were designated rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and rVSV/SARS-CoV2/GFP2E1. RNA was isolated from cultures infected with rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP1D7 and
rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) and cDNA synthesis
was performed using SuperScript III using hexamers (ThermoFisher). Sequences encoding S
and flanking regions were PCR amplified and sequenced (Genewiz).

Infectivity assays
To measure the infectivity of pseudotyped or chimeric viral particles, viral stocks were
serially diluted and 100 µl of each dilution added to target cells plated at 1x104 cells/well in 100
µl medium in 96-well plates the previous day. Cells were then cultured for 48h hours (HIV-1
pseudoviruses) or 16h (VSV pseudoviruses or replication competent rVSV/SARs-CoV-2) unless
otherwise indicated, and then photographed or harvested for flow cytometry or NanoLuc
luciferase assays.

Neutralization assays
To measure neutralizing antibody activity in plasma, serial dilutions of plasma from
COVID19 patients and healthy donors a 1:12.5 initial dilution were five-fold serial diluted in 96well plates over 7-8 dilutions. To measure neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies, a 40
µg/ml initial dilution was four-fold serially diluted over 11 dilutions. Thereafter, a 55 µl aliquot of
serially diluted plasma, monoclonal antibody or decoy was incubated with a 55 µl aliquot of HIV1 (2-plasmid), HIV-1 (3-plasmid) or VSV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus or rVSV/SARS-CoV2/GFP containing approximately 1x103 infectious units for 1h at 37oC in a 96-well plate.
Thereafter, 100 µl of the mixture was added to target cells plated at 1x104 cells/well in 100 µl
medium in 96-well plates the previous day. Thus, the final starting dilutions were 1:50 for plasma
and 10 µg/ml for monoclonal antibodies. Cells were then cultured for 48h hours (HIV-1
pseudoviruses) or 16h (VSV pseudovirus and rVSV/SARS-CoV-2) unless otherwise indicated.
Thereafter cells were photographed or harvested for flow cytometry or NanoLuc luciferase assays

Reporter gene assays
For the NanoLuc luciferase assays, cells were washed twice, carefully, with PBS and lysed
with 50 µl/well of Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis reagent (Promega). NanoLuc Luciferase activity in

lysates was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Specifically, 25
µl of substrate in NanoGlo buffer was mixed with 25 µl cell lysate in black flat bottom plates and
incubated for 5 min at RT. NanoLuc luciferase activity was measured using a Modulus II
Microplate Multimode reader (Turner BioSystem) or a Glowmax Navigator luminometer
(Promega), using 0.1s integration time. Relative luminescence units (RLU) obtained were
normalized to those derived from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in the absence of
plasma/antibodies.
To record GFP+ cells, 96-well plates were photographed using and EVOS M7000
automated microscope. Alternatively, cells were trypsinized, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde,
washed and enumerated using an Attune NxT flow cytometer equipped with a 96-well
autosampler.
The half maximal inhibitory concentration for plasma (NT50), antibodies (IC50) was
determined using 4-parameter nonlinear regression curve fit to raw infectivity data measured as
relative light units, or as the percentage of infected cells (GraphPad Prism). The top values were
unconstrained, the bottom values were set to zero.

SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks and titration.
SARS-CoV-2, strain USA-WA1/2020, was obtained from BEI Resources and amplified in
VeroE6 cells at 33oC. Viral titers were measured on VeroE6 cells by standard plaque assay (PA).
Briefly, 500µl of serial 10-fold virus dilutions in Opti-MEM were used to infect 4x105 cells/well
seeded the previous day in 6-well plates. After 90 min adsorption, the virus inoculum was
removed, and cells were overlayed with DMEM containing 10% FBS with 1.2% microcrystalline
cellulose (Avicel). Cells were incubated for five days at 33oC, followed by fixation with 3.5%
formaldehyde and crystal violet staining for plaque enumeration. All experiments were performed
in a BSL-3 laboratory.

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Assay.
The day prior to infection VeroE6 cells were seeded at 1x104 cells/well into 96-well plates.
Plasma samples and antibodies were serial diluted in BA-1, consisting of medium 199 (Lonza,
Inc.) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin. Next,
the diluted samples were mixed with a constant amount of SARS-CoV-2 and incubated for 60 min
at 37 oC. The plasma/antibody-virus-mix was then directly applied to VeroE6 cells (MOI of ~0.1
PFU/cell; n=3) and incubated for 18-20 h at 37 oC Cells were subsequently fixed by adding an
equal volume of 7% formaldehyde to the wells, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X100 for 10 min. After extensive washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at RT with blocking solution
of 5% goat serum in PBS (catalog no. 005–000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). A rabbit
polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (catalog no. GTX135357; GeneTex) was
added to the cells at 1:500 dilution in blocking solution and incubated at 4 °C overnight.
Alternatively, J2, a mouse monoclonal anti-dsRNA antibody (catalog no. 10010500; Scicons) was
added to the cells under similar conditions to detect virus infected cells. Goat anti-rabbit
AlexaFluor 594 (catalog no. A-11012; Life Technologies) and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488
(catalog no. A-11001; Life Technologies) were used as a secondary antibodies at a dilution of
1:2,000. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (catalog no. 62249; Thermo Scientific) at a
1:1,000 dilution. Images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope and analyzed using
ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Human plasma samples and monoclonal antibodies
The human plasma and monoclonal antibodies used in this study were previously reported
(Robbiani et al., 2020). The human samples were obtained at the Rockefeller University
Hospital under protocols approved by the University’s Institutional Review Board.

Fig. 1. Two-plasmid and three-plasmid HIV-1-based pseudotyped viruses.
A. Schematic representation of the modified HIV-1NL ΔEnv-NanoLuc genome in which a deletion
in env was introduced and Nef-coding sequences were replaced by those encoding a NanoLuc
luciferase reporter. Infectious virus particles were generated by cotransfection of pHIV1NL4ΔEnv-NanoLuc and a plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S lacking the 19 amino acids at
the C-terminus of the cytoplasmic tail (SΔ19).

B. Schematic representation of constructs used to generate SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped HIV1-based particles in which HIV-1NLGagPol, an HIV-1 reporter vector (pCCNanoLuc/GFP)
encoding both NanoLuc luciferase and EGFP reporter and the SARS-CoV-2 SΔ19 are each
expressed on separate plasmids.
C. Infectivity measurements of HIV-1NL ΔEnv-NanoLuc particles (generated using the plasmids
depicted in A) on the indicated cell lines. Infectivity was quantified by measuring NanoLuc
luciferase activity (Relative Light Units, RLU) following infection of cells in 96-well plates with the
indicated volumes of pseudotyped viruses. The mean and standard deviation of two technical
replicates is shown. Target cells 293T/ACE2cl.22 and HT1080/ACE2cl.14 are single-cell clones
engineered to express human ACE2 (see Fig S1A). Virus particles generated in the absence of
viral envelope glycoproteins were used as background controls.
D. Same as, C but viruses were generated using the 3 plasmids depicted in B.
E. Infectivity meaurements of CCNanoLuc/GFP containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles
generated using plasmids depicted in B on 293ACE2*(B) cells, quantified by measuring
NanoLuc luciferase activity (RLU) or GFP levels (% of GFP positive cells). Mean and standard
deviation from two technical replicates is shown.
