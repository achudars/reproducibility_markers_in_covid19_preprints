Abstract
The outbreak and propagation of COVID-19 have posed a significant challenge to our
society, highlighting the relevance of epidemiological monitoring of animal pathogens
closely related to humans due to potential zoonosis. To find previously undetected viruses
inside Chilean swine farms, we collected non-invasive samples from animals suspected to
undergo any viral disease. After screening by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) adapted
to identify viral species with RNA and DNA genomes simultaneously, different viral
species were successfully detected. Among viruses with an RNA genome, Porcine
Rotavirus A (RVA), Porcine Astrovirus type 5 (PAstV-5) and Porcine Feces-Associated
IASV-like virus (PfaIV) were identified; whereas among viruses with DNA genome,
Porcine Parvovirus 1 (PPV1), Porcine Circovirus type 1 (PCV1) and Porcine Circovirus
type 3 (PCV3) were found. PCV3, a recently described pathogenic virus, was detected for
the first time in Chile in different samples from mummified tissue of stillbirths. The whole
genome sequence of PCV3 was completed using conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing
and compared with previously reported genomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that an adapted NGS system is used for the screening of DNA and RNA viral
species simultaneously inside the Chilean swine industry. This adapted NGS system might
be useful for the detection of swine viral emerging diseases worldwide.

The outbreak and propagation of COVID-19 have posed a significant challenge to our
society, highlighting the relevance of epidemiological monitoring of animal pathogens
closely related to humans due to potential zoonosis1. Molecular diagnostics have proven to
be useful for accelerating detection of ongoing diseases both in humans and in animals2.
Diagnostics and surveillance of human pathogens in developed countries is mostly
entrusted to protocols involving NGS in order to face diseases faster and avoid epidemics.
Likewise, international animal diagnostics using NGS are growing, especially for detection
of emergent viral pathogens3,4. This has been the case for swine re-emerging pathogens
causing the African Swine Fever or the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome,
viruses that recently have caused severe economic losses worldwide5. Chile possesses
natural geographic borders with neighboring countries that limit animal displacement.
However, the Chilean swine industry is vulnerable to epidemics due to the import of
animals for breeding. Progenitors are usually obtained from countries of the north
hemisphere, which constitute a probable route for the introduction of emerging pathogens
despite quarantine of all animals introduced to the country. Viral infectious diseases are
often neglected unless outbreaks emerge, and screening of international pathogens during
or after quarantine is not currently performed. On the one hand, most reports on animal
viral detection by NGS to date are standardized for single virus detection. In simplified
terms, these approaches usually comprise extraction of either DNA or RNA viral genomes
followed by specific amplification of viral copies with specific oligonucleotides before or
concurrently to the library preparation. Resulting reads are assembled against reference
genomes available; thus, less bioinformatic capacity is needed.
On the other hand, sequencing of unknown viral species is a more complex task as viruses
differ broadly in genome size, structure, and composition. Besides, more sophisticated
algorithms are required for data analysis, such as the assembly of reads "de novo” without
reference genomes. A previous study in pigs has shown simultaneous detection of DNA
and RNA viruses in feces6. The study reported the extraction of total nucleic acids of
concentrated viral particles using pooled samples of feces of five healthy pigs and a CsCl
density gradient. Amplification of total RNA was used to increase viral copies before NGS,
and three types of phages were used as controls. However, ultracentrifuges and complicated
methods for viral concentration are usually not a choice in small labs. Thus, before sample
processing, it is strongly recommended first that researchers explore equipment
accessibility and available samples to compare for time and cost-efficient viral nucleic
acids extractions6,7. Second, considering that different pipelines for analysis may lead to
result discrepancies, it is relevant to choose an adequate platform for the study6,8.
In the context of public-private funding search, the use of NGS technology inside the
Chilean swine industry was implemented to detect viral species that could be affecting
productivity. In the present study, a mix of 30 random octamers previously reported was
used to reverse transcribe viral sequences avoiding ribosomal RNA sequences from
bacteria and human9. A total of 85 samples were collected from 60 animals suspected of
undergoing any viral disease (Supplementary table 1). Among clinical signs, there were pigs

with diarrhea, flu-like signs, ear-and-tail necrosis, and mummified stillborn fetuses. Most of
the samples were non-invasive, including nasal or fecal swabs, semen, placenta or blood.
Exceptionally, tissue samples were taken from mummified stillborn fetuses and sick
animals of unknown etiology, which were euthanized for merciful reasons. No animal
experimentation was made for this study. Samples were transported in DNA/RNA Shield
(Zymo Research, Irvine, Ca, USA) at room temperature and stored at -20 ºC in the same
medium until total nucleic acid extraction. Total nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) were
obtained from the samples described above using MagMAX™ CORE Nucleic Acid
Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). For NGS, instead of using
RNA only as previously described9, total nucleic acids were reverse transcribed using
Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Ca, USA), combined
with the mixed 30 octamers reported previously20 at 1µM final each9. Second strand DNAs
were synthesized using Klenow fragment of DNA PolI (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
followed by isothermal amplification using either Phi29 DNA Polymerase or EquiPhi29™
DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 30 or 42 ºC respectively for
3 hours. Obtained double-stranded DNAs were purified using 2 Volumes of Agentcourt®
AMPure® XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and followed by quantification using
Quant-IT™ DNA Assay Kit, Broad Range (Invitrogen™) and VICTOR® Nivo™
microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Despite all 85 samples undergoing
this processing into double-stranded DNA/cDNA, only 70 samples did meet the minimum
concentration for DNA library synthesis. Samples were normalized into 2nM concentration,
and libraries were prepared using Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA) according to manufacturing instructions. After library purification, samples were
pooled and loaded into the MiSeq System (Illumina). For data analysis, raw reads were
assessed for quality using FastQC (bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
Trimming, to remove adapters and low-quality bases (Q < 10), was performed using
BBDuk software (sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). De Novo assembly was performed
using SPAdes (cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/) or MetaSPAdes using virMine tool, which is
useful for the
assembly of viral species10. When comparing virMine output FASTA files generated for
every sample, it was noticed that occasionally, a genuine viral contig found within the
“final_contigs” file was missing within the “viral_contigs” file; thereafter all final_contigs
files were analyzed for every sample using nucleotide Blast from NCBI. Default parameters
or virus txid: 10239 restricted searches of Blast provided similar results considering
identity parameters over 90% and query coverages over 60% for every contig.
Careful revision needed to be made for some endoretroviral sequences with identity scores
over 90% that also matched host genome sequences with slightly higher identity. The
results indicated that viral species were detected in 12 out of the 70 samples (17%). Viral
sequences constituted less than 1% from total contigs that matched mainly host sequences
or bacteria, depending on the sample type. Among positive samples, 3 (25%) contained
contigs matching two different viral species. RNA genome viruses were identified. Namely,

a fecal swab from an animal undergoing diarrhea matched contigs for Porcine Astrovirus
type 5 (PAstV-5) and Rotavirus A (RVA); whereas, the second sample of fecal swab
matched contigs for PAstV-5 and Porcine Feces-Associated IASV-like virus (PfaIV).
PAstV-5, detected in this study on fecal samples of animals undergoing diarrhea, is a
positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that has been previously reported in feces of both
healthy and ill animals11. A previous study has already reported simultaneous detection of
PAstV and Rotavirus species on diarrheic swine12, which may suggest that coinfection of
these viruses could be required for causing diarrhea. Additionally, Porcine astroviruses
have been reported as neurovirulent, associated with encephalomyelitis outbreaks in
different countries13 Rotaviruses, on the other hand, are a group of double-stranded RNA
viruses with a segmented genome that cause acute gastroenteritis in several species. Porcine
rotaviruses have demonstrated to cause several economic losses in the swine industry, with
RVA having the highest prevalence14; yet, high viral diversity of this family has led to a
limited coverage of vaccines and consequently, to reduced immunization practices15.
Lastly, PfaIV was detected on a feces sample from a 28 days old piglet undergoing severe
diarrhea. This virus has been previously detected on pig feces with no direct association to
disease, as it was also found in asymptomatic piglet feces16.
DNA genome viruses were also identified. Among these viral species, Porcine Parvovirus
type 1 (PPV1) was found on a swab sample from the abdominal cavity taken from a grown
animal with signs of polyserositis. PPVs are small, non-enveloped, and single-stranded
DNA viruses belonging to family Parvoviridae17. PPV1 causes reproductive failure, also
known as SMEDI syndrome (stillbirths, mummification, embryonic death, and infertility),
and does not cause any disease sign in non-pregnant pigs18. Also, the coinfection of PPVs
and Porcine Circoviruses has been described, suggesting a possible association between
these viruses18. Moreover, two species of porcine circovirus, also DNA viruses, were
detected among Chilean samples. Circoviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a singlestranded circular DNA genome19. There are three species of porcine circovirus (PCV1,
PCV2, and PCV3), although only PCV2 and PCV3 are considered pathogenic18. In this
study, we detected contigs matching PCV1 and PCV3 in samples associated with
reproductive failure. Coinfection was also detected in a sample of the placenta from a sow
delivering mummified stillbirth fetuses. To compare the pathogenic PCV3 identified in this
study with previously reported isolates, we completed the sequence of the whole genome
(2000 nucleotides). To accomplish this, NGS resulting contigs matching PCV3 obtained
from a mummified tissue sample, were aligned with a couple of full genomes obtained
from NCBI database. Alignment resulted in approximately 80% of the full genome
sequence covered, lacking a middle portion of approximately 400 nucleotides. This
remaining 20% was completed using oligonucleotides reported previously, followed by
Sanger-sequencing20. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted
using MEGA6 (www.megasoftware.net) by aligning the full PCV3 genome obtained in
Chile with the 318 full genome sequences from 17 different countries (available on NCBI
nucleotide database by December 2019). PCV3 genome described in this study is the

southernmost genome reported to date (Figure 1A), with close similarity to PCV3b
genomes obtained from samples from Italy, South Korea, China, Hungary, and Brazil
(Figure 1B). The full genome sequence was submitted to the NCBI repository under the
GenBank accession number MN907812. Remarkably, PCV3 was the most frequently
detected virus among our samples, even though it has not been previously described in
Chile. To confirm this finding, we randomly selected 50 samples among the 85 total
samples, including a couple of those positive to PCV3 by NGS as controls and those
samples that did not meet the minimum concentration for NGS library synthesis, and tested
the amplification by PCR of a 328 bp viral segment of the cap ORF using specific primers
reported previously21. Specific amplification was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using
Big Dye Terminator Kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems™) and a 3500 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), followed by nucleotide Blast. The results
confirmed the presence of PCV3 in approximately 70% of the samples tested. These
samples represent mostly symptomatic animals from 3 different sites geographically
separated along the country and belonging to the same company; thus, this high circulating
percentage does not apply to all Chilean pig farms. As a result of this finding, further
studies will be undertaken across the country with different companies to assess the
relevance of PCV3 within the Chilean swine industry. Also, a full genome diversity
evaluation for the related pathogen PCV2 will be perfomed, with special focus on Cap
protein against which vaccines are currently being developed.
Altogether, these results indicate that the adapted procedure for swine viral species reported
herein has shown to be useful for the identification of viral pathogens containing either
RNA or DNA genomes. Total nucleic acid extraction seemed suitable in this context;
however, it contributed to a high presence of host genome sequences that might lead to a
lower sensitivity of the approach. These results allowed us to confirm, for the first time, the
presence of PCV3 circulating in Chilean swine farms.
Early identification of pathogens is crucial for the decision-making process regarding the
prevention, control, and treatment of disease as well as for mitigation of the economic
impact of viral diseases. Thus, the availability of more straightforward protocols like the
one described in this work using NGS for searching and studying swine viruses is relevant
to enhance productivity and to provide the required preparedness to face possible viral
outbreaks inside the swine industry.
