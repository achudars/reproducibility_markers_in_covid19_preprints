Abstract

22

The first Indian cases of COVID-19 caused by SARS-Cov-2 were reported in February 29, 2020

23

with a history of travel from Wuhan, China and so far above 4500 deaths have been attributed to

24

this pandemic. The objectives of this study were to characterize Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome-

25

wide nucleotide variations, trace ancestries using phylogenetic networks and correlate state-wise

26

distribution of viral haplotypes with differences in mortality rates. A total of 305 whole genome

27

sequences from 19 Indian states were downloaded from GISAID. Sequences were aligned using

28

the ancestral Wuhan-Hu genome sequence (NC_045512.2). A total of 633 variants resulting in

29

388 amino acid substitutions were identified. Allele frequency spectrum, and nucleotide diversity

30

(π) values revealed the presence of higher proportions of low frequency variants and negative

31

Tajima’s D values across ORFs indicated the presence of population expansion. Network

32

analysis highlighted the presence of two major clusters of viral haplotypes, namely, clade G with

33

the S:D614G, RdRp: P323L variants and a variant of clade L [Lv] having the RdRp:A97V

34

variant. Clade G genomes were found to be evolving more rapidly into multiple sub-clusters

35

including clade GH and GR and were also found in higher proportions in three states with

36

highest mortality rates namely, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.

1. Introduction

44

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

45

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in December, 2019 from Wuhan, China and

46

since then has spread across the globe with 349,190 deaths as reported to WHO[1, 2]. The

47

SARS-CoV-2 has a 29.9 kilobase long RNA genome coding for 22 proteins. The first whole

48

genome (RNA) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published on the 5th of January, 2020 [3] and

49

currently more than 30,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been submitted from across the world

50

to Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)[4]. It has also been identified on the

51

basis of nucleotide variants that 8 major clades of viral haplotypes have spread across the globe

52

causing the pandemic [4]. However, the implications of the evolutionary genome-wide changes

53

still remain elusive.

54

Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is imperative to understand the transmission routes, possible

55

sources and cross species evolution and transmission to human hosts. On the basis of such

56

sequence identity it has been speculated that the bats form reservoir of such viruses (bat CoV

57

genome, RaTG13) and are a probable species of origin [5]. Further, reports have also shown

58

strong homology among viruses in metavirome data sets of SARS-CoV, which were generated

59

from the lungs of deceased pangolins [6].

60

In India, the first three cases of COVID-19 with travel history from Wuhan, China were reported

61

from the state of Kerala in February 2020. Since then the virus and the disease has spread to all

62

37 states and union territories with 86110 active cases and 4531 deaths till date and the

63

percentage of death rates seem to differ among states so far [7]. Attempts have been made to

64

sequence the genomes of Indian clinical isolates to understand genome-wide variability and viral

65

evolution and over 300 sequences have been deposited to GISAID so far from many Indian

66

states [8, 9]. However, there has been no study to delineate ancestries or to characterize the

67

distribution patterns of viral haplotypes across states. Hence, in this study a total of 305 Indian

68

SARS-CoV genome sequences were used in an effort to understand the evolution of these

69

viruses, trace the routes of infection and gauge the clustering patterns across states.

70

2. Material and Methods

71

2.1 Nucleotide alignment, and variant calling

72

All SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (n=305) that had been isolated from Indian nationals and

73

submitted from India were downloaded on the 18th of May 2020 from the GISAID database. Out

74

of a total of 305 sequences, 26 were found without state information and 7 had been grown in

75

Vero cells. The rest of the isolates were collected from 20 different states which included Andhra

76

Pradesh (n=2), Assam (n=2), Bihar (n=6), Delhi (n=39), Gujarat (n=103), Haryana (n=1), Jammu

77

(n=1), Kashmir (n=1), Karnataka (n=17), Kerela (n=2), Ladakh (n=6), Madhya Pradesh (n=10),

78

Maharastra (n=7), Odisha (n=1), Punjab (n=1), Rajasthan (n=1), Tamil Nadu (n=19), Telangana

79

(n=35), Uttar Pradesh (n=5) and West Bengal (n=13) (Supplementary table S1).Given the initial

80

emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from Wuhan, China, alignment was carried out using the

81

genome sequence submitted by Wu et. al. (NC_045512.2) in January 2020[3]. Additionally, the

82

bat and pangolin SARS-related coronaviruses [RaTG13 (MN996532), MN789 (MT121216)] that

83

have been reported to be the closest to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [10] were aligned to identify

84

conserved amino acids across ORFs. Multiple sequence alignment was executed using

85

MUSCLE [11] with three iterations for both. Since different sequencing platforms had been used

86

to generate SARS-CoV-2 sequence data with different error rates and filtering cut-offs hence, the

87

variant calling was stringently carried out with a minimum coverage of 150 genomes.

88

Ambiguous bases found in genome sequences were considered to be unresolved for the purpose

89

of analyses. The SIFT database was used to identify amino acid changes that could protein

90

function (http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT_seq_submit2.html) [12].

91

2.2 Measurements of diversity and deviation from neutrality

92

Watterson’s estimator (θw), nucleotide diversity (π) and Tajima’s D [13] for each open reading

93

frame (ORF) was calculated using MEGA X [14].

94

2.3 Phylogeny construction

95

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out following the median-joining approach using Network

96

10.1.0.0 software [15]. For phylogenetic construction a variant frequency cutoff of ≥ 0.01 was

97

used and a 97% cutoff for the number of sequences with resolved bases for each position to

98

avoid spurious clustering. One genome sequence (EPI_ISL_414515) had to be removed from

99

analyses for the absence of complete sequence information.

100

3. Results

101

3.1 Description of the variants found within the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes

102

Multiple sequence alignment with 305 Indian viral sequences and ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate

103

sequence (NC_045512.2) revealed the presence of 572 single nucleotide variants along with 61

104

di-nucleotide, tri-nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions out of which 388 were non-

105

synonymous changes resulting in amino acid substitution. The allele frequencies of all the 633

106

variants varied from 0.3-53.4% and greater than 90% of these were low frequency variants

107

ranging from 0.3-1% (Figure 1A, supplementary table S2). Among the single nucleotide variants

108

C-T transition per cytosine residue in the genome was highest at 3.04%, followed by G-T

109

transversion (1.74%) (Figure 1B, supplementary table 2). The NSP3 and S ORFs had the highest

110

number of non-synonymous changes each (n=75, 19.33%) (Figure 1C).

111

3.2 Deviation from neutral viral evolution

112

Given the number of variants identified, the diversities across all the ORFs were calculated.

113

ORF7a was found to have the lowest nucleotide diversity while the S ORF had the highest.

114

Overall, the nucleotide diversity (π) values were low across ORFs in comparison to the θ

115

(Watterson’s estimater) values (Figure 1D) which was indicative of the presence of higher

116

proportion of low frequency variants as has been described in Figure 1A. The next objective was

117

to determine if the patterns of diversity could be attributed to genetic drift or neutrality. Tajima’s

118

test for neutrality was applied and all the ORFs were found to have negative Tajima’s D values

119

(Figure 1D) indicative of non-neutral evolution.

123

3.4 Presence of two major clades of Indian SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes with emergence of multiple

124

subclusters

125

To trace the ancestries of the Indian viral isolates, network analysis was carried out using the

126

Hamming distances of variants present at ≥1% frequency among the genomes (Supplementary

127

table S3). The haplotypes were generated stringently using a total of 53 single nucleotide

128

variants, a di-nucleotide variant AA-CU at positions 10,478-10,479, a tri-nucleotide substitution

129

at positions 28,881-28,883GGG-AAC together resulting in 38 amino acid changes and 304

130

Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (Figure 2, Supplementary table S4). A total of 54 nodes

131

with 54 distinct haplotypes were discovered using 304 genome sequences. The network

132

appearance was as expected from an ongoing pandemic with the presence of ancestral viral

133

haplotypes existing along with newly mutated genomes. There were two major clusters of

134

haplotypes that were found to have emerged from the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 virus (clade L)

135

identified to be belonging to clade G and a variant of the clade L which has been annotated here

136

as Lv (Figure 3). Seventy-nine viral isolates were found to be belonging to clade Lv and there

137

were 36 clade G viruses. The clade Lv genomes differed from the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1

138

sequence at one locus resulting in a change in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)

139

protein [C13,730U,(A97V)] while the G haplotype viruses differed at three loci resulting in one

140

amino acid change each in the RdRp, S protein [C3037U, C14,408U (RdRp: P323L), A23,403G

141

(S:D614G)]. Two sub-clusters were observed evolving from clade G; GH variant mentioned

142

here as GHv with the variants C18877U, G25563U (ORF3a:Q57H), C26735U having multiple

143

evolving branches and GR with the tri-nucleotide GGG-AAC substitution at positions 28,881-

144

28,883 resulting in two amino acid changes R203K, G204R in the N protein (Figure 3).

145

Reticulations were also observed which could happen because of parallel mutations or

146

homoplasy.

148

149
150

There were 14 variants [C241U, C1707U, G2632U, C6310A, C6312A, U8022G,

151

G11083U, A15435G, U19299G, A19422G, C19524U, C23929U, G27613U, C28311U] that

152

could not be included in the network analysis because of the presence of unresolved bases at

153

multiple viral genome sequences. These variants were subsequently evaluated in the subset of

154

sequences that had information among the major haplotypes belonging to clade Lv (n=28) and G

155

(n=20). The variants G11083U (NSP6:L37F), C23929U, C28311U (N:P13L) were found to

156

cluster in high proportion of clade Lv viruses (71.5%) and as expected the 5’ UTR variant C241T

157

was found to cluster among the clade G viral isolates and its evolving sub-clusters.

158

All the amino acid changes that were present at ≥1% frequency were also evaluated on

159

the basis of conservation (Table 1). NSP3 amino acid changes were found to be at the most non-

160

conserved sites; however, the changes were predicted to be affecting protein function. Further,

161

there were three loci where the variants resulted in amino acid changes that were fixed in either

162

the RaTG13 or the MN789 genome (NSP2: V198I, NSP3: D1121G, T1198K). Most of the

163

variants across clades Lv, G, GHv and GR were found to occur in conserved codons across

164

species except for the NSP6: L37F variant where the leucine codon had been replaced by a

165

valine in the MN789 genome and the S:D614G variant where the pangolin coronavirus isolate

166

MN789 S-ORF had a threonine codon.

3.4 Statewise distribution of viral haplotypes

177

There were two individuals with whole genome sequence data (sequence IDs EPI_ISL_413522,

178

EPI_ISL_413523) from Kerala who were the first to be identified with COVID-19 symptoms

179

and specimens were collected from India on 27th January and 31st January 2020 respectively [9].

180

It was found that the EPI_ISL_413522 haplotype clustered with the Wuhan-Hu-1 haplotype and

181

the second isolate had two nucleotide changes resulting in an amino acid change in the ORF8

182

protein [C8782U, U28,144C (ORF8: L84S)] (Figure 3). Additionally, a viral isolate collected on

183

1st March 2020 from Telangana was also found to cluster with the ancestral isolate.

184

So far the highest number of deaths per number of confirmed cases has been recorded in

185

the states of Gujarat (6.2%), Madhya Pradesh (4.3) and West Bengal (6.9%) (Supplementary

186

table S5). Out of these three states the maximum numbers of isolates have been sequenced from

187

Gujarat (n=103). Among the total of 103 of these viral isolates, 18 (17.5%) were found to belong

188

to clade G, while the rest with the exception of 7 Lv clade isolates (6.8%) were distributed among

189

sub-clusters arising from clade G (n=77; 74.8%) with additional number of variants. Among the

190

7 clade Lv viral isolates, 6 were observed to have been isolated from individuals of the same city,

191

Surat. The isolates from Madhya Pradesh (n=10) were also distributed between clade G and its

192

sub-cluster, clade GHv while ˃50% (7 out of 13) the West Bengal isolates belonged to clade G,

193

GR or another sub-cluster of clade G with the S:D614G variant. The viral isolates(n=6) from

194

Bihar which has much lower mortality rates (0.5%) were found to be distributed among the clade

195

Lv and its branches and the isolates from Ladakh (n=6) which has not had any COVID-19 deaths

196

were found to differ from the ancestral isolate with three non-synonymous changes [C884U

197

(nsp2: R27C), G1397A (NSP2: V198I), G8653U (NSP4: M33I)] , a synonymous change

198

(U28688C), a change in the 3’UTR region [G29742U] and one non-synonymous and another

199

synonymous change in 5 of the 6 isolates [U16993C (nsp13: Y253H), U25461C]. The isolate

200

sequences from Delhi which has 2% mortality were found to be distributed across the both the

201

major clusters and sub-clusters.

4. Discussion

204

A number of studies from India have described the presence of various mutations across the

205

SAR-CoV-2 genome with hints of selection and in silico predictions of alterations in protein

206

functions [16-18] so far. In this study an attempt has been made to understand the pattern of

207

evolution within human hosts, to infer the ancestries of the viral isolates using the phylogenetic

208

network approach which had been used earlier to build SARS-CoV-2 infection paths [19] and

209

make an effort at correlating it with morbidity.

210

While comparing the 305 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes a number of nucleotide variants

211

or segregating sites were identified, however, the nucleotide diversity values (π) were indicative

212

of an excess of low frequency variants. This could be because of recent population expansions as

213

has been observed in H1N1 populations involved in outbreaks and epidemics [20] and the

214

uniform negative Tajima’s D values across all the SARS-CoV-2 ORFs could also be attributed to

215

it.

216

The clade G (S:D614G) viruses with the C14,408U (RdRp: P323L) variant were found to

217

incur more number of mutations leading to the emergence of a number of sub-clusters of viruses

218

with increased branch lengths in comparison to the clade Lv viruses including clade GH and GR.

219

These clade G viruses were also found in more numbers in states where higher mortality rates

220

were recorded. Occurrence of higher numbers of mutations might be attributed to altered

secondary structure and impaired RdRp proofreading due to the C14,408U (RdRp: P323L)

222

variant as has been speculated in earlier reports [21, 22]. Additionally, there has been a report on

223

clinical outcome from Sheffield, England where the G614 mutation was associated with higher

224

viral loads [23] which might be contributing to the higher mortality rates. However, these

225

implications will have to be tested further with direct correlations using comprehensive clinical

226

data and genomic data from all the states.
