Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory system can evolve to a multi-system disease.
Excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines, known as a ‘cytokine storm’ are
associated with high mortality rates especially in the elderly and in patients with agerelated morbidities. Senescent cells, characterized by secretion of such cytokines
(Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype - SASP), are known to occur in this context
as well as upon a variety of stressogenic insults. Applying both: i) a novel “in house”
antibody against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ii) a unique senescence detecting
methodology, we identified for the first time in lung tissue from COVID-19 patients
alveolar cells acquiring senescent features harboring also SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, using
the same detection workflow we demonstrated the inflammatory properties of these
cells. Our findings justify the application of senotherapeutics for the treatment or
prevention of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily affects the respiratory system but can
evolve to a multi-system disease with excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines,
described as a ‘cytokine storm’ (1). High mortality rates have been observed in the
elderly and in patients with age-related morbidities (2). Understanding the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms is important in developing more effective therapies.
Cellular senescence is a fundamental mechanism characterised by generally
irreversible cell-cycle arrest, altered metabolism, macromolecular damage and
proinflammatory features termed Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)
(3). The evidence linking viral infection to cellular senescence is sparse, although
oncogenes, -which may trigger senescence- were initially discovered in viruses (4, 5).
Viral infection has been associated with DNA damage and cell fusion, well-known
inducers of senescence (4, 6), and elicits release of pro-inflammatory mediators that may
promote senescence via paracrine mechanisms (5). Therefore, senescence may act as a
cellular defense mechanism against viral infection and increased prevalence of
senescence could occur in infected and surrounding cells. Given the significance of
systemic inflammation in the outcome of COVID-19, we have studied whether SARS-CoV2 may be associated with cellular senescence in infected lung cells and the SASP
phenotype (5).

Methods
Patient samples: Formalin-Fixed-Paraffin-Embedded lung tissues from ten COVID-19
patients (mean±SD: 72.4±16yr; 7 males) confirmed by molecular testing, and ten agematched non-COVID-19 lung tissues samples from previously published cohort (71.8 ± 15
yr, 5 males) were analyzed (7). All protocols were approved by the Commission cantonale
d'éthique de la recherche, Lausanne (CERVD) Ref 2020-01257 and the Bio-Ethics
Committee of Athens Medical School.
Immunocytochemistry: Immunohistochemistry was performed using: the anti-SARS-CoV2 mAb (G2), which was produced and validated in house; anti-ACE-2 (Abcam); antiThyroid-Transcription-Factor(TTF)-1 (Dako); anti-CD68 (Dako); anti-p16INK4A (Santa Cruz);
IL-1β (Abcam) and IL-6 (R&D systems), as described (8). The Novolink Polymer Detection
System (Leica Biosystems) was used for development of the signal and hematoxylin for
counterstaining. SenTraGorTM(GL13) and double stainings were performed as published
(8).
Quantification: Cells were considered positive with G2 staining irrespective of the
staining intensity. A previously described semi-quantitative IHC evaluation was adopted
(9). Electron microscopy was performed using a FEI Morgagni 268 transmission electron
microscope equipped with Olympus Morada digital camera.

Results
We initially developed monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein for the detection
of SARS-CoV-2, and the antibody with the highest affinity (G2) was used. The specificity
of G2 mAb was validated in formalin fixed paraffin lung tissues from COVID-19 patients
by: i) omitting it and ii) performing competition with the corresponding spike antipeptide (Figure 1A). Absence of G2 immunoreactivity was observed in a large cohort of
non-COVID-19 lung tissues (Figure 1A,vii) (7). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in alveolar type-II
(AT2) pneumocytes (TTF-1 positive, CD-68 negative) of all COVID-19 patients, with values
ranging from <5/4mm2 to >50/4mm2(data not shown). The SARS-CoV-2 infected AT2 cells
were occasionally of large size with a brown moderate to strong, diffuse or granular
cytoplasmic signal (Figure 1Ai,iii,v). Topologically, they either covered the alveolar walls
and protruded into the airspaces from the edges of the alveolar septa or appeared within
the alveolar spaces isolated (denuded or syncytial) or in clusters (hyperplasia) (Figure
1Ai,iii,v). Electron microscopy analysis in representative cases confirmed the presence of
the virus within AT2 cells (Figure 1Bi,ii). High magnification revealed virions in the
proximity of the endoplasmic reticulum suggesting their assembly and budding, as well as
virions residing in cytoplasmic vesicles indicating their transfer and release into the
extracellular space (Figure 1Biii,iv,v).
Subsequently, we asked whether the G2-positive cells exerted features of cellular
senescence. Applying the recently reported guideline workflow for senescence detection,
we observed both in serial sections and through co-staining, a proportion of G2-positive
AT2 cells (range 8 to 17%) displaying strong reactivity to SenTraGor, a marker of
senescence (Figure 2A,Bi,2C,D) (3, 8). Senescent phenotype was further verified with co7

staining for p16INK4A, a marker of stress-related senescence (Figure 2Bii)(3). Occasionally
these cells tended to cluster (Figure 2Ai-vi) and in serial sections were found to coexpress the ACE2 (Figure 2Aiii,vi), a finding supportive of SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated
by ACE2 (1).
We next tested whether the senescent pneumocytes exert features of SASP. We
found in serial sections and co-staining analysis (Figure 2E-F), expression of both IL-1β
and IL-6, which were absent in non-COVID19 cases (Figure 2G). This observation provides
the foremost verification for expression of SASP factors by senescent cells in an ex-vivo
setting. As both cytokines are key components of the "cytokine storm", this implicates
cellular senescence via SASP in the poor clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients who are
elderly and suffering from age-related diseases.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence of cellular senescence and
expression of SASP components in SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung cells. Moreover, we
demonstrate that in the COVID-19 setting, senescence alters the properties and function
of a respiratory cell compartment, rendering its constituents capable for producing
cytokines that can readily be released into the systemic circulation. Whether senescence
pre-exists at the time of infection, making cells more susceptible to infection with the
virus, or whether senescence is triggered as an antiviral response, remain unanswered
questions. Putatively, both scenarios could co-exist. Regarding the first scenario at the
time of infection the burden of senescent cells is anticipated high in the elderly and in
individuals with age-related diseases, rendering them vulnerable to develop a proinflammatory phenotype. Notably, in our COVID-19 cohort the percentages of senescent
cells were higher in patients over 73 years-old vs younger patients (Mann-Whitney test:
p<0.05). Regarding the second scenario, senescence might be an antiviral response
against SARS-CoV-2 and infected senescent cells could induce paracrine senescence in
nearby cells, thus increasing the senescence load. Irrespective of the origin, both
scenarios are related to SASP secretion that seems at least in part a source or even a
trigger of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, commonly observed in the blood of COVID-19
patients.
Overall, the reported findings justify the application and promising findings of
recent studies using senotherapeutics (senolytics, SASP modulators/inhibitors) for
treatment or prevention of COVID-19 patients (10).
