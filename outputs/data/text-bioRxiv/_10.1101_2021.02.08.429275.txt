Abstract (181)

32

The dramatically expanding COVID-19 needs multiple effective countermeasures.

33

Neutralizing antibodies are a potential therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. A

34

number of neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) were reported for their in vitro activities.

35

However, in vivo protection of these nanobodies was not reported in animal models. In

36

the current report, we characterized several RBD-specific Nbs isolated from a screen

37

of an Nb library derived from an alpaca immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike

38

glycoprotein (S); among them, three Nbs exhibited picomolar potency against SARS-

39

CoV-2 live virus, pseudotyped viruses, and 15 circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. To

40

improve the efficacy, various configurations of Nbs were engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15,

41

a novel trimer constituted of three Nbs, was constructed to be bispecific for human

42

serum albumin (HSA) and RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited sub-ng/ml

43

neutralization potency against the wild-type and currently circulating variants of SARS-

44

CoV-2 with a long half-life in vivo. In addition, we showed that intranasal

45

administration of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 provided 100% protection for both prophylactic and

46

therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2 infection in transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb15-

47

NbH-Nb15 is a potential candidate for both prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2

48

through respiratory administration.

Introduction

69

As of Feb. 1st, 2021, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 100

70

million confirmed cases and over 2.2 million deaths globally. The containment of the

71

expanding COVID-19 pandemic needs multiple countermeasures. Prophylactic

72

vaccines have been recently approved1, and a number of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing

73

monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike

74

protein2-6 were identified, which could be developed as either therapeutic or

75

prophylactic agents.

76
77

In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids also generate heavy-chain-only

78

antibodies (HCAbs), constituting a single variable domain (Nb) specific for binding

79

antigens7. This single variable domain, referred as a single-domain antibody, VHH, or

80

Nanobody (Nb), has higher affinity, thermal stability and chemostability than most

81

antibodies8,9 and can easily be constructed into multivalent formats devoid of Fc, which

82

will overcome potential deleterious antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of

83

infection observed in some viral infections, including Dengue virus, HIV and SARS-

84

CoV10-12. Their favorable biophysical properties have led to the development of several

85

Nbs as therapeutics against viral infection, such as severe fever with thrombocytopenia

86

syndrome virus (SFTSV)13 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)14-16.

87
88

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via the upper respiratory tract17 and analysis of clinical

89

specimens showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected with the highest viral copies in

90

multiple sites of the respiratory tract while few viral copies in the blood18, indicating

91

that biotherapeutic agents directly delivered via respiratory route to the sites of infection

92

would be an attractive alternative to systemic routes of administration. Parenteral

93

inoculation of a biotherapeutic antibody is a particularly ineffective way to deliver

94

drugs to the respiratory tract. Indeed, a study on Mepolizumab (anti-interleukin-5 mAb)

95

demonstrated that only 0.2% of the dose administered reached the lung via systemic

96

administration19. In addition, the therapeutic effect of pulmonary delivery of human

97

immunoglobulins for controlling RSV in cotton rats was shown to be 160 times more

98

effective than that by the parenteral administration20. Thus, pulmonary delivery may be

99

superior to parenteral administration for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

100

A key requirement for pulmonary delivery is the stability of the biologic to endure the

101

degrading environment and thus the drug will have to be formulated to maintain its

102

structural integrity and bioactivity through upper respiratory tract and the lungs. Nbs

103

are delivered directly to the lungs via an inhaler given their small size, simple and robust

104

structure, high thermal stability, and solubility. For instance, ALX-0171, a

105

homotrimeric Nbs, is highly effective in reducing nasal and lung RSV titers via the

106

pulmonary administration of inhalation14,16.

107
108

To date, several Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 were reported for their in vitro activities,

109

but none of them have been evaluated via intranasal administration in animal models21-

110

26

111

alpaca with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Nbs specific for RBD were isolated

112

from a phage library displaying Nbs. We identified three Nbs exhibiting potent

113

neutralization activity against live virus and a panel of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped

114

viruses. To improve efficacy and stability, various configurations of Nbs were

115

engineered. Nb15-NbH-Nb15, a novel bispecific format constituted of three Nbs, was

116

constructed to be tri-valent and bispecific for RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and human serum

117

albumin (HSA). This novel bispecific antibody exhibited potent inhibitory activity

118

against the wild-type and variants of SARS-CoV-2, including the currently circulating

119

variants, such as the predominant mutant viruses in the UK and South Africa with

120

N501Y mutation. In addition, we showed that intranasal administration of Nb15-NbH-

121

Nb15 provided 100% protection in both the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2

122

infected transgenic hACE2 mice. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is a potential candidate for both

123

prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

127

One alpaca was immunized with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S protein (Fig. S1A).

128

Compared to the pre-immunized serum (blank serum), the anti-serum after the third

129

immunization exhibited specific serologic activities against SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD

130

proteins with binding titers of 2.19  106 and 7.29  105, respectively (Fig. S1A and

131

S1B). The immunized serum showed potent neutralization activity against the

132

pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with a half-maximal neutralization dilution (ND50) of

133

~9600 (Fig. S1C), orders of magnitude higher than those of convalescent COVID-19

134

patients27. These data indicate that potent anti-serum specific for RBD with robust

135

neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 was induced in the immunized alpaca.

136
137

Isolation of Nbs with potent neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2

138

To isolate monoclonal Nbs, C9-Nb library, a phage library displaying Nbs from the

139

immunized alpaca, was constructed with a size of 2.0 × 109, 100% sequence diversity,

140

and 96% in-frame rate as validated by PCR and sequencing (Fig. S2A). Nbs specific

141

for SARS-CoV-2 S protein were isolated through 3 rounds of biopanning on the C9-

142

Nb phage library by S protein. The panned library was analyzed by phage ELISA for

143

binding with S protein, and the incremental increase of the OD450 readout from 0.79

144

before enrichment to 1.6, 2.4, and 2.8 after the first, second, and third rounds of

145

enrichment, respectively (Fig. S2B), indicating successful enrichment. To verify

146

whether the enriched library contained specific S-reactive phages, 40 and 46 clones

147

were selected from the libraries after the second and third rounds of enrichment for

148

single-phage ELISA, respectively. The percentage of positive clones was 57.5% and

149

69.6% for the second and third rounds, respectively (Fig. S2C). Among these positive

150

binders, 21 unique Nb sequences were identified according to the sequencing results

151

(Table S1). To further characterize, these 21 Nbs were expressed in mammalian cells

152

by fusing the Nb gene with a human Fc1, which was cloned into the pCDNA3.4 vector

153

to express Nb-Fc antibody (named as Nb-Fc) (Fig. S3A). ELISA results showed that

154

all 21 Nb-Fcs reacted with S protein; among them, 14 Nb-Fcs displayed specific

155

binding with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (Fig. S3B). These results were validated by

156

bio-layer interferometry (BLI), wherein 14 Nb-Fcs exhibited specific binding to RBD

157

with KD values ranging from 37.6 to 4.25 nM (Fig. S3C and S3D). Neutralization

158

analysis showed potent inhibition of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 by culture supernatants

159

of RBD-specific Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc (Fig. S3E).

160
161

Epitope analysis of Nb-Fcs

162

The purified Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc exhibited dose dependent binding with

163

RBD protein on ELISA (Fig. S4A). In addition, Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc likely

164

reacted with conformational structure as their bindings with reduced RBD protein were

165

almost completely abolished (Fig. S4B). The kinetic binding of Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and

166

Nb31-Fc with RBD protein ranged from KD of 1.13 to 1.76 nM, indicating tightly

167

clustered binding characteristics (Fig. 4C-E), which was substantiated by the

168

superimposed ELISA binding curves (Fig. S4A). These three Nb-Fcs were next

169

evaluated for epitope specificity in a competition assay by BLI using RBD protein as a

170

capture antigen. The results revealed that the pre-bound Nb-Fcs efficiently blocked the

171

further binding of the other two Nb-Fcs to RBD protein, suggesting that all three Nb-

172

Fcs likely recognize an overlapping epitope (Fig. S5). Together, Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and

173

Nb31-Fc recognize a quaternary and overlapping epitope on RBD with nanomolar

174

affinities.

175
176

Nb-Fcs exhibiting potent and broad neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 and

177

variants

178

The neutralizing activity of Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc against SARS-CoV-2 live

179

virus was investigated in Vero E6 cells. All three Nb-Fcs exhibited potent neutralization

180

activity with IC50 values in the range of 0.0033-0.0068 μg/ml (41.3-75 pM) and IC90 of

181

0.0156-0.0235μg/ml (195-293.8 pM) (Fig. 1A, Fig. S6 and Table S2). The neutralizing

182

potency was validated by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay with

183

consistent results, with IC50 values of 0.0008, 0.0018 and 0.0023 μg/ml (10, 22.5 and

184

28.8 pM), respectively (Fig. 1B and Table S2). The IC50 values are comparable to those

185

of the most potent neutralizing antibodies or Nbs reported4,21,22,27,28. The cross

186

neutralization of these Nbs against other coronaviruses was also evaluated in

187

pseudovirus assay, and the results showed that these three Nb-Fcs did not inhibit either

188

MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudovirus (Fig. 1C and 1D) but inhibited 15

189

representative variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are identified to represent over 7000

190

unique viral genomes2. In addition, Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and Nb31-Fc also inhibited the

191

replication of recently arising SARS-CoV-2 variants with D614G mutation with similar

192

potency (Fig. 1E-G and Table S2). These evidences demonstrate the broadly

193

neutralizing activity of the Nb-Fcs against SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that the Nb-Fcs

194

target at a highly conserved epitope on RBD protein. Taken together, all these three

195

Nb-Fcs exhibited excellent neutralization potency against the original and the

196

representative variants of SARS-CoV-2 while did not inhibit MERS-CoV and SARS-

197

CoV infection. Given the overlapped epitope recognized by the three Nb-Fcs, Nb15-Fc

198

with the highest neutralization potency was selected for further investigation.

199
200

Construction and characterization of multiple-valent Nb15s.

201

To improve potency, prolong in vivo half-life and avoid potential Fc-mediated ADE, a

202

number of dimeric and trimeric configurations of Nbs were engineered. Monomer

203

(1Nb15), homodimer (2Nb15), homotrimer (3Nb15), and homotetramer (4Nb15)

204

were constructed and analyzed by BLI. The binding of these constructs to RBD protein

205

showed an increasing KD ranging from 12 to <0.001 nM as the valence increased (Fig.

206

S7A and S7B). Multivalent formats of Nb15 were evaluated for neutralization against

207

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Monomeric 1Nb15 exhibited low inhibitory activity with an

208

IC50 of 307 ng/ml (2.3 nM) while the bi-, tri- and tetra-valent configurations exhibited

209

higher neutralization potency than the monomer but comparable potency among the

210

multimers with IC50 values of 2.8, 3.5 and 2.3 ng/ml (11, 9.0, 4.3 pM), respectively (Fig.

211

S7C and Table S3), suggesting that increasing valence does not confer improved anti-

212

viral activity. As such, 3Nb15 was selected for further functional exploration.

213
214
215

Nb15-NbH-Nb15, heterotrimer and bi-specific for RBD and HSA, exhibiting potent
neutralization against SARS-CoV-2.

216

In order to improve efficacy and stability in vivo, we constructed bi-specific Nbs

217

consisting of one Nb specific for HSA (NbH) developed by our lab and one or two Nb15s

218

specific for RBD with (G4S)3 as the linker between each Nb (Fig. 2A) and analyzed

219

their binding and viral inhibitory activities. In addition to the heterodimeric

220

configuration of Nb-NbH that was previously reported29, various new configurations of

221

Nbs were engineered as depicted in Fig. 2A. ELISA analysis showed that all

222

combinations containing Nb15 reacted with RBD protein; among them, heterotrimeric

223

Nb15-Nb15-NbH, NbH-Nb15-Nb15 and Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited better binding with RBD

224

protein than heterodimeric Nb15-NbH and NbH-Nb15 configurations (Fig. 2A and 2B).

225

Furthermore, Nb15-NbH, NbH-Nb15-Nb15 and Nb15-NbH-Nb15 were the best HSA binders

226

as compared to other configurations (Fig. 2A and 2C). Bi-specific Nbs in various

227

configurations were tested for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection; among them,

228

Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited the most potent neutralization of the virus with an IC50 of 0.4

229

ng/ml (9.0 pM) (Fig. 2D and Table S3). We next compared Nb15-NbH-Nb15 with

230

homotrimer Nbs (3Nb15) or Nb-Fc for their binding and anti-viral activities and found

231

that 3Nb15, Nb15-NbH-Nb15 and Nb15-Fc exhibited comparable potency with IC50

232

values of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.9 ng/ml (9.0, 9.0 and 11.3 pM), respectively (Fig. 2E and Table

233

S3).

234
235

Pharmacokinetics and delivery of Nbs constructs

236

Given 3Nb15, Nb15-NbH-Nb15 and Nb15-Fc exhibited comparable neutralization

237

activity (Fig. 2E), these three constructs were evaluated for their in vivo

238

pharmacokinetic activity, and the results showed that, when administrated via i.n., i.p.,

239

or i.v, 3xNb15 was rapidly metabolized as compared to Nb15-Fc and Nb15-NbH-Nb15 (Fig.

240

3A-C); therefore, 3xNb15 was ruled out for further analysis. To determine the tissue

241

distribution of Nbs, YF®750 SE-labeled Nb15-NbH-Nb15 (Nb15-NbH-Nb15-YF750) were

242

administered via i.n., i.p. or i.v. in mouse model. The results revealed that the

243

fluorescence in trachea could be detected only when Nb15-NbH-Nb15-YF750

244

administered i.n.. Furthermore, The fluorescence intensity was higher in lungs when

245

Nb15-NbH-Nb15-YF750 was administered i.n. (6.9 x 1010 ph/s) than that when

246

administered i.p. or i.v. (1.4 x 1010 and 4.3 x 1010 ph/s, respectively) (Fig. 3D and 3E).

247

In addition, the results also showed that Nb15-NbH-Nb15 could reach lungs, and

248

sustained for more than 168 h (7 d) when administrated i.n.; in contrast the fluorescence

249

could only be detected between 1 and 2 h post i.p. infusion (Fig. 3F and 3G). These

250

results suggest that i.n. administration of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 will be a favorable route for

251

antibody to reach nasopharynx and lungs where SARS-CoV-2 replicates. Therefore, to

252

avoid the potential ADE associated by Fc in the Nb-Fc, we selected Nb15-NbH-Nb15 for

253

further efficacy evaluation in vivo.

254
255

In vitro characterization of Nb15-NbH-Nb15

256

Nb15-NbH-Nb15 was further characterized in vitro. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited specific

257

binding to RBD and HSA with KD values of 0.54 and 7.7nM, respectively. In addition,

258

Nb15-NbH-Nb15 also showed specific binding with murine serum albumin (MSA) with

259

KD values of 14.5 nM, indicating that mice can be used as an animal model to

260

investigate the half-life of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 (Fig. 4A-B and Fig. S8). Furthermore, Nb15-

261

NbH-Nb15 exhibited sub-ng/ml (pM) potency against both the wild-type and currently

262

circulating mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4C and Table S2). Importantly, Nb15-

263

NbH-Nb15 showed comparable potency against the SARS-CoV-2 variants with D614G

264

and N501Y mutations that circulate predominantly in the UK and South Africa. D614G

265

and N501Y variants conferred enhanced replication and transmissibility and emerged

266

as the predominant global variants with high transmission30. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 also

267

showed excellent thermal stability by retaining 100% and 83% activities even at 70 oC

268

and 80 oC for one hour, respectively (Fig. 4D-E and Table S4). Furthermore, Nb15-NbH-

269

Nb15 retained 100% activity after aerosolization, indicating the potential application as

a nebulized drug (Fig. 4D-E and Table S4).

To evaluate the efficacy of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 in vivo, hACE2 transgenic mice were

challenged with SARS-CoV-2, and Nb15-NbH-Nb15 was administrated i.n. either before

275

or after viral challenge for prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy (Fig. 5A). Viral RNA

276

was detected in lungs in the control mice (6.28  105 copies/mg on average in SARS-

277

CoV-2 group, n=5) and the isotype treated control mice (7.8  104 copies/mg on average

278

in isotype group, n=3,). For the prophylactic group, no viral RNA or infected cells was

279

detected in 100% (5/5) of the mice when 250 μg (average of 10 mg/kg) Nb15-NbH-Nb15

280

was administrated via i.n. 24 hours before SARS-CoV-2 infection (Nb15-NbH-Nb15 -

281

24h group, n=5), as evidenced by real-time PCR and immunofluorence staining (Fig.

282

5B-D). 100% mice were also completely protected when 250 μg Nb15-NbH-Nb15 were

283

administrated via i.n. 1 hour postinfection, as no viral RNA and infected cells were

284

detected in all infected mice (Nb15-NbH-Nb15 1h group, n=5) (Fig. 5B-D). Significantly

285

lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies (9.98 x103 copies/mg on average) were detected in

286

the lungs of the mice treated with Nb15-NbH-Nb15 i.n. 24 h postinfection (Nb15-NbH-

287

Nb15 24 h group, n=5) than that in the control mice (6.28  105 copies/mg on average

288

in SARS-CoV-2 group and 7.8  104 copies/mg in isotype control) (Fig. 5B-D). Nb15-

289

Fc inhibited viral replication and reduced the viral copies number (average of 7.59 103

290

copies/mg in Nb15-Fc 1h group, n=5) but failed to provide complete protection under

291

the same condition as Nb15-NbH-Nb15 (Fig. 5B-D). Furthermore, histopathological

292

analysis of lung tissues showed that SARS-CoV-2 challenge induced severe lung

293

lesions, as shown by the infiltration of inflammatory cells and thickened alveolar septa

294

(Fig. 5D). In contrast, the lungs of the mice receiving Nb15-NbH-Nb15 or Nb15-Fc

295

treatment showed no apparent pathological changes (Fig. 5D). Together, Nb15-NbH-

296

Nb15 at an average of 10 mg/kg via i.n. administrated 24 h before or 1 h after challenge

297

provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and significantly

298

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication when the antibody was administrated 24 h

299

postinfection. Nb15-Fc used at an average of 10 mg/kg via i.n. administrated 1 h after

300

challenge significantly reduced viral load but failed to provide complete protection. We

301

noted that those mice receiving Nb15s treatment showed less weight loss than the control

302

mice but did not achieve statistical difference (Fig. 5E-F). These results indicate that

303

Nb15-NbH-Nb15, when used early during infection, confered higher protection efficacy

304

than used at later time point. In summary, the Nb15-NbH-Nb15 configuration

305

administered via i.n. was superior to Nb15-Fc and exhibited both prophylactic and

306

therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

307
308

Discussion:

309

In this study, three potent neutralizing Nb-Fcs were isolated from a phage display

310

platform derived from an SARS-CoV-2 S protein immunized alpaca. These three RBD-

311

specific Nb-Fcs exhibited potent inhibitory activities against 15 mutant variants of

312

SARS-CoV-2 at ng/ml concentration (Fig. 1E-G and Table S2). The IC50 values are

313

comparable to those of the most potent neutralizing antibodies, or Nbs

314

reported4,21,22,27,28. These 15 representative variants of SARS-CoV-2 are identified to

315

represent over 7000 unique viral genomes 2. More importantly, recently arising variants

316

with D614G mutation were also sensitive to the neutralization by Nb15-Fc, Nb22-Fc and

317

Nb31-Fc with similar sensitivity (Fig. 1E-G and Table S2). These evidences

318

demonstrate the broadly neutralizing activity of these Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 and

319

suggest that the Nb-Fcs target at a highly conserved epitope on RBD protein.

320
321

To improve potency, prolong in vivo half-life and avoid potential Fc-mediated ADE ,

322

NbH specific for HSA and MSA was used to construct a trimeric Nb15 (Nb15-NbH-Nb15)

323

for SARS-CoV-2, and the resulting Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited the highest neutralization

324

potency with the IC50 value of 0.4 ng/ml among other configurations, including Nb15-

325

NbH, a configuration reported earlier29. Interestingly, we found that Nb15-NbH and NbH-

326

Nb15 with the same components exhibited distinct neutralization potencies with IC50

327

values of 552.3 ng/ml and 197.4 ng/ml. In addition, NbH-Nb15-Nb15 and Nb15-Nb15-NbH

328

also displayed distinct neutralization potencies with IC50 values of 25.1 ng/ml and 8

329

ng/ml (Fig. 2D and Table S3), indicating that Nb configuration has impact on the

330

neutralizing activity. In addition, heterotrimeric bispecific configuration is superior to

331

the bispecific heterodimer. We also noted that the bi-, tri- and tetra-valent

332

configurations exhibited comparable potency with IC50 values of 2.8, 3.5 and 2.3 ng/ml

333

(11, 9.0, 4.3 pM), respectively. The neutralizing potency did not correspond to the

334

valence increase when there are two or more than two Nb15s though monomeric 1xNb15

335

had much lower inhibitory activity (Fig. S7C and Table S3). Noted that Nb15-NbH-Nb15

336

shows higher potency than NbH-Nb15-Nb15, Nb15-Nb15-NbH, and all the homomultimers,

337

suggesting that the position of NbH plays important roles in neutralization activity. We

338

speculate that in Nb15-NbH-Nb15 NbH may space out the two Nb15s to either avoid cross

339

intereference with each other or allow better binding of the trimeric Nb to S proteins on

340

the viral particle. Furthermore, Nb15-NbH-Nb15 displayed comparable neutralizing

341

potency as those of Nb15-Fc and 3xNb15, and higher neutralization potency and longer

342

half-life than 3xNb15 in vivo when delivered via i.n. , i.p. or i.v.. Importantly, Nb15-NbH-

343

Nb15 exhibited broadly neutralizing activities against all the SARS-CoV-2 variants that

344

we tested, including those with D614G and N501Y mutations that currently circulate

345

in the UK and South Africa. These mutant viruses conferred enhanced replication,

346

transmissibility and emerged as the global predominant circulating variants and are

347

great public health concerns30.

348
349

Though several neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are in various stages of

350

the clinical trials or have been approved as an emergency therapy; most of these

351

antibodies are of limited efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first

352

to demonstrate the efficacy of Nb for both the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-

353

2 infection (Fig. 5). SARS-CoV-2 is mainly present in the nasopharynx and lungs31,32.

354

Differing from many previously reported systemic delivery route, Nb15-NbH-Nb15 was

355

delivered to the site of infection. Direct administration to the airways is likely to provide

356

faster and more robust antiviral activity in the respiratory tract, where the virus gains

357

entry and replicate

358

efficient drug delivery to the main site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e., the upper and

359

lower respiratory tract32. Indeed, the therapeutic effect of topical administration of

360

ALX-0171 displayed promising results in reducing the RSV viral load14,16. To our best

361

knowledge, the current study is the first to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of Nbs against

362

SARS-CoV-2 infection via intranasal delivery.

363

16,32

, as intranasal delivery has been shown to result in fast and

364

In summary, comparing to the configurations of Nb-NbH, Nb-Fc and Nb homotrimer, a

365

novel construct of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited higher neutralization activity and longer

366

half life in vivo. Nb15-NbH-Nb15 exhibited highly potent antiviral activity with broad

367

specificity against a large panel of SARS-CoV-2 clinical variants. Furthermore, direct

368

delivery of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 to the airways/lungs by intranasal route proved an effective

369

mode of drug delivery, and the outstanding thermal stability of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is an

370

additional advantage. We suggest that respiratory delivery of Nb15-NbH-Nb15 is a

371

promising route for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus

372

warrants further clinical evaluation.

Materials and Methods

377

1. Alpaca immunization

378

250 μg the extracellular domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein fused with His tag

379

(S1+S2 ECD, S, cat.# 40589-V08B1, Sino Biological) was emulsified with 250 μl

380

Freund's complete adjuvant (F5881-10ML, Sigma) to immunize an alpaca. On day 14

381

and 28, the alpaca was boosted twice with 250 μg S protein in 250 μl Freund's

382

incomplete adjuvant (F5506-10ML, Sigma). One week following the 2nd immunization,

383

we collected the blood samples to measure anti-serum titer. One week after the 3rd

384

immunization, 100 ml of blood was collected to measure anti-serum titer and construct

385

a phage library displaying Nb.

386
387

2. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (WB):

388

The purified protein or antibody was separated by electrophoresis in a 7.5%-12%

389

polyacrylamide gel. The separated protein or antibody was revealed either using

390

Coomassie blue or transferred to PVDF membrane for WB analysis under reducing or

391

non-reducing conditions with β-mercaptoethanol. The membrane was first blocked and

392

then incubated overnight at 4 oC or 37 oC for one hour with diluted plasma or antibody,

393

followed by incubation with the secondary antibody of either anti-human IgG or anti-

394

rabbit IgG conjugated with an IRDye 800CW (cat.# 926-32232, Rockland). Protein

395

bands were visualized using the Odyssey Image System (Li-COR).

396
397

3. ELISA analysis.

398

Anti-sera titer and antibody characterization or antibody quantification in vivo were

399

examined by ELISA as reported in our previously published method33 with

400

modifications. In brief, the protein was coated to high protein-binding ELISA plates

401

(Corning) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, 100 μl per well at 37 °C for 2 hours (h) or 4

402

o

403

and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing 2-4 times, 100 μl serially diluted anti-

404

serum or purified antibody was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Following

405

washing, goat anti-llama IgG (H+L) secondary antibody with HRP (Novus, cat.#

406

NB7242, 1:10000 dilution) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Accordingly,

407

3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma) substrate was added at 37 oC for 10

408

minutes (min); and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl 0.2 M H2SO4. The optical

409

densities at 450 nm were measured using the Infinite 200 (Tecan, Ramsey, MN, USA).

410

Antibody titers were defined as the highest dilution when the diluted serum produced

411

at least 2.1-fold optical density readout as compared to the control serum sample at the

412

same dilution.

C overnight. After washing, blocking buffer with 5% non-fat milk in PBS was added

413
414

4. Construction of a phage library displaying Nbs

415

Nb phage library was constructed following our previously published method with

416

some modifications13. In brief, PBMCs were isolated from 100 ml blood of immunized

417

alpaca using a lymphocyte separation solution (cat.# 17-1140-02, Ficoll-Paque Plus,

418

GE). RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into cDNA by oligo (dT) and random

419

hexamers as primers using the TRIzol kit (cat.# 15596018, Ambio By Life

420

Technologies), following manufacturer’s instruction. The alpaca Nb gene was

421

amplified with the combination of primers and cloned into phV1 phagemid plasmid (Y-

422

Clone, Ltd., China) to transform TG1 bacteria.

424

5. Panning Nb phage library and phage ELISA

425

Affinity selection for S-binding recombinant phages was performed as previously

426

reported with the following modifications34. The Nb-phagemid-transformed bacteria

427

were rescued with M13KO7 helper phage (cat.# 18311019, Invitrogen), and

428

precipitated with PEG/NaCl. The phage Nb antibody library was enriched three times

429

with 50 μg/ml of S protein. The enriched phage was eluted, transformed, and selected

430

for the monoclonal phage to be evaluated by phage ELISA.

431
432

6. Phage ELISA

433

200 ng S or RBD protein in coating buffer (pH 9.6) was used to coat 96-well plates

434

(cat.# 9018, Corning) at 4 oC overnight. After washing, the plates were blocked with

435

blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBST) for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated with library

436

phages or single clone phage in bacterial supernatant at 4 °C for 1.5 h. After washing,

437

an anti-M13 bacteriophage antibody with HRP (1:10000 dilution, cat.# 11973-

438

MM05T-H, Sino Biological) was added and incubated at 37 oC for 1 h. Accordingly,

439

TMB substrate(Sigma) was added at 37 oC for 10 min; 10 μl 0.2 M H2SO4 was added

440

to stop the reaction. Optical densities were measured at 450 nm using the Infinite 200

441

(Tecan, Ramsey, MN, USA). Clones with readout at 450 nm >0.5 were sequenced.

442
443

7. Expression and purification of Nbs with different formats

444

To facilitate the purification and prolong the half-life of the Nb antibody, the Fc1 gene

445

(CH2-CH3) of the human monoclonal antibody was fused with the Nb gene (Nb-Fc),

446

as our previously published method13. In addition, to improve the activity of Nb, we

447

constructed Nbs with various configurations wherein (GGGGS)3 linkers were

448

introduced between Nbs in dimeric and trimeric forms. To facilitate protein purification,

449

a 6xHis-tag was fused to the N terminus of the Nbs of monomeric, dimeric or trimeric

450

configuration. The Nbs with different configurations were finally cloned into the

451

pCDNA3.4 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen), which were transfected into

452

293F cells to produce Nbs with different configurations. Nb fused with Fc, or His tag

453

was purified using Protein G (cat.# 20399, Thermo Scientific) and Ni-NTA (cat.#

454

R901100, Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively.

455
456

8. Neutralization activity of Nbs against pseudovirus

457

Pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed as previously described with the

458

following modifications4. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV pseudoviruses

459

were produced by co-transfection of pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-, an HIV-1 NL4-3 luciferase

460

reporter vector that contains defective Nef, Env and Vpr (HIV AIDS Reagent Program),

461

and pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expression vectors encoding the respective spike proteins

462

(MN988668.1 for SARS-CoV-2, AAP13567.1 for SARS-CoV, AFS88936.1 for

463

MERS-CoV) into 293T cells (ATCC). Pseudovirus containing supernatants were

464

collected after 48 h, and viral titers were measured by luciferase assay in relative light

465

units (Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay Vector System, Promega Biosciences). S genes of

466

SARS-CoV-2 variants with indicated mutations based on the human codon optimized

467

S gene (Accession number: MN988668.1) were synthesized, and the corresponding

468

pseudoviruses were produced following above protocol. For neutralization assay,

469

SNB02 (Nb-Fc) against SFTSV13 served as a control. Neutralization assays were

470

performed by incubating pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of purified Nbs or serum

471

at 37 °C for 1 h. HEK293T-ACE2 cells (cat.# 41107ES03, Yeasen Biotech Co., Ltd.

472

China) for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, Huh7 cells (ATCC) for MERS-CoV

473

(approximately 1.5×104 per well) were then added in duplicate to the virus-antibody

474

mixture. Half-maximal inhibitory dilution (ND50) of the evaluated sera or half-maximal

475

inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the evaluated Nbs were determined by luciferase

476

activity 48 h after exposure to virus-antibody mixture, and analyzed by GraphPad Prism

477

8.01 (GraphPad Software Inc.).

478
479

9. Neutralization activity of Nbs against live SARS-CoV-2

480

SARS-CoV-2 focus reduction neutralization test was performed in a certified Biosafety

481

Level 3 laboratory, as previously described with the following modifications6. Briefly,

482

a clinical isolate (Beta/Shenzhen/SZTH-003/2020, EPI_ISL_406594 at GISAID)

483

previously obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab of an infected patient was used for

484

the analysis. Serial concentrations of Nbs were mixed with 75 μl of SARS-CoV-2

485

(8×103 focus forming unit/ml, FFU/ml) in 96-well microwell plates and incubated at

486

37 °C for 1 h. The mixtures were then transferred to 96-well plates seeded with Vero

487

E6 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, the inoculums were removed prior to the

488

addition of the overlay media (100 μl MEM containing 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose,

489

CMC) and the plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4%

490

paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min, and then the overlays were removed. Cells were

491

permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with cross-reactive rabbit anti-

492

SARS-CoV-N IgG (Sino Biological, Inc) for 1 h at room temperature before the

493

addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson

494

ImmunoResearch) and further incubated at room temperature. The foci were stained

495

with KPL TrueBlue Peroxidase substrates (SeraCare Life Sciences Inc.) and were

496

counted with an EliSpot reader (Cellular Technology Ltd.).

497
498

10. Affinity determination by Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI)

499

Affinity assays were performed on a ForteBio OctetRED 96 biolayer interferometry

500

instrument (Molecular Devices ForteBio LLC, Fremont, CA) at 25 oC with shaking at

501

1,000 rpm. To measure the affinity of Nbs with human Fc tag, anti-human Fc (AHC)

502

biosensors (cat.# 18-5060, Fortebio) were hydrated in water for 30 min prior to 60

503

seconds (sec) incubation in a kinetic buffer (PBS, 0.02% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.0).

504

Either Nb-Fc in cell supernatant or purified Nb-Fcs were loaded in a kinetic buffer for

505

200 sec prior to baseline equilibration for 200 sec in a kinetic buffer. Association of

506

SARS-CoV-2 RBD in a two-fold dilution series from 20 nM to 2.5 nM was performed

507

prior to dissociation for 180 sec. To measure the affinity of Nbs without Fc tag, RBD

508

protein was coupled to AR2G biosensor (cat.# 18-5092, Fortebio) via BLI instrument

509

according to the instructions of the amino coupling kit. Association of Nbs in a serial

510

dilution was performed prior to dissociation for 180 sec. After each cycle, the

511

biosensors were regenerated via 3 short pulses of 5 sec each of 100 mM pH 2.7 glycine-

512

HCL followed by running buffer. The data were baseline subtracted before fitting

513

performed using a 1:1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. KD, Ka

514

and Kd values were evaluated with a global fit applied to all data.

515
516

11. Epitope binning by BLI

517

The epitope binning assay was performed with AR2G biosensor (cat.# 18-5092,

518

Fortebio) following the manufacturer’s protocol ‘in-tandem assay’ as previously

519

reported4. After loading the RBD protein, a saturating concentration of antibody or Nbs

520

(50 μg/ml) as the first antibody was added for 300 sec following with the baseline step

521

with 30 s immersion in 0.02% PBST. The second competing concentration of antibody

522

or Nb (50 μg/ml) was then added for 300 sec to measure binding in the presence of the

523

first saturating antibody or Nb. GraphPad was used to illustrate the time-response

524

course of two antibodies binding to RBD protein.

526

12. Evaluating the efficacy of Nbs in SARS-CoV-2 infected hACE2 mice.

527

A total of 31 8-week-old male transgenic hACE2 mice (C57BL/6J) (cat.# T037630,

528

GemPharmatech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 as

529

previously reported35 with following modifications. The mice were split into seven

530

groups (n=3-5) for either prophylactic or therapeutic evaluation, as described in Fig.

531

5A. Mice without any challenge and treatment served as blank control (No SARS-CoV-

532

2, n=4). Mice challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were taken as infection control (SARS-

533

CoV-2, n=5). 250 μg SNB02 (Y-Clone, China), an anti-SFTSV antibody constructed

534

by Nb fused with human Fc1 (Nb-Fc)13, was intranasally injected 1 h after infection

535

and served as an isotype treated control (Isotype). For the prophylactic group, mice

536

were intranasally injected with Nb15-NbH-Nb15 at a dose of 250 μg/mouse (average of

537

10 mg/kg) 24 h before infection (Nb15-NbH-Nb15 -24h, n=5). For the therapeutic group,

538

mice were intranasally injected with N Nb15-NbH-Nb15 at a dose of 250 μg/mouse

539

(average of 10 mg/kg) 1 h or 24 h after infection (named as Nb15-NbH-Nb15 1h and

540

Nb15-NbH-Nb15 24 h, n=5, respectively). As a comparison, Nb15-Fc at a dose of 250

541

μg/mouse (average of 10 mg/kg) was intranasally injected 1 h after infection (Nb15-Fc

542

1 h). Body weight of every mouse was measured daily. Transgenic hACE2 mice

13. Viral load measurement by quantitative RT-PCR.

549

Viral load was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on RNA extracted

550

from the supernatant of lung homogenates as described previously36. Briefly, lung

551

homogenates were prepared by homogenizing perfused whole lung using an electric

552

homogenizer. The supernatant was collected, and total RNA was extracted. Each RNA

553

sample was reverse transcribed to 50 μl cDNA with RT-PCR Prime Script Kit (Takara).

554

The cDNA (5 μl) was used in a 25 μl qRT-PCR reaction with the TaqMan Universal

557

the orf1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 (5′- GTGARATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG -3′ and 5′-

558

CARATGTTAAASACACTATTAGCATA -3′). The samples were run in triplicate on

559

an ABI 7900 Real-Time System (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The

560

following cycling conditions were used: 1 cycle of 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle of 95 °C

561

for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec and 58 °C for 1 min. The virus titer was

562

determined by comparison with a standard curve generated using RNA extracted from
