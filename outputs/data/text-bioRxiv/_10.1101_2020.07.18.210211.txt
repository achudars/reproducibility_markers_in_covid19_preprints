ABSTRACT

26

Therapeutics targeting replication of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed.

27

Coronaviruses rely on host membranes for entry, establishment of replication centers and egress.

28

Compounds targeting cellular membrane biology and lipid biosynthetic pathways have

29

previously shown promise as antivirals and are actively being pursued as treatments for other

30

conditions. Here, we tested small molecule inhibitors that target membrane dynamics or lipid

31

metabolism. Included were inhibitors of the PI3 kinase VPS34, which functions in autophagy,

32

endocytosis and other processes; Orlistat, an inhibitor of lipases and fatty acid synthetase, is

33

approved by the FDA as a treatment for obesity; and Triacsin C which inhibits long chain fatty

34

acyl-CoA synthetases. VPS34 inhibitors, Orlistat and Triacsin C inhibited virus growth in Vero

35

E6 cells and in the human airway epithelial cell line Calu-3, acting at a post-entry step in the

36

virus replication cycle. Of these the VPS34 inhibitors exhibit the most potent activity.

INTRODUCTION

47

SARS-CoV-2, a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, is an enveloped positive-sense,

48

RNA virus responsible for a current pandemic1. Because of its profound impact on society and

49

human health there is an urgent need to understand SARS-CoV-2 replication requirements and to

50

identify therapeutic strategies2. Repurposing drugs developed for other purposes may provide a

51

shortcut to therapeutic development3-6. The use of compounds known to target specific host

52

factors may also elucidate key pathways needed for virus replication.

53

Coronavirus (CoV) replication involves multiple critical interactions with host cell

54

membranes, including during viral entry and virus release2,

7-9

55

striking features of CoV infection is the establishment of replication organelles that consist of

56

double membrane vesicles (DMV), double-membrane spherules (DMSs) and convoluted

57

membranes (CM) with DMVs serving as the main site of viral RNA synthesis 10. The origin of

58

these membrane organelles in beta-coronavirus infection remains incompletely understood. The

59

membrane structures colocalize with LC3, a protein with well-known functions in autophagy 7, 11.

60

In murine embryonic stem cell lines, autophagy was found to be critical for DMV formation and

61

replication of the beta-coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus 7. However, studies in bone marrow

62

derived macrophages or primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking ATG5 indicated that

63

autophagy is not essential for DMV formation or MHV replication 11. An alternate model

64

indicates that beta coronaviruses usurp vesicles known as EDEMosomes, which associate with

65

non-lipidated LC3 and normally function to regulate ER-associated degradation (ERAD), to

66

provide membranes for replication8.

. In addition, one of the most

67

Many enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that replicate in double membrane

68

compartments have been demonstrated to be sensitive to inhibitors of various aspects of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.210211; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

69

membrane metabolism/biology. For example, VPS34 a class III phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)

70

that plays roles in autophagy, endosomal trafficking, and other aspects of membrane biology has

71

been implicated in the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and tombusvirus (TBSV) 12, 13. The

72

compound Triacsin C, which inhibits an enzyme upstream of triglyceride synthesis, long chain

73

fatty acyl CoA, impairs the growth of several viruses that require for replication lipid droplets,

74

organelles that serve as storage sites for neutral lipids such as triacylglycerol 14-16. Downstream of

75

long chain fatty acyl CoA in the synthesis of triglycerides are diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1

76

and 2 (DGAT1 and DGAT2). Inhibition of these enzymes inhibits HCV and rotavirus

77

replication. More general inhibitors of fatty acid synthetase such as Orlistat, also decrease

78

replication of several different viruses17-20.

79

Here we asked whether SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to modulators of lipid metabolism by

80

assessing the sensitivity of the virus in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells to VPS34 inhibitors, Triacsin C,

81

inhibitors of DGATs and Orlistat, an inhibitor of FASN21. We find that two inhibitors of VPS34

82

potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas an FDA-approved inhibitor of a different

83

class of PI3K had minimal effect on replication. Targeting FASN and de novo synthesis of

84

triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol and cholesterol esters each impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication

85

whereas inhibition of DGATs was not effective. We also identified that each inhibitor exhibits

86

antiviral effects post-entry and that they perturb the structure of viral replication centers. Taken

87

together, the data presented here implicates specific lipid metabolism pathways in SARS-CoV-2

88

replication and suggests that these pathways are promising therapeutic targets.

91

Virus and cell lines

92

Vero E6 (ATCC# CRL-1586), Calu-3 (ATCC# HTB-55), and Caco-2 (ATCC# HTB-37)

93

were maintained in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine

94

serum (FBS; GIBCO). Cells were kept in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator without antibiotics or

95

antimycotics. SARS-CoV-2, strain USA_WA1/2020, was obtained from the World Reference

96

Collection for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch-

97

Galveston.

98

Virus Propagation and Plaque Assays

99

A lyophilized ampule of SARS-CoV-2 was initially resuspended in DMEM

100

supplemented with 2% FBS. VeroE6 cells were inoculated in duplicate with a dilution of 1:100

101

with an adsorption period of 1 hour at 37C and shaking every 15 minutes. Cells were observed

102

for cytopathic effect (CPE) every 24 hours. Stock SARS-CoV-2 virus was harvested at 72 hours

103

post infection (h.p.i) and supernatants were collected, clarified, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C.

104

For plaque assays, Vero E6 cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate 24 hours before

105

infection. 100ul of SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions were added, adsorbed for 1 hour at 37C with

106

shaking at 15-minute intervals. After the absorption period, 1 mL of 0.6% microcrystalline

107

cellulose (MCC; Sigma 435244) in serum-free DMEM was added. To stain plaque assays MCC

108

was removed by aspiration, and 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) added for one hour at

109

room temp and then removed. Monolayers were then washed with water and stained with 0.4%

110

crystal violet. Plaques were quantified and recorded as plaque forming units (PFU)/mL.

111

Confocal microscopy

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.210211; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

112

For confocal microscopy analysis, all cell lines were pre-seeded 24 hours before infection

113

onto glass coverslips and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At

114

24 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) supernatant was removed, and samples fixed with 10% NBF for 1

115

hour at room temperature followed by PBS wash and permeabilized with sterile filtered 0.1%

116

Saponin in PBS. Cells were blocked with 0.1% Saponin in Fluorescent Blocker (ThermoFisher)

117

for 1 hour at RT. Primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4C. AlexaFluor488,

118

594, and 647 conjugated secondary antibodies were used and nuclei stained with DAPI. Samples

119

were imaged on Zeiss LSM800 Confocal with Super Resolution AiryScan. Images were

120

rendered in ZenBlue or Imaris Viewer 9.0.

121

Maestro Z Impedance Experiments

122

Prior to cell plating, CytoView-Z 96-well electrode plates (Axion BioSystems, Atlanta,

123

GA) were coated with 5 µg/mL human fibronectin (Corning) for 1 hr at 37C. After coating,

124

fibronectin was removed and 100 µL of DMEM/10% FBS was added to each well. The plate was

125

then docked into the Maestro Z instrument to measure impedance electrode baseline. Vero E6

126

cells were then plated to confluency (~75,000 cells/well) in the coated CytoView-Z plates and

127

left at room temperature for 1 hour to ensure even coverage of the well. Plates containing Vero

128

E6 cells were then docked into the Maestro Z for 24 hours at 37°C/5% CO 2 to allow the cells to

129

attach and the monolayer to stabilize, as measured by resistance, a component of impedance. The

130

Maestro Z was used to monitor the resistance of the monolayer as it formed, very similar to

131

transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)22. In this study, resistance was measured at 10 kHz,

132

which reflects both cell coverage over the electrode and strength of the barrier formed by the cell

133

monolayer. For compound treatments, media was removed from wells of the CytoView-Z plates

134

and 195 µL of pre-warmed DMEM/2% FBS was added with the indicated concentration of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.210211; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

135

compound. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 were carried out by directly adding

136

5 µL of virus to each well. Plates were then docked within the Maestro Z and resistance

137

measurements were continuously recorded for 48-72 hours post-infection. All plates contained

138

media only, full lysis, uninfected, and SARS-CoV-2 infected controls. For calculation of percent

139

inhibition, raw resistance values for each well were normalized to the value at 1 hour post-

140

infection within the Axis Z software, and percent inhibition was calculated with the following

141

formula: Percent Inhibition = 100*(1-(1- average of treated cells)/(1-average of infected

142

control)). Median time to death calculations were performed by fitting the Boltzmann sigmoid

143

equation to raw kinetic resistance data in Graphpad Prism. Fifty percent maximum velocity

144

(V50) values obtained from the Boltzmann sigmoid fits were used to determine median time to

145

death for each MOI.

146

Cell viability assay

147

VeroE6 or Calu-3 cells were seeded in 96-well black walled microplates and incubated

148

overnight. Cells were then treated with compounds and CellTox Green Dye (Promega) to

149

monitor compound cytotoxicity. Fluorescence (Excitation: 485nm, Emission: 520nm) was

150

measured every 24 hours post treatment for 3 days. Percent viability was determined using the

151

minimum fluorescence obtained from media only cells and the maximum value obtained by cells

152

lysed with 1% Triton-X.

153

Labeling of nascent viral RNA

154

VeroE6 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated overnight at 37C. Cells

155

were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 3. At 24 h.p.i. cells were treated with 1µM

156

of Actinomycin D (Sigma) for 1 hour. Nascent RNA was labeled using Click-iT™ RNA

Alexa Fluor™ 594 Imaging Kit (ThermoFisher). Cells were then processed for confocal

analysis.

159

Compounds

160

VPS34 IN-1 (#17392), PIK-III (#17002), Triacsin C (#10007448), and

161

Orlistat (#10005426) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor,

162

Michigan). Remdesivir was purchased from Target Molecule Corp. (T7766, Boston,

163

Massachusetts). T863 (#SML0539) and PF06424439 (#PZ0233) were purchased from Sigma-

164

Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri). All chemicals were resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide

165

(DMSO).

RESULTS

167

Development of 96-well format assay to measure SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effects

23

168

SARS-CoV-2 induces significant cytopathic effects in infected Vero E6 cells. Based on

169

this property, we standardized a 96-well format assay that provides continuous real-time, label-

170

free monitoring of the integrity of cell monolayers, thereby providing assessment of virus growth

171

through decreased cell viability. This assay was standardized using the Maestro Z platform

172

(Axion BioSystems, Atlanta, GA), an instrument that uses 96-well plates containing electrodes in

173

each well (CytoView-Z plates). The electrodes measure electrical impedance across the cell

174

monolayer every minute throughout the course of the experiment. As SARS-CoV-2 replication

175

damages the cell monolayer, impedance measurements decrease over time, providing a detailed

176

assessment of infection kinetics.

177

The capacity of the system to differentiate different levels of virus replication was first

178

assessed. Confluent Vero E6 monolayers in CytoView-Z plates were infected with SARS-CoV-2

179

at multiple MOIs (10 to 0.0001) and resistance measurements were acquired for 72 hours post-

180

infection. As shown in Figure 1A, the progression of infection at each MOI was clearly distinct.

181

A decrease in resistance could be observed as early as 18-20 h.p.i. at an MOI of 10 and 1, and as

182

late as 56 h.p.i. at an MOI of 0.0001. Depending on MOI, signals reached their nadirs between

183

32 to 72 h.p.i. To correlate with a decrease in resistance, the raw kinetic data was used to

184

determine the median time to cell death for each MOI (Figure 1B). Based on its desirable

185

kinetics, the MOI of 0.01 was chosen for the screening of compounds for antiviral activities.

186

To establish the Maestro Z as a potential instrument for screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2

187

therapeutics, we first tested Remdesivir, a well-described inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 that has been

188

granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the treatment of COVID-1924, 25. Vero E6 cells

189

were seeded on a CytoView-Z plate, incubated overnight to allow cells to stabilize, pretreated

190

with 6-fold dilutions of Remdesivir for 1 hour and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Resistance

191

measurements were recorded for 48 h.p.i. (Figure 1C). In agreement with previous studies, we

192

determined an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for Remdesivir of 1.54 µM (Figure 1D)24.

193

Taken together, these data validate the impedance-based assay described as a tool for screening

194

of potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

195

Inhibitors of VPS34 activity impair SARS-CoV-2 growth

196

VPS34 is a multifunctional protein involved in autophagy and membrane trafficking.

197

Since coronaviruses induce formation of double membrane vesicles for replication, we wanted to

198

determine if VPS34 activity was essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Therefore, we tested two

199

well characterized VPS34 inhibitors IN-1 (referred as VPS34-IN1 below) and PIK-III over a 10-

200

point dose response in the resistance assay26. The compounds were added to pre-plated Vero E6

201

cells 1 hour prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.01. Both VPS34-IN1 and PIK-III

202

induced rapid cytotoxicity at 50 µM and 16.67 µM as indicated by a rapid decrease in resistance

203

measurements between 1 and 20 h.p.i. (Figure 2A and 2C). However, at concentrations of 5.56

204

µM and below, the integrity of the monolayer was preserved relative to the mock-treated control

205

indicating an antiviral effect and an absence of cytotoxicity. Calculations based on normalized

206

resistance measurements at 48 h.p.i for non-toxic doses yielded IC50s of 0.29uM for VPS34-IN1

207

and 0.202uM for PIK-III (Figure 2B and 2D, respectively). Additionally, IC90s of 2.52 µM

208

(VPS34-IN1) and 1.81 µM (PIK-III) were also calculated. These data suggest that the VPS34

209

kinase plays a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 replication and is a potential target for therapeutic

210

intervention.

211

Inhibition of fatty acid metabolism inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication

212

Fatty acid metabolism leads to production of triglycerides, phospholipids and other

213

molecules27. Elongation of the phospholipid membranes can be aided by channeling fatty acid

214

into phospholipid synthesis28. Modulation of fatty acid metabolism has been shown to impact

215

several viruses such as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, and Old World alphaviruses 18, 29, 30. Two

216

well-described compounds that inhibit fatty acid metabolism are Orlistat and Triacsin C, both of

217

which have been shown to have antiviral activity19, 30. Orlistat is an FDA-approved drug that

218

inhibits lipases and also fatty acid synthase (FASN), and Triacsin C inhibits long chain Acyl-

219

CoA synthetases. To test these against SARS-CoV-2, VeroE6 cells were pre-seeded onto a

220

CytoView-Z plate, allowed to stabilize and then pre-treated with Triacsin C or Orlistat for 1 hour

221

before infection with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01. Based on the toxicity window of 1-20

222

h.p.t. determined with the VPS34 inhibitors, neither Triacsin C nor Orlistat induced early

223

cytotoxic effects, even at the highest concentrations of 50uM and 500uM, respectively (Figure

224

3A and 3C). Both compounds exhibited inhibition at the higher concentrations tested, although

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.18.210211; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

225

complete inhibition was not achieved even with 500 µM of Orlistat. Based on the data we

226

extrapolated an IC50 of 422.3uM for Orlistat and calculated an IC50 of 19.5uM for Triacsin C

227

(Figure 3B and 3D). Viruses such as HCV and rotavirus that are sensitive to inhibition by

228

Triacsin C are also impaired by inhibitors of DGATs14, 31. Therefore, we tested the effects of

229

DGAT1 and DGAT2 inhibitors T863 and PF0642443932, 33. Neither compound displayed any

230

inhibitory activity (Supplemental Figure 1). This data suggests that metabolism of fatty acids

231

plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

232

VPS34 inhibitors exhibit potent attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 early and late in its replication

233

cycle

234

Next, time-of-addition studies were performed. We sought to determine how long the

235

addition of VPS34-IN1, PIK-III, Orlistat, or Triacsin C could be postponed before activity was

236

lost. Additionally, this would identify if the anti-viral activity of each compound impacted a pre-

237

or post- viral entry step. As indicated in Figure 4A¸ 4 conditions were tested 1) single treatment

238

1 hour prior to viral infection, with compound removed just prior to infection; 2) 1 hour pre-

239

treatment with continuous dosing; 3) dosing at 2 h.p.i.; and 4) dosing at 4 h.p.i.. VeroE6 cells

240

were pre-seeded onto a CytoView-Z plate and allowed to stabilize, compounds were added, and

241

resistance was monitored for 48 hours after infection. Percent inhibition was calculated based on

242

resistance values at 48 h.p.i. We observed that a single 5 µM treatment of VPS34-IN1 or PIK-III

243

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 4B). Additionally, inhibition was observed even

244

when added after 4 h.p.i. In contrast, removal of Orlistat or Triacsin C before infection,

245

eliminated their efficacy. Maintenance throughout the experiment was inhibitory, as was addition

246

at 2 or 4 hours post infection. Interestingly, delayed treatment with Triacsin C at 50µM exhibited

247

greater anti-viral activity that initiating the treatment one hour prior to infection. Altogether,

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

248

these data demonstrate activity of the VPS34 inhibitors at both early and late, post-entry time

249

points and indicate that the effects of Orlistat and Triacsin C are likely post-entry.

250

Attenuation of VPS34 kinase activity and fatty acid metabolism inhibit SARS-CoV-2

251

in a human airway epithelial cell line

252

We proceeded to investigate if the inhibitors were effective in the human lung carcinoma

253

cell line, Calu-3, by directly measuring production of infectious virus and cytotoxicity. That this

254

cell line is derived from the human airway and is highly susceptible to infection has established it

255

as a standard for infection studies with SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 34, 35. Calu-

256

3 cells were plated onto 96-well plates and allowed to reach 95% confluency. Cells were then

257

pre-treated with a range of concentrations of VPS34-IN1, PIK-III, Triacsin C, Orlistat, DMSO,

258

or mock treated with media alone for 1 hour then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01.

259

Supernatants were collected at 48 h.p.i. and titered on VeroE6 cells by plaque assay. In parallel,

260

to determine cytotoxicity of these compounds, Calu-3 cells were seeded onto 96-well black

261

walled 96-well plates, allowed to reach 95% confluency and treated with VPS34-IN1, PIK-III,

262

Triacsin C, Orlistat, DMSO, or mock treated with media alone. CellTox Green was added at the

263

264

compounds inhibited production of infectious virus, as measured by plaque assay on Vero E6

265

cells Figure 5A, C, E, and G). In contrast to VeroE6 cells, no cytotoxicity was observed even at

266

the highest dose for each compound in Calu-3 cells. We observed IC50s of 0.55µM (VPS34-

267

IN1), 0.12µM (PIK-III), 21.25µM (Orlistat), and 0.04µM (Triacsin C), as shown in Figure 5B,

268

D, F, and H, respectively. Importantly, the IC50s calculated for VPS34-IN1 and PIK-III by

269

measuring infectious virus are in close agreement with IC50s calculated in Vero E6 cells using

270

the resistance-based assay. The IC50s for Triacsin C and Orlistat were substantially lower than in

the Vero cells. These data suggest that attenuation of the kinase activity of VPS34, synthesis of

272

fatty acids or production of long chain fatty acyl-CoA in human bronchial epithelial cells inhibits

273

replication of SARS-CoV-2.

274

VPS34 is a class III PI3 kinase. We therefore extended our study to determine if

275

BYL719, an FDA approved inhibitor of class I PI3 kinase used to treat breast cancer, would also

276

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells. Unlike the VPS34-specific inhibitors, little

277

inhibition was detected up to 16.6 µM, at which we observed a 1-log decrease in viral titers

278

(Supplemental Figure 2). This data suggests that not all PI3K classes play a significant role

279

during SARS-CoV-2 replication.

and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 nascent viral RNA and N co-localized with LC3. VeroE6 cells were

285

infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 3 and at 24 h.p.i., were treated with 1µM of actinomycin

286

D to arrest host-cell transcription. Cells where then chased for 4 hours with 5-ethynyl uridine

287

(EU). Viral nascent RNA labeled during the EU chase was then detected with click chemistry,

288

indirect immunofluorescence performed using primary antibodies against N and LC3, and the

289

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was detected with DPX BlueWhite ER stain. We observed distinct

290

formation of ring-like structures positive for ER, N, LC3, and nascent viral RNA (Supplemental

291

Figure 3A). Co-localization analysis demonstrated that nascent viral RNA co-localized with N

292

or LC3 (Supplemental Figure 3B). This data demonstrates the presence of SARS-CoV-2

293

replication centers that form in association with LC3.

294

Because each compound exhibited inhibitory effects when added after viral entry, we

295

next asked whether the compounds altered the establishment of viral replication centers. Calu-3

296

cells were seeded onto fibronectin coated glass cover slips and allowed to reach 95% confluency.

297

Cells were pre-treated with approximately the IC90 of VPS34-IN1 (5 µM), PIK-III (5 µM),

298

Orlistat (500 µM), or Triacsin C (50 µM) and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 3. At 24

299

h.p.i. cells were fixed, permeabilized, and indirect immunofluorescence performed using primary

300

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) and dsRNA. We observed that when

301

compared to the media only or DMSO controls, N became completely cytoplasmic and did not

302

form any large inclusion like formations in the presence of the compounds (Figure 6).

303

Additionally, even though dsRNA could be detected both distributed throughout the cytoplasm

304

and associated with N in large inclusion like formations in the media only and DMSO controls,

305

in the cells treated with inhibitors, dsRNA was only found distributed throughout the cytoplasm.

306

This data suggests that the compound disrupt replication center formation.

307

DISCUSSION

308

Here, we demonstrate that two VPS34 inhibitors, Orlistat, and Triacsin C each have clear effects

309

on SARS-CoV-2 replication and the morphology of viral replication centers. Generation of

310

replication centers is a key feature of the replication of many viruses36-38. These can serve as sites

311

where required components concentrate within a relatively closed environment and hide viral

312

replication products from the host innate immune response39. In order to generate these centers,

313

many viruses usurp host cellular pathways that are used to generate membranes or organelles 38.

314

Betacoronaviruses have been shown to target the ERAD-EDEMosome-ER pathways to generate

315

double-membrane vesicles required for their replication8. The data presented here suggests roles

316

for VPS34, FASN, and long chain fatty acyl CoA in replication center formation and stability

suggesting a role for these host factors in providing the membranes needed for SARS-CoV-2

318

replication organelles.

319

VPS34 is of interest as a therapeutic target for a variety of conditions, including aging,

320

neurodegeneration and cancer40, 41. The two VPS34 inhibitors tested were VPS34-IN1 and PIK-

321

III which have in vitro IC50s for VPS34 of 25 nM and 18 nM, respectively26, 42. These were the

322

most potent compounds versus SARS-CoV-2 tested in this study. Each displayed an IC50 of less

323

than 1µM in either Vero E6 cells or Calu-3 cells. Activity in the Vero E6 cells was measured

324

based on the capacity of the compounds to prevent viral cytopathic effects as measured by

325

resistance across the cell monolayer, whereas the Calu-3 cell assay measured inhibition of

326

production of infectious virus particles. The resistance-based assay provided a built-in measure

327

of cell viability and integrity of the cell monolayer, providing assurance that decreases in

328

resistance measurements initially post-infection were not reflective of cytopathic effects. We also

329

independently determined that the compounds tested were non-toxic in Calu3 cells, likewise

330

demonstrating that decreases in viral titer were not due to compound toxicity. Based on the Calu-

331

3 data, the selectivity indices (SI) (CC50/IC50) for the compounds are >90 and >416 for VPS34-

332

IN1 and PIK-III, respectively.

333

VPS34 is a phosphoinositide kinase that functions in autophagy, endosomal trafficking

334

and other cellular functions43. VPS34 associates with VPS15 as well as with other proteins to

335

carry out its activities. One VPS34-containing complex, Complex I, includes VPS34, VPS15,

336

Beclin 1 and ATG14 and is critical for autophagosome formation. Complex II includes VPS34,

337

VPS15, Beclin 1 and UVRAG and functions in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and in

338

regulation of endosomes and multivesicular bodies43.

339

differentiate between the various functions of VPS34 that might be involved in SARS-CoV-2

While our inhibitor studies do not

340

replication,. Autophagy has been implicated as necessary for MHV replication, however,

341

subsequent studies in different cell types suggest autophagy is not essential for MHV growth 7, 11.

342

Further, recent studies suggest that coronaviruses interfere with autophagy and that activation of

343

autophagy can inhibit replication of SARS-CoV, MERS CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 44, 45. Given that

344

inhibition of VPS34 results in the inhibition of autophagy26,

345

inhibition of VPS34 would eliminate these anti-CoV effects of autophagy and promote SARS-

346

CoV-2 replication. Therefore, the disruptions in SARS-CoV-2 replication due to VPS34

347

inhibition described here may, instead, reflect inhibition of non-autophagy related functions of

348

VPS34.

42

, it would be expected that

349

Separate from autophagy, VPS34 has several other roles including in endosomal trafficking

350

and retrograde endosome-to-Golgi transport43. For the positive-sense RNA virus TBSV, VPS34

351

was implicated in providing phosphatidylethanolamine-enriched membranes for formation of

352

TBSV replication centers13. Based on our observation that VPS34 inhibitors disrupt the structure

353

of SARS-CoV-2 replication centers, it is possible that VPS34 functions to facilitate membrane

354

availability for SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle formation. Disruption of endocytic trafficking

355

might also explain our observation that pre-treatment with VPS34 inhibitors alone had

356

significant effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication.

357

Orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin) is an FDA-approved weight loss drug that is taken orally and

358

inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases in the digestive tract, reducing uptake of lipids 21. Orlistat

359

also inhibits fatty acid synthase (FASN)46. Orlistat and other FASN inhibitors have previously

360

been examined for their anti-cancer and antiviral activities. Although the clinically approved oral

361

administration of Orlistat does not result in its significant systemic distribution, pre-clinical

362

studies in mice have demonstrated that systemic administration of Orlistat is well tolerated 47.

363

Orlistat has been demonstrated to have activity against several viruses, including varicella-zoster

364

virus (VZV), coxsackievirus B3 virus (CVB3), dengue virus (DENV), and other flaviviruses.

365

DENV uses it nonstructural protein 3 to recruit FASN to viral replication sites and enhances

366

synthesis of fatty acids48. As in our study, flaviviruses were sensitive to relatively high

367

concentrations of Orlistat and antiviral effects could be demonstrated when Orlistat was added to

368

cells post-infection17. Virus inhibition has typically been demonstrated at relatively high

369

concentrations of Orlistat, such as 100µM or higher for CVB3, and between 10µM and 84µM for

370

DENV3, depending on the timepoint post-infection DENV3 replication was measured 17,

371

For DENV3, the effect of Orlistat appeared to be after the early stages of infection 18. This may

372

reflect the need for DENV to recruit FASN to sites of virus replication and to upregulate fatty

373

acid synthesis48, 50. It will be of interest to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 similarly depends on

374

an upregulation of fatty acid synthesis.

19, 49

.

375

Triacsin C inhibits long chain fatty acid acyl-CoA synthetase. Interestingly, the long chain

376

fatty acid acyl-CoA synthetase ACSL3 was identified as an interactor of SARS-CoV-2 non-

377

structural protein 7, suggesting a role for this enzyme in virus replication 51. Triacsin C also has

378

demonstrated antiviral activity for HCV and rotavirus14-16. For both HCV and rotavirus, the

379

antiviral effects of Triacsin C have been linked to reliance of these viruses on lipid droplets for

380

their replication14-16. Lipid droplets are organelles that store neutral lipids of which triglycerides

381

are a major component52. By inhibiting long chain fatty acyl CoA, Triacsin C blocks lipid droplet

382

formation. That antiviral activity against HCV and rotavirus is connected to lipid droplet

383

formation is supported by the fact that these viruses are sensitive to inhibition by the DGAT

384

inhibitors, T863 and PF06424439. In contrast, the compounds did not exhibit any activity against

385

SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells whereas Triacsin C did. This suggests an alternate role for long

386

chain fatty acyl CoA or its downstream metabolites other than triacylglycerol and lipid droplets.

387

It is notable that the IC50 for Triacsin C was substantially lower in the Calu-3 cell assay as

388

compared to the Vero cell assay. A lesser decrease in IC50 was also noted for Orlistat in the

389

Calu-3 cells versus the Vero E6 cells. These observations may reflect different degrees of

390

dependence of the virus on fatty acid metabolism in different cell types. From the perspective of

391

antiviral development, it is encouraging that the human airway-derived cells are the more

392

sensitive system given that SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory tract. Triacsin C has been

393

administered to mice daily for up to two months without overt signs of significant toxicity and

394

resulted in a decrease in atherosclerosis53. However, the pharmacokinetics and cell penetrance of

395

Triacsin C are viewed as significant impediments to its clinical use54. Despite this, Triacsin C

396

analogs have been developed15, and long chain fatty acyl CoA synthetases are of interest as

397

potential therapeutics for cancer as well as for viruses54.

398

Cumulatively, these data support lipid metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for SARS-

399

CoV-2 infection. The specific mechanisms by which VPS34 promotes SARS-CoV-2 replication

400

and the precise manner in which the VSP34 inhibitors impair replication warrant further

401

investigation. Additionally, the specific enzymes and products of fatty acid metabolism

402

necessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 growth in human airway epithelial cells should be further

403

explored to more precisely identify relevant targets for therapeutic targeting. Further, it will be of

404

interest to understand the relative efficacies of inhibitors of fatty acid metabolism in different cell

405

types.
