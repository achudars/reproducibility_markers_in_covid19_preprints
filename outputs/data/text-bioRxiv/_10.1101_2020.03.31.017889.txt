Abstract: In the current COVID-19 pandemic context, proposing and validating effective
treatments represents a major challenge. However, the lack of biologically relevant pre-clinical
35

experimental models of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complement of classic cell lines represents a
major barrier for scientific and medical progress. Here, we advantageously used human
reconstituted airway epithelial models of nasal or bronchial origin to characterize viral infection
kinetics, tissue-level remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure and transcriptional immune
signatures induced by SARS-CoV-2. Our results underline the relevance of this model for the

40

preclinical evaluation of antiviral candidates. Foremost, we provide evidence on the antiviral
efficacy of remdesivir and the therapeutic potential of the remdesivir-diltiazem combination as a
rapidly available option to respond to the current unmet medical need imposed by COVID-19.

Main Text:
On Dec 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in
Wuhan, China. On Jan 10, 2020, a novel coronavirus, lately named severe acute respiratory
50

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and classified into the Betacoronavirus genus, was
identified as the causative agent (1). As of Mar 20, 2020, 9 days after the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 a pandemic (2), the new Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) had caused approximately 8 800 deaths among more than 210 000 confirmed cases
reported mainly in China but also spreading to at least 168 other countries or territories worldwide

55

(3). Compared to the two other coronaviruses responsible for epidemic outbreaks in the past,
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the novel SARS-CoV-2 strain shares ⁓79% and ⁓50% genome
sequence identity, respectively (4). Not surprisingly, important differences in terms of the
epidemiology and physiopathology between these three viruses have also been observed (5–7).
As with most emerging viral diseases, no specific antiviral treatment nor vaccine against

60

any of these three coronaviruses are currently available, with standard patient management relying
mainly on symptom treatment and respiratory support when needed. In that regard, and considering
that key features of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its induced COVID-19 still require further
characterization, the scarce readiness of biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental models of
SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complement of the African green monkey VeroE6 cell line represents

65

a major barrier for scientific and medical progress in this area. We and others have previously
reported the advantage of using more physiological models such as in-house or commercially
available reconstituted human airway epithelia (HAE) to isolate, culture and study a wide range of
respiratory viruses (8, 9). Developed from biopsies of nasal or bronchial cells differentiated in the
air/liquid interphase, these models reproduce with high fidelity most of the main structural,

70

functional and innate immune features of the human respiratory epithelium that play a central role
in the early stages of infection and constitute robust surrogates to study airway disease mechanisms
and for drug discovery (10).
In this study, we initially isolated and amplified in VeroE6 cells a SARS-CoV-2 virus
directly form a nasal swab from one of the first hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19

75

in France (11). The complete genome sequence of the isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus was deposited
in the GISAID EpiCoVTM database under the reference BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020
(accession ID EPI_ISL_411218). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the isolated virus is
representative of currently circulating strains (12). We first characterized the replicative capacities
of this viral strain in VeroE6 cells at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (Fig. 1A), using

80

both classic infectious titer determination in cell culture (TCID50) and molecular semi-quantitative
methods, the latter based on ORF1b-nsp14-specific primers and probes designed by the School of
Public Health/University of Hong Kong (details in Supplementary Materials). This double
approach was facilitated by the appearance of clearly observable characteristic cytopathic effect
from 48 hpi (Fig. 1B), and enabled the validation of a large interval (range 1-8 log10(TCID50))

85

with high correlation (R-squared 0.94) between molecular and infectious viral titers (Fig. 1C).
In parallel, we successfully inoculated nasal MucilAir™ HAE on the apical surface directly
with nasal swab samples, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations (Fig.
S1). Characteristic features of coronavirus-induced cell ultrastructure remodeling were easily
distinguishable in both the apical and basal sides of the HAE at 48 hpi, notably the high

90

accumulation of progeny virions in mucus-producer goblet cells. Then, we advantageously
exploited the MucilAir™ HAE model and in-house adapted protocols previously optimized for
different respiratory viruses (13) to perform experimental infections with SARS-CoV-2. Viral

replication was monitored through repeated sampling and TCID50 titration at the apical surface of
HAE (Fig. 1D). Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), considered as a surrogate of
95

epithelium integrity, was also measured during the time-course of infection (Fig. 1E). In parallel,
comparative molecular viral genome quantification was performed at the three levels of the
air/liquid HAE interphase: in apical washes (Fig. 1F, Apical), total cellular RNA (Fig. 1G,
Intracellular) and basal medium (Fig. 1H, Basal). SARS-CoV-2 viral production at the epithelial
apical surface increased sharply at 48 hpi, reaching 5.8 and 6.3 log10 TCID50/mL in nasal and

100

bronchial HAE, respectively. The peak of viral replication was reached earlier in bronchial (48-72
hpi) than in nasal HAE, in which a progressive increase in infectious viral titers was observed until
at least 96 hpi (Fig. 1D). This replication kinetics was validated by molecular viral genome
quantification at the apical pole (Fig. 1F). High viral replication correlated with a reduction in
epithelium integrity at 48 hpi, reflected by more than 2.8- and 4-fold decreases in bronchial and

105

nasal HAE TEER values, respectively, followed by a partial recovery in the case of bronchial HAE
(Fig. 1E). Moreover, viral production at the apical pole was well correlated with intracellular viral
genome detection during infection, except for the nasal HAE at 48 hpi, in which a strong relative
increase of nsp14 RNA was observed (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, viral genome was detected in the
basal medium from 48 hpi, with the peak observed at 72 hpi (Fig. 1H) coinciding with the highest

110

impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on epithelium integrity.
To further characterize the biology of the SARS-CoV-2, we inoculated both nasal (Fig.
2A, B) and bronchial (Fig. 2C, D) HAE and analyzed the infection-induced remodeling of the
cellular ultrastructure using transmission electron microscopy. At 48 hpi, both HAE exhibited a
well-established infection, with ciliated, goblet and to a lesser extent basal cells showing active

115

production of viral progeny. This observation is accordance with viral replication results described

in Fig. 1 and with a recent study reporting high expression levels of the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in both ciliated and goblet respiratory cells (14). As
previously observed in structural studies of other coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERSCoV (15–18), we distinguished characteristic clusters in the perinuclear region of infected HAE
120

cells. These clusters are mainly composed of numerous viral single- and double-membrane
vesicles (DMV) and mitochondria (Fig. 2A, A1, B, C, D). Large electron-dense structures
corresponding to the accumulation of viral material in active virus replication zones as well as
typical double-membrane spherules containing pieces of membranes interspaced among virions
being formed were also observed at 48 hpi (Fig. 2B, D). Moreover, double-membraned spherules

125

containing numerous virions are noticeable near the plasmatic membranes (Fig. 2B1, D2). These
spherules as well as several clusters of virions were observed mostly at the surface of ciliated cells
(Fig. 2A2). These features are characteristic of the late stages of the viral cycle, hence confirming
the capacity of the HAE to reproduce the asynchronous nature of infection.
Recent reports associate COVID-19 with high plasma levels of certain immunostimulant

130

and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL6), notably in patients with severe disease (6), suggesting
a potential link with a poor prognosis (19). However, such inflammatory state has been much less
characterized in the respiratory microenvironment thus far. To investigate the effect of SARSCoV-2 infection on gene expression, we used Nanostring hybridization-based technology (Seattle,
USA) on both nasal and bronchial HAE for multiplex mRNA detection and relative quantification

135

of two complementary panels of genes (20) involved in the immune response (Data S1). Heatmap
and hierarchical analyses identified two distinct levels of clustering. First, regardless of the nasal
or bronchial nature of the HAE model, the gene expression profile at 24 hpi highlights a marked
upregulation of a subset of ⁓14% of the studied genes, which are subsequently downregulated at

48, 72 and 96 hpi (Fig. 3A). This observation was substantiated by unsupervised analysis of the
140

data using the full gene panel. Indeed, the first component of the principal component analysis
(PCA) that accounts for 63% of the variance is mainly driven by the time of infection, with a clear
discrimination between 24 hpi and the other time-points (Fig. 3B, red triangles/dots). Interestingly,
the immune transcriptomic signatures seem at least partially driven by the nature of the HAE
beyond 24 hpi (Fig. 3A). This is in agreement with the second component analysis, gathering

145

12.6% of total variance, which allowed a clear differentiation between the nasal and bronchial
compartments (Fig. 3B, green/purple triangles versus dots). In the nasal HAE, the response after
24 hpi (peak at 72-96 hpi) is driven by a strong upregulation of type I and type III IFNs (IFNB1,
IFNL1, IFNL2-3-4) as well as other immunity-related genes. Whereas only a subset of these genes
(CXCL10/IP10, CXCL2/MIP2A, IL1A, IL1B, Mx1 and ZBP1) follow the same pattern in the

150

bronchial HAE, though at overall lower expression levels, the initial modulation of IFNB1, IFNL1,
CCL2/MCP1 and IL6 in this tissue seems to fade at 96 hpi. Moreover, the relative expression of a
subset of genes associated with the NF-kB and TNFα pathways (e.g. IL18, IL18R1, NFKB2,
NFKBIA, TNFA, and TNFAIP3) is mostly unchanged all throughout the infection in bronchial
HAE but it is highly upregulated in nasal HAE at 48 hpi and onwards (Fig. 3C and Data S1).

155

Taken together, our results highlight distinctive transcriptional immune signatures between nasal
and bronchial HAE, both in terms of kinetics and intensity, hence suggesting potential intrinsic
differences in the early response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the upper and lower
respiratory tract. These results are in accordance with the first clinical reports describing in some
patients a rapid worsening of the respiratory condition and overall clinical state by day 7-10 after

160

symptom onset (21), most probably related to a cytokine storm syndrome (22).

The current absence of specific treatments against COVID-19 results in the empirical
repurposing of approved or experimental drugs designed for other diseases. These treatments are
usually based on limited clinical or preclinical data. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a prodrug of an
adenosine nucleotide analog with demonstrated broad antiviral activity against several RNA
165

viruses in different preclinical models (23). Remdesivir has recently shown very promising results
in animal models for the treatment of different coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV (24), as well
as one in vitro study against SARS-CoV-2 (25). Indeed, various clinical trials on the use of
remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 have already started in China and USA.
We therefore evaluated in both VeroE6 and HAE model the antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-

170

2 of remdesivir monotherapy but also in combination with diltiazem. Diltiazem is a voltage gated
Ca2+ channel antagonist currently used as anti-hypertensive for the control of angina pectoris and
cardiac arrhythmia (26), which we have recently repurposed as an effective host-directed influenza
inhibitor due to its so far undescribed capacity of inducing the interferon (IFN) antiviral response,
particularly type III IFNs (Fig. S2) (8). Additionally, the rationale of testing such virus-directed

175

plus host-directed drug combination is consistent with a novel study describing hypertension as a
potential risk factor observed among a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19 (19), and two reports
not anticipating potential adverse effects of diltiazem (27) or negative pharmacological
interactions of between remdesivir and diltiazem for the treatment of COVID-19 (28).
Figure 4A-C shows a very strong antiviral effect of post-infection treatment with

180

remdesivir in VeroE6 cells, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.98 ± 0.07 µM at
48 hpi and 0.72 ± 0.03 µM at 72 hpi. On the other hand, although the IFN-λ1 response in VeroE6
cells has been proved functional, this cell line cannot produce type I IFNs (29, 30). This incomplete
IFN response most likely accounts for the lack of significant antiviral effect observed with

diltiazem monotherapy in our experimental conditions. Nonetheless, addition of 11.5 µM diltiazem
185

significantly potentiated the antiviral effect of remdesivir (Fig. 4A-C), inducing 68% and 50%
reductions in remdesivir IC50 values at 48 and 72 hpi, respectively. Comparably, daily treatment
with 20 µM remdesivir resulted in 7.3 log10 and 7.9 log10 reductions of intracellular SARS-CoV2 viral titers at 48 hpi in nasal and bronchial HAE, respectively (Fig. 4D, upper panel). Not
surprisingly for a model with a completely functional IFN response, daily treatment with 90 µM

190

diltiazem resulted in moderate yet substantial (0.4 log10 and 0.8 log10, respectively) reductions of
intracellular viral titers in nasal and bronchial HAE at the same time-point (Fig. 4D, upper panel).
On top of that, we observed an additional 1.3 log10 reduction in nasal HAE viral titers for the
remdesivir-diltiazem combination when compared with remdesivir monotherapy. In all cases, the
antiviral effects induced by remdesivir, diltiazem or the remdesivir-diltiazem combination

195

translated into a protection of the nasal but not the bronchial HAE barrier integrity, preventing the
drop on TEER values induced by the infection (Fig. 4D, lower panel). Importantly, remdesivir
also showed a strong antiviral effect at 72 hpi (Fig. 4E, upper panel). This time, the ⁓2 log10
reductions in nasal and bronchial HAE viral titers observed for the remdesivir and remdesivirdiltiazem treatments correlated higher TEER values in both HAE compartments (Fig. 4E, lower

200

panel).
Collectively, we report the utility of in vitro reconstituted HAE as an efficient support for
the study of respiratory viral infections and virus-host interactions in highly biologically relevant
experimental conditions. Our results obtained in this model provide novel contributions to the
characterization of the viral infection and replication kinetics as well as on the tissue-level

205

remodeling of the cellular ultrastructure induced by SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, Nanostring
results highlight a differential effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the early innate immune

response of nasal and bronchial HAE. These responses are in line with the viral replication kinetics,
and in some cases (6) -but not in others- (31) follow similar trends to what has been described in
blood samples from patient cohorts. We expect our results will provide a starting point for future
210

studies aimed at further characterizing the local pathophysiology and immune response to SARSCoV-2 infection, particularly in the lower respiratory tract, with the ultimate objective of providing
insight in terms of putative prognostic biomarkers and/or patient management.
Finally, the HAE model of SARS-CoV-2 infection described in this study also constitutes
a very interesting physiologic model to evaluate candidate therapeutic approaches, provided that

215

in many cases inhibitory effects observed in classic models of immortalized cell lines do not
necessarily translate into the real clinical setting (32). In that regard, although further studies in
terms of dose optimization would be desired, we provide evidence in both classic and complex in
vitro experimental models on the potential of the remdesivir-diltiazem combination as an option
worthy of consideration to respond to the current medical unmet need imposed by COVID-19. The

220

combination of a virus-directed plus a host-directed drug could result in enhanced antiviral and/or
immunomodulatory effects, including during the immunopathologic phase frequently observed the
second week of infection. This association could also reduce the therapeutic doses of
chemotherapeutic agents targeting nucleic acid synthesis and therefore minimize putative adverse
side effects. Indeed, such two-pronged approach would be of special interest for the treatment of

225

at-risk patients within the first 10 days from symptom onset, when effective clearance of viral load
still plays a major role in the clinical outcome.

bronchial reconstituted human airway epithelia (HAE). (A) SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics
in VeroE6 cells. (B) Virus-induced cytopathic effects in VeroE6 cells. (C) Correlation between
viral quantification methods. (D) Apical viral production was assessed in washes of the apical pole
375

at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi. Vero E6 cells were incubated with serial dilutions of the collected sample
for the determination of viral titers (log10 TCID50/ml) at the indicated time-points. (E) Transepithelial resistance (TEER in Ohms/cm2) between the apical and basal poles was measured at
each time-point. (F-H) Relative viral genome quantification at the apical, intracellular and basal
compartments of the HAE was performed after viral or total RNA extraction and RTqPCR. Results

380

are expressed in fold change of nsp14 expression compared to 24 hpi and also as log10 TCID50
equivalent values. Representative data are shown from three independent experiments.
