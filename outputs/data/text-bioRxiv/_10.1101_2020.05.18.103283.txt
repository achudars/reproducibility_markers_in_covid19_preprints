Abstract
The need for antiviral drugs is real and relevant. Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular
advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell
membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane
dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids,
biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target.
We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase
(GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga®, (ii) GENZ-667161,
an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both
GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus,
organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus
(WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly
increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can
potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in
preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been
studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19
pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
Viral infections create a significant burden to human health worldwide, making the development
of antiviral drugs a pressing need. Despite the rapid advancement in pharmaceutical and
biotechnological approaches (e.g., RNA interference [RNAi] (1)), the development of successful
antiviral treatments remains a challenge (2). Historically, drug research has mainly focused on
targeting viral components, because of the perceived specificity of such an approach (3).
However, since viral life cycle is dependent on the host, specific host mechanisms can also be
explored as antiviral targets. There are distinct advantages for this approach such as creating a
high barrier to resistance, providing broad coverage of different genotypes/serotypes, possibly
even multiple viruses, and expanding the list of potential targets for a drug, when druggable viral
targets are limited (4).
While side effects may be of particular concern for such treatments, another advantage of
targeting host protein is the availability of many approved drugs against host proteins, allowing
for drug repurposing. The main advantage of repurposing approved drugs is that they have
already proven to be sufficiently safe, they have successfully passed clinical trials and regulatory
scrutiny, and they have already undergone post-marketing surveillance (5).
This leads to significantly reduced timelines and required investment in making treatment
available. In cases of major pandemic outbreaks caused by new viruses, shortening the time to
treatment can have a major impact on public health and economics, making drug repurposing
particularly desirable.
Sphingolipids (SLs) are biologically active components of cell membranes and as such are
tightly linked to all processes involving membrane dynamics, making them potential key
regulators in the life cycle of obligatory intracellular pathogens such as viruses.
Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) is the backbone of more than 300 structurally different
Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) including gangliosides and sulfatides. Its accumulation leads to
Gaucher diseases accompanied by chronic brain inflammation and activation of the antiviral
immune response (6). GSLs are involved in lateral and vertical segregation of receptors required
for attachment, membrane fusion and endocytosis, as well as in intracellular replication,
assembly and release of viruses. In addition, GSLs and their metabolites are inseparably

interwoven in signal transduction processes, and the regulation of innate and intrinsic responses
of infected target cells (7).
Viral-induced elevation of SL levels was shown to be associated with a number of viruses;
elevation of GM2-ganglioside and Lactosylceramide was shown upon infection with Zika virus
and Hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively (8, 9). Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) induces
elevation of ceramide and GM2-ganglioside (10), and Dengue virus induces elevation of
ceramide and sphingomyelin (11). Additionally, Influenza virus was shown to induce
Sphingomyelin and GlcCer elevation (12, 13) and suppression of the biosynthesis of cellular
sphingolipids results in the inhibition of the maturation of influenza virus particles in vitro (14,
15). Moreover, iminosugars are known for their broad-spectrum antiviral activity, presumably
because of their mechanism of action as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident α-glucosidases I
and II inhibitors (16). 1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) iminosugar derivatives inhibit in vitro
production of infectious viruses including dengue virus (DENV) (17, 18), hepatitis B virus
(HBV) (19, 20), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (21), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (22, 23),
and influenza A virus (24). Antiviral efficacy of the iminosugar N-butyl-DNJ (NB-DNJ,
Miglustat, Zavesca) has been further demonstrated in vivo against DENV infection (25).
Although these reports present strong circumstantial evidence that inhibition of ER α-glucosidase
activity is the cause of iminosugar antiviral activity (26), the ubiquity of D-glucose in
metabolism suggests that other pathways may be equally affected by iminosugar treatment.
Indeed, NB-DNJ has been approved for clinical use since 2002 as a second line treatment for
Gaucher’s disease (27) –a lysosomal storage disease (LSD). In this context, NB-DNJ is used as
an inhibitor of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)),
(EC 2.4.1.80) to reduce production of GSLs that accumulate due to a deficiency in GlcCer
degradation (28). Thus, GSL synthetic pathways may be therapeutic targets for a broad-range of
viral infection. Drugs targeting SL metabolizing enzymes are currently in use and constantly
being developed for treating LSDs and other disorders in which alteration in SL levels are
involved in disease pathology )31-29(. This allows a potential repurposing of these already
approved drugs as antivirals. While the inhibitor NB-DNJ affects multiple host targets, specific
inhibition of GCS is now possible using GCS inhibitors which are currently available. In this
study, we examined the antiviral activity of two specific inhibitors of GCS, which catalyze the

biosynthesis of GlcCer. These inhibitors block the conversion of ceramide to GlcCer, the first
step in the biosynthesis of gangliosides and other glycosphingolipids.
The following GCS inhibitors were examined: (i) (1R,2R)-nonanoic acid[2-(2′,3′-dihydro-benzo
[1,4] dioxin-6′-yl)-2-hydroxy-1-pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl-ethyl]-amide-l-tartaric acid salt (Genz123346) termed herein after GZ-346. GZ-346 is an analogue of the FDA-approved drug
eliglustat (Cerdelga®) which is indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with
Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) (32). (ii) (S)- quinuclidin-3-yl (2-(2-(4-fluorophenyl)thiazol-4yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate (GENZ-667161) termed herein after GZ-161. GZ-161 is a specific
inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) that can access the central nervous system (CNS)
and has been demonstrated to effectively reduce glycosphingolipid synthesis (33-35). GZ-161 is
an analogue of venglustat which is currently under clinical trials for the LSDs; Gaucher’s
disease, Fabry disease, and Tay-Sachs disease, and is in a Phase 3 pivotal trial for autosomaldominant polycystic kidney disease (32-35).
While initially our research was focused on virus-induced diseases of the CNS, the current focus
on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, have led us to test GCS inhibitors on nonneuronopathic viruses such as Influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19.
Thus, the antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors was examined on four enveloped RNA viruses,
differing by their genus, organ-target and transmission route; (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus
(SVNI), a prototypic member of the alphavirus genus that has been used to study the
pathogenesis of acute viral encephalitis in mice for many years (36-38). (ii) West Nile virus
(WNV), a neurotropic flavivirus that has been the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis
worldwide. (iii) Influenza A virus, a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae that can cause
acute respiratory disease, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2, a members of the Coronaviridae family of the
order Nidovirales (39). With the current coronavirus disease (COVID 19) outbreak, the potential
effect of the tested compound is of particular interest and priority. Furthermore, Coronaviruses
are behind two more large scale pandemic outbreaks in the past two decades: severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in
2012. The pandemic potential of these viruses along with the threat to public health they pose
have put them on the WHO blueprint list for priority pathogens. The observed broad spectrum of

effect of the tested compound makes it a good candidate for treatment of both current and future
high priority pathogens.

Results
Antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors against SVNI virus
To determine whether GCS inhibitors block the replication of SVNI, Vero cells were incubated
with serial dilutions of GZ-161 or GZ-346 one hour prior to infection with SVNI expressing
luciferase (TRNSV-Luc) (41). Both GZ-161 and GZ-346 exhibited antiviral activity with an
average median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ~4.5 μM and ~7 μM, respectively (Fig.1A).
No cytoxicity was observed in similarly treated uninfected cultures across the dose range (50%
cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of >30 μM for both GZ-161 and GZ-346). Next, we examined
the antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors on a mouse neural crest-derived cell line, Neuro 2A (N2a)
to demonstrate that their antiviral activity is not specific to Vero cells. GZ-161 and GZ-346
inhibit SVNI replication in both cell lines, with percentage of inhibition of ~40-50% and ~60%
in Vero and N2a cells, respectively (Fig 1B).

GCS inhibitors disrupt early stages of SVNI replication
To determine which stage of SVNI infection cycle was affected by GCS inhibitors, a time-ofaddition assay was performed. As shown in Fig 2A, inhibition was most efficient when GCS
inhibitors were added not later than 1 hour post infection (hpi) (Fig. 2A). The time-dependence
of the inhibitory effect of the compound suggest that its anti-SVNI activity may be due to
inhibition of early steps in the SVNI replication cycle. To further elaborate on the mechanism of
GCS inhibition of SVNI life cycle, a Sindbis virus encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)
gene under the control of the subgenomic promoter (SIN-GFP) (42) was used. In this virus, GFP
translation is only triggered upon the assembly of viral replication complexes enabling
transcription of the sub-genomic RNA and translation of the encoded genes, including GFP in
this case. To ensure single-cycle infection, a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 was
applied. Vero cells were incubated with 10 μM GZ-161 or GZ-346 one hour prior to infection
with SIN-GFP and GFP signal was measured at intervals of 2 hours (Fig. 2B). While GFP
expression was highly elevated in untreated cells, a robust reduction was observed in GZ-161
and GZ-346 treated cells compared to untreated cells (Fig. 2B). To determine if GFP-levels were
reduced due to a decrease in the number of GFP-expressing cells or due to an overall impaired
expression in all cells, flow cytometry analysis of single-cycle infection was used (Fig. 2C). GZ161 or GZ-346 significantly reduced the number GFP-expressing cells 24 hpi from ~90% in
untreated cell to ~60% and ~30% in GZ-161 and GZ-346 treated cell, respectively. Thus, our
data suggest that GCS inhibitors inhibit SVNI infection cycle after attachment of the virus and
before the translation of sub-genomic proteins.

GZ-161 enhances the survival of SVNI-infected mice
To evaluate whether GZ-161 could protect SVNI-infected mice, at a concentration comparable
with the pre-clinical/clinical studies for drug approval, mice were treated with GZ-161
(20mg/kg/day, i.p) and infected with a lethal dose of SVNI. GZ-161 significantly protected
pretreated infected mice from SVNI-induced mortality (Fig 3). Virtually all SVNI-infected mice
died within 9 days post infection (~90% mortality, with median time of survival (T50) of 7
days), whereas 60% of GZ-161-treated SVNI-infected animals survived (with undefined median

survival) (Fig. 3). Postponing the treatment to the second day after infection still preserved some
level of protection to SVNI-infected mice (Fig.3): 40% of the mice receiving post infection
treatment with GZ-161 survived (with median survival of 9.5 days) (Fig. 3). Remarkably, both
treatment regimens resulted in enhanced survival when compared to control, untreated group,
with decreased mortality rates and increased median time of survival.

significant decrease in the mortality of GZ-161 treated mice compared to SVNI mice * p <0.05, ** p <0.01.

Antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors against West nile virus
Next, we examined whether the antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors is specific to SVNI or
whether they can block a neurotropic virus from different genus, namely WNV. Vero cells were
incubated with 10 μM GZ-161 or GZ-346 one hour prior to infection with the NY-99 strain of
WNV. Supernatants were harvested 24 hpi and analyzed by qPCR. We observed a 60%
reduction in viral RNA present in the supernatant of samples treated with GZ-161 or GZ-346
compared to the vehicle DMSO (untreated), suggesting that GCS inhibitors has a broad antiviral
activity towards neuronopathic RNA-viruses (Fig. 4).

Antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors against Influenza virus
Since GCS inhibitors showed antiviral activity towards two neuronopathic viruses, and given the
current COVID-19 pandemic, we checked whether GZ-161 and GZ-346 will block also nonneuronopathic viruses. The antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors towards the respiratory RNA
virus, influenza, was examined. MDCK cells were incubated with 10 μM GZ-161 or GZ-346 one
hour prior to infection with mouse adapted influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8).
Supernatant were harvested 8 hpi and analyzed by qPCR for the detection of viral RNA in the
culture media (Fig 5A). A ~90% reduction in viral RNA present in the supernatant was apparent
in samples treated with GZ-161 or GZ-346 compared to the vehicle DMSO (untreated). In
addition to their ability to inhibit PR8 replication, the ability of GCS inhibitors to reduce the
cytopathic effect (CPE) of PR8 infected cell was further examined. MDCK cells were incubated
with 10 μM GZ-161 or GZ-346 one hour prior to infection with PR8 (MOI ,0.1) and LDH
release to the supernatant was measured at 24 hpi as an indication for cell disintegration. Both
GZ-161 and GZ-346 significantly reduced PR8-induced cytotoxicity by 65% and 90%
respectively (Fig. 5B).

Antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2
To test for antiviral activity of GCS inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, Vero E6 cells were
incubated with 10 μM GZ-161 or GZ-346 one hour prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Supernatants were harvested 24 hpi and analyzed by plaque forming units assay to measure the
effect of the drugs on SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig 6A and B). ~ 1.7e7±1.3e6 PFU/ml were
detected in the medium of vehicle DMSO (untreated) infected cells, while only 37 ± 23 and 700
± 339 PFU/ml were detected in GZ-161 and GZ-346 treated cells, respectively, indicating of
significant inhibition of virus release (P < 0.0001, P<0.001, respectively). To further determine
the efficacy of GCS inhibitors, cells were treated with serial dilutions of GZ-161 or GZ-346 and
infected with SARS-CoV-2. Supernatants were collected for qPCR at 24 hpi. As was shown for
Vero cells, no toxicity of GZ-161 and GZ-346 was observed at any of the concentrations tested.
The IC50 of GZ-161 and GZ-346 treatments were determined at ~2 μM, under these conditions
(Fig 6C). Next, the ability of GCS inhibitors to reduce the CPE of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in
comparison to Remdesivir was examined. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that

the current public health emergency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued
an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 (52). Vero E6
cells were incubated with 10 μM GZ-161, GZ-346, or Remdesivir, one hour prior to infection
with SARS-CoV-2 and cell viability was measured at 48 hpi. Remarkably, Both GZ-161 and
GZ-346 significantly reduced SARS-CoV2-induced CPE. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 reduced
cell viability to 40% in the untreated cell, whereas treatment with GZ-161, GZ-346 and
Remdesivir increased cell viability to 100%, 100% and ~75%, respectively (Fig. 6D). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that GZ-161 and GZ-346 have an antiviral effect on the
SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate in vitro, with a single dose able to significantly inhibit viral
replication within 24–48 h.

Discussion
The need for antiviral drugs is real and relevant. This is especially true for diseases without an
effective vaccine. Antiviral drugs with a broad spectrum have a particular advantage dealing with
emerging disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.
In this study we demonstrate that the GCS inhibitors GZ-161 and GZ-346 have a broad spectrum
antiviral activity. They inhibit in vitro viral replication of 4 viruses (SVNI, WNV, Influenza and
SARS-CoV-2) from 4 different genus with different routes of infection and target tissues. While
in this work we examined the effect of GCS inhibitors against enveloped RNA viruses, their
effect on DNA viruses and non-enveloped viruses remains to be elucidated.
The mechanism by which GCS inhibitors block viral replication is not fully-resolved. GCS
inhibitors inhibit SVNI replication in-vitro if administered pre infection, or immediately
following it. They prevent GFP expression, which is only expressed after the generation of the
replication complex and inhibit the virus also in single-cycle (high MOI) infection. Our data
suggest that GCS inhibitors interrupt with early stage of SVNI replication cycle. Sphingolipids
play a significant role in endocytosis, thus might play a major role in virus penetration to the cell.
Previous works showed that knocking out UGCG (the gene encoding for GCS) impaired the
entry of Influenza virus by endocytosis (43). In addition to its role in endocytosis, the cellular
membrane has a major role in establishing specialized membrane replication compartments
(RCs) that are critical sites for the synthesis of the viral genome(44). WNV and DENV were
shown to stimulate de novo lipid synthesis (45-47), while enteroviruses recruit host lipids
important for their replication to the RCs by lipolysis (48). Whether GCS inhibitors inhibit SVNI
cellular entry or the creation of the replication complex remains to be shown.
Interestingly, elevation of host Glycosphingolipids, as occurring in the lysosomal storage
diseases Gaucher and Krabbe, induces activation of type I interferon response (6). Together with

our results showing a key role of GlcCer synthesis in the lifecycle of a broad range viruses, it
may explain the evolving of antiviral response activation as a result of glycosphingolipids
accumulation.
To advance the pre-clinical development of GCS inhibitors as antiviral drugs, we further
examined whether GZ-161 is effective in vivo. While both GZ-161 and GZ-346 target GCS, only
GZ-161 can penetrate the brain, making it the preferred choice for diseases involving the CNS
(35). While GZ-161 significantly improved the survival, GZ-346 had no effect when given
starting from 2dpi (data not shown), highlighting the necessity of the inhibitor to penetrate the
brain in viral-infections of the CNS.
Treatments of SVNI-infected mice with GZ-161 were carried out at 20mg/kg/day, the same
dosage that was administered during the preclinical development of GZ-161 for Gaucher disease
(49) and Fabry (50). The preclinical studies using this dosage supported the clinical dossier to
approve the safe and effective use of venglustat (GZ-161 analogue) and eliglustat (GZ-346
analogue) in humans at 168 mg/day to treat Gaucher disease. Thus, as a proof of concept, our
findings consistently show that GCS inhibitors, at a pragmatic concentration, possesses antiviral
activity robust enough to provide protection against severe SVNI infection.
While GZ161 was only tested in-vivo on SVNI, in-vitro comparison of GZ-161 on the different
viruses suggests it is even more potent against Influenza (~90% inhibition) and SARS-COV-2
(~100% inhibition) compared to SVNI (~60% inhibition). Furthermore, the mouse model of
SVNI disease is acute with a mortality rate of about 90% and significant CNS damage, and yet
GZ-161 treatment was found to be effective.
We therefore believe it is important to test GZ-161 in-vivo also against Influenza virus and
COVID-19. Naturally, the best means of administration of these drugs for respiratory diseases
also needs to be established (Intraperitoneal, intravenous, intranasal, etc.). While treatment with
GZ-161 was effective also when administration started post viral exposure, effect was more
significant when administration began pre exposure. It is therefore worth considering both
therapeutic and prophylactic treatment for populations at high risk.
We show that GCS inhibitors have an antiviral effect on viruses of four different families,
suggesting a key role of the glycosphingolipid synthesis pathway in viral infection. Targeting
host proteins or pathways utilized by multiple viruses is less prone to the development of
resistance to the drug through mutations. It is worth exploring synergies of GCS inhibitors and

dosage targeting viral protein and lower the risk of viral resistance.

Materials and Methods

Cells
Vero (ATCC® CCL-81™), Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL-1586™), Neuro-2a (ATCC® CCL131™) and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC® CCL-34™) obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Summit Pharmaceuticals International, Japan). Cells were
used and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), Non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.25 units/ml nystatin at 37°C under a 5%

Viruses
The original strain of Sindbis virus (SV) was isolated in 1990 from mosquitoes in Israel.
This strain was used as a source for variants which differ in their neuro-invasiveness and
virulence, generated by a serial passages of SV in suckling and weanling mouse brain. At the
15th passage a neurovirulent variant was observed and designated SVN (neurovirulent). After 7
more passages in weanling mouse brains, another variant was observed and designated SVNI
(neuroinvasive). The SVNI strain used is both virulent and CNS-invasive [13].

Inhibition of SARS-Cov-2 virus in cell-culture
Vero E6 cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates. After
incubating overnight, cells were treated in 4-replicates with GZ-161 or GZ-346. Cells were
infected 1 hour later with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI, 0.01). Supernatant was collected 24 hpi for qPCR
and for plaque-forming units (PFU) quantification. For PFU quantification, Vero E6 cells were
seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells per well in 12-well plates. After incubating overnight, cell
monolayers were infected with serial dilution of media and 30‒35 plaque-forming units (PFU) of
live virus served as control. After two days of incubation at 37 °C, the inhibitory capacity of
GCS inhibitors was assessed by determining the numbers of plaques compared with untreated
cells .Cells cytotoxicity were determined 48 hpi by LDH Assay (Cytotoxicity) (ab65393)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. Percentage of inhibition was calculated by subtracting the
ratio of PFU between treated and untreated cells from 1. All experiments involving SARS-CoV2 were conducted in a BSL3 facility in accordance with the IIBR regulation.

Studies in mice
C57BL/6 mice (21-days old) were infected intraperitoneally (i.p) with SVNI (15
PFU/mouse). Beginning at 16 days of age (5 days pre-infection) or at 23-days of age (2 days
post-infection), injections of GZ-161 were administered i.p (20 mg/kg/day). The compound GZ161 was dissolved in 30 mM citrate buffer normal saline, pH=5 as a 1 mg/ml stock solution.
Mice were weighed daily throughout the experiment, and dosages were adjusted accordingly.
Control mice received a similar volume of injection buffer without the active agent.
