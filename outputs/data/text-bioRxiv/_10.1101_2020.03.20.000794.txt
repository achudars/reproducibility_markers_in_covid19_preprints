Abstract
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) virus has highlighted the need for fast and
efficacious vaccine development. Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to
protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA
complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides ​in vitro​ to
deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are
often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 19 epitope-HLA-binding
prediction tools, and using an ​in vitro​ peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides
that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of
potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance
when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in
question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is
therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high
prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes. Our findings may
contribute to the design of an efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.

Introduction
2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019, following
a series of unexplained pneumonia cases ​(WHO 2020a)​. Currently, the disease is intensifying
with case reports over a continuously growing geographical area. WHO now gives the risk
assessment ‘Very High’ on a global level and classifies the situation as pandemic ​(WHO 2020b,
[c] 2020)​. Vaccine development is of high priority at this stage, and a number of public and
private initiatives are focused on this task ​(Chen et al. 2020)​.​ Most, if not all, ongoing vaccine
development efforts are focused on raising an immune response against the spike protein.
However, the spike protein only makes up 1/8 of the COVID-19 genome, so this vaccine
strategy may inadvertently miss a lot of potential immune reactivity. ​SARS-CoV-2​ has a large
proteome ​(F. Wu et al. 2020)​. Immune deconvolution to identify T cell epitopes will require
initial filtering to assess which ​SARS-CoV-2​-derived peptides are likely to bind a given HLA
allotype and to be presented on the surface of infected cells from where it can activate
passing T cells. ​The core binding groove of most MHC molecules can accommodate 9 amino
acid residues, with some variation or suspected impact of flanking positions
(Bassani-Sternberg et al. 2016; Rammensee 1995)​.
Several tools (a selection is presented in Table 1) have been developed that can predict the
binding of peptides to HLA. Traditionally, these tools were trained using data from affinity
assays ​(Harndahl et al. 2009)​, but more recently many of them also incorporate data from
peptides identified by HLA ligandome analysis. Most tools rely on small neural networks (NN)
or variations of position-specific weight matrices (PSSM), to calculate the probability of a
peptide matching a consensus motif or model.
NetMHC tools (such as netMHC, netMHCII, netMHCpan, netMHCIIpan and others) have been
under constant development and have consistently performed well throughout the last
decade, ​(Peters, Nielsen, and Sette 2020; Mei et al. 2019; Saethang et al. 2012; Bhattacharya
et al. 2017)​. Several tools are restricted in terms of which allotypes are available for
prediction, in particular for MHC class II. This restriction is primarily determined by the
availability of training data, for which the large public collection is currently the Immune
Epitope Database (IEDB) ​(Sidney et al. 2006)​. Attempts to overcome this limitation have been
made via sequence-to-sequence predictions, most notably for netMHCpan ​(Jurtz et al. 2017)​.
A number of recent publications makes use of prediction tools to suggest vaccine candidate
epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 ​(Fast, Altman, and Chen 2020; Grifoni et al. 2020; Abdelmageed et
al. 2020)​.

To assess whether current peptide-HLA prediction tools could be suitable for identification of
epitopes relevant in a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, we tested predicted binders from the
netMHC tools, using a new MHC:peptide complex stability assay NeoScreen​Ⓡ​. We found that
algorithmically predicting binding between epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 and HLA outputs many
complexes that turned out to exhibit low stability. Such peptides are thus very unlikely to
elicit an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore unsuitable for vaccine
development. To investigate if this finding was a result of the quality of available training
data, we constructed a proof-of-concept prediction model, which we trained on 2,193 historic
in-house stability data, and found that it outperforms other tools. Training data was primarily
human cancer-derived or based on random sequences. SARS-CoV-2 peptides that we validated
as binding or non-binding in this study are freely available for use to assist in vaccine design
against COVID-19.

Results
We set out to identify peptides with epitope potential in a future COVID-19 vaccine. We
commenced by translating the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (​ACCESSION MN908947,
VERSION MN908947.3) ​to protein-coding sequence and predicted potential epitopes in a
sliding window of 9 using netMHC tools (netMHC/II and “-pan” versions, when allotype was not
available). We identified the top 94 predicted peptides for 11 HLA allotypes (94 x 11 = 1034),
and went further to validate the binding of these 94 peptides to each allotype in an ​in vitro
MHC:peptide complex stability assay (NeoScreen​Ⓡ​). We removed eight peptides that were
synthetically introduced when translating the DNA sequence to protein sequence. Of the
remaining 1,026 peptides we observed a high degree of overlap between different allotypes,
resulting in 777 unique peptides. We found that 174 of the 777 unique peptides formed a
stable peptide-HLA complex. Of these 174 peptides, 48 were previously measured and
deposited in IEDB in relation to SARS and the remaining 126 peptides are novel. The full list of
predicted binders (excluding synthetic peptides) can be found in the supplementary material
(Supplementary Data S1).
In order to first assess potential variability across the stability measurements we made
replicate measurements (​n=
​ 4) of 120 peptides on 8 HLA alleles. Each peptide was measured
with urea in 4 different concentrations (0M, 2M, 4M, 6M), and we observed an average
standard deviation between replicates of 0.10 with an average mean of 0.56. All remaining
experiments were performed in duplicate for all concentrations.
To further address whether alternative prediction tools would have higher concordance with
measured stability, we performed predictions for all tools listed in Table 1. Predictions for
the 19 different tools were performed either through their web server or a stand-alone
version, (see Materials and methods section for details). Furthermore, using in-house stability
data, we developed PrdX 1.0, a prediction tool for a single allele HLA-A*02:01, where all
other tools performed most poorly.
We assessed the false positive rate for each tool via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curves, and their Area under curve (AUC) for all allotypes that had more than 10 binders. The
analysis revealed that ANN 4.0 achieved the highest score for allotype HLA-A*01:01 (AUC =
97,47; Figure 1A), closely followed by NetMHCcons 1.1, NetMHCpan_BA 4.0 and IEDB-AR
Consensus. PrdX 1.0 scored highest for HLA-A*02:01 (AUC = 85.54; Figure 1B), NetMHCcons 1.1
scored highest for HLA-A*03:01 (AUC = 79.25; Figure 1C), and MHCflurry 1.3.0 performed best
for HLA-B*40:01 (AUC = 91.06; Figure 1F). NetMHCstab 1.0 was the only tool that achieved the
highest score for more than 1 allotype: HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-A*24:02

among all tested tools despite the extensive amount of data available for this allotype.
To assess the correlation between the predicted and measured peptide-HLA complexes,
Spearman correlation was calculated for all allotypes. This revealed significant
inconsistencies in performance depending on the predicted allotype. PSSMHCpan 1.0
displayed the highest consistency, taking into account its coverage (Table 1), but the
correlation median scored lower than other tools such as IEDB-AR Consensus, MixMHCpred
2.0.2, NetMHCpan_EL 4.0 or PrdX 1.0. The results of the Spearman correlations are
summarised in Figure 2.

Discussion
Here we benchmark a number of tools to identify epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and validate
via stability assay the binding of candidate epitopes to 10 allotypes of HLA class I and one
allotype of HLA class II. We find that the false positive rate is high for all tested tools when
testing for predicted HLA-binding peptides from SARS-CoV-2 virus. This creates a challenge for
vaccine development efforts, especially for the design of epitope vaccines, where only a
limited number of epitopes may be included. Furthermore, it highlights the risk for failed
vaccine design (for any pathogen or disease) if predicted HLA-binding protein regions in
reality do not bind and allow immune presentation and response.
We observed, remarkably, that all tools tested performed poorly for HLA-A*02:01, which is
the allotype with most training data available ​(Kim et al. 2014)​. Based on our observations we

hypothesise that publicly available training data is not of high enough quality. This is
supported by the fact that AUC and Spearman correlations indicate that performance seems
to correlate with the allotypes and not the tools; thus suggesting that either the training data
or the difficulty of modelling the allotype is responsible for poor predictions. To test the
hypothesis that training data is limiting for tool performance, we trained a vanilla NN on only
2,193 historic in-house stability measurements, and found that our model outperformed all
tested prediction tools in this setting. This observation could also be explained by more
similar data distributions between test and training data for PrdX 1.0.
We identified 174 potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate peptides, out of which 48 have
been previously deposited in IEDB following various studies ​(Qu et al. 2019; Blicher et al.
2005; Sylvester-Hvid et al. 2004; Harndahl et al. 2006; Sidney et al. 2006; Ishizuka et al.
2009)​. The majority of the previously deposited peptides were measured in one or multiple
affinity assays and reached low Kd (<50 nM) values, indicating strong affinity. Additionally, 9
of these peptides were previously measured in another stability assay and were recognised as
stable binders ​(Rasmussen et al. 2014)​, independently confirming our approach and
measurements. Of the 48 peptides deposited in IEDB, two (FLLPSLATV
https://www.iedb.org/epitope/16743, FLNRFTTTL https://www.iedb.org/epitope/16786)
have previously been assessed for their ability to provoke T cell responses, with negative T
cell responses for both.
To further assess the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we explored their overlap with T
cell-confirmed epitopes from SARS that are deposited in the IEDB. We identified 4 peptides
within our candidates that are represented within these confirmed epitopes as partial motifs.
In conclusion, we make freely available the identities of 174 COVID-19 epitopes that we have
predicted and validated ​in vitro​ to be HLA-binding. We hope that this contribution will aid the
development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. We performed a benchmark analysis of 20 tools
on 777 peptides that were predicted by state-of-the-art prediction tools from netMHC to be
binders, and revealed high false positive rates for all benchmarked tools. We observed
improved performance after training our own prediction tool PrdX 1.0 on allotype A*02:01
using in-house generated stability data. Our findings suggest that the performance of current
state-of-the-art epitope prediction tools are impacted by the varying quality of publicly
available data.

Data availability
All epitopes are available at the vendor webpage (​www.immunitrack.com​) and in
supplemental materials (Data S2.).

Materials and methods
Fifteen prediction tools tested on a relevant dataset of peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 genome
(assembly ​MN908947.3​). The genome sequence was downloaded from the NCBI database
(​https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3​) ​(F. Wu et al. 2020)​. Using NetMHC
tools we predicted the top 94 peptides for HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*03:01,
HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-C*04:01, HLA-C*07:01, HLA-C*07:02 (netMHC 4.0),
HLA-C*01:02 (netMHCpan 4.0) and HLA-DRB1*04:01 (netMHCII 2.3). Subsequently, the peptides
were analysed for binding stability to the respective HLA allotype. Taking into account the
cross-reactivity between the two allotypes, peptides predicted to bind HLA-A*03:01 were also
measured on HLA-A*11:01.
Peptides were synthesised using standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis on a modified cellulose
support as solid support according to the SPOT synthesis protocol, starting with the acid labile
Ramage linker.
After synthesis, peptides were cleaved off the membranes using 95% trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA),3% triisopropylsilane (TIS) & 2% H​2​O.Peptides were then precipitated with diethylether
and washed with methyl-tert-butylether.
Peptides were subsequently dissolved in a proprietary mixture and dried under vacuum using
a speed vac. Finally, 5% of all peptides were analysed by MALDI-TOF to confirm correct
molecular weight. The anticipated yield per spot was 50 μg.

NeoScreen​Ⓡ​ assay
The NeoScreen​Ⓡ​ stability assay utilises urea denaturation to assess peptide:MHC complex
stability. Briefly, peptides were dissolved in 200 µl DMSO with 1 mM ​β-​mercaptoethanol and
subsequently diluted into an assay buffer in 96 well plates at a final concentration of 2 µM.
Positions A1 and H12 were reserved for a mixture of reference peptides with known stable
binding to the MHC of interest. MHC I was diluted into an assay buffer with beta 2
microglobulin and added at a 1:1 ratio to diluted peptides. For MHC II, the urea-denatured
alpha and beta chains were diluted into an assay buffer and added at a 1:1 ratio to diluted
peptides. The concentration of MHC depended on the actual chain but final concentrations
were in the range of 2-10 nM (hence peptide was added in excess). Upon folding,
peptide:MHC complexes were transferred to 384 well plates where they were challenged with
4 different urea concentrations. Following the period of urea-induced stress the plates were
developed in a conventional ELISA as described previously ​(Justesen et al. 2009;
Sylvester-Hvid et al. 2002)​. ​The ABS450 nm signals from the 4 different wells were averaged
and normalised to the included reference to the included reference peptides in wells A1 and
H12.

(​http://jumong.kaist.ac.kr:8080/convmhc​, ​http://biopharm.zju.edu.cn/deephlapan/​,
http://hlathena.tools/​, respectively).
All tested peptides were subjected to in silico predictions (with each prediction tool)
regarding their available allotype. Predictions were compared against measured stability
determinations obtained through the NeoScreen​Ⓡ​ assay. Measurements were normalised to an
allotype-specific reference peptide (stability = 100). The list of reference peptides used is
available in supplementary material (Table S1.). The threshold for a stable binder was set to
60. Predictions were subsequently evaluated according to commonly-used metrics such as the
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and its Area Under Curve (AUC) to visualise the
relationship between sensitivity and specificity. Spearman correlation was also used to
compare the ranked correlation of predicted and measured data.

PrdX
To assess the performance of predictors trained on stability data we used PyTorch ​(Paszke et
al. 2017)​ to train a fully connected, feed-forward neural network with 64 and 32 hidden units
on historic in-house stability data from allotype A*02:01. This data contains a mixture of
human cancer-related stability measurements and measurements made on synthetic random
peptides. We used BLOSUM62 matrix for encoding, simple network architecture, train-test
split and early stopping for training.
