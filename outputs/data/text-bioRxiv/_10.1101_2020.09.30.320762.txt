Abstract

15

Coronaviruses infect many different species including humans. The last two decades have

16

seen three zoonotic coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2 causing a pandemic in 2020.

17

Coronaviral non-structural proteins (nsp) built up the replication-transcription complex

18

(RTC). Nsp7 and nsp8 interact with and regulate the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and

19

other enzymes in the RTC. However, the structural plasticity of nsp7+8 complex has been

20

under debate. Here, we present the framework of nsp7+8 complex stoichiometry and

21

topology based on a native mass spectrometry and complementary biophysical techniques of

22

nsp7+8 complexes from seven coronaviruses in the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus

23

including SARS-CoV-2. Their complexes cluster into three groups, which systematically form

24

either heterotrimers or heterotetramers or both, exhibiting distinct topologies. Moreover,

25

even at high protein concentrations mainly heterotetramers are observed for SARS-CoV-2

residues and an assembly model is proposed.

Introduction

29

Seven coronaviruses (CoV) from six coronavirus species are known to cause infections in

30

humans. While four of these viruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1)

31

predominantly cause seasonal outbreaks of (upper) respiratory tract infections with mild

32

disease symptoms in most cases, three other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and

33

SARS-CoV-2) of recent zoonotic origin are associated with lower respiratory tract disease

34

including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1-3]. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic

35

agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and

36

outcomes. First detected in December 2019, it quickly became pandemic with numbers still

37

growing (>30 million confirmed cases, >1,000,000 deaths, by end September 2020) [4-6].

38

COVID-19 caused major perturbations of historical dimensions in politics, economics and

39

healthcare. Moreover, coronaviruses are important, widespread animal pathogens as

40

illustrated by feline intestine peritonitis virus (FIPV) causing a severe and often fatal disease

41

in cats [7] or porcine coronaviruses [8], such as transmissible-gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or

42

porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the latter causing massive outbreaks and economic

43

losses in swine industry.

44

The viral replication machinery is largely conserved across the different coronavirus species

45

from the four currently recognized genera Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus

46

(subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, family Coronaviridae) [9]. The key components are generally

47

referred to as nonstructural proteins (nsp) and encoded by the viral replicase genes (ORFs 1a

48

and 1b) and translated as parts of the replicase polyproteins pp1a (nsp1-11) or pp1ab (nsp1-

49

16). Translation of the ORF1b-encoded C-terminal part of pp1ab requires a ribosomal (-1)-

50

frameshift immediately upstream of the ORF1a stop codon. Two proteases called PLpro (one

51

or two protease domains in nsp3) and Mpro (also called 3CLpro or nsp5) facilitate polyprotein

52

processing into 16 (sometimes 15) mature nsps. The majority of these nsps form a membrane-

53

anchored, highly dynamic protein-RNA machinery, the replication-transcription complex

54

(RTC), which mediates replication of the ~30 kb single-strand (+)-sense RNA genome and

55

production of subgenomic mRNAs [9, 10].

56

The main CoV-RTC building block is the fastest known RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase

57

(RdRp) residing in the nsp12 C-terminal domain [11]. For RdRp activity, nsp12 requires

58

binding to its cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 [12]. Recently, high-resolution structures illuminated

59

two binding sites at nsp12, the first for an nsp7+8 (1:1) heterodimer and the second for a

60

single nsp8 [13-16]. For in vitro RdRp activity assays, different methods were used to

61

assemble the polymerase complex [11, 17, 18]. So far, the highest processivity in vitro was

62

obtained by mixing nsp12 with a flexibly linked nsp7L8 fusion protein.

63

Recently, we reported that SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 form a heterotetramer (2:2) in solution,

64

in which nsp7 subunits have no self-interaction and rather sandwich an nsp8 scaffold with

65

putative head-to-tail interactions [19]. Current knowledge of full-length nsp7+8 complexes is

66

mainly based on two X-ray crystal structures, each of which displays a different quaternary

67

conformation. First, a SARS-CoV nsp7+8 (8:8) hexadecamer is assembled from four (2:2)

68

heterotetramers with similar topologies but two distinct conformations, T1 and T2, which are

69

both consistent with our in solution structure [19] [20]. Second, in a feline coronavirus (FIPV)

70

nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimer, nsp8 is associated to two nsp7 molecules that self-interact [21].

71

Moreover, structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with N-terminally truncated forms of

72

nsp8, thus lacking the self-interaction domain, revealed heterotetrameric nsp7+8 complexes

73

around an nsp7 scaffold [22, 23].

74

Current knowledge of coronavirus nsp7+8 complexes suggests a remarkable architectural

75

plasticity but is unsupportive of deducing common principles of complex formation.

76

Moreover, it is unknown if the quaternary structure of nsp7+8 is conserved within a given

77

coronavirus species or between genera. To fill these knowledge gaps, we analyzed nsp7+8

78

complexes derived from seven viruses of the Alpha- and Betacoronavirus genera, including a

79

range of human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and HCoV-

80

229E (Table S 2). We used native mass spectrometry (MS) to illustrate the landscape of

81

nsp7+8 complexes in vacuo, collision induced dissociation tandem MS (CID-MS/MS) to

82

reconstruct complex topology and complementary methods to verify the results [24, 25]. Our

83

findings reveal distinct sets of nsp7+8 complexes for the different CoV species. The results

84

hint at the properties that lead to complex heterogeneity and suggest common principles of

85

complex formation based on two conserved binding sites.

cleavage of the longer nsp7-11-His6 precursor resulted in additional processing intermediates (labeled A, B, C). In
all three complexation groups, nsp7+8 (1:1) heterodimeric intermediates are observed (green). For spectra of all
seven CoV nsp7+8 complexes see Figure S 2.

species in solution, while CID-MS/MS confirms the stoichiometry of protein complexes.

102

Distinct oligomerization patterns of nsp7+8 (1:1) heterodimers, (2:1) heterotrimers and (2:2)

103

heterotetramers in the different CoV allowed us to categorize their nsp7+8 complexes into

104

three groups (Figure 1, Figure S 2). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (species Severe acute

105

respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, genus Betacoronavirus) represent nsp7+8 group A

106

complex formation pattern (Figure 1 A). Consistent with our previous work, SARS-CoV

107

nsp7+8 complexes exist primarily as a heterotetramer comprising two copies of each nsp7

108

and nsp8 (2:2) [19]. Expectedly, SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 form identical (2:2) complexes given the

109

high sequence identity of 97.5 % in the nsp7-8 region (Table S 2). Next, relative peak

110

intensities in native MS of nsp7+8 complexes are converted in a semi-quantitative analysis

111

into abundances of complex species [26]. The heterodimer (2-4 %) is much less abundant

112

than the heterotetramer (96-98 %) suggesting high affinity and hence efficient conversion of

113

heterodimeric intermediates into heterotetramers. Hence, group A only forms two types of

114

nsp7+8 complexes, heterodimers (1:1) and -tetramers (2:2), with the latter clearly being

115

predominant.

116

In FIPV and TGEV from the species Alphacoronavirus 1, genus Alphacoronavirus, nsp7 and

117

nsp8 proteins share a sequence identity of 93.9% (Table S 2). Their nsp7+8 complexes are

118

assigned to group B forming predominantly nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimers (83 %) and to a lesser

119

extent heterodimers (1:1) (~17 %) (Figure 1 B). An nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimeric structure has

120

previously been reported for FIPV but not for TGEV or any other CoV. The association of a

121

single nsp8 with two nsp7 indicates that group B nsp7+8 complexes lack the ability to form

122

tetramers around an nsp8 scaffold.

123

The third oligomerization pattern is observed for nsp7+8 of HCoV-229E and PEDV, which

124

represent different species in the genus Alphacoronavirus. They share only 70.9 % sequence

125

identity in the nsp7-8 region and even less (42-62 %) with the other CoV species examined

126

(Table S 2). PEDV and HCoV-229E nsp7+8 form three major types of oligomers with slightly

127

different efficiencies: heterodimers (1:1), heterotrimers (2:1) and heterotetramers (2:2)

128

(HCoV-229E: 20 %, 12 % and 69 %; PEDV: 52 %, 6 % and 42 %, respectively) (Figure 1 C). By

129

forming both, heterotrimers and -tetramers, these complexes combine properties described

130

above for groups A and B, and are hence categorized into a separate group named

131

accordingly AB. This begs the question whether assembly pathways and structures of

132

heterotetramers in group A and AB are similar. Either, two heterodimers form a

133

heterotetramer around an nsp8 scaffold as in group A [19] or alternatively the heterotrimer

134

recruits another nsp8 subunit to the complex, thus employing an nsp7 core [21]. The latter

135

pathway has recently been reported for SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 heterotetramers containing N-

136

terminally truncated nsp8 [23].

137

Additionally, nsp7+8 complexation after Mpro mediated cleavage of a MERS-CoV nsp7-11-

138

His6 precursor is compared (Figure 1 D). This larger precursor, comprising nsp7, nsp8, nsp9

139

nsp10 and nsp11, behaves similar to nsp7-9-His6 (Figure S1) and is used because initial

140

attempts to cleave nsp7-8 only constructs failed. Proteolytic processing of this polyprotein

141

precursor leads to cleavage intermediates (Figure 1 D). Such processing intermediates have

142

been proposed to occur intracellularly and to function distinctly from the individual nsps in

143

e.g. regulation of RTC assembly and viral RNA synthesis [27]. Here, signal intensities of

144

these intermediates provide insights into the processing sequence. Surprisingly, the

145

dominant intermediate is nsp10-11-His6, despite the small size of nsp11 and a hence expected

146

high accessibility of the nsp10/11 cleavage site. Therefore, slow cleavage and prolonged

147

presence of an nsp10-11 intermediate may have functional implications warranting further

148

studies. Notably, in many CoV polyproteins the nsp10/11 and/or nsp10/12 cleavage sites

149

contain replacements (Pro in MERS-CoV) of the canonical P2 Leu residue conserved

150

throughout most Mpro cleavage sites, suggesting that slow or incomplete cleavage is

151

beneficial for these particular sites. Moreover, this cleavage site has different C-terminal

152

contexts in the two CoV replicase polyproteins, nsp10-11 in pp1a and nsp10-12 in pp1ab.

153

While the structure of the small nsp11 (~1.5 kDa) is unknown, nsp12 is a large folded protein

154

(~105 kDa), which potentially improves the accessibility of the nsp10/12 site for Mpro. Similar

155

effects have been observed for the nsp8/9 cleavage site, which is efficiently cleaved in the

156

protein but not in peptide substrates [19, 28]. The question remains if unprocessed nsp10-11

157

and/or nsp10-12 intermediates exist in virus-infected cells for prolonged times to fulfill

158

specific functions. Other detected intermediates are nsp7-8-9 and nsp9-10 lacking nsp11-His6.

159

Particularly, the nsp9-10 intermediate has not been identified in our analysis of SARS-CoV

160

nsp7-10 processing, suggesting differences in the in vitro processing order between SARS-

161

CoV and MERS-CoV.

162

MERS-CoV nsp7+8 forms heterodimers (1:1), -trimers (2:1) and -tetramers (2:2) (73 %, 8 %

163

and 19 %, respectively), thus demonstrating a group AB complexation pattern. However, we

164

cannot confirm the heterotrimer (2:1) formation by CID-MS/MS due to spectral complexity.

165

Moreover, because of incomplete cleavage as is evident from the cleavage intermediates,

166

signals assigned to the nsp7+8 heterodimer likely overlap with signals of unprocessed nsp7-

167

8. Thus, complete cleavage of nsp7-8 could shift the peak fractions from heterodimer to

168

heterotrimer or -tetramer.

169

Homodimerization of subunits and precursors.

170

In the mass spectra of nsp7+8 complexes, monomers and homodimers of nsp7 and nsp8 are

171

also observed. While nsp7 homodimers are identified for all seven CoV species tested, nsp8

172

homodimers are only detected for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which belong to group B

173

forming exclusively nsp7+8 heterotetramers around a dimeric nsp8 scaffold (Figure S 3).

174

Moreover, the oligomeric states of the different uncleaved nsp7-8 precursors are probed.

175

Notably, precursors from group B CoVs are mostly monomeric, whereas precursors from

176

group AB and A CoVs are in varying equilibria between monomers and dimers (Figure S 4).

177

The different oligomerization propensities of precursors suggest that molecular interactions

178

driving dimerization of nsp7-8 precursors could critically affect subsequent nsp7+8

179

oligomerization. For SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the nsp7-8 dimer affinity is low as two-

180

fold dilution to 9 µM shifted the equilibrium towards a monomeric state (Figure S 5). This is

181

in line with our previous findings [19], in which C-terminally extended SARS-CoV nsp7-9-

182

His6 and His6-nsp7-10 polyprotein constructs were mainly monomeric, suggesting that the

183

presence of the extra C-terminal sequence further destabilizes an already weak dimerization.

Figure 2: Gas-phase dissociation reveals complex topology. CID-MS/MS product ion spectra (A and C),
dissociation pathways and topology maps (B and D) for HCoV-229E nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimers and (2:2)
heterotetramers are shown. With increasing collisional voltage protein complexes are successively stripped from
their subunits revealing alternative dissociation pathways. The remaining dimeric species expose direct subunit
interactions in the nsp7+8 complexes (grey boxes). Charge states are labeled. (A and B) The heterotetramers (2:2)
undergo two consecutive losses resulting in dimeric product ions of nsp7+8 (1:1) and nsp82. These products
indicate that nsp7:nsp8 and nsp8:nsp8 have direct interfaces in heterotetramers. (C and D) HCoV-229E
heterotrimers dissociate into the dimeric products nsp7+8 (1:1) and nsp72 indicating direct interfaces between
nsp7:nsp8 and nsp7:nsp7 in heterotrimers. All CoV heterotrimers follow similar dissociation pathways, also all
CoV heterotetramers follow a common dissociation route, which allow a topological reconstruction of two
distinct complex architectures (Figure S 6-Figure S 10).

197

To deduce the complex topology in the different groups of nsp7+8 interaction patterns, we

198

applied CID-MS/MS using successive subunit dissociations to dissect conserved interactions.

199

CID-MS/MS of the HCoV-229E nsp7+8 heterotetramer (2:2) reveals two dissociation

200

pathways, in which first one nsp7 subunit is ejected from the complex followed by another

201

nsp7 or an nsp8 subunit. After two consecutive losses, the product ions are nsp7+8 (1:1) and

202

nsp82 dimers, providing evidence for specific subunit interfaces in the complex (Figure 2 A).

203

From these results, the complex topology is deduced as a heterotetramer based on an nsp82

204

dimer scaffold, in which each nsp8 binds only one nsp7 subunit. Strikingly, this is identical

205

to our previously reported SARS-CoV nsp7+8 heterotetramer (2:2) architecture [19]. In fact,

206

all nsp7+8 (2:2) heterotetramers of groups A and AB (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, PEDV,

207

HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV) resulted in similar dissociation pathways, subunit interfaces

208

and topology maps, suggesting that these structures are similar across these diverse CoVs.

209

Next, the dissociation pathway of the HCoV-229E nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimers is monitored in

210

CID-MS/MS (Figure 2 B). After ejection of one nsp7 or nsp8 subunit, product dimers of

211

nsp7+8 (1:1) and nsp72 are detected, indicating specific subunit interfaces between nsp7:nsp8

212

and nsp7:nsp7. Again, similar dissociation pathways and subunit interfaces are found for

213

group B and AB heterotrimers (FIPV, TGEV, HCoV-229E and PEDV). Topological

214

reconstructions reveal a heterotrimer forming a tripartite interaction between one nsp8 and

215

two nsp7 subunits. These results agree with the reported X-ray structure of FIPV nsp7+8 [21]

216

and indicate that heterotrimers of these CoVs species have similar arrangements. In turn, this

217

implies that heterotrimers and heterotetramers follow distinct assembly paths.

218

Chemical cross-linking confirms the formation of specific complexes.

219

To further support the native MS results, which relies on spraying from volatile salt solutions

220

(e.g. ammonium acetate, AmAc), complementary methods compatible with conventional

221

buffers supplemented with sodium chloride are applied. To provide additional evidence for

222

specific nsp7+8 complex formation, the FIPV and HCoV-229E nsp7+8 complexes are

223

stabilized via crosslinking with glutaraldehyde and subjected to XL-MALDI MS (Cross-

224

linking Matrix-assisted laser ionization MS) (Figure S 11). Peak areas in the MALDI mass

225

spectra are assigned to FIPV nsp7+8 heterodimer, heterotrimer and –tetramer (8.5 %, 9.5 %

226

and 4.2 %, respectively), and HCoV-229E nsp7+8 heterodimer, heterotrimer and –tetramer

227

(6.7 %, 5.3 % and 6.0 %, respectively). The results suggest a higher abundance of nsp7+8

228

heterodimer and -trimer complexes in FIPV than in HCoV-229E, while HCoV-229E contains

229

more heterotetramers. This largely agrees with the results from native MS. However, the

230

MALDI mass spectra show high background of virtually all possible nsp7+8 stoichiometries

231

(<200,000 m/z), probably due to over-crosslinking with the rather unspecific glutaraldehyde.

232

To refine these results, nsp7+8 complexes are stabilized with the amine specific crosslinker

233

BS3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S 12). Multiple stoichiometries are identified with a

234

few prominent bands highlighting the main complexes generated. These bands are assigned

to SARS-CoV nsp7+8 heterodimers and -tetramers, FIPV nsp7+8 heterodimers and -trimers

236

and HCoV-22E nsp7+8 heterodimers, heterotrimers and -tetramers of HCoV-229E, providing

237

additional support for the classification of nsp7+8 complexes into groups A (SARS-CoV), B

(FIPV) and AB (HCoV-229E).

Figure 3: DLS and SAXS reveal oligomeric state of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 at higher protein concentrations. At
increasing protein concentrations, the hydrodynamic radius (R0) remains stable but becomes more homogenous
in DLS. (A) shows two exemplary DLS plots (1 mg/ml; 15 mg/ml) and (B) how the radius R0 develops with
increasing protein concentration. Theoretical hydrodynamic radii (R0,theo) of heterotetramer and hexadecamer
candidate structures are indicated (red dashed lines). (C) displays SAXS curves collected at different solute
concentrations and (D) the fit of the curve computed from T1 tetramer (red line) to the SAXS data collected at
1.2 mg/mL (blue dots with error bars). (E) Radius of gyration (Rg) and (F) molecular weight estimated from the
SAXS data both stabilize with increasing concentration like in DLS on values that are in agreement with the R0,theo
of the T1 nsp7+8 (2:2) heterotetramer.

251

To test the stoichiometry at higher protein concentrations in solution, dynamic light

252

scattering (DLS) of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 from 1 to 15 mg/mL is performed (Figure 4 A). No

253

significant increase of the hydrodynamic radius (R0) occurrs with increasing concentration.

254

At the same time, the measured radii become more stable and fluctuate less, which suggests

255

a shift towards higher complex homogeneity and a reduced fraction of free nsp7 and nsp8.

256

For SARS-CoV-2, no complex structure is available for full-length nsp7+8 proteins but,

257

previously, a SARS-CoV nsp7+8 (8:8) has been reported using X-ray crystallography [20],

258

where high protein concentrations are deployed. In order to relate the average experimental

259

hydrodynamic radius (R0,exp = 4.25 ± 0.61 nm) to candidate structures, the theoretical

260

hydrodynamic radius is calculated for the SARS-CoV nsp7+8 (8:8) hexadecamer

261

(R0,theo = 5.80 ± 0.29 nm) and a subcomplex thereof, a putative nsp7+8 heterotetramer (2:2) in

262

T1 conformation (R0,theo = 4.52 ± 0.27 nm) (Figure S 13). This is the only model with full-length

263

nsp8 that agrees with the stoichiometry and topology determined by native MS. At

264

physiologically relevant concentrations from 1 to 10 mg/mL, the average experimental

265

hydrodynamic radius agrees well with the theoretical hydrodynamic radius of the

266

heterotetramer T1. Hence a heterotetramer is likely the prevailing species in solution (Figure

267

4 B).

268

To underpin the DLS results, SAXS data are collected on solutions of nsp7+8 at

269

concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 47.7 mg/ml. The normalized SAXS intensities increase at

270

low angles with increasing concentration (Figure 4 B and Table S 3), suggesting a change in

271

the oligomeric equilibrium and a formation of larger oligomers. This trend is well illustrated

272

by the evolution of the apparent radius of gyration and molecular weight of the solute

273

determined from the SAXS data (Figure 4 E and F). The increase in the effective molecular

274

weight, from about 50 to 80 kDa suggests that the change in oligomeric state is limited and

275

that the tetrameric state (MWtheo: 62 kDa) remains predominant in solution.

276

The SAXS data at low concentrations (<4 mg/mL) fit well the computed scattering from

277

heterotetramer T1 but misfits appear at higher concentration (Figure 4 D, structure of T1

278

shown in Figure S 13and the discrepancy χ2 reported in Table S 4). Mixtures of

279

heterotetramers and hexadecamers cannot successfully fitted to the higher concentration

280

data either (Figure S 14). To further explore the oligomeric states of nsp7+8, a dimer of T1 is

281

used to simultaneously fit the curves collected at different concentrations by a mixture of

282

heterotetramers and -octamers. Reasonable fits to all SAXS data are obtained with volume

283

fractions of heterooctamers growing from 0 to 0.52 with increasing concentration (Figure S

284

14). Based on the flexibility of the molecule and the multiple possible binding sites between

285

nsp7 and nsp8, it is not surprising that larger assemblies are observed at very high solute

286

concentrations. The SAXS and DLS results provide evidence that the nsp7+8 (2:2)

287

heterotetramer is the prevailing stoichiometry in solution at physiological concentrations (1-

288

10 mg/mL with volume fractions between 1 and 0.7).

289
290

Potential implications of sequence conservation on heterotrimer and -tetramer
formation.

291

To extend this analysis, we select candidate structures in agreement with the stoichiometry

292

and topology observed (Figure S 10). For the heterotetramer, two conformers of nsp7+8 (2:2)

293

subcomplexes, T1 and T2, of correct architecture can be extracted from the larger SARS-CoV

294

nsp7+8 hexadecamer [20] (pdb 2ahm), (Figure S 13 A). Both conformers constitute a head to

295

tail interaction of two nsp7+8 heterodimers mediated by an nsp8-nsp8 interface. Notably,

296

nsp8 in T1 is more extended, revealing an almost full-length amino acid sequence (2-193),

297

while in T2 the nsp8 N-terminal 35 to 55 residues are unresolved. For the heterotrimeric

298

complexes, the only deposited structure is the FIPV nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimer [21] (pdb

299

3ub0), which agrees well with our experimental topology (Figure S 13 B).

300

In order to identify molecular determinants for heterotrimer or -tetramer formation, the

301

candidate structures are examined for molecular contacts (van der Waals radius -0.4 Å). The

302

conservation of contact residues is evaluated in a sequence alignment to identify possible

303

determinants of different stoichiometries (Figure S 15). Notably, most amino acids lining

304

subunit interfaces in heterodimers, -trimers and -tetramers are conserved. The interfaces in

305

the candidate structures occupy two common structural portions of the nsp8 subunit (Figure

306

4 A). The first binding site (BS I) is located between the nsp8 head and shaft domain,

307

responsible for binding of nsp7 (I) in heterodimer formation, as seen in all available high

308

resolution structures of nsp7+8 [20-23] and the polymerase complex [13-16]. The second

309

binding site (BS II) appears highly variable in terms of its binding partner and lies at the nsp8

310

elongated N-terminus. In fact, one largely conserved motif (res60-70) is responsible for the

311

main contacts in the entire candidate complexes selected based on our data: nsp7+8 (2:2) T1

312

and T2 for the heterotetramer and nsp7+8 (2:1) for the heterotrimer. The respective

313

sidechains take positions on one side of the nsp8 α-helix and have the ability to form

interactions with either mainly nsp7 (partly nsp8) in the SARS-CoV nsp7+8 (2:2)

heterotetramer T1, mainly nsp8 (partly nsp7) in the SARS-CoV nsp7+8 heterotetramer T2 or

316

only nsp7 in the FIPV nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimer (Figure S 16 A-C). Due to its sequence

317

conservation, it is unlikely that alone this motif at BS II has a decisive impact for heterotrimer

318

or -tetramer formation.

(middle), from the larger (8:8) heterohexadecamer (pdb 2ahm) and the FIPV nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimer (right, pdb

binding sites are only shown for one nsp8 subunit (green). BS II is additionally labelled with nsp8 residue (res)
number forming the main interaction patch (BS II contact residues see Figure S 15). (B) Sequence alignment of
nsp8 (green, res55-92) and nsp7 (yellow, res74-78) is displayed for the seven CoVs. Two heterotrimer or -tetramer
specific contact sites (red) exhibit sequence conservation well in line with the complexation groups determined by
native MS. (C) In SARS-CoV T2, nsp8 Glu77 comes into contact with nsp8 Glu77, a unique heterotetramer
interaction, (D) which in a homology model of HCoV-229E based on T2 is replaced by nsp8 Asn78. (E) The FIPV
heterotrimer structure shows nsp7 Phe76, binding to nsp8 Met87 and Leu90, a contact unique for the heterotrimer
forming species. Insets show magnification of contact sites. Closest distances (3.0-3.8 Å) for relevant residues in
contact (red) are given.

334

Therefore, unique interactions could exist, which explain the shift in complex stoichiometry

335

from heterotrimer to -tetramer observed in the different CoVs categorized into group A, AB

336

and B (Figure 4 B). Here, we identify a possibly heterotetramer stabilizing contact site in T2,

337

where nsp8 Glu77 self-interacts with nsp8II Glu77, which gives the complex density and

338

compactness (Figure 4 C). This residue is only present in nsp8 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

339

2 from group A and MERS-CoV of group AB. However, homology models suggest that in

340

the other tetramer forming complexes of group AB, HCoV-229E and PEDV, nsp8 Asn78

341

could partially replace this interaction (Figure 4 D). This is different in group B viruses,

342

forming only heterotrimers, where residues at these positions are nsp8 Val77 and Asp78,

343

with the Asp78 possibly being solvent exposed and hence unable to replace this interaction.

344

Furthermore, we also identify a contact site possibly stabilizing the heterotrimer in the

345

crystal structure of the FIPV nsp7+8 (2:1), which reveals that a second subunit of nsp7

346

(nsp7II) is locked via Phe76 to nsp8 (Figure 4 E). Importantly, this residue is uniquely

347

conserved among trimer forming complexes of group B and group AB, but replaced by nsp7

348

Leu76 in the strictly heterotetramer forming group A.

349

These findings are compared to the recently released structure of the polymerase complex

350

(pdb 6xez, Figure S 16 D and E), comprising nsp7+8+12+13(1:2:1:2) [29]. The residues

351

potentially responsible for a shift in quaternary structure, nsp8 Glu77 or Asp78 and nsp7

352

Phe76, are distant from any protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction and thus are not

353

expected to play a role in polymerase complex formation. Surprisingly, the identical set of

354

residues in BS II supports all interactions (Glu60, Met62, Ala63, Met67 and Met70) between

355

nsp8b and nsp12/nsp13.1 and between nsp8a and nsp13b (Figure S 16 D and E). Notably,

356

within the polymerase complex amino acids involved in RNA binding point in the opposite

357

direction of the protein interfaces and have little or no role in nsp7+8 complex formation.

Discussion

360

Our findings reveal the nsp7+8 quaternary composition of seven CoVs representing five

361

coronavirus species of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus. Viruses of the same species

362

(SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and TGEV/FIPV, respectively) produce the same type of nsp7+8

363

complexes. Next to a conserved nsp7+8 heterodimer (1:1), the inherent specificity of nsp7+8

364

complex formation categorizes them into three groups: group A forming only

365

heterotetramers (2:2), group B forming only heterotrimers (2:1) and group AB forming both

366

heterotetramers (2:2) and heterotrimers (2:1). Complexes of the same stoichiometry exhibit a

367

conserved topology, consisting of an nsp8 homodimeric scaffold for the heterotetramers and

368

an nsp7 homodimeric core for the trimers. Candidate structures based on our results

369

highlight Alpha- and Betacoronavirus-wide conserved binding sites on nsp8, named BS I and

370

BS II, which provide the modular framework for a variety of complexes. Furthermore,

371

unique molecular contacts for the complex groups have the potential to determine the ability

372

and preference for heterotrimer and/or heterotetramer formation.

373

We provide evidence that, even at high concentrations, the SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8

374

heterotetramer (2:2) represents the predominant species. In order to relate our results to in

375

vivo conditions, we consider the following aspects: According to maximum molecular

376

crowding [30], polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab can reach a maximum of 125-450 µM, which

377

translates to 3.9-11.7 mg/mL nsp7+8. This range is covered by our DLS and SAXS analysis. In

378

absence of other interaction partners, we expect that, in vivo, the nsp7+8 (2:2) heterotetramer

379

represents the predominant nsp7+8 complex of SARS-CoV-2 and other heterotetramer

380

forming CoVs of complexation groups A and AB.

381

The heterotetramer candidate structures and models presented here are based on the

382

conformers T1 or T2 of the SARS-CoV heterohexadecamer structure, which contains full-

383

length nsp8 [20]. Although, our results cannot clarify, if one of these conformers is the

384

biologically relevant structure existing in solution, the combined evidence provided here

385

strongly suggests structural similarity to T1/T2. Considering the crystallographic origin of

386

T1/T2 and the overlap of binding sites, the heterotetramer could well be a flexible and

387

dynamic structure in solution.

388

In contrast to our findings, a SARS-CoV nsp7+8 hexadecamer structure has been reported

389

[20]. However, this structure has been derived from X-ray crystallography, hence showing a

390

static, frozen state, where the crystal lattice formation favors stabilized arrangements that

391

could differ from the solution state of the protein complexes. In the case of nsp8, the flexible

392

N-terminus could inhibit crystal formation, and has been removed in some studies [22, 23].

393

Alternatively, it may stabilize specific interactions, thereby promoting crystal formation by

394

binding to one of the multiple interfaces presented between nsp7 and nsp8, resulting in a

395

physiologically irrelevant larger oligomeric structure. The SAXS data presented here

396

partially supports this scenario at high protein concentrations but also confirms a

397

predominantly heterotetrameric assembly in solution. Thus, a potential shift of quaternary

398

structure from heterotetramer towards a higher-order complex, such as a heterohexadecamer

399

appears unlikely unless triggered e.g. by binding to nucleic acids as has been repeatedly

400

described for nsp7+8 complexes [20].

401

All seven CoV nsp7 and nsp8 proteins shown here also form heterodimers (1:1). Such

402

heterodimeric subcomplexes with nsp7 bound to nsp8 BS I have been observed in all

403

deposited complex structures containing nsp7+8 [20-23] or nsp12 [13-16]. Therefore, the

404

heterodimer represents the most basic form of nsp7+8 complexes and likely serves as

405

universal substructure building block in the coordinated assembly of functional RTCs of

406

CoVs from the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus. Moreover, heterotrimer and -tetramer

407

formation are based on a second canonical binding site at the nsp8 N-terminal domain, BS II.

408

This site appears to have a high propensity to form complexes with various binding partners

409

(e.g. nsp7+8, nsp12 or nsp13). Accordingly, our analysis suggests that the nsp8 BS II strives

410

for occupation. The nsp7+8 quaternary composition, topology and analysis of binding sites

411

presented here allow us to reconstruct and propose a model of the complex formation

412

pathway (Figure 5).

413

The preference for heterotrimer and -tetramer can probably be pinpointed to just a few

414

amino acids within nsp8 BS II or interacting with it. Here, we identify two contacts that

415

could have unique discriminatory potential for promoting heterotrimeric (nsp7 Phe76) or

416

heterotetrameric (nsp8 Glu77 and Asn78) quaternary structures. Notably in presence of nsp7

417

Phe76 and nsp8 Asn78, as observed for group AB, the heterotetramer is always more

418

abundant than the heterotrimer. However, compared to the entire BS II, theses contacts only

419

represent a small share of the binding interface and contribute little interaction energy

420

through van der Waals forces. Nevertheless, the unique position of their contacts could

421

critically determine the types of interactions with one or another binding partner.

Figure 5: Proposed model for nsp7+8 complex formation. (A) For complexes of group A, heterodimers form via
nsp8 BS I, which quickly dimerize via BS II into a heterotetramer. A theoretic route via a preformed nsp8 scaffold
is unlikely to play a role in heterotetramer formation since no nsp7+8 (1:2) intermediates are observed for
complexes of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Moreover,, nsp7 and nsp8 occupy neighboring positions in the replicase
polyproteins, thus favoring their interaction (in cis) at early stages in the infection cycle (when intracellular viral
polyprotein concentrations are low) over intermolecular interactions between different replicase polyprotein
molecules as is also evident from the low dimerization ability of the precursors. (B) For group B complexes, we
propose the formation of a heterodimer intermediate via nsp8 BS I or BS II and subsequent recruitment of a
second nsp7, resulting an nsp7+8 (2:1) heterotrimer. This is also supported by the relatively high peak fractions of
heterodimers detected. Group AB complexes can use both complexation pathways. In line with this, the proteins
also produce a relatively high heterodimer signal but, ultimately, prefer to form heterotetramers rather than
heterotrimers.

435

Since the critical residues required for nsp7+8 complex formation have no overlap with

436

nsp12 interaction sites, direct docking of preformed heterotrimers and -tetramers to nsp12

437

can be expected. Furthermore, heterotrimeric and -tetrameric structures are compatible with

438

accommodation of specific RNA structures similar to what has been suggested for

439

heterohexadecameric nsp7+8 by Rao et al. [14]. Notably, if heterotrimeric or -tetrameric

440

nsp7+8 structures were associated with nsp12, the binding site for nsp13 would be blocked,

441

which may have regulatory implications for CoV replication. Altogether, these conserved

442

binding mechanisms and overlapping binding sites confirm the proposed role of nsp8 as a

443

major interaction hub within the CoV RTC [31], and indicate critical regulatory functions by

444

specific nsp7+8 complexes.

445

Finally, we can only speculate about possible reasons for the existence of different nsp7+8

446

complexes: (1) Similar kinetic stability due to occupation of both binding sites (both

447

structures exist because they are equally efficient in occupying BS I and BS II), (2) unknown

448

functional relevance in CoV replication (e.g. specificity to RNA structures channeled to the

449

nsp12 RdRp) or (3) adaption to host factors and possible regulatory functions.

450

In summary, our work shows, and provides a framework to understand, the characteristic

451

distribution and structures of nsp7+8 (1:1) heterodimer, (2:1) heterotrimers and (2:2)

452

heterotetramers in representative alpha- and betacoronaviruses. The nsp7+8 structure in

453

solution can be used to investigate its independent functional role in the formation of active

454

polymerase complexes and, possibly, regulation and coordination of polymerase and other

455

RTC activities, for example in the context of antiviral drug development targeting different

456

subunits of CoV polymerase complexes reconstituted in vitro.

Cloning and gene constructs

459

The codon optimized sequence for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-8 region (NC_045512.2) was

460

synthesized by Eurofins scientific SE with overhangs suitable for insertion into pASK-

461

IBA33plus plasmid DNA (IBA Life Sciences). A golden gate assembly approach using Eco31I

462

(BsaI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to shuttle the gene into the plasmid. Linker and

463

tag of the expression construct SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-8-His6 contained the C-terminal amino

464

acids –SGSGSARGS-His6 (SGSG residues as P1’-P4’ of Mpro cleavage site and SARGS-His6

465

residues as the default linker of pASK vectors). The SARS-CoV nsp7-8 pASK33+ plasmid

466

generated previously [21, 32] was used for the expression of SARS-CoV nsp7-8-His6

467

containing the C-terminal amino acids –SARGS-His6. The expression plasmid for SARS-CoV

468

Mpro was generated as described by Xue et al.[33]. To produce nsp7-8-SGSGSARGS-His6

469

precursor proteins in Escherichia coli, the nsp7-8 coding sequences of HCoV-229E (HCoV-

Expression and purification

482

SARS-CoV Mpro was produced with authentic ends as described in earlier work [33]. To

483

produce the precursors, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-8-His6, BL21 Rosetta2 (Merck

484

Millipore) were transformed, grown in culture flasks to OD600 = 0.4-0.6, then induced with

485

50 µM anhydrotetracycline and continued to grow at 20 °C for 16 h. For pelleting, cultures

486

were centrifuged (6000 × g for 20 min) and cells were frozen at -20 °C. Cell pellets were lysed

487

in 1:5 (v/v) buffer B1 (40 mM phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) with one freeze-thaw

488

cycle, sonicated (micro tip, 70 % power, 6 times on 10 s, off 60 s; Branson digital sonifier SFX

489

150) and then centrifuged (20,000 × g for 45 min). Proteins were isolated with Ni2+-NTA beads

490

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) in gravity flow columns (BioRad). Proteins were bound to beads

491

equilibrated with 20 column volumes (CV) B1 + 20 mM imidazole, then washed with 20 CV

492

B1 + 20 mM imidazole followed by 10 CV of B1 + 50 mM imidazole. The proteins were eluted

493

in eight fractions of 0.5 CV B1 + 300 mM imidazole. Immediately after elution, fractions were

494

supplemented with 4 mM DTT. Before analysis with native MS, Ni2+-NTA eluted fractions

495

containing the polyprotein were concentrated to 10 mg/mL and further purified over a

496

10/300 Superdex 200 column (GE healthcare) in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl,

497

4 mM DTT, pH 8.0. The main elution peaks contained nsp7-8. For quality analysis, SDS-

498

PAGE was performed to assess the sample purity.

499

To obtain a pre-purified SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 complex for DLS and SAXS, eluate fractions

500

from the Ni2+-NTA column containing the nsp7-8-His6 were concentrated and the buffer

501

exchanged with a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris,

502

pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT and 4 mM MgCl2 (SEC-buffer). Then nsp7-8-His6 was

503

eluted with 3.5 mL SEC-buffer and subsequently cleaved with MPro-His6 (1:5, MPro-His6: nsp7-

504

8-His6) for 16 h at RT. Mpro-His6 was removed with Ni-NTA agarose and the cleaved nsp7+8

505

complex was subjected to a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg size exclusion column

506

equilibrated with SEC-buffer.

507

The HCoV-229E, PEDV, FIPV and TGEV nsp7-8-His6 and MERS-CoV nsp7-11-His6 precursor

508

proteins were produced and purified as described before (Tvarogová et al., 2019) with a

509

slightly modified storage buffer. Anion exchange chromatography fractions of the peak

510

containing the desired protein were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled and dialyzed against

511

storage buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT).

512

MBP-nsp5-His6 fusion proteins were purified using Ni2+-IMAC as described before

513

(Tvarogová et al., 2019). To produce HCoV-229E and FIPV MBP-nsp5-His6, E. coli TB1 cells

514

were transformed with the appropriate pMAL-c2-MBP-nsp5-His6 construct and grown at

515

37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). When an OD600 of 0.6 was reached,

516

protein production was induced with 0.3 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)

517

and cells were grown for another 16 h at 18 °C. Thereafter, the cultures were centrifuged

518

(6000 × g for 20 min) and the cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0,

519

300 mM NaCl, 5 % glycerol, 0.05 % Tween-20, 10 mM imidazole and 10 mM β-

520

mercaptoethanol) and further incubated with lysozyme at 4 °C (0.1 mg/mL) for 30 min.

521

Subsequently, cells were lysed by sonication and cell debris was removed by centrifugation

522

for 30 min at 40,000 × g and 4°C. The cell-free extract was bound to pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA

523

(Qiagen) matrix for 3 h. Ni2+-IMAC elution fractions were dialyzed against buffer comprised

524

of 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM DTT and cleaved with

525

factor Xa to release nsp5-His6. Then, nsp5-His6 was passed through an amylose column and

526

subsequently bound to Ni2+-NTA matrix to remove any remaining MBP. Following elution

527

from the Ni2+-NTA column, nsp5-His6 was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl,

528

pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT) and stored at -80 °C until further use.

529

Native mass spectrometry

530

To prepare samples for native MS measurements, Mpro was buffer exchanged into 300 mM

531

AmAc, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0 by two cycles of centrifugal gel filtration (Biospin mini columns,

532

6,000 MWCO, BioRad) and the precursors were transferred into 300 mM AmAc, 1 mM DTT,

533

pH 8.0 by five rounds of dilution and concentration in centrifugal filter units (Amicon,

534

10,000 MWCO, Merck Millipore). Cleavage and complex formation was started by mixing

535

nsp7-8-His6 and protease Mpro with final concentrations of 15 µM and 3 µM, respectively.

536

Three independent reactions were started in parallel and incubated at 4 °C overnight.

537

Tips for nano-electrospray ionization (nanoESI) were pulled in-house from borosilicate

538

capillaries (1.2 mm outer diameter, 0.68 mm inner diameter, with filament, World Precision

539

Instruments) with a micropipette puller (P-1000, Sutter Instruments) using a squared box

540

ﬁlament (2.5 × 2.5 mm, Sutter Instruments) in a two-step program. Subsequently, tips were

541

gold-coated using a sputter coater (Q150R, Quorum Technologies) with 40 mA, 200 s, tooling

542

factor 2.3 and end bleed vacuum of 8×10−2 mbar argon.

543

Native MS was performed at a nanoESI quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instrument (Q-

544

TOF2, Micromass/Waters, MS Vision) modified for higher masses [34]. Samples were ionized

545

in positive ion mode with voltages applied at the capillary of 1300-1500 V and at the cone of

546

130-135 V. The pressure in the source region was kept at 10 mbar throughout all native MS

547

experiments. For desolvation and dissociation, the pressure in the collision cell was

548

1.5 × 10-2 mbar argon. For native MS, accelerating voltages were 10 - 30 V and quadrupole

549

profile 1,000 - 10,000 m/z. For CID-MS/MS, acceleration voltages were 30 - 200 V. Raw data

550

were calibrated with CsI (25 mg/mL) and analyzed using MassLynx 4.1 (Waters). Peak

551

deconvolution and determination of relative intensity was performed using UniDec [35]. All

552

determined masses are provided (Table S 1).

553

XL-MALDI

554

Pre-purified FIPV nsp7+8 and HCoV-229E nsp7+8 at 20 µM were cross-linked with 0.15 %

555

glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 25 min before diluting them to 1 µM in MALDI

556

matrix solution (sinapinic acid 10 mg/mL in acetonitrile/water/TFA, 49.95/49.95/0.1, v/v/v)

557

and spotting (1 µL) onto a stainless steel MALDI target plate. The MALDI-TOF/TOF mass

558

spectrometer (ABI 4800, AB Sciex) equipped with a high-mass detector (HM2, CovalX) was

559

used in linear mode. For acquiring mass spectra (1,000 to 1,000,000 m/z) spots were ionized

560

with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) and 500 shots per spectrum were accumulated. Obtained raw

561

data were smoothed and analyzed using mMass (v5.5.0, by Martin Strohalm [36]).

562

DLS

563

To check the monodispersity of the samples and to study the stoichiometry of the nsp7+8

564

complexes, DLS measurements were performed with the Spectro Light 600 (Xtal Concepts).

565

The complex was concentrated to various concentrations and samples were spun down for

566

10 min at 12,000 rpm and 4 °C. A Douglas Vapour batch plate (Douglas instruments) was

567

filled with paraffin oil and 2 µL of each sample was pipetted under oil. DLS measurements

568

for each sample were performed at 20 °C with 20 measurements for 20 s each, respectively.

569

SAXS

570

SAXS data were collected on the P12 beamline of EMBL at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY,

571

Hamburg). X-ray wavelength of 1.24 Å (10 keV) was used for the measurements, scattered

572

photons were collected on a Pilatus 6M detector (Dectris), with a sample to detector distance

573

of 3 m. Data were collected on 22 concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 48 mg/mL nsp7+8 in

574

50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT and 4 mM MgCl2, pure buffer was measured

575

between samples. For each data collection, 20 frames of 100 ms were collected. 2D scattering

576

images were radially averaged and normalized to the beam intensity. The frames were

577

compared using the program Cormap [37, 38], and only similar frames were averaged and

578

used for further analysis to avoid possible beam-induced effects. Scattering collected on the

579

pure buffer was subtracted from that of the sample and the resulting curves were normalized

580

to the protein concentration to obtain the scattering of nsp7+8 complexes.

581

The data processing pipeline SASflow was used for data reduction and calculation of the

582

overall SAXS parameters [38]. Molecular weights were inferred from different molecular

583

calculation methods using a Bayesian assessment [39]. The program CRYSOL was used to

584

compute the theoretical curves from the atomic structures [40]. Volume fractions of the

585

components of the oligomeric mixtures were computed and fitted to the data using the

586

program OLIGOMER [41]. The dimer of T1 was built by the program SASREFMX [42],

587

which builds a dimeric model that fits best, in mixture with the monomeric T1, multiple

588

scattering curves collected at different concentrations.

589

Visualization

590

Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with UCSF ChimeraX, developed by the

591

Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California,

592

San Francisco, with support from National Institutes of Health R01-GM129325 and the Office

Figure S 1: Mpro mediated processing of precursor protein constructs. SDS-PAGE analysis of Mpro (nsp5)mediated processing and generation of coronavirus nsp7+8 complexes with authentic N- and C-termini from
polyprotein precursors nsp7-8, nsp7-8-9 and nsp7-11. The nsp7+8 complexes of HCoV-229E, PEDV, FIPV, TGEV,
and SARS-CoV were produced from the respective nsp7-8-His6 precursors and MERS-CoV was produced from an
nsp7-9-His6 precursor. Precursor proteins were purified by Ni2+-IMAC and ion-exchange chromatography. Then,
15 µg protein was cleaved with Mpro (nsp5-His6, 5 µg) for 48 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, His6-tag containing cleavage
products were removed by passing the material through a Ni2+-IMAC column and nsp7+8 complexes were
enriched by ion-exchange chromatography. (A) SDS-PAGE showing the purified Mpro (nsp5-His6) – lanes 1, 5, 9,
13, 17; nsp7-8- His6 – lanes 2, 6, 10, 14, 18; Mpro-mediated cleavage reaction – lanes 3, 7, 11, 15, 19; enriched nsp7+8

experimental molecular weight Mexp of the precursors agrees with the sequence-derived theoretical Mtheo
(Table S 1). Only FIPV nsp7-8 contained two mass species separated by ~110 Da. This heterogeneity was
attributed to the precursor’s central nsp8 domain following Mpro processing. Assignment to an amino acid

(A) Product ion spectra of PEDV 16+ nsp7+8 (2:2) heterotetramers are shown at two different CV. At 80 V CV, the
dissociation of one nsp7 or alternatively one nsp8 occurs, as indicated by the high and low charge products.
Notably, the high charge state of the dissociated nsp8 suggests an extended shape of the ion. At 140 V CV, nsp8
dissociates at lower charge states suggesting alternative dissociation pathways. (B) Product ion spectra of HCoV229E 16+ nsp7+8 (2:2) heterotetramers at 140 V are similar to the PEDV heterotetramers. (C and D) The zoom
(2000-9000 m/z), excluding the nsp8 high charge states, reveals additional product species (e.g. the nsp82
homodimer). (E) Schematic pathway of dissociation allows for a topological reconstruction of the PEDV and
HCoV-229E heterotetramer.

most abundant nsp7+8 complexes: (1:1) heterodimer (32.4 kDa) and (2:1) heterotrimer (42.5 kDa). Abundance is
determined from relative peak areas as indicated (red). (B) MALDI mass spectrum of HCoV-229E nsp7+8
crosslinked with 0.15 % glutaraldehyde for 25 min at 4 °C. Inset shows most abundant nsp7+8 complexes: (1:1)

indicated (blue). Symbols depict stoichiometry of mass species of nsp7 (yellow) and nsp8 (green) with highest
signal strength. Masses are higher in crosslinked samples due to the additional glutaraldehyde molecules. Mass
spectra were not calibrated. Each spectrum shown was generated from three MALDI spots. Most signals, except
for the HCoV-229E heterotetramer, above 50,000 m/z are low abundant and likely due to over-crosslinking.

Figure S 13: Candidate structures in agreement with the observed stoichiometries and topologies observed. (A)
For the full-length heterotetramer, an isolated structure does not exist. However from the larger SARS-CoV
nsp7+8 hexadecamer [20] (pdb 2ahm), two conformer subcomplexes of nsp7+8 (2:2), T1 and T2, can be extracted.
Both conformers constitute a head-to-tail interaction of two heterodimers by an nsp8:nsp8 interface. Notably,
nsp8 in T1 is more extended, containing an almost full-length amino acid sequence (2-193), while in T2 the nsp8
N-terminal 35 to 55 residues are unresolved. (B) For the trimeric complexes, the only deposited structure is
FIPV nsp7+8 (2:1) trimer [21] (pdb 3ub0), which agrees well with our experimental topology.

(pdb 3ub0). (D) Cryo electron microscopy structure of the nsp7+8+12+13 (1:2:1:1) polymerase complex (pdb 6xez)
[29]. The two subunits of nsp8 (green), bind as a monomer nsp8a and as a nsp7+nsp8b heterodimer to the nsp12
RdRp. From there, nsp8a and nsp8b extend and interact as a facet with the RNA duplex and also individually
with one subunit of the nsp13 helicase. The molecular contacts between nsp8 and nsp12/13 are mediated by
exactly the same amino acids in the nsp8 BS II that are involved in nsp7+8 complex formation. (E) Zoom into the
interacting region at nsp8a and nsp8b BS II and its amino acids in contact (VDW radius -0.4 Å) with the nsp12
thumb domain (brown), nsp13.1 and nsp13.2 (blue). All side chains of residues involved in contacts are displayed.
