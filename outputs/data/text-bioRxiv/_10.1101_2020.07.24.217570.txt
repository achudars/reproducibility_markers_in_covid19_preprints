Abstract:
A novel STING agonist CDGSF unilaterally modified with phosphorothioate and fluorine was
synthesized. CDGSF displayed better STING activity over dithio CDG. Immunization of SARSCoV-2 Spike protein with CDGSF as an adjuvant elicited an exceptional high antibody titer and a
robust T cell response, which were better than the group using aluminium hydroxide as a adjuvant.
These results highlighted the adjuvant potential of STING agonist in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
preparation for the first time.
Main Text:
Being a potent immunostimulator, cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) could activate the STING
(STimulator of INterferon Genes) pathway, leading to the production of type I interferon (IFN β)
and other pro-inflammatory cytokines.1,2 Type I interferon plays a vital role in regulating the crosspriming of CD8+T cells.3 Locating on the endoplasmic reticulum of antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
and B cell, STING protein could bind cyclic 2’,3’-GAMP produced by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
(cGAS) or cyclic di-GMP (CDG), cyclic di-AMP (CDA) and 3’3’-GAMP from bacteria.4,5 STING
pathway serves as a central mediator of antitumor/antivirus immunity and has been an attractive
target for cancer immunotherapy and auto-immune diseases treatment. Intratumoral administration
of phosphorothioated CDA alone or with anti-PD-1 (Keytruda), anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab) are
being studied in phase Ib clinical trials by Novartis and Merck (NCT02675439, NCT03010176).4
The coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2 is still in
a pandemic around the world, which has resulted in more than 12,000,000 cases and more than
520,000 deaths. To control the ongoing global pandemic, the research and development of
therapeutic and prophylactic interventions like Remdesivir (Veklury) and vaccine are being speeded
up.6 As an effective strategy to contain the large-scale transmission, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have
been placed in great hopes. SARS-CoV-2 is found to be a β-coronavirus and depends on the
interaction between its surface envelope-embedded spike (S) glycoproteins and human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptors to initiate virus entry, just like SARS-CoV.7 Therefore, to
block the infection, S protein has been recognized as a key antigen for vaccine preparation.8
Inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant S protein vaccine, DNA/RNA vaccine, and recombinant
adenovirus (S protein gene) vectored vaccine are the major COVID-19 vaccine types studied in
preclinical and clinical trial.9 Except vectored vaccine, other types, especially inactivated and
recombinant protein vaccine, need the help of adjuvant like aluminium hydroxide to elicit a robust
and durable immune responses while reducing antigen doses and injection times. Though approving
as an adjuvant by FDA, aluminium hydroxide usually induces a Th2-dominant response and hardly
elicit cellular immunity.10 While, Dong and Sette et al. had respectively identified a high percent
(70% CD8+T, 100% CD4+T) SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T cells in COVID-19 convalescent
patients, correlating with antibody titers.11,12 This indicates a key role of adaptive immunity in
clearing virus-infected cells and reducing inflammation.13 Considering great efficacy of CDNs in
producing type I IFN for T cell response, we decide to explore the adjuvant effect of CDNs on
SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S protein vaccine for the first time and hope to provide a novel choice
for coping with emerging pandemic (Fig. 1a).
Despite the potency of CDNs in immunotherapy and adjuvant, the negative charges,
instability and hydrophilicity have greatly impeded their biomedical applications. 4 Two
phosphate groups in CDNs restrict their entry into the cell cytosol to interact with STING

protein. And the degradation of CDNs by phosphoesterase also reduces their stimulating
efficiency. To overcome the drawbacks, we decided to modify the CDNs structure with
fluorine and phosphorothioate.
Here, we chose CDG as a model CDNs. To improve CDG stability, we have synthesized
a novel CDG analogue CDGSF for the first time which replaced one 2’-OH with F atom and
one phosphate diesters with phosphorothioate diesters at the same side (Fig. 1b). CDGSF
showed enhanced activity compared with phosphorothioated CDG (dithio CDG, Fig. 1b).
Besides, recombinant S protein immunization with CDG SF as an adjuvant elicited a robust
humoral (IgG) and cellular (T cell) response, which was better than aluminium hydroxide
group.

Synthesis of CDG analogue CDGSF
The CDG analogue CDGSF was synthesized based on Jones and co-workers’ one flask
solution-phase strategy.14-16 After a few attempts, some conditions and raw materials had
been adjusted as shown in synthetic route (Scheme 1). The commercial available 2’-F
guanosine phosphoramidite, D3, was adopted as the second portion to couple with
deprotected guanosine D2. To obtain the mono-phosphorothioate modification, sulfurization
with 3-((dimethylaminomethylidene)-amino)-3H-1,2,4-dithiazole-5-thione (DDTT) was
conducted after coupling. Following cyclization with 2-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2dioxaphosphorinane-2-oxide (DMOCP), the compound was oxidized with iodine to form the
second phosphodiester (D6). Finally, the target molecule CDG SF was acquired through deprotection and crystallization, with an overall yield of 40%.

CDGSF could efficiently activate macrophages in vitro
After finishing the synthesis, we were curious about the activity of CDG SF which had not
been studied before. We adopted J774A.1 cells (a STING-expressing mouse macrophage)
as a model cell line, since the macrophage is a critical immune cell for the antitumor and
adjuvant effect of CDNs. Considering that phosphorothioated CDNs is the preferential
form for clinical researches, 17 we adopted dithio CDG (Fig. 1b) as a control group. Because
of poor penetrability mentioned above, we added the agonists to cells with or without the
pre-treatment of a transfection reagent (see methods for details). After incubation, the cells
were labelled with anti-CD86 antibody for flow cytometry analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 2,
both of CDGSF and dithio CDG with transfection remarkably upregulated the expression
level of activation marker co-stimulatory molecule CD86. More importantly, CDG SF
induced higher CD86 level compared to dithio CDG either with or without the transfection.
The better performance of CDGSF could be owed to the fluorine modification which brought
CDGSF with improved liposolubility and stability.18 These results indicated that CDGSF was
capable of stimulating STING pathway efficiently and might be a better clinical choice
relative to dithio CDG. Besides, the poor results of dithio CDG and CDG SF without
transfection further highlighted the importance and urgency of developing the delivery
method (Fig. 2).

Immunization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with CDGSF induced a robust T cell
response
To explore the adjuvant effect of CDGSF on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we chose
recombinant Spike S1+S2 extracellular domain (ECD) glycoprotein (sequence:
YP_009724390.1) as a model antigen. Besides, Spike (S) protein plus aluminium hydroxide
(Alhydrogel® adjuvant 2%, 100 μg per mouse) was adopted as a control group.
Immunizations on Babl/c mice were performed for three times biweekly (Fig. 3a). One week
after last injection, sera and spleen samples were harvested. SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific
T cell response was assessed through IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay (IFN-γ
ELISPOT, see methods for details). Splenocytes were stimulated with 50 μg/mL S protein
for 36 h before forming IFN-γ spot. As shown in Fig. 3b, the number of IFN-γ-secreting S
protein-specific T cells in CDGSF group was much higher than Alum and S protein group.
As expected, Alum adjuvant contributed the limited promotion to the cellular response of S
protein. Besides, the spot numbers were corroborated by mouse spleen weight of each group
(Fig. 3c). This result proved that CDGSF could be an excellent adjuvant to significantly
improve the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, prior to Alum.

Immunization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with CDGSF elicited an exceptionally high
IgG titers
As to humoral response, we adopted enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) to
analyse the S protein-specific IgG titers with sera from immunized mice. The plate was
precoated with 0.1 μg/well S protein. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, S protein plus CDGSF
immunization elicited an exceptionally high SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titer (endpoint titer
up to 819,200), close to Qin’s Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and higher than IgG titers
(about 20,000) in recovered COVID-19 patients.19 While, Alum group did not exhibit the
adjuvant effect on S protein compared with S protein alone, suggesting the need of higher
aluminium hydroxide dose. The titers data demonstrated that CDGSF could also notably
enhance S protein-specific humoral response.
To further compare the relative intensity of cellular and humoral response induced by
CDGSF immunization, we detected antibody isotypes distribution in sera (Fig. 4b, dilution
1:12800). In general, the level of IgG1 isotype is related to humoral response (Th2) and the
generation of IgG2a reflects the T cell activation (IFN-γ, Th1). In anti-sera of CDGSF group,
the amount of IgG1 was relatively more than IgG2a, IgG2b and IgM, along with minimal
levels of IgG3 and IgA. The level ratio (2:1) of IgG1 and Ig2a revealed that the combination
of S protein and CDGSF generated a balanced cellular and humoral (Th1/Th2) response. In
Alum group, the higher level of IgM over IgG1 and IgG2a indicated an inefficient immune

Conclusion
In brief, we have designed and synthesized a novel CDN CDG SF which exhibited better
STING activity over dithio CDG. Besides, we proved for the first time that CDG SF could act
as an excellent adjuvant to notably improve the S protein-specific T cell and IgG titer level
of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, overcoming the drawbacks of aluminium hydroxide. These results
also suggest that STING agonists might provide a great and general adjuvant choice for
multiple kinds of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines including inactivated virus vaccine, recombinant
RBD protein vaccine, peptide vaccine and DNA/RNA vaccine.
