ABSTRACT The novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly contagious and can cause

9

serious acute respiratory illness syndromes, often fatal, called covid-19. It is an urgent priority to

10

better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms that will help in the development of

11

prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics that are very important to people health and socioeconomic

12

stability around the world. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key

13

factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane

14

fusion. Here the analysis of CoV-2 S protein revealed in S1subunit a B56-binding LxxIxE-like

15

motif that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This motif is absent in SARS-

16

CoV and MERS-CoV. PP2A is a major family of serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic cells.

17

Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during

18

pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses use multiple strategies to target

19

PP2A in order to manipulate host’s antiviral responses. The latest studies have indicated that

20

SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained inflammation in the host. Therefore, by controlling acute

21

inflammation; it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight

22

covid-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a

23

target for the development of a bioactive peptide and ligand inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.

INTRODUCTION

29
30

In March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that covid-19 situation is a

31

pandemic because of the speed and scale of transmission. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family

32

of enveloped single positive-stranded RNA viruses that can infect both mammalian and avian

33

species because their rapid mutation and recombination facilitate their adaptation to new hosts

34

(Graham and Baric, 2010; Li, 2013). They can cause severe, often fatal acute respiratory disease

35

syndromes named covid-19. CoVs are classified into Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and

36

Deltacoronavirus genetic genera. The novel betacoronavirus (betaCoVs) SARS-CoV-2 is

37

relatively close to other betaCoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),

38

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), bat coronavirus HKU4, mouse

39

hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and human OC43 coronavirus (HCoV-

40

OC43). SARS-CoV emerged in China (2002–2003) and spread to other countries (more than 8,000

41

infection cases and a fatality rate of ~10%) (Peiris et al., 2003). In 2012, MERS-CoV was detected

42

in the Middle East. It spread to multiple countries, infecting more than 1,700 people with a fatality

43

rate of ~36%.

44

The surface-located SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S (S) is a 1273 amino acid residues. It is a

45

homotrimeric, multidomain, and integral membrane protein that give coronaviruses the appearance

46

of having crowns (Corona in Latin) (Li, 2016). It is a key piece of viral host recognition (receptor-

47

recognition) and organ tropism and induces strongly the host immune reaction (Li, 2015). It is

48

subdivided to S1 subunit that binds to a receptor on the host cell surface and S2 subunit that permits

49

viral and host membranes fusion. S1 subunit is divided into two domains, an N-terminal domain

50

(NTD) and a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) that can function as viral receptors-

51

binding (Li, 2012). In addition, S1 subunit is normally more variable in sequence among different

52

CoVs than is the S2 subunit (Masters, 2006).

53

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major family of serine/threonine phosphatases in eukaryotic

54

cells and regulates diverse biological processes through dephosphorylation of numerous signaling

55

molecules. PPA2 and phosphatase 1 (PP1), regulates over 90% of all ser/thr dephosphorylation

56

events in eukaryotic cells (Eichhorn et al., 2009). PP2A is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme composed

57

of a stable heterodimer of the scaffold A-subunit (PP2A-A) and catalytic C-subunit (PP2A-C) and

58

a variable mutually exclusive regulatory subunit from four families (B (B55), B′ (B56), B″ and B‴)

59

which provide substrate specificity. The human B56 family consists of at least five different

60

members (α, β, γ, δ and ε). Phosphatases and kinases are big players in the regulation of pro-

61

inflammatory responses during microbial infections. Moreover, studies have revealed that viruses

62

use multiple strategies to target PP2A in the aim to manipulate host antiviral responses (Guergnon

63

et al., 2011). Here, face to urgent priority to fight the novel SARS-CoV-2 due to its grave

64

consequences in the human health and socioeconomic stability around the world, S protein was

65

analyzed because its importance in mediating infection. This analysis revealed in S1subunit a B56-

66

binding LxxIxE-like motif that could recruit the host PP2A. The interaction S1 subunit-host PP2A-

67

B56 could be a target for the development of a bioactive peptide and ligand inhibitors for

68

therapeutic purposes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

71
72
73
74

Two LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits of Spike S

75

(http://elm.eu.org/) revealed short linear motifs (SLiMs) known as LxxIxE-like motif

76

,293LDPLSE298 in S1 subunit and

77

acid residues (3-15) in proteins that facilitate protein sequence modifications and protein-protein

78

interactions (Davey et al., 2012; Van Roey et al., 2014). Viruses are known to mutate quickly and

79

thus create mimic motifs, on very short time scales, that could hijack biological processes in the

80

host cell such as cell signaling networks (Davey et al., 2015; Via et al., 2015; Davey et al., 2011).

81

Interestingly,

82

coronaviruses S protein analysed in this study. In order to interact with protein(s), 293LDPLSE298

83

must be present at the surface of S1 subunit. Indeed, it is exposed in the surface of S1 subunit in

84

the end of NTD (Fig. 3B). Additionally, this motif could be an antigenic epitope to generate

85

antibodies and/or can help the design of vaccine components and immuno-diagnostic reagents. A

Interactions of 293LDPLSET299and 1197LIDLQEL1203 with Subunit B56-PP2A

94

docking was performed with the software AutoDock vina (Trott and Olson, 2010). Fig. 4 shows

95

that peptides are localized in the same region as pS-RepoMan peptide (PDBid: 5SW9) and

96

important amino acids of LxxIxE-like motif are superposed with those of pS-RepoMan peptide

97

(Fig. 4C). Interestingly,

98

phosphorylated generating a negative charge that will interact with positive patch in subunit B56

99

of PP2A, enhancing binding affinity (Fig. 4A) (Nygren and Scott, 2015). According to Autodock

To compare the interactions between these peptides and B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A, molecular

293

LDPLSET299 contains a serine and threonine that could be

293

LDPLSET299is -4.8 Kcal/mol and this of

1197

LIDLQEL1203is -3.5

100

software, binding affinity of

101

Kcal/mol. The difference of binding affinity may explained by the phosphorylation of serine and

102

threonine. It is known that the binding affinity of SLiMs is relatively weak (low µmolar range)

103

(Gouw et al., 2018). This knowledge of molecular interactions of 293LDPLSET299 and B56-PP2A

104

will pave the way to design a peptide able to mimic the surface of B56-PP2A and strongly bind to

105

293

LDPLSET299 surface precluding PP2A's recruitment (Zaidman and Wolfson, 2016).

106
107
108
109

It has been shown in single RNA viruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Dengue fever virus (DENV)

110

that they recruit the host PP2A through its regulatory subunit B56-binding LxxIxE motif to activate

111

transcription and replication (Kruse et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2018). In addition, it has been

112

shown in mice infected with rhinovirus 1B (the most common viral infectious agent in humans) an

113

exacerbation of lung inflammation. Administrating Salmeterol (beta-agonist) treatment exerts anti-

114

inflammatory effects by increasing PP2A activity. It is probable that beta-agonists have the

115

potential to target distinct proinflammatory pathways unresponsive to corticosteroids in patients

116

with rhinovirus-induced exacerbations. (Hatchwell et al., 2014). It is interesting to learn about

117

Salmeterol drug and the possibility of using it in covid-19's patients with sustained and dangerous

118

inflammatory reaction.

3D modeling and molecular docking

129

of CoV-2 structure (PDBid: 6VSB_A). Unfortunately, the region containing 1197LIDLQEL1203

130

peptide has not been resolved in all known structures of spike S protein. So, Pep-Fold (Thevenet

131

et al., 2012) software was used to model de novo this peptide. The model quality of the peptide

132

was assessed by analysis of a Ramachandran plot through PROCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999).

133

The docking of the two peptides into regulatory subunit B56 of PPA2 (PDBid: 5SWF_A) was

134

performed with the software AutoDock vina (Trott and Olson, 2010). The 3D complex

135

containing regulatory subunit B56 of PPA2 and peptides was refined by using FlexPepDock

136

(London et al., 2011), which allows full flexibility to the peptide and side-chain flexibility to the

137

receptor. The electrostatic potential surface of the regulatory subunit B56 of PPA2 was realized

138

with PyMOL software (http://pymol.org/).

For docking, the coordinates of the 293LDPLSET299 peptide were extracted from spike S protein
