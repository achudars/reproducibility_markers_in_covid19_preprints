Abstract (216 words)
COVID-19 pandemic is the largest unprecedented viral pandemic of the 21st century. We

27 aimed to study the COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among medical and health
28 sciences students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We performed a cross-sectional study between
29 2nd June and 19th August 2020. The survey was developed using online Survey Monkey. The link
30 was distributed via UAE University to all students and via WhatsApp© groups. The self31 administered questionnaire was conducted in English and comprised of two parts: socio32 demographic characteristics and KAP towards COVID-19. A total of 712 responses to the
33 questionnaire were collected. 90% (n=695) were under-graduate, while 10% (n=81) were post34 graduate students. Majority (87%, n=647) stated that they obtained COVID-19 information from
35 multiple reliable sources. They were highly knowledgeable about COVID-19 pandemic but 76%
36 (n=539) did not recognize its routes of transmission. 63% (n=431) were worried of getting COVID37 19, while 92% (n=633)) were worried that a family member could get infected with the virus. 97%
38 (n=655) took precautions when accepting home deliveries, 94% (n=637) had been washing their
39 hands more frequently, and 95% (n=643) had been wearing face masks. In conclusion, participants
40 showed high levels of knowledge and awareness about COVID-19. They were worried about getting
41 infected themselves or their family members, and had good practices against COVID-19.

Introduction

46

COVID-19 is the largest unprecedented viral pandemic of the 21st century. COVID-19

47

virus (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered after it caused a cluster of fatal cases of pneumonia in

48

Wuhan, China. The virus has swiftly spread worldwide [1-3]. This pandemic has major impact on

49

global health and economy. Currently there are around 90 million infected persons worldwide, and

50

two million deaths [4-5]. We have to adopt clear effective public health measures so as to mitigate

51

this crisis [6], till we find a proper vaccination [7]. This can not be achieved without evaluating

52

knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards preventing this disease. This is even more

53

important for role models in the community (like leaders, doctors and medical students) [8]. A

54

study conducted among health care workers in China, during the early stages of the outbreak has

55

shown that around 90% had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 who followed proper preventative

56

practices. 85% were afraid of getting infected [9]. We thought that it was essential to evaluate the

57

KAP of COVID-19 among medical and health sciences students in the United Arab Emirates

58

(UAE) so to mitigate the effects of this pandemic on them. We aimed to evaluate the knowledge

59

of COVID-19, awareness of preventive behaviors, practice, and risk perception among medical

60

students and allied health sciences in the UAE.

Ethical approval was obtained from the UAEU Social Research Committee [UAEU

65

ERS_2020_6119]. Participants’ data were anonymized at the point of registration. No personal

66

identifiable data were collected.

Study Design

68

This is a cross-sectional study which was conducted among medical and health sciences

69

students in the UAE between 2nd June and 19th August 2020. The survey was developed online

70

using Survey Monkey. The link was distributed via UAE University to all students and via

71

WhatsApp© groups.

72
73

Sample size

74

The estimated population of UAE is 9,948,495 [10]. Using Raosoft sample size calculator,

75

having a confidence interval of 95%, a marginal error of 5%, and a response distribution of 50%,

76

the calculated sample size was 385 participants [11]. Accordingly, we aimed to collect 800

77

participants to assure reaching our objectives.

78
79

The online questionnaire was aimed to reach the target population. We used the snowball

80

sampling technique. The study invitation and survey link were directly sent to the medical and

81

health sciences colleges and universities in the UAE through the e-mail and circulated on multiple

82

social media outlets. The participants were encouraged to forward the link to their fellow medical

83

and health sciences students and post it on their social media platforms to maximize enrolment of

84

potential participants. The study invitation included an introduction, a brief description of the study

85

and the link to the questionnaire. The survey was piloted on 10 students and validated by

86

epidemiologists before sharing it with the study population.

88

Questionnaire design

89

The questionnaire was designed and referenced from previous similar studies and modified

90

to our study population [12,13]. The questionnaire started with a consent page which provided a

91

brief description of the study, the voluntary nature of participation and declaration of anonymity.

92

Online informed consent was obtained prior proceeding to the questionnaire response. The self-

93

administered questionnaire was conducted in English and comprised of two parts: socio-

94

demographics characteristics and KAP towards COVID-19. The demographic variables included

95

age, gender, nationality, place of residence, if they are currently studying medicine or health

96

sciences, their year of study and specialty, if they suffer from chronic diseases or live with someone

97

who has a chronic disease, if they tested positive for COVID-19, their source of COVID-19

98

information, and if they attended any COVID-19 educational courses. The KAP part consisted of

99

3 sections and a total of 34 questions. These included

100
101

Knowledge

102

This section included 12 questions which assessed the participants’ knowledge about

103

COVID-19, and the questions were answered on a multiple choice and true/false basis. The items

104

included etiology of the disease, transmission of the virus, symptoms, incubation period,

105

diagnostic tests, treatment options, and prevention. In the knowledge section, respondents were

106

given options to answer as true, false, or don’t know.

107
108

Attitude

109

This section included 6 questions which assessed the participants’ attitudes towards the

110

COVID-19 pandemic using a Likert scale. This was coded as follows: strongly disagree=1,

111

disagree=2, undecided=3, agree=4, strongly agree=5. This included fear of getting infected, stigma

112

around infected individuals, government measures, and their confidence towards the measures.

113
114

Practice

115

This section included 16 questions which assessed the participants’ practices towards

116

COVID-19 using multiple-choice questions, yes/no questions, and a Likert scale. The items were

117

related to practices and compliance to preventative measures and precautions implemented by the

118

government such as social distancing, wearing face masks and hand washing.

119
120

Statistical Analysis

121

Simple summary descriptive statistics were used. Continuous were presented as mean (SD)

122

while categorical data were presented as number (%). Percentages were calculated from actual

123

available responses. We used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS version 26,

124

Chicago, Il) for statistical analysis.

125
126

Results

127

A total of 712 responses to the questionnaire were collected. Table 1 shows the detailed

128

demography of the participants. 90% (n=695) of respondents were under-graduates, while 10 %

129

(n=81) were post-graduate. The majority of respondents (87%, n=647) stated that they obtained

130

COVID-19 information from multiple sources. Social Media was the main source for COVID-19

131

information (7%, n=52) of the respondents while the rest (6%, n=48) relied on medical platforms,

132

healthcare professionals, government media briefings, and university newsletters. 406 respondents

133

(57%) attended webinars to learn more about COVID-19.

current measures taken by the UAE government are effective in stopping the spread of the infection and 89% (n=614) were confident

152

that the UAE will be able to stop the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, 60% (n=288) thought that more measures could be implemented

153

such as aggressive screening, full lockdown, further education to the public, monitoring the media, and fighting rumors. Some went

Discussion

165

Our study has shown that the majority of medical and allied health students at UAE were

166

well knowledgeable about COVID 19, worried about getting infected or having a member of their

167

family infected, and had proper practices and precautionary measures for preventing COVID-19.

168
169

The high knowledge on COVID-19 of the medical and allied health students in the UAE is

170

similar to those reported from Pakistan [14]. This may be attributed to the use of multiple reliable

171

medical platforms, healthcare professionals, government media briefings, and university

172

newsletters. These resources may have enforced proper knowledge. Furthermore, it may be related

173

to the training they received as volunteers in the healthcare system [15]. The majority of the

174

respondents were aware of COVID 19 symptoms, the incubation period, diagnostic testing,

175

management, and the preventative measures. However, only 24% in our study correctly recognized

176

COVID-19 route of transmission compared with other studies in which undergraduate students were

177

quite knowledgeable about the route of transmission [14, 16]. COVID-19 is transmitted by

178

respiratory droplets; however, airborne transmission may be possible in case of a medical procedure

179

that generates aerosols [17]. This was unexpected, given the fact that majority of our respondents

180

depended on reliable medical resources for their information.

181
182

Furthermore, our study has shown that participants had both negative and positive feelings

183

regarding the pandemic. Majority was worried that they or a member of their family may get

184

infected. It is important to note that this study was conducted during the period of the rapid increase

185

of COVID-19 cases in the UAE. 67% of the participants believed that infection with the virus is

186

associated with stigma. This may lead to high-risk behaviors that increase infection such as

187

gatherings, poor hand hygiene, poor social distancing and not following the government

188

guidelines. Interestingly, most of the participants were confident that the UAE will be able to stop

189

the spread of the virus. They also believed that the current measures taken by the UAE government

190

are effective in stopping the spread of the infection. This positive attitude can be explained by the

191

drastic measures taken by the UAE government to contain the spread of the virus. These measures

192

included the introduction of teleworking, distance learning, lockdowns, country-level coordination,

193

risk communication, community engagement, surveillance, rapid response teams, case investigation,

194

infection prevention and control, and operational support and logistics [18].

195
196

Majority of participants had proper practices and precautionary measures against COVID-

197

19. 60% did not visit shopping malls, family gatherings, coffee shops, industrial areas and hospitals;

198

and the majority reported good preventative practices including hand washing, wearing face masks,

199

and abiding by curfew timings. These findings could be attributed to the strict lockdown when the

200

survey was launched, access to trusted medical resources, and training in medical fields. These

201

results are similar to those reported on undergraduate students in China, medical students in Pakistan,

202

and clinical year medical students in Iran [13-16].

203
204

Limitations

205

We have to acknowledge that out study has certain limitations. First, this study was

206

conducted using an online survey; consequently, the results of the questionnaire all depended on the

exaggerated as a result of social desirability bias. Second, the respondents were predominantly

209

females and medical students. This may be a selection bias with its effect on the results. Finally, this

210

study was conducted in the early stages of the pandemic when the UAE was under lockdown and

211

continued for a while after the restrictions were lifted. Since then, more information about the

212

pandemic has been published and likewise public health measures in the UAE have changed. Thus,

213

the results of the study may not represent the current COVID-19 KAP of the medical and health

214

sciences students.

Conclusions

217

Medical and health sciences students in the UAE showed high levels of knowledge and

218

awareness about COVID-19. Although they were confident in the public health measures taken to

219

mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, they were worried about getting infected themselves or their

220

family members, and had good practices against COVID-19.
