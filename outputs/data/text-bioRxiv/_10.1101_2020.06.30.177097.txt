Abstract
The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
and its rapid international spread pose a global health emergency. The trimeric spike (S)
glycoprotein interacts with its receptor human ACE2 to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here
we present cryo-EM structures of an uncharacterized tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer and
the ACE2-bound-S-trimer at 2.7-Å and 3.8-Å-resolution, respectively. The tightly closed Strimer with inactivated fusion peptide may represent the ground prefusion state. ACE2 binding
to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD) within S-trimer triggers continuous swing-motions
of ACE2-RBD, resulting in conformational dynamics of S1 subunits. Noteworthy, SARSCoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer in
terms of receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone
open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the
RBD T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2, and provided structural basis of the spike D614G-mutation
induced enhanced infectivity. Our findings offer a thorough picture on the mechanism of
ACE2-induced conformational transitions of S-trimer from ground prefusion state towards
postfusion state, thereby providing important information for development of vaccines and
therapeutics aimed to block receptor binding.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a family of large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause
upper respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases in humans and other
animals (Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2019). In the past few decades, new evolved
coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health, including the outbreaks of the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003 and the Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 which had caused thousands of
infection, and the mortality rate of them was about 10% and 34.4%, respectively (Rabaan et
al., 2020). The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel
coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On June
29, 2020, there had been 9,962,193 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections globally,
leading to 498,723 deaths. To date, there is no approved therapeutics or vaccines against
SARS-CoV-2 and other human-infecting coronaviruses.
As in other coronaviruses, the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is a membranefusion machine that mediates receptor recognition and viral entry into cells and is the primary
target of the humoral immune response during infection (Rabaan et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020).
The S protein is a homotrimeric class I fusion protein that forms large protrusions from the
virus surface and undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane
with the host-cell membrane once binds to a host-cell receptor (Bosch et al., 2003; Li, 2016).
The S protein ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion
subunit S2 (Tang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Two major domains in
coronavirus S1 have been identified, including an N-terminal domain (NTD), and a C-terminal
domain (CTD) also called receptor binding domain (RBD). Following the RBD, S1 also
contains two sub-domains (SD1 and SD2) (Wrapp et al., 2020). The S2 contains a variety of
motifs, starting with the fusion peptide (FP). The FP describes a short segment, conserved
across the viral family and composed of mostly hydrophobic residues, which inserts in the hostcell membrane to trigger the fusion event (Epand, 2003; Tang et al., 2020). Recent cryoelectron
microscopy (cryo-EM) studies on the stabilized ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein
revealed a closed state of S trimer with three RBD domains in “down” conformation (Walls et
al., 2020), as well as an open state with one RBD in the “up” conformation, corresponding to
the receptor-accessible state (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Unlike in MERS-CoV S
protein (Pallesen et al., 2017), the two or three RBD “up” conformation has not been detected
for SARS-CoV-2 S trimer.

SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S share 76% amino acid sequence identity, yet, they bind
the same host-cell receptor—human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et
al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). It is usually considered that the transition
process towards the postfusion conformation is triggered when the S1 subunit binds to a hostcell receptor; receptor binding destabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1
subunit and transition of the S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation (Walls et al.,
2017b). The available crystal structures of the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 interacting with
the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2, together with the cryo-EM structure of RBD
domain associated with the full length ACE2 provided important information on the RBDACE2 interaction interface, revealing that the residues S438 to Q506, known as the receptorbinding motif (RBM), within RBD directly interact with ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020; Yan et al., 2020). However, a complete picture of ACE2 associating with the SARSCoV-2 trimeric S protein is still missing, and it remains elusive on how ACE2 binding induces
SARS-CoV-2 S trimer conformational destabilization to facilitate transitions towards the
postfusion state.
Here, we present cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in a tightly closed state,
and the S trimer in complex with the receptor ACE2 (termed SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2) at 2.7 Å
and 3.8 Å resolution, respectively, in addition to a S trimer structure in the unliganded open
state. The tightly closed ground prefusion state with originally dominant population may
indicate a conformational masking mechanism of immune evasion for SARS-CoV-2 spike. Our
data suggested there is one RBD in the “up” conformation and is trapped with ACE2 in the SACE2 complex; ACE2 can greatly shift the conformational landscape of S trimer, and trigger
continuous swing motions of ACE2-RBD in the context of the S trimer resulting in
conformational dynamics in S1 subunits. We demonstrated the RBM T470-T478 loop and
residue Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2.
Our findings provide a blueprint for the understanding of the mechanisms of ACE2-induced
conformational dynamics and resulted conformational transitions of the S trimer towards
postfusion state, which may benefit anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug and vaccine development.

et al., 2018; Miroshnikov et al., 1998; Pallesen et al., 2017; Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al.,
2017a; Walls et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2019; Wrapp et al., 2020), and was
subjected to cryo-EM single-particle analysis (Fig. S2A-B). Our initial reconstruction
suggested a preferred orientation problem associated with the S trimer (highly preferred “side”
orientation but lacking tilted top views, Fig. S2C), which is also the case for the influenza
hemagglutinin (HA) trimer (but highly preferred “top” orientation) (Tan et al., 2017). To
overcome this problem, we adopted the recently developed tilt stage strategy in data collection
with additional data collected at 30º and 40º tilt angles (Tan et al., 2017). This allowed us to
obtain a cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in a closed state at 2.7 Å resolution (with
imposed C3 symmetry, termed S-closed) (Figs. 1A, and S2-S3, Movie 1). Excitingly, after
overcoming the preferred orientation problem, our S-closed map very well resolved the
peripheral edge of the NTD domain (Fig. 1A-C), which was less well resolved in the recent
reports (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). This enabled us to build a more complete model
of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer containing the previously missing loop regions (including Q14P26, K77-F79, Y144-N164, Q173-N185, R246-S247, and S255-A262, Fig.1B, S2G);
additionally, the S469-C488 loop in the RBM subdomain was also captured in our structure
(Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, compared with the recent closed state SARS-CoV-2 S trimer structure
(Walls et al., 2020), our map represents an uncharacterized tightly closed conformation. For
instance, the upper portion of S1 subunit especially NTD and RBD depicts an anti-clockwise
rotation of 9.4º and 3.7º, respectively (Fig. 1E). Accompanying this rotation, there is a slight
inward tilt leading the peripheral edge of NTD exhibiting a 12.4 Å inward movement for Ca
of T124 (Fig. S2G). These motions can be propagated to the central helix (CH) of S2 subunit,
generating a clockwise rotation of 1.1º (Fig. 1E). This central portion clockwise rotation
associating with the outer potion opposite anti-clockwise rotation in reality twists the complex
in a more compact conformation. Indeed, the average interaction interface between protomers
increased from ~4,671.7 Å2 in their structure to 6,837.2 Å2 in our structure (Fig. 1F). Taken
together, our map represents a tightly closed state of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, not captured
before. Furthermore, when comparing our SARS-CoV-2 S-closed structure with the closed
state SARS-CoV S trimer cryo-EM structure (Gui et al., 2017), there is an anti-clockwise
rotation of 10.5º and 8.7º in NTD and RBD, respectively, and a clockwise rotation of 4.3º in
CH region from their structure to our S-closed structure, associating with a RBD inward shift
towards the central axis (RMSD of 6.7 Å, Fig. S2H). Collectively, our S-closed structure

appears more compact than that of SARS-CoV S trimer (6,837.2 Å2 vs. 4,874.0 Å2 in
interaction interface, Fig. 1F). Altogether, our study revealed a tightly closed conformation of
SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, not observed in the homologous SARS-CoV S neither, extending the
detected conformational space of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
The tightly closed state with stably packed fusion peptide may represent the ground
prefusion state of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer
The hydrophobic fusion peptide, immediately after the S2’ cleavage site and essential for
host-cell membrane fusion, is highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERSCoV S proteins (Tang et al., 2020). Still, the majority of FP is missing in the available SARSCoV-2 S trimer structures. Thus, how it folds and where it locates within S trimer of the virus
and how it can be activated remain unclear. Here, our S-closed map enabled us to capture the
entire FP of SARS-CoV-2 including the previously undetected L828-Q853 fragment, which
locates on the flank surface of S trimer, surrounded by HR1 of S2 subunit from the same
protomer, and SD1/SD2 of S1 subunit from the clockwise neighboring protomer (Fig. 1G-H).
The FP fragment is well ordered, forming two small helixes (Y837-G842, L849-F855) and
connecting loops (Fig. 1G-H). This observation further substantiates the notion that our Sclosed structure with inactivated FP most likely represents the ground prefusion state.
Further interaction analysis revealed that SD2 and HR1 can form hydrogen bonds/salt
bridges with the FP fragment, and SD2 plays a key role in this interaction involving in 6
predicted hydrogen bonds/salt bridges (Table S2). Noteworthy, among the 6 SD2-FP
interactions, D614 from SD2 contributes to the formation of 4 hydrogen bonds/salt bridges,
majorly through its sidechain atoms, with K835, Y837 and K854 of FP, suggesting D614 may
be essential in the interaction with and stabilization of FP (Fig. 1I and Table S2). This could
be related to the recent reports suggesting that the D614G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S
enhanced viral infectivity (more in discussion) (Korber et al., 2020). Interestingly, it appears
that before being activated, FP could serve as a linkage that wraps around the neighboring
protomers in their S1/S2 interface and simultaneously connects S1 with S2, this way to
coordinately lock the S trimer in the tightly closed ground prefusion state (Fig. 1G-H).
Moreover, in this dataset the dominant population of the particles (~94%) is in the tightly
closed state; although performed multiple rounds of 3D classification, eventually we found
only a minor population (6%) of the particles is in the open state (Fig. S3). Our observations
indicate that the open state SARS-CoV-2 S might be intrinsically dynamic and only exist

transiently to expose the RBD domain. Interestingly, the dominant population of the SARSCoV-2 S trimer is in the ground prefusion state with inactivated FP and all the RBD domains
buried, which may result in “conformational masking” preventing antibody binding and
neutralization, similar to that described for HIV-1 envelope (Env) (Kwong et al., 2002; Munro
et al., 2014). The population distribution of closed and open state of SARS-CoV-2 S varies
among different studies (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020), which is reminiscent of
observations made with SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S trimers. This observed variation
could be potentially due to subtle difference in chemical condition used by different research
groups (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018;
Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017).
A complete architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with ACE2
To gain a thorough picture on how the receptor ACE2 binding induces conformational
dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and triggers transition towards the postfusion state, we
determine the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with human ACE2 PD
domain to 3.8 Å resolution (termed SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2, Figs. 2A, S4A-E, and S5). Further
focused-refinements improved the resolution of the S trimer portion of the map to 3.3 Å, and
the connectivity in the ACE2-RBD portion of the map, respectively (Fig. S4E, S5). We then
built a pseudo atomic model of the complex with combined map information (Fig. 2B). To the
best of our knowledge, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 complex has not been reported
before. In this dataset we additionally captured an unliganded S trimer in the open state with
one RBD up (resolved to 6.0 Å resolution, termed S-open), but did not detect the closed state
(Fig. S4D-F and S5). We should mention that our bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay revealed
a relatively rapid disassociation kinetics between ACE2 and the S trimer (koff = 4.56x10-3 s-1,
Fig. S1E). We thus determined the complex structure in the presence of trace amount of cross
linker glutaraldehyde (Methods). Additionally, we also determined the S-ACE2 complex
structure without cross linker at 5.3 Å resolution, and the two maps are in comparable
conformation, suggesting that addition of cross linker did not change the conformation of the
complex (Fig. S4G). We then used the S-ACE2 map at 3.8 Å resolution for detailed structural
analysis.
To inspect the conformational changes from the closed state to the unliganded open state,
we first overlaid our S-open with our S-closed structures together. In the S-open structure, the
only up RBD domain from protomer 1 (termed RBD-1) shows a 71.0º upwards/outwards

rotation, resulting in an exposed RBM region accessible for ACE2 binding (Fig. 2C). This
RBD-1 rotation can be propagated to the underneath SD1, inducing a downwards movement
of SD1 (Fig. 2C). We also noticed a considerable clockwise rotation of 9.4º, 11.2º, and 12.9º
in NTD for protomer 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and anti-clockwise rotations in the CH of
corresponding S2 subunit, greatly untwisting the S trimer from the tightly closed state (Fig.
2D). Associated with this S1 untwisting, there is a downwards/outwards movement of NTDs
in the scale of ~10 Å (Fig. 1D, right panel). These combined untwisting motion could release
the original protomer interaction strength, beneficial for the transient raising up of the RBD.
Moreover, our local resolution analysis on the S-open map also suggested that other than RBD1, the consecutive RBD-2 also exhibits considerable dynamics (Fig. S4D).
Our SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 structure revealed that the S trimer binds with one ACE2
through the only up RBD domain, while the other two RBDs remain in the down conformation
(Fig. 2A-B), suggesting ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 strictly requires the up conformation
of RBD. Unlike the observations made with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S trimers, we did not
detect S trimer with two RBD domains up with bound ACE2 (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018;
Pallesen et al., 2017). Though our S-ACE2 and S-open structures generally resemble each other
especially in the S2 region, there are noticeable differences in the S1 region. Specifically, after
ACE2 binding, the up RBD-1 from the S-open state can be pushed tilting downwards slightly,
with the angle to the horizontal plane of S trimer reduced from 73.2º to 68.6º in ACE2 bound
state (Fig. 2E). This ACE2 binding induced motion of RBD-1 could be propagated to the
neighboring RBD-2 and the consecutive RBD-3 (RMSD: 1.95 Å, Fig. 2F), collectively
disturbing the allosteric network of the fusion machinery. Indeed, the neighboring protomer
interaction interface was reduced from the original ~6837.2 Å2 in the S-closed state to
4898.4~5791.2 Å2 in the ACE2 bound state (Fig. 2G). Altogether, these S1 subunits untwisting
and RBD-1 tilting motions could destabilize the prefusion state of S trimer, prepared for the
subsequent conformational transitions towards the postfusion state.
Interestingly, our S-ACE2 structure showed that the core region of the up RBD-1 and the
RBM T470-F490 loop of the neighboring RBD-2 could form aromatic interactions with the
involvement of Y369/F374 from RBD-1 and F486/Y489 from RBD-2 (Fig. 2H), potentially
enhancing interactions between neighboring S1 subunits, thus beneficial for subsequent
simultaneous release of S1 subunits. This interaction was not detected in the counterpart of the
homologous SARS-CoV S-ACE2 structure, likely due to longer distance between the adjacent
“up” and “down” RBDs in that structure (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018).

Noteworthy, the originally stably packed FP from protomer 3 surrounded by SD1/SD2 of
the neighboring protomer 1 in the S-closed structure is now mostly missing in the S-ACE2
structure, which is also the case in the S-open structure. This is mostly caused by the S trimer
untwisting-motion induced downwards shift of SD1 (Fig. 2C, I). Indeed, the b34/b37 strands
within SD1 shift downwards for up to 5.4 Å; consequently, the C590 and T588 from b37 and
the connecting loop could clash with the Y837 and L841 of the originally packed a8 helix of
FP (Fig. 2I), potentially resulting in destabilization and activation of the FP motif from
protomer 3. Since the untwisting/downwards-shift motions of S1 subunits are allosterically
coordinated within the S trimer in its opening process, the density corresponding to FPs in
protomer 1 and 2 are also missing, indicating a coordinated activation mechanism of FP, which
may be one of the key elements prepared for the subsequent fusion of S trimer.
Strikingly, our data further suggested that the presence of ACE2 could greatly shift the
population landscape of S trimer, i.e. from the original 94% of closed prefusion state and 6 %
fusion-prone open state in the absence of ACE2, to 26.2% unliganded open state and 73.8%
ACE2 bound open state in the ACE2 present sample (Fig. 2J). Therefore, in the presence of
ACE2, the open state S trimer (despite this state only exits transiently with minor population
in the absence of ACE2) interacts with ACE2, and such interaction could break the balance
between particle populations and greatly shift the S trimer conformational landscape towards
the open state, favorable for the receptor binding and transitions towards postfusion state.
The T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 within RBM play vital roles in the engagement of
SARS-CoV-2 spike with host-cell receptor ACE2
According to our SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 cryo-EM structure, the overall ACE2-RBD
interaction interface is comparable to that of the crystal structures of the RBD domain of SARSCoV-2 S interacting with the ACE2 PD domain (Fig. 3A) (Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020),
i.e. our structure revealed 19 residues of RBD are in contact with 17 residues of ACE2 with a
distance cut-off of 4 Å (Table S3). Sequence alignment demonstrated that the RBM T470-F490
loop is the most diversified region between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S proteins (Fig. S6).
In line with this, structural comparison revealed that the conformation of the RBM T470-F490
loop in our SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 structure is very distinct from that in the SARS-CoV RBDACE2 crystal structure (Fig. 3B) (Li et al., 2005). Noteworthy, the RBM T470-F490 loop can
originally be resolved in our S-closed structure, but is mostly missing in our S-open structure,
indicating the T470-F490 loop may be activated in the open state. In our S-ACE2 structure, a

portion of this loop forms contact with the N-terminal helix of ACE2 (Fig. 3A), for instance,
A475 within this loop could interact with S19/T27 of ACE2 (Table S3), suggesting that the
RBM T470-F490 loop may play an important role in receptor recognition. Moreover, the SACE2 structure indicated that the Q498-Y505 region located in the other edge of RBM could
also form close contact with ACE2, i.e. Y505 could form hydrogen bonds/contacts with
A386/R393/K353/G354 from ACE2.
To further define the subdomains/residues critical for RBD binding to ACE2, we designed
and produced three SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutant proteins, each of which had a single subdomain
substituted with the counterpart of SARS-CoV. These RBD mutants were termed RBD-(Core),
RBD-(RBM-R2) and RBD-(RBM-R3), which harbored R319 to N437 of the core region, L452
to K462, and T470 to T478 of the RBM from SARS-CoV, respectively (Figs. 3C and S6).
Results from ACE2-binding enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the
binding activity of the three RBD mutants towards anti-RBD polyclonal antisera and the crossreactive monoclonal antibody 1A10 was comparable to that of the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 RBD
protein (Fig. 3C), indicating that the mutations did not significantly affect the overall
conformation of the RBDs. The mutants RBD-(Core) and RBD-(RBM-R2) bound ACE2 as
efficiently as the wildtype RBD; in contrast, RBD-(RBM-R3) completely lost ACE2-binding
(Fig. 3C). These results pinpoint the RBM-R3 region (residues 470-TEIYQAGST-478) as the
critical viral determinant for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by the ACE2 receptor.
Additionally, we constructed three single-point mutants of SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, RBD
(Q498A), RBD (V503A), and RBD (Y505A). Our ELISA ACE2-binding assay showed that
the mutation Y505A was sufficient to completely abolish the binding of ACE2, while the other
two mutations did not show such effect (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that the residue Y505 of
SARS-CoV-2 RBD is a key amino acid required for ACE2 receptor binding.
ACE2 binding induces continuous swing motions of ACE2-RBD in the context of SARSCoV-2 S trimer
Our SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 map showed well defined density for the S trimer region, but
relatively lower local resolution in the associated ACE2-RBD region (Fig. S4C), suggesting
considerable conformational heterogeneity of ACE2-RBD as well as relative dynamics
between ACE2-RBD and the remaining part of S trimer with respect to each other. This is in
line with the report showing that in SARS-CoV S trimer, the associated ACE2-RBD is
relatively dynamic, showing three major conformational states with the angle of ACE2-RBD

to the surface of S trimer at ~51º, 73º, and 111º, respectively (Song et al., 2018). To better
delineate the conformational space of the ACE2 engaged SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, we performed
multi-body refinement in Relion 3.1 (Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2017).
Principal component analysis of the movement revealed that approximately 68% of the
movement of the complex is described by the first three eigenvectors representing swing
motions in distinct directions relative to the S trimer (Fig. 4A). Eigenvector 1 describes a swing
motion of ACE2-RBD towards RBD-2 direction with the angular range of 12.2º, eigenvector
2 corresponds to the swing motion of ACE2-RBD towards the original location of RBD-1 with
the angular range of 11.9º, and eigenvector 3 describes the swing motion of ACE2-RBD along
the NTD-1 to NTD-3 direction with the angular range of 9.8º (Fig. 4B). Histograms of the
amplitudes along the three eigenvectors are unimodal, indicative of continuous motions (Fig.
4C). As the dynamic motions in the complex are formed by linear combination of all
eigenvectors, these data suggested that ACE2-RBD processes on top of the S trimer in a noncorrelated manner. Moreover, multi-body analysis on the non-cross-linked SARS-CoV-2 SACE2 data showed similar swing motions (Fig. S4H), indicating the presence of cross linker
did not disturb the mode of ACE2-RBD motions within the S trimer. Additionally, compared
with the homologous SARS-CoV S-ACE2 complex, which shows discrete movements of
ACE2-RBD in one direction (similar to our eigenvector 2 direction) (Song et al., 2018), ACE2
binding to SARS-CoV-2 S induces more complex combined continuous swing motions of
ACE2-RBD within the complex.
Putting together, our observations suggest that ACE2 receptor binding to SARS-CoV-2 S
triggers considerable conformational dynamics in S1 subunits that could destabilize the
prefusion S trimer. Indeed, the B-factor distribution of our S-ACE2 complex demonstrated that
ACE2 binding induces strikingly enhanced dynamics in the S1 region including RBD and NTD
domains (Fig. 4D), facilitating the release of the associated ACE2-S1 component and
transitions of the S2 subunit towards a stable postfusion conformation. Indeed, we found a
notable drop in the interaction surface between S1 and S2 subunits from the S-closed state
(8982.3 Å2) to the S-ACE2 state (6521.7 Å2).
The SARS-CoV-2 S glycan shields
It has been suggested that the large number of N-linked glycans covering the surface of
the spike protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV could pose challenge to antigen recognition,
thus may help the virus evade immune surveillance (Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017).

Similar to SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S also comprises 22 N-linked glycosylation, with 13
glycans in the S1 subunit and the other 9 in the S2 subunit (Fig. 5A) (Walls et al., 2020;
Watanabe et al., 2020). In our S-closed structure, we resolved the density for 18 N-linked
glycans per protomer (Fig. 5A-B and S2I), including two undetected glycans at site N17 and
N149 located in the NTD (Fig. 5B), while the three glycans located in the flexible C-terminal
region are missing as in other studies (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Similar to MERSCoV and SARS-CoV S trimers (Walls et al., 2017b; Walls et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015),
SARS-CoV-2 S trimer also forms a glycan hole at proximity of the S1/S2 cleavage site and the
fusion peptide (near the S2’ cleavage site, Fig. 5B). Although there is an extra glycan at N657
site near the S1/S2 cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 S, the hole region is still more sparsely
glycosylated than the rest of the protomer. This glycan hole might be important for permitting
the access of activating host proteases and for allowing membrane fusion to take place without
obstruction (Walls et al., 2017b; Walls et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015). Moreover, after ACE2
binding, our S-ACE2 structure revealed that the density corresponding to glycan at N165 site
is weaker in protomer 1, while the other resolved glycans in the S-closed state can also be
visualized in the S-ACE2 structure (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has become pandemic. Several
structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain bound to ACE2 have been reported (Lan et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). However, the complete architecture of SARS-CoV2 trimeric S in complex with ACE2 remains unavailable, leading to an incomplete
understanding of the nature of this interaction and of the resulted conformational transitions of
the S trimer towards postfusion and virus entry. In the present study, we determined an
uncharacterized tightly closed state of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer revealing the stably packed
fusion peptide, most likely representing a previously undetected ground prefusion state of S
trimer. The tightly closed S trimer with originally dominant population may indicate a
conformational masking mechanism of immune evasion for SARS-CoV-2 spike. Importantly,
we captured the complete architecture of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with ACE2. We
found the presence of ACE2 could dramatically shift the conformational landscape of the S
trimer, and after engagement the continuous swing motions of ACE2-RBD in the context of
the S trimer could generate considerable conformational dynamics in S1 subunits resulting in
a significant decrease in S1/S2 interface area. Furthermore, our structural data combined with
biochemical analysis revealed that the RBM T470-T478 loop and residue Y505 play vital roles

in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 receptor. Our findings depict a new role of FP
in stabilizing S trimer and the mechanism of FP activation, expand the detected conformational
space of the S trimer, and provide structural basis on the SARS-CoV-2 spike D614G mutation
induced enhanced infectivity.
Based on the data, we put forward a mechanism of ACE2 binding-induced conformational
transitions of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer from the tightly closed ground prefusion state
transforming towards the postfusion state (Fig. 6). In the receptor-free SARS-CoV-2 S, the
majority of the S trimers is in the tightly closed ground prefusion state with inactivated FP, and
only a minor population of the particles is in the transient open state with one RBD up
representing the fusion-prone state, forming a dynamic balance between the two states (step 1).
However, the presence of ACE2 and subsequent trapping of the RBD (discussed later) could
overcome the energy barrier, break the balance and shift the conformational landscape towards
the open state with an untwisting/downwards-shift motion of the S1 subunits, leading to
unpacked/activated FPs, weakened interactions among the protomers, and an up RBD. In step
2, once the receptor ACE2 grasp the up RBD, the RBD will be trapped in the up conformation,
and the associated ACE2-RBD together shows combined continuous swing motions on the
topmost surface of the S trimer. These motions and dynamics could disturb the allosteric
network and release the constrains imposed on the fusion machinery, beneficial for the
releasing of the ACE2-S1 component, thereby allowing the S trimers to refold and fuse the
viral and host membranes (step 3).
The dominantly populated conformation (94%) for the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 S trimer
is in the tightly closed state (more compact than that of SARS-CoV S trimer) with all the RBD
domains buried, resulting in conformational masking preventing antibody binding and
neutralization at sites of receptor binding. This SARS-CoV-2 conformational masking
mechanism of neutralization escape suggested here could affect all antibodies that bind to the
receptor binding site, similar to that described for HIV-1 Env (Kwong et al., 2002; Munro et
al., 2014). While for MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV S trimer, the closed state is less populated
(5.4% and 27.6%, respectively, indicating the conformational masking mechanism may be less
effective for the two viruses (Gui et al., 2017; Pallesen et al., 2017). Interestingly, our findings
also suggest that unliganded S trimer proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are inherently competent to
transiently display conformation with one RBD up ready for receptor ACE2 binding; ACE2
facilitates the capture of pre-existing S trimer open conformation that are spontaneously

sampled in the unliganded spike, rather than triggering a trimer opening event. Therefore, the
spontaneously sampled S trimer conformations may serve a functional role in infectivity.
Intriguingly, our data also suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer is very sensitive to
ACE2. For instance, the presence of ACE2 triggers an extremely thorough conformational
landscape transitions from dominantly closed state (94%) to all open configurations (including
26.2% free open state and 73.8% ACE2 bound open state). While in the counterpart of SARSCoV, ACE2 induces conformational landscape transitions from 27.6% closed state and 72.4%
open state to 24% closed state and 76% open state (including 26.7% free open state and 49.2%
ACE2 bound open state) (Gui et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018). This demonstrates that the SARSCoV-2 S trimer is much more sensitive to the ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV S in terms of
receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state,
which might have contributed to the observed superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 as
compared to that of SARS-CoV.
Noteworthy, the mutation SARS-CoV-2 spike D614G has gained urgent concern; the
mutated genotype G614 began spreading in early February, and it was detected to reach at a
frequency of ~72% in early June according to GISAID public repository (Daniloski et al., 2020;
Korber et al., 2020). Moreover, it has been reported that the D614G mutation promotes the
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and enhances viral transmissibility in multiple human cell types
(Daniloski et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). However, the structural basis of
D614G enhanced infectivity has not been fully understood yet. Here our S-closed structure in
the ground prefusion state showed that D614 heavily involves in the interaction with FP
through its side chain atoms (Fig. 1I, Table S2). This interaction could contribute greatly to the
linkage between neighboring protomers as well as between S1 and S2 subunits. However, the
mutation of D614 to G without side chain could eliminate most of the hydrogen bonds/salt
bridges the D614 originally forms with FP, hence greatly reduce its interaction with FP
potentially leading to a coordinated unpacking/activation of FPs. Therefore, D614G mutation
could (1) reduce the constrains between neighboring protomers as well as S1/S2 interactions
within S trimer, and (2) lower the energy barrier for the conformational transformation from
closed prefusion state to fusion-prone open state, leading to even more sensitive SARS-CoV2 S trimer to ACE2 binding. Collectively, these factors may contribute to the enhanced
infectivity and viral transmissibility of the G614 strain.
In summary, our data revealed the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 S trimer to be intrinsically
transforming between two distinct pre-fusion conformations, whose relative occupancies could

be dramatically remodeled by receptor ACE2. These findings support a dynamics-based
mechanism of immune evasion and ligand recognition (Munro et al., 2014). Thus, our study
delineates the properties of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins that simultaneously allow
the retention of function and the evasion of the humoral immune response. We also delineated
that the substantial conformational dynamics of S1 subunits induced by ACE2 binding could
trigger the transition of the spike protein towards postfusion state prepared for viral entry and
infection. Collectively, our findings suggest that stabilization of the tightly closed ground
prefusion state of S trimer with inactivated FPs might be a general and effective means of
inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry, and an understanding of the properties of the SARS-CoV-2 S
trimer that permit neutralization resistance will guide attempts to create vaccines as well as
therapeutics that target receptor binding.

Methods
Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and human ACE2
To express SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein ectodomain, the mammalian codon-optimized
gene coding SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, GenBank ID: MN908947.3) S glycoprotein
ectodomain (residues M1-Q1208) with proline substitutions at K986 and V987, a “GSAS”
substitution at the furin cleavage site (R682–R685) was cloned into vector pcDNA 3.1+. A Cterminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, a TEV protease cleavage site, a FLAG tag and a His
tag were cloned downstream of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein ectodomain (Fig. S1A). A
gene encoding human ACE2 PD domain (Q18-D615) with an N-terminal IL10 signal peptide
and a C-terminal His tag was cloned into vector pcDNA 3.4. The expression vectors were
transiently transfected into HEK293F cells using polyethylenimine. Three days after
transfection, the supernatants were harvested. To purify the His-tagged S and ACE2 proteins,
the clarified supernatants were added with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM
imidazole, 4 mM MgCl2, and incubated with Ni-NTA resin at 4°C for 1 hour. The Ni-NTA
resin was recovered and washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM
imidazole. The protein was eluted by 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 250 mM
imidazole.
Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay
Before BLI experiments, SARS-CoV-2 S trimer protein was biotinylated using the EZLink™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin kit (Thermo Fisher) and then purified using Zeba™ spin
desalting column (Thermo Fisher), according to manufacturer's protocols. To determine
binding affinity of ACE2, BLI assay was carried out using an Octet Red 96 instrument (Pall
FortéBio, USA). Briefly, biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S trimer protein was loaded onto
streptavidin (SA) biosensors (Pall FortéBio). S-trimer-bound biosensors were dipped into wells
containing varying concentrations of ACE2 protein and the interactions were monitored over
a 500-sec association period. Finally, the sensors were switched to dissociation buffer (0.01 M
PBS supplemented with 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for a 500-sec
dissociation phase. Data was analyzed using Octet data analysis software version 11.0 (Pall
FortéBio).

The purified SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein ectodomain and human ACE2 PD domain were
mixed at a molar ratio of 1:3 and were incubated on ice for 2 hours. The mixture was purified
by filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare)
pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 4% glycerol. For cross linking
complex, the buffer of purified SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein ectodomain and human ACE2
PD domain were exchanged to 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl; then SARS-CoV-2 S and
human ACE2 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:3. After incubation on ice for 2 hours, the
complex was cross linked by 0.1% glutaraldehyde, which is commonly used in cryo-EM
studies of fragile macromolecular complexes (Kastner et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2018). The
glutaraldehyde was neutralized by adding 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 after incubated on ice for 1
hour. The mixture was run over a Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) in
20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 4% glycerol. The complex peak fractions were
concentrated and assessed by SDS-PAGE and negative-staining electron microscopy.
Negative-stain sample preparation, data collection and initial model building
For the NS sample, a volume of 5 µL of SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 sample was placed on a
plasma cleaned copper grid for one minute. Excess sample on the grid was blotted off using
filter paper, and a volume of 5 µl of 0.75% UF (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to wash the grid.
After blotting, another volume of 5 µL of 0.75% UF was placed on the grid again for one
minute to stain. Grids were visualized under a Tecnai G2 Spirit 120 kV transmission electron
microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and micrographs were taken using an Eagle camera
with a nominal magnification of 67,000×, yielding a pixel size of 1.74 Å. 41,827 particles were
autopicked in EMAN2 (Bell et al., 2016). After 2D classification, we selected good averages
with 13,047 particles for initial model building, which were performed in RELION 3.0
(Zivanov et al., 2018).
Cryo-EM sample preparation for SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and S-ACE2 complex
To prepare the cryo-EM sample of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, a 2.2-µL aliquot of this sample
was applied to a plasma cleaned holey carbon grid (R2/1, 200 mesh; Quantifoil) or Graphene
Oxide-Lacey Carbon grid (300 mesh, EMR). The grid was blotted with Vitrobot Mark IV
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then plunged into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. To
prepare the cryo-EM sample of S-ACE2 complex with or without cross linking, we used
Graphene Oxide-Lacey Carbon grid (300 mesh, EMR), and adopted the same vitrification
procedure as for the S trimer.

Cryo-EM data collection
Cryo-EM movies of the samples were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV with a nominal
magnification of 22,500x (Table S1). The movies were recorded on a K2 Summit direct
electron detector (Gatan) operated in the super-resolution mode (yielding a pixel size of 1.02
Å after 2 times binning), under low-dose condition in an automatic manner using SerialEM
(Mastronarde, 2005). Each frame was exposed for 0.15 s and the total accumulation time was
6.45s, leading to a total accumulated dose of 50 e-/Å2 on the specimen. To solve the problem
of preferred orientation associated with SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, we additionally collected tilt
datasets with the stage tilt at 30° or 40°, while the other conditions remained the same.
Cryo-EM 3D reconstruction
Single particle analysis was mainly executed in RELION 3.1 (Fernandez-Leiro and
Scheres, 2017). All images were aligned and summed using MotionCor2 software (Zheng et
al., 2017). After CTF parameter determination using CTFFIND4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015),
particle auto-picking, manual particle checking, and reference-free 2D classification, particles
with S trimer features were maintained for further processing.
For receptor-free S trimer sample, 226,082 particles were picked from non-tilt
micrographs, and 118,420 remained after 2D classification (Fig. S3). These particles went
through 3D auto-refine using available SARS-CoV-2 S trimer cryo-EM map (EMDB: 21452)
lowpass filtered to 40 Å resolution as initial model (Walls et al., 2020). These particles were
refined into a closed state map of S trimer with imposed C3 symmetry. We then re-extracted
the particles using the refinement coordinates to re-center it. After CTF refinement and
polishing, these particles were refined with C3 symmetry again. Noteworthy, the Euler angle
distribution of the map suggested the dataset is lacking tilted top views (Fig. S2C left panel).
Indeed, when refine the dataset without imposing 3-fold symmetry, the top view of the map
appeared distorted indicating a preferred orientation problem associated with the sample. To
overcome the preferred orientation problem, we additionally collected tilt data, and boxed out
198,737 particles from 40º tilt micrographs and 16,010 particles from 30º tilt micrographs.
After 2D classification, 184,661 particles remained. We then used goCTF software to
determine the defocus for each of the tilt particle, and these particles were re-extracted with
corrected defocus (Su, 2019). After combining the tilt with non-tilt particles, we refined the
dataset without imposing symmetry, then performed two rounds of 3D and 2D classifications

to further cleanup the dataset, and obtained a dataset of 151,505 particles, of which 62,368
particles were from the tilt data. We then carried out heterogeneous refinement in CryoSparc
(Punjani et al., 2017), and obtained a closed state map from 142,345 particles and an open state
reconstruction with 9,160 particles (Fig S3). After CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, the
closed state map was refined to 2.7 Å resolution with C3 symmetry, while the open state map
was at 12.8 Å resolution and hardly to improve the resolution, indicating an intrinsic dynamic
nature of the open state. The overall resolution was determined based on the gold-standard
criterion using an FSC of 0.143 (Scheres and Chen, 2012).
For the SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 cross-linked dataset, 298,127 particles were picked from
original micrographs, and 138,632 particles remained after 2D classification (Fig. S5). These
particles were refined with an initial model built from our negative staining data. We then reextracted the particles to re-center them. These particles went through a 3D-2D classification
step resulting in a further cleaned up dataset of 77,440 particles. We refined these particles into
a map of ACE2 bound S trimer complex. We then used this map as initial model to refine the
originally picked 298,127 particles for one round to re-extract and re-center the particles. After
2D classification, 207,742 particles remained. After 2 rounds of 3D-2D cleaning step, 136,412
particles were left for further structure determination. After heterogeneous refinement in
CryoSparc, class 1 resembled an ACE2-free open state of S trimer, and classes 2-5 adopted SACE2 engaged conformation. For class 1, after further 2D classification, we refined the 24,502
cleaned up particles into a S-open map at 6.0 Å resolution using non-uniform refinement in
CryoSparc. Among the other four classes with bound ACE2, we sorted out good particles for
classes 2-4 by 2D classification and combined them with class 5 exhibiting good structural
details, resulting in a dataset of 68,987 particles. After refinement, Bayesian Polishing, and
CTF refinement, we reconstructed a 3.8 Å resolution SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 map. The S trimer
portion without the up RBD was rather stable, could be locally refined to 3.3 Å using local
refinement in CryoSparc with non-uniform refinement option chosen. The ACE2 associated
with the up RBD was subtracted and refined in Relion to obtain a more 8.4 Å map with better
connectivity. Multi-body refinement in Relion 3.1 was applied to analyze the motion of the
complex.
For SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 w/o crosslinking dataset, we followed similar classification
and cleaning up strategy and obtained 81,820 particles. Through heterogeneous refinement and
2D classification in CryoSparc, we reconstructed a 5.3 Å resolution SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2
map from 32,866 particles using non-uniform refinement, and an unliganded open state map

of 11.2 Å resolution from 15,149 particles, with the population of 68.4% and 31.6%,
respectively. Multi-body refinement was also applied to analysis the mobility of the complex.
Pseudo atomic model building
To build the pseudo atomic model for our SARS-CoV-2 S-closed structure, we used the
available atomic model of SARS-CoV-2 S (PDB: 6VXX) as initial model (Walls et al., 2020).
We first refined the model against our map using phenix.real_space_refine module in Phenix
(Adams et al., 2010). For the missing loop regions in S1 subunit, we either built the homology
model based on SARS-CoV S structure (PDB: 6CRW) (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018) through
SWISS-MODEL webserver (Waterhouse et al., 2018), or built the loop manually according to
the density in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). For the FP region, we first built the
homology model by Modeller tool within Chimera by using MERS-CoV S structure (PDB:
6NB3) as template (Pettersen et al., 2004; Sali, 1995; Walls et al., 2019), then used Rosetta to
refine this region against the density map (DiMaio et al., 2015). Eventually, we used
phenix.real_space_refine again for the protomer and S-trimer model refinement against the
map.
For the SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 structure, we used the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 crystal
structure (PDB: 6M0J) as initial model for the ACE2 and the associated up RBD portion, and
our S-closed model as initial model for the remaining portion. These models were firstly
refined against the corresponding focused map using Rosetta and Phenix (DiMaio et al., 2015),
then combined together in COOT. We then refined the combined model against our 3.8 Å
resolution SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 map using Rosetta and Phenix. For the S-open structure, we
used the model of SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 as initial model with ACE2 removed, and refined
against the map using Rosetta.
We used Phenix.molprobility to evaluate the models, and calculated B-factors by atom
displacement refinement function in phenix.real_space_refine. We used UCSF Chimera and
ChimeraX for figure generation (Goddard et al., 2018; Pettersen et al., 2004), and also for
rotation, translation, RMSD, and vdw contact measurement. Interaction surface analysis was
conducted by PISA server (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007).
Identification of key amino acids involved in ACE2 recognition with RBD mutants by
ELISA

To uncover the amino acids important for ACE2 receptor recognition, ACE2 ecotodomain
(residues Q18 to S740) gene, with an N-terminal IL10 signal peptide, tagged with human
IgG1Fc and His tag at the C-terminus, were cloned into the pcDNA 3.4 vector. Codonoptimized RBD (residues V320 to G550) gene fragment, with an N-terminal IL10 signal
peptide, tagged with His tag at the C-terminus, were cloned into the pcDNA 3.4 vector. Three
SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants were constructed. For mutant RBD (Core), amino acids R319 to
N437 of core region in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were substituted by the corresponding region
of SARS-CoV strain Tor2 (GenBank ID: AAP41037.1). For mutants RBD (RBM-R2) and
RBD (RBM-R3), residues L452 to K462, and residues T470 to T478 of RBM region in the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD were mutated into the corresponding regions of SARS-CoV strain Tor2,
respectively. For single point mutations of RBD (Q498A), RBD (V503A), and RBD (Y505A),
RBD residues Q498, V503, and Y505 were substituted by Ala, respectively. All mutant
plasmids were constructed using the MutExpressTM II Fast Mutagenesis Kit V2 (Vazyme,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The proteins were generated using HEK
293F expression system and purified as described above.
Anti-RBD polyclonal antibody and monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1A10 were prepared by
immunizing BALB/c mice with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused with a C-terminal
mouse IgGFc tag (Sino Biological Inc, Beijing, China) using previously described protocols
(Qu et al., 2020).
The purified RBD mutants were tested by ELISA for reactivity with the receptor ACE2.
Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with 100 ng/well of the purified RBD mutants in PBS at
37°C for 2 hours and then blocked with 5% milk in PBS-Tween20 (PBST). Next, the plates
were incubated with 50 ng/well of ACE2-hFc fusion protein, 50 µL/well of culture supernatant
of hybridoma 1A10, or 50 µL/well of mouse anti-RBD sera (diluted at 1/1000) at 37°C for 2 h.
After washing, the corresponding secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated anti-human IgG1 (Abcam, USA) or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma,
USA), were added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After washing color development, absorbance
at 450 nm was determined.
