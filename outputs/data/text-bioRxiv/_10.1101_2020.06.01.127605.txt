Abstract
Background - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has emerged as global pandemic.
SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of cardiac injury associated with higher
risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether cardiac injury may have been
caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes or is mainly secondary to lung injury and
inflammation. Here we investigate whether human cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARSCoV-2 infection.
Methods - Infection was induced by two strains of SARS-CoV-2 (FFM1 and FFM2) in
human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM) and in two models
of human cardiac tissue.
Results - We show that SARS-CoV-2 infects hiPS-CM as demonstrated by detection of
intracellular double strand viral RNA and viral spike glycoprotein protein expression.
Increasing concentrations of virus RNA are detected in supernatants of infected
cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in CaCo-2 cell lines documenting productive
infections. SARS-COV-2 infection induced cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects and abolished
cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral
infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to
viral response and interferon signaling, apoptosis and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2
infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a iPS-derived human 3D cardiosphere tissue
models. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human
heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions- The demonstration that cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2
infection in vitro warrants the further in depth monitoring of cardiotoxic effects in COVID-19
patients.

Clinical Perspective
What is New?
•

This study demonstrates that human cardiac myocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV2 infection.

•

The study documents that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a full replicatory circle and
induces a cytotoxic response in cardiomyocytes.

•

Infection was confirmed in two cardiac tissue models, including living human heart
slices.

What are the Clinical Implications?
•

The study may provide a rational to explain part of the cardiotoxicity observed in
COVID-19 patients

•

The demonstration of direct cardiotoxicity induced by SARS-CoV-2 warrants an in
depth further analysis of cardiac tissue of COVID-19 patients and a close monitoring
for putative direct cardiomyocyte injury.

•

The established models can be used to test novel therapeutic approaches targeting
COVID-19.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has emerged as global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 mainly
invades alveolar epithelial cells and causes adult respiratory distress syndromes. COVID-19 is
associated with myocardial injury, as assessed by increased troponin T and NT-proBNP levels
accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in a significant number of SARS-CoV-2
infected patients1,2. Elevated levels of cardiac injury markers were associated with higher risk
of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients3. In patients showing clinical deterioration
during COVID-19, left ventricular systolic dysfunction was noted in approximately 20 % of
patients according to a most recent study4. In addition, patients with underlying
cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of patients, who may suffer from
severe courses after COVID-19 infections5. However, it is unclear whether elevated
biomarkers of cardiac injury and long term effects on the cardiovascular system are directly
caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic
inflammation during complicated COVID-19 courses. Earlier studies with cardiac tissue
samples did not find evidence for viral particles of the first SARS corona virus SARS-CoV6,
but other studies suggest that the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), which has similar pathogenicity as SARS-CoV-2, can cause acute myocarditis
and heart failure7. Moreover, substantial amounts of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in
human hearts of COVID-19 patients8.
Single cell RNA sequencing and histological analyses demonstrated that human
cardiomyocytes express the putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2),

particularly in

patients

with cardiovascular

diseases9,10 suggesting that

cardiomyocytes could be targeted by SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infects human induced pluripotent stem
cell-derived cardiomyocytes in culture and in two models of human cardiac tissue including
human heart slices in vitro.

Methods
Cell Culture
hiPS-CM of two donors were obtained with an embryoid body-based protocol as described11.
Cardiospheres were generated by adapting a previously described protocol12 using hiPS cells.
Living human heart slices (300 µm) were generated and cultured as described9
Viral infection
SARS-CoV-2-FFM1 and FFM2 were isolated and propagated in Caco-2 cells as described
13,14

. The viral stock was diluted to desired MOI in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum

and incubated with cells for 2 h. Then the infectious inoculum was removed and cells were
supplemented with the respective culture medium11. Cardiospheres were cultured with 25µl of
viral stock (1.107 TCID50/ml) and living human heart slices were incubated with 200µl of
viral stock (1.107 TCID50/ml) for three to five days.
Quantification of SARS-CoV RNA in cell culture supernatants was performed as previously
described14. For detection of viral titer, hiPS-CM were infected for 2 h, the infection medium
was replaced, and supernatants were collected 48h post infection and used to infect confluent
layers of CaCo-2 cells in 96-well plates. Cytopathogenic eﬀects were assessed visually 48 h
after infection. The infectious titer was determined as TCID50/ml.

Results
Expression of receptor and co-receptor
We first addressed if human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM)
showed the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and the serine proteases
TMPRSS2 and cathepsins, which mediate priming of the viral S-protein15. ACE2 and
cathepsins CTSB and CTSL were well expressed on mRNA level in hiPS-CM, whereas
TMPRSS2 was detected only at very low levels by RNA sequencing (Figure 1a).
Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the expression of ACE2, but TMPRSS2 was below the
detection level (Figure 1b). ACE2 protein expression was confirmed by immunostainings
using two different antibodies (Figure 1c, Online Supplement Figure I) documenting that
human cardiomyocytes possess the so far described receptor and activators necessary for
effective SARS-CoV-2 infection.
hiPS-CM are infected by SARS-CoV-2
To test if hiPS-CM are directly targeted and are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, hiPSCM were infected with isolates of SARS-CoV-213 (Figure 2a). SARS-CoV-2 infected hiPSCM showed increased intracellular double stranded virus RNA as demonstrated by
immunostaining (Figure 2b). Viral RNA in supernatants was further assessed by PCR and
was dose- and time-dependently increased after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2c-e).
Consistently, the expression of the viral spike glycoprotein protein was detected in a time- and
dose dependent manner after infection with different strains of the virus (FFM1 and FFM213)
(Figure 2f-i). Control experiments confirmed spike protein expression in α-sarcomeric
actinin-expressing cardiomyocytes (Figure 2i). The supernatant of hiPC-CM contained fully
infectious virus, as demonstrated by titration in CaCo-2 cells (Figure 2j) indicating that the
virus undergoes full replicatory cycles in hiPS-CM. Functionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection
reduced cell counts (Figure 2k). and augmented apoptosis in hiPS-CM (Figure 2l).
Interestingly, the frequency of beating was significantly augmented at 24h to 48h post
infection, but was abolished at later time points (Figure 2m). Profound cytopathogenic effects
were visible at later time points (96 h) (Figure 2h). RNA sequencing demonstrated that
infected hiPS-CM showed a strong transcriptional response to viral infection including
interferon activation (Figure 2n) and signatures of apoptosis and oxidative stress (Figure 2o).
SARS-CoV-2 infects cardiomyocytes in three dimensional cardiac tissue
Next, we determined if SARS-CoV-2 infects cardiomyocytes in a three dimensional tissue
environment using human cardiospheres generated by hiPS-cells, which are generated by a

modified previously published protocol12 (Figure 3a-b). SARS-CoV-2 time-dependently
affected beating frequency of cardiospheres with a profound inhibition at 5 days post infection
(Figure 3c). At 5 days post infection, cardiospheres showed a reduced size (Figure 3d)
consistent with the induction of cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infection was further documented by
spike protein staining (Figure 3d).
Finally, we addressed whether SARS-CoV-2 infects human heart tissue by using living
human cardiac tissue slices, which were obtained from explanted hearts16 (Figure 4a-f). Here,
increased spike protein expression was shown in four different samples derived from three
donors (Figure 4c-e). Infection was associated with morphological signs of tissue injury such
as areas with loss of α-saromeric actinin signal and disorganized structure compared to
homogenous mock controls (Figure 4c). Spike protein expression was detected in asacromeric actinin positive cardiomyocytes (Figure 4d). The virus was further identified in
infected human heart tissue in cardiomyocytes by electron microscopy (Figure 4f). Of note,
stages of the entire replicatory cycle were detected (Figure 4f, right panel)

Discussion
Together, SARS-CoV-2 can infect human cardiomyocytes in culture as well as in two
different models of cardiac tissue. Infection was documented by various read outs including
intracellular viral double strand RNA and spike protein expression, as well as extracellular
viral RNA. The virus was further detected by electron microscopy in cells of the infected
human heart slices. Importantly, functional virus could be isolated in supernatants of infected
cardiomyocytes documenting that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a full replicatory cycle. Of note,
viral infection was confirmed with cells of two different hiPS-donors and two viral strains.
Whereas the receptor ACE2 was well expressed on mRNA and protein level, the previously
described protease activator TMPRSS2 was very lowly expressed in hiPS-CM, suggesting
that activation of the S-protein may be mediated by other serine proteases such as cathepsins,
which also can mediate viral activation15. Viral infection was associated with cytotoxic effects
and inhibition of beating of cardiomyocytes in our in vitro cultures and cardiospheres
suggesting a potential detrimental effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the human heart.
SARS-CoV-2 elicits a typical transcriptional response to viral infection including the
activation of interferon pathways. Since we recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2
infection deregulates pathways involved in ER stress and protein homeostasis14, one may
hypothesize that viral infection may induce ER stress leading to prolonged unfolded protein
response and subsequent alteration in calcium homeostasis and cardiomyocyte cell death 17.
Although there is compelling evidence that patients suffering from COVID-19 show profound
elevations of cardiac injury biomarkers and deteriorated right and left ventricular cardiac
function, a direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes by SARS-CoV-2 has not been
demonstrated so far. Viral RNA, however, has been detected at significant levels in cardiac
tissue8 and cardiomyocyte infection may occur during conditions of vascular leakage and
tissue inflammation. The lack of clear-cut detection of virus in cardiomyocytes so far, may be
related the difficulties in findings the areas of infection and the rapid induction of cell death
and clearance of the infected cells.
The profound effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human cardiomyocytes observed in the present in
vitro study warrant the further in depth monitoring of direct cardiac effects in COVID-19
patients. The used 3D tissue models may serve as experimental model for testing the effects
of coronavirus infection and biology in the heart and developing therapeutic strategies.
