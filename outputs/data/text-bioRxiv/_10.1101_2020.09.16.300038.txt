Abstract

20

Background. The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with severe

21

acute respiratory disease (COVID-19) has prompted efforts to understand the genetic basis for its

22

unique characteristics and its jump from non-primate hosts to humans. Tests for positive

23

selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes,

24

highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species.

25

Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and

26

positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to

27

nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA

28

molecules.

29

Methods. Here we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow

30

windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code.

31

Results. We recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of

32

both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive

33

selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and

34

Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein

35

structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. Thermodynamic modeling of RNA

36

stability and structure, however, indicates that RNA secondary structure within both genes in the

37

SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from those of RaTG13, the reconstructed common ancestor, and

38

Pan-CoV-GD (Guangdong). These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular

39

processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription,

40

translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight

41

the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their

42

impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to

43

the viral life cycle.

Introduction

46

An important challenge in understanding zoonotic events is identifying the genetic changes that

47

allow a pathogen to infect a new host. Such information can highlight molecular processes in

48

both the pathogen and host that have practical value. The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a

49

novel coronavirus, provides both a challenge and an opportunity to learn more about the specific

50

adaptations that enable the virus to thrive in human hosts and that endow it with traits distinct

51

from previously described coronaviruses. Formal tests for natural selection are a powerful tool in

52

this endeavor because they can be applied in an unbiased manner throughout the viral genome:

53

evidence of negative selection can reveal regions of the genome that are broadly constrained

54

functionally and thus unlikely to contribute to species-specific traits, while evidence of branch-

55

specific positive selection can identify candidate regions of the genome where molecular

56

processes may have diverged from that of other species.

57

Several recent studies have tested for natural selection in the SARS-CoV-2 genome based on the

58

ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous (dN/dS) substitutions relative to other coronaviruses

59

(Tang et al., 2020; Chaw et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a). The most prominent signal to emerge

60

from these studies is a mix of positive and purifying selection within the gene encoding the Spike

61

glycoprotein, which mediates invasion of host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

62

enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in host cells (Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Tortorici & Veesler,

63

2019). This finding makes good biological sense, because structural changes in the spike protein

64

are common and are known to influence the ability of the virus to infect new hosts and jump

65

between species (Hulswit, de Haan & Bosch, 2016). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

66

that results in an amino acid substitution in Spike protein has increased in frequency during the

67

global pandemic more rapidly than other SNPs (Korber et al., 2020), leading to speculation that

68

it is an adaptation that alters the interaction between Spike and ACE2, FURIN and

69

TMPRSS2 (Eaaswarkhanth, Al Madhoun & Al-Mulla, 2020).

70

Beyond mutations that alter Spike protein, however, there exists little understanding of positive

71

selection within the SARS-CoV-2 genome and how this may have shaped viral traits. Few

72

convincing signals of positive selection exist for any of the other viral proteins (Cagliani et al.,

73

2020; Velazquez-Salinas et al., 2020; Chaw et al., 2020). For RNA viruses, however, critical

74

aspects of the life cycle rely on molecular processes that are not reflected in protein sequence. In

75

particular, in positive-strand RNA viruses such as coronaviruses, the single RNA molecule that

76

constitutes the genome is first transcribed and translated to produce the replicase polyprotein 1a

77

and 1ab that is cleaved into multiple non-structural proteins, some of which participate in the

78

assembly of a cellular structure known as the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), where the

79

proper environment for viral replication and transcription is created. Then, the RNA-dependent-

80

RNA-polymerase (RdRp or Nsp12) produces negative sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs

81

that are used as template strands that are then transcribed in the opposite direction to make more

82

positive-sense viral genomes and a variety of RNA molecules that are translated into structural

83

proteins for packaging (Fehr & Perlman, 2015; Kim et al., 2020). Although the viral proteins that

84

help mediate these processes are visible to tests for selection that rely on dN/dS ratios, the RNA

85

molecules with which they interact are not. This leaves the operation of natural selection on

86

important molecular functions within the viral life cycle largely unexamined.

87

Here we utilize a test for positive selection that identifies an excess of nucleotide substitutions

88

within a defined window in the genome relative to neutral expectation using a likelihood ratio

89

framework (Wong & Nielsen, 2004; Haygood et al., 2007). We implemented this test using

90

adaptiPhy (Berrio, Haygood & Wray, 2020) to infer regions of the genome that were likely

91

targets of branch-specific positive selection in several Sarbecovirus species from bat, pangolin,

92

and human hosts. Our results recapitulate results from dN/dS-based tests that highlight S, the

93

gene encoding Spike protein, as a prominent target of natural selection within the SARS-CoV-2

94

genome (Cagliani et al., 2020; Chaw et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a). Importantly, we also identify

95

genomic regions not previously reported to be targets of positive selection. Based on structural

96

modeling of RNA and protein, we argue that these newly identified regions of positive selection

97

likely affect species-specific RNA, rather than protein, function. These genomic regions are

98

candidates for understanding the molecular mechanisms that endow SARS-CoV-2 with some of

99

its unique biological properties.

Materials & Methods

101

Sequence Alignment

102

To identify branch specific positive selection, it is necessary to obtain a query and a reference

103

alignment. We downloaded six high quality reference genomes from the subgenus Sarbecovirus

104

(Table 1). Next, we used MAFFT (Katoh & Standley, 2013) plugin in Geneious Prime v.2.1

105

(Kearse et al., 2012) with default settings to build a sequence alignment. Next, we refined the

106

alignment using a gene by gene procedure.

107
108

Testing for Positive Selection

109

Despite adaptiPhy was originally designed to investigate regions of complex genomes under

110

positive selection, it can be used to identify regions of a viral sequence alignment where the

111

foreground branch is evolving at faster rates than the expectation from the background species.

112

We performed a selection analysis on sliding windows of 300 bp with a step of 150 bp along a

113

sequence alignment of 5 reference genome sequences of coronaviruses of the subgenus

114

Sarbecovirus and two sequences of Pangolin Coronavirus recently published (Liu, Chen & Chen,

115

2019; Lam et al., 2020). This procedure generates partitions where a tree topology can be fitted.

116

To investigate the extent of positive selection or branches with long substitution rates along the

117

SARS-CoV-2 genome, we used a branch-specific method known as adaptiPhy that was initially

118

developed in 2007 (Haygood et al., 2007) and recently improved (Berrio, Haygood & Wray,

119

2020). This computational methodology makes use of a likelihood ratio test based on the

120

maximum likelihood estimates obtained from HyPhy v2.5 (Pond, Frost & Muse, 2005; Pond et

121

al., 2020). The branch of interest (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 branch) is used as the foreground and the

122

rest of the alignment is used as the background. To obtain data from nucleotide substitutions

123

alone, we used msa_split from PHAST (Hubisz, Pollard & Siepel, 2011) to remove insertions

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

124

and any sequence gaps that were present in the genomes of the background virus species relative

125

to the SARS-CoV-2 genome.The assumption for the background species is the same for both the

126

null and alternative models; specifically, only neutral evolution and negative (purifying)

127

selection are permitted. While in the foreground, the assumptions are the same as for the

128

background in the null model. In the alternative model, all three types of evolution are permitted

129

(neutral evolution, negative selection, and positive selection) in the foreground of the following

130

topology: (((((SARS_CoV_2, Bat_CoV_RaTG13), Pa_CoV_Guangdong),

131

Pa_CoV_Guangxi_P4L), (Bat_CoV_LYRa11, SARS_CoV)), Bat_CoV_BM48). This method is

132

highly sensitive and specific and can differentiate between positive selection and relaxation of

133

constraint. AdaptiPhy requires at least 3 kb reference alignment for each species that is used as a

134

putatively neutral proxy for computing substitution rates. Viruses’ genomes lack non-functional

135

regions, therefore, the most reasonable proxy for neutral evolution has to be found in the regions

136

outside the query window. To do this, we concatenated twenty regions of 300 bp of the viral

137

genome alignment that were drawn randomly with replacement from the entire genome

138

alignment. Then, for each query alignment, we built a reference alignment of 6 kb as it produces

139

a stable evolutionary standard of recombination rates. To control for the stochasticity of the

140

evolutionary process, we run each query against ten bootstrapped samples of reference

141

alignments. Finally, we used a custom R script to compute the likelihood ratio, which was used

142

as a test statistic for a chi-squared test with one degree of freedom to calculate a P-value for each

143

query. Then, we corrected the distribution of all P-values per query region using the p.adjust() R

144

function with the fdr method. Next, we classified a query window to be under positive selection

145

if the P-adjusted value was < 0.05. We were unable to successfully run adaptiPhy on two

146

windows because the outgroup species (Bat_CoV_BM48) contained a deletion of 406 bp relative

147

to SARS-CoV-2, which spans the entire ORF8.

148

Next, we calculated the distribution of substitution rates for each branch and nodes in each query

149

and reference sequence using phyloFit (Hubisz, Pollard & Siepel, 2011). To visualize the

150

strength of selection comprehensively, we computed the statistic ζ (zeta), representing the

151

evolutionary rate. To calculate this rate, we compared the substitution rate in the query with their

152

respective reference alignments. This parameter, “ζ”, is analogous to ω (omega), the ratio of

153

dN/dS, where a value of ω<1 indicates constraint or negative selection; a value of ω=1 indicates

154

neutrality; and a value of ω>1 indicates positive selection (Wong & Nielsen, 2004).

155

Testing for Conservation

156

To test for conservation, we used the phastCons computational method from PHAST (Siepel et

157

al., 2005; Hubisz, Pollard & Siepel, 2011). To run this tool, we used the models obtained with

158

phyloFit for the reference alignments and then, we generated an average estimate of the

159

conserved and non-conserved states of the models with phyloBoot (Hubisz, Pollard & Siepel,

160

2011). Finally, we run the final analysis using phastCons on the query alignments using the

161

previous models to generate phastCons values for each base-pair along the sequence. To plot

162

these we took the average from each alignment and plot it using the library Gviz and

163

Bioconductor (Hahne & Ivanek, 2016) in R.

164

Testing for Recombination

165

Inference of branch specific selection can be confounded by recombination given that a single

166

phylogenetic tree may not explain the evolution of viruses. Recombination is common in

167

coronaviruses (Hon et al., 2008; Graham & Baric, 2010; Lau et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2017; Li et

168

al., 2020b; Lam et al., 2020) and it should be accounted for as an alternative explanation of

169

selection at the nucleotide level. Here, we screened for evidence of recombination in two ways,

170

one, by estimating phylogenetic trees in sliding windows of 500 bp and a step of 150 along

171

coronavirus alignment using RaXML-NG v0.9 (Kozlov et al., 2019).

172

Evaluating polymorphic diversity in the pandemics of 2020

173

We downloaded complete sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the NCBI Virus database

174

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?SeqType_s=Nucleotide). As of June 26,

175

2020, we obtained and aligned 5597 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced worldwide. To align

176

these sequences, we used MAFFT (Katoh & Standley, 2013) plugin from Geneious Prime 2.1

177

(Kearse et al., 2012), eliminating 597 sequences with the highest number of differences and

178

ambiguities relative to the reference sequence (RefSeq: NC_045512.2), for a total of 5,000

179

sequences. Next, we estimated the frequency of SNP variants using the Find Variations/SNPs

180

tool with a minimum coverage of 4,900 sequences and a minimum frequency of 0.01, to identify

181

nucleotide variants among a subset of high quality sequenced genomes in order to evaluate

182

ongoing evolution in the regions under positive selection.

183

Analysis of RNA and Protein structures

184

To investigate potential structural changes in Nsp4 and Nsp16 at both the RNA and protein level,

185

we performed minimum free energy (MFE) prediction analysis using the RNAfold WebServer

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

186

(Gruber et al., 2008; Lorenz et al., 2011) and consensus homology modeling using PHYRE2's

187

intensive mode (Kelley et al., 2016). These analyses were performed for both Nsp4 and Nsp16

188

sequences for SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV_RaTG13, Pan-CoV-Guangdong, and SARS-CoV.

189

RNAfold uses a loop-based energy model and a dynamic programming algorithm to predict the

190

structure of the sequence such that the free energy of the structure is minimized. The RNAfold

191

WebServer generates graphical outputs for both the MFE and Centroid structures, which display

192

the base pairing probabilities by color (blue = 0, red = 1). These two MFE structures correspond

193

to the MFE and the Centroid traces in the mountain plot, which is a positional representation of

194

the secondary structure. In our figures, we show the MFE structure prediction.

195

PHYRE2 aligns input protein sequences using Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST)

196

against sequences of experimentally resolved protein structures. A 3D model of the input

197

sequence is then constructed based on homology-matched templates, optimizing for greatest

198

sequence coverage and highest confidence. Regions of the input sequence without a matching

199

template sequence are modeled ab initio and with Poing, a multi-template modelling tool.

200

Pairwise comparisons of predicted protein structures were visualized using PyMOL software

201

(DeLano, 2002). Alignment and structural comparisons performed by FATCAT (Ye & Godzik,

202

2004).

203

Results

204

Positive and negative selection are highly localized within coronavirus genomes

205

We tested for branch-specific selection on nucleotide sequences in coronavirus genomes,

206

focusing on six species from the Sarbecovirus Subgenus (Coronaviridae family) and Bat-CoV-

207

BM48-31/BGR/2008 as an outgroup. Using 300 bp windows with a step size of 150 bp, we

208

scanned the genome alignment for concentrations of fixed mutations that exceed the neutral

209

expectation based on the genome as whole relative to that particular window’s evolutionary

210

history among the seven species. This test identifies regions of the genome showing the most

211

extreme divergence in nucleotide sequence on a particular branch relative to its specific

212

background rate of evolution across the entire phylogeny and without reference to the genetic

213

code. Fig 1A shows windows of inferred positive selection (red dots) on the branch leading to

214

each species. The results reveal several signals of positive selection that are unique to a single

215

species and others that are recapitulated in multiple species. The latter finding suggests that some

216

segments of the viral genome have repeatedly experienced adaptive modification. In general, the

217

distribution of positive selection is more similar in closely related species than in divergent ones

218

(Figs 1A and 1B), suggesting that some molecular functions have been altered over an interval

219

that extends beyond the origin of a single species but not across the entire Sarbecovirus

220

radiation.

221

Next, we identified regions of the genome that are highly conserved across the sarbecovirus

222

genomes examined in this study using PhastCons (Siepel et al., 2005) (Fig 2A). As with positive

223

selection, conservation is highly localized (Figs 2A and 2B). Based on a criterion of PhastCons >

224

0.9, we found high levels of conservation in regions encoding seven proteins: 3CL-Pro, Nsp6,

225

Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp11, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Protein 3a, Nucleocapsid

226

phosphoprotein, and Envelope (Figs 2A-D). These loci of exceptional sequence conservation

227

highlight critical molecular features: Nucleocapsid and Envelope are essential structural proteins

228

of the coronavirus capsid, while the other proteins regulate a variety of molecular process during

229

viral replication (Tan et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006; Minakshi et al., 2009; Freundt et al., 2010;

230

Fuchs, 2012; Yue et al., 2018).

231

The gene encoding Spike protein is under persistent positive selection

232

In all ingroup species examined we detected signals of positive selection within the S

233

gene, which encodes the Spike protein, and in five of the six species this was the most prominent

234

signal in the entire genome (Fig 1A). This finding confirms previous studies that used the dN/dS

235

ratio to test for selection on protein function (Tang et al., 2020; Chaw et al., 2020; Li et al.,

236

2020a). Interestingly, we observed that the specific regions showing signatures of positive

237

selection differed between species (Figs 1B and 1C). In SARS-CoV-2, we detected signals of

238

positive selection in four segments of the S gene. First, the region encoding the entire receptor

239

binding domain (RBD) shows an extended signal (Figs 1B-C and 3A); as others have noted,

240

structural changes in this region may improve binding to human ACE2 (Wang et al., 2020;

241

Wrapp et al., 2020; Wang, Liu & Gao, 2020). The second segment encodes another externally

242

facing region, the S1 subunit N-terminal (NTD) domain, which includes the first disulfide bond

243

(amino acids 13 - 113) and several glycosylation sites. The third signal of positive selection

244

within S is located around the derived furin cleavage site (amino acids 664 - 812) that has been

245

found to be essential for infection of lung cells (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber & Pöhlmann, 2020).

246

The fourth signal is located in a segment encoding the S2 and S2’ subunits that includes the

247

Heptad repeat 2 (amino acids 1114 - 1213). These heptad repeats were previously associated

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

248

with episodes of selection for amino acids that increase the stability of the six-helix bundle

249

formed by both heptad repeats in MERS and other coronaviruses (Forni et al., 2015); they are

250

also thought to determine host expansions and therefore, facilitate virus cross-species

251

transmission (Graham & Baric, 2010).

252

The distribution of inferred positive selection in the S gene of SARS-CoV differed from that of

253

SARS-CoV-2 described above. Notably, there was no signal in the ACE2 binding domain (Figs

254

1B and 1C). Moreover, a signal was present throughout the N-terminal domain and in the

255

boundary region between the S1 and the S2 subunits (Fig 1), a region that includes the

256

proteolytic cleavage (M de Haan et al., 2004). Interestingly, this region evolved a novel furin

257

cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 that may increase the cleavage efficiency and cell-cell fusion

258

activity and changes in the virulence of the virion as seen in mutant studies of SARS-CoV and

259

SARS-CoV-2 (Follis, York & Nunberg, 2006; Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber & Pöhlmann, 2020).

260

Genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16 contain branch-specific signals of positive selection

261

We also detected two shorter signals of positive selection within the SARS-CoV-2

262

genome that are located outside of the S gene, in ORF1a and ORF1b (Fig 1A). Interestingly,

263

both encode small proteins that contribute to viral replication. The first is Nsp4, which encodes a

264

membrane-bound protein with a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain; it is thought to anchor the

265

Viral-Replication-Transcription Complex (RTC) to the modified endoplasmic reticulum

266

membranes in the host cell (Oostra et al., 2008; Hagemeijer et al., 2011, 2014; Snijder, Decroly

267

& Ziebuhr, 2016). The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp4 protein differs from that of closely related

268

sarbecoviruses by two nearly adjacent amino acids: V380A and V382I. Although this region of

269

the genome as a whole is not highly conserved (Fig 2), both of these positions are V residues in

270

all of the in-group species we examined except SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3B and 4A). This signal is too

271

weak to be scored as positive selection using dN/dS-based tests (Sharp, 1997; Nielsen, 1997;

272

Yang & Nielsen, 2008) and indeed may not affect protein function given the biochemically

273

similar side-chains of the amino acids involved.

274

The second signal of positive selection outside of the S gene lies within Nsp16. This gene

275

encodes a 2'-O-methyltransferase that modifies the 5'-cap of viral mRNAs (Decroly et al., 2008;

276

Bouvet et al., 2010) and assists in evasion of the innate immune system of host cells (Züst et al.,

277

2011; Menachery, Debbink & Baric, 2014; Nelemans & Kikkert, 2019). Of note, this is the only

278

signal of positive selection within the SARS-CoV-2 genome that lacks any nonsynonymous

279

substitutions (Fig 2). All of the nucleotide substitutions in Nsp16 during the origin of SARS-

280

CoV-2 are synonymous, while the Nsp16 genes of SARS-CoV-2, Bat-Cov-RaTG13, and Pan-

281

CoV-GD (Guangdong) all encode identical proteins (Figs 3C and 5A). This suggests a complex

282

mechanism of selection in the form of purifying selection at the protein level and positive

283

selection at the nucleotide level. Ancestral state reconstruction of Nsp16 indicates that 20

284

synonymous substitutions likely occurred in the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 after the split

285

from the common ancestor with BatCoV-RaTG13, while 19 substitutions are synonymous

286

substitutions that occurred in the lineage leading to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 (Supplementary data).

287

Eleven of these twenty substitutions are concentrated within the region scoring high for positive

288

selection in SARS-CoV-2 and twelve within the positively selected region in Bat-CoV-RaTG13.

289

Surprised by these findings, we hypothesized that the Nsp16 RNA secondary structure may

290

differ among species in ways that affect molecular functions mediated directly (although not

291

solely) by RNA, such as replication, transcription, translation, or evasion of the host immune

292

system. To investigate this possibility, we first compared the secondary structure and minimum

293

free energy (MFE) of RNA in the vicinity of Nsp4 and Nsp16 among the genomes of SARS-

294

CoV-2, Bat-CoV-RaTG13, Pan-CoV-GD, and SARS-CoV using RNAfold (Gruber et al., 2008).

295

Both the predicted secondary structures and mountain plots, which show the free energy

296

predictions along the length of the sequence by position, reveal differences in RNA folding

297

dynamics across the four species (Figs 4B and 5B). Analysis of the reconstructed sequence of the

298

SARS-CoV-2 + Bat-CoV-RaTG13 ancestor reveal that most of these differences evolved during

299

the origin of SARS-CoV-2 (S1 Fig). These differences among species in predicted secondary

300

structures within Nsp4 and Nsp16 stand in contrast to the 5’ UTR, which is thought to fold into a

301

stable secondary structure that is markedly conserved among Sarbecovirus species (S3 Fig).

302

Together, these observations suggest that the signal of positive selection within Nsp16 in the

303

SARS-CoV-2 genome may reflect changes in RNA, rather than protein, function that are unique

304

to this species of coronavirus.

305

While the focus here is on SARS-CoV-2, it is worth noting that we also detected signals of

306

positive selection outside of the S gene in the other sarbecovirus genomes examined here. The

307

distribution of positive selection in the genome of SARS-CoV, for instance, shows some

308

similarities to, but also notable differences from, that of SARS-Cov-2 (Fig 1). In both species, S

309

and Nsp16 contain signals of positive selection, although in distinct regions of the two genes (Fig

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

310

1). In addition, the genome of SARS-CoV contains signals of positive selection in Nsp2, Nsp3,

311

and ORF3a, none of which shows elevated rates of substitution in SARS-CoV-2. The first two

312

genes encode proteins with important roles in viral replication: Nsp2 may disrupt intracellular

313

signaling in the host cell (Cornillez-Ty et al., 2009) while Nsp3 cleaves itself, Nsp1, and Nsp2

314

from the replicase polyproteins (Báez-Santos, St. John & Mesecar, 2015), assists in the assembly

315

of the double membrane vesicles of the RTC system (Hagemeijer et al., 2014), and antagonizes

316

the host innate immune response (Tsuchida, Kawai & Akira, 2009; Frieman et al., 2009;

317

Matthews et al., 2014).

318

Recombination does not account for most signals of positive selection

319

Recombination from another species can be a confounding factor in the inference of positive

320

selection using the framework employed here, because the inserted genomic segment may be

321

more divergent than the rest of the foreground genome is from nearby background species.

322

Several instances of recombination have been reported in coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2

323

(Hon et al., 2008; Lam et al., 2020; Boni et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a), making it important to

324

distinguish regions of recombination from positive selection. The two processes produce distinct

325

genetic signatures, with recombination the result of a single event (possibly later further

326

recombined) and positive selection as detected here the result of multiple independent mutations

327

that were fixed over an extended interval and are spatially concentrated. In order to test for

328

regions of the SARS-CoV-2 that contain recombined segments from other species, we estimated

329

the phylogenetic history of 500 bp segments of the genome with a step size of 150 bp among the

330

aligned genomes of the seven species examined in this study. We used RaXML-NG v0.9

331

(Kozlov et al., 2019) to reconstruct topology for each segment independently and searched for

332

cases where the topology differed from the expected topology based on the entire genome: (Bat-

333

CoV-BM48, ((Bat-CoV-LYRa11, SARS-CoV), (Pa-CoV-GX, (Pa-CoV-GD, (SARS-CoV-2, Ba-

334

CoV-RaTG13)))). Recombination from a divergent species should produce an incongruent

335

topology in one or more adjacent windows, revealing a recombined region and its approximate

336

breakpoints. We identified 12 regions where the topology differed from the expected (Fig 6). Of

337

note, these regions are somewhat more concentrated in the part of the genome that encodes

338

structural proteins. Consistent with a previous report (Li et al., 2020a), we observed overlap

339

between regions scoring high for positive selection and recombination in S, the gene encoding

340

Spike protein (Fig 6M), specifically the region that encodes for the ACE2 binding domain and a

341

region that includes the furin-cleavage site (Figs 6F-G). Importantly, however, none of the

342

putatively recombined regions overlap with the windows scoring high for positive selection

343

within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16 proteins in SARS-CoV-2.

344

Recent changes in allele frequency may result from positive selection and hitch-hiking

345

To gain insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that have shaped genetic variation more

346

recently within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we compiled a list of known mutations, based on

347

5,000 accessions sequenced since the beginning of the current pandemic (see Methods). As

348

expected, the vast majority of variants are singletons, representing either mutations that are not

349

segregating or sequencing errors. The density distribution of polymorphisms (regardless of

350

frequency) is elevated within 2-3 kb at both ends the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig 2D). The site-

351

frequency spectrum is strongly left-skewed (S2 Fig). Given that the effective population size of

352

SARS-CoV-2 is likely very large, this distribution suggests that most SNPs are not subject to

353

positive selection and that negative selection prevents most new mutations from rising in

354

frequency due to drift. However, we did observe four SNPs that are present at high alternative

355

allele frequency (AAF > 0.6) (Fig 2C), a situation that can reflect positive selection, drift, or

356

hitch-hiking. Interestingly, all four of these SNPs are in tight LD (Toyoshima et al., 2020), which

357

suggests that positive selection on one of them may have driven the other three to high frequency

358

due to hitch-hiking.

359

We next investigated the likely consequences for altered molecular function due to each of these

360

four high-frequency derived SNPs. Two are located within regions of the genome that are highly

361

conserved among sarbecovirus species (Figs 2B-C). The first is a C>U substitution at position

362

241 in the 5’UTR, a region of the genome where RNA secondary structure is highly conserved

363

across Coronavirus species (Madhugiri et al., 2016; Rangan et al., 2020; Alhatlani, 2020). Using

364

RNAfold (Gruber et al., 2008) we found that this C>U transition had no impact on the stem-loop

365

structure established for SARS-CoV (S3 Fig). The other mutation in a conserved region of the

366

genome is a nonsynonymous substitution in the RdRp gene (14,408; P323L) at the interface

367

domain, which is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (Pachetti et al., 2020; Hillen et

368

al., 2020). Because proline residues can influence secondary structure, we used PHYRE2 to

369

predict the impact of the P232L mutation on protein structure. Comparison of the two predicted

370

structures using FATCAT shows they are nearly identical (Table S1). The other two high-

371

frequency derived SNPs are located in regions that are neither highly conserved nor highly

372

divergent. One is a synonymous SNP in Nsp3 (3,037) and the other a nonsynonymous SNP in S

373

(23,403; D614G). This last SNP effectively removes a charged side-chain between the receptor

374

binding domain and the furin cleavage site of S, a region of recurrent positive selection among

375

the Sarbecovirus species we examined. Thus, of the four high-frequency derived SNPs, the

376

nonsynonymous substitution in S the most plausible candidate for altering molecular function

377

and thus becoming a target of natural selection.

378
379

Discussion

380

A crucial feature contributing to the global spread of Covid19 is that viral shedding starts before

381

the onset of symptoms (He et al., 2020); in contrast, shedding began two to ten days after the

382

onset of symptoms during the SARS epidemic of 2003 (Peiris et al., 2003; Pitzer, Leung &

383

Lipsitch, 2007). This striking difference suggests that one or more molecular mechanisms during

384

host cell invasion, virus replication, or immune avoidance may have changed during the origin of

385

SARS-CoV-2. Mutations contributing to viral transmission would likely be favored by natural

386

selection, making tests for positive selection a useful tool for identifying candidate genetic

387

changes responsible for the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we searched for regions of

388

possible positive selection within the genomes of six coronavirus species, including SARS-CoV

389

and SARS-CoV-2. The method we used tests for an excess of branch-specific nucleotide

390

substitutions within a defined window relative to a neutral expectation for divergence in that

391

window and without regard to the genetic code (Wong & Nielsen, 2004; Haygood et al., 2007;

392

Berrio, Haygood & Wray, 2020).

393

Several prior studies have identified S, the gene encoding the Spike glycoprotein, as a target of

394

recurrent positive selection in coronavirus genomes, including SARS-CoV-2, based on ω, the

395

ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions (Andersen et al., 2020; Cagliani et al.,

396

2020; Tang et al., 2020; ArmijosJaramillo et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a). S

397

thus serves as a positive control for our ability to detect signals of positive selection using a

398

different approach, which uses a likelihood ratio framework to identify regions of elevated,

399

branch-specific nucleotide substitution rates relative to a model that allows only drift (Wong &

400

Nielsen, 2004; Haygood et al., 2007; Berrio, Haygood & Wray, 2020). Consistent with this

401

expectation, we found that portions of the gene encoding Spike showed a striking elevation of

402

sequence divergence relative to the rest of the genome on the branches leading to all six species

403

examined. The specific regions of S containing high divergence differs markedly, however,

404

among species (Fig 1B). In SARS-CoV and Bat-CoV-LYRa11, these regions include the N-

405

terminal region, which contains glycosylation sites important for viral camouflage (Watanabe et

406

al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020) and a site of proteolytic cleavage that allows entry into the host cell

407

(Belouzard, Chu & Whittaker, 2009) (Fig 1C and 3A). In contrast, signals of positive selection in

408

SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 are concentrated in the domain that mediates binding to the

409

host receptor ACE2 (Fig 1C and 3A). These distinct distributions suggest that modifications in

410

different aspects of Spike function took place as various coronaviruses adapted to novel hosts. In

411

particular, the concentration of derived amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain

412

of Spike (Figs 1B and 1C) in SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 may reflect selection for

413

amino acid substitutions that result in higher affinity for ACE2 protein in different host species.

414

Importantly, we also detected signals of positive selection in two additional regions of the

415

SARS-CoV-2 genome, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16 (Fig 1A). Of

416

note, the Nsp16 region also shows a parallel signal of positive selection on the branch leading to

417

SARS-CoV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of possible adaptive change in molecular

418

function during the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the gene encoding Spike

419

protein. Prior scans for positive selection within the SARS-CoV-2 genome used elevated ω as

420

the signal of positive selection, which restricts attention to positive selection based on changes in

421

protein function. For coronaviruses this is a notable limitation, given that many aspects of the

422

lifecycle involve RNA function (Madhugiri et al., 2016; Ziv et al., 2020; Alhatlani, 2020). In

423

addition, the secondary structure of some segments within the RNA genome is well conserved

424

among coronavirus species, which implies a functional role (Rangan et al., 2020; Sanders et al.,

425

2020; Huston et al., 2020a). Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is reported to contain more well-

426

structured regions than any other known virus, including both coding and noncoding regions of

427

the genome (Huston et al., 2020a). We therefore examined nucleotide substitutions within

428

regions of putative positive selection in Nsp4 and Nsp16 for their likely impact on both protein

429

and RNA structure (Fig 4 and 5).

430

In the case of Nsp4 protein, two nearly adjacent nonsynonymous substitutions at residues 380

431

and 382 occurred on the branch leading to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3B). These both involve changing

432

side chains with similar biochemical properties, respectively valine to alanine and valine to

433

isoleucine. Homology-directed modeling of protein structure suggests that these two amino acid

434

substitutions have very little impact on either secondary or tertiary structure when comparing the

435

SARS-CoV-2 protein orthologue to those of the other species examined (Fig 4A). In the case of

436

Nsp16 protein, no nonsynonymous substitutions evolved on the branch leading to SARS-CoV-2.

437

Thus, the signal of positive selection within Nsp4 is unlikely to reflect changes in protein

438

structure or function, while the signal within Nsp16 cannot affect either because the encoded

439

polypeptide is identical.

440

With highly similar and identical protein structures predicted for Nsp4 and Nsp16, respectively,

441

we considered the possibility that the signals of positive selection instead reflect changes in RNA

442

structure and function. Previous studies found that neither the Nsp4 nor Nsp16 regions stand out

443

as particularly well folded regions of the genome, although Nsp16 does contain a single well-

444

folded region and Nsp4 two moderately well folded regions (Rangan et al., 2020; Huston et al.,

445

2020b). Further, both genes show significantly decreased sequence divergence among

446

coronavirus species within predicted double-stranded regions] (Rangan et al., 2020; Sanders et

447

al., 2020; Huston et al., 2020a). Indeed, the well-folded region within Nsp16 is the only such

448

region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that is also well conserved among related coronaviruses

449

(Sanders et al., 2020). These published observations suggest possible functional roles for folded

450

structures within Nsp4 and Nsp16. Our minimum free energy (MFE) predictions reveal that the

451

likely secondary structure of the RNA genome in the region of the Nsp4 and Nsp16 genes likely

452

differs among the six coronavirus species we examined (Fig 4B and 5B, top rows). The MFE

453

predictions also indicate differences among species in entropy across the regions containing the

454

signals of positive selection, indicating likely differences in the stability of the folded molecule

455

(Fig 4B and 5B, bottom rows). Together, these new results indicate that the folded regions of

456

Nsp4 and Nsp16 in the SARS-Cov-2 genome may differ in shape from those of related

457

coronaviruses.

458

Unfortunately, little is currently known about the molecular functions of secondary structures in

459

coronavirus genomes. Most of the attention has been directed towards the 5' UTR, 3' UTR, and

460

frameshift element at the junction between Orf1a and Orf1b, which together contain the most

461

well-folded regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Andrews et al., 2020; Sanders et al., 2020;

462

Huston et al., 2020a). Thus, it is not possible at this time to link structural and thermodynamic

463

features within Nsp4 and Nsp16 that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 to specific molecular functions.

464

As discussed above, however, published evidence suggests that RNA secondary structures within

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.300038; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

465

these regions of the genome may be functional (Rangan et al., 2020; Sanders et al., 2020; Huston

466

et al., 2020a). These functions could, in principle, affect genome or transcript function, or both.

467

Plausible possibilities include secondary structures that recruit specific RNA-binding proteins to

468

mediate transcriptional regulation or transcript processing (Pirakitikulr et al., 2016; Pan et al.,

469

2020), that mediate looping for other reasons (Gebhard, Filomatori & Gamarnik, 2011; Ziv et al.,

470

2020), or that simply facilitate or impede processivity of the replication or translation machinery

471

(MacFadden et al., 2018).

472

Conclusions

473

Scans for positive selection typically focus on changes in protein function and far less often

474

consider the possibility of adaptive change in RNA function. By shining a light on regions of the

475

SARS-CoV-2 genome that appear to be under positive selection yet are unlikely to alter protein

476

function, our results illustrate the value of evaluating the potential for adaptive changes in

477

secondary structures within the genomes of RNA viruses. In particular, we identify Nsp4 and

478

Nsp16 as regions of the SARS-Cov-2 genome that may contain mutations that contribute to the

479

unique biological and epidemiological features of this recently emerged pathogen.

480

While it is tempting to speculate about the possible adaptive role of changes in RNA structure

481

within these accelerated regions, we suggest that this is best done in the context of relevant

482

experimental results. For example, it might be informative to modify the primary sequence of the

483

genome so as to encode the same protein sequence while altering or disrupting secondary

484

structure within Nsp4 or Nsp16, then assay the consequences for viral replication and for specific

485

molecular functions. We hope that our results inspire these or other experiments aimed at better

486

understand the evolving functions of RNA secondary structure within the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
