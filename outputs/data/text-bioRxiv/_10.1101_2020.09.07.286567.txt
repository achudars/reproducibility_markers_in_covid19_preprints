Abstract

23

current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and

24

causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an

25

interaction between the receptor binding domain of its trimeric Spike glycoprotein and the human

26

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the Spike/ACE2

27

interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the

28

degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-

29

CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer

30

conformational transitions between both Spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike

31

exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the

32

SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restrains. Our findings can be of importance

33

in the development of therapeutics that block the Spike/ACE2 interaction.

1. Introduction

38

Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the current and rapidly

39

evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. One potential therapeutic target

40

receiving significant attention is the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein

41

and its receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The S glycoprotein is a

42

heavily glycosylated type I membrane protein present as a trimer on mature virions and consists

43

of three S1/S2 heterodimers [1, 2]. The S1 subunit contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) that

44

specifically binds to ACE2 and can undergo hinge-like movements to switch between an “up”

45

position for receptor binding and “down” position for potential immune evasion [1-4]. The S

46

glycoprotein can only bind to ACE2 with the RBD in the “up” state and this results in the

47

dissociation of the trimer [5, 6]. ACE2, the primary receptor for both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-

48

CoV-2 viruses [7, 8], is a type I membrane protein [9] and the soluble version of ACE2 has been

49

shown to bind both S glycoproteins and block viral entry [10]. Currently, recombinant human

50

ACE2 is being tested as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19 to decrease viral

51

replication (NCT04335136).

52
53

Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are closely related,

54

with an ~80% genomic sequence identity [11, 12]. Moreover, recent studies have also compared

55

the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, with a 76% amino acid sequence

56

identity between the two and a 74% amino acid sequence identity between their RBDs [13] which

57

directly contribute to the engagement of ACE2. Available structural and functional data reveal

58

several similarities in how both interact with ACE2: first, the contact interface of ACE2 and the

59

RBDs of the two spikes are largely similar [6], second, ACE2 binding epitopes on both RBDs are

60

inaccessible in the fully closed spike conformation [6, 14], third, effective receptor engagement

61

requires both the “up” orientation and a slight rotation of the RBD [15], and fourth, in the ACE2-

62

free condition, spike trimers on the virion surface can equilibrate between closed (3-RBD-down)

63

and open (one or more RBDs up) states [1, 2, 15, 16]. On the other hand, the existing structural

64

data for SARS-CoV-1 and the recent information that has become available in last few months

65

regarding the architecture and conformational status of the soluble or virion bound SARS-CoV-2

66

spike point toward important differences in their thermodynamics. The affinity of SARS-CoV-1 S

67

and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins for soluble monomeric ACE2 (sACE2) has been determined,

68

with the latter having a 10 to 20-fold higher binding affinity. It has been suggested that this could

69

be a critical factor explaining the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 [1, 6, 17]. Additionally,

70

recent studies have characterized the nature of the interaction between an engineered dimeric

71

ACE2-Fc fusion protein and the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, showing a high affinity

72

interaction superior to that seen with sACE2 [18, 19]. ACE2-Fc is also able to neutralize SARS-

73

CoV-2 S more efficiently than SARS-CoV-1 S [20]. In this study, we attempted to better

74

understand the interaction between sACE2 or ACE2-Fc and the trimeric membrane-bound SARS-

75

CoV-1 S or SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins by evaluating the cooperative binding of each of the

76

ligands and receptors. Our results further highlight conformational differences between the SARS-

77

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins.

2. Material and Methods

79

2.1 Plasmids

80

The plasmids expressing the different human coronavirus Spikes (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-

81

1) were previously reported [7]. The D614G mutation was introduced using the QuikChange II

82

XL site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The presence of the desired mutations was

83

determined by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmid encoding for soluble human ACE2

84

(residues 1-615) fused with an 8XHisTag was reported elsewhere [2]. To generate the recombinant

85

ACE2-Fc fusion plasmid, DNA encoding ACE2 (1-615) was linked to Fc segment of human IgG1

86

and the whole fusion fragment was cloned into pACP-tag(m)-2 vector using NheI/NotI as

87

restriction sites. The vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-encoding plasmid (pSVCMV-IN-VSV-

88

G) was previously described [21].

89
90

2.2 Cell lines

91

293T human embryonic kidney cells (obtained from ATCC) were maintained at 37°C under 5%

92

CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Wisent) containing 5% fetal bovine serum

93

(VWR) and 100 μg/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Wisent). The generation and maintenance of

94

293T-ACE2 cell line was previously reported [22].

95
96

2.3 Protein expression and purification

97

FreeStyle 293F cells (Invitrogen) were grown in FreeStyle 293F medium (Invitrogen) to a density

98

of 1 x 106 cells/mL at 37°C with 8 % CO2 with regular agitation (150 rpm). Cells were transfected

99

with a plasmid coding for soluble ACE2 or ACE2-Fc using ExpiFectamine 293 transfection

100

reagent, as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). One week later, cells were pelleted and

101

discarded. Supernatants were filtered using a 0,22 µm filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The

102

recombinant sACE2 protein was purified by nickel affinity columns (Invitrogen) and ACE2-Fc

103

was purified using Protein A affinity column (Cytiva), as directed by the manufacturers. The

104

protein preparations were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored in aliquots

105

at -80°C until further use. To assess purity, recombinant proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels

106

and stained with Coomassie Blue.

107
108

2.4 Cell surface staining and flow cytometry analysis

109

Using the standard calcium phosphate method, 10 μg of Spike expressor and 2 μg of a green

110

fluorescent protein (GFP) expressor (pIRES-GFP) were transfected into 2 × 106 293T cells. To

111

determine the Hill coefficients, cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of soluble

112

ACE2 (0 to 11500 nM), ACE2-Fc (0 to 500 nM) or the monoclonal antibody CR3022 (0 to 270

113

nM) 48h post transfection. sACE2 binding was detected using a polyclonal goat anti-ACE2 (RND

114

systems). AlexaFluor-647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L) Ab (Invitrogen) and

115

AlexaFluor-647-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) Ab (Invitrogen) were used as secondary

116

antibodies. The percentage of transfected cells (GFP+ cells) was determined by gating the living

117

cell population based on viability dye staining (Aqua Vivid, Invitrogen). Samples were acquired

118

on a LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and data analysis was

119

performed using FlowJo vX.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). Hill coefficient analyses were

120

done with using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).

2.5 Virus neutralization assay

125

Target cells were infected with single-round luciferase-expressing lentiviral particles. Briefly,

126

293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the lentiviral vector pNL4.3 R-

127

E- Luc (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and a plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike (WT or

128

D614G), SARS-CoV-1 Spike or VSV-G at a ratio of 5:4. Two days after transfection, the cell

129

supernatants were harvested. Each virus preparation was frozen and stored in aliquots at –80°C

130

until use. 293T-ACE2 target cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well

131

luminometer-compatible tissue culture plates (Perkin Elmer) 24 h before infection. Luciferase-

132

expressing recombinant viruses in a final volume of 100 μl were incubated with increasing

133

concentrations of soluble ACE2 (0 to 11500 nM), ACE2-Fc (0 to 500 nM) or the monoclonal

134

antibody CR3022 (0 to 270 nM) for 1h at 37°C and were then added to the target cells for an

135

additional 4 hours followed by incubation for 48 h at 37°C; the medium was then removed from

136

each well, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 30 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega)

137

followed by three freeze-thaw cycles. An LB 941 TriStar luminometer (Berthold Technologies)

138

was used to measure the luciferase activity of each well after the addition of 100 μl of luciferin

139

buffer (15 mM MgSO4, 15 mM KPO4 [pH 7.8], 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and 50 μl

140

of 1 mM d-luciferin potassium salt (Prolume). The neutralization half-maximal inhibitory

141

concentration (IC50) represents the ligand concentration required to inhibit 50% of the infection of

142

293T-ACE2 cells by recombinant lentiviral viruses bearing the indicated surface glycoproteins.

143

IC50 values were determined using a normalized non-linear regression using Graphpad Prism

144

software.

3. Results and Discussion

148

3.1 Differences between SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 spikes in their abilities to engage

149

sACE2, ACE2-Fc and CR3022.

150

To better understand the interaction between membrane-bound SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S

151

glycoproteins with their receptor, human ACE2, we sought to determine the cooperativity of ACE2

152

within the respective trimers. To asses this, we calculated the Hill coefficient, which is the

153

steepness of a concentration-response curve and reflects the degree of cooperativity between a

154

ligand and its receptor [23, 24]. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing

155

the full-length SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins. We also tested the SARS-CoV-

156

2 S D614G mutant that is associated with higher infectivity and is now the strain circulating

157

worldwide [25-27]. Transfected cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of sACE2 and

158

bound sACE2 was revealed with an anti-ACE2 antibody. These results were used to calculate the

159

Hill coefficient as indicated in material and methods. Both the SARS-CoV-2 S and its D614G

160

counterpart demonstrated a positive cooperativity of sACE2 binding (Hill coefficient > 1) (Figure

161

1A). Thus, indicating that the D614G mutation does not overly affect S conformation, at least

162

regarding sACE2 interaction, in line with recent findings [26, 27]. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-1 S

163

presented negative cooperativity (Hill coefficient < 1), suggesting that the interaction of sACE2

164

with one SARS-CoV-1 S protomer reduces the efficiency with which additional sACE2 molecules

165

can engage adjacent S protomers. To evaluate if the differential Hill coefficients observed between

166

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 was conserved among different RBD ligands, we tested two

167

additional RBD-binding ligands: ACE2-Fc, a molecule presenting two ACE2 domains (residues

168

1-615) fused to a Fc fragment and the CR3022 monoclonal antibody, which is specific to the

169

SARS-CoV-1 RBD and has been shown to cross-react strongly with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2

170

and does not compete with the binding of ACE2 [28, 29]. Interestingly, no differential

171

cooperativity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 was observed for ACE2-Fc, suggesting

172

that the enhanced avidity provided by ACE2-Fc which allows for multiple spike protomers to bind

173

is able to overcome potential structural restraints present in the SARS-CoV-1 S (Figure 1B). Of

174

note, we observed negative cooperativity of CR3022 for all tested S glycoproteins (Figure 1C), in

175

line with previous findings showing that the binding of CR3022 leads to the destruction of the

176

prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S trimer [30]. Thus, it is possible that the binding of CR3022 to one RBD

177

protomer distorts the trimer structure, preventing additional CR3022 molecules from binding.

178
179

3.2 Sensitivity of viruses harbouring SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 spikes to neutralization by

180

sACE2, ACE2-Fc and CR3022.

181

Next, we tested the ability of sACE2 and ACE2-Fc to neutralize SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2

182

spike bearing pseudovirions. We observed a higher neutralization potency of sACE2 against

183

SARS-CoV-2 S (wt or D614G) when compared to SARS-CoV-1 (Table 1). However, whether the

184

negative cooperativity observed for the SARS-CoV-1 S/sACE2 interaction could explain the ~5-

185

fold lower neutralization potency of monomeric ACE2 when compared to SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 =

186

245 nM for SARS-CoV-2 S; 1359 nM for SARS-CoV-1 S) (Figure 2A; Table 1) remains to be

187

determined. In agreement with previous reports [18], ACE2-Fc neutralized both SARS-CoV-1 S

188

and SARS-CoV-2 S with a higher efficiency compared to monomeric sACE2 (Figure 2B; Table

189

1), further supporting previous observations that ligand multimerization enhances potency by

190

providing higher avidity [18, 20, 31]. Interestingly, we observed that sACE2 IC50 was only reached

191

upon its half maximal binding to the respective S proteins, suggesting a model where the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.07.286567; this version posted September 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

192

occupancy of at least two or more protomers of the SARS-CoV-1 S or SARS-CoV-2 S by sACE2

193

is needed for virus neutralization (Figure 2D, E).

194
195

3.3 Proposed energy landscapes of spike trimer opening of SARS2-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.

196

Cryo-EM data collected on free (receptor-unbound) SARS-CoV-2 S indicate that it assumes 3

197

distinct states. Preferential are the 3-RBD-down state (41%) and the 1-RBD-up state (45%) that

198

exists at a near 1:1 ratio whereas less preferential is the 2-RBD-up conformation (approximately

199

10%) [1, 16, 32] . This indicates that there is a relatively low barrier for the open-closed transition

200

in its energy landscape. Consistent with this more easy-to-open propensity of the SARS-CoV-2

201

spike, Zhou. et al. has identified 15% one-ACE2-bound, 43% two-ACE2-bound, and 38% three

202

ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike by single-particle cryo-EM when mixing spike and ACE2 in a

203

1:3 molar ratio [15]. The higher percentage of the two/three-ACE2 bound state over the single

204

ACE2-bound state corroborates the positive cooperativity seen between monomeric receptor and

205

SARS-CoV-2 trimer. Interestingly, in all ACE2-bound spike trimers, RBDs not bound to ACE2

206

are in the “down” conformation, suggesting that the down-to-up rearrangement of the spike trimer

207

is the rate-limiting step in receptor binding.

208
209

In contrast, available data reveal differences in the conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-1

210

spike which seems to have less propensity to engage multiple ACE2 monomers. With a ratio of

211

1:3 (spike:ACE2), as described by Zhou et al. for the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the prevailing complex

212

fraction observed for SARS-CoV-1 was the one ACE2 monomer bound spike [33]. Interestingly,

213

the Cryo-EM structure of this complex reveled three distinct conformations of spike in which the

214

loaded RBD adopted three different tilted orientations and the other two RBDs remained in the

215

down state [33]. This is different from the multiple ACE2 loading of the SARS-CoV-2 spike which

216

displays one essentially identical RBD up conformation.

217
218

Based on the structural dynamic data described above we propose a model as shown in Figure 3.

219

According to our model, the SARS-CoV-1 spike has more structural restraints from the NTD,

220

SD1, SD2 and S2 domains and therefore needs to overcome a higher energy barrier to open. As a

221

result, the SARS-CoV-1 spike has a smaller population in the open conformation in the absence

222

of ACE2, which is in line with the unavailability of structures of multi-ACE2 bound SARS-CoV-

223

1 spikes and our finding that monomeric sACE2 binding suppresses the opening of the other two

224

RBDs. Interestingly, these differences can be detected only if monomeric ACE2 is used to form

225

the complex but not with ACE2-Fc. There is still a question of debate if ACE2 monomer or dimer

226

is involved in the entry process of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. If the latter, the

227

differences we observe for monomeric ACE2 resulting from the intrinsic structural features of the

228

two coronavirus spikes which leads to different energy landscapes could be mitigated during the

229

process of viral entry in vivo. However, whether these differences are important for antibody-

230

mediated neutralization remains to be determined.

231
232

Altogether, our results show differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between SARS-

233

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 S glycoproteins upon sACE2 binding. A better understanding of

234

conformational differences between the S glycoproteins between these two beta-coronaviruses

235

might prove useful for the development of new therapeutics and/or vaccine design.

SARS-CoV-2: red) that permit equilibration among four distinct states: all-RBD-down (“0”), one-

415

RBD-up (“1”), two-RBD-up (“2”), and three-RBD-up (“3”). We hypothesize that the SARS-CoV-

416

∗
2 spike energetic barrier for transitioning from all-RBD-down to one-RBD-up (𝐸01
) is lower for

417

SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV-1, while both experience the same barrier for the reverse

418

transition, making the one-RBD-up state more stable for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV-1, as

419

illustrated by the relative energy differences ∆𝐸01 . However, SARS-CoV-1 spike likely needs to

420

overcome substantially higher energy barrier to transit from the one-RBD-up state to the two-RBD

421

∗
-up state (𝐸12
), as compared with SARS-CoV-2 spike. This underlying conformational selection

422

mechanism results in a larger population of SARS-CoV-2 spike in two or three RBDs up state and

423

has higher chance to engage multiple ACE2, which eventually spurs the complete open and

424

dissociation of S1 from S2 and induces membrane fusion. Cartoon representation of closed, one

425

RBD up, two RBDs up states of spike were generated from deposited structures in Protein Data

426
