Abstract
Updated and revised versions of COVID-19 vaccines are vital due to genetic variations of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. Furthermore, vaccines that are safe, cost-effective, and logistically
friendly are critically needed for global equity, especially for middle to low income countries.
Recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been reported with the use
of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the prefusion spike trimers (S-2P). Recently, a new version
of prefusion spike trimers, so called “HexaPro”, has been shown for its physical property to possess
two RBD in the “up” conformation, as opposed to just one exposed RBD found in S-2P. Importantly,
this HexaPro spike antigen is more stable than S-2P, raising its feasibility for global logistics and
supply chain. Here, we report that the spike protein HexaPro offers a promising candidate for SARSCoV-2 vaccine. Mice immunized by the recombinant HexaPro adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide
using a prime-boost regimen produced high-titer neutralizing antibodies for up to 56 days after initial
immunization against live SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the level of neutralization activity is
comparable to that of convalescence sera. Our results indicate that the HexaPro subunit vaccine
confers neutralization activity in sera collected from mice receiving the prime-boost regimen.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a current global plaque. The incidence for this
pandemic reported by World Health Organization (WHO) on January, 31, 2021 has included 102
million cumulative confirmed cases and over 2.2 million deaths globally. There is an urgent need for
preventative vaccines and therapeutics. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. Its
genome encodes four structural proteins comprising of spike (S), membrane glycoprotein (M),
envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The spike protein mediates viral entry by binding to the
host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via the receptor-binding domain (RBD). This
interaction triggers a substantial conformational alteration of the spike from a prefusion conformation
to a highly stable postfusion conformation [1-4]. The spike protein can induce production of
neutralizing antibody in patients, indicating its immunogenic property. Thus, it has been widely
adopted for vaccine development. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to SARS-CoV2 spike variants with serious concerns such as D614G, N501Y, E484K, and 69/70 deletion [5-7].
Some of these variants can be highly transmissible and capable of escape vaccine-induced
neutralizing antibody responses [8].

A key strategy for vaccine design against coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has
aimed at stabilizing the metastable prefusion conformation of the spike protein homologues [9,10].
The prefusion stabilization has been achieved by two consecutive proline substitutions (S-2P) in a
turn between the central helix and heptad repeat 1 (HR1). These S-2P variants together with a Cterminus foldon trimerization domain have been shown as a superior immunogen [10]. As the
consequence, the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P has been employed in currently used vaccines including
mRNA-1273 [11], BNT162b2 [12], and ChAdOx1 [13].

In this research, we evaluated a potential COVID-19 subunit vaccine using a recently
published prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain namely HexaPro developed by McLellan and
colleagues [14]. Here we show that the HexaPro subunit vaccine administered with aluminium
hydroxide adjuvant in mice elicits strong neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2. This

finding holds a promise towards a next-generation coronavirus vaccine development using the
HexaPro spike protein.

Results
Expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro spike protein
The prefusion-stabilized HexaPro construct (Fig. 1A) encoding the spike ectodomain of
SARS-CoV-2 with proline substitution at residues 817, 892, 899, 942, 986, and 987, “GSAS”
substitution at residues 682-685 (the furin cleavage site), and C-terminal foldon trimerization motif [14]
was used to produce the HexaPro subunit vaccine in HEK293 cells. Transient transfection of
HexaPro-encoding plasmid into the cells resulted in expression of recombinant protein in culture
supernatant. The recombinant HexaPro protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography followed by
size exclusion chromatography. Purity of the purified recombinant HexaPro was ascertained by SDSPAGE (Fig. 1B). Using pooled convalescence sera from COVID-19 patients and western blot
analysis, we show that the HexaPro spike is immunogenic. To confirm the immunogenicity of the
HexaPro spike, immunofluorescence staining was then performed and validated that the spike
structural variant could be detected by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as well as by the
pooled convalescent sera (Fig. 2). These results illustrate the potential of HexaPro recombinant
protein as a subunit vaccine.

Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by sera collected from HexaPro-immunized mice
The HexaPro subunit vaccine was then evaluated for its immunization activity via
neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by immunized mouse sera. An immunization protocol of low priming
dose followed by high booster dose was followed. At day 0, C57BL/C mice were prime-immunized
with 1 µg of HexaPro adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide (100 µg) via intramuscular administration.
At day 21, the mice were boost-immunized with 5 µg of HexaPro (Fig. 3A). The microneutralization
assay using live SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells was performed with sera collected at days 14,
35 and 56 after initial immunization. At 14 days after the priming dose, a minute neutralizing activity
was observed in vaccinated mice (Fig. 3B). However, sera from vaccinated mice collected 14 days
after the booster dose elicits high neutralization titers. Furthermore, the level of neutralization activity
was sustained at least 56 days after the initial immunization (Fig. 3B). Together, our results indicate

that the HexaPro subunit vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide confers neutralization activity
in sera collected from mice receiving the prime-boost regimen.

Discussion
In this report, we observed a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity delivered by the subunit
vaccine HexaPro spike; four amino acids of which were substituted by McLellan and colleagues into
beneficial prolines leading to a more stable spike variant [14]. Specifically, the amino acid substitution
was engineered within the S2 domain of the original S-2P spike [2]. This novel prefusion variant
possesses 30% of the spike trimers being an “up” conformation with two exposed RBD as opposed to
just one exposed RBD found in S-2P. Due to its enhanced stability, the HexaPro spike has been
proposed for its potential as a COVID-19 vaccine.

Using aluminium hydroxide in vaccination has been shown to enhance activation of
inflammatory dendritic cells and T-cell responses [15-17]. In a phase 1 trial, alum was employed with
the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BBV152 [18] as well as in ongoing clinical trials of COVID-19
vaccines including subunit vaccines (NCT04522089; NCT04527575; NCT04683484; NCT04742738)
and an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (NCT0464148). In addition, we also adopted a regimen of
prime-boost immunization using low priming dose followed by high booster dose. A number of studies
and clinical trials have demonstrated that a lower priming dose, followed by a subsequent higher
booster dose can induce greater levels of immune response [19-21] including the COVID-19 vaccine
ChAdOx1 [13]. Importantly, effector cells are adversely induced by higher doses of antigen at prime
immunization. On the other hand, immune memory cells are promisingly induced by lower doses at
prime immunization making this regimen suitable for long-term immunological memory [22].

Altogether, due to its highly stable conformation, feasible production and logistic applicability,
this HexaPro spike should be further developed into a COVID-19 vaccine, and exploited for its
efficacy in viral challenge studies using different SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants. Moreover, mRNA,
DNA, and viral vector vaccines should benefit by the use of this HexaPro variant.

Ethics statement

Mouse experiments were performed under the Animal Ethics approved by Faculty of Science,
Mahidol University (MUSC63-016-524). PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n=58) were hospitalized
at Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol
University. Serum specimens were collected from patients 14 day-post infection. The study protocol
was approved by Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital.

Expression and purification of HexaPro subunit vaccine

The mammalian expression plasmid containing SARS-CoV-2 HexaPro spike was obtained
from Addgene (Addgene plasmid # 154754; http://n2t.net/addgene:154754; RRID: Addgene_154754).
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the HexaPro plasmid by calcium phosphate
transfection. Cells and culture medium were separated by centrifugation. Supernatant were
concentrated with Amicon® Ultra–15 Ultrace–30K centrifugal filter unit (MERCK). Cell protein
contents were extracted with a lysis buffer composed of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20
mm imidazole, 1X cOmpleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 mM
Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein
extracts were filtered through a 0.22 µm NalgeneTM syringe filter (Thermo ScientificTM). S HexaPro
protein was then purified with HisTrap HP (cytiva) equilibrated with a buffer composed of 50 mm
Sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Fractions containing HexaPro were pooled
and exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Purified protein was digested with HRV3C
protease to remove purification tags. The protein was further purified with Sephacryl S-300 HR (GE
Healthcare) with PBS. Fractions which contain HexaPro protein were pooled and analyzed with SDSPAGE and western blot against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (Sino Biological, Cat#40592-T62) or
pooled convalescent sera. Purified proteins are kept in -80 °C until use.

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding HexaPro using
lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Cat#L3000008). Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and were incubated
with either a polyclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (Sino Biological, Cat#40592T62) or a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (MyBioSource, Cat#MBS434277).
A goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (IgG) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, Cat#A11037) or a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (IgG) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen,
Cat#A-11029) was used for visualization under a fluorescence microscope. For convalescent serum
staining, cells were incubated with heat-inactivated serum and visualized with a goat anti-human
secondary antibody (IgG) conjugated with FITC (Abcam, Cat#ab97224).

Mouse immunization

Female C57BL/6 mice (7-9 weeks old, n = 3 per group) were ordered from Nomura Siam
International. Mice were given a prime-boost immunization intramuscularly (i.m.) spaced three weeks
apart. For antigen formulation, SARS-CoV-2 S HexaPro protein (1 µg for the first dose and 5 µg for
the booster dose) was mixed with 100 µg of aluminium hydroxide (Invivogen, Cat#vac-alu-250).
Serum was collected for analysis on study days 14, 35, and 56 after initial immunization.

Microneutralization assay

Heat-inactivated sera at 56°C for 30 minutes were two-fold serially diluted, starting with a
dilution of 1:10. The serum dilutions were mixed with equal volumes of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2.
After 1 hr of incubation at 37°C, 100 μl of the virus–serum mixture at each dilution was added in
duplicate to Vero E6 cell monolayers in a 96-well microtiter plate. The last two columns are set as
virus control, cell control, and virus back-titration. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 in a
humidified incubator. After 2 days of incubation, the medium was discarded and the cell monolayer
was fixed with cold fixative (1:1 methanol:acetone) for 20 min on ice. Viral protein in virus-infected cell
was detected by ELISA assay. The cells were washed 3 times with PBST before blocking with 2%
BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing, the viral nucleocapsid was detected using 1:5000 of

SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody (Sino Biological, Cat#40143-R001) by
incubation at 37oC for 1 h. After removal of the detection antibody, 1:2000 HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako, Denmark A/S, Cat#P0448) was added and the plate was incubated
at 37oC for 1 h. After washing, the TMB substrate (KPL, Cat#5120-0075) was added. After 10 min
incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1N HCl. Optical density (O.D.) at 450 and 620
nm was measured by a microplate reader (Tecan Sunrise).

The virus neutralization endpoint titer of each serum was calculated using the following
equation:
X = [(average A450 of virus control wells) − (average A450 of cell control wells)]/2 + (average A450 of cell control wells)

The reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum with O.D. values less than X is considered
positive for neutralization activity. Serum samples tested negative at a dilution of 1:10 were assigned
an NT titer of <10. The serum that is positive at 1:10 dilution will be reported as a NT titer of 20.

Each sample will be done in duplicate. All the experiments will be used live SARS-CoV–2
viruses at passage 3 or 4 with the Vero E6 cells at the maximum passages of 20. The activities with
live viruses are carried in a certified biosafety level 3 facility.
