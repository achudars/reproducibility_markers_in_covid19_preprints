Abstract:
In traditional systems, a single herbal formulation is often used in the treatment of
diverse diseases, including some that are newly emergent and prevalent today. We
provide here a multi-omics framework to probe the molecular basis of a
multicomponent example herb, Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) used in the treatment
of hormonal disorders and fever in Ayurveda. Cipa treated MCF7 cells exhibit
downregulation of signatures of estrogen response. 38 constituent molecules in Cipa
potentially bind (∆G< -7.5) with ERα at the same site as estrogen. Cipa transcriptome
signatures in the connectivity map exhibit positive scores with protein translation
inhibitors and knockdown signatures of genes linked to the antiviral response. This
includes the knockdown signature of RPL7, a coactivator of ESRI with a connectivity
score > 99.92. This axis was found to be upregulated in the COVID-19 patient
transcriptome. The antiviral activity through ESR1 modulation was validated in the
DENV-2 infection model. We further observed 98% inhibition of SARs-COV-2
replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. A few of its prominent
pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80%
inhibition. This study provides a novel framework for querying the molecular links
of multicomponent Ayurveda formulations and explains their use in the treatment of
disparate diseases. The novel biological targets identified here can become potential
that could be applicable to more than one viral infection, such as the use of Cipa in
dengue and COVID-19.

Introduction:
Medicinal formulations used in Ayurveda range from single to multiple herb
combinations. Besides, a single herb is used in many different disease conditions and
vice versa. Multiple active principles are present in a single herb, and these
components are postulated to target different pathways to bring about synergistic
effects. There is a recommendation to use whole formulations instead of an herb’s
active principles for maximum efficacy and to minimize drug resistance that is
commonly set in with a single molecule (1–3). There, however, remains a gap in
understanding the molecular underpinnings of whole formulations. This has
enormous utility in repurposing studies and for the therapeutic management of
diseases or pathological states. Pattern matching through a common interface of
connectivity map of molecular signatures of complex formulations generated in cell
lines have recently gained prominence in drug repurposing studies (4). Integration of

the knowledgebase of documented use with these interfaces could provide
mechanistic insights and help to uncover shared molecular pathways amongst
unrelated diseases that are treated with the same herbal formulation.
Cissampelos pareira L. (Cipa) a popular herbal medicine, has been described in
Ayurveda as a febrifuge (Jwarahara) and for balancing hormonal axis desirable in the
post-partum period and for proper lactation (stanyashodhana) (5). It is also widely
used for treating asthma, cough, skin ulcers, snakebite, and jaundice in many parts of
the world (6). Alcoholic and aqueous alcoholic extracts of CIPA have antiviral and
antimalarial activities, respectively (7, 8). However, there is limited research on
exploring whether there are shared pathways through which these extracts work in
such diverse diseases. We used an Ayurgenomics framework to explore the molecular
signatures of the whole formulation of Cipa and to probe whether there are molecular
players that connect the hormonal axis with antiviral inhibition.
In this study, we carried out a transcriptomic analysis of CIPA in MCF7 cell lines and
queried its involvement in different pathways using gene ontology tools, Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis, and probed its connectivity with drugs and other perturbagens
including gene knockdowns using L1000 (9) in CMAP. Pathways linked to lipid
metabolism, viral transcription, translation, and estrogen axis seem to be modulated
by CIPA. It also shows a high connectivity score with protein synthesis inhibitors
showing antiviral effect in in vitro studies. Besides the downregulation of ESR1, we
also obtained a high connectivity score of Cipa with a knockdown signature of a
selective estrogen receptor-alpha coactivator, RPL7 also involved in protein
translation. Docking studies of CIPA constituents to estrogen receptor alpha show a
high binding affinity of ~ 38 compounds to regions that bind known ERα modulators.
CIPA inhibits dengue virus replication in MCF7 cell lines, and ESR1 knockdown in
CIPA treated infected cells reduces this effect. RPL7 and ESR1 are significantly
upregulated in BALF samples of COVID-19 patients (10, 11). A conjoint analysis of
patient transcriptome signatures reveals a potential for repurposing CIPA in
COVID19. This was experimentally validated in inhibition of the SARS-COV-2 in vitro
by the hydro-alcoholic extract of Cipa and its pure constituents. This study, through
the integration of knowledge of network medicine in Ayurveda, and provides (a) a
unique framework for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the multicomponent
herbal formulation; (b) a method for prioritizing drug targets and lead compounds
for repurposing; (c) biological links between diseases applicable for novel conditions.

Cipa modulates estrogen receptor alpha in MCF7 cells:
Genome wide expression assay of MCF7 cells provided 93 downregulated and 131
upregulated genes at 500μg and 253 downregulated and 587 upregulated genes at
1000μg, of Cipa treatment (Supplementary file S1). Gene ontology analysis revealed
that the upregulated set had significant enrichment of transcription regulation by
RNA polymerase II, tissue development, supramolecular fiber organization etc.,
whereas the downregulated genes were enriched in lipid metabolism processes (Fig
S4).
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis provided 59 positively and 12
negatively enriched gene sets (p-value <0.05 and FDR< 5%). We observed a
significant enrichment of estrogen response gene sets in both positive and negative
enrichments (Figure 1A). ESR1 mRNA expression was observed to be downregulated
in the array that was confirmed by real-time quantitative analysis of mRNA levels in
both concentrations of Cipa (Figure 1B). Motif searches of estrogen response
elements (ERE) reveal significant enrichments in ERE density up and downregulated
genes (p value= 0.0054) in the 5KB upstream region. There is no significant difference
in Up regulated and unchanged genes pair and downregulated and unchanged gene
pair in 5 KB upstream region (Figure 1C). The regression values between fold change
and the number of ERE sites are given in the supplementary. Negative slope indicates
that more ERE sites in the 5KB upstream region have negative effects on expression.
The differentially regulated genes also include well-characterized estrogen response
genes with EREs in their promoters (Fig S5).
To investigate the atomistic detail of possible Cipa constituent binding to the Estrogen
receptor alpha, unbiased virtual screening of the constituent compounds against the
receptor was employed. This revealed four preferential locations of binding for the
61 compounds. The largest cluster (pink) comprised 38 out of the 61 Cipa
constituents, followed by the cluster of 8 (blue), 6 (orange), and 3 (green). As a
positive control, we took previously reported SERMs, namely, tamoxifen and 17-βestradiol. Our results show that both of these control molecules bind at the same
location as the largest cluster in our findings with high concurrency to the reported
binding energy (Figure 2, Table 1). Ligplot of the detailed binding sites for the
controls and top binding molecules in Fig S6.

Connectivity map analysis reveals strong positive similarity with protein
synthesis inhibitors with potential antiviral activity
A ranked gene signature of 69 down and 129 up genes was used to query the
connectivity map. At a cut-off score of 95 there were 69 positively connected small
compounds. The top-scoring compounds belonged to the class of protein translation
inhibitors e.g., emetine (99.97), cycloheximide (99.94), verrucarin-a (99.62),

cephaeline (99.84) (Figure 3A).
Emetine, homoharringtonine, anisomycin,
cephaeline, cycloheximide, and QL-XII-47 have reported antiviral activity (Table S2).
In the genetic perturbations set, 77 genes had knockdown (KD) signatures score >90,
and all were involved in translation initiation, and viral transcription (Figure 3B, Fig
S7). Since protein synthesis inhibition appears to be significant in our CMAP analysis,
we decided to explore our expression data for genes involved in translation. The
mRNA levels of the gene with the highest KD connectivity, RPL7 was downregulated
after Cipa treatment (Figure 3C). In vitro assays showed moderate inhibition of
translation in response to Cipa (Fig S8).

Cipa inhibits DENV infection in breast cancer cell lines in ESR1 dependent
manner
To see whether ESR1 modulates the antiviral activity of Cipa, we infected two cell
lines with varying estrogen receptor alpha expression, namely MDA MB 231 with
minimal expression of ESR1 and MCF7 with higher expression of ESR1 (Figure 4A)
with DENV-2 (Fig S9). Both cell lines were infected with DENV-2 at 10 MOI followed
by treatment with Cipa. We found that the dengue inhibition at both concentrations
of Cipa was higher than in MCF7 cells compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4B).
This differential inhibition could be a consequence of different cell types. Thus, to
confirm that the DENV inhibition is ESR1-dependent, we performed siRNA-mediated
knockdown of ESR1 in MCF7 cells. Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by qRT-PCR
at 48 h post transfection which showed approximately 70-80% reduction in mRNA
levels compared to that of non-targeting control (NTC) siRNA. After viral infection
and subsequent Cipa treatment we observed that the inhibitory effect of Cipa was
diminished in ESR1-knockdown compared to mock-treated cells suggesting that
DENV inhibition due to Cipa is ESR1-dependent in MCF7 cells. (Figure 4C, D).

Cipa shows repurposing potential against SARS-CoV-2 as revealed by
comparative analysis of patients’ transcriptome
Recent studies have identified small compounds such as estrogen receptor
modulators and protein translation inhibitors that could be useful against the SARSCoV-2 infections (12), suggesting a potential repurposing potential for Cipa against
the novel coronavirus.
For exploring this possibility, we compared the status of its differentially expressed
genes with that of the SARS CoV-2 patients’ from BALF transcriptome. We used the
RNA seq data previously published (9, 10) and analyzed it in-house (Supplementary
methods). We observed that ESR1 and RPL7, a coactivator of ESR1 were significantly
upregulated in the BALF samples. The connectivity map analysis of these

transcriptomes' gene signatures and comparison with Cipa results revealed many
small compounds common to both (Table S3). These overlaps suggest that Cipa may
potentially be able to modulate the novel coronavirus.

Cipa extracts inhibit the new coronavirus in vitro
We tested the effect of whole and root plant extracts of Cipa in Vero cell culture assays
infected with SARS-COV-2. The relative viral RNA (%) is calculated by considering the
values averaged from N, ORF1ab, and E genes. The whole plant hydro-alcoholic
extract (PE-50) showed a definite antiviral activity, evidenced by decreased relative
viral RNA content. Results showed that at 10 µg/ml, the relative viral % concentration
is ~16% and the maximum reduction to ~2% at 200 µg/ml compared with the viral
control. The log10 viral particle was reduced to 103.8 in the compound treated group
(200 µg/ml) than the viral infection control group 105.5 (Figure 5B).
The hydro-alcoholic extract from the root of Cipa (PER) also showed a reduction in
relative viral RNA content. The relative viral RNA % is ~4% at 50 µg/ml and ~2% at
200 µg/ml compared with the viral control. The corresponding log10 viral particle of
the compound treated group (200 µg/ml) showed 104.1 compared to the viral
infection of 105.5 (Figure 5C). The cipa aqueous extract also shows viral reduction by
57% at 100µg/ml where the viral particle number reduced from 105.9 to 105.6 (Figure
5A).

Activity of Cipa constituents in in vitro inhibition of SARS-COV-2
Since we observed that certain constituents of Cipa bind estrogen receptor alpha, we
wanted to see whether the Cipa pure constituents can inhibit SARS-COV-2. The total
alkaloid content in the extract was 46.4 mg/g with cissamine (18.6 mg/g) being the
major one, followed by magnoflorine (12.9 mg/g). The quantification of marker
compounds in the root sample (USCPR-PE-R) has been reported earlier (8). The
marker compounds are also quantified in the water extract (USCP-PE)
(supplementary methods, Fig S12). Table 2 shows the quantity of targeted
molecular marker compounds in all three extracts i.e., whole plant material
hydroalcoholic and aqueous extract, and the root hydroalcoholic extract.
The pure molecules namely hayatinin (US-50), salutaridine (US-DR-CP-2), cissamine
(US-CP-3), Pareirarine (US-CP-5), magnoflorine (US-CP-7), PE, PE50 and PER were
tested against SARS-CoV2 at 200 µM concentration showed relative viral RNA (%) to
44, 58, 45, 16, 63, 24, 2 and 2 respectively in comparison with the virus control
(Figure 6A). The structures of these molecules are shown in Fig. 6B.

Discussion:
The use of Cissampelos pareira in Ayurveda as a hormone balancing and antipyretic
formulation is widespread, recently the antiviral activity of the formulation also came
to light. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underlying such diverse activities of
Cipa remain unexplored. We built our hypothesis around the Ayurvedic knowledge of
its usage and the fact that there could be possible crosstalk between the pathways
implicated in these unrelated disorders, possibly through hormone response. We
carried out genome-wide expression profiling of MCF7 cell lines treated with CIPA to
infer their plausible mechanisms of action as well as queried the signatures in
connectivity map to infer similarities with the effect of other drugs, perturbagens, and
gene-knockouts.
Interestingly, the gene set enrichment analysis highlights an enrichment
corresponding to the upregulation of genes upon inhibition of ESR1 and response to
endocrine therapy in cancer (Figure 2A). Upon qPCR analysis, we also find a
downregulation of the ESR1 mRNA by Cipa. These results suggest that Cipa may play
a role as a modulator of ESR1. When we searched for the estrogen response elements
in the promoter region of the genes differentially expressed by Cipa, we found that
the downregulated genes were highly enriched for such elements. Excitingly, virtual
screening of the constituent drug molecules against the estrogen receptor alpha
revealed four distinct sites of binding. The possibility of multiple drug molecules
binding at the same site shows inherent redundancy in the herbal extract. This could
impart a possible beneficial role in the efficacy of Cipa and provide the synergism that
is otherwise lost in isolates. The experiment also revealed an abundance of the best
binding drugs which had comparable binding energies to previously reported
regulatory molecules. Interestingly, magniflorine, cissamine and hyatinine were
recently isolated from the hydro-ethanolic extract of Cipa shown to have
antiplasmodial effect (8). These compounds are also present in the aqueous extract
and have a competent binding energy with estrogen receptor alpha.
CMAP analysis has shown that the Cipa signature positively connects with protein
synthesis inhibitors and the knockdown signature of genes involved in translation
and ribosomal protein processing which are also enriched for viral transcription and
translation. The knockdown signature of the gene RPL7, which is a large ribosomal
protein 7 and is an ESR1 regulator (13) shows the highest positive connectivity with
the Cipa gene signature. ESR1 is also known to regulate the immune response and
estrogen regulators have been shown to possess antiviral activities (14–17). Protein
translation inhibition is a very well established first-line defense against viral
infections (18, 19). Recently, many translation inhibitors have been shown to possess
antiviral activity and many antivirals have been found to be translation inhibitors (20,
21). All kinds of viruses have been seen to involve the endoplasmic reticulum and host
translational machinery to form a membrane structure in which they reside and
7

replicate (22–24). Most interestingly, the biological pathways enriched for
differential expression also include protein modification processes in upregulated
and endoplasmic reticulum protein processing in downregulated genes. Cipa appears
to inhibit translation without inducing cell death or inducing autophagy, hence
proving to be an effective antiviral agent.
Our results so far indicate an involvement of the estrogen axis in the antiviral activity
of Cipa. Upon experimental validation we observed that Cipa induced reduction of
viral titers was markedly lower in MDA-MB-231 cells which are naturally deficient in
estrogen receptor alpha and also in MCF cells when ESR1 gene is knocked down. Thus,
signifying the effect of the estrogen axis in the antiviral action.
During our study, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has broken out and a lot of studies done
on coronaviruses have come to light. Interestingly, one of the studies on coronavirus
done after the SARS, MERS breakout (25) has shown estrogen receptor inhibitors and
protein translation inhibitors to have potential inhibitory activity. Based on our
results, Cipa appears to be both, a moderate protein synthesis inhibitor and an
estrogen receptor modulator. Many of the drugs positively connected with Cipa have
been reported to be a potential antiviral agent. Drugs such as emetine and
homoharringtonine, which show the highest positive connectivity with Cipa have
even been reported to possess potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (26–
29).
The meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 patients BALF transcriptome shows that there is
an enrichment of pathways corresponding to protein processing and endoplasmic
reticulum, protein targeting to ER, etc. in BALF, which are downregulated by Cipa.
Moreover, RPL7 and ESR1 which are upregulated in BALF are downregulated by Cipa.
Our analyses comparing the gene expression signatures of BALF with those of Cipa
show overlaps which are central for the antiviral activity of a therapeutic. Strikingly,
in vitro studies have shown that Cipa can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Both the
whole plant extracts and single chemical compounds of Cipa have shown marked
inhibition of SARS cov-2 in vitro.
Our analysis, based on the insight from Ayurvedic knowledge, seems to have opened
a large number of questions regarding the role of estrogen receptors in antiviral
activity. That a gender bias in immune response exists is well-known (30). Gender
differences, estrogen receptor modulators and signaling pathways have been
observed in various studies on the novel coronavirus 2019 (31, 32). Direct evidence
of gender bias in the outcomes of coronavirus infections have also been reported (33).
Our study suggests that this hormone balancing Ayurvedic formulation can be
considered as a potential antiviral defense strategy against the novel coronavirus. It
will be interesting to study these pathways in detail in the context of virus infections.

This study provides a novel framework for prioritizing Ayurvedic formulations for
drug repurposing and discovery of bioactive/small molecules by integrating
Ayurvedic knowledge with the transcriptomic approach to generate characteristic
gene expression signatures. Such an approach can also be utilized for varied as well
as novel diseases such as the recent pandemic.

Materials and methods:
Cell culture and Cipa treatment:
Cissampelos pareira whole plant extract was obtained commercially in lyophilized
form, from a GMP certified manufacturer. Crude water extracts were reconstructed
from powdered Cipa. Fresh extracts were prepared right before each experiment.
MCF7 (triple positive breast cancer) cell line was obtained from NCCS, Pune. It was
maintained in DMEM high glucose media, supplemented with 10% FBS,1M HEPES
and 1X antibiotic antimycotics. The cells were kept at 37˚C and 5% CO2. MycoAlert
(Cat no. LT07-318) was used to test the culture for mycoplasma.
MCF7 cells were treated with 1µg, 10µg, 100µg, 500µg and 1000µg per ml of the
aqueous extract from Cissampelos pareira L. The extract was prepared outside the
cell culture hood and then filtered using 0.22µm syringe filter before its use in cell
culture. The MCF7 cells were seeded at a confluency of 60-70% 18-24 hrs. prior to
treatment. The cells were treated with Cipa for 24 hours for each experiment. A
fresh extract was made for each set of experiments.
RNA isolation and Whole transcriptome analysis:
MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at 60-65% confluency and then treated with
vehicle, 1µg, 10µg, 100μg, 500µg and 1000µg of Cipa for 24 hours. The cells were then
trypsinized and washed with PBS. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Ambion, Cat
no. 15596026) extraction method and its integrity was checked on 1% agarose gel
which was followed by Nanodrop quantification (ND1000, Nanodrop technologies,
USA). Genome-wide transcriptome data was generated using 250µg of the total RNA
for each sample following the manufacturer's protocol. GeneChip™ (Affymetrix)
Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 cartridges were used for this experiment. HTA 2.0
chip can capture 245,349 protein coding transcripts and 40,914 non protein coding
transcripts in a 64-format. Briefly, the total RNA was prepared with poly A controls
and first strand cDNA followed by second strand cDNA were synthesized. This was
followed by in vitro transcription to form cRNA which was used as a template for the
formation of single strand cDNA or ss-cDNA. Finally, the ss-cDNA was fragmented and

labelled. At each step, purification and quantification of the samples were ensured.
Approximately 200µl of the sample, containing about 5.2µg of the labelled ss-cDNA
was loaded into the cartridges, which were then kept in the Affymetrix®
Hybridization Oven, set at 45oC and RPM 60, overnight. The cartridges were
registered on AGCC (Affymetrix® GeneChip® Command Console) and the fluidics of
the experiment (washing and staining) was done using Affymetrix® GeneChip®
Fluidics Station 450. The stained chips were then scanned using GeneChip™ Scanner
3000. The preliminary images were quality checked and .cell files were generated.
The generated CEL files were background normalized using the RMA method. Batch
effects were removed and differential gene expression analysis was done using the
limma package in R. After background correction and RMA normalization, the probes
that exceeded the p value<0.05 were annotated and analyzed for differential
expression. Since no probe could qualify the cut off at 1µg, 10µg and 100µg, the
differential gene expression was calculated using the dataset from 500µg and 1000µg
treatments with the vehicle used as control. The raw files and data have been
submitted to GEO with the accession number GSE156445.
Functional enrichment of the differentially expressed genes:
For functional analysis we used g: profiler (34) (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost).
After correcting for FDR<5%, enrichments were analyzed for GO: Molecular Function,
Cellular Compartment, Biological Processes, KEGG and Reactome.
In order to identify the specific sets of genes modulated by Cipa, we used Gene set
enrichment analysis. We carried out a pre-ranked analysis for GSEA, in which the
gene list was ordered from the highest positive gene expression to the lowest
negative gene expression. The latest versions of gene sets databases were selected for
query. Datasets with more than 500 and less than 15 genes were excluded from the
query. The output was set to a minimum cut off of p value<0.05 and corrected for
FDR<25%. An additional filter of FDR<5% was applied for identification of significant
enrichments.
ERE analysis:
Sequence of 5KB upstream region of genes were downloaded from UCSC genome
browser for Human genome GRCh38 build. ERE sites were mapped to 5KB upstream
sequence using promo tool (33) with similarity cut off value of 8.7. High ERE density
in 5KB upstream leads to down regulation of genes as per regression analysis. ERE
density’s coefficient of slope of regressed line (β = -0.0044) is negative and p-value is
significant (0.018). Pair wise ERE density comparison of differentially expressed
genes and unchanged genes was done using R software (version 3.2).

Virtual screening of CIPA ligands was performed against the estrogen receptor
crystal structure (PDBID: 3OS8) using Autodock Vina, a more accurate and faster
version of Autodock 4. The CIPA ligands available in the PubChem database were
downloaded from there, the 3D structures of the rest of the ligands were drawn using
Marvin Sketch, a computational tool for drawing 3 and 2 dimensional chemical
structures. The structures were randomized and minimized prior to docking. A blind
docking study was performed for each ligand wherein the possible search-space was
the complete receptor molecule. For each drug molecules, the docking parameters
were as follows: center_x: 9.43, center_y: 22.811, center_z : 23.418, size_x: 60, size_y:
60, size_z: 60, exhaustiveness 5000, num_modes 50000, energy_range: 20.
Furthermore, for each ligand, 50 such runs were performed and the conformation
with the minimum binding energy from among all the stable conformations of the 50
runs (a total of 1000 conformational possibilities) was selected for the cluster
analysis.
The analysis was performed using ADT, UCSF Chimera and LigPlot+.

The connectivity map dataset currently contains 1,319,138 gene expression profiles,
resulting in 473,647 signatures, generated against approximately 27,000
perturbations in 9 cell lines including MCF7, HEPG2, A549, A375, PC3, HCC515, HT29,
HA1E and VCAP. The differentially expressed genes were ranked according to fold
change and a signature of up and downregulated genes was generated. The gene
signature containing genes which were valid i.e., having a valid HGNC symbol or
Entrez ID and were also present in the LINCS gene space (represented in the L1000
data as landmark or well inferred) was used to query the connectivity map using
clue.io touchstone database.

was given for 1 hour, here the media was supplemented with 2% FBS. After 1-hour of
viral adsorption, cells were washed with PBS and DMEM high glucose with 10% FBS
with or without Cipa (50μg and 100μg) was added. DENV titers in the supernatant
were determined by plaque assay at 24 h pi. DENV plaque assay was set up in BHK21 cells. 50,000 BHK-21 cells were plated per well in 24-well plate. Serial dilutions
of virus were added in triplicates and allowed to adsorb for 1 h, followed by overlay
with 0.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC; Sigma). After 72 h, cells were fixed in 3.7%
formalin and plaques were visualized by staining with crystal violet.

1 μM concentration of siRNA targeting ESR1 gene and non-targeting control (NTC)
were mixed with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) and 1 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMax
to a total volume of 100 μl in a 24-well plate. Cells were trypsinized and volume made
up so as to contain 60,000 cells in 400 μl antibiotic-free medium. After 20 min
incubation of the transfection complex, cell suspension was added into each well.
Knockdown efficiency was determined by qRT-PCR at 48 h post transfection. Cells
were infected with DENV-2 at 48 h post transfection. Cipa was added at a
concentration of 50 µg after 1 h of viral adsorption. DENV titers were measured by
plaque assay at 24 h pi.
Cell culture, viral infection and drug treatment for inhibition of SARS-COV-2 by
Cipa:
The effect of PE50 and PER was tested against the SARS-CoV2 (35) in a 96-well tissue
culture plates that was seeded with Vero Cells 24 h prior to infection with SARS-CoV2
(Indian/a3i clade/2020 isolate) in BSL3 facility. The cells were maintained in
Dulbecco Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) containing 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS) (Gibco) at 37°C, 5% CO2. Initially the compounds were dissolved in
organic and aqueous solvents based on the requirements, and stocks were made. The
concentrations (200, 100, 50, 10, 5 (µg/mL), were made using the DMEM media.
Briefly, the cells were pre-incubated with the compounds (PE-50 & R) for 2 hours, for
each concentration in triplicate. Later, the virus inoculum (at a 0.1 MOI) was added to
the cells for 3 hours in presence of the respective dilutions of compounds made in
Basal medium only. Post-infection, viral inoculum was replaced with fresh media
containing 10% FBS and the experiment is continued in the presence of different
dilutions of compounds for 72 hours. After 72 hours, cell supernatant was collected
and spun for 10 min at 6,000 g to remove debris and the supernatant was transferred
to fresh collection tubes for further analysis.
Isolation of Viral RNA:
RNA was isolated from 200 μL of the supernatants using the MagMAXTM
Viral/Pathogen Extraction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermofisher) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The viral supernatants from the test groups were added
into the deep well plate (KingFisherTM Thermo Scientific) along with a lysis buffer
containing the following components - MagMAXTM Viral/Pathogen Binding Solution
(260μL); MVP-II Binding Beads (10 μL); MagMAXTM Viral /Pathogen Proteinase-K of
(5 μL) respectively. RNA extraction was performed using KingFisher Flex (version
1.01, Thermo Scientific) by following manufacturer's instructions. The eluted RNA
was immediately stored in -80⁰C until further use.

Co. Ltd.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The kit detects Envelope gene
(E; ROX labelled), Nucleocapsid gene (N- JOE labelled) and open reading frame 1ab
(ORF1ab, FAM labelled) specific to SARS-CoV2 for detection and amplification of the
cDNA. Briefly, RT-qPCR assays were performed on a Quant studio Q5 (Thermo fisher).
A 10 μL of Negative Control, 10 μL of Positive Control (positive and negative controls
were provided by kit), and 10 μL of extracted RNA from samples were added in
different PCR reaction tubes. The contents were centrifuged at low speed. The cycling
conditions are: Step 1: 50°C for 15 minutes, 1 cycle; Step 2: 95°C for 3 minutes, 1 cycle;
Step 3: 95°C for 5 seconds to 60°C for 40 seconds, 5 cycles; Step 4: 95°C for 5 seconds
to 60°C for 40 seconds, 40 cycles. The signals of FAM, JOE, ROX and CY5 (internal
reference) fluorescence channels were collected at 60°C. SARS-CoV-2 cDNA (Ct~28)
was used as a positive control. The log viral particles and a semi–log graph was
plotted using Graph Pad Prism 5 software (ver 5.03). The calculations for the relative
viral RNA content and log reduced viral particles was calculated using the linear
regression equation obtained using the RNA extracted from the known viral particles
by RT-qPCR, using N, E and ORF1ab genes specific to SARS CoV2 virus. from the test
samples (36).
