Abstract

36

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

37

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 and has spread globally.

38

Although Thailand has been effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19, disease

39

surveillance and information on antibody responses in infected cases and close contacts are

40

needed because there is still no specific treatment or vaccine available. We investigated 217

41

recovered COVID-19 cases to monitor their viral RNA shedding and production of antibodies

42

against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of

43

COVID-19 cases was also determined. Viral RNA was still detectable in 6.6 % of recovered

44

COVID-19 cases. The most prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding detected in this study was

45

105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.82, 88.48, and

46

83.41 % of the recovered cases 4–12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Although the

47

patients had recovered from their illness, the levels of antibodies detected showed association

48

with their symptoms during their stay in hospital. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.87 %) of

49

COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies. The presence of antibodies against SARS-

50

CoV-2 suggested that there was viral exposure among close contacts. Viral clearance and the

51

pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combatting

52

SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides additional information on the natural history of this newly

53

emerging disease related to both natural host defenses and a strategy for vaccine development.

Introduction

56

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a

57

novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The

58

disease emerged in December 2019 and has since spread globally. On March 11, 2020, the

59

World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic. Currently,

60

over 11 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, resulting in more than

61

500,000 deaths [1]. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Thailand was 3,195,

62

with 58 deaths [2]. In Thailand, the first case of COVID-19 was detected in the capital, Bangkok,

63

in mid-January 2020. During the first few months, most of the reported cases in Thailand were

64

associated with travelers who had visited other countries. However, the number of reported cases

65

increased rapidly owing to the spreading of the disease via entertainment venues and Thai boxing

66

stadiums.

67

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the

68

Coronaviridae family. It was classified as a novel betacoronavirus similar to the previously

69

identified SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle

70

East severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus) [3,4]. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the

71

binding of its spike glycoprotein to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

72

This virus can spread across species. The reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is higher

73

than that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suggesting that this novel coronavirus has a greater

74

pandemic potential [5–7]. Although the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Thailand has

75

decreased rapidly [2], the surveillance of infected cases and disease transmission is crucial for

76

disease prevention before a vaccine can be developed.

77

SARS-CoV-2-infected patients present with a wide range of symptoms, ranging from

78

mild to severe. Severe illness includes pneumonia, difficulty breathing, and respiratory failure.

79

SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals can also be asymptomatic [8].

80

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA

81

detection is widely used for the laboratory-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Antibody detection

82

has also been increasingly reported to indicate exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Although several

83

reports have suggested the combined use of antibody and viral RNA detection, real-time RT-

84

PCR is currently the method-of-choice for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis [9–11].

85

Viral RNA has been shown to be detectable in recovered patients, although the duration

86

of viral RNA shedding reported varied among infected patients. Viral RNA shedding can last at

87

least 6 weeks [12–16]. Liu et al. reported that patients with severe symptoms had a higher viral

88

load and a longer viral shedding period than patients with mild symptoms (<10 days for the

89

group with mild symptoms and >10 days for the group with severe symptoms). These authors

90

investigated viral RNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and the delta Ct values were used to

91

represent the viral load [17].

92

Antibody responses following infection can be utilized for disease diagnosis and can also

93

represent evidence of viral exposure. Detection of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-

94

CoV-2 antigens in COVID-19 have been reported. Although antibody detection is currently not

95

widely used for COVID-19 diagnosis, the presence of antibodies provides additional valuable

96

information. The presence of antibodies is indicative of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2,

97

immune clearance, and pathogenesis in infected patients. Additionally, the presence of antibodies

98

reveals the transmission of the virus to contacts.

In this study, we followed recovered COVID-19 cases using real-time RT-PCR to

100

investigate the duration of viral shedding as detected in NP swabs. Antibody detection was

101

performed to monitor antibody levels in all the recovered patients. Blood samples from

102

individuals who had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients were also collected for

103

antibody detection.

Materials and methods

106

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IRB) of the

107

Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Thailand (IRB No. M001h/63_Exp). The IRB waived the

108

need for consent because the used samples were obtained from routine preventive measures and

109

were de-identified and anonymous.

110
111

Samples and sample collection

112

Samples included in this study were collected from recovered COVID-19 patients and

113

their close contacts. The recovered COVID-19 cases recruited in this study were patients who

114

had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to hospitals or public health

115

centers under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. NP swabs and blood samples were

116

collected for the detection of viral RNA and determination of the presence of antibodies,

117

respectively. Close contacts were individuals with a history of contact with COVID-19 patients.

118

Only blood samples for antibody detection were collected from close contacts.

119

For recovered cases, the duration between the first day of symptom onset to the day of

120

sample collection was recorded. For close contacts, the duration between the last contact and

121

sample collection was noted.

122
123

Real-time RT-PCR for the detection of viral RNA

124

Real-time RT-PCR targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope

125

(E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using the LightMix Modular

126

SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene Kit (TIB MOBIOL, Synheselabor GmbH, Berlin, Germany) in a

131

Detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by enzyme-linked

132

immunoassays

133

For recovered COVID-19 cases, IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

134

were determined, whereas, for close contacts, IgG antibodies were investigated in blood samples.

135

IgM antibody levels were measured using the MAGLUMI 2000 fully automatic

136

chemiluminescent analytical system (Snibe, Shenzhen, China) according to the manufacturer’s

137

instructions. The values were reported as arbitrary unit per milliliter (AU/mL). The

138

determination of IgG and IgA antibodies was performed using an ELISA automated system

139

(Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The optical density

140

(OD) at 450 nm was measured and the ratio was calculated using the reading of each sample to

141

the reading of the calibrator. The result was obtained as a ratio between sample and cut-off OD

142

value. Sample to cut off value of > 1 was considered seropositive.

143
144

Statistical analysis

145

The association between antibody levels and clinical characteristics was analyzed using

146

the Mann–Whitney U-test and chi-square test. The difference between the number of people

147

positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in each group of close contacts was determined

148

using the chi-square test. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

150

A total of 217 recovered COVID-19 cases were recruited in this study. Based on the

151

patients’ records during their stay in hospital, the clinical manifestations of the recovered

152

COVID-19 cases were considered to be asymptomatic (4/217), mild (151/217), presenting with

153

pneumonia (59/217), and presenting with pneumonia with tracheal intubation (3/217). A total of

154

308 close contacts were included in this study. Of these, 118 were household contacts, while the

155

rest were close friends, colleagues, health care personnel who took care of the COVID-19 cases,

156

taxi drivers, neighbors, or individuals who lived or performed activities in the same community

157

as the COVID-19 cases.

158

All samples were collected from April to June 2020. Gender, age, and other information

159

relating to the recovered COVID-19 cases and close contacts gathered in this study are shown in

NP swabs could not be obtained for 5 of the 217 recovered COVID-19 cases recruited in

168

this study. Among the 212 cases whose NP swabs were collected, 14 (6.6 %) showed detectable

169

viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR. The ages of these 14 cases ranged from 16–67 years. The Ct

170

values obtained from the real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated the low amount of viral RNA left.

171

RT-PCR analysis of NP swabs from 2 of the 14 recovered cases showed Ct values of 28.43 and

172

29.61. The Ct values obtained from the NP swabs of the other 12 cases ranged between 30.22

173

and 37.74. The duration between the day of first onset and sample collection ranged from 36–

174

105 days (mean = 57 days). Our study suggested that viral RNA shedding was detectable for up

175

to 15 weeks.

176
177

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 cases

178

The levels of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples from

179

217 recovered cases were measured. Fig 1A–C depicts the analysis of the data from the

180

determination of the three antibody isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 according to the duration (in

181

weeks) of the first day of symptom onset to the day of sample collection. Among the 217 cases,

182

30 (13.82 %), 192 (88.48 %), and 181 (83.41 %) were positive for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies,

183

respectively. All 30 IgM-positive samples were also positive for IgG and IgA antibodies. In

184

addition, 150/217 (69.12 %) cases were positive for both IgG and IgA antibodies. The duration

185

between the day of the first symptom onset and blood sample collection varied from 28–142

186

days. As shown in Table 1, although only 13.82 % of recovered cases were IgM-positive, IgM

187

antibodies remained detectable for up to 2 months in some cases. IgG and IgA antibodies were

188

detectable for up to 20 weeks.

As mentioned above, COVID-19 symptoms included asymptomatic, mild, pneumonia,

the findings of this study, patient symptoms were grouped into nonpneumonia (asymptomatic

200

and mild symptoms; 155/217 cases, mean age = 34.5) and pneumonia (62/217 cases, mean age =

201

42.2) groups. The ages of cases were significantly different between the groups with and without

202

pneumonia (chi-square, p = 0.027). Moreover, when the association between antibody

203

concentrations and symptoms was analyzed, the levels of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against

204

SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in the pneumonia group than in the nonpneumonia group

shown in Fig 3A. Among the 308 close contacts, 15 (4.87 %) were positive for IgG antibodies,

218

and two of these 15 close contacts presented with respiratory symptoms. Blood samples from

219

healthy donors collected in 2018, i.e., before the emergence of COVID-19, were tested for the

220

presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. All 50 samples showed negative results.

Of the 15 IgG-positive contacts, 11 (73.33 %) were household contacts and 4 (26.67 %)

229

were colleagues and/or friends of the COVID-19 cases (Fig 3B). Our data supported that

230

household contacts represent a high-risk group for disease exposure. A total of 118 household

231

contacts were recruited in this study. Our results showed that the prevalence of viral exposure

232

among the household contacts, as evidenced by the presence of antibodies, was 9.3 % (11 out of

233

118 contacts). The prevalence of viral exposure among the other types of close contacts was 2.1

234

% or 4 out of 190 contacts (chi-square, p = 0.015).

Discussion

236

The number of cases of COVID-19 has increased rapidly worldwide since the emergence

237

of SARS-CoV-2 infection in December 2019. Laboratory diagnosis and treatments have been

238

urgently evaluated. In addition, the duration of viral RNA shedding and patterns of immune

239

responses, especially antibody production, have been studied. The report of a COVID-19 case in

240

Taiwan showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected on day 5 after disease onset. IgM

241

antibodies have also been detected on day 11, and are still detectable on day 27 [18]. Xiang et al.

242

demonstrated the dynamics of antibody responses in samples collected from COVID-19 cases at

243

3–40 days after symptom onset. The authors reported that IgM and IgG antibodies against

244

SARS-CoV-2 could be detected as early as the fourth day after symptom onset. In confirmed

245

cases, the sensitivity of the IgM and IgG tests were 77.3 and 83.3 %, respectively [19]. Nisreen

246

et al. assessed the levels of IgG and IgA antibodies in one severe and two mild cases of COVID-

247

19, and found that the concentrations of these antibodies were higher in severe cases. Samples

248

were collected between 6 and 27 days after diagnosis, and the samples from the severe case

249

showed earlier and higher seroconversion [20]. The same finding was demonstrated in MERS-

250

CoV infection [21,22]. A study on SARS-associated coronavirus showed that IgG antibodies

251

persist longer than IgA antibodies and are therefore more suitable for disease surveillance [23].

252

A different report from Finland showed that the neutralizing antibodies, IgM and IgG, could be

253

detected within 9 days of symptom onset. The antibodies were still detectable on day 20 after

254

symptom onset [24].

255

Long et. al. reported that IgG and IgM antibody concentrations were higher in severe

256

cases of COVID-19, while IgM levels decreased slightly after the third week of symptom onset.

257

This study followed up 63 patients by collecting serum at 3-day intervals, and 96.8 % of the

258

patients showed seroconversion. In addition, 26 patients who were initially negative for IgG and

259

IgM antibodies were followed up for the detection of seroconversion. The median number of

260

days for IgG and IgM seroconversion was 13 days after symptom onset. Both IgG and IgM

261

antibodies were detected in the in 9/26 samples, IgM was detected earlier than IgG in 7/26

262

patients, and later in 10/26 cases [25]. Yongchen et al. reported the longitudinal follow-up by

263

viral RNA and antibody testing of 5 severe, 11 non-severe, and 3 asymptomatic COVID-19

264

cases. Viral RNA remained detectable for 9–33 days (median = 14), 2–21 days (median = 10),

265

and 5–28 days (median = 5) in severe, non-severe, and asymptomatic cases, respectively. All

266

symptomatic patients in this study showed antibody responses. Three patients showed

267

seroconversion within the first week. Moreover, this study showed that the antibody to SARS-

268

CoV-2 was detectable for at least 6 weeks. However, only 20 % (1/5) of asymptomatic cases

269

showed an antibody response, with this one patient showing seroconversion in the third week

270

after diagnosis [26]. Zhao et al. reported the dynamics of total, IgM, and IgG antibodies against

271

SARS-CoV-2 with disease progression in 173 COVID-19 cases. Less than 40 % of the patients

272

showed detectable antibodies within the first week after symptom onset. On day 15 after disease

273

onset, 100 %, 94.3 %, and 79.8 % of cases were positive for total, IgM, and IgG antibodies,

274

respectively. IgM appeared before IgG (median time to seroconversion was 12 and 14 days,

275

respectively). This study showed that the sensitivity of IgM antibody detection was higher than

276

for IgG antibodies. Viral RNA detection showed the greatest sensitivity during the first week of

277

symptom onset. In addition, this study showed that high antibody titers were associated with the

278

worst clinical manifestations [27].

279

Close contacts of COVID-19 cases have been previously investigated. Bi et al.

280

investigated 391 COVID-19 cases and 1,286 close contacts, and showed that household contacts

Chirathaworn C et al. 16
281

and individuals who traveled with COVID-19 cases had a high risk of infection [28]. Meanwhile,

282

Guo et al. showed that the median duration of antibody detection was 5 days for IgM and IgG

283

and 14 days for IgG. In this study, samples were collected between 1–39 days after disease onset.

284

These authors also investigated four close contacts of a family with 2 COVID-19 cases, and

285

found that these 4 close contacts were asymptomatic. IgM antibodies were detected in 3 of the 4

286

close contacts, whereas IgG antibodies were undetectable [29].

287

In the current study, we demonstrated that viral shedding could still be detected in 14/212

288

(6.6 %) of the recovered COVID-19 cases. The longest duration of viral shedding shown in our

289

study was 105 days. Several reports have indicated that the antibody levels persisted for at least 6

290

weeks. We chose to follow the recovered cases to investigate the persistence of antibodies

291

against SARS-CoV-2. The IgM level, which commonly declines rapidly following infection, was

292

still detectable in 13.82 % of recovered cases. IgA, an immune component of mucosal immunity,

293

and IgG were still detectable in more than 80 % of recovered cases. It would be interesting to

294

investigate further the recovered cases whose antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were

295

undetectable.

296

We also found that high levels of antibodies were associated with disease severity.

297

Interestingly, although we investigated the antibody levels in the recovered cases, an association

298

between high antibody levels and severe cases was still observed. This suggests that patients

299

with high antibody levels could have a higher viral burden. However, there is still no clear

300

evidence to indicates that a correlation exists between the number of antibodies produced and

301

viral load. A high number of antibodies should facilitate viral clearance and alleviate disease

302

symptoms. However, the roles of the antibodies produced in COVID-19 cases remain to be

303

elucidated.

Chirathaworn C et al. 17
304

In this study, we investigated a large group of close contacts, and found that 4.8 % of

305

them displayed evidence of viral exposure. Besides, our results showed that household contact

306

represent a high-risk group for disease exposure which is essential for the prevention of disease

307

transmission.

308

In conclusion, our study provided information on COVID-19 cases after disease

309

recovery. The data suggested that further monitoring should be performed to achieve a full

310

understanding of the duration of viral clearance and antibody responses. Our study, which

311

investigated both recovered cases and close contacts, was intended to support the policy followed

312

by Thailand on the prevention of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the country. Our

313

findings regarding the high antibody response in recovered patients will be useful for the

314

recruitment of volunteers by the National Blood Center for the donation of convalescent plasma.

315

Additionally, our data are useful for the further understanding of COVID-19 transmission and

316

infection control, while our results on the patterns of antibody production and duration of

317

antibody detection may inform strategies for achieving herd immunity and as well as for vaccine

318

immunization.
