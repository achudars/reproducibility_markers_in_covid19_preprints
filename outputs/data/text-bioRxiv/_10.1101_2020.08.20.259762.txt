Abstract
CRISPR-Cas13 mediates robust transcript knockdown in human cells through direct RNA
targeting. Compared to DNA-targeting CRISPR enzymes like Cas9, RNA targeting by Cas13 is transcriptand strand-specific: It can distinguish and specifically knock-down processed transcripts, alternatively
spliced isoforms and overlapping genes, all of which frequently serve different functions. Previously, we
identified optimal design rules for RfxCas13d guide RNAs (gRNAs), and developed a computational model
to predict gRNA efficacy for all human protein-coding genes. However, there is a growing interest to target
other types of transcripts, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) or viral RNAs, and to target transcripts in
other commonly-used organisms. Here, we predicted relative Cas13-driven knock-down for gRNAs
targeting messenger RNAs and ncRNAs in six model organisms (human, mouse, zebrafish, fly, nematode
and flowering plants) and four abundant RNA virus families (SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, H1N1 influenza and
MERS). To allow for more flexible gRNA efficacy prediction, we also developed a web-based application
to predict optimal gRNAs for any RNA target entered by the user. Given the lack of Cas13 guide design
tools, we anticipate this resource will facilitate CRISPR-Cas13 RNA targeting in common model
organisms, emerging viral threats to human health, and novel RNA targets.

CRISPR-Cas13 mediates robust transcript knockdown in human cells through direct RNA
targeting1-4. Compared to DNA-targeting CRISPR enzymes like Cas9, RNA targeting by Cas13 is
transcript- and strand-specific: It can distinguish and specifically knock-down processed transcripts,
alternatively spliced isoforms and overlapping genes, all of which frequently serve different functions.
Previously, we have described a set of optimal design rules for RfxCas13d guide RNAs (gRNAs), and
developed a computational model to predict gRNA efficacy for all human protein-coding genes5. However,
there is a growing interest to target other types of transcripts, such as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)6,7 or viral
RNAs8,9, and to target transcripts in other commonly-used organisms10-13. Here, we predicted relative
Cas13-driven knock-down for gRNAs targeting messenger RNAs and ncRNAs in six model organisms
(human, mouse, zebrafish, fly, nematode and flowering plants) and four abundant RNA virus families
(SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, H1N1 influenza and MERS). To allow for more flexible gRNA efficacy prediction,
we also developed a web-based application to predict optimal Cas13d guide RNAs for any RNA target
entered by the user.
To select optimal gRNAs for transcripts produced from the reference genomes of human, mouse,
zebrafish, fly, nematode and flowering plants, we created a user-friendly Cas13 online platform
(https://cas13design.nygenome.org/) (Fig. 1a). We previously found that optimal Cas13 gRNAs depend
on specific sequence and structural features, including position-based nucleotide preferences in the gRNA
and the predicted folding energy (secondary structure) of the combined direct repeat plus gRNA5. Using
this algorithm, we pre-computed gRNA efficacies, where possible, for all mRNAs and ncRNAs with
varying transcript length for the 6 model organisms (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1).
For the scored gRNAs for each organism, we found that approximately 20% are ranked in the top
quartile (Q4 guides) for both mRNAs and ncRNAs (Fig. 1b). Remarkably, even though the nucleotide
composition can very between RNAs from different species14-16, we find a similar proportion of optimal
RfxCas13d gRNAs across all six species.
Next, we examined how many predicted high efficacy gRNAs are present, on average, in different
transcripts. To do this, we determined what fraction of the transcripts in each organism include n top-scoring

(Q4) gRNAs for values of n between 1 and 25. We found that coding sequences contained a higher number
of top-scoring gRNA per transcript across all organisms, whereas targeting the noncoding transcriptome is
more challenging and varies across different organisms (Fig. 1c). On average, we were able to find at least
25 Q4 gRNAs for >99% of coding exons in mRNAs but only 80% of ncRNAs. Beyond targeting transcripts
from the reference genomes of these model organisms, there are also many other applications of Cas13,
such as targeting transcripts from non-model organisms, cleavage of synthetic RNAs, and targeting of
transcripts carrying genetic variants not found in the reference genome. Therefore, in addition to these prescored gRNAs, we have also developed a graphical interface that allows the user to input a custom RNA
sequence for scoring and selection of optimal gRNAs.
Recently, several groups have proposed using CRISPR-Cas13 nucleases to directly target viral
RNAs8,17, which has become an area of rapid technology development due to the recent COVID-19
pandemic18. However, these approaches do not use optimized Cas13 guide RNAs. Previously, we showed
that optimal guide RNAs targeting an EGFP transgene can result in a ~10-fold increase in knock-down
efficacy compared to other gRNAs5. Therefore, to speed development of effective CRISPR-based antiviral
therapeutics, we applied our design algorithm to target SARS-CoV-2 and other serious viral threats using
Cas13d.
To ensure coverage of diverse patient isolates, we collected 7,630 sequenced SARS-CoV-2
genomes submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database from 58
countries/regions19 (Fig. 2a). Using the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolate from New York City
(USA/NY1-PV08001/2020) as a reference20, we evaluated how many individual SARS-CoV-2 genomes
each reference gRNA can target (Fig. 2b). Guide RNAs targeting protein-coding regions are mostly wellconserved across all genomes, with lower conservation in more variable regions such as Non-StructuralProtein 14 (NSP14) and Spike (S) protein. We found that gRNAs targeting in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated
regions tended to be poorly conserved, as might be expected given the lack of coding function of these
regions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Upon examination of each of the 26 SARS-CoV-2 genes, we found that
all gene transcripts could be targeted with Q4 gRNAs.

Similarly, we designed and scored all gRNAs for the coronavirus MERS and two other RNA
viruses, HIV-1 which drives Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and H1N1 pandemic influenza.
Unlike SARS-CoV-2, where a single high-efficacy (Q4) gRNA can target all genomes analyzed, we found
that at least two gRNAs are needed to target nearly all available genomes. For the highly mutagenic virus
HIV-121, we found that nine gRNAs are needed to target all available genomes (Fig. 2c). Given the
tremendous interest in viral RNA targeting using Cas13 enzymes, this dataset of optimized gRNAs provides
a platform for the development of CRISPR therapeutics for broad targeting of viral populations from diverse
patient isolates. All designed gRNAs for model organism and viral transcripts can be interactively browsed
or downloaded in bulk on the design tool website.
RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 has great potential for transcriptome perturbation and antiviral
therapeutics. In this study, we have designed and scored Cas13d gRNAs for both mRNAs and ncRNAs in
six common model organisms and identified optimized gRNAs to target virtually all sequenced viral RNAs
for SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, H1N1 influenza and MERS. We further expanded our web-based platform to
make the Cas13 gRNA design readily accessible for model organisms and created a new application to
enable gRNA prediction for user-provided target RNA sequences. Given the current lack of Cas13 guide
design tools, we anticipate this resource will greatly facilitate CRISPR-Cas13 RNA targeting in model
organisms, emerging viral threats to human health and novel RNA targets.

Methods
gRNA design for model organisms
Reference transcriptomes and corresponding annotations were obtained for each model organism:
H. sapiens (GENCODE v19, GRCh37), M. musculus (GENCODE M24, mm10), D. rerio (Ensembl v99,
GRCz11), D. melanogaster (Ensembl v99, BDGP6), C. elegans (Ensembl v99, WBcel235) and A. thaliana
(Ensembl Plants v46, TAIR10). For each organism, we performed the on-target efficiency predictions for
both mRNAs and ncRNAs using command-line RfxCas13d designer version 0.2 as previously described5.
We scored gRNAs for all RNA targets with a length of at least 80 nucleotides.

RNA virus genome collection
All full-length RNA virus genomes were downloaded on April 17th, 2020. We downloaded 7,630
complete SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes classified as high coverage and 4,237 Influenza A H1N1 viral
genomes with a complete set of eight genomic segments. SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 genomes were obtained
from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/). We also analyzed 522 MERS-CoV and 5,557 full length HIV-1
viral genomes, which were downloaded from NCBI Virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/).

gRNA design to target SARS-CoV-2
We split multi-FASTA files into single-entry FASTA files using the UCSC tool faSplit22. All
possible 23-mer gRNAs targeting individual genomes were scored with the RfxCas13 on-target model
described previously5. All scored guides were classified into four quartiles. Quartile 4 guides (or Q4) are
designated to be the predicted best-performing guides. We used USA/NY1-PV08001/2020 (refer to as NY1
isolate) for the SARS-CoV-2 reference gRNA design. Compared to the original (Wuhan) isolate, NY1
contains 3 nucleotide substitutions (G3243A, C25214T, G29027T) resulting in two amino acid mutations
(N: A252S, ORF1a: G993S). The SARS-CoV-2 transcript annotation was obtained from NCBI (GenBank:
NC_045512.2).

Prediction of minimal numbers of gRNAs to target RNA viruses
For each RNA virus, we identified a minimal set of high-scoring Q4 gRNAs that could target all
genomes collected. We used a greedy algorithm as described previously8: For each iteration, the gRNAs
with the highest number of targeting genomes are added to the set. During each iteration, if multiple gRNAs
target the same highest number of genomes, we will pick one for the minimal set and start the next iteration.
