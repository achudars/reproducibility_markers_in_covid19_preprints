Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms of immune evasion is critical for formulating an effective
response to global threats like SARS-CoV2. We have fully decoded the immune synapses for
multiple TCRs from acute patients, including cognate peptides and the presenting HLA alleles.
Furthermore, using a newly developed mammalian epitope display platform (MEDi), we
determined that several mutations present in viral isolates currently expanding across the globe,
resulted in reduced presentation by multiple HLA class II alleles, while some increased
presentation, suggesting immune evasion based on shifting MHC-II peptide presentation
landscapes. In support, we found that one of the mutations present in B1.1.7 viral strain could
cause escape from CD4 T cell recognition in this way. Given the importance of understanding
such mechanisms more broadly, we used MEDi to generate a comprehensive analysis of the
presentability of all SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the context of multiple common HLA class II
molecules. Unlike other strategies, our approach is sensitive and scalable, providing an
unbiased and affordable high-resolution map of peptide presentation capacity for any MHC-II
allele. Such information is essential to provide insight into T cell immunity across distinct HLA
haplotypes across geographic and ethnic populations. This knowledge is critical for the
development of effective T cell therapeutics not just against COVID-19, but any disease.
Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the infectious agent
responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome1,2, which caused the worldwide COVID19 pandemic with over two million fatalities. Several companies are now providing vaccines
inducing humoral and cellular responses against SARS-CoV2, but for long lasting protection,
generation of T cell memory will be required3, even if pre-existing T cell immunity to common
cold coronavirus might play a role4,5,6. Because protection by antibodies is related to protein
function (e.g. blocking receptors that are required for viral cell entry), and/or protein
localization (surface expression to allow opsonizing antibodies to bind), it has limited potential

target space increasing selection pressure for pathogen escape. Protection by T cells, on the
other hand, relies entirely on TCR recognition of pathogen-derived peptides presented by MHC
and is mostly independent of physiological function or localization of the target protein.
Consequently, while only particular epitopes of surface proteins allow targeting by neutralizing
antibodies, many peptides can serve as T cell targets, providing a much bigger epitope space
for therapeutic development. Clearly, a high-resolution map of all SARS-CoV-2 presentable
peptides resolved on different HLA alleles would greatly help these efforts.
The main approaches used currently, analysis of MHC-eluted peptides by liquid
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and in-silico prediction
algorithms, have contributed to the understanding of peptide presentation. However, they do
not provide complete presentability landscapes across many HLAs. LC-MS/MS analysis
allows the identification of thousands of naturally presented peptides, but it is technically
challenging and requires very large numbers of cells (i.e. 108 to 1010) for good coverage7,8.
Moreover, presentation of peptides for which T cell reactivity was confirmed by ELISPOT,
can be missed8. The limited sensitivity of LC-MS/MS is especially problematic when working
with small tissue samples like human biopsies. To solve this problem, dendritic cells can be
pulsed with a pathogen or protein of interest and MHC-associated peptide proteomics (MAPPs)
can be performed9. This method is particularly useful for HLA class II, but due to the
expression of multiple HLA alleles on DCs, determination of the individual restriction requires
additional experiments. Attempting to circumvent these problems, computational prediction
methods have been developed and are relatively reliable in identifying strong (IC50 < 50 nM)
MHC I-binders10. While for MHC II the algorithms are also improving11, the efficiency in
predicting MHC-binding peptides is quite variable and limited. In this respect, the recently
improved NetMHCIIpan4 shows better performance than conventional binding prediction
algorithms12, but is accurate only for a limited number of alleles, owing to the lack of suitable
peptide datasets for training. To circumvent this, a recently published study improved
algorithm performance using yeast-display peptide libraries13. Still, there is a big gap from the
several HLAs with high-quality in-silico prediction scores and the thousands of unique HLA
alleles present in the human population.
Predicting antigen presentation by MHC is further complicated by the fact that it is a
dynamic process and can change depending on the physiological state of the cell. It is also
regulated by tightly controlled chaperones like HLA-DM14, dysregulation of which has been
linked to autoimmune disease progression15,16, while high expression of HLA-DM correlated
with improved survival in cancer patients17. Thus, an unbiased method, testing pure peptide
presentation capacity of the MHC not obscured by other physiological factors, would help
getting the complete picture of all possible pMHC ligands present in a given protein. This
reductionist approach would provide a basic set of allele-specific peptides (the presentable
peptide space) ready for the generation of peptide libraries for screening of T cell reactivities
or the generation of pMHC tetramers. Taking this set as a basis, subsets of presented peptides
could be derived by incorporating protein processing and chaperone functions, dependent on
cellular state and chaperone expression levels.
In this work, we studied T cell recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by de-orphaning
TCRs from acute COVID-19 patients. We also tested the potential of mutations from SARSCoV-2 B1.1.7 strain to influence peptide presentation by utilizing a novel mammalian epitope

display system called MEDi. This platform allows unbiased, affordable testing of the
presentability of all possible peptides derived from a protein in the context of any MHC class
II allele. We describe validation experiments and use MEDi to provide a comprehensive
presentability map of all SARS-CoV-2 peptides, WT and mutated, in the context of common
HLA class II molecules. We found that several mutations resulted in reduced peptide
presentation by multiple HLA alleles, a few increased it, and one caused escape from CD4 T
cell recognition by altering peptide presentation. While further experiments are needed to fully
appreciate the biological consequences of these observations, our results suggest that immune
evasion based on shifting peptide presentation away from well recognized CD4 epitopes could
be one of them.
Given the importance of CD4 T cells in controlling B cell and CD8 T cell responses in
COVID-19 patients, the results described here may help guide the generation of vaccines or
therapeutics designed to elicit efficient cellular immunity.
Results
De-orphaning TCRs from the BAL of acute COVID-19 patients.
Although T cell SARS-CoV-2 reactivities against peptides scattered across the viral
genome have been reported, analyses that comprehensively decode “immune synapses”,
including TCR alpha and beta chain sequences, the recognized peptide and the presenting
HLA, are sparse. To overcome these limitations, we used the MCR2 technology18 (Fig.1A) and
single chain trimers19 linked to the intracellular domain of the TCR zeta chain (SCTz)20,21, to
de-orphan TCRs of enriched clonotypes from the bronchoalveolar lavages of COVID-19
patients, described recently by Liao et al22. Liao et al provided high resolution single cell data
indicating aberrant cellular responses and identified expanded T cell clonotypes, but they
neither decoded their antigenic specificity, nor the HLA restriction. To address this, we cloned
109 most enriched TCRs (supplementary data excel file S1), expressed them in a T cell line
and performed an unbiased epitope screening. This included MCR2 libraries containing all
possible 23aa SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides (1aa shifts through all proteins) and libraries
containing all possible 10aa SARS-CoV2-derived peptides presented in the context of SCTz.
This setup allowed for an unprecedented, complete screen of all SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the
context of all HLAs from every patient (Table 1). Screening these patient specific MCR2
libraries of approximately 120.000 different peptide-MCR2 combinations and 60.000 peptideSCTz combinations required at least 4 rounds of enrichment (Fig1B and not shown) before
single cell clones revealed the specific peptides and the presenting HLA alleles (Fig 1C and
not shown). As expected not all TCRs showed reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens, but
we identified the cognate peptides and the HLA restriction for 8 CD4, and 3 CD8 TCRs
(Fig.1CD).
Three CD4 T cell clones from severely affected patient C148 recognized peptides from
the immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 proteins spike (S), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), all
presented by DRB1*07:01. T cells from other patients recognized peptides presented by other
HLAs. For example, TCR091 from patient C141, reacted with several membrane glycoproteinderived peptides, all presented by DRB1*11:01 and centered around the core epitope M146-165.

In line with a high immunogenicity of this epitope, Peng et al.3 reported that 32% of patients
contained T cells that recognize an overlapping peptide M141-158. Interestingly, two of the CD4
T cell specific peptides identified in our study (S714-728 and N221-242) were mutated in the SARSCoV-2 B1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain, which rapidly spreads due to up to 70%
increased transmission rates23. We transduced reporter cells with MCR2 carrying the WT and
mutated S714-728 or N221-242 peptides (Fig.1E) and discovered that S714-728(T716I) was not
recognized by the TCR007(Fig.1F). Recognition of N221-242 peptide was unaffected by the
mutation, suggesting that Ser236 was not part of the minimal epitope (Fig.1F). We reasoned that
the T716I mutation could abrogate TCR recognition by either of two mechanisms: the mutation
might alter presentation on DRB1*07:01, or it could abolish TCR007 binding directly. To
distinguish these two possibilities and to look more broadly at SARS-CoV-2 peptide
presentation by different HLA alleles, we took advantage of our newly developed MEDi
platform described below.
MEDi, a mammalian epitope display platform based on MCR
Using the MCR system in our previous study, we identified the murine leukemia virus
envelope protein-derived mutant peptide (MLVenvS126R,D127V, aka envRV) as being the cognate
specificity of the mouse TIL-derived hybridoma, TILoma-1.418. Interestingly, while MCR2
carrying envRV was expressed well on the surface of the reporter cells, the one carrying the
nonmutated WT peptide (env) could not be detected, consistent with netMHCIIpan affinity
predictions (Fig.2A). Given that MHC molecules without a bound peptide are very unstable24,
this observation led to the hypothesis that peptides fitting well into the peptide-binding groove
and therefore being efficiently presented by the MHC, will also effectively stabilize the MCR
molecules on the surface of cells. In contrast, peptides not well presented by the MHC
destabilize the MCR2 molecules and therefore little, if any, cell surface expression will be
detected (Fig.2B). We therefore set out to test our hypothesis and cloned a number of peptides
with biochemically tested I-Ab binding affinity ranging from 7.5nM to 10,000nM (Table 2),
transduced them into our 16.2X reporter cell line, and determined the MCR2 expression by
flow cytometry and staining with I-Ab and CD3 specific antibodies (Fig.2C and not shown).
As expected from our previous study, there was a clear linear correlation between both
stainings, but CD3 allowed a better separation of the positive and negative populations
(Fig.2D). We therefore used anti-CD3 staining in all further MEDi analysis, with the added
advantage of being MHC-agnostic and therefore universally usable with all mouse H-2 and
human HLA haplotypes. We analyzed MCR2 expression dependence on peptide-I-Ab binding
affinity by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD3 staining. Consistent with our
expectations, the MCR2s carrying peptides with a good I-Ab binding affinity were expressed
on the surface at high levels, while MCR2s presenting low affinity peptides showed lower
surface expression (Fig.2E). Peptides with an affinity below 1µM (IC50) are considered good
MHC-binders and all MCRs carrying such peptides were expressed well on the cell surface. In
addition, some peptides with lower MHC binding affinity appeared on the surface, indicating
that linking peptides directly to the MHC beta chain stabilizes low-affinity peptide-MHC
interactions. Being able to test the presentation of such peptides is important, as self-peptides

known as targets in autoimmune diseases often bind MHC with low affinity25. 6 out of 6
peptides with an I-Ab binding affinity below 5µM (IC50) stabilized MCR2 surface expression,
while for peptides with lower binding affinity, MCR expression was variable and generally
much lower. Some of the MCR2s carrying peptides with an apparently low affinity (e.g.,
8.39µM) were expressed on the surface at good levels, suggesting that additional factors apart
from pure binding affinity (measured in vitro), regulate peptide-MHC interactions. Similarly,
the envRV peptide could stabilize MCR2 expression, even if its I-Ab binding affinity was
predicted by netMHCIIpan to be very low at 7.7µM and we needed to add high amounts of
envRV peptide for in-vitro T cell stimulations by dendritic cells18.
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 peptides presentability by common HLA alleles.
Considering the recent interest in SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes effectively presented
across the possibly highest number of HLA alleles, we used MEDi to determine the
presentability of all peptides encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the context of some of
the most common HLA class II haplotypes. The critical role of CD4 T cell help in supporting
B cell and CD8 T cell responses is undisputed and also crucial for COVID-19 protection26,27,28.
However, a complete picture of the important MHC class II epitopes is missing, as they are
more difficult to predict by computer algorithms than MHC class I ligands. To achieve a good
resolution, we cloned all possible 15aa peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2 genome
(Fig.3A), shifted by 1 aa, into MCR2 vectors containing extracellular domains of the HLAs:
DRB1*04:04, DRB1*07:01, DRB1*08:03, DRB1*11:01, DRB1*14:05, DRB1*15:01 and
DPA1*02:02/DPB1*05:01 (Fig.3 and not shown). We transduced these libraries into the 16.2X
reporter cell line, stained for CD3 and sorted the cells into 4 fractions (neg, low, mid and hi)
based on the surface expression level of the MCR2 (Fig.3A). We then determined the peptides
carried by the MCR2s in the different fractions by RT-PCR and deep sequencing. For each
peptide
a
MEDi
score
was
calculated
using
the
formula
sum_i[(Fr_index_i*Fr_count_i)/sum_i(Fr_count_i)] and plotted against the position of the
starting amino acid of the peptide within the protein (see Methods). Figure 3B shows plots of
the MEDi score moving average (MEDi-MA, average of 5 consecutive peptides) for the SARSCoV-2 Spike peptide presentability by a set of 5 HLA alleles. Clearly, peptides derived from
particular regions of the protein stabilize surface expression of the MCR better than others i.e.,
are being better presented by the MHC. Such peptides grouped in regions (“peaks/waves”),
indicating that a core MHC-binding epitope was present in a number of peptides starting at
several consecutive amino acids (Fig.3C,D). This observation is consistent with the fact that,
owing to its open peptide-binding groove, MHC class II molecules present peptides of different
length7. Usually the minimal MHC-binding core is composed of 9aa as shown by the
commonly described binding motifs29, even if residues outside of it also contribute to the
MHC-binding affinity30. As expected, MEDi graphs derived from these analyses showed a
diverse presentation pattern. Each HLA molecule was unique, with regions of specific and
promiscuous peptide presentation.
While the precision of this complex analysis is dependent on efficient cloning of all
peptides and sufficient numbers of cells being sorted, there may be limitation in the number of

sequencing reads per fraction and uneven coverage. To account for such data quality
differences, we introduced a MEDi-MA quality metric composed of a minimal read count and
the coefficient of variation (see M&M). From the graphs in figure 3B it is clear that the best
results were obtained for DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*15:01 and DPA1*02:02/DPB1*05:01,
while DRB1*14:05 and DRB1*08:03 showed lower quality. We therefore focused most of the
MEDi platform testing on DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*15:01.
To distill the best HLA-binding peptides from this data, we selected peptides composed
of the amino acids scoring above the 85th percentile of all peptides from a given antigen (MEDiMA85). As an example, in Table 3 we provide a list of potentially presentable peptides derived
from the Spike protein and in the supplement we extend this analysis to all peptides derived
from the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the context of 3 HLAs (supplementary data excel file S2).
Of note, the spike list contains peptides greatly overlapping with the immunogenic peptides
described in recent literature3,4.
Validation of MEDi by a competitive peptide binding assay.
Next, we analyzed peptides from the Spike protein in major MEDi-MA85 peaks for the
presence of a binding motif and indeed found an enrichment of known29, appropriately spaced
anchor residues in most of the selected peptides (Fig.4A DRB1*07:01 and Fig.S1A
DRB1*15:01), validating our assay. Still, because tethering peptides to the MCR might
stabilize some low affinity interactions not efficiently presented in vivo, we wanted to
independently validate and quantify the HLA binding of the peptides defined by MEDi. To this
end, we performed measurements of competitive peptide binding by fluorescence
polarization31 for a set of Spike peptides for DRB1*07:01. We selected 33 peptides
representing MEDi-MA peaks and 10 peptides representing valleys (Fig.4B) and considered
peptides with IC50 below 10 µM as binders. When IC50 calculation was impossible due to very
low peptide binding it was set arbitrarily to 20 µM.
20 out of the 23 peptides (87%) from the MEDi-MA85 peaks bound to the HLA with
IC50 between 85nM to 10µM (Fig.4B,C), 13 of them below 1µM. From the remaining 10 peaks,
three peptides bound to the HLA (IC50 442nM, 1630nM and 7.3µM) but missed MEDi-MA85
cut-off by a small margin (Fig.4B,C) and for the rest no binding could be shown. Of note,
confirmed HLA binding peptides contained 3 correct anchors, while the ones for which binding
could not be confirmed had fewer. For peptides from the valleys, 2 out of 10 (20%) bound to
the HLA with low affinity, while the rest did not bind (Fig.4C). This data set allowed us to
analyze the ability of the MEDi assay to qualify peptides for HLA presentation and compare it
to netMHCIIpan. We plotted receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for different
presentation IC50 cut-offs (Fig.4D). The same analysis was done using the netMHCIIpan
predicted EL rank for the same peptides (Fig.4D). Overall, the performance of both methods
was comparable, with MEDi performing better for low affinity peptides (1µM and 5µM IC50
cut-offs: AUC 87.5% to 86% and AUC 88% to 82% respectively), while netMHCIIpan was
better for the 500nM IC50 cut-off (AUC 89.8% to 80.2%).
Next, using 30 of the same peptides, we performed an unbiased analysis for
DRB1*15:01 (Fig.S1). Here, because the peptides were chosen according to MEDi data for

DRB1*07:01, most peptides corresponded to MEDi scores below the 85th percentile threshold
and were not in major peaks (FigS1AB). Therefore, they should not be well presented. Indeed,
the majority did not bind the HLA with sufficient affinity (FigS1C). Nevertheless, 10 of the
peptides were in peaks above the threshold and 7 bound to HLA. Reassuringly, the two peptides
with the highest IC50 (122nM and 241nM) corresponded to 2 of the 5 highest MEDi-MA85
peaks and were on the top of the MEDi ranking. NetMHCIIpan placed them lower at the 3rd
and 30th rank. On the other hand, 4 of 7 HLA binding peptides (IC50 from 310nM to 663nM)
missed the MEDi 85th percentile threshold. Two of them by a small margin, possibly due to
low quality data in these regions. NetMHCIIpan also did not qualify 3 of the 7 binding peptides
as good HLA binders but placed them at higher positions in the overall ranking (Fig.S1D). We
conclude that both methods perform similarly for these common HLA alleles.
These results validate the MEDi platform as a means to select peptides highly
presentable by an HLA allele. They also underscore the need for sufficient coverage in cell
numbers and sequencing depth, for the precision of MEDi.
MEDi indicates efficient presentation of immunogenic CD4 T cell epitopes
Next, we looked at the presentability of the CD4 T cell targets identified in our MCR
screens. In line with the results presented in figure 1, MEDi data indicated good presentability
of the TCR091 target peptide region by DRB1*11:01(Fig.5A and Fig.S2). Furthermore,
consistent with high reactivity among patients shown by Peng et al.3, MEDi suggested
presentability of this region by other HLA alleles like DRB1*04:04 and DRB1*15:01, and to
a lower extent by DRB1*07:01 (Fig.5A). NetMHCIIpan only predicts DRB1*11:01, but the
competitive peptide binding assay confirmed the MEDi results: DRB1*11:01 showed the
highest IC50 (236nM-561nM), followed by DRB1*04:04(1.7-9.5µM) and DRB1*15:01(3.25.4µM) and the lowest DRB1*07:01 (4.7-14µM) (Fig.5A and Fig.S2). Even if these values do
not precisely indicate differences in binding affinity, because the competing fluorescent
peptides bind the HLAs with different affinity, the results highlight the advantages of MEDi
over netMHCIIpan for discovering low-affinity peptide presentation.
Next, we analyzed MEDi scores of the other immunogenic peptides found in this study,
and compared them to netMHCIIpan predictions (Fig.5BC, indicated in red). All of the CD4 T
cell immunogenic peptides were found in the MEDi peaks, with S955-971 presented by
DPA1*02:02/DPB1*05:01 and N221-242 presented by DRB1*14:05 being uniquely identified
by MEDi. Also, 7 of the 8 peptides passed the MEDi-MA85 threshold. Only S372-393 showed a
peak with lower MEDi scores, suggesting lower affinity HLA binding. Thus, selecting all
immunogenic peptides for screening applications might require reduction of the MEDi
threshold.
Taken together, these results indicate that MEDi selected peptides are enriched for
immunogenic epitopes and that MEDi has an advantage over in-silico predictions for MHC
class II alleles, where no high-quality mass spec results or other training data are available.
MEDi also reveals candidate immune-escape mutants

These results illustrate the ability of our technology to determine presentable peptides
for different HLA alleles. We therefore used MEDi to address the presentability of the new
B1.1.7 virus-derived epitopes. As shown by the FACS analysis in figure 1E, mutations
apparently did not affect cell surface expression levels of MCR2 presenting S714-728 or N221-242.
We then systematically analyzed the effects of the B1.1.7 mutations on the presentation
capacity of several HLA alleles. We generated MCR2 libraries containing all the mutationoverlapping 15mer peptides in the context of 8 different HLA alleles and performed MEDi
analysis. As shown in figure 6, there was a notable HLA-dependent difference in B1.1.7 mutant
peptide presentability. Several mutated peptides from nucleocapsid, ORF1a and ORF8 were
inefficiently presented by DRB1*04:04, DRB1*04:01 and DPA1*02:02/DPB1*05:01
suggesting the possibility of immune escape of the virus in patients with these alleles.
Particularly interesting in this regard were mutations I2230T and Y73C which disturbed the
N-terminal hydrophobic amino acid stretches constituting a preferred binding motif for
DRB1*04:0429 (Fig 6AB). Also, the spike HV69 deletion disturbed presentation by
DRB1*07:01. The other alleles showed no difference between WT and mutated peptides, with
a few exceptions where presentability of mutated peptides was enhanced. In particular, the
spike S982A mutation appeared to stabilize binding of several peptides to DRB1*14:05,
DRB1*15:01 and DRB1*07:01.
Furthermore, while MEDi-MA scores confirmed that the 15mer S714-728(T716I) was
presented as well as the WT, they also indicated that mutated peptides starting from Asp702 to
Asn710 would be presented substantially better than WT (Fig.6C). Indeed, the T716I mutation
introduced a perfect P9 anchor residue at position 716 complementing residues Tyr707/Ser708,
Ser711 and Ala713 to form a good DRB1*07:01 binding motif (Fig.6D and 4A). Furthermore,
T716I mutation introduced additional DRB1*07:01-binding motifs potentially allowing three
different presentation registers for peptide S714-728(T716I) (Fig.6E): first, comprising a weak
HLA-binding motif starting at Ile714, with Thr716 directly accessible by the TCR; second
starting with the mutated Ile716 as a new anchor residue; and third binding motif where the
T716I mutation would presumably not be part of the minimal epitope for TCR007. Thus,
mutation T716I could abrogate TCR recognition by either of two mechanisms: it could alter
the presentation register on DRB1*07:01 (Fig.6E), or it could abolish TCR007 binding
directly.
To answer this question, we cloned 12mer peptides S714-725, S714-725(T716I) and S717-728
into the DRB1*07:01-MCR2 and cocultured MCR2+ reporter cells with TCR007 T cells. As
shown in figure 6F all constructs were expressed well with S717-728 reaching the highest levels
indicating best presentation. Intriguingly, TCR007 recognized S717-728, but not S714-725 (Fig.6G).
This indicates that T716I abrogated TCR recognition of the S714-728 15mer by altering peptide
presentation rather than by directly affecting the TCR binding epitope. Change of the
presentation register appears as the likely reason, but steric hindrance cannot be completely
excluded at this point.
These results indicate several mechanisms of peptide presentation modulation and
highlight the ability of the MEDi platform to decipher molecular details underlaying possible
viral immune escape strategies. Comprehensive analyses of the arising viral mutants, studying
the relation of presentability and immunogenicity, will be important for the development of
future therapeutics.

Discussion
Identifying the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 reactive lymphocytes is crucial for the fields
of therapeutics and vaccine development. While protection from viral infections is mostly
attributed to B cell and CD8 T cell effector functions, the balance between enabling and
restricting them decides about life and death of the host. Thus, understanding the CD4 T cell
reactivity, which orchestrates these responses, is critical.
While several methods exist to “de-orphan” TCRs32, MCR2 or SCT-based screens have
the great advantage to provide fully decoded “immune synapses”, including TCR alpha and
beta chain sequences, the recognized peptide and the presenting HLA. In this work we studied
the reactivity of 109 enriched TCRs found in the bronchoalveolar lavages of acute COVID-19
patients and precisely analyzed their peptide specificity and HLA restriction. Highlighting the
importance of CD4 T cells, we discovered that 8/47 (17.0%) of the CD4 TCRs and 3/63 (4.7%)
of the CD8-derived TCRs recognized SARS-CoV-2 peptides in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2
patients.
The appearance of mutated SARS-CoV-2 with higher transmissibility raises important
questions about the selective pressure that gave rise to the fitter variants and the role of immune
escape in their evolution. While viral escape from antibody-mediated neutralization has been
well documented for many diseases33,34, much less is known about a potential selective pressure
to evade T cell reactivity. Understanding HLA presentation and TCR recognition of mutant
and WT epitopes is critical in this regard. Recently, Redd et al35 found only one of the mutations
to overlap with CD8 epitopes and it was considered unlikely to affect TCR recognition. In this
study we found that several mutations present in the emerging SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 strain
reduced presentability of the affected peptides by several HLA class II alleles. Furthermore, a
CD4 T cell targeted 15mer peptide was affected by the spike T716I mutation and was no longer
recognized by the cognate TCR. We tested two different mechanisms of escape from CD4 T
cell recognition and found that Thr716 was not directly bound by the TCR, but that the T716I
mutation altered peptide presentation, presumably leading to presentation in a different
register. This evasion strategy would affects all T cells recognizing this peptide, so the T716I
mutation might provide a bigger advantage for the virus than appreciated so far. But how likely
is it to be relevant in vivo if it resides outside the main nonameric HLA-binding core? Previous
studies have shown the influence of so-called peptide-flanking residues (PFRs) on HLAbinding and subsequent T cell recognition36. Therefore, given the optimal peptide length for
MHC class II being 18-20 amino acids30, it is very likely that most peptides, comprising the
HLA binding core starting at Phe718, will include the Thr/Ile716 .
Methods such as detection of natural peptides eluted from MHC by mass spectrometry,
or in silico prediction, have both contributed to the understanding of peptide presentation.
However, they do not provide complete presentability landscapes across multiple alleles,
owing to the low sensitivity of mass spectroscopy and varying, often limited, accuracy of the
in-silico methods depending on the HLA allele. With MEDi, we provide an
alternative/complementary approach, in the form of a novel mammalian epitope display
platform. It is based on functional cell surface expression of the MCR2 molecules. It is HLA
agnostic thanks to the association of MCR2 with the CD3 chains and allows unbiased, fast and
affordable testing of all antigen-derived peptides for their ability to stabilize MHC(MCR2)

expression on the surface. We show proof of concept experiments, indicating that antigenic
peptides usually reside within the MEDi score high regions, provide a list of presentable SARSCoV-2 peptides for several different HLA alleles and describe different possibilities for viral
immune evasion.
Testing MEDi-MA85 selected peptides by a competitive fluorescence polarization
assay has confirmed HLA binding for most peptides. Interestingly, some of the peptides bound
the HLA with low, or very low IC50, suggesting low affinity. However, the competitive binding
assay is an in-vitro assay with recombinant HLAs and its limitations have to be also considered.
Nevertheless, it is expected that direct tethering of peptides to the HLA stabilizes low-affinity
interactions. This allows testing of such potentially short-lived peptide-HLA complexes for
presentation and T cell reactivity. The key question was whether MEDi selected peptides are
relevant in vivo. We therefore analyzed whether immunogenic epitopes correspond to MEDi
scoring peaks. Indeed, all 8 HLA class II restricted immunogenic peptides were identified by
MEDi. NetMHCIIpan missed two of them, but overall performed well for the common HLA
alleles used in this study. MEDi has the advantage of being easily scalable to the thousands of
alleles present in man, and to describe peptide presentability by patient-specific HLA alleles
for which no good training data are available. Consistently, the immunogenic spike S955-969
peptide presented by DPA1*02:02/DPB1*05:01 and N221-242 presented by DRB1*14:05, both
MEDi high, were not well predicted by netMHCIIpan. Furthermore, with MEDi we can quickly
provide the presentability information for any immunogenic peptide across multiple HLA
alleles. This is exemplified in this study by the very immunogenic membrane protein peptide
M146-165, recognized by TCR091 in the context of DRB1*11:01 and shown by MEDi to be also
presentable by several other HLAs, also not predicted by netMHCIIpan. However, the
information gained from MEDi can support further training of predictive models similar to
Rappazzo et al13.
Notably, when performing CD8 T cell screening experiments with SCTz, we realized
that, in contrast to the MCR2, SCTz fused to different peptide libraries were all expressed on
the cell surface, irrespective of correct folding (data not shown). Unfortunately, monoclonal
antibodies specifically distinguishing the native HLA conformation from the misfolded one are
not available for many alleles, precluding the broad use of SCT for MEDi-type applications at
present.
The results presented in this study validate the MEDi platform and provide insights into
the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 peptide presentation and potential escape from T
cell recognition. MEDi should help closing the gaps in peptide-presentation landscape for
thousands of HLA alleles and be useful for the development of novel therapeutical approaches
beyond prevention of COVID-19 or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Material and Methods

Cell lines, molecular cloning procedures and retroviral transduction used in this study were
described previously18

MEDi procedure and score calculation
Libraries carrying 15-amino acid (aa) long peptides, spanning the entire sequences of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, were cloned as oligonucleotides (Twist) into MCR vectors carrying
different HLA alleles. 16.2X reporter cell line was transduced with these libraries and surface
expression of the MCR molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry. Four fractions were sorted:
Fr.0 (cells expressing no detectable MCRs on the surface), Fr.1 (cells expressing low levels of
MCRs), Fr.2 (cells expressing intermediate levels of MCRs), Fr.3 (cells expressing high levels
of MCRs) – see figure 3A. Peptides carried by the MCRs from sorted cells were amplified
from cDNA by RT-PCR using the peptide flanking regions and sequenced on a miniSeq
(Illumina). Sequences from the Illumina output files were trimmed, merged and translated with
the help of the CLC genomic workbench program. Counting was done with FilemakerPro18
and all further analysis with Excel (Microsoft).
The individual peptide counts in each fraction were normalized to the total counts in the
fraction. For each peptide a MEDi score was calculated with the following formula: sum_i
[(Fr_index_i*Fr_count_i)/sum_i(Fr_count_i)]. Fr_indexes: Fr1=1, Fr2=2, Fr3=4, Fr4=28.
MEDi-MA was calculated by averaging MEDi scores for 5 peptides (-2/-1/0/1/2) and assigned
to the middle(0) peptide. MEDi-MA85 indicates the threshold calculated as the 85th percentile
of the MEDi-MA score for the individual protein.
MEDi MA score quality threshold
MEDi MA score for a given peptide was considered of good quality if at least 40 reads were
collected for a peptide and the MEDi MA value had a coefficient of variation
(CV=Std.Deviation/Average) lower than 0.75.
Local maximum of MEDi-MA peak definition
Local maximum of 7 MEDi-MA scores was determined (-3/-2/-1/0/1/2/3) and assigned to the
middle(0) peptide.
MCR2 screening
Libraries were generated by cloning all SARS-CoV2-derived peptides in MCR2 molecules
carrying the complete viral genome in 23mers shifted by 1 aa. For screening we pooled the
libraries at equal ratios, generating a combined patient-specific library of roughly 120.000
different peptide-MCR2 combinations (Table 1).
MCR2 screening was performed as described previously18. Briefly, MCR2 expressing 16.2X
cells have been co-cultured with cell clones expressing one specific TCR selected from Liao
et al. in a ratio of 1:5 to 1:10. Cells were mixed and co-cultured for 8-12 hours in a standard
tissue culture medium, in the presence of 13ug/ml anti-mouse FasL antibodies (BioXcell) to
inhibit induction of cell death during incubation. After harvesting, reporter cells positive for
NFAT signaling have been sorted on a BD FACS Aria Fusion Cell Sorter as bulk or into 96

well plates for further expansion. On average 4-5 enrichment round per TCR have been
performed before single reporter cells have been sorted. Expanded single cells were harvested,
DNA was isolated (Kapa Express Extract) followed by sanger sequencing of the MCR2 alpha
and beta chain including the linked antigen. Whenever overlapping peptides were found in the
screen (e.g fig5A), in figure 1D, we listed the common part as the specific peptide recognized
by the TCR.
Single Chain Trimer-zeta (SCTz) screening
Single chain trimers of class I HLAs of all seven patients have been generated by linking the
leader sequence, epitope, b2m and HLA alpha chain with 3 x G4S linkers and addition of the
intracellular domain from the CD247(zeta-chain) molecules. Each alpha chain was modified/
mutated to open the groove of class I by introducing the Y84A mutation in every alpha chain37.
For SCTz screening we again used libraries covering the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome with
10mers shifted by 1aa, cloned as oligonucleotides into the SCTz vectors.
Fluorescence Polarization Assay
Fluorescence Polarization Assay
The MHC II α- and β-chain extracellular domains were recombinantly expressed with Cterminal Myc and His tag sequences, respectively. For DRB1*15:01 the Myc tag was replaced
with a V5 tag. The N-terminus of the β-chain was fused to CLIP peptide followed by a flexible
Factor Xa-cleavable linker. Both α- and β-chains were co-expressed in CHO cells and secreted
into the expression medium as a stable CLIP-loaded heterodimer. Heterodimerization of the αand β-chains of DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*1501 was forced using a fusion of an engineered
human IgG1-Fc protein to each chain38. Following CHO expression, the heterodimer was
purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography
(SEC). The fluorescence polarization assay was performed as described in31 with few
modifications. Following Factor Xa cleavage, 100 nM of HLA were incubated overnight with
25 nM fluorescent probe and various concentrations of the indicated peptide competitor in 100
mM Sodium citrate pH 5.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% octylglucoside and 1x protease inhibitors
(SigmaFast) at 30° C. The fluorescent probe for DRB1*04:04, DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*11:01
was PRFV(K/Alexa488)QNTLRLAT. The fluorescent probe for DRB1*15:01
was ENPVVHFF(C/Alexa488Mal)NIVTPR.
