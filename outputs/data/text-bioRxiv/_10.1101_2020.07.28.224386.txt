Abstract
Prevailing pandemic across the world due to SARSCoV-2 drawing great attention towards discovering its evolutionary
origin. We perform an exploratory study to understand the variability of the whole coding region of possible proximal
evolutionary neighbours of SARSCoV-2. We consider seven (07) human coronavirus strains from six different species
as a candidate for our study.
First, we observe a good variability of nucleotides across candidate strains. We did not find a significant variation
of GC content across the strains for codon position first and second. However, we interestingly see huge variability of
GC-content in codon position 3rd (GC3), and pairwise mean GC-content (SARSCoV, MERSCoV), and (SARSCoV2, hCoV229E) are quite closer. While observing the relative abundance of dinucleotide feature, we find a shared
typical genetic pattern, i.e., high usage of GC and CT nucleotide pair at the first two positions (P12) of codons
and the last two positions (P23) of codons, respectively. We also observe a low abundance of CG pair that might
help in their evolution bio-process. Secondly, Considering RSCU score, we find a substantial similarity for mild class
coronaviruses,i.e., hCoVOC43, hCoVHKU1, and hCoVNL63 based on their codon hit with high RSCU value (≥ 1.5),
and minim number of codons hit (count-9) is observed for MERSCoV. We see seven codons ATT, ACT, TCT, CCT,
GTT, GCT and GGT with high RSCU value, which are common in all seven strains. These codons are mostly from
Aliphatic and Hydroxyl amino acid group. A phylogenetic tree built using RSCU feature reveals proximity among
hCoVOC43 and hCoV229E (mild). Thirdly, we perform linear regression analysis among GC content in different
codon position and ENC value. We observe a strong correlation (significant p-value) between GC2 and GC3 for
SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E and hCoVNL63, and between GC1 and GC3 for hCoV229E, hCoVNL63, SARSCoV. We
believe that our findings will help in understanding the mechanism of human coronavirus.

Coronavirus is a large enveloped virus (familyCoronaviridae, subfamily-Coronavirinae) with nonsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA
genomes [1]. Among many, six coronaviruses have
been known to infect human hosts and cause respiratory diseases. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are the most lethal coronaviruses. SARSCoV is
the first reported in China (2002) [2, 3], which causes
around two thousand deaths worldwide. MERSCoV is

reported in Saudi Arabia (2012) and South Korea (2015)
[4, 5]. In a timeline, SARSCoV-2 is the recently reported
coronavirus (2019), which provoked a large-scale epidemic, COVID-19, originated from Whung, the largest
metropolitan area in China’s Hubei province. Even then
the diseases they are responsible for are quite different.
COVID-19 has a strong infection power due to its high
dissemination rate across the worldwide. According to
WHO report 1 , more than six hundred thousand people are already dead so far (as on July 15, 2020) due
to COVID-19. All these three groups of coronaviruses
are highly pathogenic that resulted global outbreaks.
The other three human coronaviruses are Human coronavirus OC43 (hCoVOC43), Human coronavirus HKU1

(hCoVHKU1), Human coronavirus 229E (hCoV229E)
and Human coronavirus NL63 (hCoVNL63). They are
categorized as mild due to its low infection and mortally
rate.
From the genetic composition view point, the complete genome length of SARSCoV, SARSCoV-2, and
MERSCoV is approximately 27-30 kb. The genome of
SARSCoV-2 showing quite high similarity (≈ 79%) to
SARSCoV and moderate similarity (≈ 50%) to MERSCoV [6]. A number of putative coding regions are
available in SARSCoV-2 that encodes important genes
that includes nonstructural proteins such as orf1ab,
structural proteins namely spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and several accessory protein chains [7, 2, 8, 9]. The two-thirds
of the genome is at the 50 side of the sequence, encoding the nonstructural proteins, and one-third are at the 30
side encoding four structural proteins [7]. Coronavirus
proteins play diverse functional role. Nonstructural proteins can block the host innate immune response [10].
Among many structural proteins, the envelope protein
promotes viral assembly and release [11]. The spike
proteins compose the spikes on the viral surface, binds
to host receptors [11]. However, many of these sequence variability features of structural and nonstructural proteins are yet to investigate thoroughly.
The 20 standard amino acids are genetically coded
by 64 codons, including 3 stop codons for translation
termination signal [12]. Therefore, a single amino acid
are coded by multiple codons, which are called synonymous codons. The number of synonymous codons is
varying between 1 to 6. Virus genomes are differ from
each others due to frequent mutations that can prevent
the PCR primers bind to target sequences [13]. Mutation plays a key role that triggered a zoonotic virus to
jump from animal host to humans[14] host. Due to several other biological factors, such as pathogenicity the
range of target hosts also vary diversely even in closely
related strains [15, 16]. Genome-wide codon usage signature can reflect evolutionary forces [17, 17]. It has
been observed that the inter and intra-species codon usage patters are varying significantly [18] in different organisms. It is therefore genetically important to study
the nucleotide base composition in all the three positions of a codon, because nucleotide composition can
influence the codon usage and mutational bias [19, 20].
The frequency of dinucleotide feature is also important that may affect codon usage [19]. In this context,
GC content in codons may be a good indicator towards
understanding expression of viral genes while interacting inside human host cells [21, 22]. Previous studies
have demonstrated that usage of synonymous codon is

101

a non-random procedure [23, 24]. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is used to standardize
the codon usage of those amino acid encoded by multiple codons. The RSCU value is independent of the
amino acid composition and has been used widely to estimate the codon usage bias. Several studies have been
done on coronaviruses, mostly by focusing on independent genome [25, 19], different strains within the same
genome [26], and host specific adaption and proximal
origin of SARSCoV-2 virus [27, 28, 29]. The evolutionary mechanism of the SARSCoV, SARSCoV-2, MERSCoV, including its mutation rate, have been studied, although several crucial roles are yet to known, especially
SARSCoV-2 to fight with COVID19 disease. Therefore,
a comparative study on human coronaviruses might be
helpful to exploit crucial factors.
The current study have focused on comprehensive
and integrated way of analysing of all known seven
strains of human coronaviruses. Several bias indexing parameters have used such as nucleotide composition and dinucleotide odd ratio [30], synonymous codon
usage pattern [31], effective number of codon usage
[32, 33], and details are discussed in the following section.

We took all six species of known human coronaviruses, a total of seven strains as one species is divided into two different strains. Human coronaviruses
can broadly be divided into two classes based on their
produced symptoms in humans, either potentially severe
or mild. MERSCoV, SARSCoV and SARSCoV-2 are
categorized into potentially severe class. Human coronavirus OC43 (hCoVOC43), Human coronavirus HKU1
(hCoVHKU1), Human coronavirus 229E (hCoV229E)
and Human coronavirus NL63 (hCoVNL63) are categorized into mild condition class. Among, MERSCoV,
SARSCoV, SARSCoV-2, hCoVOC43, hCoV229E are
belonging to the Genus β-CoV, whereas hCoV229E and
hCoVNL63 are belonging to the Genus α-CoV.
Nucleotide sequences for each strain of length ≈ 28kb
are collected from NCBI database during April, 2020.
At first, genome wise all the partial, incomplete, and
duplicate sequence are removed. Then for each complete sequence, single coding sequences are obtained
by concatenating coding region (i.e., codons) of all
genes (that include nonstructural polyprotein: orf1ab,
structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane
(M), Nucleocapsid (N) and several accessories proteins:

2.2. Measuring indexes
Quantifying nucleotide composition- The quantity of
nucleotide base composition i.e. A, T, C and G in
different codon positions 1st/2nd/3rd can be calculated
based on frequency measure. The base composition and
GC content at first, second, and third positions of synonymously variable sense codons which can potentially
vary from 0 to 1. The nucleotide composition of any
nucleotide X at position p is calculated as follows:
fx
NX (p) =
(1)
fA + fT + fC + fG
where X ∈ {A, T, C, G}, p∈ 1, 2, 3 and fA , fT , fC , fG are
the nucleotide frequencies at particular position p for
A, T, C and G respectively.
Similarly, we calculate pair nucleotide composition
in a particular position p as follows:
f x + fy
NXY (p) =
(2)
fA + fT + fC + fG
where X, Y ∈ {A, T, C, G}, p∈ 1, 2, 3 and fA , fT , fC , fG are
the nucleotide frequencies at particular position p for A,
T, C and G respectively.
Relative dinucleotide abundance- Dinucleotide frequency is often used to determine favourable or unfavourable dinucleotide pairs. The variation in the frequency of dinucleotide pairs may affect codon usage.
The total possible dinucleotide combinations are 16.
The patterns of dinucleotide frequency indicate both
selectional and mutational pressures. Relative Dinucleotide Abundance frequency is calculated using the
following formula:
f xy
D xy =

where f x and fy represent the individual frequency
of nucleotides x and y respectively, and f x y is the frequency of dinucleotides (xy) in the same sequence. We
calculate relative dinucleotide frequency for the codon
positions first and second as well as second and third.
The ratio of the observed to expected dinucleotide frequency is known as the odds ratio. The value of the
odds ratio indicates underrepresented, if the value is below 0.78, and overrepresented, if the value is above 1.25
[30].
Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) patternRelative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is the observed number of occurrences of codons divided by that
expected if the usage of synonymous codons uniformly
[31] (Equation 4). The RSCU is used to standardize
the codon usage of those amino acid encoded by multiple codons. The RSCU value is independent of the
amino acid composition and has been used widely to
estimate the codon usage bias. The RSCU value greater
than 1.0 is considered to be a positive codon usage bias,
and the RSCU value is less than 1.0 is considered to be a
negative codon usage bias. Thus, a higher RSCU value
means that the codon is used more frequently.

where Xi is the number of occurrences of the jth codon
for the ith amino acid, which is encoded by ni synonymous codons.
Effective number of codon (ENC) usage- The effective number of codon (ENC) usage can be obtain by
Equation 5 [32, 33].

where Fi denotes the average homozygosity for the
class with i synonymous codons. The ENC value ranges
from 20 to 61. An ENC of 20 represents extreme bias
as only one codon is used for each amino acid, and a
value of 61 suggests that there is no bias. In contrast
to the RSCU value, a higher ENC value correlates to
a weaker codon usage bias. An alternate approach for
calculating the ENC is based on the GC3 content given
in Equation 6.
Nc = 2 + s + {29/[s2 + (1 − s)2 ]}

3.1. Variability of nucleotide composition
The variability of nucleotide composition is shown
by box plot in Figure 1. It is noted that strain wise

nucleotide composition significantly differs, where base
composition for the MERSCoV genome is highly diverse for all nucleotide bases. Here, we focus a few high
or low content of nucleotide composition for different
strains. We highlight each base of nucleotide content.
We observe that the content of A is high for SARSCoV2, and is low for MERSCoV and hCoVNL63; the content of T is high for hCoVHKU1 and hCoVNL63, and
is low for SARSCoV; the content of C is high for
SARSCoV and MERSCoV, and is low hCoVHKU1; the
content of G is high for hCoVOC43 and hCoV229E, and
is low for hCoVHKU1. General trends of CDSs of all
coronavirus strains are shown to be rich in A and T (≈
58-67%-), in comparison to G and C nucleotide., with
the maximum is for hCoVHKU1 and minimum is for
MERSCoV. If A is high, then T is comparatively low

and vice versa. This characteristic is similar to that of
Nipah virus [19].
3.2. Dinucleotide variability and usage pattern
Dual-nucleotide (DN) composition and its variability
are also essential as they represent the possible bonding
nature and abundance of two consecutive nucleotides
over the sequences. The occurrence of dinucleotide is
important to study that directly play a role by impact on
Codon usage bias, mutational bias and also the influence
of selective pressure and compositional constraints. In
RNA viruses, the relative abundance of dinucleotide has
shown to affect codon usage [20]. We focus on both the
first two codon position (P12) and the last two codon
position (P23) for a quantitative measure of consecutive nucleotide pair, and the observed frequency distri-

bution of nucleotide pair is shown in Figure 2. In the
present study, high abundance nucleotide pairs are AA,
GA, GT and TT for P12 as compared to high abundance
nucleotide pair AT, CT, GT and TT for P23. Among
these dinucleotides, GA and CT belong to purine and
pyrimidine group, respectively. We also observe less
variability of nucleotide pair across the strains for P23
compared to P12 (Figure 2). Overall, this indicates a
distinct pattern of nucleotide pairs in two consecutive
codon positions.
We measure the relative abundance of dinucleotide
content (odd ratio) as shown in Table 2. The top two
high and low usage dinucleotide pair is provided. Quantitatively, we observe a similar pattern for the highest
and lowest usage nucleotide pairs, which are GC and
CG, respectively, across the seven strains for P12. However, we find different structures for the second-highest
and lowest usage nucleotide pair. We also observe a
distinct arrangement of high and low usage nucleotide
pairs for P23 across the strains and that is also different
from the position P12 as stated above.

GC-content variability by the mean and standard deviation in three different positions (GC1, GC2, GC3)
for seven strains of coronavirus is shown in Table 3,
which is calculated using Eq. 2. We interestingly observe that GC3 shows high variability among seven
strains, although the GC-content for GC1 and GC2 is
much greater than that of GC3. Pairwise, mean GCcontent (SARSCoV, MSERCoV) and (SARSCoV-2,
hCoV229E) are closer. We then look the position-wise
GC-content distribution (Figure 3). It is observed that
GC-content in three codon positions is well balanced
for hCoVOC43 and SARSCoV-2 (mean difference ≈
0.9). Whereas, hCoVHKU1 and hCoVNL63 show
closer GC-content between the first and second positions of codon (mean difference ¡ 0.9), and SARSCoV,
MERSCoV and hCoV229E show closer GC-content between the second and third positions of codon (mean
difference < 0.9).

We obtain the RSCU values of 59-non trivial codons
(Eq. 4). Strains-wise, RSCU value for each codon is
shown in Table 4. RSCU value with a high score (≥ 1.5)
is highlighted for all seven strains. We observe the maximum number of codons hit (count-18) whose RSCU
value is high in three strains of mild class coronaviruses
hCoVOC43, hCoVHKU1, and hCoVNL63 and minim

number of codons hit (count-9) is observed for MERSCoV. Among the highlighted, we observe only seven
codons ATT, ACT, TCT, CCT, GTT, GCT and GGT,
which are common for all seven strains with high RSCU
value (≥ 1.5). We observe a few codons, which are
highly utilized (based on RSCU value), can be categorized into a different group of amino acids [34] (Figure 4). Such as five from Aliphatic group (A-GCT, GGGT, I-ATT, L-TTA, V-GTT), two from hydroxyl containing group (T-TCT, S-ACT), one from Basic amino
acid group (R-AGA, R- CGT) and one from Cyclic
group (P-CCT). Out of those seven highly common
usage codons, four are from Aliphatic group (I-ATT,
V-GTT, A-GCT, G-GGT), one from Cyclic group (PCCT) and one from Sulfur-containing group (T-ACT)
[34].
To understand the evolutionary mechanism, we consider RSCU values as a feature vector. We obtain average RSCU value for each codon within the multiple sequences of the same strain and obtain a strainwise 59-dimensional feature vector. We perform hierarchical clustering (dendogram) with the ’average’ linkage method, and the obtain graph is shown in Figure5.
It is observed that the severe and mild class coronaviruses are in different clades. However, hCoVOC43
and hCoV229E are very close to those of the severe
class coronaviruses. This is an indication of similar
codon usage patterns that might be a good indicator of
findings difference.
3.5. Performing correlation analysis using different indexing measure
To account for the factor that might influence the
low or high codon usage bias, we calculate ENC value
for all seven strains. We observe mean ENC value
is ranging from 36.40 (for hCoVHKU1) to 49.8 (for
MERSCoV). An ENC value greater than 45 is considered as a lower codon usage bias. We observe
mean ENC value for MERSCoV and SARSCoV is
relatively higher than that of SARSCoV-2 and other
coronaviruses. However, ENC values for mild class
coronavirus hCoVOC43 (ENC:43.794) and hCoV229E
(ENC:43.1) are much higher than that of ENC values for
hCoV229E(ENC:36.4) and hCoVNL63 (ENC:37.32).
The previous studies on SARSCoV and MERSCoV
coronaviruses have been confirmed these findings as reported in [35, 26]. Several other studies on different
viruses have shown the usage of low codon bias for
influenza A virus [36], Classical swine fever virus[37]
and high codon bias for Hepatitis A virus [38]. Further,
that might influence the low codon usage bias, and we

solid line represents the expected curve. We find all
the proportion of points lying near to the solid line on
the left region i.e. observed value was smaller than the
expected value. These findings suggest that mutational
bias might have a role in determining the codon usage

class coronaviruses is relatively low, hence low codon
usage bias. This study has also confirmed the additional
role of dinucleotide abundance for the evolution of severe class coronaviruses.
In synonymous codons, only the last nucleotide is different (except two codons of each Arginine and Serine

So, the changes of the nucleotide at the third position, it
is indicative of a mutational force only. Only when nucleotide change at the 2nd and third position of codons,
it leads to selection force. Towards understanding this
fact, we next perform a linear regression analysis for
GC-content at third i.e., GC3 with the GC-content at
first position (GC1) and the second position (GC2), and
taking both i.e., GC12. First, we show the distribution

of average GC-content for seven strains of human coronaviruses (Figure 7(a)), From the figure, we observe
various overlapping region between SARSCoV-2 and
hCoV229E, and SARSCoV and MERSCoV, identifying similar GC-content pattern. It can also observe that
position-wise distribution can varying among strains
(Figure 7(b)). GC content at the third position of codons
(GC3) is a putative indicator of the extent of base composition. Therefore, we perform a linear regression

terms of the synonymous codon usage pattern, we reported a high degree of similarity among mild class
human coronaviruses. Among severe class, a shallow
usage pattern observed for MERSCoV. These codons
mostly belong to Aliphatic and Hydroxyl amino acid
group. A phylogenetic tree built using RSCU feature
reveals proximity among hCoVOC43 and hCoV229E
(mild). We observed a strong correlation (significant p-value) between GC2 and GC3 for SARSCoV2, hCoV229E and hCoVNL63, and between GC1 and
GC3 for hCoV229E, hCoVNL63, SARSCoV. We believe that our findings will help in understanding the
mechanism of the mutation in the host and viral genes
and its consequence across the human coronavirus.

analysis, GC3 with GC12, GC1 and GC2. The neutrality plot analysis of GC3 against GC1/GC2/GC12 for
all seven strains of coronaviruses is shown in Figure 8.
The solid line in the figure represents the regression line.
The detail of the regression line with significant statistical p-value, and R2 value is shown in Table 5. The slope
of the regression line suggests that the relative neutrality (mutation pressure) for GC1/GC2/GC12 and that the
relative constraint on the GC3 (natural selection). It is
observed that there a strong correlation between GC2
and GC3 both for SARSCoV-2 (R2 = 0.96,p < 0.001)
and hCoV229E (R2 = 0.97,p < 0.001) and a moderate correlation for hCoVNL63 (R2 = 0.81,p < 0.001).
In comparing GC3 and GC1, we observe comparatively
low correlation, hCoV229E (R2 = 0.70,p < 0.001)
hCoVNL63 (R2 = 0.48,p < 0.001) and SARSCoV
(R2 = 0.37,p < 0.001). If there is a correlation between
the GC12 and GC3 that is codon bias is present at all
the codon positions, and this is likely to be due to mutational forces that influencing codon bias [39]. When
comparing GC3 with GC12, we observe strong correlation for SARSCoV-2 and hCoV229E (Table 5). Above
mentioned highlighted points, only for hCoV229E, we
observe negative correlation (GC3 Vs. GC1).

In this work, we performed an extensive analytical
and exploratory study on the genome sequence of seven
human coronavirus species. We reported significant features for all candidate coronaviruses that are common
and distinct. We observed that overall GC-content in
codon position 3rd (GC3) is playing a crucial role in
differentiating strains. We further showed that the high
usage of GC (Strong group) dinucleotide in the first
two positions of codons and CT (Week group) dinucleotide in the last two locations (P23) of codons. In
