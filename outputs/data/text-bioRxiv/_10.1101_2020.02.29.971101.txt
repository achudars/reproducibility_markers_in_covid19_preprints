Abstract
Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) has spread
more rapidly than any other betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus
5

remained unclear.
Methods: We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including
11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the
available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple
inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other

10

coronaviruses.
Results: Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed cocirculation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to
trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although
2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome

15

structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities
through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV
has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein,
which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.
Conclusions: Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and

20

spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV
may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a
cleavage site insertion.

Introduction
A new coronavirus, named the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV or SARSCoV-2), has emerged and been transmitted to the human population1.The outbreak
originating from Wuhan, China began in December of 2019 and currently has, as of Feb
5

23th, 2020, over 77,000 confirmed cases globally and over 2400 fatalities2 . The current
infection has spread outwards from China to 29 other countries or regions including South
Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States3.
Series of pneumonia cases from Wuhan linked to this virus, with symptoms such as fever,
dry cough, and dyspnea4,5. Most patients had no significant upper respiratory tract

10

symptoms, suggesting that target cells are located lower in the airway. Consequently, the
virus was isolated and sequenced from epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract5.
Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses6 that
undergo rapid mutation and recombination7,8, of its receptor binding domain (RBD) to
adapt to a large pool of species9-14. Analysis of the 2019-nCoV shows that it is a novel

15

betacoronavirus belonging to the lineage B (subgenus: sarbecovirus) which also includes
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)4. The current 2019-nCoV
genome is most phylogenetically similar to Bat/SARS/RaTG13/Yunnan strain, which was
first isolated in 2013 in Yunnan, China15. Recent studies hinted that pangolin-CoV may
be a possible intermediate hosts candidate for the 2019-nCoV16,17. Recently, this novel

20

CoV has been confirmed to use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV16.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are capable of transmitting among different host species via shifting
tropism and variable receptor targeting9-13. These characteristics are mediated by
changes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike surface glycoprotein12,14.

Similar to other well-known enveloped viruses, CoV initiates infection through fusion of
this spike protein with the host cell membrane18. Their spike protein is comprised of S1
and S2 subunits, which are responsible for host receptor recognition and membrane
fusion, respectively12,13,18,19. 2019-nCoV has recently been confirmed to use the human
5

ACE2 as receptor20.
Although the fatality rate of 2019-nCoV is lower and the symptoms are milder than
those of SARS, the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV appears to be higher7. The molecular
mechanisms responsible for such rapid transmission and spread of the 2019-nCoV still
remain elusive. Here, we have analyzed 120 2019-nCoV genome sequences including

10

11 novel strains isolated from patients to determine the viral evolution and divergence.
Our studies suggest that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor
binding domain recombination and a furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site insertion.

Results
The first cases of human-to-human 2019-nCoV infection occurred mid-December
2019, To date, the total confirmed cases and confirmed death surpassed SARS by a
magnitude within a shorter period of time1. In an attempt to associate the pathologic
5

property of 2019-nCoV with specific virulence factor, we compared the epidemiological
information with sequencing data obtained from the WHO2. We compared the rate of
infection for 2019-nCoV to that of the most recent betacoronavirus outbreaks, SARS in
November 2002 and MERS in September 2012 (Fig 1A.). 2019-nCoV appears to be
transmitted much more quickly than SARS and MERS. To date, there are more confirmed

10

2019-nCoV cases than that of the whole 2002 SARS outbreak. Coronavirus sequences
have been published frequently and consistently over the last 18 years, which included
SARS strains isolated from different countries during 2002 SARS outbreak, sporadic CoV
strains mainly reported in China, MERS strains isolated from middle east countries such
as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (Fig 1B). To further understand the evolution

15

of the betacoronaviruses and track the mutations accumulated with 2019-nCoV, we have
collected and sequenced 11 full-length 2019-nCoV genome sequences from new patients
identified in multiple Chinese cities including Wuhan (Fig 1C). The phylogenetic analysis
indicated that 11 new strains of 2019-nCoV clustered together with other 2019-nCoV
strains and were more homologous to the bat CoV RaTG13 strain than human SARS,

20

MERS and other CoVs (Fig S1A). At the amino acid levels, they only had a few random
substitutions at positions with consensus sequences identical to the corresponding amino
acid sequences in human and bat SARS (Fig S1B).

To identify novel inherited mutations, we used SARS-CoV-2 strain (EPI_ISL_402125)
as root to construct the phylogenetic tree for all 120 available complete genomes of the
novel coronavirus from GISAID (updated February 18th, 2020). Considering potential
sequencing errors at both ends, the genome sequence variations among different strains
5

of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients located in different cities were low considering only
several mutations in about 30kb genome per isolate. Based on the nucleotide positions
8517 and 27641, the 2019-nCoV strains can be divided into two major groups (Figs 2A
and S2). All the group 1 strains have thymine at 8517 and cytosine at 27641, which are
same as corresponding nucleotides in SARS, whereas the group 2 stains have cytosine

10

at 8517 and thymine at 27641 (Figs 2A and S3). Epidemiological data G1 and G2 strains
revealed that the collection date and location of the earliest G1 strain (EPI_ISL_406801)
was January 5th, 2020 in Wuhan, whereas the earliest G2 strain was isolated in December
24th, 2019 in Wuhan (Fig 2A). The existence of both genetic groups in the same city
indicated co-circulation, but evolved convergently at the early outbreak. Within each

15

group, we also observed additional shared mutations added to multiple strains. Based on
these potentially inheritable mutations and the identifying times and locations, we
generated a mutation tree map to track individual shared mutations and show the
relationships among different isolates (Fig 2A and S2). For example, five strains identified
in Guangdong from Jan. 10-15 all share the same mutation in nucleotide position 28578

20

on the background of group 1 might be transmitted by the same person. The similar strain
may transmit to three patients identified in Japan on Jan. 29-31 with additional mutation
at nucleotide position 2397 and to a patient identified in USA on Jan. 22 with additional
mutation at nucleotide position 10818. The G10818T is very interesting as it is shared by

several independent strains in both group 1 and group 2, which will lead to L3606F amino
acid substitution within the orf1ab polyprotein (Fig S3). It is not clear if the common
mutation both in group 1 and group 2 strains at 10818 site has any growth advantage but
pangolin and bat CoV have L3606V substitution at the same position (Fig S3). When the
5

group 1 and group 2 strains were placed onto geographic map (Fig 2B), it seems that
both groups have been transmitted to most countries and regions with reported 2019nCoV cases with few exceptions, suggesting these two groups are rapidly transmissible.
The most closely related strain, betacoronavirus RaTG13, was isolated from
Rhinolophus affinis15 (Fig 3A). We performed additional phylogenetic analyses using

10

nucleotide sequences for specific viral proteins such asorf1a, spike, matrix and
nucleocapsid (Fig. 3B), and found the same close relationship of the RaTG13 strain and
other bat SARS-like CoV strains. We further estimated that the divergences of most
proteins between 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 happened between 2005 and 2012 whereas
those between human SARS and bat SARS-like CoV happened between 1990-2002 (Fig

15

3B). When the full-length spike protein sequences were compared, 2019-nCoV shares
39% sequence homology to human and bat SARS as compared to MERS or other CoV
at 29%. Interestingly, we found that 2019-nCoV and pangolin-CoV share near identical
amino acid sequence in the RBD (aa 315-550 region) of the spike protein, but not for
RaTG13 (Figs 3A and 3D). To confirm this finding, we have compared the pangolin-CoV

20

reported by Liu et al with previously isolated but unpublished pangolin-CoV sequences
(Figure S4). Based on the alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we found that the

mutations and indels were found in the pangolin-CoV strains isolated in the Guangxi
province. Both BetaCoV/pangolin/Guangdong/P2S/2019 and Pangolin-CoV were
isolated from Guangdong province of China in 2019. Next we examined the phylogenetic
relationship of the consensus spike protein sequence of 2019-nCoV against 25
5

representative CoV strains including Hu-CoV, SARS and MERS and five new pangolinCoV strains using a ML method (Figure S4). The results demonstrate that the Spike
protein of 2019-nCoV is likely derived from Pangolin-CoV but not RaTG13, all of which
could be in the same lineage as BAT_SARS-CoV/bat-SL-CoVZC542. The fact that while
2019-nCoV is most homologous to RaTG13 in overall genome structure the RBD of the

10

spike protein is most homologous to Pangolin-CoV, suggests the possible recombination
between RaTG13 like and Pangolin-CoV like strains happens in the evolution of 2019nCoV. We have manually examined all amino acid mutations in the genome. Due to the
presence of the unsequenced regions in the Pangolin-CoV sequence, we did not include
any positions flanking these regions. We found that when comparing Pangolin-CoV and

15

2019-nCoV, in addition to the RBD, regions in nsp14 and 15 also shares consecutive
sequences (Fig 3D).
To further evaluate the 2019-nCoV relationship with other SARS CoVs, we analyzed
the RBM of the 2019-nCoV and different human/bat SARS viruses and observed that they
can be clearly divided into two distinct clades (Fig 4A). The clade I viruses include 2019-

20

nCoV, pangolin CoVs, 12 of bat SARS (bat SARS CoV I) such as RaTG13, and human
SARS (Table S1). The clade II viruses include 49 of bat SARS viruses (bat SARS CoV II)
such as ZXC21 and ZC45, which share about 90% overall nucleotide and amino acid
identity as the 2019-nCoV (Table S2). The major difference between these two clades is

that the RBM of the clade II viruses has regions with 5 and 13-14 amino acids shorter
than that of the clade I viruses (Fig. 4B). Previous structural analysis have demonstrated
that the 13-14 amino acid region of the SARS RBM forms a distinct loop structure, which
is stabilized with a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues9,15,16,21. Although the
5

amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV within this loop region are very different from those
of human SARS, the two cysteine residues are conserved (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, all the
CoV viruses known to use ACE2 as entry receptor are within the clade I, including the
2019-nCoV, which can also infect cells through ACE2 receptor-based on recent studies22
(Fig. S5). On the other hand, there is no report on using ACE2 as entry receptor for the

10

clade II viruses, despite their overall genome sequence homology with 2019-nCoV.
Therefore, our studies not only emphasize the critical role of the RBM in determining the
specificity of entry receptors but also raise the question on how homologous strains of
betacoronavirus switch tropism through mutations such as indel or recombination in the
RBM.

15

Our study also revealed that the 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion
(681-PRRA-684) within the spike protein, or within nucleotide position 23,619-23,632 (Fig
4C). Interestingly, such an insertion (PRRA) within the spike protein of 2019-nCoV
creates a potential cleavage site RRAR for the mammalian furin protein, which the
consensus sequence is RXXR. The potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site is inserted

20

at the boundary between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, and the first proline
residue of the PRRA insertion may introduce a beta turn into the polypeptide chain. To
understand the uniqueness of this insertion, we performed sequence comparison using
represented SARS-CoV strains from human, civet and bat. Our study showed that this

insertion is unique to the 2019-nCoV (Figure 4C and S6). When compared to other CoV
family members, we found that similar insertion has been identified and are located in the
structural boundary between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein (Figure 4C).

Discussion
The 2019-nCoV is still spreading rapidly from Wuhan to different cities in China
and other countries, at a magnitude faster than SARS and MERS4. We have
systematically analyzed and tracked the genome mutations among 120 different strains
5

of 2019-nCoV. Although most substitutions are de novo mutations, we have identified
multiple SNPs shared by different strains of 2019-nCoV. Due to the low mutation rate and
large genome capital, we hypothesis that these shared mutations are inherited SNPs from
large group of populations, likely transmitted from people to people. Based on this
assumption, we have generated the SNP tree to track mutation and spread of 2019-

10

nCoV. Interestingly, the 2019-nCoV stains we have analyzed fall into two distinct groups
with different nucleotide polymorphisms at positions 8782 and 28144. Although it remains
to be determined if these two distinct groups of 2019-nCoV were evolved before or after
transmission from animal to human, both groups were first detected in wuhan and then
spread to different regions in China and multiple countries. By combining additional

15

inheritable mutations in subsequent generations of 2019-nCoV with the times and
locations of the patient sample collections, we can trace possible viral transmission
pathways.
2019-nCoV as a member of the betacoronaviruses, shares similar genome
structures as bat SARS, human SARS, MERS with nucleotide identity over 88%, 79%,

20

about and 50%,respectively 23. Its closest relative is the Beta CoV RaTG13, isolated from
bat in Yunnan province, China, in 2013, which shares more than 96% identical
nucleotides throughout the genome of over 30 kb15,24. Our evolution clock analysis
estimated that 2019-nCoV diverged from RaTG13 and human SARS-CoV at about 12

12

and 30 years ago, respectively. Beside point mutations, there is also a potential evidence
of recombination as a mechanism for the evolution of 2019-nCoV. We found that 2019nCoV shares high identity with RaTG13 throughout the genome except for the RBD of
spike protein, which is closer to Pangolin-CoV isolated in Guangdong 17. Based on these
5

findings we hypothesized that recombination in the RBD of the spike protein may happen
between RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV like strains during the evolution of 2019-nCoV.
Bat is believed to be the original host for the 2019-nCoV but its intermediate host
before transmitting to human is not known whereas civets and camels are widely
considered as the intermediate hosts for human SARS and MERS, respectively22,25-27.

10

Human SARS viruses are known to use the ACE2 while MERS use DPP4 as their
receptors to infect host cells16,28. Recent studies have indicated ACE2 as the entry
receptor for 2019-nCoV
involved

30

29

although other host cell factors such as TMPRSS2 are likely

. When we used the receptor binding motifs to conduct phylogenic analysis,

we could separate 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS into two distinct clades.
15

Interestingly, all the viruses known to use ACE2 as the entry receptor are within the clade
I whereas all the bat SARS viruses which do not use ACE2 entry receptors belong to
clade II. Therefore, we predict that the clade I CoV viruses including the 2019-nCoV can
while clade II CoV cannot infect host cells through ACE2. Based on the available genome
sequences, there are many more clade II bat CoV (over 49 stains) than clade I bat CoV

20

(about 12 strains). Some of the clade II bat CoV such as ZXC21 and ZC45 are more
homologous to the 2019-nCoV than the clade I bat CoV and human SARS. It would be
interesting to find out if homologous betacoronavirus can switch tropism through
recombination in the RBM.

We have also identified a unique four amino acid (PRRA) insertion between S1
and S2 domains of the spike protein, which may function as a furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage
site. It has been shown that CoV may undergo a protease cleavage to trigger the viruscell membrane fusion10,14. This flexibility in priming and triggering the fusion machinery
5

greatly modulates the viral pathogenicity and tropism of different coronaviruses18,19.
However, such protease cleavage has not been detected in SARS-CoV19. Introducing a
cleavage site into SARS-CoV resulted in spike protein cleavage and potentiated the
membrane fusion activity11. In addition, introducing a cleaved spike protein into a SARSCoV pseudotype virus allowed it to directly enter host cells31. Based on previous

10

sequencing and structural analysis, the 2019-nCoV spike protein were predicted to
interact with the ACE2 receptor to trigger the fusion with the host cell membrane and
initiate infection

29

. Therefore, mutations or indels altering the S1-S2 subunits should

significantly impact viral infection. We hypothesize that the PRRA insertion may render
the spike protein to cleavage process, which triggers the viral fusion event.
15

Although the exact mechanisms responsible for such a high infection rates remains
to be further investigated, our data on both recombination in the RBD and the unique furin
or TMPRSS2 cleavage site insertion between the S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein
may explain why the transmission of this newly emerged virus is significantly increased
compared to the related beta-coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS. Further tracking

20

the genome mutations with additional strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients in
different locations at different time points will provide insights to understand the molecular
evolution of this rapid spreading viruses.

More importantly, comparison of protein

sequence and structural differences between 2019-nCoV and other beta coronaviruses

will provide insights to rapidly develop novel strategies to treat or prevent diseases
associated with the novel emerging infectious viruses.

Experimental Procedures
Patients and samples.
The whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from 11 samples were generated by a
combination of Sanger, Illumina, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. First, viral RNAs were
5

extracted directly from clinical samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and then
used to synthesize cDNA with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher,
Waltham, MA, USA) and N6 random primers, followed by second-strand synthesis with
DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (ThermoFisher). Viral cDNA libraries were
prepared with use of the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA),

10

then purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA),
followed by quantification with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The resulting DNA
libraries were sequenced on either the MiSeq or iSeq platforms (Illumina) using a 300cycle reagent kit. About 1·2–5 GB of data were obtained for each sample.

15

Genome and amino acid comparisons
The start and stop codons of each predicted gene were manually checked to ensure the
completeness. We tried to infer the possible evolution pathway and track the cotransmission of 2019-nCoV. To avoid random mutations that may mislead the inference,
we removed the substitution that appeared only once among all the sample genomes.

20

Nucleotide alignment was performed using MUSCLE (version 2.2.25+), and base-pair
comparison was performed using Basebybase (v1.0). Nucleotide substitutions were
determine using a consensus sequence of 2019-nCoV. The comparison of amino acids
within the 2019-nCoV were carried out. Additionally, for each ORF, the amino acid

sequences of 2019-nCoV, Human SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-CoV were compared using
the MUSCLE.

Phylogenetic analysis
5

Given the whole protein sequences corresponding for the 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoVs were
obtained from ViPR – Coronavirus and GISAID database on 18th Feb, 2020. We
performed a representative search with the related sequences of the betacoronaviridae
virus using the BLAST (version 2.2.25+). Based on the blast results, we excluded the
strains without the sample date, location, host and species information. Then the

10

screened sequences were aligned by the MUSCLE. The sequences were removed fot
that with no less than 28000bp or more than 100 unsolved nucleotides as ‘N’. At last, 109
public genomes of 2019-nCoV were kept. The phylogenetic tree for the whole genome
was constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) (version
7.0)32 by the maximum likelihood method under the General Time Reversible (GTR)

15

nucleotide substitution model, while the phylogenetic trees for the individual genes were
constructed by the FigTree software v1.4.3.
For the spike protein, given the whole genomes of 2019 nCoVs (118 strains) and other
SARS-like viruses isolated from Bat(1 strains) and Pangolin (6 strains), the genes was
predicted by GeneMarkS (version 3.36). The predicted genes were then against the

20

proteome of SARS-CoV by BLAST (version 2.2.25+). After that, Spike surface
glycoprotein (S) were picked, and RBD domain in Spike was also discriminated. For the
protein sequence of Spike genes, we got, multiple sequence alignment was made by
using the FFT-NS-2 algorithm in MAFFT v7.407 program, and three regions (50~246aa;

RBD domain; 600~796aa) were picked up. Finally, three phylogenetic trees were
constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software
(version 10.0.5) by the maximum likelihood method with the bootstrap tests (100
replicates), and Fasttree software (version 1.43) were used to visualize these trees.
5

SNP recognition and comparison
The SNPs of each sequence were defined as the sites variant from the reference
sequence. The ancestral sequence of the phylogenetic tree was used as the reference
sequence, which was estimated by python package TimeTree using Jukes-Cantor model
10

and default settings. Site with the unsolved nucleotide N and gap was ignored. The site
number of the SNP was decided by sequentially combined the CDS sequences in the
whole genome. The phylogenetic tree and the matching SNP for the tips was plotted by
ggtree. The geo-distribution and genotype of strains with SNP sites in Wuhan and other
areas were plotted by ggplot2. The SNP sites of 2019-nCoV were compared with SARS-

15

like virus in one bat and eight pangolin genome sequences. The pangolin sequences
EPI_ISL_410543 and EPI_ISL_410544 were removed for too many unsolved
nucleotides. The adjacent nucleotide of the two SNP sites 8517 and 27641 were extracted
from the alignment. The translation-reading frame was inferred by using the GenBank
annotations for the EPI_ISL_402125 strain.

20

Tracking individual shared mutations
The divergent evolution of G1 and G2 was tracked with the help of shared mutations as
following steps. First, we removed the substitution that appeared only once among all the

27

genomes to avoid random mutations or sequencing errors that might mislead the
inference. Second, genomes in G1 and G2 were grouped by the number of varied
nucleotides compared with the reference sequence of G1 (EPI_ISL_402125) or G2
(EPI_ISL_406801). In total, we divided all the genomes in G1 and G2 separately into
5

three groups with 1, 2 and 3 varied nucleotides. Third, the strains in groups with 1 varied
nucleotides were plotted in the tree with branch length of 1, then, strains with 2 varied
nucleotides were plotted in the tree with branch length of 2, it should be noted that the
strains with substitution site contained the site in group 1 was plotted behind the branch
with responding site. Similar ways were used to group 3.

Structure prediction and analysis.
Based on the computer-guided homology modeling method, the structural models were
constructed by SWISS-MODEL online server

33

. The model of nCoV 2019 Spike protein

used the Cryo-EM structure of SARS coronavirus S-protein (PDB ID: 6ACD)34 as the
15

template.
