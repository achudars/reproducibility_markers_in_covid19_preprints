Abstract

34

SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

35

resulting in infections and death of millions worldwide with maximum cases and mortality in

36

USA. The current study focuses on understanding the population specific variations

37

attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions which may help in

38

developing appropriate treatment strategies for COVID-19 pandemic. Rigorous phylogenetic

39

network analysis of 245 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes inferred five central clades named a

40

(ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2) showing both divergent and linear evolution types.

41

The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA strains with highest known

42

mutations. Clades were distinguished by ten co-mutational combinations in proteins; Nsp3,

43

ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6 generated by Amino Acid Variations (AAV). Our

44

analysis revealed that only 67.46 % of SNP mutations were carried by amino acid at

45

phenotypic level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase the protein stability in

46

238 strains except six strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas com (P5731L &

47

Y5768C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes of USA highlighting its 100% co-

48

occurrence. Docking study highlighted mutation (D7611G) caused reduction in binding of

49

Spike proteins with ACE2, but it also showed better interaction with TMPRSS2 receptor

50

which may contribute to its high transmissibility in USA strains. In addition, we found host

51

proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B & MYO5C had maximum interaction with viral hub proteins

52

(Nucleocapsid, Spike & Membrane). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting

53

MYO-5 proteins which could be an effective target for COVID-19 treatment. The functional

54

annotations of the Host-Pathogen Interaction (HPI) network were found to be highly

55

associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions confirming the vulnerability and severity

56

of infection in the patients. We also considered the presence of CpG islands in Nsp1 and N

57

proteins which may confers the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger methyltransferase

58

activity inside host cell.

Introduction

60

In December 2019, a novel RNA virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2

61

(SARS-CoV-2), belonging to Coronaviridae family (betacoronavirus), emerged as the reason

62

for the chaos of pneumonia disease also called Covid-19 in Chinese city, Wuhan (Li et al.,

63

2020). Covid-19 was declared as pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020 (Astuti and Ysrafil,

64

2020). Major outbreaks were reported in many locations of China, USA, Italy, Spain, Japan,

65

and South Korea. As of date it has already spread to more than 200 countries of the world

66

surpassing more than 30 thousand deaths and 6 million reported active cases worldwide

67

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).

68

SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA virus with a genome size ranging from 29.8 kb

69

to 29.9 kb (Khailany et al., 2020). The genomic repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 comprises of 10

70

open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 27 proteins (Abduljalil and Abduljalil, 2020). ORF1ab

71

encodes for 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp) whereas structural proteins include spike (S),

72

envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Pyrc et al., 2007; Yang and

73

Leibowitz, 2015). In addition, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 comprises of ORF3a, ORF6,

74

ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF9 genes encoding six accessory proteins, flanked by 5’ and 3’

75

UTRs (Khailany et al., 2020). In our previous study (Kumar et al., 2020), a higher mutational

76

rate in the genomes from different geographical locations around the world by accumulation

77

of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) was reported. Even during these early stages of

78

the global pandemic, genomic surveillance has been used to differentiate circulating strains

79

into distinct, geographically based lineages (Forster et al., 2020). However, the ongoing

80

analysis of this global dataset suggests no consolidated significant links between SARS-CoV-

81

2 genome sequence variability, virus transmissibility and disease severity.

82

It is known that mutations at both genomic and protein level are “Hormonical Orchestra” (Yu

83

et al., 2019) that drives the evolutionary changes, demanding a detailed study of SARS-CoV-2

84

mutations to understand its successful invasion and infection. The study analyzed that

85

mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 isolates show very high mutational rates that show the

86

isolates more virulent, causing significant harm to the hosts (Mandal et., 2020). Thus, in the

87

present study, we selected 245 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 deciphering the

88

phylogenetic relationships, tracing them to SNPs at nucleotide and amino acid (Amino Acid

89

Variation) levels and performing structural re-modelling. Our results revealed the

90

evolutionary relationships among the strains predicting Nsp3 as mutational hotspot for SARS-

91

CoV-2. We further extended the study to understand mechanism of host immunity evasion by

92

Host-Pathogen Interaction (HPI) and confirming their interactions with host proteins by

93

docking studies. We identified sparsely distributed hubs which may interfere and control

94

network stability as well as other communities/modules. This indicated the affinity to attract a

95

large number of low-degree nodes toward each hub, which is a strong evidence of controlling

96

the topological properties of the network by these few hubs (Nafis et al., 2015). We also

97

analyzed the transfer of genomic SNPs to amino acid levels and associations of CpG islands

98

contributing towards the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The existence of CpG islands has

99

always been connected with the epigenetic regulation and act as hotspots for methylation

100

(Jones, 2012; Shiraishi et al., 2002; Hoelzer et al., 2008). Here also, the conservancy found in

101

possession of CpG islands towards the extremities of all the genomes considered in the

102

present analysis indicate their importance in evading host immunity. Our study showed an

103

overall depiction of SARS-CoV-2 variations and interactions that eventually may lead to

104

development of rational therapeutic measures and medication against COVID-19.

105

Material and Methods

106

Selection of genomes, annotations and phylogeny construction

107

Publicly available genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses were obtained from the NCBI database

108

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/). Until March 31, 2020 only 375

109

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available in the databases. The data was screened for unwanted

110

ambiguous bases using N-analysis program, based on which 245 complete and clean genomes

111

of SARS-CoV-2 were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Info 1). A manually

112

annotated reference database was generated using GenBank file of severe acute respiratory

113

syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate- SARS-CoV-2/SH01/human/2020/CHN (Accession number:

114

MT121215.1) and open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted against the formatted database

115

using prokka (-gcode 1) (Seemann, 2014). Genomic sequences included in the analysis

116

belongs to different countries namely, USA (168), China (53), Pakistan (2), Australia (1),

117

Brazil (1), Finland (1), India (2), Israel (2), Japan (5), Vietnam (2), Nepal (1), Peru (1), South

118

Korea (1), Spain (1), Sweden (1). Whole genomes nucleotide and protein sequences were

119

aligned using mafft (Katoh et al., 2013) at 1000 iterations. The alignments so obtained were

120

processed for phylogeny construction using BioEdit software (Hall et al., 2011). The

121

nucleotide-based phylogeny was annotated and visualized on iTOL server (Letunic and Bork,

122

2006). While, amino acid-based phylogeny was visualized and annotated using GrapeTree

123

(Zhou et al., 2018).

124
125

Genotyping based on SNP/AAV

126

To detect nucleotide and amino acid variations (AAV) among 245 genomes of SARS-CoV-2,

127

sequence alignment of nucleotide and amino acid, respectively were performed against the

128

reference genome. The change of nucleotide and amino acid was calculated as point variations

129

and were recorded. The interpolation and visualization were plotted using computer programs

in Python. Co-mutation were predicted and clustering was performed using MicroReact

131

(Argimon et al., 2016)

132
133

Data and Computer programs:

134

The genomic analytics is performed using programs in Python and Biopython libraries (Cock

135

et al., 2009). The computer programs and the updated SNP profiles of SARS-CoV-2 isolates

136

are available upon requests.

137
138

Construction of the Host-Pathogen Interaction Network of SARS-CoV-2

139

In order to find the HPI, we subjected SARS-CoV-2 proteins to Host-Pathogen interaction

140

databases such as Viruses.STRING v10.5 (Cook et al., 2018) and HPIDB3.0 (Ammari et al.,

141

2016) for predicting their direct interaction with human as the principal host. The HPI

142

network was constructed and visualized using Cytoscape v3.7.2 (Shannon, et al., 2003). In the

143

constructed Network, proteins with highest degree, which interact with several other signaling

144

proteins in the network indicate a key regulatory role as a hub. In our study, using

145

NetworkAnalyser (Assenov, et al., 2008), plugin of Cytoscape v3.7.2, we identified the hub

146

protein and subjected to functional analysis. The network was functionally annotated using

147

STRINGApp and StringEnrichment app (Doncheva et al., 2019) plugin of Cytoscape using

148

Reactome, GO, InterPRO, KEGG and Pfam databases. This analysis provides an opportunity

149

of a more precise understanding of the biological functions, providing valuable clues for

150

biologists.

151
152

Computational structural analysis on wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 proteins

153

SARS-CoV-2 proteins sequences were retrieved from the NCBI genome database and

154

pairwise sequence alignment of wild-type and mutant proteins were carried out by the Clustal

155

Omega tool (Sievers et al., 2011). The wild-type and mutant homology model of S-protein,

156

NspNsp12 and Nsp13 were constructed using the SWISSMODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018),

157

whereas the 3D structure of ORF8, ORF3A, Nsp2, Nsp3 and Nsp6 were predicted using

158

Phyre2 server (Kelley et al., 2015). The host proteins (TMPRSS2, RPS6, ATP6V1G1 and

159

MYO5C) 3D structures were generated using the SWISSMODEL and ACE2 structure

160

retrieved from the PDB database (PDB ID: 6M17). These structures were energy minimized

161

by the Chiron energy minimization server (Ramachandran et al., 2011). The effect of the

162

mutation was analyzed using HOPE (Venselaar et al., 2010) and I-mutant (Capriotti et al.,

163

2006). The I-mutant method allows us to predict the stability of the protein due to mutation.

164

The docking studies for wild and mutant SARS-CoV-2 proteins with host proteins was carried

165

out using PatchDock Server (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005). Structural visualizations and

166

analysis were carried out using pyMOL2.3.5 (Jacobson et al., 2002).

167

Analysis of CpG regions

168

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analysed for the presence of CpG regions that can be targeted for

169

methylation induced gene silencing. To locate the CpG regions, meth primer 2.0

170

(http://www.urogene.org/methprimer2/)

171

(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/cpgplot/) programs were used, although some variations

172

were found in both the programs. Both the programs were run on default parameters of a

173

sequence window longer than 100 bp; GC content of ≥50%, and an observed/expected CpG

174

dinucleotide ratio ≥0.60. The presence of common CpG islands was confirmed by performing

175

BLAST using the above reference strain.

Results and Discussion

178

Phylogenetic relationship between different SARS-CoV-2 strains

179

In our previous study, we reported a mosaic pattern of phylogenetic clustering of 95 genomes

180

of SARS-COV-2 isolated from different geographical locations (Kumar et al., 2020). Strains

181

belonging to one country were found clustered with distant countries strains but not with the

182

neighboring one. Taking clue from these studies we constructed phylogenetic relatedness of

183

245 strains of SARS-COV-2 from USA, China, and several other countries including, Spain,

184

Vietnam, Peru, Finland and Pakistan and unravel the significant association of evolutionary

185

patterns among SARS-CoV-2 based on their geographical locations predicting their mosaic

186

phylogenetic arrangements. It was found that the majority of strains from USA were clustered

187

together, but comparatively high divergences were found in strains isolated from China and

188

Japan. Japanese strains were found to be scattered and formed clusters with strains from USA,

189

Pakistan, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China. Even with less number of genomes sequences from

190

Japan, Vietnam and Peru revealed a highly scattered pattern and formed close associations

191

with that of USA and Chinese strains. Strains reported from patients of Taiwan (MT192759),

192

Australia (MT007544), South Korea (MT039890), Nepal (MT072688) and Vietnam

193

(MT192773, MT192772) had travel histories from Wuhan, China (Cheng et al., 2020).

194

However, a strain from Pakistan (MT240479) which clustered with the Japanese strains was

195

found to be isolated from patient having travel history from Iran. Indian strains (MT050439,

196

MT012098) that were isolated from patients who travelled from Dubai, clustered with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.162560; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

197

Chinese strains. Later, reports confirmed many cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Dubai from China

198

(https://www.newsbytesapp.com/timeline/India/58169/271167/coronavirus-2-positive-cases-

199

detected-in-delhi-telangana). Thus, a clear landscape of phylogenetic relationships could be

200

obtained reflecting mosaic clustering patterns in accordance with the travel history of patients

201

(Figure1A). However, results were in contradiction with the genomic analysis of SARS-

202

COV-2 by Foster et al.,( 2020) where they predicted the linear/directive evolution from

203

ancestral node a to node b and c. Whereas we report here both divergent (from ancestral node

204

a to b, c & e) and directive (node c to d) evolution among the SARS-CoV-2 strains (Figure1B

205

and Figure 3B). Since genome-based phylogeny did not highlight the amino acid level

206

changes, thus to ascertain the variations among the SARS-CoV-2 strains at phenotypic level,

207

we constructed whole proteome alignment-based phylogeny, clustered the 245 strains into

208

five major clades a-e (Figure 1B). The first cluster, Clade-a had maximum nodes (46),

209

including reference node, and strains from Nepal (MT072688), Pakistan (MT262993), Taiwan

210

(MT192759) along with 15 strains from USA and 27 strains from China. It also had the

211

mutated daughter nodes (highlighted by # in figure 3 B for corresponding nodes) radiating

212

outwards, belonging to China, Finland (MT020781), India (MT012098), Japan (LC534419,

213

LC529905), Taiwan (MT066176), Vietnam (MT192772-3), Brazil (MT126808), Australia

214

(MT007544), South Korea (MT039890) and Sweden (MT093571) along with seven USA

215

strains (Figure 1B). This clade represented the ancestral node as it harbored the oldest known

216

SARS-CoV-2 strain from China and laid down the foundation of rest of the mutated daughter

217

strains worldwide, marking the onset of the divergence in SARS CoV-2. Three significantly

218

diverged network nodes originated from the ancestral clade-a and were marked as clade-b, c

219

and e (Figure 1B). For Clade-b, central node included only four strains in which two were

220

from USA (MT184912, MT276328) and one each from Israel (MT276597) and Japan

221

(LC528233). Its major descended radiant belonged to Japan (LC528232, LC534418), Pakistan

222

(MT240479), USA (MT184913, MT184910, MN997409) and China (MT049951,

223

MT226610). It was observed that one of the Chinese strains in clad-b (MT226610) had the

224

longest branch length making the strain very distinct (harboring 25 mutations) by showing

225

exceptionally high rate of evolution. In Clade-c lineage, small central node was comprised of

226

Taiwan (MT066175), USA (MT246667, MT233526, MT020881, MT985325, MT020880)

227

and Chinese (MN938384, LR757995) strains. Interestingly one strain each from Spain

228

(MT233523) and India (MT050493) were also found radiating as daughter node from the

229

central one. Clade-d lineage, which was originated from clade-c lineage, consisted only of

230

USA strains both in central nodes and radiations. Importantly, 2 strains (MT263416,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.162560; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

231

MT246471) were found most divergent with varied mutation suggesting the high rate of

232

evolution among USA strains which might be linked with the high pathogenicity among them.

233

Clade-e bifurcated into two sub-clads (e1 and e2) by significant set of mutations. Sub-clad-e1

234

include six strains from USA, one from Israel (MT276598) with radiating nodes from Peru

235

(MT263074) and USA (MT276327); whereas, sub-clad e2 had 32 strains belonging to USA.

236

Thus, formation of five major evolutionary clades and subclades based on the amino acid

237

phylogeny needs attention for identifying the assessment of divergence among SARS-CoV-2

238

strains. This divergence is a proof of the random evolution of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting

239

network expansion in five clads contradicting to the earlier directed evolution proposed by

240

Foster et al., 2020.

241
242

Genotyping and variation estimation

243

In order to understand the implication of mosaic pattern of transmissions and evolutionary

244

lineage clustering (Clad a-e), we studied the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)

245

genotyping from the 245 genome sequences as mutation counts along with their frequency at

246

specific genomic locations. Mutational changes at phenotypic levels were also weighed by

247

assessing Amino Acid Variations (AAV). Interpolations of the SNPs/AAVs data were made

248

by assessing their frequency, genomic positions and type of SNPs/AAVs (Figure 2B),

249

highlighted a large mutational diversity among the virus isolates. We identified a total of 12

250

SNP types (A>G, A>C, A>T, C>A, C>G, C>T,G>A,G>C, G>T, T>A, T>C, T>G) accounting

251

for mutations at 297 genomic locations (Figure 2A, 2B). Overall pattern of SNPs suggested

252

C>T transition as the most common mutation in the entire genomic sets (Figure2A), however

253

highest frequency was recorded for T>C transitions (Figure 2B). Based on the genomic

254

arbitrators SNP frequencies, we analyzed 14 major locations inside the genomes of SARS-

255

CoV-2 for potential mutation generating different allelic forms for genes (Table 1). The SNP

256

of C>T was first observed at 67th location in 5’ UTR region of leader sequence with a

257

frequency of 45 followed by Nsp2 at two locations (885 & 2863) with the frequency of 29 and

258

44, respectively. Nsp3/PL-PRO and Nsp8 marked the highest frequency of 238 SNP counts of

259

T>C at 5852 and 12299 locations. Another T>C SNP was observed in ORF8 with frequency

260

of 88 at 27973 location. C>T SNP transformation was found in Nsp4 and Nsp12 with the

261

frequency of 88 and 44 at location 8608 and 14234, respectively. Non-structural protein,

262

Nsp13 was strangely found harboring two different SNP (C>T and A>G) at three different

263

locations (17573, 17684, 17886) with a relatively high frequency of 68, 63 and 63

264

respectively. A>G SNP conversion in S (Spike) protein was found with a frequency of 43. A

265

Low SNP count of G>T transitions were falling in the ORF3a and Nsp6 with frequency of 32

266

and 21, respectively (Table 1). Though, all SNP counts do not reflect the phenotypic change at

267

protein level and therefore must be estimated at the translation levels for their significant

268

phenotypic effect. Although 297 genomic locations harbored SNPs but their corresponding

269

AAV were found only in 200 genomic locations accounting for 67.34% conversion efficiency.

270

Out of 14 high frequency SNPs, only 9 mutations [Nsp2 (T265I), Nsp3 (S1920P), Nsp6

(L9033S)] were found to reflect at protein level with the highest frequency of 238 in Nsp3

273

(Table 1). These proteins are known to play various regulatory roles and therefore, mutations

274

at amino acid level can modulate their catalytic activity drastically. Specifically, Nsp3 is the

275

largest and essential component of replication complex in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Lei et

276

al., 2018) and along with Nsp2 it forms a transcriptional complex in endosome of the infected

277

host cell (Wu et al., 2020). Nsp6 is a multiple-spanning transmembrane protein located into

278

the ER where they induce autophagosomes via an omegosome intermediate (Cottam et al.,

279

2014). Interestingly, the mutation of L3605F causes stiffness in the secondary structure of

280

Nsp6 and leads to low stability of the protein structure in most recent sequences from Asia,

281

America, Oceania and Europe (Benvenuto et al., 2020). Nsp12 and Nsp13 are the key

282

replicative enzymes, which require Nsp6, Nsp7 and Nsp10 as cofactors. Nsp12, RNA

283

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with the presence of the bulkier leucine side chain at

284

location 4618 is likely to create a greater stringency for base pairing to the templating

285

nucleotide, thus

286

helicase domain, allowing efficient strand separation of extended regions of double-stranded

287

RNA and DNA (Pachetti et al., 2020). Dual mutations in Nsp13 were reported with profound

288

effect on its activity. P5731L, mutation leads to increased affinity of helicase RNA

289

interaction, whereas Y5768C is a destabilizing mutation increasing the molecular flexibility

290

and leading to decreased affinity of helicase binding with RNA (Begum et al., 2020).

291

Therefore, both the mutations were antagonistic in nature. Thus, ORF1ab polyprotein of

292

SARS-CoV-2 encompasses mutational spectra where signature mutations for Nsp2, Nsp3,

293

Nsp6, Nsp12 and Nsp13 have been predicted. Amino acid mutations in structural proteins S,

294

ORF3a and ORF8 have also been observed with varied frequency of 45, 34 and 89

295

respectively. The mutation in Spike protein (D7611G) has been reported to outcompete other

296

preexisting subtypes, including the ancestral one. This mutation generates an additional serine

297

protease (Elastase) cleavage site in Spike protein (Bhattacharya et al., 2020)

modulating polymerase fidelity (Sexton et al., 2016). Nsp13 contains a

298

discussed in more details in later sections.ORF3a mutation (Q8327H), is located near TNF

299

receptor associated factor-3 (TRAF-3) regions and has been reported as molecular differences

300

marker in many genomes including Indian SARS- CoV-2 genomes (Hassan et al., 2020) for

301

their delineation. Amino acid change in ORF8 sequence (L9033S) propose that it is preserved

302

(Koyama et al., 2020) therefore it is critical to examine its biological function in SARS-CoV-

303

2.

304

Our results showed that the mutations (SNPs and AVV) in the virus were not uniformly

305

distributed. Genotyping study annotated few mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes at

306

certain specific locations with high frequency predicting their high selective pressure. Thus,

307

mutations can be predicted as location-specific but not type-specific by SNP count. Highly

308

frequent AAV might be associated with the changes in transmissibility and virulence behavior

309

of the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, high-frequency AAV mutations in Spike protein, RdRp,

310

helicase and ORF3a are important factors to consider while developing vaccines against the

311

fast-evolving strains of SARS-CoV-2.

312

Prevalence of Co-mutation in SARS-COV-2 evolution

313

Interestingly, we observed co-mutations in Nsp13 at locations 5768 (Nsp13_1) and

314

5731(Nsp13_2) that were prevalent in common 64 genomes, all belonging to USA. The AAV

315

reported above (Table 1) were further analyzed and found occurring in 10 different

316

permutations varying from single to multiple mutated protein combinations. Complete details

317

of these co-mutations combinations are given in Table 2. These co-mutations were mapped

318

over the divergent phylogeny for indicating the evolutionary divergence among the 245

319

strains. The phylogram (Figure 1B) showed clear divergence of strains from the parent strain

320

due to accumulation of mutations at different level of human to human transmission. We

321

found co-mutations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6 were responsible for

322

the above divergence.

323

These co-mutations were found linked with lineage clades a to e, highlighting their

324

prevalence among them (Figure.1B). In clade-a, 40 genomes harbored mutations at only

325

Nsp3 protein while six isolates belonging to USA (MT262993, MT044258, MT159716,

326

MT259248, MT259267) and Pakistan (MT263424) showed no mutation confirming their

327

lineage same as that of the reference/ancestral genome from China. Therefore, Nsp3 marked

328

as first mutational hotspot for accumulating amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Brazil

329

(MT126808) and USA (MT276331) strains form the descendent from clade-a harbored

330

Nsp3/Nsp6 as first co-mutation. The clade-b also had an additional mutation of ORF8 along

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.162560; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

331

with Nsp3 and Nsp6 with three descendant strain from US and China. We observed most

332

distant Chinese strain (MT226610), clustered in clade-b and harbored additional 25 AAV

333

making it the highly pathogenic strain in the network as reported above in Figure 1B. The

334

clade-c descendant from clade-a had a different set of co-mutation with Nsp3-ORF8 proteins.

335

Clade-d descended further from clade-c had two mutation in Nsp13 (5768/5731) in addition

336

to Nsp3/ORF8 proteins. Two strains from USA in the cluster radiating from clade-d harbored

337

additional Nsp6 mutation stating them more divergent with scope of further possible

338

evolution. The next subclade-e1 was found holding another new set of co-mutation of

339

Nsp3/S/Nsp12. Whereas the highest number of co-mutations were found in subclade-e2 with

340

combination of Nsp3/Nsp2/Nsp12/S/ORF3a prevalent in 30 genomes belonging to USA

341

predicting them as active carrier of evolutionary force for SARS-CoV-2 divergence (Figure 3

342

A & B). Presence of Nsp3 mutation (S1920P) in 238 strains underlined the origin of mutation

343

from reference strain highlighting the first divergence in SARS-CoV-2 strain. In future, more

344

and more genome availability from USA may indicate the evolutionary relationships with

345

these co-mutations. Our result suggested that co-mutations are the major evolutionary force

346

that drives the pathogenicity among the different geographical isolated strains which can

347

responsible for higher and lower order of virulence among them.

348

The assessment of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins

349

Amino acid variations were predicted in eight (Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp6, Nsp12, Nsp13, S, Orf3a,

350

Orf8) SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Table 1). To identify their potential functional role, we carried

351

out the structural analysis of the proteins. Pairwise sequence alignment of wild-type and

352

mutant proteins provided the exact location and changes in amino acids. The GMQE and

353

QMEAN values range from 0.45 to 0.72 and -1.43 to -2.81, respectively. The sequence

354

identity ranges from 34% to 99%, which suggests that the models were constructed with high

355

confidence and best quality (Figure 6). The I-Mutant DDG tool predicts if a mutation can

356

largely destabilize the protein (∆∆G<-0.5 Kcal/mol), largely stabilize (∆∆G>0.5 Kcal/mol) or

357

have a weak effect (-0.5<=∆∆G<=0.5 Kcal/mol). The protein stability analysis showed that all

358

the identified mutations decreased the stability of seven proteins (Nsp2, Nsp6, Nsp12, Nsp13,

359

S, Orf3a, Orf8) except Nsp3 (T1103P) which predicted to increase protein stability (Figure 6

360

A-H). Further, to explore the role of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we carried out

361

HOPE analysis. D614G mutation in S-protein could disturb the rigidity of the protein and due

362

to glycine, hydrophobicity will affect the intra hydrogen bond formation with G594. In ORF8

363

and Nsp3, the mutation location was not conserved, so it did not affect or damage the protein

364

function. The mutation (P409L) in Nsp13 was present in the RNA virus helicase C-terminal

365

domain. Since proline is a very rigid amino acid and therefore induce a particular backbone

366

conformation that might be required at this position so this mutation could disturb domain and

367

abolished its function. Mutation L37F (Nsp6) and T85I (Nsp2) were also highly conserved

368

thus could profoundly damage the function of the respective protein. The P227L (Nsp12)

369

mutation was in the RNA binding domain located on the surface of the protein; modification

370

of this residue could disturb interactions with other molecules or other parts of the protein.

371

Conclusively, Nsp3 mutation which appeared in all co-mutation combinations, contributed in

372

increased protein stability among 238 strains could be assigned to their increased

373

pathogenicity. Thus, we attempted to highlight the effects of these mutations in host pathogen

374

interactions.

375
376

Modelling of Host-Pathogen Interaction Network and its Functional Analysis

377

The HPI Network of SARS-CoV-2 (HPIN-SARS-CoV-2) contained 58 edges, 56 nodes,

378

including 5 viral and 51 host proteins (Figure 5). Number of degree (the number of edges per

379

node) calculated based on HPI. The significant existence of few main gene hubs, namely, N, S

380

and M in the network and the attraction of a large number of low-degree nodes toward each

381

hub show strong evidence of controlling the topological properties of the network by these

382

few hubs. N has 37 degrees, S, and M has 16 and 8 degrees, respectively. These viral proteins

383

are the main hubs in the network, which regulate the network. Based on degree distribution,

384

the viral protein N showed highest pathogenicity followed by S and M. N is a highly

385

conserved major structural component of SARS-CoV virion involved in pathogenesis and

386

used as a marker for diagnostic assays (Xia et al., 2020). Another structural protein S (spike

387

glycoprotein), attach the virion to the cell membrane by interacting with host receptor,

388

initiating the infection (Belouzard et al., 2012). The M protein, component of the viral

389

envelope played a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly via its interactions with

390

other viral proteins (Garoff et al.,1998). Interestingly, we found four host proteins MYO5A,

391

MYO5B, MYO5C and T had a maximum interaction with viral hub proteins. MYO5A,

392

MYO5B, MYO5C interacting with all three (N, S and M) whereas T with two (S and M) viral

393

hub proteins, showed a significant relationship with persistent infections caused by the SARS-

394

CoV-2.

395

MYO5A, MYO5B and MYO5C proteins are Class V myosin (myosin-5) molecular motor that

396

functions as an organelle transporter (Roland et al., 2011) (Sasaki, et al., 1995). It was found

397

that the presence of myosin protein played a crucial role in coronavirus assembly and budding

398

in the infected cells (Neuman et al., 2008). These cytoskeletal proteins are of importance

399

during internalization and subsequent intracellular transport of viral proteins. As we know at

400

the entry level of virus, S interacts with host ACE2 receptor that internalizes the virus into the

401

endosomes of the host cell inducing conformational changes in the S glycoprotein (Belouzard

402

et al., 2012). It was found that inhibition of MYO5A, MYO5B, and MYO5C was efficient in

403

blocking the internalization pathway, thus this target can be used for the development of a

404

new treatment for SARS-CoV-2 (Dewerchin et al., 2014). Patients suffering from COVID-19

405

undergo two major condition in the severe stage, thrombotic phenomenon and hypoxia, that

406

are

407

https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20067017). Hypoxia, condition where oxygen level of the

408

body reduces drastically results in the elevated expression of T protein in the body (Shao et

409

al., 2015; Yoon et al., 2006). T protein (Brachyury/TBXT) is transcription factor involved in

410

regulating genes required for mesoderm formation and differentiation thus playing an

411

important role in pathogenesis. The detailed functional analysis of HPIN-SARS-CoV-2 was

412

mapped on the radiological findings from the COVID-19 severely infected patients and non-

413

survivors. It was reported that the levels of fibrin-degrading proteins, fibrinogen and D-dimer

414

protein were 3-4 folds higher as compared to healthy individual. Therefore, reflecting

415

coagulation activation from infection/sepsis, cytokine storm and impending multiple organs

416

failure (Tang et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Han et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020). In our network,

417

we found 24 proteins (ANGPTL1, TNN, FGL2, ANGPTL6, TNC, FCN3, FCN2, ANGPTL4,

418

FGB, FGA, ANGPT2, ANGPTL5, FGG, TNR, ANGPTL3, FCN1, FIBCD1, ANGPTL2,

419

ANGPTL7, ANGPT4, MFAP4, FGL1, TNXB and ANGPT1) are associated with the above

420

etiology (Figure 5 C). We also found the interaction of SMAD family proteins and SUMO1

421

with N protein, which may lead to inhibition of apoptosis of infected lung cells (Zhao et al,

422

2008). The interactome study reveals a significant role of identified host proteins in viral

423

budding and related symptoms of COVID-19.

424

The mutation in SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibit viral penetration into host

425

In order to validate the effect of phenotypic variation (AAV), significant host proteins

426

interactions from HPIN-SARS-CoV-2 were considered for in silico docking studies. Docking

427

of S-Protein (wild type and mutant) with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and one of myosin proteins

428

(MYO5C) were analyzed. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 for

429

entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (Wrapp et al., 2020). The poly-

430

proteins (Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp2, Nsp3 and Nsp6) of ORF1A and ORF1AB were docked with

431

RPS6 and ATP6V1G1 host proteins. The docking results showed that mutant S-protein could

432

not bind efficiently with ACE2 and MYO5C, whereas mutation slightly promotes the binding

433

with TMPRSS2 (Table 3, Figure 6 and Figure 5C). TMPRSS2 have been detected in both

434

nasal and bronchial epithelium by immunohistochemistry (Bertram et. al., 2012), reported to

435

occur largely in alveolar epithelial type II cells which are central to SARS-CoV-2

436

pathogenesis (Furong et al., 2020). The wild-type S-protein form 16 hydrogen bonds and

437

1058 non-bonded contacts with ACE2; whereas the mutant protein forms 12 hydrogen bond

438

and 738 non-bonded contacts (Figure 6). This result suggests that D614G mutation in S-

439

protein could affect viral entry into the host. Similarly, mutations present in the Nsp12,

440

Nsp13, Nsp2, Nsp3 and Nsp6 of SARS-CoV-2 could inhibit the interaction with RPS6, but

441

these mutations promote the binding with ATP6V1G1 expect Nsp6 (L3605F). The RPS6

442

contributes to control cell growth and proliferation (Chauvin et al., 2014), so a loss of

443

interaction with RPS6 could probably inhibit the production of viruses. Overall structural and

444

interactome analyses suggests that identified mutations (Nsp2 (T265I), Nsp3 (S1920P), Nsp6

445

(L3605F), Nsp12 (P4618L), Nsp13 (P5731L, Y5768C), S (D7611G)) in SARS-CoV-2 might

446

play an important role in modifying the efficacy of viral entry and its pathogenesis. However,

447

these observations required critical revaluation as well as experimental work to confirm the

448

in-silico results.

449

Regulation of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity by CpG island

450

The genotyping analysis that we performed showed high frequency rate (45) of SNP at 5’UTR

451

region (Table 1) and recent study also suggested that suppression of GC content could play a

452

vital role in specific antiviral activities (Xia, 2020). As seen in SNP analysis, the common

453

transitions of C>T and G>A alter the GC content of the SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). This directed

454

the analysis towards understanding the role of CpG island which is involved in silencing of

455

transcription and down regulation of viral replication (Vivekanandan et al., 2010). Viral

456

infections upregulate host DNA methyltransferase genes (DNMTs), and their overexpression

457

leads to methylation of host CpG islands along with the viral CpGs (Vivekanandan et al.,

458

2010). Since increased frequency of CpG motifs can serve as Pathogen-associated molecular

459

pattern (PAMP) or Damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) which are potent inducers

460

of strong innate immune responses (Barber, 2011; Frieman, 2008). Thus, CpG island profiling

461

and their importance of existence in SARS-CoV-2 genomes was proceeded. We found that

462

CpG islands were consistently present in two regions of the genome at the positions 285-385

463

nucleotides (101 bp) and 28,324-28,425 nucleotides (102 bp). The results were consistent in

464

all 245 genomes analyzed in the present study with 100% conservancy in 237 genome

465

sequences (Figure 7 A).

466

In the remaining 8 genomes, five genomes (MT246474.1 (G to A substitution at 354th position

467

with respect to reference genome); MT276329.1, MT276330.1 and MT276598.1 (C to T

468

substitution at 313th position) and MT246455.1 (G to T substitution at 332nd position)) showed

469

point mutation in 5’ CpG island; whereas three genomes (MT159718.1 (C to T substitution at

470

28409th position); MT159717.1 and MT184911.1 (G to T substitution at 28378th position))

471

showed point mutation in 3’CpG end (Figure 7 D). Interestingly, all these sequences belong to

472

USA. On further locating CpG island positions with respect to proteins, it was found that

473

these two CpG islands were located at two prime locations within the genome, one in Nsp1

474

(Figure 7 B), and another within Nucleocapsid (N) protein (Figure 7 C). Previously, it was

475

reported that both the proteins interacted with 5’ UTR region playing crucial roles in viral

476

replication and gene expressions (Guan et al., 2012; Yang and Leibowitz, 2015; Galan et al.,

477

2005). Most pivotal role of N protein revolves around encapsulation of viral gRNA which

478

leads to formation of ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), which is a vital step in assembly of

479

viral particles (Cong et al., 2017).

480

Nsp1 protein in coronaviruses plays a regulatory role in transcription and viral replication

481

(Cong et al., 2017). It is known to interact with 5’ UTR of host cell mRNA to induce its

482

endonucleolytic cleavage (Huang et al., 2011; Narayanan et al., 2015), thus inhibiting host

483

gene expression (Kamitani et al., 2009). It also plays an important role in blocking IFN-

484

dependent antiviral signaling pathways leading to dysregulation of host immune system

485

(Kamitani et al., 2006; Wathelet et al., 2007; Law et al., 2007). CpG sites can be targeted by

486

Zinc Finger Antiviral Proteins which can mediate antiviral restriction through CpG motif

487

detection (Bick et al, 2003; Liu et al., 2015; Chiu et al., 2018). Apart from this, CpG

488

oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are known to act as adjuvants and are already established as a

489

potent stimulator for host immune system (Campbell, 2017; Becker, 2005; Yuan, 2017; Singh

490

et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018). Moreover, recent studies conducted on influenza A genome and

491

Zika virus genome has shown that by increasing the CpG dinucleotides in viral genome,

492

impairment of viral infection is observed (Gaunt et al., 2016; Trus et al., 2020). Our result

493

showed that the presence of conserved CpG islands in Nps1 and N protein across 245

494

genomes of SARS-CoV-2 indicated their role in pathogenesis and can be targeted by Zinc

495

Finger Antiviral Proteins or exploited to design CpG-recoded vaccines.

Conclusions

497

The genomic and proteomic survey of 245 SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from subset of

498

population of different countries reflected global transmission during the outbreak of COVID-

499

19. The viral phylogenetic network with five clads (a-e) provided a landscape of the current

500

stage of epidemic where major divergence was observed in USA strains. From this we

501

propose genotypes linked to geographic clads in which signature SNP can be used to track and

502

monitor the epidemic. Demarcation of co-mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 strains by assessing

503

co-mutations also highlighted the evolutionary relationships among the viral proteins. Our

504

results suggested that co-mutation are indicative of AAV based induced pathogenicity leading

505

to multiple mutations embedded in few genomes. However, co-mutations are still in

506

evolutionary process and more combinations can be predicted with a large dataset. High-

507

frequency AAV mutations were present in the critical proteins, including the Nsp2, Nsp3,

508

Nsp6, Nsp12, Nsp13, S, Orf3a, Orf8 which could be considered for designing a vaccine.

509

Comparative analysis of proteins from wild and mutated strains showed positive selection of

510

mutation in Nsp3 but not in rest of the mutants. HPI model can be used as the fundamental

511

basis for structure-guided pathogenesis process inside host cell. The interactome study

512

showed MYO-5 proteins as a key host partner and also highlighted the key role of N, S ad M

513

viral proteins for conferring SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. The mutation in the S protein could

514

affects the viral entry by loose binding with ACE2. The presence of CpG islands in N and

515

Nsp1 protein could play a critical role in pathogenesis regulation. Based on our multi-omics

516

approach: genomics, proteomics, interactomics and structural biology; provided an

517

opportunity for better understanding of COVID-19 pandemic and can be considered in

518

ongoing vaccine development programs.

phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates using the Maximum Likelihood method based
on the Tamura-Nei model, (B) Amino acid based phylogenomic analysis. Circle areas are
proportional to the number of taxa. The map is diverged into 5 major clade (a-e) representing
variation in the genomes at amino-acid level. The colored circle represents the country of
origin of each isolate.

Figure 5. (A) Host-pathogenic interaction map of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Red
triangles represent viral proteins found to be directly interacting with the human proteins,
whereas the pink nodes denote the human proteins. Four major hubs were identified (green)
found interacting with maximum viral proteins. (B) Number of degree (the number of edges
per node) calculated based on HPI. The significant existence of few main gene hubs, namely,
N, S and M in the network and the attraction of a large number of low-degree nodes toward
each hub show strong evidence of controlling the topological properties of the network by
these few hubs. N has 37 degrees, S, and M has 16 and 8 degrees, respectively. These viral
proteins are the main hubs in the network, which regulate the network. (C) Functional
enrichment of the human proteins (grey nodes) found to be directly interacting with viral
proteins (pink nodes). Color bar around the nodes represent their functionality role in human
body.
