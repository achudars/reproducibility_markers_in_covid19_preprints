Summary

14

An effective vaccine to address the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is

15

an urgent public health priority1. Novel synthetic mRNA and vector-based vaccine technologies

16

offer an expeditious development path alternative to traditional vaccine approaches. Here we

17

describe the efforts to utilize an mRNA platform for rational design and evaluations of mRNA

18

vaccine candidates based on Spike (S) glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

19

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Several mRNA constructs

20

expressing various structural conformations of S-protein, including wild type (WT), a pre-fusion

21

stabilized mutant (2P), a furin cleavage-site mutant (GSAS) and a double mutant form

22

(2P/GSAS), were tested in a preclinical animal model for their capacity to elicit neutralizing

23

antibodies (nAbs). The lead 2P/GSAS candidate was further assessed in dose-ranging studies in

mice and Cynomolgus macaques. The selected 2P/GSAS vaccine formulation, now designated

25

MRT5500, elicited potent nAbs as measured in two types of neutralization assays. In addition,

26

MRT5500 elicited TH1-biased responses in both mouse and non-human primate species, a result

27

that helps to address a hypothetical concern regarding potential vaccine-associated enhanced

28

respiratory diseases associated with TH2-biased responses. These data position MRT5500 as a

29

viable vaccine candidate for clinical development against COVID-19.

Introduction

33

SARS-CoV-2, previously known as the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 2, is a -

34

coronavirus with a yet-to-be defined zoonotic origin. The first cases of human infection with

35

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were reported in December 2019 in China 3, and later

36

named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)4. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 virus which caused

37

an outbreak in 2002, SARS-CoV-2 has gained high capacity for human-to-human transmission

38

and quickly spread worldwide. It has caused over 34 million cases of confirmed infection and

39

more than 1,000,000 deaths in 188 countries (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).

40

An effective vaccine is urgently needed to address this global pandemic.

41
42

Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, and the viral spike (S) protein on the virion envelope is

43

essential for infection and is the target for host antiviral antibodies 5,6. The receptor for SARS-

44

CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metalloprotease that also serves as the

45

receptor for SARS-CoV-17. Most of the COVID-19 vaccine candidates reported are focused on a

46

pre-fusion-stabilized S protein, either as recombinant protein with adjuvant or delivered from

47

viral vectors or as DNA or mRNA vaccines 8-15. The pre-fusion-stabilized version of SARS-

48

CoV-2 S-protein contains two proline substitutions (2P), at amino acid positions 986 and 987,

49

located near the apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1 16. Structural studies reveal that the

50

pre-fusion stabilized S closely resembles native S protein on the virion surface; a structure

51

targeted by many reported effective neutralizing antibodies 17-19. Moreover, the vaccine premises

52

are based on the prior work of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins presented

53

in pre-fusion conformations20-22. The ability of S-2P-based vaccines to elicit neutralizing

54

antibodies has been demonstrated 8-10 23,24.

55
56

There is a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 S protein which possesses a polybasic furin cleavage

57

site at the junction of S1 and S2 subunits. This feature is believed to have emerged during viral

58

transmission from zoonotic host to human25-27, and is key to SARS-CoV-2 high transmissibility

59

in humans28,29. Although robust SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lungs requires a multibasic

60

cleavage site30, interestingly, both cleaved and uncleaved versions of S protein co-exist on

61

virions purified from viral culture on Vero cells 31,32. Thus, it remains unclear how the cleavage

62

provides an advantage for viral transmission. Also, from a vaccine design perspective, one may

63

speculate that furin cleavage site may result in subtle conformational changes in the trimerized S

64

protein, potentially favoring its interaction with ACE2 26.

65
66

These unanswered questions led us to design various forms of S protein constructs involving

67

both 2P and cleavage site, referred to herein as GSAS mutations. These GSAS constructs were

68

first evaluated for immunogenicity in mice. The 2P/GSAS S mRNA encapsulated in a cationic

69

lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation, designated as MRT5500, was subsequently selected for

70

further evaluation. Here we report the results of preclinical evaluation of MRT5500 in mice and

71

non-human primates (NHPs). MRT5500 was administered twice via the intramuscular route (IM)

72

at a three-week interval in both animal models. Results demonstrated that MRT5500 elicited

73

potent neutralizing activity and a TH1-biased response in both species. The ability of this vaccine

74

to induce both humoral and cell-mediated antiviral responses identifies MRT5500 as a promising

75

clinical vaccine candidate.

Results

77

Design and selection of mRNA constructs

78

SARS-CoV-2 S protein, a 1273 amino acid glycoprotein, is expressed and stabilized as a

79

membrane anchored homo-trimer6. The receptor binding domain (RBD) has been identified as

80

the critical component to initiate virus attachment to ACE2, a cellular receptor for viral

81

infection33. Interestingly, the RBD is present in both up and down configurations in the pre-

82

fusion form of S protein, and the up position has been speculated as the prerequisite for

83

interaction with ACE26,31. The furin cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 S occurs

84

during viral biosynthesis34. It is postulated that transition and adaptation to the human host

85

resulted in the acquisition of a furin protease site in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is a

86

unique feature discriminating this virus from SARS-CoV-1 and other SARS-related-CoVs 26.

87

Approximately 45% of the total S protein monomers presented within intact SARS-CoV-2

88

virions have been reported as cleaved at the furin cleavage site 31; however, it is not clear which

89

form is favored by the virus to facilitate the fusion process 26,34-36.

90
91

The COVID-19 vaccine hypothesis has been centered around induction of neutralizing

92

antibodies (nAbs) that either block the interaction of the RBD with ACE2, or that prevent the

93

fusion process involving S protein transition from pre- to post-fusion conformation 37,38. Although

94

the pre-fusion conformation is known to be critical for eliciting a neutralizing response 18,19, the

95

impact of the furin cleavage site in eliciting neutralizing antibodies requires additional studies.

96

To test the potential contribution of this site, we mutated the furin cleavage site, composed of the

97

polybasic residues RRAR, to GSAS from amino acid position 682 to 685 30,35. Four constructs

98

were synthesized as mRNA to represent either wild type (WT), stabilized pre-fusion mutant (2P)

99

20

, furin cleavage site mutant (GSAS) or a double mutant (2P/GSAS) of SARS-CoV-2 S gene.

100

These constructs were transfected into a human cell line and their expression levels were verified

101

by Western Blot (Fig. 1a). As expected, endogenous cleavage of WT and 2P constructs, but not

102

GSAS or 2P/GSAS proteins, was observed (Fig. 1a), which yielded a band of approximately 90

103

kDa representing S2.

104
105

In order to determine the potential impact of 2P and GSAS mutations on immunogenicity, we

106

formulated each of the four mRNA constructs within a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which has been

107

designed for efficient delivery of mRNA vaccines 39. BALB/c mice were administered two

108

immunizations at a 0.4 µg dose of each of four formulations at a three-week interval. Binding

109

antibody activities in the serum samples were assessed via Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent

110

Assay (ELISA) (Fig. 1b). All four vaccines demonstrated similar levels of binding antibodies 14

111

days after the first vaccination, and the responses were further enhanced one week after the

112

second dose at day (D) 28. On D35, the IgG geometric mean titers (GMTs) for WT, 2P, GSAS

113

and 2P/GSAS groups were 184343, 200896, 379653 and 201080 respectively. There were no

114

statistically significant differences among those GMT titers.

115
116

To understand the potential impact of these mutations on nAbs titers, we tested the ability of

117

immune sera to neutralize the infectivity of GFP reporter pseudoviral particles (RVP) in HEK-

118

293T cells stably over-expressing human ACE2 40. RVPs expressed antigenically correct SARS

119

CoV-2 S protein and GFP reporter genes on lentiviral (HIV) core and were capable of a single

120

round of infection. Pseudoviral neutralization assay (PsVNa) allowed the determination of serum

121

dilution which can achieve 50% inhibition of RVP entry (ID 50; see Materials and Methods).

122

Contrary to binding antibodies which could be detected at D14 after the first immunization, the

123

neutralizing antibody response could only be detected after the second immunization. Also

124

noted, the spread of the nAb titers within each group were more pronounced when compared to

125

binding antibody titers, with 95% confidence intervals overlapping each other. On D35, the

126

GMTs for pseudoviral (PsV) nAb titers were 152 for WT, 195 for 2P, 1005 for GSAS and 354

127

for 2P/GSAS. The neutralizing potential of the GSAS variant was trending slightly higher than

128

2P/GSAS.

129
130

Another important observation is that ELISA titers were not consistently predictive of

131

neutralizing titers by PsVNa. Some mice in the WT and 2P groups did not seroconvert in the

132

neutralization assay but their endpoint ELISA titers were comparable to the other animals in the

133

group which demonstrated neutralizing activity. We therefore placed greater emphasis on PsVNa

134

titer for continuing candidate evaluation. Considering the trend towards higher PsVNa observed

135

for the GSAS constructs as well as the expected importance of the pre-fusion conformation, we

136

selected the double mutant 2P/GSAS/LNP formulation, referred to as MRT5500, for further

137

preclinical evaluations.

138
139

Serological evaluations of MRT5500 in mice and NHPs

140

The selected MRT5500 formulation was evaluated in both mouse and NHP studies with a range

141

of doses covering more than 10-fold titration. The hypothesis for this study is that S-specific

142

antibodies blocking viral infection are key for protection, and our evaluation therefore focused

143

on serological responses against SARS-CoV-2 S, with a particular emphasis on neutralizing

144

titers post vaccination 8,9,41. Four dose levels in mice were assessed, ranging from 0.2 to 10 µg

145

per dose. As expected, MRT5500 induced dose-dependent S-specific binding antibodies and

146

neutralizing antibodies in mice (Fig. 2). PsVNa titers were detected in the higher dose groups (5

147

µg, 10 µg) after one vaccination, within the titers being more pronounced after the second

148

vaccination at D21 (Fig. 2b). The PsVNa GMTs were 534, 5232, 9370 and 7472 at D35 for the

149

0.2, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 μg dose groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant

150

differences in PsV neutralization titers on D35 between 1, 5 and 10 µg groups (Suppl. Table 2),

151

suggesting a dose-saturation effect beyond 1 µg in mice. We also demonstrated that the peak

152

PsV titers (D35) in mice were significantly different from the titers observed in a panel of 93

153

convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients (Suppl. Fig. 4).

154
155

In NHPs, we evaluated three dose levels: 15, 45 or 135 µg per dose. After the first immunization,

156

nearly all NHPs (10 out of 12) developed antibodies reactive to recombinant S protein in ELISA,

157

and the titers were further enhanced after a second immunization at D35 (Suppl. Fig.1) with all

158

NHPs demonstrating high titers of nAbs. The neutralization potency was assessed by two

159

methods: PsVNa (Fig. 2a) and microneutralization (MN) assay (Fig. 2b). In both assays, a dose-

160

dependent increase in neutralization titer was observed, with GMTs on D35 of 924 for 15 µg,

161

961 for 45 µg, and 2871 for 135 µg in PsVNa. The MN GMTs followed a similar trend, with

162

titers of 555 for 15 µg, 719 for 45 µg and 1877 for the 135 µg group. Despite the observed trend

163

towards higher titers with increasing dose, the differences between groups was not statistically

164

significant for either MN or PsV neutralization titers.

166

Although we have used two assays to measure the neutralizing potency, the results from both

167

assays were highly correlated (Suppl. Fig. 3 and Suppl. Table 1). Regardless of the dose level

168

tested, D35 PsV and MN titers were approximately 130-fold higher than those of pre-immune

169

animals. Furthermore, the observed PsV and MN titers were significantly higher from titers

170

observed in a panel of 93 convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients (Suppl. Fig. 5).

171
172

T-cell profiles of the selected mRNA formulation in NHPs

173

Vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) has been a safety concern for

174

COVID-19 vaccines in development, although the concern at this stage is only a theoretical one 1.

175

This phenomenon has been reported for whole-inactivated virus vaccines against measles and

176

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which were tested in the 1960s (cit by 1), and one of the

177

disease hypotheses implicates the biased production of T H2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) by

178

antigen-specific CD4 T cells. A similar association between a T H2 profile and disease

179

enhancement has been reported for an inactivated SARS-CoV-1 vaccine in mice 42. Furthermore,

180

less severe cases of SARS were associated with accelerated induction of T H1 cell responses43,

181

whereas TH2-biased responses have been associated with enhancement of lung disease following

182

infection in mice parenterally vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV viral vaccines 42,44. Similar

183

phenomena have been observed in humans. For example, a SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular

184

response was associated with severity of disease: recovered patients with mild COVID-19

185

illnesses demonstrated high levels of IFN- induced by SARS-Cov-2 antigens, while severe

186

pneumonia patients showed significantly lower level of this cytokine 45. Thus, it is important to

187

understand the T cell profiles induced by MRT5500.

189

T cell cytokine responses were tested in NHPs three weeks after the second vaccination.

190

Cytokines induced by restimulation with the pooled SARS CoV-2 S protein peptides were

191

assesses in PBMCs on D42 by the IFN- (TH1 cytokine) and IL-13 (TH2 cytokine) ELISPOT

192

assays. The majority of animals in three dose level groups tested (10 out of 12) demonstrated

193

presence of IFN- secreting cells, ranging from two to over 100 spot-forming cells per million

194

PBMCs. A dose-response was not observed as the animals in the lower and higher dose level

195

groups showed comparable frequencies of IFN- secreting cells. In contrast, presence of IL-13

196

cytokine secreting cells was not detected in any of the groups tested and at any dose level,

197

suggesting induction of a TH1-biased cellular responses (Fig. 4). These data presented clear

198

evidence for lack of TH2 response to S antigen following vaccination in NHPs.

199
200

Similar assessment of cellular immune responses was performed in immune splenocytes in

201

BALB/C mice on D35. ELISPOT was conducted in the 5 and 10 µg dose groups in Fig. 2.

202

Although BALB/c mice have strong tendency for T H2 biased immune responses, following re-

203

stimulation with the S protein peptide pools splenocytes from the MRT5500 immunized mice

204

secreted predominantly IFNɣ while IL-5 responses were marginal, suggesting considerable T H1

205

bias (Supplementary Fig.2). Thus, MRT5500 vaccination elicited predominantly T H1-biased

206

responses in both animal species.

Discussion

209

mRNA-based vaccine development provides a rapid pathway for effective evaluation of multiple

210

vaccine construct designs which we employed for our initial evaluation of S antigen mRNA

211

vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2. For any vaccine intended to generate antibody-

212

mediated immunity, delivering a conformationally correct protein is critical 1. Lessons have been

213

learned from RSV F protein where the post-fusion form elicited poor neutralizing antibodies,

214

albeit extremely immunogenic in humans46, and the post-fusion form F antigen vaccine has

215

failed to provide any protection against RSV infection47. Thus, our focus in this study was to

216

identify mutations that could stabilize the pre-fusion form of S antigen upon expression. In

217

contrast to the other S antigen mRNA vaccines under evaluations 9,10,23,24,48, we have incorporated

218

a unique mutation at cleavage site GSAS, in addition to 2P, which has enhanced features to lock

219

the S protein in the pre-fusion form. There were two considerations for this design. First, it is not

220

known whether 2P mutations alone, located at the apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1,

221

are sufficient for locking the S antigen in the pre-fusion form. Second, it has been hypothesized

222

that cleavage of S antigen into S1 and S2 subunits is part of the transition from the pre-fusion to

223

post-fusion form during viral entry19 . Thus, by blocking the furin cleavage site, we have added

224

another layer for prevention of pre-fusion to post-fusion conversion.

225
226

The two GSAS containing mutants (GSAS and double mutant 2P/GSAS) resulted in nAb titers

227

that trended higher than the WT and 2P analogues (Fig. 1c). While the nAb levels from these

228

two GSAS-containing antigens were not significantly different from one another, we believe

229

there could be two explanations for this: first, the mutation on the furin cleavage site may alter S

230

protein trafficking efficiency to the cell surface. Furin could be active in the trans-golgi network,

231

cell surface or endosome in processing viral glycoproteins during viral maturation 49. Thus, it is

232

possible that blocking furin cleavage may have changed S protein trafficking from the ER to the

233

cell surface. Although this hypothesis is unlikely, MERS and SARS, as well as other coronavirus
11

234

S protein, have been reported to be missing a furin cleavage site, indicating that furin cleavage is

235

not absolutely necessary for viral maturation 26,27,30,35. Nonetheless, additional investigation

236

would be needed to further understand the effect of the furin cleavage site on viral

237

morphogenesis and SARS-CoV-2 S protein trafficking. A second possibility, which is more

238

likely, is that we tested the mRNA vaccines at a poorly differentiating dose level (0.4 µg/dose) in

239

mice (Fig. 1c). Our results in a subsequent experiment (Fig. 2) confirmed that the saturation

240

point for neutralizing antibody responses in mice was between 0.2 μg and 1 μg per dose. With

241

these considerations, we selected the double mutant formulation, MRT5500, to favor the pre-

242

fusion form. Our dose ranging studies in NHPs confirmed the potency of MRT5500 in eliciting

243

neutralizing antibodies. Although the sample size of our experiment (4 animals per group) was

244

not enough to discriminate between the dose regimens, it suggested the potential of MRT5500

245

vaccine candidate to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies in clinic.

246
247

The long-term durability of our vaccine candidates for COVID-19 across all modalities is still

248

under investigation. As a novel vaccine platform, mRNA can drive efficient de novo antigen

249

expression, which is expected to activate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether

250

the transient nature of antigen expression is sufficient in driving adequate germinal center

251

formation which is needed for effective expansion and maturation of antigen-specific B cells.

252

Although an mRNA vaccine for cytomegalovirus gB has demonstrated sustained antibody

253

responses in rabbits up to 20 weeks50, the durability for S antigen mRNA remains an important

254

focus for COVID-19 vaccine research. It should be noted that natural infection in COVID-19

255

patients, especially those of mild and asymptomatic cases, induce antibodies that decay rapidly

256

in convalescent phase, with some drifting down to baseline within three months after diagnosis 51.

257

Additional preclinical studies are ongoing to further our understanding and characterization of

258

MRT5500 and its immunological effects for applications towards COVID-19.

259
260

In summary, we have utilized mRNA technology for the rapid evaluation of vaccine candidates

for COVID-19, and our results led to the selection of a double mutant candidate which has a

262

better potential to preserve a pre-fusion conformation. The candidate MRT5500 has been shown

263

to be immunogenic by eliciting potent neutralizing antibodies in mice and NHPs, and T H1-biased

264

cellular immune responses. The candidate is positioned for further development in clinical

265

studies as a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.

Material and methods

272

mRNA synthesis, lipid nanoparticle formulation and expression assay

273

Messenger RNA incorporating coding sequences containing either the wild type (WT) sequence,

274

stabilized pre-fusion mutant (2P)52, furin cleavage site mutant (GSAS)35,53 or double mutant (2P,

275

GSAS) of the full length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were synthesized by in vitro

276

transcription employing RNA polymerase with a plasmid DNA template encoding the desired

277

gene using unmodified nucleotides. The resulting purified precursor mRNA was reacted further

278

via enzymatic addition of a 5’ cap structure (Cap 1) and a 3’ poly(A) tail of approximately 200

279

nucleotides in length as determined by gel electrophoresis. The vaccine sequence is based on

280

Wuhan Hu-1 strain (Genbank accession MN908947). Preparation of mRNA/lipid nanoparticle

281

(LNP) formulations was described previously 54. Briefly, an ethanolic solution of a mixture of

282

lipids (ionizable lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol-lipid) at a

283

fixed lipid and mRNA ratio were combined with an aqueous buffered solution of target mRNA

284

at an acidic pH under controlled conditions to yield a suspension of uniform LNPs. Upon

285

ultrafiltration and diafiltration into a suitable diluent system, the resulting nanoparticle

286

suspensions were diluted to final concentration, filtered and stored frozen at -80 oC until use.

287

Expression of S-proteins from cells transfected with synthetic mRNAs was evaluated by Western

288

blot. Briefly, 5X105 HEK293 cells were transfected using 1 µg of mRNA complexed with

289

Lipofectamine 2000, and allowed to incubate 20 hs at 37 oC. Cells were harvested after

290

incubation period, and lysates were analyzed by Western Blot as described elsewhere 55.

293

Animal experiments were carried out in compliance with all pertinent US National Institutes of

294

Health regulations and were conducted with approved animal protocols from the Institutional

295

Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the research facilities.

296

The mouse studies were conducted at Covance Inc, Denver, PA. Female specific pathogen free

297

BALB/c mice of 6-8-week-old were vaccinated in groups of 10, with 50 µL of the designated

298

mRNA/LNP formulation into one hind leg for the prime (D0) and the contralateral hind leg for

299

the boost (D21). Sera were collected on D-7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 from the orbital sinus or by

300

exsanguination on D35 by the jugular vein/carotid artery. For cell-mediated response

301

measurements, splenocytes from mice were collected on D35.

302

Cynomolgus macaques of Mauritian origin 2-6 years of age and weighing in a range of 2-6 kg

303

were administered with 500 µL mRNA/LNP formulations via IM route into the deltoid of the

304

right forelimb for the prime (D0) and the opposite forelimb for the boost (D21). Sera were

305

collected on D-4, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and, PBMCs were isolated on D42. All immunizations and

306

blood draws occurred under sedation with Ketamine HCl (10mg/kg) or Telazol (4-8mg/kg IM).

307
308

Convalescent human sera

309

Convalescent serum panel (N=93) was obtained from commercial vendors (Sanguine Biobank,

310

iSpecimen and PPD). These subjects had a PCR positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and the serum

311

samples were collected within 3 months following diagnosis.

314

Nunc MaxiSorb plates were coated with SARS-CoV S-GCN4 protein (custom made at GeneArt)

315

protein at 0.5 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-Tween 0.1%

316

before blocking with 1% BSA in PBS-Tween 0.1% for 1 h at ambient temperature. Samples

317

were plated with 1:450 initial dilution followed by 3-fold, 7-point serial dilution in blocking

318

buffer. Plates were washed 3 times after 1-h incubation at room temperature before adding 50 μl

319

of 1:5000 Rabbit anti-human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research) to each well. Plates were

320

incubated at room temperature for 1hr and washed 3x. Plates were developed using Pierce 1-Step

321

Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution for 0.1 h and stopped by TMB stop solution. Plates were

322

read at 450 nm in SpectraMax plate reader. Antibody titers were reported as the highest dilution

323

that is ≥0.2 Optical Density (OD) cutoff.

324

For mouse sera, the procedure was similar except the following differences. First, 2019-nCoV

325

Spike protein (S1+S2) ectodomain (Sino Biological, Cat# 40589-V08B1) was used as substrate

326

and coated at 2 µg/mL concentration in bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4°C. Second, the plates

327

were developed using colorimetric substrate, Sure Blue TMB 1-component (SERA CARE, KPL

328

Cat# 5120-0077) and stopped by Stop solution (SERA CARE Sure Blue, KPL Cat# 5120-0024).

329

The endpoint antibody titer for each sample was determined as the highest dilution which gave

330

OD value 3x higher than the background.

331
332

Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay

333

Serum samples were diluted 1:4 in media (FluoroBrite phenol red free DMEM +10% FBS

334

+10mM HEPES +1% PS + 1% Glutamax) and heat inactivated at 56°C for 0.5 h. A further, 2-

335

fold serial dilution of the heat inactivated serum were prepared and mixed with the reporter virus

336

particle (RVP) -GFP (Integral Molecular) diluted to contain 300 infectious particles per well and

337

incubated for 1 h at 37°C. 96-well plates of 50% confluent 293T-hsACE2 clonal cells in 75 μL

338

volume were inoculated with 50 μL of the serum/virus mixtures and incubated at 37°C for 72h.

339

At the end of the incubation, plates were scanned on a high-content imager and individual GFP

340

expressing cells were counted. The inhibitory dilution titer (ID 50) was reported as the reciprocal

341

of the dilution that reduced the number of virus plaques in the test by 50%. ID 50 for each test

342

sample was interpolated by calculating the slope and intercept using the last dilution with a

343

plaque number below the 50% neutralization point and the first dilution with a plaque number

344

above the 50% neutralization point. ID50 Titer = (50% neutralization point - intercept)/slope).

345
346

Microneutralization assay

347

Serial two-fold dilutions of heat inactivated serum samples were incubated with a challenge dose

348

targeting 100 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50) of SARS-CoV-2 (strain USA-

349

WA1/2020 [BEI Resources; catalog# NR-52281]) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 1 hour (h). The

350

serum-virus mixtures were inoculated into wells of a 96-well microplate with preformed Vero E6

351

(ATCC® CRL-1586TM) cell monolayers and adsorbed at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 0.5

352

h. Additional assay media was added to all wells without removing the existing inoculum and

353

incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 2 days. After washing and fixation of the Vero E6 cell

354

monolayers, SARS-CoV-2 antigen production in cells was detected by successive incubations

355

with an anti-SARS-CoV nucleoprotein mouse monoclonal antibody (Sino Biological catalog#

356

40143-MM05), HRP IgG conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, catalog #115-035-

357

062), and a chromogenic substrate. The resulting optical density (OD) was measured using a

358

microplate reader. The reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, as compared to that in the virus

359

control wells, constitutes a positive neutralization reaction indicating the presence of neutralizing

360

antibodies in the serum sample. The 50% neutralization titer (MN 50) was defined as the

361

reciprocal of the serum dilution for which the virus infectivity was reduced by 50% relative to

362

the virus control on each plate. The MN50 for each sample was interpolated by calculating the

363

slope and intercept using the last dilution with an OD below the 50% neutralization point and the

364

first dilution with an OD above the 50% neutralization point; MN50 Titer = (OD of 50%

365

neutralization point - intercept)/slope.

Cytokine ELISPOT analysis

368

For testing cytokine responses in mice CTL ELISPOT kits (Mouse IFN-γ/IL-5 Double-Color

369

enzymatic ELISPOT, Immunospot) were used according to the manufacture’s protocols. Briefly,

370

freshly isolated splenocytes were resuspended in CTL-Test Media and incubated overnight at

371

300,000 cells per well with commercially available SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pools. PepMix™

372

SARS-CoV-2 (Spike Glycoprotein, Cat# PM-WCPV-S-1, JPT, Germany) peptide pool 1 and

373

pool 2 were used at the final concentration of 2 µg/ml per well. Concanavalin A (CovA, Sigma

374

C5275) at concentration of 1 µg/ml was used for a positive control stimulation. After overnight

375

incubation, the plates were washed and developed per manufacturer instructions. Spots were

376

scanned and analyzed by the CTL technical team. The number of cytokines producing cells per

377

million cells was reported.

378

For testing cytokine responses in NHPs Monkey IFNɣ ELISPOT (CTL, cat# 3421M-4APW) and

379

IL-13 ELISPOT kits (CTL, cat# 3470M-4APW) were used. Previously frozen PBMCs were

380

washed, resuspended in culture medium provided by the kit and enumerated. PepMix™ SARS-

381

CoV-2 peptide pools as well as CovA were used for stimulation as described above. PBMC were

382

plated at 300,000 cells per well and stimulated overnight. After overnight incubation the plates

383

were washed and developed per manufacturer instructions. The plates were dried overnight,

384

scanned, and spots were counted using a CTL analyzer (Immunospot S6 Universal Analyzer,

385

CTL). The data were reported as spot forming cells (SFC) per million PBMCs.

386

Statistical analysis

387

Data were log-10 transformed prior to statistical analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided, and

388

the nominal level of statistical significance was set to α=5%. All analyses were performed on

389

SEG SAS v9.4®. Statistical comparisons among different groups (different dose levels or

390

constructs in a particular study) or between D35 and pre-bleed were conducted using mixed

391

effect model for repeated measures, the model included group, day and their interactions, where

392

day was specified as repeated measures.

393

When assessing pairwise correlations among IgG, MN, PsVNa in NHP study, we proposed a

394

two-stage approach to separate the intra-and inter-variabilities for the repeated measures. Stage

395

1: we calculated the correlation coefficient for each individual subject based on observations

396

over time per subject; Stage 2: we then estimated the mean and 95% CI of group correlation

397

coefficient based on individual coefficient estimates. The analysis was based on log 10

398

transformed data.

399

Statistical comparisons among different groups (i.e. different dose levels) and the convalescent

400

sera on D35 were conducted using either analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Wilcoxon Rank Sum

401

Test.
