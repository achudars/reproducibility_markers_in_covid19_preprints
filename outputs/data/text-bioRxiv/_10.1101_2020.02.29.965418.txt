Abstract
In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe
the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host. Chest radiograph score data are used
to estimate the parameters of that model. Our result shows that the
basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth is around 3.79.
Using the same method we also estimate the basic reproductive number
of MERS virus is 8.16 which is higher than SARS-CoV-2. The PRCC
method is used to analyze the sensitivities of model parameters and the
drug effects on virus growth are also implemented to analyze the model.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; MERS; differential equation model; basic
reproductive number.

Introduction

At the end of 2019, a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, began to threaten
the people in China, especially in Hubei province. As of March.3, 2020, 80302
individuals have been confirmed to be infected by this virus in China, including
2946 deaths. To mitigate the spread of the virus, the Chinese Government has
progressively implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine in Wuhan and several
nearby cities from Jan 23–24, 2020 [18]. The virus has also spread to several
other countries, such as the Republic of Korea, Japan, Italy, and USA. Around
the world, many new deaths are reported every day.
Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID19 [14], which is the name of that new coronavirus caused disease [17]. Before
Feb.13, the new cases in China were confirmed by nucleic acid testing. After
that day, the diagnostic criterion has been improved, composed of not only the

nucleic acid testing but also the CT test. The destructed pulmonary parenchyma
and the resulting inflammation can be reflected from the chest radiograph [13].
Chest radiograph score method is a useful way to quantify the destruction of
pulmonary parenchyma and in this study, our data set is based on this.
Several works are [7,18] nowcasting and forecasting the number of confirmed
cases of COVID-19. Meanwhile, some works [6,15] overview the characteristics,
exposure history, and illness timelines of confirmed cases. All of these works
focus on population dynamics of COVID-19, while, the works about the viral
dynamics in host are rare. In this work, we use the within-host viral dynamic
model [1, 11] to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host and the parameters
of that model are estimated via the chest radiograph score. Moreover, using the
CT score data of MERS that shown in Oh et. al [13], the paramters of MERS
virus are also estimated as a comparision group. All of the results are shown in
the third section.

Method

We use the following ordinary differential equation model to simulate the coronavirus within-lung growth:



dEp (t)


= dE Ep (0) − Ep (t) − βEp (t)v(t),


dt


 ∗
dEp (t)
(1)
= βEp (t)v(t) − dE ∗ Ep∗ (t),

dt





 dv(t) = πv Ep∗ (t) − dv v(t),
dt
where Ep (t), Ep∗ (t) and v(t) are the number of uninfected pulmonary epithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus. β is the infection
rate of virus, πv is the virus production rate, Ep (0) is the initial value of uninfected epithelial cells, and the term dE Ep (0) assumes a constant regeneration
of uninfected epithelial cells. dE , dE ∗ and dv are the death rate of uninfected
pulmonary epithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus, respectively. The death rate of Ep (t) is the natural clearance rate of pulmonary
epithelial cells, while, dE ∗ and dv are the combination of the natural clearance
rate and elimination by the immunity system. This model was also used to
describe the within-lung infection process of flu virus [5, 11].
By the definition of generation matrix of basic reproduction number R0 [3],
the R0 of model (1) can be written as,
R0 =

βπv Ep (0)
.
dE ∗ dv

(2)

This number is an important value to measure whether the epidemic or species
could die out or not [16]. In this study, the sensitivity analysis result of R0 is
shown in the next section.

In this study, the chest radiograph score data from serve patients (with high
chest radiograph scores) are collected from the work of Pan et. al [14] and
Oh et. al [13] Our estimation is based on these two data sets. We consider
the chest radiograph score as a way to reflect the infected pulmonary epithelial
cells [13, 14], which is also the target attacked by the immune cell [12]. Thus by
the Poisson distribution, the likelihood that used to extimate parameters can
be written as,



X
L=
Di log Ep∗ (ti ) − Ep∗ (ti ) − log Γ(Di + 1) ,

where Di is the smoothed chest radiograph score of the serve patient at time ti ,
Ep∗ (ti ) is the solution of Ep∗ (t) at time ti , and log Γ(x) is log-gamma function,
respectively. The prior distributions of the parameters of model (1) are based
on the previous works [5, 10].

which is larger than the clearance rate of the virus on the outside surface [4].
This result shows the immune system can clear the virus directly. The estimation result also shows that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in serve patients is around the
mean value 3.79 which is lower than that of MERS virus (8.16). These results
illustrate that the immune system can not clear the virus effectively at the beginning time of symptom onset. By these estimated parameters of COVID-19,
the solutions of model (1) are illustrated in Figure .2.

and (b) MERS. The dark line is the mean value of fitted result, while, the 95%
confidence interval is shown in blue. The black points are the chest radiograph
score data.
The partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) method [9] is used to do
the sensitivity analysis of R0 . The result (Figure .3) shows that the parameters Ep (0), β, πv , dE ∗ , and dv have almost the same level of influence on R0 .
Parameters dE ∗ , and dv have negative correlations with R0 , while Ep (0), β, πv
have positive correlations. The positive correlation of Ep (0) with R0 may give a
explanation on why the babys, who have small amount of pulmonary epithelial
cells, are not likely to get infected and have lower mortality ( [15] Table 1).
Drug therapy is also a topic discussed widely on viral dynamics [1]. For
the coronavirus there are some drugs that may have a positive influence on
decreasing the virus load [8]. In this study, we assume that the drug can drop
the infection rate β to 0.1β, and the simulated results are shown in Figure .4.
These results show that the earlier to give an effective drug to a serve patient,
the better to relieve symptoms.

Discussion

Based on the chest radiograph data, we estimate the parameters and basic
reproductive number of the model (1). The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in host growth
is 3.79, which is higher than HCV (2.3, [2]), but lower than the flu virus (23, [10]).
Comparing the estimated parameters of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS coronavirus,
the MERS have a higher virulence to infect the pulmonary epithelial cells (larger
R0 ) and with a small initial value of infected cell. These may esplain why the
MERS have a higher mortality and smaller incubation period [6, 13]. By the
PRCC method, the sensitivity analysis is also done on the R0 , and the positive
correlation of Ep (0) with R0 may give a possible reason why the baby patients
are less likely to die of this virus. We also analyze the drug therapy and its
effect on the virus growth, and the result illustrates that early medication is
effective for treatment.
The methods we used in this study are following the previous works by
Miao et. al [10,11]. This is the first time for this methodology to be used in the
COVID-19 and our work shows some new results of the within-host properties
of this virus. All of the source codes are available at the GitHub (https:
//github.com/ChentongLi/SARS-CoV-2_viral_kinetic). Anyone could use
these codes to estimate and forecast the chest radiograph score of the patients.
The major limitation of this study is that the chest radiograph score is not
the real data of the infected pulmonary epithelial cells but just an approximation. Moreover, we assume that the immunne effect on viruses and infected
epithelial cells are constant values. This is because the data of antibody and
effective CD8 cells of that virus are rarely known. If we could get more accurate
data, the results will be much better.
We believe this study could give some help to the diagnosis and treatment
of the COVID-19. For other disease that infect the lung, this method we believe
also could be used to do analysis.
