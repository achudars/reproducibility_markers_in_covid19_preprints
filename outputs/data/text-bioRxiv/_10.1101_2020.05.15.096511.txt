Broadly protective vaccines against known and pre-emergent coronaviruses are urgently
needed. Critical to their development is a deeper understanding of cross-neutralizing
antibody responses induced by natural human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. Here, we
mined the memory B cell repertoire of a convalescent SARS donor and identified 200
SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies that target multiple conserved sites on the spike (S)
protein. A large proportion of the antibodies display high levels of somatic hypermutation
and cross-react with circulating HCoVs, suggesting recall of pre-existing memory B cells
(MBCs) elicited by prior HCoV infections. Several antibodies potently cross-neutralize
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the bat SARS-like virus WIV1 by blocking receptor
attachment and inducing S1 shedding. These antibodies represent promising candidates for
therapeutic intervention and reveal a new target for the rational design of pansarbecovirus vaccines.

In December 2019, a novel pathogen emerged in the city of Wuhan in China’s Hubei
province, causing an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (a disease known as COVID-19). The
infectious agent was rapidly characterized as a lineage B betacoronavirus, named Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and shown to be closely related to SARSCoV and several SARS-like bat CoVs(1). Despite the urgent need, there are currently no
approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the recurrent zoonotic spillover of CoVs into humans, along with the broad
diversity of SARS-like CoV strains circulating in animal reservoirs, suggests that novel
pathogenic CoVs are likely to emerge in the future and underscores the need for broadly active
countermeasures.
CoV entry into host cells is mediated by the viral S glycoprotein, which forms trimeric
spikes on the viral surface(2). Each monomer in the trimeric S assembly is a heterodimer of S1
and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit is composed of four domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD), a
C-terminal domain (CTD), and subdomains I and II(3-5). The CTD of both SARS-CoV and

SARS-CoV-2 functions as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for the shared entry receptor,
human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)(6-10). The S2 subunit contains the fusion
peptide, heptad repeat 1 and 2, and a transmembrane domain, all of which are required for fusion
of the viral and host cell membranes.
The S glycoprotein of human CoVs (HCoVs) is the primary target for neutralizing
antibodies (nAbs)(11). Given that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share about 80% amino acid
identity in their S proteins, one important immunological question concerns the immunogenicity
of conserved surfaces on these antigens. Studies of convalescent sera and a limited number of
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revealed limited to no cross-neutralizing activity,
demonstrating that conserved antigenic sites are rarely targeted by nAbs(5, 9, 12). However, the
frequencies, specificities, and functional activities of cross-reactive antibodies induced by natural
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly defined.
In this study, we aimed to comprehensively profile the cross-reactive B cell response
induced by SARS-CoV infection by cloning an extensive panel of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive
mAbs from the peripheral B cells of a convalescent donor (Donor 84) who survived the 2003
SARS outbreak. To isolate cross-reactive antibodies, we stained purified B cells with a panel of
memory B cell (MBC) markers and a fluorescently labeled recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
Flow cytometric analysis revealed that 0.14% of class-switched MBCs were SARS-CoV-2 Sreactive, which was about 3-fold over background staining observed with a SARS-CoV-naïve
donor sample (Fig. 1A). Notably, the frequency of antigen-specific MBCs was higher than
expected, given the long interval between infection and blood draw (17 years) and previous
studies showing waning of SARS-CoV-specific MBCs to undetectable levels within 6 years(13).
Cognate antibody heavy- and light-chain pairs were rescued from 315 individual SARS-CoV-2reactive B cells by single-cell RT-PCR and subsequently cloned and expressed as full-length
IgGs in an engineered strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(14). Of the 315 cloned antibodies, 200
bound to SARS-CoV-2 S in preliminary binding screens (Fig. 1B). Sequence analysis revealed
that about half of the clones were members of expanded clonal lineages, whereas the other half
were unique (Fig. 1C). This result is in stark contrast to numerous studies of other primary viral
infections reporting very limited clonal expansion within virus-specific MBC repertoires(15-18).
Moreover, about 30% of isolated antibodies displayed convergent VH1-69/VK2-30 germline
gene pairing (Fig. 1C). As expected, almost all the antibodies were somatically mutated, with

members of clonally expanded lineages showing significantly higher levels of somatic
hypermutation (SHM) compared to unique clones (Fig. 1D). Finally, consistent with the
respiratory nature of SARS-CoV infection, index sorting analysis revealed that 33% of binding
antibodies originated from IgA+ MBCs and the remaining 66% from IgG+ MBCs (Fig. 1E). We
conclude that SARS-CoV infection elicited a high frequency of long-lived, cross-reactive MBCs
in this donor.
We next measured the apparent binding affinities (KDApps) of the antibodies to prefusionstabilized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins(5). Although the majority of antibodies (153
out of 200) showed binding to both S proteins, a subset appeared to be SARS-CoV-2 S-specific
(Fig. 2A). This result was unexpected given that the antibodies were isolated from a SARS-CoVexperienced donor and may relate to differences between the infecting SARS-CoV strain and the
recombinant SARS-CoV S protein (Tor2) used for the binding studies. Alternatively, this result
may be due to inherent differences in the stability or antigenicity of recombinant prefusionstabilized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Indeed, about 30% of antibodies that failed
to bind recombinant SARS-CoV S displayed reactivity with SARS-CoV S expressed on the
surface of transfected cells, providing some evidence for differences in the antigenicity of
recombinant and cell-expressed forms of S (Fig. S1).
Paradoxically, most of the highly mutated and clonally expanded antibodies bound
weakly (KDApps >10 nM) to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 2B). We sought to
determine if these antibodies originated from pre-existing MBCs that were induced by prior
exposures to naturally circulating HCoVs, which share up to 32% amino acid identity with
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in their S proteins. Accordingly, we assessed binding of the
antibodies to recombinant S proteins of naturally circulating human alphacoronaviruses (HCoVNL63 and HCoV-229E) and betacoronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1). Over 80% of
the low affinity (KDApps >10 nM) SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies showed
reactivity with one or more of the HCoV S proteins, suggesting SARS-CoV infection may have
boosted a pre-existing MBC response induced by circulating HCoVs (Fig. 2B). Alternatively,
circulating HCoV infections experienced by this donor after the SARS-CoV infection may have
expanded this cross-reactive MBC pool. Consistent with this hypothesis, the broadly crossreactive antibodies showed significantly higher levels of SHM and clonal expansion compared to
those that only recognized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2B-D). Furthermore, 72% of the

broadly binding antibodies utilized VH1-69/VK2-30 germline gene pairing, suggesting germlinemediated recognition of a common antigenic site (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2). Index sorting analysis
revealed that the majority of the broadly cross-reactive antibodies were derived from IgA+
MBCs, indicating a mucosal origin, whereas most of the SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive antibodies originated from IgG+ MBCs (Fig. 2E). Finally, the vast majority of crossreactive antibodies lacked polyreactivity, demonstrating that their broad binding activity is not
due to non-specific cross-reactivity (Fig. S3).
To investigate whether the above results were due to an “original antigenic sin” (OAS)
phenomenon, or rather simply due to avid binding of circulating HCoV-specific B cell receptors
to the SARS-CoV-2 S tetramers used for cell sorting, we assessed whether similarly broadly
binding antibodies were also present in SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-naïve donors that had been
exposed to endemic HCoVs. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples
from three healthy adult donors with serological evidence of circulating HCoV exposure and no
history of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection, and stained the corresponding B cells with a
fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 S probe (Fig. S4A). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that
between 0.06-0.12% of total B cells in the three naïve donors displayed SARS-CoV-2 reactivity
(Fig. S4B). Over 350 SARS-CoV-2-reactive MBCs were sorted and amplified by single-cell RTPCR, and 141 VH/VL pairs were cloned and expressed as full-length IgGs. Although a limited
number of SARS-CoV-2 S binding antibodies were isolated from all three naïve donors, they
displayed significantly lower levels of SHM, clonal expansion, and binding affinities for both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S compared to the cross-reactive antibodies identified from the
convalescent SARS donor (Fig. 2F-G and Fig. S4C). Altogether, these results suggest that
SARS-CoV infection likely led to the activation and expansion of pre-existing cross-reactive
MBCs induced by circulating HCoV exposure in this donor.
To map the antigenic sites recognized by the SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive
antibodies, we performed a series of binding experiments using a panel of recombinant S protein
subunits and individual domains. Due to the inherent technical challenges associated with
measuring binding of low affinity antibodies to monomeric proteins, we analyzed only the 64
high affinity binders (KDApps<10 nM) to SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 2A, B). We first evaluated binding
to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 subunits and observed that 75% of the antibodies
recognized epitopes within S1, whereas the remaining 25% bound to epitopes within S2 (Fig.

3A). Interestingly, two of the S2-directed antibodies also showed strong reactivity with OC43 S,
suggesting recognition of a highly conserved antigenic site (Fig. S5). We next evaluated the 49
S1-directed antibodies for reactivity with individual SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NTD domains and
found that 21 (43%) and 28 (57%) of the S1-specific antibodies recognized the RBD and NTD,
respectively (Fig. 3A).
To further define the epitopes recognized by the RBD-directed antibodies, we performed
competitive binding studies with recombinant hACE2 and a previously described antibody,
CR3022, that targets a conserved epitope that is distinct from the receptor binding site (Fig. 3B
and Fig. S6A)(19). Six of the antibodies competed only with hACE2, three competed only with
CR3022, four competed with both hACE2 and CR3022, and seven did not compete with hACE2
or CR3022 (Fig. 3B). Thus, these antibodies delineate at least four adjacent and potentially
overlapping sites within the RBD. Importantly, antibodies that competed with recombinant
hACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the biolayer interferometry assay also interfered with
binding of full-length SARS-CoV-2 S to endogenous ACE2 expressed on the surface of Vero E6
cells (Fig. 3C). In summary, SARS-CoV infection elicited high affinity cross-reactive antibodies
to a range of antigenic sites within both the S1 and S2 subunits.
To evaluate the neutralization activities of the SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies, we
performed neutralization assays using both murine leukemia virus (MLV)- and vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotype systems as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2. Due to the
large number of antibodies, initial neutralization screening was performed in the authentic virus
assay using a single concentration of purified IgG. Only nine out of 200 antibodies displayed
neutralizing activity at the 100 nM concentration tested, eight of which targeted the RBD and the
remaining one recognized the NTD (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed in the VSV-based
pseudovirus assay (Fig. S7). Of the eight RBD-directed nAbs, four targeted epitopes overlapping
with both hACE2 and CR3022 and the other four recognized epitopes only overlapping that of
hACE2, suggesting the existence of two partially overlapping neutralizing epitopes within the
RBD (Fig. 3B). Neutralization titration studies revealed that the half maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50s) of the RBD-directed nAbs ranged from 0.05-1.4 µg/ml against SARSCoV-2 and 0.004-0.06 µg/ml against SARS-CoV in the MLV assay (Fig. 3E and Fig. S8). The
SARS-CoV-2 neutralization IC50s observed in the MLV assay were within 1.5- to 5-fold of those

observed in the authentic virus neutralization assay (Fig. S8 and Fig. S9). In contrast, the VSVSARS-CoV-2 neutralization potencies were substantially elevated (8- to 35-fold) compared to
those observed for live SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the need for standardized pseudovirus
neutralization assays for the assessment of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S8 and Fig. S9). To
determine breadth of neutralization against representative pre-emergent SARS-like bat CoVs, we
also carried out neutralization assays against WIV1-CoV using a classic plaque reduction
assay(20). All eight antibodies neutralized WIV1-CoV with PRNT50s ranging from 0.076-1.7
µg/ml, demonstrating their breadth of activity (Fig. 3E and Fig. S10). Crucially, none of the
antibodies left an un-neutralized viral fraction in any of the assays (Fig. S8 and Fig. S10).
Unexpectedly, we observed little to no correlation between binding affinity for WT
SARS-CoV-2 cell surface S and neutralizing activity. For example, all of the S2-directed
antibodies and a subset of NTD-directed antibodies bound with high affinity to both recombinant
and cell surface S, but none were neutralizing (Fig. 3F). Similarly, the RBD-directed antibodies
targeting epitopes outside of the hACE2 binding site showed little to no neutralizing activity,
despite binding with similar affinity to cell surface S compared to many of the hACE2
competitor nAbs (Fig. 3F and Fig. S11). Although the reason(s) for the discrepancy between
binding and neutralization are not yet clear, it is possible that the high affinity non-neutralizing
antibodies recognize non-functional forms of S presented on the viral surface, as observed for
many HIV non-neutralizing antibodies(21). Additionally, dissociation of the S1 subunit
following receptor engagement may impede the ability of non-receptor blocking RBD- and
NTD-directed antibodies to neutralize infection(22). Surprisingly, even within the group of
hACE2-blocking nAbs, we did not observe a strong correlation between binding to cell surfaceor recombinant-S and neutralizing activity, suggesting that antibody potency is governed at least
in part by factors beyond binding affinity (Fig. 3F and Fig. S12). To determine whether the
hACE2 competitor antibodies neutralized by inducing S1 shedding and premature S
triggering(23), we incubated HEK-293 cells expressing WT SARS-CoV-2 S with saturating
concentrations of antibody and measured the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of antibody
binding over time by flow cytometry. Indeed, all of the hACE2 blocking antibodies showed
significantly decreased binding over time, consistent with induced S1 dissociation, whereas
antibodies recognizing the NTD, S2 stem, and RBD epitopes outside of the hACE2 binding site
displayed either no change or an increase in binding over the course of the experiment (240

minutes) (Fig. 3G). We conclude that SARS-CoV infection induces high affinity cross-reactive
antibodies to multiple distinct antigenic sites on the S protein, but neutralizing activity is
primarily restricted to RBD-directed antibodies that interfere with receptor binding and promote
S1 dissociation.
To structurally characterize the epitopes recognized by the RBD-directed nAbs, we
performed negative stain electron microscopy (EM) to observe each of these Fabs bound to the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Many of the 2D class averages that we obtained displayed obvious
heterogeneity in the number Fabs that were bound to a single S trimer, which is likely due to
dynamic inaccessibility of RBD epitopes and sub-stoichiometric binding of S at the low protein
concentrations used to prepare grids (Fig. 4A)(5, 24). The 3D reconstructions of these complexes
support the results of our biophysical competition assays and show that the RBD-directed nAbs
recognize an overlapping patch on the solvent-exposed surface of the RBD. ADI-55689, which
potently neutralizes and competes with hACE2, appears to bind at the edge of the hACE2
binding site, close to the more structurally conserved core domain of the RBD, without
overlapping with the CR3022 epitope (Fig. 4B). ADI-56046, which exemplifies the group of
antibodies that competes with both hACE2 and CR3022, binds slightly farther away from the
flexible tip of the RBD and thus its epitope spans both the hACE2 binding site and the CR3022
epitope (Fig 4C). In summary, our structural analysis suggests that all of the nAbs recognize a
single patch on the surface of the RBD with overlapping footprints. Given that these antibodies
potently cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and WIV1 suggests that this antigenic
surface exhibits a high degree of conservation among the SARS-like coronaviruses.
In conclusion, we show that the cross-reactive human B cell response to SARS-CoV is
composed of a broad diversity of clones that target multiple epitopes within the RBD, NTD, and
S2 stem region. Unexpectedly, a large proportion of the antibodies in our panel displayed high
levels of SHM, clonal expansion, and cross-reactivity with circulating HCoV S proteins,
suggesting that SARS-CoV infection may have boosted a pre-existing MBC response induced by
circulating HCoV exposure. This result is reminiscent of the phenomenon of “original antigenic
sin” (OAS), whereby the primary viral exposure leaves an immunological imprint that shapes
future immune responses to antigenically related viruses. OAS was first described in the context
of repeated influenza exposures(25, 26), and more recently during secondary dengue
infections(27, 28), but to our knowledge OAS has not been previously reported for CoVs. The

OAS-phenotype antibodies described here show overall weak binding affinities for SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 S and universally lack neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, indicating
that the corresponding serum antibody specificities are unlikely to mediate protection against
these viruses or other SARS-like CoVs. Additionally, given previous reports suggesting the
potential for antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection in NHPs and feline
infectious peritonitis virus in cats(29, 30), it will be important to investigate whether these nonneutralizing cross-reactive antibodies have any impact on SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis. Future studies will be required to elucidate the role of pre-existing CoV immunity
in modulating the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and the potential impact on disease
outcome.
The potent cross-neutralizing antibodies described here bind to conserved epitopes
overlapping the hACE2 binding site, thus illuminating this antigenic surface as a promising
target for the rational design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. For example, the RBD epitope(s)
defined by this class of antibodies could be presented on conformationally stable protein
scaffolds to focus the antibody response on this site, as previously demonstrated for the
motavizumab epitope on RSV F(31). Furthermore, the nAbs themselves, alone or in
combination, represent promising candidates for prophylaxis or therapy of SARS, COVID-19,
and potentially future diseases caused by new emerging SARS-like viruses.

Figure 1. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific IgGs. (A) Frequency of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive
B cells in Donor 84 and a negative control SARS-CoV-naïve donor. Fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) plots shown are gated on CD19+CD20+IgD—IgM— B cells. SARS-CoV-2 S was
labeled with two different colors to reduce background binding. The percentage shown in the
gate indicates the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive B cells among CD19+CD20+IgD—IgM—
B cells. (B) Binding of 315 isolated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S, as determined by biolayer
interferometry (BLI). The solid line indicates the threshold used for designating binders (0.1
RUs). (C) Clonal lineage analysis. Each lineage is represented as a segment proportional to the
lineage size. Clones that that utilize VH1-69/VK2-30 germline gene pairing are shown in blue.
The total number of isolated antibodies is shown in the center of the pie. Clonal lineages were
defined based on the following criteria: identical VH and VL germline genes, identical CDR H3
length, and CDR H3 amino acid identity ≥80%. (D) Load of somatic mutations, expressed as

competitive binding profiles of the RBD-directed antibodies (top) and percent neutralization of
authentic SARS-CoV-2 at a 100 nM concentration (bottom). (C) Antibody inhibition of SARSCoV-2 S binding to endogenous ACE2 expressed on Vero E6 cells, as determined by flow
cytometry. Antibodies were mixed with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S expressing a Twin-Streptag at a molar ratio of 5:1 before adding to Vero E6 cells. Strep-Tactin-PE was used to detect the
relative intensity of SARS-CoV-2 S binding to cell-surface ACE2. An anti-ebolavirus antibody
(KZ52) was used as an isotype control. The “no antigen” control shown in the right panel
indicates secondary-only staining. Percent binding shown in the right panel was normalized to
isotype control. (D) Percent authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization observed in the presence of
100 nM antibody. Antibodies are grouped according to epitope specificity. RBD-directed
antibodies that compete or do not compete with ACE2 are designed as ACE2 and non-ACE2,
respectively. (E) Antibody neutralization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 MLV pseudovirus
(strain n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020) using HeLa-ACE2 target cells, and antibody neutralization of
authentic WIV1-CoV using Vero E6 target cells. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 IC50s and
WIV1-CoV PRNT50s are reported in µg/ml. (F) Binding EC50s for cell-surface SARS-CoV-2 S
are plotted against percent neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 at 100 nM. Background
binding was assessed using mock transfected HEK293 cells. Data points are colored according to
epitope specificity. RBD-directed antibodies are further categorized based on their competition
group: hACE2, antibodies that only compete with hACE2; CR3022, antibodies that only
compete with CR3022; hACE2/CR3022, antibodies that compete with hACE2 and CR3022;
Other, antibodies that do not compete with hACE2 or CR3022. (G) Antibody binding activity to
cell-surface SARS-CoV-2 S over time, as determined by flow cytometry. IgGs were incubated
with cells expressing WT SARS-CoV-2 at 37°C and aliquots were placed on ice at the indicated
time points. Binding MFI was assessed at 240 min for all samples. CR3022 is included for
comparison. Curves are colored by epitope specificity, as in (F).
