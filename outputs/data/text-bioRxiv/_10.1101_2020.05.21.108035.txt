Abstract

19

The scientific community has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by rapidly undertaking

20

research to find effective strategies to reduce the burden of this disease. Encouragingly,

21

researchers from a diverse array of fields are collectively working towards this goal. Research

22

with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is undertaken in high containment laboratories, however, it is

23

often desirable to work with samples at lower containment levels. To facilitate the transfer of

24

infectious samples from high containment laboratories, we have tested methods commonly

25

used to inactivate virus and prepare the sample for additional experiments. Incubation at 80°C,

26

and a range of detergents and UV energies were successful at inactivating a high titre of

27

SARS-CoV-2. These protocols can provide a framework for in house inactivation of SARS-

28

CoV-2 in other laboratories, ensuring the safe use of samples in lower containment levels.

Introduction

31

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

32

emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread to the rest of the world in a few

33

months causing a pandemic (1,2). This virus causes the coronavirus disease, known as

34

COVID-19, in humans and as of May 17, 2020, has infected almost 5,000,000 people and

35

caused over 300,000 deaths (3). Research on SARS-CoV-2 has increased exponentially since

36

the beginning of the pandemic and will likely continue growing until an effective vaccine is

37

developed. In the UK, and many other countries, SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a hazard group

38

3 pathogen. For handling clinical samples and performing experiments involving SARS-CoV-

39

2 and other viruses in general, inactivation methods are needed in order to work under safe

40

conditions. Additionally, the inactivation of the virus allows the transfer of the material from a

41

containment level (CL) 3 to a CL2 laboratory, facilitating the performance of experiments and

42

increasing the number of laboratories and researchers that can perform those experiments.

43

Several methods of inactivation are available, but since this is a novel virus, the effectiveness

44

of many of these methods on SARS-CoV-2 has not been tested yet. Some inactivation

45

approaches have been tested on SARS-CoV, a coronavirus which spread between November

46

2002 and September 2003 and whose genome presents a 80% shared identity with the new

47

SARS-CoV-2 (4). It is expected that the outcome of both physical and chemical inactivation

48

methods used against SARS-CoV-2 will be similar to SARS-CoV, but methods need to be

49

validated prior to use of the new virus isolate.

50
51

Several methods for virus inactivation are available and the choice of which approach is used

52

is often related to their compatibility with downstream applications. Heat inactivation has been

53

used for several viruses (5,6) and is a common method employed for antigen preservation of

54

viral and bacterial pathogens. To preserve proteins in the sample that are related to host

55

immune response, detergents and UV can be used to inactivate viruses (7,8). Detergents are

56

common additives in reagents used for virus inactivation, as well as RNA extraction from a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.108035; this version posted May 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

57

range of sample types. UV irradiation, which inactivates viruses by modifying their nucleic acid

58

structure, has been used successfully to inactivate many viruses, and in particular SARS-CoV

59

(9). Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 through the use of UV would allow the safe use of the virus

60

within a CL2 laboratory and prevent the possibility of lab-acquired infections. Here we aim to

61

assess and describe physical and chemical inactivation protocols of SARS-CoV-2.

62
63

Materials and Methods

64

Cell culture and viruses

65

Vero E6 cells (C1008; African green monkey kidney cells) were obtained from Public Health

66

England and maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10%

67

fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.05 mg/mL gentamycin at 37°C with 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2

68

isolate REMRQ0001/Human/2020/Liverpool was cultured from a clinical sample and

69

passaged four times in Vero E6 cells. The fourth passage of virus was cultured in Vero E6

70

cells with DMEM containing 4% FBS and 0.05 mg/mL gentamycin at 37°C with 5% CO2 and

71

was harvested 48 hours post inoculation. Virus stocks were stored at -80°C.

72
73

Virus inactivation

74

All inactivation conditions were performed with 1.145 x 107 plaque forming units (PFU) of virus.

75

Heat inactivation was performed by incubating 300 µl of SARS-CoV-2 stock at 80°C for 1 hour.

76

Inactivation with detergents (0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5%

77

Tween 20, 0.5% NP-40) were incubated with virus for 30 minutes at room temperature. UV

78

inactivation was performed using a CL1000 UVP Crosslinker (UVP, Upland, CA, USA). The

79

CL-1000 UVP Crosslinker consisted of 5 x 254 nm shortwave tubes, which is the

80

recommended wavelength for neutralising viruses, in particular SARS-CoV (9). Virus stock

81

was added (250 µl) into wells of a 24-well plate and placed without its lid on top of an ice block

82

inside the crosslinker. Plates were placed exactly 6 cm from the UV bulbs. Inactivation was

83

performed at a range of UV energy exposures; 0.01 J/cm2 – 0.8 J/cm2. All inactivation

84

procedures were performed in triplicate, with the exception of NP-40 which was performed in

85

duplicate.

86
87

Virus viability and quantification

88

Heat treated samples were evaluated for viable virus in a TCID50 assay with Vero E6 cells,

89

using the entire volume of the sample. Control virus stocks containing 100, 101 and 102 PFU

90

incubated at room temperature for 1 hour were used to determine the limit of detection of the

91

assay. TCID50 plates were passaged onto fresh cells for 4 days at least twice to ensure no

92

replicative virus remained. Cells were monitored daily for cytopathic effect (CPE).

93
94

Inactivation treatments using SDS and Triton X-100 were added to 15 mL of DMEM in a

95

centrifugal concentrator (Amicon Ultra-15 100kDa MWCO) and centrifuged until £300 µl of

96

sample remained. Conditions with Tween 20 and NP-40 were diluted in 50 mL of PBS and

97

concentrated until £300 µl of sample remained. Sample was extracted and virus culture

98

medium was added to a final volume of 300 µl. Viable virus was evaluated in a TCID50 assay

99

as outlined above. Control virus stocks containing 100, 101 and 102 PFU were diluted in PBS

100

and followed the above protocol with centrifugal filters to determine the limit of detection of the

101

assay.

102
103

Plaque assays and TCID50 assays were performed on untreated virus stocks and on UV

104

inactivated stocks in parallel. TCID50 plates were passaged onto fresh cells for 3 days at least

105

twice to ensure no replicative virus remained. TCID50 results were calculated using the

106

Spearman and Karber method as previously described (10).

Results

109

We first determined the limits of sensitivity for our detection method by quantifying SARS-

110

CoV-2 at 100, 101, or 102 PFU using TCID50 assays. This was done by quantifying viral titres

111

directly, or by passing the sample through a centrifugal column, which is used to remove the

112

inactivation agent before assaying on cells. Virus prepared without the centrifugal column was

113

detected down to dilutions of 100 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1A). The limit of detection with

114

the centrifugal columns was determined to be 101 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1A).

We then quantified virus after inactivation. SARS-CoV-2 treated at 80°C for one hour was

125

successfully inactivated. We passaged samples a second time to confirmed complete viral

126

inactivation. Using detergents, complete inactivation was seen in all replicates of SDS, Triton

127

X-100 and NP-40, which we again confirmed by passaging the supernatant to a fresh

128

monolayer of cells to check for residual virus (Figure 1B). However, we found virus samples

129

treated with Tween 20 all remained infectious. At the 100 PFU dilution, CPE was observed in

130

2 of 3 replicates (Figure 1B), however virus was not detected in this dilution when using the

131

centrifugal columns for clean-up. CPE was seen in all other control wells for either treatment.

132
In order to determine if UV exposure at 254 nm would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, virus stocks

134

were placed in wells of a 24-well plate placed on ice and exposed to varying amounts of UV

135

energy (J/cm2). Exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to UV light at 0.01 J/cm2 resulted in partial

136

inactivation and this increased with greater UV energy exposure, resulting in complete

137

inactivation at UV energy exposures of more than 0.04 J/cm2 (Figure 2). A similar inactivation

138

curve was seen by both TCID50 and plaque assay. No CPE was evident in further passages

139

in samples where inactivation was observed.

Discussion

148

Virus inactivation can be achieved by several methods. However, specific methods must be

149

chosen to comply with requirements for subsequent downstream experiments. We used a

150

range of techniques that are often used for preserving antigens or immunological proteins to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.108035; this version posted May 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

151

evaluate their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, including a range of common detergents and

152

determining the threshold of inactivation by UV exposure. The assay to assess infectious

153

particles was also shown to be sensitive, in some cases down to a single infectious virus

154

particle, and down 10 infectious particles/mL where a centrifugal column is used to

155

concentrate the sample.

156
157

Physical inactivation can be performed using heat or exposure to UV. Heat inactivates the

158

virus by denaturing the structure of the proteins, affecting the attachment and replication of

159

the virus in the host cell (11). In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully inactivated with a

160

temperature of 80°C. Lower temperatures used to inactivate SARS-CoV showed that 56°C is

161

only effective in the absence of fetal calf serum and temperatures up to 75°C are needed for

162

successful inactivation of infected clinical samples (9,12). However, heat inactivation is not

163

recommended in a clinical setting for immunological assays since it can interfere with the

164

analysis of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (13) and diagnosis of patient samples using RT-

165

PCR, which could potentially lead to a false negative diagnosis (14,15).

166
167

UV light causes genetic damage by inducing pyrimidine dimers or by producing reactive

168

oxygen species (16). While other investigators have investigated UV inactivation of viruses by

169

looking at length of exposure, here we have inactivated virus based on the energy exposure.

170

As UV lamps age, their irradiance output begins to decline. The crosslinker in this study has

171

an inbuilt sensor allowing the unit to determine the exact amount of UV energy delivered.

172

Therefore, to maintain consistency in experiments over time, it is recommended to inactivate

173

virus based on the UV energy exposure rather than time of exposure. UVC exposure at 3 cm

174

for 15 minutes has been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV, whereas UVA light was not effective

175

(9,17). Here, we have demonstrated a method by which SARS-CoV-2 can be rendered non-

176

infectious through application of UV energy >0.04 J/cm2.

177
178

Chemical inactivation can be performed using detergents, and we successfully demonstrated

179

this with three different compounds: 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% NP-40.

180

Conversely, Tween 20 was unable to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 under the same conditions.

181

Detergents disrupt the lipid coat of enveloped viruses and are often present in lysis buffers of

182

commercial nucleic acid extraction kits. These detergents typically do not affect proteins so

183

they can be used in downstream procedures preserving their native structure. Our findings

184

are consistent with previous studies showed that 0.1% SDS with 0.1% NP-40 (9) and 0.3%

185

tri(n-butyl)phosphate (TNBP) with 1.0% Triton X-100 (8) could inactivate SARS-CoV. Recent

186

studies on SARS-CoV-2, showed that several lysis buffers from extraction kits like ATL (1-

187

10% SDS) and VXL (30-50% guanidine hydrochloride and 1-10% Triton X-100) from Qiagen

188

(14) and others containing guanidine hydrochloride (18) and guanidinium (19) inactivated the

189

virus. Several RNA extraction kits contain a lysis buffer effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2

190

(20). This is convenient for downstream experiments like qRT-PCR, used for diagnosis.

191

However, not all the laboratories may have access to these kits. The use of centrifugal

192

columns to remove cytotoxic compounds has also been successfully employed in this study,

193

correlating to previous results (5,21); however this raises the threshold of detection by

194

approximately 10 fold.

195
196

With the increasing interest in COVID-19, many researchers are now applying their knowledge

197

and expertise to different topics to address this global problem. However, not all researchers

198

have access to containment facilities and essential equipment is not often available at

199

biosafety levels required to work safely with SARS-CoV-2. The inactivation methods described

200

here will contribute to help to diverse research groups to perform their downstream work on

201

SARS-CoV-2.
