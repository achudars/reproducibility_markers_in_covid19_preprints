Abstract
SARS-coronavirus 2 is the causal agent of the COVID-19 outbreak. SARS-Cov-2 entry into a
cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage
of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are
crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the
lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of
disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and
affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes).
We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify
compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant
results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza
and later for Parkinson’s disease. It is available as a generic drug..
Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway ,
hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent
altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the
viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic
decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes.
Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19
infection.

Introduction
Recently a novel type of highly virulent beta-coronavirus was discovered in patients with
pneumonia of unknown cause. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as
detected by sequencing of the samples was found to be the cause of a severe respiratory disease
in humans1. The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a global epidemic with the number of
confirmed cased surpassing 722,000 in March 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome shares about
80% similarity with SARS-CoV and is even more similar (96%) to the bat coronavirus BatCoV
RaTG132. Coronaviruses are characterized by large genetic diversity and frequent recombination
of their genomes, hence pose a challenge in terms of public health, currently based on 1455 viral
genomes and predicted 24.5 genetic substitutions per year3.
Understanding the mechanism of action of the virus is a fundamental step in delineating
the optimal therapeutic agents. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-Cov-2 enters the cell by the means
of binding of cellular receptor(s) including the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
membrane bound protein4. ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in lungs, heart, kidneys
and intestine and decreased expression of ACE2 is associated with cardiovascular diseases2,5.
The structural basis for this recognition has been recently mapped out and the cryo-EM structure
of the full length viral spike protein that targets human ACE2 complex has been reported2. The
authors show that viral S protein binds ACE2 at least 10 times more tightly, when compared to
the spike protein of the previous SARS-CoV strain. The viral spike glycoprotein (S protein)
mediates receptor recognition6. Recently the 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the S protein
has been described6. The S protein is cleaved into two subunits: S1 and S2. This cleavage of S
proteins by host proteases is critical for viral infection2 and its exist from cell via lysosomes.
Host protease dependence of SARS-CoV-2 entry is a critical step. SARS-CoV takes
advantage of the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CTSL and CTSB)7,8.
Cathepsin L is a peptidase that preferentially cleaves peptide bonds with aromatic residues in P2
and hydrophobic residues in P3 position9. CTSL is active at pH 3-6.5, in the presence of thiol
and its enzymatic stability is dependent on ionic strength9. Cathepsin L proteolysis was shown to
be important mechanism during Ebola as well as SARS-CoV outbreak in processing viral
glycoprotein before cell membrane fusion8. Specifically, the S protein is cleaved by host cell
proteases, exposing a fusion peptide of the S2 domain. This leads to the fusion of viral and
cellular membranes and the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell.
Cleavage of the S protein occurs between the S1 and S2 domains and subsequently within
the S2 domain (S2’) proximal to the fusion peptide. Cleavage at both sites is believed to be
necessary for viral entry into a host cell. The S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 is between the
threonine and methionine at positions 696 and 697. This S1/S2 cleavage site is identical to that
of SARS-CoV which has been shown to be cleaved by cathepsin L (CatL or CTSL), a lysosomal
cystein protease encoded by the CTSL1 gene. SARS-CoV-2 also has a furin-like protease
cleavage site not found in SARS-CoV, between the arginine and serine at positions 685 and 686.

This site may be cleaved by furin during viral egress. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 might be
also primed by TMPRSS24. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 has been shown to suppress SARS-CoV
infection. Furthermore (TMPRSS2), whose expression does correlate with SARS-CoV infection
in the upper lobe of the lung10. Interfering with the spike protein processing by the host cell,
whether by affecting the environment or modulating gene expression levels, hence offers a
potential therapeutic strategy.
Genetic variation in CTSL gene could in theory affect the propagation capacity of the
virus. Furthermore CTSL polymorphisms could affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 where
for example individuals with certain genetic variant have reduced expression of Cathepsin L and
in turn could be protected or have lower viral titers. Additionally, elements of hosts MHC I and
CTL mediated immune responses might affect viral proliferation11. There are susceptibility
factors spanning from ethnicity background to age related groups, to comorbid conditions12.
Novel therapeutics identified by high throughput screening assay shown to block the
cleavage of CoV2 S (Spike) protein by Cathepsin L,Cathepsin B or TMPRSS2 (or any other
protease) at predicted/selected binding sites will be a viable approach to functionally target and
limit SARS-CoV-2 virus. Other therapeutic mechanisms of action could involve lowering or
modulating the expression of CTSL or affecting the conditions of the CTSL lysosomal
environment by modulating pH. Here we test agents that could help identify potential therapeutic
agents with the capacity to decrease expression of the CTSL gene. We discuss the identification
of 5 such agents and in particular Amantadine as one such compound and propose that further
clinical studies should be conducted to examine whether amantadine could be useful in treating
patients with COVID-19 infection.

RESULTS
Drug screen
To discover potential, pharmaceutical agents able to modulate molecular signatures implicated in
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 patho-physiology, we have screened 466 compounds belonging to
14 different therapeutic classes (Supplemental fig xx). Screening was conducted using human,
retinal pigment epithelia cell line (ARPE-19) and gene expression changes were collected across
12,490 genes. The ARPE-19 cell line was initially selected as a well suited model for the study
of compounds that affect neuronal type cells, in particular antipsychotics. ARPE-19 expresses a
variety of well known, neuronal, cell surface receptors that include the dopamine receptor D2,
the serotonin receptors 1A, 2A, and 2C, the muscarinic receptor M3, and the histamine receptor
H1. Here we describe the discovery of a CTSL/B, lysosomotropic signature which might give
insights into the therapeutic potential of these drugs.
We analyzed expression profile of CTSL across all 466 drugs tested. In order to find positive hits
we selected only those results that caused decrease of CTSL expression by at least 33% (1.5 fold
down). Top drug targets (Table1) consisted of drugs from various therapeutic areas – muscle

relaxer, antihistamine, anti-epileptic, anticholirgenic and antiviral. There were no drugs that
would decrease CTSL expression by more than 40%. Among the top results, Amantadine, is a
known and safe antiviral agent that was previously used to treat patients with influenza A.
Amantadine hydrochloride (among the top drugs (within top 5 of 466) with a log2 difference is),
is lysosomotropic alkalinizing agent. Physical chemical properties of amantadine leading to
lysosomal accumulation13.. Lysosomotropic drugs affect lysosomes by pH alteration, Block of
Ca2+ signaling, Lysosomal membrane permeabllilizations, Enzyme activity inhibition, Storage
material accumulation14. Amantadine behaves as a lysosomotropic substance that passes easily
through the lysosome membrane and accumulates in it. It could lower the pH of lysosome thus
inhibit the protease activities15. Amantadine can also block the assembly of
influenza virus during viral replication. Moreover amantadine may directly affect viral entry in
direct manner down-modulating CTSL and other lysosomal pathway genes. The PK profile of
the drug makes it particularly. Amantadine HCl IR is available as a 100-mg tablet (equivalent to
81 mg base amantadine) and 50 mg/5 mL syrup (equivalent to 40 mg/5 mL base amantadine),
and is typically administered twice daily16.
Since CTSL was not the top differentially expressed transcript, we decided to extend our analysis
to all the genes that were downregulated by amantadine. Among the top 500 differentially
expressed probes (383 genes, all with at least 50% expression reduction) we have found 21 genes
were related to lysosome (GO:005764, p=2.49x10-5) Moreover a number 1 top significant
pathway by ENRICHR enrichment analysis is KEGG lysosome. Amantadine’s significant effect
on lysosome pathway genes is shown on Figure 1 and Table 2.

We investigated natural variation of CTSL expression across ethnicities, focusing on common
and rare variants. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides genotype
information and gene expression levels across 49 human tissues from 838 donors, allowing us to
examine the expression patterns of CTSL, both across tissues as well as across individuals. Figure
2 shows expression of CTSL across different organs and associated cell types. CTSL is widely
expressed in many crucial organs (high in lungs, in nerve tibial, adipose, artery, whole blood and
several others). Looking at eQTL variants in CTSL, we have found a very significant and lung
specific (rs2378757) variant conferring highly variable expression. The genotype (supp fig)
confers lower baseline expression and is likely associated with a better response and conversely
higher expression perhaps higher viral load. We observe presence of series of splice QTLs hence
variants affecting splicing ratios of transcripts such as rs114063116 significant and present in the
lungs tissues. CTSL GTEx analysis points to potential protection or susceptibility of certain
individuals. Interestingly the alternative splicing of the CTSL transcript in the lung further
displays tissue specific regulatory programs (S.Fig1). A recent functional study points to a
common variant in CTSL in the proximal CTSL1 promoter, (position C-171A), confirmed to alter
transcription via alteration of the xenobiotic response element17. This and similar other variants
likely affect natural diversity in baseline expression hence viral fitness at cell entry of SARSCov-2. Additionally, we checked in the gnomAD18 database the number of rare variants and
variation tolerance status of CTSL. The results show that there are on average 167 missense

variants in CTSL and the gene is predicted to be loss-of-function variant tolerant with a pLI of
0.01. Together with significant eQTLs this indicates large effect of genetic variation on CTSL
expression and variation thereof. TMPRSS2 is also widely expressed in multiple tissues including
those in the GI system, lung, and kidney. The high expression of CTSL and TRMPSS2 transcripts
in a series of organs could explain the viral manifestation in these tissues such as recent studies
showing viral presence in stool samples from infected individuals19 as well as effects of the virus
seen across tissues. This is assuming that there is enough ACE2 expression on the tissue for viral
S protein to bind and target the cell.

Discussion
Decreasing the expression of enzymes is likely a potential mechanism that would lower the
capacity of the virus to exit the cell. Another viable option is lysosomal dysfunction .that can
interfere in many ways with viral replication because this is where the virus is going to get
assembled and get ready for subsequent replication. Given one is able to perturb the lysosomes,
their function or microenvironment, you may offer protection from the virus or decrease the
severity of the symptoms. Having seen that amantadine does not only down-regulate Cathepsin
L, but a number of key lysosomal enzymes, we can now hypothesize that lysosomal dysfunction
induced by amantadine administration can be protective from viral entry and replication. Our
hypothesis that people with certain lysosomal storage diseases are resistant to one of these
viruses. Along these lines there is suggestive evidence for this to be true. NPC1 (Neimman Pick
type C, storage, cholesterol transport disorder) offers resistance to Ebola in patient cell lines20, 21.
Even more interesting in the attached article, bats show selective sensitivity to Ebola versus
Marburg viruses
Interfering with the lysosomal milieu can have protective effects from coronavirus which we
know uses cathepsin L, a pH sensitive enzyme, to process the cleavage of the spike protein.
Amantadine would be predicted by physical and chemical properties to accumulate in the
lysosomes and raise a the pH, likely enough to interfere with cathepsin L function. The gene
expression pattern reported in this paper suggests that a more general lysosomal program is
down-regulated, likely through a common set of transcription factors. Amantadine could hence
be used as a potent agent to decrease viral load if administered early enough in the course of the
COVID-19 infection. Accumulation in lysosomes, If effective, could reduce viral load, may
decrease intra-host organ spread and decrease associated disease severity and progression.
Further studies including clinical trials would be required in order to examine the role of
amantadine administration as a treatment for COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatment
Drug screen was the same one as used in the previous study22. The retinal pigment epithelia cell
line, ARPE-19/HPV-16, was chosen to establish a database of drug profiles because of its noncancerous, human origin, with a normal karyotype. It can also be easily grown as monolayer in
96-well plates. Cell lines were propagated according to supplier's specifications (ATCC
Manassas, VA). Compounds were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Vanda
Pharmaceuticals (Washington, DC). Cells were aliquoted on 96-well plates (~2×10e5 cells/well)
and incubated for 24 h prior to providing fresh media with a drug, or the drug vehicle (water,
dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, methanol, or phosphate-buffered saline solution). Drugs were
diluted 1000 fold in buffered Advanced D-MEM/F-12 culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) containing nonessential amino acids and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate. In these conditions, no
significant changes of pH were expected, which was confirmed by the monitoring of the pH
indicator present in the medium. A final 10 μM drug concentration was chosen because it is
believed to fit in the range of physiological relevance22). Microscopic inspection of each well
was conducted at the end of the treatment to discard any samples where cells had morphological
changes consistent with apoptosis. We also verified that the drug had not precipitated in the
culture medium.
Gene expression
Cells were harvested 24 h after treatment and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy 96 protocol
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gene expression for 22,238 probe sets of 12,490 genes was generated
with U133A2.0 microarrays following the manufacturer’s instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA). Drugs were profiled in duplicate or triplicate, with multiple vehicle controls on each plate.
A total of 708 microarrays were analyzed including 74 for the 18 antipsychotics, 499 for the
other 448 compounds, and 135 for vehicle controls. The raw scan data were first converted to
average difference values using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix). The average difference values of both
treatment and control data were set to a minimum threshold of 50 if below 50. For each treatment
instance, all probe sets were then ranked based on their amplitude, or level of expression relative
to the vehicle control (or average of controls when more than one was used). Amplitude was
defined as the ratio of expression (t−v) / [(t+v) / 2] where t corresponds to treatment instance and
v to vehicle instance. Each drug group profile was created using our novel Weighted Influence
Model, Rank of Ranks (WIMRR) method which underscores the rank of each probe set across
the entire gene expression profile rather than the specific change in expression level. WIMRR
takes the average rank of each probe set across all of the members of the group and then reranks
the probe sets from smallest average rank to largest average rank. A gene-set enrichment metric
based on the Kolmogorov– Smirnov (KS) statistic. Specifically, for a given set of probes, the KS
score gives a measure of how up (positive) or down (negative) the set of probes occurs within the
profile of another treatment instance.
