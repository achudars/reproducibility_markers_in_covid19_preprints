Abstract
We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate and
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its Receptor Binding Domain. Docking studies
suggest a putative heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the domain that binds to
ACE2. In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently
and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with
purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs
codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin
lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by
spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for
SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex
between heparan sulfate and ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral
adhesion by exogenous heparin may represent new therapeutic opportunities.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
has swept across the world, resulting in serious clinical morbidities and mortality, as well as
widespread disruption to all aspects of society. As of July 10th, 2020, the virus has spread to
213 countries, causing more than 12.3 million confirmed infections and at least 555,000 deaths
(World Health Organization). Current isolation/social distancing strategies seek to flatten the
infection curve to avoid overwhelming hospitals and to give the medical establishment and
pharmaceutical companies time to develop and test antiviral drugs and vaccines. Currently, only
one antiviral agent, Remdesivir, has been approved for adult COVID-19 patients (Beigel et al.,
2020) and vaccines may be 12-18 months away. Understanding the mechanism for SARS-CoV2 infection and its tissue tropism could reveal other targets to interfere with viral infection and
spread.
The glycocalyx is a complex mixture of glycans and glycoconjugates and is continuous with
the extracellular matrix. Given its location, viruses and other infectious organisms, must pass
through the glycocalyx to engage receptors thought to mediate viral entry into host cells. Many
viral pathogens utilize glycans as attachment factors to facilitate the initial interaction with host
cells, including influenza virus, Herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and
different coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) (Cagno et al., 2019; Koehler et al., 2020;
Stencel-Baerenwald et al., 2014). Several viruses interact with sialic acids, which are located on
the ends of glycans found in glycolipids and glycoproteins (Varki et al., 2015). Other viruses
interact with heparan sulfate (HS) (Milewska et al., 2014), a highly negatively charged linear
polysaccharide that is attached to a small set of membrane or extracellular matrix proteoglycans
(Lindahl et al., 2015). In general, glycan-binding domains on membrane proteins of the virion
envelope mediate initial attachment of virions to glycan receptors. Attachment in this way can
lead to the engagement of protein receptors on the host plasma membrane that facilitate
membrane fusion or engulfment and internalization of the virion.

Like other macromolecules, HS can be divided into subunits, which are operationally defined
as disaccharides based on the ability of bacterial enzymes or nitrous acid to cleave the chain
into disaccharide units (Esko and Selleck, 2002). The basic disaccharide subunit consists of
4 linked D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and

1-

1-4 linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), which

undergo various modifications by sulfation and epimerization while the copolymer assembles on
a limited number of membrane and extracellular matrix proteins (only 17 heparan sulfate
proteoglycans are known) (Lindahl et al., 2015). The variable length of the modified domains
and their pattern of sulfation create unique motifs to which HS-binding proteins interact (Xu and
Esko, 2014). Different tissues and cell types vary in the structure of HS, and HS structure can
vary between individuals and with age (de Agostini et al., 2008; Feyzi et al., 1998; Han et al.,
2020; Ledin et al., 2004; Vongchan et al., 2005; Warda et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2011). These
differences in HS composition may contribute to the tissue tropism of viruses and other
pathogens.
In this report, we show that the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein interacts
with cell surface HS through the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit. Binding of
SARS-CoV-2 S protein to cells requires engagement of both cellular HS and angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that HS acts as a coreceptor. Therapeutic
unfractionated heparin (UFH), non-anticoagulant heparin and HS derived from human lung and
other tissues blocks binding. UFH and heparin lyases also block infection of cells by S protein
pseudotyped virus and native SARS-CoV-2. These findings identify cellular HS as a necessary
co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and emphasizes the potential for targeting S protein-HS
interactions to attenuate virus infection.

Results
Molecular modeling reveals an HS-binding site adjacent to the ACE2 binding domain in
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
The trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein is thought to engage human ACE2 with a single RBD
extending from the trimer in an “open” active conformation (Fig. 1A) (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp
et al., 2020). Adjacent to the ACE2 binding site and exposed in the open RBD conformation lies
a group of positively-charged amino acid residues that represents a potential site that could
interact with heparin or heparan sulfate (Fig. 1A and Suppl. Fig. S1). We calculated an
electrostatic potential map of the RBD (from PDB ID 6M17 (Yan et al., 2020)), which revealed
an extended electropositive surface with dimensions and turns/loops consistent with a heparinbinding site (Fig. 1B) (Xu and Esko, 2014). Docking studies using a tetrasaccharide (dp4)
fragment derived from heparin demonstrated preferred interactions with this electropositive
surface, which based on its dimensions could accommodate a chain of up to 20
monosaccharides (Fig. 1B and 1C). Evaluation of heparin-protein contacts and energy
contributions using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software suggested strong
interactions with the positively charged amino acids R346, R355, K444, R466 and possibly
R509 (Figs. 1A, 1D, and 1E). Other amino acids, notably F347, S349, N354, G447, Y449, and
Y451, could coordinate the oligosaccharide through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
interactions. Notably, the putative binding surface for oligosaccharides is adjacent to, but
separate from the ACE2 binding site, suggesting that a single RBD could simultaneously bind
both cell-surface HS oligosaccharides and its ACE2 protein receptor. Consistent with the
hypothesis that only one RBD in the trimeric S protein is exposed in an active conformation, the
putative HS binding is partially obstructed in the closed RBD conformation, while exposed in the
active state (Suppl. Fig. S1).
The S protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S is 73% identical with the same domain of SARS-CoV1 S (Fig. 1F). These domains are highly similar in structure with an overall Cα r.m.s.d. of 0.929

Å (Fig. 1G). However, an electrostatic potential map of the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD does not show
an electropositive surface like that observed in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1H). Most of the positively
charged residues comprising this surface are conserved between the two proteins, with the
exception of SARS-CoV-2 K444 which is a threonine in SARS-CoV-1 (Fig. 1F and G).
Additionally, the other amino acid residues predicted to coordinate with the oligosaccharide are
conserved with the exception of Asn354 in SARS-CoV-2, which is a glutamate residue in SARSCoV-1. SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to interact with cellular HS in addition to its entry
receptors ACE2 and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (Lang et al., 2011). Our
analysis suggests that the putative heparin-binding site in SARS-CoV-2 S may mediate an
enhanced interaction with heparin compared to SARS-CoV-1, and that this change evolved
through as few as two amino acid substitutions, Thr Lys444 and Glu Asn354.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds heparin through the RBD domain.
To test experimentally if the SARS-CoV-2 S protein interacts with heparin, recombinant
ectodomain and RBD proteins were prepared and characterized. Initial studies encountered
difficulty in stabilizing the S ectodomain protein, a problem that was resolved by raising the
concentration of NaCl to 0.3 M in HEPES buffer. Under these conditions, the protein could be
stored at room temperature, 4 oC or at -80 oC for at least two weeks. SDS-PAGE showed that
each protein was ~98% pure (Fig. Suppl. S2A). Transmission electron micrographs of the S
ectodomains revealed trimeric structures (Suppl. Fig. S2B). The main component by SEC
behaved as a glycosylated trimer with an apparent molecular mass of ~740 kDa (Suppl. Fig.
S2C). A highly purified commercial preparation of RBD protein was used in some studies (SINO
Biologics, Suppl. Fig. S2A) as well as recombinant RBD protein expressed in ExpiHEK cells
(Suppl. Fig. S2D), both of which were judged >98% pure by SDS-PAGE and SEC (Suppl. Fig.
S2E).

Recombinant S ectodomain and RBD proteins were applied to a column of heparinSepharose. Elution with a gradient of sodium chloride showed that the RBD eluted at ~0.3 M
NaCl, with a shoulder that eluted with higher salt (Fig. 2A). Recombinant S ectodomain also
bound to heparin-Sepharose, but it eluted across a broader concentration of NaCl. The elution
profiles suggest that the preparations contained a population of molecules that bind to heparin,
but that some heterogeneity in affinity for heparin occurs, which may reflect differences in
glycosylation, oligomerization or binding heparin binding sites in the closed conformation.
The S ectodomain also bound in a concentration-dependent manner to unfractionated
heparin immobilized on a plate, and the data fit a binding curve with an apparent KD value of 15
± 1 nM (Fig. 2B). S ectodomain protein also bound in a saturable manner to heparin-BSA
conjugates immobilized on a plate (Fig. 2C). In contrast, ACE2 did not bind to heparinSepharose. ACE2 also had no effect on binding of S protein to heparin-BSA at all
concentrations that were tested (Fig. 2C, inset). The ectodomain protein bound immobilized
recombinant ACE2 (Fig. 2D). Inclusion of UFH or hexadecasaccharides (dp16) from heparin did
not affect the affinity of S protein for ACE2 and only mildly decreased the extent of binding in
this assay format (Fig. 2D). Biotinylated ACE2 bound to immobilized S protein (Fig. 2E). A
ternary complex of heparin, ACE2 and S protein could be demonstrated by binding of S protein
to immobilized heparin-BSA and titrating biotinylated ACE2. Binding of ACE2 under these
conditions increased in proportion to the amount of S protein bound to the heparin-BSA (Fig.
2F). These findings support a model in which the binding sites for HS and ACE2 in the RBD act
independently and can engage their receptors simultaneously.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein depends on cellular heparan sulfate for cell binding.
The assays described in Fig. 2 utilized heparin, which is often used as a surrogate for
cellular HS due to its commercial availability. Although it is related in structure to HS, heparin is
much more highly sulfated and negatively charged and can act as a strong unspecific cation

exchanger. To determine if the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to typical HS found on cells, S
ectodomain protein was added to human H1299 cells, an adenocarcinoma cell line derived from
Type 2 alveolar cells (Fig. 3A). Spike ectodomains bound to H1299 cells, yielding an apparent
KD value of ~75 nM. Treatment of the cells with a mixture of heparin lyases (HSase), which
degrades cell surface HS, dramatically reduced binding (Fig 3A). The S ectodomain also bound
to human A549 cells, another Type 2 alveolar adenocarcinoma line, as well as human
hepatoma Hep3B cells (Fig. 3B). Removal of HS by enzymatic treatment dramatically reduced
binding in both of these cell lines as well (Fig. 3B). Recombinant RBD protein also bound to all
three cell lines and binding largely depended on HS (Fig. 3C). A melanoma cell line, A375, was
tested independently and also showed HS dependent binding (Fig 3D). The extent of binding to
HS across the four cell lines varied ~4-fold. This variation was not due to differences in HS
expression as illustrated by staining of cell surface HS with mAb 10E4, which recognizes a
common epitope in HS (Fig. 3E). In fact, A375 cells have the highest expression of cell surface
HS, but the lowest extent of S protein binding (Fig. 3D), whereas Hep3B cells have low amounts
of cell surface HS and the highest binding of S protein. This lack of correlation could reflect
differences in the structure of HS or available ACE2.
We also measured binding of the S ectodomain and RBD proteins to a library of mutant
Hep3B cells, carrying CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations in biosynthetic enzymes essential for
synthesizing HS (Anower et al., 2019). Inactivation of EXT1, a subunit of the copolymerase
required for synthesis of the backbone of HS, abolished binding to a greater extent than
enzymatic removal of the chains with HSases (Fig. 4A and B), suggesting that the HSase
treatment may underestimate the dependence on HS. Targeting NDST1, a GlcNAc Ndeacetylase-N-sulfotransferase that N-deacetylates and N-sulfates N-acetylglucosamine
residues, and HS6ST1 and HS6ST2, which introduces sulfate groups in the C6 position of
glucosamine residues, significantly reduced binding (Figs. 4A and B). Although experiments

with other sulfotransferases have not yet been done, the data suggests that S and RBD may
recognize a specific pattern of sulfation.

Heparin and heparan sulfates inhibit binding of spike ectodomain protein.
To examine how variation in the HS structure affects binding, we isolated HS from human
kidney, liver, lung and tonsil. The samples were depolymerized into disaccharides by treatment
with HSases, and the disaccharides were then analyzed by LC-MS (Experimental Methods).
The disaccharide analysis showed that lung HS has a larger proportion of N-deacetylated and
N-sulfated glucosamine residues (grey bars) and more 2-O-sulfated uronic acids (green bars)
than HS preparations from the other tissues (Fig. 5A). The different HS preparations also varied
in their ability to block binding of RBD to H1299 cells (Fig 5B). Interestingly, HS isolated from
lung was more potent compared to kidney and liver HS, consistent with the greater degree of
sulfation of HS from this organ (Table 1). HS from tonsil was as potent as HS from lung, but the
overall extent of sulfation was not as great, supporting the notion that the patterning of the
sulfated domains in the chains may play a role in binding.
Unfractionated heparin is derived from porcine mucosa and possesses potent anticoagulant
activity due to the presence of a pentasaccharide sequence containing a crucial 3-O-sulfated Nsulfoglucosamine unit, which confers high affinity binding to antithrombin. Heparin is also very
highly sulfated compared to HS with an average negative charge of –3.4 per disaccharide (the
overall negative charge density of typical HS is –1.8 to –2.2 per disaccharide). MST cells, which
were derived from a murine mastocytoma, make heparin-like HS that lacks the key 3-O-sulfate
group and anticoagulant activity (Gasimli et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 1992). The
anticoagulant properties of heparin can also be removed by periodate oxidation, which oxidizes
the vicinal hydroxyl groups in the uronic acids, resulting in what is called split-glycol heparin
(Casu et al., 2004). All of these agents significantly inhibited binding of the S protein to H1299
and A549 cells (Fig 5C and 5D) yielding IC50 values in the range of 0.01-0.12 µg/ml (Table 1).

Interestingly, the lack of 3-O-sulfation, crucial for the anticoagulant activity of heparin, had little
effect on its inhibition of S binding. In contrast, CHO cell HS (containing 0.8 sulfates per
disaccharide) only weakly inhibited binding (IC50 values of 18 and 139 µg/ml for A549 and
H1299, respectively) (Table 1). These data suggest that inhibition by heparinoids is most likely
charge dependent and independent of anticoagulant activity per se.

Binding of S protein to ACE2 also depends on heparan sulfate.
The experiments shown in Figs. 2C and 2D indicate that the binding sites in the RBD for
ACE2 and HS function independently when tested as purified components. To explore if they
function independently in cells, we genetically varied the expression of ACE2. Several attempts
were made to measure ACE2 levels by Western blotting or flow cytometry with different mAbs
and polyclonal antibodies, but a reliable signal was not obtained in any of the cell lines.
However, expression was observed by RT-qPCR (Suppl. Fig. 3). However, when A375 cells
were transfected with ACE2 cDNA, robust expression was detected by Western blotting (Fig.
6A). Binding of S ectodomain protein increased ~4-fold in the transfected cells (Fig. 6B), but the
enhanced binding remained HS-dependent, as illustrated by the loss of binding after HSasetreatment. A375 cells carrying a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion in the B4GALT7 gene, which
is required for glycosaminoglycan assembly (Fig. 6A, Suppl. Fig. S4), showed a similar
dependence of spike binding on HS despite the overexpression of ACE2 in B4GALT7-/- cells
(Fig. 6B). To explore the impact of diminished ACE2 expression, we examined spike protein
binding to A549 cells and in two CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeted clones C3 and C6 bearing
biallelic mutations in ACE2 (Suppl. Fig. S4). Binding of S ectodomain protein was greatly
reduced in the ACE2-/- clones and the residual binding was sensitive to HSases (Fig. 6C). These
findings show that binding of spike protein on cells involves cooperation between ACE2 and HS
receptors, in contrast to their independent binding observed with purified components (Fig. 2).

VSV S-protein pseudotyped virus infection depends on heparan sulfate.
Assays using recombinant proteins do not recapitulate the multivalent presentation of the S
protein as it occurs on the virion membrane. Thus, to extend these studies, pseudotyped
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was engineered to express the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S
protein and GFP or luciferase. Vero E6 cells are commonly used in the study of SARS-CoV-2
infection, due to their high susceptibility to infection. Spike protein binding to Vero cells also
depends on cellular HS, and binding was sensitive to HSases, heparin and split-glycol heparin
(Fig. 7A). Interestingly, HSase treatment reduced binding to a lesser extent than the level of
reduction observed in A549, H1299 and Hep3B cells. Vero cells express very high levels of
ACE2 in comparison to other cells by Western blotting (Fig 7B) and by RT-qPCR (Suppl. Fig.
S3), which may explain the decreased sensitivity to HSase. Infection of Vero cells by GFPexpressing VSV S protein pseudotyped virus was readily assessed qualitatively by fluorescence
microscopy (inset) and quantitatively by flow cytometry (Fig. 7C and 7D). HSase treatment
reduced infection ~3-fold. Infection by luciferin-expressing VSV S protein pseudotyped virus
provided greater sensitivity, allowing studies with both high and low infection rates (Fig 7E, and
7F). Under either condition, infection was reduced 2 to 3-fold by HSase. Heparin very potently
reduced infection more than ~4-fold at 0.5 µg/mL and higher concentrations (Fig. 7G). In
contrast, studies of SARS-CoV-1 S protein pseudotype virus showed that HSase-treatment
actually increased SARS-CoV-1 infection by more than 2-fold, suggesting that HS might
interfere with binding of SARS-CoV-1 to ACE2 (Fig 7H). Infection of H1299 and A549 cells by
SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotype virus was too low to obtain accurate measurements, but infection of
Hep3B cells could be readily measured (Fig. 7I). HSase and mutations in EXT1 and NDST1
dramatically reduced infection 6- to 7-fold. Inactivation of the 6-O-sulfotransferases had at best
a mild effect unlike its diminutive effect on S protein binding (Fig. 4), possibly due to the high
valency conferred by multiple copies of S protein on the pseudovirus envelope.

Cellular heparan sulfate is required for efficient infection by native SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These studies were then extended to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection using strain USAWA1/2020. Infection of Vero E6 cells was monitored by double staining of the cells with
antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and S proteins (Fig. 8A). Cells were treated
with virus for 1 hr and the extent of infection was assayed 24 hrs later. Titration of the virus
yielded infection rates of about 15-50%. Under either condition, treatment of the cells with
HSases caused a ~5-fold reduction in the percentage of infected cells. Composite data from five
separate experiments done in triplicate are shown in Fig. 8B (color coded for individual
experiments). Data normalized to the values obtained in the absence of any treatment (mock) is
shown in Fig. 8C. Titration of unfractionated heparin showed dose-dependent inhibition of
infection (Fig. 8B and 8C) and emphasizes the potential for using unfractionated heparin or
other non-anticoagulant heparinoids to prevent viral attachment.
These findings were then extended to Hep3B cells and mutants altered in HS biosynthesis
using a viral plaque assay. Virus was added to wildtype, NDST1-/- and HS6ST1/2-/- cells for 2 hr,
the virus was removed, and after 2 days incubation a serial dilution of the conditioned culture
medium was added to monolayers of Vero E6 cells. The number of plaques were then
quantitated by staining and visualization. As a control, culture medium from infected Vero E6
cells was tested, which showed robust viral titers. Hep3B cells also supported viral replication,
but to a lesser extent than Vero cells. Inactivation of NDST1 in Hep3B cells abolished virus
production, whereas inactivation of HS6ST1/2-/- reduced infection about 3-fold (Fig. 8D). These
findings demonstrate the requirement of cellular HS in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and
replication.

Discussion
In this report, we provide compelling evidence that HS is a necessary host attachment factor
that mediates SARS-CoV-2 infection of various target cells. The receptor binding domain of the

SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to heparin, most likely through a docking site composed of
positively charged amino acid residues aligned in a subdomain of the RBD that is separate from
the site involved in ACE2 binding (Fig. 1A). Competition studies, enzymatic removal of HS, and
genetic studies confirm that the S protein, whether presented as a recombinant protein (Figs. 26), in a pseudovirus (Fig. 7), or in intact SARS-CoV-2 virions (Fig. 8), binds to cell surface HS in
a cooperative manner with ACE2 receptors. This data provides crucial insights into the
pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests HS-spike protein complexes as
a novel therapeutic target to prevent infection.
The glycocalyx is the first point of contact for all pathogens that infect animal cells, and thus
it is not surprising that many viruses exploit glycans, such as HS, as attachment factors. For
example, the initial interaction of herpes simplex virus with cells involves binding to HS chains
on one or more HS proteoglycans (Shieh et al., 1992; WuDunn and Spear, 1989) through the
interactions with the viral glycoproteins gB and gC. Viral entry requires the interaction of a
specific structure in HS with a third viral glycoprotein, gD (Shukla et al., 1999), working in
concert with membrane proteins related to TNF/NGF receptors (Montgomery et al., 1996).
Similarly, the human immunodeficiency virus binds to HS by way of the V3 loop of the viral
glycoprotein gp120 (Roderiquez et al., 1995), but infection requires the chemokine receptor
CCR5 (Deng et al., 1996; Dragic et al., 1996). Other coronaviruses also utilize HS, for example
NL63 (HCoV-NL63) binds HS via the viral S protein in addition to ACE2 (Lang et al., 2011;
Milewska et al., 2018; Milewska et al., 2014; Naskalska et al., 2019). In these examples, initial
tethering of virions to the host cell plasma membrane appears to be mediated by HS, but
infection requires transfer to a proteinaceous receptor. The data presented here shows that
SARS-CoV-2 requires HS in addition to ACE2. Binding to heparin and ACE2 occurs
independently in biochemical assays with purified components, but on the surface of cells the
interaction apparently occurs in a co-dependent manner. We imagine a model in which cell
surface HS acts as a “collector” to allow for optimal presentation to ACE2, making viral infection

more efficient. HS varies in structure across cell types and tissues, as well as with gender and
age (de Agostini et al., 2008; Feyzi et al., 1998; Ledin et al., 2004; Vongchan et al., 2005;
Warda et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2011). Thus, it is possible HS contributes to the tissue tropism
and the susceptibility of different patient populations in addition to levels of expression of ACE2
(Li et al., 2020).
Coronaviruses can utilize a diverse set of glycoconjugates as attachment factors. Human
coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) bind to 5-N-acetyl-9-Oacetylneuraminic acid (Hulswit et al., 2019; Tortorici et al., 2019), middle east respiratory
syndrome virus (MERS) binds 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Park et al., 2019), and guinea fowl
coronavirus binds biantennary di-N-acetyllactosamine or sialic acid capped glycans (Bouwman
et al., 2019). Whether SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to sialic acid remains unclear. Mapping the
binding site for sialic acids in other coronavirus S proteins has proved elusive, but modeling
studies suggest a location distinct from the HS binding site shown in Fig. 1 (Park et al., 2019;
Tortorici et al., 2019). The S protein in murine coronavirus contains both a hemagglutinin
domain for binding and an esterase domain that cleaves sialic acids that aids in the liberation of
bound virions (Rinninger et al., 2006; Smits et al., 2005). Whether SARS-CoV-2 S protein,
another viral envelope protein, or a host protein contributes an HS-degrading activity to aid in
the release of newly made virions is unknown.
The repertoire of proteins in organisms that bind to HS make up the so called “HS
interactome” and consists of a variety of different HS-binding proteins (HSBPs) (Xu and Esko,
2014). Unlike lectins that have a common fold that helps define the glycan binding site, HSBPs
do not exhibit a conserved motif that allows accurate predictions of binding sites based on
primary sequence. Instead, the capacity to bind heparin appears to have emerged through
convergent evolution by juxtaposition of several positively charged amino acid residues
arranged to accommodate the negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups present in the
polysaccharide, and hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions stabilize the association. The RBD

domains from the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are highly similar in structure (Fig.
1G), but the electropositive surface in SARS-CoV-1 S RBD is not as pronounced in SARS-CoV2 S RBD (Figure 1H). A priori we predicted that the evolution of the HS binding site in the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein might have occurred by the addition of arginine and lysine residues to its
ancestor, SARS-CoV-1. Instead, we observed that 4 of the six predicted positively charged
residues that make up the heparin-binding site are present in SARS-CoV-1 as well as most of
the other amino acid residues predicted to interact with heparin (Fig. 1). SARS-CoV-1 has been
shown to interact with cellular HS in addition to its entry receptors ACE2 and transmembrane
protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (Lang et al., 2011). Our analysis suggests that the putative
heparin-binding site in SARS-CoV-2 S may mediate an enhanced interaction with heparin
compared to SARS-CoV-1, and that this change evolved through as few as two amino acid
substitutions, Thr444Lys and Glu354Asn.
It has previously been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects target cells by interacting with
ACE2 and that a possible reason for its higher virulence compared to SARS-CoV-1 may owe to
an increase in ACE2 binding affinity (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Here, we showed that infection of
SARS-CoV-1 S protein pseudotyped virus is actually increased upon heparin lyase-treatment
(Fig. 7H). Thus, it is possible that the increased virulence of SARS-CoV-2 can in part be
attributed to acquiring the capacity for more robust adhesion to HS.
The ability of heparin and HS to compete for binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to cell
surface HS and the inhibitory activity of heparin towards viral uptake of pseudovirus and native
SARS-CoV-2 illustrates the therapeutic potential of agents that target the virus-HS interaction to
control infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is precedent for targeting proteinglycan interactions as therapeutic agents. For example, Tamiflu targets influenza
neuraminidase, thus reducing viral transmission, and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides
can block sialic acid-dependent rotavirus attachment and subsequent infection in infants (Hester
et al., 2013; von Itzstein, 2007). COVID-19 patients typically suffer from thrombotic

complications ranging from vascular micro-thromboses, venous thromboembolic disease and
stroke and often receive unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (Thachil, 2020).
The findings presented here and in recent preprints uploaded to BioRxiv, suggests that both of
these agents can block viral infection (Courtney Mycroft-West, 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Liu et al.,
2020; Mycroft-West et al., 2020; Tandon et al., 2020). Thus, heparin may have dual action: as a
hemostatic agent to prevent clotting and as an antiviral to decrease viral attachment. The
anticoagulant activity of heparin, which is typically absent in HS, is not critical for its antiviral
activity based on the observation that MST derived heparin and split-glycol heparin is nearly as
potent as therapeutic heparin (Figs. 5 and 7). Additional studies are needed to address the
potential overlap in the dose response profiles for heparin as an anticoagulant and antiviral
agent. Antibodies directed to heparan sulfate or the binding site in the RBD might also prove
useful for attenuating infection.
In conclusion, this work revealed HS as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and suggests the
possibility of using HS mimetics, HS degrading lyases, and metabolic inhibitors of HS
biosynthesis for the development of therapy to combat COVID-19.

One day later the cells were refed, then incubated at 32 ºC for 11 days. The conditioned
medium was mixed with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (Roche). Recombinant protein
was purified by chromatography on a Ni2+ Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (1 ml, GE
LifeSciences). Samples were loaded in ExpiCHO Expression Medium supplemented with 30
mM imidazole, washed in a 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 30 mM imidazole and 0.5
M NaCl. Recombinant protein was eluted with buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.3 M
imidazole. The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/60
Superdex 200, prep grade. GE LifeSciences) in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2
M NaCl. Recombinant ectodomains migrate as a trimer assuming a monomer molecular mass
of ~142,000 and 22 N-linked glycans per monomer (Watanabe et al., 2020). SDS-PAGE, TEM
analysis, and SEC studies validate protein purity and the presence of trimers (Suppl. Fig. S1).

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD production
SARS-CoV-2 RBD (GenBank: MN975262.1; amino acid residues 319-529) was cloned into
pVRC vector containing an HRV 3C protease-cleavable C-terminal streptavidin binding peptide
(SBP)-His8X tag and the sequence was confirmed. Recombinant protein was expressed by
transient transfection of mammalian Expi293F suspension cells. Supernatants were harvested 5
days post-transfection and passed over Cobalt-TALON resin (Takara) followed by size
exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in PBS.

Samples of the recombinant trimeric spike protein ectodomain were diluted to 0.03 mg/ml in
1X TBS pH 7.4. Carbon coated copper mesh grids were glow discharged and 3 μL of the diluted
sample was placed on a grid for 30 seconds then blotted off. Uniform stain was achieved by
depositing 3 μL of uranyl formate (2%) on the grid for 55 seconds and then blotted off. Grids
were transferred to a Thermo Fisher Morgagni operating at 80kV. Images at 56,000
magnification were acquired using a MegaView 2K camera via the RADIUS software. A dataset
of 138 micrographs at 52,000x magnification and -1.5 μm defocus was collected on a FEI
Tecnai Spirit (120keV) with a FEI Eagle 4k by 4k CCD camera. The pixel size was 2.06 Å per
pixel and the dose was 25 e−/Å2. The Leginon (Suloway et al., 2005) software was used to
automate the data collection and the raw micrographs were stored in the Appion (Lander et al.,
2009) database. Particles on the micrographs were picked using DogPicker (Voss et al., 2009),
stack with a box size of 200 pixels, and 2D classified with RELION 3.0 (Scheres, 2012).

Recombinant ACE2 expression and purification
Secreted human ACE2 was transiently produced in suspension HEK293-6E cells. A plasmid
encoding residues 1−615 of ACE2 with a C-terminal HRV-3C protease cleavage site, a
TwinStrepTag and an His8x Tag was a gift from Jason S. McLellan, University of Texas at
Austin. Briefly, 100 mL of HEK293-6E cells were seeded at a cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml 24
hr before transfection with polyethyleneimine (PEI). For transfection, 100 µg of the ACE2
plasmid and 300 µg of PEI (1:3 ratio) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature.
Transfected cells were cultured for 48 hr and fed with 100 mL fresh media for additional 48 hr
before harvest. Secreted ACE2 were purified from culture medium by Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography (Qiagen). Filtered media was mixed 3:1 (v/v) in 4X binding buffer (100
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,0, 1,2 M NaCl) and loaded on to a self-packed column, pre-equilibrated with
washing buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Bound protein was

washed with buffer and eluted with 0.2 M imidazole in washing buffer. The protein containing
fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE.

Analytical Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in dPBS was applied to a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column
(GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 5 ml of dPBS and bound protein was eluted with
a gradient of NaCl from 150 mM to 1 M in dPBS.

Biotinylation
For binding studies, recombinant spike protein and ACE2 was conjugated with EZ-LinkTM
Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (1:3 molar ratio; Thermo Fisher) in Dulbecco’s PBS at room temperature for
30 min. Glycine (0.1 M) was added to quench the reaction and the buffer was exchanged for
PBS using a Zeba spin column (Thermo Fisher).

Binding of spike protein to heparin
Heparin (APP Pharmaceuticals) (50 ng) in 5 µL solution each was pipetted into each well of
a high binding plate. A set of wells were set up without heparin. A solution (0.2 mL) of 90%
saturated (3.7 M) ammonium sulfate was added to each well and incubated overnight to
immobilize the HS. The next day, the wells were washed twice with 0.2 mL of PBS then blocked
with 0.2 mL of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 0.1% BSA for 1 hr at room
temperature. The wells were emptied and 45 µL of PBST/BSA with 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 30, 60 or 100
nM of his/FLAG-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (GenScript, Z03481-100) was added to each
well. The wells were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature, washed thrice with 0.2 mL of
PBST, and then incubated with 45 μL each of 0.1 µg/mL of THE anti-his-HRP (GenScript,
A00612) in PBST/BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. The wells were washed 5 times with 0.2
mL of PBST. TMB Turbo substrate was added to each well (0.1 mL), and the color was allowed

to develop. The reaction was quenched by addition of 0.1 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid. The
absorbance was measured by 450 nm.

Immobilization and binding of ACE2, spike and heparin-BSA
High binding microtiter plates were coated with heparin-BSA (100 ng/well), ACE2 (150
ng/well), or S protein (200 ng/well) overnight at 4oC. The plates were then blocked for 3 hr at 37
o

C with TSM buffer (20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM

CaCl2, 0.05% Tween-20, and 1% BSA) and a dilution series of biotinylated proteins prepared in
TSM buffer was added to the plates in triplicate. Bound biotinylated protein was detected by
adding Avidin-HRP (405103, BioLegend) diluted 1:2000 in TSM buffer. Lastly, the plates were
developed with TMB turbo substrate for 5-15 min. The reaction was quenched using 1 M sulfuric
acid and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To detect the formation of a ternary
complex of ACE2, S protein and heparin-BSA, the plates were first coated with heparin BSA
and incubated with S protein (100 nM). ACE2 binding was measured to bound spike protein as
described above.

Tissue Culture
NCI-H1299, A549, Hep3B, A375 and Vero E6 cells were from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). NCI-H1299 and A549 cells were grown in RPMI medium, whereas the other
lines were grown in DMEM. Hep3B cells carrying mutations in HS biosynthetic enzymes were
derived from the parent Hep3B line as described previously (Anower et al., 2019). All cells were
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 IU/ml of penicillin and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin sulfate
and grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were passaged at ~80%
confluence and seeded as explained for the individual assays.

Cells at 50-80% confluence were lifted with PBS containing 10 mM EDTA (Gibco) and
washed in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 105 cells per
well. In some experiments, a portion of the cells was treated with HSase mix (2.5 mU/ml HSase
I, 2.5 mU/ml HSase II, and 5 mU/ml HSase III; IBEX) for 30 min at 37 oC in PBS containing
0.5% BSA. They were incubated for 30 min at 4oC with biotinylated spike protein (S1/S2 or
RBD; 20 µg/ml or serial dilutions) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were washed twice
and then reacted for 30 min at 4oC with Streptavadin-Cy5 (Thermo Fisher; 1:1000 dilution) in
PBS containing 0.5% BSA,. The cells were washed twice and then analyzed using a
FACSCalibur or a FACSCanto instrument (BD Bioscience). All experiments were done a
minimum of three separate times in three technical replicates. Data analysis was performed
using FlowJo software and statistical analyses were done in Prism 8 (GraphPad).

HS purification from tissues
Fresh human tissue was washed in PBS, frozen, and lyophilized. The dried tissue was
crushed into a fine powder, weighed, resuspended in PBS containing 1 mg/mL Pronase
(Streptomyces griseus, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated at 37°C overnight
with shaking. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min and the supernatant was
mixed 1:10 with equilibration buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH
6) and loaded onto a DEAE Sephacel column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with buffer. The
column was washed with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl, pH 6.0, and
bound GAGs were eluted with 50 mM sodium acetate buffer containing 2.0 M NaCl, pH 6.0. The
eluate was mixed with ethanol saturated with sodium acetate (1:3, vol/vol) and kept at -20°C
overnight, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 20 min. The pellets were dried in a
centrifugal evaporator and reconstituted in DNase buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0) with 20 kU/mL bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma
Aldrich) and incubated with shaking for 2 hr at 37°C. The samples were adjusted to 50 mM Tris

and 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, and incubated for 4 hr at 37 °C with 20 mU/mL chondroitinase ABC
(Proteus vulgaris, Sigma Aldrich). The HS was purified over a DEAE column and precipitated
with 90% ethanol (Esko, 1993).

HS digestion and MS analysis
For HS quantification and disaccharide analysis, purified HS was digested with a mixture of
heparin lyases I-III (2 mU each) for 2 hr at 37 °C in 40 mM ammonium acetate buffer containing
3.3 mM calcium acetate, pH 7.0. The samples were dried in a centrifugal evaporator and
reductively aminated with [12C6]aniline. The HS samples were analyzed by liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by inclusion of [13C6]aniline-tagged
standard HS disaccharides as described (Lawrence et al., 2008). The samples were separated
on a reverse phase column (TARGA C18, 150 mm x 1.0 mm diameter, 5 µm beads; Higgins
Analytical, Inc.) using 5 mM dibutylamine as an ion pairing agent (Sigma-Aldrich), and
fragmentation ions were monitored in negative mode. Separation was performed using the
same gradient, capillary temperature and spray voltage as described (Lawrence et al., 2008).
The analysis was done on an LTQ Orbitrap Discovery electrospray ionization mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with an Ultimate 3000 quaternary HPLC pump
(Dionex).

ACE2 overexpression and immunoblotting
The ACE2 expression plasmid (Addgene, plasmid #1786) was received in bacteria and
purified with a maxiprep kit (Zymogen). A375 wild-type and B4GALT7-/- cells were transfected
with 15 µg ACE2 expression plasmid in a mixture of DMEM, OptiMEM (Gibco), Lipofectamine
2000 with Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 4 hr, the medium was replaced with DMEM/10% FBS
and the cells were incubated for 3 d before being used for experiments.

To measure ACE2 expression, cells were lysed in RIPA Buffer (Millipore, 20-188) with
protease inhibitors (cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche,
11836170001). The lysates were incubated on ice for 1 hr and then centrifuged for 10 min at
10,000 x g at 4 ˚C. The supernate was collected and protein was quantified by BCA assay
(Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ThermoFisher Scientific, 23225). To measure ACE2 expression
in transfected cells, a protein ladder (PageRule Plus Prestained Protein Ladder, Thermo
Scientific, PI26619) was mixed with 4 µg of each cell lysate in triplicate. To measure
endogenous levels of hACE2 in cell lines, a protein ladder (Chameleon Duo Pre-stained Protein
Ladder, Licor, 928-60000) was mixed with 15 µg of each cell lysate in triplicate. Samples were
separated by electrophoresis on a 15-well Bolt 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, NW04125 or
Invitrogen, NP0336) in NuPAGE MOPS SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen, NP0001). The gels
were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL PVDF Membrane, Millipore,

and the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). SYBR Green Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) was used for qPCR following the manufacturer’s instructions, and the
expression of TBP was used to normalize the expression of ACE2 between the samples. The
qPCR primers used were as follows: ACE2 (human) forward: 5’ –
CGAAGCCGAAGACCTGTTCTA - 3’ and reverse: 5’ – GGGCAAGTGTGGACTGTTCC – 3’;
and TBP (human) forward: 5’ – AACTTCGCTTCCGCTGGCCC – 3’ and reverse: 5’ –
GAGGGGAGGCCAAGCCCTGA – 3’.

Mutant cell line generation
To generate the Cas9 lentiviral expression plasmid, 2.5 x 106 HEK293T cells were seeded
to a 10-cm diameter plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The following day, the cells
were co-transfected with the psPAX2 packaging plasmid (Addgene, plasmid #12260), pMD2.g
envelope plasmid (Addgene, plasmid #12259), and lenti-Cas9 plasmid (Addgene, plasmid
#52962) in DMEM supplemented with Fugene6 (30µL in 600µL DMEM). Media containing the
lentivirus was collected and used to infect A549 WT and A375 WT cells, which were
subsequently cultured with 5 µg/mL and 2 µg/mL blasticidin, respectively, to select for stably
transduced cells. A single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ACE2 (5'TGGATACATTTGGGCAAGTG -3') and one targeting B4GALT7 (5’TGACCTGCTCCCTCTCAACG-3’) was cloned into the lentiGuide-Puro plasmid (Addgene
plasmid #52963) following published procedure (Sanjana et al., 2014). The lentiviral sgRNA
construct was generated in HEK293T cells, using the same protocol as for the Cas9 expression
plasmid, and used to infect A549-Cas9 and A375-Cas9 cells to generate CRISPR knockout
mutant cell lines. After infection, the cells were cultured with 2 µg/mL puromycin to select for
cells with stably integrated lentivirus. After 7 d, the cells were serially diluted into 96-well plates.
Single colonies where expanded and DNA was extracted using the DNeasy blood and tissue

DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Proper editing was verified by sequencing (Genewiz Inc.) and gene
analysis using the online ICE tool from Synthego (Supplemental Fig 2).

Preparation and infection by pseudotyped VSV
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) pseudotyped with spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were
generated according to a published protocol (Whitt, 2010). Briefly, HEK293T, transfected to
express full length SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, were inoculated with VSV-G pseudotyped ΔGluciferase or GFP VSV (Kerafast, MA). After 2 hr at 37°C, the inoculum was removed and cells
were refed with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL
streptomycin, and VSV-G antibody (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC).
Pseudotyped particles were collected 20 hr post-inoculation, centrifuged at 1,320 × g to remove
cell debris and stored at −80°C until use.
Cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. The cells (60-70% confluence)
were treated with HSases for 30 min at 37 oC in serum-free DMEM. Culture supernatant
containing pseudovirus (20-100 µL) was adjusted to a total volume of 100 µL with PBS, HSase
mix or the indicated inhibitors and the solution was added to the cells. After 4 hr at 37 oC the
media was changed to complete DMEM. The cells were then incubated for 16 hr to allow
expression of reporter gene. Cells infected with GFP containing virus were visualized by
fluorescence microscopy and counted by flow cytometry. Cells infected with Luciferase
contaning virus were analyzed by Bright-GloTM (Promega) using the manufacturers protocol.
Briefly, 100 µL of luciferin lysis solution was added to the cells and incubated for 5 min at room
temperature. The solution was transferred to a black 96-well plate and luminescence was
detected using an EnSpire multimodal plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Data analysis and statistical
analysis was performed in Prism 8.

Infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus

SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, #NR-52281) was propagated and
infectious units quantified by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells. The cells were treated with or
without HSase mix (IBEX Pharmaceuticals) or with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and infected
with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hr at 37 °C. HSase-treated Vero E6 cells were incubated with HSase
mix 30 min prior to infection until 24 hr post-infection or with UFH at the indicated concentrations
from the start of infection until 24 hr post-infection. The cells were washed twice with PBS, lifted
in Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco), and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized for
flow cytometry using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm according to the manufacturers protocol for fixed
cells and stained with anti-spike antibody [1A9] (GeneTex GTX632604) and anti-Nucleocapsid
antibody (GeneTex GTX135357) that were directly conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 and Alexa
Fluor 594 labeling kits (Invitrogen), respectively. Cells were then analyzed using an MA900 Cell
Sorter (Sony).

Virus plaque assays
Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 or Hep3B cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI
of 0.1. After one hour of incubation at 37 °C, the virus was removed, and the medium was
replaced. After 48 hr, cell culture supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C. Virus titers
were determined by plaque assays on Vero E6 monolayers. In short, serial dilutions of virus
stocks in Minimum Essential Media MEM medium (Gibco, #41500-018) supplemented with 2%
FBS was added to Vero E6 monolayers on 24-well plates (Greiner bio-one, #662160) and
rocked for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells were subsequently overlaid with MEM containing
1% cellulose (Millipore Sigma, #435244), 2% FBS, and 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 (Sigma
#H0887) and the plates were incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air for
48 hr. The plaques were visualized by fixation of the cells with a mixture of 10% formaldehyde
and 2% methanol (v/v in water) for 2 hr. The monolayer was washed once with PBS and stained
with 0.1% Crystal Violet (Millipore Sigma # V5265) prepared in 20% ethanol. After 15 min, the

wells were washed with PBS, and plaques were counted to determine the virus titers. All work
with the SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in Biosafety Level-3 conditions either at the University of
California San Diego or at the Eva J Pell Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University,
following the guidelines approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committees.
