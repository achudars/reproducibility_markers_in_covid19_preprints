ABSTRACT
Introduction: COVID-19-related (vs. non-related) articles appear to be more expeditiously
processed and published in peer-reviewed journals. We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether COVID19-related preprints were favored for publication, (ii) preprinting trends and public discussion of
the preprints, and (iii) the relationship between the publication topic (COVID-19-related or not)
and quality issues.
Methods: Manuscripts deposited at bioRxiv and medRxiv between January 1 and September
27 were assessed for the probability of publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and those
published were evaluated for submission-to-acceptance time. The extent of public discussion
was assessed based on Altmetric and Disqus data. The Retraction Watch Database and
PubMed were used to explore the retraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles and
preprints.
Results: With adjustment for the preprinting server and number of deposited versions, COVID19-related preprints were more likely to be published within 120 days since the deposition of the
first version (OR=2.04, 95%CI 1.87-2.23) as well as over the entire observed period (OR=1.42,
95%CI 1.33-1.52). Submission-to-acceptance was by 38.67 days (95%CI 34.96-42.39) shorter
for COVID-19 articles. Public discussion of preprints was modest and COVID-19 articles were
overrepresented in the pool of retracted articles in 2020.
Conclusion: Current data suggest a preference for publication of COVID-19-related preprints
over the observed period.

1. INTRODUCTION
The concepts of preprinting, a practice of presenting scientific/scholarly papers to the
scientific community before they are published in peer-reviewed journals, date back to the 17th
century (Moore, 1965). In the modern era, one of the first large-scale attempts to share
unpublished works was the Information Exchange Group (IEG) experiment. It was carried out by
the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the 1960s (Cobb, 2017), with the goal of speeding up
information dissemination and promoting discussion (Green, 1964). Although the project had
numerous members, it was brought to an early and infamous end after several discouraging
editorials had been published (Abelson, 1966; “Four years of information exchange,” 1966). The
proposal for the Physics Information Exchange (PIE) (Cobb, 2017) elicited similar unfavorable
reactions. It was called offensive (“Unpublished Literature,” 1966), and declared “a serious
threat to physics communication and to the physics research community” by the editor of the
Physical Review (Pasternack, 1966). After this setback, it took years for PIE to start, but finally,
it evolved into the first major preprint server (Till, 2001) – arXiv - currently distributing articles in
the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance,
statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics (“arXiv,” n.d.).
While preprinting is a standard practice in some fields (Berg et al., 2016), it is still
uncommon in biomedicine (Fu and Hughey, 2019). Nowadays this seems like a paradox since
the IEG, one of the first attempts to establish a platform for sharing preprints, was focused on
the biomedical field. It took years for biomedical preprints servers to be established, even
though the initiative was present but often disregarded. For instance, Harold Varmus, Nobel
prize winner and director of NIH, proposed the development of a preprint repository to
“accelerate much-needed public discussion of electronic publication“ (Varmus, 1999) in 1999.
After several failed attempts to establish preprints servers (Nature Precedings and ClinMed
Netprints) (“About Precedings,” n.d.; Cobb, 2017), bioRxiv was finally started (Callaway and
Powell, 2016) - currently one of the largest preprint servers in the field.
Through preprints, authors can rapidly share their findings and receive feedback from
other scientists. Both sides can profit from this - authors by improving their manuscripts before
submitting them to journals, based on the received feedback; whilst others could steer their
research in accordance with the newest findings that would otherwise be unknown for months.
Furthermore, some authors even believe that the lack of peer-review is beneficial since it does
not restrain the sharing of worthwhile ideas that might be falsely disregarded and overlooked in
the editorial process (Green, 1964). On the other hand, there is a concern that without peerreview, preprints might be of lower quality (Nabavi Nouri et al., 2020). Both bioRxiv and
medRxiv explicitly declare that preprints “should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical
practice/health-related behavior, or be reported in news media as established information”.
However, peer-review is also prone to bias and the evidence of its effectiveness is scarce
(Carneiro et al., 2020; Jefferson et al., 2002; Smith, 2006; Vercellini et al., 2016).
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted a need for rapid
communication and discussion of scientific information and resulted in an unprecedented surge
in the number of publications on various aspects of the disease. Publishers greatly shortened
the peer-review process for COVID-19-related manuscripts (Homolak et al., 2020; Horbach,
2020; Kun, 2020). Be it due to elementary greed or to a praiseworthy desire to disseminate
information, such a practice is not necessarily beneficial – concerns about the quality of articles

published under these circumstances have been raised (Homolak et al., 2020). Preprinting
apparently became a necessity – not only by enabling rapid dissemination of information but
also by encouraging public discussion and providing an opportunity for peers to intervene early
if methodological fallacies are identified and limit the spread of misinformation to improve the
overall quality of the manuscripts. We aimed: a) to evaluate preprinting trends for COVID-19related and non-related manuscripts on two key biomedical preprint platforms bioRxiv and
medRxiv during the COVID-19 pandemic; b) to estimate the extent to which the preprints were
commented on (as an indicator of the extent of “pre-submission peer-review”); c) to estimate
whether COVID-19 manuscripts are favored over non-COVID-19 manuscripts for journal
publishing; d) to probe the feasibility of the assumption that published COVID-19 papers are
(under the circumstances of shortened peer-review process) more commonly flawed than the
published non-COVID-19 papers.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Study outline and study outcomes
Types of datasets used and their purpose in the present study are outlined in Figure 1. We
defined three objectives based on their relevance (objective 1 – most relevant, objective 3 –
least relevant) and the anticipated level of susceptibility to bias/confounding (objective 1 – least
susceptible, objective 3 – most susceptible), given the nature of the study and the type of data.
The 1st objective was to investigate whether COVID-19-related preprints were favored (over
non-related) for publication in peer-reviewed journals. We considered that the probability of
publishing was the most informative outcome in this respect and that further insight would be
obtained from submission-to-acceptance data. Therefore, we defined three outcomes for the
purpose: (i) primary outcome was the probability of publishing within 120 days since the
deposition of the first preprint version and was assessed in a subset of preprints deposited till
June 29, 2020. Since the time-period during which manuscripts could have been preprinted and
published was bounded (January 1 – November 01, 2020), to reduce the risk of bias arising
from unequal “time-at-risk” (for publishing), the analysis was restricted to preprints deposited till
June 29 and a time-window for the publishing of 120 days. We considered it to be a reasonable
period of time for the submission and review process to take place, and it was “available” to all
preprints in this subset; (ii) secondary outcome was the probability of publishing over the entire
observed period (i.e., before November 01, 2020) and it was assessed in a subset of preprints
deposited before September 27, 2020. All articles published after November 01, 2020, were
considered unpublished. We considered this outcome to be complementary to the primary
outcome, which was susceptible to bias arising from a possibility that not all preprinted
manuscripts were actually submitted to journals at the same time, i.e., that they might have
been purposely left in a preprint form over a longer period of time. To further reduce
bias/confounding arising from unequal “time-at-risk”, preprints in both datasets were stratified
into 15-day strata regarding the date of the first preprinted version. Due to the limited number of
COVID-19 related preprints, the first two strata (Jan. 01 - 15 and Jan. 16 - 30) were merged into
one stratum; (iii) tertiary outcome was submission-to-acceptance time, considered a proxy of the
length of the peer-review process, and was assessed in a subset of preprints that were
published in peer-reviewed journals during the observed period and submitted to journals after

January 01, 2020. Here, we anticipated potential confounding arising from varying interest in
COVID-19-related and non-related topics over time, so manuscripts were stratified into 15-day
strata regarding the journal submission dates. The 2nd objective was to illustrate preprinting
trends of COVID-19-related and non-related manuscripts on bioRxiv and medRxiv, their usage
statistics and to estimate the extent of the public peer-review (i.e., pre-submission peer-review)
using the number of posted comments and Altmetric data as proxies. This was assessed using
all preprints deposited at the two platforms between January 1 and December 05, 2020. The 3rd
objective was to evaluate a possible association between the publication topic (COVID-19related or non-related) and quality issues related to the published papers using notifications on
retraction or issuance of concerns or corrections as proxies. This was assessed using data on
all published papers indexed in PubMed and all notifications issued in the Retraction Watch
Database (“Retraction Watch Database,” n.d.) between January 1 and December 05, 2020.
2.2. Data collection
All data retrieval and management were done in R (version 4.0.2) (“The R Project for
Statistical Computing,” n.d.). Rbiorxiv and medrxivr packages were used to access bioRxiv and
medRxiv application programming interfaces (APIs) and to collect metadata and usage statistics
on the preprinted manuscripts (January 1 – December 05, 2020). COVID-19 preprints were
identified using the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus disease 19 OR
2019-nCoV. All other preprints were classified as non-COVID-19 preprints. Publication status
was retrieved from bioRxiv and medRxiv services. Publication dates of articles with bioRxiv
preprints were provided by the bioRxiv API. Rcrossref was used to gather publication dates for
journal-published preprints, initially deposited on the medRxiv. The DisqusR and rAltmetric
packages were used to access the Disqus and Altmetric API and identify the number of
comments and to retrieve Altmetric data for each preprint deposited on bioRxiv and medRxiv
servers. Submission and acceptance dates for published preprints were fetched from PubMed
with the RISmed package. The Retraction Watch Database was used to retrieve the number of
COVID-19-related articles with issued retraction notice, expression of concern, or correction
during 2020 (till December 05). To retrieve “control groups”, 7 search phrases were
constructed: 4 were used to retrieve the number of retraction notice, expression of concern, or
correction pertaining to chosen viruses and their associated diseases (HIV, Hepatitis virus,
Herpes virus and Influenza); 2 were used to retrieve the numbers pertaining to 2 topics
(immunology and epidemiology of viral infectious diseases); 1 was used to retrieve the number
of retraction notice, expression of concern or corrections issued for all COVID-19-unrelated
articles (total number - COVID-19 number). The exact search methodology is depicted under
Table 3. All numbers are expressed as a proportion of the total number of articles indexed by
PubMed. To minimize the time-at-risk risk bias, only a comparison of articles published in 2020
was made. Albeit, the risk of bias still exists due to the possibility of different publishing rates of
articles during 2020. To avoid bias due to possible over- or underrepresentation of the COVID19 articles in PubMed, in comparison with the Retraction Watch database, we repeated the
analysis using only data provided by the PubMed database. The search was conducted using
the search term (Retracted Publication[PT] OR "Retraction:"[title]) AND ("2020/01/01"[Date Publication] : "2020/12/05"[Date - Publication]), with and without “AND (COVID-19 OR SARS-

CoV-2 OR “Coronavirus disease 19” OR 2019-nCoV)”, to identify the number of retractions of
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles during 2020.
2.3. Data analysis
All data visualization and analysis were performed in R (version 4.0.2) (“The R Project
for Statistical Computing,” n.d.). Data on preprinting trends over time, preprint usage statistics,
Altmetric data and Disqus comments on the manuscripts preprinted during the observed period,
and Retraction Watch Database data on the published papers were summarized by the
preprinting platform and topic (COVID-19-related or not).
Probability of publishing within 120 days since the 1st preprint version and the probability
of publishing over the entire observed period were analysed by fitting stratified (in respect to
preprint date) logistic regression (package survival, function clogit). Submission-to-acceptance
time was analyzed by fitting a hierarchical (mixed) model with the submission date stratum as a
random effect. Articles with submission dates before 2020 were excluded from the dataset that
was used for analyzing submission-to-acceptance time. Fixed effects in all analyses were topic
(COVID-19-related or non-related), preprinting platform (bioRxiv or medRxiv), and the number
of preprinted versions (dichotomized as one or ≥2). The latter adjustment was introduced to
account for potential bias arising from different intentions of the preprinting authors. For
example, a preprint might have been submitted to a journal at the time of preprinting, or it might
have been a work in progress with several versions and purposely (only) kept as a preprint over
a longer period of time; more preprinted versions might have improved the quality of the final
submitted version, hence peer-review process might have been shorter.
We conducted a supplemental analysis of preprinting/publishing trends and other
aspects of bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints over a longer period of time that we found informative
for discussion of the results of the main study (see Supplemental Material, Supplemental
methods).
2.4. Submission-to-acceptance dataset validation
After all articles with submission dates before January 1, 2020, were removed, we
identified and excluded one article with the submission-to-acceptance time of -1 days (an
obvious mistake). To validate the dataset, submission and acceptance dates were checked for
100 randomly selected articles. For 1 article we could not find the submission and acceptance
dates on the journal website, nor published pdf of the article. One article with erroneous values
was identified (the acceptance date was off by 1 day). We considered that the number and size
of errors were acceptable and not likely to affect the conclusions of the study.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Are COVID-19-related preprints favored for publishing in peer-reviewed journals?
The subset of preprints deposited till June 29, 2020, and used to evaluate the probability
of publishing within 120 days since the 1st preprint version comprised a total of 18810 preprints
on bioRxiv (6.34% COVID-19-related and 93.66% non-related) and a total of 6576 preprints on
medRxiv (64.92% COVID-19-related and 35.08% non-related) (Fig. 2). The subset of preprints
deposited till September 27, 2020, and used to evaluate the probability of publishing over the
entire observed period (before November 01, 2020) comprised 28481 preprints on bioRxiv
(6.86% COVID-19-related and 93.14% non-related) and 10320 preprints on medRxiv (63.67%
COVID-19-related and 36.33% non-related) (Fig. 2). Raw proportions of published papers by
the topic and preprinting platform are depicted in Figure 2. In multivariate analyses (Table 1),
COVID-19-related preprints were associated with higher odds of publishing within 120 days than
non-COVID-19 preprints (OR=2.04, 95%CI 1.87-2.23), and with a higher probability of
publishing over the observed period than non-COVID-19 preprints (OR=1.42, 95%CI 1.33-1.52).
The probability for both outcomes was higher for preprints deposited on bioRxiv and lower for
preprints with ≥2 versions than for those with only one version (Table 1). Journal submission-to-

acceptance time was identified for preprints published before November 01, 2020. In
multivariate analysis, the COVID-19-related topic was associated with almost 40 days shorter
submission-to-acceptance time (mean difference -38.67, 95%CI -42.39 to -34.96) (Table 2). The
preprinting platform and number of preprint versions did not appear associated with the
outcome (Table 2).

3.2. Preprinting trends, usage statistics, and indicators of public pre-submission peer-review
For the observed period (Jan. 1 – Dec. 05, 2020) we identified a total of 13257 preprints
newly deposited at medRxiv [8298 (62.6%) COVID-19-related)], and 36267 preprints deposited
at bioRxiv [2493 (6.87%) COVID-19-related]. There was a clear increasing trend in the number
of newly deposited preprints (Fig 3A), but on medRxiv, the increase was largely due to the
increasing number of COVID-19-related preprints, while the number of newly deposited
preprints on bioRxiv appeared comparable for COVID-19-related and not related topics (Fig.
3A). Usage statistics of bioRxiv preprint server indicated an increase in the number of abstract
views, full-text views, and PDF downloads (Fig. 3B).

The overall proportion of preprints that have been commented on is rather low (5.7%),
but somewhat higher for COVID-19-related preprints (Fig. 4A): 21.6% and 3.2% of the COVID19-related and not related preprints respectively, on bioRxiv; and 12.9% and 2.4% respectively,
on medRxiv. By far, the most preprints that were commented on, received only one comment
(Fig. 4B).
Altmetric score, indicative of the public attention received by the preprints, appeared
somewhat higher for COVID-19-related than for non-related preprints, particularly those posted
on bioRxiv (vs. medRxiv) (Fig. 4C). Closer examination revealed that all preprints were
mentioned on the Twitter platform (likely because of bots that tweet all deposited articles), a
smaller percentage were mentioned in blog posts and news outlets, and a negligible number of
preprints were mentioned on other venues (Fig. 4D). Grouped by the topic and preprint server,
mentioning of the preprints on the Twitter platform closely reflected the overall Altmetric score.
COVID-19-related preprints appeared more commonly shared on Facebook and blogs than
non-COVID-19-related preprints (Fig. 4E). Preprints posted on the more clinically-oriented
medRxiv were more reported in news outlets compared to those posted on bioRxiv (Fig. 4E).
3.3. Potential quality issues
A total of 345 notices were identified in the Retraction Watch Database, related to the articles
published between January 01, 2020, and December 05, 2020, of which 46 were related to
COVID-19. Comparison of the number of issued notices for COVID-19-related articles and
articles pertaining to 4 different viruses and viral diseases and 2 different topics is depicted in
Table 3. Briefly, only articles pertaining to herpes viruses had a higher approximated retraction
rate than the COVID-19-related articles. COVID-19 articles had more retractions/expressions of
concern/corrections than COVID-19-unrelated, articles pertaining to 3 viruses and their
associated diseases (HIV, influenza, and hepatitis virus) and 2 topics related to COVID-19
(epidemiology of infectious diseases and immunology). Similarly, by searching PubMed we
discovered that the retraction rate for COVID-19 articles was higher than for COVID-19unrelated articles, although the difference is not so prominent (0.15‰ vs 0.13‰).

4. DISCUSSION
The present study was motivated primarily by previous observations of shorter
submission-to-acceptance time for published COVID-19-related vs. non-related manuscripts
(Homolak et al., 2020; Horbach, 2020; Kun, 2020), a phenomenon suggestive of preference of
COVID-19-related manuscripts for publication in the peer-reviewed journals during the COVID19 pandemic. The present data support such a view by demonstrating an independent
association between COVID-19-related topic and a higher probability of publishing but have two
major limitations that preclude straightforward generalizations: a) the analysis was limited only
to a subset of all manuscripts “produced” during the observed period, i.e., those that were
preprinted. This, however, was the only reasonable choice – these are the only manuscripts
whose existence could be clearly verified and for which the risk (probability) of publishing could
be (prospectively) estimated; b) the observed period was bounded (January 1 to November 01,
2020), which might have affected the outcomes: our supplemental analysis indicates that it
could take up to around 500 days for a preprint to get published (Supplemental Figure S1),
hence the present observations might simply reflect a certain lag-time present for non-COVID19-related preprints. Therefore, the present results pertain and should be interpreted specifically
with respect to preprinted manuscripts and the observed period which almost completely
overlaps with the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We particularly accounted for potential
bias arising from unequal “time at risk” by definition of two complementary outcomes

differentially affected by the bounded observational period, and by stratification of preprints in
respect to preprinting date. With adjustment for several other (albeit not all potentially relevant)
potential sources of bias that could be captured in this kind of a study, the present estimates
should be considered accurate. The observed considerably shorter submission-to-acceptance
time for the published COVID-19-related vs. non-related preprints further supports the
conclusion about the preference of COVID-19-related topics and is in line with observations
pertaining to all published papers (Homolak et al., 2020; Horbach, 2020; Kun, 2020). In this
respect, the present data should be viewed as reasonably indicative for all papers (during the
COVID-19 pandemics) in general.
Increased preference (due to any reason) for the publishing of COVID-19-related (vs.
non-related) papers combined with shorter submission-to-acceptance time, indicative of a
shorter peer-review (and thus unlikely to be thorough and meaningful), creates a situation that
could be reasonably considered susceptible to the impulsive release of publications of
inadequate quality, i.e., susceptible to publishing bad or incorrect science, or just nonsense (e.g.
article reporting a link between 5G and SARS-CoV-2) (Fioranelli et al., 2020). At least
theoretically, preprinting provides a (possible) way to ameliorate this problem by opening a time
window for public pre-submission peer-review that could complement the journal peer-review.
The extent, quality and relevance of any peer-review, and in particular the public pre-submission
peer-review, is difficult to quantify. The present data, using the number of comments pertaining
to preprinted manuscripts as a proxy, do not suggest that such a practice is actually common:
only around 5% of the preprints were commented on, typically with only one comment. On a
positive side, COVID-19-related papers received more comments (than non-related), suggesting
that these preprints are (at least) publicly discussed. Just as observed by others (Yeo-Teh and
Tang, 2020), the present results indicate that published COVID-19 articles, at the present state,
have a higher retraction rate than non-COVID-19 articles. However, our data should be viewed
with additional caution – reporting retractions, corrections, and expression of concern as
fractions with numbers obtained from PubMed is not optimal and is only an approximation.
Furthermore, as Abritis et al. have warned (Abritis et al., 2020), it is hard to compare the number
of retracted articles given that it takes years for article retractions. There is a possibility that the
retraction numbers of non-COVID-19 articles are only lagging and will eventually catch up with
the COVID-19 articles. Additionally, higher retraction rates might reflect greater public scrutiny,
not necessarily lower quality.
While not the primary focus of this article, our limited data supports claims that
preprinting in the biomedical field has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fraser et al.,
2020). Several other preprint-related activities, like deposition of more than one preprint version,
shortened time between versions, or changes of preprint titles (as compared to the time period
before the pandemic) also seem to be intensified (see Supplemental Figure S2 and S3). We
hold this fact to be much needed and long overdue. We believe that unfeigned quality concerns
due to lack of peer-review are (more or less) surmountable by the audiences’ critical approach.
On the other hand, lack of peer-review and editorial screening might be advantageous with
respect to the speed of information sharing, open discussion, and lack of “censorship”. This
could reduce the need for hasty publication of inadequate papers in scientific journals. In
addition to causing a distrust towards science, the damage done by the poor journal-published
articles is hard to rectify, largely due to the false sense of unquestionable credibility assigned to

articles published in peer-reviewed journals. This concern in the context of COVID-19 pandemic
has already been recognized and brought up by Serge Horbach declaring that “nonsense or
incorrect science in one of these papers is potentially much more harmful” (Kwon, 2020). One
illustrative example from the past is the infamous case of the article reporting a link between
MMR vaccine and autism that drives distrust towards vaccination even today, years after its
retraction (Omer, 2020).
Finally, in addition to the advantages for the profession and science, preprints might be a
valuable “tool” for researching science itself. Preprinting provides an opportunity to study what
happens “behind the curtains” of the hidden journal submission process (i.e. provides an
opportunity to study the peer-review itself). We hope this will be recognized and utilized in the
future. However, incorrect identification of the journal published preprints is one of the obstacles
that have yet to be overcome. A significant number of preprints has not been identified as
published by bioRxiv/medRxiv services (Abdill and Blekhman, 2019), even though the
declaration is posted on their website stating that this happens “on rare occasions” because
authors or titles have changed (“Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ),” n.d.). This is potentially (if
the error rate is not similar in COVID-19-related vs -unrelated preprints) the most significant
limitation of this study.
In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there appeared an increasing preprinting
trend on bioRxiv or medRxiv. In the case of the latter platform, the trend is primarily due to the
preprinting of COVID-19-related manuscripts. COVID-19-related preprints are more likely to be
published in the peer-reviewed journals and their submission-to-acceptance time (a proxy for
the peer-review process) is considerably shorter than for the COVID-19 non-related
manuscripts. COVID-19-related preprints received more comments on the preprinting platforms,
but the proportion of preprints commented-on is generally modest. This suggests that the
opportunity of public pre-submission peer-review, inherent to the concept of preprinting, is not
seized to any relevant extent. Retractions and issued concerns/corrections were sporadic
regarding the papers published (and indexed in PubMed) between January 1 and December 05,
2020, but the incidence of retractions/concerns/corrections was higher for published COVID-19related than for non-related papers. Overall data support a view that so far, COVID-19-related
manuscripts were favored for publishing in peer-reviewed journals, commonly with very short
peer-review.
