Summary
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), death and
long-term sequelae. Innate immune cells are critical for host defense but are also the primary drivers of
ARDS. The relationships between innate cellular responses in ARDS resulting from COVID-19
compared to other causes of ARDS, such as bacterial sepsis is unclear. Moreover, the beneficial effects of
dexamethasone therapy during severe COVID-19 remain speculative but understanding the mechanistic
effects could improve evidence-based therapeutic interventions. To interrogate these relationships, we
developed an scRNAseq atlas that is freely accessible (biernaskielab.ca/COVID_neutrophil). We
discovered that compared to bacterial ARDS, COVID-19 was associated with distinct neutrophil
polarization characterized by either interferon (IFN) or prostaglandin (PG) active states. Neutrophils from
bacterial ARDS had higher expression of antibacterial molecules such as PLAC8 and CD83.
Dexamethasone therapy in COVID patients rapidly altered the IFNactive state, downregulated interferon
responsive genes, and activated the IL1R2+ve neutrophils. Dexamethasone also induced the emergence of
immature neutrophils expressing immunosuppressive molecules ARG1 and ANXA1, which were not
present in healthy controls. Moreover, dexamethasone remodeled global cellular interactions by changing
neutrophils from information receivers into information providers. Importantly, male patients had higher
proportions of IFNactive neutrophils and a greater degree of steroid-induced immature neutrophil
expansion. Indeed, the highest proportion of IFNactive neutrophils was associated with mortality. These
results define neutrophil states unique to COVID-19 when contextualized to other life-threatening
infections, thereby enhancing the relevance of our findings at the bedside. Furthermore, the molecular
benefits of dexamethasone therapy are also defined. The identified molecular pathways can now be
targeted to develop improved therapeutics.

COVID-19 ARDS host responses contextualized to bacterial ARDS.
A broad array of infections including SARS-CoV-2 and bacterial sepsis can induce acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure and death1-3. Neutrophils are thought to be key drivers of
both COVID-19 and bacterial ARDS4-6, yet it is unclear if this is related to intrinsic and/or irreversible
cellular responses. We studied critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units and compared
COVID-19 ARDS to bacterial sepsis with ARDS (herein referred to as bacterial ARDS) (Extended Fig
1a-b). Patient cohorts had comparable ages, sex, days on life support and time in hospital, but COVID-19
patients had broader racial diversity (Extended Fig 1c, Extended Data Table 1). Bacterial ARDS induced
significant neutrophilia, and relative thrombocytopenia compared to the near normal circulating
neutrophil numbers in COVID-19, while both had similar degrees of lymphopenia (Extended Fig 1d).
Both cohorts had comparable PaO2 / FiO2 (P/F) ratios, which is an indicator of the severity of ARDS7,
but bacterial ARDS patients had significantly more kidney injury demonstrated by higher levels of serum
creatinine (Extended Fig 1e). We further compared families of soluble inflammatory markers used to
distinguish prototypical states, including those identified during cytokine storm (Extended Fig 1f) and
cytokine release syndrome (Extended Fig 1g)8, which demonstrated significantly more IL-1α and IFN-γ
in COVID-19, but similar levels of IL-6 and TNF-α to bacterial ARDS patients. Therefore, in the context
of life-threatening bacterial ARDS, COVID-19 ARDS patients had normal neutrophil counts, comparable
IL-6 levels, and less organ failure, all of which have been previously proposed as markers of COVID
disease severity9,10. This prompted us to further investigate immune states and composition in response to
COVID-19 compared to bacterial ARDS.
The online companion atlas (biernaskielab.ca/COVID_neutrophil) contains accessible scRNAseq data
performed on freshly obtained whole blood at timepoint 1 (t1, <72h after ICU admission) and then at
timepoint 2 (t2, 7 days after t1). Cellular identity was mapped to 30 immune cell types/states using a
UMAP projection from 21 patients and 86,935 cells (Fig 1a, Extended Figure 2 a-b). Global magnitude of
gene expression was directly compared between COVID-19 and bacterial ARDS patients (Extended Data

Table 2), which revealed a more globally altered distribution of differential expression at t1 than at t2.
Altered regulation of genes was most pronounced in neutrophils at t1, with lower neutrophil gene
expression in COVID-19 compared to bacterial ARDS (Fig 1b; Extended Fig 2c). At t2, the global
alterations in gene expression when comparing COVID-19 to bacterial ARDS were most pronounced in
plasmablasts (Fig 1c; Extended Fig 2d). We further compared and quantified the proportions of known
peripheral blood cellular constituents, which highlighted significant differences in CD4 T cells, CD8 T
cells and NK cells (Extended Fig 2e). These data highlight that significant global differences in immune
cell gene expression exist between COVID-19 ARDS and bacterial ARDS.
COVID-19 drives specific neutrophil maturation states.
Neutrophils are a primary participant in the development of ARDS11; yet despite similar severity of
ARDS between our bacterial and COVID-19 cohorts, the numbers of circulating neutrophils from clinical
cell counts were significantly different (Extended Fig 1e). We hypothesized that neutrophil qualitative
states may be important determinants of disease. Neutrophils were subjected to velocity analysis12,13 to
reconstruct maturation dynamics. Louvain clusters (Fig 1d), clinical cohort, individual patient, and
velocity length were overlayed on velocity vector fields (Extended Fig 3a-d). The proportions of distinct
neutrophil states were compared at t1 and this revealed a divergent expansion of IFNactive neutrophils
(clusters 2, 4 and 5) in COVID-19, which became similar to bacterial ARDS at t7 (Fig 1e, f). Relative to
healthy donors, the IFNactive population in both COVID-19 and bacterial ARDS patients were significantly
higher (Extended Fig 4a-f), suggesting that pathogen challenge alters neutrophil dynamics and that
comparing COVID-19 neutrophils to healthy neutrophils would mask COVID-19 specific responses.
Hence, comparing neutrophils from COVID-19 to bacterial ARDS imparts nuanced understanding of the
neutrophil response specific to COVID-19.

Classically, peripheral neutrophils are considered terminally differentiated and non-dividing, however the
increase in velocity length suggested the ability to alter phenotypic states once in circulation along
specific paths or ‘lineages’. COVID-19 neutrophils followed unique maturation paths compared to
bacterial ARDS, culminating in three distinct terminal states: Interferon active (IFNactive), prostaglandin
active (PGactive) or bacterial ARDS enriched (Fig 1d-f; Extended Fig 3e-k). Interestingly, the apex of this
trajectory was marked by high velocity lengths, characteristic of cells undergoing differentiation
(Extended Fig 3c, d). COVID-19 neutrophils preferentially transitioned from the apex of the trajectory,
which was an immature state (TOP2A expressing; Extended Fig 3f) to an IFN responsive state
characterized by IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFI6 expression (Cluster 1 to 4 and 5; Fig 1g; Extended Fig 3e, g,
i, l). This is clearly illustrated in Extended Video 1. This immature state was not present in healthy
controls, though it is present in both comparator groups, suggesting these states are liberated into
circulation upon pathogen exposure (Extended Fig 4e-f). The lineage relationship was less clear for
COVID-19 enriched PGactive clusters defined by prostaglandin responsive genes (clusters 2, 6 and 8), with
notable increases in PTGER4 and PTGS2 (or COX2), a proposed therapeutic target in COVID-1914 (Fig
1i; Extended Fig 3e, h, k, l). The dominant conventional bacterial ARDS state was characterized by
antibacterial proteins CD8315 and PLAC816 (cluster 3 to 0; Fig 1h; Extended Fig 3e, j, l). Taken together,
this data demonstrated that peripheral neutrophils have dynamic programming abilities which result in
COVID-19 specific neutrophil polarization defined by the emergence of IFNactive and PGactive neutrophil
states.

Unique transcriptional regulatory pathways drive neutrophil maturation in COVID-19.
Rapid and robust IFN responses protect against COVID-19 severe disease, while delayed responses could
exacerbate systemic and pulmonary inflammation17,18. Moreover, neutrophil IFN responses are not
traditionally considered during infections and neutrophils are generally considered to be homogenous,
with a uniform proinflammatory capacity. Global neutrophil expression aligned with neutrophil state
specific markers, such as interferon response genes (IFITM1, RSAD2, IFI6, and ISG10), being more
highly expressed in COVID-19 neutrophils (Fig 2a; Extended Fig 3i). The inverse was the case for antibacterial proteins like PLAC8 (Fig 2a; Extended Fig 3f, g, i). However, the discovery of differential
neutrophil states prompted further exploration of the factors driving neutrophil state polarization. Gene
regulatory network reconstruction using SCENIC analysis19 revealed differentially activated transcription
factors STAT1, IRF1 and PRDM1 in COVID-19 (Fig 2b), while bacterial ARDS neutrophils had
increased prototypical granulocyte transcription factors such as CEBPA, CEBPB, STAT5B and less
defined factors such as NFE2 (Fig 2b, Extended Fig 5a). PRDM1 activation was most pronounced in the
IFNactive neutrophil population and was likely responsible for driving expression of interferon response
elements (IFIT1, ISG15, IFI6) and antiviral signaling, such as RSAD2 and STAT1 (Fig 2c; Extended Fig
5b-h). A hallmark of PGactive neutrophil polarization was the activation of an E2F4 pathway (Fig 2d),
while neutrophil programming during bacterial ARDS included STAT5B (Fig 2e). To summarize, in
response to COVID-19, neutrophils were polarized by unique transcriptional regulation towards one of
two main populations, either an IFNactive population or a PGactive population (Fig 2f).

Dexamethasone therapy alters immune cell transcriptomics.
Conventional therapeutics have limited efficacy for COVID-19, and while dexamethasone offers a
moderate benefit, the RECOVERY trial reported the benefit was greatest in the most severely affected
patients20. However, the mechanisms underlying this benefit are unclear and not universal, so opportunity
exists to optimize or better target this therapy. Global differences in transcription were apparent at t1
(within 72 hours of ICU admission) with clear upregulation of genes in neutrophils and some T cell
subsets in COVID-19 patients treated with dexamethasone versus those that were not treated (Fig 3a-c,
Extended Data Table 3). Dexamethasone globally downregulated genes at t1, including in naïve B cells,
plasmablasts and some T cells (Extended Figure 6a-d). At t2 gene upregulation occurred in adaptive
immune cells, including naïve and effector CD8 T cells, with limited alterations in the innate myeloid cell
lineages including neutrophils. However, neutrophils demonstrated clear down regulation of genes at t2,
as did CD4 naïve and central memory T cells (Extended Figure 6c, d). Proportionally, at t1,
dexamethasone significantly increased the number of cytotoxic CD4 T cells, naïve B cells, plasmablasts,
and decreased proliferating NK cells, and CD4 effector memory cells (Extended Fig 6e). By d7,
dexamethasone therapy suppressed the proportions of neutrophils in circulation compared to untreated
(13% vs 41%).

Dexamethasone therapy restrains neutrophil IFN programs
Due to the early and sustained effects of dexamethasone on gene expression in neutrophils, the effects of
dexamethasone therapy on neutrophil functional states were evaluated. Neutrophil reclustering again
identified immature neutrophils at the apex of the maturation trajectory, accelerating and exhibiting
maximal divergence prior to PGactive and IFNactive state commitments (Fig. 3 d, Extended Fig 7a-d).
Interestingly, we also identified IL7R+ve neutrophils (comprising roughly 8% of total neutrophils) whose
trajectories remained completely separate (Fig. 3 d, Extended Fig 7h) suggesting an entirely distinct
neutrophil state. Initially, dexamethasone therapy increased global transcription in PGactive neutrophils,
while ongoing therapy resulted in the emergence of a PGactive neutrophils concomitant with high IL1R2
expression (IL1R2+ve) (Fig. 3 e). Conversely, dexamethasone had a pronounced attenuation of global
transcription of IFNactive neutrophils at t1 and t2 (Fig 3 d, e). Remarkably, dexamethasone administration
at t1 halted dynamic state changes in IFNactive and IL7R+ve neutrophils, followed by preferential depletion
of IFNactive subsets (Fig 3 f). In the context of healthy controls, dexamethasone reduced IFNactive neutrophil
proportions closer to that seen in healthy controls (Extended Fig 4).
Consensus DEG analysis highlighted that upregulation of IL1R2, a decoy receptor that sequesters IL-1,
and downregulation of IFITM1 were the most prominent discriminating features of treatment with or

without steroids (Fig. 3g). Additionally, dexamethasone attenuated neutrophil expression of IFN
pathways more broadly, highlighted by decreases in ISGs including IFITM1-3, IFIT1, ISG15 and RSAD2
(Fig 3g). Examination of unspliced pre-mRNA to mature spliced mRNA ratios supported the notion that
induction of immunoregulatory systems (i.e., IL-1R2; Fig 3 h) and suppression of IFN (i.e., IFITM1; Fig
3 i) programs were driven by differential splicing kinetics.
Dexamethasone therapy intensifies neutrophil immunosuppressive function
Cortiocsteroid therapy shifted neutrophil state compositions. While IFNactive neutrophils were significantly
depleted by seven days of therapy, there was >2-fold expansion in immature neutrophils relative to nontreated COVID-19 controls (Fig 4a), which were absent in the healthy controls. Albeit anecdotal, the
dominance of IFNactive neutrophils at t1 in the patient who succumbed to COVID-19 in the nondexamethasone cohort further supports depletion of IFNactive neutrophils as a mechanism by which
dexamethasone is protective (Extended Fig 9 a-d). Assessment of gene regulatory networks demonstrated
that IRF7 and MEF2A exhibited opposing activation patterns, with IRF7 being the most suppressed and
MEF2A the most enhanced transcription factors identified with dexamethasone, which correlates with the
emergence of PGactive and IL1R2+ve states and attenuation of the IFNactive neutrophil states (Fig 4b,
Extended Fig 7e-k). Unexpectedly, steroids induced an increase in circulating immature neutrophils,
which highly expressed TOP2A, and activated ATF4 and JDP2, transcription factors signatures seen in
undifferentiated cells or those undergoing nuclear reprogramming (Extended Fig 7f, g). Interestingly,
these immature neutrophils expressed high levels of ARG1, ANXA1 (Fig 4c), suggesting an
immunomodulatory role22,23,24-26 that was increased with dexamethasone treatment. Both ARG1 and
ANXA1 express glucocorticoid response elements, supporting direct regulation post dexamethasone
treatment21,27.
To further understand the role of neutrophils during COVID-19 and the effects of dexamethasone, we
investigated cellular connectomes. Cellular interactions between many cell types (including highly
interactive neutrophils) were noted (Extended Fig 8a), and dexamethasone altered the globally predicted
12

interactions by suppressing intercellular signalling, in both number and strength of interactions (Extended
Fig 7b, c). However, dexamethasone enhanced neutrophil specific signalling interactions (Fig 4d).
Annexin family signalling, which was enhanced in the immature neutrophils and represent powerful
immunomodulators, were augmented between neutrophils and the other circulating immune cells when
patients received dexamethasone (Fig 4d). Of note is the direction of annexin family signaling, which
switched from incoming toward neutrophils without dexamethasone treatment to being almost entirely
outgoing from neutrophils toward B intermediate and memory cells and MAIT cells following
dexamethasone (Fig 4e, f). Therefore, dexamethasone directly altered neutrophil functional states, by
promoting expansion of an ARG1+/ANXA1+ immature state with immunosuppressive features and
altered the global communication structure such that neutrophils became active instructors of some
peripheral immune cells.
Neutrophil response to dexamethasone is sexually dimorphic
Given the apparent clinical benefit of dexamethasone is more evident in males20, and since males are
predisposed towards more severe COVID-19 presentations and outcomes28 , we surmised that
dexamethasone exhibits sexually dimorphic immunosuppressive effects. Interestingly, while neutrophils
were depleted in both sexes post-dexamethasone, this was particularly pronounced in males (1.9 FC
higher in males at t1 and 3.4 FC higher in males at t2, Extended Fig 9e). Of the two salient neutrophil
state alterations, ARG1+ve immunosuppressive states were preferentially expanded in males (Extended
Fig. 9e) whereas ISGs were preferentially suppressed (Extended Fig. 9f) and IFNactive states preferentially
depleted in females (Extended Fig. 9g-h) at both t1 and t2. Sexually dimorphic effects of dexamethasone
on neutrophil maturation kinetics in part explains these state alterations. Dynamo-reconstructed vector
dynamics revealed that dexamethasone slowed IFNactive transitions (Extended Fig. 9i) whilst hastening
immature (ARG1+ve immunosuppressive) neutrophil differentiation in females (Extended Fig. 9j) leading
to a depleted immature neutrophil progenitor pool.

Conclusions
Surviving SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on striking a temporal balance between inciting viral clearance
immune programs during the early stage and subsequently restraining those same programs at later stages
to limit immunity-induced tissue damage. IFN signaling stands at the nexus between antiviral immunity
and over active effector immune programs that inadvertently compromise tissue function and threaten
survival29. Our work uncovered downstream IFN signalling as a signature of a stable neutrophil state that
is selectively expanded during late stage COVID-19 infection from a common pool of immature
progenitors. Given that inborn errors 18 and suppressed early stage 6 IFN signalling predicts COVID-19
severity, increased IFNactive neutrophils in females correlated with decreased mortality30, and early
initiation of IFN therapy has been suggested to mitigate disease severity 31,32, one may posit that IFN
activity in neutrophils represents a concerted host antiviral program.
Interestingly, immunosuppression with dexamethasone, a corticosteroid known to improve mortality in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients20, suppressed COVID19-specific IFN regulatory networks and depleted
COVID19-enriched IFNactive neutrophils in favour of expanding ARG1+ immunosuppressive neutrophils.
These altered neutrophil states shared striking resemblances to bacterial ARDS, suggesting installation of
generalized microbicidal programs ameliorate the overzealous neutrophil responses during COVID-19
(and perhaps during other viral infections). While neutrophil ISG activation may promote anti-viral

immunity during early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, sustained IFN activation during late stages (e.g.,
critically ill patients requiring intensive care) could drive immunopathology of COVID-19.
Immunotherapies that support the innate antiviral immune response by decoupling IFN-exaggerated
neutrophil response whilst reinforcing acquisition of suppressor states may limit the pathogenic potential
of neutrophils and provide tremendous clinical benefit for treating severe COVID-19.
Methods
Patient enrolment. All patients were enrolled following admission to any of the four adult intensive care
units at South Health Campus, Rockyview General Hospital, Foothills Medical Center or Peter Lougheed
Center in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Patient admission to the ICU was determined by the attending ICU
physician based on the need for life sustaining interventions, monitoring and life-support. The research
teams did not participate in clinical decisions. Study inclusion required a minimal age of 18, the ability to
provide consent, or for most participants, the ability of a surrogate decision maker to provide regained
capacity consent. All participants required an arterial catheter for blood draws, but the insertion of this
catheter was at the discretion of the attending medical team. Participants required a positive clinical RNA
COVID-19 test prior to enrolment and evidence of bilateral lung infiltrates and hypoxemia consistent with
ARDS. The bacterial ARDS cohort required a negative COVID-19 test and a definitive microbiological
diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia with chest imaging consistent with a diagnosis of ARDS. Patients were
excluded if they were on immunosuppressive therapies as an outpatient, if they had established
autoimmune disease, or active malignancy. Participants were required to have a definitive diagnosis and
appropriate consent and samples collected within 72hrs of admission to the ICU in order to be included.
Timepoint 1 (T1) refers to the first blood draw, while T2 was a repeat blood draw taken 7 days after T1, if
the participant remained in the ICU, and had an arterial catheter. For each participant, whole blood was
collected via the arterial catheter and immediately processed for analysis. This study was approved by the
Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (CHREB) at the University of Calgary (Ethics ID: REB20-0481)
and is consistent with and the Declaration of Helsinki.

soluble cytokine (sCD30, sEGFR, sgp130, sIL-1RI, sIL-1RII, sIL-2Ra, sIL-4R, sIL-6R, sRAGE, sTNF
RI, sTNF RII, sVEGF R1, sVEGF R2, sVEGF R3) arrays (Millipore Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) on a
Luminex Model 200 Luminometer (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX). EDTA-plasma samples were
collected from each patient by venipuncture following a standard operating protocol (SOP) and stored at 80C until tested. Each run included a full range of calibrators.
Leukocyte and lymphocyte isolation. For lymphocyte isolation, whole blood (2mL) was collected in
5mL polystyrene round-bottom heparinized vacutubes. To isolate lymphocytes by immunomagnetic
negative selection, 100µL of Isolation Cocktail and 100µL of Rapid Spheres (EasySepTM Direct Human
Total Lymphocytes Isolation Kit: 19655, StemCell Technologies) were added to 2 mL of whole blood.
After mixing and 5min incubation at RT, the sample volumes were topped up to 2.5mL with 0.04%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. The diluted sample was incubated in the magnet without lid for
5min, at RT and negatively selected lymphocytes were decanted into a new 5 mL polystyrene tube.
Except the addition of Isolation Cocktail, all steps were repeated once. The final lymphocyte cell
suspension was transferred to a 15 mL polypropylene tube and a volume of 5mL 0.04% BSA in PBS was
added to the sample. Lymphocytes were precipitated by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000rpm, supernatant
was discarded, and cells were resuspended in 5 mL of 0.04% BSA in PBS. This last step was repeated
once, and cells were then resuspended in 100 µL of PBS+0.04% BSA. Cell density was quantified with a

hemacytometer, cell viability was assessed with Trypan Blue staining (T8154; Sigma Aldrich), and 7500
live lymphocytes were transferred to a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
For leukocyte isolation, 1 mL of whole blood from heparin containing vacutubes was transferred to 5 mL
polystyrene round-bottom tubes and 12µL of 0.5M EDTA was added. 2% FBS in PBS (1mL) and 50µL
of EasySep RBC Depletion spheres (EasySepTM RBC Depletion Reagent: 18170, Stem Cell
Technologies) were added to immunomagnetically deplete red blood cells. After 5 min of magnet
incubation at RT, cell suspension containing leukocytes was decanted into a new 5mL polystyrene tube.
To ensure complete removal of red blood cells, RBC depletion was repeated, and cell suspension
containing leukocytes was decanted into a new 15mL polypropylene tube. Leukocytes were precipitated
by centrifugation at 2000rpm for 5 min at 20oC and resuspended in 5mL of 0.04% BSA in PBS. This last
step was repeated once, and leukocytes were resuspended in 2 mL of 0.04% BSA in PBS. Cell viability
and cell density were assessed, and 7500 live leukocytes were transferred to the microcentrifuge tube
containing the lymphocyte cell suspension. The volume of the cell suspension containing 7500
lymphocytes and 7500 leukocytes in a total of 50 µL of 0.04% BSA in PBS.
Single-cell RNA-Seq library construction, alignment, and quality control. A total of 15,000 single
cells (containing an equal proportion of leukocytes and lymphocytes) were loaded for partitioning using
10X Genomics NextGEM Gel Bead emulsions (Version 3.1). All samples were processed as per
manufacturer’s protocol (with both PCR amplification steps run 12X). Quality control of resulting
libararies and quantification was performed using TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape assay (Agilent).
Sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq S2 and SP 100 cycle dual lane flow cells over
multiple rounds to ensure each sample received approximately 32,000 reads per cell. Sequencing reads
were aligned using CellRanger 3.1.0 pipeline33 to the standard pre-built GRCh38 reference genome.
Samples that passed alignment QC were aggregated into single datasets using CellRanger aggr with
between-sample normalization to ensure each sample received an equal number of mapped reads per cell.

recovered 1,872,659 cells that were sequenced to 38,410 post-normalization reads per cell. Likewise,
aggregated COVID-19 samples with (n = 9) or without (n = 12) dexamethasone recovered 1,748,551
single cells sequenced to 51,415 post-normalization reads per cell. Aggregated healthy samples recovered
19,816 cells, including 1,912 post-QC neutrophils (n = 5).
Single-cell RNA-Seq computational analyses and workflows. Filtered feature-barcode HDF5 matrices
from aggregated datasets were imported into the R package Seurat v.3.9 for normalization, scaling,
integration, multi-modal reference mapping, louvain clustering, dimensionality reduction, differential
expression analysis, and visualization 34. Briefly, cells with abnormal transcriptional complexity (fewer
than 500 UMIs, greater than 25,000 UMIs, or greater than 25% of mitochondrial reads) were considered
artifacts and were removed from subsequent analysis. Since granulocytes have relatively low RNA
content (due to high levels of RNases), QC thresholds were informed by 35 as they recently defined
several rodent and human neutrophil subsets from scRNA-Seq samples. Cell identity was classified by
mapping single cell profiles to the recently published PBMC single-cell joint RNA/CITE-Seq multi-omic
reference 36. Since no published reference automates granulocyte annotations, neutrophil clusters were
manually annotated by querying known markers (i.e. CSF3R, S100A8, S100A9, MMP8, MMP9,
ELANE, MPO) 37 and were corroborated using the R package SingleR 38. To test whether cell
composition was changed due to infection type (COVID-19 versus Bacterial ARDS) or treatment group
(dexamethasone versus non-dexamethasone), a generalized linear mixed-effects model was employed
where infection type and treatment group were considered fixed and individual patients were considered
random effect. Fitting was done with Laplace approximation using the ‘glmer’ function in the ‘lme4’ R
package 39 and p-values were calculated using the R package ‘car’. Boxplots comparing cell type
composition were generated using the ggplot2 package.
Differential cell-cell interaction networks were reconstructed using the Connectome R toolkit v0.2.240 and
CellChat v1.0.0 41. Briefly, DifferentialConnectome queried Seurat R objects housing datasets integrated
by infection type and dexamethasone status to define nodes and edges for downstream network analysis.

Total number of interactions and interaction strengths were calculated using CellChat’s
compareInteractions function. Differential edge list was passed through CircosDiff (a wrapper around the
R package ‘circlize’) and CellChat’s netVisual_chord_gene to filter receptor-ligand edges and generate
Circos plots.
Consensus DEGs and perturbation scores. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were those with an
average log fold change (FC) greater than 0.25 (p-adjusted < 0.05) as determined by Seurat’s Wilcoxon
rank-sum test. Consensus stacked bars showing cumulative log fold changes (colored by individual
sample contributions) were generated using constructConsensus function 42 for genes exhibiting
reproducible changes across patients (>3 for 72-hour comparisons, > 2 for 7-day comparisons). Gene Set
Enrichment analyses of consensus DEGs were performed using gProfiler’s g:GOSt (p-value cutoff
<0.05). A cell state-specific ‘perturbation score’ was calculated to reflect the magnitude of response
elicited by factoring in number and cumulative FC of consensus DEGs. Perturbation scores were
visualized using Nebulosa-generated density plots 43.
Constructing cellular trajectories using RNA velocity. Analysis of neutrophil trajectories was
performed by realigning CellRanger count-generated BAMs with RNA velocity command-line tool 13
using the run10x command and human (GRCh38) annotations. The output loom files containing spliced
and unspliced counts were combined to compare neutrophils in COVID-19 with Bacterial ARDS controls
and dexamethasone-treated with non-treated COVID-19 patients. For both analyses, combined looms
were imported into Seurat v.3.9 using the ReadVelocity function in SeuratWrappers v.0.2.0, normalized
using SCTransform v.0.3.2 44, reduced and projected onto a UMAP, and exported as a .h5 file using the
SaveH5Seurat function. Counts stored in H5 files were imported, filtered, and normalized as
recommended in the scVelo v.0.2.1 workflow 12. RNA velocities were estimated using stochastic and
dynamical models. Since both models yielded comparable results, stochastic model was used as default
for all subsequent analyses. Calculations stored in AnnData’s metadata were exported as CSVs and kernel
density lines depicting Velocity-inferred latent time distribution were plotted with ggplot2 v.3.1.1.

Gene Regulatory Network reconstruction. Single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering
(SCENIC)19 was employed to infer regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their
targetome by calculating and pruning co-expression modules. Briefly, neutrophils were subsetted from
scVelo-realigned Seurat object and processed using default and recommended parameters specified in
SCENIC’s vignette (https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC) using the hg19 RcisTarget reference. Regulon
activity scores (in ‘3.4_regulonAUC.Rds’, an output of the SCENIC workflow) were added to scVelo
object (using CreateAssayObject function) to jointly project trajectory and TF activity onto the same
UMAP embeddings. Consensus stacked bars showing cumulative logFC of AUCell scores for each TF
(colored by individual sample contributions) were generated by modifying the constructConsensus
function42 for SCENIC assay. Targetome of TFs predicted as drivers of neutrophil states (stored in
‘2.6_regulons_asGeneSet.Rds’) was profiled using g:Profiler’s functional enrichment analysis and genes
intersecting with the Interferon pathway were plotted using iRegulon (Cytoscape plugin)45.
COVID Neutrophil Atlas. To enable intuitive exploration of single-cell datasets, a web portal
(http://biernaskielab.ca/covid_neutrophil or http://biernaskielab.com/covid_neutrophil) was built using
RShiny v1.1.0, shinyLP v.1.1.2, and shinythemes v.1.1.2 packages.
