Abstract

30

Background: Current transmission rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

31

CoV-2) are still increasing and many countries are facing second waves of infections. Rapid SARS-

32

CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is often unavailable but could support public health

33

organizations and hospitals in monitoring and determining transmission links. Here we report the use

34

of reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), a novel technology for WGS of SARS-

35

CoV-2 enabling library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high

36

throughput screening. Additionally, we show SARS-CoV-2 diversity and possible transmission within

37

the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) during September 2020 using RC-PCR WGS.

38

Methods: A total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September

39

2020 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Ct values of the samples ranged from 16 to 42.

40

They were collected from 83 healthcare workers and three patients at the Radboudumc, in addition to

41

64 people living in the area around the hospital and tested by the local health services. For validation

42

purposes, nineteen of the included samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore

43

Technologies and compared to RC-PCR WGS results. The applicability of RC-PCR WGS in outbreak

44

analysis for public health service and hospitals was tested on six suspected clusters containing samples

45

of healthcare workers and patients with an epidemiological link.

46

Findings: RC-PCR resulted in sequencing data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up

47

to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Comparison to Oxford Nanopore technologies

48

gives a near-perfect agreement on 95% of the samples (18 out of 19). Three out of six clusters with a

49

suspected epidemiological link were fully confirmed, in the others, four healthcare workers were not

50

associated. In the public health service samples, a previously unknown chain of transmission was

51

confirmed.

52

Significance statement:

53

SAR-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing using RC-PCR is a reliable technique and applicable for use

54

in outbreak analysis and surveillance. Its ease of use, high-trough screening capacity and wide

55

applicability makes it a valuable addition or replacement during this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Research in context

58

Evidence before this study

59

At present whole genome sequencing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 have a large turnover time and are

60

not widely available. Only a few laboratories are currently able to perform large scale SARS-CoV-2

61

sequencing. This restricts the use of sequencing to aid hospital and community infection prevention.

62

Added value of this study

63

Here we present clinical and technical data on a novel Whole Genome Sequencing technology,

64

implementing reverse-complement PCR. It is able to obtain high genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2

65

and confirm and exclude epidemiological links in 173 healthcare workers and patients. The RC-PCR

66

technology simplifies the workflow thereby reducing hands on time. It combines targeted PCR and

67

sequence library construction in a single PCR, which normally takes several steps. Additionally, this

68

technology can be used in concordance with the widely available range of Illumina sequencers.

69

Implications of all the available evidence

70

RC-PCR whole genome sequencing technology enables rapid and targeted surveillance and response

71

to an ongoing outbreak that has great impact on public health and society. Increased use of sequencing

72

technologies in local laboratories can help prevent increase of SARS-CoV-2 spreading by better

73

understanding modes of transmission.

Introduction

76
77

In December 2019 China reported a group of patients with a severe respiratory illness caused by a thus

78

far unknown coronavirus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was

79

identified as the causative agent.1 Since its outbreak, the virus evolved into a pandemic with almost 37

80

million infections and over a million deaths worldwide by October 2020.2 Many countries are

81

currently fighting second waves of infection whilst the healthcare systems are still under pressure from

82

the first wave. To reduce spread and mitigate workforce depletion, large scale testing of healthcare

83

workers (HCW) was implemented in the Netherlands early on.3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.29.360578; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

84

Current testing is based on RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharynx or oropharyngeal

85

swabs. If tested SARS-CoV-2 positive, HCW are instructed to self-isolate at home, and source finding

86

and contact tracing is performed. These procedures enable us to identify patients and personnel at risk

87

of infection and to identify chains of transmission in the hospital. In the community setting, source

88

finding and contact tracing is performed by public health staff upon a notification of a SARS-CoV-2

89

positive individual. It facilitates the implementation of quarantine measures for high-risk contacts in

90

the community. Contact tracing is time consuming and with rising numbers of infections as currently

91

seen in the second wave, the public health capacity may reach the limits of feasibility of thorough

92

source and contact tracing investigations.4 Routine sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome from

93

positive samples provides crucial insights into viral evolution and supports outbreak analysis.5,6

94

Current whole-genome sequencing (WGS) workflows often require cumbersome preparation, are

95

laborious to implement for high throughput screening or use less widely accessible sequencing

96

platforms, preventing widespread implementation. Here we present a novel strategy for fast, simple

97

and robust Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) WGS library preparation. We show that the RC-PCR

98

method, which integrates tiled target amplification with Illumina library preparation has a simple

99

workflow with minimal hands-on time. We used this novel and practical method to I) validate and

100

compare it with another sequence technology to demonstrate its reliability and capacity and II) apply it

101

to a set of epidemiologically linked cases to illustrate its added value in detecting potential

102

transmission events in public health and hospital settings.

103
104

Material and Methods

105

In this study we conducted a validation to assess the performance and reproducibility of the novel RC-

106

PCR SARS-CoV-2 sequencing technology. Subsequently, we performed a clinical validation to assess

107

the potential added value in identifying chains of transmission in a hospital and public health setting.

laboratory. Samples collected between March 2020 and September 2020 were included in this study

113

and stored at -80°C. Detailed descriptions on included samples can be found in supplementary table 1.

114

A total of 173 SARS-CoV-2 positive and fifteen SARS-CoV-2 negative samples were tested.

115

Samples and selection of epidemiological clusters

116

Nineteen out of 188 samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT).

117

These nineteen samples were collected at the beginning of the pandemic, between March 9th and

118

March 20th and ONT sequencing data of these samples has been deposited at GISAID, a global

119

initiative curating sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes for public access (https://www.gisaid.org/).6

120
121

Hospital samples

122

Six epidemiolocal hospital clusters that were identified by the infection prevention and control (IPC)

123

team were included in this study. These clusters involved patients admitted at and healthcare workers

124

(HCW) employed by the Radboud university medical center. Of the identified clusters, three were

125

clusters of healthcare workers with an epidemiological link, and three involved a patient and several

126

healthcare workers with a suspected epidemiological link. To determine whether other HCW could be

127

linked to one of the clusters, samples of sporadic HCW (all other HCW who tested positive for SARS-

128

CoV-2 in September 2020) were included in the selection, as the second wave of infections in the

129

Netherlands started late August 2020. These consist of Radboud university medical center HCW and

130

the majority work in direct or indirect patient care. A minority of positive samples include employees

131

working at the medical faculty or research departments. Additionally, twenty samples were included

132

from patients and HCW who were tested between March and September 2020 and who were not

133

associated with any of these predefined clusters.

134
135

Community samples

136

We also included an additional 64 community samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March

137

and April 2020 and that were tested by the local public health service. These were samples of persons

138

living in the defined public health region surrounding our hospital. See Table 1 for an overview of the

139

groups and clusters.

Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed on all samples during routine diagnostics. RNA was isolated

147

using Roche COBAS 4800 (Roche Diagnostics Corporation) with a CT/NG extraction kit according to

148

the manufacturers protocol. RT-PCR with primers targeting the envelope (E-gene) was used as

149

described by Corman et al. and performed on a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics Corporation)

150

using Roche Multiplex RNA Virus Mastermix.7

Reverse Complement Polymerase Chain Reaction

154

For all 188 selected samples, RNA isolation was repeated on the MagnaPure 96 (Roche Diagnostics

155

Corporation) using Small Volume isolate protocol with 200µl of sample and eluting isolated RNA in

156

50µl. cDNA-synthesis was performed using Multiscribe RT (Applied Biosystems) with 10µl of RNA

157

input (supplementary table 2). Four samples were replicates, RNA was isolated twice and tested in two

158

separate sequencing runs. They were randomly selected for the first run, but were also part of an IPC

159

identified cluster and therefore included in the second run.

160

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in 3 independent runs (96 samples each) using the

161

novel EasySeq™ RC-PCR SARS-CoV-2 WGS kit (NimaGen BV, Nijmegen, The Netherlands).

162

Figure 1 and 2 show a detailed description of the technology in which two types of oligo’s are used to

163

start the targeted amplification. The RC-probe and the universal barcoding primer hybridize and start

164

the formation of specific SARS-CoV-2 primers with Unique Dual Index (UDI) and adapter sequences

165

already included. In contrast to other techniques where multiple steps are needed to add sequence

166

adapters and UDI’s. This means a regular PCR-system can be used to produce SARS-CoV-2 specific

167

amplicons ready for sequencing. The kit uses 155 newly designed probes with a tiling strategy

168

previously implemented in the ARTIC protocol.8 The probes are divided in two pools, A and B. Pool

169

A contains 78 probes and Pool B contains 77 probes. This strategy requires two separate RC-PCR

170

reactions but ensures there is minimal chance of forming chimeric sequences or other PCR artifacts

171

(See Figure 2). After the PCR, samples of each plate are pooled into an Eppendorf tube, resulting in

172

two tubes, for pool A and B, respectively. These are individually cleaned using AmpliClean™

173

Magnetic Bead PCR Clean-up Kit (NimaGen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Afterwards, quantification

174

using the Qubit double strand DNA (dsDNA) High Sensitivity assay kit on a Qubit 4.0 instrument

175

(Life Technologies) is performed and pool A and B are combined. The amplicon fragment size in the

176

final library will be around 435 bp. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on an Illumina

177

MiniSeq® using a Mid Output Kit (2x150-cycles) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) by loading 0.8 pM

178

on the flowcell. The first two runs (Run1 and Run1_new) were conducted to test the performance of

179

the RC-PCR on a large variety of Ct-values (Ct 16 – 41) using the standard protocol provided by

180

NimaGen. For sequencing Run1_new the RC-PCR product from Run1 was re-used and sequenced

181

with the exception that the final sequencing library was created by using a balanced library pooling

182

strategy based on estimated cDNA input (2 ul for Ct<20, 5 ul 20≤Ct<27 or 10ul Ct≥27). The final

183

sequence run (Run2) contains samples with a Ct range from 16 – 32, using the same Ct dependent

184

balanced library strategy.

Data analysis

189

VirSEAK (JSI, Ettenheim, Germany) was used to map the Illumina paired-end reads to SARS-CoV-2

190

reference NC_045512.2. Consensus sequences were extracted for each sample using the virSEAK

191

export option, settings used can be found in supplementary table 3. All consensus sequences and

192

reference NC_045512.2 were aligned using MUSCLE (version 3.8.1551) using default settings.9

193

Sequence statistics were calculated using faCount (version 377). Mean read depth (RD) was calculated

194

using JSI/SEQUENCE PILOT (JSI, Ettenheim, Germany) to evaluate the amplicon depth of each of

195

the 155 amplicons. For the validation samples (ONT group Table 1) the sequence starts and ends were

196

trimmed to match RC-PCR region with Oxford Nanopore region. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic

197

tree was inferred using IQ-TREE (version 2.0.3) under the GTR+ F+I+G4 model with the

198

ultrafast bootstrap option set to 1,000. Phylogenetic tree visualization and annotation was performed

199

using iTOL (version 5.6.3) or FigTree (version 1.4.4) (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).10 SNP

200

distances between samples was calculated using snp-dists (version 0.7.0)

201

(https://github.com/tseemann/snp-dists). From the genome alignments we calculated a minimum

202

spanning tree (MST) by applying the MSTreeV2 algorithm using GrapeTree (version 1.5.0).11

203

Visualization of the MST was performed using GrapeTree.

204

The clinical validation consisted of a comparison of the epidemiological information of the

205

community and hospital samples and the WGS findings to see whether sequencing confirmed or

206

dismissed the suspected links between the samples.

Results

209

Technical results RC-PCR

210

In this study we performed three Illumina MiniSeq Mid Output (2x150 bp) runs containing 96 samples

211

each that were prepared using the EasySeqTM RC-PCR SARS-CoV-2 WGS kit. It has a turnaround

212

time of about 8.5 hours, consisting of 1-hour hands-on time for preparing 96 samples, 6.5 hours for

213

performing the RC-PCR, and 1-hour of hands-on time for pooling, sample clean-up. Run 2 had the

214

highest number of positive SARS-CoV-2 VirSEAK consensus retrievals (100%). Of Run1 65% was

215

retrieved, Run1_new 67%. Run2, containing samples with higher viral loads (Ct values 16-32),

216

reached an average coverage of 96.69%. Genome coverage for Run1_new was 88%. (Figure 3B)

217

Supplementary table 4 provides a detailed overview of the technical results of the three sequence runs.

218
219

Amplicon depth plots

220

The amplicon depth distribution highlights which parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are represented

221

and the number of reads for each of the amplicons. In essence this shows how well the individual parts

222

of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are represented in the results. To illustrate the amplicon distribution on

223

the SARS-CoV-2 genome, for each of the 155 amplicons a sequencing depth was calculated and

224

plotted per run (See Figure 3A). Most amplicons are centered around a Mean read depth (RD) of 100-

225

1000. While some amplicons show less depth, in most cases they still result in a consensus sequence.

226

Additionally, for Run2 the interquartile range of the Mean RD is smaller compared to the two other

227

runs. When comparing the amplicon depth obtained per probe, boxplots are made for each run divided

228

in three Ct groups (Ct<20, 20≤Ct<27, and Ct≥27) (see Figure3C). We see a decline in depth for

229

samples with Ct above 27. For Run1_new and Run2 samples with a Ct between 20 and 27 perform

230

slightly better than the Ct<20 group this is probably an effect of the balanced library input strategy

231

applied for these runs. To evaluate if the impact of amplicon sequencing depth affects SARS-CoV-2

232

genome completeness, boxplots with the Ct groups are displayed to the effect on genome coverage

233

(see Figure 3D). Here we notice a decline in genome coverage with increasing Ct values for Run1 and

234

Run1_new. Run2 maintains high genome coverages, however does not contain samples with Ct values

235

above 32.

Regions of low sequencing coverage

239

In a detailed analysis of the coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome obtained by RC-PCR 5 missing

240

genomic regions were observed (Table 2). The largest missing region has a length of 186 bp and is

241

part of the Open Reading Frame 1a (ORF1a). A further two regions are the start (1-54 bp) and the end

242

(46-165bp) of the genome. We observed that region 14585-14725 is missing in the VirSEAK

243

consensus output but not in the JSI/SEQUENCE PILOT and at the time of writing the manuscript the

244

VirSEAK algorithm was updated to improve the consensus output. Overall, without this update, the

245

maximum SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage that can be achieved using RC-PCR is between 97,8% and

246

98,2%. In version 1 of the EasySeq™ RC-PCR SARS-CoV-2 WGS kit three probe pairs do not

247

produce amplicons, 6258_6426, 9504_9752, and 21241_21420, respectively. No data on these

248

genomic regions will be obtained (Table 2).

Validation of RC-PCR reproducibility

254

All samples from Run1 that obtained a consensus (n=57) were compared to the same 57 samples from

255

Run1_new to determine whether results are reproducible when repeating sequencing with the RC-PCR

256

product. Results in supplemental figure 1 show that 50 of the 57 clusters fully align between Run1 and

257

Run1_new. There are 7 samples in which the phylogenetic distance is larger. For those samples in

258

which the phylogenetic distance is larger than expected, alignments were analyzed. The samples from

259

Run1_new show a lower genome coverage, explaining larger phylogenetic distances in these cases.

260

This is in line with the results observed in table 3 with average genome coverage of 88% in Run1_new

261

versus 93% in Run1. Which is either caused by RC-PCR product storage or the influence of the

262

balanced library pooling strategy based on Ct values of the samples.

263

Four sample pairs were tested in both Run1 and Run2 to serve as biological replicates. The entire

264

process from RNA isolation to sequence analysis was performed twice on these four samples.

265

Phylogenetic analysis depicted in Figure 4 (Illumina biological replicates) shows perfect agreement

266

between these repeats and confirms the specificity and reproducibility of RC-PCR.

Validation of RC-PCR with Oxford Nanopore Technologies® (ONT)

273

Nineteen out of the 188 samples were tested using both ONT and Illumina® sequencing. The ONT

274

sequences were available in the GISAID database and compared to the results of RC-PCR sequencing.

275

All nineteen samples provided sequencing results on both platforms (Figure 4, ONT in red and RC-

276

PCR in blue). Fourteen out of nineteen samples provided perfect pairs, four samples show a small

277

divergence in the phylogenetic tree. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distance was calculated to

278

identify the number of nucleotides discrepant between samples. This in combination with manual

279

inspection showed that they have identical sequences but RC-PCR samples miss certain genomic

280

regions compared to ONT which results in the phylogenetic differences. One pair does not match, the

281

ONT sample shows a large distance (EPI ISL 422891). Manual inspection of the alignment revealed a

282

wrongly placed ambiguous region in the ONT sample.

283
284

Clinical validation

285

Of the 188 tested samples, 173 were SARS-CoV-2 positive of which sequencing results were obtained

286

for 146 (57 in Run1 and 89 in Run2). All samples, excluding nineteen ONT and four duplicate

287

samples used for validation, are depicted in the phylogenetic tree of Figure 5. Only HCW and patients

288

are included in the minimum spanning tree of Figure 6. Figure 5 shows the genetic diversity of the

289

samples at different time points during the pandemic. Those collected during the first months of March

290

and April (community samples from public health service) are clearly separated from the other

291

samples, especially compared to the samples from September 2020 (Cluster 1,2,3,6, and the HCW).

292

In Figure 6 it is clear the epidemiological link between the samples three of the six clusters was

293

completely confirmed by the sequencing results. Clusters two, five, and six contained HCW that were

294

not related. In cluster one, linked to a venue outside the hospital, five samples group together with no

295

SNP distances, one sample has a distance of a single SNP suggesting the possibility of linked cases.

296

However, multiple “sporadic HCW” tested in September and two HCW previously linked to cluster

297

two and five also group within cluster one.

298

In cluster two only two samples group together, two others are genetically unrelated samples and one

299

samples has a SNP distance of 2 which could still be within the transmission chain. Cluster three, a

300

patient and HCW show a distance of only 1 SNP. Sample collection was performed on one occasion,

301

twelve days apart, which could account for the SNP difference. In cluster four two HCW and a patient

302

group together, confirming the suspected link. Cluster five, an outbreak at a laboratory, eight HCW

303

samples have identical SARS-CoV-2 genomes, only one sample is phylogenetically linked. Cluster six

304

originated from a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient seen at a department, where at that time multiple

305

HCW had close contact to the patient. At the time of presentation, no symptoms were present that

306

were indicative of SARS-CoV-2 and screening using a questionnaire was negative. Five of the HCW

307

tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the following weeks. In four HCW a genetically similar SARS-CoV-2

308

virus was detected. Surprisingly multiple other HCW group in this same cluster with minimal

309

differences (0-3 SNPs), which could mean the outbreak was larger than anticipated or the patient was

310

not the source of the infection.

311

Even though no new clusters were identified among the “sporadic HCW”, they do group with

312

previously identified clusters. Additional information about these HCW revealed that many of them

313

had a direct or indirect link to the community source that was known by the public health services,

314

Cluster one.

315

Sequencing of the 64 community samples showed seven people clustered together in the phylogenetic

316

tree of Figure 5. There was no prior information available on these tested persons, but additional

317

information provided by the Local Public Health Service indicated that two of the seven worked at the

318

same location, two were their partners, the others lived in the same neighbourhood at the initial four

319

people, although they had no known epidemiological link to these people other than the area of

320

residence. Of other public health service samples no contact tracing information was available and

321

other samples clustering could not be confirmed with an epidemiological link.

Discussion

326

In this study we present the application of a novel method called Reverse Complement-PCR to

327

sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome which combines target amplification and indexing in a single

328

procedure, directly creating a sequencing ready Illumina library. We applied this method to 173

329

hospital and community samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR. Most

330

epidemiological clusters from the hospital and the community were confirmed by phylogenetic

331

clustering. Based on our data, RC-PCR is a reproducible technology, it correlates well with Oxford

332

Nanopore sequencing, is able to sequence samples with Ct values up to 32 determined by RT-PCR and

333

within these samples retrieves a high SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage. Optimization of the protocols is

334

expected to increase coverage in samples with lower viral loads even further.

335

Previous studies showed the benefit of using WGS of SARS-CoV-2 for outbreak investigation

336

purposes and to study transmission routes.6,12-16 Several methods have been optimized for this purpose.

337

The ARTIC Illumina method, a tiling multiplex PCR approach, was the first that enabled WGS of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.29.360578; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

338

SARS-CoV-2 using Illumina sequencers.17 The technique has subsequently been optimized and

339

analysis, albeit in small sample numbers, concluded that it delivers sufficient quality to perform

340

phylogenetic analysis.18-20 It had been used as targeted and random RT-PCR screening with

341

subsequent sequencing of the population in order to study the spread through the community.12 More

342

recently Sikkema et al. were the first to describe the use of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in healthcare

343

associated infections and identify multiple introductions into Dutch hospitals through community-

344

acquired infections.5

345
346

SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated mutation rate of 1.12×10−3 substitutions per site per year, which

347

results in 2.8 mutations every month.21 The minimum spanning tree of Figure 6 shows several samples

348

with a genetic distance of only a single SNP. With the mutation rate in mind, it is unclear how to relate

349

these clusters since extensive contact tracing information is lacking and interpretation on SNP

350

regarding outbreak management is unknown. Since community samples of September were

351

unavailable, we are unable to determine whether the genetic diversity in the community was low

352

resulting in genetically similar SARS-CoV-2 strains in a hospital setting. However, since sequencing

353

of samples in March and April 2020 clearly resulted in a larger diversity of SARS-CoV-2, and this

354

was early on in the pandemic, it seems more likely that a common source of infection, in- or outside

355

the hospital is the cause. Further research is needed to determine the accepted SNP distance for the use

356

in outbreak analysis.22 Although we know minimum spanning trees are often used in outbreak

357

analysis.5 It is a simplification of the phylogeny which could result in erroneous conclusions in

358

outbreak analysis. Care should be taken in interpreting these results.

359
360

It should be noted that some of the amplicons result in lower coverage than others (See Figure 3).

361

Currently, developments are under way in which a better distribution of the amplicon depth will be

362

achieved resulting in genome coverage that could increase to almost 100%. The difference in genome

363

coverage between Run1 and Run1_new is most likely caused by storage of the library and subsequent

364

pooling on the basis of Ct value of the individual samples, nonetheless, repeated testing at higher Ct

365

values will be needed to confirm this.

366
367

With current increase in infections in many countries including the Netherlands and additional

368

measures being put in place to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spreading, real-time sequencing of public health

369

service samples could be used to target infection prevention measures nationwide and locally.23 Its

370

application can range from incidental cluster analysis in the case of uncertain epidemiological links to

371

real-time surveillance in the community or health care institutes. Additionally, correlation between

372

specific SARS-CoV-2 strains or mutations and clinical outcome could be identified, supporting

373

clinical decision making to improve outcomes for patients.24,25

374
375

In conclusion, here we implemented for the first time, RC-PCR in the field of medical microbiology

376

and infectious diseases thereby showing it to be a robust method which requires only minimal hands-

377

on time compared to current sequencing methods and can be used for high throughput sequencing of

378

SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, RC-PCR and sequence analysis can support epidemiological data with

379

genomic data to identify, monitor, and screen clusters of samples to help identify chains of

380

transmission of SARS-CoV-2, enabling a rapid, targeted and adaptive response to an ongoing outbreak

381

that has great impact on public health and society.
