ABSTRACT
A new betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new threat to global health and
economy. A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease
named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein. By constant-pH Monte Carlo
simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four
monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1
and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. We also calculated free
energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to
ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new
SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed
with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can
shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the
implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022
antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the
ongoing international health crisis.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2, virus recently found in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and officially
named by the World Health Organization (WHO),1 has already spread through China from all
continents (more than 168 countries), with 1,133,758 confirmed cases globally and 62,784 deaths
(data as reported by Central European Time 5 April 2020). Due to the pandemic, the disease is
not only affecting the health services, but also the economy in a global scale, interfering in the
widespread displacement of people, tourism, local and even international markets. Once China’s
economy is a worldwide reference, its disruption leads to a global impact in the supply chains
and the production itself.1–3
The Coronaviridae family, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, includes a large variability of
viruses and became recognized in the spring of 2003, when a human coronavirus caused severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).4–7 Based on phylogenetic analysis, the SARS-CoV-2 is
classified as a lineage B betacoronavirus8 and belongs to the same group as SARS-CoV-1 and
HKU9-1, the bat coronavirus, demonstrating wide similarity with both genetically9 (96,2% of
sequence identity with HKU9-1).10 The transmission was confirmed to be human-to-human once
several medical care personnel and relatives got infected,8,9 but it is believed that it all started
with an animal host, may it be a bat or another intermediate host.7,9,11,12 Even though the virus
usually does not cause severe damage to the body, as will be explained below, the major concern
is its high infectivity and pathogenicity.8,12,13
The COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus,14 generally causes mild upper
respiratory tract infections, resulting in fever and cough, yet it can also affect the lower
respiratory tract.12,15,16 SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, usually remains asymptomatic in an
early stage and then manifests itself with dyspnea, severe pneumonia and even death,17 with
fatality rates of about 10%.18 Although many groups of researchers are combining their efforts to
solve the mysteries of the new virus, some issues are still uncertain. Examples of these queries
are the virus’ incubation period, that may be longer than the 14 days scientists believed it to be
previously, and the fatality rates for each age range.19
Despite the fact that the virus’ molecular mechanism is partially unknown, the SARSCoV-2 has proteins, such as the Spike (S) glycoprotein, that densely decorates the viral external

surface and can potentially be a key target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic
antibodies (Abs).8,20–22 Due to the similarity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, the first strategy that has been used is to search for Abs that succeed
interacting with both, once SARS-CoV-1 has been more widely studied. However, preliminary
experimental studies have shown that many Abs that successfully interact with SARS-CoV-1 do
not bind with SARS-CoV-2.8
The spike protein, which is responsible for the “corona” (latin word for crown)
appearance in all coronaviruses, is a type I glycoprotein that has an especial role in the
interaction between the virus and the host cell. This protein attaches itself to specific cellular
receptors and suffers a conformational change that enables the fusion of the virus and the
cell.4,23,24 Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2’s S RBD protein interacts strongly with the
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).9,24,25 Therefore, aiming to develop better diagnosis
tools, vaccines and therapeutic Abs, it was measured the competition of mAbs and the ACE2 for
the binding to SARS-CoV-2 (named before 2019-nCoV8,26) RBD protein in order to enlighten
the binding epitopes of these Abs.8,19
The focus of this article is to initially reproduce the observations of previous laboratory
experiments by a theoretical approach. Secondly, we aim to contribute with the understanding of
the molecular mechanisms involved in the SARS viral infection, and finally to show how to
apply this knowledge to design new functional molecules. To achieve these goals, it was tested
by constant-pH simulation methods the complexation between the S RBD proteins of SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with the fragments of the monoclonal Abs (mAbs) 80R, CR3022,
m396 and F26G29, measuring their binding affinities and quantifying the titratable amino acids
that are involved in these interactions. Thus, using a theoretical method recently proposed to
identify “electrostatic epitopes”,27 it is possible to identify the similarities and differences
between these molecular complexes, and to map their origin and possible biological implications.
Another aspect discussed in this research is the interaction between the S RBD protein
from these viruses and the ACE2 in order to discover if the S RBD protein binds to either of
them with higher affinity, because, if so, an antibody (Ab) might have smaller chances of
binding. All this information together provided important insights to design more specific and

effective neutralizing Abs which is relevant for the future prevention and treatment of this now
widespread illness that should be immediately controlled. At the end, a new designed mAb
candidate is proposed based on our present in silico findings.

THEORETICAL METHODS
Computational virology is an emergent research field that takes advantage of the progress from
molecular and structural biology, immunology, bioinformatics and related areas to foster the
understanding of virus, their evolutionary dynamics in nature, infectivity, pathogenesis, cell/hosttropism, viral assembly and their molecular interactions in general (including how to predict
epitopes, how to design specific neutralizing antibodies and basically any drug design &
discovery related to viral infections).

27–34

In particular, structural and interactive aspects can

benefit from the solid foundations that computational molecular simulation methods such as
Molecular Dynamics (MD)35,36

and Monte Carlo (MC)35,37 have achieved to probe the

thermodynamic, dynamics and interactive properties of biomolecules in material science, food
and pharma (see refs.38,39 for reviews). Here, we applied a fast constant-pH MC scheme40,41 for
protein-protein studies42,43 to improve our understanding of the molecular interactions involving
SARS-CoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins and to identify key amino acids for the host-pathogen
interactions.

Molecular systems and their structural modeling
Several molecular systems were investigated in the present study employing the two SARSCoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins (see Figure 1) with ACE2 and the fragments of the mAbs 80R,
CR3022, m396, and F26G29. Typically, these fragments of mAbs are fusion proteins from

variable regions of the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins connected with a short linker
peptide. Additional calculations were carried out for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with a new
proposed mAb based on CR3022. For most of these macromolecules, three dimensional
crystallographic structures are available at the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB): 44 a) the SARSCoV-1 S RBD protein was extracted from the PDB id 2AJF (chain E, resolution 2.9Å, pH 7.5)
where it was found complexed with ACE2 (chain A) − see Figure 2; b) the fragment of the Ab
80R was taken out from the PDB id 2GHW (chain B, resolution 2.3Å, pH 4.6); c) the antiSARS-CoV-1 m396 Ab was extracted from the PDB id 2G75 (chains A and B, resolution 2.28Å,
pH 8.5) removing part of the chains to keep only the variable regions and the short linker
peptide; d) F26G19 Fab was taken out from PDB id 3BGF (chains L and C, resolution 3.0Å, pH
5.5), following the same procedure used for m396. Missing regions in these proteins were built
up using the “UCSF Chimera 1.11.2” interface45 of the program “Modeller” with default
parameters.46 Figure 3 shows their final three-dimensional structures as used in this work. All
PDB files were edited before the calculations. Water molecules and hetero atoms were
completely removed from all used files. The “UCSF Chimera 1.11.2” package45 was employed
for all molecular visualizations and representations too.

When this study started, no experimental structure was available for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S
protein. A model was built up at the SWISS-MODEL workspace (YP_009724390.1) based on
the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512.47 The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic
positions between this modeled structure for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the
available one for SARS-CoV-1 (PDB id 2AJF) is 0.638Å. The structural comparison between
the RBD proteins of both SARS viruses can be seen in Figure 1. Recently, new experimental

structures were solved. For example, a cryo-EM structure is now available for the prefusion S
glycoprotein with a single incomplete RBD (PDB id 6VSB, resolution 3.46Å). The RMSD
between our model and the S RBD (chain A) from this structure is 0.790Å. This number is closer
to the RMSD differences between two chains of the same experimental (PDB id 6VSB) trimer
structure (e.g. 0.668Å for chain A x chain B, and 0.732Å for chain A x chain C). Such diversity
of possible conformations might motivate further studies exploring their effects on the theoretical
predictions. These RMSD values also indicate that the modeled structure for the SARS-CoV-2
virus as used here is reasonable and within the expected conformational fluctuations from any
other structure that could have been chosen for this work. Moreover, an intrinsic assumption here
is that an experimental structure obtained at a given and specific physical chemical condition
(ionic strength, pH, PEG6000 concentration, etc.) is valid in another condition.27

between these structures is equal to 0.638Å.

CR3022 is a particularly successful SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing human mAb first isolated from a
convalescent patient by ter Meulen and co-authors.48 For the present study, its three dimensional
structure (see Figure 3) was built up at the SWISS-MODEL workspace47 from the linear
sequences of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains that were deposited in GenBank
under accession numbers DQ168569 and DQ168570, respectively.48

Molecular simulations
A large diversity of models is available for MD and MC molecular simulations.38,49–52 The need
to repeat the calculations on several different physical chemical conditions and to obtain free
energy of interactions at them drives the options to the so-called cost-effective coarse-grained
(CG) models. These CG models offer the possibility to explore the main physical features of a
system with a reduced number of parameters and lower computational costs.27,42,43 During the
last years, a fast constant-pH (CpH) CG model has been devised to successfully study proteinprotein

fixed) formed by a set of amino acids placed at positions given by their three-dimensional
structures as described above. This additional approximation is justified by the prohibitive

computational costs of constant-pH methods with pH-dependent conformational changes.52,56,57
Moreover, it is known that SARS-CoV-1 S protein does not exhibit large conformational
changes upon the binding to ACE2 at least.58

Each group of atoms that define an amino acid is converted in a single charged Lennard-Jones
(LJ) sphere of radius (Ri) and valence zi. This CG process turns a protein atomistic structure as a
collection of charged LJ particles representing their amino acids. The centers-of-masses of the
beads (mimicking amino acids) are used to place them accordingly to the coordinates given by
the three-dimensional structures. The values of Ri for each type of amino acids were taken from
ref.53. The valences of all ionizable residues are a function of the solution pH. The fast proton
titration scheme (FPTS)40,41,52 was employed both to initially assign these valences zi´s for the
amino acids and to let them vary during the simulation sampling at a given pH. This method has
proved to predict pKa´s with a very good accuracy at low computational costs.41 The fundamental
physical chemical basis of this titration scheme, its numerical implementation, benchmarks,
discussions related to its approximations, pros and cons can be found in previous
publications.40,41,52,59

As illustrated in Figure 4, two proteins are placed in an electroneutral open cylindrical simulation

fragment of the mAb 80R. Unless otherwise specified, simulation runs were carried out with a
cell of radius (rcyl) and height (lcyl) equals to 150 and 200Å, respectively. The static dielectric

constant was set to 78.7 (assuming a temperature of 298K). Counter-ions and added salt particles
were represented implicitly using a screening term, i.e., for two ionizable amino acids i and j, the
screening is given by [exp(-κrij)] where κ is the modified inverse Debye length, and rij is the
interparticle separation distance.27,42,43,60 Additionally, a simplified simulation box with only one
protein present was used to characterize the titration properties of a single macromolecule.

where 𝜖0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum (𝜖0 = 8.854 × 10−12C2/Nm2), 𝜖𝑠 is the dielectric

the elementary charge. See refs.27,42,43,60 for more details. Ionizable amino acids have their
charged defined by the FPTS.40,41 All the others are fixed neutral.

Protein-protein interactions are also controlled by other physical contributions (van der Waals
interactions, hydrophobic effect, and excluded volume repulsion).27,42,43 A simple and effective
way to include their effects is by means of a LJ term [uvdw(rij)] between the beads (amino
acids).27 Mathematically, for any two beads (charged or neutral ones) i and j, uvdw(rij) is given by

specific contributions from the hydrophobic effect in the model.43 This should preserve the
macromolecular hydrophobic moments61 and contributes to guide a correct docking orientation
at short separation distances.27

The term εLJ regulates the strength of the attractive forces in the system.27,42,43 Typically, εLJ is
assumed to be universal for any biomolecular system and equals to 0.124 kJ/mol.42,43,53,62 This
should correspond to a Hamaker constant of ca. 9kBT (kB = 1.380×10-23m2kgs-2K-1 is the
Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin) for amino acid pairs.43,53,63 However,
this value might result in both an over or an underestimation of the attraction depending on the
biomolecular system.42,43,62 For instance, εLJ equals to 1.7kBT (a value 34 times greater than 0.124
kJ/mol) was necessary to reproduce experimental data for the histatin-5 adsorption to a
hydrophilic silica surface.62 Conversely, the 𝛃-lactoglobulin–lactoferrin complexation seems to
be overestimated by the usual value of εLJ.43 Consequently, our research strategy has been to
adopt the consensus value of 0.05kBT (= 0.124 kJ/mol) for εLJ. This also implies that the
outcomes should be interpreted with relative caution bearing in mind all the intrinsic approaches
assumed in the modeling. The direct impact is seen in the free energy derivatives as discussed
later at the results section.

Combining Eqs. (1) and (2), the total system's interaction energy for a given configuration
[𝑈({𝑟𝑘 })] can be written as:

𝑣𝑑𝑤
𝑈({𝑟𝑘 }) = 2 ∑𝑁
(𝑟𝑖𝑗 )), [3]
𝑖=1 ∑𝑗=1(𝑢 (𝑟𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝑢

where {𝑟𝑘 } are amino acid positions and 𝑁 is their total number. This includes both charged and
neutral beads.

This model was solved by Metropolis MC simulations that were performed at physiological ionic
strength (150mM) and different pH conditions. The choice to simulate at pH 4.6 and 7.0 was
motivated by the needs to understand the low and neutral pH conditions (e.g. low pH of

endosomes). Furthermore, it seems controversial in the experimental works if the acidification is
essential or not for uptake of cell-free SARS virus.22,23,25 The exact value of the acid pH
condition is unknown. We made a choice to use the pH value of the crystallographic
environment more acid among the studied structures (pH 4.6 for PDB id 2GHW). This also made
possible to easily investigate the behavior of the systems at intermediate conditions by
interpolation from the present outcomes.

After the proper equilibration of the simulated molecular systems, long production runs were
carried out. Simulations whose focus was on titration properties [Z(pH) and pKas] required 108
MC steps. Conversely, runs to measure the free energy of interactions [𝛽w(r)] were calculated
from radial distribution functions [𝛽w(r)=-ln g(r), where 𝛽=1/kBT] that demanded even longer
runs with at least 3.0 109 MC steps. These are massive simulations and very costly in terms of
cpu time even at the CG representation. Four main factors contribute with this high cpu costs: a)
the free energy barriers of the systems; b) the electrostatic coupling between a large number of
titratable groups; c) the need to populate all the histogram bins used for the g(r) during the
sampling; d) the reduction of the statistical noises in the calculated 𝛽w(r).27,42,43 Standard
deviations were controlled by means of the use of 5 replicates per simulated system as done
before for the study of flaviviruses.27

Electrostatic Epitopes determined by the PROCEEEDpKa method
Antibody-antigen recognition is a challenger and intensive research field.27,64–66 It is a molecular
process that involves different physical intermolecular interactions. Electrostatic interactions
deserve a special attention in this process for several reasons [e.g. is long range nature, the fact

that the interface antibody-antigen has a peculiar electrostatic pattern (richer in titratable groups)
that is different than other general protein-protein interfaces,65 etc.].27,55 Such facts contribute to
shift the canonical view of the “lock and key” (with a clear focus on the protein surface) to a
broader definition that led to the “electrostatic epitopes” (EE) concept.27 This means that inner
titratable groups (not only the ones at the epitope-paratope interface) can also participate in the
interplay of interactions with Abs.

The EEs are the core idea of the PROCEEDpKa method27 where pKa shifts are used to identify
the key amino acids responsible for a host-pathogen association. It applies the fact that the
location of these shifts is a practical mean to probe molecular interactions as before
demonstrated.67 Moreover, this can be easily measured during computer simulations of a proteinprotein complexation. The predictive properties of this powerful tool have been previously i)
statistically analyzed for flaviviruses, ii) compared to other bioinformatic tools (that often ignore
that pH and ionic strength can drastically affect the complexation process) and iii) discussed in
details in a preceding work.27 The capacity of this method to test EE for specific mAbs makes it
even more appealing for the present study where four known mAbs should be investigated. For
the sake of convenience, predicted EE for the studied systems were graphically compared at the
sequence level. The pairwise sequence alignments were generated by the server EMBOSS
Needle68 with default settings.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Free energy of interactions of SARS spike RBD proteins
One of the central questions in the understanding of the COVID-19, its pathology including the
high transmissibility, and the possible therapeutic interventions to control the epidemics
spreading is to decipher and prevent the molecular interactions between the S protein and
ACE2.25,69–73 This SARS S protein-ACE2 complexation is the first step toward infecting the cell
by the virus. Several studies have shown that both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses share
the function interaction with this cell receptor (i.e. ACE2).7,25,73,74 We investigated the
association pathway for the binding of the S RBD proteins to ACE2 for both SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 viruses by means of constant-pH MC simulations at two different solution pH
values (4.6 and 7.0). The calculated free energy of interactions as given by the potentials of mean
force [βw(r)] for these studied pH conditions at physiological ionic strength are given at Figure
5. Despite similar binding affinities observed in the present theoretical calculations (as seen in
Figure 5) and in the laboratory experiments,8 the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD protein has a small
tendency to bind to the ACE2 at both pH regimes. This agrees quite well with the experimental
results measured by the biolayer interferometry binding (BLI) assay as reported by Walls and coauthors using the functional subunit of the S protein responsible for binding to the host cell
receptor.24 The measured binding affinity (KD) was 5.0±0.1nM for the system SARS-CoV-1 S
RDB(also referred to as the domain B58)–ACE2 and 1.2±0.1nM for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD–
ACE2. Yet, other experimental measurements using the S1 domain (this is the subunit that
contains both the RBD and the N-terminal domain58) might suggest an inverted behavior where
SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain would have a tendency for a stronger bind to ACE2
(KD=15.0±0.1nM)75 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1 S (KD=15.2nM)8. This small experimental

difference of 0.2nM could be due to several reasons including the experimental uncertainties that
were not reported in Tian’s work.8 In contrast to these results, another recent study20 advocated
that SARS-CoV-2 has greater binding affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV-1. Even so, both the
present theoretical and previously reported experimental data do agree that SARS-CoV-1 S RBD
and SARS-CoV-2 S RBD have similar attraction to the ACE2. This high binding affinity implies
that all human organs rich on ACE2 (oral and nasal mucosa, lung, stomach, small intestine,
colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain)76,77 can be
easily infected. A clear opportunity for the virus is the lung alveolar epithelial cells and
enterocytes of the small intestine, where ACE2 is abundant.76

Note that the simulations were performed with a single RBD protein in the absence of the full
structure of the S protein and the others two chains of the homotrimeric S glycoprotein. This
brings with it the evidence that the other structural parts of the S1 subunit, the S2 subunit and the
two other chains are not essential for the individual pair of RBD–ACE2 complexation. Also, this
observation supports the argument that the dissociation of the S1 subunit complexed with ACE2
can happen without the interruption of the infection. This also allows the S2 subunit to transit
from a metastable prefusion to its post-fusion state as a second step in the viral infection.58,78

At pH 4.6 which is closer to the low pH that occur outside the cell,23,79 the association between
the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD protein and ACE2 showed a free energy depth [βwmin] of −1.02 at the
separation distance of 50.0Å (see Figure 1a). Conversely, for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, βwmin is
−0.95 at the separation distance of 49.5Å. The estimated standard deviations are 0.01kBT for all
studied cases. Such computed measurements of βw(r) obtained by CG models that smooth the

free-energy landscape must be interpreted with care as we already have pointed out above. By
one side, it can be used a simple thermodynamic criterion that a negative free energy value
(βwmin<0) would result in a molecular complex. Conversely, any free energy value smaller than
the thermal energy (1 kBT) would indicate an unstable association. The observed difference
(𝛥βwmin) of 0.07 between the two RDB proteins is greater than the estimated statistical errors.
However, we prefer to interpret such small differences as tendencies of the system. Based on
previous studies27,42,43,54,60 where we have observed either that the computed complexation was
weaker than the experimental measurements or too much stronger, we feel safer to use this data
(and the others discussed below) in relative terms (i.e. comparing different situations). This
allows us to successfully predict experimental observations respecting the limits of such CG
models.27,42,43,54 The similarities between their free energy minima are relatively amplified at pH
4.6 (𝛥βwmin=0.07 as seen above) in comparison with pH 7.0 where βwmin is −1.11 and −1.06
(𝛥βwmin=0.05). Both viral S RBD proteins have their affinities to ACE2 slightly raised when pH
is increased from the acid to the neutral regime. This somewhat higher binding affinity at neutral
pH suggests that the role of pH for RBD proteins constantly under debate at the literature22,25,73,80
might not be so critical for the infection. It also reinforces the possibility that the viral cell
invasion is not a pH-dependent process. Indeed, it seems that pH is more relevant for the next
steps to continue the viral infection and not at the first entry level. This possible non pH-depend
process might increase the opportunities for the SARS viruses to easily infect cells and therefore
to contribute to its high infectivity. This might limit the use of chloroquine as an efficient drug
against COVID-19 since its first action is to increase the cell pH. At least a neutral pH solution
will not prevent the binding of the RBD to ACE2. On the opposite as it can favor this affinity.

Figure 5. Free energy profiles for the interaction of RBD proteins with ACE2. The
simulated free energy of interactions [𝛽w(r)] between the centers of mass of the RBD proteins
from both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 at different solution pH conditions.
Salt concentration was fixed at 150mM. The structures of these macromolecules were extracted
from the PDB id 2AJF for SARS-CoV-1 S RBD and ACE. SARS-CoV-2 S RBD was built-up by
modeling as described in the text. Simulations started with the two molecules placed at random
orientation and separation distance. Results for the systems SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are
show as continuous and dashed lines, respectively.

Another important aspect is the evaluation of putative mAbs that could bind to the RBD of the
new SARS-CoV-2. Following the work of Tian and collaborators,8 we investigated the
interactions between the two SARS S RBD proteins with some of the most potent SARS-CoV-1
S RBD specific neutralizing antibodies (80R, F26G19, m396, CR3022). Figure 6 shows the free
energy profiles at the acid regime and physiological salt conditions. For all studied fragments of
Abs, a relatively stronger attraction is always observed for the S RBD protein from the SARSCoV-1 interacting with any of these mAbs. This can be better seen in Figure 6b where the region
around the well depth is highlighted. The lowest observed binding affinities are observed for the
system SARS-CoV-2-F26G19 (blue dashed line, βwmin=−0.63) followed by SARS-CoV-2-80R

(black dashed line, βwmin=−0.66) and SARS-CoV-2-m396 (green dashed line, βwmin=−0.67). The
difference between SARS-CoV-1-80R and SARS-CoV-2-m396 (𝛥βwmin=0.01) is within the
estimated statistical errors. The most promising complexation was found for the SARS-CoV-2
RBD-CR3022 (red dashed line, βwmin=−0.79) which is in good agreement with the experimental
measurements.8 In fact, this was the only mAb that could bind potently with SARS-CoV-2 RBD
(KD of 6.3 nM determined by BLI assay) in the experiments performed by Tian and co-authors
using the Ab isolated from the blood of a convalescent SARS patient.8 The Ab m396 only
showed an insignificant binding at the highest measured concentration of 2μM in the
experimental studies.8

Using the free energy minima values observed in the simulations, we can order the binding
affinities for the RBD proteins from the lower to the higher as SARS-CoV-2-F26G19
(βwmin=−0.63) < SARS-CoV-2-80R (βwmin=−0.66) < SARS-CoV-2-m396 (βwmin=−0.67) =
SARS-CoV-1-F26G19 (βwmin=−0.67) < SARS-CoV-1-m396 (βwmin=−0.71) < SARS-CoV-180R

(βwmin=−0.73)

<

SARS-CoV-2-CR3022

(βwmin=−0.79)

<

SARS-CoV-1-80R

(βwmin=−0.85). As mentioned above, the values of βwmin should be used in relative terms.
Moreover, the work of Tian and co-authors suggested that only for CR3022 it was
experimentally measured a reasonable binding.8 The combination of these information could
indicate that a threshold of −0.67KBT for βwmin can be used to better refine the theoretical binding
predictions of these macromolecular complexations (i.e. all viral protein-protein systems with a
value of βwmin smaller than −0.67KBT are expected to experience binding in vivo at least). Table
S1 summarizes the values of βwmin given between parenthesis.

It should be noted that the attraction between the S RBD proteins and ACE2 (βwmin equals to
−1.02 and −0.95 for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively) is always stronger than what
was calculated to any studied mAb including to the CR3022 (βwmin equals to −0.85 and −0.79 for
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively) for both SARS viruses (see table S1). The same
tendency was experimentally verified.8 It was measured by BLI assay a KD of 6.3 nM for the
binding of CR3022 to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD which corresponds to a fraction of 0.41 of the KD
measured for the binding of ACE2 to the same RBD (KD equals to 15.2nM).8

Physical chemistry properties
Next, we explored basic physical chemical aspects that could offer a simple and quick reasoning
to understand the above free energy results and eventually be used as descriptors to scan
databases of mAbs to filter promising ideal candidates. Although different driven forces can
result in protein-protein complexation,

42,43

pH and charge-charge interactions seems especially

important for viral proteins.27,55,81–85 Indeed, the protein net charges numbers (Z) obtained as
function of the solution pH show that the SARS-CoV-2 S RDB protein is always slightly more
positively charged than SARS-CoV-1 S RDB protein at the same physical chemical environment
(Z equals to 5.2 and 5.5, respectively, for them at pH 4.6) − see table 1. Since all studied
fragments of Abs are also positively charged at pH 4.6 (Z equals to 9.1, 4.2, 2.7, 5.8 for 80R,
CR3022, m396 and F26G19, respectively), it can be easily seen that the order observed for the
binding affinities above in the free energy analyses do follow a simple charge-charge rule for the
mAbs with similar surface area (A~10,000 Å2). For the SARS-CoV-1 S RDB protein, from the
weaker to the stronger repulsive cases in terms of the Coulomb contributions (Zi*Zj assuming the
same Bjerrum length, salt screening and separation distances42,43,86), the predicted order for the
binding affinity is 80R (5.2*9.1=47.3) < F26G19 (5.2*5.8=30.2) < CR3022 (5.2*4.2=21.8). This
agrees with the previous free energy analyses (see above). As large is A, larger is the attractive
van der Waals interactions that can overcome the charge-charge repulsion. This can also explain
why m396 (that is smaller and has roughly half of A) is less attracted to the RBD proteins even
being slightly less positively charged (Z equals to 2.7 at pH 4.6) than the others (Z~5-6).
Similarly, this is the physical reason to understand the stronger binding affinity that ACE2
(A=25,290Å2) has to the S RBD proteins. Although ACE2 (Z=5.4) and F26G19 (Z=5.8) have
similar Zs, the molecular surface of ACE2 is ca. 2.5 times larger than F26G29 (A=10,120Å2).

We tested the van der Waals (vdw) contribution comparing 𝛽w(r) for CR3022 and m396 in a
model where all electrostatic interactions where completely switched off and only vdw
interactions are considered. This test-case system is shown in Figure S1. It can be seen that m396
in this hypothetical test does have a weaker binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein in
comparison to CR3022 confirming the arguments above presented.

Insights to design a more efficient monoclonal antibody
Combining the findings above reported with a theoretical alanine scanning scheme employed to
determine the contribution of specific titratable group to the complexation process, we identified
three possible mutations that can improve the binding affinity of CR3022 to SARS-CoV-2 S
RBD. The suggested mutations are K12E, K170A and R194A. These amino acids (K12, K170
and R194) can be seen in Figure 7 at the wild type structure of CR3022. The main physical
chemical reasoning to design this new functional molecule was to reduce the net charge of

23

CR3022 in general together with a decrease of the repulsion for groups that are closely located at
the host-pathogen interface. Two amino acids substitutions (K170A and R194A) are suggested at
this biological interface while the other one (K12E) is more peripheral (see Figure 7). Doing
such mutations, the Z of the new molecule (labeled CR3022’) drops down from +4.2 to +1.2 at
pH 4.6 and from +1.0 to −3.0 at pH 7.0.

The binding affinity of this computer-designed molecule was tested. The calculated 𝛽w(r) for
this new fragment of mAb is given in Figure 8. As it can be seen, CR3022’ is now able to bind
with an equivalent binding affinity to what was observed for the SARS-CoV-1S RBD-CR3022
system. βwmin decreased from −0.79 to −0.85 recovering the value found for the SARS-CoV-1 S
RBD-CR3022 case − see Figure 6 and Table S1. Therefore, this is a promising designed mAb
candidate to be carefully and systematically examined in further experimental assays.

Estimates of the antigenic regions by pKa shifts – The PROCEEDpKa method
To refine this analysis at the sequence level, the PROCEEDpKa method27 was employed to
determine the EE of the RBD proteins for the most relevant studied complexes. Three questions
should be addressed here: 1) if SARS-CoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins share a common binding
region when they bind to ACE2; 2) if these viral RBD proteins interact with the mAbs using a
similar epitope-paratope interface; 3) if the interaction with CR3022 and CR3022’ involves the
same EE. The data to answer such questions is given in Figures 9 and 10.

26

In Figure 9, the primary sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 S RBD proteins are plotted together
with the estimated ionizable amino acids of the interface with ACE2 and the antigenic regions as
defined by the PROCEEDpKa method. By the different distribution of amino acids identified as
EE (shown in blue), it can be seen that the electrostatic method is sensitive to the structures and
their titratable groups that can produce electrical perturbations on their partners when they are
interacting as demonstrated before.27 The patterns observed for both viral SARS proteins are
similar (i.e. they share a common region when they bind to ACE2) although some interesting
observations can be made. Comparing the number of ionizable residues involved in the
interactions for the RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and ACE2 with the pair SARS-CoV-2 S
RBD-ACE2, we can see an increase from 30 to 40 with a high number of common cases (22
amino acids) where the same amino acid interacts with ACE2 for both viral proteins. Most of the
differences are observed for neighbor groups (e.g. “AWERKKISN” for SARS-CoV-1 and
“AWNRKRISN” for SARS-CoV-2) indicating that the same biological interface was explored by the
two viral RBD proteins in spite of their structural differences. The RBD protein responsible for
COVID-19 clearly has more titratable residues interacting with ACE2 than its precursor. This
observation suggests that its binding to ACE2 might be less specific than what happens for
SARS-CoV-1. As such, the presence of an Ab may not completely block the SARS-CoV-2 S
RBD-ACE2 interaction. In general, as seen in this Figure, most of the titratable groups from the
viral RBD proteins involved in the binding to ACE2 are also the antigenic regions of the studied
fragments of mAbs.

Virtually the same number of ionizable groups are seen at the antigenic regions for RBD proteins
from SARS-CoV-1 (25 aa) and SARS-CoV-2 (24 aa) when interacting with 80R. The number of

common cases is 12 while some regions are more affected by their structural differences (e.g.
“DYSVLYNSTFFSTFKCYG” for SARS-CoV-1 and “DYSVLYNSASFSTFKCYG” for SARS-CoV-2). A
replacement of an amino acid from the same physical chemical group (e.g. D by E) can be
enough to result in different interactions (e.g. “KGDDVRQIA” for SARS-CoV-1 and “RGDEVRQIA”
for SARS-CoV-2). CR3022 perturbed more titratable groups: 27 for SARS-CoV-1 and 33 for
SARS-CoV-2. Taking into account what was hypothesized for ACE2 above, this might be an
addition contribution to improve the capability of this mAb to interact and inhibit the RBD
proteins. In fact, the experimental work of Tian and colleagues8 do show that the CR3022
binding to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is not affected by ACE2. This might be the molecular basis for
this behavior. We are careful with the use of stronger statements here due to the limitation of the
theoretical approach. Several additional issues remain to be further investigated.

Finally, we compared the EE predictions for CR3022’ (34 aa) with CR3022 (33 aa) interacting
with SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein − see Figure 10. The predicted EEs for the interaction with
CR3022’ are essentially the same ones observed for CR3022 (27 common aa). This implies that
the suggested mutations here do not affected the antigenic regions. Another particularly
interesting feature of this computer-designed molecule is that the number of EEs shared with
ACE2 has increased from 18 (for CR3022) to 27 (for CR3022’). This might amplify the potential
of this mAb candidate to better block the virus-host cell interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
Free energies of interactions were calculated for several molecular complexes involving the RBD
of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins. The present theoretical results confirmed that both RBD
proteins have similar binding affinity to the ACE2 as previously reported in experimental
studies. This is observed at both acid and neutral pH regimes which probably indicates that the
medium pH it is not so relevant for the beginning of the viral cell invasion. pH seems to be more
important for the next steps of the viral infection and not at the first entry level. This has a direct
implication for the drug development since the proposal of some like chloroquine is to raise cell
pH.

Analyzing the interactions between these RBD proteins and the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD specific
neutralizing mAbs (80R, F26G19, m396, CR3022) allowed us to reproduce the experimental
results. The only mAb with measured affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein by BLI
assay was CR30208 which was also the one with higher affinity quantified in the present
theoretical study. Moreover, we could map their electrostatic epitopes and identify that all mAbs
tend to share the same titratable residues, and they are like the residues involved in the
interaction with ACE2. However, the RBD protein responsible for COVID-19 clearly has more
titratable residues interacting with ACE2 than its precursor suggesting that its binding to ACE2
might be less specific. This can explain the general difficulty that mAbs can experience to
completely block the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2 interaction.

Charge-charge interactions were found to be a good simple descriptor for a fast screening to the
designing of improved mAb for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Our theoretical approach,
while still being further developed, has identified three amino acids substitution that can increase
the binding affinity of CR3022 to the RBD protein responsible for the present pandemic. These
results can contribute to guide the design of new functional and high specific mAbs providing a
cost-and-time-effective computational framework towards the development of better diagnostic
strategies and an effective treatment and/or vaccine for COVID-19.
