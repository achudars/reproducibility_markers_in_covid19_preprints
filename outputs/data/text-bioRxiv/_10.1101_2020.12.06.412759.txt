Identification and development of effective drugs active against SARS-CoV-2 are

28

urgently needed. Here, we report on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of MEDS433, a novel

29

inhibitor of human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH), a key cellular enzyme of the

30

de novo pyrimidines biosynthesis. MEDS433 inhibits in vitro virus replication in the low

31

nanomolar range, and through a mechanism that stems from its ability to block hDHODH

32

activity. MEDS433 thus represents an attractive candidate to develop novel anti-SARS-

33

CoV-2 agents.

Main text
The emergence of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2

37

(SARS-CoV-2), and the rapid worldwide spreading of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)

38

have produced a threat to global public health that calls for urgent deployment of effective

39

antiviral drugs (1-4). Among the therapeutic options that have been potentially considered,

40

small-molecules targeting host factors exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to replicate may

41

represent an alternative to direct acting agents prone to select drug resistant strains (5).

42

One of the cellular pathways that is attracting more attention for the advancement of host-

43

targeting antivirals (HTA), is the de novo pyrimidines biosynthesis, essential for virus

44

replication in infected cells (6). In this pathway, the human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase

45

(hDHODH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of dehydrogenation of dihydroorotate to orotate,

46

thus providing uridine and cytidine to fulfill nucleotides request (7-9). Given its critical role,

47

hDHODH is considered an emerging target of choice for the development of HTA against

48

SARS-CoV-2 (10). In this regard, two potent hDHODH inhibitors just entered in Phase II

49

clinical trials for COVID-19: brequinar (11) (NCT04425252), and PTC299 (12)

50

(NCT04439071). However, these drug candidates suffer of toxicity issues that slowed

51

down their earlier clinical pathway on other therapeutic applications (13, 14). Thus, new

52

safest hDHODH inhibitors are urgently needed.

53

To investigate the feasibility of targeting hDHODH to develop HTA against SARS-CoV-

54

2, in this study we have characterized the in vitro antiviral activity of a new generation

55

hDHODH inhibitor produced by the rational modulation to brequinar (11), and

56

characterized by the presence of a 2-hydroxypyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine moiety. This

57

compound, MEDS433 (Fig. 1A), is comparable to brequinar in inhibiting hDHODH activity,

58

while owing a better drug-like profile (15, 16).

59

The effect of MEDS433 on SARS-CoV-2 replication was evaluated in Vero E6 cells

60

infected with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1) at a multiplicity of

61

infection (MOI) of 0.1, and then treated with 0.5 μM MEDS433. At 24 hours post-infection

62

(h p.i.), cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid

63

N protein mAb, and with DRAQ5 which stains cell nuclei, to count cell numbers. As shown

64

in Fig. 1B, confocal microscopy revealed that while about 85% of infected control cells

65

expressed the N protein, MEDS433 treatment completely abolished its accumulation, thus

66

indicating that N protein expression could be prevented by targeting the de novo

67

pyrimidine biosynthesis.

68

Next, a virus yield reduction assays (VRA) was performed in SARS-CoV-2-infected

69

Vero E6 cells treated with increasing concentrations of MEDS433. At 48 h p.i., cell

70

supernatants were harvested and titrated by plaque assay. A concentration-dependent

71

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication was thus observed (Fig.1C), with EC50 and EC90

72

values of 0.063 and 0.136 μM, respectively. Interestingly, MEDS433 was more effective

73

than brequinar (EC50 0.20, EC90 1μM) (Fig. 1C). In addition, the Cytotoxic Concentration

74

(CC50) of MEDS433 as measured in uninfected Vero E6 cells by the MTT method (17),

75

was more than 500 μM with a favorable Selective Index (SI) greater than 7,900, thus

76

indicating that its antiviral activity was not due to a reduced cell viability.

77

To get more insights into MEDS433 mechanism of action, time-of-addition

78

experiments were carried out. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were exposed to MEDS433 (0.5 μM)

79

from -2 to - 1h prior to SARS-CoV-2 adsorption (MOI of 0.1) (pre-treatment); during

80

infection (adsorption stage, from -1 to 0 h) (co-treatment); or after viral adsorption (from 0

81

to 48 h p.i.) (post-treatment). Infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles were then quantified in cell

82

supernatants harvested at 48 h p.i. by plaque assay. As depicted in Fig. 2A, MEDS433 did

83

not affect the initial attachment and entry phases of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, while it

84

produced a significant reduction of infectious virus production when added at a post-entry

85

stage, in agreement with its ability to block N protein accumulation (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot

86

analysis of total protein extracts prepared from the corresponding SARS-CoV-2-infected-

87

and MEDS433-treated cells and fractionated through a 10% SDS-PAGE, confirmed a

88

reduction of N protein content only in the post-treatment sample (Fig. 2B), thus indicating

89

that MEDS433 interferes with a post-entry biosynthetic step in SARS-CoV-2 replication.

90

These results suggested a mechanism of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of

91

MEDS433 consistent with the hypothesis of an interference with the de novo pyrimidine

92

biosynthesis. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated by plaque reduction assays (PRA)

93

in Vero E6 cells whether the antiviral activity of MEDS433 could be overcome by

94

supplementing cell medium with increasing concentrations of exogenous uridine to bypass

95

the requirement of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. As shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel), the

96

anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of 0.3 μM MEDS443 was significantly reversed by a 100-fold

97

excess of uridine relative to MEDS433 concentration, and completely overturned by

98

greater uridine concentrations, thus confirming that the de novo pyrimidine pathway was

99

inhibited by MEDS433 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Then, to conclusively prove that

100

hDHODH inhibition was responsible of MEDS433 antiviral effect, increasing

101

concentrations of the hDHODH substrate dihydroorotic acid or its product, orotic acid were

102

added to cell medium. In SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells treated with MEDS433 (0.3

103

μM), the addition of orotic acid reversed in a dose dependent manner the antiviral effect of

104

MEDS433 (Fig. 3, lower panel), with complete reversion observed at the highest

105

concentration (1000 x the MEDS433 concentration) evaluated. In contrast, the supplement

106

of dihydroorotic acid, even at 1 mM (3,333 times more than MEDS433), did not affect

107

MEDS433 antiviral activity (Fig. 3, lower panel), thus indicating that MEDS433 inhibited a

108

step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway downstream from dihydroorotic acid.

109

Altogether, these results clearly confirmed that MEDS433 specifically targets hDHODH

110

activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and that this inhibition is responsible of its overall

111

antiviral activity.

112

In conclusion, our study while confirming along with others recent reports (12,18)

113

hDHODH as a noteworthy target to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection (10,19), highlights

114

MEDS433 as an attractive candidate to develop HTA for COVID-19. MEDS433 in fact

115

performs better than brequinar for both antiviral potency and SI (this study and 16), and its

116

safety profile is superior to that of PTC299 (12). Therefore, the potent in vitro anti-SARS-

117

CoV-2 activity of MEDS433 and its valuable drug-like profile, support further studies to

118

validate its therapeutic efficacy in preclinical animal models of COVID-19.

after viral infection (from 0 to 48 h p.i.) (post-treatment, Post-T). Thereafter, production of infectious SARS-CoV-2
was measured by titrating cell supernatants by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. The data shown represent means ±
SD (error bars) of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was calculated by a
one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. *** (p < 0.0001) compared to the calibrator sample
(MEDS433 alone).
(B) Immunoblot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Total protein extracts prepared from SARS-CoV-2infected Vero E6 cells monolayers treated as described in (A), were fractionated through a 10% SDS-PAGE, and
immunoblotted with an anti-N protein mAb. Tubulin was immunodetected as protein loading control.

Figure 3. Uridine or orotic acid supplementation counteracts the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of MEDS433.
Vero E6 cell were treated with solvent (DMSO) or 0.3 mM of MEDS433 in the absence or presence of increasing
concentrations of uridine (upper panel), orotic acid or dihydroorotic acid (lower panel) before and during infection
with SARS-CoV-2 (30 PFU/well). Following virus adsorption, compounds were added to cell monolayers and viral
plaques were then stained and were microscopically counted at 48 h p.i.. Plaque counts for each drug
concentration were expressed as a percent of the mean count of the control cultures treated with DMSO. The data
shown represent means ± SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was
calculated by a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. ** (p < 0.0001), ** (p < 0.001)
