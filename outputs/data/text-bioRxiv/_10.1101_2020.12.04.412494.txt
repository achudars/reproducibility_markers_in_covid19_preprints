Abstract
The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age as older patients are at
the highest risk. Although it is still unclear whether the virus is blood-transmitted, the
viral RNA is detected in serum. Identifying how Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) interacts with specific blood components during aging is
expected to guide proper therapies. Considering that all human coronavirus require host
cellular molecules to promote infection, we investigated the aging whole blood
transcriptome from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to explore

differentially expressed genes (DEGs) translated into proteins potentially interacting
with viral proteins. From a total of 22 DEGs in aged blood, five genes (FASLG, CTSW,
CTSE, VCAM1, and BAG3) changed expression during aging. These age-related genes
are involved in immune response, inflammation, cell component and cell adhesion, and
platelet activation/aggregation. Both males and females older than 50 overexpress
FASLG compared with younger adults (20-30 years old), possibly inducing a hyperinflammatory cascade that activates specific immune cells. Furthermore, the expression
of cathepsins (CTSW and CTSE) and the anti-apoptotic co-chaperone molecule BAG3
was significantly increased throughout aging in both gender. By exploring publicly
available Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data on peripheral blood of
SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, we found FASLG and CTSW expressed mainly in
natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T lymphocytes whereas BAG3 was
expressed in CD4+ T cells, naive T cells, and CD14+ monocytes. The increased
expression of FASLG in blood during aging may explain why older patients are more
prone to severe acute viral infection complications. These results indicate FASLG as a
prognostic candidate and potential therapeutic target for more aggressive clinical
manifestation of COVID-19.

Key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, whole blood, FASL, tumor necrosis factor
ligand, elderly patients.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. This virus is associated
with a broad spectrum of respiratory disturbances, varying from upper airway
symptoms to aggressive pneumonia [2]. In lung parenchyma, it produces alveolar
edema, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage [2]. Notably, vascular changes are one of the
distinctive features of COVID-19. Many patients have demonstrated clinical signs of
thrombotic microangiopathy [3], with intravascular coagulation and thrombosis
associated with multisystem organ failure [4].
Although SARS-CoV-2 affects the lungs primordially, there is convincing
evidence that it alters the coagulation processes in severe cases [5]. The formation of
blood clots disrupts circulation due to thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and heart
attacks [3,4]. The association of these changes in coagulation and protein aggregates
with alterations in inflammatory parameters results in an increase of COVID-19
mortality at alarming proportions. The micro-thrombotic environment arises from
hyperactivation of the coagulation cascade associated with hyper-intense inflammation
and immune activities [6]. Of note, the clotting process is complex and likely
orchestrated by the massive release of pro-inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), mainly released from monocytes and endothelial cells [6].
The fact that the mortality rate of patients aged 60 years and over is higher than those
under 60 years is indisputable [7]. Most of these critical cases are associated with the
"cytokine storm," as these exacerbated immune reactions may lead to an early death of
elderly people regardless of comorbidities related to more severe cases [8].
Recent findings are correlating the blood subtype with viral susceptibility and
infection [9,10]. However, the individual molecular machinery of blood cells may be
detrimental for the grade and type of response, such as exacerbated or reduced
inflammation. Considering that aging is one of the most significant risk factors for
severe cases of COVID-19, it is essential to determine blood host genetic variation
throughout the aging process. The evolutionary conservation between the 2019 novel
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [11] allows the possibility to understand similarities and
differences between these coronaviruses into public databases. Using computational
predictions of SARS-CoV–human protein-protein interactions (PPIs), we can identify
possible mechanisms behind the viral infection and identify potential drug targets
[12,13].

Considering that older individuals, with or without comorbidities, are more
prone to develop more severe cases of COVID-19, including those related to blood
perturbations, we investigated the whole blood transcriptome data during aging using
the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database [14,15]. This strategy provided
significant insights into age-associated target genes and how they can predict SARSCoV-2- interactions in aged blood components.

Materials and Methods
Whole blood transcriptome during aging
We used whole blood RNA-Seq data from 670 males and females available at
the GTEx portal (release V8) (https://www.gtexportal.org/)

[16]. The BioJupies

platform (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/biojupies/) [17] was used to find the
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in whole blood samples over aging (20-79 yearsold). The samples were selected and matched per age range: 30-39, 40-49, 50-59; 60-69
and 70-79. Then, age ranges were individually compared with young adults (aged 2029). Genes with Log2 fold-change ≥ |1| ≤ |1| and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were
considered as DEGs (Supplementary Tables 1-5). The DEGs were used to identify
protein-protein interaction networks and perform gene ontology enrichment analyses
(Supplementary Figure 1).

Virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) overlapping DEGs in whole blood with
SARS-CoV-related perturbations
We first selected SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mediators using the human proteins
available in the COVID-19 Cell Atlas (https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/). In addition
to this screening, we compared upregulated and downregulated DEGs in the whole
blood during aging with the corresponding proteins that interact with HCoVs
(Supplementary Table 9) by using publicly available databases. To uncover HCoVshuman PPIs, we used data from the Pathogen–Host Interactome Prediction using
Structure Similarity (P-HIPSTer, http://phipster.org/) database. P-HIPSTer is a broad
protein catalog of the virus-human interactions upon structural information with an
experimental validation rate of approximately 76% [18]. Our research has used PHIPSTer to identify proteins potentially interacting with SARS-CoV-2 in other tissues
[19,20].

The relative expression of FASLG, CTSW, CTSE, VCAM1, and BAG3 (TMM
normalized; V8 cohort) was also performed independently in male and female samples
using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. The results were analyzed with
GraphPad Prism v. 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA).
Significant differences were set at P < 0.05.

Tissue-specific interaction networks of potential SARS-CoV-host blood interactome
The HumanBase tool (https://hb.flatironinstitute.org) [21] was used to provide
whole blood-specific networks based on upregulated genes during aging that code for
proteins potentially interacting with SARS-CoV according to P-HIPSTer. We
considered five functional modules: co-expression, interaction, transcription factor
binding, gene set enrichment analysis perturbations and microRNA targets as active
interaction sources, applying a minimum interaction confidence of 0.12. The maximum
number of genes was set as 15.
Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes during aging
We performed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis (Biological
Processes) to identify the functions of DEGs by using the EnrichR database
(http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) [22]. Top enriched terms were generated
according to the lowest p-value < 0.05 (Fisher's exact test). The molecular function and
protein class related to the blood components during aging were performed in the
PANTHER classification system v. 11.0 (http://www.pantherdb.org/) [23]. We used the
UniProtKB database (http://www.uniprot.org/) to obtain functional information of the
identified proteins.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks based on blood gene expression profile
during aging
The genes that appeared overexpressed in aged blood samples were analyzed by
STRING online tool (https://string-db.org/) [24]. The metasearch STRING database
(Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes, v. 10.5) was used for mapping PPI
enrichment. We considered the following settings: text mining, databases, experiments,
and co-occurrence as sources of interaction. The minimum interaction score was 0.900

(highest confidence); in the networks, the disconnected nodes were hidden to show
reliable interactions exclusively. The PPI enrichment P-value indicates the statistical
significance registered by STRING. (access in October 2020).

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human peripheral blood cells
We investigated the expression of selected genes (FASLG, CTSW, CTSE, VCAM
and BAG3) in distinct blood cell populations based on previously published human
single-cell RNA-seq data [25]. This single-cell dataset is available at the COVID-19
Cell Atlas (https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/) and was explored using the cellxgene
interactive viewer (https://cellxgene.cziscience.com). The dataset includes peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) populations from patients hospitalized with COVID19 (n=7); patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 4), and healthy controls
displaying no diasease (n = 6).

Structural analysis of the Fas and FasL
The genes Fas (genbank code: XP_006717882.1) and FasL (genbank code:
NP_000630.1) were obtained on NCBI GenBank, and protein structure blast of these
sequences were performed using NCBI blastp suite [26]. Next, PDB structures and
FASTA sequences were downloaded on protein data Bank [27], and the sequences
obtained from GenBank and PDB were aligned on LALIGN [28]. Finally, sequence
molecular mass calculation was evaluated using ProtParam expasy [29].

Data representation and analysis
The comparison of blood candidate genes was based on Venn diagrams using
the Venny2.0 tool (https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html) [30]. Heatmaps
and Scatter plots for clustering analyses were performed using the web tool Morpheus
(https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus) [31]. Metascape was used to provide GO
terms enrichment [32] obtained from aged blood genes that potentially interact with
SARS-CoV-2.

Results
The number of differentially expressed genes and the complexity of associated
functions increase in the whole blood during aging
The number of DEGs varied significantly throughout aging (Log2 FC ≥ |1| ≤ |1|
and FDR < 0.05; Tables S1-S5). We detected an increased number of DEGs in subjects
with 50-59 years old (62 DEGs; 53 up- and 9 downregulated, respectively), 60-69 (251
DEGs; 212 up- and 39 downregulated, respectively), being the older individuals of 7079 with the highest number (913 DEGs; 498 up- and 415 downregulated, respectively).
These DEGs were predicted into PPI networks associated with immune response,
cytokine and receptor activity, defense response, response to a stimulus, and signaling
receptor binding (Figure S1 A-C). Forty-one upregulated genes shared the
transcriptional profile during aging and are associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction, lymphocyte and natural killer chemotaxis, and eosinophil migration (FDR <
0.05, combined score > 86.06; Figure S1 D-E and Tables S6-S7). The most prominent
molecular functions were binding, regulation, and catalytic activity, while protein
classes included those related to immunity, transcriptional regulator, signaling
molecule, and protein modifying enzyme (Figure S1 F). Seven down-regulated genes
shared the transcriptional profile during aging and mostly associated with
apolipoprotein receptor binding, regulation of low-density lipoprotein, protein
autoprocessing, negative regulation of receptor binding, and receptor-mediated
endocytosis (FDR < 0.05, combined score > 75.90; Figure S1 G-H and Tables S6-S8).
The catalytic activity, molecular regulator, transducer, and transcription activities were
the most common molecular functions, while protein classes included transcriptional
regulator, protein binding activity, protein modifying enzyme, and carrier protein
(Figure S1 I). Upregulated and downregulated profiles of DEGs are depicted in the
volcano plots (Figure S1 J).

Virus-host PPI interactions reveal increased expression of potential targets in whole
blood during aging
Next, we used the list of DEGs during aging to identify transcripts translated
into proteins that potentially interact with SARS-CoV proteins based on P-HIPSTer
database. This analysis identified 22 genes with an age-dependent expression profile
(Table S9; Figure 1 A). Younger individuals (20-29, 30-39, and 40-49 years old)
showed similarities and were distinctly clustered than older individuals (50-59, 60-69,

and 70-79 years old). By comparing clusters two by two, the age range of 20-29 years
old showed a unique mean expression pattern compared to other aging groups (Figure
S2). Among DEGs translated into predicted proteins interacting with SARS-CoV, most
of them appeared overexpressed in the age range of 50-79 years old (Figure 1 B and C);
while FASLG appeared overexpressed in individuals aged 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79, the
CTSW, CTSE, VCAM1 and BAG3 targets were commonly overexpressed in the two
older groups of individuals (60-69 and 70-79 years-old). The exclusive DEGs in
individuals of 60-79 years old were HBQ1, HSPA5, EPB41L3, SRC, PDCD1, CD7,
CD8A, IGSF9, EPB41L4A, FRMPD3, and SCN2B. After investigating tissue-specific
functional modules using these DEGs, we observed a consistent interaction of whole
blood proteins as being mostly associated with natural killer cells (Figure 1 D).
We generated a PPI network for all over-represented targets using the STRING
database (enrichment p-value < 1.0e-16, highest confidence of 0.09; Figure 1 E). This
analysis highlighted FASLG, SRC, VCAM1, BAG3, and HSPA5 as the main interactions
involved in immune response, inflammation, and platelet activation and aggregation;
these proteins are directly or indirectly associated with the plasma membrane. To
identify top enriched terms, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis using these
targets to unravel aged blood’s functional significance with virus-host PPI. The most
relevant processes and molecular function included the immune system process, cellular
component organization, biological adhesion, signaling and response to a stimulus,
regulation of the biological process, and developmental process (Figure 1 F). Although
CTSW and CTSE proteins are related to viral endosomal escape, FASLG, VCAM1, and
BAG3 interact with viral Orf8 and protein sars7a (Tables S10 and S11). Also, VCAM1
and BAG3 showed potential interaction with spike glycoprotein, E2 glycoprotein
precursors, Excised polyprotein 1..4369 (gene: orf1ab), and Full_polyprotein 1..4382.

Gender-dependent transcriptional responses in whole blood during aging
We further compared mean gene expression in a cohort with female and male
samples to identify gender-dependent responses (GTEx, release V8). When we
compared male and female blood samples together, we found that expression of
FASLG, CTSW, CTSE, and BAG3 genes significantly increased throughout aging
(Figure 2). VCAM1 was the only transcript that increases its levels in individuals of 6069 years old compared with younger individuals (20-29 years old). The gene expression
profile in the whole blood of male and females samples were similar. Notably, FASLG

showed an increased expression over the age of 50 in the blood of males and females in
a similar manner (Figures S2 and S3). Among all DEGs, CTSW presented a similar
expression profile in males and females. The CTSE was higher in males > 50 years old
compared to females. Specifically, VCAM1 and BAG3 showed age-dependent
expressions when men and women were analyzed individually (Figure S2 and S3).

FASL is predominantly expressed by NK cells and CD8+ T cells
We analyzed the expression profile of our candidate genes (FASLG, CTSW,
CTSE, VCAM1, and BAG3) to identify blood cell subpopulations in single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of peripheral mononuclear blood cells from SARS-CoV2-infected patients. Of note, natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T cells, and alpha-beta
memory T cells were associated with the expressions of FASLG and CTSW genes, the
latter being expressed by a higher number of immune cells (Figure 3 A and B). Also,
BAG3 gene was mainly expressed in CD4+ alpha-beta memory T cells, naïve T cells,
and in CD14+ monocytes (Figure 3 C). We also noticed that VCAM1 and CTSE genes
were minimally expressed by these blood cells (Figure 3 D and E).
Fas ligand (FasL) comprises 281 amino acids (aa) and is divided into a Cterminal intracellular domain (1-80 aa), a transmembrane domain (81-102 aa), a Nterminal extracellular domain (103-281 aa) (Figure 4 A). While FasL N-terminal
extracellular domain is responsible for self-association, the FasL C-terminal
intracellular domain has a function of receptor binding (PDB ID: 4MSV, chain A;
Figure 4 B). Its Fas receptor comprises 335 aa, which are divided into a putative signal
sequence of 16 aa (the N-terminal domain with 155 aa, the transmembrane region with
19 aa, and the C-terminal domain with 145 aa (Figure 4 C and D). Although structurally
unresolved, the complex Fas/FasL is formed by binding of trimeric FasL to Fas,
resulting in signaling-competent trimers that lead to the assembly of death-inducing
signaling complex (DISC) with intracellular proteins. Figure 5 summarizes the possible
mechanistic role of Fas/FasL signaling activation after SARS-CoV-2 viruses enter the
bloodstream and interact with T cells and NK cells. This may result in exacerbated
immune response throughout the organism in addition to inducing exhaustion of
particular blood cells.

Discussion
The multi-systemic involvement associated with rapid clinical deterioration is
among the hallmarks of COVID-19-related mortality. Blood components are deeply
involved with widespread virus dissemination and disease aggressiveness; recent
approaches uncovered that coronavirus’s immune responses persist beyond six months
[33]. To better understand what happens with the blood of patients over aging, we
investigated the virus-host interactions using whole blood samples of a young adult
compared with older adult individuals. In general, a distinct profile of blood targets was
clustered with younger ages (20-49) and older ages (50-79), in which the most distant
groups (20-29 years old versus 70-79 years old) displayed an inverse gene expression
pattern. The most pronounced effects were observed over the age of 50 and included
higher expression of SARS-CoV-2-related genes (e.g., genes involved in immune
response, inflammation, cell component and adhesion, biological process, and platelet
activation/aggregation). The increase in inflammatory mediators strongly correlates
with disease severity within the conception of cytokine storm [34,35]. Since blood
diffuses through the capillaries to guarantee tissue perfusion, the multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome may be likely due to essential elements arising from cytokine
storm; therefore, monitoring cytokines reduce mortality in other viral diseases such as
SARS, MERS, and influenza [36]. Unlike an early infection, the advanced disease is
associated with low levels of the antiviral interferons (IFNs) and high levels of
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and chemokines (CCL-2,
CCL-3, and CCL-5) secreted by coronavirus-infected immune cells [37,38].
We provided herein a transcriptomic investigation to identify a possible
signature of reliable candidates involved with aged blood. While FASLG was found to
be overexpressed in the three highest age ranges of 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 years, some
cathepsins (CTSW and CTSE), adhesion-related molecule (VCAM1), and chaperone
regulator molecule (BAG3) were commonly increased after the age of 60. FasL is a
type-II transmembrane and homotrimeric protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) family After binding to its Fas receptor, a type-I transmembrane TNF receptor,
FasL triggers apoptotic and highly inflammatory activities [39]. Although Fas-FasL
signaling has shown involvement in apoptosis of immune cells and virus-infected-target
cells [40], emerging evidence highlights the apoptosis-independent role of Fas-FasL on
the induction of active pro-inflammatory signals in severe pathological conditions (e.g.,
viral infection) [41,42]. FasL promotes T cell activation in humans by recruiting cFLIP

to the DISC, thereby activating NF-kB and ERK/AP-1 transcription factors [43]. These
activations were responsible for the secretion of IL-2 and T cell proliferation; IL-8 was
also associated with NF-kB transactivation in bronchiolar epithelial cells, whereas
macrophages secreted TNF-α after Fas ligation [44] without triggering apoptotic
signaling. Consistently with these findings, we detected by single-cell analysis that FasL
is mainly secreted by CD8+ T and NK cells in the peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2infected patients. More importantly, a possible interaction of viral Orf8 with a variety of
host proteins including FasL may explain the rapid spread of the coronavirus and
immune evasion, since Orf8 of SARS-CoV-2 is highly secreted and downregulated
MHC-I in cells [45]. A recent study by Sorbera et al. [46] on specific SARS-CoV-2induced targets reported Fas-FasL signaling involved with endothelial function and
neutrophil lifespan and related SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis with potential viral
replication. Thus, inhibiting Fas/FasL interaction may be useful in the treatment of
COVID-19.
A comprehensive study using whole blood samples from 54 COVID-19 patients
documented a dramatic increase in immature neutrophils in parallel with a decrease in
CD8+ T and VD2 γδ T-cells count, which is likely due to its differentiation and
activation [47]. Based on this fact, we believe that the low count of FasL-associated
CD8+ T cells could result from its activation. The immune responses to SARS-CoV-2
infection are often characterized by hyperactivation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [48,49]
and macrophages [50], which produce massive levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Current evidence reports that critically ill patients have elevation in IL-6 levels
compared to moderately ill patients [35]; in addition to the infiltration of inflammatory
cells, immune cells have been found in patients’s lung tissues. Notably, diseaseassociated transcriptional change in aged whole blood had a more pronounced overlap
with control blood in comparison to lung tissue transcriptome [51]. By interacting host
genes with SARS-CoV-2 and blood transcriptome, Bhattacharyya and Thelma [51]
further suggested that viral infection only alters expression profile already dysregulated
in the elderly, thereby resulting in poor prognosis; these altered blood genes may
reinforce the appearance of severe clinical manifestations including strokes, blood clots,
and heart failures.
The expression of CTSW, CTSE, VCAM1, and BAG3 was further shared in the
two last age ranges compared to young individuals. Cathepsins SW (CTSW) and SE
(CTSE) are papain-like cysteine protease and intracellular aspartic protease,

respectively. These molecules were mainly overexpressed in males compared to
females. The cathepsins B/L have been described to mediate viral entry into host cells
via the endosomal pathway, participating in cell death, protein degradation, autophagy,
and immune activities [52-54]. Although CTSB and CTSL are mainly associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection, CTSW is involved in the escape of viral particles from late
endosomes during influenza A virus (IAV) replication [55]. Otherwise, CTSE is
expressed in immune cells being implicated in antigen processing MHC class II
pathway [56]. Targeting CTSW and CTSE may also be a promising alternative to treat
COVID-19.
Serum levels of VCAM1 are elevated in mild COVID-19 and highly increased
in severe cases [57]. There are several pathological evidence of thromboembolism,
diffuse endothelial inflammation, and viral infection of endothelial cells [58,59] that are
strictly related to disease severity and dysfunctional coagulation. Importantly, it is of
great value to investigate the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules in aged
COVID-19 patients.
The BAG3, an anti-apoptotic co-chaperone molecule referred to as BCL2associated athanogene 3, was upregulated in naive T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD14+ T
cells from aged individuals. BAG3 is involved in a variety of biological processes such
as cell survival and apoptosis, cellular stress response, and cell migration, and is
suggested to be part of the SARS-CoV machinery for replication [60]. In this context,
BAG3 inhibition seems to promote a significant suppresion of viral replication. Like
VCAM1, the BAG3 is predicted to interact with spike (S) glycoproteins. These surface
molecules favor virus attachment, fusion, and entry into host cells as a direct target
involved in immune responses, being lately evaluated for design and development of the
S protein-based vaccines [61]. After SARSCoV2 enters the bloodstream, a cascade
of events occurs resulting in blood clots and strokes [62]. We verified upregulation of
proto-oncogene (SRC) and heat-shock protein 70 member 5 (HSPA5) genes in aged
individuals (70-79 years old); these are linked to platelet aggregation, activation, and
signalings. The other upregulated targets showed involvement in adaptive immunity,
immunoglobulin domain, T cell receptor signalings, and cell adhesion. Future
approaches are needed to evaluate the role of these blood targets considering COVID19-related comorbidities and individual physical conditions over aging.

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that blood gene expression of FASLG, a Fas
receptor-ligand triggering non-apoptotic inflammatory activities, is overexpressed in
NK cells and CD8+ T cells of males and females after the age of 50. Our in-depth study
further evidenced the increase in some cathepsins, cell adhesion, and co-chaperone
molecules potentially involved in host cell entry, replication, and vascular dysfunction
during aging. Because hypercytokinemia is described as the framework for disease
severity and high-risk death, we highlight FASL as a prognostic biomarker and a
therapeutic proposal to modulate inflammation in elderly patients with COVID-19.
Additional studies are encouraged to test the presence of this biomarker in different
disease modalities.

Figure 5. Possible mechanisms underlying the Fas-FasL-mediated signaling in the
immune cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. By infecting specific immune cells, the
cytokine storm takes place with elevation in interleukins and chemokines such as IL-1,
IL-2, IL-10, IFNs, TNF-α, IP-10, like others. In addition to inflammatory mediators,
FasL ligand is highly released by these immune cells, which, in turn, bind to its Fas
receptor in the target cell. Upon FasL binding, the apoptosis inhibitor cFLIP is
upregulated at the post-translational level and is associated with TRAF1 and TRAF2
and with the kinases RIP and Raf-1, resulting in activation of NF-kB transcription factor
and ERK signaling. These anti-apoptotic signals lead to potentiated pro-inflammatory
effects via Fas engagement, while FasL increases activated human T cells’ proliferation.

Figure S2. Heatmap of the whole blood samples distributed by age after PPI virushost interaction prediction. Data showing the mean expression of differentially
expressed genes, normalized by the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) and visualized
as Z-score. Two factors (A and B) were used for age clustering.

Figure S3. Gene expression levels (TMM) of common targets in female blood
samples over aging. Data are represented in boxplot by mean ± SD. * P < 0.05, ** P <
0.001, and *** P < 0.0001 vs. young adult individuals (20-29 years old). ANOVA
complemented by Tukey's test. FASLG: tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily
member 6; CTSE: cathepsin E; CTSW: cathepsin W; VCAM1: vascular cell adhesion
molecule 1; BAG3: BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 3.
