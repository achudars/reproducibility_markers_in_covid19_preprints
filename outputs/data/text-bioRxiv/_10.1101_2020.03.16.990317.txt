The newly emerged pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has posed a significant

29

public health threat worldwide. However, the mode of virus transmission and

30

tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver

31

damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us

32

to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to

33

determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon

34

SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver

35

ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of

36

cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to

37

SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection

38

impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through

39

dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid

40

transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent

41

liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused

42

directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our

43

findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the

44

tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug

45

discovery.

Introduction

47

A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (previously named 2019-nCoV) infection in

48

Wuhan (China) has caused emergent and significant threats to global public health1.

49

The dominant symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are fever and

50

cough2,3. However, a proportion of patients showed multi-organ damage and

51

dysfunction2-4. Of note, liver damage is emerging as a co-existed symptom reported

52

in patients with COVID-19. A recent epidemiologic study in Shanghai (China)

53

reported that 75 out of 148 (50.7%) COVID-19 patients had liver function

54

abnormality, indicated by key liver function parameters above the normal range,

55

including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline

56

phosphatase (ALP) or total bilirubin (TBIL)5. A national wide clinical study collecting

57

1,099 COVID-19 patients revealed that around 20% of patients had elevated ALT and

58

AST and around 10% of patients had elevated TBIL. Especially, the percentage of

59

patients with liver damage is much higher in severe patients than that in non-severe

60

ones2. Although the clinical correlation has been implicated, it is still unclear whether

61

the liver damage is caused by direct virus infection in the liver or by systematic

62

reasons such as cytokine storm.

63

Viruses bind to host receptors to initiate the infection. Recent studies have

68

ACE2+ population in cholangiocytes compared to hepatocytes in human healthy liver

69

was reported recently14, implying that SARS-CoV-2 might directly target ACE2+

70

cholangiocytes in patients. However, whether the virus indeed infects human

71

cholangiocytes thus causes local damage has not been addressed yet.

72

At present, due to the lack of suitable research models, studies on mechanisms of

73

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis mainly depend on bioinformatics analysis, clinical

74

characteristics and rare autopsy reports15. Here we report the use of human

75

organoids as a tool to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 infection and induced tissue

76

damage ex vivo at the cellular and molecular levels. By single-cell RNA sequencing,

77

we found that long-term human liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human

78

specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal

79

organoids were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust viral

80

replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting

81

functions of cholangiocytes in human liver ductal organoids. These results suggest

82

that the dysfunction of cholangiocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection could

83

contribute to the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients,

84

and control of liver damage should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our

85

findings also provide a useful model of SARS-CoV-2 infection for pathogenesis study

86

and novel drug discovery.

Results

88

ACE2+ cholangiocytes are preserved in human liver ductal organoid cultures.

89

To establish the SARS-CoV-2 infection model with human liver ductal organoids,

90

we first determined whether the long-term organoid culture could preserve the

91

ACE2+ cholangiocytes ex vivo. We processed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)

92

to interrogate the transcriptome of cholangiocytes in human liver ductal organoids.

93

A total number of 7,978 cells were analyzed and cell populations were visualized by

94

t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), partitioning the cells into 7

95

clusters (Fig. 1A). The common cholangiocyte markers EPCAM and KRT19 were

96

uniformly highly expressed in all the 7 clusters, indicating the heterogeneity of

97

cholangiocytes in these organoids was relatively low (Fig. 1B). Notably, we identified

98

the SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene ACE2 expressed sparsely among cluster 0-5 in

99

unbiased preferences and was detectable in 2.92% cells (233 out of 7,978) (Fig. 1C,

100

D). Anti-ACE2 immunostaining further verified the presence of ACE2+ cholangiocytes

101

in human liver ductal organoids (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, we found that the

102

cholangiocytes in mouse primary liver ductal organoids had comparable Epcam

103

expression but no Ace2 (mouse Ace2) expression (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our data

104

demonstrate that long-term human liver ductal organoid culture preserves the

105

human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes and the human liver ductal

106

organoids could serve as a model to study the SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated by

107

receptor ACE2.

Recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human Liver ductal organoids.

110

We next examined the susceptibility of human liver ductal organoids to

111

SARS-CoV-2. We isolated and plaque-purified the SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19

112

patient in Shanghai. The liver ductal organoids from two individuals were inoculated

113

with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour then re-embedded in Matrigel and maintained in culture

114

medium. We performed immunostaining to identify the virus-positive cholangiocytes

115

24 hours post infection. The expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was

116

readily detected in patchy areas of human liver ductal organoids whereas no signal

117

was found in uninfected control (Figure 2A). In addition, the infected cholangiocytes

118

underwent membrane fusion and formed syncytia (Figure 2A, enlarge). Although the

119

number of infected cholangiocytes was limited, qRT-PCR analysis of the SARS-CoV-2

120

genomic RNAs revealed a dramatic increase of viral load in organoids at 24 hours

121

post infection (Figure 2B). These data demonstrate that human liver ductal organoids

122

are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and support robust viral replication. The

123

recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human organoids suggests that this model

124

could be employed to dissect the viral pathogenesis and to test antivirals.

126

SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of

127

cholangiocytes.

128

The viral load in organoids was significantly decreased at 48 hours post infection

129

(Figure 2B), probably due to virus-induced death of host cholangiocytes or activation

130

of anti-viral response. This promoted us to detect whether SARS-CoV-2 infection

131

could influence the tissue behavior.

132

The main function of cholangiocytes in homeostasis is to transport bile acid

133

secreted by hepatocytes into bile ducts. The tight junction between cholangiocytes

134

maintains the barrier function of bile ductal epithelium, which is essential for bile

135

acid collection and excretion. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection ablated the

136

expression of Claudin1 (Figure 3), suggesting that the barrier function of

137

cholangiocytes was disrupted. More importantly, the expression of two major bile

138

acid transporters, apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and cystic

139

fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), was significantly reduced

140

following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2

141

infection impairs the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes

142

through modulating the expression of genes involved in tight junction formation and

143

bile acid transportation. Our study therefore supports the idea that the liver damage

144

in COVID-19 patients might be resulted from direct cholangiocyte injury and

145

consequent bile acid accumulation induced by viral infection.

Discussion and Conclusion

147

Organoids retain the biology of individual tissues, which hold great promise for the

148

study of host–microbe interaction16. Here we demonstrated that long-term human

149

liver ductal organoid culture preserves the human specific ACE2+ population of

150

cholangiocytes. The SARS-CoV-2 exposure experiments revealed that the virus infects

151

and replicates efficiently in these organoids. To our knowledge, this is the first

152

SARS-CoV-2-human organoid infection model reported. Given that the culture

153

conditions for various organoids (lung, intestine and kidney) have been established, it

154

would be intriguing to study the tropism, replication, and innate immune response of

155

SARS-CoV-2 infection in other organs that are targeted by this virus.

156

It appears that liver dysfunction or damage in severe patients with COVID-19 is a

157

common but unignored phenomena. The improper use of anti-viral drugs may be

158

hepatotoxic and cause liver damage. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection may

159

trigger overwhelming inflammatory response and lead to tissue injury at multi-organ

160

levels including the liver2. In this study, by using the human liver ductal organoids as

161

model, we have clearly shown that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cholangiocytes and

162

impair their barrier and bile acid transporting functions. This could be due to the

163

direct viral cytopathogenic effect on target cells that express the ACE2 as entry

164

receptor. The viral infection may also down-regulate the expression of host genes

165

involved in the formation of tight junction and transportation of bile acid. Thus, it is

166

noteworthy to take into account the fact that the liver damage in COVID-19 patients

167

might be in part the result of direct cholangiocyte injury and consequent bile acid

accumulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be cautious in clinical

169

treatment.

170

By employing human liver ductal organoids, we have investigated the infection and

171

liver tissue damage of SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Besides the dissection of viral

172

pathogenesis, this platform could also be applied to evaluate the efficacy of novel

173

anti-viral drugs, especially when ideal animal models are lacking.

paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25%

204

Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100) in PBS for 30 min. The organoids were then

205

washed with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked by 5% BSA in PBST

206

for 1 hour at room temperature. Organoids were incubated with the primary

207

Single-cell RNA seq and data analysis.

224

Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed using the 10x Genomics Chromium

225

System. Human liver ductal tissues were derived from a patient who underwent

226

resection, cultured for 3 passages as described above. Mouse primary liver ductal

227

organoids were cultured from biliary ducts isolated from an 8-week-old C57BL/6

228

mouse. Briefly, organoids were dissociated with 1× TrypLE Select Enzyme (Gibco,

229

12563011) to obtain single cell suspension. A total of around 8,000 cells per sample

230

were captured on a 10×Chromium device and library preparation was carried out

231

using Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v2 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10×

232

Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.

233

Cell Ranger (version 3.1) with default parameters was used to process sequencing

234

data to generate feature-barcode matrices. The human dataset was analyzed using

235

the standard workflow on the Seurat R Package (version 3.1.3) (Butler et al., 2018).

236

For the feature-barcode matrix of 8,094 cells from the human dataset, we removed

237

cells with less than 500 genes and more than 6,000 genes as well as cells with high

238

fraction of mitochondrial UMIs (> 20%). 7,978 high quality cells and 17,447
