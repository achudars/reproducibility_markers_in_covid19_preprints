Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a broad clinical presentation
ranging from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. Different features associated
with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, such as hyperinflammation and reduction
of peripheral CD8+ T cell counts are strongly associated with severe disease. Here,
we confirm the reduction in peripheral CD8+ T cells both in relative and absolute terms
and identify T cell apoptosis and migration into inflamed tissues as possible
mechanisms driving peripheral T cell lymphopenia. Furthermore, we find evidence of
elevated serum interleukin-7, thus indicating systemic T cell paucity and signs of
increased T cell proliferation in patients with severe lymphopenia. Following T cell
lymphopenia in our pseudo-longitudinal time course, we observed expansion and
recovery of poly-specific antiviral T cells, thus arguing for lymphopenia-induced T cell
proliferation. In summary, this study suggests that extensive T cell loss and
subsequent T cell proliferation are characteristic of severe COVID-19.

T cell homeostasis in severe COVID-19

Introduction
The global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has affected
at least 15 million people worldwide and led to over 600,000 deaths as of July 2020.
Patients with COVID-19 have a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from
asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Arons
et al., 2020)(Tong et al., 2020)(Li et al., 2020)(Wu and McGoogan, 2020)(Yang et al.,
2020). Advanced age and comorbidities are risk factors for the development of severe
disease (Zhou et al., 2020). Furthermore, individuals with severe disease have
increased amounts and longer duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in the
respiratory mucosa and of viral RNA in blood as compared to individuals with mild
COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020)(Zheng et al., 2020)(Hadjadj et al., 2020). Several reports
have demonstrated associations between severe disease and elevation of systemic
inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and IL-6 (Feng
et al., 2020)(Ruan et al., 2020)(Wu et al., 2020)(Zhou et al., 2020). Taken together
these data suggest that inefficient antiviral immunity and ensuing hyper-inflammation
might underlie the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.
T cells are central players in antiviral immunity. Effector T cells eliminate virus-infected
cells and assist in innate antiviral responses. Virus-specific T cells also support B cells
responses, which culminate in the production of virus-specific antibodies (Cervia et
al., 2020). It has been convincingly shown that severe COVID-19 is associated with
reduced amounts of CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood and that the extent of the T cell
decrease correlates with disease severity (Hadjadj et al., 2020) (Feng et al.,
2020)(Diao et al., 2020)(Du et al., 2020). The reduction in peripheral T cells appears
to be particularly prominent within the CD8+ T cell compartment, but it remains unclear
if this is due to trafficking of CD8+ T cells into tissues with ongoing SARS-CoV-2
replication, increased elimination of CD8+ T cells during COVID-19, or pre-existing
abnormally low levels of CD8+ T cells in individuals who experience severe disease.
Recent reports examining tissue-resident lymphocytes, including CD8+ T cells, in
patients with severe COVID-19 suggest involvement of both migration and apoptosis,
but these studies have evaluated only small numbers of patients (Xu et al., 2020)(Liao
et al., 2020)(Chen et al., 2020). The reduced amount of CD8+ T cells in patients with

severe COVID-19 has also been associated with increased expression of surface
markers typical of T cell exhaustion, such as PD-1 and TIM-3 (Diao et al.,
2020)(Schultheiss et al., 2020). Increased frequencies of exhausted T cells have been
reported in patients with viral infections who have persisting viremia and inefficient
clearance of virus-infected cells (Mueller and Ahmed, 2009)(Shin and Wherry, 2007)
but have also been associated with insufficient type I interferon responses (Kolumam
et al., 2005) and subsequent lack of efficient CD4+ T cell help in acute infections (Wang
et al., 2012).
To facilitate a detailed investigation of the peripheral T cell compartment, we
performed mass cytometry, flow cytometry, targeted proteomics, and functional
assays to phenotypically and functionally characterize the changes associated with
symptomatic COVID-19 and relate them to disease severity. We observed global T
cell loss, especially among CD8+ T cells, which was associated with disease severity
and increased T cell apoptosis, exhaustion, and functional impairment. Furthermore,
we observed signs of lymphopenia induced proliferation and expansion of poly-specific
T cells, suggesting that T cell loss and the compensatory non-specific proliferation are
central to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.

Methods
Subjects and clinical data
Patients 18 years and older with symptomatic, RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection were recruited at four different hospitals in Zurich, Switzerland. Both
hospitalized patients and outpatients were recruited into the study and all participants
gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics
Committee of Zurich (BASEC 2016-01440).
Peripheral blood was obtained from the 70 patients at the time of inclusion into the
study and standardized clinical data were collected longitudinally for all included
patients. Two patients with severe COVID-19 had hematological malignancy and were
excluded from further analysis. Two patients presented with an atypical disease
course with complete symptom resolution and a long symptom-free interval, followed
by development of respiratory symptoms and PCR positivity so that re-infection could

not be excluded, and were also excluded. Disease severity was classified according
to the WHO criteria (World Health Organization, 2020) and patients were stratified as
having mild disease, including mild illness (n=20) and mild pneumonia (n=10), and
severe disease, including severe pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy (n=21) as well
as mild (n=7), moderate (n=8), and severe ARDS (n=4). Of the blood samples from
the 66 subjects, 98%, 85%, 94%, and 98% were analyzed by routine flow cytometry,
mass cytometry, targeted proteomics, and functional T cell assays, respectively.
Additionally, 22 healthy donors without evidence of previous symptomatic SARS-CoV2 were also included as controls. Of the blood samples from the 22 controls, 95%,
100%, 76%, and 90% were analyzed by routine flow cytometry, mass cytometry,
proteomics, and functional T cell assays, respectively.
Blood collection and sample processing
Venous blood samples were collected in BD vacutainer EDTA tubes unless otherwise
specified. Whole blood was centrifuged, and plasma was removed and frozen at -80
°C. The remaining blood was diluted with PBS and layered into a SepMate tube
(STEMCELL, catalog number 85460) filled with Lymphodex solution (Inno-Train
Diagnostik GmBH, catalog number 002041500). After centrifugation, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and washed with PBS. An aliquot of
PBMCs was processed in preparation for mass cytometry. Briefly, 1x106 PBMCs were
centrifuged and resuspended in 200 µl of 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Electron
Microscopy Sciences) in RPMI 1640 medium and fixed at room temperature for 10
min. The reaction was then stopped by adding 1 ml of 0.5% bovine serum albumin
and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS. Cells were centrifuged and stored at -80 °C after
disruption of the cell pellet. The remaining PBMCs were resuspended in 10% dimethyl
sulfoxide and frozen at -80 °C.
Flow cytometry
For quantification of the main T cell subsets, blood samples were processed in the
accredited routine immunology laboratory at the University Hospital Zurich. Briefly, 10
µl of Krome Orange anti-CD45 (Beckman Coulter, clone J33), APC-A750 anti-CD3
(Beckman Coulter, clone UCHT-1), APC anti-CD4 (Beckman Coulter, clone 13B8.2),
and AF700 anti-CD8 (Beckman Coulter, clone B9.11) were added to 100 µl of whole
blood in a 5-mL round-bottom tube, and samples were incubated at room temperature

for 15 min. After adding 2 mL of VersaLyse solution (Beckman Coulter, catalog number
A09777) with 2.5% Fixative Solution (Beckman Coulter, catalog number A07800),
samples were further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Immediately prior to
data acquisition, 100 µl aliquots of Flow-Count Fluoroshperes (Beckman Coulter,
catalog number 7547053) were added to each sample. Data were acquired on a
Navios flow cytometer and analyzed using the Kaluza software.
CD127 levels were quantified in samples from six healthy donors. PBMCs were
obtained as described above, and 1x106 cells from each donor were incubated with
BUV 737 anti-CD3 (BD Biosciences, clone UCHT1), BUV 395 anti-CD4 (BD
Biosciences, clone SK3), AF700 anti-CD8 (Biolegend, clone 5C3), PECy5 anti-CD25
(Invitrogen, clone 61D3), BV510 anti-CD45RA (Biolegend, clone HI100), BV421 antiCCR7 (Biolegend, clone G043H7), PE-Dazzle anti-CD127 (Biolegend, clone A019D5)
at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then washed with staining buffer (PBS, 2%
FBS, 2 mM EDTA) and acquired on a BD Fortessa. Data were analyzed with the Flowjo software.
Mass cytometry analysis
Mass cytometry barcoding. As references for the CyTOF analysis, PBMCs from a
healthy donor were divided into three aliquots and stimulated with 0.1 µg/mL
phytohemagglutinin for 24 h, 1 µg/mL lipopolysaccharide plus 1.5 µg/mL monensin for
48 h, or left unstimulated. After treatment, the PBMCs were fixed and frozen as
described above.
Homogenous staining was ensured by barcoding of 1x106 cells from each patient
following a barcoding scheme consisting of unique combinations of four out of eight
barcoding reagents as previously described (Zunder et al., 2015).
Six palladium isotopes (102Pd,

104

Pd,

105

Pd, 106Pd,

108

Pd, and

110

Pd, Fluidigm) were

chelated to 1-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid
(Dojino), and two indium isotopes (113In and 115In, Fluidigm) were chelated to 1,4,7,10tetraazacy-clododecane-1,4,7-tris-acetic acid 10-maleimide ethylacetamide (Dojino)
following standard procedures (Zivanovic, Jacobs and Bodenmiller, 2014).

Mass-tag barcoding reagents were titrated to ensure an equivalent staining for each
reagent; final concentrations were between 50 nM and 200 nM. Cells were barcoded
using the previously described transient partial permeabilization protocol (Behbehani
et al., 2014). Samples were randomly loaded into wells of 96-well plates and were
analyzed in two independent experiments. Three reference samples were loaded on
each plate. Cells were washed with 0.03% saponin in PBS (PBS-S, Sigma Aldrich)
and incubated for 30 min with 200 μl of mass tag barcoding reagents diluted in PBSS. Cells were then washed three times with cell staining medium (CSM, PBS with 0.5%
bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide), and samples from each plate were
pooled for cell staining with the antibody panel.
Antibodies and antibody labeling. The antibodies used in this study are listed in Table
S1. Antibodies were labeled with the indicated metal tags using the MaxPAR antibody
conjugation kit (Fluidigm). We assessed the concentration of each antibody after metal
conjugation using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific) and then supplemented each
antibody with Candor Antibody Stabilizer. Inventories of antibodies used in this study
were managed using the cloud-based platform AirLab (Catena et al., 2016).
Staining with antibodies and data acquisition. Prior to staining, pooled cells were
incubated with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were
stained with 400 µL of the antibody panel per 107 cells for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were
then washed three times in CSM, once in PBS, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of 0.5 µM
nucleic acid Ir-labeled intercalator (Fluidigm) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells
were then washed once in CSM, once in PBS, and once in water. Prior to acquisition,
cells were diluted to 0.5 x 106 cells/mL in Cell Acquisition Solution (Fluidigm)
containing 10% of EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm). Samples were
acquired on an upgraded Helios CyTOF 2. Individual .fcs files collected from each set
of samples were pre-processed using a semi-automated R pipeline based on
CATALYST to perform individual file concatenation, normalization, compensation,
debarcoding, and batch correction (Fig. S1).
Data analysis. T cells from each sample were classified using a random forest
classifier (R package randomForest), as described in (Chevrier et al., 2020). To
visualize the high-dimensional data in two dimensions, the t-SNE algorithm was
applied on data from a maximum of 1,000 randomly selected cells from each sample,

with a perplexity set to 80, using the implementation of t-SNE available in CATALYST
(Nowicka et al., 2017). All antibody channels were used to calculate the t-SNE. Data
were displayed using the ggplot2 R package or the plotting functions of CATALYST
(Nowicka et al., 2017).
To visualize marker expression on t-SNE maps, data were normalized between 0 and
1 with a maximum intensity defined as the 99th percentile. For hierarchical clustering,
pairwise distances between samples were calculated using the Spearman correlation
or euclidean distance, as indicated in the figure legend. Dendrograms were generated
using Ward.2’s method. Heatmaps were displayed using the pheatmap package.
Clustering analysis of the was performed using the R implementation of PhenoGraph
run on all samples simultaneously, with the parameter k, defining the number of
nearest neighbors, set to 100 (Levine et al., 2015).
Flow cytometric assay for specific cell-mediated immune responses in activated whole
blood
Venous blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes. Blood was diluted with RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 IU/mL
streptomycin (all from Gibco). Blood cells were stimulated with pokeweed mitogen,
concanavalin A, Staphylococcus enterotoxins A and B, or antigens from varicella
zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus 1
(HSV1), or herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) or left unstimulated for 7 days. Cells were
then stained with live/dead fixable Aqua stain (Thermo Fisher, catalog number
L34957) and with Cyto-stat tetrachrome (FITC anti-CD45, PECy5 anti-CD3, PE antiCD4, and ECD anti-CD8, Beckman Coulter, catalog number 660713). Unstimulated
cells and pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cells were additionally stained with AF750
anti-CD19 (Beckman Coulter, clone J3119). Samples were incubated 15 min at room
temperature, then washed once with blocking buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin,
2 mM EDTA), resuspended in VersaLyse solution (Beckman Coulter, catalog number
A09777) with 2.5% Fixative Solution (Beckman Coulter, catalog number A07800) and
incubated 15 min at room temperature. After an additional wash with blocking buffer,
cells were resuspended in blocking buffer. Data were acquired on a Navios flow
cytometer and analyzed with Kaluza analysis software. Net stimulation was calculated
by subtracting the percentage of CD3+ blasts or CD19+ blasts over all lymphocytes in

the unstimulated sample from the percentage of CD3+ blasts or CD19+ blasts over all
lymphocytes in stimulated samples.
Cytokine measurements
Serum was collected in BD vacutainer clot activator tubes (Becton Dickinson). The
samples were processed in the accredited immunological laboratory at the University
Hospital Zurich. IFN-γ and TNF-α were quantified using R&D Systems ELISA kits.
Proteomics analyses
Heat-inactivated plasma samples were analyzed using the Olink® Proteomics 92-plex
inflammation immunoassay. In brief, binding of paired oligonucleotide-labeled
antibodies directed against the targeted serum proteins led to hybridization of the
corresponding DNA oligonucleotides, which were extended by a DNA polymerase.
Expression was quantified using real-time PCR. The values are reported as log2scaled normalized protein expression (NPX) values. Only data on samples that passed
the quality control are reported. Samples below the detection limit are reported as the
lower limit of detection.
Statistics
Descriptive statistics for the study cohort (stratified by healthy, mild disease, and
severe disease) are presented as median and interquartile ranges unless otherwise
specified. For comparisons of two independent groups the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
test was used. The p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Holm
method. For comparisons of more than two independent groups the non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was used. The Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical
variables. A linear regression model was used to quantify the relationship between
variables. Significance was assessed by non-parametric methods unless otherwise
specified. All tests were performed two sided. Analyses were performed with R
(version 4.0.0) and with Graph Pad Prism.

Adamo et al.

T cell homeostasis in severe COVID-19

To characterize the immune response associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection we
conducted a prospective observational study on symptomatic COVID-19 patients
recruited from hospitals in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. The included patients
were stratified based on clinical disease severity at the time of sampling (mild, n=28;
severe, n=38); a group of healthy controls was included for comparison (n=22) (Fig.
1a). Patients were sampled at a single time point during their symptomatic phase, with
approximately 70% sampled within 18 days of symptom onset (Fig. 1a). Standard
laboratory parameters and clinical characteristics of the included patients are
presented in Table 1. In agreement with previous studies (Mathew et al.,
2020)(Schultheiss et al., 2020), we observed that patient age was positively correlated
with disease severity (Fig. 1b) and that males were overrepresented in the severe
COVID-19 subgroup (Fig. 1c).
We performed a comprehensive T cell characterization by staining PBMCs with 41
antibodies (Table S1) and analyzing cells using mass cytometry. T cell-related
markers were visualized on t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
maps (Fig. 1d) (Van Der Maaten and Hinton, 2008). By coloring the t-SNE map by
disease severity, we observed notable differences between healthy donors and
patients with mild or severe COVID-19 (Fig. 1e).
A decrease in CD8+ T cell subsets is a hallmark of severe COVID-19
We determined the frequencies of naive, central memory, effector memory, and
terminal effector memory expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
subsets among all T cells in COVID-19 patients and controls (Fig. 2a, 2b). As
previously reported (Mathew et al., 2020), patients with severe disease had decreased
frequencies of naive cells within the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments compared
to controls (Fig. 2a-d). The frequencies of CD4+ memory subsets were relatively stable
(Fig. 2c). Conversely, the percentages of central memory CD8+ T cells and TEMRA
CD8+ T cells were increased in symptomatic COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2d).
In order to investigate how the relative changes observed within the different T cell
subsets of our COVID-19 cohort related to absolute cell counts, we performed flow
cytometry of whole blood samples from each subject. This enabled us to measure
absolute cell counts for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. S2a), which facilitated the

calculation of absolute numbers for the different T cell subpopulations within our mass
cytometry data set. The marked reduction in naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was
confirmed by absolute counts and was especially pronounced for naive CD8+ T cells
(Fig. 2c, 2d). In contrast, central memory and effector memory populations within the
CD4+ T cell compartment showed a modest reduction in COVID-19 patients compared
to healthy controls (Fig. 2c). Of note, regulatory T cells were not present in higher
numbers in absolute counts in patients compared to controls, despite considerable
expansion in terms of percentages (Fig. S2b).
Absolute numbers of central memory CD8+ T cells, effector memory CD8+ T cells, and
TEMRA CD8+ T cells were all reduced in patients with severe disease compared to
controls and to patients with mild disease (Fig. 2e). Thus, in severe COVID-19, naive
T cell reduction was not accompanied by memory T cell expansion but rather by a
slight decrease of the memory compartment, especially among CD8+, resulting in a
decrease in peripheral T cell counts across all subsets. The patients with severe
COVID-19 in our cohort were older than patients with mild disease (Fig. 1b), which
could account for some differences in the distribution of T cell populations as
previously proposed (Chen, Kelley and Goldstein, 2020). Generally, both lymphopenia
and naive T cell reduction correlated with age (Fig. S2c). Since age and clinical
severity are strongly linked, it is conceivable that some of the alterations within the T
cell compartment might be due to immunological aging and thus pre-date COVID-19.
However, upon stratification of patients according to age, we detected differences
between mild and severe COVID-19 patients in terms of total T cell counts and naive
T cell counts (Fig. S2d), which indicates that age alone does not explain the observed
changes.
Increased apoptosis and migration contribute to lymphopenia in severe COVID-19
We assessed different mechanisms that might contribute to peripheral T cell loss in
patients with severe COVID-19. As expected, COVID-19 patients had strong T cell
activation across all the main subsets (Fig. S3a) as well as an increase in the
proportion of activated T cells and terminally differentiated and senescent T cells (Fig.
S3b, S3c). This activation state was accompanied by considerable expansion of
exhausted T cells, especially in patients with severe disease (Fig. S4a), and these
features were present even in patients who were sampled early in the disease course
(Fig. S4b).

Adamo et al.

T cell homeostasis in severe COVID-19

Given the extent of T cell activation and exhaustion in peripheral blood, we wondered
whether the T cell reduction in this compartment could be the result of activationinduced T cell death, or could rather be explained by migration of activated T cells into
inflamed tissues.
Excessive proinflammatory cytokine signaling, especially mediated by TNF-α, can
lead to T cell apoptosis (Mehta, Gracias and Croft, 2018). As TNF-α levels were
considerably elevated in our cohort (Fig. S4c) in agreement with previous reports
(Vabret et al., 2020), we hypothesized that apoptosis could drive T cell loss during
severe COVID-19 disease. When we examined the percentage of apoptotic cells
among the main CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, we indeed observed significant
increases in the percentages of apoptotic cells among central and effector memory
CD4+ T cells, as well as naive, central memory, and effector memory CD8+ T cells and
TEMRA CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3a).
Among CD8+ T cells, the extent of the apoptosis was higher in samples from patients
with severe COVID-19 disease compared to those from patients with mild symptoms
(Fig. 3a). Even within mild cases, the extent of apoptosis was strongly associated with
disease severity in the CD8 subset (Fig. 3b). Increased T cell apoptosis could thus
contribute to the lymphopenia that is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Further
supporting this hypothesis, we observed an inverse correlation between elevated
apoptosis and absolute T cell numbers (Fig. 3e).
Next, we examined T cell migration to inflamed tissues as a possible mechanism
driving peripheral lymphopenia. Lymphocyte accumulation in infected tissues such as
the lung during COVID-19 progression has been reported in some studies (Liao et al.,
2020)(Xu et al., 2020) but not others (Tian et al., 2020). We therefore sought to detect
indirect signs of T cell migration in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients. T cell
migration into inflamed lung parenchyma is primarily mediated by CXCR3 signaling
(Fadel et al., 2008)(Kohlmeier et al., 2009), and we therefore investigated the level of
CXCR3 ligands in the serum of COVID-19 patients. CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10,
and CXCL11 were significantly increased in sera from COVID-19 patients, especially
in sera from patients with severe disease (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, IFN-γ is a potent
inducer of CXCR3 ligands (Van Raemdonck et al., 2015), and we observed a marked

elevation in IFN-γ (Fig. 3c and Fig. S4d). We also observed a very strong reduction
in CXCR3 expression in all the main T cell subsets with the exception of naive CD4+
T cells in symptomatic patients (Fig. 3d and S4e). Furthermore, CXCR3 abundance
inversely correlated with levels concentrations of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and IFNγ, and was positively correlated with levels of lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells,
and CD8+ T cells levels (Fig. 3e). These data are suggestive of a role for T cell
migration in the lymphopenia associated with severe COVID-19.
Patients with severe COVID-19 show signs of IL-7-induced homeostatic proliferation
of T cells
Because migration and apoptosis are both likely to contribute to the observed T cell
lymphopenia, we looked for indirect signs that would indicate a global T cell loss versus
a shift from the blood compartment to the inflamed tissues.
IL-7 is known to be a critical homeostatic factor for T cells and, since IL-7 production
by stromal cells is relatively constant (Surh and Sprent, 2008), its levels are mostly
regulated by lymphocyte consumption. In patients with severe disease, we observed
higher serum IL-7 levels compared to those with mild disease (Fig. 4a). IL-7 elevation
was independent of time since symptom onset (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, IL-7 levels
inversely correlated with the total number of CD8+ T cells and there was a tendency
toward inverse correlations with CD4+ T cell counts (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these
findings indicate a global T cell loss in severe COVID-19, which results in a systemic
IL-7 elevation.
To assess which T cells would be most responsive to increased IL-7, we determined
protein abundance of IL-7 receptor a (also termed CD127) on naive and memory T
cell subsets. We observed lower abundance of IL-7 receptor a on TEMRA cells
compared to naive, central memory, and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of
healthy subjects (Fig. 4d and 4e). When we looked at T cell proliferation in those same
compartments in COVID-19 patients, we did not observe changes in the percentage
of proliferating (Ki-67+) cells as compared to healthy controls in the CD4+ compartment
(Fig. 4f). In contrast, we observed higher frequencies of proliferative naive, central
memory and effector memory CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients. Proliferation was
especially prominent in patients with severe disease. Of note, we did not observe

increased proliferation of TEMRA CD8+ T cells, despite their activation (Fig. S3a), in
agreement with their reduced IL-7 sensitivity.
Perhaps as a result of proliferation, we observed higher T cell counts in samples from
patients with severe COVID-19 taken at later time points after symptom onset than in
samples taken earlier in the disease course (Fig. 4g).
Lymphopenia induced T cell proliferation drives expansion of poly-specific T cells
We next investigated whether the observed early lymphopenia and subsequent
proliferation had an impact on T cell function. We assessed the ability of peripheral T
cells from patients with mild and severe COVID-19 to form blasts in response to
mitogens, superantigens, and a selection of common viral antigens. We observed
markedly less blast formation by PBMCs from patients upon stimulation with Varicella
Zoster Virus (VZV), Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2)
and adenovirus as compared to healthy controls, and the difference was more
pronounced in samples from the severe COVID-19 group than from the mild groups
(Fig. 5a). The same tendency was not observed when PBMCs were incubated with
pokeweed mitogen or Staphylococcus superantigen, but we did observe a reduction
in proliferation upon stimulation with concanavalin A (Fig. S5a).
Although reduced blast formation upon virus stimulation is likely determined by a
combination of factors, reduced frequency of precursors of virus-specific memory T
cells could be an important element. In support of this, we found that blast formation
positively correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts (Fig. S5b, S5c). Oligoclonal
expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell clones could account for reduced peripheral
precursor memory T cell frequency in mild COVID-19 patients; these patients did not
have significant lymphopenia but did have diminished functional T cell responses.
To determine whether lymphopenia induced homeostatic proliferation could contribute
to the observed T cell proliferation, especially in severe COVID-19, we used the
different sampling time of our included patients as a pseudo-longitudinal time course.
Since blast formation in our functional assay reflects – at least to some extent –
specific memory T cell precursor frequency, we reasoned that homeostatic
proliferation would lead to an increase in poly-specific memory T cell over time, which

in turn would lead to increased blast formation upon stimulation with specific viral
antigens.
Indeed, when we evaluated the relationship between blast formation in response to
different viral stimuli and the time between symptom onset and sample collection, we
detected a marked increase in blast formation upon stimulation with HSV1, HSV2, and
adenovirus as a function of time of sample collection after symptom onset (Fig. 5b). A
trend toward increased blast formation with time was also observed for CMV and VZV
stimulation of samples from patients with severe disease (Fig. 5b), but this was not
observed upon nonspecific stimulation with mitogens and superantigens (Fig. S5d).
The increased blast formation at later time points was also positively correlated with
absolute T cell counts (Fig. S5b, S5c) further linking lymphopenia, homeostatic T cell
proliferation, and increased poly-specific functional capacity. In summary, in patients
with severe COVID-19, lymphopenia induced homeostatic proliferation is present and
likely drives expansion of poly-specific T cells, leading to an improvement of T cell
functionality over time.
Unbiased clustering of the T cell compartment confirms that T cell activation,
exhaustion, and apoptosis are associated with disease severity
In order to investigate whether phenotypes identified in an unbiased manner across
all T cell populations would show the same trends as our analysis of pre-defined cell
subsets, we performed automated clustering using the PhenoGraph algorithm.
Automated clustering identified 15 phenotypically distinct T cell clusters. Clusters were
manually annotated based on the most prominent signature of marker expression (Fig.
6a). Marked differences in the frequencies of the identified clusters were evident in
healthy donors, patients with mild COVID-19, and patients with severe COVID-19 (Fig.
6b). In agreement with our analysis of pre-defined subsets, we observed a marked
reduction in naive CD8+ T cells in patients with severe disease, whereas the proportion
of naive CD4+ T cells remained stable (Fig. 6c). Frequencies of both the activated T
cell subsets (clusters 9 and 10) and the apoptotic, exhausted subsets (clusters 12 and
15) were markedly increased in patients with severe disease compared to controls
(Fig. 6c and Fig. S6). We also observed expansion of granzyme B-producing cytotoxic
CD4+ T cells in patients, especially those with severe COVID-19. Frequencies of some
clusters were strongly associated. This was the case for TEMRA CD8+ cells and
apoptotic or exhausted CD8+ T cells, activated and regulatory CD4+ T cells, as well as

apoptotic exhausted CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6d). In summary, an unbiased analysis of the
mass cytometry data confirmed our key findings on naïve T cell reduction and
substantial increase in T cell activation, exhaustion and apoptosis.
Discussion
Lymphopenia and hyperinflammation are very prominent features of severe COVID19, which speaks to the importance of immunological processes for the disease
pathogenesis. Since T cells are central players in the control of viral infections,
understanding of the perturbances of T cell homeostasis in COVID-19 can provide
insight into the disease mechanisms and inform therapeutic strategies. In our well
characterized COVID-19 cohort, we were able to dissect changes in the T cell
compartments and relate them to disease duration, which allowed us to appreciate
dynamic changes in T cell populations. We were able to identify both extensive
apoptosis and migration as possible mechanisms driving the lymphopenia, as well as
global increase in T cell counts over a pseudo-longitudinal time course, which was at
least partially due to homeostatic proliferation.
The occurrence of peripheral lymphopenia has been described in several human acute
respiratory viral infections (Lewis, Gilbert and Knight, 1986)(Russell et al., 2017).
Lymphopenia in this setting is thought to be in part caused by trafficking of activated
lymphocytes into inflamed tissues where viral replication is ongoing (Kohlmeier et al.,
2009). In severe COVID-19, the extent of lymphopenia is closely linked to disease
severity, development of ARDS, and mortality, which suggests a central role for T cell
lymphopenia in COVID-19 immunopathology (Vabret et al., 2020). Since disease
severity in COVID-19 is associated with biological age, age-associated decline in
lymphocytes could in part account for the observed lymphopenia. Of note, the main
age-related alteration of the T cell compartment that has been associated with
increased risk of mortality is CD4+ T cell loss and inversion of the CD4 to CD8 T cell
ratio (Hadrup et al., 2006). In severe COVID-19, however, we and others have shown
an extensive preferential loss of peripheral CD8+ T cells (Mathew et al., 2020), which
suggests that other mechanisms than age related changes may be involved.
Our analysis of absolute T cell counts indicated marked T cell loss across all subsets
in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartment in patients with COVID-19 compared to
healthy controls. Thus, specific mechanisms directly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection

appear to contribute to the observed changes. Our finding of pronounced elevation in
the levels of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in conjunction with
reduced surface expression of CXCR3 on several key T cell subsets in patients with
symptomatic COVID-19 suggests that migration of T cells into inflamed tissues
contributes to the observed lymphopenia. However, the comparable reduction in
CXCR3 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets does not account for the
observed preferential loss of CD8 T cells. In support of our hypothesis that increased
T cell migration into inflamed tissues does not fully explain the observed reduction in
peripheral T cell numbers, we found evidence of increased amounts of circulating IL7 in patients with severe COVID-19. Levels of circulating IL-7 are primarily regulated
by its consumption by lymphocytes (Surh and Sprent, 2008); thus, the observed
reduced peripheral T cell numbers suggests a global T cell loss in addition to
lymphocyte redistribution in the setting of an acute viral infection. We also observed
that the frequency of apoptotic CD8+ T cell subsets in patients with severe COVID-19
was far greater than among CD4+ T cells indicating that apoptosis of CD8+ T cells
could explain the preferential loss of this subset and be a central mechanism in the
immunopathology of severe COVID-19. Whether T cell apoptosis occurs as a result of
activation-induced cell death in the setting of extensive inflammation or upon direct
interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains to be elucidated.
We did not observe changes in the percentage of proliferating CD4 T cells in our
COVID-19 patients, but there was evidence for increased frequencies of proliferative,
naïve, central memory and effector memory CD8+ T cells that was especially
prominent in patients with severe disease. Although proliferation in the CD8+
compartment could be due to expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, the
increased levels of IL-7 and the robust proliferation of naive CD8+ T cells, especially
in severe disease, suggest a role for IL-7-induced homeostatic proliferation.
Furthermore, in patients with severe COVID-19 we observed an increase in blast
formation upon stimulation with common viral antigens in our pseudo-longitudinal time
course. Since blast formation correlated well with overall CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts,
we interpret this as evidence of increased precursor frequency at later time points
during the infection. Taken together, these data indicate that homeostatic expansion
of poly-specific memory T cells occurs in COVID-19 patients with severe disease.

Adamo et al.

T cell homeostasis in severe COVID-19

In our cohort, we also found evidence of increased T cell exhaustion soon after the
onset of symptoms as well as impaired T cell function, as evidenced by reduced blast
formation upon stimulation with viral antigens. Early T cell dysfunction in patients who
eventually develop severe disease might be caused by an insufficient initial type I
interferon response as recently suggested (Hadjadj et al., 2020). The ensuing
suboptimal T cell immunity could then facilitate further viral dissemination that in turn
stimulates innate immunity, perhaps through CD16+ monocytes (Chevrier et al., 2020).
The subsequent increase in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines could culminate
in a cytokine storm and development of ARDS.
To what extent age-associated individual immunological predisposition contributes to
the development of severe COVID-19 could not be determined in the current analysis.
Further longitudinal immunological studies of patients recovering from COVID-19 will
likely be able to clarify this important aspect. In addition to IL-7, IL-15 is also important
in driving lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation, particularly of memory CD8+
T cells (Raeber et al., 2018). IL-15 is usually bound to the IL-15 receptor a (Dubois et
al., 2002)(Mortier et al., 2008)(Bouchaud et al., 2013), which means that serum
concentrations of soluble IL-15 are an unreliable measurement of the availability of
bioactive IL-15. However, IL-15 elevation in patients with COVID-19 has been reported
(Hadjadj et al., 2020) and could likely contribute to the increase we observed in CD8+
T cell proliferation. We did not investigate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in the current
study. Determining the frequency of virus-specific cells in each T cell compartment,
and especially in the proliferating fraction, will shed light on the mechanisms of T cell
proliferation and will assist in defining the extent of homeostatic proliferation.
Understanding the immunological mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 disease
is necessary for risk stratification and central to the development of interventional
therapies as well as protective vaccines. Our study reveals that severe COVID-19 is
associated with extensive loss of T cells, especially within the CD8+ T cell
compartment. Since the observed T cell apoptosis is closely associated with the
destructive inflammatory environment of severe COVID-19 our study highlights the
potential of anti-inflammatory therapies in possibly preventing the observed extensive
T cell loss.
