Abstract
Infections with zoonotic viruses, such as flaviviruses, influenza virus, and the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic coronavirus constitute an increasing global risk. Hence, an urgent need exists for the
development of broad-spectrum antivirals to prevent such outbreaks. Here, we show that the
maduramycin and CP-80,219 aglycone polyether ionophores exhibit effective broad-spectrum
antiviral activity, against various viruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue
virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), while also exhibiting
promising activity against PR8 influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, liposomeencapsulated maduramycin and CP-80,219 provide full protection for mice from infection with
JEV in vivo. Mechanistic studies suggest that aglycone polyether ionophores primarily inhibit
the viral replication step without blocking endosome acidiﬁcation to promote the fusion
between viral and cellular membranes. The successful application of liposomes containing
aglycone polyether ionophores in JEV-infected mice offers hope to the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs like penicillin back to 1940s.

Introduction
Recently, zoonotic viruses have caused various infectious disease outbreaks across the world,
posing a serious threat to human and animal health, For example, the current severe acute

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused over 40 million
infections and more than 1.14 million deaths1. In fact, approximately 89 % of the 180
recognized RNA viruses with the potential to harm humans are zoonotic2, and most of them are
enveloped to facilitate adaptation to different hosts. Flaviviruses as a major category of zoonotic
viruses comprise more than 70 members, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue
virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and the most recent explosive epidemic of Zika virus
(ZIKV) in the Americas. These viruses are primarily transmitted by arthropod vectors, such as
mosquitoes, midges, and sand flies and infect millions of people annually, resulting in
thousands of deaths3, 4. Flavivirus Infections present with varying symptoms, ranging from flulike illnesses and fevers to potentially lethal haemorrhagic fevers, and neurological
complications, include encephalitis, microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome5, 6.
Several antivirals and vaccines targeting flaviviruses, including the Hepatitis C (HCV)
nucleoside inhibitor sofosbuvir7, as well as vaccines for Yellow fever virus (YFV) and JEV8,
have been licensed and are commercially available in various countries, but the high mutation
rate associated with RNA viruses makes development of effective options challenging.
Specifically, RNA viruses have an inherent error-prone process that facilitates the accumulation
of mutations during genome replication. This high mutation capacity is what makes the
generation of a universal vaccine or drug for RNA viruses, a seemingly impossible task, and it
is unlikely to be adequate for 'one bug–one drug' approach to antiviral drug development.
Moreover, the strategies used for the development of vaccines and antivirals are not amenable
to emerging viruses or to the mutations of existing viruses. Hence, the development with broadspectrum antivirals is a complex, yet warranted task to address the emerging and reemerging
virus outbreaks.
Although effective treatment options for RNA viruses remain largely elusive, greater strides
have been made in the fight against bacteria, fungi, and parasites, in the form of broad-spectrum
antibiotics, such as like penicillin, candicidin and avermectin. Meanwhile, the long-term
focused research of our team, in the veterinary and poultry antibiotics industry, revealed that
microbial whole fermentation broth, which is used as the primary component of antibiotics
administered to animals and poultry, contributes to the reduced occurrence of viral infection,
compared with the use of pure antibiotics. Hence, these fermentation broths might contain
previously neglected compounds capable of eliciting antiviral activity. Therefore, in the current
study, we obtained supernatants from 13 kinds of actinomycetes, originating from current
industrial strains used in antibiotic production, and screened their antiviral activity using the
JEV platform. Results show that aglycone polyether ionophores exhibit effective antiviral
activity, with the half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) values of maduramycin and CP80,219 of 11 nM and 6 nM, respectively. In vivo studies demonstrated that liposome
encapsulation of maduramycin and CP-80,219 provided full protection of mice from JEV
infection. Moreover, mechanistically, maduramycin primarily hinders the critical steps of virus
replication cycle, not interfere with viral attachment and entry and not affect endosome
acidiﬁcation. Furthermore, we found that maduramycin and CP-80,219 also exhibit significant
antiviral activity against ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV, and PR8 influenza virus, and especially
promising active against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic coronavirus, with EC50 of 77.7 nM and
8.7 nM, respectively. These data suggest that maduramycin and CP-80,219 aglycone polyether
ionophores have the potential to prevent an organism from becoming a possible transmission

Results
Screening of fermentation products of actinomycetes for anti-JEV virus activity.
First, we fermented 13 industrial actinomycete strains collected from our lab, including two
strains producing polyethers, five strains producing macrolides, and three strains producing
aminoglycosides, one strain producing cyclic lipopeptide, one strain producing Ɛ-poly-lysine
and 1 strain producing tetracycline (Fig. 1a, more detailed information see Supplementary Table
1). In addition to these primary products, these strains are also known to produce a variety of
other natural compounds. These actinomycete strains were cultured by three different
fermentation mediums to obtain 39 supernatant samples according to strict microbial
fermentation environmental conditions, as showed in Fig 1a. We then tested the 39 supernatant
samples for their antiviral activity on the JEV platform (Fig. 1b-d), we showed that the
supernatants of J1-005 (producing Ɛ-poly-lysine) fermented in three culture mediums and the
supernatant of J1-002 fermented in A medium were high cytotoxicity for Vero cells and not
detected their antiviral activity, and other samples in medium A and C are also not able to inhibit
JEV virus replication. Surprisingly, the supernatants of two polyether-producing actinomycetes,
fermented products of which primarliy included maduramycin and salinomycin in medium B,
reduced virus production with titer approximately 3 log10 and 1 log10 compared to blank
treatment in a plaque reduction assay. These results displayed that polyether ionophores could
show promising antiviral activity.

promising activity, and the antiviral capability of maduramycin-producing industrial strain
supernatant was greater than that of salinomycin-producing strain, combinied with our previous
knowledge regarding the biological activity of aglycone polyether ionophores (including
maduramycin)9, we postulated that aglycone polyether ionophores might exert parallel antiviral
activity. Therefore, we first prepared and purified nonaglycone polyether salinomycin as well
as five aglycone polyether products, including maduramycin, A-130-A, nanchangmycin,
endusamycin and CP-80,219 from their produced actinomycetes, respectively (Fig. 2a). We
then assessed the antiviral activity and toxicity of these polyether ionophores against JEV in
Vero cells exposed to a drug dose range for 24 h. Results show that all polyether ionophores
were effective against JEV, and a cytotoxicity greater than 40 μM (Fig. 2b-2g). Moreover, CP80,219 and maduramycin were highly efficacious with an average EC50 of 5.6 nM and 10.7 nM,
respectively. These data indicate that aglycone polyether ionophores exhibit potent antiviral
activity against JEV.

in vitro, studies have shown that the dosage of polyether ionophores in animals is strictly
limited10, 11. For instance, regarding maduramycin, its maximum dosage for administration to
broiler chickens and turkeys is set to 5 mg/kg in feed12. Furthermore, following the evaluation
of other biological activities of polyether ionophores in vivo, toxic effects, including cardiac
toxicity and hepatotoxicity, were observed9, 13. Meanwhile, encapsulation of drugs in liposomes
is known to enhance the therapeutic indices of various agents, primarily through alterations in
their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics14, such as in the case of the liposome-based
paclitaxel formulation (LEP-ETU) for cancers15 and doxorubicin encapsulated in liposomes
(Doxil) for ovarian and breast cancer16. We, therefore, used maduramycin and CP-80,219 with
distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and cholesterol to form maduramycin (maduramycinlipid) and CP-80,219 liposome (CP-80,219-lipid) with an average encapsulation rate of 85%
and 89%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2), and a mean particle size of approximately 100
nm (Fig 3a). Then we investigated whether these liposomes exhibit the same antiviral activity,
while reducing cytotoxicity in vitro using Vero and BHK cells (Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c). Our results
show that the liposome formulations of maduramycin and CP-80,219 maintained the same
biological activity in the two host cells with EC50 values of up to 3-22 nM and cytotoxicity
greater than 40 μM. these results suggest that liposome encapsulation maintains the relatively
high antiviral activity of each compound, contributing to the investigation of their biological
activity in vivo.

Efﬁcacy of liposome-encapsulated maduramycin and CP-80,219 in mice.
Given the efficient in vitro antiviral activity of maduramycin-lipid and CP-80,219-lipid against
JEV, we next aimed to evaluate efficacy of these liposomes in preventing JEV infection in
C57BL/6 mice. To this end we intraperitoneal administrated vehicle (WT group, PBS), 1 mg/kg
maduramycin-lipid, or 1 mg/kg CP-80,219-lipid after intraperitoneal infection with 1×107 PFU
of mouse-adapted JEV. Subsequently vehicle or drug was administered every 24 h until the end
of the study. C57BL/6 mice treated with only maduramycin-lipid or CP-80,219-lipid exhibited
slight weight loss through the study. However, this effect was rapidly diminished following
vehicle treatment at post-stage, while mortality was observed in JEV-infected mice (Vehicle
treatment) at 6 dpi, reaching 100% at 9 dpi. Surprisingly, all ten animals treated with
maduramycin-lipid and CP-80,219-lipid formulations survived their exposure to the end of inlife phase. Furthermore, the plasma viral load in all maduramycin-lipid and CP-80,219-lipid-

treated groups compared with vehicle-treated groups was found to be significantly decreased
with geometric means reduced by ≥ 1.0 log10 (P<0.01) compared to the vehicle-treated group
at 1 dpi. Altogether, these results further demonstrate the antiviral activity of maduramycinlipid and CP-80,219-lipid formulations in an in vivo mouse model of JEV infection.

Aglycone polyether ionophores primarily inhibit the replication stage of JEV life cycle.
Studies have shown that polyether ionophores can inhibit virus replication by interfering with
the function of viruses and host cells. For example, monensin selectively blocks the secondary
glycosylation step of HIV gp160 with the reduction of syncytium formation17 and easily induces
the alkalization of intracellular organelles to inhibit the fusion between viral and cellular
membranes of the late step of HCV entry18. Meanwhile, salinomycin prevents the endosomal
acidiﬁcation of host cells and viral matrix protein, thus inhibiting influenza virus infection19.
To elucidate the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of aglycone polyether ionophores,
Vero cells were treated with 10 M maduramycin for 1 h or 1 M maduramycin for 24 h, then
acridine orange was used to stain the intracellular vesicles to monitor changes in the pH.
Consequently, red ﬂuorescence (representing acidic condition) was observed in the cytoplasm

of cells exposed to maduramycin (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that aglycone polyether
ionophore may not cause cytoplasmic alkalization to block the fusion of viral and cellular
membranes.
Next, we explored the effects of aglycone polyether ionophores on viral life cycles. First, we
investigated the virucidal activity in depth using time of addition of maduramycin in a plaque
assay (Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B). Host cells pretreated maduramycin for 1 h did not inhibit virus
replication, and virus titer was not reduced at 1 hpi (hour post-infection). Meanwhile, when
host cells are pretreated for 1 h, followed by treatement with the drug for 12 hpi (-1-12), we
observed that the viral titer of supernatant nearly was undetectable. A similar result was detected
following treatment for cells with the drug for 12 hpi (0-12), without pretreatment. During
different periods of drug incubation with 11 h (1-12), 10 h (2-12), 8 h (4-12) and 4 h (8-12),
maduramycin substantially reduced virus titer reduction greater than 3 log10 values. Even after
10 h of infection and treated with maduramycin for 2 hpi, the supernatant viral titer was
decreased rapidly (>1.5 log10). These data suggest that treatment with maduramycin can
significantly inhibit JEV release from host cell. Finally, cells were infected JEV at an MOI
(multiple of infection) of 1 for 2 h in the presence of maduramycin or DMSO. At 2 hpi, cells
were rinsed, and total RNA was isolated from parallel wells, and Q-PCR analysis was
performed. We did not detect any significant alteration in total RNA between treated and
untreated cells (Fig. 5c). This finding demonstrates that maduramycin not interfere with the
attachment or entry cycle of JEV into the cells.
Subsequently, we analyzed whether maduramycin acts on virus replication process. Cells
were infected JEV at a high MOI of 10 and incubated with maduramycin or DMSO for 1 h or
12 h at 37 °C, we then detected JEV genome RNA copies and observed a highly significant
effect (P=0.0075) between the maduramycin and DMSO groups (Fig.5D), indicating that
maduramycin could affect virus replication. Furthermore, we used JEV-Rluc-replicon cell line
and found administration of maduramycin decreased JEV-Rluc-replicon replication in doseand time-dependent manner (Fig.5e). Consistently, we also observed a dose-dependent
reduction in the levels of JEV viral capsid protein when cells were infected JEV with different
concentration maduramycin (Fig.5f).

Maduramycin and CP-80,219 ionophores exert broad-spectrum antiviral activity
including the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

Early studies have shown that a variety of polyether ionophores exhibit biological activity
against HIV virus20. Subsequently, nanchangmycin has been reported to exert broad-spectrum
antiviral effects, including against flaviviruses, by inhibiting the invasion of viruses, suggesting
that polyether ionophores might have potential antiviral activity as broad-spectrum reagents21.
To determine whether maduramycin and CP-80,219 also exert broad inhibition of viral
replication, we investigated their biological activity against enveloped viruses using a plaque
assay (Fig. 6). Accordingly, both the maduramycin and CP-80,219 ionophores were shown to
efficiently inhibit the replication of these virus pathogens, including ZIKV, DENV and
Chikungunya (CHIKV) (Fig 6a), with maduramycin exhibiting a nanomolar level activity
against DENV and CHIKV. Both of aglycone polyether ionophores targeting against PR8
influenza virus exhibited promising inhibitory and low cytotoxicity (Fig. 6b). In addition,
maduramycin and CP-80,219 ionophores were effective against the epidemic SARS-CoV-2,
with EC50 of 70 nM and 9 nM, respectively (Fig. 6c), which are more efﬁcient than the currently
reported remdesivir (EC50=0.77 μM) and chloroquine (EC50=1.13 μM) 22, 23. We have, therefore,
further explored the antiviral efficacy of aglycone polyether ionophores against a broadspectrum of viruses.

Discussion
Polyether ionophores, a very important class of natural products produced exclusively by
actinomycetes, have the ability to selectively chelate metal ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+) and transport
them across cell membranes to control coccidiosis24. These molecules, including maduramycin,
monensin and salinomycin, are used as effective veterinary medicines and food additives in
animal husbandry25, 26, 27. Recently, polyether ionophores have been shown to exert a broadspectrum of bioactivity, including antiviral properties28, 29, 30, 31, 32. Here, we found that
maduramycin and CP-80,219 aglycone polyether ionophores exhibit effective broad-spectrum
antiviral activity for enveloped viruses, including JEV, ZIKV, DENV, CHIKV, and were also
shown to exert promising active against influenza virus PR8 and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
coronavirus.
Many enveloped viruses enter cells via membrane fusion driven by low pH-induced
conformational changes of specific viral proteins33, 34, 35. Studies have shown that monensin can
affect glycosylation and transport of HIV envelope glycoproteins17 and alter vRNA trafficking36.
In addition, monensin inhibits HCV entry by acting on endosome acidiﬁcation18, similar to the
mechanism of salinomycin against inﬂuenza virus19. Meanwhile, in the current study, we found
that maduramycin did not decrease the pH value of cells (Supplementary Fig. 1), this indicated
that aglycone polyether ionophore may not inhibit the fusion between enveloped viruses and
cellular membranes by inducing alkalization of cells. Subsequently, cells are incubated
maduramycin and JEV for 2 h, no difference was observed in the viral load of treated or
untreated cells, further indicating that virus attachment and cell entry were not inhibited by
maduramycin, a finding that was not in accordance with the results obtained for nanchangmycin,
which was shown to impair cell entry of ZIKV21.
However, the virus titer in the supernatant was significantly reduced following addition of
maduramycin after virus infection, suggesting that it might affect replication, assembly, or
release of JEV. To confirm our hypothesis, we examined the viral nucleic acid load in cells
treated with maduramycin and found that it was remarkably reduced after 12 h compared with
the untreated group (Fig. 5d), Further, We found that maduramycin inhibited viral replication
in the JEV replicon cell line in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5e),
suggesting that aglycone polyether ionophores primarily interfere with JEV replication cycle.
However, no inhibition was observed in the assembly and release model after exposure to
maduramycin (Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that aglycone
polyether ionophores elicit antivral effects against inhibit enveloped viruses via inhibition of a
critical replication step in the replication cycle.
Moreover, considering that oral administration of salinomycin reportedly has no inhibitory
effect on influenza virus, but rather induces potential toxicity and side effects19. We nest sought
to further investigate the antiviral effects of maduramycin and CP-80,219 in vivo. To this end,
we prepared liposome formulations based on the liposolubility of maduramycin and CP-80,219.
Accordingly, we observed that their liposomes formulations were effective against JEV in vitro,
and when administered in vivo, both maduramycin and CP-80,219 liposomes provided full
protection of mice from JEV infection. In fact, virus titers in the blood were significantly
decreased after 24 h of the first treatment (Fig. 4c). These data demonstrate that aglycone

polyether ionophores encapsulated in liposomes have promising antiviral activity in mammals
and may provide an effective strategy for other viruses that are currently epidemic in poultry,
such as avian influenza viruses H1N1 and H7N9, as well as JEV and swine flu virus in pigs
Drugs that are currently in use have great potential for being developed into antiviral drugs used
in poultry and animal husbandry, which is important to avoid becoming a possible transmission
or storage host and block the transmission between humans and animals.
In summary, we successfully demonstrated the antiviral activity of aglycone polyether
ionophores in JEV-infected mice. Although, the diversity of viruses, and their associated
pathogenic mechanisms, can affect the development of antiviral drugs, aglycone polyether
ionophores are capable of exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity, and probably target the
functions of host cells to inhibit virus replication. However, further research is needed,
particularly in elucidating the underlying mechanism of action, to facilitate the development of
polyether ionophores into efficient antiviral drugs. Importantly, polyether ionophores can
readily achieve very high yields to meet an increased demand, and their preparation has a low
associated cost. For example, the yield of maduramicin titer can reach 7.16 g/L in shake-flask
fermentation37. In short, the application of maduramycin and CP-80,219 aglycone polyether
ionophores against JEV provides new insights for the development of antiviral drugs used in
the poultry and animal husbandry industry, and brings hope for the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs.

chloride, 0.2 % potassium chloride, 0.5 % ammonium sulfate, 0.02 % dipotassium hydrogen
phosphate, 0.01 % magnesium sulfate, 0.01 % calcium chloride, 0.5 % calcium carbonate) for
7 days at 30 °C and 220 rpm.
The preparation of four polyethers (A-130-A, CP-80,219, maduramycin and edusamycin)
were referred in our previous studies9, 37, 41. These compounds were puriﬁed using preparative
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, maduramycin was prepared by
recrystallization. Nanchangmycin and salinomycin have been prepared and reported by our
lab42, 43. All drugs were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) to make a 10 mM stock solution.
Aglycone polyethers liposome preparation.
The liposome was charged with a bilayer composed of Soybean and cholesterol at 4:1 weight
ratio, then mixed in the organic solvent and evaporated using a dry nitrogen or rotary
evaporation, and dissolve with aqueous dispersion (25 mL contains 2125 mg sucrose, 94 mg
glycine and 7 mg calcium chloride dihydrate). The crude liposome disrupts using sonic energy
(sonication), and then liposome extrusion is forced through a polycarbonate filter with a defined
pore size to yield particles, average size of particles is measured by Malvern DSL.
Antiviral activity assays of polyethers or supernatants.
RT-PCR Assay. The cytotoxicity of the tested drugs on Vero E6 was determined by CCK8
assays (Beyotime, China). To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of these drugs, Vero E6 cells were
cultured overnight in 48-well cell-culture petri dish with a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells
were pre-treated with the different doses of the indicated antivirals for 1 h, and the virus (MOI
of 0.05) was subsequently added to allow infection for 2 h. Then, the virus-drug mixture was
removed and cells were further cultured with fresh drug-containing medium. At 48 hpi, the cell
supernatant was collected and lysed in lysis buffer (Takara, Cat no. 9766) for further
quantification analysis. One hundred microliter cell culture supernatant was harvested for viral
RNA extraction using the MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (Takara, Cat no. 9766)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted in 30 μL RNase-free water.
Reverse transcription was performed with a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser
(Takara, Cat no. RR047A) and qRT-PCR was performed on StepOne Plus Real-time PCR
system (Applied Biosystem) with TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Cat no. RR820A). Briefly,
3 μL total RNA was first digested with gDNA eraser to remove contaminated DNA and then
the first-strand cDNA was synthesized in 20 μL reaction and 2 μL cDNA was used as template
for quantitative PCR.
Cytotoxicity assay.
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells per well) and allowed to grow for 16 h
before treatments. Afterward, compounds at concentrations in a 2-fold dilution series were
added to the cell. At 36 h, the cells were incubated with 10 μL CCK8 reagent (cell counting kit8, Bimake) for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorbance at 450 nm was read by a Microplate Reader
(Varioskan Flash, Thermo Fisher). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the treated
cells to the control (untreated) cells. For each compound concentration, six wells were
performed in parallel, mean values of the cell viability were calculated. The CC50 was
calculated by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software to determine the
cytotoxic concentration at which 50 % of the cells are viable.

Single-layer plaque assay.
BHK-21 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well one day
before plaque assay. A series of 1:10 dilutions were made by mixing 15 µL of virus sample with
135 µL of DMEM. Then, 100 µL of each dilution were added to individual wells of 24-well
plates containing confluent BHK-21 cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO₂
for 1 h before the layer of 2 % methyl cellulose was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C
with 5 % CO₂, the cells were fixed with 3.7 % formaldehyde and then stained with 1 % crystal
violet. Plaque morphology and numbers were recorded after washing the plates with tap water.
Times of addition assay.
In this experiment, a monolayer of Vero cells was grown in 12-well plate in DMEM
containing 2% inactivated FBS. The wells were designated as −1, 0,1, 2, 4, 8,10-h, that they are
named according to the time of JEV-WT (MOI = 10) infection. As for −1 h, Vero cells were
treated with marduramycin (500 nM). The plate was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 %
CO2. At the 0 h, all wells except the control wells were infected with JEV and again incubated
for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 % CO2. After 1 h, the infected cells were washed thrice with PBS, and
then 1 mL fresh medium was added to each well, and marduramycin (500 nM) were added to
1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 8 h wells respectively. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C with 5 % CO2 for
12 h. The viral titer was detected as described above plaque assay.
Western blot analysis.
Equal amounts of WT and mutant NS4A–NS4B-FLAG expression plasmids were mocktransfected or co-transfected with NS2B-3 pro-expression plasmid into 293T cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. At 12 h p.t, cells were lysed with 200 mL lysis buffer
containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 % n-dodecyl b-D-maltoside (Sigma) and
EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 17000 g for 20
min, and the supernatants were collected and heated at 75 °C for 10 min. Samples were
separated using 15 % SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore),
followed by blocking with 5 % skim milk (Bio-Rad) in TBST buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl and 0.1 % Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. Following blocking,
membranes were subject to sequential incubation with anti-FLAG mouse antibody (1: 2000
dilution) and secondary anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP (Bio-Rad). After washing three
times with TBST buffer, the signals were detected with a chemiluminescence system
(ChemiDoc; Bio-Rad).
In vivo experiments.
We performed mouse studies to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of maduramycin and CP-80,219.
Female sex C57BL/6 mice, 3–4 weeks old, were kept in biosafety level 2 laboratory and given
access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum. All experimental protocols followed the
standard operating procedures of the approved biosafety level 2 animal facilities. JEV infection
in C57BL/6 mice (n = 5/dose group) by subcutaneously inoculated with 1 × 107 PFU in 200 μL
PBS. After infection 30 min, Vehicle or liposomes (1 mg/kg) are administered intraperitoneally
daily, and the weight was measured daily from 0 to 14 days post infection (dpi). Survival and
general conditions were monitored for 14 days or until death. Blood was collected daily from
1 to 3 dpi to track for viral titration via plaque assay. All animal experiments were performed
according to protocols and ethical guidelines approved by Center for Animal Experiment and
BSL-3 laboratory at Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Real time RT-PCR.
To detect the copy number of RNA replication in cells, total cellular RNA was isolated using
the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and subjected to SYBR green one-step real-time RTPCR as described previously44. The copy number of replicons was calculated by interpolating
in a standard curve made by a quantified JEV replicon plasmid44.
For inhibitory assay of SARS-CoV-2, RNA was extracted from 140 μL cell supernatant using
QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (52906, Qiagen) following the manufacturer protocol. QRT-PCR
were performed using Luna® Universal Probe One-Step RT-PCR Kit (E3006). Average values
from duplicates of each gene were used to calculate the viral genomic copies. RBD-qF1: 5’CAATGGTTTAACAGGCACAGG-3’; RBD-qR1: 5’- CTCAAGTGTCTGTGGATCACG-3’;
Probe: ACAGCATCAGTAGTGTCAGCAATGTCTC.
Western blot analysis.
Cells were lysed with 200 µL of lysis buffer containing 1 % Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH=8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM PMSF on ice for 10 min. Following boiling
at 95 °C for 10 min, cell lysates were separated by 10 % SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were
then electro-transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (0.2 µm; Millipore).
After blocked with 5 % skim milk in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 % Tween 20,
Ph=7.4) for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were then incubated with primary
antibodies at room temperature for another 1 h. After washing three times with TBST, the
membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-rabbit or
mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing three
times with TBST. The protein bands were visualized with a chemiluminescent detection reagent
(Millipore).
Statistical analysis
All statistical data analyses were performed in Graphpad Prism 8. Statistical significance for
each endpoint was determined with specific statistical tests. In general, for metrics with
multiple treatment groups with longitudinal data (e.g., mouse weight loss or pulmonary
function over time), two-way ANOVA was performed with the suggested multiple comparison
test as advised by Prism. For comparative data with for a single timepoint (e.g., lung titer)
Kruskal-Wallis or one-way ANOVA was performed with the suggested multiple comparison
test. For each test, a p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Specific tests are noted in each
figure legend.
