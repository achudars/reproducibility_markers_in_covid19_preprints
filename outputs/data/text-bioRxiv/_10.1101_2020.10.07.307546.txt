Abstract
During the COVID-19 pandemic, structural biologists rushed to solve the structures of the 28 proteins encoded by
the SARS-CoV-2 genome in order to understand the viral life cycle and enable structure-based drug design. In
addition to the 204 previously solved structures from SARS-CoV-1, 548 structures covering 16 of the SARS-CoV-2 viral
proteins have been released in a span of only 6 months. These structural models serve as the basis for research to
understand how the virus hijacks human cells, for structure-based drug design, and to aid in the development of
vaccines. However, errors often occur in even the most careful structure determination - and may be even more
common among these structures, which were solved quickly and under immense pressure.
The Coronavirus Structural Task Force has responded to this challenge by rapidly categorizing, evaluating and
reviewing all of these experimental protein structures in order to help downstream users and original authors. In
addition, the Task Force provided improved models for key structures online, which have been used by
Folding@Home, OpenPandemics, the EU JEDI COVID-19 challenge and others.

Introduction
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded RNA genome encoding 28 proteins. These enable SARS-CoV-2 to
infect, replicate, and suppress the immune system of its host. For example, the characteristic spikes that protrude
from its envelope and allow it to bind to host cells are a trimer of the surface glycoprotein (Fig. 1). Knowing the
atomic structures of these macromolecules is vital for understanding the life cycle of the virus and helping design
specific pharmaceutical compounds that can inhibit their functions, with the goal of stopping the cycle of infection.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in the beginning of this year the structural biology community swung into action
very efficiently and is now strongly engaged to determine the atomic structures of the viral macromolecules as fast
as possible1. All structure determination methods require interpretation of the measured and processed data with a
structural model and cannot be fully automated. The resulting structures are freely and publicly available in the
World Wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), structural biology’s archive of record2.
Unfortunately, the fit between model and data is never perfect, and errors from measurement, post-processing and
modelling are a given. Structures solved in a hurry to address a pressing medical and societal need may be even
more prone to mistakes. These small faults can have severe consequences – in particular, in structure-based drug
discovery, structural bioinformatics, and computational chemistry; all of which are being employed in current SARSCoV-2 research across the world. As of the writing of this publication, 524 macromolecular structures from SARSCoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been deposited, covering parts of 16 of the 28 viral proteins. In this time of crisis, it is
vital to ensure that the structural data made available to the wider research community are the best they can be in
every regard.

Pushing the methods to the limit

Fig. 1. SARS-CoV-2 displays spike proteins (green) on its surface that recognize and bind to host cells; its lipid bilayer membrane also contains
additional embedded membrane and envelope proteins (yellow and beige, respectively). The single-stranded RNA (orange) is intertwined in a
helical fashion with the nucleocapsid (grey).
This figure only shows only the transport form of the virus: once a cell is infected, additional viral proteins encoded by the viral RNA are
produced that hijack the host cell in order to produce new virus particles. (Picture: Thomas Splettstößer /scistyle.com)

The wwPDB3 is an invaluable tool, but it is a near-static archive, where a released structure can only be updated by
the original depositors. After any associated papers are published, there is often little or no motivation to make
corrections.99% of structure downloads from the PDB are not by those who determine the structures, but scientists
from other fields2. Consequently, errors can be misinterpreted as biologically and pharmaceutically relevant
information and can cause a large waste of resources and time down-the-line.
As methods developers for structure determination and validation, we are expert users of our own software tools
and are ideally placed to help in this unprecedented situation. We joined forces to assess and, where necessary,
improve upon the published macromolecular structures from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. In cases where we could
significantly improve the molecular models, we offered them back to the original authors and the scientific
community. After we began this validation effort we were approached by researchers in in-silico drug screening,
Folding@Home4,5, OpenPandemics6, and the EU Joint European Disruptive Initiative (JEDI)7. These initiatives needed
the best structures they could get for studies of the virus and had already lost much computing time and resources
working with suboptimal models.

Automatic evaluation
All macromolecular structures from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in the wwPDB are downloaded into our repository
and assessed automatically in the first 24 hours after release. For crystallographic and Cryo-EM structures, we check
the quality of the deposited merged data, and how well the model fits these data. All structures are checked
according to chemical prior knowledge.

Evaluation specific to crystallographic data and structure solutions
As crystal structures make up 73% of reported SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 structures, these are evaluated most
thoroughly for pathologies such as twinning, multiple lattice diffraction, ice crystal diffraction contamination,
incompleteness resulting from a poorly chosen collection strategy, limited diffraction (at low and high resolution
boundaries) or radiation-induced damage which renders some reflections inaccurate. These issues cannot be
resolved after data collection is complete, but explicitly taking them into account during data processing and

structure solution can yield a better structural model. However, finding such problems from deposited structure
factors can be difficult. Raw data allow a much more complete analysis of the experiment, including anisotropic
diffraction limits, systematic errors from the measurement setup or strategy, as well as errors arising from data
processing such as incorrect lattice symmetry or inclusion of diffraction spots obscured by the beam stop. If raw data
are available, data can be re-processed, and these problems may be resolved. However, raw data are not deposited
in the wwPDB, or required for publication, and can be difficult to obtain. Their absence in the public record is
detrimental for re-analysis and evaluation. To support evaluation of the entire structure determination from start-tofinish, we invited authors to send us their raw experimental data and offered to deposit them in a public repository,
such as SBGrid8 or proteindiffraction.org9.
To analyse crystallographic data for twinning, completeness, and overall diffraction quality, we used phenix.xtriage10;
to identify ice rings and additional pathologies, we used AUSPEX11 (see Fig. 2F). The overall completeness of most
datasets is satisfactory, with only 7 out of 547 datasets below 80%. All data sets have an acceptable signal-to-noise.
Ice rings were detected in 61 datasets and problems with the beam stop masking in 54; 41 crystal structures were
indicated as potentially resulting from twinned crystals.
A general indication of how well the atomic model fits the measurement data can be obtained from the R factors:
While only two structures in the repository present an alarmingly high Rfree value, above 35%, this does not indicate
the absence of modelling problems in the others. We supply PDB-REDO12 re-refinements which generally improve
Rfree, but the resulting models should not be viewed as “more correct” purely on basis of a lower R value, particularly
at lower resolution where the relationship between R factors and model quality breaks down13. Critical inspection of
the model details in the density remains necessary (while being cautious to avoid expectation and model bias). Large
Rfree drops indicated major issues with the deposited PDB entry; this was especially true for older SARS-CoV-1
structures.

Evaluation specific to structures from single-particle Cryo-EM
Cryo-EM structures make up 23% of reported SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 structures. As with crystallographic
structures, raw data are not available from the wwPDB, but deposition into EMPIAR14 is increasingly common. The
reconstructed 3D map deposited in the EMDB15 allows calculation of the fit between model and map in the form of a
Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) to assess agreement between features at different resolutions. For a well-fitted
model, the cryo-EM map resolution (defined as where the FSC between two independently calculated half-maps
drops below 0.143) roughly corresponds to a model-map FSC of 0.5. To calculate FSCs, we utilized the CCP-EM16
model validation task which uses REFMAC517 and additionally calculates real-space Cross-Correlation Coefficient
(CCC), Mutual Information (MI) and Segment Manders’ Overlap Coefficient (SMOC)18. While MI is a single value score
to evaluate how well model and map agree, the SMOC score evaluates the fit of each modelled residue individually
and can help to find regions where errors occur in the model in relation to the map. Z-scores highlight residues with
a low score relative to their neighbors and point to potential misfits.
Of 120 structures, 20 structures had an average model-map FSC below 0.4 and 21 had a MI score below 0.4,
indicating poor overall agreement between map and model, and potential for further improvement. The SMOC score
of 28 structures indicated that more than 10% of the residues fit poorly with the map. These models could
potentially be improved to better fit the map reconstructed from the experimental data. In addition to the above
validation, we run Haruspex19, a neural network trained to recognize secondary structure elements and RNA/DNA in
Cryo-EM maps, as visual guidance for structure evaluation.

Evaluation of the structural models based on prior knowledge
In order to evaluate the model quality with respect to chemical prior knowledge we run MolProbity20,21, which
checks covalent geometry, conformational parameters of protein and RNA, and steric clashes. However, some of
these traditional indicators of model quality are often used as additional restraints during refinement, which
invalidates their use as quality metrics to a certain degree – we therefore used the MolProbity CaBLAM score22,
which can pinpoint local errors at 3-4 Å resolution, even if traditional criteria have been used as restraints during
refinement. CaBLAM indicated that 131 of the structures have many uncommon local backbone conformations (> 2%
outliers); sometimes this was already evident from Ramachandran plots (see Fig. 2G). During the Corona crisis the

MolProbity webservice has been pushed to the limit of its capacity, as many different drug developers screen the
same coronavirus structures many times.
We developed a custom MolProbity pipeline which makes the validation results for each coronavirus structure
available online to decrease the workload on the webservice. In addition to this, the sequence of each structure is
checked against the known genome; this highlighted misidentified residues in 23 structures. Modelling errors in
general can be corrected, but mostly need manual intervention (see below).

Online availability and updates
Every Wednesday, when new PDB structures are released, our automatic pipeline identifies new coronavirus
structures and assesses the quality of both models and experimental results. This assessment, along with the original
structures, are then immediately made available from our online repository which is accessible via our website
insidecorona.net. To facilitate access and provide an overview of structures, we supply a summary, an SQL database
of key statistics and quality indicators, as well as the individual results.

Manual evaluation
The structural biology community has achieved a high level of automation in recent years. However, due to the
complexity of interpreting low-quality maps that have poor fit between experimental data and structural models,
the process of structure-solution still requires guidance and interpretation by researchers, as it has not yet been fully
automated. Experienced human inspection residue-by-residue remains the best way to judge the quality of a
structure, highlighting the continuing need for expert structure solvers. Given the flood of new SARS-CoV-2
structures, we have selected representative structures from each SARS-CoV-2 protein as well as those of particular
interest as reference structures in drug development. Certain errors were surprisingly common, such as peptide
bond flips (see Fig 2, B1 and B2), rotamer outliers, occupancy problems (see Fig. 2C) and mis-identification of small
molecules/ions, such as water as magnesium, chloride as zinc. Zinc plays an important role in many viral infections,
and is coordinated by many of the SARS-CoV-2 protein structures. We found a large number of Cys-Zn sites to be
mismodelled, with the zinc ion missing or pushed out of density, and/or erroneous disulphide bonds between the
coordinating cysteine residues (see Fig 2A1, A2, E). Many coronavirus proteins are glycosylated at surface asparagine
residues. In many structures containing glycans the sugars were flipped approximately 180 degrees from their
correct orientation around the N-glycosidic bond (see Fig. 2, D1 and D2). This could be avoided using tools such as
Privateer23 and the automated carbohydrate building tool in Coot24.
Undeniably, deviation from prior knowledge is not universally an error. If the experimental data strongly support this
deviation, it may not only be acceptable but can be an important and functionally relevant feature, as exemplified by
the strained geometries often found at catalytic sites.

Of the structures we checked manually, we were able to significantly improve 31 (available from insidecorona.net) in
terms of model quality, data quality, or both. Here we give two examples to illustrate the importance of careful
inspection of experimental data and resulting models.

Example 1: Papain-like protease
Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, a long polypeptide chain is produced and then cleaved into 16 functional proteins, the
non-structural proteins (NSPs)25 which are essential for replication of the virus. NSP3 is a large protein consisting of
1945 amino acid residues in 15 segments with a variety of functions. One of these is the papain-like protease domain
which cleaves the first five NSPs from the polypeptide chain25 in an essential step for viral replication, making it an
important drug target26.
The first SARS-CoV-2 structure of this domain (PDB 6W9C) was released 1st April 2020 and was immediately used in
drug design efforts around the world. The overall completeness of the measured data, however, was only 57%. Why
were all of the data not recorded?

Examination of the raw data, available from proteindiffraction.org9, revealed that the data had been measured with
a very high X-ray intensity, leading to a rapid loss of higher resolution data due to radiation damage. This is not
possible to deduce from the information deposited in the PDB, underlining the importance of the availability of raw
data. The crystals were small thin plates; thus, dose distribution is crucial in order to achieve a serviceable
experimental dataset. We estimated the diffraction weighted average dose applied to this crystal is 5.5MGy, an
acceptable albeit high value. However, the maximum applied dose is estimated as 21MGy, which surely would have
destroyed part of the crystal27. A second issue apparent from the raw data is that the data were collected with a 30°
sample rotation followed by a 60° rotation starting from the same position, covering the first 30° twice. This
increased the damage while yielding little additional information. The angular range per image of 0.5°, was also
surprisingly wide for a pixel array detector.
The crystal has 3-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) with the monomers containing a functionally important
zinc ion bound by four cysteines. The Zn-sites have poor density, which may be the result of radiation damage, and
the 3 subunits have differing and incomplete Zn-site models. Only two monomers have zinc ions modelled, but the
bond lengths between the four sulphur atoms and the zinc vary from 2.4 Å to 2.7 Å and the Cß-SG-Zn angles between
70° and 132°.The bond lengths between Cys and Zn should in fact be approximately 2.3 Å and the angles about
107°28. The third site is modelled as a disulphide bond and two free cysteines (Fig. 2).
We reprocessed the images using XDS29, omitting the final 10° of the first sweep and final 20° of the second where
the radiation damage most severely affected the data. Staraniso30 was used to apply an anisotropic data cutoff. This
careful manual intervention improved the resolution from 2.7 to 2.6 Å with better data quality overall, however, the
revised overall ellipsoidal completeness was only 44.5%. The deposited model did have one of the zinc sites
modelled as a disulphide bond. The other two lateral zinc sites had been refined without restraints to coordination
geometry, resulting in varying S-Zn bond distances and instead of the expected 107° values. Adding zincs to all sites,
restraining the bond lengths and angles to the expected values, using NCS restraints and an overall higher weighting
of ideal geometry, and some remodeling of side chains and water molecules improved the electron density maps
and lowered the R values by 4% to 20.2%/25.4% at 2.6 Å resolution.
This example shows the interconnected importance of data collection strategy, data processing and model building.
Even though the crystal was radiation damaged, by reprocessing the data, modifying refinement to include stronger
restraints, and taking full advantage of the non-crystallographic symmetry, this structure could be drastically
improved. A structure of the C111S mutant of the same protein (PDB 6WRH) came out a month later, in which the
zinc sites were clearly resolved in all subunits. By this time, however, 6W9C had already been widely used in in silico
drug design: for example, 20% of participants in the EU JEDI COVID-19 challenge have used this model. The
availability of a better structure a month earlier would not only have increased their chances of success but also
saved much computing and person hours in computer aided drug development.

Example 2: RNA polymerase complex
SARS-CoV-2 replicates its single-stranded RNA genome with a macromolecular complex of RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (NSP12, RdRp), NSP7 and NSP831. The first structure of SARS-CoV-1 RNA polymerase (PDB 6NUS) was
solved in 2019 by Cryo-EM. In this structure, a loop close to the C-terminus (residues 892-906) was not resolved in
the reconstruction map and hence not modelled. Following this loop, the polymerase has an irregular helix followed
by a flexible tail. Density for this helix was poorly resolved, and its short length and lack of information from the
surrounding loops led to difficulty in assigning the identity of the amino acids at each site. Nevertheless, the overall
validation statistics provided by the wwPDB for this model appear to be exceptionally good. We inspected one of the
first available EM structures of the equivalent SARS-CoV-2 complex (7BTF) using ISOLDE13. To our surprise, the higher
resolution in the C-terminal region made it clear that the C-terminal helix model was completely incorrect, with the
assigned sequence in fact being nine residues upstream of the correct residues for this site (see Fig.3). This error was
present in all the structures of this complex from both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, propagated due to the standard
practice of using the previous (incorrect) model as a starting point for each subsequent structure. For each affected
structure we immediately contacted the original authors. 14 of the 18 RNA polymerase complexes in the wwPDB
now have the corrected sequence alignment at the C-terminus, and also include many of our other changes

described below. These PDB re-versioned corrections allow modelling efforts for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 RNA
polymerase to start from a much better model. Notably, the authors of a later cryo-EM structure of the RNA
polymerase/RNA complex (PDB entry 6YYT) used one of our corrected models as the starting point for their new
model32.

The structure of SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in pre-translocation state and bound to template-primer RNA and
Remdesivir (PDB entry 7BV233) represents a useful basis for the rational design of other nucleoside triphosphate
(NTP) analogues34. However, we found that this structure has several issues in addition to the register shift described
above, which may mislead downstream users. Of greatest concern for subsequent in-silico docking and drug design
studies is that the three magnesium ions and pyrophosphate modelled in the active site are poorly supported by the
experimental data and by local geometry. We rebuilt this structure, correcting the residue shift, deleting the active
site magnesium ions and pyrophosphate (replacing one magnesium with a more chemically sensible water), and
improving the conformations of three RNA residues close to the Remdesivir binding site (including an adenosine
base (T18) modelled “backwards”). We also fixed a number of peptides (see Fig 1, B1 and B2), added several residues
and water molecules with good density and geometry, and altered two proline residues that had been erroneously
flipped from cis to trans. Further methodological detail for this and other examples is available in press35.
Interestingly, by the standard wwPDB metrics (clashscore, Ramachandran and rotamer outliers) the new model is
almost indistinguishable from the old – an object lesson in the importance of human “sanity-checking” of models
prior to final deposition. It should be noted, however, that most of the backwards peptide bonds and erroneous
trans prolines were detected by the Molprobity CaBLAM22 feature. Our remodelled structure offers a valuable basis
for future studies, such as in-silico docking and drug design targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp36, as well as for
computational modelling and simulation to investigate the molecular mechanism of viral replication34,37,38.

Supplying context
Many specialists in structural biology and in silico design are tackling SARS-CoV-2 research, but lack familiarity with
wider coronavirus research. In addition to structure evaluation and improvement, our homepage insidecorona.net
supplies literature reviews centered on the structural aspects of the viral life cycle, host interaction partners,
illustrations, and selecting the best starting models for in silico projects. Furthermore, we added SARS-CoV-2
proteins to Proteopedia39 and MolSSI40,41, as well as a 3D-Bionotes22 deep-link into our database. Finally, as SARSCoV-2 has had a large impact on the whole world, we have tried to make related research accessible to the general
public. We have a number of posts aimed at non-scientists, have live streamed data processing on Twitch, and
produced an accurate 3D printed model of SARS-CoV-2 based on deposited structures along with the files and
instructions necessary to print these models for outreach activities.

Summary
In the last five months, we have done a weekly automatic post-analysis as well as a manual re-processing and remodelling of representative structures from each of the 16 structurally known macromolecules of SARS-CoV-1 or
SARS-CoV-2. In this global crisis, where the community aims to get structures out as fast as possible, we aim to
ensure that structure interpretations available to downstream users are as reliable as possible. We provide these
results as a free resource to the community in order to aid the hunt for a vaccine or anti-viral treatment. Our results
are constantly updated and can be found online at insidecorona.net. New contributors to this effort are very
welcome.

Outlook
In the last 40 years, structural biology has become highly automated, and methods have advanced to the point that
it is now feasible to solve a new structure from start to finish in a matter of weeks with little specialist knowledge.
The extremely rapid and timely solution of these structures is a remarkable achievement during this crisis and,
despite some shortcomings, these structures have enabled downstream work on therapeutics to rapidly progress.
The downside is that errors at all points during a structure determination are not only common, but can also remain
undetected. Unfortunately, no individual researcher is fully conversant with all the details of structure
determination, protein and nucleic acid structure, chemical properties of interacting groups, catalytic mechanisms,
and viral life cycle. The result is that the first draft of a molecular model often contains errors like the ones pointed
out above. While any molecular model could benefit from an examination by multiple experts, during this time it is
important to bring such inspection to Coronavirus-related structures as quickly as possible. Raw data would allow a
more complete inspection of the structure solution and a possibility to propose updates to the original authors
directly, or to deposit derivative models in the wwPDB that may enhance the usefulness of these structures later.
We believe that, as a community, we need to change how we all see, address and document errors in structures to
achieve the best possible structures from our experiments. We are scientists: In the end, truth should always win.
