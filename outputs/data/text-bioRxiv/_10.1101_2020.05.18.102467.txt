Abstract. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic. A major virulence factor of
SARS-CoVs is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) which suppresses host gene expression by ribosome association
via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 binds to 40S and 80S ribosomes,
resulting in shutdown of capped mRNA translation both in vitro and in cells. Structural analysis by cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) of in vitro reconstituted Nsp1-40S and of native human Nsp1-ribosome complexes revealed
that the Nsp1 C-terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks RIG-Idependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection. Thus, the structural
characterization of the inhibitory mechanism of Nsp1 may aid structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded viruses
with a positive-sense RNA genome, which infect a large variety
of vertebrate animal species. Currently, seven CoV species from
two genera (alpha and beta) are known human pathogens, four
of which usually cause only mild respiratory diseases like
common colds (1-5). Over the last two decades, however, three
Betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs) – the severe acute respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – have
emerged as the causative agents of epidemic and in the case of
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreaks of highly pathogenic
respiratory diseases, which affect millions of people with a death
toll amounting to hundreds of thousands worldwide (6, 7).
Coronavirus particles contain a single, 5’-capped and 3’poly-adenylated RNA genome, which codes for two large
overlapping open reading frames in gene 1 (ORF1a and ORF1b),
as well as a variety of structural and nonstructural proteins at the
3’ end (8, 9). Following host infection, precursor proteins 1a and
1ab are translated and subsequently proteolytically cleaved into
functional proteins, most of which play roles during viral
replication (10). Amongst them is the N-terminal nonstructural
protein 1 (Nsp1). Despite differences in protein size and mode of
action, Nsp1 from alpha- and beta-CoVs display a similar
biological function in suppressing host gene expression (11-14).
SARS-CoV Nsp1 has been shown to induce a near-complete
shutdown of host protein translation by a two-pronged strategy:
first, it is able to bind the small ribosomal subunit and stall
canonical mRNA translation at various stages during initiation
(15, 16). Second, Nsp1 binding to the ribosome leads to templatedependent endonucleolytic cleavage and subsequent degradation
of host mRNAs. Notably, shutdown of viral protein expression is
circumvented via interactions between Nsp1 and a conserved

region in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of viral mRNA
through an unknown mechanism (17). Taken together, Nsp1
prevents all cellular anti-viral defense mechanisms that depend
on the expression of host factors, including the interferon
response. This drastic shutdown of the key parts of the innate
immune system may facilitate efficient viral replication (13, 18)
and immune evasion. Due to its central role in weakening the
anti-viral immune response, SARS-CoV Nsp1 has been proposed
as a potential therapeutic target (19, 20).
Here, we show how Nsp1 binds to the small ribosomal
subunit and prevents canonical mRNA translation by blocking
the mRNA entry tunnel. Moreover, we demonstrate that native
targets of Nsp1 are non-translating, biogenesis-like or initiating
40S subunits as well as 80S ribosomes associated with CCDC124
and LYAR, trapped in their post-translocational state. We
observed that expressing Nsp1 in cells thus results in an efficient
shutdown of translation, in particular of innate immune response
components. Our in-depth structural analysis may be useful for
the design of drugs that target Nsp1 to achieve immune control
and rapid elimination of invading Coronaviruses.
Ribosome binding and translation inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 nsp1
About 84% aa sequence identity suggests that Nsp1 of SARSCoV-2 may share similar properties and biological functions with
its homolog from SARS-CoV (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal residues
K164 and H165 in SARS-CoV are conserved in beta-CoVs and
have been shown to be essential for 40S interaction since
mutations to alanine abolish 40S binding and relieve translational
inhibition (16). To confirm an analogous function of Nsp1 from
SARS-CoV-2, we expressed and purified recombinant Nsp1 and
the K164A/H165A mutant (Nsp1-mt) of both, SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 from E. coli, and tested their binding efficiency to

purified human ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1B). Nsp1 from both
CoVs exhibited strong association to 40S subunits but not to 60S
subunits, whereas both Nsp1-mt constructs failed entirely to bind
(Fig. 1B and fig. S1A). Thus, ribosome binding to the 40S subunit
is preserved and residues K164 and H165 of Nsp1 from both
SARS-CoVs are important for this ribosome interaction. To
further verify this, we expressed wildtype or mutant Nsp1
constructs in human HEK293T cells and analyzed ribosome
association by sucrose-gradient centrifugation. Consistent with
the behavior in vitro, Nsp1 of CoV and CoV-2 co-migrated with
40S ribosomal subunits and 80S ribosomes, but not with actively
translating polyribosomes. In contrast, the mutant constructs
barely penetrated the gradient, indicative of loss of their affinity

for ribosomes (Fig. 1C). Notably, compared to the control the
polysome profiles showed a shift from translating polyribosomes
to 80S monosomes in presence of Nsp1, indicative of global
inhibition of translation. This effect was less pronounced for the
two Nsp1-mt constructs. Next, we performed in vitro translation
assays of capped reporter mRNA in cell free translation extracts
from human cells (HeLa S3) or rabbit reticulocytes in the
presence of Nsp1 or Nsp1-mt. Probing for the translation
products by Western blotting revealed a complete inhibition of
translation by Nsp1 and only weak effects in presence of Nsp1mt constructs (Fig. 1D and fig. S1B).

To test the inhibitory effect of Nsp1 on translation in cells,
we expressed Nsp1 and as a control Nsp7, which is also derived
from SARS-CoV-2 Orf1a/b, in HEK293T cells and monitored
translation of a co-transfected capped luciferase reporter mRNA.
Consistent with the results of the in vitro assays, we observed a
near complete loss of translation in presence of Nsp1 (Fig. 1E).
This phenotype was confirmed for codon-optimized, non-codonoptimized Nsp1, as well as differently tagged versions of Nsp1
(fig. S1, C and D). In summary, Nsp1 from both, SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 binds 40S and 80S ribosomes and disrupt capdependent translation. Moreover, the conserved KH motif close
to the C-terminus of Nsp1 is crucial for ribosome binding and
translation inhibition.

In vitro reconstituted and native nsp1-40S and 80S ribosome complexes
To elucidate the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1
with human ribosomes, we reconstituted a complex from
purified, recombinant Nsp1 together with purified human 40S
ribosomal subunits and determined its structure by cryo-EM at
an average resolution of 2.6 Å (Fig. 2, A and B and figs. S2 and
S3). In addition to the 40S ribosomal subunit, we observed
density corresponding to two α-helices inside the ribosomal
mRNA entry channel, which could be unambiguously identified
as the C-terminal part of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2C).

The second major population of Nsp1-bound 80S
ribosomes (Fig. 2, M and N) contained the cell growth regulating
nucleolar protein LYAR, which was previously implicated in
processing of pre-rRNA and in negative regulation of antiviral
innate immune response (34, 35). We found the C-terminus of
LYAR occupying the ribosomal A-site, similar to CCDC124
(Fig. 2, M and fig. S4, F and G). Furthermore, we identified a
subpopulation among the LYAR-bound inactive 80S ribosomes
that contained a ternary eIF1A-GTP-tRNA complex (Fig. 2, N
and fig. S4, H to K). This ternary complex was in an unusual
conformation, with the anticodon loop contacting an α-helix of
the LYAR C-terminus. Such a complex has not been described
yet and its functional relevance is unknown.
Taken together, we found Nsp1 bound to the mRNA entry
channel of translationally inactive 80S ribosomes. Among them
were highly unusual complexes, for which it is unclear, whether
they were a result of the presence of Nsp1, or whether they occur
naturally and have an increased affinity for Nsp1 due to their
distinct conformation or lack of mRNA.

In proximity to the helical density, we observed undefined
globular density between rRNA helix h16 and ribosomal proteins
uS3 and uS10. The dimensions of this extra density roughly
matched the putative dimensions of the globular N-terminal
domain of Nsp1 (Fig. 2, C and D), based on a structure of the
highly similar N-terminus of Nsp1 from SARS-CoV previously
determined by NMR (21). However, the resolution of this region
in our cryo-EM density map was insufficient for unambiguous
identification. The C-terminus of Nsp1 is located close to the so
called “latch” between the rRNA helix h18 of the body and h34
of the head of the 40S subunit, which influences mRNA
accommodation and movement during translation initiation (22,
23). When bound at this position, the Nsp1 C-terminus blocks
regular mRNA accommodation, thus providing an explanation
of Nsp1’s activity in host translation shutdown (Fig. 2D).
To characterize the ribosomal targets and the mode of
interaction of Nsp1 in the human cellular context, we expressed
N-terminally 3xFLAG tagged Nsp1 in HEK293T cells and
affinity purified associated native complexes for analysis by cryoEM and mass spectrometry (Fig. 2E, figs. S2 and S3 and Data
S1). Structural analysis revealed 40S and 80S ribosomal
complexes in nine compositionally different states (Fig. 2, F to
N). Importantly, all of them displayed density for the Nsp1 Cterminus in the same position and conformation as observed in
the in vitro assembled complex and lacked density corresponding
to mRNA. Yet, apart from these communalities the native
complexes were of a diverse nature and, besides the 43S preinitiation complexes, rather unexpected.
The Nsp1-bound 40S ribosomal complexes could be
divided into three major populations. The first represented idle
Nsp1-40S complexes (Fig. 2F), essentially resembling the in vitro
reconstituted complex. The second population were unusual, pre40S-like complexes (Fig. 2, G and H), which contained the
cytosolic ribosome biogenesis factor TSR1 bound in two distinct
conformations between the 40S head and body (24, 25). Notably,
these complexes did not resemble any known bona-fide biogenesis
intermediates. The third population represented 43S preinitiation complexes (PICs), which could be further divided into
eIF3-containing PICs and complexes containing in addition to
eIF3 also eIF1A, eIF1, and a fully assembled ternary eIF2tRNAi-GTP complex (Fig. 2, I and J) (26-28). This stable
association of Nsp1 in the cell with multiple different
intermediates states of translation initiation besides empty 40S
ribosomal complexes is in agreement with the proposed role of
Nsp1 as an inhibitor of translation initiation (15).
The Nsp1-bound 80S complexes could be divided into two
major populations of translationally inactive ribosomes, which
have to our knowledge not been observed before. The first
population (Fig. 2, K and L and fig. S4, A to E) contained the
protein coiled-coil domain containing short open reading frame
124 (CCDC124), a homolog of the ribosome protection and
translation recovery factor Lso2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (29). A
similar complex of inactive 80S ribosomes bound to CCDC124
was recently described (30). In contrast to the known hibernation
complex, however, a subpopulation of the Nsp1-bound complex
contained in addition the ribosome recycling factor and ABCtype ATPase ABCE1 (31-33) together with class I translation
termination factor eRF1 in an unusual conformation (fig. S4, C
to E). In addition, the previously unresolved, flexible C-terminal
part of CCDC124 was stably bound to the ribosomal A-site in this
complex. Together, this complex might represent a novel
ribosome recycling-like state.

Molecular basis of nsp1-ribosome interaction
and inhibition
We observed the same binding mode of Nsp1 to the 40S subunit
in all ribosomal complexes. The C-terminal domain of Nsp1
(Nsp1-C) was rigidly bound inside the mRNA entry channel,
which, at this location, is constituted by the rRNA helix h18 and
the ribosomal proteins uS5 of the 40S body and uS3 of the 40S
head. The local resolution of 2.6 Å (fig. S3) allowed for detailed
analysis of the molecular interactions of Nsp1 with the ribosome
(Fig. 3A).
The shorter, first α-helix of Nsp1-C (α1; residues 154-160)
interacted with uS3 and uS5. The helix was followed by a short
loop, which contained the essential KH motif that interacted with
h18. Notably, this part of h18 belongs to the so-called “530-loop”,
which is actively participating in ribosomal decoding, and has
been reported to resemble a conserved structural motif in the 3’UTR of beta-CoVs (36). The second, larger α-helix of Nsp1-C (α2;
residues 166-179) also interacted with rRNA h18 and connected
back to uS5 at its C-terminal end. The two helices stabilized each
other through hydrophobic interactions. The electrostatic
potential on the Nsp1-C surface displayed three major patches
(Fig. 3B). A negatively charged patch on α1 facing positively
charged residues on uS3, a positively charged patch on α2 facing
the phosphate backbone of h18 and a hydrophobic patch at the
α1-α2 interface, which was exposed to hydrophobic residues on
uS5. In addition to the matching surface charge, also the shape of
Nsp1-C perfectly matched the shape of the mRNA channel and
thus completely overlapped with the regular mRNA path (Fig. 3,
C and D). Together, this explains the strong inhibitory effect on
translation observed in vitro and in vivo. A key interaction was
established through the KH motif, which was bound to a distinct
site on rRNA helix h18 (Fig. 3, C and E); K164 of Nsp1 inserted
into a negatively charged pocket, constituted mainly by the
phosphate backbone of rRNA bases G625 and U630, whereas
H165 stacked in between U607 and U630. The base U630 was
stabilized in this position through interaction with the backbone
of G168 of Nsp1. The strict dependence of the ribosome
interaction of Nsp1 and its inhibitory function on the KH motif
suggests this pocket as a potential drug target. Further
interactions to h18 were established through R171 and R175 of
Nsp1, which formed salt bridges to the backbone phosphates of

I151 of uS5 (Fig. 3H). Taken together, Nsp1 established a
multitude of specific molecular contacts (summarized in Fig. 3I)
to rigidly anchor into and thereby obstruct the mRNA entry
channel. Therefore, disruption of one or multiple of the interfaces
through competition with a peptide or small molecule may
represent a potential therapeutic strategy against multiple betaCoVs.

mediated induction of expression from the interferon stimulated
response element (ISRE), which is part of the promoter of most
ISGs, was effectively shut down by Nsp1 and MeV V (Fig. 4D)
(42). These results support that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 blocks not
only primary induction of the cytokines, but also expression of
ISGs upon exogenous cytokine stimulation by specific disruption
of the translation step. Notably, not all innate immune responses
require active translation for function. Among these responses is
autophagy, where all components required for anti-viral activity
are already present in the cytoplasm and activated by posttranslational modifications. Consequently, autophagy is barely
affected by the expression of Nsp1 (fig. S5). Tripartite Motif
Protein 32 (TRIM32), which was used as a positive control,
induced a strong autophagic response (43), whereas the negative
control Nsp7 had no effect.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the type-I
interferon system and consequently anti-viral ISG expression is
almost completely shut down by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 at the level
of translation. Thus, our data establish that SARS-CoV-2 uses
Nsp1 as a major inhibitor of anti-viral innate immune responses.

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 efficiently shuts down the
type-I interferon innate immune response
Type-I interferon induction and signaling represents one of the
major innate anti-viral defense pathways, ultimately leading to
the induction of more than 600 interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs) (37). The type I interferon pathway is activated by the
detection of CoVs via the innate immune sensor RIG-I (37-39).
To assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp-1 on type-I interferon
induction, we stimulated HEK293T cells with Sendai Virus
(SeV), a well-known trigger of RIG-I-dependent signaling (37,
40). Expression of Nsp1 completely inhibited the SeV triggered
induction of the human interferon-beta (IFN-β) promotor, while
Nsp7 had no significant effect (Fig. 4A). Measles virus (MeV) V
protein, which inhibits immune sensors like MDA5 (41), but has
little effect on RIG-I-dependent signaling, was included as
control for specific induction of RIG-I-dependent signaling.
Notably, the presences of Nsp1 did not impact the induction of
the endogenous IFN-β or Interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA upon SeV
stimulation. In contrast the release of IFN-β and IL-8 (Fig. 4, B
and C) was severely impaired upon expression of Nsp1 (Fig. 4, B
and C). Again, Nsp7 served as a negative control. IFN-β-

Discussion
Our data establish that one of the major immune evasion factors
of SARS-CoV-2, Nsp1, efficiently interferes with the cellular
translation machinery in order to shut-down the production of
host proteins including antiviral defense factors. As the molecular
basis we discovered the obstruction of the mRNA entry channel
by the C-terminal domain of Nsp1, which employs a highly
specific interaction with uS3, uS5 and rRNA helix 18 on the 40S
small ribosomal subunit. Here, the KH motif establishes a key
interaction with a distinct pocket on h18, which explains why it
is essential for Nsp1 function.
Sensing of Coronaviruses by RIG-I mounts an innate
immune response that - if not blocked by the virus - would
efficiently restrict viral replication (44). A central target of the
translational shutdown is the innate immune response, in
particular the RIG-I-dependent type-I interferon signaling
cascade, which depends on the induction of genes and their
subsequent translation to exert anti-viral action. Although SARSCoV-2 encodes additional potential inhibitors of the innate
immune system, a loss of Nsp1 function might thus enable the
host cell to efficiently restrict viral replication and consequently
prevent the development of a severe respiratory disease.
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 bearing mutations in Nsp1 could be
used to clarify the relative contribution of Nsp1 to immune
evasion in the viral context. In combination with animal models,
this would also allow an assessment of the importance of Nsp1
on viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo.
Because the inhibition of translation is strictly dependent on
the ribosome association of Nsp1, interfering with this interaction
could represent a powerful approach to fight COVID-19. To this
end, our data at 2.6 Å resolution provide a starting point for
rational structure-based drug design, in particular considering the
binding pocket of the critical KH motif on rRNA helix h18.
Ribosomes are established targets of a plethora of small
molecules such as antibiotics (45), and to the best of our
knowledge, the pocket on h18 is not used by any host factor
during normal translation or ribosome biogenesis. Thus, a small
molecule masking this Nsp1 binding pocket, may prevent
association of Nsp1 with the ribosome, but still allow for normal
cellular translation.
Still, important questions remain: is translation of all
cellular mRNAs equally affected by Nsp1? Is Nsp1 of SARSCoV-2 also causing modification and cleavage of cellular
mRNAs as suggested for the SARS-CoV homolog (16)? Most
interestingly, however, how does the virus ensure that the
production of its own, viral proteins is still possible in the
presence of Nsp1? Research on SARS-CoV hints at a role of the
5’ untranslated region, which is also present on all SARS-CoV-2
mRNAs, in circumventing the ribosome blockage by Nsp1 (46).
Addressing these questions will be important for understanding
SARS-CoV-2 infection and a better knowledge of the molecular
interactions of this viral pathogen with the host cell might allow
for the development of safe and effective approaches to combat
it.
