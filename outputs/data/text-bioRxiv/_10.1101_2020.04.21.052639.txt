Abstract
Entry of SARS-CoV-2, etiological agent of COVID-19, in the host cell is driven by the
interaction of its spike protein with human ACE2 receptor and a serine protease, TMPRSS2.
Although complex between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally
resolved, the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive.
TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike
protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to
investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate
drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked
against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both
cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different
loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional
residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate
flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal
cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site
(Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable.
In summary, the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between
human TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that
could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing.

Introduction
The recent pandemic of COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the diseases caused by beta
coronavirus in humans, following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle
Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Cui et al., 2019). By 13th March 2020, over 1.7 million
of global population has been infected with mortality rate of 21% in closed cases (WHO
COVID-19 situation report-84). Genetically, etiological agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is
closely related to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV (Wu et al., 2020). Similarly, like for
SARS-CoV, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been identified as the primary
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Li, 2015; Lan et al., 2020). Whereas MERS-CoV spike
protein interacts with the DiPeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) as the first site of attachment to the host
cell (Li, 2015). Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 1273 amino acid long protein with two
functionally distinct regions, S1 and S2, involved in the attachment and entry of the virus,
respectively. SARS-CoV-2 entry in the host cell is mediated by proteolytic cleavage of its spike
protein, a process dubbed as priming. Recently, human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2
(TMPRSS2) has been shown to carry out the priming of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by
generating two distinct fragments of the viral spike protein, S1/S2 and S2’ (Hoffman et al.,
2020).

Recently, co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexed with ACE2 receptor has
been resolved unraveling the finer details of intermolecular interactions (Lan et al., 2020). The
ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complexes not only indicate the potential of cross species transmission but
also open a window for designing and/or screening of disruptor molecules that could potentially
inhibit the attachment of the virus with the host cells (Lan et al., 2020; Ortega et al., 2020).
However, no complex structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with TMPRSS2 has been resolved
to date. Moreover, the molecular structure of human TMPRSS2 protein is also not known.
Resultantly, structural details of intermolecular interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and
TMPRSS2 are largely unknown. Although, like many other protease inhibitors (Zhang et al.,
2020), TMPRSS2 inhibitor has been suggested and/or shown to antagonize the entry of the virus
into the host cells (Hoffman et al., 2020). This study aims to investigate the interaction points
between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an array of bioinformatic tool. The
findings not only provide structure-function relationship of TMPRSS2 of humans but also

predict the sites of interactions between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This could
lead to the development and/or directed screening of disruptor and/or inhibitor molecules.

Methodology
Data mining for structures
Protein sequence of human TMPRSS2 (O15393) was retrieved from UniProt and subjected to
PDB Blast to identify the homologous structure on the basis of query coverage and sequence
identity. Atomic coordinates of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (PDBid: 6VSB) and Hepsin (PDBid:
1Z8G) were retrieved from RCSB protein data bank (Wrapp et al., 2020; Herter et al., 2005;
GoodSell et al., 2020). Probability of the protein crystallization for TMPRSS2 was predicted
using XtalPred server (Slabinski et al., 2007).

Molecular modelling

N-terminal region (1-148) of TMPRSS2 including LDL-receptor class A domain was modeled
using I-TASSER (Roy et al., 2010) due to the unavailability of template with sufficient
homology. Since, hepsin molecule was found to share noticeable homology with the SRCR and
peptidase S1 domains of TMPRSS2, a full length model of TMPRSS2 were later developed
using Modeller 9.16 (Webb and Sali, 2016) taking model developed by I-TASSER and hepsin
(PDBid: 1Z8G) as templates. Full length model of TMPRSS2 was further refined for Gibb’s free
energy and conformation of the loops. The structural quality of the model was assessed by
MolProbity for Ramachandran Plot (Chen et al., 2010) and ProSA (Wiederstein and Sippl,
2007). Finally, the full length model was superimposed over template (PDBid: 1Z8G) and root
mean square deviation in carbon alpha back bone was measured in Å using Swiss PDB Viewer
v4.1.0 (Johansson et al., 2012).
Molecular docking

HADDOCK 2.2 webserver (Van Zundert et al., 2016) was used to conduct molecular docking
between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and TMPRSS2. The input include atomic coordinates of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (PDBid: 6VSB) and constructed full length molecular model of

TMPRSS2. Two separate docking simulations were run for each cleavage site of the viral spike
protein. Reported cleavage sites (Hoffman et al. 2020) on spike protein were defined as active
residues for SARS-CoV-2, whereas substrate binding sites and catalytically active sites were
recognized as active residues of TMPRSS2. HADDOCK congregated all docking simulations
into clusters and ranked them according to the HADDOCK score which is the function of linear
combination of Van der Waals energy, electrostatic energy, desolvation energy, restraint
violation energy and buried surface area. The cluster with least HADDOCK score was selected
for further assessment. Binding affinity and different types of interactions like charged-charged,
charged-polar, charged-apolar, polar-polar, polar-apolar and apolar- apolar were identified using
PRODIGY webserver (Xue et al., 2016). Interacting residues of TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2
spike protein were separated and dimensions and druggability were assessed using
DoGSiteScorer (Volkamer et al., 2012). All structures were visualized using DS visualizer 2016.

Results
Molecular model of TMPRSS2
Human TMPRSS2 is 492 amino acid long protein with three functional domains: an N-terminal
LDL-receptor class A domain (113-148) followed by SRCR (153-246) and finally at C-terminal
peptidase S1 domain spanning from 256 to 487 amino acid (Figure 1A). Till now molecular
structure of the protein has not been resolved and our XtalPred analysis showed the least
possibility for this molecule to be crystalized, potentially due to the high percentage of coiled
structure, isoelectric point and surface hydrophobicity (Figure 1B). This may be the reason that
since the first report of TMPRSS2 in year 1997 (Paoloni-Giacobino et al., 1997), the structure
has not been resolved by X-ray crystallography. Nevertheless, computational based molecular
modelling approaches have evolved since then and come of age in terms of accuracy and
reliability with new tools and server being available (Roy et al., 2010; Webb and Sali, 2016).
Therefore, we used multiple approaches to develop the full length molecular model of
TMPRSS2. The finally selected refined model of TMPRSS2 has 96.32% residues within the
allowed regions of Ramachandran plot, which is acceptable considering the N-terminal portion
of the protein was predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Secondly, it has been demonstrated
rather frequently that many of the resolved structures of the proteins such as USP7 (PDB id:
2F1Z) have more than 20% of the residues outside the allowed region in Ramachandran plot.

Moreover, Gibbs Free energy values (-14212.818 KK/mol) and ProSA Z score (-6.89) both
suggest structural reliability of the model (Figure 1C;D).

Molecular structure of TMPRSS2
Full length molecular models of TMRPSS2 has considerable structural homology with the
template molecule (PDB: 1Z8G), where the deviation between the Cα back bone of model and
template was found as 0.33Å (Figure 1E;F). All three domains, LDL-receptor class A, SRCR
and peptidase S1, formed distinct structural units in the molecular model. N-terminal region and
LDL-receptor class A of TMPRSS2 were found more or less unstructured (Figure 1G;H).
Putative Ca2+ biding residues (Asp134, His138, Asp144, Glu145 and Ile256) were found on a
loop linking N-terminal of the protein with SRCR domain. Structurally, SRCR domain
comprises an α helix and multiple anti parallel β sheets, potentially stabilized by two disulfide
bonds between Cys172-Cys231 and Cys185-Cys241 (Figure 1I). Overall structural
conformation of the domain showed uncanny resemblance with the SRCR domain found in
MARCO receptor and hepsin (Herter et al., 2005; Ojala et al., 2007). The C-terminal of
TMPRSS2 has a large catalytic domain with typical structural features of chymotrypsin family
serine proteases (Mönttinen et al., 2019). The triad of catalytically active site residues (His296,
Ile346 and Ser441) and substrate binding sites (Asp435, Ser460 and Gly462) were found
sandwiched between two six stranded β barrels of nearly equal size (Figure 1I). The interresidual distance between the catalytically active residues ranges from 7.965Å to 10.263Å
(Supplementary figure). In comparison, the inter-residual distance between substrate binding
sites ranges from 7.409Å to 11.765Å (Supplementary figure). The globular conformation of the
domain is likely be stabilized by four disulfide bonds between Cys244-Cys365, Cys281-Cys297,
Cys410-Cys426 and Cys437-Cys465.
Interaction of TMPRSS2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
The entry of the SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell is driven by the proteolytic cleavage of its spike
protein resulting in the formation of two fragments, S1/S2 and S2’ (Hoffman et al., 2020). The
precise positioning of the proteolytic cleavage sites have been mapped by sequence comparison
and found to be at the junction of Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The cleavage at the later
site results in the production of S1/S2 and S2’ fragments, which is necessary for the viral entry

into the cells. This provides an excellent basis on which docking simulations could be directed.
Thereby, in this study we run an independent docking simulation for each site. The conformation
of the complex between TMRPSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 in selected docking pose revealed that
both cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are present at the flexible loops and interacts
with one of the β barrel of the catalytic domain of TMPRSS2 (Figure 2A-C; 3A-C). At the first
cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686) of the spike protein, His296 of TMPRSS2 formed a hydrogen
bond and electrostatic interaction with Arg682 of the spike protein (Table 1; Figure 2D).
Whereas, at the second cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816), out of the three residues of catalytic triad,
His296 and Ser441 established hydrogen bond interactions with Pro809, Lys814 and Ser810 of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Table 1; Figure 3D). Ser810 also formed a hydrogen bond and
hydrophobic interaction with Ser460, substrate binding site, and His296, catalytic site of
TMPRSS2, respectively (Table 1; Figure 3D). Since the functionally important residues of
TMPRSS2 interact with the amino acids that immediately flank the cleavage site, this raises a
possibility that upon interaction with the viral spike protein, the later may undergo
conformational changes that may bring Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816 of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein in line with the active site cleft of TMPRSS2. Nevertheless, Ser441 of TMPRSS2,
that has been demonstrated as the most critical residue for the proteolytic cleavage of viral spike
protein (Böttcher et al., 2006; Shirogane et al., 2008), were found interacting with several
flanking residue of cleavage site found in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Table 1; Figure 3D). This
represent the importance of neigbouring residues in the establishment of molecular complex
between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. An unpublished study (DOI:
10.1101/2020.02.08.926006) with partial modelled structure of TMPRSS2 also corroborate our
findings. Furthermore, involvement of charged residues in most of the intermolecular
interactions and binding affinity values (-13.8 Kcal/mol) represent the reliability of the complex
in terms of structural conformation (Table 1). In order to explore the druggability, interacting
residues of TMPRSS2 for each cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were assessed for the
volume, area and drug score. Consistent to the molecular docking simulations, intermolecular
interactions between TMPRSS2 and Arg815/Ser816 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein appeared as a
suitable target for drug designing and development (Figure 2E-F; 3E-F).

Discussion
Human TMPRSS2 is a 70kDa protein, a member of large superfamily of serine protease, mainly
expressed in prostate, colon, stomach, and salivary gland (Vaarala et al., 2001). In prostate gland
its expression is regulated by androgens and found overexpressed in prostate carcinoma (Afar et
al., 2001). Physiologically, the protein is important in the functioning of epithelial sodium
transport (Donaldson et al., 2002) and angiogenesis (Aimes et al., 2003). In addition, TMRPSS2
importance has been demonstrated in relation to the entry of influenza virus (Böttcher et al.,
2006), SARS-CoV (Shulla et al., 2011), parainfluenza virus (Abe et al., 2013), MERS-CoV
(Shirato et al., 2013) and SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffman et al., 2020). Cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2
spike protein for TMPRSS2 action have been mapped, but the complex structure of SARS-CoV2 spike protein and TMPRSS2 has not been resolved. An investigative flank of the unpublished
study (DOI: 10.1101/2020.02.08.926006) attempted to address the same issue, however,
focusing on the development of peptidyl analogue targeting merely catalytic triad of TMPRSS2
using partial model of the molecule. Additionally, details regarding the interaction between the
viral spike protein and TMPRSS2 have not been resolved at the residual level and/or for both
cleavage sites.
We have constructed full length model of TMPRSS2 showing distinct localization of all three
functional domains. The C-terminal peptidase S1 domain is expectedly involved in the
interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Both substrate binding and catalytic sites residues
of TMPRSS2 interact with the cleavage sites and/or immediate flanking residues of SARS-CoV2 spike protein. Involvement of the neighbouring amino acids to the active site of TMPRSS2 and
cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 provides important clues for the design of targeted inhibitors
and/or peptidyl disruptors. Several protease inhibitors have been proposed by means of virtual
screening (Shah et al., 2020) and have shown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hoffman
et al., 2020). The findings of the present study in relation to the diversity of the nature of
intermolecular interactions and biophysciochemical properties of entailing amino acids may in
turn facilitate structure based drug designing for the more efficient peptidyl antagonists against
COVID-19. Peptidyl inhibitors have shown to efficiently inhibit EBNA1 dimerization (Hussain,
2013), protein-protein interactions of coiled-coiled transcription factors like Bcl-2 proteins,
MDM2/MDMX, HIVgp41 (Aragi and Keating, 2016) and human thymidylate synthase

(Cardinale et al., 2011). In addition, the present study further points to the key residues for the
subsequent investigations like site directed mutagenesis and peptide array studies to discern
importance of potentially other residues in the priming of the viral spike protein. Recently, we
have reported that allelic variants in the human ACE2 receptor flanking the key interacting
amino acids may hamper its attachment with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Hussain et al., 2020).
Therefore, the present study could also be advanced in relation to explore the effect of natural
polymorphism found in human TMPRSS2 on priming of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
