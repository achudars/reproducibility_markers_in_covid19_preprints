Abstract
The reuse of pre-existing small molecules for a novel emerging disease threat is a rapid measure
to discover unknown applications for previously validated therapies. A pertinent and recent
example where such strategy could be employed is in the fight against COVID-19. Therapies
designed or discovered to target viral proteins also have off-target effects on the host proteome
when employed in a complex physiological environment. This study aims to assess these hostcell targets for a panel of FDA approved antiviral compounds including Remdesivir, using the
cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA®) coupled to mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) in noninfected cells. CETSA MS is a powerful method to delineate direct and indirect interactions
between small molecules and protein targets in intact cells. Biologically active compounds can
induce changes in thermal stability, in their primary binding partners as well as in proteins that
in turn interact with the direct targets. Such engagement of host targets by antiviral drugs may
contribute to the clinical effect against the virus but can also constitute a liability. We present
here a comparative study of CETSA molecular target engagement fingerprints of antiviral
drugs to better understand the link between off-targets and efficacy.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant worldwide effort to reuse or repurpose
preexisting therapies in order to combat the emerging viral threat. There have been numerous
studies reported using a variety of technologies in efforts to screen panels of pre-validated
molecules, many repurposed from viral therapies1-5. These studies are conducted in the hope
that efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be discovered, whilst avoiding the lengthy
yet essential drug discovery pipeline that even with modern standards typically takes several
years from hit and target identification, to reach clinical testing of a lead candidate drug
molecule6.
Utilising a preexisting molecule has a significantly lower risk than rapidly developing novel
chemistry, since it has already successfully navigated the prerequisite safety and toxicologic
testing for use in humans. However, the original purpose of the small molecule may have
undescribed off-target effects that are deemed to be tolerable when weighed against therapeutic
benefit. These effects, potentially caused by drug-protein interactions, are often poorly
understood7.
For example, many antiviral compounds are structural analogues of nucleoside triphosphates
(NTPs) that have diverse biological properties and therapeutic consequences since nucleotides
have an essential role in virtually all biological processes8. Therefore, given the abundance of
nucleotide interacting proteins in the host cell, off-target interacting proteins, or an imbalance
of the cellular nucleotide pool would be an expected consequence of utilising nucleotide
analogues in therapy9.
The persistent and fundamental problem of host off-target effects arise from using a molecule
to disrupt viral biology, whilst simultaneously exposing the host biology to the same chemical
challenge. Methods to describe the severity of hitting off targets, rely upon in vitro and in vivo
assessment or the presentation of a phenotype that can be assessed as to whether acceptable or
not. But this requires knowledge and the ability to measure non-intended target biology. For
example, Remdesivir is known to have an efficacy of 100nM for the viral polymerase its
intended target, and 500-fold less efficacious against human polymerases10. It has previously
not been established which other proteins may interact with and nor whether these potential
interactions would elicit a response with a measurable output using conventional means.

In light of this, traditional off-target investigation relies on known functions or activities which
as a prerequisite require the host proteins responsible for these activities to be studied in bias.
Methods that are independent of activity and in an unbiased way report on compound
interaction against the entire proteome, have only in recent years been established11,12. The
CEllular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) is a powerful technique to detect protein ligand
interactions in cells13. Coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) as a readout, CETSA MS is a
technique employed in the identification of off-target effects in proteome-wide studies
observing the thermal stabilization or destabilization of endogenous proteins and downstream
effects after matrix and compound incubation. The method is being increasingly employed in
both mechanism of action (MoA) studies and to identify primary and off-targets of candidate
drug molecules. For example, quinine and drug target interactions in Plasmodium falciparum
14,15

. In this study, we screened a panel of drugs using the CETSA MS format on HepG2 cells

to identify host proteins as hopeful starting points for further research and possible inroads into
the improvement or development of fortuitous therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Given the intense global interest in searching for a viable therapy combined with the wide
accessibility to information sources and even raw data, efforts from a wide variety of groups
have been well documented in both the scientific and non-scientific media. The inclusion of
compounds for this study was directed around prominent molecules discussed in the literature
and adopted for clinical trials in the earlier phases of the worldwide pandemic, namely
Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine. The study was bolstered by the edition of other
compounds repurposed from a variety of anti-viral classes including retroviral reverse
transcriptase and protease inhibitors that were available for expeditious purchase from
commercial sources16-19.
This study investigates compound effects on uninfected whole HepG2 cells. Understanding
how the molecule reacts in an environment containing both viral and host cell proteins is not
beyond the technique, but outside of the capacity and scope for this study that was completed
utilising a preexisting in vitro platform with a per compound acquisition time of approximately
~6 hours.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The human cell line HepG2 was procured from ATCC and cultured until 70% confluency in
collagen-coated flasks. The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (without phenol red)
(ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (ThermoFisher), 5 mM sodium pyruvate
(ThermoFisher), 1X NEAA (ThermoFisher) and PEST (ThermoFisher). Cells were detached
using 5 ml of Tryp-LE (Thermo Fisher Scientific), pelleted, washed with Hank’s Balanced Salt
solution (HBSS, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and pelleted again. Cell viability was measured
with trypan blue exclusion and cells with a viability above 90% were used for these
experiments. Cell pellets were resuspended in medium-free incubation buffer (20 mM HEPES,
138 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) for further use as a 2x cell
suspension.
Compound handling
All compounds were acquired from commercial sources as powder stocks and reconstituted in
Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or aqueous buffer dependent on manufacturer recommended
solubility values. DMSO concentration was normalized across all samples to a final
concentration of 1% v/v.
Compressed CETSA MS experiment
The cell suspension was divided into 32 aliquots (22 test compounds, 2x methotrexate (1st
positive control), 2x vincristine (2nd positive control) and 4x negative/vehicle controls) in
Eppendorf tubes and mixed with an equal volume of either of the test compound or controls at
2x final concentration in the experimental buffer. The resulting final concentration of the
compounds was 30 µM; 1% DMSO was used as a vehicle control. Incubations were performed
for 60 minutes at 37˚C with end-over-end rotation. Viability after 1 hour of incubation with
each compound were greater than 90%.
Each of the treated cell suspensions was further divided into 12 aliquots that were all subjected
to a heat challenge for 3 minutes, each at a different temperature between 44 and 66°C. After
heating, all temperature points for each test condition were pooled to generate 32 individual
(compressed) samples.
Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 30 000 x g for 20 minutes and
supernatants constituting the soluble protein fraction were kept for further analysis.
The experiment was performed over three independent biological replicates.

Protein digestion
The total protein concentration of the soluble fractions were measured by Lowry DC assay
(BioRad). From each soluble fraction, a volume containing an equivalent of 20µg of total
protein was taken for further sample preparation.
Samples were subjected to reduction and denaturation with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP) (Bond-breaker, Thermo Scientific) and RapiGest SF (Waters), followed by alkylation
with chloroacetamide. Proteins were digested with Lys-C (Wako Chemicals) and trypsin
(Trypsin Gold, Promega).
TMT-labeling of peptides
After complete digestion had been confirmed by nanoLC-MS/MS, samples were labelled with
16-plex Tandem Mass Tag reagents (TMTpro, Thermo Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Labeling reactions were quenched by addition of a primary amine buffer and the test
concentrations and room temperature control samples were combined into TMT16-plex sets
such that each TMT16-multiplex set contained 12 test compounds, two positive control
samples (MTX+Vincristine) and two negative controls (1% DMSO). The labelled samples
were subsequently acidified and desalted using polymeric reversed phase chromatography
(Oasis, Waters). LC-MS grade liquids and low-protein binding tubes were used throughout the
purification. Samples were dried using a centrifugal evaporator.
LC-MS/MS analysis
For each TMT16-multiplex set, the dried labelled sample was dissolved in 20 mM ammonium
hydroxide (pH 10.8) and subjected to reversed-phase high pH fractionation using an Agilent
1260 Bioinert HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) over a 1.5 x 150 mm C18 column
(XBridge Peptide BEH C18, 300 Å, 3.5 µm particle size, Waters Corporation, Milford, USA).
Peptide elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 215 nm and fractions were collected every
30 seconds into polypropylene plates. The 60 fractions covering the peptide elution range were
evaporated to dryness, ready for LC-MS/MS analysis.
From the fractions collected, 30 pooled fractions were analyzed by high resolution nano LCMS/MS on Q-Exactive HF-X Orbitrap mass spectrometers (Thermo Scientific) coupled to high
performance nano-LC systems (Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano, Thermo Scientific).
MS/MS data was collected using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and full MS
data was collected using a resolution of 120 K with an AGC target of 3e6 over the m/z range

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.19.210492; this version posted July 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

375 to 1500. The top 15 most abundant precursors were isolated using a 1.4 Da isolation
window and fragmented at normalized collision energy values of 35. The MS/MS spectra (45
K resolution) were allowed a maximal injection time of 120 ms with an AGC target of 1e5 to
avoid coalescence. Dynamic exclusion duration was 30 s.
Protein identification and quantification
Protein identification was performed by database search against 95 607 human protein
sequences in Uniprot (UP000005640, download date: 2019-10-21) using the Sequest HT
algorithm as implemented in the ProteomeDiscoverer 2.4 software package. Data was recalibrated using the recalibration function in PD2.4 and final search tolerance settings included
a mass accuracy of 10 ppm and 50 mDa for precursor and fragment ions, respectively. A
maximum of 2 missed cleavage sites were allowed using fully tryptic cleavage enzyme
specificity (K, R, no P). Dynamic modifications were; oxidation of Met, and deamidation of
Asn and Gln. Dynamic modification of protein N-termini by acetylation was also allowed.
Carbamidomethylation of Cys, TMTpro-modification of Lysine and peptide N-termini were
set as static modifications. For protein identification, validation was done at the peptidespectrum-match (PSM) level using the following acceptance criteria; 1 % FDR determined by
Percolator scoring based on Q-value, rank 1 peptides only. For quantification, a maximum coisolation of 50 % was allowed. Reporter ion integration was done at 20 ppm tolerance and the
integration result was verified by manual inspection to ensure the tolerance setting was
applicable. For individual spectra, an average reporter ion signal-to-noise of >20 was required.
Only unique or razor peptides were used for protein quantification.
Data analysis
Quantitative results were exported from Proteome Discoverer as tab-separated files and
analyzed using R version 4.0.2 software. Protein intensities in each TMT channel were log2transformed and normalized by subtracting median value per each TMT sample and each TMT
channel (column-wise normalization). For each protein and each compound, thermal stability
changes were assessed by comparing normalized log2-transformed intensities to DMSO
treated control using moderated t-test implemented in “limma” R-package version 3.44.120.

Results
We have applied the cellular thermal shift assay combined with quantitative LC-MS based
proteomics (CETSA MS) to profile compound-induced protein thermal stability changes for
22 compounds in intact HepG2 cells. The experiments were performed in compressed, or onepot format21. HepG2 cells were treated with 30µM of each compound and incubated for 60
minutes at 37°C in serum-free salt-based medium. After compound treatment, cell suspensions
were divided into 12 aliquots followed by heat shock treatment at 12 temperatures (44-66˚°C)
for 3 min. After heat treatment, samples were pooled and aggregated proteins were removed
by centrifugation. Resulting protein abundance in the soluble fraction corresponded to the area
under the protein’s melting curve. The experiment was repeated to yield three biological
replicates. Single compound concentration and application of compressed (one-pot)
experimental design allowed for reliable protein stability changes assessment at relatively high
throughput of ~6 hours acquisition time per compound. The studied compounds will be
incorporated in a larger (>200 compounds) initiative to establish CETSA based molecular
fingerprints of a diverse set of compounds.

Proteins were quantified via isobaric labelling liquid chromatography coupled to massspectrometry (LC-MS). The resulting dataset covers more than 8,000 protein groups, of them
5,873 protein groups were reliably quantified in more than 17 out of 22 treatments with at least
two unique peptides.
In order to assess compound induced protein thermal stability changes, for each treatment we
compared log2-transformed and normalized intensities to the corresponding vehicle controls.
For all 22 compounds tested only 34 proteins were found to be significantly changed (stabilized
or destabilized) upon treatment with at least one compound (Figure 2).

Remdesivir, being one of several nucleoside analogues in our panel, shows a clear hit for
Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) which could be involved in the metabolism of the molecule.
Although hydrolysis of the ester is reportedly by cathepsin A and carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)22,
CES2 has high abundance in liver tissue. Also, Acyl-coenzyme thioesterase 9 (ACOT9) as well
as Diphthine methyl ester synthase (DPH5) - albeit less obvious, showed stability shift with

treatment, both of these proteins are known to bind esters, similar to the activity of CES2.
Given during the activation of the prodrug includes an intracellular esterase hydrolysis step, an
interaction is not surprising.
In contrast, and most notable from this study is the destabilization of Pachytene checkpoint
protein 2 homolog (TRIP13). Trip13 is a hexameric AAA+ ATPase and a key regulator in
chromosome recombination and structural regulation, such as crossing over and DNA double
strand breaks23. Trip13 is essential in the spindle assembly checkpoint and is expressed in a
number of human cancers where its reduction has been linked with effects on proliferation and
hence therapeutic benefit24. It is plausible that Remdesivir, in its fully synthesized triphosphate
form is competitive with endogenous ATP binding with Trip13, disrupting or affecting
multimerization with itself or downstream on the spindle assembly complex.
Interestingly, GS-441524, a metabolite of Remdesivir had no significant hits in this study.
There could be multiple explanations for this, but in this case, it is established that unfavorable
compound properties of GS-441524 result in limited cellular uptake. Especially when a 60minute incubation protocol is considered. In our experience, addition of nucleosides often has
impact on several proteins involved in cellular nucleoside homeostasis.
As apparent from Figure 2, the Chloroquines (Hydroxychloroquine, Chloroquine and
Chloroquine Phosphate) comprise their own cluster. Despite having clear function on the
endosomal processes, the hits identified for hydroxychloroquine do not appear to follow an
obvious pathway response e.g. vesicle proteins, vesicle lumen proteins (including ER Golgi),
extracellular proteins, ion channels and transporters. It is possible that the identified hits are
best representatives for the technique from their respective pathways. However, there are no
known literature sources linking these targets to chloroquine and hydroxy version to activity
found.
Despite this, a common hit between all three chloroquine derivatives tested was Choline Kinase
alpha (CHKA) that has a key role in phospholipid biosynthesis. Another common hit between
the hydroxy and Chloroquine phosphate forms is Copine 1 (CPNE1) a calcium dependent
phospholipid binding protein that plays a role in calcium-mediated intracellular processes25.
Other significant hits are Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT), Epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EPCAM), and Stathmin (STMN1).

As concluded earlier, both Remdesivir and the Chloroquines stand out as separate clusters with
no other antiviral compounds having similar response patterns. However, Ritonavir, a protease
inhibitor and Baloxavir marboxil also stand out with unique response patterns.
Ritonavir induces many more significant shifts in comparison to the other protease inhibitors
tested, Darunavir, Indinavir and Nelfinavir. Two of the hits CES2 and DHRS4 could be
implicated in the metabolism of Ritonavir. The other stability-altered proteins may constitute
a phenotype where lipid metabolism pathways are affected alongside Ca and H+ ion balance.
There is support in the literature for effects on lipid metabolism and on the respiratory
chain26,27. Proteins involved in Lipid metabolism being thermally shifted by Ritonavir include
FABP1, MTTP, ACOX1, ACOX3, HADHA, DECR2, AIFM1 and AIFM2. The thiol
modification protein QSOX2. Ion channels LETM1 and SLC38A10. Calcium and zinc binding
proteins HPCAL1 and NUCB1, Synaptic vesicle membrane protein VAT-1 homolog (VAT1)
and finally, Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 3A (NT5C3A) that dephosphorylates CMP and 7mGMP. It should be noted however, that most of the proteins shifted by Ritonavir are also shifted,
albeit to a lower extent among the other protease inhibitors as well as a resemblance to the nonnucleoside inhibitor Delavirdine. A possible explanation is that Ritonavir has a faster cellular
uptake or induction of cellular phenotypic effects resulting in a significantly stronger shift in
these patterns than other compounds.
Baloxavir marboxil, the antiviral medication for treatment of influenza A and B, has quite
distinct proteome stability alteration pattern. Baloxavir marboxil protein hits do not overlap
with those of the other compounds. The proteins shifting include Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1),
an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. Pyruvate
Dehydrogenase protein component (PDHX), Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L39 (MRPL39),
Lon protease (LONP1) an ATP dependent serine protease, Trifunctional enzyme subunit alpha
(HADHA) and long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 1 (ACSL1). In our experience, such effects
to the proteome are indicative of an oxidative stress response.
The remaining compounds either induce no shifts or do so for very few proteins. The latter
make up cluster 2 in Figure 2 where the lack of pronounced molecular fingerprint does not
allow for further division into separate or unique groupings. Lamivudine treatment resulted in
in a stabilizing shift for DCK, which is known to be responsible for the intracellular

phosphorylation of the drug28 which provide confidence of cellular uptake. These data may
well constitute useful information when taken in the context of further study.
Discussion
This study intended to help better understand any off-target effects of Remdesivir and
Chloroquine as two prominently repurposed drugs for targeting SARS-CoV-2, with the view
to identify potential biological inroads for further investigation.
This is an intact cell study and therefore conducted in a highly biological context. In that,
proteins exist at their endogenous expression and environment. The relative amounts of
analytes, nucleotide and metabolites represent levels commensurate to healthy unmodified
cultured cells. In the CETSA MS platform, we identify both stabilized and destabilized proteins
after treatment with these drug molecules. A stabilizing shift is often attributed to a direct
binding event. Similarly a destabilizing shift can also be caused by a direct binding event if the
molecular interaction causes the target to be less thermodynamically favorable. Additionally,
destabilizing events can be caused by the usurping of a native substrate or the removal of a
complex of protein-protein interactions as a secondary downstream effect.
The host targets identified represent a wide variety of biological processes. It is important to
note that these data are included in this study to offer an unrevised perspective at potential offtargets. A thorough understanding of the relevance to viral infection is a significant undertaking
and well beyond the scope and timelines of this study. The term off-targets or unintended
targets is employed here, meaning not the primary target. Although it can also be the case that
an interaction with a host protein is essential for the efficacy of the drug, as is the case with
Lamivudine and DCK. In this light, there are other targets involved in nucleotide regulation
such as RNR, SAMHD1 and ADK in particular that we would have expected the cellular
presence of GS-441524 and other nucleotide analogues to have affected. In contrast, these
regulatory proteins were not identified as hits which is a surprising outcome given in our
experience ADK is known to shift upon binding of substrate.
There are no previous studies using CETSA MS to comparatively analyze a panel of anti-viral
compounds. Given the primary purpose of the majority of these drugs is to interact or inhibit
viral proteins, there was no expectation that common host targets would be identified.

In contrast, the Chloroquine molecules are known to have substantial effects to the endosomal
compartment and the expectation was significant and broad shifts in these samples that was not
observed. Aside from the described shifts, the bulk of cluster 2 represented less defined changes
to a broad range of biological activities, not allowing for a definitive molecular fingerprint to
be elucidated.
This study was designed to identify previously unidentified proteins that could have critical
importance for the reported activity of Remdesivir and other compounds in the context of
COVID-19. The inclusion of a panel of molecules allows for the cross comparison against hits
specific to one molecule, which has facilitated the novel finding that Remdesivir uniquely
destabilizes Trip13.
The function of Trip13 does not lend itself to that of an obvious benefit or hinderance to viral
infection, as would be considered by a protein with known host innate viral immunity activity.
But the fact it interacts with nucleotides and forms a homohexamer which if diminished
removes activity, lends it to the possibility the interaction with Remdesivir may in fact be
tangible29.
Further in vitro biophysical investigation probing the interaction could elucidate evidence into
the role of Trip13 in Remdesivir therapy. The functional relevance of such an interaction in the
context of viral infected tissue could yield crucial information as to whether its potential off
target behavior is tolerable, beneficial or indeed a hindrance to the molecule’s efficacy against
Sar-CoV-2.
This study has highlighted the power of utilizing unbiased whole proteome approaches and the
information that can be rapidly gained from describing proteome wide target engagement of
drug molecules.
