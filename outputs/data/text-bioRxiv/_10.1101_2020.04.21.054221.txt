ABSTRACT

25

We describe fifteen major mutation events from 2,058 high-quality SARS-CoV-2

26

genomes deposited up to March 31st, 2020. These events define five major clades (G, I, S,

27

D and V) of globally-circulating viral populations, representing 85.7% of all sequenced

28

cases, which we can identify using a 10 nucleotide genetic classifier or barcode. We applied

29

this barcode to 4,000 additional genomes deposited between March 31st and April 15th and

30

classified successfully 95.6% of the clades demonstrating the utility of this approach. An

31

analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 ORFs provided evidence of substitution

32

events in the viral proteins involved in both host-entry and genome replication. The

33

systematic monitoring of dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of circulating

34

virus populations over time can guide therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to manage

35

and contain the virus and, also, with available efficacious antivirals and vaccines, aid in the

36

monitoring of circulating genetic diversity as we proceed towards elimination of the agent.

37

The barcode will add the necessary genetic resolution to facilitate tracking and monitoring

38

of infection clusters to distinguish imported and indigenous cases and thereby aid public

39

health measures seeking to interrupt transmission chains without the requirement for real-

40

time complete genomes sequencing.

INTRODUCTION

43

SARS-CoV-2 has now reached 185 countries across all continents, except Antarctica.

44

With over 2.5 million cases currently confirmed globally1, a pandemic was declared by the

45

World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11th, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.054221; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

46

Coronaviridae family, genus Betacoronavirus, which are enveloped positive-sense, single-

47

stranded RNA viruses, of zoonotic origin. Among human RNA viruses, coronaviruses have

48

the largest known genome (~30 kb), which consists of the structural proteins (spike,

49

envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid), nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16), and accessory

50

proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and b, ORF8, ORF10). Structural proteins are required

51

for host cell entry, viral assembly and exit2,3. Nonstructural proteins are involved in genome

52

replication-transcription and formation of vesicles4, whereas accessory proteins interfere

53

with host innate defense mechanisms5,6,7. During replication within the host, the virus

54

acquires genome mutations, which can be passed on to virus progeny in subsequently

55

infected individuals. Systematically tracking mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is

56

therefore important as it allows monitoring of the molecular epidemiology of circulating

57

viral sequences nationally and internationally. Here, we have investigated the genomic

58

variation landscape of a large set of globally-derived SARS-CoV-2 genomes and defined

59

major mutation events. This analysis allowed us to produce a first-generation genetic

60

classifier, or ‘barcode’, defining the major clades of the virus circulating up to April 15th,

61

2020. Notably, this barcode allowed reliable tracking of the spatial distribution and

62

prevalence of these viral clades over time. While most of the nonsynonymous mutation

63

events appear neutral with respect to protein function and stability, we also found evidence

64

of mutations in the spike protein that may modulate the interaction between SARS-CoV-2

65

and the host.

66

RESULTS

67

Five clades of SARS-CoV-2 are characterised by 15 major mutational events across

68

the globe.

69

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is genetically most closely related (96%) to a bat SARS-

70

related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) RaTG13 and also to SARSr-CoVs from pangolins8

71

(Supplementary Figure 1). We analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 2,058

72

high-quality complete genomes downloaded from GISAID9 (March 31st). We studied their

73

chronological occurrences during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 across human

74

populations, which allowed us to define several major and minor clades of the virus that

75

share unique SNPs (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figures 2, 3). We observed

76

1,221 SNPs in the current dataset with 753 missense, 452 silent, 12 nonsense and 4

77

intergenic substitutions. We defined five major clades (Figure 1) compared to the prototype

78

(MN908947.3), covering 85.7% of the global set of SARS-CoV-2 high-quality genomes

79

publicly available up to March 31st. The clades were named by the amino acid mutation: S

80

(Orf8, L84S), V (Orf3a, G251V), I (Orf1ab, V378I), D (Orf1ab, G392D) and G (S,

81

D614G).

82

These 5 clades are characterised by 15 major nucleotide substitution events in the

83

SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3) representing 1,763

84

genomes (85.7%) from 45 countries. To obtain a global picture of the regional distribution

85

of the clades over time during a 14 week period, we plotted the relative proportions of the

86

major and minor clades and their cumulative trend (Figure 3). We observed major

87

differences in the apparent spread for individual clades: Clade G represents 46.2% of all

88

the sequenced viral sequences, followed by S (25.4%), V (9.4%), I (2.6%) and D (2.1%).

89

The remaining 14.3% were not assigned to a major clade. Clade G is widely distributed in

90

Africa, Europe, West Asia and South America; whereas Clade S represents 63% of North

91

American sampled genomes, and nearly a quarter of those from Oceania. Clade I represents

92

around one-third of genomes derived from South and West Asia, and Oceania. Southeast

93

Asia and South Asia have the greatest number of unassigned genomes (56.9%). For these

94

genomes that cannot be assigned to a major clade, we identified nine minor clades which

95

were named for the amino acid mutation or nucleotide substitution (the latter shown in

96

bold): H (Orf1ab, Q676H); H2 (M, D209H); L2 (N, S194L, we name it L2 to avoid

97

confusion with the previously defined clade8); S2 (N, P344S); G11410A (Orf1ab,

98

G11410A); Y (S, H49Y); C17373A (Orf1ab, C17373A); I2 (Orf1ab, T6136I) and K

99

(Orf1ab, T2016K). The minor clades represent any monoclades with n ≥ 5 which covers

100

3.2% of the total 2,058 cases The global and regional cumulative trends were plotted over

101

time, with the majority of the trends revealing the increasing dominance of one or two

102

clades in each geographic region. For example, the Asian and Oceanian genomes are

103

largely clade I whereas European genomes are predominantly clade G with clade S

104

predominating in North America cases. This is likely attributable to founder effects during

105

the early phases of the seeding of the local epidemics from imported cases and subsequent

106

dissemination in the regions.

107
108

The genetic barcoding method assigns new SARS-CoV-2 cases to clades with high

109

sensitivity.

110

We defined a 10 nucleotide genetic barcode of SARS-CoV-2 that identified with high

111

sensitivity the five major clades of the circulating viral genomes available on March 31st,

112

based on the GISAID data (Figure 4A, Table 1). Given that SARS-CoV-2 evolves at an

113

average rate/genome of nearly 8 x 10-4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year10, and is subject

114

to back-mutations, we further tested the sensitivity and specificity of these clade-defining

115

SNPs, which are all above 90% (Table 1). We then applied the 10 nucleotide barcode to

116

the 4,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes that became available in GISAID between March 31st

117

and April 15th, 2020 in the early stages of the pandemic. Among the 4,000 globally-

118

circulating genomes from 66 countries, we could assign ~96% to one of the 5 major clades

119

(Figure 4B). The remaining unassigned 4% of genomes were typified by either errors in

120

their sequences (such as ‘N’s in the genome assemblies), or single cases those could not be

121

reliably assigned to any of the major clades. The increase in the correct clade assignment

122

for the new genomes compared to the initial validation of the methodology on 2,058

123

genomes (from which the barcode was established) was indicative of the rising dominance

124

of a few major clades, and suggested that the 10 nucleotide barcode will retain its predictive

125

power as new genomes are obtained. While this barcode represents a snapshot of the early

126

phases of the genetic diversity of the virus during the first 16 weeks of its global spread

127

and is expected to change over time, a barcoding strategy to monitor the progress of virus

128

elimination after vaccines become widely available will be strategically useful to monitor

129

decreases in viral genetic diversity. In addition, our barcode could serve as a reference for

130

setting the baseline for global genomic diversity analysis at the beginning of the pandemic.

131
132
133
134

Mutations are not equally distributed across the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Based on our analysis of the 2,058 available genomes from GISAID (March 31th, 2020)
we observed that the genes S, N and Orf3a, accumulated markedly more mutations than

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.054221; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

135

expected solely by random drift (Supplementary Figure 4) (Real/Expected ratio: S: 1.21;

136

N: 1.99; ORF3a: 1.82). This mutation rate may indicate adaptation to the human host

137

following recent spill over from an, as yet unknown, animal reservoir. Conversely, several

138

nonstructural proteins showed a lower-than-expected mutation rate (Real/Expected ratio:

139

nsp1: 0.22; nsp3: 0.77; nsp5: 0.70; nsp7: 0.77: nsp12: 0.88; nsp14: 0.68; nsp15: 0.76).

140

These proteins are predicted to be involved in evading host immune defenses, in enhancing

141

viral expression and in cleavage of the replicase polyprotein, based on prior studies of

142

related betacoronaviruses11,12 . Hence, this lower mutation rate may indicate purification

143

selection to maintain these functions essential for efficient immune evasion and subsequent

144

viral dissemination. Indeed, structural proteins in coronaviruses undergo a greater degree

145

of antigenic variation which increases the fitness of the virus by means of adaptation to the

146

host and by facilitating immune escape13.

147
148

Structural protein modeling confirmed that most of the nonsynonymous mutations in

149

the nonstructural proteins were neutral (Supplementary Figure 5-13). Conversely, several

150

nonsynonymous mutations in the spike protein might have functional consequences:

151

notably, the G clade–defining mutation D614G is located in subdomain 1 (SD1; Figure 5,

152

Supplementary Figure 5). In the trimeric S, D612 engages stabilising interactions within

153

SD1 (R646 or the backbone of F592, depending on the chain) and with the S1 of the

154

adjacent chain (T859 and K854). Replacement of D614 with a glycine would entail losing

155

these stabilising electrostatic interactions and increase the dynamics in this region. Notably,

156

V483A (found in 13 cases in Washington state, USA), V367F (in 6 cases: 5 in Paris, France;

157

1 in Hong Kong) and G476S (in 7 cases: 4 in Washington state, USA; 1 in Idaho state,

158

USA; 1 in Oregon state, USA; and 1 in Braine-l’Alleud, Belgium) are localised in the

159

receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein which mediates binding to the host

160

receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Figure 5)3. All of the viral genomes

161

harbouring

162

mutation has appeared independently in Clade V and Clade S, suggesting that this mutation

163

contributes to viral fitness. We found the V483A substitution in 13 closely-related cases

164

from Washington State. An equivalent amino acid substitution located in a similar position

165

within the RBD in the MERS-CoV spike protein reduces its binding to its cognate receptor

166

DPP4/CD2614 (Supplementary Table 2). However, V483 is more than 10Å away from

167

ACE2 and could affect receptor binding by SARS-CoV-2 only indirectly by altering the

168

structural dynamics of the RBD loop it is a part of. The V367F mutation is located in an

169

even greater distance from ACE2 (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 5D). The exchange of

170

the small hydrophobic residue valine with a bulky hydrophobic phenylalanine might

171

influence the efficiency of glycosylation of the nearby N343, or the positioning of the

172

sugars. The substitution G476S would lead to possible clashes with predicted interacting

173

ACE2 residues and with the RBD residue N487. However, minor reorientation of the side

174

chains might allow an additional hydrogen bond to be formed between S476 and ACE2

175

Q24 and E23, thus enhancing the affinity (Supplementary Figure 5D) to ACE2. An

176

equivalent amino acid substitution located in an analogous position within the RBD in the

177

SARS-CoV spike protein was associated with neutralisation escape from monoclonal

178

antibodies, together with other mutations observed previously15 (Supplementary Table 2).

179

Given that V483A and V367F are solvent exposed and markedly alter the surface

180

characteristics of the RBD, they might also facilitate antibody evasion. Escape mutations

V483A and G476S mutations belong to Clade S. Interestingly, the V367F

181

in the RBD of the SARS-CoV S protein (T332I, F460C and L443R) were identified

182

previously15. These mutations negatively impact viral fitness through reducing the affinity

183

to the host receptor16 (Supplementary Table 2). The nonsynonymous mutations in the N

184

protein, which have key roles in viral assembly, might also have functional implications.

185

The hotspot mutations S202N, R203K and G204R all cluster in a linker region where they

186

might potentially enhance RNA binding and alter the response to serine phosphorylation

187

events (Supplementary Figure 6). The clade I–defining mutation in the nucleocapsid

188

protein, which has key roles in viral assembly, is synonymous. However, we observed

189

nonsynonymous mutations in the nucleocapsid protein that are predicted to have functional

190

implications. The hotspot mutations S202N, R203K and G204R all cluster in a linker

191

region where they might potentially enhance RNA binding and alter the response to serine

192

phosphorylation events (Supplementary Figure 6).

193
194

DISCUSSION

195

In this study, we have defined 5 major clades (G, I, S, D and V) and 9 minor clades

196

(H2, L2, G1110A, H, Y, C17373A, S2, I2 and K) which covers ~89% of the 2,058 high

197

quality genomes available until March 31st in GISAID database. The clustering of these

198

genomes revealed the spread of clades to diverse geographical regions (Figure 1, Figure 3).

199

This pattern contrasts with those observed for other epidemic coronaviruses, such as

200

MERS-CoV, which display distinct geographical clustering17. For example, clade G, which

201

was first detected on January 28th, has reached 40 countries and 130 cities, within a span

202

of 10 weeks (Supplementary Table 1). This pattern demonstrates efficient viral

203

transmission through frequent intercontinental travel during the period when international

204

travel restrictions were only present sporadically, which has enabled the virus to spread to

205

multiple distant locations within a short period of time. This observation reinforces the

206

importance of curtailing international travel and imposing restrictions early in pandemics

207

and imposing social distancing in order to contain the global spread of viruses.

208
209

We have observed a distinct distribution of the major clades in different parts of the

210

world (Figure 3). Most of the viral genomes that have not been assigned to a major clade

211

are found in Asia and have earlier detection times in January and February at the start of

212

the epidemic in China (Supplementary Figure 2). We observed a decrease in the genetic

213

diversity of the virus over time following dissemination from China, especially in Europe

214

and North America that each notably now has a predominant clade type, which we believe

215

to be associated with a founder effect whereby a single clade was introduced and

216

subsequently disseminated (Figure 3). An important caveat of the present study is that the

217

current sampling of available public genomes does likely not represent the extant genetic

218

diversity of virus populations in circulation due to biases of genome data deposits from the

219

sequencing laboratories based mainly in the northern hemisphere and new datasets may

220

define new clades in the near future from regions, including Africa, the Indian subcontinent

221

and Latin America with comparably few genomes available at present. In this case,

222

additional identifiers within an evolving barcode scheme can be added to track and monitor

223

future emerging clades with higher resolution. On the other hand, the genetic stability of

224

SARS-CoV-218 may result in the continuing circulation of a limited number of clades until

225

such time as mitigation measures including the isolation of vulnerable populations and the

226

availability of efficacious antivirals and vaccines reduces the genetic diversity in

227

circulation. This molecular genotyping approach has been demonstrated for other viruses

228

(e.g. measles, poliovirus, rotavirus and human papillomaviruses) with herd-immunity

229

vaccination programmes working to eliminate pathogens from endemic circulation in

230

humans19,20,21,22 . The availability of a barcoding scheme that rapidly generates a SNP

231

allowing clade assignment will be critical in this elimination phase when widespread

232

availability of vaccines permits eradication of SARS-CoV-2 from endemicity in humans.

233
234

Our work provides a baseline global genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 prior to

235

introduction of therapeutic and prophylactic approaches. The mutational landscape of

236

global populations of over SARS-CoV-2 6,000 genomes provides an evidence-based

237

framework for tracking the clades that comprise the pandemic on different continents.

238

However, due to the bias in the representation of countries depositing the SARS-CoV-2

239

genomes with over-representation of North American and European genomes (28.3% and

240

47.2% respectively) and the available genome data representing only a minute proportion

241

of the total COVID-19 positive cases from each of these regions (America, 0.27%; Europe,

242

0.31%; China, 0.31%. Data collected from GISAID9 and COVID-19 dashboard1), the

243

genetic barcode described hererin may need to be updated in order to be globally

244

representative, once sufficient numbers of genomes covering less represented parts of the

245

world are eventually sequenced and deposited to publicly-available database. We envisage

246

a qPCR-based allelic discrimination approach, such as PCR allele competitive extension

247

(PACE), which would enable rapid turnaround in real-time following the identification of

248

a laboratory-confirmed case. This would allow viral genetic epidemiological data to be

249

added to contact tracing information to allow efficient detection of circulating SARS-CoV-

250

2 clades that will allow discrimination of autochthonous and imported clades to aid

251

progressive elimination of the genetic diversity and, ultimately, eradication in all regions.

252

A robust genetic barcoding scheme for SARS-CoV-2 can facilitate this molecular tracking

253

of larger numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and by implementing such a facile

254

genotyping approach upstream of next-generation sequencing will allow whole genome

255

sequencing to be performed on selected cases. This is of particular relevance when the

256

available genomes represent only a small sample of the over 2.5 million total COVID-19

257

cases globally to date.

263

NL63, 521 MERS, 52 HKU1, 170 OC43, 97 bovine coronaviruses and 61 mouse hepatitis

viruses. Sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT(version 7.407)24 software and

265

then trimmed by trimAL(version 1.4.1)25. Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genomes

266

were done with FastTree(version 2.1.10)26 software with default parameters, and

267

iTOL(version 5)27 was used for phylogenetic tree visualisation.

268
269

2,127 complete SARS-CoV2 genomes were downloaded from the GISAID9 (March 31th

270

2020). 69 of those genomes were removed due to poor assembly quality resulting in 2,058

271

complete genomes that were subsequently used for analysis. Sequence alignment was

272

performed with MAFFT(version 7.407)24 and trimmed by trimAL(version 1.4.1)25.

273

Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genomes were performed with RAxML28 (version

274

8.2.12) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, employing the general time-reversible nucleotide

275

substitution model. iTOL(version 5)27 was used for the phylogenetic tree visualisation.

276

SNPs from each of the genomes were called by Parsnp (version 1.2) from the Harvest

277

suite29 using MN908947.3 as the reference genome, and the SNPs were further annotated

278

by SnpEff(version 4.3m)30. The monoclades associated with SNPs with a frequency ≥40

279

were defined as major clades and monoclades associated with SNPs with a frequency ≥5

280

were defined as minor clades.

281
282

Protein Structural Analysis

283

Experimentally determined protein structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank

284

(PDB). SwissModel31, I-Tasser32, RaptorX33 and an in-house modelling pipeline was used

285

to produce protein structure homology models. Phobius34 was used for prediction of trans-

286

membrane regions. RaptorX was also used for predicting secondary structure, protein

287

disorder and solvent exposure of amino acids. Pymol(version 1.8.6.2) was used for

288

visualization.

452

N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3. The structure of this domain can be inferred

453

based on the 79% identical structure of residues 1-112 from SARS-CoV (PDB id 2idy).

454

The substitution A876T can be accommodated with only minor structural adjustments and

455

is not expected to have a substantial influence on the proteins stability or function. (D) The

456

structure shows the nsp12 in complex with nsp7 (magenta) and nsp8 (cyan and teal), based

457

on PDB 7btf. P4720 (P323 in nsp12 numbering) is located in the ‘interface domain’ (black).

458

In this position, the P323L substitution is not predicted to disrupt the folding or protein

459

interactions and hence is not expected to have strong effects. (E) A theoretical model for

460

the Orf3a monomer has been proposed by AlphaFold36. The structure-function relationship

461

of this protein remains to be clarified. The mutation G251V is located C-terminal to the b-

462

sandwich domain and the tail (marked by an asterisk).

480

part of the figure has been enlarged. Most of the genomes that cannot be assigned to any major clade are derived from Asian countries

481

indicative of high genetic diversity in the relatively early stages of the local epidemics and that a founder effect likely explains the

482

observations of single predominant clades in North America and Europe which exhibit a reduction in genetic diversity. These genomes

483

obtained were further analysed and assigned to minor clades. A minor clade was defined with n≥5 cases of SARS-CoV-2 based on

484

phylogenetic and SNP analysis and the events associated with them are indicated by the green arrow. The information contained in the

503

CoV-2 S trimer in its open conformation (chains are cyan, magenta and green) bound to the human receptor ACE2 (black) has been

504

modeled based on PDB accessions 6m17 and 6vyb. Identified nonsynonymous mutations are shown as sphere models. For reasons of

505

visibility only mutations of two of the three S chains are labeled. Memb indicates the membrane. The cytoplasmic tails are depicted in

506

the same colours as the three spike chains. B-E) Magnified regions of the mutations. (B) H49Y: H49 is located in the N-terminal domain

507

(NTD) which is in contact with the sub-domain 2 (SD2) of a symmetry-related molecule. The relative position of NTD and SD2 changes

508

considerably upon going from the closed (grey coloured) to the open state (cyan and magenta). H49 stabilises the rim of the NTD

509

through cation-π-stacking with R44. A tyrosine in position 49 would be able to perform the same role and does not lead to clashes.

510

However, the substitution may slightly alter the stability of this interaction and the interaction between the NTD and SD2, which, in

511

turn, might have subtle effects on the stability and equilibrium of open and closed conformations of S. (C) V367F: V367 is part of the

512

receptor binding domain (RBD), however located too far away from the ACE2-binding site to directly affect receptor binding. V367 is

513

surface exposed, and its substitution would not create clashes with other protein regions. However, the exchange of a small with a bulky

514

hydrophobic residue would alter the surface characteristics of this region, which might influence the efficiency of glycosylation (stick

515

model) of the nearby N343, or the positioning of the sugars. Additionally, the altered RBD surface could potentially interfere with

516

antibody recognition. (D) G476S: G476 is located in the RBD. It is positioned solvent-exposed in a SARS-CoV-2-specific loop. This

517

loop is stabilised by a disulphate bridge (C480:C488; C480 is shown as stick model). In the open, ACE2-bound conformation of the

518

RBD, G476 is close to ACE2 Q24 and E23. The substitution G476S would lead to light clashes with these ACE2 residues (indicated as

519

red spheres) and with the RBD residues N487. However, minor reorientation of the side chains might allow an additional hydrogen bond

520

to be formed between S476 and ACE2 Q24 and E23, thus enhancing the affinity. (E) V483A: V483 is also located in the RBD, solvent-

521

exposed in the same SARS-CoV-2-specific loop as G476 (C480:C488 are shown as stick models). In the open, ACE2-bound

522

conformation of the RBD, V483 is more than 10Å away from the ACE2 receptor, and hence does not contribute to direct binding or

523

stability. In the closed conformation, this loop is not modeled in the EM structures (PDB 6vyb), inferring it is flexible in the absence of

524

ACE2. Superimposition of the ACE2-bound conformation of the RBD onto RBDs in a closed conformation shows that this loop region

525

would stick out into the solvent. Substitution of V483 is consequently not predicted to have a strong impact on receptor binding or

526

protein stability. By lowering the hydrophobic surface, this substitution might however reduce the non-specific stickiness of this loop

527

region, and/or affect binding of antibodies. (F) D614G: D614 is located in the SD1. In the trimeric S, D612 engages stabilising

528

interactions within the SD1 (R646 or the backbone of F592, depending on the chain) and with the S1 of the adjacent chain (T859 and

529

K854). Replacement of D614 with a glycine would entail losing these stabilising interactions and increase the dynamics in this region.

530

(G) V1040F: V1040 is located in a loop region that makes hydrophobic contacts between stalk regions of the spike trimer. The V1040F

531

substitution is possible without steric hindrance, and would slightly increase the hydrophobic contacts between the chains. The other

532

mutations are not shown in detail, but are evaluated as follows. M153T: M153 is located in the NTD in a solvent-exposed loop. N

533

electron density was modeled for this loop in the cryo-EM structure (6vyb) suggesting it is flexible. The substitution is expected to be

534

neutral. S940F: S940 is located in the stalk region, in a solvent-exposed turn. Introducing the bulkier phenylalanine in this position

535

would not destabilise the structure but locally change the surface characteristics. C1254F: C1254 is the last cysteine in a cysteine-rich

536

unstructured short cytoplasmic region. This region is required for efficient membrane fusion. The exact mechanism remains to be

537

elucidated, and hence we cannot assess the exact impact of the C1254F mutation.

Supplementary Figure 6. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. The SARS-

541

CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) compacts the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid and

542

hence has key roles in viral assembly1. N contains two folded domains, the N-terminal and

543

the dimeric C-terminal domain (NTD; blue, and CTD; green, respectively). Both domains

544

are flanked by flexible regions, namely a flexible linker between them (LKR, underlined

545

in the bottom panel sequence) and ~40 residue intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) as

546

tails. The NTD and CTD are RNA-binding regions, but the LKR and IDRs also affect

547

RNA-binding of N2. The LKR contains a serine-arginine (SR)-rich region, which

548

contributes to RNA binding and N oligomerization. The arginines may promote RNA-

549

binding through electrostatic interactions, whereas the serines are putative phosphorylation

550

sites that would counteract RNA binding and possibly favour oligomerisation upon

551

phosphorylation3. The hotspot mutations S202N, R203K and G204R are all within the SR

552

region of the LKR. S202N would delete a putative phosphorylation site. Given the large

553

number of alternative serine phosphorylation sites, and the presence of many asparagines

554

within the linker, this S/N substitution might not have a very strong influence. The

555

homologous substitution R203K is also expected to have only minor effects. G204R might

556

increase binding to RNA, and/or affect other homo- or heterologous interactions. In

557

summary, the substitutions might potentially enhance RNA binding and alter the response

558

to serine phosphorylation events. The structural figure consists of homology models for

559

the NTD and CTD, linked by arbitrary but stereochemically-plausible linker regions.

Supplementary Figure 7. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab, nsp12: The nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase forms a complex

563

with one nsp7 and two nsp8, which markedly enhances its polymerase activity4. The shown SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 structure is composed

564

of a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension (pale yellow), a linker domain (black) and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)

565

domain (grey). The structure shows the nsp12 in complex with nsp7 (magenta) and nsp8 (cyan and teal), based on PDB 7btf. (A) A4494

566

(A97 in nsp12 numbering; shown as a blue sphere models) is located in the N-terminal extension of the polymerase5,6. A4494 is sealing

567

the hydrophobic core of the N-terminal lobe, and its side chain is not solvent exposed. Its replacement with the hydrophobic but slightly

568

bigger valine (yellow) only leads to minor clashes (small red discs) that would not have a significant impact on the function or stability.

569

(B) P4720 (P323 in nsp12 numbering) is located in the ‘interface domain’ (black). In this position, the P323L substitution (yellow) is

570

not predicted to disrupt the folding or protein interactions and hence is not expected to have strong effects. (C) A4846V (residue A449

571

in nsp12 numbering; blue) is located in the finger domain, with its side chain pointing inwards, contributing to a hydrophobic interaction

572

with the adjacent beta strand. The substitution of A4846 by a valine (yellow) is tolerated in this context. Leading only to minor clashes,

573

it might slightly improve the stability of this region. (D) H5269 (H872 in nsp12 numbering; blue) is located in the thumb domain. It is

574

at the tip of a solvent exposed turn, where its replacement by a tyrosine (yellow) would be tolerated without functional impact.

575

Nsp7: S2884 and Q3890 (S25 and Q31 in nsp7 numbering; both in light yellow) are solvent exposed on a helix that makes contact with

576

both nsp8 and nsp12. (E) S25 is capping the N-terminal end of this helix. Its substitution with a leucine (yellow) does not cause steric

577

problems, but would lead to loss of the capping hydrogen bond. However, D163 from one of the nsp8 molecules also performs a capping

578

function in the complex, and hence S25L would only have a slightly destabilising effect. (F) Q31 is located on the surface of the helix.

579

Although Q31 is close to nsp8, its substitution with a histidine (yellow) would not influence this interaction measurably.

580

Nsp8: Only T4031 (T89I in nsp8 numbering; red) is included in the structural model. In both nsp8 molecules, T89 is located solvent

581

exposed on a helix. In neither of the two nsp8 molecules would the substitution T89I create steric problem or affect the interaction with

582

nsp12 or nsp7.

583
584

Supplementary Figure 8. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab, nsp13: P1427L and Y1464C are both in the helicase nsp13, which

585

catalyses the unwinding of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands. Both residues are located on the same side of the 2A domain of

586

the helicase. The 2A and adjacent 1A domains coordinate together to complete the final unwinding process. The helicase has been

587

modelled based on the 99.8% identical SARS nsp13 (PDB id 6jyt). The domains 1A and 2A are coloured in blue and cyan, respectively.

588

The residues involved in NTP binding are shown in orange. Residues on domain 2A that are involved in RNA binding are shown in

589

magenta. The other domains are grey. Left: overview of the complete structure. Key residues are shown as sphere models. Right: zoom

590

into the mutated area. Key residues are shown as stick models. For Y1464 the in silico mutated cysteine is shown in white. P1427 is

591

located in a solvent-exposed loop region that has not yet reported to be involved in nucleotide binding. Its substitution with a leucine is

592

not expected to create noticeable effects. Y1464 is part of a region that contributes to binding and unwinding of duplex oligonucleotides7.

593

Its substitution by a cysteine would decrease the stability and enhance the dynamics of this particular region, and might affect RNA

594

binding and processing.

596

Supplementary Figure 9. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a: nsp2.

597

No experimental structure of sufficiently close homologue is known for nsp2. This structural analysis is therefore based on the proposed

598

theoretical AlphaFold model. (A) Shown is a model for residues 180-534, colour ramped from blue to yellow. T265 and G392 are shown

599

as blue sphere models. (B) T265 (blue stick model, corresponding to residue T58 in the nsp2 cleavage product numbering) is located at

600

the tip of a loop that is pinned to the core of the N-terminal domain (blue) via hydrophobic residues (two phenylalanines are shown as

601

stick models). Being exposed to the solvent, the T265I substitution (shown in yellow) is not expected to have significant impact on

602

protein fold or function. (C) G392 (G212 in nsp2 numbering; shown in blue) is placed in a solvent accessible loop, according to the

603

AlphaFold model. In this position even the non-conservative substitution with an aspartic acid (yellow) is not predicted to have

604

significant impact on protein fold or function. (D) V378 is located in a surface exposed loop. Its substitution by an isoleucine will not

605

create steric clashes, nor lead to loss of hydrophobic interactions. (E) A second nsp2 fragment is shown, colour ramped from yellow to

606

red, comprising residues 618 to 818. I793 is shown as blue sphere model. (F) I739V (I559 in nsp2 numbering; shown in blue) is part of

607

a hydrophobic core of a small C-terminal domain. Its substitution with an only slightly smaller hydrophobic valine (yellow) would only

608

have insignificant destabilising effects on this region.

610

Supplementary Figure 10. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a: nsp3. The substitution A876T (corresponding to residue A58 in the

611

nsp3 cleavage product numbering) is situated in the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3. (A) The structure of this domain can be

612

inferred based on the 79% identical structure of residues 1-112 from SARS-CoV (PDB id 2idy). Helices are coloured in cyan, strands

613

in magenta and loops in pale orange. A876 is shown as blue sphere model. (B) Zoom onto A876. A876 (blue stick model) is placed

614

within a helix, engaging hydrophobic contacts with Y905 (stick model). The substitution into a slightly larger threonine (yellow stick

615

model) can be accommodated with only minor structural adjustments (clashes are shown as red spheres) and hence the A876T mutation

616

is not expected to have a substantial influence on the proteins stability and function. (C) L1599F is located in the papain-like protease.

617

The structure (grey) has been modelled based on the ~83% identical SARS-CoV structures in complex with ubiquitin (Ub, cyan, based

618

on 4m0w). L1599 is remote from the active site in the Ubl domain. (D) Its substitution does not lead to clashes and is expected to be

619

neutral in terms of function and protein stability. No templates have been identified for V378I.

621
622

Supplementary Figure 11. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a: nsp6. L3606 (corresponding to residue L37 in the nsp6 cleavage

623

product) is a multi-pass transmembrane protein for which no experimental structure of sufficiently close homologue is known. This

624

structural analysis is therefore based on the proposed theoretical AlphaFold model (Left). Helices are colored in cyan, loops in pale

625

orange. L3606 is shown as blue sphere model. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane is shown in orange; lumen and cytoplasmic sides

626

are indicated. Right: close-up view of the location of L3606 (shown as blue stick model). L3606 is located in a predicted helical region

627

that is partly submerged in the membrane, lying parallel to its luminal surface. According to the structural model, L3606 is exposed to

628

the membrane, and hence its substitution with a larger but still hydrophobic phenylalanine would not impact structure or function.

629
630

Supplementary Figure 12. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a. ORF3a is a viroporin that forms a pentameric potassium-sensitive ion

631

channel. ORF3a activates the inflammasome which facilitates viral release and aggravates disease symptoms8. ORF3a contains a 3-pass

632

a-helical TM region (cyan in left panel, and greyed regions in TM prediction, right panel) and a domain predicted to have a b-sandwich

633

fold (magenta; see also middle panel and right panel). The ORF3a N- and C-terminal tails are predicted to be disordered (middle panel,

634

top). A theoretical model for the Orf3a monomer has been proposed by AlphaFold9. The structure-function relationship of this protein

635

remains to be clarified. The mutation G251V is located C-terminal to the b-sandwich domain and the tail (marked by an asterisk). In

636

this position, the substitution is not expected to affect the protein fold or function significantly.

Supplementary Figure 13. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. ORF8 has an N-terminal

642

sec-pathway signal peptide with a cleavage site after residue 15, suggesting that it is

643

secreted into the extracellular space. Following signal peptide cleavage, the ORF8 protein

644

core is predicted to consist largely of b-strands and features seven cysteines (top panel).

645

We predict that this protein adopts a cysteine disulfide-bond stabilised b-sandwich

646

structure inferring that ORF8 also functions as a ligand binding module. Homology

647

modeling or ab initio servers failed to produce a model consistent with the proteins’

648

secondary structure predictions. V62 and L84 are predicted to be partially solvent-exposed

649

(bottom), and located at the end (V62) or in the middle (L84) of secondary structural

650

elements (depending on the prediction server, the region surrounding V62 is predicted as

651

strand or helix; L84 is in a b strand). Hence, we can only speculate that the mutations V62L

652

and L84S might have little effect on the stability of the disulphate-stabilised fold, but might

653

have minor (or no) effects on ligand binding.
