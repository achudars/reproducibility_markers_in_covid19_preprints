refocus an existing neutralizing antibody to a related but resistant virus. Using a rapid affinity

31

maturation strategy, we engineered CR3022, a SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibody, to bind SARS-

32

CoV-2 receptor binding domain with >1000-fold improved affinity. The engineered CR3022

33

neutralized SARS-CoV-2 and provided prophylactic protection from viral challenge in a small

34

animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Deep sequencing throughout the engineering process

35

paired with crystallographic analysis of an enhanced antibody elucidated the molecular

36

mechanisms by which engineered CR3022 can accommodate sequence differences in the

37

epitope between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. The workflow described provides a blueprint

38

for rapid broadening of neutralization of an antibody from one virus to closely related but resistant

39

viruses.

INTRODUCTION

41

Following the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

42

CoV-2), a massive effort was initiated to repurpose existing or discover new antibodies against

43

SARS-CoV-2 to use as research tools, diagnostics, and as direct medical countermeasures for

44

prophylactic and therapeutic indications. Early repurposing efforts screened monoclonal

45

antibodies that had previously been isolated from 2003 SARS-CoV-1 (sometimes designated as

46

SARS-CoV) and 2008 MERS-CoV survivors against SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 2020), but none of

47

the existing antibodies were able to efficiently neutralize this novel virus. In parallel, multiple

48

groups worked to isolate antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected humans or from animals

49

immunized with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins (Hansen et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020; Pinto et al.,

50

2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Although various approaches

51

were used in the antibody discovery process, most utilized an antigen-specific B cell sorting

52

strategy to isolate binding antibodies followed by an in vitro neutralization assay to identify the

53

neutralizing subset. This antibody discovery process has been widely used to identify HIV

54

neutralizing antibodies and extensively refined and streamlined over the last decade to the point

55

where it is possible to progress from biological samples to recombinantly produced antibodies

56

ready for validation in 1-2 weeks (Huang et al., 2013, 2014; Rogers et al., 2020; Sok et al., 2014).

57

The two major bottlenecks in this process currently are: 1) access to high quality peripheral blood

58

mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for antigen-specific B cell sorting and 2) the identification of

59

lead therapeutic candidates that have both the desired neutralization function and biochemical

60

developability properties that are amenable to large-scale manufacturing and formulation. Access

61

to PBMCs was particularly onerous in the very early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak when donor

62

samples were not available in the United States and Europe because of shipping and/or biosafety

63

restrictions.

64

Here we explore a hybrid “refocusing” approach that is a blend between conventional

65

discovery and repurposing, where an existing neutralizing antibody is engineered to target a

66

related, but resistant virus. As a case study, we selected CR3022, a SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing

67

monoclonal antibody isolated in 2006 from a convalescent donor (ter Meulen et al., 2006). At the

68

onset of the pandemic, CR3022 received considerable attention because it was shown to cross-

69

react with SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 2020). Several groups tested whether CR3022 could

70

neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and most observed either no neutralization or only partial neutralization

71

at the highest antibody concentration (Anand et al., 2020; Atyeo et al., 2021; Manenti et al., 2020;

72

Wu et al., 2020b; Yuan et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020), although one group did report neutralizing

73

activity in their assay (Huo et al., 2020). A crystal structure revealed that CR3022 recognizes an

74

epitope outside of the ACE2 binding site that is highly conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and

75

SARS-CoV-2 (Yuan et al., 2020a) with only four amino acid differences located in or around the

76

CR3022 epitope. Reversion of one of these four mutations, P384A, was shown to be responsible

77

for the 100-fold reduction in binding affinity for CR3022 to the novel SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al.,

78

2020a). These findings are consistent with other documented examples of viral escape from

79

neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), where small changes in the antibody epitope are sufficient to

80

reduce antibody binding below the requisite threshold to achieve effective neutralization (Bates

81

et al., 2014). To address this, we wanted to explore whether engineering approaches can be used

82

to retarget the SARS-CoV-1 nAb CR3022 to the corresponding epitope on SARS-CoV-2.

83

RESULTS

84

Engineering of SARS-CoV-1 nAb CR3022 to efficiently recognize SARS-CoV-2

85

To engineer CR3022 variants with higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we utilized a

86

rapid antibody affinity maturation strategy that we developed called Synthetic Antibody Maturation

87

by multiple Point Loop library EnRichments (SAMPLER). Libraries are generated around a

88

starting antibody sequence by introducing single mutations within the complementarity-

89

determining region (CDR) loops. These variant libraries are then displayed on the surface of yeast

90

as molecular Fab and screened with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate clones

91

with improved affinity for the target antigen (Figure 1A). During the library generation, the diversity

92

is introduced into the CDR loops using predefined oligo pools (Li et al., 2018), where each

93

mutation is explicitly synthesized so the library is free of unwanted mutations like cysteines or

94

methionines and mutations that would introduce N-linked glycan motifs. Each CDR loop library

95

contains 100-200 unique variants, depending on the length of the loop, and when the CDR1/2/3

96

libraries are combined, the resulting combinatorial library contains 3-4 million unique sequences,

97

each with up to 3 mutations from the parental CR3022 heavy chain (HC) or light chain (LC)

98

sequence (Figure 1A). This strategy efficiently samples a large theoretical search space around

99

the starting antibody sequence and allows for the screening of synergistic mutations between

100

CDR loops, as it has been shown that affinity enhancing mutations can be destabilizing and

101

require compensatory stabilizing mutations (Julian et al., 2017). Overall, this rational CDR

102

synthesis reduces the theoretical diversity by 6-fold compared to using NNK by removing the

103

redundancy of the overrepresented amino acids and removing unwanted mutations (Table S1).

104

Initially, two libraries were generated—one library with mutations in the HC paired with

105

unmodified LC (HC library) and one library with mutations in the LC that was paired with the

106

unmodified HC (LC library) and displayed on the surface of yeast (Figure 1A). Each library was

107

sorted four times against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) to enrich for variants with

108

higher affinity for the protein (Figure S1). In sorts 1, 2 and 4, cells were labeled with non-saturating

109

concentrations of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the top 5-10% of RBD-binding cells,

110

normalized for Fab surface display, were collected to enrich for HC or LC sequences with

111

increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure S2). In sort 3, a negative selection was used to

112

deplete polyreactive clones, where cells were labeled with a biotinylated preparation of detergent

113

solubilized HEK293 membrane proteins (Figure S1) (Xu et al., 2013). After the four selections,

114

the antibody display vectors from the HC and LC libraries were harvested and the region encoding

115

the heavy and light chain was amplified and combined into a new combinatorial heavy and light

116

chain library (H/L library) that sampled diversity in both chains (Figure 1A). The H/L library was

117

screened with the same four-round selection protocol to identify the optimal combination of

118

mutations in the heavy and light chains. In total, it took just under one month to complete all three

119

rounds of SAMPLER optimization (Figure S1).

120

Following each round of SARS-CoV-2 selection, plasmid DNA encoding the HC and LC

121

regions was amplified and deep sequenced. The HC library showed a strong preference for an

122

S55G mutation (Kabat numbering) in CDRH2, appearing in 57% of sequences after sort 1 and

123

98% of sequences after sort 4 (Figure 1B). In CDRH3, an S96G mutation was observed in 36%

124

of sequences. The mutations in CDRH1 were largely localized to the F29 and T31 positions, with

125

65% and 33% enriched mutation frequency respectively, but multiple mutations were allowed at

126

each one of those positions. The LC library showed strong enrichment for a tyrosine to tryptophan

127

mutation at position Y27d residue in CDRL1, enriching to 52% of the total reads after sort 4 (Figure

128

1B). CDRL2 and CDRL3 showed no strong enrichments across any of the selections.

129

In the combinatorial H/L library, three mutations were further enriched in CR3022 HC: 98%

130

T31W in CDRH1, 99% of S55G in CDRH2, and 100% S96G in CDRH3 (Figure S3). Nevertheless,

131

the LC remained more diverse in the H/L library, with the Y to W mutation further enriched to 71%

132

of the population at the Y27d position (Figure S3). In addition to deep sequencing of the individual

133

chains, PacBio sequencing was used to evaluate the recovered heavy/light pairs from sort 4. The

134

overall frequencies of mutations closely matched what was observed in the individual chains, with

135

a high degree of convergence on the heavy chain and a significant level of diversity still present

136

in the light chain, with no clear evidence of evolutionary coupling within the selected H/L chain

137

pairings (Figure 1C).

138

Binding and neutralizing activity of eCR3022 for SARS-CoV-2

139

From the sequences recovered after the final H/L library sort, we selected 25 engineered

140

CR3022 antibodies, named engineered (e) eCR3022.1 through eCR3022.25, to reformat for

141

expression as human IgG1 for in-depth characterization. Because of the nature of how the H/L

142

library was constructed and the fact that there was more observed convergence in the HC, the

143

selected variants utilized only 5 unique HCs, while all 25 LCs were unique (Table S2). The

144

affinities for SARS-CoV-1 RBD of all eCR3022 Abs remained the same or slightly improved

145

compared to the parental CR3022, despite not having been included in the optimization process

146

(Figures 2A, 2B; Table S2). The binding affinities of all eCR3022 antibodies against monomeric

147

SARS-CoV-2 RBD increased between 100 to 1000-fold compared to the parental CR3022 by

148

surface plasmon resonance (SPR), with equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values ranging

149

from 16 pM to 312 pM (Figures 2A, 2C; Table S2). The on-rate of the antibodies was nearly the

150

same as the parental CR3022, with the affinity increases coming through a reduction in the

151

antibody off-rate (Figure 2C, Table S2). The ELISA binding activities of the eCR3022 variants

152

against SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD were also improved (Figure S4), showing that this increased

153

binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD also translated to the functional S protein. All engineered antibodies

154

showed negligible polyreactive binding across our nonspecific antigen panels (Figure S5A, S5B)

155

and were monodispersed with analytical SEC column retention times similar to other clinical mAbs

156

(Figure S5C), indicating the engineering had minimal impact on the favorable biochemical

157

properties of the parental CR3022.

158

To evaluate the effect of the affinity gains on antibody neutralization, CR3022 and all 25

159

eCR3022 variants were tested using an MLV-based pseudovirus system (Rogers et al., 2020).

160

All variants showed enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-1, with the most potent neutralizing at

161

0.5 µg/mL compared to the parental CR3022 that neutralizes at 10.9 µg/mL (Figures 2D, 2E). In

162

our assay, CR3022 failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at a maximum antibody concentration of 100

163

µg/mL (Figures 2D, 2F). In contrast, all eCR3022 antibodies were able to neutralize pseudotyped

164

SARS-CoV-2 with a median IC50 of 1.6 µg/mL, with the most potent neutralizing SARS-CoV-2

165

exhibiting an IC50 of 0.3 µg/mL (Figures 2D, 2F). We further tested the neutralization activity of

166

eCR3022.7, eCR3022.10 and eCR3022.20 against the emerging variants of concern B.1.1.7 (with

167

N501Y mutation on RBD) and B.1.351 (with K417N, E484K, N501Y mutations on RBD) variants

168

(Tegally et al.), where the mutations are located in the receptor binding site on the RBD and are

169

outside the CR3022 epitope. As expected, eCR3022 antibodies neutralized both viral variants

170

with similar IC50 to the wildtype virus SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S6). Lastly, the eCR3022 variants were

171

able to neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus while CR3022 failed to neutralize, confirming the

172

neutralization against authentic virus (Figure S7).

173

Structural analysis of eCR3022.20 complexed to SARS-CoV-2 RBD

174

To understand the molecular features of the affinity-matured eCR3022 antibodies that

175

confer potent neutralization against SARS-CoV-2, we determined a crystal structure of

176

eCR3022.20 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Fab CC12.3 (Yuan et al., 2020b) (to aid in

177

crystallization) to 2.85 Å resolution and compared its binding with CR3022 (Yuan et al., 2020a)

178

(Figure 3A; Figure S8; Table S3). Two copies of the eCR3022.20–RBD–CC12.3 complex were

179

found in the crystal asymmetric unit. eCR3022.20 binds SARS-CoV-2 RBD via the same epitope

180

as CR3022 through a nearly identical angle of approach (Yuan et al., 2020a) (Figure 3A).

181

Furthermore, the RBD conformation bound by both antibodies are almost identical, except for two

182

regions of the RBD (residues 365-370 and 384-390) that are displaced in eCR3022.20 compared

183

to CR3022 (Figure 3B). However, residues in both of these regions (RBD-Y369, F377, and P384)

184

form a hydrophobic pocket that interact with CDRH1 of these antibodies (Figures 3C-3F). VH T31

185

in CDRH1 of CR3022 (Figure 3C) is substituted by a bulky hydrophobic, aromatic residue W31,

186

which stacks with RBD residues Y369, F377, and P384 and strengthens the interaction with this

187

hydrophobic pocket in the RBD (Figures 3D, 3E). The T31W substitution induces a 2.4-Å shift in

188

the RBD around residues 365-370, as well as a 1.4-Å shift of residues 384-390 (Figure 3F).

189

Previously, we showed that residue 384 is an important epitope residue for CR3022 binding,

190

where a P384A mutation conferred an approximate 100-fold affinity improvement for CR3022 (Wu

191

et al., 2020a). Here, we show that a substitute paratope residue targeting this area of the epitope

192

is able to contribute to an improvement in antibody binding and further highlights the importance

193

of P384 as a key epitope residue for CR3022.

194

In addition to CDRH1, CDRH2 of both CR3022 and eCR3022.20 interact with SARS-CoV-

195

2 RBD (Figures 3G, 3H). For both antibodies, VH Y52 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone

196

amide of RBD-F377. VH D54 and E56 clamp onto RBD-K378 with two salt bridges (Figures 3G,

197

3H). CDRH2 in both antibodies form a type-IV β (Lewis et al., 1973) at the CDR tip, where VH S55

198

(i+3) in CR3022 is substituted by a glycine in most sorted antibody variants during the process of

199

affinity maturation (Figure 1B; Figure S9). Glycine is frequently found in β turns due to the lack of

200

a side chain that allows higher conformational flexibility. Indeed, glycine is the most frequent

201

residue at the i+3 position of a type-IV β turn, suggesting that it is energetically favored at this

202

position as it can also more readily adopt a positive phi value as found here compared to S55

203

(Guruprasad and Rajkumar, 2000). For the light-chain residues, VL Y31 and S99 are mutated to

204

W31 and K99 in eCR3022.20 (Figures 3I, 3J). While VL W31 retains hydrophobic interactions with

205

RBD-Y380, P412, and F429, VL K99 is able to form a cation-π interaction with W31, which

206

stabilizes the interaction between CDRs L1 and L3 and may reduce the entropy of its interaction

207

with the RBD.

208

Protection by eCR3022 against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a small animal model

209

Upon developing a CR3022 variant capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, we sought to

210

evaluate whether this engineered antibody could provide prophylactic protection against viral

211

challenge in the Syrian hamster model. Based on the neutralization and biophysical data,

212

eCR3022.7 was selected as our initial candidate antibody to evaluate. Groups of six hamsters

213

received an intraperitoneal infusion 10 mg, 2 mg, 0.5 mg, or 0.125 mg of eCR3022.7 per animal

214

to evaluate dose-dependent protection. Another group received 10 mg of the parental CR3022

215

antibody and a control group received 10 mg of an anti-dengue isotype matched antibody. Three

216

days post infusion, sera were collected from each animal to determine antibody titer at the time

217

of viral challenge. Animals were then challenged with 1 x 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of SARS-

218

CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) by intranasal administration. The hamsters were weighed daily as a

219

measure of disease due to infection and sera were collected from all animals at the conclusion of

220

the experiment on day 7. Hamsters have been shown to clear SARS-CoV-2 infection after 7 days

221

(Sia et al., 2020), so a replicate of the original experiment was performed with six additional

222

animals in which lung tissue was collected on day 4 to accurately measure replicative viral load

223

amongst the groups (Figure 4A).

224

The groups receiving the highest doses of eCR3022.7 of 10 mg or 2 mg were largely

225

protected from viral challenge, exhibiting either no weight loss or 3% weight loss, respectively, at

226

the end of the 7-day experiment (Figure 4B; Figure S10). In contrast, the group that received 10

227

mg of the original CR3022 antibody lost 11% of body weight, comparable to the control group that

228

received 10 mg of Den3. The groups that received 0.5 mg or 0.125 mg eCR3022.7 on average

229

lost slightly less weight than the control group but the difference was not significant (Table S4).

230

Lung viral titers were assessed from the second group of animals by plaque assay (Figure 4C).

231

Equivalent viral loads were measured between the control Den3 and original CR3022 groups with

232

average of 4.0 x 106 PFU/mL and 6.8 x 105 PFU/mL, respectively (Table S4). In contrast, the

233

groups that received 10 mg or 2 mg doses of eCR3022.7 had 7.0 x 104 PFU/mL and 8.7 x 104

234

PFU/mL, respectively, more than 2 logs lower than the Den3 control. The reduced SARS-CoV-2

235

viral lung titers and maintenance of body weight following challenge in the animals receiving either

236

10 mg or 2 mg doses prophylactically of eCR3022.7 demonstrate that the in vitro neutralization

237

potency translates to in vivo protection. Serum antibody concentrations were measured both at

238

the time of challenge and the end of the study. The 10 mg eCR0322.7 and 10 mg CR3022 groups

239

had an equivalent amount of antibody present at the time of injection as well as equivalent decay

240

by day 7, confirming that the observed protection differences are not attributable to different

241

pharmacokinetic properties of the two antibodies (Figure 4D, Figure S10B).

242

DISCUSSION

243

Antibody refocusing serves as a novel approach to generate neutralizing antibodies

244

against novel viruses or viral variants, provided that a neutralizing antibody against a closely

245

related virus is available. In this case study, we successfully re-engineered a SARS-CoV-1 nAb,

246

CR3022, so that it now potently neutralized both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. eCR3022

247

variants with >1000-fold enhanced affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD were generated while

248

maintaining their biochemically favorable developability profile. The enhanced affinity conferred

249

the ability to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and protect from viral challenge in a small animal

250

model. In fact, the eCR3022 variants now neutralize SARS-CoV-2 more potently than the parental

251

CR3022 neutralizes SARS-CoV-1. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing

252

a relationship between antibody/antigen binding affinity for S protein and neutralization potency.

253

However, this is the first instance that we are aware of where an antibody has been specifically

254

retargeted or optimized to a novel related virus. Although this refocusing strategy likely will not be

255

effective when the antibody epitope is substantially different between viruses (Figure S11), the

256

potential pool of starting antibodies continues to expand as more neutralizing antibodies are

257

discovered against different viruses. We also note that the use of on-chip DNA synthesis to

258

rationally produce the CDR libraries used in our SAMPLER optimization allowed us to efficiently

259

cover a large portion of the theoretical search space within the antibody paratope, effectively

260

achieving these affinity gains in a two-step process. Given that the affinity engineering described

261

can be done in less than one month and does not require access to PBMC samples from

262

immunized or infected donors or structural information on the antibody/antigen interaction, the

263

approach could be used in conjunction with conventional antibody discovery as a rapid response

264

to future outbreaks of pandemic concern.

459

engineered mAb eCR3022.7 was administered at a starting dose of either 10 mg per animal, 2

460

mg per animal, 0.5 mg per animal or 0.125 mg per animal. Control animals received 10 mg of

461

Den3 or 10 mg of original mAb CR3022. Each group of 12 animals was challenged intranasally

462

(i.n.) 72 hours after infusion with 1 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Serum was collected at the time

463

of challenge (day 0) and upon completion of the experiment (day 7). Animal weight was monitored

464

as an indicator of disease progression. Six hamsters were sacrificed on day 4 and lung tissue

465

MATERIALS AND METHODS

596

Antibody library generation

597

CR3022 heavy chain and light chain affinity maturation libraries were synthesized by Twist

598

Bioscience (San Francisco). Mutations were included in the CDR loops, based on the following

599

definitions: CDRH1 = GYGFITYWI, CDRH2 = IIYPGDSET, CDRH3 = GGSGISTPMDV, CDRL1

600

= VLYSSINKNYL, CDRL2 = IYWASTRE, CDRL3 = QQYYSTPY. At each position in the CDR

601

loop, mini libraries were synthesized that encoded all possible single mutations from the starting

602

sequence, excluding variants where the substitution was to a cysteine or methionine and variants

603

that created an N-linked glycosylation motif. The CDR1/2/3 mini-libraries were assembled into

604

combinatorial heavy chain and light chain libraries.

605

The libraries were displayed on the surface of yeast as molecular Fab using the pYDSI vector, a

606

yeast display vector containing the bidirectional Gal1-10 promoter that was based on the design

607

of a previously described vector (Wang et al., 2018), omitting the leucine-zipper dimerization

608

domains. The heavy chain contains a C-terminal V5 epitope tag and the light chain contains a C-

609

terminal C-myc epitope tag to assess the amount of Fab displayed on the surface of the yeast.

610

The HC library was generated by cloning the HC CDR1/2/3 library into a vector already containing

611

the invariant CR3022 light chain by homologous recombination, and the LC library was generated

612

by doing the inverse. The HC/LC library was generated by amplifying the HC and LC sequences

613

with primers overlapping in the Gal1-10 promoter. The recovered Gal-HC and Gal-LC fragments

614

were ligated via Gibson assembly and amplified. The resulting LC-Gal1-10-HC product was

615

cloned into empty pYDSI by homologous recombination.

616
617

Yeast transformation

618

Yeast transformation was performed as described previously. In brief, the colony of

619

Saccharomyces cerevisiae YVH10 cells (ATCC, MYA4940) was inoculated in 2mL YPD medium

620

(Dissolve 20 g dextrose, 20 g peptone and 10 g yeast extract in deionized H2O to a volume of 1

621

liter and sterilize by filtration) and shaken overnight at 30°C. The overnight culture was expanded

622

in 50 mL YPD medium and shaken at 30°C until the absorbance was around 1.5 at 600 nm. Yeast

623

cells were spun down and resuspended with 25 mL of 100 mM lithium acetate. 250 µL of 1 M

624

DTT was added to the cells and mixed rapidly. After shaking at 30°C for 10 min, cells were spun

625

down and washed with 25 mL of pre-chilled deionized H2O. After centrifuge, the cell pellet was

626

suspended with pre-chilled deionized H2O to a final volume of 500 µL. After this step, yeast cells

627

were electrocompetent and ready for transformation.

628

1 µg of linearized vector DNA was mixed with 5 ug of insert library DNA in an Eppendorf tube on

629

ice. 250 µL of electrocompetent cells were transferred to the tube and incubated for 10 min on

630

ice. Then the cells and DNA mixture were transferred to cuvette and inserted into Gene Pulser

631

Xcell Electroporation System (Biorad) using following settings:

632

Square wave

633

Voltage = 500 V

634

Pulse length = 15.0 ms

635

# pulses = 1

636

Pulse interval = 0

637

Cuvette = 2 mm

638

After electrophoresis, cells were shocked by immediately adding 1 mL of pre-warmed YPD

639

medium. Cells were then transferred to a 50 mL tube for outgrowth. After shaking 200 rpm at

640

30°C for 1 h, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in synthetic drop-out medium without

641

tryptophan (with 1 % Penicillin/Streptomycin) and shaken overnight to grow.

642
643

Yeast library labeling and sorting

644

After yeast transformation, yeast cells were expanded and split once for better display efficiency.

645

Before staining, cells were induced overnight at 30°C by SGCAA induction medium (dissolve 20

646

g galactose, 1 g glucose, 6.7 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acid, 5 g bacto casamino acids,

647

5.4 g Na2HPO4, 8.56 g NaH2PO4!"2O, 8.56 mg uracil to 1 L deionized water, pH 6.5, and sterilize

648

by filtration). For each library, in the first round of selection, 5 x 107 of yeast cells were stained per

649

sample. In the second to final round of selection, 1 x 107 cells were stained. Yeast cells were

650

firstly spun down and washed with PBS/1% BSA, then incubated with biotinylated SARS-CoV-2

651

RBD or S or HEK cell membrane protein at several non-depleting concentrations respectively for

652

at least 30 min at 4°C. After washing, yeast cells were stained with FITC-conjugated chicken anti-

653

C-Myc antibody (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, CMYC-45F), AF405-conjugated anti-V5

654

antibody (made in house), and streptavidin-APC (Invitrogen, SA1005) in 1:100 dilution for 20 min

655

at 4 °C. After washing, yeast cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS/1% BSA and loaded on BD

656

FACSMelody cell sorter. Top 5-10% of cells with high binding activity to a certain SARS-CoV-2

657

RBD labeling concentration were sorted and spun down. Sorted cells were expanded in 2 mL of

658

synthetic drop-out medium without tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, Y1876-20G) supplemented with

659

1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Corning, 30-002-C) at 30°C overnight.

660
661

Deep sequencing and analysis

662

After each sort, a fragment of cell population was expanded in 2 mL of synthetic drop-out medium

663

without tryptophan supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin overnight at 30°C. Yeast cells

664

were then spun down, cell pellet was resuspended with 250 µL of buffer P1 (with RNAse added)

665

(Qiagen, 27104) by pipetting up and down. 5 µL of Zymolyase (Zymo Research, E1005) was

666

added to digest yeast cell walls and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were then lysed, neutralized,

667

and DNA was purified according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, 27104). After that,

668

CR3022 HC and LC fragments from post-sorted plasmid DNA were amplified by following

669

CR3022-HC and CR3022-LC primer mixture respectively.

1µL of primer mixture (10 µM) were used to amplify the HC and LC DNA respectively after every

704

round of FACS selection with 2 µL of post-sorted plasmid DNA, 10 µL of 5X Phusion HF buffer,

705

35.5 µL of H2O, and 0.5 µL of Phusion enzyme (ThermoFisher, F530L) using the following PCR

706

program: 1min at 98°C; 32 cycles of 10 s at 98°C, 15 s at 65°C, 30s at 72°C; followed by 5 min

707

at 72°C. After PCR clean up, second round of PCR was performed by adding 2 µL of first round

708

PCR product, 5 µL of 4 µM barcode nextera adapter primer mixture, 0.4 uL of 10mM dNTP, 4 uL

709

of 5X Phusion HF buffer (ThermoFisher, F518L), 8.4 µL of H2O, and 0.2 µL of Phusion enzyme

710

and using the following PCR program: 1 min at 98°C; 7 cycles of 15 s at 98°C, 15 s at 68°C, 30 s

711

at 72°C; followed by 5 min at 72°C. After PCR clean up, all the PCR products were combined and

712

diluted to 15 pM in the final volume of 20 µL. To denature the DNA, 5 µL of the diluted library and

713

5 µL of freshly-prepared 0.2N NaOH were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.

714

Then 990 µL of pre-chilled HyB buffer was added and mixed well. 570 µL of denatured library

715

DNA and 30 µL of denatured PhiX control library (Illumina, FC-110-3001) were mixed, added into

716

Miseq Reagent V3 kit (Illumina, MS-102-3003), and finally loaded onto Illumina Miseq Next

717

Generation sequencer.

718

Paired FASTQs were checked for sequence quality using the FastQC package (FastQC v0.11.9 ).

719

The forward and reverse reads were merged using BBMerge (version 38.87) from the BBTools

720

suite using standard parameters (Bushnell et al., 2017). Merged reads with full sequence identity

721

were clustered using VSEARCH (v2.15.1) (Rognes et al., 2016). Clustering was done using the

722

"cluster_fast" method and fasta files were written including cluster abundance in the fasta header.

756

SARS-CoV-1 (Genbank AAP13567) or SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank MN908947) S and RBD proteins

757

were transiently expressed in Freestyle 293F system (ThermoFisher). In brief, S or RBD

758

expression plasmids were cotransfected with 40K PEI (1 mg/mL) at a ratio of 1:3. After incubation

759

for 30 min at RT, transfection mixture was added to Freestyle 293F cells at a density of

760

approximately 1 million cells/mL. After 5 days, supernatants were harvested and filtered with a

761

0.22 µm membrane.The His-tagged proteins were purified with the HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo

762

Fisher, 88222). After three columns of washing with 25 mM Imidazole (pH 7.4), proteins were

763

eluted with an elution buffer (250 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4) at slow gravity speed (~4 sec/drop).

764

Eluted proteins were buffer exchanged and concentrated with PBS using Amicon tubes

765

(Millipore). The proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using

766

Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare). The selected fractions were pooled and concentrated again for

767

further use.

769

Antibody production and purification

770

Monoclonal antibody was transiently expressed in the Expi293 system (ThermoFisher, A14635).

771

In brief, antibody HC and LC plasmids were co-transfected at a ratio of 1:2.5 with transfection

772

reagent FectoPRO (Polyplus 116-010). After 24 h of transfection, 300 mM of sterile sodium

773

valproic acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich, P4543) and 45% D-(+)- glucose solution (Sigma Aldrich,

774

G8769-100ML) were added to feed cells. After 4-5 days of transfection, supernatants were

775

collected, sterile-filtered (0.22 µm), and IgG was purified with Protein A sepharose beads (GE

776

Healthcare 17-5280-04).

Pseudovirus neutralization assay

779

Pseudovirus was generated as described previously2. In brief, 12.5 µg of MLV gag/pol backbone

780

(Addgene, 14887), 10 µg of MLV-CMV-Luciferase plasmid, and 2.5 µg of SARS-CoV-2-d18 spike

781

plasmid were incubated with transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher, 11668027)

782

following manufacturer’s instructions for 20 min at RT. Then the mixture was transferred onto HEK

783

293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) in a 10 cm2 culture dish (Corning, 430293). After 12-16 h of

784

transfection, culture medium was gently removed, fresh DMEM medium was added onto the

785

culture dish. Supernatants containing pseudovirus were harvested after 48 h post transfection

786

and frozen at -80 °C for long term storage.

787

In the neutralization assay, antibody samples were serially diluted with complete DMEM medium

and added to the cells. The transduced cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Each treatment

804

was tested in duplicate. The medium was removed and disposed of appropriately. Cells were

805

fixed by immersing the plate into 4% formaldehyde for 1 hour before washing 3 times with

806

phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The plate was then either stored at 4°C or gently shaken for 30

807

minutes with 100 µL/well of permeabilization buffer (PBS with 1% Triton-X). All solutions were

808

removed, then 100 µl of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added, followed by room

809

temperature (RT) incubation at 2 hours.

810

Primary antibodies against the spike protein were generated from a high-throughput process that

811

screened a convalescent, coronavirus disease 2019 cohort (CC)2. A mix of primary antibodies

812

consisting of CC6.29, CC6.33, CC6.36, CC12.23, CC12.25, in a 1:1 ratio, were used next. The

813

primary antibody mixture was diluted in PBS/1% BSA to a final concentration of 2 µg/ml. The

814

blocking solution was removed and washed thoroughly with wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween-

815

20). The primary antibody mixture, 50 µl/well, was incubated with the cells for 2 hours at RT. The

816

plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer.

ImmunoResearch, 109-035-088) diluted to 0.5 µg/mLl in PBS/1% BSA was added at 50 µL/well

819

and incubated for 2 hours at RT. The plates were washed 6 times with wash buffer. HRP substrate

820

(Roche, 11582950001) was freshly prepared as follows: Solution A was added to Solution B in a

821

100:1 ratio and stirred for 15 minutes at RT. The substrate was added at 50 µL/well and

822

chemiluminescence was measured in a microplate luminescence reader (BioTek, Synergy 2).

823

The following method was used to calculate the percentage neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. First,

824

we plotted a standard curve of serially diluted virus (3000, 1000, 333, 111, 37, 12, 4, 1 PFU)

825

versus RLU using four-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism 8.0) below:

826
827

(y: RLU, x: PFU, a,b,c and x0 are parameters fitted by standard curve)

828

To convert sample RLU into PFU, use the equation below: (if y < a then x = 0)

829
830

Percentage neutralization was calculated by the following equation:

831
832

VC = Average of vehicle-treated control; CC = Average of cell only control, nAb, neutralizing

833

antibody. PFU value was used for each variable indicated.

834
835

To compute neutralization IC50, logistic regression (sigmoidal) curves were fit using GraphPad

836

Prism. Means and standard deviations are displayed in the curve fit graphs and were also

837

calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.0.

6x-His tag antibodies were coated at 2 ug/mL in PBS onto 96-well half-area high binding plates

841

(Corning, 3690) overnight at 4˚C or 2 h at 37˚C. After washing, plates were blocked with 3% BSA

842

for 1 h at RT. Then 1 ug/mL of his tagged recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (or SARS-CoV-1) RBD or S

843

proteins were added in plates and incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing, serially diluted

844

antibodies were added in plates and incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing, alkaline phosphatase-

845

conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fcγ secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 109-055-

846

008) was added in 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 1 h at RT. After final wash, phosphatase

847

substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, S0942-200TAB) was added into each well. Absorption was measured

848

at 405 nm.

SPR measurements were carried out on a Biacore 8K instrument at 25°C. All experiments were

872

carried out with a flow rate of 30 µL/min in a mobile phase of HBS-EP [0.01 M HEPES (pH 7.4),

873

0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.0005% (v/v) Surfactant P20]. Anti-Human IgG (Fc) antibody (Cytiva)

874

was immobilized to a density ~7000-10000 RU via standard NHS/EDC coupling to a Series S

875

CM-5 (Cytiva) sensor chip. A reference surface was generated through the same method.

876

For conventional kinetic/dose-response, listed antibodies were captured to 50-100 RU via Fc-

877

capture on the active flow cell prior to analyte injection. A concentration series of SARS-CoV-2

878

RBD was injected across the antibody and control surface for 2 min, followed by a 5 min

879

dissociation phase using a multi-cycle method. Regeneration of the surface in between injections

880

of SARS-CoV-2 RBD was achieved by a single, 120s injection of 3M MgCl2. Kinetic analysis of

881

each reference subtracted injection series was performed using the BIAEvaluation software

882

(Cytiva). All sensorgram series were fit to a 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model of interaction.

Expression and purification of Fab

884

The CC12.3 Fab was expressed and purified using a previous protocol (Yuan et al., 2020b). In

885

brief, the heavy and light chains were cloned into phCMV3. The plasmids were transiently co-

886

transfected into ExpiCHO cells at a ratio of 2:1 (HC:LC) using ExpiFectamine™ CHO Reagent

887

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was

888

collected at 10 days post-transfection. The Fabs were purified with a CaptureSelect™ CH1-XL

889

Affinity Matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by size exclusion chromatography. The

890

eCR3022.20 Fab was purified by digesting eCR3022.20 IgG using Fab digestion kit

891

(ThermoFisher, 44985) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After digestion, Fc fragments

892

and undigested IgG were removed from binding to the protein A beads. The unbound flowthrough

893

Fab was collected and followed by size exclusion chromatography.

Crystal structure determination of the eCR3022.20-RBD-CC12.3 complex

896

Purified eCR3022.20 Fab, CC12.3 Fab, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were mixed at an equimolar ratio

897

and incubated overnight at 4°C. The complex (12 mg/ml) was screened for crystallization using

898

the 384 conditions of the JCSG Core Suite (Qiagen) on our custom-designed robotic

899

CrystalMation system (Rigaku) at Scripps Research by the vapor diffusion method in sitting drops

900

containing 0.1 μl of protein and 0.1 μl of reservoir solution. Optimized crystals were then grown in

901

0.1 M sodium citrate - citric acid buffer pH 5.0, 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 1 M lithium chloride, and

902

10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 at 20°C. Crystals were grown for 7 days and then flash cooled

903

in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K) at the Stanford

904

Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) on the Scripps/Stanford beamline 12-1 with a

905

wavelength of 0.97946 Å, and processed with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Structures

906

were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (McCoy et al., 2007) with PDB 6XC7(Yuan

907

et al., 2020b). Iterative model building and refinement were carried out in COOT (Emsley et al.,

908

916

antibody or 10 mg per animal of an anti-dengue isotype matched control antibody (Den3). After

917

72 hours, serum was obtained to quantify mAb titers prior to animal infection. Each hamster was

918

then infected through intranasal administration of 10^5 total PFU (plaque forming units) of SARS-

919

CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). Animal weights were obtained during the study as a measure of disease

920

progression. On day four post infection, six of the animals were sacrificed and lung tissue was

921

harvested for viral titer analysis by RT-qPCR as well as live viral titers via plaque assay. At day

922

seven post-infection, six of the animals were sacrificed and serum was collected to assess mAb

923

titer at the time of sacrifice using our recombinant protein ELISA protocol. Research protocol was

924

approved and performed in accordance with Scripps Research IACUC Protocol #20-0003.

925

Viral load measurements - Plaque Assay

926

SARS-CoV-2 titers were measured by homogenizing lung tissue in DMEM 2% FCS using 100 µm

927

cell strainers (Myriad, 2825-8367). Homogenized organs were titrated 1:10 over 6 steps and

928

layered over Vero-E6 cells. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, a 1% methylcellulose in DMEM overlay

929

was added, and the cells were incubated for 3 days at 37°C. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA and

930

plaques were counted by crystal violet staining.

931

Statistical methods

932

Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 8 for Mac, Graph Pad Software, San

933

Diego, California, USA. Groups of data were compared using several methods including the

934

grouped parametric One-Way ANOVA test and the grouped non-parametric Kruskall-Walli test.

935

Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.
