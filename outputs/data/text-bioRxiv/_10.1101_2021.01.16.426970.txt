ABSTRACT

29

The biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory syndrome

30

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research and countermeasure development.

31

Here we report a trans-complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-

32

CoV-2 that recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round

33

infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization

34

and antiviral testing. The trans-complementation system consists of two components: a genomic

35

viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing

36

the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components generates virions that

37

can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2.

38

Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions

39

exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible

40

dose. The results suggest that the trans-complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2

41

laboratories for research and countermeasure development.

INTRODUCTION

44

Three zoonotic betacoronaviruses have emerged to cause global epidemics or

45

pandemics in less than twenty years: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-

46

CoV) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and SARS-

47

CoV-2 in 2019 (1). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused

48

unprecedented social and economic disruption. As of January 16, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had

49

infected

50

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). In response to the pandemic, the scientific

51

community has rapidly developed experimental platforms to study COVID-19 and to develop

52

countermeasures. Several groups have established infectious cDNA clones and reporter SARS-

over

94

to

53

CoV-2 to facilitate the development and analysis of first-generation vaccines and therapeutics

54

(2-6). However, since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) pathogen, the requirement of

55

high containment represents a bottleneck for antiviral and vaccine evaluation. Thus, a BSL-2

56

cell culture system that recapitulates authentic viral replication is urgently needed.

57

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately

58

30 kb in length. The SARS-CoV-2 virion consists of an internal nucleocapsid [formed by the

59

genomic RNA coated with nucleocapsid (N) proteins] and an external envelope [formed by a

60

cell-derived bilipid membrane embedded with spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E)

61

proteins] (7). The genomic RNA encodes open-reading-frames (ORFs) for replicase

62

(ORF1a/ORF1b), S, E, M, and N proteins, as well as seven additional ORFs for accessory

63

proteins (1). Stable cell lines containing replicons (self-replicating viral RNA genomes with one

64

or more gene deletions) have been developed for many viruses, including coronaviruses (8-12).

65

Because replicons lack structural genes, they are not infectious and can safely be manipulated

66

in BSL-2 laboratories. For SARS-CoV-2, although a transient replicon system has been

67

established (13), no stable replicon cell line has been reported. To overcome this gap, we have

68

developed a single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 through trans-complementation. The single-

69

round SARS-CoV-2 is engineered with a reporter gene that facilitates high-throughput antiviral

70

screening and neutralizing antibody measurement. We validated the safety of the system in cell

71

cultures, hamsters, and highly susceptible human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)

72

transgenic mice. Our results suggest that the trans-complementation system can be used safely

73

at BSL-2 laboratories.

two components: (i) a viral RNA containing a mNeonGreen (mNG) reporter gene and a deletion

79

of ORF3 and E genes (ΔORF3-E; Fig. 1B) and (ii) a Vero E6 cell line expressing the ORF3 and

80

E proteins under a doxycycline inducible promoter (Vero-ORF3-E; Fig. 1C-D). Upon

81

electroporation of

82

complementation enables production of virions that can continuously infect and amplify on Vero-

83

ORF3-E cells; however, these virions can only infect normal cells for a single round due to the

84

lack of ORF3 and E genes in the packaged RNA genome (Fig. 1A).

85

Our trans-complementation system is engineered with several safeguards to eliminate

86

wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 production. Besides the ORF3-E deletion, the ΔORF3-E viral RNA

87

contained two additional modifications. (i) The transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of

88

ΔORF3-E

89

underlined; Fig. 1B). Recombination between the TRS-mutated

90

inadvertently contaminating viral RNA would therefore not produce replicative virus (14, 15). (ii)

91

An mNG gene was engineered at ORF7 of

92

replication (Fig. 1B). The trans-complementing Vero-ORF3-E cell lines were produced by

93

transducing Vero E6 cells with a lentivirus encoding the following elements (Fig. S1A): a

94

TRE3GS promoter that allows doxycycline to induce ORF3 and E protein expression (Fig. 1C-D

95

and S1B); an mCherry gene that facilitates selection of cell lines with high levels of protein

96

expression (Fig. S1C); a foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A (FMDV 2A) autocleavage site that

97

enables translation of individual mCherry and viral E protein; and an encephalomyocarditis virus

98

internal ribosomal entry site (EMCV IRES) that bicistronically translates the ORF3 protein. The

99

above design eliminated overlapping sequences between the ORF3-E mRNA and

RNA was mutated from the WT ACGAAC to CCGGAT (mutant nucleotides

102

indicated by the mCherry reporter (Fig. 1D).

Electroporation of

ΔORF3-E

mNG RNA into doxycycline-induced Vero-ORF3-E cells

104

produced virions of ~104 median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50)/ml titer (Fig. 1E). The

microscopy (Fig. 1F). The ΔORF3-E mNG virion produced in the supernatant could infect Vero-

107

ORF3-E cells for multiple rounds, but for only one round on naïve Vero E6 (Fig. 1G-H), Calu-3,

108

or hACE2-expressing A549 cells (A549-hACE2; Fig. S2). As controls, WT mNG SARS-CoV-2

109

could infect cells for multiple rounds (Fig. S2). These results indicate that the trans-

110

complementation system produces virions that can only infect WT cells for single round.

mNG virion exhibited a diameter of ~91 nm under negative staining electron

111

Adaptive mutations to improve virion production. To improve the efficiency of the

112

trans-complementation platform, we serially propagated ΔORF3-E mNG virions on Vero-ORF3-

113

E cells for 10 passages (3-4 days per passage) to select for adaptive mutations. The P10 virion

114

replicated to higher titers than the P1 virion on Vero-ORF3-E cells (Fig. 2A), retained the mNG

115

reporter (Fig. 2B-C), and still infected normal Vero cells for only single round (Fig. S3). Whole

116

genome sequencing of the P10 virion revealed three mutations in the nsp1, nsp4, and S genes

117

(Fig. 2D). Engineering of these mutations into

118

required to enhance the trans-complementation efficiency, producing 106 TCID50/ml of virions

119

(Fig. 2A-B). These results indicate that (i) adaptive mutations can be selected to improve the

120

yield of single-round virions and (ii) WT virus is not produced from the trans-complementation

121

system.

ΔORF3-E mNG RNA showed that all three were

Exclusion of WT SARS-CoV-2 production. To confirm that no WT SARS-CoV-2 is

123

inadvertently produced during trans-complementation, we performed four additional selections

124

by passaging ΔORF3-E mNG virions on Vero-ORF3-E cells for five rounds. The P5 virions from

125

selections I-III could only infect Vero cells for single round (Fig. S4A-B). Unexpectedly,

126

selection IV produced P5 (S-IV-P5) virions that could infect parental Vero E6 cells for more than

127

one round, though at a barely detectable level of ~102 TCID50/ml, which was >100,000-fold

128

lower than the WT mNG SARS-CoV-2 titers (Fig. S4C). To remove the single-round virion from

129

the multi-round virion in the S-IV-P5 stock, we passaged the S-IV-P5 virion stock on Vero E6

130

cells for two rounds, resulting in S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion capable of multi-round infection. Full-

131

genome sequencing revealed that the S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion retained the ORF3-E deletion but

132

accumulated mutations in nsp15, nsp16, S, and M genes (Fig. S4D). Engineering the

133

accumulated mutations into ΔORF3-E mNG RNA showed that the M mutation T130N conferred

134

multi-round infection on Vero cells (Fig. S4E). Residue T130 is predicted to be on the intra-

135

virion side of the M protein (16, 17), and is conserved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.

136

S4F). The results indicate that, despite an absence of WT SARS-CoV-2 production and a lack

137

of ORF and E genes, the trans-complementation system could produce mutant virions capable

138

of infecting parental Vero cells for multiple rounds at a barely detectable level.

139

Next, we continuously cultured the S-IV-P5 variant on parental Vero E6 cells for 10

140

rounds (3-4 days per round) to select for potential virions with improved replication efficiency.

141

However, passage did not improve viral replication on Vero cells (Fig. S5). The result suggests

142

that, due to the lack of ORF3 and E gene, the S-IV-P5 virion is unlikely to gain efficient multiple-

143

round amplification on normal cells through adaptation.

with 6×105 TCID50 of

hamsters did not lose weight (Fig. 3B) or develop detectable disease (Fig. 3C). In contrast, 105

153

virion, capable of infecting Vero cells for multiple rounds, in hamsters. To maximize the infection

154

dose of S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion, we amplified S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 on Vero-ORF3-E cells,

155

producing a virion stock of 5×104 TCID50/ml. After intranasal inoculation with 5×103 TCID50 of S-

156

IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion (the highest possible dose), hamsters did not lose weight or develop

157

detectable disease (Fig. S6). Collectively, the results indicate that both

158

and S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion are highly attenuated and do not disseminate or cause disease in

159

hamsters.

160

ΔORF3-E mNG virion

To corroborate the hamster results, we tested ΔORF3-E mNG virion in more susceptible

ΔORF3-E

161

K18-hACE2 mice (Fig. 3G). After intranasal inoculation with 3×105 TCID50 of

162

virion (the highest possible dose), K18-hACE2 mice did not lose weight (Fig. 3H) or die (Fig.

163

3I); in contrast, infection with 2.5×103 TCID50 of WT SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 25% weight loss

164

and 67% lethality. To increase the stringency of the test, we inoculated K18-hACE2 mice by

165

intracranial injection with 6×104 TCID50 of ΔORF3-E mNG virion (the highest possible dose); no

166

morbidity (Fig. 3J) or mortality (Fig. 3K) was observed. In contrast, mice inoculated by the

167

intracranial route with 500, 50, 5, and 1 TCID50 of WT SARS-CoV-2 developed 100%, 25%,

168

25%, and 0% mortality, respectively (Fig. 3K). Similar to the ΔORF3-E mNG virion, no morbidity

169

or mortality was observed after mice were inoculated by the intranasal or intracranial route with

170

2.5×103 or 5×102 TCID50 of S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion, respectively (Fig. S7). Together, the results

171

demonstrate that both single-round

virion lack virulence in K18-hACE2 mice.

179

addition, the

neutralizing concentration (EC50) for a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-

182

evaluated the

183

potent EC50 on hACE2-A549 cells (0.27 µM; Fig. 4E) than that on Vero cells (5.1 µM; Fig. 4F).

184

The EC50 discrepancy between the two cell types is likely due to different efficiencies in

185

converting Remdesivir to its triphosphate form, as previously reported (3, 21). Collectively, the

results demonstrate that the

DISCUSSION
We generated and characterized a trans-complementation system for SARS-CoV-2. The

ΔORF3-E virion that could be used for

191

system produced a high yield of single-round infectious

192

neutralization and antiviral testing. An mNG reporter was introduced into the ΔORF3-E virion to

193

indicate viral replication. Depending on research needs, other reporter genes, such as luciferase

194

or GFP, could be engineered into the system. A reliable high-throughput neutralization assay is

195

important for COVID-19 vaccine evaluation and for studying the kinetics of neutralizing antibody

196

levels in post-vaccinated and naturally infected people (4, 22, 23). Three types of cell-based

197

high-throughput neutralization assays currently are available: (i) pseudovirus assay, which

198

expresses SARS-CoV-2 S protein alone on heterologous viruses, can be performed at BSL-2

199

laboratories (24, 25); (ii) a reporter SARS-CoV-2 assay, which must be performed at BSL-3

200

laboratories, represents authentic viral infection (3, 5, 6, 26); (iii) bona fide fully infectious SARS-

201

CoV-2 by focus reduction neutralization test (24). The

202

advantages of each assay type by recapitulating the authentic viral infection for a single round,

ΔORF3-E mNG virion can be readily adapted

203

thus supporting its use at BSL2 laboratories. The

to investigate vaccine-elicited neutralization against newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 isolates, such

205

as the rapidly spreading United Kingdom and South African strains (27, 28), by swapping or

206

mutating the S gene.

207

The trans-complementation system can also be used for high-throughput antiviral

ΔORF3-E

208

screening of large compound libraries. Infection of normal cells with

209

allows for screening of inhibitors of virus entry, genome translation, and RNA replication, but not

210

virion assembly/release. In contrast, infection of Vero-ORF3-E cells with

211

can be used to identify inhibitors of all steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle, including virion

212

assembly and release; this system also allows selection for resistance to inhibitors for mode-of-

213

action studies. In addition, the single-round

214

vaccine platform, as previously reported for other coronaviruses (29, 30).

Our results support that the trans-complementation system can be performed safely in

ΔORF3-E mNG virion that

BSL-2 laboratories. (i) The system produced single-round infectious

217

does not infect normal cells for multiple rounds and thus cannot spread in vitro or in vivo. (ii) The

218

system did not produce WT virus, even after multiple independent selections. (iii) Although an

219

adaptive mutation in M protein was selected to confer multi-round infection on normal cells, the

220

replication level of such virion (i.e., S-IV-P5-Vero-P2) was barely detectable, with infectious

221

titers >100,000-fold lower than the WT SARS-CoV-2. The molecular mechanism of how S-IV-

222

P5-Vero-P2 could infect cells for multiple rounds without the ORF3 and E proteins remains to be

223

defined. Previous studies showed that deletion of both ORF3 and E genes was lethal for SARS-

224

CoV (31). (iv) Continuous culturing of the S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion on naïve Vero cells did not

225

improve viral replication. (v) When hamsters and K18-hACE2 mice were infected with the

228

virions caused detectable disease or death in the highly susceptible K18-hACE2 mice. If further

229

safety improvement is needed, more accessory ORFs could be deleted from the

230

mNG RNA as accessory proteins are not essential for viral replication (1).

ΔORF3-E

231

One limitation of our study is the use of Vero E6 cells for constructing the Vero-ORF3-E

232

cell line. When propagated on Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 could accumulate deletions at the

233

furin cleavage site in the S protein (32, 33). This cleavage deletion affects the neutralization

234

susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 and possibly the route of entry into cells (34). Although we did not

235

observe furin cleavage deletions when our ΔORF3-E mNG virion was passaged on Vero-ORF3-

236

E cells, this possibility could be minimized or eliminated by using other cell lines, such as A549-

237

hACE2 or Vero-TMPRSS2-hACE2 cells.

238

In summary, we have developed a trans-complementation system for SARS-CoV-2 that

239

likely can be performed at BSL-2 laboratories for COVID-19 research and countermeasure

240

development. Thus, the experimental system could be used by researchers in industry,

241

academia, and government laboratories who lack access to a BSL-3 facility.

243

METHODS

244

Cell lines. Vero E6, Vero CCL-81, Calu-3, and HEK-293T cells were purchased from the

245

American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified

246

Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml Penicillium-

247

Streptomycin (P/S), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone Laboratories, South Logan,

248

UT). Vero-ORF3-E cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 2mM L-

249

Hamsters. Syrian golden hamsters (HsdHan:AURA strain) were purchased from Envigo.

254

Animals were housed in groups and fed standard chow diets. Hamster experiments were

255

performed as described previously (36). Briefly, 105 TCID50 of WT SARS-CoV-2, 6×105 TCID50

256

of

257

inoculated into four- to five-week-old male Syrian golden hamsters via the intranasal route. The

258

S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion stock was prepared by two rounds of culturing of S-IV-P5 virion (Fig.

259

S4A) on Vero E6 cells (to remove single-round infectious virion), followed by propagation on

260

Vero-ORF3-E cells. Fourteen hamsters were used in SARS-CoV-2- and

261

infected groups and 5 hamsters were used in S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion-infected group. From day

262

1 to 14 post-infection, hamsters were observed daily for weight change and signs of illness. Five

263

hamsters in WT SARS-CoV-2-, ΔORF3-E mNG virions-, or mock-infected group were sacrificed

264

on day 2 post-infection for lung and trachea collections. Nasal washes and oral swabs of the

Plasmid construction. Seven previously reported subclone plasmids for the assembly

279

of the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 were used in this study, including pUC57-F1, pCC1-F2,

280

pCC1-F3, pUC57-F4, pUC57-F5, pUC57-F6, and pCC1-F7-mNG (2, 26). For the convenience

281

of deleting ORF3-E gene, we constructed F5, F6, and F7-mNG fragments into one plasmid. F5,

282

F6, and F7-mNG fragments were amplified from corresponding subclones via PCR with primer

283

pairs pcov-F56-F1/pncov-R5, pncov-F6/pncov-R6, and pncov-F7/pncov-R8, respectively (Table

284

S2). All PCR products were cloned together into a pCC1 vector through NotI and ClaI restriction

285

sites using the standard restriction digestion-ligation cloning, resulting in subclone pCC1-F567-

286

mNG.

287

To introduce ORF3-E deletion and mutant Transcription Regulatory Sequence (TRS)

288

into pCC1-F567-mNG, seven fragments were amplified with primer pairs cov-21115-F/TRS2-S-

289

291

F/cov-28501-R. The seven PCR products were assembled into the pCC1-F567-mNG plasmid

292

that were pre-linearized with NheI and XhoI by using the NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly kit

293

(NEB) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, resulting in subclone pCC1-F567-mNG-

294

ΔORF3-E. Mutation T130N in M protein was engineered into pCC1-F567-mNG-ΔORF3-E with

295

primers M-T130N-F/M-T130N-R via overlap PCR. Mutant TRS was engineered into pCC1-F1

296

with primers 5UTR-TRS2-F and 5UTR-TRS2-R via overlap PCR.

297

For making the Vero-ORF3-E cell lines, codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 and E

298

genes were synthesized by GenScript Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). An mCherry reporter Zika virus

299

cDNA plasmid (37) was used as a template to amplify the mCherry-F2A gene. For constructing

300

a lentiviral plasmid expressing ORF3 and E protein of SARS-CoV-2, DNA fragments encoding

301

mCherry-F2A, SARS-CoV-2 E, EMCV IRES, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 were amplified with

303

IRES-R, and IRES-optORF3-F/BamH1-Cov-optORF3-R, respectively. The PCR products then

304

were inserted into a Tet-on inducible lentiviral vector pLVX (Takara, Mountain View, CA)

305

through EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, resulting in plasmid pLVX-ORF3-E.

306

Selection of Vero-ORF3-E cell line. For packaging the lentivirus, the pLVX-ORF3-E

307

plasmid was transfected into HEK-293T cells using the Lenti-X Packaging Single Shots kit

308

(Takara). Lentiviral supernatants were harvested at 72 h post-transfection and filtered through a

309

0.22 μM membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA). One day before transduction, Vero E6 cells were

310

seeded in a 6-well plate (4×105 per well) with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 12-18 h, cells

311

were transduced with 2 ml lentivirus for 24 h in the presence of 12 μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma-

312

Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). At 24 h post-transduction, cells from a single well were split into four 10

313

cm dishes and cultured in medium supplemented with 25

314

medium containing puromycin was refreshed every 2 days. After 2-3 weeks of selection, visible

315

puromycin-resistant cell colonies were formed. Several colonies were transferred into 24-well

316

plates. When confluent, cells were treated with trypsin and seeded in 6-well plates for further

317

expansion. The resulting cells were defined as Vero-ORF3-E P0 cells. For cell line verification,

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Generation of single-round infectious ΔORF3-E mNG virion (A) A transcomplementation system for SARS-CoV-2. Vero-ORF3-E cells are electroporated with ΔORF3E mNG RNA. Trans-complementation produces ΔORF3-E mNG virion (left panel) which can
infect naïve Vero E6 cells for only single round (right panel). (B) ΔORF3-E mNG virion genome.
Both the full-length mNG SARS-CoV-2 genome (top panel) and the ΔORF3-E mNG virion
genome (bottom panel) are shown. The genomic fragment 8 (gF8) of RT-PCR analysis are
indicated above both genomes. The ORF3-E deletion junction is indicated. The WT and mutant
Transcription Regulatory Sequences (TRS) are also depicted. (C) ORF3-E RNA expression in
Vero-ORF3-E cells. Doxycycline (Dox) was used to induce the expression of ORF3-E RNA. RTPCR analyses were performed on Vero-ORF3-E cells with or without doxycycline induction as
well as on naïve Vero E6 cells. (D) Induction of mCherry expression in Vero-ORF3-E cells.
Passage 1 (P1) and 20 (P20) of Vero-ORF3-E cells were induced by doxycycline to express
mCherry fluorescence. Scale bar, 100 μm. (E) Production of ΔORF3-E mNG virion after
electroporation. After electroporating ΔORF3-E mNG RNA into Vero-ORF3-E cells (with
doxycycline), infectious titers of ΔORF3-E mNG virion were measured from culture medium.
Three sets of repeated experiments are presented with bars representing standard deviations.
(F) Negative-staining electron microscopic image of ΔORF3-E mNG virion. Scale bar, 50 nm.
(G) Analysis of ΔORF3-E mNG virion infection. Vero E6 or Vero-ORF3-E cells were incubated
with WT mNG SARS-CoV-2 or ΔORF3-E mNG virion for 2 h. The cells were washed three times
with PBS to remove residual input virus. At 48 h post-infection, the supernatants of the infected
cells were transferred to fresh Vero E6 or Vero-ORF3-E cells for a second round of infection.
The mNG signals from both rounds of infected cells are presented. Scale bar, 100 μm. (H) RTPCR analysis. Extracellular RNA from the second-round infection from (G) was harvested at 48
h post-infection. Fragment 8 of the viral genome, depicted in (B), was amplified by RT-PCR to
confirm the ORF3-E deletion and mNG retention.
Figure 2. Adaptive mutations to improve the yield of ΔORF3-E mNG virion production. (A)
Viral replication kinetics on Vero-ORF3-E cells. Adaptive mutations (D) were selected by
continuously passaging the ΔORF3-E virion on Vero-ORF3-E cells for 10 rounds. For
comparing the replication kinetics of the passaged viruses, Vero-ORF3-E cells were infected
with the P1 or P10 ΔORF3-E virion, ΔORF3-E virion containing an S mutation in (D) [ΔORF3-E
virion mut-S], or ΔORF3-E virion containing all adaptive mutations in nsp1, nsp4, and S in (D)
[ΔORF3-E virion mut-All] at an MOI of 0.15. WT mNG SARS-CoV-2 was included as a control.
Viral titers in culture supernatants are presented. ANOVA with multiple comparison correction
test were performed with *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01. (B) mNG-positive cells at 24 and 48 h postinfection from (A). Scale bar, 100 μm. (C) RT-PCR analysis for single-round infection. For
confirming the P10 ΔORF3-E virion remains infectious for only a single round on Vero cells,
Vero E6 or Vero-ORF3-E cells were infected with WT mNG SARS-CoV-2 or P10 ΔORF3-E
mNG virion for two rounds as described in Fig. 1G. Viral RNAs were extracted from the secondround culture fluids and analyzed by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR product, fragment 8 (gF8), is
indicated in Fig. 1B. (D) Adaptive mutations. Three mutations were identified from whole
genome sequencing of P10 ΔORF3-E mNG virion. No mutation was found in the P1 ΔORF3-E
mNG virion.
Figure 3. Safety characterization of ΔORF3-E mNG virion in animal models. (A) Hamster
experimental schedule. Four- to five-week-old male Syrian golden hamsters were intranasally
(I.N.) inoculated with 105 TCID50 of WT SARS-CoV-2, 6×105 TCID50 of ΔORF3-E mNG virion, or
PBS mock control. Hamsters were monitored for weight loss, disease, and viral RNA level. (B)

The means for each group [I.N: WT SARS-CoV-2 (n=9), ΔORF3-E mNG virion (n=4), and mock
(n=4); I.C: WT SARS-CoV-2 500 TCID50 (n=4), 50 TCID50 (n=5), 5 TCID50 (n=5), and 1 TCID50
(n=5) and 6×104 TCID50 ΔORF3-E mNG virus (n=4)] are indicated, with error bars indicating the
standard deviation. A mixed-model ANOVA using Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons was
used to evaluate the statistical significance among groups: *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001;
****, P<0.0001. Mouse survival after I.N. (I) and I.C. (K) inoculation was analyzed using the
Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test. Using groups with 100% survival as a comparator, a Bonferroni
correction was applied manually to adjust the threshold for significance (indicated by *).

viral RNA.
Figure S3. No WT mNG SARS-CoV-2 production from the trans-complementation system.
WT mNG SARS-CoV-2 and P10 ΔORF3-E mNG virion (derived from 10 rounds of passaging of
ΔORF3-E mNG virion on Vero-ORF3-E cells) were used to infect Vero E6 cells for two rounds
as described in Fig. 1G. (A) Fluorescence and phase contrast images of infected cells are
presented for both the first and second rounds of infections. (B) RT-PCR analysis of viral RNA
extracted from the culture fluids from the second-round infected cells.
Figure S4. Selection of ΔORF3-E mNG virion capable of inefficiently infecting Vero E6
cells for more than one round. Four independently selected P5 ΔORF3-E mNG virions
(generated from five rounds of passaging ΔORF3-E mNG virion on Vero-ORF3-E cells) were
used to infect naïve Vero E6 cells for two rounds as described in Fig. 1G. The P5 ΔORF3-E
mNG virion-infected Vero E6 cells were analyzed for mNG signals (A). The extracellular RNA
from the second-round infected cells were examined for viral RNA by RT-PCR (B). Selection IV
P5 ΔORF3-E (S-IV-P5) mNG virion could infect Vero cells for multiple rounds. To remove the
single-round virion from the multi-round virion in the S-IV-P5 stock, the S-IV-P5 stock was
passaged on Vero E6 cells for two rounds, resulting in S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 virion capable of multiround infection. The replication kinetics of WT mNG SARS-CoV-2 and S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 mNG
virion were compared on Vero E6 cells (C). The cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.001. Limit
of detection, L.O.D. Adaptive mutations were identified from the S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 mNG virion
(D). The T130N mutation from the M protein was engineered into ΔORF3-E mNG virion. The
resulting ΔORF3-E mNG M T130N virion was used to infect Vero E6 cells for two rounds.
Fluorescence and phase contrast images of the infected cells are shown (E). Sequence
alignment shows that the M proteins from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the same T130
residue (F). Red arrow indicates the T130 residue of SARS-CoV-2.
Figure S5. No improvement of viral replication of selection IV ΔORF3-E (S-IV-P5) mNG
virion after 10 rounds of culturing on Vero E6 cells. S-IV-P5 mNG virion was continuously
passaged on Vero E6 cells for 10 rounds. The resulting P2 and P10 S-IV-P5 mNG virions (i.e.,
S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 and S-IV-P5-Vero-P10, respectively) were used to infect Vero E6 cells at an
MOI of 0.001. The mNG-positive cells (A) and the growth kinetics of the S-IV-P5-Vero-P2 and
S-IV-P5-Vero-P10 virions (B) were compared. We did not use the S-IV-P5-Vero-P1 virion in this
experiment because the P1 stock retained some carryover virions derived from the Vero-ORF3E trans-complementation culture. Viral titers were analyzed by unpaired T-test. ns, P>0.05.
