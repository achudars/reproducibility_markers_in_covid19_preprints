ABSTRACT

Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China during December 2019,
has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened
containment effort. This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus
carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the
evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating
containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of
2019-nCoV

development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by
accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural
proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas
Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting
differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly,
2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARSlike bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA)
CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized
by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant
epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and
variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of
immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize
the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to
better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions
to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.

Current 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in China and its subsequent
spread to multiple countries across four continents precipitated a major global health
crisis. Uncovering the 2019-nCoV genome evolution and immune determinants of its
proteome would be crucial for outbreak containment and preventative efforts.
Coronaviruses are single positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to Coronaviridae
family1, which are divided into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Delta- and Gammacoronavirus. CoVs are commonly found in many species of animals, including bats,
camels and humans. Occasionally, the animal CoVs can acquire genetic mutations by
errors during genome replication or recombination mechanism, which can further
expand their tropism to humans. The first human CoVs were discovered in the mid1960s. A total of six human CoV types were identified to be responsible for causing
human respiratory ailments, which include two alpha CoVs (229E; NL63), and four beta
CoVs (OC43; HKU1; SARS-CoV; MERS-CoV)2. Typically, these CoVs cause
asymptomatic infection or severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and
shortness of breath. However, other symptoms such as gastroenteritis and neurological
diseases of varying severity have also been reported3-5.

The recent two CoV human outbreaks were caused by betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV
(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome-CoV). In 2002, SARS-CoV outbreak was first reported in China, which
spread globally causing hundreds of deaths with a 11% mortality rate. In 2012, MERSCoV was first recognized in Saudi Arabia and subsequently in other countries, which
has a fatality rate of 37%.

Since December 2019, the seventh novel human

betacoronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing pneumonia outbreak was reported by the World
Health Organization. This novel virus is linked with an outbreak of febrile respiratory
illness in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China with an epidemiological association
to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market selling live farm and wild animals6 and
elsewhere in the city1.

While the 2019-CoV appears to be a zoonotic infectious disease, the specific animal
species and other reservoirs need to be clearly defined. Identification of the source
animal species for this outbreak would facilitate global public health authorities to
inspect the trading route and the movement of wild and domestic animals to Wuhan and
taking control measures to limit the spread of this disease7. The 2019-nCoV outbreak
has a fatality rate of 2% with significant impact on global health and economy. As of 29
January 2020, the 2019-nCoV has spread to fifteen countries including Asia-Pacific
region (Thailand, Japan, The Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nepal,
Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia), United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Canada
and the United States with 6065 confirmed cases, in which 5997 reported from China8.

Here, we report a detailed genetic analysis of 2019-nCoV evolution based on 47
genome sequences available in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Database
(GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/) (Supplemental Table 1) and one genome sequence
from GenBank. We further defined potential epitope targets in the structural proteins
(SPs) for vaccine design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Phylogenetic tree construction. We employed the following methodologies for genetic
analyses. The genome sequences of 2019-nCoV were obtained on 29 January 2020
along with genetically related 10 SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-like virus genome sequences
that we identified through the BLASTN search in NCBI database. We also included 10
sequences of MERS-CoV strains and one outgroup alphacoronavirus sequence. 2019nCoV genome (30 Kb in size) codes for a large non-structural polyprotein ORF1ab that
is proteolytically cleaved to generate 15/16 proteins, and four structural proteins - Spike
(S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N), as well as five accessory
proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and ORF10). The genome sequences were
aligned using the MAFFTv7 program9, which were exported to MEGA-X10 for NeighborJoining (NJ) phylogenetic tree construction with 1000 bootstrap support and genetic

distance calculations. Structural genes/proteins were aligned with closely related
sequences using Clustal Omega Program11.
High Binding Affinity (HBA) epitope identification. In order to identify the potential
target peptides for vaccine design, the structural protein sequences of highly conserved
and annotated representative 2019-nCoV strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3) were used
to predict the CD4 T-cell epitopes (TCEs) with the Immune Epitope Database and
Analysis Resource (IEDB) consensus tool by IEDB recommended prediction
method12,13. To identify the most immunodominant (IMD) CD4 epitopes, we employed
the computational approach described previously14. For all the possible 15-mer peptides
from the SPs, the binding affinity was predicted using six most prevalent Human
Leukocyte Antigen (HLA; MHC Class-II DR) alleles (http://allelefrequencies.net/) that
cover most of the ethnic population in China (PRC), Thailand (TH) and Japan (JPN)
(Supplemental Table 2). Since, the prevalence of dominant HLA-DR types may vary in
human populations from different countries, the prevalent six HLA-DR alleles covering
Asia-Pacific region14 and Global population data sets have been used for binding affinity
predictions to assess the generality of those predicted epitopes with high binding
affinities (HBA). We calculated the average binding affinity score for each predicted 15mer peptides against all the predominant HLA-DR types from each country/region using
a sliding window approach (Figure 2). This approach is more efficient as the epitopes
predicted with average HBA (IC <=10 nM), indicate that those epitopes are more likely
to bind and enhance a cellular immune response in the studied population.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Phylogenetic analysis reveals 2019-nCoV closely related to Bat CoV. Genome
based phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a major cluster of large clade was formed
with humans 2019-nCoV strains, SARS-CoV-like strains from bats and human SARSCoV viruses (Figure 1A) with 100 bootstrap support. All 2019-nCoV strains were
clustered together with 96% bootstrap support, but separated from bat/bat-SARS like

strains and human SARS-CoVs clusters, indicating that 2019-nCoV belongs to a novel
genotype. A small cluster was formed by MERS-CoV strains, which was genetically
unrelated to the strains circulating in the current outbreak. This result indicated that the
causative agent of current 2019-2020 outbreak is a betacoronavirus that is genetically
and evolutionarily related to bat CoVs: bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 and bat/SARS-CoVlike-viruses. Moreover, the result suggests that the evolutionary pressures exerted on
2019-nCoV, as well as bat and human SARS-coronaviruses were different.
Interestingly, strains from the current outbreak were clearly segregated from bat SARSCoV-like viruses (isolated in 2015 and 2017), but located adjacent to the
bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus isolated in 2013. Besides, both 2019-nCoV and bat
CoV clusters share a common ancestor (square), which is supported by 92% bootstrap
replications in the phylogeny. The ancestors of both human SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV
share a common ancestor. Overall our data indicates that the 2019-nCoV is not closely
clustering with either human SARS-CoV or bat-SARS-CoV like strains but shares a
common ancestor.

The mean group genetic distance among 2019-nCoV strains was zero, indicating high
genetic conservation among currently circulating viruses. Similar findings were
observed in human SARS and MERS isolates, but bat SARS-like isolates showed a
genetic distance of 0.04. The current circulating strains have close genetic associations
with the 2013 bat CoV, bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 (EPI-ISL-402131). The 2019-nCoV
Wuhan-Hu-1 and bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 strains share 96% sequence identity
(genetic distance 0.04) with 1141 variable nucleotide substitutions and 48 INDELs
(Figure 1C and D; Table 1A). While, bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017 virus and SARS humanBJ182-12/2008 virus from other clusters had 88% and 80% sequence identity (distance
0.23 and 0.46), 3542 and 5879 nucleotide substitutions and 137 and 535 INDELs,
respectively with 2019-nCoV Wuhan-Hu-1, suggesting that bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013
strain is likely the most recent ancestor of currently circulating 2019-nCoV strains. This
most recent ancestral CoV strain from bat species underwent significant evolution
during 2013 to 2019 possibly by genetic shift before spreading to humans (Figure 1B).
However, it is likely that CoVs from other animal species may also be a source for this

bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 showed 97.7% sequence identity with 29 non-synonymous
changes and 4 amino acid insertions (position 681-684, PRRA) (Table 1C). Whereas, M
protein shared 98.6% identity with one amino acid insertion (position 4, S) and N protein
showed 99% identity with 4 non-synonymous changes (P37S, S215G, S243G, Q267A).
Envelope protein shares 100% identity.

The genome alignment between the novel and bat (bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013)
coronaviruses showed 2 of 7 insertions (Table 1A) in Spike gene, whereas the
alignment of 2019-nCoV with distantly related SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017
showed 9 of 15 insertions and 2 of 5 deletions (Figure 1C; Table 1B) in Spike gene.
Interestingly, the Spike gene has a larger 39 nucleotide insertion (5’-aAT GGT GTT
GAA GGT TTT AAT TGT TAC TTT CCT TTA CAA Tca-3’) at genomic location 23022.
Our alignment result suggests a possible occurrence of recombination and nonsynonymous changes in Spike gene of 2019-nCoV which can alter the preference of
viral attachment to host receptor. The non-synonymous changes in Nucleocapsid gene
likely differentially regulate its binding to virus RNA genome and viral replication. Taken
together, our findings implicate that overall genetic differences facilitated the novel
coronavirus to adapt to humans from bat via altered cell receptor binding, changes in
viral genome replication and better evading host immune detection.
Epitopes in 2019-CoV structural proteins are differentially recognized by HLA-DR
alleles. Host immune responses orchestrated by HLA molecules determine the
outcome of infectious diseases. Antigen presentation by class II MHC isoforms play a
critical role in inducing CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cell-mediated immune responses. It is
important to understand the nature of immune selection pressure and evolution of
immune escape viral mutants. Since the current outbreak is originated from Wuhan city
of China, we set out to study the 2019-nCoV epitopes displayed by HLA-DR alleles
predominantly present in the ethnic populations of China (PRC), Thailand (TH), Japan
(JPN) and Asia-Pacific Region (APR). Thus, we calculated the average binding affinity

score of each of the predicted 15-mer peptides from functionally important four
structural proteins of 2019-nCoV.

A total of 134 unique average HBA TCEs were identified in 16 islands/hotspots across
the structural protein sequences (Figure 2; Supplemental Table 2). The lowest and
highest numbers of average HBA TCEs were identified in nucleocapsid protein (n=11),
and spike protein (n=78), respectively. This result reveals that mutations in spike protein
may contribute to changes in viral virulence observed in 2019-nCoV. The overall binding
affinity patterns of HLA-DR alleles from different countries were similar, however there
are some exceptions: i) no HBA epitope was identified in nucleocapsid protein for TH,
JPN and APR dominant HLA-DR allele, while this protein exhibited 3 and 8 TCEs for
PRC and Global population set alleles, and ii) HLA-DR alleles for APR and TH
recognized lower (n=15) and higher (n=65) number of HBA epitopes, respectively.
Nevertheless, delineating common epitopes is crucial for designing universally potent
subunit vaccine. Thus, we investigated common epitopes that are recognized by all
dominant HLA-DR alleles prevalent in the five ethnic populations. Comprehensively, 8
unique HBA epitopes distributed across Spike (n=2; 232-GINITRFQTLLALHR-246; and
233-INITRFQTLLALHRS-247),

Envelope

(n=3;

98-ASFRLFARTRSMWSF-112;

and

99-

SFRLFARTRSMWSFN-113) proteins, were identified (Figure 2; Supplemental Table 2).
The high affinity epitopes identified in the functionally important regions of Spike and
Membrane proteins could be critical in modulating immune responses to circulating
2019-nCoV. Many of the low binding affinity regions in the structural proteins may favor
viruses to evade host antiviral immunity. Our analysis suggests that a subunit vaccine
containing the eight immunodominant HLA-DR epitopes can induce effective antiviral Tcell and antibody responses in different ethnic populations.

In summary, the present study provided a detailed genetic analysis of 2019-nCoV
genome evolution and potential universal epitopes for subunit vaccine development.

SUPPLEMENTAL TABLES
Supplemental Table 1 - Summary of authors, source laboratories and metadata from
GISAID for 2019-nCoV genomes analyzed in this study.

Supplemental Table 2 - Amino acid sequences of high confidence mean HBA (IC <=
10nM) CD4 T-cell epitopes from functionally important regions of the four structural
proteins (S, E, M and N). The details of protein name, starting and ending positions of
epitopes in the given protein, and epitope sequences are provided. The unique epitope
sequences for each protein and the universal epitopes commonly recognized by HLADR alleles of all five population sets (highlighted in red) are listed at the end of each
table.
