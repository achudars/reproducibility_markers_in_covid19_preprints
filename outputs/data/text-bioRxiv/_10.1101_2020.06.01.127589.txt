Abstract
Several molecular datasets have been recently compiled to characterize the activity of SARSCoV-2 within human cells. Here we extend computational methods to integrate several different
types of sequence, functional and interaction data to reconstruct networks and pathways activated by the virus in host cells. We identify the key proteins in these networks and further
intersect them with genes differentially expressed at conditions that are known to impact viral
activity. Several of the top ranked genes do not directly interact with virus proteins though
some were shown to impact other coronaviruses highlighting the importance of large-scale data
integration for understanding virus and host activity.

Introduction
To fully model the impact of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19
pandemic, requires the integration of several different types of molecular and cellular data. SARSCoV-2 is known to primarily impact cells via two viral entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [1].
However, much less is currently known about the virus activity once it enters lung cells. Similar to
other viruses, once it enters the cell response to SARS-CoV-2 leads to the activation and repression
of several pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways and networks [2]. Predictive mechanistic models
about the activity of these pathways, the key proteins that participate in them and the regulatory
networks that these pathways activate is the first step towards identifying useful drug targets.
Recently, several studies provided information about various aspects of the molecular activity of
SARS-CoV-2. These include studies focused on inferring virus-host interactions [3, 4], studies
focused on the viral sequence and mutations [5], studies profiling expression changes following
infection [6] and studies identifying underlying health conditions that lead to an increased likelihood
of infection and death [7, 8]. While these studies are very informative, each only provides a specific
viewpoint regarding virus activity. By integrating all of this data in a single model we can enhance
each of the specific data types and reconstruct the networks utilized by the virus and host following
infection.
Several unsupervised methods have been developed for inferring molecular networks from interaction and expression data [9, 10]. However, these usually cannot link the expression changes
observed following infection to the viral proteins that initiate the responses. To enable such analysis that directly links sources (viral proteins and their human interactors) with targets (genes
that are activated / repressed following infection) we extended SDREM method [11, 12], which
reconstructs regulatory and signaling networks and identifies key proteins that mediate infection
signals. SDREM combines Input-Output Hidden Markov models (IOHMM) with graph directionality assignments to link sources and targets. It then performs combinatorial network analysis
to identify key nodes that can block the signals between sources and targets and ranks them to
identify potential targets for treatments. Here we extended SDREM so that it can utilize static
phosphorylation, time series single cell expression data and information on the expression of viral
genes.

The extended method was applied to two gene expression datasets profiling responses to SARSCoV-2 in bulk and single cells. As we show, the networks reconstructed using these datasets were
in very good agreement and have also agreed with independent proteomics studies. The networks
identified several relevant genes as potential targets. Intersecting the list of top-scoring SDREM
genes with genes identified as differentially expressed (DE) in several of the underlying conditions
further narrows the list of candidate targets. Many of the top predictions are not directly interacting
with viral proteins and so cannot be identified without integrating several different data types.

Results
We integrated several condition specific and general molecular datasets to reconstruct infection
pathways for SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells. While SARS-CoV-2 is known to primarily impact cells via
two viral entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, much less is currently known about the virus activity
within lung cells. To model the pathways it activates and represses and their potential impact on
viral load we start with host proteins known to interact with virus proteins [3, 4], and attempt to
link them through signaling pathways to the observed dynamic regulatory network following viral
infection. Next, our method ranks all proteins based on their participation in pathways that link
sources (proteins directly interacting with the virus) and targets (expressed genes) and selects top
ranking pathways. These are used to reconstruct networks which contain proteins and interactions
that are likely to play key roles in either increasing or decreasing viral loads. We further intersected
these top ranked proteins with up and down regulated genes in a large cohort of lung expression
data from conditions that are known to impact SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.

Reconstructed signaling and regulatory network from bulk transcriptomics
We used our SDREM method to reconstruct signaling and regulatory networks activated following
SARS-CoV-2 infection. We first combined virus-host and host-host protein interaction data with
bulk time series expression data of lung epithelial cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Methods). The
reconstructed network is presented in Supplementary Figure S1. The signaling part contained 252
proteins, of which 203 are source proteins (host proteins that interact with viral proteins) and 49
are proteins that do not directly interact with viral proteins. These 49 proteins included 34 TFs

that directly regulate the expression downstream target genes and 15 internal (signaling) proteins
which serve as the intermediate between the source proteins and the TFs.
We first examined the 203 source proteins selected by the method. These represent only 17.7%
of the 1148 human proteins that were experimentally identified as interacting with virus proteins
(and that served as input to the method). The most enriched GO term (using ToppGene [13]) for
the 203 selected source proteins is ’viral process’ (FDR=2.178e-14). In contrast, no GO category
related to viruses is found to be significant for the full set of 1148 source proteins. This indicates
that by integrating several diverse datasets SDREM is able to zoom in on the most relevant source
proteins from the two studies.
The 15 internal proteins are also enriched for relevant functions including ’cellular response to
steroid hormone stimulus (FDR=1.153e-9)’ which is also significantly associated with the 34 target
TFs (FDR=1.666e-12). The combined set of 49 non-source proteins are also significantly enriched
with sex hormone response related functions. The role of sex hormone in COVID-19 was recently
reported [14].
We further validated the proteins identified by SDREM by comparing them to 543 proteins that
were determined to be phosphorylated following infection with SARS-CoV-2 [15]. We observed a
significant overlap between SDREM selected proteins and the list of phosphorylated proteins (19
out of 252 proteins are phosphorylated: hyper-geometric test p-value=6.35e-5).

Integrating phosphorylation data to reconstruct networks
While the phosphorylation data can serve as a validation, we can also use it as an input to increase
the prior for including a protein in the reconstructed network (Methods). Given the significant
intersection between the networks reconstructed without such data and the phosphorylation data
we next reconstructed networks that use this data in addition to the protein-protein, protein-DNA
interaction and time series expression data.
Networks learned with this data included a total of 261 proteins with 204 source proteins 17 internal
proteins and 40 TFs (Figure 1). We again observe ’viral process’ as the most enriched category
for the source proteins (Supplementary Table S1). (FDR=1.173e-10). The 17 internal proteins
are significantly enriched with transcription relevant GO terms such as ”negative regulation of
transcription, DNA-templated (FDR=2.772e-7)” and sex hormone stimulus relevant functions such

as ”intracellular steroid hormone receptor signaling pathway (FDR=2.772e-7)”. The 40 target TFs
are enriched with ”positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (FDR=1.066E-39)”
and ”response to hormone (FDR=2.738E-12)”, which are consistent with the function of internal
proteins.
In addition to identifying proteins that play a major role in key pathways, SDREM can also be
used to identify pairs of proteins that, together, control a significant number of pathways (i.e.,
pairs that are expected to have the largest impact in a double KO experiment, Methods). For the
learned network SDREM also identified 28712 protein pairs. These protein pairs are composed
of 243 distinct proteins (203 sources, 17 internal, 22 TFs), which slightly differ from the proteins
identified based on their individual rankings (243/261=93.% single knock-out proteins are also
found in double knock-out analysis). See Supplementary Table S1 for the complete list of protein
pairs.

Reconstructed signaling and regulatory network from single-cell transcriptomics
To further narrow down the list of key signaling and regulatory factors involved in SARS-CoV2 response we next used SDREM to analyze time series scRNA-Seq SARS-CoV-2 infection data
(Methods). The signaling part reconstructed for this data contained 244 proteins, of which 172
are source proteins (host proteins that interact with viral proteins) and 72 are proteins that do
not directly interact with viral proteins. These 72 proteins included 49 TFs that directly regulate
the expression downstream target genes and 23 internal (signaling) proteins which serve as the
intermediate between the source proteins and the TFs. We found that the majority of the 244
proteins (159/65.2%, p-value=2.26e-12) are shared between the single-cell and bulk reconstructed
networks (135, source proteins 14 TFs, and 10 internal proteins). Figure 2 presents the conserved
signaling network at the intersection of both models. The most enriched GO term (using ToppGene)
for the 135 selected source proteins is ’viral process’ (FDR=1.01e-11). The enriched GO terms for
the 24 non-source proteins include ’regulation of transcription’(FDR=3.23e-19), and ’response to
cytokine’ (FDR=6.250E-15). Please refer to Supplementary Table S2 for the detailed GO terms.

Activity of top ranked genes in underlying health conditions
To further narrow down the list of potential host genes that impact viral loads and activity we next
looked at the activity of these genes in a set underlying health conditions that were determined to
impact SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates. Table 1 presents the 7 conditions we looked at.
For each of these we identified one or more lung gene expression dataset and ranked genes by the
DE score (up or down, Methods) for each condition. We next intersected the different sets of top
DE genes from each condition with top 100 ranked source and internal genes found by both the
bulk and single cell SDREM network and with selected target TFs (Methods). The intersection
results are presented in Figure 3 (See Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 for bulk SDREM result
with phosphorylation and Supplementary Figures S4 and S5 for single-cell SDREM result with
phosphorylation). We identified several parameters for which the intersection is significant meaning
that many of the top SDREM genes are also DE in several of the conditions. For overlap with top
individual list, using a quantile threshold of 0.25 and sum threshold of 2 results in 33 genes with
(p value = 2.63e-6, hypergeometric distribution), as shown in Figure 3C. Some of the genes in the
intersection are TFs that are expressed in many tissue (e.g., JUN and FOS) and are also known to
have important roles in lung. CAV 1 is another interesting gene which is essential in the acute lung
injury pathogenesis [16]. More generally the list of genes is enriched for GO terms that include
‘cellular response to chemical stimulus’ (p value = 1.80e-11), ‘viral process’ (p value = 2.37e-10),
transcription and metabolism relevant functions.
We also focused on the list of top 1000 pairs identified as described above. There were 91 unique
genes in the overlap top pair list from bulk SDREM and single cell SDREM analysis, and we
analyzed the intersection between them and the condition specific genes. Using a quantile threshold
of 0.25, sum threshold of 3, we obtained an overlap of 21 genes (p value = 1.57e-7), as shown in
Figure 4. This list of genes is enriched for GO terms that include ‘response to external stimulus’
(p value = 5.08e-8), ‘nitrogen compound metabolic process’ (p value = 9.34e-8) and several other
immune, metabolism and transcription relevant functions.

Intersection with RNAi or CRISPR knockdown studies
We next compared the 261 proteins identified by SDREM from bulk RNA-seq expression with RNAi
and CRISPR screens for multiple coronaviruses (Methods). We identified 16 proteins (p value =
6.32e-4) which have been previously shown to affect coronavirus load in RNAi screen experiments
(Table 2). It is worth noting that 4 genes on this list (ATM, CAV1, SMAD3 and UBE2I) are also
identified as condition related genes (p value = 2.82e-2) and thus appear in all relevant datasets
we analyzed (network analysis, condition related and RNAi). The smaller list of top 1000 protein
pairs identified by SDREM (168 proteins) includes 10 proteins (p value = 7.70e-3) which have been
annotated to alter coronavirus replication across different RNAi experiments. Of these 10 proteins,
RAB7A is a potentially interesting target. RAB7A is a lysosomal-endosomal protein that is found
in alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. RAB7A has an important role in disease pathogenesis
and is part of both the endosomal and lamlellar body-multivesicular body organelles whose normal
function is required for proper surfactant packaging and secretion in the lung [17]. In addition to
the 4 genes previously identified as condition-associated by the single ranking method the pairs
method also identified EPHA2 as a condition related gene (p value = 2.14e-2). Table 2 summarizes
the identified proteins supported by RNAi or CRISPR experiments.
In a similar manner, we also analyzed the set of 244 proteins identified by SDREM from single-cell
RNA-seq expression data against the same list of RNAi and CRISPR screens across coronaviruses
(Methods). Table 2 also lists the 14 proteins identified as previously shown to affect coronavirus
load in RNAi or CRISPR screen experiments (p value = 2.50e-3). Interestingly, 11 proteins (∼78%)
are identified by both reconstructed networks (bulk and sc, Table 2). Again, 4 out of the 14 genes
on this list (ATM, CAV1, CSNK2A1 and SMAD3) are also identified as condition related genes (p
value = 7.82e-2). Among these genes, all except CSNK2A1 are also identified in the bulk network.
Finally, the list of top 1000 protein pairs identified by SDREM (217 proteins) includes the same
14 proteins (p value = 8.28e-4) which have been annotated to affect coronavirus replication across
different RNAi and CRISPR experiments.

Potential treatments for predicted genes
We looked for potential treatments for 90 total proteins (48 from bulk analysis and 67 from singlecell analysis) identified at the intersection of top ranked SDREM and underlying condition genes.
Table 3 lists 32 human proteins that we identified as potential drug targets using curated databases
of bioactive molecules such as ChEMBL, Pharos and ZINC. Among these potential drug targets,
56% (i.e., 18 out of 32) are not characterized as SARS-CoV-2 interactors (i.e., non-source in our
networks). Additionally, among the 32 human proteins, 8 proteins (25%) are identified separately
from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. It is worth highlighting that Gordon et al. [3] tested antiviral activity of 47 compounds targeting known SARS-CoV-2 interactors. Of these drug targets
tested for inhibition of viral infection, only BRD2 and CSNK2A2 are also identified in our list.
They reported viral inhibition for CSNK2A2 with compound Silmitasertib (CX-4945), whereas the
antiviral activity results for BRD2/4 across 6 different compounds were inconclusive. Supplementary Table S3 provides the full list of chemical associations to human proteins identified as potential
drug targets.

Discussion
By integrating data from several relevant molecular resources, we were able to identify a subset
of genes that are (1) connected to viral proteins in signaling pathways (2) impact downstream
expression response to the infection and (3) identified to be DE in underlying conditions. We used
computational methods that combine probabilistic graphical models with combinatorial network
analysis to rank top genes and pairs of genes and to intersect these with underlying condition genes.
Our methods identified a list of 19 genes in the overlap of all relevant datasets when looking at top
single node rankings and 39 genes when looking at pair rankings. Functional analysis of these genes
indicated that many are related to host response to viral infections and to replications, the two
key types of pathways expected to be activated following infection. While some of the top ranked
proteins are well known, several are novel predictions that have not been previously studied since
they do not directly interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As shown in Table 3, 32 of the proteins in
our intersection sets have known potential treatments, including 9 proteins associated with approved
drugs (EGFR, ERBB2, ESRRA, IRAK1, JAK2, NR3C1, PLAU, RELA and RXRA). Of these, 5

are not characterized as SARS-CoV-2 interactors. Thus, these proteins have not been previously
highlighted as potential molecular factors of SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Additionally, the full list of
potential drug targets includes CSNK2A1 and UBE2I which, while not directly interacting with a
CoV, are identified as RNAi or CRISPR screen hits for CoV highlighting them as likely candidates
for further experimental evaluation. Moreover, any gene pair from Table 3, where one protein in the
pair has an associated approved drug and the other protein has several high-affinity compounds
associations, for example (ERBB2, EP300) or (ERBB2, MYC), are also potentially interesting
therapeutic targets, thus, suggesting a drug mixture to treat multiple targets.
While our analysis utilizes a time series SARS-CoV-2 infection data, it only contains 2 time points
following infection which may miss a number of critical events. As more expression datasets are
released, we intend to expand our model by applying it to the increasing amounts and types of
gene expression data profiled following infection.
The methods we presented is general and can be applied to integrate several additional molecular
studies focused on SARS-CoV-2. Since each of the data types (interactions, expression, knockdown
etc.) provides a unique and complementary viewpoint about the virus activity, a model that can
integrate the data to reconstruct a mechanistic model is required in order to obtain insights that
will help identify potential treatments.

Materials and Methods
Datasets
We used both condition specific and general interaction data for learning dynamic viral infection
models. We also collected lung expression data for conditions that were reported to impact SARSCoV-2 mortality and infection rates. Below we provide information about all data used in this
study.

Viral host interactions and phosphorylation data
We used the SARS-CoV-2 and human protein-protein interactome reported by Gordon et al. [3]
and Stukalov et al. [4] which identified 1396 protein interactions between 31 viral proteins and
1148 human proteins using affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis. While this data is
virus specific, we note that prior studies for other viruses indicated that a single screen is unlikely
to fully cover the entire set of virus-host interactions [18]. Supplementary Table S4 provides the
full list of interactions we used. We also used a protein phosphorylation data dataset in which
phosphorylation levels were profiled at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post SARS-CoV-2 infection [15].
Using this data, we obtained 543 significantly phosphorylated proteins across all time points profiled
(student t-test p-value<0.05 and log2fold change>0.4). Please refer to Supplementary Table S5 for
the detailed list of phosphorylated proteins.

RNAi or CRISPR knockdown data
We searched the literature for a list of RNAi or CRISPR screen experiments which test the impact
of gene knockdown/knockout on coronavirus load. In particular, we collected RNAi screening
data for 5 different coronaviruses: IBV-CoV, MERS-CoV, MHV-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Additionally, we collected CRISPR screens for
SARS-CoV-2 [29, 30]. The combined set of RNAi and CRISPR screen hits is comprised of 482
human proteins in cells infected with a coronavirus, 40 of which were present in our initial SARSCoV-2 and human network. Table 4 summarizes the hits used in this study while Supplementary
Table S6 provides the full list of screen hits used in this study.

General Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions
Protein-DNA interactions were obtained from our previous work [31], which contains 59578 proteinDNA interactions for 399 Transcription Factors (TFs). Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were
obtained from the HIPPIE database [32], which contains more than 270000 annotated PPIs and
for each provides a confidence score which was further used in our network analysis (see below).

Time series transcriptomics
We used two longitudinal transcriptomics datasets to learn the regulatory and signaling networks
underlying the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first was a bulk expression dataset in which iPSC
derived lung epithelial cells were infected and profiled before and 1 and 4 hours following infection
[33]. The expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were also quantified for this dataset and we
were able to obtain expression levels for 11 viral proteins which were further used in our analysis
(see below).
In addition to the bulk data we also used a single-cell RNA-seq data on Calu-3 cell line profiled at
0 (mock), 4, 8, 12 hours post SARS-CoV-2 infection. We filtered all the cells with less than 200
expressed genes or with over 40% mitochondrial genes [34]. We also filtered expressed in less than
3 cells or with a very low dispersion (< 0.15).

Underlying condition lung expression data
We collected and analyzed lung expression data from several reported underlying conditions that
impact SARS-CoV-2 infection. Table 1 provides information on these conditions, the impact they
were reported to have and the source and type of expression data we analyzed. Most of the data
we used was from bulk microarray expression studies of lung tissues. These included studies focused on lung cancer [35], hypertension [36], Diabetes [37], Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) [38], and smoking [39]. We also used single cell RNA-seq lung data for gender expression analysis and for inferring aging related genes from [40]. For each dataset, the differentially
expressed genes are extracted using the R package ‘limma’ for microarray data [41] and by using a
ranksum test for single cell data.

Reconstructing dynamic signaling and regulatory networks using SDREM
For the analysis and modeling of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cells, we extend the Signaling
Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (SDREM) [12] method. SDREM integrates time-series bulk gene
expression data with static PPIs and protein-DNA interaction to reconstruct response regulatory
networks and signaling pathways. SDREM iterates between two methods. The first, DREM [42]
uses an input-output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) to reconstruct dynamic regulatory networks
by identifying bifurcation events where a set of co-expressed genes diverges. DREM annotates these
splits and paths (co-expressed genes) with TFs that regulate genes in the outgoing upward and/or
downward paths.
To extend the SDREM to the single-cell level, instead of using DREM as for analyzing bulk transcriptomic data, here we incorporated our previously developed methods SCDIFF and CSHMM
[31, 43] to reconstruct the regulatory network underlying the single-cell time-series RNA-seq data.
Based on the single-cell regulatory network inference, we generate a list of transcription factors with
3 metrics to evaluate their importance. First, percentage of regulated cells; a TF that regulates a
higher percentage of cells will also be assigned with an importance score. Second, p-value for the
TF regulation; we calculated a hypergeometric test p-value for each of the predicted TFs based on
their target genes. If the target genes of a TF are differentially expressed between points that the
TF is regulating, such TF-regulation would be considered more reliable and it should be weighted
with a higher score. Namely, TFs will a smaller p-value will be assigned with a higher importance
score. Third, we also evaluate the TFs based on their Lasso logistic coefficients from the single-cell
regulatory inference (by SCDIFF); a TF with a higher coefficient should be treated with a higher
importance. Finally, we calculate an overall importance score IS for each of the TFs predicted
from the single-cell regulatory network inference method based on the above 3 scoring metrics.

IS(x) = Wpe ∗ Scorepe (x) + Wpv ∗ Scorepv (x) + Wco ∗ Scoreco (x)
Scorepe (x) = (pe(x) − µ(pe))/σ(pe)
Scoreco (x) = (co(x) − µ(co))/σ(co)
Scorepv (x) = (pv(x) − µ(pv))/σ(pv)
pv(x) = −10 ∗ log2 (pvalue(x))

Where pe(x), co(x), pvalue(x) are the percentage score, coefficient score, and p-value score for TF
x respectively. Wpe , Wpv , Wco are weights for each of the scoring metrics. By default, they are all
set as 1 for equal importance. However, users are allowed to specify a different set of weights to
emphasize specific scoring metrics. If a TF is found to regulate multiple edges of the reconstructed
trajectory and thus have multiple overall scores, the maximal one will be used. We ranked all
the predicted TFs based on their overall scores. The top ones (under a specific cutoff parameter
specified by SDREM method) will be chosen as the final predicted regulators for the following
analyses.
The second part of SDREM uses a network orientation method [11], which orients the undirected
protein interaction edges such that the targets can be explained by relatively short, high-confidence
pathways that originated at the inputs with provided PPIs, source proteins, and target TFs. Generally, SDREM searches for high scoring paths that start at the virus proteins, continues with
the host proteins they interact with and ends with TFs and their targets. By iterating between
identifying TFs based on the expression of their targets and connecting identified TFs to source
(virus) proteins, SDREM can identify a set of high scoring pathways and regulators. These are then
analyzed using graph-based scoring methods as we discuss below to identify key proteins mediating
viral signals.

Using human SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomics and protein phosphorylation data
with SDREM
We modified SDREM to improve its performance on the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomics data. To
remove the potential batch effect, we have performed cross-sample normalization between the bulk
RNA-seq sample between different time points (control, 1dpi, 4dpi). Another extension we applied
is the use of the viral expression data to remove sources and their connected host proteins. Specifically, we first identified the non-expressed viral genes in those datasets. Then, we remove all the
host source proteins that interact with the viral proteins that correspond to those non-expression
viral genes. We integrate the protein phosphorylation data by adjusting the prior for significantly
phosphorylated proteins. We first set the prior of all proteins as a default value (e.g, 0.5). Then we
scaled the log2fc of the significantly phosphorylated proteins to the range of [0.5, 1] with a min-max
normalization method. To mitigate the impact of the outliers, we replaced the min-max values with

5% and 95% percentiles. Proteins (nodes) that are highly phosphorylated will be assigned with a
larger prior and they will be favored in the SDREM network analysis.

Identifying key genes in SDREM reconstructed networks
To rank top genes identified by SDREM, we used the strategy described in [11] to estimate in silico
effects of removing a protein from the signaling network component of an SDREM model. The
method computes how the connectivity to the TFs is affected when a node (gene) or a combination
of nodes, is removed. Intuitively, this score captures the impact of the removal on the path weights
that remain for linking TFs to sources (eqn.2).

Where A is the deleted node, T is the set of all targets, P (t) is the set of paths to the target t
to be considered, I(∗) is an indicator function that has the value 1 if the condition * is satisfied,
N (p) is the set of nodes on the path p,w(p) is the path weight, which is the product of all node
priors P riorv and edge weights weighte in the path. The node prior is determined using the protein
phosphorylation data (if available). The edge weight is based on the strength for the interaction
(e.g., PPI)) between the source and target nodes of the edge.
Although single gene inference might be very informative, higher-order knockdowns (of two or
more genes) may prove to be more robust because they can target several pathways simultaneously.
Experimentally testing all possible gene combinations would be prohibitive but in-silico analysis is
much faster given the relatively small number of genes in the resulting SDREM network. Scores for
pair removals are computed in a similar way to individual scores, by finding double knockdown has
a stronger effect than expected based on the score for individual gene of the pair, which corresponds

The above eqn.3 denotes the average fraction of path weight that remains after removing paths
that contain node A and B.
Several rankings can be derived based on the score computed above. These differ in the paths used
for the scoring (top ranked or all), weather target connectivity is evaluated separately for every
source or for all sources combined and using weighted versus unweighted versions of the SDREM
network. See Supplementary Table S1 (Meta) for details on what was used in the analysis.

Analyzing underlying condition data
We examined several recent studies to determine underlying condition that impact SARS-CoV-2
mortality and infection rates [7, 8]. Based on these we selected seven different conditions for which
we were able to obtain lung expression data (bulk and / or single cell). For cancer, hypertension,
Diabetes, COPD, and smoking, we used microarray lung expression data as shown in Table 1. For
each dataset we compared the case samples with normal samples to obtain a set of DE genes and
their (adjusted) p-value using ‘limma’ [41]. For the ’age’ and ’gender’ factors, we used scRNA-Seq
data. For each sample, we averaged the expression values for each gene in all cells of the sample
to get expression data form similar to bulk data. As for ’age’, we first ordered samples based on
their age, and selected samples younger than 60 as control, and older ones as case samples. For
gender, we only focused on samples younger than 60, and used female as control to perform DE
analysis for the male samples. We next used the ranksum statistical test to compute DE p-value
for each gene. Finally, we used the assigned p-values and expression fold change signs to compute
quantile value between 0 and 1 for each gene in each condition and divided genes in top quantile for
each condition to ’over-expressed’ with label of 1, ’repressed’ with label of -1, and non-differentially
expressed gene with label of 0 (See Supplementary Table S7 for details).

Intersecting SDREM and underlying condition genes
We intersected the list of top ranked genes from the two SDREM reconstructed networks with genes
identified as significantly up or down regulated in the underlying conditions data. The intersection
was computed for several combinations of conditions and p-values and summarized in Figure 2A-B.
For each entry in that table we computed the p-value for the intersection represented in that entry
using the hypergeometric distribution.

Potential treatments for top genes
In a similar fashion to Gordon et al. [3], we searched public resources (ChEMBL25 [44], IUPHAR/BPS,
Pharos [45] and ZINC [46]), as well as literature in order to identify existing drugs and reagents
that directly modulate the candidate genes derived from our network reconstruction and conditionspecific analyses. Supplementary Table S3 provides a full list of drugs and reagents targeting the
identified candidate genes.

Software and data availability
The single-cell extension of the SDREM model (named scSDREM) is implemented in Python.

Table 2: Summary of proteins supported by RNAi or CRISPR screen experiments
identified by SDREM from time-series bulk and single-cell SARS-CoV-2 expression
data sets. For each protein, we RNA-seq experimental evidence (‘Bu’ for bulk, ‘Sc’ for single-cell,
and ‘Both’ for bulk and single-cell), whether it is a known interactor of a SARS-CoV-2 protein and
a brief description of the experimental impact on coronavirus load. Table enumerates each protein
previously reported to affect coronavirus load in RNAi or CRISPR screen experiments for the set
of proteins identified by SDREM from SARS-CoV-2 data (p values: 6.32e-4 for bulk data; 2.50e-3
for single-cell data). Proteins also listed in the top 1000 protein pairs identified by SDREM from
either bulk or single-cell data sets are shown in boldface (p values: 7.70e-3 for bulk data; 8.28e-3
for single-cell data).

Table 3: Summary of identified proteins associated with chemical compounds in
ChEMBL25, IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology, Pharos, or ZINC. For each human
protein, we show RNA-seq experimental evidence (‘Bu’ for bulk, ‘Sc’ for single-cell, and ‘Both’ for
bulk and single-cell), whether or not it is a known SARS-CoV-2 and if there are any approved
drugs for each target, respectively.

Figure 1: SDREM predicted signaling network(A) and regulatory network (B) for the time-series
RNA-seq dataset (with using protein phosphorylation data). (A) signaling network reconstructed from the time-series single-cell RNA-seq data. Red nodes denote sources, green
nodes are signaling proteins and blue nodes are TFs associated with regulating the DREM portion
of the model. The overlap between the networks is discussed in Results. (B) The regulatory
part of the network Each path represents a group of genes that share similar expression profiles.
The table presented next to each edge indicates the set of transcription factors (TFs) that are predicted to regulate the expression of genes assigned to this path. Red font indicates TF expression
is significantly down-regulated, while blue represents up-regulated TFs. TF with stable expression
(inferred to be post-transcriptionally or post-translationally regulated) are marked as Gray.
