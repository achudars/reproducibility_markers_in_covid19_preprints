ABSTRACT

52

reported symptoms, laboratory findings, pharmacological and non-pharmacological

53

treatment, comorbidities, and 30-day in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients

54

with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

OBJECTIVE: We explored longitudinal trends in sociodemographic characteristics,

55
56

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 43,267 patients diagnosed with

57

COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 and 08/31/20 and

58

followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients that were subsequently

59

hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on the month of hospitalization. We

60

summarized our findings through descriptive statistics. We used a nonparametric rank-

61

sum test for trend to examine any differences in the distribution of our study variables

62

across the six months.

63
64

RESULTS: During our study period, 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 1,081

65

(13.1%) died within 30 days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the

66

proportion of patients that died consistently declined from March (N=221/890, 24.8%) to

67

August (N=111/1,396, 8.0%). Patients hospitalized in March compared to August were

68

younger on average, mostly black, and symptomatic. They also had a higher frequency of

69

baseline comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to

70

present with abnormal laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated

71

creatinine. Lastly, receipt of mechanical ventilation and Hydroxychloroquine declined

72

from March to August, while treatment with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir increased.

INTRODUCTION

120
121

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory illness caused

122

by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1,2 As of

123

November 19, 2020, the United States (U.S.) has the highest number of reported COVID-

124

19 cases (11.5 million) and deaths (249,670) globally.2 There is a growing body of

125

literature utilizing electronic medical record data to provide “real-world” information on

126

risk factors for COVID-19 infection, severity, and fatality including certain

127

sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms, laboratory findings, underlying

128

comorbidities, and treatments.1,3-17 However, the results of these studies are largely

129

conflicting, especially among those conducted during the initial onset of the pandemic

130

compared to more recent literature, as well as among those that were regional or local

131

compared to national in scope.1,3-18

132

Conflicting findings from “real-world” studies may be at least partially due to

133

lack of consideration for the temporal and regional distribution of COVID-19 burden

134

across the U.S., secular trends in clinical practice, or potential systemic differences in the

135

characteristics of patients requiring hospitalization or treatment.9,13,15,16,18,19 Moreover, the

136

aggregation of this information at one time point and short-term assessment (e.g., one

137

month) may not accurately account for the influence of rapidly deployed and changing

138

mitigation efforts including government restrictions and policies.9,19-23 Therefore,

139

longitudinal assessment of changes over multiple time points would provide greater

140

clarity on the epidemiology and clinical management of COVID-19 and allow for indirect

141

assessment of mitigation efforts.

142

To address this knowledge gap, we explored potential trends and patterns in

143

infection rates among all U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) users diagnosed

144

with COVID-19, and clinical management for those that were subsequently hospitalized

145

at VHA medical facilities during the initial six months of the pandemic. Specifically, our

146

objectives were to describe any changes from March 1, 2020 to August 30, 2020 in 1)

147

sociodemographic characteristics, 2) reported symptoms, 3) laboratory findings, 4)

148

pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, 5) 30-day in-hospital mortality, and

149

6) comorbidities among both hospitalized and in-hospital deceased patients. As the

150

nation’s largest integrated health care system, the VHA was required to respond to

151

COVID-19 in all geographic regions.21,22 Thus, the VHA offers a unique opportunity to

152

better understand the case burden and management of COVID-19 due to its large size,

153

diverse operating environment, nationally overseen policies and practices, and relatively

154

homogenous patient population.20-22

METHODS

157

Review Board of Northern New England at the White River Junction Veterans Affairs

160

Medical Center.

Data Source & Study Population
The VHA is comprised of over 170 medical centers and 1,250 community-based
outpatient clinics.24 It provides comprehensive medical care to more than nine million

165

veterans, including primary and specialty care.24 Additionally, VHA users have access to

166

extensive inpatient care and treatment services including medical, surgical, mental health,

167

dialysis, acute and long-term care.24 The VHA has an electronic medical record system

168

with a centralized Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), which contains longitudinal

169

information on receipt of all services provided by VHA facilities including outpatient and

170

inpatient visits, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, and laboratory

171

results, as well as patients’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We obtained

172

vital status from the VHA Vital Status File.

173

Our final cohort consisted of all VHA users (age ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with

174

COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 in accordance with Centers for

175

Disease Control and Prevention standards, human confirmed case review, and/or VHA

176

10N memos.20,25,26

177
178

Outcomes

179
180

Hospitalization: We limited our reporting to a subset of patients that were subsequently

181

hospitalized for COVID-19 within the VHA health care system due to lack of complete

182

clinical and outcome data for patients that received care at a non-VHA facility. Patients

183

were indexed at the time of hospitalization for COVID-19 and categorized into six groups

184

based on the month of hospitalization. We calculated hospital length of stay (LOS) as the

185

number of days from admission to discharge or in-hospital death.

187

Mortality: Our primary endpoint of interest was 30-day in-hospital mortality. We

188

examined mortality within 30 days of hospitalization to serve as a proxy for case fatality

189

rate.5 We extended patient follow-up to September 30, 2020 to allow for sufficient

190

assessment time of our study measures. Patients remained in the cohort until date of

191

discharge or death.

192
193

Study Variables

194
195

Patient Characteristics: We examined sociodemographic characteristics at the time of

196

hospitalization for COVID-19 including age, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanicity of residence,

197

and VHA priority rating (1-8). VHA priority group served as a proxy for socioeconomic

198

status (SES) as it is partially based on income and the capacity for gainful employment. It

199

is also connected to service-related disability, reflecting both health and VHA coverage.27

200

Priority group ratings range from 1-8, with group 1 representing the highest priority (i.e.,

201

lowest SES and complete healthcare coverage).

202
203

Symptoms: We examined COVID-related symptoms within 30 days preceding

204

hospitalization for COVID-19 including abdominal pain, chills, common cold, cough,

205

diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, and sore throat.6,14,28

206
207

Laboratory Values: We examined laboratory values within seven days following

208

hospitalization for COVID-19 including white blood cell count (WBC), absolute

209

lymphocyte count (LC), platelet count (PC), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total

bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ferritin,

211

lactate, troponin I, brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), procalcitonin, c-reactive protein

212

(CRP).6,14,28

213
214

Treatments: We examined receipt of any relevant/concomitant pharmacological and non-

215

pharmacological treatment(s) during the course of patients’ hospitalization.

216

Pharmacological treatment included angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,

217

antibiotics (e.g., Azithromycin), anticoagulants, antivirals (e.g., Hydroxychloroquine,

218

Remdesivir), Azithromycin combined with Hydroxychloroquine, beta-blockers,

219

bronchodilators, corticosteroids (e.g., Dexamethasone), immune-based therapy (e.g.,

220

Tocilizumab), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statins, and/or

221

vasopressors.29,30 Non-pharmacological treatment included mechanical ventilation,

222

dialysis, and supplemental oxygen.

223
224

Comorbidities: We examined the presence of clinical comorbidities within 12 months

225

preceding hospitalization for COVID-19 according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index

226

(CCI). The CCI score is a validated, weighted measure that predicts one-year mortality,

227

with higher scores indicating greater illness burden.31,32 Additionally, we reported the top

228

10 comorbidities for both hospitalized and in-hospital deceased patients.

229

Statistical Analysis

231

For all VHA users with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, we reported the

232

frequency of cases by month of diagnosis to examine trends in overall infection rates. For

233

patients that were subsequently hospitalized for COVID-19 within the VHA, we reported

234

our findings by month of hospitalization to examine trends in clinical management during

235

the course of the pandemic.

236

We summarized our results through descriptive statistics. We reported proportion

237

for categorical variables and mean (M) with standard deviation (SD) for continuous

238

variables. We used a nonparametric rank-sum test for trend to examine any differences in

239

the distribution of our study variables across the six months. All analyses were performed

240

using Stata/MP version 15.1 software (StataCorp, 2015).

241
242

RESULTS

243
244

Frequency of COVID-19 infection among all VHA users

245

We identified a total of 43,267 VHA users with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during

246

our study period. Of these cases, 5.4% (N=2,344) were diagnosed in March, 16.1%

247

(N=6,947) in April, 10.6% (N=4,594) in May, 15.9% (N=6,867) in June, 33.2%

248

(N=14,369) in July, and 18.8% (N=8,146) in August (Ptrend<0.001).

249
250
251

Patient characteristics among VHA users hospitalized with COVID-19
Our cohort comprised 8,240 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Table 1). The

252

average LOS was 10.2 days (SD=10.9), and 13.1% (N=1,081) experienced in-hospital

253

mortality within 30-days of admission. The proportion of hospitalized patients increased

254

overall (Ptrend<0.001) and fluctuated over time, with the highest observed in April

255

(N=1,559, 18.9%) and July (N=2,279, 27.7%). The proportion of patients that

256

experienced 30-day in-hospital mortality consistently declined and was three times lower

257

in August (N=111/1,396, 8.0%) compared to March (N=221/890, 24.8%) (Ptrend<0.001).

258

Overall, hospitalized patients were older (M=68.2, SD=13,7), predominantly male

259

(N=7,799, 94.7%), and white (N=4,268, 51.8%). The majority resided in an urban area

260

(N=6,815, 82.7%), and close to 40% (N=3,189) had a priority rating of 5-6. The average

261

age of hospitalized patients increased overall from March (M=67.4, SD=13.0) to August

262

(M=68.4, SD=13.5), and patients aged 60 years and older consistently represented at least

263

70% of hospitalizations (Ptrend=0.001). Months with a greater proportion of younger (age

264

<60 years) patients included March, June, and July. Black patients represented 57.1%

265

(N=508/890) of hospitalizations in March, but consistently decreased to 30.9%

266

(N=431/1,396) by August (Ptrend<0.001). There was a consistent decline in the proportion

267

of hospitalized patients with urban residence from March (N=2,134/2,344, 91.0%) to

268

August (N=5,529/8,146, 67.9%) (Ptrend<0.001).

Clinical comorbidities among hospitalized and in-hospital deceased patients
Hospitalized patients had an average CCI score of 1.8 (SD=2.1), while those that

284

experienced 30-day in-hospital mortality had an average CCI score of 2.3 (SD=2.3)

285

(Table 3). CCI score significantly declined over time for both hospitalized (Ptrend<0.001)

286

and in-hospital deceased (Ptrend=0.02) patients.

287

The top 10 comorbidities among hospitalized patients were hypertension

288

(N=4,644, 56.4%), diabetes (N=3,170, 38.5%), coronary artery disease (N=1,566,

289

19.0%), renal disease (N=1,509, 18.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

290

(N=1,453, 17.6%), congestive heart failure (N=1,196, 14.5%), obesity (N=1,157, 14.0%),

291

peripheral vascular disease (N=860, 10.4%), dementia (N=856, 10.4%), and cancer

292

(N=747, 9.1%). The proportion of hospitalized patients with these comorbidities

293

significantly declined from March to August with the exception of cancer (Ptrend=0.11).

294

The top 10 comorbidities among in-hospital deceased patients were similar to

295

those reported among hospitalized patients. These included hypertension (N=662,

296

61.2%), diabetes (N=482, 44.6%), renal disease (N=283, 26.2%), coronary artery disease

297

(N=265, 24.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (N=219, 20.3%), congestive

298

heart failure (N=210, 19.4%), dementia (N=169, 15.6%), peripheral vascular disease

299

(N=146, 13.5%), obesity (N=144, 13.3%), and cerebrovascular disease (N=131, 12.1%).

Similarly, the proportion of in-hospital deceased patients with these comorbidities

301

declined over time.

309

ferritin (N=3,614, 43.9%), and lactate (N=3,576, 43.4%). More than one-half (N=4,237,

51.4%) of patients had elevated CRP. For almost all laboratory values, patients

311

hospitalized in March either had a similar or greater proportion of abnormal results

312

compared to those hospitalized in later months. However, the proportion of patients with

313

elevated CRP significantly increased over time (Ptrend<0.001).

Pharmacological and non-pharmacological COVID-19 treatment
Close to one-half (N=3,774, 45.8%) of hospitalized patients were treated with

319

corticosteroids, the use of which significantly increased (Ptrend<0.001) (Table 5).

320

Dexamethasone represented 65% (N=2,433/3,774) of corticosteroids overall and

321

increased from 14% (N=33/245) in March to 83% (N=732/882) by August (Ptrend<0.001).

322

About two-fifths (N=3,290, 39.9%) of patients were treated with antivirals, which

323

significantly declined overall (Ptrend<0.001). Among antivirals, Hydroxychloroquine was

324

the most commonly used treatment in March (N=492/529, 93.0%) and April (N=514/577,

325

89.1%), while treatment with Remdesivir dramatically increased from May (N=191/232,

326

82.3%) to August (N=543/580, 93.6%). Very few patients were treated with

327

Azithromycin in combination with Hydroxychloroquine (N=698, 8.5%). This was

328

common in March (N=370/890, 41.6%), but dropped to less than 1% by August

329

(Ptrend<0.001). Less than one-quarter (N=1,006, 12.2%) of patients were treated with

330

vasopressors, which substantially declined over time (Ptrend<0.001).

331

Close to one-fifth (N=1,461, 17.7%) of hospitalized patients received mechanical

332

ventilation, with greater representation in March (N=279/890, 31.4%) compared to

333

August (N=183/1,396, 13.1%) (Ptrend<0.001). A small proportion of patients received

334

dialysis (N=618, 7.5%) and supplemental oxygen (N=611, 7.4%) during their

hospitalization for COVID-19. Treatment with dialysis declined from March

(N=129/890, 14.5%) to August (N=59/1,396, 4.2%) (Ptrend<0.001), while use of

343

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines longitudinal

344

trends in COVID-19 infection rates as well as clinical management within a national

345

health care system. Within the VHA, COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates

346

fluctuated between March and August, but increased overall. We identified peaks for

347

both cases and hospitalizations in April, July, and August. Patients hospitalized in March

348

compared to later months were younger, mostly black, urban-dwelling, symptomatic, and

349

more likely to present with abnormal laboratory findings. They also had worse overall

350

health as indicated by higher CCI scores and frequency of baseline comorbidities. Lastly,

351

we observed a decline in use of intensive (e.g., mechanical ventilation) and experimental

352

(e.g., Hydroxychloroquine) treatments for COVID-19, as well as a consistent decline in

353

30-day in-hospital mortality over time.

354

Many prior studies have worked to identify risk factors for COVID-19 infection,

355

severity, and fatality.1,3-18 Literature published early on in the pandemic, as well as more

356

recent studies, have consistently reported an elevated risk of both testing positive and

357

severe or fatal disease among older populations (age 65 years) after adjusting for

358

sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities.4,9,13,16 In our study, we found that

359

the majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were older. However, we also

360

identified a higher proportion of younger patients hospitalized in months with

361

corresponding elevations in infection rates. This finding may support the notion that

362

young and presumably healthy individuals can contribute to the inadvertent spread of

363

COVID-19.9,17,19 Therefore, containing disease spread may require more ubiquitous

364

government restrictions and policies including testing, contact tracing, social distancing

365

and work-from-home guidelines.9,23 Moreover, we identified a significant decline in 30-

17

366

day in-hospital mortality and treatment-related indicators of severe illness (e.g., receipt of

367

mechanical ventilation or vasopressors) from March to August despite an overall increase

368

in the average age of hospitalized patients.13 This phenomenon may be due to experience

369

gained from treating patients with COVID-19 and/or effective action taken by the VHA

370

to meet care and resource demands, as evidenced by the positive transition in treatment

371

modalities. During our study period, we observed treatment with experimental and

372

ineffective drug regimens such as Hydroxychloroquine decline to less than 1% by

373

August, while use of more evidence-backed treatments such as Dexamethasone and

374

Remdesivir significantly increased.11,19,33,34

375

In addition to older age, prior work has documented evidence of increased risk for

376

COVID-19 infection, severity, and/or fatality among patients with certain symptoms, pre-

377

existing medical conditions, and abnormal laboratory findings.4,7,13,14,28 Although the

378

significance and magnitude of associations varied between studies, our finding of

379

declining mortality seems to support the idea of greater risk for severe or fatal disease

380

among patients that have these risk factors. In our study, patients hospitalized in March

381

compared to later months had more exacerbating symptoms (e.g., fever, dyspnea, cough)

382

and evidence of biomarkers on inflammation, infection, cardiac and muscle injury,

383

decreased liver and kidney function.4,7,13,14,28 Additionally, we found that both

384

hospitalized and deceased patients had more underlying comorbidities in March

385

compared to later months including severe cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal

386

disease, and obesity. However, deceased patients had a higher frequency of such

387

comorbidities. While more comorbidities may contribute to disease severity or fatality,

388

they may not contribute to greater risk for COVID-19 infection as we did not find

18

389

proportional declines in cases or hospitalizations. The specific reasons for the apparent

390

decline in case severity and fatality are unclear, but may be due to increased

391

dissemination of risk information and potentially greater compliance with public health

392

measures among those with poorer overall health.

393

Lastly, various studies have reported elevated hospitalization and mortality rates

394

among black compared to white patients with COVID-19, citing differences in access and

395

quality of care, more underlying comorbidities, and lower SES as potential reasons for

396

these disparities.6,8,10,35-37 In our study, we observed a higher proportion of black

397

compared to white patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March, similar proportions of

398

black and white patients in April, and substantially fewer black patients from May

399

through August. However, black patients consistently had a hospitalization rate that was

400

more than two times their overall veteran population share of 12%.38 The initially higher

401

proportion of black patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in our study could potentially

402

be explained by structural confounding in which more black patients reside in densely

403

populated urban areas that were also more likely to be affected during the first outbreak

404

of COVID-19.5,13,36 Additionally, more black patients may work in service and essential

405

industries that do not allow work from home and create challenges for social

406

distancing.5,39 Although we did not explore differences in mortality by race, a recent

407

study by Rentsch et al. on national cohort of 16,317 VHA patients with COVID-19 found

408

evidence of greater adjusted risk for contracting COVID-19 among racial and ethnic

409

minorities, but no difference in 30-day mortality.5 Unlike the general U.S. population, all

410

patients treated within the VHA have insurance coverage, and could readily seek high

411

quality health care and treatment services if needed.5,13,40 Therefore, in addition to

19

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.18.427092; this version posted January 18, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

412

bolstering the capacity of health care systems and implementation of strict public health

413

measures, ensuring equitable care access should be a central goal of COVID-19

414

mitigation efforts.5,9,13

415
416

Limitations

417

We acknowledge important limitations to our study. The VHA typically treats a

418

population that is older, medically complex, and have greater risk behaviors compared to

419

the general U.S. population.41 However, prior work has found no evidence of differences

420

in comorbidity burden between VHA and non-VHA users after controlling for age, sex,

421

race, geographic region, and urbanicity of residence.24 Additionally, the frequency and

422

type of comorbidities identified in this study are similar to those reported among non-

423

VHA patients hospitalized with COVID-19.15-17 Therefore, our findings may still be

424

generalizable to the larger U.S. population. Our analysis was limited to patients

425

diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19 within the VHA health care system and may

426

not capture cases, hospitalizations, treatments received, or deaths occurring at non-VHA

427

facilities. We reported the month-to-month and cumulative disease burden on the VHA,

428

which may not account for regional differences in sociodemographic characteristics,

429

government restrictions and policies, or the magnitude and timing of case peaks. Future

430

work on the regional intensity and timing of outbreaks may be beneficial for identifying

431

specific areas with elevated disease burden and help inform allocation of limited

432

resources.

435

Our study provides greater insight on the longitudinal trends in COVID-19 infection rates

436

and clinical management within a national health care system. We found evidence of

437

declining COVID-19 severity and 30-day in-hospital mortality, despite increases in cases,

438

hospitalizations, and average age. Therefore, actions taken by the VHA may have been

439

effective for bolstering treatment capacity and mitigating disease burden at the patient-

440

and health system-level.
