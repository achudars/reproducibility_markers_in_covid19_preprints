Abstract
As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still ongoing and dramatically influences our life,
the need for recombinant proteins for diagnostics, vaccine development, and
research is very high. The spike (S) protein, and particularly its receptor binding
domain (RBD), mediates the interaction with the ACE2 receptor on host cells and
may be modulated by its structural features. Therefore, well characterized
recombinant RBDs are essential. We have performed an in-depth structural and
functional characterization of RBDs expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and
human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. To structurally characterize the native
RBDs (comprising N- and O-glycans and additional posttranslational modifications) a
multilevel mass spectrometric approach was employed. Released glycan and
glycopeptide analysis were integrated with intact mass analysis, glycan-enzymatic
dissection and top-down sequencing for comprehensive annotation of RBD
proteoforms. The data showed distinct glycosylation for CHO- and HEK293-RBD
with the latter exhibiting antenna fucosylation, higher level of sialylation and a
combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Additionally, from both putative Oglycosylation sites, we could confirm that O-glycosylation was exclusively present at
T323, which was previously unknown. For both RBDs, the binding to SARS-CoV-2
antibodies of positive patients and affinity to ACE2 receptor was addressed showing
comparable results. This work not only offers insights into RBD structural and
functional features but also provides a workflow for characterization of new RBDs
and batch-to-batch comparison.

Introduction
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 100
million individuals and influences our daily lives. The coronavirus is an enveloped
RNA virus containing three different structural proteins in the membrane, the envelop
(E) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the spike (S) glycoprotein [1]. The S
protein is heavily glycosylated and forms a trimer on the SARS-CoV-2 surface. Each
S protein carries 22 N-glycosylation sites [2] and consists of an S1 and an S2
subunit. Whereas the S2 subunit is necessary for membrane fusion, the S1 subunit
directly interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the
human respiratory tract and facilitates the entry into the host cell [3]. In particular, the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit mediates the interaction with the
ACE2 receptor [4]. This domain carries two N-linked glycans at positions N331 and
N343 and, depending on the source, one or two O-linked glycosylation sites
(T323/S325) are occupied [2, 5, 6]. The predicted O-glycosylation site at T323 is not
present in the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 and has been hypothesized to have an
influence on the interaction with the ACE2 receptor [7] and may be critical for
conformational changes of the RBD [8]. Further studies have shown the role of
glycosylation on ACE2-RBD binding. Crystallographic structures have confirmed the
interaction between RBD and ACE2 receptor and highlighted the importance of
ACE2 glycosylation in the interaction [9]. However, the RBD used was expressed in
insect cells, and the role of RBD glycosylation was not addressed [9]. In a more
recent publication the interaction of the N-glycan at position N343 of the RBD with
the ACE2 receptor has been suggested by modelling the interaction using atomistic
molecular dynamic simulations [10]. Another study revealed that the infectivity
decreased by 1200 times (decrease of relative infectivity to 0.083%) when both Nglycosylation sites (N331 and N343) of the spike protein were silenced compared to
the wild type versions. These findings suggest that glycosylation is involved in the
binding to the receptor – either directly or by providing conformational stabilization
[11]. In line with its role in virus-ACE2 interaction, the RBD is the primary target of
neutralizing antibodies [12]. Interestingly, an antibody named S309, pulled from
serum from a SARS-CoV-1 recovered patient, bound an epitope containing also
glycosylation [13]. This binding site is also conserved in SARS-CoV-2 and was
predicted as an epitope for neutralizing antibodies [14]. The neutralizing S309
antibody was shown to bind to a protein epitope (331-344) in combination with the
glycan at N343. The antibody showed especially strong interaction with the core
fucose and to a minor extent with the remaining glycan structure [13]. All these
findings emphasize that the assessment of RBD glycosylation is highly important.
Recombinantly produced S proteins are essential tools in the fight against SARSCoV-2, contributing to a further understanding of the interaction mechanism,
providing efficient components for diagnostic purposes, and helping in vaccine
development [15]. However, it is important to understand that glycosylation and other
structural characteristics may differ considerably between different biotechnologically

produced proteins and their natural forms. Considering the relevance of RBD
glycosylation on ACE2 binding and recognition by neutralizing antibodies, the use of
well-characterized S proteins is essential. The S protein, in particular, has been
produced as full-length protein as well as in a short version containing the RBD [16].
Site-specific glycosylation analysis of the 22 N-glycosylation sites of the recombinant
S glycoprotein expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells showed
mainly complex type glycans but also, at certain glycosylation sites, high mannose
structures and in lower amounts some hybrid structures [2, 5]. In particular, the two
N-glycosylation sites (N331 and N343), which are located in the RBD were found to
carry mainly complex type glycans as well as spurious amounts of high mannose
glycans. Similarly, for the S1 subunit recombinantly produced in HEK293 cells,
mainly complex type glycans were found at both sites [5]. As predicted by
Uslupehlivan et. al [7] an O-glycosylation at the position T323 and/or at S325 was
found. Whereas one report, analysing the whole S protein recombinantly produced,
showed only trace levels of O-glycans [2] another study detected high levels of Oglycosylation [6]. Still, in these studies the localization of the O-glycosylation site at
T323 and/or S325 was not possible. O-glycosylation at these two positions is also
thought to be important to stabilize the conformation of the RBD or to introduce
conformational changes [8]. All these studies have been performed using
recombinant versions of the spike protein or subunits thereof. Interestingly, upon
expression in HEK293 cells the amount of sialic acids varied from low to high
depending on whether the complete S protein or only the S1 subunit was produced
[5], suggesting that the N- and O-glycosylation is dependent on the context of the
protein (S, S1 or RBD only). So far only terminal glycan epitopes of HEK293
produced RBD have been studied by NMR, however an assessment of the entire Nglycan structure, composition and the relative quantification of the N-glycans could
not be achieved [17]. Furthermore, the O-glycosylation was neglected completely.
Also, a characterization of the intact RBD is still missing, providing information on the
combination of the glycans as well as on additional protein backbone modifications.
Here we present an in-depth structural and functional characterization of two
commercially available SARS-CoV-2 RBDs produced in two different expression
systems, HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To achieve
comprehensive structural information, a multilevel characterization was performed
(Figure 1). Both RBD samples were initially analyzed at the intact level by top-down
sequencing using MALDI in-source-decay (MALDI-ISD) mass spectrometry (MS)
[18, 19] and by sheathless capillary electrophoresis (CE)-MS after full N- and Odeglycosylation to establish their protein sequences and putative non-glycan
modifications. With the established sequences and the help of sequential
glycosidase treatment, the glycoforms on both N- and the O-glycosylation sites were
assigned. Our findings were confirmed by glycopeptide analysis and the analysis of
released O-glycans by porous graphitized carbon (PGC) nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. To
assess functional differences between the two RBD samples, we determined their

binding characteristics to ACE2 and sera of patients who recovered from a previous
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

analysis using CE-MS and MALDI-ISD-MS the samples are structurally characterized by glycan
dissection, glycopeptide analysis and released glycan analysis. Their functional characterization was
performed by measuring their binding characteristics to ACE2 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

(v/v) and incubated overnight at 37°C. For removing antenna fucosylation 20 µg of
HEK293-RBD sample was incubated with 4.4 µg fucosidase α1-2 or 8.8 µg
fucosidase α1-3,4 overnight at 37°C. Afterwards all samples were buffer exchanged
with 100 mM ammonium acetate pH 3.0 and subsequently analyzed by sheathless
CE-MS.
For sheathless CE measurements a Sciex CESI 8000 instrument combined with a
Bruker Impact qTOF-MS was used. Bare-fused silica CE capillaries equipped with a
porous tip were obtained from Sciex (Framingham, MA). To avoid protein adsorption
fused silica capillaries were permanently positively coated with PEI following the
protocol of Sciex [20]. To assess the performance of the PEI coated capillary, a
protein test mixture was analyzed. For intact RBD analysis a background electrolyte
(BGE) consisting of 9% acetic acid and 10% methanol was used. The separation
capillary and the conductive line were filled with the BGE for 3 min (100 psi forward
pressure) and 1 min (75 psi reverse pressure), respectively. Afterwards the sample
was injected for 15 s with a pressure of 5 psi (11.2 nL; 1.75% of the total capillary
volume) followed by a plug of BGE for 25 s with a pressure of 0.5 psi. The separation
was carried out by applying 20 kV (reversed polarity) at 20°C for 45 min. After the
separation was completed the voltage was ramped down to 1 kV in 5 min with a
pressure of 50 psi (forward and reverse).
The CE was coupled to MS using a nano-electrospray ionization source. The system
was operated in positive ion mode with a dry gas flow rate of 2.0 L/min, a dry
temperature of 120°C and a capillary voltage of 1300 V. The collision cell voltage
was set to 40 eV and the quadrupole energy to 5 eV. An in-source collision-induced
dissociation energy (applied between funnel 1 and 2) of 50 eV was used. The
transfer time and the pre-pulse storage time were set to 150 µs and 20 µs,
respectively. The monitored m/z range was 500-4000.
ESI Data analysis of intact RBD
Intact RBD data were deconvoluted using the DataAnalysis 5.3 (Bruker Daltonics)
maximum entropy algorithm. Deconvoluted mass spectra were baseline subtracted
and smoothed using the Gaussian smoothing function with a width of 0.5 Da and one
cycle. Glycoforms were assigned based on the average masses observed and
observed mass shifts with enzyme treatments. Additionally, data obtained from Nglycopeptide analysis and O-glycan release was used to confirm findings and
distinguish glycan isomers.
MALDI-ISD top-down protein sequence analysis
Fully deglycosylated RBD samples were reduced for 30 min at 50°C using DTT. Two
µL of the reduced sample were spotted on a hydrophilic anchor of an MTP
BigAnchor sample plate and incubated. After 2 min, the remaining droplet was
removed and the spot was washed using 0.1% TFA in water. Subsequently, 1 µL of
sDHB matrix solution (25 µg/µL in 50% acetonitrile/49.9% water/ 0.1% TFA) was

deposited on the dried sample spot. MALDI-ISD spectra were acquired with a
rapifleX MALDI-TOF MS instrument (Bruker) in positive reflector ion mode using a
method optimized for ISD acquisition provided by the manufacturer. The detection
voltage was set to 3.26 kV and a sum of 35,000 laser shots were accumulated at
1000 Hz at elevated laser power adapted to the sDHB matrix. The spectra were
processed in FlexAnalysis (Compass for flexSeries 2.0) using a smoothing step (5
cycles 0.15 Da) and baseline subtraction (TopHat). Peaks were picked using the
SNAP2 algorithm up to 5,000 Da and the SNAP algorithm up to 10,000 Da. The
spectra were calibrated using a MALDI-ISD spectrum from 50 pmol bovine ubiquitin
prepared with sDHB. For interpretation and annotation of ISD spectra BioTools 3.2
SR7 was used (Bruker).
Glycopeptide analysis by RPLC-MS/MS
For glycopeptide generation a double digestion with trypsin followed by elastase was
performed. Here, 300 µg (259 µL) of RBD protein was reduced with 10 µL DTT (45
mM) for 30 min at 50ºC. Afterwards the protein was alkylated with 5 µL IAA (100
mM) for 30 min at 37ºC in the dark followed by addition of 10 µL DTT (45 mM) and
incubation for 15 min at 50ºC to stop the alkylation reaction. The samples were
allowed to cool down to 37ºC and incubated with 60 µL Trypsin (100 ng/µL) for 12 h
at 37ºC. To stop the digestion reaction the samples were heated for 1 min to 90ºC
and the concentration was determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) resulting in a protein concentration of 0.94 µg/µL. For
elastase digestion 120 µg (127 µL) of tryptic digested RBD was incubated with 2.4
µL (1 µg/µL) elastase for 12 h at 37ºC. The digestion reaction was stopped by
adding 1.3 µL of formic acid. DTT, IAA, trypsin and elastase were dissolved in 50
mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer with a pH of 7.8.
The digested samples were separated using a nanoElute (Bruker) nanoflow UHPLC
equipped with an aurora 25 cm x 75 μm C18 column with a particle size of 1.6 μm
(IonOpticks, Parkville, Victoria, Canada). For each run 800 ng of digested protein
was injected. The separation was performed using water and acetonitrile as mobile
phase A and B, each containing 0.1% formic acid. A linear gradient from 2 to 35% in
90 min was used for analyte separation with a column temperature of 50ºC. The
nano-LC was connected to a timsTOF Pro (Bruker) using a nanoBooster (Bruker)
supplying acetonitrile enriched dopant gas (0.2 bar). The capillary voltage was set to
1400 V and a dry gas of 3.0 L/min with a temperature of 180ºC was used. The
quadrupole ion energy was set to 5 eV and the collision cell collision energy to 7 eV.
A pre-pulse storage time of 10 μs was used. AutoMS/MS data was recorded as
follows: for MS measurements a m/z range between 600 and 3000 was monitored
and spectra were acquired with a speed of 2 Hz; for MS/MS measurements a m/z
range of 50 to 3000 was monitored and a dynamic spectra acquisition between 4
and 10 Hz was used depending on target intensity, which was set to 8000 counts.
For fragmentation preferably charge states between 3+ and 6+ were selected. The
collision energy ramp settings were adapted from Hinneburg et al. [21] with a

collision energy ramp from 31 eV at m/z 700 to 80 eV at m/z 1500. The collision
energy stepping was 100% for 40% of the MS/MS spectra (preferred fragmentation
of peptide moiety) and 50% for 60% of the MS/MS spectra (preferred fragmentation
of glycan moiety).
Data analysis of glycopeptides
MS/MS data of N-linked glycopeptides were processed using DataAnalysis 5.3 and
MGF peak lists were imported into BioPharma Compass 2021 (Bruker) and further
analyzed using the glycopeptide analysis workflow. This workflow includes MS/MS
spectra classification using typical fragmentation patterns to determine the peptide
mass and the glycan mass of a glycopeptide. The peptide sequences were then
identified using the theoretical digest feature of the software. In a second search, the
classified MS/MS spectra were submitted to a glycan search using the GlycoQuest
search engine within BioPharma Compass 2021 software. The most intense isotope
of each charge state ([M+H]+, [M+2H]2+, or [M+3H]3+) was extracted and the
glycopeptides were quantified and results normalized to the total peak intensity of all
glycopeptides within one sample to 100%.
Released O-glycan analysis by PGC nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS
O-glycan alditols released from RBD samples were prepared using a 96-well plate
sample preparation method as previously described [22]. In brief, 20 µg of RBD
samples were applied to the hydrophobic Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in a 96-well plate format. Protein denaturation was
achieved by addition of 75 µL denaturation mix (72.5 µL 8 M GuHCl and 2.5 µL 200
mM DTT) to each well, followed by shaking for 15 min and incubation at 60°C in a
moisture box for 30 min. Subsequently the unbound material was removed.
The N-glycans were released by addition of PNGaseF (2 U of enzyme diluted with
water to 15 µL) to each well and overnight incubation at 37 °C. Released N-glycans
were removed from the PVDF plate by centrifugation. After removal of N-glycans, the
O-glycans were released from the PVDF membrane immobilized sample via
reductive β-elimination. Briefly, 50 μL of 0.5 M NaBH4 in 50 mM KOH was applied
onto each PVDF membrane well after rewetting with 3 μL of methanol. Plates were
shaken for 15 min on a horizontal shaker and incubated in a humidified plastic box
for 16 h at 50°C. After incubation and cooling to RT, released O-glycans were
recovered by centrifugation at 1000 g for 2 min into 96-well collection plates. The
wells were rewetted by 3 μL of methanol and washed three times with 50 μL of water
with 10 min incubation steps on a horizontal shaker prior to centrifugation at 500 g
for 2 min. Before desalting the collected samples were concentrated to
approximately 30 μL under vacuum in a SpeedVac concentrator at 35°C for 2 h.
Subsequently, 3 μL of glacial acetic acid were added to quench the reaction followed
by brief centrifugation to collect the sample at the bottom of the well. Collected Oglycan alditols were then desalted and purified followed by a desalting and PGC

clean-up using a 96-well plate based protocol [22]. Samples were dried in a
SpeedVac concentrator directly in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plates and
redissolved in 10 μL of water prior to PGC nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis.
The analysis of O-glycan alditols was performed following a method described
previously [22]. Measurements were performed on an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system
(Dionex/Thermo) equipped with an in house-packed PGC trap column (5 μm
Hypercarb, 320 μm x 30 mm) and an in-house-packed PGC nano-column (Grace
Discovery Sciences, Columbia, MD, USA) (3 μm Hypercarb 100 μm x 150 mm)
coupled to an amaZon ETD speed ion trap (Bruker). Mobile phase A consisted of 10
mM NH4HCO3, while mobile phase B was 60% (v/v) acetonitrile/10 mM NH4HCO3.
To analyze glycans, 2 μL of sample prepared from 4 μg glycoprotein was injected
and trapped on the trap column using a 6 μL/min loading flow of 1% buffer B for 5
min. Separation was achieved with a gradient of B: 1- 52% over 72 min followed by a
10 min wash step using 95% of B at a flow of rate of 0.6 μL/min. The column was
held at a constant temperature of 45°C. Ionization was achieved by using 2-propanol
enriched nitrogen gas at 3 psi provided by a nanoBooster source (Bruker). The
capillary voltage was set to 1000 V and a dry gas temperature of 280°C at 5 L/min
was used. MS spectra were acquired within an m/z range of 380-1850 using
negative ion mode. Smart parameter setting (SPS) was set to m/z 900. MS/MS
spectra were recorded using the top three highest intensity peaks.
Data analysis of released O-glycans
Structures of detected glycans were confirmed by MS/MS in negative mode [23].
Glycan structures were assigned on the basis of the known MS/MS fragmentation
patterns in negative-ion mode [24-26], elution order, and general glycobiological
knowledge, with help of Glycoworkbench [27] and Glycomod software [28]. Relative
quantification of individual glycans was performed by normalizing the total peak area
of all glycans within one sample to 100%. Relative abundances of specific glycan
structures were grouped by summing relative abundances of each glycan multiplied
by the number of motifs per glycan.
SARS-CoV-2-IgG ELISA with RBD antigens
The antigens (intact or glycosidase treated HEK293-RBD or CHO-RBD) were used
to coat immunoassay plates at a concentration of 2 µg/ml. Subsequently, blocking
was performed with blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA).
Serum collected >10 weeks after onset of first symptoms from 12 SARS-CoV-2 PCR
positive tested donors was applied to the RBD-coated wells at a dilution of 1:101. As
a negative control, a 1:101 diluted serum pool containing 10 sera taken from healthy
individuals in the year 2012 was used. Subsequently, bound IgG from sera was
detected by anti-human IgG-HRP (Seramun Diagnostica GmbH, Heidesee,
Germany) and developed with tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped using

order to determine the linear correlation between the absorption values, the Pearson
correlation was calculated using GraphPad Prism 9. Linear regression was
employed for the visualization of the correlation. For this analysis, the negative
control value was excluded.
ACE2 receptor binding assay
Intact and glycosidase treated RBD, S1 subunit and the S protein (InVivo Biotech)
were biotinylated using 10 molar excess of NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific).
Immunoassay plates were coated with 2.5 µg/ml recombinant angiotensin converting
enzyme-2 (ACE2, Sigma Aldrich). Subsequently, the assay plate wells were blocked
using blocking buffer containing 1% BSA. Dilutions of the biotinylated antigens
ranging from 1 µg/ml to 0.001 µg/ml were applied to the ACE2-coated assay plate
wells in duplicates. Bound biotinylated antigens were detected using streptavidin
peroxidase conjugate (Roche) and developed with TMB. The reaction was stopped
using sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate
reader. GraphPad Prism 9 was used to plot log(dose) response curves (variable
slope, four parameters) and to compute nonlinear fits which were utilized to calculate
the half-maximal concentrations (EC50).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Structural characterization of CHO and HEK293 produced RBDs
We characterized the RBD domains (amino acids 319-541 containing a C-terminal
His-tag) produced in CHO and HEK293 cells. This domain contains two Nglycosylation sites at positions N331 and N343 as well as two potential Oglycosylation sites at T323 and S325. Analysis of the intact RBDs revealed a
complex pattern of signals comprising different N- and O-glycans and additional
protein backbone modifications. Therefore, to unravel this heterogeneity and achieve
comprehensive structural characterization, we used a multilevel approach (Figure
1). Next to classical released glycan and glycopeptide approaches, we applied a
step-by-step dissection of glycans at the intact level similar to the work of
Wohlschlager et. al for the biopharmaceutical etanercept [29].
3.1.1. Characterization of the protein backbone after N- and O-glycan removal
To get information on the integrity of the protein backbone, the RBD proteins were
treated with PNGaseF to remove the N-glycans and with an endo-α-Nacetylgalactosaminidase in combination with a mix of sialidases to remove the Oglycans. After deglycosylation, the RBDs were analyzed by CE-MS for intact mass
and MALDI-ISD MS for top-down sequencing.
Analysis of the samples by CE-MS resulted in one main peak in the base peak
electropherogram (BPE) corresponding to the RBD. For the RBD produced in CHO
cells, the observed averaged mass (26033.9 Da) was 119.0 Da higher than the
theoretical mass calculated solely based on the amino acid sequence (25914.9 Da)
(Figure 2A). As the RBD contains a free cysteine at position C538 [30], it was
presumably cysteinylated (+119.1 Da). This modification is often observed for free
light chains during antibody production using CHO cells [31]. After reducing the
disulfide bonds with DTT, the mass of the deglycosylated and completely reduced
protein was 25923.0 Da, which is consistent with the expected theoretical mass
(25923.0 Da) confirming the presence of cysteinylation (data not shown). For the
RBD expressed in HEK293 cells, a deconvoluted mass of 26144.9 Da was observed
(Figure 2B). Considering a cysteinylation of the free cysteine also in the HEK293RBD, an additional mass difference of 110.9 Da was observed compared to the
theoretical mass indicating additional modifications.

Both RBD samples were analyzed at the intact level by top-down sequencing using
MALDI-ISD MS after full reduction and N- and O-deglycosylation. MALDI-ISD
provides large terminal sequence tags and detects terminal (and internal) PTMs from
intact proteins. For both RBDs we detected a C-terminal sequence tag of 73 amino
acids (RMS error of 0.028 Da) verifying the expected C-terminus of the sequence.
The N-terminal sequence tag, however, was not consistent between both RBDs.
While the CHO-RBD sequence was in full agreement with the MALDI-ISD spectrum
(data not shown), the HEK293-RBD sequence was found to be N-terminally
extended by pyro-Glu (mass shift of 111.03 Da). 52% of the sequence were

confirmed this way including an N-terminal sequence tag of 46 residues for the nonglycosylated and 29 residues for the O-glycosylated form (Supplementary Figure
S1). Of note, the HEK293-RBD came with a slightly different sequence compared to
the CHO-RBD, resulting in an additional glutamine at the N-terminus after cleavage
of the signaling peptide (Figure S1). Taking pyroglutamic acid formation into
consideration, the measured mass perfectly fits the theoretical mass (26145.1 Da).
The N-terminal pyroglutamic acid formation was further confirmed by bottom-up
analysis (data not shown). In addition, we found a species migrating before the main
signal in the BPE with a +42.3 Da mass difference (26187.4 Da). This difference in
mass might correspond to acetylation, however, it could not be confirmed by bottomup analysis after trypsin digestion. This species was only observed in HEK293-RBD
and not in CHO-RBD.
3.1.2. RBD O-glycan characterization
The RBD has two potential O-glycosylation sites at position T323 and S325. To
characterize the O-glycans, the de-N-glycosylated RBD (after treatment with
PNGaseF) and the released O-glycans were analyzed by CE-MS (Figure S2) and
PGC nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS (Figure 3), respectively. Table S1 summarizes the
obtained results. In CHO-RBD mainly core 1 structures with 2 sialic acids (H1N1S2)
were observed. HEK293-RBD showed a much more diverse O-glycosylation pattern
with a core 1 structure with 2 sialic acids as the main signal. Additionally, several
core 2 structures, with and without fucose as well as with sulfation were detected.
These data are in accordance with the data in Figure 2B for the sample treated with
an endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, where an additional signal of 26875.7 Da was
observed. This mass corresponds to an H2N2 modification (theoretical mass
26875.8 Da) which is presumably a core 2 O-glycan which cannot be cleaved by the
endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Similar glycoforms were not detected in CHORBD. The position of fucoses, either to the terminal galactose or the Nacetylglucosamine were confirmed by MS fragmentation and treatment with different
fucosidases (Figure S3).

Hitherto published S protein bottom-up studies have not revealed the O-glycan
attachment site, leaving both T323 and S325 as valid options [2, 6]. To resolve this,
we follow a different strategy based on N-glycan removal (with PNGaseF) and Oprotease cleavage using the enzyme OpeRATOR in combination with a mix of
sialidases. The O-protease cleaves the protein at the N-terminal site of an Oglycosylation site (Figure S3). This would result in a loss of the amino acids 319-322
from the RBD if the O-glycosylation is on T323 or 319-324 in case S325 carries the
O-glycan. As shown in Figure S4A, only one signal with a mass of 25919.0 Da was
observed for the CHO material, which correlates to the RBD cleaved at T323 with a
core 1 O-glycan H1N1 (theoretical mass 25918.8 Da). No RBD cleaved at S325 was
observed. In HEK293-RBD, the same signal with a core 1 glycan H1N1 was
observed also indicating that the glycosylation is located at T323 (Figure S4B). Next
to this signal, an amount of uncleaved RBD with presumably core 2 O-glycan

structures was detected. This is in line with a recent article that shows that the used
O-protease can cleave N-terminal to core 1 but not core 2 glycan structures, similar
to endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase [32]. To confirm that the core 2 structures are
located at T323 we performed MALDI-ISD MS analysis using super-DHB as a
matrix. In contrast to CID fragmentation in bottom-up analysis, MALDI-ISD is known
to result in mainly singly charged c- and z+2 ions with labile modifications remaining
intact, which allows to localize O-linked glycosylation sites. MALDI-ISD MS of CHORBD after N-glycan and sialic acid removal showed N-terminal fragments (c-ions)
with core 1 structure (H1N1) for the site T323 and no additional glycosylated
fragments at S325 (+365.1 Da) could be detected confirming the presence of the Oglycosylation at T323 (Figure S5A). No fragments of T323 without glycosylation
were observed indicating full site occupancy. The analysis of HEK293-RBD
comprising only core 2 structure O-glycans (after N-glycan and core 1 O-glycan
removal) clearly showed that the core 2 structures are also located on T323 (Figure
S5B). In conclusion, the combination of intact analysis of O-protease treated RBDs
together with MALDI-ISD allowed location of the O-glycans to the T323 with high
confidence.
3.1.3 Assessment of RBD N-Glycosylation
We studied the two N-glycosylation sites N331 and N343 using a bottom-up
glycopeptide approach combined with a step-by-step dissection of glycans at the
intact level [29]. Whereas the glycopeptide data yielded the glycan composition per
site, we studied the combination of these glycans at the intact level [33].
The intact RBDs were first incubated with a mixture of sialidases and galactosidases.
These enzymes removed the sialic acids and the terminal galactoses on the N- as
well as O-glycans, resulting in considerably simplified deconvoluted mass spectra as
shown in Figure S6 and Figure S7. Overall, mainly fucosylated complex type
glycans were observed for both RBDs (>90.0%). This is in line with previous studies
on HEK293 produced intact S protein or S1 subunit [2, 5]. The dissection of the
terminal galactoses also permits direct distinction between N-acetyllactosamine
(LacNAc) repeats and additional antenna. CHO-RBD showed a higher relative
abundance of LacNAc repeats than HEK293-RBD. Additionally, CHO-RBD showed a
higher antennarity, with two triantennary structures as the most abundant
glycoforms, contrary to HEK293 material with di- and triantennary glycans as major
signals. This was confirmed by the analysis of the glycopeptides (Figure S8, Table
S2 and S3). In general, more di- and triantennary structures were observed for
HEK293-RBD (N331: 78.4% and N343: 84.5%) compared to the CHO-RBD (N331:
48.1% and N343: 72.1%). Therefore, CHO-RBD showed a larger contribution of
tetraantennary structures and LacNAc repeats (N331: 42.7% and N343: 24.4%)
compared to HEK293-RBD (N331: 15.7% and N343: 9.9%). Between both
glycosylation sites a difference in the number of LacNAc repeats and high-antennary
structures was observed with minor amounts on N343 compared to N331.

In addition, we found spurious amounts of hybrid type glycans only at N343 and only
in HEK293-RBD (0.8%), similar to previous publications [2, 5]. Regarding high
mannose glycans, low amounts were detected for both RBDs. In the case of
HEK293-RBD, Man5 and Man6 glycans with and without phosphorylation were
observed, whereas in the case of CHO-RBD Man5 and Man6 glycans carrying an
additional phosphate were detected. For HEK293-RBD the high mannose and
phosphorylated high mannose structures show combined abundances of 3.1%
(N331) and 1.3% (N343) in line with the findings of Watanabe et al. [2] for full-length
S protein. For CHO-RBD the distribution was more skewed with 7.7% (N331) and
0.9% (N343).
Besides, in the deconvoluted mass spectrum of the HEK293-RBD treated with
sialidase and galactosidase a pattern of signals with a mass shift of +308.1 Da was
observed. A combination of one galactose and one fucose could explain this mass
shift. It was shown in literature that β-galactosidases are not able to remove the
terminal galactose if an antenna fucose, either linked to the galactose itself or to the
N-acetylglucosamine, is present [34]. Therefore, we incubated the HEK293-RBD
either with α1-2 fucosidase and in parallel with α1-3,4 fucosidase to remove fucoses
linked to the galactose and N-acetylglucosamine, respectively. Incubation with these
fucosidases allowed the β-galactosidase to remove the terminal galactose. As shown
in Figure S3, after removing the differently linked antenna fucoses, the +308.1
signals disappear completely confirming antenna fucosylation and providing
information on the linkage of the antenna fucose with a predominant linkage to the
N-acetylglucosamine. Additionally, antenna fucosylation in HEK293-RBD was
confirmed by glycopeptide analysis (26.7% and 33.8% of antenna fucosylation on
N331 and N343, respectively) (Figure S9, Table S2 and S3). No antenna
fucosylation was found for CHO-RBD with any of the approaches.
The analysis of the intact RBDs without any previous enzymatic treatment resulted in
a very complex mass spectrum (Figure 4). Based on the information obtained for the
released O-glycans, glycopeptide and enzymatically-treated intact RBDs the spectra
were confidently assigned. In particular, the HEK293-RBD exhibited a large
heterogeneity. In addition to the variability resulting from the acetylation and antenna
fucosylation, which were not observed in CHO-RBD, also a higher degree of
sialylation was observed for HEK293-RBD. This was also supported by the
glycopeptide data in which the CHO-RBD showed only 2.5% or 0.8% sialylated
glycans, whereas the HEK293-RBD contained 56.4% or 36.3% on N331 or N343,
respectively (Figure S10, Table S2 and S3). Furthermore, in CHO-RBD only
monosialylated species were observed, while in the HEK293-RBD mono-, di- or
trisialylated species were detected. Interestingly, these high sialylation levels were
not observed by Watanabe et al. who reported only 22% sialylation on N331 and 4%
sialylation on N343 for the full length S protein [2]. This might be due to the different
constructs with RBD expression versus S1 subunit or S-protein. A similar effect of
lower sialylation on the complete S protein has also been previously reported by

comparing the entire S protein expressed in HEK293 cells with the S1 subunit [5].
Whereas S protein carried either ∼ 40% or 10% sialylation on N331 or N343, the S1
subunit carried 80% or 50% on N331 or N343, respectively. These findings highlight
that sialylation, which influences the isoelectric point of a protein, can change with
the length of protein expressed (S, S1 or RBD) and must be taken into account.

Finally, to support our assignments, the intact mass spectra were reconstructed from
the glycopeptide data as described [33]. Figure 5A, shows a very strong correlation
for the CHO-RBD confirming the assignments. For HEK293-RBD reconstructed
mass spectrum showed a shift towards lower masses compared to the intact profile
(Figure 5B). Proteins with higher sialylation levels often show a discrepancy
between the intact and the glycopeptide-reconstructed mass spectra [33] which
could be attributable to a non-random combination or to a biased ionization efficiency
of sialylated glycopeptides.

3.2. Functional characterization of CHO and HEK293 produced RBD domains
Next to the structural characterization of the RBD also a functional characterization
was performed. To assess the RBD functionality, an ACE2 receptor binding assay
and a binding assay for anti-RBD antibodies from COVID-19 patient sera were
performed.
3.2.1. SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding assay
The binding of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies in sera taken from 12 Covid-19
patients more than 10 weeks after the onset of the first symptoms and RBD was
determined using an ELISA assay. For the assay, the intact CHO- or HEK293-RBD,
as well as deglycosylated RBD samples, were used. As a negative control, a pool of
10 sera collected in 2012 was used. As expected, higher absorption values were

observed for the 12 COVID-19 patient sera compared to the negative control
indicating binding of specific antibodies to the RBDs (Figure 6). Both intact RBD
samples showed similar absorption values, while absorption values were slightly
elevated when the deglycosylated RBDs were employed. Also, for the negative
controls, the deglycosylated RBD showed elevated absorption values compared to
the intact RBD. This is most probably the result of unspecific binding which may be
increased after deglycosylation. This was also reflected in the correlation of the
absorption values of the patient sera. The correlation of these values gained using
intact RBDs and their deglycosylated version (CHO: R2 09681, HEK293: 0.9755)
was slightly lower than the correlation obtained using intact RBD produced by CHO
and HEK293 cells (R2 0.9894) or deglycosylated CHO- versus deglycosylated
HEK293-RBD (R2 0.9905) (Figure S11).

human sera from 2012. The dashed red line indicates the threshold for SARS-CoV-2 positive samples

3.2.2 ACE2 receptor binding assay
Using a plate-based ACE2 receptor binding assay, a dose-dependent binding of both
CHO- and HEK293-RBD was observed (Figure 7A). Comparing the RBDs
expressed in both production systems, similar binding properties were observed with
a trend towards a lower EC50 values for CHO-RBD. As glycosylation has been
hypothesized to have a role in the interaction with ACE2 [10, 11], we additionally
tested the RBDs after deglycosylation. Deglycosylation was found to reduce the
binding of the RBDs as reflected in an approximately 2 times increase of the EC50

values. Of note, Qianqian et al. reported that the infectivity is reduced to only 0.08%
after removal of the N-glycosylation sites [11]. Our results, although they show a
slight variation between the glycosylated and non-glycosylated versions, do not
explain this drastic difference in infectivity. Furthermore, the presence of
endoglycosidases could also have affected the biotinylation rate resulting in the
overall reduced binding. Supporting the hypothesis of Qianqian, these glycans may
be crucial for stabilizing the trimeric spike protein rather than influencing the binding
affinity [11].
Additionally, we compared the ACE2 receptor binding affinity of both RBDs to the S1
subunit, as well as the intact S protein. The binding affinity of the ACE2 receptor to
the RBDs was significantly increased compared to the S1 subunit and the S protein
(Figure 7B). This might be due to the higher accessibility to ACE2 of the RBD only
compared to the S1 subunit or even the S protein. As shown by Casalino et al., in
the trimeric S protein the RBD can be in an up or down conformation and, therefore,
more or less accessible to the ACE2 binding [8]. By using the S protein or the S1
subunit, some parts of the RBD might not be accessible or less accessible for the
ACE2 receptor which may explain the reduced binding affinity. These results
highlight the importance of a proper selection of recombinant proteins.

Conclusion
RBD proteoforms were comprehensively characterized by combining intact protein,
glycopeptide and released glycan analysis with enzymatic glycan dissection and topdown sequencing. The combination of multiple MS workflows was fundamental for
assigning the intact RBD proteoforms. In particular, glycan dissection of the intact
protein using sequentially different glycosidases has shown to be very powerful to
annotate complex intact RBD spectra. The glycopeptide data, next to provide sitespecific information, was used to simulate an in silico intact spectrum and
corroborate our assignments. This approach was applied to RBD samples from both
CHO and HEK293 cells. In case of the low sialylated CHO-RBD a very strong
correlation was obtained. However, for the HEK293-RBD the simulated spectrum
showed a clear shift to a lower mass associated with the loss of sialic acids or an
ionization bias of the glycopeptides. This stresses the importance of assessing intact
proteoforms to avoid skewing of the data in any direction. The observed differences
in N-glycosylation, with higher sialylation levels and antenna fucosylation for
HEK293-RBD and low sialylation levels but high-antennary and LacNAc repeat
structures for CHO-RBD are typical for the two expression systems. For the Oglycans, CHO-RBD showed mainly core 1 type glycans while HEK293-RBD
presented a combination of core 1 and core 2 type O-glycans. Furthermore, using
alternative approaches, such as N-terminal cleavage at the O-glycosylation site and
MALDI-ISD we localized the O-glycosylation site to T323, previously unknown.
Following this approach, the obtained annotated spectra could be used for batch-tobatch comparison of different RBD batches or for release testing in companies
producing RBD based vaccines.
From a functional point of view, both RBDs showed similar binding to antibodies from
COVID-19 patient sera as well as to the ACE2 receptor. The ACE2 binding was
increased compared to S protein or S1 subunit, likely due to higher accessibility.
After deglycosylation, the binding of RBDs to anti-spike antibodies remained
unaffected. For ACE2 a minor decrease in the EC50 values was observed, which
does not fully explain the infectivity decrease with aglycosylation observed in
previous studies. These findings suggest that glycosylation plays a role in
conformational stabilization rather than affecting binding affinity. Further studies are
warranted on the role of RBD glycosylation in ACE2 binding.
