The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 started in fall 2019. A range of different
mammalian species, including farmed mink, have been confirmed as susceptible to infection
with this virus. We report here the spillover of mink-adapted SARS-CoV-2 from farmed
mink to humans after extensive adaptation that lasted at least 3 months. We found the
presence of four mutations in the S gene (that gave rise to variant: G75V, M177T, Y453F and
C1247F) and others in an isolate obtained from SARS-CoV-2 positive patient.

1. Introduction

49

Coronaviruses are known as potential zoonotic pathogens, and severe acute respiratory

50

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third highly pathogenic member of this family

51

to have emerged in the 21st century (1). While mass vaccinations are currently underway, the

52

question of the fate of the virus remains open. The concept of herd immunity and eradication

53

of the virus is somewhat unrealistic when considering the prevalence, genetic diversity, and

54

the existing animal reservoirs. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in

55

different mammalian species worldwide, including dogs, cats, tigers, lions, ferrets, minks,

56

felines, and deer (2,3). SARS-CoV-2 infections in farmed mink have recently been confirmed

57

in European countries (4). Transmission of the virus from infected mink to humans has been

58

reported in Denmark and the Netherlands (5–7). After Denmark, Poland is the second-largest

59

producer of mink pelts in Europe, with 354 active Polish mink farms harbouring

60

approximately 6.3 million mink in total (8).

61

2. Material and methods

62
63

This study was approved by the Independent Bioethical Committee for Scientific Research at

64

the Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland (Statement no. NKBBN/183/2020).

65
66

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was performed at the University of Gdansk, Poland using

67

sample containing RNA isolated from positive swab (amplification of two target genes in

68

RT-PCR). ARTICv3 amplicon generation followed by Oxford Nanopore Technology

69

MinION run was performed (Quick 2020). Reads were basecalled, debarcoded and trimmed

70

to delete adapter, barcode and PCR primer sequences. ARCTIC pipeline software were used

71

to generate SARS-CoV-2 genome. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the procedure

72

recommended by Nextstrain.org (Hadfield et al., 2018)

3. Results and Discussion

74

The capacity of coronaviruses to transfer between mammalian species is not surprising. First,

75

the transfer of highly pathogenic variants from bats usually occurs via intermediate hosts.

76

Infection of dromedary camels and palm civets and later transfer to humans has been

77

described for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively (9). A more comprehensive analysis

78

of existing strains suggests that this was not an exception. The human coronavirus OC43

79

virus (HCoV-OC43) is a betacoronavirus described for the first time in the 1960s. This

80

pathogen is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract disease in humans (10).

81

Interestingly, closely related species are found in cattle (bovine coronavirus) and dogs

82

(canine respiratory coronavirus). While the exact transfer route between different species

83

remains unknown, it is conceivable that as in SARS-CoV-2, the virus has jumped between

84

humans, and companion and farmed animals in the past (11).

85

Recently, we and others have detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks in Northern

86

Poland (12,13). The first report identified SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected from mink in

87

mid-November 2020. While the prevalence of the virus was low and, most likely, only

88

isolated cases were present, we have sequenced the isolates and have shown that the positive

89

signal did not originate from contamination. The most recent data collected and deposited by

90

the laboratory of the National Veterinary Research Institute in Poland has indicated isolation

91

of the SARS-CoV-2 variants from animals at the same farm. Phylogenetic analysis of the

92

data have indicated that the virus belongs to the B.1.1.279 lineage (Pangolin classification),

93

which is not surprising considering the prevalence of this variant in Europe. Genome analysis

94

shows that the new isolates carry the combination of mutations typical of viruses isolated

95

already in November 2020 from mink (listed in Figure 1 bottom left radial tree), but

96

additional new changes have accumulated since then. These include the Y453F mutation,

97

which was previously reported to have emerged in minks during serial passages (e.g., in

98

Denmark and recently Lithuania), and a novel mutation not present in any global SARS-

99

CoV-2 isolate that truncate ORF 7b at position L22. With all the available data taken into

100

account, we speculate that the virus was present already in the mink population by November

101

2020, presumably after a single introduction during the late summer or autumn of that year.

109

In the current study, we have identified a case of infection with a mink-adapted variant in

110

humans. Following the identification of SARS-CoV-2 cases in farmed animals, the exposed

111

staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (nasopharyngeal swabs) using RT-qPCR. A single positive

112

case was detected in a sample collected on 1st February 2021 and was sequenced using the

113

ARTIC Nanopore technology protocol. The resulting sequence has been deposited in

114

GISAID under the accession number EPI_ISL_1034274. The host was asymptomatic.

115

Phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1) shows that the virus clusters closely with viruses isolated

116

from mink (group B on bottom radial trees). Further, mutations characteristic of the mink-

117

adapted variant were present in the virus's genomic sequence (Table 1), confirming that it

118

was most likely contracted by the infected subject from animals.

123

during three months of passage at the mink farm.

The emerging variant clearly reflects adaptation of the virus to the animal host, with some

127

point mutations fixed early during transmission between animals and additional changes

128

accumulating over time (Figure 1, bottom right). While the mutations' exact role is to be

129

determined, they may provide increased fitness in the new host (14). It remains unknown

130

whether these features alter the course of disease transmissibility, or immunogenicity in

131

humans (15). However, the variant should be tracked in the general population. Our results

132

confirm the need for country-scale epizootiological monitoring and careful analysis of SARS-

133

CoV-2 positive patients.
