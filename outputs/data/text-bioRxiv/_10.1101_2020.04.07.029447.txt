ABSTRACT. Coronaviruses may produce severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As a matter
of fact, a new SARS-type virus, SARS-CoV-2, is responsible of a global pandemic in 2020 with
unprecedented sanitary and economic consequences for most countries. In the present contribution
we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the
interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved
in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. Our
results evidence two stable binding modes involving an interaction site spanning either the protein
dimer interface or only one monomer. The free energy profile unequivocally points to the dimer
mode as the thermodynamically favored one. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the
protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting SARS viruses to
bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step of the possible rational
design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique
Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.

Coronaviruses inducing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) gained first worldwide
attention in 2003 following the outbreak of SARS disease that mainly affected different southeastern Asian countries.1–3 By the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, a novel coronavirus,
styled SARS-CoV-2, has emerged and caused the Covid-19 pandemic.4–7 At the time of writing
this communication, Covid-19 has spread in all continents, excluding Antarctica. In April, the 5th
2020 a number of more than 1 million confirmed cases has been reported, as well as more than
66,000 deaths.8 Furthermore, severe limitations and social distancing measures have been
implemented by an increasing number of countries, in the attempt to limit the spreading of the
pandemic.9 Indeed, coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2 in particular, are characterized by high
infectious and transmissibility rates, and may, in certain cases, severely attack the lungs and the
respiratory system, an occurrence which can lead to the necessity of respiratory assistance and
even to death, especially in presence of others comorbidities.10–12
Since the first outbreak of the pandemic, important scientific works appeared, aiming at
understanding at a molecular level the mechanisms of action of SARS-CoV-2, and corona viruses
in general, that may be related to its transmissibility and mortality. Important successes have
notably been achieved in both genome sequencing and structural resolution of the different viral
proteins, also with the assistance of molecular modeling and simulation.13–21 In fact, the possibility
of finding efficient therapeutic strategies requires the elucidation of the fine mechanism that
mediate the virus attack to the host cell, the resistance to the host immune system, and finally its
virulence.22–25
Among the multifaced protein envelope of coronaviruses the so-called non-structural protein 3
(Nsp3) represents a large protein, localized in the cytoplasm, consisting of about 2,000 amino acids
and comprising several different domains, also including a transmembrane region. Among the

different domains of Nsp3,26,27 whose precise function of some of them has not been entirely
clarified yet, the so-called SARS Unique Domain (SUD) deserves a special attention, since it is
present only in SARS-type coronaviruses and hence it has been associated to the increased
pathogenicity of this viral family.

Figure 1) Schematic representation of the mRNA function in a) a healthy cell and b) an infected
cell by coronavirus. Panel b) showcases the influence of viral SUD binding to G4 sequences of
mRNA that encodes crucial proteins for the apoptosis/cell survival regulation and other signaling
paths.
The structure of SUD (presumably a common domain of different SARS viruses) has been
resolved experimentally,28–30 and it has been proved that the macrodomain is indeed constituted by
a dimer of two symmetric monomers. Furthermore, both experimental and molecular docking
investigations have pointed out a possible favorable interaction of SUD with nucleic acids, and in
particular with RNA in G-quadruplex (G4) conformation.28 The presence of a high density of
lysine residues at the interface between two SUD monomers, forming a positively charged pocket,

also suggests that RNA may be instrumental in favoring SUD dimerization, due to the negative
charge of the RNA backbone hence suggesting the occurrence of electrostatic attraction. This
observation may have a highly important biological implication since the dimerization has also
been connected to the SUD native function. Tan et al28 have proposed that the ability of SUD to
recognize and bind specific viral and/or host G4 sequences may have implications in regulating
viral replication and/or hampering the host response to viral infection, as schematized in Figure 1.
The hypothesis is based on the identification of G4 sequences in key host mRNA that encode
proteins involved in different signaling pathways such as apoptoting or survival signaling.31–38
These proteins could induce a controlled cellular death of infected cells slowing down or stopping
the infection, or promote cell survival to delay apoptosis by producing antiviral cytokines.37
However, the removal of the mRNA necessary to produce these signaling factors by viral SUD
may impair the apoptosis/survival response pathways allowing massive cell infection.28,37
In this letter, we report an extended all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) study of the interactions
produced between a dimeric SUD domain and a short RNA G4 sequence. The crystal structure of
the protein (pdb 2W2G) and of the oligonucleotide (pdb 1J8G)39 have been chosen coherently with
the experimental work performed by Tan et al.28 Even though the chosen SUD starting structure
belongs to the 2009 SARS-CoV, the very high nucleotide affinity40 and the global conservation of
the Nsp protein suggest that the RNA binding spots should be globally preserved. This is also
further justified by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp has also been recognized to suppress host gene
expression and hence inhibit the immune response.41 Equilibrium MD has allowed to assess some
of the hypothesized complexation modes between G4 and SUD, while also highlighting the most
important interactions patterns at an atomistic level, and the effects of G4 in maintaining the dimer
stability. Furthermore, to better sample the multidimensional conformational space and to quantify

the strength of the interactions coming into play, the free-energy surface has been explored using
enhanced sampling methods. A two-dimensional (2D) free energy profile has been computed along
two coordinates defining the distance between the centers of mass of G4 and one SUD domain
(G4-SUDA), and the two SUD domains (SUDA-SUDB), respectively. The corresponding 2D
potential of mean force (PMF) was obtained using a recently developed combination of extended
adaptative biased force (eABF)42 and metadynamics,43 hereafter named meta-eABF.44,45 Both
protein and RNA have been described with the amber force field46 including the bsc1
corrections,47,48 and the MD simulations have been performed in the constant pressure and
temperature ensemble (NPT) at 300K and 1 atm. All MD simulations have been performed using
the NAMD code49 and analyzed via VMD,50 the G4 structure has also been analyzed with the
3DNA suite.51,52 More details on the simulation protocol can be found in Supplementary
Information (SI). To obtain starting conformations, the RNA was manually positioned in two
different orientations close to the experimentally suggested SUD interaction area.28

The

equilibrium MD evolved yielding two distinct interaction modes, as reported in Figure 2. In
particular, we can easily distinguish between a first mode of binding in which the G4 mainly
interacts with only one SUD monomer, called monomeric binding mode, and a second one in
which the nucleic acid is firmly placed at the interface between the two protein monomeric
subunits, referred as dimeric binding mode. Note that while for the monomeric mode we easily
found a suitable starting point, two independent 200 ns MD trajectory were run to characterize the
dimeric mode.

calculated aligning the system to the RNA or the protein, respectively.
The corresponding root mean square deviations (RMSD) with respect to the initial structure are
also reported and globally show that both the RNA and the protein units are stable. As expected, a
slightly larger value of the RMSD is observed for the protein, as a consequence of its larger
flexibility compared to the rigid G4 structures (Figure 2 d, c). Note also that the slight initial
increase of the protein RMSD observed for the dimeric mode is due to the necessity of a slight
structural rearrangement to accommodate the G4 in the interaction pocket. Both modes are
globally stable all along the MD trajectory, and no spontaneous release of the G4 is observed. At

the end of the MD trajectory the dimeric mode exhibits a slight slipping toward the center of the
interface area. This is probably due to the relative short length of the oligomer, also in agreement
with previous experimental observations.28

Interestingly, the specific interaction patterns between G4 and the protein are different between
the two binding modes, providing an extremely important different behavior. Indeed, the main
driving force for the dimeric-like binding mode is the presence of extended electrostatic
interactions between the negatively charged RNA backbone and the highly positive interaction
pockets of the SUD complex. As a matter of fact, eleven Lys residues in the interaction pocket

phosphates. This finding is evidenced by the radial distribution function (RDF) between these
positively charged lysine side chains and the negatively charged phosphate oxygen atoms of G4
(depicted in dark blue in Figure 3b), which shows a very intense and sharp peak at around 2 Å
(Figure 3a). Interestingly, a secondary peak in the RDF is also observed at 3.5 Å, probably defining
a second layer of interaction patterns that should contribute to the overall stabilization of the
binding. Conversely, the monomeric mode is driven by interactions mainly involving the terminal
uracil moieties and the top guanine leaflet instead of the phosphate backbone of G4. As shown in
Figure 3b, hydrophobic interactions emerge through the action of a triad of amino acids, namely
Ser236, Leu237, and Asn238, that position themselves on top of the terminal leaflet also
interacting with the peripheral uracil nucleobases, in a mode strongly resembling the top-binding
experienced by a number of G4 drugs.53–55 This is nicely confirmed by the analysis of the time
series of the distance between the a-carbon of these amino acids and the nearby guanine that
readily drops at around 5 Å and stays remarkably stable all along the MD. Interestingly, the
interaction is sufficiently strong to induce a partial deformation of the planarity of the G4 leaflets.
Even though from considerations based on chemical intuition those interactions could be referred
as mainly due to dispersion, the inherent parameterization of the amber force field does not allow
to completely disentangle and decompose the polarization, dispersion and electrostatic
contributions. The fact that the monomeric binding mode is driven by non-covalent interactions
with one of the exposed G4 leaflets may also contribute explaining the fact that longer G4
sequences are preferentially recognized by the SUD interface region. Indeed, in this case, for
obvious statistic reasons, the ratio between the interaction with the backbone or with the terminal
leaflet clearly favors the former. On the other hand, this mode may also act efficiently in the

9

process of recruitment of RNA, either viral or cellular, efficiently anchoring the oligomer that can
subsequently be safely displaced through the interface area.
Apart from the different positioning of the G4, other structural evidences can already be
surmised from the visual inspection of the MD trajectory. In particular, the SUD dimers appear
more compact and the interface region better conserved when the RNA G4 adopts the dimeric
binding mode, as can also been appreciated in Figure 4. These results clearly indicate that the
dimeric mode leads to a greater stability of the G4-SUD complex.

tweezer in the SUD subdomains interface region, representative snapshot showing this region for
the monomer (b) and the dimer (c) conformation. The dashed orange line indicates the position of
the protein residues corresponding to the distance measured.
Indeed, the presence of G4 in the dimeric binding mode induces rigidity in the SUD subunits
interface due to the formation of the dimer. This effect can be quantified by analyzing the

10

distribution of the distance of a tweezer in the SUD interface area formed by the residues Ala355
and Arg266, as reported in Figure 4. Indeed, while in the case of the dimeric-like conformation a
peaked distribution centered at relative close distances (6.7 Å) is observed, indicating a closed and
quite rigid disposition, a much broader and bimodal distribution is found for the monomer-like
conformation, presenting, most notably, a secondary maximum at about 11 Å, which confirms the
partial destabilization of the SUD subdomains interface and the greater flexibility induced by this
binding mode.
To further examine the conformational space spanned by the G4/SUD complex, and in particular
the role of the RNA in favoring the dimerization and the structure of the interface, we resorted to
enhanced sampling MD simulations to obtain the 2D free energy profile along two relevant
collective variables: first, the distance between G4 and SUD, and second, the separation between
the two SUD subdomains. Our choice of collective variables does not allow to explore the binding
between the two surfaces of the SUD domain, however from the results of Tan et al.28 it is clear
that the interaction with RNA takes place preferentially at the positively charged interface. On the
other hand, our methodology is perfectly adapted to characterize the influence of the binding of
RNA to the stabilization of the interface between the two SUD monomers since it allows the sliding
of the G4 on the SUD surface. The PMF is reported in Figure 5 together with representative
snapshots along the reaction coordinates. From the analysis of the PMF, one can evidence the
presence of an evident minimum in the free energy profile corresponding to the situation in which
the G4 is interacting through the dimer mode, in which the SUD dimer is compact (Figure 5b).
The free-energy stabilization, with respect to the situation in which the G4 is well separated from
the protein, amounts to about 6 kcal/mol. Around the principal minimum a slightly less stable and
extended region is also observed having a stabilization free energy of about 3-4 kcal/mol and

11

corresponding to the sliding of G4 in the monomer conformation (Figure 5c). The rest of the free
energy surface appears instead rather flat, and no appreciable barriers are observed along the
collective variable. The topology of the free energy surface hence accounts for the possibility to
observe important conformational movements, leading to open conformations in which the SUD
subdomain interface has been basically destroyed (Figure 5d). However, such conformations are
instead hampered by the dimer-like conformation of the RNA. The free energy map
unambiguously shows that the dimer mode is the preferred one, and also confirms the role of the
G4 binding in maintaining the dimeric SUD conformation, since no appreciable free energy barrier
for the opening of the SUD dimer is observed when the RNA is unbound. Thus, the dimer mode
binding site clearly constitutes a specific target that may help in the development of new efficient
antiviral agents against coronaviruses.

By using a combination of equilibrium and enhanced sampling MD, we have identified the
structure and dynamics of the viral SUD dimers and their interaction with RNA oligomers forming
guanine quadruplexes. Even if the accuracy of the obtained results is obviously dependent on the
choice of the specific force field and of the specific collective variables, we believe we have been
able to offer a significant sampling of the binding between SUD and RNA G4, and of its effects
on the stabilization of the SUD complex and the monomer-monomer interface. In particular, we
have clearly evidenced the existence of two different interaction modes, one happening at the
subdomains interface (dimeric binding mode) and another involving only one of the SUD
monomers. While the former mode is mostly driven by electrostatic interactions and appears to be
more stable and is essential in rigidifying the protein dimer and stabilizing the SUD-G4 interface,
the latter assures a great flexibility to the protein and is guided by non-covalent interactions. Such
stable interaction between SUD and G4-RNA can be related to the translational default of the
concerned proteins (see Figure 1). Furthermore, the monomer interaction mode, happening in a
more solvent exposed region of the protein, can also play a role in recruiting RNA fragments in
the first step of the SUD-G4 recognition.
SUD dimer is thought to have an important biological role in allowing coronaviruses to bypass
host cell protective and immune systems, hence allowing the virus morbidity and transmissibility.
Indeed, and even if in the present work we used a protein belonging to SARS-CoV, we believe
that the mechanism underlined is quite general and may represent one of the reasons of the high
pathogenicity of SARS agents. As a matter of fact, the role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp in suppressing
host gene expression as also been recently evidenced.41 The destabilization of the SUD/RNA
complex, that could be achieved for instance by specific G4 ligands, or by competitors for the two
G4 recognition spots evidenced in SUD, may constitute appealing potential therapeutic strategies.

14

This is particularly true since these protein domains are shared by the family of SARS-type viruses
and thus represent a molecular target that could stay operative in case of future mutations leading
to new viral strains. As a continuation of the present work, we plan to address the study of the
interaction between specific ligands and RNA G4 oligomers, also taking into account the
perturbation induced on the recognition by SUD.
