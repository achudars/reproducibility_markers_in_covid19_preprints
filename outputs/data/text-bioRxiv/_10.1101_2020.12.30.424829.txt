Abstract (150-200 words)

24

A SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 (RBD219-N1C1) recombinant protein antigen formulated on

25

Alhydrogel® has recently been shown to elicit a robust neutralizing antibody response against

26

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in mice. The antigen has been produced under current good

27

manufacturing practices (cGMP) and is now in clinical testing. Here, we report on process

28

development and scale-up optimization for upstream fermentation and downstream purification

29

of the antigen. This includes production at the 1 and 5 L scale in the yeast, Pichia pastoris, and

30

the comparison of three different chromatographic purification methods. This culminated in the

31

selection of a process to produce RBD219-N1C1 with a yield of >400 mg per liter of

32

fermentation with >92% purity and >39% target product recovery after purification. In addition,

33

we show the results from analytical studies, including SEC-HPLC, DLS, and an ACE2 receptor

34

binding assay that were performed to characterize the purified proteins to select the best

35

purification process. Finally, we propose an optimized upstream fermentation and downstream

36

purification process that generates quality RBD219-N1C1 protein antigen and is fully scalable

37

at a low cost.

Introduction

40

After the first report of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 [21,24], the

41

number of cases is now at 75 million with over 1.6 million deaths worldwide [16]. As of

42

December 2020, two vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have been approved for

43

emergency use in multiple countries. These frontrunner vaccines represent a new platform,

44

mRNA-based vaccines; while they were produced in record time, they are relatively expensive

45

to manufacture and require transportation and storage at temperatures below -20°C. Such

46

features present formidable challenges to distribute these vaccines to low- and middle-income

47

countries (LMICs). Confounding equity access for COVID-19 vaccines are the still uncertain

48

production and distribution delays or even the quality of other vaccines. This situation could

49

leave LMICs bereft of low-cost COVID-19 vaccines suitable for their modest or depleted

50

health systems [20]. In response, a network of LMIC vaccine developers and manufacturers

51

are accelerating vaccines employing traditional platforms, such as an inactivated virus and

52

recombinant proteins, with several under preclinical and clinical development [9]. These

53

vaccine candidates are less demanding with respect to transport and storage, and often come

54

with a long history of successful production and use for other infectious diseases [15].

55

Particularly attractive in this aspect are recombinant protein antigens produced through

56

microbial fermentation in yeast. For instance, recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine has been

57

administered to adults and children for decades [13].

58

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, uses its surface spike (S)

59

protein for host cell entry, just like its close relative, SARS-CoV that had caused an outbreak

60

of Severe Acute Respiratory Disease in 2002. The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S

61

protein binds to a cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that mediates

62

membrane fusion during viral entry into the cell [22,28]. S proteins for both viruses have served

63

as vaccine antigens that could elicit antibodies to prevent virus entry by blocking the binding

64

of RBD to ACE2 [14], and all the leading COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials,

65

including the mRNA vaccines, use the S protein to elicit immunity [12]. Overwhelmingly, such

66

vaccines protect through their induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies, together with T cell

67

responses [17].

68

Building on our experience with the RBD of the SARS-CoV spike protein [5,7,4], the

69

SARS-CoV-2 RBD was cloned and expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris [8]. Yeast has a track

70

record of serving as a host organism for the production of multiple regulatory-approved and

71

prequalified recombinant subunit vaccines, including vaccines for Hepatitis B, Influenza B,

72

human papillomavirus, as well as for Diphtheria and Tetanus [1,19]. Eukaryotic expression in

73

yeast shows advantages over the prokaryote, Escherichia coli, with respect to the production

74

of recombinant protein vaccines. Proper protein folding, disulfide bridge formation, post-

75

translational modifications, and secretory cleavage are better supported in yeast, while also

76

allowing for robust production with low costs and full scalability, features that distinguish this

77

platform from other eukaryotic systems, such as insect cells, mammalian cells, and plants.

78

The RBD219-N1C1 antigen is derived from residues 332-549 of the SARS-CoV-2

79

RBD with a single mutation of a free cysteine residue (Cys538) to alanine to prevent

80

intermolecular disulfide bond formation and therefore unwanted oligomerization during

81

process development [8]. In addition, N1 refers to the deletion of Asn331 to avoid

82

hyperglycosylation observed in previous studies with the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 antigen [5].

83

In initial studies, the RBD219-N1C1 recombinant protein antigen adjuvanted with Alhydrogel®

84

has been shown to elicit a robust neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2

85

pseudovirus in mice [25].

86

With any COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the ability to produce billions of doses

87

efficiently is crucial to satisfy the potential global vaccine demand. We, therefore, have been

88

developing and optimizing a scalable production process of the RBD219-N1C1 vaccine

89

candidate at low cost to support its technology transfer. Initial fermentation runs scouting for

90

growth media, induction time, and glycerol fed-batch conditions were executed in a 1 L

91

bioreactor and resulted in a ~10-fold increase in RBD219-N1C1 expression levels. Further

92

scale-up experiments in a 5 L bioreactor established reproducibility of the selected conditions.

93

Simultaneously, a purification scheme was developed based on the process used for the 70%

94

homologous SARS-CoV RBD antigen [4], and further optimized to allow full scalability and

95

lower the cost. Taking into consideration, yield, purity, functionality, and removal of host cell

96

contaminants, we have developed an optimized fermentation at the 5 L scale and purification

97

(Process-2) suitable for production and manufacturing of a high-yield (and therefore

98

potentially low-cost) COVID-19 vaccine antigen candidate. The developed process has already

99

been transferred to an industrial vaccine manufacturer in India and is currently undergoing

100

further production maturity while the vaccine candidate is in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.

Materials and Methods

103

Generation of Research Cell Bank

104

To generate a research cell bank (RCB), P. pastoris X33 strain was transformed with

105

expression plasmid pPICZαA containing RBD219-N1C1 coding DNA, and one transformed

106

colony with high expression of recombinant RBD219-N1C1 protein [8] was selected and

107

streaked on YPD plates containing 100 μg/mL Zeocin to make single colonies. The plates were

108

incubated at 30 °C for approximately 3 days until single colonies were observed. Subsequently,

109

200 mL plant-derived phytone YPD medium was inoculated with a single colony from the

110

respective plate and incubated at 30 °C with constant shaking (225 RPM) until the OD600

111

reached 9.3. Finally, the cell culture was mixed with plant-derived glycerol to a final

112

concentration of 20% and aseptically aliquoted (1 mL each) into 1.2 mL cryovials. For long-

113

term storage, the cryovials were stored at −80 °C.

114

Fermentation

115

One vial of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 RCB was used to inoculate 1 L BMG (Buffered

116

Minimal Glycerol) medium in a 2 L shake flask. The shake flask culture was grown at 30°C

117

and 225 rpm until an OD600 of 5 - 10. For 1 L fermentations, this seed culture was inoculated

118

into 0.4 L of sterile basal-salt medium (BSM), pH 5.0 (BSM: 18.2 g/L potassium sulfate, 14.9

119

g/L magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 4.13 g/L potassium hydroxide, 0.93 g/L calcium sulfate

120

dehydrate, 26.7 mL/L of 85% phosphoric acid, and 40 g/L glycerol) or low-salt medium

121

(LSM), pH 5.0 (LSM: 4.55 g/L potassium sulfate, 3.73 g/L magnesium sulfate heptahydrate,

122

1.03 g/L potassium hydroxide, 0.23 g/L calcium sulfate dehydrate, 10.9 mL/L of 85%

123

phosphoric, and 40 g/L glycerol) to a starting cell density (OD600) of 0.5. Fermentation was

124

conducted using a Biostat Qplus Bioreactor with a 1 L vessel (Sartorius Stedim, Guxhagen,

125

Germany). For 5 L runs, the seed culture was inoculated into 2.5 L of LSM, and fermentation

126

was conducted in a CelliGen 310 Bioreactor with a 7.5 L vessel (Eppendorf, New York, USA),

127

controlled by the Eppendorf Bio Command software. Cell expansion was continued at 30 °C

128

with a dissolved oxygen (DO) set point of 30%. Following the DO spike, a fed-batch was

129

initiated with 50% glycerol at a feed rate of 15 mL/L/hr for 6 hours. During the last hour of the

130

fed-batch phase, pH and temperature were increased to the desired value (pH=6.5,

131

temperature=25°C). When a glycerol fed-batch was not included in the fermentation process,

132

the pH and temperature were adjusted to the desired value during the first hour of induction.

133

After the fed-batch phase, methanol induction was initiated; the total induction time was

134

approximately 68-72 hours. Biomass was removed by centrifugation at 12,227 x g for 30

135

minutes at 4 °C before the supernatant was filtered through 0.45 µm PES filters stored at -80

136

°C until purification.

Purification overview of three processes

138

The FS was removed from -80 °C and thawed at 22 °C for 4-6 hours. Three purification

139

processes were performed with 1 L FS aliquots (Figure 1B). In Process-1, the RBD219-N1C1

140

protein was captured from the FS using hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC),

141

concentrated by ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UFDF), and polished using size exclusion

142

chromatography (SEC). In Process-2, the RBD219-N1C1 protein was captured using HIC,

143

buffer-exchanged (UFDF), and polished using anion exchange chromatography (AEX).

144

Finally, in Process-3, the FS was buffer-exchanged using UFDF before the target protein was

145

captured using cation exchange chromatography (CEX), buffer-exchanged (UFDF), and

146

polished using AEX.

147

UFDF (Ultrafiltration and Diafiltration)

148

Two types of devices were used for UFDF, a centrifugal concentrator, and a flat sheet

149

membrane, depending on the target volume. For Process-1, Amicon centrifugal concentrator,

150

with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, USA) was used

151

to concentrate the HIC elution pool (2,050 x g at 4°C). This allowed concentration to the small

152

volume needed for SEC. For Process-2, a flat sheet Pellicon XL Cassette with a Biomax-5

153

membrane (5 kDa MWCO) and a LabScale TFF System (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, USA)

154

were used to concentrate the HIC elution pool 8-fold, followed by diafiltration with 4

155

diavolumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 100 mM NaCl. A crossflow was kept at 25 mL/min

156

over a 0.005 m2 membrane area throughout the entire process with an average transmembrane

157

pressure (TMP) of ~15 psi. For Process-3, a flat sheet Pellicon 2 Mini Cassette with a Biomax-

158

5 membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, USA) was used for the first UFDF (UFDF-1) to

159

concentrate the FS 4-fold followed by diafiltration with 4 diavolumes of 20 mM sodium citrate

160

pH 4.2 and 10 mM NaCl. A crossflow was kept constant at 200 mL/min over a 0.1 m2

161

membrane area throughout the entire process with an average TMP of ~8 psi. For the UFDF-

162

2, the CEX elution pool was concentrated 4-fold followed by diafiltration with 4 diavolumes

163

of 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 and 5 mM NaCl using the Pellicon XL Cassette as described for

164

Process-2.

165

Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)

166

In Processes 1 and 2, HIC was used to capture RBD219-N1C1 proteins from the FS.

167

Ammonium sulfate salt was added to the FS to a final concentration of 1 M (w/v) and the pH

168

was adjusted to 8.0. The FS was filtered through a 0.45 µm PES filter unit and loaded on a 112

169

mL Butyl Sepharose High-Performance column (4.4 cm diameter and 7.4 cm bed height) at 20

170

mL/min flow rate. The column was washed with 1 M ammonium sulfate in 30 mM Tris-HCl

171

pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.4 M ammonium sulfate in 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0.

172

Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)

173

Five mL of the concentrated HIC elution pool was loaded on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75

174

prep-grade column (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA), pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH

175

7.5 and 150 mM NaCl, and eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The SEC elution pool was

176

aseptically filtered using 0.2 µm PES in a biosafety cabinet and stored at -80 °C until usage.

177

Ion exchange chromatography (IEX)

178

In Process-3, RBD219-N1C1 was captured using CEX. The Pellicon 2 retentate pool in 20 mM

179

sodium citrate pH 4.2 and 10 mM NaCl was loaded on a 50 mL CM Sepharose Fast Flow

180

column (2.6 cm diameter and 9.3 cm bed height) at 10 mL/min flow rate. The column was

181

washed with 20 mM sodium citrate pH 4.2 and 10 mM NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted in

182

20 mM sodium citrate pH 6.6 and 10 mM NaCl.

183

In Processes 2 and 3, RBD219-N1C1 was polished using a negative capture AEX. The

184

Pellicon XL retentate pool was loaded on a HiPrep Q Sepharose XL 16/10 column (Cytiva,

185

Marlborough, USA) that was pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 100 mM NaCl

186

for Process-2, and 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 and 5 mM NaCl for Process-3. The flowthrough

187

from AEX was collected, aseptically filtered using 0.2 µm PES filters in a biosafety cabinet,

188

and stored at -80 °C until usage. NaCl (95 mM) was added to the final purified proteins from

189

Process-3 prior to storage in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 and 100 mM NaCl.

190

Protein yield and purity determination by quantitative SDS-PAGE

191

In-process samples taken at each purification step were loaded on either 14% Tris-glycine gels

192

or 4-12% Bis-Tris gels to determine the concentration and purity of the various RBD219-N1C1

193

samples. Purified RBD219-N1C1 proteins of known concentrations were used as standards.

194

After SDS-PAGE, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned with a GS-900

195

densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Gel images were processed with ImageLab software

196

(Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) to create a standard curve and determine protein concentration and

197

purity.

198

Western Blot

199

Western Blot analysis was performed to detect RBD219-N1C1 as well as P. pastoris host cell

200

protein (HCP). Five micrograms of purified protein were run on 14% Tris-Glycine gels under

201

non-reducing and reducing conditions to detect RBD219-N1C1 and HCP, respectively.

202

Proteins in gel were transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked with 5% dry milk in PBST

203

(1X PBS with 0.05% Tween-20). RBD219-N1C1 was detected using a rabbit monoclonal

204

antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein (Sino Biological, Beijing, China; Cat#:

205

40150-R007) and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish

206

peroxidase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA; Cat#: G21234). HCPs were detected using an anti-P.

207

pastoris:HRP conjugate (2G) solution (Cygnus, Southport, USA; Cat# F641-12). The blots

208

were developed using ECL Prime Substrate System (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA).

209

Size Exclusion Chromatography-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SEC-

210

HPLC)

211

Waters® Alliance HPLC Separations Modules and Associated PDA Detectors were operated

212

to analyze the size and purity of purified RBD219-N1C1 proteins. Fifty µg micrograms of the

213

RBD219-N1C1 protein were injected into a Yarra SEC-3000 column (300 mm X 7.8 mm;

214

catalog # 00H-4513-K0), and was eluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl, at the

215

flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The elution of protein was confirmed by detecting the absorbance at

216

280 nm.

217

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)

218

The size of the purified RBD219-N1C1 proteins was also analyzed by DLS [4,6]. In short,

219

RBD219-N1C1 was first diluted to 1 mg/mL with TBS, and approximately 40 µL of protein

220

were then loaded into a clear bottom 384-well plate in four replicates to evaluate the

221

hydrodynamic radius and molecular weight using the cumulant fitting on a Wyatt Technology

222

DynaPro Plate Reader II.

223

Host Cell Protein Quantification by ELISA

224

Yeast-expressed RBD219-N1C1 is N-glycosylated [8]. To avoid any cross-reactivity from

225

anti-P. pastoris HCP antibodies that recognize the N-glycans, which could result in an over-

226

estimation of true HCP, we performed quantitative ELISAs with a second-generation anti-

227

Pichia pastoris HCP ELISA Kit (Cygnus, Southport, USA; Cat# F640) following the

228

manufacturer’s instructions. This kit provides strips pre-coated with anti-P. pastoris HCP

229

antibodies. Serially-diluted RBD219-N1C1 was loaded onto the strips (HCP standards range

230

from 0-250 ng/mL) in the presence of HRP conjugated anti-P. pastoris antibodies. The strips

231

were then incubated for approximately 3 hours at room temperature followed by 4 washes.

232

Finally, 100 µL of TMB solution were added to react with the HRP conjugated antibodies that

233

were presented in the strip for 30 minutes prior to the addition of 100 µL of 1 M HCl to stop

234

the reaction. The absorbance of 450 nm was measured in each well of the strip and a linear

235

standard curve was generated by plotting an “absorbance vs concentration” graph with the HCP

236

standards to further calculate the HCP concentration present in the RBD219-N1C1 proteins.

237

Endotoxin test

238

Endotoxin levels in the purified RBD219-N1C1 samples were measured using the Endosafe

239

Portable Testing System (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, USA). The purified protein

240

was diluted 10-fold with Endosafe LAL reagent water and 25 µL of diluted protein was loaded

241

to each of the four wells of PTS20 Limulus amebocyte lysate Reagent Cartridge for the

242

measurement as described in the literature (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, USA) [18].

243

In vitro ACE2 binding ELISA

244

The binding of RBD219-N1C1 to recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

245

(ACE2) was evaluated using an ELISA procedure described previously [8]. In short, 96-well

246

ELISA plates were coated with 100 µL 2 µg/mL RBD219-N1C1 overnight at 4°C followed by

247

blocking with PBST/0.1% BSA. 100 µL serially-diluted ACE2-hFc (LakePharma, San Carlos,

248

USA; Cat # 46672) was added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and

249

the binding was detected by adding 100 µL 1:10,000 diluted HRP conjugated anti-human IgG

250

antibodies (GenScript, Piscataway, USA; Cat# A00166) with a 1-hour incubation period at

251

room temperature. Finally, 100 µL TMB substrate was provided to each well to react with HRP

252

and the reaction was terminated with 100 µL 1M HCl. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured

253

using an EPOCH 2 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, USA).

Fermentation optimization

257

When basal-salt medium (BSM) and low-salt medium (LSM) were compared for the

258

production of the RBD219-N1C1 protein, no differences were observed in the growth profiles

259

and the final biomass. However, the salt concentration appeared to have a significant effect on

260

the yield. The yield of the RBD219-N1C1 protein using BSM was only 52 mg/L while using

261

LSM 237 mg/L were achieved (Table 1, Runs 1 and 2). Therefore, LSM was used for the

262

further development of the fermentation process.

263

The baseline fermentation process consisted of two phases: a glycerol-batch phase and

264

a methanol fed-batch phase. In glycerol-batch mode, LSM contained 40 g/L of glycerol. At the

265

time of glycerol depletion, the initial induction biomass was 110 ± 10 g/L (WCW). In this

266

study, a glycerol fed-batch phase was then added before methanol induction to test the

267

efficiency of protein expression based on the initial induction biomass. After a 6-hour glycerol

268

fed-batch phase, the initial induction biomass doubled to 210 ± 20 g/L (WCW). The methanol

269

feed strategies were kept the same. At harvest, the final OD600 and the biomass were determined

270

to be 260 AU and 417 g/L, respectively. By adding the glycerol fed-batch, the yield of

271

RBD219-N1C1 was increased about 120% to 533 mg/L (Table 1, Run 3).

272

Fermentation scalability and reproducibility

273

The fermentation process with six hours of glycerol feed was then scaled up from 1 L to 5 L to

274

test scalability and reproducibility (Table 1, Run 4). The induction time was extended to 87

275

hours until biomass started to drop. This suggested that the cells were no longer actively

276

dividing. Since excessive methanol feeding may lead to cell death thus leading to a loss of

277

protein yield, it was decided to stop the methanol feeding after 87 hours of induction. The peak

278

yield of RBD219-N1C1 was 449 ± 8 mg/L at 70 hours after induction (Day 3), after which the

279

yield slightly dropped to 408 ± 9 mg/L at 87 hours after induction.

280

The fermentation process without the 6-hour glycerol fed-batch phase was also scaled up from

281

1 to 5 L for comparison (Table 1, Run 5). After 70 ± 2 hours of induction, the yield of RBD219-

282

N1C1 reached 479 ± 15 mg/L (a 128% increase compared to the 1 L scale). This yield was

283

close to the yield of the fermentation run with the 6- hour glycerol fed-batch phase (Table 1,

284

Run 4). Since there was no significant increase in yield by the glycerol fed-batch at 5 L scale,

285

we decided to proceed without this step (Figure 1A). To establish reproducibility, this

286

fermentation process (Figure 1A) was repeated four times (Runs 5-8). The average yield of

287

four reproducibility runs was 428 ± 36 mg/L, with a coefficient of variance of 8.3%. The SDA-

288

PAGE gels analysis of fermentation supernatants of a representative run (Run 5) with the

289

lockdown process was shown in Figure 2. RBD219-N1C1 (a dominant protein band of ~28

290

kDa) was secreted and accumulated in the fermentation supernatant through the course of

291

methanol induction.

292

Three purification schemes

293

In parallel with the fermentation optimization, three different processes were performed to

294

purify RBD219-N1C1 from the FS (Figure 1B). Process-1 was developed by adapting the

295

purification method of our SARS-CoV-RBD219-N1 antigen that shares 70% homology with

296

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD [8,4,27]. In this process, the target protein was captured by HIC using

297

a butyl HP column with 1 M ammonium sulfate salt for the binding. After the HIC, 67% of the

298

target protein was recovered and purity significantly improved from 85.6% in the FS to 97.6%

299

(Figure 3A). The target protein was concentrated using Amicon centrifugal concentrators and

300

further polished by SEC using a Superdex 75 column. The SEC elution pool was then diluted

13

301

to 2 mg/mL for storage. Overall, the final yield of the target protein using Process-1 was 188.8

302

mg/L FS (Figure 3A), representing a recovery of 50% with a purity of 98.3%. This is similar

303

to the overall recovery of 52% and the purity of 98.5% shown with the SARS-CoV-RBD219-

304

N1 protein [4].

305

Although Process-1 is sufficient and proven to produce proteins at high yield and purity

306

at the laboratory scale, up to 10 L [4], there are considerations to be made with respect to

307

scaling-up manufacture. Both HIC and SEC are costly steps due to their low binding and

308

process capacities, requiring large resin volumes and long processing times. Therefore, we

309

explored two alternative processes utilizing IEX, favored in the biopharmaceutical industry

310

due to its low cost and high scalability.

311

In Process-2, the capture step was unchanged. After the UFDF step to concentrate and

312

exchange buffer, the target protein was polished by a negative capture using AEX instead of

313

SEC (Figure 1B). While the RBD219-N1C1 did not bind to the Q XL column, non-specific

314

HCPs were bound to the column and removed effectively. The step recovery during AEX was

315

78%, which is lower than the 89% of the step recovery seen from SEC in Process-1. The final

316

purity of the purified protein from Process-2 was 95.1%, which is lower than the 98.3% purity

317

seen in Process-1 but still highly pure. However, the overall recovery in Process-2 was only

318

39%, much lower than the 50% for Process-1. This is due to the lower recovery during HIC,

319

45%, that lags the 67% recovery seen for the equivalent step in Process-1. This lower recovery

320

may offer the opportunity for improvement, but overall, it is fair to conclude that AEX can

321

successfully replace SEC for the polishing step.

322

In Process-3, we further optimized Process-2 to utilize CEX for the capture step instead

323

of HIC. After the first UFDF step (UFDF-1) to concentrate and buffer exchange the FS,

324

RBD219-N1C1 was captured using a CM FF column followed by a second UFDF step (UFDF-

325

2) and a polishing step using negative AEX capture (Figure 1B). The additional UFDF-1 step

326

required prior to CEX increased processing time compared to Processes 1 and 2. Although the

327

step recovery from CEX was 65%, very similar to the 67% seen after the HIC in Process-1, the

328

purity was only 83% after CEX which is significantly lower than the purity (97.6% and 95.2%

329

from Process-1 and -2, respectively) after HIC (Figure 3C). Purity was improved significantly

330

by 9.5% after the polishing step, resulting in an overall purity of 92.5%, which is lower than

331

the 98.3% and 95.1% seen in Processes 1 and 2, respectively.

332

To summarize, HIC showed a superior performance to remove non-specific host

333

proteins and, hence, resulted in >95% purity after the capture step, which is even higher purity

334

than 92.5% purity seen in the final protein product from Process-3. This favored HIC over CEX

335

although its only drawback is the cost. HIC has no limitation on scale-up. On the other hand,

336

both AEX and SEC showed very similar performance during the polishing step. However,

337

while AEX is cost-effective chromatography with full scalability, SEC is expensive and has

338

limitations in scale-up. This reasons us to favor Process-2 employing HIC and AXE for the

339

capture and the polishing step, respectively. Before we urge to conclude that Process-2 is the

340

best process to produce RBD219-N1C1, we characterized and compared the purified protein

341

from Process-2 and two other processes for integrity, size estimation, impurity contents, and

342

functionality.

343

Characterization and size estimation of the purified proteins from three processes

344

The purified proteins from all processes were characterized for integrity by Western blot, SEC-

345

HPLC, and DLS. When 5 µg of purified protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by

346

Coomassie Blue staining, a single band was seen at ~28 kDa under reducing and ~25 kDa under

347

non-reducing conditions (Figure 4A). Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody

348

against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein under a non-reducing SDS-PAGE indicating that the ~25

349

kDa band is indeed derived from the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Figure 4B). An additional

350

band at ~50 kDa was detected in the protein from Process-3, likely representing a dimer.

351

Dimerization through free cysteine residues had also been reported for SARS-CoV-RBD219-

352

N1, and therefore the free cysteine (C538) was mutated to alanine in RBD219-N1C1 [8].

353

Although RBD219-N1C1 theoretically lacks free cysteine residues, we observed some dimers

354

during the fermentation that were removed during purification. Therefore, Process-3 appears

355

to be less efficient at removing dimeric RBD219-N1C1 than the other processes.

356

SEC-HPLC with 50 µg of the purified protein preparations indicated that all three

357

proteins were similar in size and had no aggregation. Only the purified protein from Process-3

358

showed an additional peak eluting ~1 min earlier, likely, as reported above, a dimer (Figure

359

4C). Finally, all three proteins were analyzed by DLS to estimate size and dispersity in solution.

360

The estimated sizes of the purified proteins from each process were 29.75, 31.00, and 34.25

361

kDa, respectively (Figure 4D). As expected, the protein from Process-3 showed higher

362

polydispersity than the other samples (Supplementary Figure 1).

363

Impurity assessment in the purified proteins

364

P. pastoris HCP was assayed by Western blot and quantified by ELISA using a second-

365

generation P. pastoris HCP detection kit. When 5 µg unpurified proteins (i.e. FS), as well as

366

the purified proteins, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue stain and

367

Western blot, we saw that HCP had been effectively removed from all three processes (Figure

368

5A and B). The HCP content in the purified proteins was calculated as 95.9 ng, 6.8 ng, and

369

44.8 ng per mg of RBD219-N1C1 from Processes 1-3, respectively (Figure 5C). All these

370

values were within acceptable limits, 1-100 ng/mg, for biopharmaceuticals [2,30].

371

Endotoxin levels measured in the purified proteins were 1.74, 1.48, and 2.10 EU per

372

mg for the purified proteins from Processes 1-3, respectively (Figure 5D). These values are

373

significantly lower than the maximum recommended endotoxin level for recombinant subunit

374

vaccines, 20 EU/mL [3].

375

Functionality assessment using ACE2 binding assay

376

To evaluate the functionality of the purified proteins from each process, the ability to

377

bind to the human ACE2 receptor was tested in vitro. SARS-CoV-2 uses this human cell

378

surface receptor for cell entry [14], and here the binding of each protein to ACE2 was quantified

379

by ELISA. All proteins presented similar binding curves to ACE2, with calculated EC50-

380

values (for 2 µg/mL purified protein) of 0.037, 0.033, and 0.038 µg/mL ACE2, respectively

381

(Figure 6), suggesting that all three proteins were functionally equivalent.

382
383

Discussion

384

We developed a process suitable for producing a recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine

385

antigen for clinical testing and transition to industrial manufacture. Fermentations were initially

386

run at the 1 L (for fermentation conditions optimization) and then the 5 L scale (for downstream

387

purification process development). When scaled to 5 L and conditions had only been modified

388

for gas flow and agitation rate to maintain 30% dissolved oxygen, differences in the protein

389

yield were observed. Four subsequent identical 5 L fermentation runs showed high

390

reproducibility with a CV of 8.3%, further emphasizing robustness.

391

Based on our previous experience with SARS-CoV-RBD219-N1 (a prototype vaccine

392

for SARS), a 1.6- to 2.5-fold yield increase was achieved when switching from basal-salt to

393

low-salt medium during the glycerol batch phase in the fermentation process [5]. For SARS-

394

CoV2-RBD219-N1C1, a 3.6-fold increase in yield suggests that the salt concentration was a

395

significant factor. In basal-salt medium, the recombinant protein precipitates in the presence of

396

magnesium and calcium phosphates as the pH is adjusted above 5.5. Low-salt medium also

397

precipitates, though to a much lesser extent. The precipitate formation can have adverse effects

398

on the fermentation process as it can lead to an unbalanced nutrient supply, cause cell

399

disruption, and induce secreted proteins to form aggregates [29]. Similar findings had

400

previously been observed with the production of a therapeutic Fc-fusion protein in the

401

fermentation of P. pastoris. When salt supplements were added at induction, the protein yield

402

decreased [23].

403

Purification optimization produced RBD219-N1C1 at high purity and yield, with a high

404

recovery rate, suitable for scalability for manufacturing. Three purification methods (Processes

405

1-3) were tested and compared using 1 L FS from the identical fermentation runs for rapid

406

development. Process-1 was adapted based on the previous purification method with SARS-

407

CoV-RBD219-N1 with slight modification on ammonium salt concentration in HIC. Process-

408

1 resulted in 98.3% purity with a 50% overall recovery rate, similar to the 98.5% purity and

409

52% overall recovery shown in SARS-CoV-RBD219-N1 purification (Figure 3A) [4]. Purity

410

was dramatically increased to >97% after the HIC capture step (Figure 3A). Process-1 is

411

suitable to produce the target protein at the laboratory scale but is limited in scale-up due to

412

low binding and process capacities, as well as the long processing time leading to high cost for

413

production. Therefore, two other processes were tested to replace costly HIC and SEC with

414

CEX and AEX, respectively. For biopharmaceuticals, IEX has been favored in chromatography

415

due to its robustness and full scalability [4].

416

While IEX was tested in the polishing step of Process-2, it was used for both capture

417

and polishing steps in Process-3. In Process-2, AEX showed comparable step recovery, and

418

purity increases to SEC in Process-1 (Figure 3A and B). However, a significant improvement

419

in purity by AEX was shown in Process-3 after the capture step by CEX (Figure 3C) as the

420

CEX elution pool showed only 83.0% purity. This suggests that AEX not only can successfully

421

replace SEC but also can effectively remove non-specific host proteins. On the contrary, CEX

422

showed comparable step recovery but a lower capability to remove host proteins during the

423

capture step. The purity after the CEX-capture was only 83.0%, which is significantly lower

424

than the purity after HIC-capture (97.6% and 95.2% seen in Processes 1 and 2, respectively)

425

(Figure 3). Overall, Process-3 produced the least pure RBD219-N1C1 protein among the three

426

processes tested.

427

Before choosing the best process for purification of RBD219-N1C1, the purified

428

proteins were characterized for their quality based on size, specificity, and impurity. The

429

integrity assessment of the purified proteins was performed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained

430

gels showed a single band at ~25 kDa that was recognized by a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-

431

specific antibody (Figure 4A and B). In addition, for Process-3, the western blot indicated the

432

presence of an additional band speculated to be a dimer (Figure 4B); this same product was

433

also seen by SEC-HPLC (Figure 4C). Although no difference in size was seen among the

434

purified proteins from the three processes by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4A), the size under native

435

conditions, estimated by DLS showed differences. The sizes in solution were 29.75, 31.00, and

436

34.25 kDa for the products from Processes 1-3, respectively. The purified protein from Process-

437

3 appeared larger estimated size suggesting the presence of additional molecules in the

438

preparation (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure 1). Next, impurities such as P. pastoris

439

HCPs and endotoxin levels were analyzed and compared. While all purified proteins showed

440

no detectable HCPs by western blot with anti-P. pastoris antibodies (Figure 5B), when

441

measured by ELISA different HCP content levels were observed. Process-2 showed the lowest

442

HCP content (6.8±0.0 ng) per mg of purified protein while Process-1 showed the highest HCP

443

content (95.9±8.2 ng) and Process-3 showed 44.8±13.0 ng (Figure 5C). The higher HCP

444

content found in the purified protein from Process-1 was likely due to the presence of HCP

445

with a similar size of RBD219-N1C1, which further suggested that SEC might not be an ideal

446

purification step. No significant difference in endotoxin level was measured in the purified

447

protein from three processes (Figure 5D), albeit all protein preparations contained less than the

448

maximally allowed endotoxin levels. Finally, the functionality of the purified proteins from

449

three processes tested by in vitro ACE2 binding assay showed that all three proteins showed

450

similar binding to recombinant human ACE2 receptor (Figure 6).

451

In summary, after comparing yield, purity, and recovery after each purification, we

452

conclude that HIC for capture due to its superior capability to remove non-specific host proteins

453

and produce protein with >95% purity, and AEX for polishing due to its low cost and full

454

scalability (Process-2) are best suited to produce RBD219-N1C1. In addition, comparison for

455

the integrity, dimer content, HCP contents, and endotoxin level in purified protein supported

456

the Process-2 generates quality proteins similar to Process-1 but significantly better than

457

Process-3 and, hence, is a more ideal process for upscaling.

458

P. pastoris is widely used to produce recombinant proteins for clinical and commercial

459

use. The P. pastoris system is licensed to more than 300 companies in the biotechnology,

460

pharmaceutical, vaccine, animal health, and food industries, and more than 70 therapeutic and

461

industrial products are approved by stringent regulatory bodies including human insulin, Hep

462

B vaccine, cytokines, and hormones [26]. P. pastoris offers high growth rates, high cell

463

densities, and high protein yield using simple and inexpensive fermentation media.

464

Fermentation conditions are highly scalable due to the robust nature of P. pastoris, and the

465

manufacturing times are short. With such an effective production platform and the availability

466

of manufacturing facilities including vaccine manufacturers from the developing countries

467

network, we can produce this COVID vaccine candidate at a low cost to meet the urgent global

468

needs. The production technology of RBD219-N1C1 was transferred to Biological E. Limited,

469

an India-based vaccine and pharmaceutical company, and a Phase I/II clinical trial was initiated

470

in November 2020 in India [11,10].
