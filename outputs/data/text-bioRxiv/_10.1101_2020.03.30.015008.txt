Abstract
There are outstanding evolutionary questions on the recent emergence of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19
in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus to the
SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential role of other mammals
in the emergence event, and (4) the role of recombination in viral emergence. Here, we address these questions
and find that the sarbecoviruses – the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 – exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any
viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between
SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment
were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were
consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based
on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat
sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and
1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage
giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other
hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with
the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries
again.

In Brief
The Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent
recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify
non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects
of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus
evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARSCoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982.

Key Points


RaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to
infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins.



The sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of
co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and
substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient ‘explorers’ of phenotype space.



The SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin
viruses sampled to date.



Non-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and
dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods.



We estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled
reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats.



While an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution
for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.

Introduction.
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases epidemiologically linked to an open-air wet market
in city of Wuhan (Hubei Province), China (Li et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020b) led local health officials to
issue an epidemiological alert to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and the
World Health Organization’s (WHO) China Country Office. In early January, the etiological agent of the
pneumonia cases was found to be a coronavirus (World Health Organization, 2020a), subsequently named
SARS-CoV-2 by an International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Study Group (Gorbalenya et
al., 2020), (also named hCoV-19 by (Wu et al., 2020b)). The first available sequence data (Wu et al., 2020a)
placed this novel human pathogen in the Sarbecovirus subgenus of Coronaviridae (Lu et al., 2020), the same
sub-genus as the SARS virus that caused a global outbreak of nearly 8000 cases in 2002-2003. By midJanuary, the virus was spreading widely inside Hubei province and by early March SARS-CoV-2 reached
pandemic status (World Health Organization, 2020b).
In outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens, identification of the infection source is crucial, as this may allow
health authorities to separate human populations from the wild-life or domestic-animal reservoirs posing the
zoonotic risk (Stegeman et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2013). If controlling an outbreak in its early stages is not
possible – as was the case for the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province – identification of origins and point
sources is nevertheless important for containment purposes in other provinces and prevention of future
outbreaks. When the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan-Hu-1, was released on January 10 2020
on Virological.org by a consortium led by Yong-Zhen Zhang (Wu et al., 2020a) it enabled the immediate
analyses of its ancestry. Across a large region of its genome, corresponding approximately to ORF1b , it did
not cluster with any of the known bat coronaviruses indicating that recombination likely played a role in the
evolutionary history of these viruses (Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al. 2020b). Subsequently, a bat sarbecovirus –
RaTG13 sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis horseshoe bat in 2013 in Yunnan province – was reported that
clusters with SARS-CoV-2 in almost all genomic regions with approximately 96% genome sequence identity
(Zhou et al., 2020b). Zhou et al. (2020b) concluded from the genetic proximity of SARS-CoV-2 to a bat virus
that a bat origin for the current COVID-19 outbreak is probable. Recent evidence has also identified pangolins
as potential intermediate species for SARS-CoV-2 emergence or as a potential reservoir species themselves
(Lam et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020).
Unlike other viruses that have emerged in the past two decades, coronaviruses are highly
recombinogenic (Forni et al., 2017; Hon et al., 2008; Lam et al., 2018). Influenza viruses reassort (Webster et
al., 1992) but they do not undergo homologous recombination within RNA segments (Boni et al., 2008, 2010),
meaning that ‘origins’ questions for influenza outbreaks can always be reduced to origins questions for each
of influenza’s eight RNA segments. For coronaviruses however, recombination means that small genomic
sub-regions can have independent origins, identifiable if sufficient sampling has been done in the animal
reservoirs that support the endemic circulation, coinfection, and recombination that appear to be common.
Here, we analyse the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2, using available genomic data on sarbecoviruses.
We demonstrate that the sarbecoviruses circulating in horseshoe bats have complex recombination histories

permitting generation of novel viral variants, as reported by others (He et al., 2014; Hon et al., 2008; Hu et
al., 2017; Li et al., 2020b; Lin et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2020a).
Interestingly, despite the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 acquiring residues in its Spike (S) protein’s receptorbinding domain (RBD) permitting use of human ACE2 (Wan et al., 2020) and being closer to the pangolin
virus than RaTG13 in this region (Lam et al., 2020) – a signal that suggests recombination – the divergence
patterns in the S protein show no evidence of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and known
sarbecoviruses. Our results indicate the presence of a single lineage circulating in bats with properties that
allowed it to infect human cells, as previously described for the bat sarbecoviruses related to the first SARSCoV lineage (Ge et al., 2013; Menachery et al., 2015, 2016).
To gauge the length of time this lineage has circulated in bats we estimate the time to most recent
common ancestor (tMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. We use three bioinformatic approaches to remove
the effects of recombination, and we combine these approaches to identify putative non-recombinant regions
that can be used for reliable phylogenetic reconstruction and dating. Collectively our analyses point to bats
being the primary reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. While it is possible that pangolins may have acted
as an intermediate species facilitating transmission to humans, the evidence is consistent with the virus having
evolved in bats resulting in bat sarbecoviruses that can replicate in the upper respiratory tract of both humans
and pangolins (Zhang and Holmes, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a).
Results
Recombination analysis and identification of breakpoint-free genome regions
Of the 68 sequences in the aligned sarbecovirus sequence set, 67 show evidence of mosaicism,
indicating involvement in homologous recombination either directly with identifiable parentals or in their
deeper shared evolutionary history, i.e., due to shared ancestral recombination events (all Dunn-Sidak
corrected p < 4 × 10-4, 3SEQ (Lam et al., 2018)). This is evidence for numerous recombination events
occurring in the evolutionary history of the sarbecoviruses (Li et al., 2020b); however, identifying all past
events and their temporal order (Eden et al., 2013) is challenging. Figure 1 (top) shows the distribution of all
identified breakpoints (using 3SEQ’s exhaustive triplet search) by the number of candidate recombinant
sequences supporting them. The histogram allows for the identification of non-recombining regions by
revealing regions with no breakpoints. Sorting these breakpoint-free regions (BFRs) by length results in two
segments longer than 5kb: an ORF1a sub-region spanning nucleotides 3625-9150 and the first half of ORF1b
spanning nucleotides 13291-19628. Eight other BFRs longer than 500nt were identified. Of the nine
breakpoints (defining these ten BFRs), four showed phylogenetic incongruence (PI) signals with bootstrap
support higher than 80%, adopting previously published criteria on using a combination of mosaic and PIsignals to show evidence of past recombination events (Boni et al., 2010). All four of these breakpoints were
also identified with the tree-based recombination detection method GARD (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006).
The extent of the sarbecoviruses’ recombination history can be demonstrated by five phylogenetic
trees inferred from BFRs or concatenated adjacent BFRs (Figure 1, bottom). BFRs were concatenated if no

phylogenetic incongruence signal could be identified between them. When viewing the last 7kb of the genome
a clade of viruses from northeast (NE) China appears to cluster with sequences from south-central (SC)
Chinese provinces, but when inspecting trees from different parts of ORF1ab the NE China clade is
phylogenetically separated from the SC China clade. Individual sequences such as RpShaanxi2011, Guangxi
GX2013, and two sequences from Zhejiang province (CoVZXC21/CoVZC45), as previously shown (Li et al.,
2020b; Zhou et al., 2020a), show strong phylogenetic recombination signals, as they fall on different
evolutionary lineages (with bootstrap support > 80%) depending what region of the genome is being examined.
Despite this high frequency of recombination among bat viruses, the ‘block-like’ nature of the genome
permits retrieval of a clean sub-alignment for phylogenetic analysis. Conservatively, we can combine three
>2kb BFRs identified above into a putative non-recombining region 1 (NRR1), after removing five sequences
that appear to be recombinants and two small sub-regions of the longer region (nucleotides 13291-19628).
Alternatively, combining 3SEQ-inferred breakpoints with GARD-inferred breakpoints and the necessity of
PI-signals for inferring recombination, we can use the 9.9kb region spanning nucleotides 11885-21753
(NRR2) as a putative non-recombining region; this approach is conservative in identifying breakpoints but
not conservative in identifying non-recombining regions. Using a third consensus-based approach for
identifying recombinant regions in individual sequences – with six different recombination detection methods
in RDP5 (Martin et al., 2015) – gives a putative recombination-free alignment that we call non-recombinant
alignment 3 (NRA3) (see Methods).
All three approaches to removing recombinant genomic segments point to a single ancestral lineage
for SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. Two other bat viruses (CoVZXC21 and CoVZC45) from Zhejiang province
fall on this lineage as recombinants of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage and the clade of Hong Kong bat
viruses sampled between 2005 and 2007 (Figure 1, bottom). Specifically, progenitors of the RaTG13/SARSCoV-2 lineage appear to have recombined with the Hong Kong clade (with inferred breakpoints at 11.9kb and
20.8kb) to form the CoVZXC21/CoVZC45-lineage. Ancestors to the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage also
include a pangolin sequence sampled in Guangdong province in March 2019 and a clade of pangolin sequences
from Guangxi province sampled in 2017. Major phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships are shown
in Figure 2, with phylogenies reconstructed for two major sub-regions of NRR1.
As the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been implicated in past recombination events or possibly
convergent evolution (Lam et al., 2020), we specifically investigated several sub-regions of the S protein –
the N-terminal domain of S1, the C-terminal domain of S1, the variable loop region of the C-terminal domain,
and S2. The variable loop region in SARS-CoV-2 shows closer identity to the 2019 pangolin coronavirus
sequence than to the RaTG13 bat virus, supported by phylogenetic inference (Figure 3). On first examination
this would suggest that that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant of an ancestor of Pangolin-2019 and RaTG13.
However, on closer inspection, the relative divergences in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3, bottom) show that
SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have acquired the variable loop from an ancestor of Pangolin-2019 as these two
sequences are approximately 10% divergent throughout the entire S protein (excluding the NTD). It is RaTG13
that is divergent in the variable loop region and is the likely product of recombination, acquiring a divergent

variable loop from an as yet unsampled bat sarbecovirus. This is notable because the variable loop region
contains the six key contact residues in the receptor binding domain (RBD) that give SARS-CoV-2 its ACE2
binding specificity (Anderson et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020). These residues are also in the 2019 pangolin
coronavirus sequence. The most parsimonious explanation for these shared residues is a single bat virus
lineage (including the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and Pangolin Guangdong 2019) has the
ACE2 specific residues, rather than the SARS-CoV-2 being recombinant. This provides compelling support
for the SARS-CoV-2 lineage being the consequence of a direct or nearly-direct zoonotic jump from bats
because the key ACE2 binding residues were present in viruses circulating in bats.
Ancestry in non-recombinant regions
Using the most conservative approach to identifying a non-recombinant genomic region (NRR1),
SARS-CoV-2 forms a sister lineage with RaTG13, with genetically related cousin lineages of coronavirus
sampled in pangolins in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces (Figure 2). Given that these pangolin viruses are
ancestral to the progenitor of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage, it is more likely that they are also picking up
viruses from bats. While pangolins could be acting as intermediate hosts for bat viruses to get into humans —
they develop severe respiratory disease (Lie et al., 2019) and commonly come into contact with people as they
are trafficked in large numbers for consumption and use in Chinese medicine — pangolin infection is not a
requirement for bat viruses to cross into humans.
Phylogenies of sub-regions of NRR1 depict an appreciable degree of spatial structuring of the
sarbecoviruses population across different regions (Figure 2). One cluster consists of viruses from provinces
in southcentral (SC) China (Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou) as well as one sequence from Sichuan province. The
major cluster in its sister lineage is almost exclusively occupied by viruses from provinces in northeast (NE)
and central China (Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Zheijang and Jilin).

the S protein. SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are the most closely related (their most recent common ancestor
node denoted by a green circle), except in the 220nt variable loop region of the C-terminal domain (bar graphs

SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin Guangdong 2019 ancestor, suggesting that RaTG13 has acquired this region from
a more divergent and undetected bat lineage. The genetic distances between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13

tMRCA for non-recombinant regions of SARS-CoV-2 lineage
To avoid artefacts due to recombination, we focused on the non-recombining regions NRR1, NRR2,
and the recombination-masked alignment NRA3 for inferring time-measured evolutionary histories. Visual
exploration using TempEst (Rambaut et al., 2016) indicates there is no evidence for temporal signal in these
data sets (Figure S1). This is not surprising for diverse viral populations with relatively deep evolutionary
histories. In such cases, even moderate rate variation among long deep phylogenetic branches will significantly
impact expected root-to-tip divergences over a sampling time range that represents only a small fraction of
the evolutionary history (Trova et al., 2015). However, formal testing using marginal likelihood estimation
(Duchene et al., 2019) does not reject the absence of temporal signal in all three data sets (Table S1), albeit
without strong support in favor of temporal signal (log Bayes factor support of 3, 10, and 3 for NRR1, NRR2,
and NRA3 respectively).
In the absence of a strong temporal signal, we sought to identify a suitable prior rate distribution to
calibrate the time-measured trees by examining several coronaviruses sampled through time, including HCoVOC43, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV virus genomes. These data sets were subjected to the same recombination
masking approach as NRA3 and were characterized by a strong temporal signal (Figure 4), but also by
markedly different evolutionary rates. Specifically, using a formal Bayesian approach (Suchard et al., 2018)
(see Methods), we estimate a fast evolutionary rate (0.00169 subst/site/yr, 95% highest posterior density
(HPD) interval [0.00131,0.00205]) for SARS viruses sampled over a limited time scale (1 year), a slower rate
(0.00078 [0.00063,0.00092] subst/site/yr) for MERS-CoV on a time scale of about 4 years, and the slowest
rate (0.00024 [0.00019,0.00029] subst/site/yr) for HCoV-OC43 over almost five decades. These differences
reflect the fact that rate estimates can vary considerably with the time scale of measurement, a frequently
observed phenomenon in viruses known as time-dependent evolutionary rates (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis,
2016; Duchene et al., 2014; Membrebe et al., 2019). Over relatively shallow time-scales, such differences can
primarily be explained by varying selective pressure with mildly deleterious variants being eliminated more
strongly by purifying selection over longer time scales (Holmes, 2009; Holmes et al., 2016; Membrebe et al.,
2019). In line with this, we estimate a concomitantly decreasing nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution
rate ratio (dN/dS) over longer evolutionary time-scales: 1.41 [1.20,1.68], 0.35 [0.30,0.41], and 0.133
[0.129,0.136] for SARS, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 respectively. In the light of these time-dependent
evolutionary rate dynamics, a rate in the slow range is appropriate for calibrating the sarbecovirus evolutionary
history, but we compare both MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 centred prior distributions (Figure S2) with
relatively large variances in our subsequent analyses in order to examine the sensitivity of the date estimates
to this prior specification.
We infer time-measured evolutionary histories using a Bayesian phylogenetic approach while
incorporating rate priors based on the mean MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 rates and with standard deviations
that allow for more uncertainty than the empirical estimates for both viruses (see Methods). Using both prior
distributions, this results in six highly similar posterior rate estimates for NRR1, NRR2, and NRA3, centered
around 0.00055 subst/site/yr. The fact that these estimates lie in between the MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43

rate is consistent with the intermediate sampling time range of about 18 years (Figure 5). The consistency of
the posterior rates for the different prior means also implies that the data do contribute to the evolutionary rate
estimate despite the fact that a temporal signal was visually not apparent (Figure S1). Below, we report
divergence time estimates based on the HCoV-OC43-centred rate priors, but also summarize similar
corresponding estimates for the MERS-CoV-centred rate priors in Supplementary Figure S3.

The divergence time estimates for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV from their respective most closely
related bat lineages are reasonably consistent among the three approaches we use to eliminate the effects of
recombination in the alignment. Using the most conservative approach (NRR1), the divergence time estimate
for SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000) while the divergence time estimate between
SARS-CoV and its most closely related bat sequence is 1962 (95% HPD: 1932-1988); see Figure 5. These

are in general agreement with estimates using NRR2 and NRA3, which result in divergence times of 1982
[1948,2009] and 1948 [1879-1999], respectively, for SARS-CoV-2, and estimates of 1952 [1906, 1989] and
1970 [1932-1996], respectively, for the divergence time of SARS-CoV from its closest known bat ancestor.
The SARS-CoV divergence times are somewhat earlier than previously estimated dates (Hon et al., 2008) as
previous estimates were obtained using a collection of SARS-CoV genomes from human and civet hosts (as
well as a few closely related bat genomes) which implies that the evolutionary rates were predominantly
informed by the short-term SARS outbreak scale and likely biased upwards for the time scale under
investigation. Indeed, the rates reported by these studies are in line with the short-term SARS rates we estimate
(Figure 4). The estimated divergence times for the pangolin virus most closely related to SARS-CoV2/RaTG13 range from 1851 [1730,1958] to 1877 [1746,1986], indicating that these pangolin lineages were
acquired from bat viruses divergent to those that gave rise to SARS-CoV-2. Current sampling of pangolins
does not implicate them as an intermediate host.
Discussion
Identifying the origins of an emerging pathogen can be critical during the early stages of an outbreak as it may
allow for containment measures to be precisely targeted at a stage when the number of daily new infections is
still low. Early detection via genomics and sequencing was not possible during SE Asia’s initial outbreaks of
avian influenza H5N1 (1997, 2003-2004) or the first SARS outbreak (2002-2003). By 2009 however rapid
genomic analysis was a routine component of outbreak response. The 2009 influenza pandemic and
subsequent outbreaks of MERS-CoV (2012), H7N9 avian influenza (2013), Ebola virus (2014), and Zika virus
(2015) were met with rapid sequencing and genomic characterization. For the current pandemic, the ‘novel
pathogen identification’ component of outbreak response delivered on its promise, with viral identification
and rapid genomic analysis providing confirmation and a genome sequence, within weeks, that the December
2019 outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a coronavirus (World Health Organization, 2020a). Unfortunately, a
response that would achieve containment was not possible. Given what was known about the origins of SARS
as well as identification of SARS-like viruses circulating in bats that had binding sites adapted to human
receptors (Ge et al., 2013; Menachery et al., 2015, 2016), appropriate measures should have been in place for
outbreaks of novel coronaviruses. The key to successful surveillance is that we know which human-adapted
viral phenotypes to look for (Holmes et al., 2018).
The key difficulty in inferring reliable evolutionary histories for coronaviruses is that their high
recombination rate (Graham and Baric, 2010; Su et al., 2016) violates the assumption of standard phylogenetic
approaches because different parts of the genome will have different origins. In order to begin characterizing
any ancestral relationships for SARS-CoV-2, non-recombinant regions of the genome must be identified, so
that reliable phylogenetic reconstruction and dating can be performed. Evolutionary rate estimation can be
profoundly affected by the presence of recombination (Schierup and Hein, 1999). As there is no single
accepted method of inferring breakpoints and identifying clean sub-regions with high certainty, we
implemented several approaches to identifying three classic statistical signals of recombination: mosaicism,

phylogenetic incongruence and excessive homoplasy (Posada et al., 2002). Our most conservative approach
attempted to ensure that putative non-recombining regions had no mosaic or phylogenetic incongruence
signals. A second approach was conservative with respect to breakpoint identification, while a third approach
attempted to minimize the number of regions removed while still minimizing signals of mosaicism and
homoplasy. The origins we present in Figure 5 (NRR1) are conservative in the sense that NRR1 is more likely
to be non-recombinant than NRR2 or NRA3. As the estimated rates and divergence dates were highly similar
in the three data sets analyzed, we conclude that our estimates are robust to the method of identifying the
genome’s non-recombinant regions.
Due to the absence of temporal signal in the sarbecovirus data sets, we used informative prior
distributions on the evolutionary rate to estimate divergence dates. We show that such prior calibration
information can be obtained from other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43), but their
rates vary with the time scale of sample collection. In the presence of time-dependent rate variation, a widely
observed phenomenon for viruses (Duchene et al., 2014; Aiewsakun and Katzourakis, 2016; Membrebe et al.,
2019), the slower rates appear more appropriate for sarbecoviruses that currently encompass a sampling time
range of about 18 years. We therefore centered the prior rate distributions on the mean HCoV-OC43 and
MERS-CoV rate, but permitted the distributions a greater variance than the empirical rate estimates for these
lineages. This approach resulted in similar posterior rates despite the different prior means, implying that the
sarbecovirus data do inform the rate estimate even though root-to-top temporal signal was not apparent.
The relatively fast evolutionary rate means that it is most appropriate to estimate shallow nodes in the
sarbecovirus evolutionary history including the divergence times of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 from their
most closely related bat viruses. Accurately estimating deeper nodes would require adequately
accommodating time-dependent rate variation. While such models have recently been made available, we lack
the information to calibrate the rate decline through time (e.g. through internal node calibrations (Membrebe
et al., 2019)). As a proxy, it would be possible to model the long-term purifying selection dynamics as a major
source of time-dependent rates rates (Duchene et al., 2014; Aiewsakun and Katzourakis, 2016; Membrebe et
al., 2019), but this is beyond the scope of the current study. The assumption of long-term purifying selection
would imply that coronaviruses are at endemic equilibrium with their natural host species, horseshoe bats, to
which they are presumably well-adapted. Although there is currently little evidence supporting or
contradicting strong positive selection in the sarbecovirus lineage, if multiple host species were to be identified
that are able to support endemic viral transmission, then the positive selection that would be associated with
new species adaptations would need to be considered when inferring evolutionary rate variation through time.
Of importance for future emergence events is the appreciation that SARS-CoV-2 has emerged from
the same horseshoe bat subgenus that harbours SARS-like coronaviruses. Another similarity between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 is their divergence time (40-70 years ago) from currently known extant bat-virus
lineages (Figure 5). This long divergence period indicates there are unsampled viruses circulating in horseshoe
bats that have zoonotic potential (Zhou et al., 2020a). While there is clear involvement of other mammalian
species – specifically pangolins for SARS-CoV-2 – as a plausible conduit for transmission to humans, there

is no evidence pangolins are facilitating adaptation to humans. A hypothesis of snakes as intermediate hosts
of SARS-CoV-2 was posited during the early epidemic phase (Ji et al., 2020), but we found no evidence of
this (Anderson, 2020; Robertson, 2020); see Supplementary Section 3.
With horseshoe bats currently the most plausible source for SARS-CoV-2, it is important to consider
that sarbecoviruses circulate in a variety of horseshoe bat species with often widely overlapping species ranges
(Wong et al., 2019). Yet, the viral population is largely spatially structured according to provinces in the south
and southeast on one lineage, and provinces in the center, east, and northeast on another (Figure 2). This
boundary appears to be rarely crossed. Two exceptions can be seen in the relatively close relationship of
viruses from Hong Kong bats to viruses from Zheijang (with two of the latter, CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21,
identified as recombinants) and a recombinant virus from Sichuan for which part of the genome (region B of
SC2018 in Figure 2) clusters with viruses from provinces in the center, east, and northeast of China. SARSCoV-2 and RaTG13 are also exceptions as they were sampled from Hubei and Yunnan, respectively. The fact
that they are geographically relatively distant is in agreement with their somewhat distant tMRCA because the
spatial structure suggests that migration between their locations may be uncommon. From this perspective, it
may be useful to perform surveillance for more closely related virus to SARS-CoV-2 along the gradient from
Yunnan to Hubei.
It is clear from our analysis that viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been circulating in
horseshoe bats for many decades. The substantial unsampled diversity on the SARS-CoV-2/RaTG13 lineage
suggests that there is a major clade of bat sarbecoviruses with generalist properties – with respect to their
ability to infect a range of mammalian cells – that facilitated its jump to humans and may do so again. Although
the human ACE2-compatible receptor binding domain was very likely to have been present in a bat
sarbecovirus lineage that ultimately lead to SARS-CoV-2, this RBD sequence has thus far only been found in
a few pangolin viruses. Furthermore, the other key feature thought to be instrumental to SARS-CoV-2’s ability
to infect humans – a polybasic cleavage site insertion in the Spike protein – has been seen in another close bat
relative of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Zhou et al., 2020a); however, the sequence is different and it is likely an
independent event.
The existing diversity and dynamic process of recombination amongst lineages in the bat reservoir
demonstrate how difficult it will be to identify viruses with potential to cause significant human outbreaks
before they emerge. This underscores the need for a global network of real-time human disease surveillance
systems like that which identified the unusual cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan in December 2019 and the rapid
deployment of functional studies and genomic tools for pathogen identification and characterization.

Methods
Data set compilation
Sarbecovirus data. Complete genome sequence data were downloaded from GenBank and ViPIR; accession
numbers available in Supplementary Section 4. Sequences were aligned by MAFTT (Katoh et al., 2009), with
a final alignment length of 30927, and used in the analyses below.
HCoV-OC43. We compiled a data set including 27 human coronavirus OC43 virus genomes and 10
related animal virus genomes (6 bovine, 3 white-tailed deer and one canine virus). The canine viral genome
was excluded from the Bayesian phylogenetic analyses because temporal signal analyses (see below) indicated
that it was an outlier.
MERS-CoV. We extracted a similar number (n = 35) of genomes from a MERS-CoV data set analysed
by Dudas et al (2018) using the phylogenetic diversity analyser tool (Chernomor et al., 2015).
SARS-CoV. We compiled a set of 69 SARS-CoV genomes including 58 genomes sampled from
human and 11 sampled from civets and raccoon dogs. This data set comprises an updated version of the one
used in Hon et al (2008).
Recombination analysis
As coronaviruses are known to be highly recombinant, we used three different approaches to identify nonrecombinant regions to be used in our Bayesian time-calibrated phylogenetic inference.
First, we took an approach that relies on identifying mosaic regions (via 3SEQ) that are also supported
by phylogenetic incongruence (PI) signals (Boni et al., 2010). As 3SEQ is the most powerful the mosaic
methods (Boni et al., 2007), we used 3SEQ to identify the best supported breakpoint history for each potential
child (recombinant) sequence in the data set. A single 3SEQ run on the genome alignment resulted in 67 out
of 68 sequences supporting some recombination in the past, with multiple candidate breakpoint ranges listed
for each putative recombinant. Then, we (a) collected all breakpoints into a single set, (b) complemented this
set to generate a set of non-breakpoints, (c) grouped the non-breakpoints into contiguous breakpoint-free
regions (BFRs), and (d) sorted these regions by length. A phylogenetic tree – using RAxML v8.2.8
(Stamatakis, 2014, 2006), GTR+Γ model, 100 bootstrap replicates – was inferred for each BFR longer than
500nt.
We considered both (1) the possibility that BFRs could be combined into larger non-recombinant
regions, and (2) the possibility of further recombination within each BFR.
We named the length-sorted BFRs as: region A (nt positions 13291-19628, length=6338nt), region B
(nt positions 3625-9150, length=5526nt), region C (nt positions 9261-11795, length=2535nt), region D (nt
positions 27702-28843, length=1142nt), and six more through region J. Phylogenetic trees for all ten BFRs
are shown in Supplementary Figures S5-S14. Regions A, B, and C had similar phylogenetic relationships
among the southcentral China bat viruses (Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou provinces), the Hong Kong viruses,
northeastern Chinese viruses (Jilin, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan provinces), pangolin viruses, and the
SARS-CoV-2 lineage. As these subclades had different phylogenetic relationships in region D (Supplementary

Section 5), region D and shorter BFRs were not further included into a combined putative non-recombinant
regions.
Regions A, B, and C were further examined for mosaic signals by 3SEQ; all showed signs of
mosaicism. In region A, we removed sub-region A1 (nt positions 3872-4716 within region A) and sub-region
A4 (nt 1642-2113) as both of these showed PI-signals with other sub-regions of region A. After removal of
A1 and A4, we named the new region A′. In addition, sequences NC_014470 (Bulgaria 2008), CoVZXC21,
CoVZC45, and DQ412042 (Hubei-Yichang) needed to be removed to maintain a clean non-recombinant
signal in A′. Region B showed no PI-signals within the region, except one including sequence SC2018
(Sichuan), thus this sequence was also removed from the set. Region C showed no PI-signals within it.
Combining regions A′, B, and C, and removing the five mentioned sequences gives us putative nonrecombining region 1, or NRR1, as an alignment of 63 sequences.
Second, we wanted to construct non-recombinant regions where our approach to breakpoint
identification was as conservative as possible. In this approach, we considered a breakpoint supported only if
it had three types of statistical support from (1) mosaic signals identified by 3SEQ, (2) PI-signals identified
by building trees around 3SEQ’s breakpoints, (3) the GARD algorithm (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006) which
identifies breakpoints by identifying PI-signals across proposed breakpoints. Since 3SEQ identified 10 BFRs
longer than 500nt, we used GARD’s inference on 10, 11, and 12 breakpoints. A reduced sequence set of 25
sequences chosen to capture the breadth of diversity in the sarbecoviruses (obvious recombinants not involving
the SARS-CoV-2 lineage were also excluded) was used as GARD is computationally intensive. GARD
identified eight breakpoints that were also within 50nt of breakpoints identified by 3SEQ. PI-signals were
identified (with bootstrap support >80%) for seven of these eight breakpoints: positions 1684, 3046, 9237,
11885, 21753, 22773, and 24628. Using these breakpoints, the longest putative non-recombining segment (nt
11885-21753) is 9.9kb long, and we call this region NRR2. Because this approach to breakpoint identification
is conservative, the approach to identifying non-recombinant regions is not conservative.
Our third approach involved identifying breakpoints and masking minor recombinant regions (with
gaps, which are treated as unobserved characters in probabilistic phylogenetic approaches). Specifically, we
used a combination of six methods implemented in RDP5 (RDP, GENECONV, MaxChi, Bootscan SisScan
and 3SEQ) and considered recombination signals detected by more than two methods for breakpoint
identification. Except for specifying that sequences are linear, all settings were kept to their defaults. Based
on the identified breakpoints in each genome, only the major non-recombinant region is kept in each genome
while other regions are masked. To evaluate the performance procedure, we confirmed that the recombination
masking resulted in (i) a significantly different outcome of the PHI-test (Bruen et al., 2006), (ii) a removal of
well-supported (bootstrap value >95%) incompatible splits in Neighbor-Nets (Bryant and Moulton, 2004),
and (iii) a near-complete reduction of mosaic signal as identified by 3SEQ. If the latter still identified nonnegligible recombination signal, we removed additional genomes that were identified as the major contributors
to the remaining signal. This produced non-recombining alignment NRA3, which included 63 of the 68
genomes.

Bayesian divergence time estimation
We focused on these three non-recombining regions/alignments for divergence time estimation. This avoids
inappropriately modelling evolutionary processes with recombination on strictly bifurcating trees, which can
result in different artefacts such as homoplasies that inflate branch lengths and result in apparently longer
evolutionary divergence times. In order to examine temporal signal in the sequenced data, we plotted root-totip divergence against sampling time using TempEst (Rambaut et al., 2016) based on a maximum likelihood
tree. The latter was reconstructed using IQTREE (Nguyen et al., 2014) under a General-Time Reversible
(GTR) model with a discrete gamma distribution to model among-site rate variation.
Time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using a Bayesian approach implemented
in BEAST (Suchard et al., 2018). When the genomic data included both coding and noncoding regions we
used a single GTR+Γ substitution model; for concatenated coding genes we partitioned the alignment by codon
positions and specified an independent GTR+Γ model for each partition with a separate gamma model to
accommodate among-site rate variation. We used an uncorrelated relaxed clock model with a lognormal
distribution for all data sets, except for the low-diversity SARS data for which we specified a strict molecular
clock model. For the HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and SARS data sets we specified flexible skygrid coalescent
tree priors. In the absence of any reasonable prior knowledge on the tMRCA of the sarbecovirus data sets
(which is required for the grid specification in a skygrid model), we specified a simpler constant size
population prior. As informative rate priors for the analysis of the sarbecovirus data sets, we used two different
normal prior distributions: one with a mean of 0.00078 and a standard deviation of 0.0003 and one with a
mean of 0.00024 and standard deviation of 0.0001. These means are based on the mean rates estimated for
MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 respectively, while the standard deviations are set ten times larger than the
empirical standard deviations to allow more prior uncertainty and avoid strong bias (Supplementary Fig. 2).
In our analyses of the sarbecovirus data sets, we incorporated the uncertainty of the sampling dates when exact
dates were not available. To estimate nonsynonymous over synonymous rate ratios for the concatenated
coding genes, we used the empirical Bayes ‘Renaissance counting’ procedure (Lemey et al., 2012). Temporal
signal was tested using a recently developed marginal likelihood estimation procedure (Duchene et al., 2019)
(Table S1).
Posterior distributions were approximated through Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, which were
run sufficiently long to ensure effective sampling sizes > 100. BEAST inferences made use of the BEAGLEv3
library (Yres et al., 2019) for efficient likelihood computations. We used TreeAnnotator to summarize the
posterior tree distributions and annotated the estimated to a maximum clade credibility tree, which was
visualized using FigTree.
