Receptor binding studies using recombinant SARS-CoV proteins have

27

been hampered due to challenges in approaches creating spike protein

28

or domains thereof, that recapitulate receptor binding properties of native

29

viruses. We hypothesized that trimeric RBD proteins would be suitable

30

candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2.

31

Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins,

32

derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to

33

analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor

34

binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins

35

are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely

36

glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used

37

cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations,

38

substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of

39

experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated

40

distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the

41

higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results

42

show that fully glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to

43

analyze receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.

INTRODUCTION

56

SARS-CoV-2 has sparked a society changing pandemic, and additional means

57

to understand this virus will facilitate counter-measures. SARS coronaviruses

58

carry a single protruding envelope protein, called spike, that is essential for

59

binding to and subsequent infection of the host cell. The trimeric spike protein

60

consists of 3 protomers of 140kD each, containing 60 N-linked glycosylation

61

sites. The spike is composed of an S1 and S2 domain, in which S2 contains

62

membrane fusion activity. S1 of coronaviruses can be further divided into N-

63

terminal and C-terminal domains (NTD & CTD), both can contain the receptor-

64

binding domain. In SARS-CoV-1 and -2 this domain is located in the CTD and

65

referred to as the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD binds to

66

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1-3], which functions as an entry

67

receptor for SARS-CoV. After binding and internalization, several proteinases

68

induce the spike protein into its fusogenic form allowing the fusion of the viral

69

and target membrane. Although this pathway is known, the details that are of

70

importance for receptor binding and what differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from its

71

predecessor SARS-CoV-1, are incompletely understood. It has been shown

72

that the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike to ACE2 is significantly higher

73

compared to SARS-CoV-1 [2, 4]. However, how this relates to tissue and cell

74

tropism remains to be determined.

76

Several recombinant protein approaches to create coronavirus spike proteins

77

have been utilized with success for the development of serological assays [5],

78

elucidating of spike structures, and isolation of neutralizing antibodies [6, 7].

79

However, the conformation of the receptor-binding domain of the spike, which

80

can be in the “up” and “down” configuration [8-12], is highly variable. This

81

variability is important in receptor binding as only in the “up” conformation can

82

RBD bind ACE2. Approaches to control the conformation for vaccine purposes

83

using stabilization mutations appear to keep the RBD conformation in their

84

down-state [11, 12], making them non preferred proteins to analyze receptor-

85

binding properties. Also, the multimerization status of the RBD is critical to allow

86

the analysis of ACE2 interactions. While monomeric RBD proteins can be

87

efficiently made in large quantities [5], and bind ACE2, they are hardly used in

88

receptor binding assays to cells and tissues. The majority of studies analyzing

89

RBD protein binding to cells and tissues, utilize Fc-tagged proteins [2]. Fc-tags

90

on recombinant proteins are extremely convenient for mammalian cell

91

expression and purification systems, which result in dimeric recombinant spikes

92

that are biologically functional. However, the coronavirus spike is trimeric and

93

thus Fc tagged spikes do not fully recapitulate native properties.

94
95

We hypothesized that fluorescent trimeric RBD proteins would provide

96

complementary means to study RBD-receptor interactions. In this study, we

97

compared monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV RBD with full-length trimeric

98

spikes expressed in cells producing proteins with either complex or high

99

mannose glycosylation. The fusion of sfGFP and mOrange2 at the C-terminus

100

has previously been shown to increase expression yields, protein stability, and

101

afford additional means for fluorescent-based experiments [13], and thus are

102

attractive to be fused to RBD proteins. The resulting proteins were analyzed for

103

binding to cell culture cells and paraffin-embedded tissues of various hosts

104

including susceptible and non-susceptible animals. The results demonstrate

105

that fully glycosylated trimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins reveal the

106

differences in ACE2 expression between cell cultures and tissue sections.

107

These trimeric RBD proteins bind ACE2 efficiently in a species-dependent

108

manner and can be used to profile ACE2 tissue expression. Finally, we

109

observed distinct expression of ACE2 in bronchioles of experimental animal

110

models.

RESULTS

113

Generation of fluorescent coronavirus receptor-binding domain spike proteins

114

To create recombinant fluorescent soluble full-length ectodomains, NTDs and

115

RBDs, we cloned these open reading frames (ORF) in plasmids with and

116

without the GCN4 trimerization domain, fused to either sfGFP or mOrange (Fig

117

1A). The monomeric and trimeric RBDs were efficiently expressed in both HEK

118

293T as well as GnTI cells (data not shown), with an increased yield up to 2- to

119

5-fold when fused to a C-terminal sfGFP (Fig 1B). Expression yields of the

120

mOrange2 fusions were comparable to that of sfGFP fusions (data not shown).

121

To illustrate the expression yields of SARS spike proteins or domains thereof

122

we measured the fluorescence in the cell culture supernatant (Fig 1C). The

123

wild-type full-length ectodomains were difficult to express even with the addition

124

of sfGFP or mOrange2 fusion (Fig 1B). To increase yields for the full-length

125

ectodomain we introduced the 2P and additional hexapro mutations [14], and

5

126

analyzed the fluorescence in cell culture supernatants five days post-

127

transfection after incubation at 33 or 37°C. Although we did not observe a large

128

increase in yields, we were able to purify sufficient protein to compare full-length

129

ectodomain trimers vs monomeric and trimeric RBD and NTD proteins.

130
131

Spike RBD domains in frame with a C-terminal GCN4 and fluorescent reporter

132

protein display multimeric features on gel and maintain antigenicity

133

After purification, all RBD proteins were analyzed on gel under non- and

134

reducing conditions (Fig 2A). Without reducing agent, monomeric RBD proteins

135

revealed dimeric fractions which could be reduced to a single monomeric form.

136

The NTD trimers were reduced under non-reducing conditions, thus solely by

137

SDS. The trimeric RBD variants, on the other hand, revealed dimers and trimers

138

that could be reduced. Besides, the NTD of prototypical γ-coronavirus IBV-M41

139

and influenza A virus HA PR8 as control proteins were included. Finally, we

140

determined the extent of N-glycosylation maturation on purified proteins

141

expressed in either GnTI or 293T by subjecting the monomeric and trimeric

142

proteins to PNGaseF and EndoH treatment (Fig S1). Upon PNGaseF

143

treatment, all N-glycans were trimmed whereas 293T derived proteins were

144

insensitive to Endo H, as expected. Surprisingly trimeric RBDs derived from

145

GnTI cells were partially resistant to Endo H treatment, whereas the monomers

146

derived from GnTI cells where fully deglycosylated using Endo H.

147
148

Fluorescent multimeric Spike RBD proteins maintain antigenicity

149

Next, we examined the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins using

150

serum collected from macaques 21 days post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 [15].

151

Both SARS-CoV-2 RBD monomers and trimers derived from 293T cells were

152

efficiently recognized, indicating proper folding (Fig 2B). As expected, SARS-

153

CoV-1 RBD proteins were poorly recognized, and the negative controls M41

154

NTD and PR8 HA displayed baseline binding identical to pre-infection serum.

155

The NTD trimers were likewise not recognized by the serum (not shown),

156

indicating that the majority of antibodies in naïve animals after infection are

157

directed against the SARS-CoV RBD [16]. Similar results were obtained using

158

GnTI-derived proteins, with the RBD trimer being less efficiently recognized by

159

the macaque serum than its monomeric counterpart. This is in line with recent

160

observations that insect cell-derived proteins are less well bound by serum

161

antibodies [5], indicating the importance of mature N-glycans.

162
163

RBD fused to GCN4 and sfGFP fold as trimers with three RBD and sfGFP

164

molecules divided by the trimerization coiled-coil.

165

To determine whether the fluorescent RBD trimers are indeed structured in a

166

trimeric manner we subjected these proteins to negative stain single-particle

167

EM. The EM data revealed that the RBD proteins form stable trimers that

168

resemble known spike structures (Fig. 2C). Initially, 58,018 individual particles

169

were picked, placed into a stack, and submitted to reference-free two-

170

dimensional (2C) classification. From the initial 2D classes, particles that did

171

not resemble RBD were removed, resulting are final particle stacks of 32,152

172

particles, which were then subject to Relion 2D classification. All resultant

173

classes demonstrated evident and distinct trimeric RBD, GCN4, and three

174

sfGFP protein structures that could be identified in the EM images. From the

175

EM images, we generated a model in which we took the crystal structures of

176

sfGFP, the GCN4 trimerization domain (PDB:2O7H), and the SARS-CoV-2

177

RBD (PDB: 6XM4) to demonstrate the likely structure of our RBD trimer (Fig

178

2D).

179
180

Fluorescent multimeric Spike RBD proteins bind cell lines in an ACE2

181

dependent manner and similar to the full-length ectodomain.

182

To determine the biological activity of our RBD proteins we stained A549 and

183

VERO cells that are reported to support SARS-CoV replication, with the latter

184

being more susceptible [17]. However, A549 cells were bound by all our RBD

185

proteins with a slight increase in intensity from monomeric GnTI derived RBD

186

proteins to trimeric 293T derived RBDs (Fig 3). Trimeric 293T RBD binding was

187

efficiently blocked using 4μM recombinant ACE2 whereas 400nM ACE2 pre-

188

incubation was not sufficient to prevent binding of fully glycosylated trimeric

189

RBD proteins to cells completely. SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins bound slightly

190

more intensely to A549 cells compared to the same SARS-CoV-1 RBD

191

proteins. A similar pattern was observed for VERO-E6 cells, however, the fully

192

glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD trimer bound markedly stronger compared to

193

the other RBD preparations (Fig S2A). Importantly, the full-length ectodomain

194

also bound efficiently to A549 cells (Fig S2B). We did not observe any binding

195

of the trimeric NTD domains to A549 cells (Fig S2B). MDCK cells, derived from

196

canine kidney, served as negative controls, to which we indeed did not observe

197

any binding with any of the indicated proteins (Fig S2C).

198
199

Fluorescent RBD proteins reveal strong binding to bronchioles in both ferret

200

and Syrian golden hamster lungs.

201

Ferrets are a susceptible animal model for SARS-CoV-2 [18, 19] and closely

202

related minks are easily infected on farms [20]. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-

203

embedded tissue slides, will most closely resemble the complex membrane

204

structures to which spike proteins need to bind. First, ACE2 expression was

205

assessed using an ACE2 antibody which allowed for comparisons with SARS-

206

CoV-RBD protein binding localization. Here, ACE2 expression was observed in

207

bronchiolar epithelium cells of ferret lungs (Fig 4A), while the antibody failed to

208

bind mouse lungs. Comparably, the SARS-CoV RBD protein preparations did

209

not stain mouse lungs. In ferret lung tissues, we observed only minimal binding

210

of monomeric RBD proteins derived from GnTI cells (Fig 4B). The fully

211

glycosylated counterparts showed a slight increase in fluorescent intensity,

212

which was further increased when fully glycosylated trimeric RBDs were

213

applied. In all cases, SARS-CoV-2 displayed a higher avidity compared to

214

SARS-CoV-1. A similar trend of binding intensities was observed for

215

monomeric, trimeric, and different N-glycosylated SARS-CoV-RBD proteins

216

fused to mOrange2 (Fig S3A). Again specific binding was seen to the epithelium

217

of terminal bronchioles and, to a much lower extent, to alveoli and endothelium.

218

The results were confirmed using horseradish peroxidase readout with a

219

hematoxylin counterstain (Fig S3B), which output is enzyme driven and purely

220

qualitative, however, we did observe similar differences in staining intensities.

221

Here, very minimal staining using the SARS-CoV NTD domains was observed

222

(Fig S3B), which we did not detect using a fluorescent readout (Fig S3C). To

223

determine if the binding was ACE2 dependent we pre-incubated trimeric RBD

224

proteins with recombinant ACE2. While 4 μM was sufficient to block binding to

9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.282558; this version posted September 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this

225

cell culture cells (Fig 4C), 8μM was needed to prevent all detectable binding to

226

ferret lung tissue.

227
228

To confirm our observations of different binding on tissues, we quantified the

229

intensities of the ACE2 antibody and SARS-CoV-1 and -2 RBD proteins, except

230

for the monomeric GnTI derived proteins as these were almost at the

231

background (Fig 4D). As expected a noteworthy trend was observed of

232

increasing binding strength from SARS-CoV1 GnTI derived monomers to

233

SARS-CoV-2 fully glycosylated RBD trimers. Interestingly multimerization

234

appears to be more important for strong ACE2 interaction to tissue compared

235

to the glycosylation status.

236
237

Finally, we applied our RBD proteins on the lung tissue of Syrian hamsters,

238

which are currently the preferred small animal model and known to be highly

239

susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 and -2 [21-23]. Here again, trimeric fully

240

glycosylated RBD proteins were superior in binding compared to their

241

monomeric counterparts. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 bound with an even

242

higher intensity to terminal bronchioles compared to SARS-CoV-1. Importantly,

243

all binding could be inhibited by pre-incubation of the RBD proteins with

244

recombinant ACE2, indicating that binding intensity differences are likely ACE2

245

related.

246
247

DISCUSSION

248

In this report, we describe the generation of fluorescent trimeric RBD proteins

249

derived from SARS-CoV-1 and 2. These proteins can be efficiently expressed

250

in adherent cells and purified directly from the cell culture supernatant using the

251

increased protein yields provided by the introduction of a C-terminal sfGFP or

252

mOrange fusion. The fluorescent RBD trimers were superior in receptor binding

253

on tissues compared to their monomeric RBD counterparts.

254
255

Mature N-glycosylation on the spike protein appears to be important for the avid

256

binding of trimeric RBD proteins to ACE2 in different assays. There is a wealth

257

of information on site-specific N- and O- glycan conformations on spike proteins

258

[24-26], with some disagreement on the nature of the RBD N-glycans. In our

259

protein preparations, they appear to be complex as the majority could not be

260

cleaved by EndoH (Fig S1). Furthermore, the N-glycosylation of the NTD

261

domain has been shown to affect the conformation of the RBD in full-length

262

spikes [27], however similar analyses on the RBD N-glycans are lacking.

263
264

Currently, most knowledge of ACE2 expression is based on genomic and

265

transcriptomic data [28]. However, these analyses are limited as it does not

266

determine expression biochemically on epithelial cells that make contact to the

267

outside world [29]. Several groups have transfected variants of ACE2 in cells

268

to analyze transduction by SARS-CoV-pseudo viruses, although informative

269

these studies do not provide information on the natural expression pattern of

270

ACE2 in susceptible hosts [30, 31]. A detailed understanding of the difference

271

between animal species and cell-specific expression of ACE2 at the molecular

272

level is essential, as this can provide valuable knowledge on potential hosts

273

that can be susceptible to SARS-like coronaviruses. Here we demonstrate that

11

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.282558; this version posted September 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this

274

our fluorescent trimeric RBD proteins are complementary to study ACE2

275

expression and SARS-CoV receptor binding dynamics.

276
277

An intriguing observation was the abundant expression of ACE2 in terminal

278

bronchioles both in the ferret and Syrian hamster lungs, which are used as

279

experimental animal models. SARS-CoV-RBD protein binding correlated

280

perfectly with the staining of the ACE2 antibody and a ferret infection study [18].

281

In another ferret infection study, however, the infection was observed in nasal

282

epithelium and many type I pneumocytes and fewer type II pneumocytes in the

283

lungs, with few bronchial epithelial cells expressing viral antigen [19]. Some

284

studies have been performed with anti-ACE2 antibodies, but these stainings

285

appear not to correlate with infection patterns [32, 33]. We observed a similar

286

trend indicating that several other factors may be important to infect cells and

287

that infection could, in turn, regulate ACE2 expression.

We measure fluorescence in the cell culture supernatant when applicable using

324

a polarstar fluorescent reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 480

325

nm and 520 nm for sfGFP and 520nm and 550nm for mOrange2, respectively.

326

Spike protein expression was confirmed by western blotting using a StrepMAB-

327

HRP classic antibody. Proteins are purified using a single-step with strepTactin

328

sepharose beads in batch format. Purified proteins were pre-treated (were

329

indicated) with PNGase F or Endo H (New England Biolabs, USA) according to

330

the manufacturer’s protocol before analysis by Western blotting using Strep-

331

MAb-HRP classic antibody.

333

Antigen ELISA

334

Plates were coated with 2 μg/mL spike protein in PBS for 16 hours at 4°C,

335

followed by blocking by 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, VWR, 421501J) in

336

phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 0,1% (PBS-T 0,1%). After the block, the

337

proteins were detected using a 21-days post-infection macaque serum and

338

serum of the same monkey before infection. Serum starting dilution was 1:100

339

and diluted 1:1 for 5 times and incubated at RT for 2 hrs. Next, wells were

340

treated with goat-α-human HRP secondary antibody for 1 hour at room

341

temperature. Serum spike binding antibodies were detected using ODP and

342

measured in a plate reader (Polarstar Omega, BMG Labtech) at 490 nm.

Negative stain electron microscopy structural analysis

345

SARS-CoV2-RBD-GCN4-sfGFP in 10mM Tris, 150mM NaCl at 4°C was

346

deposited on 400 mesh copper negative stain grids and stained with 2% uranyl

347

formate. The grid was imaged on a 200KeV Tecnai F20 electron microscope

and a 4k x 4k TemCam F416 camera. Micrographs were collected using

349

Leginon [37] and then uploaded to Appion [38]. Particles were picked using

350

DoGPicker [39], stacked. 2D processing was undertaken using Relion. Images

351

showing Trimeric RBD, a GCN4 connector, and three sfGFPs.

352
353

Immunofluorescent cell staining

354

Vero-E6, A549, and MDCK cells grown on coverslips were analyzed by

355

immunofluorescent staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in

356

PBS for 25 min at RT after which permeabilization was performed using 0,1%

357

Triton in PBS. Subsequently, the coronavirus spike proteins were applied at

358

50μg/ml for 1 h at RT. Primary Strep-MAb classic chromeo-488 (IBA) and

359

secondary Alexa-fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen) were applied

360

sequentially with PBS washes in between. DAPI (Invitrogen) was used as

361

nuclear staining. Samples were imaged on a Leica DMi8 confocal microscope

362

equipped with a 10x HC PL Apo CS2 objective (NA. 0.40). Excitation was

363

achieved with a Diode 405 or white light for excitation of Alexa488 and

364

Alexa555, a pulsed white laser (80MHz) was used at 488 nm and 549 nm, and

365

emissions were obtained in the range of 498-531nm and 594-627 nm

366

respectively. Laser powers were 10 – 20% with a gain of a maximum of 200.

367

LAS Application Suite X was used as well as ImageJ for the addition of the

368

scale bars.

Tissue staining

371

Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ferret, Syrian hamster, and

372

mouse lungs were obtained from the Department of Veterinary Pathobiology,

373

Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University and the department of

374

Viroscience, Erasmus University, The Netherlands, respectively. Tissue

375

sections were rehydrated in a series of alcohol from 100%, 96% to 70%, and

376

lastly in distilled water. Tissues slides were boiled in citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 10

377

min at 900 kW in a microwave for antigen retrieval and washed in PBS-T three

378

times. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 1% hydrogen peroxide

379

for 30 min. Tissues were subsequently incubated with 3% BSA in PBS-T

380

overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the purified viral spike proteins (50μg/ml) were

381

added to the tissues for 1 h at RT. With rigorous washing steps in between the

382

proteins were detected with mouse anti-strep-tag- antibodies (IBA) and goat

383

anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Life Biosciences). Where indicated recombinant

384

RBD and ACE2 proteins were pre-incubated O/N at 4 °C before application on

385

lung tissues or cells.

386
387

Quantifying and plotting fluorescent image data

388

Image quantification was performed by measuring the intensity of gray pixels

389

of the stained ferret and Syrian hamster lung tissue slides with ImageJ version

390

1.52p. For stained tissues, background correction was performed by

391

subtracting the average signal intensity of the antibody control from the images

392

stained with ACE2 antibody, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV2 recombinant

393

proteins. Regions of interest were set by highlighting the area using the Image

394

-> Adjust -> Threshold setting. The 8-bit images were checked for saturation by

395

plotting the distribution of gray values with Analyze -> Histogram. Subsequent

396

analysis was performed by quantifying the mean ± standard deviation of

397

alveoli/cells stained with distinct proteins in various images (Analyze ->
