Abstract

36

Bats provide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation, pollination, seed dispersal,

37

and soil fertilization. Bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses,

38

such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The islands of the Western Indian Ocean are identified as a major

39

biodiversity hotspot, with more than 50 bat species. In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging

40

to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Sey-

41

chelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA pol-

42

ymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence

43

in Mozambican bats (20.5% ± 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% ± 1.5%).

44

Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of α- and β-CoVs and a strong signal of co-

45

evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching,

46

except for bat species sharing day roost sites.

This is the first study to report the presence of coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats in Mayotte,

50

Mozambique and Reunion Island, and in insectivorous bats in Madagascar. Eight percent of the

51

tested bats were positive for CoVs, with higher prevalence in continental Africa than on islands.

52

A high genetic diversity of α- and β-CoVs was found, with strong association between bat host

53

and virus phylogenies, supporting a long history of co-evolution between bats and their associ-

54

ated CoVs in the Western Indian Ocean. These results highlight that strong variation between

55

islands does exist and is associated with the composition of the bat species community on each

56

island. Future studies should investigate whether CoVs detected in these bats have a potential

57

for spillover in other hosts.

Introduction

64

The burden of emerging infectious diseases has significantly increased over the last decades

65

and is recognized as a major global health concern. In 2018, the World Health Organization

66

(WHO) established the “Blueprint priority disease list”, identifying viruses such as Ebola, Lassa

67

fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Nipah fever as significant threats to

68

international biosecurity 1. This list also highlights the potential pandemic risk from the emer-

69

gence of currently unknown zoonotic pathogens, collectively referring to these unknown threats

70

as “disease X” 1. Investigation of the potential zoonotic pathogens in wild animals, particularly

71

vertebrates, is thus critical for emerging infectious disease preparedness and responses.

72

Bats represent nearly 1,400 species and live on all continents except Antarctica 2. They

73

provide key ecosystem services such as crop pest regulation, pollination, seed dispersal, and

74

soil fertilization 3–10. Bats are also recognized as reservoirs of many zoonotic pathogens, includ-

75

ing coronaviruses (CoVs)

76

humans and livestock with sometimes major impacts to public health. For instance, in 2003, the

77

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV emerged in humans, after spillover from bats

78

to civets14–18, and led to the infection of 8,096 people and 774 deaths in less than a year 19.

11–13

. Indeed, several CoVs originating from bats have emerged in

79

Our study area spans geographic locations across the islands of the Western Indian

80

Ocean and southeastern continental Africa (SECA) (Figure 1). These islands have diverse ge-

81

ological origins that have influenced the process of bat colonization and species distributions

82

20

83

On Madagascar, more than 45 bat species are known to occur, of which more than 80 % are

84

endemic to the island 21–23. The smaller studied islands of the Western Indian Ocean, Mauritius,

85

Mayotte, Reunion Island, and Mahé (Seychelles), host reduced bat species diversity (e.g. three

. The ecological settings and species diversity on these islands for bats are notably different.

species on Reunion Island), whereas SECA supports a wide range of bat species. To date, sev-

87

eral studies have identified bat-infecting CoVs in countries of continental Africa, including

88

Zimbabwe 24, South Africa 25,26, Namibia 27, and Kenya 28,29. CoVs have also been reported in

89

fruit bats (Pteropodidae) in Madagascar, where β-coronaviruses belonging to the D-subgroup

90

were identified in Eidolon dupreanum and Pteropus rufus 30.

91

In this study, we investigated the presence of CoVs in over 1,000 individual bats be-

92

longing to 36 species, sampled on five islands (Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Is-

93

land, and Mahé) and one continental area (Mozambique). Based on molecular screening and

94

partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, we (i) estimated CoV preva-

95

lence in the regional bat populations, (ii) assessed CoV genetic diversity, and (iii) identified

96

associations between bat families and CoVs, as well as potential evolutionary drivers leading

97

to these associations.

Results
Prevalence of CoV

101

A total of 1,013 bats were tested from Mozambique, Mayotte, Reunion Island, Sey-

102

chelles, Mauritius and Madagascar (Figure 1). In total, 88 of the 1,013 bat samples tested pos-

103

itive for CoV by Real-Time PCR (mean detection rate: 8.7%). The prevalence of positive bats

104

was different according to the sampling locations (χ² = 77.0, df = 5; p<0.001), with a higher

105

prevalence in Mozambique (± 95% confidence interval: 20.5% ± 4.9%) than on all Western

106

Indian Ocean islands (4.5% ± 1.5%) (Figure 2). A significant difference in the prevalence of

107

positive bats was also detected between families (χ² = 44.8, df = 8; p<0.001; Supplementary

108

Figure S1). The highest prevalence were observed in the families Nycteridae (28.6 % ± 23.6%)

109

and Rhinolophidae (26.2% ± 11.0%). Bat species had a significant effect on the probability of

CoVs detection (χ² = 147.9, df = 39; p<0.001; Supplementary Figure S2). Finally, the preva-

111

lence of CoV positive bats in Mozambique was significantly different (N = 264, χ²= 22.8, df =

RdRp sequence diversity

116

Of the 88 positive samples, we obtained 77 partial RdRp sequences using the Real-Time

117

PCR detection system (179 bp) and 51 longer partial RdRp sequences using a second PCR

118

system (440 bp). Sequences generated with the second system were subsequently used for phy-

119

logenetic analyses. Details of the sequenced CoV-positive samples are provided in Supplemen-

120

tary Table S1. Pairwise comparison of these 51 sequences revealed 28 unique sequences, and

121

sequences similarities ranging from 60.2% to 99.8%. The lowest sequence similarity was found

122

in Mozambique (60.2% to 99.8%), then in Madagascar (64.0% to 99.8%). No genetic variation

123

was observed for samples from Mayotte and Reunion Island.

124
125

Phylogenetic structure of CoVs

126

Sequence comparison indicated that Western Indian Ocean bats harbor a high diversity

127

of both α and β-CoVs, with conserved groups clustering mostly by bat family (Figure 3). Spe-

128

cifically, 25 sequences were identified as α-CoVs, and three sequences were genetically related

129

to the β-CoVs. For α-CoVs, all sequences detected in our tested Molossidae formed a highly

130

supported monophyletic group, including CoV sequences from Molossidae bats previously de-

131

tected in continental Africa (Figure 4). CoVs detected in Mops condylurus (Mozambique), Mor-

132

mopterus francoismoutoui (Reunion Island), Chaerephon pusillus and Chaerephon sp. (Ma-

133

yotte), and Mormopterus jugularis (Madagascar) shared 90% - 98% nucleotide similarity with

135

Miniopteridae clustered in a monophyletic group, including Miniopteridae CoVs sequences

136

from Africa, Asia, and Oceania (Supplementary Table S2). The great majority of α-CoVs de-

137

tected in Rhinolophidae bats clustered in two monophyletic groups (Figure 3); one with African

138

Rhinolophidae CoVs and one with Asian Rhinolophidae CoVs. We also detected one CoV from

139

Rhinolophus rhodesiae, which was 100% similar to a Miniopteridae CoV from this study. Rhi-

140

nonycteridae CoVs formed a single monophyletic group with NL63 Human CoVs. The Rhi-

141

nonycteridae CoVs detected clustered with NL63-related bat sequences found in Triaenops afer

142

in Kenya (Figure 5) and showed 85% similarity to NL63 Human CoVs (Supplementary Table

143

S2). Hipposideridae α-CoVs mainly clustered into a single monophyletic group, including 229E

144

Human CoV-related bat sequence found in Hipposideros vittatus from Kenya (Figure 6; Sup-

145

plementary Table S2).

146

For β-CoVs, two sequences obtained from Nycteris thebaica clustered in the C-sub-

147

group together with other CoVs previously reported in African Nycteris sp. bats (Figure 7). The

148

sequences showed 88% nucleotide identity to a β-C CoV found in Nycteris gambiensis in Ghana

149

(Supplementary Table S2). Rousettus madagascariensis CoVs clustered with Pteropodidae

150

CoVs belonging to the D-subgroup of β-CoVs (Figure 8). BLAST queries against the NCBI

151

database showed 98% nucleotide identity between CoV sequences from Rousettus madagasca-

152

riensis and a β-D CoV sequence detected in Eidolon helvum from Kenya (Supplementary Table

153

Discussion

162

We provide evidence for a high diversity of CoVs in bats on Western Indian Ocean islands.

163

The overall prevalence of CoV positive bats was consistent with studies from continental Africa

164

25

165

the prevalence of infected bats, according to their family, species, sampling location and season.

166

Our study is nevertheless affected by the strong heterogeneity of bat communities in the island

167

of the Western Indian Ocean, in particular in term of species richness. The high CoV genetic

168

diversity detected in bats from Mozambique and Madagascar is likely to be associated with the

169

higher bat species diversity in the African mainland and in Madagascar, has compared to small

170

oceanic islands 20. In addition, CoV prevalence in bat populations may significantly vary across

171

seasons, as found in Mozambique with higher prevalence during the wet season than in the dry

172

season. Several studies on bat CoV have indeed shown significant variations in the temporal

173

infection dynamic of CoV in bats, potentially associated with bat parturition 32–34.

and from islands in the Australasian region 31, although we detected significant variation in

174

Host specificity is well known for some bat CoVs subgenera 35–37. For example, β-C CoVs

175

are largely associated with Vespertilionidae, whereas β-D CoVs are found mostly in Pteropodi-

176

dae 36,38. In our study, we showed that Western Indian Ocean bats harbor phylogenetically struc-

177

tured CoVs, of both α-CoV and β-CoV subclades, clustering mostly by bat family. In the new

178

CoV taxonomy based on full genomes proposed by the International Committee of Taxonomy

179

of Viruses (ICTV), α-CoVs and β-CoVs are split in subgenera mostly based on host families 39,

180

reflected in the subgenera names (e.g. Rhinacovirus for a Rhinolophidae α-CoV cluster, Min-

181

uacovirus for a Miniopteridae α-CoV cluster, Hibecovirus for an Hipposideridae β-CoV clus-

182

ter). Although our classification was based on a partial sequence of the RdRp region, we iden-

183

tified sequences from samples belonging to four of these subgenera (Minuacovirus, Duvina-

184

covirus, Rhinacovirus, and Nobecovirus) and three that could not be classified according to this

185

taxonomic scheme hence representing unclassified subgenera (we propose “Molacovirus”,

186

“Nycbecovirus”, and “Rhinacovirus2”).

187

A strong geographical influence on CoVs diversity, with independent evolution of CoVs on

188

each island, was expected in our study, because of spatial isolation and endemism of the tested

189

bat species. Anthony et al. 38 found that the dominant evolutionary mechanism for African CoVs

190

was host switching. Congruence between host and viral phylogenies however suggests a strong

191

signal for co-evolution between Western Indian Ocean bats and their associated CoVs. Geo-

192

graphical influence seems to occur within bat families, as for Molossidae. Endemism resulting

193

from geographic isolation may thus have played a role in viral diversification within bat fami-

194

lies.

195

Although co-evolution could be the dominant mechanism in the Western Indian Ocean,

196

host-switching may take place in certain situations. For example, in Mozambique, we found a

197

potential Miniopteridae α-CoV in a Rhinolophidae bat co-roosting with Miniopteridae in the

198

same cave. These host-switching events could be favored when several bat species roost in

199

syntopy 40. A similar scenario was described in Australia where Miniopteridae α-CoV was de-

200

tected in Rhinolophidae bats

201

can happen but suggest that viral transmission is not maintained in the receiver host species.

202

The host-virus co-evolution might thus have resulted in strong adaptation of CoVs to each bat

203

host species. In addition, viral factors (mutation rate, recombination propensity, replication abil-

204

ity in the cytoplasm, changes in the ability to bind host cells), environmental factors (climate

31

. These infrequent host-switching events show that spillovers

210

Several bat CoVs we identified in Rhinonycteridae and Hipposideridae from Mozambique

211

had between 85% and 93% nucleotide sequence similarity with NL63 Human CoVs and 229E

212

Human CoVs, respectively. These two human viruses are widely distributed in the world and

213

associated with mild to moderate respiratory infection in humans 45. Tao et al. established that

214

the NL63 Human CoVs and 229E Human CoVs have a zoonotic recombinant origin from their

215

most recent common ancestor, estimated to be about 1,000 years ago 46. During the past decade,

216

they were both detected in bats in Kenya, and in Ghana, Gabon, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, respec-

217

tively

218

knowledge gaps on the transmission routes of bat infectious agents to secondary hosts 49. This

219

hypothesis has been formulated for the 229E Human CoV, with an evolutionary origin in Hip-

220

posideridae bats and with camelids as intermediate hosts 48. The ancient spillover of NL63 from

221

Rhinonycteridae bats to humans might have occurred through a currently unidentified interme-

Knowledge on bat CoV ecology and epidemiology has significantly increased during the

237

past decade. Anthony et al. estimated that there might be at least 3,204 bat CoVs worldwide 38;

238

however, direct bat-to-human transmission has not been demonstrated so far. As for most

239

emerging zoonoses, CoV spillover and emergence may be associated to human activities and

240

ecosystem changes such as habitat fragmentation, agricultural intensification and bushmeat

241

consumption. The role of bats as epidemiological reservoir of infectious agents needs to be

242

balanced with such human driven modifications on ecosystem functioning, in order to properly

assess bat-borne CoV emergence risks.

282

Because of the limited size of sequences generated from the Real-Time PCR, a second

283

PCR targeting 440 bp of the RdRp gene was performed with 5 µL of cDNA of each positive

284

sample, with the following primer set: IN-6: 5’-GGT-TGG-GAC-TAT-CCT-AAG-TGT-GA-

Statistical analysis

295

We have performed Pearson χ² tests on all samples (1,013 bats) to explore the effect of

296

(i) location, (ii) bat family, and (iii) bat species on the detection of coronavirus RNA. Two

297

sampling campaigns, at two different season, in the same location, were available for Mozam-

298

bique. We thus investigated the effect of the sampling season, between the wet (February) and

Phylogenetic analyses

303

Sequences obtained with the second PCR system 60 were edited with the Chromas Lite

304

Software package version 2.6.4 62. We explored CoV diversity of the sequences with pairwise

305

identity values obtained from seqidentity function in R bio3d package v2.3-4 63 and identified

306

the most similar CoV RdRp sequences referenced in GenBank using BLASTN 2.2.29+. An

307

alignment was then generated using the 51 nucleotide sequences obtained in this study and 151

308

reference CoV sequences representing a large diversity of hosts and geographic origins (Eu-

309

rope, Asia, Oceania, America and Africa), with CLC Sequence viewer 8.0 Software (CLC Bio,

310

Aarhus, Denmark). A phylogenetic tree was obtained by maximum likelihood using MEGA

311

Software v10.0.4 64, with 1,000 bootstrap iterations, and with the best evolutionary model for

312

our dataset as selected by modelgenerator v0.85 65.

313

Host-virus associations were investigated using the phylogeny of Western Indian Ocean

314

bats and their associated CoVs. Bat phylogeny was generated from an alignment of 1,030 bp of

315

mitochondrial Cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene sequences (Supplementary Table S4), for each CoV

316

positive bat species. Finally, bat and pruned CoV phylogenies based on each 393 bp RdRp

317

unique sequence fragment were generated by Neighbor-Joining with 1,000 bootstrap iterations,

318

using CLC Sequence viewer 8.0 Software (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark)66. Phylogenetic con-

319

gruence was tested to assess the significance of the coevolutionary signal between bat host

320

species and CoVs sequences, using ParaFit with 999 permutations in the ape package v5.0 in

321

R 3.5.1

322

software v4.01 69.

527

RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase partial nucleotide sequences (393 bp). Colored circles at the

528

end of branches indicate bat family origin. Sequences in bold refer to bat CoVs detected in this

529

study. Bootstrap values >0.7 are indicated on the tree. Scale bar indicates mean number of nu-

530

cleotide substitutions per site. The tree was generated with the General Time Reversible evolu-

531

tionary model (GTR+I+Г, I = 0.18, α = 0.64) and 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
