Abstract

The outbreak of COVID-19 has so far inflicted millions of people all around the world and
will have a long lasting effect on every aspect of everyone’s life. Yet there is no effective
approved treatment for the disease. In an effort of utilizing human ferritin as nanoplatform
for drug delivery, we engineered a fusion protein by presenting receptor-binding motif
(RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 virus spike glycoprotein on the N-terminus of ferritin subunits. The
designed fusion protein with a cage-like structure, similar to that of corona virus, is a
potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We hereby show the construction, preparation, and
characterization of the fusion protein RBM-HFtn. Our initial affinity study confirmed its
biological activity towards ACE2 receptor which suggests its mode of action against SARSCoV-2 could be either through vaccine therapy or blocking the cellular entry of virus as
antagonist of ACE2 receptor.

Introduction
The pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused
tremendous suffering to tens of millions of people around the world. Even though quite a
few clinical studies involving different approaches are undergoing for the treatment of the
disease, there is no effective cure yet up to date. Vaccines therefore is urgently needed for
the preventing further spread of the COVID-19.
The corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, consists of a large RNA genome, four structural
proteins, 16 nonstructural proteins, and some accessory proteins. The four structural
proteins include spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins, of which the spike
glycoprotein is of particular interest for it is a popular vaccine target for corona virus.
Antibodies targeting the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, especially its
receptor-binding domain (RBD), was found to efficiently neutralize virus infection [1, 2].
Antibodies from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 patients however showed limited cross
neutralization, in spite of the high sequence similarity between two viruses [3]. Other
vaccine approaches include the production of live attenuated whole virion vaccines,
inactivated whole virion vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, and mRNA based
vaccines [4].
SARS-CoV-2 was found to enter cells through binding of the host cellular receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its spike glycoprotein soon after its outbreak
in China [3]. Later the cryo-EM revealed the structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexed
with its receptor human ACE2 [5-8]. The S1 subunit of spike glycoprotein undergoes a
hinge-like conformational transition from “down” conformation to “up” conformation before

binding to ACE2 [8]. The receptor-binding motif (RBM, 72 amino acid in total) of spike
glycoprotein in close contact of ACE2 receptor was identified for its sequence between 437
– 508 [9], and this RBM was consistent with the identified S-RBD [8]. This conformational
transition state has become the target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and the
atomic-level understanding of this transitional state and the identification of S-RBM would
facilitate the vaccine design and development against SARS-CoV-2.
Ferritin is a 24-mer protein assembly consisting of heavy chain (21 kD) and light chain
(19 kD). It has a cage-like structure in a way similar to SARS-CoV-2. Because of its unique
structure, ferritin is a promising nanoplatform for antigen presentation and immune
stimulation [10-13]. Its spherical architecture has an outer diameter of 12 nm, suitable for
rapid tissue penetration and draining to lymph node [14]. In this work, we engineered a
human ferritin heavy chain (HFtn) by fusing and presenting the RBM of its spike
glycoprotein as potential vaccine of SARS-CoV-2.

The receptor binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (72 amino acids,
sequence from 439 – 508) was incorporated into the N-terminus of human H-ferritin using
a linker of (GGGGS)3 to form a RBM-HFtn fusion protein. The sequence of RBM peptide,
RBM-HFtn fusion protein, and the DNA sequence (code: XYD-403-000) for optimized
expression in E. Coli is described in Supplementary Methods. The gene synthesis and
plasmid construction was completed by Shanghai Generay Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai,
China) using pET-22b(+) plasmid vector with Amp+ resistance and two enzyme cleavage
sites Nde I and Bam H I (Supplementary Figure S1). The plasmid construction was
confirmed by enzyme cleavage mapping and gene sequencing.

Cloning, expression, and refolding of fusion protein RBM-HFtn
E.coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with pET-22b(+) plasmid containing XYD-403-000
gene, Ampicillin positive single colonies were picked and cultured in LB broth at 37C
overnight. Then, RBM-HFtn fusion protein production was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl-βD-thiogalactoside (IPTG, Inalco, USA), and cells were incubated for an additional 5 h at
25°C. After incubation, the E.coli cells were harvested at 10,000 rpm at 4C for 30 min and
the pellets were resuspended in Tris buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0) and the resuspended
E.coli cells was ruptured at 1000 bar for three times and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C
for 30 min. The target protein (molecular weight 30.4 kD) was found to be in precipitates,
suggesting it exists mainly in the form of inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies of RBM-HFtn
subunits were refolded by first dissolved in 8M urea followed by gradual dialysis with 6, 4,
2, 1, 0.5, 0 M urea and 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer with 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. The refolded
protein solution was centrifuged at 5,000 g at 4C for 30 min and supernatant was collected.

Purification of fusion proteins
The refolding solution was concentrated and buffer exchanged to 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 8.0) with a Millipore lab scale tangential flow filter (TFF) system. After buffer exchange,
RBM-HFtn was found to have a typical soluble ferritin structure. The fusion protein with its
right space structure was further purified by using anion exchange chromatography (flow
through mode), followed with a size-exclusion chromatography to remove aggregates and
other low molecule impurities.

Characterization of fusion protein RBM-HFtn
The physico-chemical properties of fusion RBM-HFtn were analyzed by SEC-HPLC
（Agilent 1260 Infinity II HPLC system, column Agilent AdvancedBio SEC 300Å 2.7 m 7.8
x 300mm） with mobile phase 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) at flow rate 0.5 mL/min and
detection wavelength 280 nm. Hydrodynamic size analysis by Nano ZSE Nanosizer
(Malvern, UK) using automatic mode with material as protein and dispersant as 50 mM Tris
buffer (pH 8.0). The morphology and size of fusion protein was further analyzed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (FEI Tecnai Spirit (100KV)) after staining with 2%
uranyl acetate.

Binding affinity analysis by ELISA
The binding affinity of RBM-HFtn towards ACE2 receptor was analyzed with indirect ELISA.
Briefly, varied concentrations of RBM-HFtn fusion protein and S-RBD (positive control) in
100 L coating buffer were coated onto MaxiSorp plate (CORN) by incubation at 4C
overnight. After blocking with 5% BSA, ACE2 protein (concentration 0.5 μg/ml) was allowed

to bind to the surface coated proteins for 2 h at 37C, followed by washing with washing
buffer three times. Anti-ACE2 antibody (dilution 1:1000) was incubated for 1.5 hours at
37C followed by washing for three times. Secondary antibody/HRP (1:5000 dilution) in 5%
BSA was incubated 37C for 0.5 h followed by washing for three times. The TMB substrate
was added and incubated for 30 min, and then the absorbance was read at 650 nm
wavelength.

Results and discussion
Construction of RBM-HFtn
Ferritin heavy chain protein has found many biological applications in nanomedicines and
molecular diagnostics [15-17]. Lately, a few constructs based on ferritin have been
developed as antivirus and anticancer vaccines [10, 11, 13]. Because ferritin heavy chain
protein is derived from a natural occurring protein in human, itself has low immunogenicity.
Its 24-mer assembly cage-like structure has four different symmetries, six 4-fold axes, eight
3-fold axes, twelve 2-fold axes, and twenty-four C3–C4 interfaces. By presenting a fusion
protein at the 3-fold axes, ferritin was able to display eight trimers of fused protein, resulting
in enhanced immunogenicity of protein on display [18]. In this work we engineered a human
ferritin heavy chain fused with the RBM of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 at its Nterminus with (GGGGS)3 short peptide linker (Figure 1A). We chose a short polypeptide
sequence (72 amino acid) of spike glycoprotein RBM (S-RBM) based on latest 3-D cryoEM studies of spike glycoprotein-ACE2 complex [8, 9]. Because this sequence doesn’t
appear to have a stable 3-D structure, we engineered it at the N-terminus, so that the fused

S-RBM subunits are distant from each other and won’t affect the formation 24-mer
assembly. For the same reason, we chose a minimal size of RBD so that it is properly
displayed on the surface of ferritin. In spite of those considerations, the RBM-HFtn fusion
protein was found mainly in the inclusion bodies, instead of in soluble form.
Hypothetically, the designed RBM-HFtn fusion protein may involve in two different
pathways against virus infection. First and most importantly, the RBM-HFtn may act as
vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and antibodies responsive to spike glycoprotein RBM may
subsequently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, followed by removal of virus by immune system
(Figure 1B, upper pathway). Two antibodies found in COVID-19 patients were shown to
block the binding between virus S-protein RBD and cellular receptor ACE2 [19]. Their
therapeutic effect was validated in mouse model by reducing virus titer in infected lungs
[19]. Those findings supported our hypothesis that by properly presenting S-protein
RBD/RBM, the designed RBM-HFtn has great potential as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,
thus inducing the production of antivirus antibodies. The second pathway, more obvious
and direct, is to block the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 by preoccupy the ACE2 receptor
with RBM-HFtn and suppress the virus proliferation (Figure 1B, lower pathway). The first
pathway is more effective for prevention of virus infection. The second pathway is valuable
for treatment after virus infection as antagonist of ACE2 receptor.

Preparation, purification and characterization of RBM-HFtn
The expressed RBM-HFtn was found in the form of inclusion bodies in the bacteria lysis
precipitates (Supplementary Figure S2) with apparent molecular weight of 30 kD which is

consistent with the size of RBM-HFtn subunits. The protein was properly refolded and
reassembled to 24-mer protein by gradual dialysis in urea buffers of decreased
concentration, and finally in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer with 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. The refolded
protein was sequentially purified with a Millipore lab scale tangential flow filter (TFF) system,

chromatography to remove host cell protein, host cell DNA, endotoxin, protein aggregates
and other low molecule impurities. The purified RBM-HFtn was found have a high purity
98% as evaluated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Figure 2.) It has slightly
increased hydrodynamic size of 15.0  0.6 nm measured by Nanosizer in comparison with
the known size of HFtn,12 nm (Figure 2B). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed
the size of RBM-HFtn fusion protein in the range of 14-16 nm with almost uniform
morphology of round shape (Figure 2C). The SEC, Nanosizer, and TEM results confirmed
the successful construct of the RBM-HFtn.

Binding affinity towards ACE2 by indirect ELISA
RBD of Spike glycoprotein (mFc tag) and RBM-HFtn of varied concentration in 100 L was
incubated in MaxiSorp plate and ACE2 was allowed to bind to the surface coated proteins.
Their binding was detected by ACE2 antibody followed by its secondary antibody. In this
indirect ELISA, the maximum binding intensity correlates with the binding site on surface.
As indicated by the results in Figure 3, S-RBD showed higher plateau than RBM-HFtn,
suggesting more binding sites are available in S-RBD coated wells than in RBM-HFtn
coated wells. The EC50s of the binding between ACE2 and S-RBD, RBM-HFtn were

estimated to be 60.66 nM and 23.36 nM respectively. Apparently RBM-HFtn has higher
binding affinity than S-protein in binding to their same ACE2 receptor. The apparent higher
binding affinity may attribute to the cage-like structure of RBM-HFtn, which presents
multiple copies (24 copies) of RBM on the surface. This result suggested that the RBM is
properly presented on surface of heavy chain human ferritin and is recognizable by the
ACE2 receptor. Its potential as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and as antagonist of ACE2 receptor
is being further studied in animal experiments.

Conclusions
The receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2, a 72-amino acid polypeptide, was fused
with N-terminus of human heavy chain ferritin (HFtn) through a proper linker. The
constructed RBM-HFtn was found in inclusion bodies of bacterial lysis and was able to
refold by gradual dialysis. The purified RBM-HFtn was found to be in good purity, expected
size and morphology. Its biological activity towards ACE2 receptor was confirmed by ELISA
and the fusion protein RBM-HFtn bodes well as potential vaccine and therapeutics against
SARS-CoV-2 as ACE2 receptor antagonist.
