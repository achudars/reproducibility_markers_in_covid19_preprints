Summary

13

Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genome in nature, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes

14

sophisticated replication/transcription complexes (RTCs), mainly composed of a

15

network of nonstructural proteins and nucleocapsid protein, to establish efficient

16

infection. Here, we developed an innovative interaction screening strategy based on

17

phase separation in cellulo, namely compartmentalization of protein-protein interactions

18

in cells (CoPIC). Utilizing CoPIC screening, we mapped the interaction network among

19

RTC-related viral proteins. We identified a total of 47 binary interactions among 14

20

proteins

21

coronaviruses. Further exploration via CoPIC led to the discovery of extensive ternary

22

complexes composed of these components, which infer potential higher-order

23

complexes. Taken together, our results present an efficient, and robust interaction

24

screening strategy, and indicate the existence of a complex interaction network among

25

RTC-related factors, thus opening up new opportunities to understand SARS-CoV-2

26

biology and develop therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.

Introduction

31

The current pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019), a respiratory disease

32

leading to more than 55 million confirmed cases and 1.3 million fatalities globally (WHO,

33

2020), is caused by SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA

34

betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae (Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 possesses

35

a remarkably large RNA genome, with a genome size of approximately 30-kb, flanked

36

by 5' and 3' untranslated regions. The genomic RNA at the 5' end features the partly

37

overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1ab, that occupy two-thirds of the

38

capped and polyadenylated genome (Lu et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2005). The expression

39

of ORF 1ab requires a ribosomal frameshift near the end of ORF1a. In this manner,

40

SARS-CoV-2 genome translation yields the large replicase polyproteins pp1a and

41

pp1ab (Abduljalil and Abduljalil, 2020; Perlman and Netland, 2009). Pp1a and pp1ab go

42

through extensive autoproteolytic processing, mediated by two ORF1a-encoded

43

proteases and ultimately generating 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsps), which make up

44

the primary constituents of the replication/transcription complexes (RTCs). These

45

include a variety of key enzymes functioning for viral RNA synthesis, i.e. the primase-

46

Nsp8 (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019; Konkolova et al., 2020); the RdRp-Nsp12 (Cheng

47

et al., 2005; Shannon et al., 2020); the helicase-Nsp13 (Jang et al., 2020; Lee et al.,

48

2010); the exoribonuclease-Nsp14 (Minskaia et al., 2006) and the endoribonuclease

49

NendoU-Nsp15 (Bhardwaj et al., 2004); several multi-spanning membrane proteins

50

(Nsp3, Nsp4 and Nsp6) that presumably contribute to the formation of double-

51

membrane vesicles (DMVs) (Cottam et al., 2011; Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007; Oostra

52

et al., 2007); proteases for polyprotein cleavage (Nsp5) (Stobart et al., 2013), and the

53

accessory modulating factors hijacking host defense (Nsp1 and Nsp2) (Antonin et al.,

54

2020; Cornillez-Ty et al., 2009). For the 3' one-third of the genome, ORFs that encode

55

four structural proteins and nine accessory proteins are transcribed to form a nested set

56

of subgenomic mRNAs (Abduljalil and Abduljalil, 2020).

57

The synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within host cells depends on the efficient and

58

correct assembly of RTCs under the coordinated cascade of transcription and

59

replication. This process takes place in intracellular DMVs (Klein et al., 2020; Snijder et

60

al., 2020), which are actually remodeled to serve as a platform for protein-protein

61

interactions (PPIs) and provide a favorable environment for replication. Although SARS-

62

CoV-2 Nsps (e.g., Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp12, and Nsp13) are associated with the viral RTCs

63

during infection (Yan et al., 2020b), the molecular details of which Nsps and how they

64

come together to form the viral RTCs are not clear. Notably, it is also reported that

65

nucleocapsid (N) protein functions as the only structural protein shuttling inside/outside

66

RTCs and facilitating the transcription and replication of coronavirus RNA (Cong et al.,

67

2020; Surjit and Lal, 2008). Recently released structural information revealed the

68

interaction of the C-terminal domain of N protein with the pore factor of DMVs (Khan et

69

al., 2020). As a critical step toward understanding this process, it is necessary to

70

investigate the interaction network among Nsps. Information to date in this regard has

71

been scarce, with only a limited number of interactions identified (Pan et al., 2008; von

72

Brunn et al., 2007).

73

Although multiple methods have been developed to detect PPIs, few are suited for high

74

throughput protein interaction analysis in cells. The most commonly used methods for

75

investigating PPIs of viruses including coronaviruses (He et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2008;

76

von Brunn et al., 2007), yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening and coimmunoprecipitation

77

(co-IP), have their own limitations and both suffer severe false-positive and false-

78

negative results (Berggård et al., 2007; Miernyk and Thelen, 2008; Phizicky and Fields,

79

1995). In addition, co-IP is unfriendly to large-scale screening. To alleviate these

80

drawbacks, here we developed a novel method to study PPIs in living cells, namely

81

Compartmentalization of Protein-protein Interactions in Cells (CoPIC). Essentially,

82

CoPIC is the adapted version of a phase separation-based method for PPIs in vitro in

83

our previous study, called Phase-separated Condensate-aided Enrichment of

84

Biomolecular Interactions in Test tubes (CEBIT) (Zhou et al., 2020). One major

85

requirement for CEBIT is the availability of large quantities of well-behaved purified

86

materials, which is difficult to achieve for intrinsically ill-behaved subjects such as large

87

dynamic protein complexes. Correspondingly in CoPIC, one interaction partner is fused

88

with the scaffolds that drive the formation of phase-separated condensates, and the

89

other partner (named the client) is fused with a fluorescent protein, and can be recruited

90

to the condensate via specific interactions in cells. Overall, CoPIC emerges as a simple,

91

sensitive, and efficient method to investigate PPI in mammalian cells.

92

To elucidate molecular mechanisms of viral replication and transcription, there is a need

93

to systematically examine possible intraviral interactions. Although relatively unexplored

94

among the virological studies, intraviral interactions have significant and unexpected

95

effects on host range, transmissibility, immunopathology, and therapeutic effectiveness

96

(Dao et al., 2020; Häuser et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2019). We, therefore,

97

established an interaction map for RTC-related viral proteins by CoPIC matrix screening

98

and identified a total of 47 binary interactions among 14 proteins governing replication,

99

discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses. Moreover, comprehensive

100

high-order complexes within the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were also comprehensively

101

deduced. Overall, increased awareness of intraviral interactions as described here is a

102

necessary step for achieving a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and thus providing

103

more novel and effective therapeutic opportunities.

104

Results

105

Establishment of robust scaffolds for phase separation in cells

106

The design strategy of CoPIC is as follows: i) a system (called scaffold) capable of

107

forming membraneless phase-separated compartments in cells is generated; ii) one

108

component of the PPI of interest (POI) is fused with the scaffold and hence is enriched

109

in the compartments; and iii) the recruitment of another one component (called client)

110

into the compartments serves as the readout for the interaction (Figure 1A). For

111

simplicity, we chose phase separation-prone low complexity domains (LCDs) as

112

potential scaffolds to form the compartmental hubs for interactions (Malinovska et al.,

113

2013; Wang et al., 2018; Weber and Brangwynne, 2012). To this end, we generated a

114

series of expression vectors with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with a number

115

of LCD candidates (Figure 1B), derived from Nup98 (Schmidt and Görlich, 2015), FIB1

116

(Berry et al., 2015), hnRNPDL (Batlle et al., 2020), RBM14 (Hennig et al., 2015), TAF15

117

(Couthouis et al., 2011), TDP-43 (Saini and Chauhan, 2011), CPEB2N (Kato et al.,

118

2012), and hnRNPH1 (Wang et al., 2018). In addition, several optimized LCD

119

combinations were also designed, including Hfq-GFP-FUSN, in which the weak

120

multivalent interactions of FUSN to phase separate are enhanced by the homo-hexamer

121

of Hfq (Murakami et al., 2015; Someya et al., 2012), and DDX4GFP, of which the

122

DEAD-box helicase domain within DDX4 was replaced by GFP as previously described

123

with modifications (Nott et al., 2015).

124

As shown by the fluorescent images in Figures 1C and S1A-S1G, GFP-Nup98N,

125

DDX4GFP or Hfq-GFP-FUSN formed green micron-scale membraneless spherical

126

compartments while others exhibited poor performance of either irregularly shaped

127

condensates or few condensates. Further analyses indicated higher sphericity of

128

compartments of GFP-Nup98N and Hfq-GFP-FUSN (Figure S1H) while there was a

129

higher proportion of spherical compartments in DDX4GFP (Figure 1E). All

130

compartments formed by GFP-Nup98N, DDX4GFP or Hfq-GFP-FUSN showed fluidity

131

when examined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays (Figures

132

S1A-S1G). Collectively, we chose GFP-Nup98N, DDX4GFP and Hfq-GFP-FUSN as

133

potential protein scaffolds of CoPIC for further investigation.

134

Nup98N condensates compartmentalize client PPI-mediated recruitment

135

To investigate whether the aforementioned scaffold-derived compartments support

136

client PPI-mediated recruitment, we chose a well-known PPI pair, MDM2/p53 (Momand

137

et al., 1992), as an example for the test. Firstly, we fused MDM2 to the C-terminus of

138

GFP-Nup98N, DDX4GFP, or Hfq-GFP-FUSN, yielding the scaffolding vectors, GFP-

139

Nup98N-MDM2, DDX4GFP-MDM2, or Hfq-GFP-FUSN-MDM2, respectively. Among the

140

constructs,

141

compartments upon overexpression in HEK293 cells (Figure 1F) while DDX4GFP-

142

MDM2 failed to form dynamic phase-separated compartments (Figure S1I). When

143

GFP-Nup98N-MDM2 was co-expressed with the transactivation helix of p53 (15-29 aa,

144

abbreviated to p53 hereafter) labeled with mCherry (mCherry-p53) in cells, the mCherry

145

red fluorescence signal was enriched within the green compartments (Figures 1D, 1E).

146

Moreover, the enrichment is MDM2-dependent as mCherry-p53 was not recruited into

GFP-Nup98N-MDM2

and

Hfq-GFP-FUSN-MDM2

formed

robust

147

GFP-Nup98N-derived compartments (Figures 1F, 1G). Similar results were obtained

148

for Hfq-GFP-FUSN-MDM2 and mCherry-p53 (Figures S1J, S1K).

149

To further confirm that the enrichment of red fluorescence signal was due to the

150

cognate interaction between MDM2 and p53, we treated the cells co-expressing GFP-

151

Nup98N-MDM2 and mCherry-p53 with Mi-773, a potent inhibitor specifically targeting

152

the MDM2/p53 interaction (Wang et al., 2014). Upon treatment with Mi-773, the

153

mCherry signal within the puncta immediately started to decrease and little remained by

154

46 seconds post-treatment (Figure 1H). Correspondingly, the ratio between the

155

intensity of mCherry over that of GFP and Pearson’s correlation coefficient also

156

decreased (Figures 1I, S1L). Notably, the rapid response to Mi-773 suggests the

157

potential application of CoPIC in high-throughput screening of specific inhibitors for PPI,

158

where the effectiveness of inhibitors is evaluated by the recruitment of clients into the

159

compartments or not. Taken together, our results indicate that GFP-Nup98N can yield

160

robust compartments for recruitment-based PPI detection in cells and thus works as the

161

scaffold for engineered membraneless compartments used in CoPIC for subsequent

162

studies.

163

Assessment of direct and indirect interactions within the PRC2 complex using

164

CoPIC

165

One of the most challenging obstacles in characterizing PPIs is to distinguish between

166

direct and indirect interactions. Next, we evaluated whether CoPIC can fulfill the task of

167

discriminating direct or indirect interactions. To this end, we used the well-studied

168

polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) as the testing example. PRC2 is comprised of

169

four core subunits including enhancer of zeste 1 or 2 (EZH1/2), embryonic ectoderm

170

development (EED), suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), and retinoblastoma-binding

171

protein 4 or 7 (RBBP4/7) (Figure S2A) (Margueron and Reinberg, 2011). We generated

172

vectors expressing all PRC2 core components fused with mCherry- or GFP-Nup98N.

173

Based on extensive biochemical and structural studies in the literature, it is known that

174

RBBP4/7 directly interacts with SUZ12 but not with EZH2 (Glancy et al., 2020; Tan et

175

al., 2014). We performed binary co-expression experiments to assess the interaction

176

relationship of these components using CoPIC. Consistently, the co-expression of

177

mCherry-RBBP4 with GFP-Nup98N-SUZ12, but not that of miRFP-RBBP7 with GFP-

178

Nup98N-EZH2, resulted in client enrichment in the compartments (Figures 2A, 2B, 2C

179

and 2D).

180

Further pairwise interactions between all components of PRC2 were conducted. The

181

results were consistent with the previous studies, where the interactions between EED

182

and EZH1/2, between EZH1/2 and SUZ12, and between SUZ12 and RBBP4/7 were

183

direct and all other interactions were indirect (Figure 2E). As a key component of

184

PRC2, SUZ12 is reported to adopt an extended conformation with the C-terminus

185

binding EZH2 and the N-terminus binding RBBP4/7 and two accessory proteins, PHF1

186

and AEBP2 (Figures 2F, 2G). Subsequent CoPIC assays utilizing the C-terminal part of

187

SUZ12, SUZ12C, showed that only EZH2, but not RBBP7, PHF1, or AEBP2, was

188

enriched in the GFP-Nup98N-SUZ12C compartments (Figure S2B). On the contrary,

189

CoPIC assays utilizing the full-length SUZ12 showed substantial enrichment of the

190

signals of RBBP7, PHF1, or AEBP2 within the compartments of GFP-Nup98N-SUZ12

191

(Figure S2B).

192

Because we demonstrated that CoPIC can robustly detect direct PPIs, we conducted

193

further investigation into the indirect PPIs within the PRC2 complex. Among the mutual

194

interactions of PRC2 complex components, there are two distinctive interaction

195

patterns: (i) direct contact of RBBP4/7 with SUZ12 mediates the indirect interaction of

196

RBBP4/7 with EZH2; and (ii) the interaction of SUZ12 with EED requires the

197

involvement of EZH2 (Ciferri et al., 2012; Kasinath et al., 2018). Next, we sought to

198

characterize the typical indirect interactions via CoPIC and introduced a ternary co-

199

expression system expressing the GFP-Nup98N-EZH2, miRFP-RBBP7, and mCherry-

200

SUZ12. Both miRFP and mCherry signals were enriched and colocalized within the

201

compartments of GFP-Nup98N-EZH2, indicating the bridging role of SUZ12 in recruiting

202

RBBP7 into EZH2-containing compartments (Figures 2H, 2I). On the contrary, the

203

colocalization and enrichment were not observed with co-expression of mCherry-

204

SUZ12C (Figures 2J, 2K). Similar results of CoPIC also verified the indirect interaction

205

of SUZ12 with EED via EZH2 (Figure S2C). Taken together, these data indicate that

206

indirect interactions can be unambiguously demonstrated by combining binary and

207

ternary co-transfection experiments via CoPIC.

208

CoPIC screening of direct PPIs among SARS-CoV-2 RTC-related viral proteins

209

Taking advantage of the established CoPIC system, we screened PPIs among SARS-

210

CoV-2 RTC-related viral proteins. The genes encoding selected viral proteins (Table

211

S1; Figure S3A) were cloned into the expression vectors fused with fluorescent protein

212

tags such as mCherry, BFP, or GFP-Nup98N. Considering the unique properties of

213

Nsp4 and Nsp6 as transmembrane proteins and the difficulty to synthesize Nsp3, these

214

three nonstructural proteins were not included in our analysis. First, the expression and

215

subcellular localization of these proteins was examined in Vero E6 cells, a cell line

216

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro (A et al., 2020). Confocal imaging was

217

carried out to detect the individual proteins at 24 hours post-transfection (p.t.). With

218

adequate protein levels expressed in Vero E6 cells, representative images of cellular

219

localization were taken with a confocal microscope. As shown in Figure S3B, most

220

Nsps except Nsp1 and Nsp2 were localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

221

After verifying the proper expression of selected viral proteins, CoPIC screening was

222

conducted for pairwise interactions between all combinations of the 14 proteins. Among

223

the 196 protein pairs tested, a total of 47 interaction combinations were identified as

224

positive and summarized in a pairwise matrix (Figure 3A). In total, 26 interactions

225

showed one directionality, implying a possible influence of fusion domains on the

226

interactions. Nevertheless, 14 pairs of interactions were detected in both directions. In

227

addition, self-interactions were observed for Nsp5, Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp13, Nsp16,

228

and N protein, suggesting that these proteins could form dimeric or multimeric

229

complexes by interacting with themselves. However, CoPIC failed to detect the

230

previously reported self-interactions for Nsp10 and Nsp15 (Ricagno et al., 2006; Su et

231

al., 2006), a failure that could be due to an adverse effect of partner fusion on the self-

232

interaction. Together, the SARS-CoV-2 RTC-related viral factors interactome-based

233

CoPIC screening suggests concentrated interactions of open reading frame 1b

234

(ORF1b)-encoded Nsps that were mainly connected by the Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp14,

235

Nsp15, and Nsp16 (Figure 3B, 3C). The second-most-connected proteins were Nsp5,

236

Nsp7, Nsp8, and Nsp10 whereas none were identified for Nsp1 and Nsp2 (Figure 3B,

237

3C).

238

Although employing a similar expression strategy for replication, 32 novel interaction

239

pairs in SARS-CoV-2 were identified in addition to 15 overlapped hits shared by SARS-

240

CoV (Figure 4A). Among the newly discovered interaction combination in our study, co-

241

expression of mCherry-Nsp9 and GFP-Nup98N-Nsp5 showed the enrichment of client

242

proteins into the compartments and strong colocalization (Figures 4F, 4G) compared

243

with the negative group (Nsp8-Nsp5) (Figures 4B, 4C and 4D). The overlapped

244

positive pairs in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, i.e. Nsp5-Nsp12 and Nsp9-Nsp9, were

245

also well characterized via CoPIC analyses, implying the possible critical roles for

246

maintaining fundamental functions in the coronavirus family (Figures 4D, 4E, 4H and

247

4I). More positive pairwise interactions are exhibited in Figures S4A-S4C.

248

A series of coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed to validate the selected

249

candidates. Briefly, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with two expression plasmids

250

fused with mCherry or GFP tag. At 48 h p.t., cells were lysed and proteins were

251

immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (mAb). The expression of

252

both tagged proteins was confirmed by western blotting using respective antibodies. As

253

demonstrated in Figure 4J-4M, one of the positive candidate pairs could be

254

immunoprecipitated with another in co-expression samples but not mCherry/GFP-

255

tagged control alone expression samples, further verifying the specific interactions

256

among the above combinations. More pairwise interactions validated by co-IP are

257

exhibited in Figure S4D.

258

Characterization of in-depth interactions within SARS-CoV-2

259

To fulfill a variety of critical functions during the viral life cycle, viral proteins tend to form

260

binary, ternary or larger complexes with different combinations. Considering the fact that

261

more than half of the interaction pairs turned out to be negative, we speculated that

262

there might be extensive indirect interactions. The corresponding interaction patterns

263

could be discerned, and the detailed strategy of selection is as follows: for virus-

264

encoded proteins A, B, and C, (i) A interacts with both B and C while B does not interact

265

with C; if B could interact with C via A is involved, A, B and C are capable of forming a

266

ternary complex (Figure 5A, 5B). Moreover, a large proportion of pairwise interactions

267

with each other within multimeric complexes should also be mentioned (Figure 5A, 5C).

268

Based on the above strategy, we designed the potential combinations and further

269

investigated the detailed patterns of interactions. Among 137 potential protein

270

combinations tested in our study, 28 positive pairs were eventually identified (Figure 5;

271

S5). Taking the key pairs of Nsp7-Nsp8 as an example, there are recently published

272

reports of structural analyses underlying the association of this combination with other

273

Nsps including Nsp12, Nsp9, and Nsp13 (Gao et al., 2020a; Hillen et al., 2020; Wang et

274

al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020b). However, these interactions were mainly characterized by

275

using in vitro assays and have not been tested within mammalian cells. Herein, we

276

performed CoPIC assays combined with co-IP, and further support the existence of

277

high-order complexes. As shown in Figure S6, a combination of CoPIC and co-IP

278

analyses showed a validated direct interaction between Nsp8 and Nsp12, Nsp7 and

279

Nsp8, Nsp7 and Nsp12, thus assembling into the core complex of RTC to facilitate

280

efficient replication. A novel ternary complex based on primase (Nsp8) and

281

methyltransferase (Nsp16) was identified for the first time, whose formation was

282

dependent on the involvement of Nsp7 (Figures 6A, 6B). The contrary results were

283

shown in the combination of Nsp1-N-Nsp13, in which Nsp13 failed to mediate the

284

indirect interaction between Nsp10 and N (Figure 6C). Collectively, extensive high-

285

order complexes within SARS-CoV-2 were newly identified via the unique advantage of

286

the CoPIC system, providing clues for further functional studies.

287

Analysis of the interaction hub concentrated on Nsp12-Nsp16

288

It is well known that ORF1ab of coronavirus is translated upon ribosomal frameshift

289

inside ORF1a, implying significantly lower levels in producing Nsp12-Nsp16 than

290

ORF1a-encoded products. Even so, Nsp12-Nsp16 are thought to serve as a platform to

291

recruit their cofactors (Nsp7-Nsp10) to the central RTC, thus ensuring efficient

292

replication and transcription. Consistent with this idea, the CoPIC screening

293

demonstrated the concentrated interactions of Nsp12-Nsp16 with their partners

294

(Figures 3, 4, 5), suggesting the potential roles of intraviral interactions in the

295

sophisticated regulation of enzyme activities.

296

Taking the canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as an example, Nsp12 exhibits

297

poorly processive RNA synthesis in vitro, contrasting with the efficient replication of

298

coronavirus RNA genomes with a large size in vivo (Ahn et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2005;

299

Te Velthuis et al., 2010). However, the involvement of the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex can

300

increase the binding of Nsp12 to RNA, thus activating and conferring the processivity of

301

Nsp12 to the RNA synthesis (Subissi et al., 2014). The Nsp7/Nsp8 complex increases

302

the binding of Nsp12 to RNA, resulting in a larger stretch of nucleotide synthesized per

303

binding event. Nsp8 works as RNA primase and Nsp7 might act to stabilize Nsp8 (Gao

304

et al., 2020b; Imbert et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2020a; Zhai et al., 2005). Correspondingly,

305

our CoPIC analysis combined with co-IP confirmed direct interactions between Nsp12

306

and Nsp7/8 (Figure S6), consistent with the newly revealed atomic structure (Hillen et

307

al., 2020).

308

For another presumed RTC catalytic core, Nsp13 helicase activity is also stimulated

309

significantly in the presence of Nsp12 by a direct interaction identified both in SARS-

310

CoV (Adedeji et al., 2012) and our study (Figure 3; S4). Cryo-electron microscopy

311

observation revealed a novel architecture of SARS-CoV-2 mini RTCs assembled by the

312

dynamic interactions of Nsp13 with RdRp complex (Yan et al., 2020b), whose

313

reconstruction in vitro was also partially verified by the CoPIC analyses in the

314

mammalian cells (Figure 6; S5). Likewise, in vitro studies showed that the extra

315

addition of the Nsp10 protein enhances the weak Nsp14 ExoN activity (Baddock et al.,

316

2020; Bouvet et al., 2012). In the case of Nsp16, a strong interaction of Nsp16 with

317

Nsp10 was shown to trigger its 2'-O-MTase activity (Bouvet et al., 2010; Imbert et al.,

318

2008; Lin et al., 2020; Mahalapbutr et al., 2020). The direct interactions of both Nsp10-

319

Nsp14 and Nsp10-Nsp16 were also validated by CoPIC (Figure 3; S4), implying the

320

importance of Nsp10 in two distinct regulatory mechanisms (Nsp14-ExoN and Nsp16-2'-

321

O-MTase). Moreover, the CoPIC screening identified for the first time the novel

322

interactions between Nsp14 and Nsp16 (Figure 3; S4). There might be a tertiary

323

complex of Nsp14-Nsp10-Nsp16, in which Nsp10-dependent activation of both enzymes

324

may happen simultaneously. Nevertheless, more evidence would be required to confirm

325

the non-limiting levels of Nsp10 to simultaneously activate the enzyme activities of

326

Nsp14 and Nsp16.

327

Combined with the newly identified interaction of Nsp12 with Nsp14, an N7-MTase that

328

can methylate the first G of viral RNA (Ferron et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2015; Yan et al.,

329

2020a), we surmise that Nsp7/Nsp8/Nsp12/Nsp13/Nsp14 might tend to constitute a

330

higher-order complex as the minimal viral replisome. If so, such assembly would be in

331

charge of more capping activities, i.e., RTPase and N7-MTase, as well as unwinding of

332

RNA secondary structures, RNA polymerization and even mismatch excision by the 3'-

333

to-5' exoribonuclease activity of Nsp10-Nsp14. Under the last capping step, the

334

Nsp10/Nsp16 complex would undergo methylation of cap-0 to cap-1 through its 2'-O-

335

MTase activity (Krafcikova et al., 2020; Rosas-Lemus et al., 2020), and might act

336

periodically during Nsp7/Nsp8/Nsp12/Nsp13/Nsp14-mediated replication. Collectively,

337

our interactome studies confirmed the significance and necessity of the key enzymes

338

encoded by replicase ORF1b forming high-order complexes with the cofactors for

339

efficient replication and transcription during the viral life cycle.

340

Exploration of potential higher-order complexes

341

Based on the screening by CoPIC, we constructed a comprehensive high-order

342

interactome for SARS-CoV-2 RTC-related viral proteins (Figure 3). The resulting map

343

reveals a focus on ORF1b-centered interactions that are mainly connected by Nsp12,

344

Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, and Nsp16, with associated enzymatic activities that are

345

essential for viral RNA replication and protein translation. Further extensive interactions

346

combined with the corresponding high-order complexes imply a crucial role for Nsps in

347

recruiting core replication/transcription proteins for the assembly of SARS-CoV-2 RTC

348

and thus performing diverse functions during the viral life cycle. Integrated analyses of

349

tertiary complexes identified by CoPIC revealed the various possibilities to trigger

350

indirect interactions (Figure 6). Examples include the indirect interaction of Nsp7 with

351

Nsp9 dependent on the involvement of intermediates including Nsp8, Nsp12, Nsp13, or

352

Nsp16.

353

Since the coronavirus RTCs engage in a variety of RNA synthesis processes, one type

354

of complex may be converted into another by the binding or release of specific protein

355

partners. In this manner, such protein factors may either regulate the balance between

356

different processes or directly form more sophisticated complexes with the core

357

enzymes. Correspondingly, we derived several potential higher-order complexes

358

comprising direct and indirect interactions. For example, the tandem mode of Nsp8-

359

Nsp9-Nsp14-N illustrates the cascaded linkage of indirect interactions Nsp8-Nsp9-

360

Nsp14 and Nsp9-Nsp14-Nsp10, in which Nsp7 and N bind to the different interfaces of

361

the core Nsp8-Nsp9 and share no any contacts (Figure 7A). Multiple pairs of indirect

362

interactions shared by the same intermediates result in a Y-shaped mode of Nsp8-

363

Nsp10-Nsp13-N (Figure 7B), which emphasizes the mutual linkages of binding factors

364

with intermediates in different interfaces with no interactive events between themselves

365

(Figure 7B). On the contrary, a quinary tandem combination of Nsp7-Nsp8-Nsp9-

366

Nsp14-Nsp10 comprising different intermediates was identified, exhibiting the

367

successive chain (Nsp7-Nsp8-Nsp9, Nsp8-Nsp9-Nsp14, Nsp9-Nsp14-Nsp10) without

368

forming a closed loop by end-to-end interaction (Figure 7C). More detailed high-order

369

complexes are shown in Figure S7.

370

The above high-order complexes based on CoPIC also exhibit good potential

371

applications in the high-throughput screening for inhibitors against PPIs (Figure 7D).

372

Simply put, the core intermediate (D) fused with the scaffold acts as the platform to

373

recruit other client components (i.e., A to C) by different interfaces and thus form the

374

high-order complex. The subsequent screening for effective inhibitors disrupting the

375

pairwise interactions would be performed in combination with an imaging-based

376

method, and the activity of each candidate would be determined by assessing the

377

enrichment of a fluorophore-labeled client into condensates enriched with its binding

378

partner. Taken together, these simplified model systems enable more precise clues for

379

the formation of high-order complexes during the different stages of the viral life cycle

380

and potential therapeutic opportunities against SARS-CoV-2 by repurposing specific

381

inhibitors to disrupt the intraviral PPIs.

382

Discussion

383

With burgeoning knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 molecular architectures, it is essential

384

to dissect the nonstructural protein interaction network and thus understand the

385

assembly of RTCs. In this regard, our study established an innovative interaction

386

screening strategy based on phase separation in cellulo, that is, compartmentalization

387

of protein-protein interactions in cells (CoPIC). Since CoPIC detects the enrichment of

388

client proteins in membraneless compartments versus the surrounding environment,

389

discernible enrichment means the establishment of a concentration gradient. Therefore,

390

only authentic interactions can overcome the associated entropy loss. As such,

391

detection of nonspecific PPIs, i.e., false-positives, can be minimized. Nevertheless, if

392

the binding partners to be recruited prefer the specific scaffold-derived condensates

393

versus the surrounding environments, false-positive results can be generated. However,

394

with proper controls, such false-positive hits can be detected, and a change of scaffold

395

can be exploited to circumvent this issue.

396

There is another caveat associated with CoPIC. If the partner to be recruited can also

397

undergo phase separation, the potentially complicated interaction relationship between

398

the scaffold phase and the client phase might hinder the straightforward recruitment of

399

the clients. For example, for the PPI screening involving the nucleocapsid protein N,

400

there were hardly any positive interactions detected except for its self-association when

401

N protein serves as the client; however multiple PPIs were detected when N is fused

402

with the scaffold, GFP-Nup98N (Figure 3A). We reasoned that the phase separation

403

property of N protein (Iserman et al., 2020; Perdikari et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020)

404

interferes with its recruitment into the phase-separated compartment of the scaffolds. To

405

circumvent this caveat, binding partners with phase separation propensity should be

406

fused with the scaffold and those without phase separation propensity should serve as

407

the clients.

408

Even with these caveats considered, CoPIC is a simple and efficient method for

409

investigating PPIs in cells. In addition, CoPIC can be used to detect weak interactions

410

since the signals are enriched within the compartments and the client proteins are

411

overexpressed to high concentrations. Taking the interaction of Nsp14 with Nsp16 as an

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.26.424422; this version posted December 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

412

example, the negative pair demonstrated by the typical co-IP assay turned out to exhibit

413

a salient bidirectional colocalization within the compartment mediated by GFP-Nup98N

414

(Figure 3, S4B, S4C). Notably, CoPIC allows the compartmentalization of multiple PPIs

415

simultaneously which is hard to achieve by other approaches and is important for the

416

dissection of direct and indirect PPIs, hence the potential high-order complexes

417

(Watanabe et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018). Better yet, an extra benefit is that CoPIC is

418

especially suitable for PPI detection in a high-throughput fashion using an imaging-

419

based method, e.g. high-content imaging techniques.

420

When applied to investigate the complicated interaction within the SARS-CoV2

421

proteome, the availability of CoPIC allowed the revelation of several salient findings: (i)

422

SARS-CoV-2 shares conserved interactions with SARS-CoV and might have also

423

evolved more novel interactions to facilitate its efficient replication/transcription; (ii) the

424

majority of 16 Nsps are associated with viral RTC; and (iii) the interactions are centered

425

on open reading frame 1b (ORF1b)-encoded Nsps that were mainly connected by the

426

Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp14 and Nsp16.

427

Although utilizing a similar expression strategy for efficient replication/transcription,

428

SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a quite divergent pattern from other coronaviruses, sharing only a

429

limited number of homologs (Figure 4A). By comparative analyses of the interactions

430

between the two sub-species, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, in combination with

431

independently published data (Li et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2008; von Brunn et al., 2007),

432

the conserved interactions can be classified in the following categories: (i) complex

433

formation among the scaffold proteins, where Nsp7 and Nsp8 support the RNA-

434

dependent

435

methyltransferase activities of nsp14 and nsp16 by the respective associations; (ii)

436

interaction between RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12) and other key enzymes,

437

including primase (Nsp8), helicase (Nsp13), and Guanine-N7 methyltransferase

438

(Nsp14); (iii) a connection of the main protease (Nsp5) to RdRp (Nsp12) and Guanine-

439

N7 methyltransferase (Nsp14); and (iv) self-interaction of the accessory proteins like

440

Nsp5, Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp13 and Nsp16, and structural protein N. These conserved

441

interactions highlight the evolutionary convergence on the replication strategies at the

442

protein-protein interaction level and point to its potentially critical role in regulating viral

443

replication.

444

It is striking to identify 32 novel interactions among RTC-related factors in our study,

445

several of which were confirmed using co-IP (Figure 4, 5). However, it is worth

446

mentioning that the negative results may be due to the limitations of the assay itself and

447

do not mean that the interaction cannot occur during infection. Of these, Nsp1 and Nsp2

448

have the fewest binding partners, which might result from their effect on host viability

449

and suppressing protein synthesis (Angeletti et al., 2020; Garmashova et al., 2006; Rao

450

et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Among the identified interactions, perhaps the most

451

interesting are those taking place between ORF1b-encoded core enzymes (Nsp12,

452

Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, and Nsp16), responsible for the efficient genome replication and

453

transcription. Compared with other well-known core enzymes encoded by SARS-CoV-2,

454

the role of Nsp15 in the viral cycle is still unknown. Nsp15, also named NendoU

455

(Nidoviral endoribonuclease, specific for U), preferentially cleaves the 3' end of U and

456

forms 2’-3’ cyclic phosphate ends (Kim et al., 2020). Previous reverse genetics analyses

457

suggested the dispensable role of NendoU activity during viral replication (Ivanov et al.,

458

2004). Mutations of the catalytic site with His and Lys residues in MHV were shown to

459

promote a subtle defect in subgenomic mRNA accumulation while mutation of a

460

conserved Asp residue both in HCoV-229E and MHV almost abolished viral RNA

461

replication (Ivanov et al., 2004; Kang et al., 2007). In addition, Nsp15 might be

462

responsible for evading the host innate immune system, which is also independent of its

463

endonuclease activity (Liu et al., 2019; Zheng and Perlman, 2018). Intriguingly, our

464

CoPIC screening identified multiple novel binding partners, mainly concentrated on

465

Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp14, and Nsp16, suggesting the potential involvement of

466

Nsp15 in multiple sophisticated processes. These findings lay the foundation for further

467

functional studies.

468

In summary, the current work established a sensitive method for identifying PPIs in

469

living cells and thus constructed an interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 RTC-related

470

factors. Among the identified interactions in combination with the data obtained by other

471

methods, the most intriguing and striking are those between the viral core enzymes and

472

the corresponding high-order complexes. While the functional importance of most

473

intraviral PPIs remains less well understood, our network provides a powerful resource

474

to dissect their roles in mediating the genome replication/transcription processes of

475

SARS-CoV-2. The extensive interaction landscape among intraviral proteomes seems

476

to be the norm (Bartel et al., 1996; Choi et al., 2000; Dimitrova et al., 2003; Guo et al.,

477

2001; McCraith et al., 2000; Zell et al., 2005), underscoring the crucial roles of PPIs in

478

the viral life cycle. Hence the disruption of these intraviral PPIs would likely provide new

479

therapeutic opportunities against SARS-CoV-2. Notably, we have been already actively

480

engaging in high-throughput screening for drugs disrupting essential PPIs within SARS-

481

CoV-2 using CoPIC.

520

using MinuteTM Total Protein Extraction Kit for Animal Cultured Cells/Tissues (Invent

521

Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, the lysates were

522

incubated with GFP-Trap Magnetic Agarose (ChromoTek, Inc.) at 4°C for 1h, with

523

rotation. After incubation, beads were collected with a Magnetic Separator, and the

524

unbounded samples were removed and the rest saved for analysis. After 5 times

525

washing, the samples were boiled for 10 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel

526

electrophoresis (PAGE) and examined by Western blot to determine if the mCherry-

527

tagged protein was co-immunoprecipitated with the GFP-tagged protein.

4J-M, S4D, and S6B were directly analyzed by western blot. The cell samples were

531

resuspended using 2 × Laemmli loading buffer. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-

532

PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were incubated

533

overnight with primary antibodies, then with the corresponding peroxide-labeled IgG.

534

Finally, enhanced chemiluminescence reagent was used to visualize the results.
