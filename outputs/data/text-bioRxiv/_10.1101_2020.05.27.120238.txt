ABSTRACT
Taq DNA polymerase, one of the first thermostable DNA polymerases to be discovered, has been
typecast as a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase commonly employed for PCR. However, Taq
polymerase belongs to the same DNA polymerase superfamily as the Molony murine leukemia
virus reverse transcriptase and has in the past been shown to possess reverse transcriptase
activity. We report optimized buffer and salt compositions that promote the reverse transcriptase
activity of Taq DNA polymerase, and thereby allow it to be used as the sole enzyme in TaqMan
RT-qPCR reactions. We demonstrate the utility of Taq-alone RT-qPCR reactions by executing
CDC SARS-CoV-2 N1, N2, and N3 TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that could detect as few as 2
copies/µL of input viral genomic RNA.
INTRODUCTION
RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the complexity
of this assay sometimes limits its use in either resource-poor settings or in circumstances where
reagent availability has become limited. To overcome these limitations, we have previously
advocated the use of a thermostable reverse transcriptase (RT) / DNA polymerase (DNAP), which
we have termed RTX (and which is distinct from RTx, from New England Biolabs) for use as the
RT component of RT-qPCR. RTX is an evolved variant of the high-fidelity, thermostable DNA
polymerase from Thermococcus kodakaraensis (KOD DNAP) with relaxed substrate specificity
allowing it to perform as both a DNA- and RNA-directed DNA polymerase1. RTX has been shown
to serve as the RT component in standard TaqMan probe-based RT-qPCR and as the sole
enzyme
component
for
dye-based
RT-qPCR
(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.013342v4).
The basis for the directed evolution of RTX is that many DNA polymerases have reverse
transcriptase activity, with some of them, such as the polymerase from Thermus thermophilus
(Tth), having fairly substantial activity2. This is a discovery that appears to resurface every so
often, but that can be traced back to 19893. The use of a single enzyme for both reverse
transcription and DNA polymerization can simplify molecular diagnostic assays, including
isothermal amplification assays4. In the midst of reagent supply issues, this led us to wonder
whether it might prove possible to use readily available thermostable DNA polymerases as single
enzyme solutions for RT-qPCR. We find that a relatively simple buffer (“Gen 6 A”) allows robust
detection of SARS-CoV-2 in TaqMan probe-based RT-qPCR. We have validated this buffer mix
with Taq DNAP from several commercial sources.

Reverse transcription (RT) qPCR assay
RT-qPCR assays were assembled in a total volume of 25 µL containing the indicated buffer at 1X
strength (Table 2). The buffer was supplemented with 0.4 mM deoxyribonucleotides (dNTP), 402
nM each of forward and reverse PCR primer pairs, 102 nM of the TaqMan probe, and 2.5 units of
Taq DNA polymerase from indicated commercial vendors. Indicated copies of SARS-CoV-2 viral
genomic RNA, SARS-CoV-2 N gene armored RNA or RNaseP armored RNA prepared in TE
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) immediately prior to use were added to
RT-qPCR reactions containing corresponding PCR primers. Negative control reactions did not
receive any specific templates. Amplicon accumulation was measured in real-time by incubating
the reactions in a LightCycler96 qPCR machine (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) programmed to hold
60 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min prior to undergoing 55 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec
and 60 °C for 30 sec. TaqMan probe fluorescence was measured during the amplification step
(60 °C for 30 sec) of each cycle using the FAM channel.

PCR amplification as described above. In some experiments, RT-qPCR tests were subjected to
a heat kill step prior to reverse transcription by incubating the reactions at 95 °C for 5 min. In some
experiments, the RNA templates were treated with DNase I prior to RT-qPCR analysis. Briefly, 1
x 107 copies/µL (5x108 total copies) of armored N gene RNA or 2 x 103 copies/µL (105 total copies)
of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic RNA were incubated with 0.5 units of DNase I for 10 min at 37 °C.
DNase I was then inactivated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mM and heating at 65
°C for 10 min.
RESULTS
Buffer optimization for Taq DNA polymerase-mediated reverse transcription-qPCR
While Taq DNA polymerase has previously been shown to possess reverse transcriptase
activity,5, 6 it is not commonly thought of as an enzyme that would be readily used for reverse
transcription in many assays. To verify this activity and to determine whether Taq polymerasemediated reverse transcription might be leveraged for single enzyme RNA detection, we carried
out the CDC-approved SARS-CoV-2-specific N1 TaqMan RT-qPCR assay using only Taq DNA
polymerase and its accompanying commercial reaction buffer, ThermoPol, (New England
Biolabs) seeded with different copies of N gene armored RNA (Asuragen), a commercial template
preparation that is devoid of DNA. Even though the only polymerase present in these reactions
was Taq DNA polymerase (NEB), and no dedicated reverse transcriptase was added,
amplification curves were generated in response to 3 x 105, 3 x 104, and 3 x 103 copies of the
SARS-CoV-2 N gene armored RNA templates (Figure 1).
We hypothesized that the buffers in which Taq DNA polymerase is commonly used have been
optimized for DNA amplification and likely would not support robust reverse transcription. In
addition, previous work had explored optimization of buffer conditions for Taq Stoffel DNA
polymerase (i.e. “klenTaq”).7 We therefore undertook a series of buffer optimizations in which we
sequentially varied: buffer pH, Tris concentration, the concentration of monovalent cations
((NH4)2SO4 and KCl) and divalent cations (MgSO4), and the concentration of the non-ionic
detergent Triton X-100 (Table 2). These variables were all chosen based on knowledge of the
reaction. The optimum pH for Taq DNA polymerase activity is reported to be between 7.0 and
8.0, with highest activity observed in Tris-HCl-based buffer at pH 7.8,8 and increasing pH is one
of the factors that decreases Taq fidelity.9 Monovalent cations, such as K+, are known to stimulate
the catalytic activity of Taq DNA polymerase with optimal activity being observed at about 60 mM
KCl,8 and higher ionic strength can promote primer annealing. Ammonium ions (NH4+), on the
other hand, may have a destabilizing effect, especially on weak hydrogen bonds between
mismatched primers and templates. The divalent cation Mg2+ is essential for the catalytic activity
of Taq DNA polymerase, and its concentration is frequently varied to obtain optimum
amplification8, 10 Finally, the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 is thought to reduce nucleic acid
secondary structure and may influence RT-PCR specificity.
When SARS-CoV-2 N1 TaqMan RT-qPCR assays were performed in the Generation 1 buffers A,
B, and C, Taq polymerase generated distinct amplification curves with 10-fold improvement in
sensitivity relative to the commercial ThermoPol buffer (Figure 1). In fact, in Generation 1, buffer
B, amplification curves were observed with as few as 30 copies of armored RNA templates. To
identify and hone parameters, we tested the same TaqMan RT-qPCR assay in four Generation 2
buffers with lowered Tris concentrations that matched that of the ThermoPol buffer. In addition,
MgSO4 was replaced with MgCl2, a more commonly used source of Mg2+ ions in PCR. However,

reduction in Tris concentrations caused a significant drop in RT-qPCR sensitivity compared to
both Generation 1 and ThermoPol buffers (Figure 1). Therefore, the Tris concentration and pH
in 1X buffers were held constant at 60 mM and pH 8.0 from Generation 3 onwards. In Generations
3-6 we sequentially varied the concentration of (NH4)2SO4 from 0 to 5 mM, KCl from 20 to 50 mM,
MgCl2 from 2 to 8 mM, and Triton X-100 from 0 to 0.1%, and arrived at an optimized Generation
6 buffer A (Gen 6 A) that contained 60 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM (NH4)2SO4, 40 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2, and no Triton X-100. Robust amplification curves were generated and as few as 10
copies/µL (30 copies total) of the RNA template could be detected when Gen 6 A buffer was used.
To confirm this novel application of Taq DNA polymerase, we tested two different commercial
sources of Taq DNA polymerase, NEB and Thermo Fisher, using additional RNA templates and
TaqMan RT-qPCR assays: (i) CDC N1, N2, and N3 TaqMan RT-qPCR assays of SARS-CoV-2
genomic RNA purified from infected cells (ATCC) and (ii) CDC RNaseP TaqMan RT-qPCR assay
of RNaseP armored RNA. Similar to our results with armored N gene RNA, the NEB Taq DNA
polymerase was able to perform TaqMan RT-qPCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic RNA
with all three CDC assays (Figure 2). As expected, Gen 6 A buffer improved RT-qPCR
performance of Taq DNA polymerase allowing detection of as few as 6 copies of viral RNA in all
three N gene assays. The RT-qPCR ability was not restricted to the NEB Taq DNA polymerase.
Taq DNA polymerase from a different commercial vendor, Thermo Fisher, could also support RTqPCR analysis of viral genomic RNA. Similar to the NEB enzyme, Thermo Fisher Taq DNA
polymerase also demonstrated better activity in Gen 6 A buffer and was able to detect viral
genomic RNA using all three N gene assays, albeit with a higher detection limit (Figure 2). Both
NEB and Thermo Fisher Taq DNA polymerases were also able to perform TaqMan RT-qPCR
analysis of RNaseP armored RNA using the CDC assay (Figure 2). These results suggest that
Taq DNA polymerase can support TaqMan RT-qPCR analyses of RNA in one-enzyme reactions.

To further prove that the reverse transcriptase is inherent in Taq polymerase itself, we incubated
RT-qPCR assays at 95 °C for 5 min prior to reverse transcription, which should inactivate any
contaminating mesophilic reverse transcriptases (Supplementary Figure 1). Taq polymerase
was still fully capable of RT-qPCR.
Reverse transcription is necessary for efficient Taq DNA polymerase-mediated RT-qPCR

The armored RNA templates and viral genomic RNA templates used in these studies are
theoretically devoid of DNA templates. To demonstrate that the TaqMan RT-qPCR amplification
signals generated by Taq DNA polymerase are not due to amplification of contaminating DNA
templates, we treated the RNA templates with DNase I prior to RT-qPCR amplification. As shown
in Figure 3, Taq DNA polymerase-mediated TaqMan RT-qPCR assays generated amplification
signals from both DNase treated genomic RNA and armored RNA. This was true of not only NEB
and Thermo Fisher Taq DNA polymerase but also a preparation of Taq DNA polymerase
purchased from Promega (data not shown). While N2 and N3 assays could still detect the
smallest template quantities tested - 6 copies of viral genomic RNA or 30 copies of armored N
RNA – most amplification curves suffered a small increase of about 1-2 Ct in their time to detection
(Figure 3). In contrast, the N1 assay demonstrated anywhere between a 1 and 5 Ct delay with
DNase treatment of RNA templates, and failed to generate signal from the lowest template
concentrations.
To confirm that reverse transcription step in the TaqMan RT-qPCR assay was indeed necessary
in order to generate amplification curves in response to template RNA, we executed CDC SARSCoV-2 N1, N2, and N3 assays using NEB or Thermo Fisher Taq DNA polymerases without
performing the reverse transcription step prior to qPCR amplification. Eliminating a 30 min
incubation at 60 °C (the putative reverse transcription step) prior to PCR thermal cycling also
eliminated robust amplification of viral RNA templates (Supplementary Figure 2). The TaqMan
probe signal remained at background levels in all reactions except the N3 assays performed in
Gen 6 A buffer. Even in this case, amplification curves were significantly delayed and only
apparent in the presence of relatively high numbers of RNA templates. For instance, Taq obtained
from NEB detected 6000 and 600 copies of viral genomic RNA (with Ct values of 43.42 and 46.55,
respectively). These same copy numbers of template RNA when subjected to a Taq-mediated
reverse transcription step prior to qPCR amplification typically yielded Ct values of 27 and 30
(Figure 2). These results demonstrate that Taq polymerase can generate amplicons from RNA
during a normal thermal cycling reaction, and that a pre-incubation step greatly improves
detection.

polymerase purchased from NEB was used to operate CDC SARS-CoV-2 N1, N2, and N3 TaqMan RTqPCR assays using SARS-CoV-2 viral genomic RNA (panels A-C) or N gene armored RNA (panels D-F)
treated with DNase I. Amplification curves shown in panels A-C resulted from 6000 (black traces), 600 (red
traces), 60 (blue traces), 6 (pink traces), and 0 (gray traces) copies of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA.
Amplification curves in panels D-F resulted from 30,000 (black traces), 3,000 (red traces), 300 (blue traces),
30 (pink traces) and 0 (gray traces) copies of N gene armored RNA. Representative Ct values for RT-qPCR
amplification of indicated copies of untreated and DNase I treated SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and N gene
armored RNA are tabulated.

CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that, given the correct buffer conditions, Taq DNA polymerase can perform
reverse transcription and TaqMan qPCR in one-pot reactions. While the use of a proficient
reverse transcriptase along with a proficient thermostable DNA polymerase may still be the best
option for many applications, the ability to use only a single enzyme in assays for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA opens the way to new diagnostic approaches, especially in resource-poor
settings where reagent availability or production may be issues. However, it is also evident from
our experiments that the variability in amplification efficiency observed as buffer conditions were
iteratively improved may mean that similar buffer optimizations will need to be routinely carried
out with other templates. It is nonetheless possible that the reverse transcriptase activity of Taq
DNA polymerase, once fully optimized, will prove useful in many different applications, up to and
including those where many different templates are present, such as RNASeq.
