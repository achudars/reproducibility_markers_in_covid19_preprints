Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple organs, including lung, intestine, kidney, heart, liver, and brain.
The molecular details of how the virus navigates through diverse cellular environments and
establishes replication are poorly defined. Here, we performed global proteomic analysis of the
virus-host interface in a newly established panel of phenotypically diverse, SARS-CoV-2infectable human cell lines representing different body organs. This revealed universal inhibition
of interferon signaling across cell types following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed
systematic analyses of the JAK-STAT pathway in a broad range of cellular systems, including

immortalized cell lines and primary-like cardiomyocytes, and found that several pathway
components were targeted by SARS-CoV-2 leading to cellular desensitization to interferon. These
findings indicate that the suppression of interferon signaling is a mechanism widely used by
SARS-CoV-2 in diverse tissues to evade antiviral innate immunity, and that targeting the viral
mediators of immune evasion may help block virus replication in patients with COVID-19.

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The virus primarily infects lungs, causing acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure2, which are one of the leading causes of death
in COVID-19 patients. However, as more tissue specimens from infected and/or deceased
individuals have become available and are probed for the presence of viral proteins or particles,
there is increasing appreciation that SARS-CoV-2 can target multiple organs. Evidence for virus
replication has so far been found in the intestine3,4, liver5,6, kidney7,8, heart9,10, and brain11,12.
The molecular mechanisms that govern the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to manipulate diverse
cellular environments and navigate various body organs are unknown. One way to identify these
mechanisms is to conduct a comprehensive survey of cellular pathways disrupted by the virus in
distinct cell backgrounds. This however would require human-derived cell models that allow

efficient and synchronized viral infection so as to generate a high-confidence catalog of virusinduced changes. Such systems are currently lacking, and as a result, a large number of SARSCoV-2 studies, including a recent genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify the viral essentiality
factors13, have been carried out in non-human cells.
To catalog cellular pathways broadly targeted by SARS-CoV-2, we generated a panel of
17 phenotypically diverse human cell lines that represented various body organs and supported
high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We leveraged this unique panel of cell culture models to
profile proteomic responses to infection in cells originating from lung, liver, intestine, kidney, heart,
and brain. This led to identification of cellular proteins and pathways widely targeted by the virus
across cell types. Notable among these pathways was the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, the key
component in the interferon response pathway. We performed extensive validation and functional
studies, both in cell lines and pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, to show that SARSCoV-2 rapidly disables the JAK-STAT pathway and consequently desensitizes host cells to
interferon treatment. In line with this, the chemical inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling enhanced
SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results uncover an immune evasion strategy of SARS-CoV-2 to
create a favorable environment for its replication in diverse tissue types and highlight virusmediated immune antagonism as a target for therapeutic intervention.

RESULTS
A large number of human cell lines are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection
Seventeen human cell lines derived from lung, intestine, heart, kidney, liver, brain, and
vasculature (Fig. 1a) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1

to allow multiple cycles of virus replication and spread. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis showed
that nine of the 17 cell lines were completely resistant to infection (Fig. 1b). Of the remaining
eight, three, Calu-3, HepG2, and Caco-2 cells reliably supported measurable virus infection at 24
hours post-infection (hpi), although at levels much lower than those observed for the widely used
Vero E6 cells (>10%, compared to 73% for Vero cells). The number of virus-infected cells further
increased to around 35-42% for Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells at 72 hpi, and the infection also became
detectable in HK-2 (48%), HuH-6 (47%), HuH-7 (22%) and Huh-7.5 (27%) cells at that time.
When we analyzed ACE2 expression through Western blot (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and
flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 1b), the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible cell lines, such as HK-2,
Calu-3, HepG2, Huh-7.5, and Caco-2, showed detectable levels of ACE2, both in lysates and on
the cell surface, although these levels were substantially lower than those found in the highly
susceptible Vero E6 cells. Human vascular endothelial HUVEC cells had measurable ACE2
expression, yet they did not support virus infection under the conditions tested, suggesting that
they might lack an important pro-viral factor(s). In contrast, HuH-6 and HuH-7 cells were
susceptible to infection, yet lacked detectable levels of ACE2. Nonetheless, overall, the cell
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 mostly correlated with ACE2 expression (Fig. 1c). Our attempts to
measure TMPRSS2, another viral entry factor, by Western blot and flow cytometry did not yield
reliable results with any of the antibodies tested (data not shown).
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression allows efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells
We next investigated whether exogenous expression of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 in human
cells alter their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The cell lines overexpressing ACE2 allowed varying
levels of infection whereas TMPRSS2 had mostly no or only subtle effect (Fig. 2a and Extended

Data Fig. 2a), when entry was probed using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoparticles
carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP)14.
However, when ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed together, most of the cell lines became
highly susceptible to infection, with 293T, Calu-6, HuH-6, Huh-7.5, and Caco-2 cells
demonstrating considerably higher infection efficiency than Vero E6 cells. Human intestinal HT29
cells remained refractory to infection even after ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression, and HUVEC,
HeLa, RD, and MRC5 cells allowed only moderate infection. All cell lines were highly permissive
to wild-type VSV replication (Extended Data Fig. 2b), suggesting that S protein-mediated entry
was the major factor determining cell susceptibility.
This pattern was confirmed with authentic SARS-CoV-2. We infected the cells at a low MOI
of 0.01 and identified the infected cells by IF at 24 hpi. Consistent with the pseudoparticle assay,
ACE2 overexpression allowed a varying degree of infection in several cell lines, with the number
of positive cells ranging between 2-87% (Fig. 2b). The most remarkable infection efficiency was
observed when ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed together, with nine of the 17 human cell
lines achieving over 70% positivity, numbers comparable to Vero E6 cells. Interestingly, in
congruence with the pseudoparticle assay, HT29 cells remained resistant to infection even after
ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expression (Fig. 2b). Overall, these results indicate that exogenous
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 renders most of the human cell lines highly susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Proteomic analysis of human cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2
The development of human cell lines that showed uniform infection allowed us to employ
global proteomic analysis to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host cells without the

complication of disambiguating a mixture of uninfected and infected cells. The ACE2/TMPRSS2expressing A549 (lung), Caco-2 (intestine), HuH-6 (liver), AC-16 (heart), SK-N-SH (brain), and
HK-2 (kidney) cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 and subjected to global
proteomic analysis at two different times post-infection (12 and 24 hpi for A549, Caco-2, and HuH6; 8 and 12 hpi for AC-16, SK-N-SH, and HK-2) (Fig. 3a). To achieve a synchronized infection,
we adsorbed the virus onto cells on ice for 1h followed by incubation at 37ºC. The infections were
performed in triplicate, and in-parallel analyses of time-matched, mock-infected cells were
performed for comparison. Depending on the cell type, 50-80% cells were found infected at the
first time of harvest and 80-100% at the second time (Fig. 3b, top two panels).
Whole proteomic analysis identified around 5,000 proteins in both uninfected and infected
cells across cell lines. Despite the fact that MS2-based TMT ratios are heavily affected by ratio
compression15, the high reproducibility among replicates allowed us to identify hundreds of
differentially regulated proteins in each cell line (Fig. 3b, middle and bottom panels). As
expected, the most highly enriched candidates in the infected cells were the viral proteins (Fig.
3c and Extended Data Fig. 3), including structural proteins, such as, spike (S), membrane (M),
and nucleocapsid (N); accessory proteins, such as, ORF7a and ORF9b; and non-structural
components mapping to the polyprotein PP1ab (Fig. 3d), which is consistent with earlier studies16.
Several cellular proteins were found to be differentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 in diverse
or distinct cell types (Supplementary Information and Extended Data Fig. 4). We mainly
focused our analysis on proteins broadly targeted by the virus across cell lines (Fig. 3e). Among
such proteins were the members of the ubiquitin pathway, such as USP22, UBL5, and UBE2C,
which were downregulated in several cell lines. Similarly, HNRNPD (aka AUF1), a protein known

to inhibit enteroviruses through degradation of the viral RNA17, was depleted in SARS-CoV-2infected cells. Several chemokines, which are essential mediators of inflammation and play
important roles in controlling viral infections, such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL12 were
also among the downregulated proteins. Consistent with previous reports, several proteins
involved in the cell cycle regulation, including AURKA and AURKB, were diminished upon SARSCoV-2 infection18. We also identified differential regulation of several innate immune components
in the proteomic dataset. For instance, JAK1 and SERPINE1 were downregulated, whereas IFI35,
which has been shown to negatively regulate antiviral responses, was enriched following SARSCoV-2 infection (Fig. 3e).
We performed Western blot analysis on a subset of proteins that showed differential
regulation in our proteomics analysis. As controls, we included two additional viruses, yellow fever
virus (YFV) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), to rule out any general stress responses induced
upon a positive-sense RNA virus infection (Fig. 4a). Western blotting largely revealed the protein
expression patterns consistent with the proteomics results (Fig. 4b). As an example, USP22 was
depleted in all cell lines tested, while APOE was impaired in a small subset of cells. For the most
part, YFV and CVB3 infection did not affect the selected proteins, with the exception of TOB2,
that was depleted in all virus-infected cells. These results confirmed the authenticity of our
proteomic dataset and indicate that most of the alterations we detected in the infected cells were
specifically due to SARS-CoV-2 infection rather than simply a generic response to viral invasion.
SARS-CoV-2 blocks the interferon signaling pathway
Among the cellular proteins downregulated across all cell lines was Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)
(Fig. 4b), a key signaling molecule downstream of interferons (IFN) and other cytokines, such as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.358259; this version posted October 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-719,20. This prompted us to examine other components of the
IFN signaling pathway. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) showed decreased expression similar to JAK1
and was downregulated in most of the cell lines tested (Fig. 5a). Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) exhibited
cell type-dependent inhibition; it was diminished in A549, Caco-2, and HuH-6 cells, but not in AC16 and SK-N-SH cells. When we tested the abundance of type I IFN receptors, we found strong
inhibition of IFNAR1, but not IFNAR2, following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5a). Detailed time
course investigation showed that most of the JAK-STAT components were depleted early in
infection, indicating a quick active repression of their abundance as opposed to collateral effect
of generalized gene inhibition often observed late during infection (Fig. 5b and Extended Data
Fig. 5a).
To confirm the authenticity of these findings in a more physiologically relevant setting, we
established a human induced pluripotent cell (hiPSC)-derived model of SARS-CoV-2 infection
and monitored the ability of the virus to impair IFN-related proteins. We differentiated hiPSC into
cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and first assessed their ability to support virus infection. IF analysis
showed that these cells were highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and when infected at
an MOI of 5, most of the cells became positive by 72 hpi (Fig. 5c, left panel). In these infected
cardiomyocytes, we observed strong depletion of JAK1, TYK2, and IFNAR1, but not of IFNAR2,
consistent with the cell line data (Fig. 5c, right panel). These results clearly indicate that SARSCoV-2 causes bona-fide inhibition of upstream signaling molecules in the interferon response
pathway.
Engagement of IFN to its receptor complex and the subsequent activation of receptorassociated JAK kinases leads to tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, and activation of STAT

proteins21. Because SARS-CoV-2 inhibited the expression of IFN receptor and its associated
JAKs, we next determined if this inhibition desensitized the infected cells to IFN treatment. For
this, we treated uninfected and infected cells with IFN-α and examined the phosphorylation of
three main STATs involved in IFN signaling, namely STAT1, 2, and 3. As expected, IFN treatment
of uninfected cells for 30 minutes caused extensive phosphorylation of all three STATs without
influencing the abundance of total proteins (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 5b). In contrast,
however, the virus-infected cells were highly resistant to IFN, with some cell types showing no
change in STAT phosphorylation while others registering only subtle effects. The strongest effect
was seen in Caco-2 cells, where STAT phosphorylation was inhibited by over 90% following virus
infection (Fig. 5d, right panel). Interestingly, the abundance of total STAT2 protein was also
diminished in infected cells, indicating an additional layer of virus-imposed inhibition of IFN
signaling (Fig. 5d). To further confirm these findings, we performed a dose-response analysis of
STAT phosphorylation upon IFN treatment. While escalating doses of IFN caused increasing
phosphorylation of STATs in uninfected cells, only negligible effect was seen in SARS-CoV-2infected cells (Fig. 5e).
Once activated by phosphorylation, STAT proteins make homo-or heterodimers and
translocate to the nucleus where they activate the expression of interferon stimulated genes
(ISGs)21. Consistent with the decreased phosphorylation of STAT proteins following SARS-CoV2 infection, we observed strong inhibition of STAT1 nuclear translocation. While most of the
STAT1 protein in uninfected cells moved to the nucleus within 30 min of IFN treatment, it largely
remained in the cytoplasm in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 5f). This was associated with a
significant loss of ISG induction. We treated uninfected and virus-infected cells with IFN for 1, 2,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.358259; this version posted October 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

4, and 8h and examined the expression of two ISGs, ISG15 and RSAD2 (a.k.a. Viperin) by RTqPCR. Remarkably, the expression of both ISGs was completely blocked in the infected cells as
compared to their uninfected counterparts that showed between 3- and 85-fold upregulation of
ISGs following IFN treatment (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 6). In line with these findings,
chemical inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway with JAK inhibitors, Ruxolitinib and Barcitinib,
increased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-CMs, as evidenced by 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the
percentage of virus-infected cells at 12 hpi, although this replicative advantage was lost by 24 hpi
(Fig. 5h). In all, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 targets multiple components of the JAKSTAT axis and transforms infected cells into an interferon non-responsive state (Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION
We report an immune evasion strategy that SARS-CoV-2 uses to antagonize IFN signaling
and establish infection in diverse tissue types. Being amongst the earliest and most potent of the
immune responses, IFN signaling poses an immediate threat to viruses and can quickly eliminate
them from the infected cells. Two recent reports have shown that inborn errors in IFN signaling
and the presence of anti-IFN auto-antibodies can predispose individuals to a life-threatening
COVID-19 disease, highlighting the importance of IFN immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection22,23. Our
findings complement these reports and show that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a suite of
mechanisms to counteract the effector functions of interferon. This inhibition of IFN signaling is
also expected to attenuate the production of IFN, as these two processes are tightly regulated by
a positive feedback loop, with early IFNs inducing the expression of viral sensors24, interferon
regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), and other signaling molecules25, which regulate the expression of

IFN26. The overall outcome of this inhibition is an attenuated antiviral state supporting
uninterrupted viral propagation in disparate tissues.
Several studies are currently evaluating the clinical efficacy of IFN alone or in combination
with antiviral compounds for the treatment of COVID-19 (https://clinicaltrials.gov). This is based
on the supposition that IFNs can help clear infection in two ways. First, by acting on infected cells
and eliminating the replicating virus. Second, by creating an antiviral state in uninfected cells to
block viral spread. There is support for the latter mechanism of action from recent studies showing
that pre-treatment with IFN can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture27,28.
However, our results show that once the viral replication is established inside a cell, its ability to
respond to IFN is severely compromised, suggesting that the former potential protective
mechanism of IFN treatment may not function in COVID-19 patients. In a clinical setting, by the
time a patient receives IFN treatment, a large number of cells are infected with the virus, and
these would be expected to be non-responsive to interferon treatment.
Considering this scenario, the timing of IFN therapy relative to infection is expected to be
the key determinant of outcome. In a recent retrospective study of 446 patients with COVID-19,
early use of IFN was found to be protective, whereas its late administration was associated with
delayed recovery and increased mortality29. Similarly, the World Health Organization’s largescale, multi-country clinical trial showed no protective effect of IFN in hospitalized COVID-19
patients with late-stage disease (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20209817
v1). The same has been previously reported in mice infected with a related human coronavirus,
MERS-CoV, where early administration of IFN protected the animals from lethal infection,
whereas delayed administration of IFN failed to inhibit virus replication30.

Of note, the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway has been shown to stimulate the
production of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines31, which in turn attract an army of immune
cells to the site of infection to orchestrate the destruction of infected cells. Inhibition of the JAKSTAT axis by SARS-CoV-2 can therefore suppress the production of cytokines, thereby disrupting
a potent and timely inflammatory response. The interferon pathway is also implicated in a
crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity32. Loss of bridging between these two immunity
arms and the resulting timing mismatch has been postulated to cause severe disease in COVID19 patients33,34. A recent study that examined peripheral blood from patients with COVID-19 of
varying severity also reported a strong correlation between impairment of IFN responses and the
clinical outcome of infection35. These two observations, when combined, firmly point to the
possibility of aberrant IFN responses to be at the heart of COVID-19 pathogenesis.
Our study reports a suite of human cell lines suitable for SARS-CoV-2 studies. Exogenous
expression of ACE2 has been demonstrated to improve the susceptibility of a few human cell
lines, such as A549 and HeLa, to SARS-CoV-236,37, but our results show that efficient infection
can only be achieved when ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed. This finding is important
because it provides a conceptual framework for generating efficient infection models for SARSCoV-2. Human ACE2-expressing mice that are currently used to investigate SARS-CoV-238 do
not recapitulate the full spectrum of the human disease (reviewed in39). From our results, it is
tempting to speculate that co-expression of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 might improve the
quality and physiological relevance of these mouse models.
The human cell lines we generated represent a rich resource that can be used to
investigate cellular pathways broadly targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in diverse tissue types. While

immortalized and cancerous cell lines often incompletely recapitulate the genotypic and
phenotypic profile of their tissues of origin, many cell lines maintain an important degree of tissue
identity40. This is reflected in our proteomic dataset. As an example, APOE, a protein regulated
upon virus infection and which we validated by Western blot, was only found to be altered in liver
and intestinal cell lines, two tissue types known to express this protein to high levels41. The results
obtained from hiPSC-CMs closely matched with those from the cardiac cell line AC-16, providing
further validity to our cell line approach (Fig. 5a, c).
Recent studies have reported proteomic profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Caco-216 and
A549 cells (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.156455v1). These studies,
however, employed relatively suboptimal infection models, and thus relied on a mosaic of infected
and uninfected cells. We found little overlap between our results and those reported by others.
This could be due to the differences in viral isolates, proteomic platforms, and analyses pipelines,
but is likely to also be due to disparities in the number of infected cells in the cell population. Our
infection models supported quick, uniform virus infection allowing us to identify SARS-CoV-2specific changes as opposed to generalized stress responses, as evident from the Western blot
analysis of select hits in cells infected with two non-coronaviruses (Fig. 4b).
In all, this study uncovers the phenomenon of SARS-CoV-2-mediated desensitization to
IFN. These are critical findings that will enhance our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 mutes
the innate immune system to sustain its replication, leading to impaired adaptive immune
responses and consequently severe disease. The knowledge gained from these studies will
provide the foundation for the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at boosting cell-

Plasmids
Expression plasmid encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, pCG1_SARS-2_S, has
recently been described and was a kind gift from Stefan Pohlmann42. The plasmids

pCAGGS_TMPRSS2-Flag and pcDNA3.1_ACE2, encoding human ACE2 and TMPRSS2,
respectively, were obtained from Thomas Gallagher (Loyola University). We transferred ACE2
and untagged TMPRSS2 to the lentiviral pLOC vector to obtain pLOC_hACE2_PuroR and
pLOC_hTMPRSS2_BlastR, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 stock preparation and titration
We used 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 isolate (NCBI accession number: MN985325) of
SARS-CoV-2, obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and BEI Resources.
To generate the passage 1 (P1) virus stock, we infected Vero E6 cells, seeded one day prior into
a 175 cm2 flask at a density of 10 million cells, with the master stock diluted in 10 ml of Opti-MEM.
Following virus adsorption to the cells at 37ºC for 1h, we added 15 ml of DMEM containing 10%
FBS and 1X penicillin/streptomycin. The next day, we removed the inoculum, rinsed the cell
monolayer with 1X PBS, and added 25 ml of fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS. Two days later,
when the cytopathic effect of the virus was clearly visible, as evidenced by a large number of
round floating cells, we collected the culture medium, passed it through a 0.2µ filter, and stored
at -80ºC. We then prepared the P2 working stock of the virus by infecting Vero E6 cells with the
P1 stock at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell and harvesting
the culture medium three days later.
To determine the titer of our viral stock by plaque assay, we seeded Vero E6 cells into a
12-well plate at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells per well. The next day, the cells were infected with
serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus stock for 1h at 37ºC. We then added 1 ml per well of the overlay
medium containing 2X DMEM (Gibco; #12800017) supplemented with 4% FBS and mixed at a
1:1 ratio with 1.2% Avicel (DuPont; RC-581) to obtain the final concentrations of 2% and 0.6% for

FBS and Avicel, respectively. Three days later, the overlay medium was removed, the cell
monolayer was washed with 1X PBS and fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were then washed with 1X PBS and stained for 1h at room
temperature with 0.1% crystal violet prepared in 10% ethanol/water. After rinsing with tap water,
the number of plaques were counted and the virus titer was calculated. The titer of our P2 virus
stock was 1 x 107 PFU/ml.

VSV pseudoparticle production and infection
VSV pseudoparticles carrying the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were generated as previously
described42. Briefly, 293T cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at the density of 5x105 cells per
well. The next day, the cells were transfected with 6 µg of pCG1_SARS-2_S using X-tremeGENE
9 DNA transfection reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Twenty hours later, the cells were inoculated with a
replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) modified to contain an expression cassette
for GFP in place of the VSV-G open reading frame, VSV*ΔG-GFP (kindly provided by Stefan
Pohlmann of the Leibniz Institute for Primate Research (DPZ), Gottingen, Germany). Following
2h incubation of cells with VSV*ΔG-GFP at 37ºC, the inoculum was removed and the cells were
washed three times with FBS-free DMEM. Two ml of DMEM/10%FBS supplemented with anti
VSV-G antibody was then added to each well to neutralize any residual input VSV.
Pseudoparticles were harvested 20h later, passed through 0.45 µ filter, and stored at -80ºC.
For infection experiments, target cells grown in 24-well plates to the confluency of 70-80%
were infected with pseudoparticles. Twenty-four hours later, the cells, including those floating
around in the culture medium due to cytopathic effects of VSV replication, were collected and
fixed in 4% PFA. Flow cytometry was performed to count the percentage of GFP positive cells.

Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)
To measure the mRNA abundance of ISGs, total RNA was isolated from cells using Qiagen
RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen #74134), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with an
additional on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen; #79256). RT-qPCR was performed using Luna®
Universal One-Step RT-qPCR kit (New England Biolabs; #E3005L). Briefly, a 12 µl of reaction
mixture containing 2 µl of RNA, 0.4 µM of each forward and reverse primer, 0.6 µl of the 20X Luna
WarmStart® RT Enzyme Mix, and 6 µl of the 2X Luna Universal One-Step Reaction Mix was
subjected to one-step RT-qPCR using Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3 (ThermoFisher
Scientific), with the following cycling conditions; reverse transcription at 50°C for 10 min, initial
denaturation at 95°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec and
annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 min, ending with the melt curve analysis of the PCR product
from 65ºC to 95ºC, rising in 0.5ºC per second increments, waiting for 30 sec at 65ºC and for 5 sec
at each step thereafter, and acquiring fluorescence at each temperature increment. The Cq values
were determined using the QuantStudioTM Design and Analysis software V1.5.1. RPS11 was used
as a housekeeping gene and the ISG Cq values were normalized against this gene to calculate
the fold change between untreated and IFN-treated cells.
Immunofluorescence
Virus-infected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. The fixative was
removed and the cell monolayer washed twice with 1X PBS. The cells were then permeabilized
and incubated overnight at 4ºC with anti-SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid antibody (1:2,000 dilution).
The cells were then washed 5 times with 1X PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Invitrogen; #A11008) in the dark at room

temperature for 1h and counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured using EVOS M5000
Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific). For quantitative analysis of the fixed cell images, we
used the MuviCyte Live-Cell Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). We acquired images
of multiple microscopic fields per well using a 10X objective lens and counted the number of DAPIand viral antigen-positive cells. For each of those images, we then calculated the percentage of
DAPI-positive cells expressing the viral antigen and plotted the mean±SD of multiple images for
each condition.
Flow cytometry
For cell surface analysis of ACE2, we harvested cells and washed them in FACS Buffer
(2% FBS in 1X PBS). Cells were resuspended in 1:50 dilution of human FC blocking solution
(BioLegend; #422302) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Human ACE2 antibody or goat IgG isotype
control was then added to the cells to obtain the final concentration of 5 µg/mL followed by 1h
incubation on ice. The cells were washed with FACS buffer and incubated for 30 minutes on ice
in the dark with 1:400 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Invitrogen;
#A11055). The cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. Data were collected using a
BD LSR II flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo software (version 10).

Sample preparation for proteomic analysis
We infected cells grown to the confluency of 90-95% in 6-well plates with SARS-CoV-2 at
an MOI of 1. To synchronize virus entry into cells, the infection was carried out in a small volume
of Opti-MEM (400 µl per well) on ice for 1h, followed by removal of the virus inoculum, addition of
2 ml of DMEM containing 2% FBS, and incubation at 37ºC. To harvest cells, the culture medium
was removed and the cell monolayer was washed twice with 1X PBS, followed by cell scraping in

a lysis buffer comprising 6M GuHCl, 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 40 mM chloroacetamide and 10 mM
TCEP, supplemented with Complete Mini protease (Roche; #11836170001) and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktails (Roche; #04906837001). Lysates were boiled at 100°C for 15 min and sonicated
briefly. Total proteins were quantified via Bradford’s assay and normalized prior to digestion with
Trypsin (Pierce) at 1:50 ratio (enzyme to protein, w/w) overnight at 37°C. Digestion was quenched
with trifluoracetic acid and the peptides were desalted using Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters
Corporation; WAT054955). Desalted peptides were labeled with Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) using
TMTPro-16plex isobaric tags (ThermoFisher Scientific; #A44520) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Replicate samples corresponding to each time point for each cell line were labelled
separately. The TMT labelled peptides for the respective cell lines were then pooled, desalted,
and fractionated via basic reversed-phase fractionation using a mobile phase comprising 0.1%
NH4OH and varying acetonitrile concentrations (5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, 17.5%, 20%, 22.5%, 25%,
30%, 35%, 40% and 60%). For each cell line, two early (5% and 10%) fractions were orthogonally
concatenated with two late (40% and 60%) fractions resulting in total of 10 fractions per cell line
for analyses. All fractions were dried in SpeedVac Vacuum Concentrator (ThermoFisher
Scientific).

Mass spectrometry analysis
Dried samples were reconstituted in mobile phase A solvent (2% acetonitrile and 0.1%
formic acid) for analysis on the Q-Exactive™ HF-X mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific),
interfaced to the Easy nanoLC1200 HPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific). The peptides were
loaded on a reversed-phase nano-trap column in mobile phase A (75μm i.d. × 2 cm, Acclaim
PepMap100 C18 3μm, 100Å; ThermoFisher Scientific; # 164946) and separated over an EASY-

Spray column, (ThermoFisher Scientific; #ES803A) using a gradient (6% to 19% over 58 min,
then 19% to 36% over 34 min) of mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile) at a flow
rate of 250 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a spray voltage
of 2100 volts and the data was acquired in a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Precursor
scans were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 FWHM with a maximum injection time of 120 ms.
The top 12 abundant ions, with charge states ≥2, were selected for fragmentation by HCD
(collision energy 29%) and analyzed at a resolution of 45,000 FWHM with a maximum injection
time of 250 ms.

Analysis of raw mass spectrometry data
All raw data were processed using MaxQuant (Version 1.6.7.0). The acquired tandem
spectra were searched against the reference Homo sapiens proteome (Taxonomic ID: 9606)
FASTA file downloaded from UniProt on April 2017, concatenated with common contaminants
and SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences. TMT reporter ion quantification was performed on
MaxQuant using default settings. For searches, cysteine carbamido-methylation was specified as
fixed modification and oxidation of methionine and N-terminal protein acetylation were set as
variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and up to two missed cleavages were
allowed. The MaxQuant output file designated “ProteinGroups.txt” was used for data
normalization and statistical analyses using in-house generated scripts in the R environment.

Data analysis and pathway enrichment
Bioinformatic analysis was performed using R: A language and environment for Statistical
Computing (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. http://www.R-project.org),
version 3.6.1. The “ProteinGroups.txt” table corresponding to each cell line was filtered to

eliminate entries labelled as reverse hits, potential contaminants, and “only identified by site”.
Protein quantitation required at least 70% valid values across all TMT channels. The TMT intensity
values were log2 transformed and Loess-normalized. Differentially regulated proteins were
defined by implementing a log2 fold-change threshold of 0.25 for SARS-CoV-2 vs mock-infected
cells. Similar liberal thresholds have been previously described for TMT-based analyses owing to
ratio compression43. For functional enrichment of proteins based on clustering between the
respective time points, Enrichr was used with the Reactome database of pathways. For differential
analysis, the LIMMA44 R package was used to fit a linear model accounting for the infection versus
mock condition at each timepoint. Moderated t-tests were corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg
method for false discovery rate (FDR). Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the
fgsea R package (https://www.biorxiv.org/ content/early/2016/06/20/060012) using curated gene
libraries45 ranked lists where the gene rank is defined as -log(p value)*sign(log2 fold change)46.
In the case of duplicate proteins mapping to a common gene symbol, the one with the highest
absolute value rank was retained.

Differentiation of hiPSC into cardiomyocytes
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from the PGP1 parent line (Coriell Institute;
GM23338) engineered to have an endogenous green fluorescent protein tag on one titin allele47
were provided by the Seidman Lab. hiPSCs were seeded into tissue culture-treated plates coated
with Matrigel (ThermoFisher Scientific; #CB-40230) mixed 1:80 in DMEM/F-12 (ThermoFisher
Scientific; #11330-057), maintained in mTeSR1 (StemCell; #85870), and passaged using
Accutase (Sigma; #A6964) at 60-90% confluence.

hiPSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) by small-molecule,
monolayer-based manipulation of the Wnt-signaling pathway. Briefly, the cells were grown from
day 0 to day 9 in RPMI 1640/GlutaMAX medium (ThermoFisher Scientific; #61870036) containing
the insulin-free B-27 supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific; #A1895601). On day 0, the cells were
treated with 12 µM CHIR99021 (Tocris; #4423) for 24h to activate WNT signaling. Two days later
(on day 3), 5 µM IWP4 (Tocris; #5214) was added to the culture medium for 48h to block the WNT
signaling. On day 9, the culture medium was replaced with RPMI 1640/GlutaMAX medium
supplemented with insulin-containing B-27 supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific; #17504-044).
On day 11, metabolic selection of hiPSC-CMs was started by growing them in a glucose-free
RPMI 1640 medium (ThermoFisher Scientific; #11879020) containing 4 mM Sodium DL Lactate
solution (Sigma; #L426) for 4 days, replenishing the medium every 2 days.
Following metabolic selection, purified hiPSC-CMs were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsinEDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific; #25200114) containing 10 µg/ml DNase I (StemCell; #7469) and
re-plated into 12-well plates coated with 10 µg/ml human bulk fibronectin (ThermoFisher Scientific;
#3560) at a density of 750,000 cells/well. The replating medium comprised RPMI 1640 mixed with
the insulin-containing B-27 supplement, 2% fetal bovine serum (Sigma; #F0926), and 5 µM Y2763 (Tocris: #12543). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
insulin-containing B-27 until day 30-50, with the medium being replenished every two days. For
SARS-CoV-2 infection, hiPSC-CMs were seeded into either 96- or 12-well plates coated with 10
µg/ml fibronectin.

Interferon response assays

To test interferon response in uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we seeded cells
either in 6-well plates (for Western blot) at a density of 5 x 105 cells per well, in 12-well plates at
a density of 2 x 105 cells per well (for RT-qPCR), or in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 x 104 cells
per well (for IF). The next day, the cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 or left
uninfected. Twenty-four hours later, we treated the cells with different concentrations of IFN alpha2a for 15-30 min (for Western blot and IF) or for 1, 2, 4, and 8h (for RT-qPCR). The cells were
then processed for downstream applications.

Western blotting
Proteins from various cells were extracted with 1x RIPA buffer containing 1x complete-mini
protease inhibitor (Roche; #11836170001) and 1x phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche;
#04906837001). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 20
min at 4ºC. The supernatants were transferred to new ice-cold Eppendorf tubes and protein
concentration was measured by the BCA assay using Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific; #23225). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on 4-12% SDS-PAGE
gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Following staining with primary and secondary
(LiCor) antibodies, the bands were visualized by scanning the membrane with the LiCor CLx
infrared scanner. The intensity of protein bands was measured in the open source package,
ImageJ.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1: Most human cell lines supported no or minimal infection by SARS-CoV-2. a, The cell
lines and their tissues of origin are shown. The detailed description of each cell line is provided in
the table. b, The indicated cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 and stained with
the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein (red) at 24 and 72 hpi. The nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI. The mean percentage of positive cells ± standard deviation of three biological replicates is
shown. The cell names are colored differently according to their tissues of origin (n = 3). c, Total
abundance of ACE2 in cells and its cell surface-associated fraction was measured by Western
blot and flow cytometry, respectively. The shades of blue indicate the intensity of the ACE2 signal,
whereas the shades of red reflect the SARS-CoV-2 infection efficiency in each cell line. The data
of Western blot and flow cytometry experiments are presented in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Fig. 2: Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 synergistically enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection
of multiple cell lines. a, The cells were infected for 24h with VSV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV2 spike and the infection efficiency was monitored by flow cytometry for GFP, encoded by the
VSV genome. The mean ± standard deviation of triplicate samples is plotted. ND, not determined.
b, The cells were infected for 24h with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01 followed by IF analysis of
the viral N-protein (red). The nuclei were stained with DAPI. The mean percentage of positive
cells ± standard deviation of three biological replicates is shown (n = 3). ND, not determined.

Fig. 3: Global proteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells revealed several
differentially regulated proteins. a, Schematics of the proteomics pipeline. Total protein was
extracted from the SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected cells, trypsinized, and isotope (TMT)
labeled. The peptides for each cell line were separately pooled, fractionated, sequenced, and
quantified by LC-MS/MS. b, The cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 and
processed at 12h and 24 h (A549, Caco-2, and HuH-6) or at 8h and 12h (AC-16 and SK-N-SH)
for IF and proteomic analysis. The top panel shows the IF images (red color: viral N protein; blue
color: DAPI). The percentage of positive cells was measured and plotted as a mean ± standard
deviation of five microscopic fields (n = 5). The rhomboids show the total number of proteins
identified in uninfected and infected cells (lower left corner) as well as the total number of
regulated proteins in each cell line across both time points following SARS-CoV-2 infection (upper
right corner). Numbers of distinct proteins up- or down-regulated after infection are shown in the
bottom panel. In certain cases, the total numbers of up- and down-regulated proteins do not match
with the numbers shown in rhomboids. This is due to some proteins downregulated at one time

Fig. 4: Western blot confirmed the proteomic results. a, ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing A549,
Caco-2, HuH-6, AC-16, and SK-N-SH cells were infected with freshly prepared SARS-CoV-2 at
an MOI of 1. As a control, HuH-6 cells were infected with YFV 17D virus containing the NeonGreen
reporter (MOI of 1) and Caco-2 cells with CVB3 containing the GFP reporter. The cells were fixed
at the indicated times and processed for IF and/or imaging. b, The cells were lysed in a RIPA
buffer followed by the Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins. An equal amount of total
protein (25 µg), as quantified by the BCA assay, was loaded in each lane. The black arrows
indicate the protein bands of expected sizes. M, Mock.

by IF (left panel) and Western blot (right panel). The relative band intensities are shown. d,
Uninfected Caco-2 cells or the ones infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 1) for 24h were treated
with human IFN alpha-2a (1 nM) or, as a negative control, with vehicle (PBS) for 30 min, followed
by Western blot. The band intensities of the phospho-STATs were normalized against the total
STATs and plotted in the right panel as a percentage of uninfected cells. The data are presented
as mean ± standard deviation of two independent Western blots (n = 2). e, Uninfected or SARSCoV-2-infected Caco-2 cells (24 hpi) were treated with 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 nM of IFN alpha-2a for
30 min and subjected to Western blot. The band intensities from two independent Western blots,
calculated as in d, are presented as mean ± standard deviation in the right panel. The intensities
for untreated cells were set at 100, and the percent increase in IFN-treated cells was measured
by calculating the ratio between IFN-treated and untreated cells (n = 2). f, Caco-2 cells infected
with SARS-CoV-2 for 24h were exposed to 0.1 or 1 nM IFN alpha-2a for 30 min and stained for
the viral N protein (green) and STAT1 (red). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The nuclear
translocation of STAT1 is indicated with white arrowheads. g, Caco-2 cells, uninfected or infected
with SARS-CoV-2 for 24h, were treated with IFN (1 nM) for 1, 2, 4, or 8h and the RNA levels of
Viperin was measured by RT-qPCR. The values were normalized against RPS11 that served as
a housekeeping gene. The data are plotted as mean ± standard deviation of three biological
replicates (n = 3). h, hiPSC-CMs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 5 in the presence
of DMSO or 5 µM compounds. IF was performed at 12, 18, and 24 hpi and the number of positive
cells were counted by Muvicyte (see methods). The data are plotted as mean ± standard deviation
of three biological replicates (n = 3).

Fig. 6: Model of the JAK-STAT inhibition by SARS-CoV-2. Engagement of IFNs to their
receptors causes receptor dimerization, bringing JAKs attached to the cytoplasmic side of the
receptors into close proximity. The JAKs then phosphorylate each other through a process called
transphosphorylation, leading to their activation. The activated JAKs phosphorylate STAT
proteins, which then form hetero- or homo-dimers and recruit interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)
to make a trimolecular complex, called ISGF3, that translocates to the nucleus to induce
expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs create an antiviral
environment in the cell leading to elimination of the replicating virus and inhibition of new viral
invasions. SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the JAK-STAT pathway at multiple steps indicated with red
inhibition arcs. The ultimate effect of this inhibition is a blunted antiviral response unable to tackle
the virus.
