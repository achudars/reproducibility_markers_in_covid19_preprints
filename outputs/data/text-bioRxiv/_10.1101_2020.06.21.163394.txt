Abstract

45

Four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with acute respiratory

46

infection in humans. B cell responses to these “common cold” viruses remain incompletely

47

understood. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of CoV-specific antibody repertoires in

48

231 children and 1168 adults using phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing. Seroprevalence

49

of antibodies to endemic HCoVs ranged between ~4 and 27% depending on the species and

50

cohort. We identified at least 136 novel linear B cell epitopes. Antibody repertoires against

51

endemic HCoVs were qualitatively different between children and adults in that anti-HCoV

52

IgG specificities more frequently found among children targeted functionally important and

53

structurally conserved regions of the spike, nucleocapsid and matrix proteins. Moreover,

54

antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved fusion peptide region and S2’ cleavage

55

site of the spike protein were broadly cross-reactive with peptides of epidemic human and

56

non-human coronaviruses. In contrast, an acidic tandem repeat in the N-terminal region of

57

the Nsp3 subdomain of the HCoV-HKU1 polyprotein was the predominant target of antibody

58

responses in adult donors. Our findings shed light on the dominant species-specific and pan-

59

CoV target sites of human antibody responses to coronavirus infection, thereby providing

60

important insights for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies

61

and vaccine design.

Introduction

63

Four endemic human-tropic coronaviruses (HCoVs) are commonly associated with respiratory

64

illness in humans, namely HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 [1-4]. Clinical outcomes of

65

acute infection with these HCoVs range from mild upper respiratory tract infections in most

66

patients, to viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia in rare patients, the latter requiring

67

hospitalization [5]. The ratio of more severe versus mild outcomes of acute infection with

68

endemic HCoVs is largely comparable to that of other “common cold” viruses, such as human

69

respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), human adenoviruses (HAdVs),

70

and human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), albeit with differences in seasonality and

71

prevalence of the viruses depending on the species [5-7]. In addition to the four endemic

72

HCoV, three human-tropic epidemic coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged over the last two

73

decades, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) [8], Middle

74

East Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [9], and SARS-CoV-2 [10], the

75

etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has now reached pandemic

76

proportions [11]. Similar to endemic HCoVs, infection of humans with epidemic CoVs is

77

associated with a wide range of outcomes but leads more frequently to severe clinical

78

manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12-14]. Phylogenetic

79

analyses suggest that, similar to these epidemic CoVs, all endemic HCoVs are of zoonotic

80

origin and their possible ancestors share similar natural animal reservoirs and intermediate

81

hosts [6]. HCoV-229E may have been transferred from dromedary camels, similar to MERS-

82

CoV, while HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged more recently from ancestors in domestic

83

animals such as cattle or swine in the context of a pandemic at the end of the 19th century

84

[6, 15].

85
86

The wide variability in transmissibility and clinical manifestations of infections by endemic

87

and epidemic CoVs among humans remains poorly understood. On the population level, the

88

case-fatality rate is highest for MERS (~34 - 37%) and several risk factors are associated with

89

progression to ARDS in MERS, SARS and COVID-19 cases, including old age, diabetes mellitus,

90

hypertension, cancer, renal and lung disease, and co-infections [12, 16]. Nonetheless, even

91

MERS-CoV infection among humans can run a completely asymptomatic course in some

92

cases, particularly among children [17-19]. There is evidence that children are generally less

93

susceptible to infection with epidemic CoVs and once infected, they are less likely to

94

experience severe outcomes compared to adults, although this important association and the

95

underlying reasons remain poorly understood [12, 18, 20, 21]. Importantly, it remains unclear

96

to what extent pre-existing immunity from past infections with endemic HCoVs provides

97

some degree of cross-protection and affects clinical outcomes of infection with the epidemic

98

SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. Our overall understanding of the immunity induced by natural

99

infection with endemic HCoVs remains very limited. Serological studies have shown some

100

degree of cross-reactive antibodies in patients with past CoV infections but many of these

101

studies were limited in sample size and often focused on specific viral antigens only [22-25].

102

Depending on their binding affinity and specificities, such cross-reactive antibodies could

103

either have no effect on clinical outcomes, may provide protection from severe disease to

104

some degree, or may lead to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease—the latter can be

105

a major obstacle in vaccine development [26]. Interestingly, two recent studies from

106

independent groups have shown that a considerable proportion of individuals without a

107

history of SARS-CoV-2 infection have SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, which suggests that cross-

108

reactive T cell subsets originating from past infections by endemic HCoVs may play a role in

109

the clinical course of infection with the phylogenetically related epidemic CoVs [27, 28]. A

110

systematic assessment to elucidate the immunodominant B cell antigen determinants of

111

endemic HCoVs has not been done. We hypothesized that a fraction of the general population

112

also have antibodies generated during past encounters with ‘common cold’ coronaviruses

113

that cross-react with proteins of epidemic CoVs. This may affect the dynamics of sporadic

114

MERS outbreaks that mostly occur in the Middle East, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Results

116

To gain a deeper insight into human antibody responses to endemic HCoVs, we performed

117

phage-immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) [29-31] on previously collected serum or

118

plasma samples obtained from a total of 1431 human subjects from three different cohorts.

119

These included i) healthy male adult blood donors (ABD) with diverse ethnic background and

120

nationality (Supplementary Figure S1A); ii) adult male and female participants of a national

121

cohort study—the Qatar Biobank (QBB) [32]—representing the general population

122

(Supplementary Figure S1B); and iii) pediatric outpatients and inpatients who were tested for

123

metabolic conditions unrelated to infection, chronic disease or cancer (Methods and

124

Supplementary Figure S1C). The samples were collected prior to the current COVID-19

125

outbreak (Methods). In brief, PhIP-Seq allowed us to obtain comprehensive antiviral antibody

126

repertoires across individuals in our three human cohorts using phage display of

127

oligonucleotide-encoded peptidomes, followed by immunoprecipitation and massive parallel

128

sequencing [29, 31]. The VirScan phage library used for PhIP-Seq in the present study

129

comprised peptides derived from viral proteins—each represented by peptide tiles of up to

130

56 amino acids in length that overlap by 28 amino acids—which collectively encompass the

131

proteomes of a large number of viral species, including HCoV-229E, -NL63, -HKU1 and -OC43

132

[29, 31]. Proteins of endemic HCoVs which were represented in the VirScan phage library

133

included the Orf1ab replicase polyprotein (pp1ab), the spike glycoprotein (S), the matrix

134

glycoprotein (M), the nucleocapsid protein (N) and gene products of the species- and strain-

135

specific open reading frames (ORFs) encoded in the 3’ region of the viral genomes

136

(Supplementary Table S1). Of note, we utilized an expanded version of the VirScan phage

137

library [33, 34], which also encompassed peptides from a number of proteins of human

138

epidemic and non-human CoV isolates, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, as well as bat, bovine,

139

porcine and feline isolates belonging to the alpha- and betacoronavirus genera, albeit with

140

varying coverage of the viral peptidomes owing to the limitation in available sequence data

141

for the latter isolates in UniProt (Supplementary Table S1). SARS-CoV-2 peptides were not

142

included in the VirScan phage library used in our study.

143
144

We were able to obtain antibody repertoires for a total of 1399 individuals from the human

145

cohorts described above (Supplementary Table S2). Using stringent filter criteria (Methods),

146

we identified a total of 417 out of 2498 peptides and potential antigens from endemic HCoVs

147

with our screen that were significantly enriched in at least three of all 1399 analyzed

148

individuals. A total of 103 peptides from endemic HCoV were enriched in ³ 1% of the samples

149

and therefore considered to contain potentially immunodominant regions (Supplementary

150

Table S3). Only 33 of the 417 peptides enriched in at least three samples shared linear

151

sequence homology with epitopes that have previously been reported [35] (Supplementary

152

Figure S2). To estimate number of newly identified linear B cell epitopes, we assigned each

153

CoV-derived peptide to clusters of peptides that share ³ 7 amino acids linear sequence

154

identity—the estimated size of a linear B cell epitope (Methods). The enriched peptides could

155

be assigned to 149 clusters for which at least 2 peptides share linear sequence identity of ³ 7

156

amino acids (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Only 13 clusters also shared ³ 7 amino acids

157

linear sequence identity with known linear B cell epitopes. Consequently, we have identified

158

a minimum of 136 new linear epitopes, including 25 new immunodominant linear B cell

159

epitopes [i.e. B cell epitopes targeted in at least ³ 1% of all individuals and not already

160

reported in IEBD (www.iebd.org) [35] (Supplementary Tables S3)].

161
162

Next we assessed the seroprevalence of HCoV-229E, -NL63, -HKU1 and -OC43 in the three

163

cohorts separately. To do so, we imputed species score values as described earlier [31, 33,

164

36] by counting the significantly enriched peptides for a given HCoV species that share less

165

than 7 amino acids linear sequence identity. We considered an individual seropositive for any

166

of the endemic HCoVs if the number of non-homologous peptides enriched in a given sample

167

met our previously established species-specific cut-off value (Methods). Seroprevalence for

168

endemic HCoVs ranged from ~4% to ~27%, depending on the species and cohort (Figure 1A).

169

Interestingly, we found a marginal but significant negative association between age and

170

seroprevalence of HCoV-OC43 (b = -0.175) and -NL63 (b = -0.315) (Figure 1B and 1D), as well

171

as a marginal positive association between male gender and seroprevalence for any of the

172

endemic HCoVs (b £ 0.2) (Figure 1C and 1D). The species score values (i.e. the antibody

173

repertoire breadth for each HCoV species) did not differ substantially between seropositive

174

individuals of our 3 cohorts (Supplementary Figure S3). However, principal component

175

analysis revealed considerable qualitative differences in the antibody repertoires between

176

our cohorts and in particular between pediatric and adult subjects (Figure 2A). For

7

177

comparison, we also performed the same analysis on enriched peptides from other common

178

respiratory viruses, including HRSV, HRV A, HRV B and influenza B virus. As expected,

179

seroprevalence was considerably higher (68% to 99%) for HRSV, HRV A and HRV B, and

180

somewhat higher (29% to 47%) for influenza B virus (Supplementary Figure S4A). However,

181

contrary to antiviral antibody responses to endemic HCoVs, we did not find considerable

182

variance in the antibody repertoires to other respiratory viruses when comparing age groups

183

and cohorts (Supplementary Figure S4B). We also analyzed the enriched antigenic peptides

184

for each endemic HCoV species separately and found that most variance in the antibody

185

repertoires between cohorts and age groups were attributable to past infections with HCoV-

186

HKU1 and -229E (Supplementary Figure S4C). To determine the antibody specificities

187

responsible for most of the variance in the antiviral response to endemic HCoVs between

188

adults and children (i.e. to identify those peptides that were significantly more or less

189

frequently enriched when comparing adult and pediatric donors), we applied Fisher's exact

190

test and computed odds ratios for each of the significantly enriched peptides. We found that

191

antibody specificities in samples of pediatric study subjects predominantly targeted different

192

antigenic regions in the S protein (mean log odds ratio = 3.35 ± 2.12), the N protein (mean log

193

odds ratio = 2.21 ± 1.41) and diverse antigenic sites in pp1ab, whereas peptides encoding a

194

single linear B cell epitope of pp1ab (cluster 22) appeared to be the predominant target of

195

IgG antibodies among adult donors (mean log odds ratio = -4.7 ± 1.16 ) (Figure 2B and Table

196

1).

197
198

Intriguingly, multiple sequence alignments of frequently enriched peptides with the full-

199

length proteins of various CoVs revealed that antibody specificities predominantly found in

200

pediatric study subjects target immunodominant epitopes that encode functionally important

201

and highly conserved regions of the structural proteins. These included regions in the S1

202

subunit of the S protein which are important for receptor binding (Figure 3A-C and 3F) [37-

203

40], as well as the regions resembling the proteolytic cleavage sites and fusion peptide of the

204

S2 subunit (Figures 3A, 3B, 3D-F). Of note, the immunodominant region spanning the furin-

205

like S2’ cleavage site in the S2 subunit resembles one of the most conserved regions of the S

206

protein, both in amino acid sequence (R¯SA[I/L]ED[I/L]LF) (Figure 3E) and in protein structure,

207

as it forms an accessible alpha-helix within the fusion peptide region (Figure 3F and

8

208

Supplementary Figure S6) [41]. Moreover, we identified potential antibody binding sites in

209

the N-terminal RNA binding domain, serine-rich region and in the C-terminal dimerization

210

domain of the N protein (Figures 4A and 4B). Although the predicted antibody binding sites

211

in the N-terminal RNA-binding domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain of the N

212

protein appeared to be less conserved between different species in the primary amino acid

213

sequence (Figure 4C and 4D), both domains are structurally conserved in the regions that we

214

found to be immunodominant (Figure 4E and 4F). We also found that antibodies in children

215

targeted more frequently the C-terminal domain of the M protein (Supplementary Figure S5C

216

and Table 1) and the small accessory Orf8 protein (also known as N2) of HCoV-HKU1 (Table

217

1). Although Orf8 and N share the same coding sequence in the viral RNA genome, the reading

218

frame is different and the amino acid sequences not homologous. On the contrary, antibody

219

specificities predominantly found in adults primarily targeted a region of the pp1ab that is

220

specific to HCoV-HKU1 and contains an acidic tandem repeat (NDDE[D/H]VVTGD) which is

221

located upstream of the papain-like protease 1 domain (Supplementary Figure S5D).

222
223

Given the high degree of sequence conservation among some of the immunodominant

224

regions in proteins of endemic HCoVs we have identified, we also explored the extent to

225

which antibody specificities to these regions cross-react with peptides from epidemic CoVs

226

and non-human CoV isolates. For this purpose, we assessed the enrichment of peptides

227

derived from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as bovine, porcine, bat and feline CoV isolates

228

(Supplementary Table S1) applying the same approach and stringent filter criteria as

229

described above, for peptides of endemic HCoVs. Indeed, we identified several S protein- and

230

N protein-derived peptides from epidemic CoVs or non-human isolates that were significantly

231

enriched in our PhIP-Seq assay, which share sequence similarity with peptides from HCoVs

232

(Figure 5). As expected based on the results from multiple sequence alignments described

233

above, antibody specificities targeting the highly conserved amino acid motif

234

(RSA[I/L]ED[I/L]LF) spanning the furin-like S2’ cleavage site of the S protein were broadly

235

cross-reactive to several orthologous peptides from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and non-human

236

CoV isolates (Figure 5A, Region 3). Cross-reactivity of antibodies targeting other functionally

237

important but less conserved regions of the S protein also appeared to be more restricted

238

(Figure 5A, Region 1 and 2). Antibody specificities targeting the N protein also showed

239

considerable cross-reactivity with peptides from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and non-human CoV

240

isolates. However, the latter cross-reactive antibodies mainly targeted regions rich in serine

241

and arginine residues, with low-complexity sequences and very limited structural

242

conservation, particularly an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at the N terminus of the N

243

protein (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure 7) that lacks a tertiary structure [42]. We also

244

detected cross-reactive antibodies targeting the serine- and arginine-rich linker region of the

245

N protein; however, cross-reactivity to this region was largely restricted to peptides derived

246

from non-human CoV isolates of domestic animals (Figure 5B) which are more closely related

247

to HCoV-OC43 [6].

248
249

Finally, we assessed plasma samples of a previously healthy 49-year-old female adult patient

250

who suffered from severe ARDS from SARS-CoV-2 infection, requiring prolonged

251

hospitalization and intensive care. A first sample was obtained 25 days after onset of

252

symptoms and 18 days after ICU admission. A second sample was obtained one month later,

253

one week after discharge. We compared the antibody profiles at both time points to samples

254

obtained from uninfected family members of the patient, as well as an age- and gender-

255

matched unrelated control. In agreement with what we found in some subjects with a history

256

of endemic HCoV infection, the patient with severe COVID-19 had detectable antibodies that

257

cross-reacted with peptides from SARS-CoV and non-human CoVs encoding the furin-like S2’

258

cleavage site and heptad repeat 2 region of the S protein, peptides from the C-terminal region

259

of the HCoV-HKU1 N protein downstream of the dimerization domain, as well as two antigenic

260

sites of the MERS-CoV pp1a (Supplementary Figure S8).

Discussion

262

Our comprehensive and systematic screen for antiviral antibody repertoires across individuals

263

in three human cohorts revealed a large number of peptides with novel linear B cell epitopes

264

in several proteins of endemic HCoVs. This is not surprising given that epidemic CoVs, and in

265

particular SARS-CoV, have been the primary focus of previous immunological and epitope

266

screening studies [35, 43]. Information about the targets of immune responses to CoVs across

267

different species provides a valuable resource for the prediction of candidate targets of newly

268

emerging CoVs, as recently shown by Grifoni et al. [43]. The authors were able to identify a

269

priori, several specific regions of the S, M and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of

270

sequence homology to the SARS-CoV virus which are orthologous to several of the

271

immunodominant regions of endemic HCoVs we identified. We detected antibodies against

272

the structural S, N, M and Orf8 proteins, as well as the non-structural pp1ab polyprotein of

273

HCoVs; the latter resembling the precursor for the large viral replicase complex [44].

274

Interestingly, in another independent study, Grifoni et al. [28] recently reported similarly

275

broad T cell responses in COVID-19 patients by employing an analogous screen for T cell

276

epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins using peptide ‘‘megapools’’ in combination with ex vivo T

277

cell assays.

278
279

Surprisingly, circulating IgG antibodies in children appear to be differentially targeting

280

structural and non-structural proteins of HCoVs in comparison to adults (Figure 2). Whereas

281

antibody specificities more frequently found in samples of pediatric subjects targeted

282

structural proteins such as the S, N and M proteins, in adult donors, a region of the non-

283

structural polyprotein pp1ab containing an acidic tandem repeat (NDDE[D/H]VVTGD) in

284

HCoV-HKU1 appeared to be the predominant target of IgG antibodies. The latter polyprotein

285

is post-translationally processed into up to 16 subunits that form a large viral replicase

286

complex; however, the function of the acidic tandem repeat and its role in pathogenesis

287

remains unknown [44]. This qualitative difference in the antibody repertoires of adult versus

288

pediatric subjects appeared to be a specific characteristic of natural HCoV infection, as we did

289

not find the same degree of variance in the antibody repertoires specific to other common

290

respiratory viruses when comparing our cohorts and different age groups (Supplementary

291

Figure S3). We speculate that the qualitative differences in antibody repertoires of adult

292

versus children reflect a higher frequency and/or more recent exposures of children to

293

seasonal coronaviruses than adults, coupled with the rapid decay of circulating anti-CoV

294

antibodies that target the structural proteins of the virions. Further studies will be needed to

295

fully understand the dynamics of antibody responses to endemic HCoVs.

296
297

Evidence for the transient and dynamic nature of humoral immunity to endemic HCoVs has

298

been provided by number of human serological studies, although many of them were

299

conducted with only a limited number of subjects, or only for selected species, and a variety

300

of antibody detection methods were used that are not readily comparable [45-52].

301

Nevertheless, evidence suggests that a sizable proportion of children experience primary

302

infection with endemic HCoVs during their first year of life and nearly all children have

303

encountered at least one of the endemic HCoVs before two years of age, indicating that first

304

exposure to endemic HCoVs occurs very early in life, similar to other common respiratory

305

viruses such as HRSV or HRVs [46, 50, 51]. However, reported seroprevalence rates in older

306

children and adults vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, including age and viral

307

species. There is a general trend indicating that humoral immunity from primary infection

308

with endemic HCoVs wanes quickly and that antibodies detected in older children and adults

309

are rather a consequence of more recent re-infections [45-49]. We estimated the

310

seroprevalence of antibodies to endemic HCoVs to range between ~4% and ~27% depending

311

on the species and cohort (Figure 1A-C). Given that endemic HCoV infections are common

312

and usually acquired during early childhood [46, 47, 50, 51], it is likely that not only the adult

313

subjects, but also many (if not all) of the children aged 7 to 15 years that were assessed in our

314

study, have already experienced multiple infections with endemic HCoVs in their lifetime.

315

Therefore, our estimated seroprevalence rates likely reflect the complex dynamics between

316

rates of (re-)infection and waning humoral immunity over time. In agreement with this

317

notion, age was negatively associated with seroprevalence in our study, suggesting that the

318

duration of immunity in response to natural infection with endemic HCoVs and/or rates of re-

319

infection reduce with increasing age. The dynamics of humoral immunity from past CoV

320

infections is best described in studies of MERS and SARS patients. Although limited in sample

321

size, these studies have shown that antibody titers in all previously infected individuals

322

decline relatively quickly to minimal detectable levels over a period of 2 to 3 years and that

323

patients who suffered from more severe disease had higher and longer-lasting total binding

324

antibody titers and neutralizing titers [52]. There is also evidence that symptomatic COVID-

325

19 patients mount robust antibody responses that wane very quickly over a period of 6

326

months [53]. However, the same study suggeted that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells

327

may be sustained over a longer period of time [53]. Indeed, most acute virus infections induce

328

some level of protective and long-term immunity, albeit through a variety of mechanisms that

329

are not necessarily the same for each pathogen and may even differ between hosts due to a

330

variety of factors, including simultaneous viral coinfection [54, 55]. We also found a marginal

331

but significant positive association between seroprevalence of endemic HCoVs and male

332

gender, which is consistent with an earlier report by Gaunt et al. [5].

333
334

Despite the variable degree of sequence conservation between different CoV species, the

335

results of our systematic antibody screen highlight that the structural proteins of the virions

336

share common antigenic sites. Indeed, several of the immunodominant regions we have

337

identified experimentally in the structural proteins of endemic HCoVs are orthologous to the

338

regions thought to be immunodominant targets for immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 [43]

339

(Supplementary Figure S8), including two linear epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that

340

elicit potent neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients [56]. Importantly, antigenic regions

341

that we found to be immunodominant in our study (i.e. enriched in ³ 1% of all samples), as

342

well as those corresponding to peptides for which enrichment was strongly and significantly

343

associated with pediatric subjects (odds ratio ³ 2; P-value £ 0.005, Fisher’s exact test),

344

mapped to functionally important regions of the structural CoV proteins. These included

345

regions for receptor binding and the proteolytic cleavage sites of the S protein, as well as the

346

N-terminal RNA-binding and C-terminal dimerization domains of the N protein, which have

347

been shown to be critical for virus attachment and entry, cell-to-cell fusion and virus

348

replication, respectively [42, 57-61]. The region of the S1 subunit responsible for receptor

349

binding differs considerably between CoV species, which utilize different domains and host

350

cell receptors, and consequently differ in their tissue tropism [38-41, 47, 62]. However, the S2

351

subunit resembling the fusion machinery is more conserved, both structurally and in amino

352

acid sequence [39, 63] (Supplementary Figure S6). Indeed, we identified an immunodominant

353

and highly conserved linear epitope immediately downstream of the furin-like S2’ cleavage

354

site of the S protein (R¯SA[I/L]ED[I/L]LF) that likely resembles the fusion peptide, although its

355

precise location has been disputed [64]. The same antigenic site has recently been found on

356

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to elicit neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients [56]. The high

357

degree of amino acid sequence and conformational conservation of the alpha-helical region

358

immediately adjacent to the S2’ cleavage site (Figures 3E and 3F) likely explains why

359

antibodies targeting this region also cross-reacted with orthologous peptides of related CoVs

360

in our study, including that of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and non-human isolates, further

361

supporting our overall hypothesis and the important role of this particular region as a pan-

362

CoV target site [41, 56]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that at least in some individuals,

363

past infections with endemic HCoVs have elicited cross-reactive antibodies and/or led to the

364

generation of longer-lived memory B cells with specific reactivity to this linear epitope, which

365

may provide cross-protection against MERS or COVID-19. This may be the case particularly

366

among children which are generally less likely to experience severe disease outcomes from

367

infection with epidemic CoVs [17-19, 21]. This will require further investigation.

368
369

Broadly cross-reactive antibody responses are also known for other enveloped RNA viruses,

370

which may positively or negatively affect subsequent infection or vaccination. Flaviviruses for

371

example, are antigenically related and broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies from

372

previous yellow fever vaccination has been shown to impair and modulate immune responses

373

to tick-borne encephalitis vaccination [65]. Similarly, immune history has been shown to

374

profoundly affect protective B cell responses to influenza [66]. Since we detected pan-CoV

375

cross-reactive antibodies less frequently in plasma samples from adult donors, our results

376

argue against a strong therapeutic benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin products to control

377

the spread of COVID-19 disease [67]. In this context, it should be noted that large-scale

378

antibody screening by PhIP-Seq may frequently fail to detect conformational and post-

379

translationally modified B cell epitopes [29]. Nontheless, we found anti-CoV antibodies in

380

plasma of a COVID-19 patient after prolonged hospitalization and intensive care that targeted

381

largely the same structurally conserved and functionally important regions of the viral N and

382

S proteins (Supplementary Figure S8) as those that we detected in a sizable proportion of

383

children, including antibodies binding to the highly conserved motif and furin-like S2’ cleavage

384

site (R¯SA[I/L]ED[I/L]LF), which provides further evidence for the clinical benefit of using

385

convalescent plasma for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 [68-70]. Our findings may

386

also have important implications for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic

387

monoclonal antibodies and vaccine design in the context of COVID-19 [43, 71].

388

Methods

389

Study design and samples. We performed a retrospective analysis of deidentified or coded

390

plasma and serum samples collected from three different human cohorts, namely: i) 400

391

healthy male adult blood donors (ABD) of a blood bank in Qatar with diverse ethnic

392

background and nationality (Supplementary Figure S1A); ii) 800 adult male and female Qatari

393

nationals and long-term residents of Qatar who are participating in a national cohort study—

394

the Qatar Biobank (QBB)—and who represent the general local population in the State of

395

Qatar [32]; and iii) 231 pediatric subjects with Qatari nationality who were admitted to, or

396

visited outpatient clinics of, Sidra Medicine. Leftover plasma samples from healthy blood bank

397

donors were collected from 2012 to 2016, de-identified and stored at -80oC. For the purpose

398

of this study, specimen from male Qatari nationals 19 to 66 years of age (Supplementary Table

399

S1) were selected from a larger blood donor cohort including 5983 individuals, and then age-

400

matched male donors with other nationalities were randomly selected (Supplementary Figure

401

S1). Samples from female blood bank donors were excluded because they were largely

402

underrepresented in the blood bank donor cohort. We also excluded samples for which age,

403

gender or nationality information was lacking. Serum samples from the QBB cohort were

404

collected from 2012 to 2017 and were randomly selected samples from the first 3000

405

individuals taking part in a longitudinal cohort study as described previously [32]. Plasma

406

samples from pediatric patients were selected from leftovers of samples processed in the

407

clinical chemistry labs of Sidra Medicine, a tertiary care hospital for children and women in

408

Doha, Qatar, over a period of several months from September to November 2019. In order to

409

select appropriate pediatric samples, electronic medical records were queried using Discern

410

analytics to identify blood samples from Qatari nationals aged 7 to 15 years for whom basic

411

metabolic panel (BMP) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) testing was done in the

412

previous week. Samples from oncology patients, patients requiring complex care and those

413

in intensive care units, as well as samples from patients with chronic diseases, samples with

414

no centile data and samples from patients who were underweight (centile <5%) or overweight

415

were excluded. However, we included obese patients in our analysis, since a considerable

416

proportion of Qatari nationals are overweight. The COVID-19 patient assessed in this study

417

was a previously healthy female Belgian national with autosomal recessive IRF7 deficiency

418

who developed ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection at the age of 49 [72]. For comparison,

419

we also assessed unexposed family members, including the father, mother, brother

420

(heterozygous carriers) and wild-type sister, as well as an unrelated age- and gender-matched

421

healthy control. The human subject research described here had been approved by the

422

institutional research ethics boards of Sidra Medicine, Qatar Biobank, INSERM, and Erasme

423

Hospital.

424
425

Phage Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (PhIP-Seq). Large scale serological profiling of the

426

antiviral IgG repertoires in the individual serum or plasma samples was performed as

427

described by Xu el al. [31]. Each serum or plasma sample was tested in duplicate and samples

428

were analyzed in batches with up to 96 samples per batch. Only samples that satisfied a

429

minimum read count of 1*106 as well as a Pearson correlation coefficient of ³ 0.7 in the two

430

technical repeats were considered for downstream analysis. Data from thirty individuals of

431

the ABD cohort and two individuals of the QBB cohort were excluded from the downstream

432

analysis due to insufficient sequencing read depth, low sequencing data quality or because

433

one of two technical replicates had failed (data not shown).

434
435

Peptide enrichment analysis. To filter for enriched peptides, we first imputed −log10(P)

436

values as described previously [31, 33, 36] by fitting a zero-inflated generalized Poisson model

437

to the distribution of output counts and regressed the parameters for each peptide sequence

438

based on the input read count. We considered a peptide enriched if it passed a reproducibility

439

threshold of 2.3 [−log10(P)] in two technical sample replicates. To remove sporadic hits, we

440

then filtered for antibody specificities to CoV peptides that were found to be enriched in at

441

least three of all 1399 subjects assayed and analyzed in this study. We computed species-

442

specific significance cut-off values to estimate minimum number of enriched, non-

443

homologous peptides required in order to consider a sample as seropositive using a

444

generalized linear model and in-house serological (ELISA) data from pooled samples that were

445

tested positive for various viruses. We then computed virus score values as described by Xu

446

et al [31] by counting enriched, non-homologous peptides for a given species and then

447

adjusted these score values by dividing them with the estimated score cutoff. For the purpose

448

of this study and under consideration of the seroprevalence of endemic HCoVs in our three

449

cohorts, we considered a peptide to be immunodominant if it was enriched in ³ 1% of all 1399

450

subjects assayed and analyzed in this study.

451
452

Association studies and differential enrichment analysis. We applied a generalized linear

453

model to test for associations between the HCoV species-specific adjusted score values,

454

gender and age. We considered an association to be significant if the P-value was £ 0.001. We

455

examined the frequency distribution of enriched peptides among samples of the different age

456

groups (PED versus ABD + QBB) by estimating odds ratios (OR) and associated P-values using

457

Fisher’s exact test. Peptides that satisfied both significance (P-value £ 0.005) and magnitude

458

criteria (|log(OR)| ³ log(2)) were considered to be differentially enriched. Positive log(OR)

459

values indicated more frequent peptide enrichment among pediatric study subjects, whereas

460

negative log(OR) values indicated more frequent peptide enrichment among adult subjects.

461
462

Clustering of peptides for shared linear B cell epitopes. To estimate the minimum number

463

of linear B cell epitopes among the enriched peptides, we built a pairwise distance matrix that

464

captured the maximum size of linear sequence identity of amino acids (di,j) between all

465

enriched peptides. Groups of peptides that shared ³ seven amino acid linear sequence

466

identity (di,j ³ 7) were assigned to a cluster. Peptides of a given cluster were considered to

467

share a linear B cell epitope (Supplementary Figure S7).

468
469

Software. Open source Python modules with in-house scripts were used to test for

470

associations (statsmodel v0.11), to filter differentially enrichment peptides and to perform

471

different statistical tests (sklearn v0.23, scipy v1.14.1). Multiple sequence alignments were

472

done using the MAFFT [73, 74] via EMBL-EBI’s web services and Java Alignment Viewer

473

(Jalview) for visualization [75]. Residue-wise linear B cell epitopes were predicted using

474

BepiPred-2.0 [76]. Protein structures graphics were generated using PyMOL (Schrödinger).
