Abstract
Nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in downregulation of RIG-I
pathways and interacts with 40 S ribosome. Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with
40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has
not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been
studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal
region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments.
The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used
alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using
CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational
change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of
neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role
of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1.
The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies,
which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and
TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result,
fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational
dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly

because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented
through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and
testify our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will
have implications in disorder based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.

1. Introduction
Among four genera of coronaviruses (CoVs), alpha and beta are able to infect humans. CoVs
have single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, of which, the two-third part (~20kb) is
translated into two large polyproteins named pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins encode
sixteen non-structural proteins (NSP1–NSP16), which make up the viral replication-transcription
complex (1, 2). The very interesting feature among the four CoVs genera is presence of NSP1,
which is present only in alpha- and beta-genera of CoVs (3). This feature may correlate with the
pathogenicity of CoV as alpha and beta are highly pathogenic than the gamma and delta genera
(3). The NMR structure of SARS-CoV Nsp1 showed that N- and the C-terminal domains are
disordered with β-barrel fold in between (4). However, it is stated that the SARS-CoV NSP1
does not possess any enzymatic activity. The NSP1 have been found to downregulate the
immune function of host cells through RIG-1 signaling pathway (5, 6). Also, NSP1 bound with
the 40S ribosomal subunit and degrade the host mRNA (6, 7). SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 along with
NSP3, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, ORF3, ORF6 and M protein are found to inhibit the Sendai
virus-induced IFN-β promoter activation (8). Moreover, the NSP1 size varies among different
lineage of beta-CoVs, and share different degree of amino acid sequence similarity (3, 6).
Despite of the different amino acid composition, the high structural similarity of NSP1 found to
regulate the same feature in all genera of alpha and beta-CoV (9).
For a period of time bioinformatics studies show the penetrance of IDPs in viruses and all
domain of life from bacteria to eukaryotes (10–14). Recently, bioinformatics based study by our
group showed that NSP1 of SARS-CoV-2 regions (amino acids 137-145 and 172-179) are
identified as a molecular recognition feature (MoRFs) region (2). Generally, most of IDPs are
unfolded in solution and switch to a conformation when bind with particular ligands and undergo
coupled folding and binding (15–18). The IDPs capabilities to participate in multiple cellular

signaling lies in their structural amenability, which can be relate to the presence of MoRFs and
their kinetics advantages (19–23). Therefore, the molecular interactions of IDPs are fugitive and
dynamic, which allow them to compete and exchange the binding partners in function regulating
proteins. Given the fact that the NSP1 majorly affect the host protein, and intracellular
environment is highly crowded (19, 24, 25). Therefore, the impact of surrounding environment
on the conformational behavior of NSP1-CTR need to be addressed to assess its disorderfunction paradigm, which eventually lead us to understand the interaction mechanistic with
respective partners. Furthermore, given the earlier prediction that the C-terminal region of NSP1
has molecular recognition features, so it is important to investigate the folding propensity in the
presence of lipids. We should ask these questions in terms of an IDP folding behavior. It is
important as what conformational changes this NSP1 CTR can adopt upon interaction with
synthetic membrane environments such as liposomes? What about the conformational propensity
in presence of organic solvents? What is the impact of temperature on this peptide? To answer
these questions, in the present study, structural conformations of SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 with
respect to C-terminal disordered regions is explored in different experimental condition, which
gives a deeper insight to structural conformation in respective environment.
2. Material and methods
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
The NSP1 peptide (residues 130–180), corresponding to the C-terminal regions with purity>82%
was purchased from Genescript, USA. Organic solvents such as Trifluoroethanol (TFE) with

≥99% purity was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lyophilized peptide was dissolved in ultrapure water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.
2.2 Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of NSP1
The full length and aligned sequences fasta files were obtained after blastp search. The
phylogenetic tree was constructed to locate the taxonomic position of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1
using MEGA analysis tool v5. Further, the NSP1 (50 residues) were studied with Clustal Omega
tool to reveal their conserved sequences and represented with the help of ESPript 3.0.

was retrieved from the UniProt (ID: P0DTC1.1). As described earlier by our group, protein
intrinsic disorder predictor, PONDR® VSL2 was used for analysis of intrinsic disorder
properties of NSP1-CTR (2, 13, 14, 19, 26, 27). The secondary structure predisposition analysis
for NSP1-CTR was performed with several different web-servers pep2d, Jpred4, and PSIPRED
(28–30).
2.4 Liposome preparation
The liposome were prepared as described earlier (19). Briefly, the neutral lipid DOPC (dioleoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine) and negatively charged lipid DOPS (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phospho-Lserine) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The chloroform
from the lipid solution was removed using rotary evaporator at 40oC and the dry lipid films were
hydrated in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The final concentration of the DOPC and DOPS
liposomes were 37.09 mM and 24.69 mM, respectively. The resulting suspension was freezethaw-vortex in liquid nitrogen and water at 60 °C, following which the lipids were extruded 25
times through the mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. USA) through cut off filter of 100nm
polycarbonate membrane to prepare uniform Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV). The size of
LUVs was determined by dynamic light scattering using Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern
Instruments Ltd., UK). The size of DOPS and DOPC was 125 nm and 102 nm, respectively.
2.5 Circular Dichroism spectroscopy
Circular dichroism spectrometer MOS500 (BioLogic) and JASCO machine (Jasco J-1500 CD
spectrometer) was used for CD data recording. 20 μM peptide sample were prepared in 50 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Peptide was kept in organic solvents (TFE) with increasing
concentration from 0 to 90% and far-UV (190–240 nm) spectra were recorded in 1 mm quartz
cuvette. Similarly, the peptide was assessed for structural changes in Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate
(SDS) (below and above critical micellar concentration (CMC)) and in the presence of DOPS
and DOPC LUVs (pH 7.4) All the spectra were recorded at scan speed of 50 nm/min with a
response time of 1s and 1 nm bandwidth. The equivalent spectra of buffers were recorded and

subtracted from the spectra of the test samples. The ellipticity with HT value of less than 600
volt were considered to plot the spectra.
2.6 Phase diagram analysis
Another method called “phase analysis” was utilized to study the intermediates qualitatively
from conformational transitions under different conditions as described earlier (19, 20). This
method involves the analysis of spectral data by building the phase diagram for spectral
intensities I (λ1) versus I (λ2) where I is the spectral intensity measured at wavelengths λ1 and

λ2 under different experimental conditions.
2.7 Fluorescence spectroscopy
We monitored the intrinsic Trp fluorescence intensity in NSP1. A 5μM peptide in 50mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was prepared with increasing concentration of TFE and SDS, and 20

μM peptide (pH 7.4) in DOPS and DOPC. Emission spectra was recorded from 300 to 500 nm at
295nm excitation wavelength in a Horiba Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. The individual
negative blank was subtracted from each test samples (20).
2.8 Fluorescence lifetime measurement
Fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out for the 5μM peptide (pH 7.0) in increasing
concentration of TFE and SDS, and 20 μM peptide (pH 7.4) in DOPC and DOPS by using
Fluorolog TCSPC (Horiba Scientific Inc.) with pulsed LED sources. The excitation wavelength
was set at 284 nm, and the emission wavelength was kept at 345nm. A Ludox solution was used
for correct instrument response factor (IRF). Fluorescence decay data was analyzed through Data
Analysis Software provided by Horiba Scientific. Decay data was fitted tri-exponentially decay
function with a best fit chi-squared value approaching 1.0 in order to calculate the fluorescence
lifetimes.
2.9 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy Decay
Time-Resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy Decay were carried out for the 30 μM peptide (pH 7.4)
in increasing concentration of SDS by using Fluorolog TCSPC (Horiba Scientific Inc.) with
pulsed LED sources. The measurement range of 200 ns, peak preset of 1000 counts was set up to

monitor the decay with emission wavelength of 345 nm. Ludox was used to monitor the prompt
decay (at 284 nm wavelength) to correct the instrument response factor (IRF). Fluorescence
anisotropy measures the depolarization, which happens because the energy transfer to another
molecule of different orientation. Alternatively, molecular rotation is also caused by Brownian
motion and the local environment i.e., viscosity, size of molecule, and molecular confinement
affect the molecular motion (31). Thus, a measurement of fluorescence anisotropy is useful in
obtaining information concerning molecular size and mobility.

2.10 Zeta potential measurement
NSP1 C-terminal interaction with DOPS and DOPC was studied for zeta potential measurements
using Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS device. Briefly, 200 µM of liposomes incubated with different
concentration of NSP1 peptide at 25°C and measured for charge in zeta potential. A total of 3
measurements with 50 runs each were obtained using disposable zeta cells with platinum goldcoated electrodes (Malvern). The electrophoretic mobility obtained was used for the zeta
potential calculation with the help of the Smoluchowski equation.
2.11 Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation of NSP1 C-terminal model

The atomic-level dynamic and energetics could be understood through computer simulation for
appropriate time periods. Long simulation are helpful to explore structural properties and
behavior with respect to time (32). We have utilized Pep-Fold (33, 34) webserver for
constructing a 3D model for C-terminal of NSP1. It applies a coarse-grained (CG) forcefield and
performs up to 200 simulation runs to build an energy minimized structure. The resultant model
was then prepared using Chimera by addition of missing hydrogens and proper parameterization
of asymmetrical residues (35).
We used Gromacs v5, where simulation setup was built by placing the protein structure in a
cubic box along with SPC water model, 0.15M NaCl salt concentration. After solvation, the
system was charge neutralized with counterions. To attain an energy minimized simulation
system, the steepest descent method was used until the system was converged within 1000
kJ/mol. Further, the equilibration of system was done to optimize solvent in the environment.
Using NVT and NPT ensembles within periodic boundary conditions for 100ps each, the system
was equilibrated. The average temperature at 300K and pressure at 1 bar were maintained using
Nose-Hoover and Parrinello-Rahman coupling methods during simulation. All bond-related
constraints were solved using SHAKE algorithm. The final production run was performed for
500ns in our high performing cluster at IIT Mandi. After analyzing the trajectory, the last frame
(we named ‘NSP1-F1’ to avoid confusion) was chosen for further studies in different conditions.
Next, the structural conformations of C-terminal of NSP1 (NSP1-F1) were analyzed in two
different conditions of solvents: TFE (Trifluoroethanol; 8M) and SDS (Sodium dodecyl sulfate)
mixed with water in separate simulation runs. By using above described forcefield parameters
and addition of TFE and SDS molecules into the system, the simulation was performed for 300ns
each. Further to investigate the structural transitions upon lipid-mediated environments, we
performed molecular dynamics simulation of frame NSP1-F1 in presence of DOPS. Using
previously described parameters for simulation in DOPS (36), we used CHARMM-GUI web
interface (37) and inserted 300 molecules of DOPS around protein structure. Following
minimization and equilibration, the final production MD was performed for 200ns. All trajectory
analysis, calculations were performed using Chimera, maestro and Gromacs commands for
calculating root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of
gyration (Rg) for protein structure compactness, and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) for

C-α atoms. The secondary structure component percentage was calculated using 2struc web
server (38).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phylogenetic and Structural analysis of NSP1 C-terminal and insight into intrinsic
disorder properties
Using neighbor-joining method, the phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses was constructed for fulllength amino acid sequences of NSP1 (180 residues) (Figure 1A). It was clear from the multiple
sequence alignment that Bat-SARS-CoV, SARS CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share consensus
sequences. The SARS-CoV-2 C-terminal has few diverse amino acid residues, which indicated
their evolutionary divergence from other coronaviruses (Figure 1B).
The intrinsic disorder predisposition of NSP1 C-terminal was studied using commonly used
VSL2 predictor of intrinsic disorder and found that it is on borderline between ordered and
disordered nature, near the prediction cutoff of 0.5 for disorder prediction (Figure 1C). Further,
sequence-based secondary structure analysis was done by utilizing multiple webservers, which
clearly showed that the part of C-terminal can acquire helical conformation. The PSIPRED has
predicted a potential for helical structure at the 154-160 and 169-178 region (Figure 1D).
Whereas, Jpred4 has indicated the β- strand propensity at 141-144 region and helical propensity
at155-158, and 169-177 regions. While, Pep2d predicted the very high α-helical propensity at
multiple regions, which was 141-142, 145-149, 154-161, and 169-178 regions (Figure 1D).

3.2. NSP1-CTR is intrinsically disordered in isolation and has folding propensity in
presence of organic solvents and lipids
At a concentration of 20 μM in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), the CD spectrum of NSP1-CTR was
as
dominated by a single minimum (199 nm), which indicates that this region in isolation acquire
ire
random coil/disordered conformation (Figure 2A). To investigate the folding propensity of the

disordered proteins organic solvents and lipids are generally used (39). Therefore, in this study,,

we have used SDS, TFE and liposomes for their hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface and charge
mimic properties. CD Spectra at high SDS concentration showed the negative ellipticities at 208
and 222 nm, which is a typical characteristic of alpha-helical conformation. The effect of SDS on
conformation of NSP1-CTR was observed and found that SDS in its monomeric form (0.5 mM)
doesn’t have significant effect on conformation of NSP1. However, SDS above critical micellar
concentration (CMC; 5mM and 50 mM) induce the helicity (Figure 2B). Further, TFE was also
found to induce helicity in NSP1-CTR disorder system (Figure 2D). The secondary structure
analysis was performed using K2D3 indicates the gain in alpha helical structure and loss in
random coil in the presence of SDS and TFE (Figure 2 C, E, F). While, in the presence of
DOPS and DOPC there is partial change in the structural conformation which we can’t say that
its alpha helical and neither disordered (Figure 2 G, H, I). The SDS micelles provide a model
for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interface similar to lipid membranes (40). Studies showed
that the water make hydrogen bond with carbonyl group for a time and then water oxygen start to
pair with N-H, and thus disrupt the intramolecular hydrogen bonding (41). Whereas, TFE has
low dielectric constant and high dipole moment compared to water. The TFE directly interact
with peptide and imparts hydrophobic effect. Irrespective to water, TFE make stable hydrogen
bonding with carbonyl group of peptides and does not disrupt the intramolecular hydrogen
bonding (41). In conclusion, there is change in secondary structure conformation in the presence
of SDS, TFE and DOPC. Our finding is in accordance with the previous disorder system, where
SDS, TFE, and liposomes were used as model system to mimic the biological environment such
as hydrophobic nature, and protein-lipids interaction (19, 20, 36).

2struc, the simulated structure has lost its 10% helicity from 42% to 32%, as shown in Figure 3.
This indicates that the NSP1-C-terminal has less structure and more disorder character in
isolation.

Previously, simulation studies of amyloid beta-peptide showed that the peptide conformation
changes at different solutions of TFE (27%, 40%, 60%, and 70%) (42). Moreover, a model
peptide and an antimicrobial peptide were also demonstrated in co-presence of TFE with water,
where the helical propensity of the structure was observed to be increased (43).
Further, MD simulation of NSP1-F1was performed in presence of SDS and DOPC and DOPS. In
200ns simulation time and in presence of nearly 60 molecules of SDS, the simulated frame or
NSP1-F1 structure gained a slight increment in helical conformation at residues 155-161 and
170-178. Similarly, DOPS has also showed slight change in helical conformation at residues
155-162 and 170-177. In case of DOPC lipid environment, the residues 155-164 and 170-178
have shown helical conformation. As calculated by 2struc server, the simulated structure in
DOPS and DOPC has gained helicity from 32% to 38% and 48%, respectively, as shown in
Figure 3. A similar work by Jalili et al., that has performed all atoms and coarse-grained
simulation of Amyloid-beta (Aβ40) peptide in presence of SDS and have shown the formation of
micelles around the peptide due to self-assembly of molecules of SDS (44).
3.3. Effect of temperature on the conformation of NSP1-CTR
Temperature attribute significant impact on the protein’s backbone. It is stated that the increase
in the temperature leads to the change in secondary structure of intrinsically disordered proteins,
which is associated with the hydrophobic interactions (19, 20). As depicted in Figure 4A,
increase in temperature leads to partial change in structural conformation of NSP1-CTR. Further,
to know the impact of temperature on NSP1-CTR and lipid association, effect of increasing
temperature was studied (Figure 4 B,C). DOPC induced more contraction to this IDP system as
compared to the contraction without the lipids. The secondary structure analysis using K2D3 also
suggested change in conformation in the presence of DOPC (Figure 4D, E, F). The partial
compaction was because of collapse in hydrophobic interaction with respect to secondary
structure formation, however in the presence of DOPC changes in structural conformation was
stable (19, 45). This suggest that NSP1-CTR interact with the neutral charged liposome and
acquire stable conformation, which in isolation was disordered. Previously, non-helical region

temperature (46, 47). DOPS somehow doesn’t enhance the contraction because both the peptide
and lipid are negatively charged and they may not be binding together.

The NSP1-CTR has one Trp161 which showed emission maxima at 346 nm in phosphate buffer.
With a rising concentration of SDS (above CMC), we observed decreased fluorescence intensity

also decreases the

fluorescence intensity with blue shift (emission maxima at 339 nm) that may be due to increased

lifetime measurement of the Trp fluorescence. A fluorophore (Trp161 in our case) in response to
excitation spends time in the excited state, emit a photon and return to the ground state, which is
denoted as its fluorescence lifetime. Any change in the physicochemical conditions leads to the

change in the property of fluorophore and thus the fluorescence lifetime. The average lifetime of
fluorophore Trp in NSP1-CTR was observed to be 1.84 ns in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), while

1.02 ns in the presence of 5 mM SDS, and 1.57 ns in 60 % TFE (Table 1 and Figure 5D, E)..
The average lifetime in the presence of DOPS and DOPC decreased to 0.634 ns and 0.0847 ns,
respectively (Table 1 and Figure 5F). Therefore, it can be seen that the lifetime decreasess

Further, we have analyzed the NSP1-CTR conformational dynamics using Time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements, which have been used previously for other IDPs
(48, 49). The faster rotational correlation times (θ1) suggest a local motion of the fluorophore,
whereas slower correlation times (θ2) is designated with segmental dynamics of peptide
backbone and global tumbling of the entire peptide (31, 49). We measured the conformational
dynamics and steric hindrance around the NSP1-CTD using Trp161 fluorophore in the SDS and
organic solvent environment. Figure 6 shows the fluorescence anisotropy decay for the NSP1CTR in the presence of SDS micelle, organic solvents like TFE and ethanol. The decay curve
was fitted with the bi-exponential decay function that can be correlated with the equation 2 as
described in the method section. The rotational correlation time θ1 (faster rotational correlation

time), was observed to be around 1 ns in all conditions (Table 2). Here the θ1 represents the the
rotational correlation time of Trp161 residue motion. However, rotational correlation time θ2
(slower rotational correlation time) was observed to be beyond 200 ns at higher concentration of
SDS, TFE and ethanol, represents the global conformational dynamics of NSP1-CTR. The
slower rotational correlation times (θ2) for NSP1-CTR only is 16. 94 ns but it reduces to 4.09 ns,
and 7.3 ns in 20% TFE and 20 % ethanol, respectively. Further, in the presence of SDS (5mM
and 50 mM) and TFE (60%) where helical conformation was observed (monitored by CD; see
Figure 2), NSP1-CTR are showing θ2 between 1300-1600 ns. At higher concentration of SDS or
TFE, a very long θ2 (between 1300-1600 ns) beyond 200 ns of measurement range represents
very slow global rotation of NSP1-CTR. At 20 % TFE the lower value of θ2 as compared to
higher concentration of TFE (60 %) and in the absence of TFE may suggest an existance of a
transition phase where partially folded NSP1-CTD dominated. The slow rotation in case of SDS
may be due to the self aggregation nature of SDS forms micellar assemblies that increases the
size (Table 2). A similar type of approach has been employed previously to investigate the
conformational dynamics of α-synuclein in the presence of SDS micelle using NMR that shows
chemical entity of micelle doesn’t perturbed the conformation change but quantitative binding
does (52). Amphiphilic nature of SDS molecules allows them to self-aggregate and form micellar
assemblies (50–52). Overall, we may say that NSP1-CTR can acquire different structural
conformation to perform some functional roles in host cells, which need further experimental
validation. Previously some evidence suggests that the two helical structures, alpha 1 and alpha
2 (Trp161 lies in between these two helical regions) acquired by NSP1-CTR when interacted with
the 40S ribosome subunit (6). Thus, our study corroborates these results and found a change in
structural conformation. Recently, our group has demonstrated that p53 TAD2 was an
intrinsically disordered protein and evidenced a similar finding with an organic solvent, which
relates its diverse conformations with different interacting partners (20).

3.5 Surface charge distribution on LUVs in presence of NSP1-CTR
The zeta potential measurement was done for the estimation of surface charge distribution of
liposomes (DOPS LUV and DOPC LUV) upon addition of the NSP1-CTR peptide. The results
showed that there is minor increase in the zeta potential towards the negative value for DOPS
with NSP1 (-32.8 ±3.15) than DOPS alone (-28.85 ±0.21), while negligible change was found in
the DOPC values (Table 3). The probable reason behind this might be the charge properties of
NSP1 C-terminal. The charge calculated for NSP1-CTR was -6, which thus cause electrostatic
repulsion while interacting with DOPS. Ionic interactions play important role in interaction of
peptide with oppositely charged lipid vesicals as reported previously (36, 53).

3.6 Conformational dynamics of NSP1-CTR through MD simulation
We have corelated the conformational dynamics of peptide with its surrounding environment
using CD spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. To complement our experiments we
further performed the computational simulation. The NSP1-F1 simulation run was evidently
represented the change in conformation of NSP1-CTR in presence of different environment i.e.,
TFE, SDS, and DOPS (Figure 7A,B). These changes may have occurred due to hydrophobic and
electrostatic interactions that are likely to be formed during the simulation period. The gain in
helix in TFE is visible with the residues 145-148 although, in presence of SDS, no such helix has
appeared but there is more percentage of helix can be seen in Figure 3.
To unreveal the role of fluorophore (Trp161) based change in conformation dynamics, we studied
the surface properties and Trp161 orientation in respective environment with computational
simulation (Figure 7A,B). The surface area on NSP1-F1 in water and biological mimic
environment conditions showed changes, which relate to its different conformations. The Trp161
has different orientation in each condition, which again represent different conformation of
NSP1-CTR (Figure 7A,B). The NSP1-F1 structural dynamics corroborates with our experiments
and strengthen the hypothesis of interplay of multiple interactions for conformational dynamics
of NSP1-CTR.

Conclusion
In this study we have found that NSP1-CTR is an IDP in isolation. This is in-line with previous
discovery using Cryo-EM that in full length (NSP1) system the C-terminal is highly flexible.
Further, we investigated the folding propensity in presence of different environments and lipids
and found the conformational heterogenety. The interplay of interaction forces are the driving
forces, which are responsible for the protein-protein interactions and their associated functions.
The binding promiscuity of IDPs provide flexibility to structural domain as well as ability to
function independently with number of partner ligand.

The present study allowed us to

understand the NSP1-CTR, in particular how the conformation dynamics play a central role in
protein interaction. The impact of hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interaction are in
agreement with the previous reports, where NSP1-CTR gain structural helicity after interaction
with 40S and 80S ribosome (6). The conformational dynamics of NSP1-CTR in solution could
pave a path to understand the structural ensemble of this disorder system. Further, some
questions could be answered by the binding kinetics and folding studies of NSP1-CTR with
ligand partner, which eventually helps us to understand the promiscuity of this peptide and
design a small molecular inhibitor.
