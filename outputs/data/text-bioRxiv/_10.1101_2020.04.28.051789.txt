Abstract
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the cellular receptor used by SARS
coronavirus SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. Both coronavirus use the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of their viral spike protein to interact with ACE2. The
structural basis of these interactions are already known, forming a dimer of ACE2
with a trimer of the spike protein, opening the door to target them to prevent the
infection. Here we present PepI-Cov19 database, a repository of peptides designed
to target the interaction between the RDB of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 as well as the
dimerization of ACE2 monomers. The peptides were modelled using our method
PiPreD that uses native elements of the interaction between the targeted protein and
cognate partner that are subsequently included in the designed peptides. These
peptides recapitulate stretches of residues present in the native interface plus novel
and highly diverse conformations that preserve the key interactions on the interface.
PepI-Covid19 database provides an easy and convenient access to this wealth of
information to the scientific community with the view of maximizing its potential
impact in the development of novel therapeutic agents.

Introduction
In December 2019, a disease affecting predominantly the respiratory system
emerged in Wuhan, province Hubei, China, caused by a new coronavirus: SARSCoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to SARS-CoV virus responsible for
an outbreak in 20021. To infect the cells, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a keyhole, binding it via the receptorbinding domain (RDB) of the spike protein (S protein) together serine protease
TMPRSS2-5. This interaction is a key step in viral infection of the cells and thus,
preventing this association the viral charge arises as a valid therapeutic strategy.
The inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using peptides is a valid approach
that have been gaining traction in recent years given the limitation of traditional
small, drug-like, chemicals to target interfaces6. Particularly in the context of viral
infection examples such as the FDA-approved peptide Enfurvirtide7 and further
research (reviewed in 8) justify the use of peptides as potential therapeutic agents to
block PPIs.
The structural details of the interaction between ACE2 and the RBD of the S protein,
both for the SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV-24

9

viruses are known. The structural

information of these protein complexes can be used by programs such the one
developed by us, PiPreD10, to guide the modelling and design orthosteric peptides to
target protein interfaces of interest. We have therefore leveraged on the existing
structural information available on the interaction between RBD and ACE2 to model
and design peptides targeting two relevant interactions for the complex: 1) the
interaction between RBD and ACE2; and 2) the interaction between ACE2
monomers.
We have compiled this information in a public repository: PepI-Covid19 to make it
available to the scientific community, particularly those scientists and groups
searching for novel therapeutic agents. Besides the sequences included in
repository, the modelled structures of the protein-peptides complexes can represent
also the starting point for further refinement and redesign using alternative
approaches that can yields novel peptide sequences. Finally, we aim at keeping

PepI-Cov19 an up-to-date and alive resource, and thus any new structural data on
protein complexes related to covid19 will be duly processed and included in the
repository.
Material and Methods
Surface targeted and design of peptides.
We use the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with
ACE2 (PDB code 6m0j)

9

and SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to

full length ACE2 (PDB code 6m17)4. The two protein complexes, 6m0j and 6m17,
were used in the case of the interface mediating the interaction between the spike
protein (S-prot) and ACE2 while the latter was use to model and design peptides to
target the interface between ACE2 monomers (Figure 1).
Peptides were modelled and designed using PiPreD and Rosetta11 as previously
described10. The modelling step relies on a library of iMotifs that are fitted in the
interface to target using the so called anchor residues. The parameters used in the
modelling stage were: (i) a maximum distance between Cα iMotifs-anchors of 0.5
Ang.,

and (ii) a root mean square deviation value smaller than 1.0 Ang. upon

structural superposition iMotifs-anchors. Once the iMotifs were structurally fitted and
prior to the designing stage, peptides with low interface packing and mimicking less
than 4 anchor residues were discarded.
The design of peptides was done using the backrub application

12

within the Rosetta

suite11. The backrub motions allow the limited movement of the main-chain of the
peptide. It optimizes the interactions with the interface while allowing the design of
any position not structurally aligned with anchor residues, where residue type is
preserved although rotameric changes were allowed. The residues on the interface
belonging to the protein were also allowed to repack. Once the designing stage was
completed, the FlexPepDock application13 in “score mode only” was used to obtain
severals scores (i.e. interface score or peptide score) and other measures such as
buried surface are of the interface between peptide and protein.

Database design, implementation and interfacing
Information about the designed peptides is stored in an SQLite3 database. The web
interface accessible for the user is generated with the Flask Python Microframework.
The structure of the complex protein-peptides is rendered with PV, a WebGL-based
JavaScript API (https://biasmv.github.io/pv/).
Results and Discussion
Interface S1 RDB-ACE2 and ACE2/ACE2
Two different interfaces were considered in this study: the interface between the
RBD of viral S protein, henceforth referred to as interface A, and ACE2 and the
extracellular region of the interface mediating the dimerization of ACE2 protein,
interface D (Figure 1).
For interface A, peptides were designed to target the surface of the viral protein, i.e.
the RBD of the S-prot, hence the anchor residues were derived from the residues of
ACE2 protein. The area of the interface is around 800 Ang2 comprising 26 anchor
residues. The interaction between both proteins is dominated by extensive contacts
between loops of RDB and the a-1 (H1) helix of ACE2 (Figure 1 panel B). The
modelling step prior to designing stage yielded almost 15M peptide, which after
discarding poorly packed peptides and those mimicking less than 3 anchor residues
resulted in a total of number of 450,000 peptides were taken forward to the designing
stage.
For interface D, the number of anchor residues was 37, spanning an interface with a
surface substantially larger than interface A (approximately 2200 Ang2.) The
structural elements mediating the interactions between both monomers are mainly
stacking mirroring helices from both monomers. As discussed in the publication
describing the structure4, ACE2 dimerizes through two different interfaces involving
the peptidase (PD) and Neck domains. In the central region, between both
interfaces, there are not direct interactions between ACE2 monomers; however, it
was also considered for the modelling of peptides. Interestingly, peptides spanning
the two distant interfaces include native elements of the interface (i.e. mimicry of

anchors residues) but also de novo interactions (Figure 1, panel C, surface
representation). The modelling step yielded over 26.5 M peptides. Upon discarding
peptides with a poor interface packing and structurally aligning with less than 3
anchor residues the number dropped to over 1.5M.
Native elements of the interfaces are recapitulated by designed peptides
As discussed, PiPreD relies on native elements of the interface to target in the form
of disembodied interface residues, anchor residues, although without considering the
connectivity between them. Thus, the resulting peptides are not mere regions or
elements of the interface spliced from the native complex. Nonetheless, designed
peptides also recapitulate these native elements of the interface. Examples are
shown in Figure 2 (panels A and B), for each explored interface. In the case of
interface A, different peptides recapitulated the main H1 helix (partial or entire) with
minor conformation adjustments. Likewise, in interface D two peptides show a helical
conformation similar to the helix that mediates the interaction between ACE2
monomers.
Structurally diversity among designed peptides
PiPreD provided peptides with conformations unobserved in the native complex.
These novel conformations incorporated native elements of the interface in the form
of anchor residues, mimicking or surrogating them, but also introducing novel
interactions between the peptides and the targeted surface.
For interface A, the RDB of S-prot binds to ACE2 primarily through a long alpha helix
(H1) and to a lesser extend by a second, shorter, helix. However, over half of the
total number of peptides designed to target the surface of RDB have an extended,
linear, conformation. Three examples are shown Figure 2 (panel C) with peptides
presenting an extended conformation mimicking the interactions of the main H1
helix.
Peptides targeting interface D also present conformations unobserved in the native
interface. Interestingly, the association between ACE2 is mediated by two different

interfaces; one involving the PD domain and the other close to the membrane, the
Neck domain. Peptides bridging between the two surfaces apart were designed both
in helical and extended conformations (Figure 2, panel C), potentially increasing the
affinity of the peptides through a synergistic effect rather than the sum of each single
interface.
PepI-Covid19 database repository: access and functionalities
An online repository to the peptides designed is freely accessible at the PepICovid19 database (http://aleph.upf.edu/pepicovid19/). The repository is web
interfaced allowing user to perform queries based on parameters such as the
conformation of the peptides, size and predicted binding energy as per the Rosetta
energy score11. Users can also query the information based on a number of interface
statistics such the surface area of the interface between protein and peptides (in
Ang2), the number of hydrogen bonds and unsatisfied hydrogen bonds (in case of
buried donor or acceptors groups) at the interface, packing14 or the peptide score.
The query returns a list of the peptides that fulfill the conditions set on the query. The
resulting list can then filter by primary amino acid sequence, and/or sorted by query
parameters (e.g. size). Upon selecting a specific peptide, a page with specific
information on the peptide is shown together with an applet allowing the three
dimensional visualization of the protein-peptide structural complex (Figure 3.)

Conclusion
Here we present a repository of designed peptides to interfere in the early stages of
invasion process by SARS-CoV-2. These peptides present a large structural
sampling, targeting both the RBD/ACE2 as well as the extracellular ACE2/ACE2
interface. The repository allows for tailored queries and searches and a convenient
retrieval of information.

Users can visualize the structural model of the protein-

peptide interactively. We believe the information included in PepI-Cov19 database is
a significant and worth asset to current efforts devoted to find novel therapeutic
agents and strategies to fight SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the information of protein
sequences of potential peptide inhibitors for experimental guidance or structural data
of peptides as basis for further computational work represent two of the elements
where PepI-Cov19 database can contribute to such efforts. Moreover, the repository
will be updated as structural information becomes available on protein complexes
related to SARS-CoV-2 cell infection.
