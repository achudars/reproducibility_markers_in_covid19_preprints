Abstract

22

Background In the early stages of the coronavirus disease pandemic, the anti-malarial drug
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the antibiotic drug azithromycin (AZM) were widely used as
emerging treatments. However, controversial cardiac toxicity results obtained from clinical trials and
epidemic studies suggest that the cardiotoxicity of these two drugs should be re-evaluated. In the
present study, we aimed to assess the impact of a short course of AZM or HCQ + AZM combination
treatment on ECG and cardiac function in healthy guinea pigs.

Methods Thirty-two male guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups: control; AZM; HCQ;
and HCQ + AZM groups. At 3, 6, and 9 days after treatment, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and
echocardiographic techniques were used to determine important ECG parameters and cardiac
functional parameters of the left ventricle (including posterior wall thickness, end systolic/end
diastolic volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening).
Results Although AZM decreased the heart rates of guinea pigs on day 9 (under anesthetized
conditions), HCQ + AZM decreased heart rates on days 3, 6, and 9. The corrected QT intervals of
guinea pigs after AZM and HCQ + AZM treatments were significantly increased, compared with
CON and HCQ treatment respectively, on days 3, 6, and 9. However, QRS complex durations were
not significantly different between the groups. AZM significantly decreased left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) on days 3, 6, and 9, whereas HCQ +
AZM only decreased LVEF and LVFS on day 9. Posterior wall thickness and of the left ventricle in
the diastolic and systolic states were not significantly different between these groups. In addition,
compared with CON, AZM and HCQ decreased the EDV. And, in comparison with HCQ treatment,
HCQ + AZM treatment increased ESV on day 9.

45

Conclusions According to our study, AZM significantly prolongs the QT interval and damages
cardiac function. Moreover, HCQ + AZM treatment increased the risk of cardiac dysfunction
compared with HCQ treatment.

Introduction

47

Since the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, confirmed cases of COVID-19
have reached more than 44.5 million, and ~2.64% of these cases have proved fatal (WHO
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard, accessed Oct 30, 2020)(26). Hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ), azithromycin (AZM), or a combination of these two drugs has been widely used for the
treatment of COVID-19, despite that some countries have declined treatment with these drugs. HCQ
is a quinoline medicine that was first approved by the FDA in 1955 and has since been widely used
for the treatment of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupous erythematosus(3, 12). AZM is
a macrolide antibiotic that was discovered by the Croatia-based Pliva Pharmaceutical Co. in 1988.
AZM is used to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, urogenital system, connective tissues,
and other systemic infections. Although the early data suggested that treatment with HCQ or AZM
reduced the viral load and/ or improved clinical conditions(24), several cohort studies and clinical
trials concluded that HCQ monotherapy or HCQ + AZM combination therapy did not improve

clinical status (4, 16). Besides of this argument regarding the treatment clinical outcomes, these
controversial data concern the safety profiles of these drugs.
According to statistics provided by @CovidAnalysis(1), patients in many countries still use HCQ to
treat COVID-19 in the early stages of treatment. HCQ and AZM are currently in the World Health
Organization’s list of essential medicines and, even before the pandemic, were among the most
commonly prescribed drugs worldwide(6, 7, 27). So far, clinicians and researchers globally have
been desperately sharing their findings and experiences regarding the prevention and treatment of
COVID-19. However, rapid publication of these findings has also exposed the public to incompletely
analyzed, un-verified data. In the assessment of drug-induced cardiotoxicity risk for novel
pharmaceuticals, since 2005 most countries have adopted the standard preclinical evaluation protocol
of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH S7B) (13). However, the drugs including HCQ and AZM on
market earlier than that timepoint might not be assessed adequately for their hidden cardiotoxicity.
To further understand the adverse effects of HCQ, AZM, and HCQ + AZM on cardiac conduction
and function and to validate safe use of these drugs in non-COVID-19 patients, a re-evaluation of
cardiac safety using a preclinical animal model is necessary.

77

Here, we firstly tested delayed ventricular repolarization in guinea pigs after the drug treatment
following the guideline of ICH S7B. Next, we also employed echocardiography technology for small
animals to evaluate cardiac morphology and function that were potentially affected by drugs.

Animals

80

87

Healthy Hartley guinea pigs (~300 g) were purchased from a licensed laboratory animal supplier
(Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center, China). The animals were housed in a specific
pathogen-free, AAALAC-accredited facility of Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute
(Guangzhou, China). The facility employed a 12-h light/dark cycle and a temperature and humidity
of 24 ± 2°C and 40-60%, respectively. Animals were fed ad libitum on a standard guinea pig diet. All
animal experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute, Guangzhou, China (No.
IACUC2020125).

88

Treatment protocol

89

Thirty-two guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8 in each group): control (CON);
azithromycin (AZM); hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ); and HCQ plus AZM (HCQ + AZM)
groups. The dosage of drugs was adjusted with reference to the clinical dosage in humans(8), and all
drugs were suspended in normal saline before administration. HCQ was purchased from Shanghai
Pharmaceuticals (Shanghai, China) and AZM from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals (New York, USA). The
experimental design is shown in Figure 1. Specifically, the drugs, dosage, and duration of
administration of each group were as follows: (1) CON group, normal saline; (2) HCQ group, 30.84

mg/kg of HCQ on the first day and 15.42 mg/kg of HCQ on subsequent 8 days; (3) AZM group,
38.54 mg/kg of AZM on the first day and 19.27 mg/kg from day 2-5; (4) HCQ + AZM group, 30.84
mg/kg of HCQ on day 1 followed by 15.42 mg/kg per day for the next 8 days and 38.54 mg/kg of
AZM on the first day and 19.27 mg/kg from days 2-5. All drugs or normal saline were administered
once a day by gavage. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiograph recordings of guinea pigs were
performed before initiation of the administration protocol and on days 3, 6, and 9 after the
administration of drugs.

103

In vivo electrophysiological parameters

104

114

Delayed ventricular repolarization is reflected in QT interval prolongation, which can cause a
potentially lethal arrhythmia called Torsade de pointes(14). Longitudinal studies have shown that QT
prolongation can help predict cardiovascular event-related mortality(22, 23). To determine the QT
interval and other in vivo electrophysiological parameters, the guinea pigs were anesthetized with 2%
isoflurane and pure oxygen mix through a respiratory system (Matrx, USA). After induction of
anesthesia, the animals were placed in dorsal recumbency on an operating table with a heating pad.
Sterilized electrodes were inserted subcutaneously into the right forelimb and the left hind limb of the
anesthetized animal. The electrodes were then connected to the ECG module of the PowerLab 4/35
system (ADInstruments Inc., USA), and the lead II method was selected from the program for ECG
recording. Electrophysiological parameters, including RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and
QT interval, were analyzed using the LabChart Pro Software (ADInstruments Inc., USA).

115

QT interval correction

116

Several formulas have been developed for QT interval correction to facilitate a precise interpretation
of this interval. In our current experiments, two steps were performed to determine the correction
formula most appropriate for calculating the QT interval for the anesthetized guinea pigs. First, the
QT and RR intervals from the ECGs were inputted into five correction equations (Bazett’s(2),
Fridericia’s(11), Van de Water’s (25), Kawataki’s(15), Matsunaga’s(17) to obtain the corrected QT
(QTc) interval. Next, the calculated QTc and RR data were subjected to linear regression analysis,
and the correction formula with the smallest slope of the regression line was used to evaluate the QTc
interval in this study.

Transthoracic echocardiography

130

The effects of drugs on the cardiac function of guinea pigs were evaluated using a high-frequency
ultrasound system Vevo2100 (VisualSonics, Canada) equipped with a linear array transducer
(MS250, 13-24 MHz). This transducer is specifically designed for rats, guinea pigs or other similar
sizes of small animals. During image acquisition, guinea pigs were anesthetized continuously with

2% isoflurane. All animals were placed in the dorsal recumbent position for ultrasound imaging. The
probe was first placed on the right shoulder approximately 30° from the center line to obtain the
parasternal left ventricle long axis B-mode image, and the probe was then rotated 90° clockwise to
obtain the parasternal short-axis B-mode image of the left ventricle on the papillary muscle plane.
The M-mode ultrasound cursor was used to acquire images.

139

Cardiac function parameters

140

A VisualSonics workstation was used to analyze the echocardiographic images. Using the short-axis
M-mode images, the left ventricular dimensions (LVIDd and LVIDs), and posterior wall thickness
(LVPWd and LVPWs) were all measured at the end of both systole and diastole. The end diastolic
volume (EDV), end systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (LVEF), and fractional shortening
(LVFS) of the LV were then calculated. The calculation equations for EF and FS were:

All ultrasound data were averaged over three consecutive cardiac cycles.

147

Statistical Analysis

148
150

All experimental data are presented as means ± standard error of means (SEM). Statistical differences
between the groups were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparisons
test (GraphPad Prism 8, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistical significance.

Evaluation of QT correction methods for estimating QT interval prolongation

153

159

The correlation (R2) values obtained using the QT interval correction formulas reported by Bazett,
Van de Water, Kawataki, Matsunaga, and Fridericia were 0.3446, 0.6661, 0.5871, 0.6360, and
0.5179, respectively (Figure 2). Thus, the Van de Water, Kawataki, and Matsunaga methods yielded
the highest correlations. In a comparison of the slopes obtained from data fitted to these three linear
regression equations, the smallest value (0.4947) was returned using the Van de Water equation
(Figure 2, Table 1). Thus, the Van de Water correction method was used to evaluate the QT interval
in this study.

160

QTc intervals of Guinea pigs significantly increased with AZM or HCQ + AZM treatment

161

Sample ECGs on Day 0 and Day 9 from the CON, AZM, HCQ, and HCQ + AZM groups are shown
in Figure 3. Basic electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters of guinea pigs before drug administration
were shown in Table 2. Although guinea pig heart rates in the HCQ group were unchanged
(compared with those in the CON group) on days 3, 6, and 9. Compared with HCQ treatment alone,
HCQ + AZM treatment significantly reduced the heart rate on days 3, 6, and 9 (Figure 4A and 4B).
Thus, guinea pig heart rate slowed following the addition of AZM to HCQ treatment. And,
bradycardia was still observed in guinea pigs after the discontinuation of AZM treatment for 4 days.

Correspondingly, the RR interval was significantly increased only on day 9 in the AZM group
compared with that in the CON group. The HCQ + AZM treatment significantly increased the RR
interval on days 3, 6, and 9 compared with HCQ treatment, while in comparison with CON, HCQ +
AZM treatment was significantly increased RR interval on day 9 only (Figure 4C and 4D-i; Table 3).
The PR interval was significantly increased following a 9-day course of AZM, compared with CON.
The PR interval was prolonged on day 6 but not on day 9 following AZM + HCQ treatment,
compared with HCQ. These results suggest that conduction of the sinoatrial nodal impulse to the
ventricles is affected by AZM and that subsequent withdrawal of AZM halts the observed conduction
dysfunction induced by HCQ + AZM treatment on day 6 (Figure 4C and 4D-ii; Table 3). The QRS
complex durations were not different among the four treatment groups (Figure 4D-iii; Table 3),
indicating that short-course HCQ, AZM, and HCQ + AZM treatments did not significantly affect
right or left ventricle depolarization.
Following AZM treatment, the QTc interval was significantly increased on days 3, 6, and 9 compared
with that following CON treatment. In contrast, HCQ treatment did not affect the QTc interval on
days 3, 6, or 9. However, the QTc interval was significantly increased following HCQ + AZM
treatment on days 3, 6, and 9 compared with that following HCQ treatment (Figure 4C and 4D-iv;
Table 3). These results suggest that AZM prolongs the QT interval and that after 4 days of AZM
withdrawal, QT interval prolongation did not disappear.
AZM significant decreased LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV fractional shortening (LVFS),
while HCQ + AZM only decreased LVEF and LVFS on day 9
First, we examined the cardiac morphology of guinea pigs in the CON, AZM, HCQ, and HCQ +
AZM groups. From examinations of wall thicknesses and internal dimensions in the diastolic and
systolic states, no differences in the LVPWd and LVPWs were observed among the groups on days 3,
6, and 9. However, on day 9, AZM significantly reduced LVIDd compared with CON. Compared
with HCQ, HCQ + AZM significantly increased the LVIDs on day 9. And, compared with AZM,
HCQ + AZM significantly decreased LVIDs and LVIDd on day 6 but not day 9. These results
indicate that short-course treatments of AZM or HCQ + AZM altered the morphology of the LVs.
Simultaneously, on day 9, in comparison with CON, the AZM or HCQ treatment alone decreased the
EDV, while in comparison with HCQ treatment, HCQ + AZM treatment increased ESV.

204

Next, we compared cardiac function among the groups (Figure 5; Table 4). In the AZM group,
LVEFs were significantly decreased on days 3, 6, and 9 compared with those in the Con group.
Furthermore, compared with HCQ treatment, HCQ + AZM treatment for 5 days significantly reduced
the LVEF on day 9. At all three time points, the LVFSs after treatment with AZM (both AZM and
HCQ + AZM) showed similar changes with LVEFs. Compared with CON, HCQ treatment did not
change the LVEF and LVFS on days 3, 6, and 9. These results demonstrate that AZM and HCQ +
AZM can severely alter cardiac function, which are consistent with our ECG findings showing that
AZM and HCQ + AZM prolong the QTc interval.

In this study, we have demonstrated that the combination of HCQ and AZM treatment increase the
risk of cardiac dysfunction compared with HCQ treatment. These findings in the healthy animal
model is similar with that in the COVID-19 patients treated with this combination. It has been
reported that the COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ + AZM treatment for 15 days are associated
with higher frequencies of QT interval prolongation(4, 5). Moreover, our results showed that HCQ
did not alter the QT interval after short-course treatment in the healthy animals, which is consistent
with previous finding indicating that the risk of cardiomyopathy following short-term use of HCQ
was low(19). However, some of the COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ have showed prolonged
QT interval(4, 5). This might indicate that the cardiovascular risk of HCQ is increased in the
COVID-19 patients suffering cardiac injury. Autopsies(10) and experiments(20) have shown that
viruses can enter cardiomyocytes, causing myofibril damage. Heart inflammation or myocarditis
were also seen in the COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms(20). Thus, we suggest that disease
models resembling SARS-CoV-2 induced cardiac damage are needed when assessing the cardiotoxic
effects of HCQ.

236

Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a major adverse event associated with numerous clinically important
drugs. Cardiotoxicity has previously led to the post-marketing withdrawal of numerous
pharmacologically active drugs. As a consequence, the assessment of cardiotoxicity potential is a
crucial parameter in drug development. Here, in addition to ECG, we used echocardiography to
evaluate cardiac function following AZM, HCQ, and HCQ + AZM administration. Currently,
echocardiography clinically is an essential tool for testing drug-induced left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with a fall in left ventricular ejection fraction(18), but this technology has not been
widely used to assess potential drug cardiotoxicities preclinically. On the other hand, it has been
reported that patients with long QT syndrome are associated with delayed systolic contraction
velocity and prolonged systolic duration(21), and in the patients with LVFS less than 35%, the QT
interval is correlated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction(9). Here, we have demonstrated that
cardiac dysfunction is consistent with the prolongation of QT intervals in the guinea pigs following
either AZM or the combination of AZM and HCQ treatment. Thus, our and others’ results suggest
that echocardiography technology are useful for assessing the cardiotoxicity of AZM and HCQ.
Another advantage of echocardiography is that it provides morphological measurements of the heart.
Thus, without sacrificing the animals, we can detect any potential structural changes induced by
newly developed drugs.

237

Limitations

238

242

This study has just explored the effects of AZM and the combination of HCQ + AZM on cardiac
conduction and function at a single dose. In the coming study, a higher and a lower dose have been
selected to unveil the other potential hidden cardiotoxicity. The protein expression alterations of
cellular membrane receptors and their downstream signals are to be investigated to explain
underlying molecular mechanisms.
