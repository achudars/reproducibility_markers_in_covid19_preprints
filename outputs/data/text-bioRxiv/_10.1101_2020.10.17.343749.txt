Abstract: Coronaviruses are highly pathogenic and therefore important human and veterinary
pathogens viruses worldwide (1). Members of family Coronaviridae have previously been
analysed phylogenetically, resulting in proposals of virus interrelationships (2-5). However,
available Coronavirus phylogenies remain unrooted, based on limited sampling, and normally
depend on a single method (2-11). The main subjects of this study are the taxonomy and
systematics of coronaviruses and our goal is to build the first natural classification of
Coronaviridae using several methods of cladistic analyses (12), Maximum Likelihood method, as
well as rigorous taxonomic sampling, making the most accurate representation of Coronaviridae’s
relationships to date. Nomenclature recommendations to help effectively incorporate principles of
binary nomenclature into Coronaviridae taxonomy are provided. We have stressed that no
member of Sarbecovirus clade is an ancestor of SARS-Cov-2, and humans are the only known
host.

Keywords: Coronaviridae, cladistics, rooted phylogenetic trees, taxonomy, binary nomenclature,
generic circumscription, SARS-Cov-2.

One Sentence Summary: Multiple comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of all coronavirus
species enabled testing of critical proposals on virus interrelationships.

Introduction

Coronaviridae is a family of the order Nidovirales (realm Riboviria) (13, 14). Accordingto
the current summaries of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (13-16) this
family is divided into two subfamilies - Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae. These two
subfamilies circumscribe five genera: monotypic genus Alphaletovirus of the subfamily
Letovirinae (with single species Microhyla letovirus 1), and four non-monotypic genera of
subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, namely:

1. genus Alphacoronavirus with 12 subgenera: Colacovirus (monotypic), Decacovirus
(two species), Duvinacovirus (monotypic), Luchacovirus (monotypic), Minacovirus
(two species), Minunacovirus (two species), Myotacovirus (monotypic), Nyctacovirus
(monotypic), Pedacovirus (two species), Rhinacovirus (monotypic), Setracovirus (two
species) and Tegacovirus (monotypic) (Table S1);
2. genus Betacoronavirus with five subgenera: Embecovirus (four species), Hibecovirus
(monotypic), Merbecovirus (four species), Nobecovirus (two species) and
Sarbecovirus (the number of species is under review) (Table S1);
3. genus Gammacoronavirus with two monotypic subgenera: Cegacovirus and
Igacovirus (Table S1);
4. genus Deltacoronavirus with three monotypic subgenera Andecovirus, Herdecovirus
and Moordecovirus and one non-monotypic subgenus Buldecovirus (four species)
(Table S1).

The viruses of Coronaviridae, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
related Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), are highly pathogenic (1). The recently

discovered virus SARS-Cov-2, which is also a member of this family, causes the Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) that was declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. Eight months
later the total cases of COVID-19 are approaching 40,100,000 and cumulative deaths have
exceeded 1 127 000 (www.who.int, October 2020). Thus, Coronaviridae is of high medical
importance worldwide. Such importance has resulted in an urgency to further understand the
relationships within the coronavirus family, and the viruses most closely related to SARS-Cov-2.
However, phylogenetic analyses of Coronaviridae to date have remained in question due to the
use of limited or arbitrary taxonomic sampling, and/or the use of unrooted trees (for example (2,
3, 6, 8-11), among others). These issues can result in bias and lack vital hierarchical information
needed to understand the critical relationships between the viruses within this family. To address
this urgent need, this study has undertaken a comprehensive taxonomic analysis of the family
Coronaviridae, using the best taxonomic sampling that is based on all ICTV-approved genomes of
all known coronaviruses. Additional viruses were also included to enable testing of the veracity of
recently published proposals, included recently identified viruses such as SARS-Cov-2.
Almost all available phylogenetic studies of coronaviruses have been based on the
parametric Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. Thus, in order to increase the accuracy of our
current analyses and resolve the relationships within Coronaviridae, we have used ML method as
well as non-parametric cladistic approaches:
1. standard maximum parsimony (MP),
2. three-taxon statement analysis (3TA), and the
3. Average Consensus (AC) analysis as applied to the array of the maximal relationships.
The last two methods have not previously been used to resolve relationships within the
Coronaviridae.
The produced trees (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5) enabled testing for monophyly of all
available non-monotypic genera and infrageneric taxa of Coronaviridae to determine whether they

are representative of a natural hierarchy. If so, this validates the estimation of the relationships
between all of the available genera/infrageneric taxa or particular virus species of Coronaviridae
(incl. SARS-Cov-2).
The first important proposal assessed herein is that the newly described monotypic genus
Alphaletovirus (Table S1), a member of subfamily Letovirinae, is a sister group of family
Coronaviridae (2).
The second proposal assessed was by Tokarz et al. (4) who suggested that the general
relationship within Coronaviridae subfamily Orthocoronavirinae is a simple hierarchy:
((({Alphacoronavirus},{Betacoronavirus}){Gammacoronavirus}){Deltacoronavirus}).
Unfortunately Tokarz et al. (4) based their suggestion on limited taxonomic sampling. We would
name this proposition the (((, ) ) ) hypothesis of the general relationship within the subfamily.
Thirdly, the subgenus Hibecovirus has been placed as sister taxon of the presumably
monotypic subgenus Sarbecovirus (for instance (3, 5)). This proposal is again based on unrooted
phylogenies, so it has been tested herein with special attention to the placement of SARS-Cov-2.
In the fourth proposal, the close relationship of SARS-Cov-2 with bat coronaviruses
RaTG13 (21, 25) and RmYN02 (24, 25) as well as with pangolin coronavirus (reviewed in (17))
is also tested.
In addition, within the context of our findings, some critical comments are made to the
nomenclature of the family as well as to the general patterns of hosting within Coronaviridae,
including newly discovered coronavirus SARS-Cov-2.

Results

All four trees have several major consistencies, as shown in the Strict Consensus (Figure 1
and Figure S5, see also Figures S1 – S4).

a. General pattern of the relationships within Coronaviridae and the placement of
Microhyla letovirus 1 (Figure 1, Figure S1 – S5, Table S1).

The results of all analyzes have demonstrated that the hierarchy ((({Alphacoronavirus},
{Betacoronavirus}){Gammacoronavirus}){Deltacoronavirus}), with Microhyla letovirus 1
(subgenus Milecovirus, genus Alphaletovirus, subfamily Letovirinae) which has been defined as
its sister taxon, form a general pattern of the relationship within Coronaviridae.

b. {Alphacoronavirus} clade (Figure 1, Figure S1 – S5, Table S1).

{Alphacoronavirus} clade includes all known species of the subgenus Alphacoronavirus.
Within this clade, all four trees showed that the following taxa are sisters:
a. Minacovirus 1 and 2 (Ferret coronavirus and Mink coronavirus 1);
b. Pedacovirus 1 and 2 (Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Scotophilus bat coronavirus
512 );
c. Setracovirus 1 and 2 (Human coronavirus NL63 and NL63-related bat coronavirus
BtKYNL63-9b);
d. Decacovirus 1 and 2 (Bat coronavirus HKU10 and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum
alphacoronavirus HuB-2013);
e. Minunacovirus 1 and 2 (Miniopterus bat coronavirus 1 and Miniopterus bat coronavirus
HKU8 ).
Thus, within {Alphacoronavirus} clade, we were able to find five smaller clades
(subclades): {Decacovirus}, {Minacovirus}, {Minunacovirus}, {Pedacovirus} and

{Setracovirus}with the exact correspondence of each of these clades to the previously established
subgenera of the genus Alphacoronavirus.
From our results (Figure 1, Figure S1 – S5, Table S1) it is also clear, that
a. monotypic subgenus Colacovirus (Bat coronavirus CDPHE15) is a sister of
Pedacovirus clade in all of the trees;
b. monotypic subgenus Duvinacovirus (Human coronavirus 229E) is a sister of the
Setracovirus clade in all of the trees, and
c. monotypic subgenus Tegacovirus (Alphacoronavirus 1) is a sister of the Minacovirus
clade in all of the trees.
The phylogenetic placement of monotypic subgenera Luchacovirus (Lucheng Rn rat
coronavirus), Myotacovirus (Myotis ricketti alphacoronavirus Sax-2011) and Rhinacovirus
(Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2) depends on the method of the analyses (Figure 1, Figure S1
– S5, Table S1). It is worth stressing, however, that all of the cladistic methods (Figure S1 – S3),
but not the ML method (Figure S4) have placed Luchacovirus as a sister of the
{Alphacoronavirus}.

c. {Betacoronavirus} clade (Figure 1, Figure S1 – S5, Table S1).

{Betacoronavirus} clade includes all known species of the subgenus Betacoronavirus.
All of the analyses argue in favor of the general simple hierarchical relationship
({Embecovirus} ({Merbecovirus} ({Nobecovirus} (Hibecovirus, {Sarbecovirus})))) within
Betacoronavirus clade (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5).
The relationships of four species of the subgenus Embecovirus (1-4) (Betacoronavirus 1,
China Rattus coronavirus HKU24, Human coronavirus HKU1 and Murine coronavirus), that

formed a clade with the same name {Embecovirus}, the sister of {Betacoronavirus} clade,
depend on the method of the analysis (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5; Table 1).
All four species of subgenus Merbecovirus form a clade {Merbecovirus}. In all trees, the
Merbecovirus 1 (Hedgehog coronavirus 1) is a sister to the clade that contains three other
members of the subgenus Merbecovirus: namely, Merbecovirus 2 (Middle East respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS)), Merbecovirus 3 (Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5),
and the constant sister of the later Merbecovirus 4 (Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4) (Figure
1, Figures S1 - S5; Table S1).
The {Sarbecovirus} clade that corresponds to the subgenus Sarbecovirus includes the
viruses of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS), the newly discovered
monophyletic SARS-Cov-2 (two accessions have been included to the analyses, SARS-Cov-2a
and SARS-Cov-2b), as well as CoV-ZC45 and SARS Cov ZS B.
Clade {Sarbecovirus-SARS plus SARS Cov ZS B} (SARS-Clade of the Figure 1) is a
sister of the remaining species of {Sarbecovirus}.
Depending on the analysis, either bat coronaviruses RmYN02 or RaTG13 have been
placed as a sister of SARS-Cov-2. The pangolin coronavirus (isolate MP789) has been defined as
a sister of the clade {RmYN02 plus RaTG13 plus SARS-Cov-2} in all of the analyses.
All trees define the monotypic subgenus Hibecovirus (Bat Hp-betacoronavirus) as a sister
of {Sarbecovirus} clade.
Two members of subgenus Nobecovirus, namely Nobecovirus 1 (Rousettus bat
coronavirus GCCDC1) and Nobecovirus 1 (Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9) are sister taxa
(Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5; Table S1).

d. {Gammacoronavirus} clade (Figure 1, Figure S1 – S5, Table S1).

Two subgenera of the genus Gammacoronavirus, namely subgenus Cegacovirus (with the
single species Beluga whale coronavirus SW1) and subgenus Igacovirus (with a single species
Avian coronavirus) formed a clade {Gammacoronavirus} in all of the analyses (Figure 1, Figures
S1 - S5).

e. {Deltacoronavis} clade (Figure 1, Figure S1 – S5, Table S1).

Five subgenera of genus Deltacoronavis, namely subgenus Andecovirus (with single
species Wigeon coronavirus HKU20), subgenus Buldecovirus (1-4) (with four species: Bulbul
coronavirus HKU11, Coronavirus HKU15, Munia coronavirus HKU13 and White-eye
coronavirus HKU16), subgenus Herdecovirus (with one species Night heron coronavirus HKU19)
and subgenus Moordecovirus (with single species Common moorhen coronavirus HKU21), have
formed the {Deltacoronavis} clade in all of the analyzes. Also, all of the analyses argue in favor
of the simplest hierarchy of the relationships within this clade: (Andecovirus (Herdecovirus
(Moordecovirus ({Buldecovirus})))). Within {Buldecovirus} clade Buldecovirus 2 (Coronavirus
HKU15) and Buldecovirus 3 (Munia coronavirus HKU13) appeared to be sisters in all of the
analyses, the relationships between the other members of the {Buldecovirus} clade depends on
the method of the analysis. Monotypic subgenus Andecovirus is a sister of {Deltacoronavis}
clade.

Table S1).

As is perhaps clear from above, all four trees show that all four genera of subfamily
Orthocoronavirinae (family Coronaviridae), namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,
Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, are monophyletic (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5).
All non-monotypic subgenera of all four genera of subfamily Orthocoronavirinae (family
Coronaviridae), namely subgenus Decacovirus (genus Alphacoronavirus), subgenus Minacovirus
(genus Alphacoronavirus), subgenus Minunacovirus (genus Alphacoronavirus), subgenus
Pedacovirus (genus Alphacoronavirus), subgenus Setracovirus (genus Alphacoronavirus),
subgenus Embecovirus (genus Betacoronavirus), subgenus Merbecovirus (genus
Betacoronavirus), subgenus Nobecovirus (genus Betacoronavirus), and subgenus Buldecovirus
(genus Deltacoronavirus) are monophyletic in all of the analyses (Figure 1, Figures S1 – S5).

Discussion

Several phylogenies of Coronaviridae (or parts thereof) have been published; however
almost all of these remain unrooted (for example (2, 3, 6, 8-11) among others), or if the
phylogenetic tree occasionally appears as rooted (for instance (4, 7)) the taxonomic sampling of
such studies remain incomplete or even arbitrary. We would like to stress that this study seeks to
produce comprehensive rooted phylogenetic Coronaviridae trees and that the analyses herein have
used the best taxonomic summaries of family Coronaviridae currently established by ICTV
(2019) (1-4).

a. Rigorous rooted trees validate tested proposals of the relationships within
Coronaviridae

10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343749; this version posted October 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

Rooted trees produced by the four methods herein allow for the effective testing of various
proposals regarding the relationships of viruses within the Coronaviridae family.
1. Our results argue in favor of Bukhari et al. (2) proposal regarding the new family
Abyssoviridae of the order Nidovirales (current monotypic subfamily Letovirinae with
subgenus Milecovirus) (Table S1), which was unfortunately based on an unrooted
phylogenetic tree and limited taxonomic sampling. After Bukhari et al. (2) we also found
that two subfamilies of Coronaviridae, namely Letovirinae (family Abyssoviridae in
Bukhari et al. (2)) and Orthocoronavirinae are sisters (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5). This
solution is consistent with the familial rank of both taxa (2). We would recommend to
accept the monotypic subfamily Letovirinae at the familiar rank (2).
2. Tokarz et al. (4) proposed the (((, ) ) ) hypothesis of the general pattern of
relationship within subfamily Orthocoronavirinae; however this was again based on
limited taxonomic sampling and an unrooted network. Our results clearly argue in favor of
this hypothesis. Keeping in mind the constant placement of subgenus Milecovirus
(MLeV), we can extend this pattern to the relationship ((((, ) ) ) MLeV). This
natural hierarchy within Coronaviridae is in principle congruent to the general pattern of
their hosts: (((Mammals) Birds plus Mammals) Amphibia) (Table S1).
3.

Subgenus Hibecovirus has been proposed as a sister taxon of the subgenus Sarbecovirus
(reviewed in (5)). This proposal, which again was made on the basis of unrooted trees,
also benefited from reexamination using the comprehensive rooted trees produced in this
study. All four methods validate the sister relationship of the subgenera Hibecovirus and
Sarbecovirus clade (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5).

4. Because of our particular interest in regards to SARS-Cov-2, we would like to stress that
all four methods have placed pangolin coronavirus as a sister of the clade {RaTG13 plus
RmYN02 plus SARS-Cov-2} (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5), confirming that bat

11

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343749; this version posted October 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

coronaviruses RaTG13 or RmYN02, but not the pangolin coronavirus, are indeed the
closest relatives of SARS-Cov-2 (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5). In other words, contrary to
some recent suggestions (reviewed in 17, 18) the rooted trees produced herein confirm
that either bat coronavirus RaTG13 (21) or RmYN02 (24), but not the pangolin
coronavirus, is an immediate sister of SARS-Cov-2 (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5).

Differences in details within clade relationships do exist between the ML method and each
of the additional cladistic methods newly applied to molecular sequence data of Coronaviridae.
For example the MP, AC and 3TA trees (Figures S1-S3), but not ML trees (Figure S4), have
placed Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (genus Alphacoronavirus, subgenus Luchacovirus) as a sister
taxon to the clade that contains all of the remaining members of genus Alphacoronavirus.
Similarly, both conventional phylogenetic methods (MP and ML) have defined bat
coronavirus RmYN02 as a weakly supported sister of the SARS-Cov-2 (Figures S1, S4).
However both Hennigian methods (3TA and AC) are, in contrast, placed bat coronavirus RaTG13,
but not RmYN02, as a sister of this newly discovered coronavirus (Figures S2, S3).
All four analyses are initially based on a common molecular matrix (22,489 bp G-Block
version of the 47-genomes alignment) (Supplementary Materials). Differences between analyses
are likely a result of how each method deals with conflict to form the optimal trees. Nevertheless,
the similarity between the tree topologies suggests that, regardless of method, many of the nodes
are ‘true’ summaries of the data and that the data themselves are relatively noise-free (Figure 1,
Figures S1 - S5).

b. On relationships and hosting of newly discovered Sarbecovirus SARS-Cov-2

12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343749; this version posted October 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

Even from the elementary comparative point of view, it is clear that every Coronaviridae
virus seems to be well defined and well separated from the others sometimes by hundreds or
(more commonly) thousands of single nucleotide positions (SNPs) (Table S2, S3). For example,
the minimal relationship {RmYN02 {RaTG13 plus SARS-Cov-2}} (Figures S2, S3), based on the
29,907 bp complete genomic alignment of three taxa (RmYN02, RaTG13 and SARS-Cov-2
(MN908947)), implies 1,329 informative SNPs (or, respectively, 1,329 3TSs) from the total 2,467
variable characters.
Thus, even closely related viruses from the Sarbecovirus clade (including the newly
discovered SARS-Cov-2 and bat coronaviruses RaTG13 and RmYN02), are all remarkably
different from one another from a comparative standpoint. The same is true for every relationship
within Coronaviridae we have recovered in our analyses.
Such simple observations automatically exclude the possibility of the recombination
origins of SARS-Cov-2 (reviewed in (19), see also (8, 20)) as well as other similar propositions.
Based on the data available to date, including the comprehensive trees produced herein (Figure 1,
Figures S1 - S5), the focus should shift to the static aspect of the problem.
The monophyly of all the genera of Coronaviridae, as well as all of its non-monotypic
subgenera, and also the general relationship ((((, ) ) ) within the subfamily
Orthocoronavirinaeis, can also be demonstrated within the pure comparative analytical framework
(Figures S2 and S3). Within the later, no member of Sarbecovirus clade is an ancestor of SARSCov-2. This static view may be critical in discussing the general simple pattern in hosting of
SARS-Cov-2.
Recent studies of SARS-related coronaviruses have suggested that bats harbor close
relatives to SARS-Cov-2 (for example (21)), and that pangolins may be natural hosts of this
member of genus Betacoronavirus (8, 18, 26), leading to the hypothesis of animal to human
transmission of SARS-Cov-2 ("The presence in pangolins of an RBD very similar to that of

13

SARS-CoV-2 means that we can infer this was also probably in the virus that jumped to humans"
(18)).
However, the search of other hosts, as well as the related exotic ways of transmission of
SARS-Cov-2 from these hypothetical hosts to humans, is based on a set of the complicated
assumptions (for example, "The sequence similarity in the spike receptor binding domain between
SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic
introgression..." (26)) and also ignores the simple possibility of the original human-based hosting
of SARS-Cov-2.
In fact, the hosting of the viruses that are genetically related to SARS-Cov-2 by bats or
pangolins is not, strictly speaking, an argument in favor of the animal hosting of SARS-Cov-2,
especially because the latter virus had never been detected inside of animals such as bats. The
clear possibility of the original human hosting of SARS-Cov-2, unfortunately, had not been
discussed in scientific literature. However, the extremely high contagiousness of SARS-Cov-2 is
almost improbable if the virus had been transmitted from animals to humans just several months
ago. Alternatively, it is possible that a form of SARS-Cov-2 may have been existed in some parts
of the human population before the current pandemic, and that, perhaps, the virus had been
effectively suppressed by the human immune system for a sometime prior. Seven human
coronaviruses have been identified to date (reviewed in (22)), yet at least three of these namely,
Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 from subgenus Embecovirus and NL63 from subgenus
Setracovirus (Table S1) are globally distributed viruses where no animal hosts have been
proposed.
With the information available to date, there is no direct evidence to suggest which
hypothesis, animal to human transmission (either the recent or less recent one (25, 26)) or original
human hosting, is true. The evidence only tells us how viruses are related within a hierarchical
classification (Figure 1).

c. On taxonomy, naming, and nomenclature of the coronaviruses

Because the taxonomy and nomenclature of the viruses are still “under construction” (1316), the names of the virus species frequently remain non-binary, even within the taxonomic
statements of ICTV (13-16). Simultaneously, the current circumscriptions of the two largest
genera of the Coronaviridae (Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses) are very complicated.
For example, current genus Alphacoronavirus currently circumscribes 12 subgenera and current
genus Betacoronavirus circumscribes five subgenera. These two observations cause issues with a
clear naming of viruses on the phylogenetic trees of Coronaviridae, as well as with the reading of
these trees, especially by a non-specialist.
Here we resolved these issues by using the ICTV summaries (13-16) of the subgeneric
names of Coronaviridae as the basic units of our notation where possible in the analyses and trees.
In other words, whenever possible, abbreviations and trivial names were avoided to improve
clarity. The recently discovered SARS-Cov-2 virus and a few related viruses are the exceptions
(Table S1).
Reconsideration of the current circumscriptions of Coronaviridae genera may provide a
simpler and more informative taxonomic system of both naming and nomenclature. Accepting
traditional genera of the family at the rank of a tribe and, simultaneously, the current subgenera
(all of which are monophyletic (Figure 1, Figures S1 - S5)) at the generic rank seems to be the
easiest heuristic way to incorporate the Linnaean principles of the binary nomenclature right to
the classification of the family. For example, the current member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus
(current genus Betacoronavirus) virus SARS-Cov-2 may be easily named Sarbecovirus species,
abbreviation: sp. (e.g.: Sarbecovirus sp.), where “species” (sp.) is any available epithet.
Numerous currently discovered variants of it (summarized in (6)) can be in principle established

as forms of varieties of the same species. The trivial name “severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus 2” and correspondent abbreviation “SARS-Cov-2” can be simply listed in the
description of the species.
It is also critical to consistently involve the type method of biological taxonomy to the
taxonomy of the viruses. As a simple example, we would like to suggest that the ICTV approved
GenBank Accession number (ideally the reference to the whole genome of the virus) can be used
as a nomenclature type of any virus species. For example the GenBank Accession number
MN908947 can be treated as a nomenclature type of newly described Sarbecovirus (SARS-Cov2). Such a number implies the name/abbreviation of the biological isolate as well as other useful
information. The higher nomenclature categories (tribes, genera, families etc.) can be typified by
the names of the species (genera etc.), exactly in a manner of the plant or animal names. The
nomenclature classification of plants and animals has developed over hundreds of years, and as
such is robust and well tested. Adopting the Linnaean binary nomenclature for viruses will
increase the universality of the system, and thereby lead to more consistent information content
and information exchange.
We believe that such simple recommendations are fully consistent with the principles of
the future binary nomenclature of viruses, currently summarized by Siddell et al. (15, 16) and
others (23) and may be useful for the different families of viruses. Such a nomenclature system
would help scientists find information about a particular taxon easily and quickly, which is a high
priority when accurate and timely identification is required during pandemic outbreaks.

Materials and Methods
a. Taxonomic sampling of the study

Thirty nine ICTV-approved genomes (1- 4) of all species of Coronaviridae have
been used in this study (Table S1).
Additionally to these 39 genomes, we also included along with the final
alignments
a. the published genome MN908947 of SARS-Cov-2(5, 6) (Table S1);
b. an unpublished genome of the same virus species (MN988713, Tao et al.,
unpublished) (Table S1);
c. the genome of bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoV-ZC45; MG772933)
(Table S1) that has been previously used in other comparisons to SARS-Cov-2 (for instance
(5-7 and others));
d. - f. bat coronavirus RaTG13 (MN996532 (8) (Table S1)), pangolin coronavirus
(MT121216 (9)) (Table S1) and RmYN02 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_412977) (32) (Table S1)) as
they have previously been proposed as the closest known relatives of SARS-Cov-2 (reviewed
in (9, 10, 32, 33));
g. an additional SARS related genome ZS-B (AY394996) (Table S1).
The genome of recently discovered Microhyla letovirus 1 or MLeV virus
(subgenus Milecovirus) (11) was also included with the alignments and analyses. This
genome was available upon courtesy request from Prof. B. W. Neuman (Texas A&M
University-Texarkana, TX, US) (Table S1).
Based on the summary of Maclachlan et al. (12), genus Torovirus (family
Tobaniviridae, order Nidovirales) was assumed as the best outgroup taxon of Coronaviridae,
and ICTV-approved genome of Torovirus (AY427798) (Table S1) has been selected for this
study.
The names of the major obtained relationships on all trees (Figure S1–S5) excluding
the names of the families and subfamilies, are written in italics due to the strong congruence
with different taxonomic entities. Depending on the context, the names of the clades are
provided in regular and/or curved brackets.
As the utility of phylogenetic trees depends on their clarity, the use of abbreviations
and trivial names of viruses has been avoided whenever possible.

b. Matrices and trees
All genomic alignments have been performed using MAFFT (13, 14, 15)
following FFT-NS-I strategy with the command: mafft --inputorder --adjustdirection -anysymbol --kimura 1 --maxiterate 1000 --6merpair input.
Poorly aligned positions have been removed from
1. the genomic alignment of Coronaviridae plus Torovirus and
2. the genomic alignment of subfamily Orthocoronavirinae with no outgroups
included

using the program G-block (16) as implemented in SeaView (17) under the conditions of
“less stringent” strategy of the algorithm (16, 17).
The G-block version of the genomic alignment of Coronaviridae plus Torovirus
was also established as a binary matrix using simple “presence – absence” coding (reviewed
in (18)) with the future inclusion of the “all-plesiomorphic” (“all-zero”) artificial taxon. In
short, G-block based genomic alignment of the family Coronaviridae plus Torovirus was
rewritten as a binary (01) matrix, where “zero” means “the absence of a nucleotide in this
particular position of the alignment”, and “one” means “the presence of the nucleotide in this
particular position of the same alignment”. For example, if the character-state of the character
number 253 is equal to A (Adenine), than this can be written as “1000”, where “1” means
“the A is present in position 253”, and “0” indicates that U(T), G and C are simultaneously
absent on the same position.
Assuming that the “absence of the nucleotide” (the character-state “zero”) is a
plesiomorphic character-state, we can add to the binary matrix “all-plesiomorphic” or “allzeros” outgroup. The binary matrix with an “all-zeros” outgroup added was later used as an
input into the script Forester v. 1.0 (19) following the command ruby trees.rb
path_to_matrix_file (19) with future selection of the “Additional” forest of the maximal trees
(relationships) (19) for Average Consensus (AC) analysis (19-21).
Manipulations with either the molecular or binary matrices and the tree-files have
been performed with Mesquite v. 3.51 (22), PAUP* v. 4.0a (23) and FigTree v. 1.4.2 (24).
3. Analyses
The G-block version of the molecular alignment of Coronaviridae plus Torovirus
was analysed by the standard Maximum Parsimony (MP) approach (Fitch Parsimony,
reviewed in (18)), and by the three-taxon statement analysis (3TA) with fractional weighting
(reviewed in (18, 27, 28) and implemented in Mavrodiev and Madorsky (29)).
Following the logic of Williams-Siebert (WS) representation of the unordered
multistate data (reviewed in (29)) the three-taxon statement (3TS) permutations of the Gblock-based alignment of Coronaviridae plus Torovirus were conducted with TAXODIUM
version 1.2 using the command: taxodium.exe input_file_name.csv –idna –ob –og –fw –nex
(29) taking values of the operational outgroup as equal to the values of Torovirus.
All MP analyses have been performed in PAUP* (23) as in Mavrodiev et al. and Mavrodiev
and Madorsky (19, 29). The resulted most parsimonious tree resulted standard MP analysis
was a posteriori rooted relative to Torovirus.
The AC (20, 21) of the array of maximal trees was calculated using the program
Clann version 4.1.5 (25, 26) as described in Mavrodiev et al. (19). The distance optimality
criterion for the AC analysis was specified as a “distance with non-weighted least squares”
(20, 21, 23, 25).
Following conclusions of Zhou, X. et al.(30), the Maximum Likelihood (ML)
analysis of G-block alignment of Coronaviridae plus Torovirus was conducted with W-IQTREE (31) with implemented automatic model selection procedure (31). The resulted most
probable tree was a posteriori rooted relative to Torovirus.
The MP Bootstrap support (BS) values have been calculated as described in (29)
and (31). In the case of the ML analysis, the aLRT support values have been calculated
instead of the ML BS supports, as implemented W-IQ-TREE (31).

syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) (MN908947) with no aligned positions
excluded (Table S3), was calculated in PAUP*(23) under the default options.
d. Supplementary Text

The genomic alignment of Coronaviridae + Torovirus (outgroup) consists of 52,990
molecular characters (base pairs or bp), the G-block version of this alignment is of 22,489
characters with 19,550 of those are parsimony-informative. This alignment was the target of
future MP, 3TA, AC and ML analyses.
The genomic alignment of subfamily Orthocoronavirinae with no outgrop included is
of 49,881 bp. The G-block version of this alignment consists of 23,431 bp. Later, the
alignment has been used only to calculate the simplest pairwise distances (“total character
differences”) between all of the members of the subfamily included in the analyses (Table
S2). The genomic alignment of bat coronaviruses RmYN02, RaTG13 and severe acute
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) (MN908947) is of 29,907
molecular characters. This alignment with no characters excluded was used to calculate the
total character differences (Table S3) between newly discovered SARS-Cov-2 and two of its
closest relatives. Such a measure is the simplest expression of the pairwise distance between
aligned molecular sequences and indicates solely the total number of different single
nucleotide positions (or SNPs) between them. For example, the number 1138 in the Table S3
means that the aligned genomes of human coronavirus SARS Cov 2 (accession “a”) and the
bat coronavirus RaTG13 are different from each other by 1138 SNPs. For instance, in
position # 37 of the same molecular alignment the value of SARS Cov 2 is equal to “C” and
the value of RaTG13 is equal to “G”. The total number of such SNPs equals 1138.
The standard MP analysis of the 22,489 bp G-block alignment resulted in the single
most parsimonious tree of 208,176 steps (CI = 0.2505, RI = 0.4954) (Figure S1).
The 3TS representation of the same 22,489 bp G-block alignment resulted 39,621,820
3TSs (binary characters), all parsimony-informative and fractionally weighted, with the most
parsimonious fit of 20,786,459.7424 steps (RI = 0.5706) (Figure S2).
The presence-absence re-coding of the genomic alignment of Coronaviridae +
Torovirus resulted in a matrix of 73,258 binary characters from which 65,435 characters can
be established as a rooted trees (maximal relationships). The AC analyses of the forest of
these 65,435 relationships resulted in a single AC tree of the score 0.00911 (Figure S3).
For ML analysis of the 22,489 bp G-block matrix of Coronaviridae and outgroup
(Torovirus), GTR+F+R10 model has been automatically selected by W-IQ-TREE as a bestfit model based on either corrected and non-corrected Akaike Information Criteria, as well as
on Bayesian Information Criterion. The resulted single most probable (ML) tree has the best
score (log likelihood) equal to -766940.2344 (Figure S4).

Figure S1.
Single most parsimonious tree recovered from the standard MP analysis (Fitch Parsimony) of the
22,489 bp genomic alignment of Coronaviridae + Torovirus. Tree was a posteriori rooted
relative to Torovirus.
Figure S2.
Most parsimonious hierarchy of patterns recovered from MP analysis (Wagner parsimony) of
39,621,820 3TS WS representation of the 22,489 bp genomic alignment of Coronaviridae +
Torovirus. The values of the operational outgroup were fixed as values of Torovirus.
Figure S3.
The average consensus tree from the analysis of the forest of 65,435 rooted trees (maximal
relationships) derived from the “presence-absence” representation of the original 22,489 bp
genomic alignment of Coronaviridae + Torovirus.
Figure S4.
Most probable tree recovered from the ML analysis of the 22,489 bp genomic alignment of
Coronaviridae + Torovirus. Tree was a posteriori rooted relative to Torovirus.
Figure S5.
Strict Consensus of four trees produced by three different methods of cladistic analysis as well as
by Maximum Likelihood method using modified genomic alignment of Coronaviridae +
Torovirus (Figures S1 – S4).
