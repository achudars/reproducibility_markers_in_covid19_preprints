Abstract

31

Multiplexed bead-based assays that use Luminex xMAP® technology have become popular for

32

measuring antibodies against proteins of interest in many fields, including malaria and more recently

33

SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. There are currently two formats that are widely used: non-magnetic beads or

34

magnetic beads. Data is lacking regarding the comparability of results obtained using these two types

35

of beads, and for assays run on different instruments. Whilst non-magnetic beads can only be run on

36

flow-based instruments (such as the Luminex® 100/200™ or Bio-Plex® 200), magnetic beads can be

37

run on both these and the newer MAGPIX® instruments. In this study we utilized a panel of purified

38

recombinant Plasmodium vivax proteins and samples from malaria-endemic areas to measure P. vivax-

39

specific IgG responses using different combinations of beads and instruments. We directly compared: i)

40

non-magnetic versus magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex® 200, ii) magnetic beads run on the Bio-Plex®

41

200 versus MAGPIX® and iii) non-magnetic beads run on a Bio-Plex® 200 versus magnetic beads run

42

on the MAGPIX®. We also performed an external validation of our optimized assay. We observed that

43

IgG antibody responses, measured against our panel of P. vivax proteins, were strongly correlated in all

44

three of our comparisons, however higher amounts of protein were required for coupling to magnetic

45

beads. Our external validation indicated that results generated in different laboratories using the same

46

coupled beads are also highly comparable, particularly if a reference standard curve is used.

Introduction

49

Over the past 5-10 years there has been a rapid uptake of Luminex bead-based technologies to

50

measure antibody responses to multiple proteins simultaneously. These assays have numerous

51

advantages over traditional enzyme-linked immuosorbent assays (ELISA), such as a reduction in

52

sample volume required and reduced laboratory time, as well as the main advantage of allowing

53

multiplexed detection of antibody responses. This is particularly relevant for the detection of antibodies

54

against complex pathogens that express many hundreds to thousands of proteins, such as the

55

Plasmodium parasites (the causative agent of malaria). Access to standardized control reagents [1] will

56

also allow results from these assays to be reliably compared between different laboratories, which may

57

result in more consistent findings between different studies [2].

58
59

Multiplexed bead-based assays use Luminex xMAP® technology [3], which centers on use of beads

60

(microspheres) with different fluorescent colours that can be detected in unique regions on a

61

compatible instrument such as a Luminex® 200™ (also known as a Bio-Plex® 200, sold by Bio-Rad) or

62

MAGPIX®. Proteins of interest can be coupled to a unique set of beads, facilitating multiplexed

63

detection of antibody responses to multiple proteins. Several studies have been conducted with a focus

64

on optimizing various steps of the coupling process or assay work-flow, in the context of detection of

65

antibodies against Plasmodium proteins, such as bead coupling [4], sample pre-dilution [4], assay

66

temperature [4], plate washing [4], operator expertise [4], incubation times [1], and bead numbers [5].

67

Two different types of beads are available for coupling proteins: non-magnetic and magnetic. Non-

68

magnetic beads can only be run on flow-based instruments such as the Luminex® 200™/Bio-Plex® 200,

69

whilst magnetic beads can be run on both, flow-based instruments and the MAGPIX®. The MAGPIX® is

70

based on CCD imaging technology, and offers advantages over the flow-based systems such as faster

71

acquisition time, reduced use of reagents such as sheath fluid and the reduced cost of the MAGPIX®

72

instrument compared to the Luminex® 200™/Bio-Plex® 200 instruments.

73
74

The primary aim of this study was to perform a series of comparisons of both non-magnetic and

75

magnetic beads and assaying those beads on the Bio-Plex® 200 or the MAGPIX®. A secondary aim

76

was to demonstrate that this assay is highly reproducible in an independent laboratory through an

77

external validation. This study used a panel of 19 different P. vivax proteins and plasma samples from

78

P. vivax-endemic areas to detect P. vivax-specific IgG responses, however the large number of

79

proteins assessed and consistent results obtained, suggest these findings should be generalizable for

80

optimization of the multiplexed bead-based assay for other pathogens. This is important in the context

Materials and methods

85

Plasma samples

86

For all assays described here, a pool of samples from individuals from Papua New Guinea (PNG) with

87

high levels of anti-Plasmodium antibodies was used as a positive control for the standard curve dilution

88

to adjust for plate to plate variation, as previously described [9].

89
90

Two sets of plasma samples from malaria-endemic areas were used for comparisons of non-magnetic

91

and magnetic beads, and the different acquisition instruments. These were 80 individuals from a

92

longitudinal observational cohort study in Thailand, conducted in the Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi

93

provinces in 2013-2014. This cohort has previously been described in detail [10, 11], and the 80 plasma

94

samples used were collected at the last visit of the cohort. The second set of samples came from a

95

longitudinal observational cohort study in the Solomon Islands, conducted on the island Ngella in 2013-

96

2014. This cohort has previously been described in detail [10, 12], and 83 plasma samples were used

97

from individuals at the last visit of this cohort.

98
99

An additional set of plasma samples from a cohort study in PNG was used for external validation of the

100

assay. Samples were selected from the Mugil II paediatric cohort study. The study enrolled 450 children

101

aged 5-12 years old in 2012 from the Mugil area on the North Coast of Madang province. All children

102

were given antimalarial drugs to eliminate blood-stage Plasmodium spp and blood samples were

103

collected for parasitological and immunological studies. For the external validation, a set of 425

104

samples was used from the baseline timepoint (collected 2 weeks after drug treatment).

Ethics statement

107

All samples were collected after approval from local ethics committees, with volunteers/participants

108

providing written informed consent and/or assent. The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Tropical

109

Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand approved the Thai cohort study (MUTM 2013-027-01). The

110

National Health Research and Ethics Committee of the Solomon Islands Ministry of Health and Medical

111

Services (HRC12/022) approved the Solomon Islands study. The Mugil II paediatric cohort was

112

approved by the PNG Institute of Medical Research Institutional Review Board (IMR IRB) (1116/1204),

113

the PNG Medical Research Advisory Committee (MRAC) (11.21/1206), the Walter and Eliza Hall

114

Institute Human Research Ethics Committee (WEHI HREC) (12/09), and the Case Western Reserve

115

University Hospitals of Cleveland Medical Center (CWRU UHCMC) (05-11-11). The HREC at WEHI

116

approved samples for use in Melbourne (#14/02).

Coupling P. vivax proteins to non-magnetic and magnetic beads

119

The carboxylated beads were sourced from Bio-Rad (Bio-Plex COOH Beads, 1ml, 1.25x107 beads/ml

120

and Bio-Plex Pro Magnetic COOH Beads, 1ml, 1.25x107 bead/ml) and stored at 2-4°C. Optimisation of

121

coupling procedures for non-magnetic and magnetic beads were done separately, due to the larger size

122

of the magnetic beads generally requiring more protein (see Results). To be able to measure all plasma

123

samples at the same dilution, we optimized all protein concentrations by generating a log-linear

124

standard curve with a positive control plasma pool from immune PNG donors (high responders to

125

Plasmodium antigens).

126
127

Coupling of P. vivax proteins to non-magnetic beads was performed as previously described [10].

128

Briefly, the optimised antigen concentration (Tables 1 and 2) was coupled to 2.5x106 pre-activated

129

microspheres, in 100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, using 50mg/ml sulfo-NHS and

130

50 mg/ml of EDC to cross-link the proteins to the beads. The activated beads were washed and stored

131

in PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween-20, 0.05% Na-azide, pH 7.4 at 4°C until use. For the coupling to

132

magnetic beads, a magnet rack was used for pelleting the beads, instead of the centrifugation step for

133

non-magnetic beads. We qualitatively assessed the stability of the coupled beads by visual comparison

134

of the MFI of the standard curve over a nine-month period.

135
136

Plasmodium vivax recombinant antigens were expressed and purified in three countries: Japan

(Takafumi Tsuboi, Ehime University & Matthias Harbers, CellFree Sciences), Australia (Wai-Hong

138

Tham and Julie Healer, Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research) and France (Chetan Chitnis,

Institut Pasteur). Proteins were expressed either in the wheat-germ cell-free expression system

140

(WGCF) or E. coli. See Table 1 for a complete list of proteins and the optimised amount coupled to

Multiplexed assay for measurement of P. vivax-specific antibody responses

149

To measure the IgG levels, a multiplexed bead based assay was used, as previously described [10].

150

Briefly, antigen-specific IgG was detected by incubating 500 beads of each antigen per well with

151

plasma diluted at 1:100, in a final volume of 100μl. Non-magnetic beads were washed using a vacuum

152

manifold, whereas magnetic beads were washed using a magnetic plate washer. After the washings, a

153

1:100 dilution of PE-conjugated Donkey F(ab)2 anti-human IgG (JIR 709-116-098) was added. At least

154

15 beads of each region/antigen were then acquired and analysed on a Bio-Plex® 200 instrument

155

and/or a MAGPIX® instrument as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Note that for comparing data

156

between Bio-Plex® 200 and MAGPIX® instruments it is important that the “high RP1” target is not

selected on the Bio-Plex® 200, as this option is not available on the MAGPIX®. On each plate, a twofold

158

serial dilution from 1/50 to 1/25,600 of a seropositive control plasma pool (generated from PNG adults)

159

was included. Note that for the external validation both labs used the same PNG control pool to

160

generate the standard curve.

161
162

The results were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of at least 15 beads for each antigen.

163
164

Instruments

165

Antibody measurements were acquired using a Bio-Plex® 200 Multiplexing Analyzer System from Bio-

166

Rad for all non-magnetic coupled beads (Bio-Plex® 200System, Bio-Plex high-throughput fluidics

167

system, microplate platform and a computer with the Bio-Plex manager software v.5.0). Washing

168

steps were carried out on a Bio-Rad Aurum vacuum manifold.

169
170

For all magnetic coupled beads a MAGPIX® Multiplexing System from Millipore was used (MAGPIX®

171

System and the Xponent software V.4.2). Washing steps were carried out using a magnetic plate

172

washer from BioTek Instruments (BioTek ELx50). A Bio-Rad Sure Beads magnetic rack was used

173

during the coupling process.

174
175

Plates were incubated on a Ratek Platform shaker (Microtiter/PCR Plate Shaker). A Vortex Sonicator

176

(Branson 2200), a BioSan Vortex V-1 plus and a Table centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424) were

177

also used during the coupling process.

178
179

Statistical analysis

180

The raw MFI results were converted to relative antibody units (RAU) using protein-specific standard

181

curve data. A log–log model was used to obtain a more linear relationship, and a five-parameter logistic

182

function was used to obtain an equivalent dilution value compared to the PNG control plasma (ranging

183

from 1.95×10−5 to 0.02). The interpolation was performed in R. Pearson’s r2 correlations were

184

performed to determine the strength of correlation and the statistical significance for all comparisons.

185

To enable these parametric correlations, data were log-transformed prior to the analysis to better fit the

186

normal distribution.

Results and discussion

189

Comparison of total IgG antibodies detected against P. vivax antigens coupled to either non-

190

magnetic or magnetic beads and assayed by a Bio-Plex® 200 instrument.

191

Total IgG antibody levels against a panel of 19 P. vivax proteins, measured in plasma samples from

192

163 individuals living in malaria-endemic areas of Thailand and the Solomon Islands, were assayed

193

using either non-magnetic or magnetic beads and run on a Bio-Plex® 200 instrument. IgG levels to 18

194

of 19 proteins were well correlated between non-magnetic and magnetic assays, with Pearson r2-

195

values ranging from 0.29-0.95 (all p<0.0001) (Figure 1), supporting previous findings based on P.

196

falciparum proteins [13]. This is despite different amounts of each protein being coupled to non-

197

magnetic versus magnetic beads (Table 1). The exception was for the protein PVX_003770 (MSP5),

198

with the lowest correlation coefficient at r2=0.075 (p<0.001). A sub-set of the samples that had relatively

199

high antibody levels for PVX_003770 when assayed with non-magnetic beads had relatively low

200

antibody levels when assayed with magnetic beads, likely accounting for the lower correlation

201

coefficient observed. Interestingly, the amount of protein coupled for PVX_003770 (for both non-

202

magnetic and magnetic beads) was substantially lower than for the other proteins. Future experiments

203

are planned to determine whether increasing the protein amount for PVX_003770 could result in a

204

higher correlation between the two platforms.

215

this is the first published report of this comparison. Here, the Pearson r2 correlation coefficients

216

indicated a high level of correlation between samples run on both instruments (r2=0.970-0.999,

217

p<0.0001, Figure 2). These results indicate that results obtained on either platform, when antigens are

218

coupled at the same optimised concentrations to magnetic beads, are highly comparable. The strength

219

of the correlations in this comparison is stronger than the previous analysis (which compared non-

220

magnetic versus magnetic beads on the same instrument), presumably because the same sets of

221

coupled beads were run on both instruments. The strength of the correlations suggests that results

222

obtained on the Bio-Plex® 200 and MAGPIX® are interchangeable.

231

The final comparison we wanted to conduct was of antigens coupled to non-magnetic beads and

232

assayed on a Bio-Plex® 200 instrument with antigens coupled to magnetic beads and assayed on a

233

MAGPIX® instrument. As non-magnetic beads are cheaper to purchase, users that have only a Bio-

234

Plex® 200 instrument would potentially favour this configuration (even though the instrument can run

235

both non-magnetic and magnetic beads). Conversely, for users that only have a MAGPIX® instrument,

236

they are only able to run magnetic beads as the instrument cannot detect non-magnetic beads. To our

237

knowledge, this is the first published report of this comparison for a non-commercial assay.

238
239

It was again observed that there was a strong correlation between results obtained using the non-

240

magnetic beads/Bio-Plex® 200 and magnetic beads/MAGPIX® platforms, with Pearson r2 correlation

241

coefficients ranging from 0.18-96 (p<0.0001, Figure 3). These correlation coefficients are similar to

242

those obtained in the first comparison (non-magnetic versus magnetic beads both run on the Bio-Plex®

243

200 instrument), and provide further support for our finding that antigens coupled to either type of

244

beads and run on either instrument generally give very comparable total IgG measurements. As we

245

observed in the first comparison, the weakest correlation was again for the protein PVX_003770

246

(r2=0.18).

The results thus far indicate that IgG levels measured using either non-magnetic or magnetic beads

255

and assayed on either a Bio-Plex® 200 or MAGPIX® instrument are highly comparable. A group of 3

257

instruments, performed these measurements. Therefore an additional comparison was performed:

258

external validation of the assay at an independent research Institute located overseas (Case Western

259

Reserve University, CWRU).

260
261

A set of 425 plasma samples were aliquoted at CWRU and shared with WEHI. At the same time, a set

262

of 12 P. vivax proteins (Table 2) were coupled to non-magnetic beads at WEHI and shared with CWRU.

263

During the same week assays were performed to measure total IgG antibodies against these P. vivax

264

antigens in the 425 plasma samples on Bio-Plex® 200 instruments independently at each Institute (total

265

of 6 plates run at each Institute). After exclusion of plates or samples following quality control checks

266

(positive control – log-linear standard curve; bead counts > 15), data from 318 samples was directly

267

compared between sites. The drop from 425 to 318 samples was largely due to one plate with failed

268

standard curves that could not be repeated due to sample availability. IgG levels were compared first

269

using raw data (MFI values). The Pearson r2 correlation coefficients indicated a strong correlation for all

270

proteins with r2-values > 0.58 (p<0.0001), with the exception of PVX_094255 (RBP2b) (r2=0.32,

271

p<0.0001) (Table 3, scatter plots in Figure S1). The same correlation analysis was then performed on

272

data converted in R using the standard curves (to account for any plate-plate variation). Strong

273

correlation coefficients were observed for all 12 proteins, including PVX_094255 (r2 values >0.51,

274

p<0.0001) (Table 3, scatter plots in Figure S2). For the majority of proteins, the correlation was stronger

275

after conversion (Table 3). This is expected given the conversion, based on the standard curve

276

generated with a plasma pool from immune PNG donors, is used to account for any plate-plate

277

variation.

278
279

These results indicate that data generated using this multiplexed assay are highly reproducible in a

280

different laboratory setting when the same coupled-beads are used, particularly if both laboratories

281

have access to the same positive control for standardization. Unfortunately, whilst there is a WHO

282

reference reagent for P. falciparum serology studies [14], there is not yet a similar product available for

283

P. vivax. Importantly, we also assessed the stability of the coupled beads by running the standard curve

284

10 times over a period of 9 months (intensely for 2 months) (Figure S3). For most proteins the coupled

285

beads were highly stable (11/16 tested over 9-months), with the MFI dropping for three proteins and

286

increasing for two proteins. This is supported by previous research that has indicated the stability of

287

protein-coupled beads [13], noting that the stability may vary by antigen [15].

Conclusions

294

The aim of this study was to demonstrate that multiplexing assays performed using magnetic beads or

295

non-magnetic beads are highly comparable, independent of the beads and platform used to analyze the

296

assays. We compared here a total of 19 P. vivax proteins that were coupled to both magnetic beads

297

and non-magnetic beads. The protein concentration used for the couplings was individually determined

298

by optimisation for each protein for the chosen bead type (Table 1). For this, a dilution series from the

299

positive control plasma pool, prepared from immune PNG donors, was used to generate a log-linear

300

standard curve for each protein. The non-magnetic beads are 5.5μm in size, whilst the magnetic beads

16

301

are 6.5μm in size, likely accounting for the need to couple on average 0.3μg of protein to non-magnetic

302

versus 0.8 μg of protein to magnetic beads (per 1x106 beads). One coupling reaction using these

303

amounts of protein is enough to assay > 3000 samples in singlicate, thus the slightly higher amount of

304

protein required for magnetic beads is unlikely to be a limitation to using this format. We did not assess

305

the efficiency of antigen coupling, which could potentially be an important variable impacting the

306

amount of protein required for coupling.

307
308

We have demonstrated that results are highly comparable whether using proteins coupled to magnetic

309

beads or non-magnetic beads and analysed using either a Bio-Plex® 200 (non-magnetic and magnetic

310

beads) or MAGPIX® (magnetic beads only). Our external validation has also demonstrated that results

311

generated in different laboratories are highly comparable, if a reference standard curve is included for

312

standardization. Therefore researchers can, in principle, compare data generated with a different type

313

of bead or assayed using a different instrument platform, if the amount of protein coupled is optimised

314

for the correct type of bead. Overall, the choice of assay platform and instrument used is up to the user.

315

Table 4 lists a number of factors that differ between the two platforms that users should consider. An

316

important consideration is that up to 100 different proteins can be assayed simultaneously using non-

317

magnetic beads and a Bio-Plex® 200 instrument, whereas the maximum is 50 proteins using a

318

MAGPIX®. If less than 50 proteins will be used, the MAGPIX® instrument is cheaper and enables

319

washing steps to be conducted with magnets, which improves both bead retention [13, 16] and speed

320

of the assay.

321
322

For future use and development of the assay, we recommended that a reference laboratory provide

323

both protein-coupled beads and a positive control, along with a Standard Operating Procedure for the

324

assay. All protein-coupled beads should be tested for stability and researchers provided with an expiry

325

date for their use, in addition to checking the performance of the standard curve before each use. This

326

should ensure repeatable and comparable measurements are generated between different research

Whilst these results were obtained in the context of P. vivax-specific IgG responses in individuals from

333

malaria-endemic areas, the large panel of proteins used and consistent results obtained for all proteins

334

suggest these results can be applied to guide studies in other fields. Luminex xMAP® technology has

335

been used to measure antibody responses against other infectious pathogens, such as HIV and

336

influenza [17, 18], to a variety of vaccine antigens such as tetanus toxoid [19], and more recently to

337

SARS-CoV-2 [6-8].
