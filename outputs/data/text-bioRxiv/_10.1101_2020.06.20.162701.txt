Abstract

21

Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of animals and birds. Their tropism is primarily

22

determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid

23

outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the

24

development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural

25

compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based

26

pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from

27

natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses

28

specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies

29

neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2

30

inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and

31

DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv

32

respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors,

33

Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were

34

blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green

35

tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of

36

spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to

37

understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped

38

virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors. Moreover, spirulina and green tea could

39

be promising antiviral agents against emerging viruses.

Introduction

44

The past three decades have witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of highly pathogenic

45

emerging viruses [1] which have caused serious global threats initiating diverse approaches for

46

understanding the biology of the virus and for robust vaccine and therapeutic development.

47

Coronaviruses are notable examples of zoonotic emerging viruses which can infect a diverse range

48

of mammals and birds including humans [2]. The major outbreak of human coronaviruses occurred

49

in 2003 wherein Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV emerged from Chinese palm

50

civet and caused an epidemic in China with more than 8000 cases including 774 fatal cases [3].

51

With the help of public health authorities, the outbreak was effectively contained within six

52

months. Ten years later, another CoV termed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV

53

emerged from dromedary camel to human and is continuing to cause outbreaks in the Middle East

54

region [4]. To date, 2519 cases have been reported with mortality rates of 34% [5]. There is no

55

approved therapy or vaccine available for this virus yet. By the end of 2019, another pandemic

56

coronavirus named Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in

57

Wuhan, China [6] though unknown intermediate host. Till now, more than 8,000,000 cases and

58

450,000 deaths have been reported worldwide [7]. Likewise, novel or re-emerging viral outbreaks

59

may occur in the near future as well. Therefore, effective antiviral and therapeutic strategies are

60

required to control the ongoing or future outbreaks.

61

Coronavirus spike protein is a promising target for the development of antiviral compounds

62

because their cell tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to

63

a host cell surface receptor and can block the virus entry at the early stage of infection. But drug

64

discovery for highly pathogenic viruses like SARS, MERS, Ebola, Lassa, or SARS-2 are

65

challenging due to the requirement for a BSL-3/BSL-4 laboratory containment facility. However,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.162701; this version posted June 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

66

very limited facilities are available, especially in developing countries. Pseudotyped viruses

67

provide a substitute model in which the native envelope protein of a nonpathogenic BSL-2 virus

68

(vesicular stomatitis virus) replaced with an envelope glycoprotein of a highly pathogenic virus

69

like SARS, MERS, Ebola, or SARS-2 [8]. These viruses mimic a normal virus but are

70

noninfectious in nature. Moreover, they are replication-incompetent with a single round of

71

infection and hence can be used to do research in the routine BSL-2 laboratories. Pseudotyped

72

viruses have been used in diagnostics, vaccines, and high-throughput screening of entry inhibitors

73

for several BSL-3/BSL-4 level pathogens [8].

74
75

Natural products such as plants, algae, and seaweeds have always been implicated in multiple

76

fields of biology for their antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. Several medicinal

77

plants have been traditionally used to treat viral infections [9] and have been demonstrated with

78

their ability of their inhibitory effects (Table 1) on the replication or entry of several viruses like

79

herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, hepatitis B (HBV), influenza virus [10]–[13]and also other

80

emerging viral pathogens such as poxvirus and SARS [14]. Curcumin acts as an antiviral agent

81

against several viruses such as Parainfluenza virus type 3, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), HSV,

82

etc. [15]. Diammonium glycyrrhizin the main component of licorice root extract shown to have an

83

inhibitory effect on pseudorabies virus (PrV) [16]. Neem and Tulsi leaf extracts are potent antiviral

84

agents against influenza virus [17], [18]. Moreover, the extract of green tea, another natural

85

compound, inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), zika virus, influenza virus, and

86

hepatitis C virus (HCV) [19].

87

Spirulina is a commercially available dietary supplement which has been recorded for its diverse

88

properties. It is a free-floating cyanobacterium, which has 70% protein content and is rich in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.162701; this version posted June 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

89

phenolic acids, essential fatty acids, sulfated polysaccharides, and vitamin B12 [20]. Extracts of

90

Spirulina have been shown to have antiviral activity against multiple enveloped viruses including

91

influenza virus, HSV, adenovirus, etc.[21] Apart from crude plant extracts, several specific

92

compounds from Green tea, catechins, such as epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC),

93

epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) have been found to have

94

antiviral and anticarcinogenic properties [22] (Supplementary table 1). EGCG is a major

95

component and active catechin of green tea and has several bio modulatory effects such as anti-

96

allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidative, and antiviral properties. EGCG, has been

97

reported to inhibit HCV, HIV, HSV type 1 and 2, enterovirus 71, influenza A, and other viruses

98

[10], [23]–[27]. For HIV, EGCG binds to the CD4 molecule at high affinity and inhibits HIV

99

gp120 binding to human CD4+ T cells [28]. Moreover, the EGCG-induced inhibition was observed

100

in a broad spectrum of HIV-1 subtypes as well. EGCG acts through direct inactivation of the virus

101

particle, inhibition of the protease adenain, and intracellular growth in vitro [29]. Sulfated

102

polysaccharides and Spirulan like compounds are the major components of spirulina extract, which

103

inhibits the entry of several viruses including HSV-1, hepatitis A, human cytomegalovirus

104

(HCMV), VSV, and HIV [13]. This clearly shows the importance of antiviral properties of natural

105

compounds, and hence could be promising therapeutic agents for emerging viral diseases including

106

SARS-CoV 2. In this study, we show the biological applications of pseudotyped coronaviruses

107

and the antiviral activity of Spirulina and green tea extracts using the developed pseudotyped

108

coronaviruses.

113

Huh7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza, 12-115F) with 10% FCS and 1%

114

penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.

115

Plasmids. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) gene (2.4kb) was PCR amplified from

116

cDNA of Vero E6 cells and the resulted amplicon was inserted between KpnI/XbaI restriction sites

117

in PCDNA3.1+ expression vector (pCDNA-ACE2). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)(2.3kb) was

118

amplified from cDNA of Huh7 cells, as described previously [30], cloned between BamHI/NotI

119

in PCDNA3.1+ expression vector (pCDNA-DPP4). A synthetic construct of the full-length spike

120

121

coding sequence of spike S1 domain of SARS-2(aa residues 1-683), SARS (1-676), and MERS

122

(1-747) were amplified from synthetic spike construct and cDNA of SARS- and MERS-CoV

123

respectively. Amplicons were fused C-terminally with Fc domain of human immunoglobulin

124

125

(pCAGGS-SARS2-S1-Fc, pCAGGS-SARS-S1-Fc, pCAGGS-MERS-S1-Fc). For the production

126

of soluble ACE2, gene sequence encoding amino acid residues 1-635 was PCR amplified from

127

pcDNA-ACE2 plasmid introduced between N terminal CD5 signal sequence and C Terminal 6X

128

HIS- tag in pCAGGS-CD5 plasmid by Kpn1/Xho1 (pCAGGS-sACE2).

1%FCS. The cell supernatant was harvested after 24h post-infection (pi), cell debris was removed

136

by centrifugation at 3000rpm for 10 minutes and aliquots were stored at -80°C. For titration assay,

137

a day before the experiment Vero E6 and Huh7 cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at 2x104 cells

138

per well and 100µl of serially diluted (1:10) pseudoviruses were added to the cells and incubated

139

for 1h. After incubation, cells were washed and replaced with fresh DMEM with 1% FBS and

140

were incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 24h. GFP positive cells were counted and were

141

normalized to VSV∆G –GFP background values. The lowest dilution of the pseudovirus with GFP

142

positive cells was calculated and viral titer was calculated as infection units /ml as mentioned

143

previously [31], [32].

144

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Pseudoviruses were concentrated using Amicon

145

3kDa cut off columns (Merck, UFC800324). Tem micro liters of glutaraldehyde (2.5%) fixed

146

samples were drop casted on formvar carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 1%

147

Uranyl acetate alternative solution for 1 minute (TED PELLA, Cat. No- 19485). The grids were

148

washed twice with distilled water to remove the excess stain and followed by imaging on Tecnai,

149

FEI Transmission electron microscope at 120 kV.

150

Production of recombinant proteins. Ten micrograms of plasmids encoding either spike S1-Fc

151

or sACE2 (pCAGGS-SARS2-S1-Fc, pCAGGS-SARS-S1-Fc, pCAGGS-MERS-S1-Fc, and

152

pCAGGS-sACE2) were independently transfected using PEI in HEK293T cells. After 12h post-

153

transfection, cells were replaced with fresh, freestyle expression media, and the cells were

154

incubated for 5 days at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. Recombinant Fc fused S1 proteins containing

155

supernatants were harvested and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at

156

1500rpm. S1 -Fc proteins were purified using Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life

157

sciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were eluted from the column using

158

0.5M glacial acetic acid pH 3 and neutralized with 3M Tris-Hcl PH 8.8. Quality and quantity of

159

the purified proteins were analyzed by nanodrop, BCA, and SDS-PAGE. Further confirmed by

160

western blotting using Goat-anti human IgG conjugated with HRP (Bethyl, A80-119P). Soluble

161

ACE 2 was purified using Nickel -NTA agarose beads (Qiagen Cat.No-1018244), eluted with

162

200mM imidazole, and was analyzed by SDS PAGE and western blot using Goat anti-human ACE

163

2 polyclonal antibody (R&D, Cat.No-AF933).

164

sACE2 blocking assay. sACE2 (5µg/ml PBS) was preincubated with SARS2pv, SARSpv, and

165

MERSpv at 37°C for 1h and then the mixture was directly added on Vero E6 cells for 1h. After

166

incubation, the cells were replaced with fresh DMEM with 1% FCS and antibiotics and incubated

167

for 24h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. Next day, GFP positive cells were counted and calculated as

168

the relative percentage of infection.

169

Pseudovirus neutralization assay. SARS and MERS CoV polyclonal antibodies (gifted by Bart

and SARS-2pv and MERS polyclonal with MERSpv (1:100 dilution) at 37°C for 1h. Then the

172

antibody virus mixture was directly added on Vero E6 cells. 1hpi, infection medium was replaced

173

with fresh DMEM with 1% FCS and was incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 24h. GFP

microscope 63x oil objective.

182

Cold water extraction of Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) and Green Tea. Spirulina and green

183

tea are available in routine organic/medical stores. Spirulina was purchased as capsules or powder

184

and green tea was purchased as dried leaves. Extracts were prepared as described elsewhere [33].

185

Briefly, Spirulina and green tea were powdered using mortar and pestle and the fine powder was

186

weighed at 20mg/ml concentration and were mixed in sterile distilled water and vortexed for 5

187

min. Next, the mixtures were freeze-thawed and the supernatants were collected by centrifugation.

188

Supernatants were filter sterilized using a 0.22µm membrane filter and stored at 4 °C until further

189

use.

190

Screening of antivirals against pseudotyped coronaviruses. In the first series of experiments

191

we incubated the cells with either Spirulina, green tea extracts or DMEM. After 30 minutes

192

incubation, cells were replaced with 100microlitre of all the four pseudotyped viruses. Parallelly,

193

we incubated all the fours pvs as well with the extracts or DMEM. After 30 minutes of incubation,

194

the mixtures were directly added to confluent Vero E6 cells and incubated for 1h. Then the cells

195

were washed and added with fresh DMEM 1% FCS and antibiotics. Next day, GFP positive cells

196

were counted and the percentage of infection was calculated.

197

Spike and receptor interaction studies by S1-Fc binding analysis. HEK293T cells were

transfected with either pCDNA-ACE2 or pCDNA-DPP4 plasmids. 24h post-transfection, spike

199

S1-Fc proteins (5µg/ml) of SARS, SARS-2 and MERS CoV and the cells were independently

200

treated with Spirulina and green tea extract for 90 min at 37°C. In the first set of experiments,

201

untreated spike S1-Fc proteins were added to pretreated cells followed by binding assay at 4°C. In

202

the next set of experiments, the preincubated extract - spike S1-Fc protein mixture was added to

203

the untreated cells and were processed for binding assay. In both the experiments, following 1h of

204

spike S1-Fc incubation at 4°C, the cells were stained with Goat anti-human IgG conjugated with

205

FITC (1:300 dilution; A80-119F, Bethyl) subsequently counterstained with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich

206

Cat no D9542-10MG). Confocal images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 880 confocal laser-

207

scanning microscope with an objective at 63x oil. Imaging parameters were kept the same for

208

control versus treated samples. The images were processed using the Zeiss ZEN blue software.

209

Statistical analysis: Unpaired student's t-test was performed and only p values of 0.05 or lower

210

were considered statistically significant. For all statistical analyses, the GraphPad Prism 5 was

211

used.

212

Results

213

Emerging viruses are highly pathogenic and require sophisticated biocontainment facilities.

214

Research on these pathogenic viruses like SARS, MERS, or SARS-CoV-2 is challenging due to

215

the limited availability of BSL-3/BSL-4 laboratory facilities. Pseudotyped viruses are an

216

alternative that can mimic a live virus, but replication-deficient and can be used for research work

217

in the routine BSL-2 laboratory. For the generation of coronavirus pseudotypes, full-length spike

218

gene of SARS, MERS, and SARS-2 lacking the endoplasmic retention signal sequence were

219

amplified from cDNA (SARS and MERS) or the codon-optimized synthetic construct (SARS-

220

CoV-2) and amplicons were cloned into pCAGGS expression plasmid. The plasmid constructs

221

were confirmed by sequencing and restriction analysis and were transfected in HEK293T cells,

222

and protein expression was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining (data not shown). In order

223

to produce VSV∆G/GFP pseudotyped coronaviruses, cells were transiently expressed with the

224

respective plasmids encoding the spike glycoprotein of SARS, MERS, or SARS-CoV-2 in

225

HEK293T cells and VSV∆G/GFP pseudovirus was infected 24 hours post-transfection. Pseudo

226

typed coronaviruses were harvested from the precleared cell supernatant and titrated in Vero E6

227

or HuH 7 cells, and the GFP positive cells (Fig 1a) were counted and calculated the infection units

228

per milliliter (IU/ml) The titer of the SARSpv was 1.2x105 IU/ml, MERSpv 1.4x104 IU/ml and

229

VSVpv 1x106.4 IU/ml whereas SARS CoV -2 yielded a less titer 5x103 IU/ml (Fig. 1b). The

230

presence of intact CoVpv particles in the supernatant was analyzed independently by Transmission

231

electron microscopy (TEM). Intact bullet-shaped virus particles of 200 nm size were observed in

232

each grid (Fig. 1c).

233

Proper maturation of the VSV pseudotyped coronavirus particles are critical for cellular entry and

234

infection. Next, we checked whether the polyclonal antibodies raised against MERS or SARS

235

CoVs binds and neutralizes the pseudotyped CoVs. SARS-CoV specific polyclonal antibodies

236

neutralizes SARSpv and also cross neutralizes SARS-2pv but not MERSpv (Fig 2a) whereas,

237

MERS-CoV polyclonal specifically neutralizes MERSpv but not SARSpv or SARS-2pv (Fig. 2b),

238

suggesting that antibodies specifically bind on the receptor binding S1 domain of the CoVpvs and

239

neutralize the virus infection. It is well known that SARS and SARS-CoV-2 use human ACE2 as

240

the entry receptor to initiate an infection cycle [33]–[35]. To confirm that the CoVpv entry is

241

mediated by its specific receptor, we produced a recombinant soluble form of Angiotensin-

242

converting enzyme 2 (sACE2) in HEK293T cells and purified using Ni-NTA affinity column. A

243

90 kDa band was observed in SDS PAGE and was confirmed by western blotting using ACE2

244

specific antibody (Fig. 2c). Incubation of sACE2 with CoVpvs blocked the entry of SARSpv and

245

SARS-2pv but did not affect MERSpv infection (Fig 2d).

246

Further, to confirm the receptor-mediated entry of the pseudotyped coronaviruses, we cloned the

247

complete ACE2 or MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and was transiently

248

expressed on the non-susceptible BHK21 cells. The surface expression of ACE2 and DPP4 was

249

confirmed by immunostaining using ACE2 and DPP4 polyclonal antibodies (Fig 2e). Next, we

250

expressed the S1 domain of different spike proteins fused to the Fc domain of human IgG (S1-

251

hFc) in HEK293T cells, yielding recombinant proteins of approximately 140 kDa, which was

252

confirmed by western blotting (Fig 2c) and immunostaining (Supplementary Fig 1). Incubation of

253

recombinant SARS-, SARS-2 -S1-hFc fusion proteins enables binding on hACE2 whereas MERS-

254

S1-hFc bind on the hDPP4 transfected cells and no binding was observed in empty plasmid

255

transfected cells (Fig 2e). Subsequently, ACE2 transiently expressed on the surface of non-

256

susceptible BHK21 cells enable SARS- and SARS-2 pvs infection, whereas MERSpv or VSVpv

257

did not (Fig. 2f). Similarly, MERS CoVpv infection was observed in hDPP4 expressed BHK21

258

cells, whereas SARS-, SARS-2-, and VSV- pvs infections were similar to empty plasmid

259

transfected cells (Fig 2g). These data confirm that the developed pseudotyped CoVs use its specific

260

receptor to enter into the host cells.

261

Targeting viral entry through interaction with cell receptors is a preliminary goal for the

262

development of antivirals. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been previously reported

263

to have antiviral activity against a diverse range of viruses [9], [36]. Among these, several natural

264

compounds are known to inhibit viral entry by binding to the viral glycoprotein or host cell surface

265

receptor and block the interaction of the virus and its receptor, thereby preventing the entry into

266

the host cells. Spirulina and Green tea extracts have been reported to have the ability to inhibit the

267

viral entry of enveloped viruses, including HCV, Influenza, HIV, VSV, etc. [21], [23], [26], [27],

268

[37]. Here, we screened the antiviral activity of Spirulina and Green tea extracts against

269

pseudotyped coronaviruses. First, to know whether crude extracts inhibit CoVpvs, we treated Vero

270

E6 cells as well as pseudotyped viruses (SARSpv, SARS -2pv, and MERSpv), including a VSVpv

271

positive control with 0.2mg/ml of cold water extracts (CWE) of Spirulina and green tea.

272

Interestingly, a significant reduction in infection was observed in all pvs pretreated with the

273

extracts (Fig 3b, d) but not in any of the preincubated cells (Fig 3a, c). The results suggest that

274

CWE of Spirulina and Green tea inhibits pseudotyped coronavirus entry by attachment to

275

pseudovirus envelope protein rather than to the cell surface.

276

Next, to confirm that the observed inhibitory activity of the extracts was not due to proteolytic

277

cleavage of the spike glycoprotein, we incubated the spike S1-hFc protein with the extracts for 90

278

minutes and then the proteins were analyzed by western blotting. No protein degradation was

279

observed in any of the proteins in comparison to input (Supplementary 2). Next, we performed a

280

concentration-dependent inhibition assay for all pvs. We incubated pvs with varying

281

concentrations ranging from 0.1mg/ml -0.8mg/ml of Spirulina and green tea extracts. All three

282

CoVpvs were confirmed to be inhibited by CWE of Spirulina and Green tea with higher efficiency.

283

90% inhibition was observed in Spirulina treated SARSpv , SARS-2pv ,MERSpv and VSVpv

284

infection at 0.6mg/ml,0.5mg/ml,0.8mg/ml and 0.6 mg/ml respectively (Fig.4a)whereas green tea

285

treated pseudotyped viruses were inhibited at 0.1mgml, 0.12mg/ml, 0.1mg/ml and 0.25mg/ml

286

respectively (Fig.4b). Most importantly, Green tea CWE showed more inhibitory activity on

287

pseudotyped coronaviruses in comparison to Spirulina extract.

288

To understand whether the inhibitory mechanism of Spirulina and green tea extracts are mediated

289

through inhibition of the interaction of spike and its receptor, we performed an S1 binding assay

290

on HEK293T cells expressing either ACE2 or DPP4. Cells were preincubated with the extracts

291

followed by the addition of S1 spike proteins at 4ºC. Binding assay of spike (S1-hFc) proteins was

292

analyzed by immunostaining followed by confocal microscopy. Similarly, we incubated the spike

293

S1 proteins with the extracts and then the mixture was added on the ACE2 or DPP4 cells. Cells

294

treated with either of the extracts did not inhibit the interaction of S1 and its receptor ACE2 or

295

DPP4 (Fig.5a). In contrast, all three S1 proteins incubated with the extracts of green tea is unable

296

to bind to its receptor whereas Spirulina treated S1 proteins did not inhibit S1 -ACE2 or DPP4

297

interaction (Fig.5b) suggesting that the Spirulina extract blocks the viral entry through an unknown

298

mechanism. However, green tea extract binds to the S1 domain of the spike and prevents the spike

299

receptor interaction.

mechanism of antiviral action.

Further studies with live viruses are required to elucidate the exact

302

Discussion

303

The recent emergence of coronaviruses has caused serious global threats initiating diverse

304

approaches for biocontainment of these pathogens. Most of these emerging viruses are highly

305

pathogenic with limited therapeutic strategies and require BSL3/BSL4 facilities to handle these

306

pathogens. The ongoing pandemic of SARS CoV-2 which has spread across the world, is a notable

307

example that elucidates the need of diagnostics and robotic screening systems for identification of

308

antiviral compounds. However, the limited high-level biosafety equipped laboratories particularly

309

in developing countries inculcate the need for adapting to alternative approaches which can lead

310

to the handling of the viruses in a BSL2 facility. Here we report the production of VSV

311

pseudotyped virus particles for SARS CoV-2, SARS CoV, and MERS CoV. The developed

312

pseudoviruses were susceptible for infection in Vero E6 cells and other cells. We obtained a high

313

titer for SARS and MERS CoVpv whereas SARS CoV-2pv had a less titer which could be due to

314

less packaging efficiency in HEK293T cells which was consistent with the previous report [31].

315

Pseudovirus production in Vero E6 cells [31] and expression of TMPRSS2 might enhance

316

pseudovirus production and infection [33]. The developed pseudotyped viruses could be efficiently

317

neutralized by specific polyclonal antibodies. SARS specific polyclonal neutralizes SARSpv and

318

SARS-2pv as shown elsewhere [35] whereas MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralized MERSpv

319

[36]. Therefore, pvs are useful tools for studying virus neutralization assay for highly pathogenic

320

viruses in BSL2 facility [9]. Next, we showed that pseudoviruses specifically bind its receptor and

321

enter into host cells. Previous studies report that pvs can be used to understand the entry of

322

pathogenic

viruses

including

coronaviruses

[33].

323
324

The inhibition of viral entry is a key target for the development of antivirals. Medicinal plants and

325

natural compounds have been reported to have a wide range of antiviral activities. Among these,

326

Spirulina and Green tea extracts have been reported to inhibit attachment of enveloped viruses

327

such as HCV, HIV, and Influenza virus [19], [21]. In our first study, we show that VSV is inhibited

328

by the cold-water extract of Spirulina and Green tea. In the case of green tea consistent with

329

previous studies, VSV entry is inhibited whereas cold water extracted Spirulina could inhibit the

330

entry of VSV. However, hot water extract of Spirulina could not inhibit VSV entry [38] which

331

might be due to the degradation of the major active compounds of Spirulina. but not hot water

332

extract. Next, we tested the antiviral activity of Spirulina and Green tea cold water extract on

333

pseudotyped coronaviruses. Treatment of cells with the extract did not inhibit viral entry whereas

334

preincubation of pseudoviruses with the extracts inhibited viral entry on Vero E6 cells suggesting

335

that the active compounds from Spirulina and green tea binds on the virus glycoprotein and block

336

the virus entry. To further understand the exact inhibitory mechanism, we performed an S1 binding

337

assay on DPP4 or ACE2 expressing cells using a mixture of S1 proteins preincubated with the

338

Spirulina and green tea extracts. Interestingly, all three S1 proteins treated with green tea abrogate

339

the interaction of spike with its receptor whereas Spirulina treated S1 proteins could bind to its

340

cellular receptor. The observed results suggest that green tea binds to the spike S1 domain and

341

inhibits the viral entry. However, we speculate that EGCG, EGC, ECG, or EC, the most active

342

components in Green tea might be inhibiting the coronaviral entry not only binding exclusively to

343

S1 but also other domains of the viral envelope glycoprotein. These compounds are reported to

344

have antiviral entry inhibitory activity against different viruses [19]. On the other hand, the exact

345

mechanism of action of Spirulina extract is not understood. The major components in Spirulina

346

extract, sulfated polysaccharides and Spirulan like substances, might bind to enveloped

347

glycoproteins of CoVs and play a role in the inhibition of coronavirus entry. Further research

348

using the active compounds and live viruses is essential to understand the mechanism of action of

349

these extracts. In summary, we have successfully developed pseudotyped viruses for SARS-

350

SARS-2 and MERS CoV and demonstrated their applications including pseudovirus

351

neutralization, virus entry and most importantly, screening for identification of antiviral

352

compounds against viral entry. Moreover, natural products could be promising antiviral agents

353

for emerging viruses.

Maturation of the developed pseudoviruses were assessed neutralization assay with a) SARS CoV

589

polyclonal antibody. Significant reduction in infection was observed in SARS and SARS -2pv b)

590

MERS CoV polyclonal antibodies and significant reduction was observed only in MERSpv but

591

not in others. c) 6X HIS- tagged recombinant sACE2 was expressed in Hek293T cells and was

592

purified by Ni-NTA based IMAC purification. The purified protein was confirmed by western

593

blotting using anti-ACE2 antibodies to detect a band of ≈90KDa. Similarly, SARS-, SARS-2- and

594

MERS -CoV spike S1 fused with Human Fc, the recombinant protein was produced and purified

595

with protein A sepharose beads. Approximately, 140kDa protein was purified and was confirmed

596

by western blotting using Goat anti human IgG HRP conjugated antibody. d) In order to validate

597

the specific interaction of the pseudotyped particles on mammalian cells, soluble ACE2 (sACE2)

598

was incubated with pvs followed by pv infection on Vero E6 cells. e) Surface expression of either

599

ACE2 or DPP4 on BHK21 cells were analyzed by immunostaining using Goat anti-ACE2 or goat

600

Anti-DPP4 antibody. Non permissive BHK21 cells were transiently expressed with f) ACE2 or g)

601

DPP4 followed by pvs infection. SARSpv and SARS-2pv were susceptible in ACE2 expressed

602

cells and MERSpv was susceptible in DPP4 expressed cells. Data shown is relative normalized
