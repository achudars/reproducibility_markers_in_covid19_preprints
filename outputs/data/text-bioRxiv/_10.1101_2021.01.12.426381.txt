Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) hospitalizations and deaths disportionally
affect males and the elderly. Here we investigated the impact of male sex and age by infecting adult male, aged
male, and adult female ferrets with SARS-CoV-2. Aged male ferrets had a decrease in temperature which was
accompanied by prolonged viral replication with increased pathology in the upper respiratory tract after
infection. Transcriptome analysis of the nasal turbinates and lungs indicated that female ferrets had significant
increases in interferon response genes (OASL, MX1, ISG15, etc.) on day 2 post infection which was delayed in
aged males. In addition, genes associated with taste and smell such as RTP1, CHGA, and CHGA1 at later time
points were upregulated in males but not in females. These results provide insight into COVID-19 and suggests
that older males may play a role in viral transmission due to decreased antiviral responses.

Introduction
In December 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which has led to a global pandemic 1. SARS-CoV-2, identified
as the causative agent of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019), is a beta-coronavirus belonging
to the Coronaviridae family of enveloped positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with
significant similarities to SARS-CoV which emerged in 2002 2,3. Infection in humans with SARSCoV-2 can lead to severe disease, hospitalization, and death in some cases while others may remain
subclinical or develop only mild disease; therefore, the clinical picture of COVID-19 is
significantly varied and disease can range from mild nasal congestion and sore throat to severe
pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage leading to multi-organ failure and death

4-6

. Non-

respiratory symptoms such as loss of taste and smell, the development of microblood clots
(COVID-toes), strokes, neurological impairment, and long-term complications (COVID longhaulers) have also been reported or associated with infection 7,8. These symptoms are indicative of

direct or indirect effects of the virus on major organ systems such as the neurosensory system and
the cardiovascular system. As of November 18, 2020, there have been more than 56 million
confirmed cases and over 1.3 million deaths world-wide 9, highlighting the urgent need for
vaccines, antivirals, and a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease
progression and viral transmission.

Epidemiological analysis across several countries has indicated that there are several host factors
including sex, age, and co-morbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes,
hypertension, and cancer) that can increase COVID-19 severity. Demographic analysis across
several countries including China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, and the US have inidicated that
men have increased severe disease and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to
women

10,11

. Age also has a clear impact on COVID-19 where case fatality rates (CFR)

significantly increases with age 4,11. Indeed, the CFR for COVID-19 in individuals < 40 years of
age is less than 0.2% whereas those aged between 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ have CFRs of 3.6%,
8.0%, and +14%, respectively 11,12. Thus people >65 years of age are considered the highest risk
group for developing severe illness by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
13

. In the US alone, 80% of COVID-19-related fatalities have occurred in patients >65 years of

age 4 and long-term care facilities have been demonstrated to be particularly vulnerable to COVID19

14-16

. Clinical identification of COVID-19 in the elderly is also constrained by differences in

disease symptoms including tachypnea, unexplained tachycardia and increased blood pressure,
altered mental status, muscle pain, and fatigue

14,17

. Understanding COVID-19 disease

mechanisms in higher-risk groups, including males and the elderly, remains a significant public

health priority and will inform supportive care and treatment modalities as well as vaccine
strategies for high-risk groups.
Preclinical models are essential for advancing countermeasures for infectious diseases into
human clinical trials. Animal models are indispensable for responses to newly emerging infectious
diseases given their importance for preclinical evaluations of vaccines and therapeutics and
corresponding insights into disease pathophysiology18. However, development of these models
requires identification of species that are susceptible to infection as well as recapitulation of human
clinical disease. While mice have been traditionally employed in preclinical investigations due to
reagent availability and cost, they are not typically susceptible to human clinical viral isolates
without adaptation. In contrast, ferrets are commonly susceptible to human viruses, including
ebolaviruses, influenza viruses and coronaviruses, and have been used for virus characterization
and vaccine testing

18-20

. Additionally, the respiratory tract of ferrets has human-like physiology

including similarities in the numbers of terminal branches in the lower respiratory tract,
distribution of cellular receptors for viruses, and body:lung surface area ratio 21. Ferrets display
similar symptoms and clinical features to humans during respiratory infections, including fever,
nasal discharge, coughing, and weight loss

19,22-25

. They have also been used to investigate age-

related host responses, disease severity, and pathogenic immune mechanisms during respiratory
virus infection

23,24

. Further, the utility of ferrets for infection studies has been demonstrated in

SARS-CoV investigations for vaccine development and innate immune responses, including
interferon stimulated genes 19,22,26-31.

The emergence and rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has required an unparalleled
search for animal models that meet the criteria needed for timely preclinical characterization of

viral pathogenesis and therapeutics identification

32

. Currently, ferrets, domesticated cats, non-

human primates, and Syrian hamsters have been shown to be susceptible to infection and support
viral replication

33-38

. Although not naturally susceptible, genetically modified mice as well as

mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 viruses in wild type mice have also been used for SARS-CoV-2
preclinical modeling

39-41

. Ferret infection studies have shown that the virus can be readily

transmitted between animals by contact as well as aerosol transmission 34,42. Ferrets are sexually
dimorphic animals that display sex-biased health conditions suggesting their utility for COVID19 sex biases

21

. Moreover, age-related viral disease severity has been shown in ferrets by our

group and others 23,24,43-46. As COVID-19 severity has been associated with the male sex and age,
we investigated these biological variables and their contribution to disease in ferrets by identifying
the molecular mechanisms underlying these contributions. We characterized sex- and age-related
viral load and shedding as well as immune gene expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected ferrets. Taken
together, our data demonstrated that older males had a longer duration of viral shedding from the
upper respiratory tract with a delayed induction of antiviral and interferon stimulated genes
compared to younger females and males. These findings may suggest that antiviral treatment may
be more beneficial to male patients. In addition, our findings highlight that not only sociological
and societal factors, but also biological factors including sex hormones, sex chromosomes, and
aging, contribute to COVID-19 sex-biases.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypothermia in male ferrets but fever in females.
Significant sex and age biases have been observed for severe COVID-19 47-50. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms contributing to these biases is essential for therapeutic development and

preventative measures which will provide a greater protection for vulnerable populations such as
the elderly and males. Ferrets are often used as a preclinical model for dissecting the molecular
mechanisms of human viral diseases including those with sex and age biases

43,51

. Here, we

employed ferrets to gain a better understanding of human SARS-CoV-2 infection and the increased
risk of severe COVID-19 in aged males. Ferrets are typically purchased for scientific studies after
they have been fixed (i.e., spayed or neutered). To address our questions surrounding the roles of
sex and age in severe COVID-19 disease, we acquired intact female and male (adult and aged)
ferrets from Triple F farms for our studies. Three experimental groups were employed to assess
the roles of sex and age: group 1 – adult female ferrets (1 year of age); group 2 – adult male ferrets
(1 year of age); and group 3 – aged male ferrets (over 2 years of age). All three groups were
intranasally inoculated with 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 while anesthetized. Clinical responses
such as weight loss, temperature, activity, and other signs of neurological and gastrointestinal
disease were monitored for 14 - 21 days post inoculation (pi). In-life nasal washes, blood samples
and tissues were collected on day 2, 5, 7, 14, and 21 pi to analyse host responses and viral burden
among the groups.

Ferrets display human-like clinical symptoms after viral infection 52. Weight and temperature were
monitored after inoculation for 14 days (Fig. 1). Minimal clinical changes in weight were observed
for all groups throughout the time course. All groups remained close to their original weight
(100%) and no statistical differences were noted (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, significant variability
was observed for temperature between group comparisons. Female ferrets experienced significant
biphasic temperature increases after inoculation compared to their baseline values. On day 1 pi,
female temperature increased to 101% of original temperature that was sustained until day 4. The

temperature of female ferrets then again increased on day 9 when temperature was recorded at
102% of original readings. Although this temperature increase was mild in the females, it differed
significantly from both male ferret groups. The male ferrets experienced a temperature decrease
after inoculation (98-99% of original temperature). Aged male ferrets (represented by the grey line
on the graph) had lower temperatures than the adult males for longer durations. Aged males
exhibited a biphasic trend of initial decrease days 1-3 pi and a second decrease from days 9-12
with significantly lower temperatures than female temperatures on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, and
12 (Fig. 1B). No statistical differences were noted between the adult males and aged males
although adult males had fewer statistically hypothermic days compared to females. Together, this
data suggests a sex effect on temperature change exacerbated by increases in age following SARSCoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasal turbinates is more severe and longer lasting in aged male
ferrets.
Infectious viral loads in COVID-19 patients have been correlated with increased disease sequelae
and mortality

53

. It has been shown that males and seniors have increased SARS-CoV-2 viral

burden compared to younger females 54,55. Although these reports suggest males have higher viral
burden, modeling viral dynamics in human cohorts is difficult due to the requirement for frequent
sample acquisition to obtain an accurate picture of viral kinetics, including duration and the peak
of replication. Therefore, we assessed the viral burden in the upper respiratory tract nasal washes
to determine the temporal dynamics of viral load and shedding. We collected nasal wash samples
as described and assessed viral shedding by both vRNA by qRT-PCR and infectious virus by
TCID50 assays. Marked differences were observed among the groups. Infectious virus was present

in the nasal washes of female ferrets on day 2 pi though vRNA persisted until day 7 pi (Fig. 2A).
The vRNA values of female nasal washes ranged from 3-4 TCID50/mL (Log10) which was
significantly lower compared to those of adult males and aged males that had maximum vRNA >7
TCID50/mL (Log10) at their respective apex. Conversely, adult males and aged males shed
infectious virus until days 5 and 7, respectively. Nasal turbinates were then assessed as a possible
virus source (Fig. 2B). vRNA and infectious virus were found in the nasal turbinates of female
ferrets on day 2 pi alone, similar to titers seen in the adult and aged males. Although females were
only positive on day 2 pi, adult and aged males were positive for virus at later time points. By day
7, adult males were positive for vRNA alone, whereas the aged males were positive for both vRNA
and infectious virus in the nasal tissues. To determine if the antibody response was differentially
affected by sex and age, we conducted microneutralization assays. Plasma collected from adult
females (day 14 and 21 pi), adult males (day 14 pi only), aged males (day 14 and 21 pi) were
evaluated. No differences were noted among the experimental groups. Ferrets were able to elicit
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies to average titres between 1:20 to 1:40 by day 14. All animals
had detectable neutralizing antibodies except for one aged male (day 14) and one adult female (day
21) (Fig. 2C).

We assessed vRNA and infectious virus presence in tissues outside of the upper respiratory tract
to determine if virus tropism was expanded outside the upper respiratory tract. Following infection,
we collected the salivary glands, trachea, lung lobes (right cranial, right middle, right caudal, left
cranial, left caudal, and accessory lobes), mediastinal lymph nodes, heart, kidney, liver, spleen,
and large intestine (colon) from all three experimental groups on days 2, 7, and 14 pi. Viral
presence by qRT-PCR showed adult females were positive for vRNA in the trachea, accessory

lobe, and the colon on day 2 pi, whereas vRNA was found only in the colon (Large Intestine (LI))
of the adult males (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast, vRNA was positive in all lung lobes as
well as the LI in aged males (Supplementary Figure 1, bottom left panel). By day 7 pi, adult male
and female animals had additional vRNA positive tissues; the number of vRNA positive tissues
decreased at this time point in the aged males. All tissues were negative across all groups on days
14 and 21 (results not shown). All tissues positive for vRNA were then assessed for the presence
of live virus by TCID50 titration assay. Although several tissues were positive for high quantities
of vRNA, no tissues were positive for live virus. Taken together, these results show that males
have a longer duration of viral replication and shedding from the upper respiratory tract, possibly
affecting the lung lobes as well, which was also associated with age. These results suggest that
females are more effective at limiting viral loads and replication over time.

Due to the differences we observed across the ferret groups in both vRNA and infections in the
upper respiratory tract, we assessed infection-mediated pathology within nasal turbinate tissues
(Fig. 3). Nasal turbinates were collected at necropsy from SARS-CoV-2-infected animals and were
formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded, and H&E prepped (Fig. 3) or stained for viral antigen by IHC
(Fig. 4). Tissues were visualized and images captured with the Leica DMI100 Brightfield
microscope and camera. Nasal turbinates from non-infected animals showed ciliated epithelial
cells with minimal infiltration of immune cells or evidence of tissue erosion (Fig. 3A). Moreover,
control tissues from uninfected animals were negative for viral antigen staining (Fig. 4A).

Turbinates from adult female ferrets had minimal immune cell infiltration and tissue architecture

cilia loss. Mononuclear cell infiltration was first detected on day 7 and was most pronounced on
day 14 pi as indicated by the asterisk in the females. Rhinitis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and
loss of ciliated cell layers are evident at this time. Granulocytes can also be seen from days 7-14
pi. Adult females had minimal viral antigen staining in the pseudostratified columnar epithelium
which was only observed on day 2 pi (Fig. 4B, left lower panel, indicated by green arrows).

Adult male ferrets had increased ciliated epithelial cell loss starting on day 2 pi (indicated by red
arrows) compared to females (Fig. 3C). Cavity formation was first noted on day 7 (black arow)
with concomitant edema and presence of immune exudate, monocytic cell infiltrate, disruption of
cilia and cavitation, and heavy sloughing. Significant mononuclear cell infiltration, as well as signs
of necrosis, was evident by day 14 pi as indicated by the asterisk (Fig. 3C, far right panels). Adult
males had a high concentration of positively stained cells in the outer layer of the nasal olfactory
epithelium on day 2 (Fig. 4B, middle panels, indicated by red arrows) which diminished by day 7
(Fig. 4C, green arrows).

Nasal turbinates from aged males had the most significant epithelial destruction and immune cell
infiltration in all groups (Fig. 3D). Evidence for mononuclear cell infiltration was identified as
early as day 2 pi (asterisk) and remained visible throughout the time course. Significant loss of
ciliated cells was observed on day 2 pi (black line) with signs of erosion in the surface of the
epithelial cells (red arrow), as well as cavity formation (black arrow), necrosis, and immune
infiltration. Erosion could be seen on days 2 and 7 pi whereas cavity formation in the submucosa
was evident on days 7 and 14. Exocytosis of mononuclear cells was consistently observed post
infection. Orange arrows point to epithelial cell sloughing. Aged males also had high amounts of

viral antigen in the nasal olfactory epithelium, but the staining was not limited to the outer layer
(Fig. 4B, lower right panel, indicated by red arrow). Staining throughout the nasal olfactory
epithelium was seen in aged males on day 7, which again reached the basement membrane (Fig.
4C, lower right panel, red arrow).

Together, all infected ferret groups showed damage to the nasal turbinates over the course of
infection with evidence of viral antigen within the tissue. Adult males and aged males had early
signs of mononuclear cell infiltration and cavity formation with damage to the tissue throughout
the time course. Tissue analysis of viral antigen revealed more extensive, and a longer duration of,
antigen in the aged males which was consistent with our viral load findings.

Antiviral and Interferon Stimulated Gene upregulation in the nasal turbinates positive for SARSCoV-2 were delayed in aged male ferrets but neurosensory and inflammatory signalling genes
were increased at later time points.
To identify candidate mechanisms underlying prolonged viral replication in SARS-CoV-2infected aged male ferrets, we performed unbiassed, whole transcriptome transcriptome analysis.
RNA was isolated from upper (nasal turbinates) and lower (right cranial and caudal lung lobes)
respiratory tracts of control animals, infected adult female ferrets and aged male ferrets at days 2,
7, 14, and 21 following inoculation. Gene enrichment analysis plots, leveraging the Hallmark
Signalling Pathway collection56,57 indicated significant differences in the longitudinal profiles of
several prominent signalling pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infected adult females and aged
males (Fig. 5). Immune-relevant signalling pathways that were significantly regulated for at least
one time point compared to baseline for adult females or aged males included interferon-alpha,

interferon-gamma, unfolded protein response, MTORC, MYC targets V2, DNA repair, PI3K AKT
MTOR signalling, reactive oxigen species, IL2 STAT5 signalling, allograft rejection, apoptosis,
inflammatory response, peroxisome, oxidative phosphorylation, IL6 JAK STAT3 signalling, and
complement. Adult female and aged male ferrets had obvious differences in the longitudinal trends
of several of these signalling pathways. Most noted were the early increase in interferon-alpha
(IFN-a) and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) for the adult females on day 2 pi (Fig. 5A) whereas the
aged males had no expression of interferons on day 2 which peaked later on day 7 pi (Fig. 5B).
Also of note were the decreasing trends of inflammatory response associated pathways in the adult
females on day 21 of reactive oxygen species, IL2 STAT5 signalling, complement, inflammatory
responses, allograft rejection, and apoptosis. Conversely, aged males had statistical increases in
pathways involved with inflammatory responses including oxdative phosphorylation, fatty acid
metabolism, peroxisome, reactive oxygen species, MTORC and unfolded protein response. Once
we had gained a perspective of the overall pathway level changes over time, we looked more
closely at the top 50 DEGs by p-value (all p<0.05) in isolation by day post-infection to identify
the individual genes represented in each pathway (Fig. 6). Interferon response and antiviral
response genes most highly expressed in the female day 2 nasal turbinates included OASL, MX1,
DHX58, RSAD2, ISG15, and CTSG. By day 7 pi, aged male ferrets had a shift in gene profiles
with significant increases in CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, OASL, RSAD2, IRF7, ISG15, ISG20,
CAMP, and CTSG. Similar trends were also seen in analysis of the right cranial (Supplementary
Figure 2) and right caudal (Supplementary Figure 3) lung lobes. Specifically, IFNG, IFI6, IRF7,
DHX58, RSAD2, IFIT1, CMPK2, MX1, and USP18 were highly upregulated in the right cranial
lung lobes of the females but not in males on day 2 pi. This was consistently observed in the right
caudal tissue of females as well (RNF7, DHX58, IFI6, RSAD2, IFIT1, IFIT3, ISG15, and MX1).

Select genes validated by qRT-PCR confirmed the trend of delayed interferon responses in aged
males compared to adult females for both the upper and lower respiratory tract (Supplementary
Figure 4). In addition, adult males were also investigated for regulation of interferon responses by
qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 4). This analysis showed adult males have a unique signature
of host responses (interferon and inflammatory gene expression) following SARS-CoV-2
infection. Specifically, IFN-a and IFN-g were regulated to similar expression levels as adult
female ferrets but inflammatory genes such as IL-6 were regulated at intermediate levels. Taken
together, these results suggest that together age and sex in males may bias the IFN responses to be
delayed during SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract.

To further elucidate specific genes involved in the regulation of overrepresented pathways in nasal
turbinate samples at the later time points, we examined specific genes regulated in the top 50 DEGs
of nasal turbinate samples from days 14 and 21 pi. Interestingly, genes associated with
neurological signalling and the olfactory response were overrepresented in the aged male ferrets
on day 14 pi (Fig. 6). Twenty of the top 50 DEGs were associated with these pathways and included
GNG13, SLC17A6, FSTL5, BPIFB6, MYT1L, FLRT1, BRINP2, RTP1, STMN4, DSCAM,
CHGA, DYRK4, PCDHB1, SYT4, SYT1, CNGA2, ACSL6, STOML3, CARNS1, CPLX2,
CNGA4, SLC22A20, and KCNMB3. Of note, GNG13 (taste recognition), SLC22A20 (odorant
transporter), RTP1 (olfactory receptor binding), CNGA2 (associated with anosmia), and CNGA4
(transduction of odorant signals) have all been implicated in the olfactory responses. On day 21,
neurological signalling-associated genes were still present, but expression profiles varied and were
not sex specific. These results suggest that there is a sex- and age-biased recovery following SARSCoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract that may affect sensory perception.

Discussion
Here we investigated the influence of age and sex on clinical outcomes and host responses after
SARS-CoV-2 infection using the ferret model. Importantly, by using ferrets with intact sex organs,
we showed that aged male ferrets had lower temperature compared to baseline and had prolonged
SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding after inoculation. Host transcriptome analysis suggested that aged
males had delayed expression of antiviral genes such as MX1, IRF7, and ISG15 compared to adult
females, which may have been responsible for the sex-dependent delay in viral clearance. Aged
male ferrets also had increased expression of genes associated with odor detection at later time
points, possibly indicative of key drivers of COVID-19 anosmia. COVID-19 caused by SARSCoV-2 has significantly impacted both the male sex and older individuals. Our findings may
inform human studies and suggest investigation of the interrelationship of viral shedding,
interferon signalling, and olfactory responses in COVID-19 patients which may be biased in males
and the elderly. The identification of prolonged viral shedding in older males may have
implications in public health responses and the analysis of transmission events.

To study the contribution of sex and age to the development of severe COVID-19, we were able
to parse the variables of age and sex to stratify clinical, virological, and immune outcomes post
SARS-CoV-2 infection by utilizing ferrets with intact sex organs. Based on human clinical and
epidemiological findings disaggregated by sex and age, we hypothesized that older male ferrets
would develop severe disease post SARS-CoV-2 infection 48-50,58. Since older males are at higher
risk of hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we anticipated the establishment of
a preclinical model with a severe COVID-19 phenotype that could be employed for vaccine and

therapeutic development. In contrast, we found that none of our older or sex organ intact ferrets
developed significant weight loss after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but temperature was significantly
affected. We found that females developed a sustained mild fever similar to that reported for ferrets
(possibly spayed and neutered) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in other studies

59

. Conversely, all

males in our study experienced a significant decrease in temperature with older males having
statistically lower temperature than females compared to the younger males. Interestingly,
temperature has been shown to be dysregulated in older patients infected with other respiratory
viruses. As older patients do not consistently develop conventional temperature increases during
infection of viruses such as influenza virus, elderly diagnoses have been missed, which eventually
affects patient treatment and outcome 60. Our results suggest older male COVID-19 patients may
also fail to be identified in early stages because of atypical clinical pictures. Currently, there are
limited clinical definitions of COVID-19 per age group and sex. Defining the clinical picture for
specific cohorts will be essential for proper diagnosis, treatment plans, and patient outcome.

Although SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate globally, little is understood regarding host-specific
viral dynamics and transmission. In our preclinical study, we found that there was a sex and age
influence on SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. Male ferrets shed live SARS-CoV-2 virus
longer than females and shedding virus from males increased by age. Interestingly, analysis of
vRNA and live virus in the nasal turbinates day 2 pi did not indicate a quantitative difference of
viral burden by sex or age, indicating that females and males were equally susceptible to infection
and viral replication. Therefore, the differences that were observed among the groups in respect to
virus durability and prolonged shedding conversely suggested there was a sex and age bias in the
ability to control viral infection over time. The viral loads we detected in aged male ferrets were

similar to those reported by other SARS-CoV-2 ferret studies (viral clearance ~ day 8 pi), leaving
the possibility that the presence of female sex hormones or sex organs in our sexually intact female
ferrets influenced the efficiency of viral clearance 34. In respect to human COVID-19, our results
seemed to recapitulate human SARS-CoV-2 viral load demographics where older people as well
as males have been tested to be SARS-CoV-2 positive for longer periods of time

54,55

. Mouse

models of SARS-CoV-1 as well as SARS-CoV-2 also indicated that viral burden in the respiratory
tract of males and older animals is also significantly increased 40,61,62 suggesting similar influence
of age and sex for SARS-like coronaviruses. In contrast to these findings, a preclinical study
investigating the effect of age on SARS-CoV-2 morbidity using the Syrian hamster model found
no difference in viral shedding of older and younger animals

63

. This report may indicate that

although the Syrian hamster model recapitulates lung disease associated with human COVID-1938,
ferrets and mice may be a superior model for age-based studies.

We found an association between altered immune responses with prolonged viral load in aged
males. The human COVID-19 demographics clearly indicate that older males are at higher risk of
severe COVID-19 but this data does not give insight into the factors influencing disease. In respect
to sex biases, biological and behavioural factors may both influence disease demographics 64. Our
results leveraging a controlled preclinical animal model that removed behavioural factors
suggested that biological sex strongly affected the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently,
humoral responses as well as interferon signalling have been implicated in the sex biases of viral
infection. Data from severe COVID-19 patients indicated that males and the elderly had increased
neutralizing antibodies toward SARS-CoV-2, possibly suggesting a pathogenic humoral
involvement or mechanism affecting antibody production during infection 50. Several other human

and animal studies have reported that perturbed interferon responses are associated with SARSCoV-2 infection, suggesting that dysregulated interferon signalling is a common mechanism
driving disease

58,65 66

. Although we did not find statistical differences in neutralizing antibody

titers between males and females or by age, we did observe a significant delay in interferon
responses in aged male ferrets. Specifically, adult female ferrets had earlier antiviral responses
characterized by increases in OASL, MIX1, DHX58, RSAD2, ISG15, and CTSG, which would be
essential for viral clearance. These genes were absent in the aged males at day 2 pi. In agreement
with our findings, one study has shown that male COVID-19 patients had a skewed interferon
response 58. This report by Bastard and colleagues showed a significant number of autoantibodies
elicited toward type I interferons, possibly leading to interferon dysregulation. Previous studies
have also suggested a role for Toll-like Receptor 7 (TLR7) in sex-biased interferon signalling
during viral infections 58. TLR7, a viral nucleic acid pathogen recognition receptor, is located on
a region of the X chromosome which is known to have a lower level of chromosomal inactivation,
allowing females to have stronger interferon responses during viral infection due to gene dosing
49,67-69

. Our data suggested that male ferrets had an atypical response to SARS-CoV-2 which was

clinically characterized by a period of hypothermia and molecularly characterized with delayed
interferon gene upregulation. Taken together, these reports may represent mechanisms
contributing to the prolonged viral presence and subsequent dysregulated interferon responses we
found in the upper respiratory tract of older males. Future studies should explore the sex-specific
regulation of interferon responses with regard to the involvement of type I interferon-specific
antibodies or TLR7 signalling in viral replication and clinical morbidity 58,68,70.

Anosmia, or loss of smell, has been reported as one of the more common symptoms of COVID19

71,72

. Studies have found that between 33.9% and 68% of COVID-19 patients experienced

symptoms associated with loss of smell

71-73

. Sex biases have also been reported for COVID-19

associated anosmia with as many as 72% of COVID-19 anosmia patients being women

72,73

.

Considering that males are disproportionately affected with severe COVID-19 after SARS-CoV2, it is intriguing that women have increased representation of anosmia. Interestingly, our gene
expression analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasal turbinates indicated that males had significant
increases in genes associated with smell and sensory perception following virus resolution which
were not present in female profiles. Since we did not measure olfactory responses in the infected
ferrets, we are unable to conclude if loss of smell occurred and if there was an associated sex bias.
Although measurement of smell was outside the scope of our study, our transcriptome analysis
suggested that odorant responses were affected post SARS-CoV-2 infection and in a sex-biased
manner. Specifically, the genes GNG13 (taste recognition), SLC22A20 (odorant transporter),
RTP1 (olfactory receptor binding), CNGA2 (associated with anosmia), and CNGA4 (transduction
of odorant signals) were differentially regulated in males. As males have a lower incidence in
anosmia, it is possible that these genes are associated with smell retention during infection, but
this hypothesis should be investigated further. Little is understood regarding the molecular aspects
of olfactory dysfunction and in particular the cause of COVID-19 related anosmia but these
profiles may give insight into anosmia regulation or protection.
Our study was limited by lack of an aged female ferret group, due to lack of a supply of these
animals early in the pandemic. Therefore, our conclusions focus on the suggestion that early
antiviral intervention may be more beneficial for males compared to females infected with SARSCoV-2.

Moreover, aged male ferrets had higher viral load that persisted longer in their upper

respiratory tracts and that in turn was associated with uniquely delayed antiviral gene expression .
While further research is needed to confirm the target genes we have identified, our study
represents a unique transcriptomic resource and established animal model for futher research.

There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 and how host
specific factors play a role in disease progression and outcome. Here we found that aged male
ferrets had higher viral load that persisted longer in their upper respiratory tracts, which was
associated with delayed antiviral gene expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that early
antiviral intervention may be more beneficial for males compared to females infected with SARSCoV-2. Further sex-aggregated analysis of antiviral use in clinical studies may be beneficial to
understanding the outcome of antiviral treatment during COVID-19 for compounds such as
remdesivir. More work is needed to expand on these conclusions and identify whether these
mechanisms are also at play in humans and if older males may be a source of super spreader events
due to prolonged viral shedding.

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate /Canada/ON/VIDO-01-2020 used for infections and in vitro assays was
isolated from a patient presenting at a Toronto hospital upon returning from Wuhan, China 74. The
viral stock grown in vDMEM (DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) (Wisent Bioproducts
(Cat # 319-005-CL)), 2% fetal calf serum (Wisent Bioproducts (Cat # 090-150)), 5 mL 100x
Penicillin (10,000 U/mL)/Streptomycin (10,000 µg/mL), and 2 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin) was from
the second passage (GISAID – EPI_ISL_425177). All work with SARS-CoV-2 live virus was
performed in a CL3 facility at VIDO-InterVac (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada).

Animals, Infections, and Tissue Collection
Adult female (1 year), adult male (1 year) and aged male (2 years) ferrets with intact sex organs
were purchased from Triple F Farms (Gillett, PA, USA). Ferrets were anesthetized for intranasal
SARS-CoV-2 at 106 TCID50 infections. On day 2, 7, 14, and 21 post infection, ferrets were
terminally bled by intra-cardiac puncture and humanely euthanized. Following infection, weight,
temperature, and clinical signs were monitored for 14-21 days. Weight and temperature were
calculated as a percentage of original weights.

Viral Titers
Nasal washes (1 ml) were collected post infection in anesthetized ferrets. Tissues collected at
necropsy were homogenized in serum free DMEM using a Qiagen TissueLyzer. A 1:10 dilution
series of sample was established in viral growth media (vDMEM) for TCID50 virus infection
titration assays. Viral load was calculated by determining the 50% endpoint using the ReedMuench method after observing cytopathic effect (CPE) on day 5 after cell inoculation.

Viral Neutralization Assay
Plasma was heat-inactivated at 56oC for 30 m and then serially diluted 1:2. Virus was diluted to
100 TCID50 in vDMEM and used at a 1:1 ratio to plasma, incubated at 37oC for 1 h and added to
cultured Vero-76 cells in 96 well plates for 1 h at 37oC. Inhibition of CPE was observed and
recorded on day 5 post infection.

RNA extraction and quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Tissue RNA was extracted using the Qiagen© RNeasy Mini kit cat. # 74106 (Qiagen, Toronto,
Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. vRNA was extracted from nasal washes
using the Qiagen© QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit cat. # 52904 (Qiagen). All host qRT-PCR was
performed in triplicate on cDNA synthesized as previously described

44

(Table 1). vRNA was

quantified by Qiagen© Quanti-fast RT probe master mix (Qiagen, Toronto, Canada) using
primer/probe sets specific for the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. The reactions were performed on a
StepOnePlusTM Real-Time PCR System in a 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher) as previously described

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
The tissues collected for histopathology were submersed in formalin for +1 week. Formalin-fixed
tissues were paraffin-embedded, sectioned, slide-mounted, and stained at Prairie Diagnostic
Services (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan). Tissue samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or
immunostained to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen using VIDO-InterVac’s polyclonal rabbit antiSARS-CoV-2 AS20-014 (1:400 dilution) and detected using an HRP-labelled polymer detection

RNAseq
RNA was assessed with a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent) using the Standard Sensitivity RNA kit.
Total RNA was normalized to 100 ng prior to random hexamer priming and libraries generated
using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA – Globin kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Libraries were
assessed on the Fragment Analyzer using the High Sense Large Fragment kit and quantified using
a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies). Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000
(Thermo Fisher) using a 50 base-pair, paired-end run for a minimum of 30 million reads per
sample.

RNAseq Analysis
Raw demultiplexed fastq paired end read files were trimmed of adapters and filtered using the
program skewer76 to remove any with an average phred quality score of less than 30 or a length of
less than 36. Trimmed reads were aligned (HISAT277) to the Mustela putorius furo NCBI reference
genome assembly version MusPutFur1.0 and sorted using SAMtools. Reads were counted and
assigned to gene meta-features using the program featureCounts 78 (Subread package). Count files
were imported into the R programming language and assessed for quality control, normalized, and
analyzed using the limma-trend method 79 for differential gene expression testing and the GSVA80
library for gene set variation analysis. Sequence and gene expression data are available at the Gene
