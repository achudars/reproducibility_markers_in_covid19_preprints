ABSTRACT
Pathogens (bacteria, fungus and virus) are becoming a potential threat to the
health of human beings and environment worldwide. They widely exist in the
environment, with characteristics of variety, spreading quickly and easily causing
adverse reactions. In this work, an Ag-based material is used to be incorporated and
functionalized in polycotton fabrics using pad-dry-cure method. This composite proved
to be effective for inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, decreasing the number of
replicates in 99.99% after an incubation period of 2 minutes. In addition, it caused
99.99% inhibition of the pathogens S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans, preventing crossinfections and does not cause allergies or photoirritation processes, demonstrating the
safety of its use.

INTRODUCTION
Pathogenic microbes are becoming a potential threat to the health of human
beings and environment worldwide. Today, the humanity has experienced epidemic
diseases caused by both new and well known viruses, including hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS,
SARS-CoV, MERS, Lassa fever, Zika virus, and Ebola virus, as well as Yellow Fever,
Influenza, and Measles virus, which are more widespread but can be severe, despite the
availability of vaccines.[1] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Since its first detection in December 2019,[2] it has affected millions of people
worldwide, carrying a mortality rate much higher than the common flu. These public
health outbreaks driven by emerging COVID-19 infectious diseases constitute the
forefront of global safety concerns and significant burden on global economies. While
there is an urgent need for its effective treatment based on antivirals and vaccines, it is
imperative to explore any other effective intervention strategies that may reduce the
mortality and morbidity rates of this disease.
In the absence of an effective vaccine, it is expected that not only the current
pandemic will continue for several months, but other outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2
may take place in the future, in the coming months or years.[3] Furthermore, unknown
viruses and/or pathogens will likely emerge again, and their pathogenicity, spread,

contagion, and mechanism of action will be inquired. This current global crisis alarms
us to the fact that we urgently need to prepare ourselves for a new and unpredictable
epidemic in the future.
The human body is a diverse ecosystem that harbors hundreds of trillions of
microbes (bacteria, fungi and viruses)[4] that might be or become pathogenic under
certain circumstances. The development of innovative materials capable of avoiding the
transmission, spread, and entry of these pathogens into the human body is currently in
the spotlight. Highly effective agents are needed not only to control the emergence of
new COVID-19 pandemia, their increased proliferation capability, and resistance that
severely impact public health, but it is also fundamentally essential to explore strategies
for the preparation and application of new materials against pathogen infection.
Often, the surface of a material is the medium by which the human body
interacts with microbes. Therefore, anti-pathogen strategies based on chemical
modification of the material surface have been developed. One procedure is to form a
layer on the surface of the material, thereby reducing the chance of contact between the
pathogen and the surface of the material. This greatly reduces the number of pathogens
adhering to the surface. Another strategy is that killing the adhered pathogen directly by
decorating the surface of the material with the biocide agent.
Use of personal protective equipment is considered to be one of the most
important strategies for protecting from transmissible pathogens, particularly when
aerosol transmission occurs and when no effective treatment or prophylaxis is available
for the disease provoked by these pathogens in question. In the case of COVID-19, for
instance, the WHO has recently issued recommendation for widespread use of face
masks as an important tool in the control of SARS-CoV-2 spread.[5] Therefore, the
current worldwide public health crisis of COVID-19 has highlighted the particularly
emergent need for materials that inactivate enveloped viruses on contact for preventing
transmission.
Inorganic biocide surfaces and materials have attracted much attention due to
their better stability and safety as compared with organic reagents for preventing
infections and transmission. Among inorganic agents, silver cation and metal are most
widely used. However, Ag cations tend to react with Cl−, HS−, and SO42− in aqueous
solution, forming precipitates, thus losing their biocide activity, which affects the
practical application of Ag-loaded biocide agents to a certain extent. Ag and its
compounds have been widely used since from ancient time, in 1000 BC, to prevent
bacterial growth and wound infections, and make water potable.[6] Ag metal is a
precious metal and is easily discolored under light and heat, but for many years, it was
used as medical treatment as a broad-spectrum antibacterial compound before the
discovery of antibiotics in the early 20th century.[7,8]
Nanotechnology is capable of modifying both Ag cation and metal into their
nano range, which dramatically changes their chemical and physical properties. Ag
nanoparticles (AgNPs) acquire special attention due to its specificity and environment
friendly approach with a wide application in industry and medicine due to its
antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal and anti-parasitic characters. The use of AgNPs has
been greatly enhanced due to the development of antibiotic resistance against several
pathogenic bacteria, and they are employed in biomedical industry as coatings in
dressings, in medicinal devices, in the form of nanogels in cosmetics and lotions,
etc.[6,9,10]
According to the literature, there are plenty of protocols focused on the
production of hybrid/composite materials based on Ag NPs, whose architecture is
driven by different synthetic methods and reaction mechanisms.[11–17] While the
precise reasons for this unique chemistry and physics are unknown, the observed

structures, their reproducibility, and synthetic control this reaction offers, there is plenty
of room to find innovative possibilities for new technologies.[18,19]
Ag NPs have been proven to be most useful because they have excellent
antimicrobial properties against lethal viruses, microbes/germs, and other
microorganisms. These NPs are certainly the most extensively utilized material among
all. Thus, it has been used as antimicrobial agent in different textile industries.[20] The
noble metal NPs are considered as more specific and multipurpose agents with a
diversity of biomedical applications considering their use in extremely sensitive
investigative assays, radiotherapy enhancement, gene delivery, thermal ablation, and
drug delivery. These metallic NPs are also considered to be nontoxic in case of gene and
drug delivery applications. Thus, metallic NPs can offer diagnostic and therapeutic
possibilities simultaneously.[16].
The purpose of this work is to present an innovative material with high
bactericide, fungicide and virucide efficiency in their incorporation and application in
textile applications such as cotton-based materials that make special biopolymer hosts
for composite materials. Finally, it is important to study the reliability of sintered
AgNPs, to test and analyze its allergic response, dermatological photoirrritant and
photosensitive effects, as well as their antimicrobial, fungicide and antiviral activity
EXPERIMENTAL: MATERIALS AND METHODS
Application of chemical finishing onto fabrics
A fine-medium weight 67% polyester / 33% cotton woven fabric (plain weave,
120 g/m²; width 1,60m; ends 35/cm; picks 26/cm; yarn Ne 36 67%Polyester / 33%
cotton) purchased from local suppliers (São Carlos/SP, Brazil) was used for the
application purpose. An AgNP colloidal solution (AgNP-CS) and an AgNP colloidal
solution stabilized with organic polymers (AgNP-OP) were applied on the polycotton
fabric using pad-dry-cure method (NanoxClean® Ag+Fresh 5K, and NanoxClean®
Ag+Fresh Hybrid, respectively, provided by Nanox Tecnologia S.A. – São Carlos/SP Brazil). An acrylic-based binder compound was used in the impregnation solution as
well (Starcoat Denim 50GL provided by Star Colours LTDA. – Americana/SP, Brazil).
The polycotton fabric cut to the size of 30x30 cm was immersed in the solution
containing 5% (% weight basis) of the antimicrobial products and 6% of the acrylicbased binder (% weight basis), for 5 minutes and passed through a laboratory scale
padder, with a 72% wet pick-up maintained for all the treatments. After drying (80°C, 3
min) the fabric was annealed at 170°C for 3 min, then washed with deionized water and
then dried at 80°C for 3 min in a ventilated oven. All samples were then conditioned at
25°C and 65% relative humidity for 48h. Samples were produced according to Table 1.

argon-ion laser (Melles Griot, United States) operating at λ = 514.5 nm and 200 mW.
The spectra were carried out bin the range of 100-3500 cm-1. Morphologies of the
composites were analyzed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM)
on a FEI instrument (Model Inspect F50) operating at 1 kV. Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed using a Jasco FT/IR-6200 (Japan)
spectrophotometer operated in absorbance mode at room temperature. The spectra were
carried out in the range of 400-4000 cm-1.
Assessment of Antimicrobial Activity
The AATCC 147 Parallel Streak Standard Method[21] was used as a qualitative
method to evaluate antibacterial activity of the treated fabrics. Sterile plate count agar
was dispensed in petri plates. 24 hours broth cultures of the test organisms (Escherichia
Coli (E. coli - ATCC8739) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus - ATCC6538) were
used as inoculums. Using a 10µL inoculation loop, 1 loop full of culture was loaded and
transferred to the surface of the agar plate by making 7.5cm long parallel streaks 1 cm
apart in the center of the plate, refilling the loop at every streak. The test specimen was
gently pressed transversely, across the five inoculums of streaks to ensure intimate
contact with the agar surface. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 18-48 hours. After
incubation, a streak of interrupted growth underneath and along the side of the test
material indicates antibacterial effectiveness of the fabric.
The quantitative antimicrobial activity assessment of the treated polycotton
fabrics was determined according to AATCC Test Method 100[22]. Fabric specimens
(circular swatch 4.8 cm in diameter) were impregnated with 1.0 mL of inoculum in a
250 mL container. The inoculum was a nutrient broth culture containing 2.0~3.0 ·
105/mL colony forming units of microorganisms. E. coli and S. aureus were used as a
reference for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively, and C. albicans
(ATCC 10231) as a reference for fungus. The microorganisms counted on the treated
polycotton fabric and those on a controlled sample were determined after a 24-hour
incubation period at 37°C. The antimicrobial activity was expressed in terms of
percentage reduction of the microorganism after contact with the test specimen
compared to the number of microbial cells surviving after contact with the control. The
results are expressed as percent reduction of microorganisms by Eq. (1).
Reduction (%) = [(B-A)/B] x 100

where A and B are the numbers of bacteria or fungus recovered from the
antimicrobial-treated and untreated polycotton fabrics in the jar incubated over the
desired contact period, respectively.
Assessment of Antiviral Activity
An adaptation of ISO 18184 Determination of antiviral activity of textile
products Standard Method[23] was used as a reference for a quantitative method to
evaluate the treated polycotton’s ability to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles
(SARS-CoV-2/human/BRA/SP02cc/2020 - MT350282), under the tested conditions, at
two different time intervals (2 and 5 minutes of contact time). The virus was inoculated
into liquid media containing no fabric, treated and non-treated polycotton samples and
incubated for 2 different time periods. Then, they were plated onto tissue cultures of
Vero CCL-81 cells. After the incubation, the viral genetic material was quantified in
each condition using real-time quantitative PCR, and based on the control samples, the
ability of each sample to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 was determined.
Briefly, Vero CCL-81 cells were plated onto 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per
well. The cells were maintained in DMEM high glucose culture medium (Sigma-

Aldrich, 51435C) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL of penicillin,
and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin. The plate was incubated at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 atmosphere
for 24 h. Following this period, the medium was removed and replaced with 666.7 µL
of DMEM High Glucose/well without supplementation.
Three test specimens, non-treated polycotton control and Ag-based antimicrobial
treated polycotton samples, measuring 6.25 cm2 apiece, were tested. Each test specimen
was placed into a different tube and 1.33 mL of DMEM high glucose medium without
supplementation was added to each tube. In parallel, 500 µL of culture medium
containing SARS-CoV-2 was diluted in 4.5 mL of DMEM medium without
supplementation, and then 333.4 µL of this viral suspension was added to each of the
tubes containing the pieces of cloth. The mixtures were incubated with the virus for 2
min and the tubes were homogenized every 30 seconds. After this period, 166.7 µL of
each sample was transferred to different wells of the plates containing the cells
previously seeded. After a total of 5 min of incubation, an additional 166.7 µL-aliquot
was removed from each tube and incubated in other wells on the same plate. As control,
the viral suspension was incubated in media without supplementation, with samples
collected at 2 and 5 min used to infect Vero cells on the same plate
The plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 for viral adsorption, and after
this period, 166.6 µL of DMEM High Glucose medium containing 12% fetal bovine
serum were added to each well, making to a final volume of 1 mL of medium/well
containing 2% serum. Immediately after adding the medium, the plate was further
incubated at 37 ºC, 5% CO2. After 48 h, the plate was removed from the incubator and
100 µL of the medium from each well (each well a different condition) was removed
and placed in lysis buffer to proceed with the viral RNA extraction. For the extraction,
the MagMAX™ CORE Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher) was used,
following the manufacturer’s instructions, on the semi-automated platform MagMAX
Express-96 (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). The detection of viral RNA
was carried out using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems) on an
ABI 7500 SDS real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems), using a published
protocol and sequence of primers and probe for E gene.[24] The number of RNA
copies/mL was quantified by real-time RT-qPCR using a specific in vitro-transcribed
RNA quantification standard, kindly granted by Christian Drosten, Charité Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany, as described previously.[25] The viricidal
activity, or viral inactivation, was determined as a percentage related to the control
(media without fabric specimen).
The experiment was repeated using the same experimental conditions, but with
media incubated with two pieces of test specimens (instead of one) per condition.
Assessment of Allergic Response
A Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT) was performed to determine the
absence of the potential for dermal irritability and sensitization of the treated fabrics.
The study was carried out in maximized conditions, in which semi-occlusive dressings
containing the investigational product and controls were applied to the participants'
backs. The application of the study dressings occurred for six weeks, with three weeks
of application alternately, two weeks of rest and a new application of the dressing
containing the product in virgin area in the sixth week (challenge). The readings of the
application site were performed at each dressing change according to the reading scale
recommended by the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG)[26].
Dermatological evaluations were carried out at the beginning and end of the study, and
a physician was available for evaluation and assistance to the participants in case of
positive or adverse reaction. Participants of both genders, with phototypes III to IV

Assessment of Dermatological Photoirrritant and Photosensitive Potential
Since exposure to solar radiation can trigger or aggravate adverse reactions to
topical products, knowing the behavior of the product on human skin stimulated with
ultraviolet radiation is of fundamental importance for proof of safety. Therefore, a
unicentric, blind, comparative clinical study to assess the photoirritating and
photosensitizing potential was also conducted, with the aim of proving the absence of
the irritating potential of the product applied to the skin when exposed to ultraviolet
radiation. The study was carried out with dressings containing the product, applied to
the participants' skin and, after removal, controlled irradiation with a spectrum of
ultraviolet radiation emission was performed. Readings were performed according to
the reading scale recommended by the ICDRG. The study with the participants lasted
for five weeks, covering 3 phases: induction, rest and challenge. Dermatological
evaluations were performed at the beginning and end of the study, or when there was an
indication of positivity or adverse reaction. Participants of both genders, with phototype
III (Fitzpatrick), aged between 21 and 62 were selected. The selected participants were

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
There are numerous ways to functionalize a textile substrate, from the
development of new structures up to finishes that modify the material’s surface. The
superficial modification through the incorporation of nanoparticles has been extensively
studied and shows potential for obtaining devices with microbicidal activity.[28–33] In
this scenario, nanoparticles can advantageously replace micrometric particles used in
the finishes to obtain functional fabrics, because it has a greater surface area, resulting
in a better adhesion to fabrics and, consequently, greater durability of functionality.
Furthermore, it is possible to achieve a pronounced effect with small amounts of
material not altering the original properties of the fabric. Traditionally, the pad-dry-cure
is the most common finishing route applied to impart different finish treatments on
textile fabrics.[34,35] In this way, the interactions between the polycotton fabric and the

Ag NPs were investigated, in order to observe how these changes mirrored the
microbicidal properties in the new Ag-based fabric.
In order to analyze the local structural order/disorder caused by the addition of
Ag-based antimicrobials to polycotton, micro-Raman analyzes were performed. The
results are presented in Figure 1. The adhesion and durability of a superficial change in
fabrics depends on the surface chemical properties.[28] Since the main component of
polycotton is cotton (formed by glucose monomers) and polyester (polyethylene
terephthalate), the vibrations refer to C, O and H bonds. The cotton Raman spectra of
the samples can be divided into four blocks related to the glycosidic ring skeleton, to
OH groups, the CH and CH2 groups and acetylation of cotton. The glycosidic ring
presents the fingerprint of the cotton Raman spectra. These modes can be observed at
859, 1104, 1123 and 1183 cm-1 and represent the symmetrical stretching of C-O-C in
the plane, asymmetric and symmetrical stretching of C-O-C in the glycosidic link, and
asymmetric stretching of C-C ring breathing.[36] The presence of OH groups in the
samples is observed by the modes located at 287 and 1464 cm-1, related to the twisting
and deformation of the C-OH bonds.[37,38] Four modes related to CH2 deformations
and twisting are observed in 1000, 1291, 1372 and 1418 cm-1. There is still a mode
located at 289 cm-1 regarding the twisting of the C-CH bond.[39] The acetylation of the
cotton used is further confirmed by the modes located at 705 and 795 cm-1, referring to
deformation O-C=O and the stretching of the H3C-C bonds.[40] Like cotton, polyester
has its fingerprint given by the modes referring to its aromatic ring and its esters. It is
observed in 1613 cm-1 the mode referring to the stretching of the C1-C4 carbon of the
aromatic polyester ring, as well as its CH stretching in 3078 cm-1.[41,42] It is also
possible to observe in 1730 cm-1 the stretching of the C=O bonds of the esters and the
stretching of the CH bonds of the methyl groups external to the ring, in 2975 cm-1.[41–
43] It is observed that the addition of Ag-based antimicrobials do not cause significant
changes in the polycotton structure at short-range.

incorporation of the two Ag-based antimicrobial solutions into the polycotton (Figure
2). It is observed in the samples of pure polycotton and those modified with the Agbased antimicrobials the peaks located at 3540, 2936, 2124, 1947, 1710, 1338, 1147,
832 and 647 cm-1. The peaks located at 3540, 2936 and 2124 cm-1 refer to OH
stretching and CH deformation respectively, the latter being related to the CH2 groups
of the cellulose structure.[44,45] The peaks located in 1947, 1710, 1338 and 1147 cm-1
correspond respectively to H2O adsorbed on the polycotton surface, stretching of the
CH bond, asymmetric deformation of the C-O-C groups and were attributed to
stretching vibrations of intermolecular ester bonding.[45–47] As in the Raman spectra,
the cotton fingerprint can be observed in the FTIR due to the presence of the band
located at 832 cm-1, referring to the asymmetric stretching of the glycosidic ring,
especially the C1-O-C4 bonds.[46] It is observed for the modified polycotton in relation
to the non-treated polycotton the displacement of the band located at 1338 cm-1, as well
as the decrease of the band located around 647 cm-1, referent to in-plane bending of O-H
mode from the glycosidic units and deformation of the OH, respectively.[48,49] These
shifts, as well as the appearance of new bands in the FTIR spectra of the modified
polycotton are due to interactions between polycotton and Ag-based antimicrobial
additives.[50–52]

To observe morphological changes in polycotton fibers, FE-SEM measurements
were performed (Figure 3). There are no significant differences in the fiber diameters of
the samples, being the average diameter values obtained for the Non-Treated
Polycotton, Polycotton AgNP-CS and Polycotton AgNP-OP were 10.62 ± 2.30, 10.22 ±

possible to observe the formation of small Ag nanoparticles on the polycotton surface,
with average size of the 23.51 ± 5.18 nm. Similar behavior was obtained by several
other authors in works that incorporated AgNPs into polycotton in different ways.[53–
60] For Polycotton AgNP-OP, the formation of a smaller amount of Ag nanoparticles
with average size higher (126.9 ± 19.5 nm) than the than Polycotton AgNP-CS were
observed. In addition, there is a homogeneous distribution of micrometric crystals with

well-defined morphology over all polycotton surface fibers, with an average size of 1.62
± 0.44 μm. These differences are due to the different composition of both Ag-based
antimicrobials, which result in different surface effects on polycotton surface fibers.

and (g-i) Polycotton AgNP-OP.
Since Ag-based antimicrobial additives caused distinct surface interactions in
polycotton fibers, it is expected that this difference will be reflected in their physical,
chemical and biological properties. In this sense, experiments were carried out to
evaluate the biological properties of composites obtained through the allergenic
response to humans and microbicidal activity against E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans and
SARS-CoV-2.
The AATCC 147 test results against S. aureus (gram positive) and E. coli
(gram negative) bacteria for the non-treated and the Ag-based antimicrobial treated
polycotton samples are shown in Figure 4 and Table 4. For the control polycotton,
growth of E. coli and S. aureus was observed under the specimen while no growth
appeared for the treated fabric. The zone of inhibition for the control sample was 0 mm,
in comparison to 2-3 mm for the treated fabric. It can be seen from these results that the
Ag-based antimicrobials treated fabrics displayed a high level of antibacterial
performance.

The antibacterial mechanism for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is
associated with Ag NPs and their penetration into the cell membrane of these
microorganisms. Ag NPs are able to penetrate cell membranes and release Ag+ ions,
which have a high affinity to react with phosphorus and sulfur compounds, either from
the membrane or from inside of the cell.[61] In addition, Ag NPs can generate reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which cause an accumulation of intracellular ROS, leading to
bacterial death from oxidative stress[62].

The halo inhibition test (AATCC 147) is only a qualitative test that shows
bacterial inhibition, requiring a qualitative test to determine the percentages of
inhibition (AATCC 100). The quantitative antimicrobial activities of finished textiles
treated with the two different Ag-based antimicrobials according to the AATCC 100
standard are shown in Table 5. These tests were also performed with C. albicans, in
order to assess the fungicidal potential of the Ag-based fabrics. In agreement with the
qualitative test, the quantitative test showed that all the Ag-based treated polycotton

The antiviral activity test was designed to determine the inactivation of viral
particles upon short exposure to the products, which in this case were the Ag-based
treated polycotton samples incubated in liquid media. After a short period of incubation,
the media were transferred to a cell culture, where viable virions would be able to enter
cells and replicate within. The supernatant of cell cultures was recovered after 48 h and
the viral load was determined by RT-qPCR, resulting in the determination of number of
viral RNA copies per mL.
Table 6 shows the number of copies of the control media without any fabric
sample, non-treated polycotton, and the two Ag-based treated polycotton samples at the
two different tested time periods. With the result of the number of copies of each
sample, the viral inactivation effect of each cloth was calculated, using the media
without any fabric sample as control.

In both experiments, in the two time periods tested, the untreated polycotton
showed a subtle activity, which was already expected by data already published by Chin
and colleagues.[63] Polycotton AgNP-CS showed a high viricidal activity when
incubated with the virus. At both time periods in both experiments, Polycotton AgNPOP obtained a higher rate of viral inactivation compared to Polycotton AgNP-CS.
In short, both treated polycotton samples were effective in viral inhibition in 2
and 5 minutes in two different experiments, where there was variation in the amount of
virus per cm² of fabric (4x less virus/cm² in the second experiment). Polycotton AgNPOP showed the best activity, reaching 99.99% within two minutes of incubation with
the virus in the second experiment. Polycotton AgNP-CS, despite being less effective
than Polycotton AgNP-OP, showed high anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, with more than
80% inhibition rate in all tests performed.
As an antiviral agent, Ag NPs can interfere with viral replication by two separate
mechanisms of adhesion to the surface of the viral envelope. This adhesion prevents the
virus from being able to connect to the infecting cell, preventing contamination and
possible damage.[64,65] These antiviral mechanisms are mainly caused by stress in
infected cells (due to physical contact), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
interactions with DNA and enzymatic damage.[66] The first mechanism is through the
binding of Ag NPs with sulfur residues from the virus's surface glycoproteins,
preventing interaction with the receptor and its entry into the host cell.[67,68] The
second mechanism involves the passage of Ag NPs through the cell membrane that
consequently, it ends up effectively blocking the transcription factors necessary for the
adequate assembly of the viral progeny.[69] Thus, in addition to the unique behavior of

Ag NPs in isolation, its interface with polymers can be explored, which may open the
way for new ones promising applications in several fields of action.
Both the Human Repeat Insult Patch Test and the clinical study to assess the
photoirritating and photosensitizing potential were conducted according to the Cosmetic
Product Safety Assessment Guide, published by the Brazilian regulatory agency
ANVISA[70], by the ECOLYZER Group (São Paulo/SP, Brazil), an independent and
ISO certified laboratory. For the HRIPT, Primary Dermal Irritability, Accumulated
Dermal Irritability and Dermal Sensitization potential were determined. The clinical
evaluation criterion was the observation of clinical signs or symptoms such as swelling
(edema), redness (erythema), papules and vesicles according to the reading scale
recommended by the ICDRG. No adverse reactions (erythema, edema, papules or
vesicles) were detected in the product's application areas, in the analysis of primary and
accumulated irritability, sensitization, during the study period. The same clinical
evaluation criterion was used to determine the Dermal Photoirritation and Dermal
Photosensitization in the clinical study. As in the HRIPT, on this study no adverse
reactions (erythema, edema, papules or vesicles) were detected in the product's
application areas during the study period. According to the results obtained from the
sample of participants studied, we can conclude that the treated fabrics did not induce a
photoirritating, photosensitizing, irritation nor sensitization process and, therefore, can
be considered hypoallergenic and dermatologically tested and approved, being
considered safe, according to ANVISA's Guide for Cosmetic Product Safety.
CONCLUSIONS
Polycotton fabrics can be functionalized to attain antibacterial, antifungal and
antiviral properties using a simplistic and very common finishing treatment method in
nature, the pad-dry-cure. The use of an aqueous Ag NPs solution mixed with an acrylicbased binder was demonstrated to achieve a high level of antimicrobial performance and
can potentially present a high durability in relation to washing cycles as a result of the
use of the binder in the impregnation solution. FTIR and Raman analyzes showed
different surface effects on polycotton surface fibers due to the different chemical nature
of both tested antimicrobial finishing products. Additionally, the antimicrobial finishing
did not display significant differences in the fiber diameters of the samples, as shown by
the FE-SEM images. Therefore, this product had excellent universality in the
preparation, and it is expected that no significant change in fabric’s organoleptic
properties change, requiring no special condition for its use in a major scale. Future
experimental investigation would open new avenues to include the antiviral,
antibacterial and antifungal treatment to a wide variety of different surfaces in addition
to polycotton fabrics such as synthetic and natural fabrics, including cotton, polyesters
and polyamides. Beyond the scope of this work, this simple and facile antimicrobial
finishing treatment could be potentially scaled for industrial applications after
addressing challenges such as choosing appropriate processing conditions and
developing feasible waste disposition protocols. The main differential capability of
these Ag-based fabrics is the prevention of cross infection caused by pathogens, such as
opportunistic bacteria and fungi, responsible for the worsening of COVID-19 and other
types of viruses. The fabrication of these fabrics composed of these materials may
provide new insights into the development of protection garments and it is expected that
these new textile materials may play an outstanding role as a new and important weapon
against the current COVID-19 pandemic.
