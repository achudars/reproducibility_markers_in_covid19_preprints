Abstract

19

Cell entry of the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by its spike protein S. As

20

main antigenic determinant, S protein is in focus of antibody-based prophylactic and

21

therapeutic strategies. Besides particle-cell fusion, S mediates fusion between infected

22

and uninfected cells resulting in syncytia formation. Here we present quantitative assay

23

systems covering not only particle-cell and cell-cell fusion, but also demonstrating

24

fusion-from-without (FFWO), the formation of syncytia induced by S-containing viral

25

particles in absence of newly synthesized S protein. Based on complementation of split

26

β-galactosidase and virus-like-particles (VLPs) displaying S protein, this assay can be

27

performed at BSL-1. All three assays provided readouts with a high dynamic range and

28

signal-to-noise ratios covering several orders of magnitude. The data obtained confirm

29

the enhancing effect of trypsin and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme

30

2 (ACE2) on membrane fusion. Neutralizing antibodies as well as sera from

31

convalescent patients inhibited particle-cell fusion with high efficiency. Cell-cell fusion,

32

in contrast, was only moderately inhibited despite requiring much lower levels of S

33

protein, which were below the detection limit of flow cytometry and Western blot. The

34

data indicate that syncytia formation as a pathological consequence in tissues of

35

Covid-19 patients can proceed at low levels of S protein and may not be effectively

36

prevented by antibodies.

Introduction

39

The emergence of the so-called SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is met with an

40

unprecedented global scientific effort. As causative agent of the pandemic and the

41

associated disease COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 is a typical coronavirus, with a large spike

42

protein (S) inserted in the membrane of the enveloped particle. Being the main surface-

43

exposed antigen and the mediator of cell entry, S protein forms the most important

44

target of current efforts to develop therapeutic drugs and prophylactic vaccines (Gioia

45

et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020).

46

As a typical class I viral fusion protein, S protein forms trimers with a globular head

47

domain containing the receptor-binding site which contacts angiotensin-converting

48

enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its entry receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Lan et al., 2020;

49

Monteil et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020).

50

Proteolytic cleavage separates the globular head (S1 domain) and the stalk domain

51

(S2), which contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide at its N-terminus and the

52

transmembrane domain towards the C-terminus. Priming of the fusion-competent state

53

requires processing of two cleavage sites localized in close N-terminal proximity of the

54

fusion peptide. These cleavage sites can be recognized by alternative proteases, thus

55

explaining the high flexibility of the virus to adapt to various tissues. In particular, the

56

S1/S2 site is cleaved by proprotein convertases like furin localized in the trans-golgi

57

network during trafficking of the newly synthesized S protein to the cell surface. The

58

S2’ site can be cleaved by the serine protease TMPRSS2 which is exposed on the

59

surface of target cells and contacted when the virus binds to ACE2. In absence of

60

TMPRSS2, virus particles are endocytosed and cleaved by cathepsins (Hasan et al.,

61

2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Hoffmann et al., 2020a; Shang et al., 2020a; Walls et

62

al., 2020). In cell culture, trypsin was described as further alternative protease able to

63

activate membrane fusion (Ou et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020; Zhang and Kutateladze,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.340604; this version posted October 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this

64

2020). Thus, two alternative entry routes exist for SARS-CoV-2, notably determined

65

by the availability of activating proteases (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Tang et al., 2020).

66

For both routes, membrane fusion is pH-independent.

67

Like other fusion proteins that are active pH-independently, S protein mediates not only

68

fusion between the viral and the cellular membranes during particle entry, but also

69

fusion of infected cells with uninfected cells. This process is mediated by newly

70

synthesized S protein accumulating at the cell surface. The resulting syncytia are giant

71

cells containing at least three, often many more nuclei. Cell-cell fusion is used by

72

viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Compton and Schwartz, 2017;

73

Bracq et al., 2018), measles virus (MV) (Griffin, 2020), or herpesvirus (Cole and Grose,

74

2003) to spread in a particle-independent way. The resulting syncytia are documented

75

as pathological consequence detectable in various tissues such as lung (MV), skin

76

(herpesvirus) or lymphoid tissues (HIV). In brain, cell-to-cell transmission via

77

hyperfusogenic F proteins constitutes a hallmark of MV-caused encephalitis as a fatal

78

consequence of acute MV infections manifesting years later (Ferren et al., 2019).

79

Besides particle-cell and cell-cell fusion, a third membrane fusion process mediated by

80

viral spike proteins has been designated fusion-from-without (FFWO) (Roller et al.,

81

2008). FFWO results in syncytia in absence of newly expressed fusion protein. In

82

presence of a sufficient concentration of particle-associated fusion protein, adjacent

83

cells are fused e.g. by bound HIV or herpesvirus particles either directly or after uptake

84

of spike protein and its presentation at the cell surface (Clavel and Charneau, 1994;

85

Melikyan, 2014).

86

Here, we investigated the competence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein for these three

87

membrane fusion processes. For each of them, we established quantitative assays

88

relying on expressed S protein, thereby avoiding work with infectious virus at BSL-3

89

safety level. The data reveal a strong membrane fusion activity of the S protein,

demonstrate syncytia formation even at undetectable levels of S protein, and fusion-

92

potent neutralizing capacity against particle-cell fusion, but only moderate or low

93

activity against cell-cell fusion.

Methods

96

Expression plasmids

97

An expression plasmid for codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 S with a C-terminal HA tag

98

(pCG-SARS-CoV-2-S-HA) was kindly provided by Karl-Klaus Conzelmann (Hennrich

99

et al., 2020).The Plasmid pCG-SARS-CoV-2-S∆19 encoding the S∆19 variant was

100

generated by PCR amplification of the truncated S sequence, inserting PacI and SpeI

restriction

102

TTATTAATTAAATGTTCGTGTTTCTGGTG-3’

103

TATACTAGTTCTAGCAGCAGCTGCC-3’. The PCR fragment was inserted into the

104

pCG backbone by restriction cloning. The lentiviral transfer vector plasmid pCMV-LacZ

105

was generated by amplifying the lacZ coding sequence under CMV promotor control,

106

simultaneously inserting a SbfI restriction site for subcloning into pSEW via

107

EcoRI/Bsu36I (Funke et al., 2008). Expression plasmids pCMV-α and pCMV-ω

108

encoding the α and ω parts of β-galactosidase have been described previously

109

(Holland et al. 2004). The expression plasmid for N-terminally myc-tagged hACE2

110

(pCMV3-SP-Myc-ACE2) was purchased from Sino Biological (HG10108-NM).

HEK-293T (Lenti-X 293T, Takara Bio) and Vero E6 (ATCC) cells were cultured in

114

Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Medium High Glucose (Sigma, D6546) supplemented

115

with 10% FBS (Sigma, F7524, lot BCCB7222) and 1x L-glutamine (Sigma, G7513) (i.e.

116

DMEM complete). HEK-293T cells were subcultured twice a week at ratios between

117

1:8 and 1:10 using 0.25% trypsin in 1 mM EDTA - PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+. MRC-5

118

cells (ATCC) were cultured in Minimal Essential Medium Eagle (Sigma, M2414)

119

supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x L-glutamine and 1x non-essential amino acids

Minimal Essential Medium Eagle (Sigma, M2414) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x L-

122

glutamine, 1x non-essential amino acids (Gibco, 11140-035) and 1x sodium pyruvate

123

(Gibco, 11360-070). MRC-5 and Calu-3 were subcultured with trypsin in EDTA-PBS

124

every two weeks at ratios between 1:2 and 1:3, medium was exchanged twice weekly.

125

For transfection of HEK-293T in T75 flasks, two mixes were prepared, each in 1 mL

126

plain DMEM High Glucose, one containing 60 µL of 18 mM TA-Trans

127

(polyethyleneimine) and the other 15 µg plasmid DNA. When the amount of S protein

128

encoding plasmid was varied, pCDNA3.1(+) was added to compensate for the overall

129

plasmid quantity. The mixtures were combined and incubated together for at least 20

130

min. Medium on cells was replaced by 4.3 mL of 1.5 x growth medium (15% FBS, 1.5

131

x L-Glutamine) and 2 mL transfection mix were added. Cells were incubated for 4-8 h

132

before medium was replaced by 10 mL of fresh growth medium.

133
134

Production of LVs and VLPs

135

For the production of LV particles and VLPs, we adapted our established protocol for

136

the generation of LVs pseudotyped with paramyxoviral glycoproteins (Bender et al.,

137

2016). In brief, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the envelope plasmid pCG-

138

SARS-CoV-2-S∆19, the transfer vector plasmid pCMV-LacZ and the packaging

139

plasmid pCMVd8.9 in a 35:100:65 ratio. For VLPs, the transfer vector plasmid was

140

omitted, but the total amount of plasmid and the ratio of envelope to packaging plasmid

141

retained. Supernatants harvested 48 hours after transfection were clarified by 0.45 µm

142

filtration. Particles were purified and concentrated 333-fold into PBS from the clarified

143

supernatant by overnight centrifugation over a 20% sucrose cushion at 4500 x g and

144

4°C. Concentrated stocks were frozen to -80°C before use, and aliquots used once

145

after thawing. Particle numbers were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis

146

using the NanoSight300 system (Malvern).

147
148

Transduction and neutralization

149

2x104 cells/ well were seeded into flat-bottom 96-well plates in complete growth

150

medium. On the next day, 0.2 µL/well of S∆19-LV or VSV-LV stock was added in

151

complete growth medium. For neutralization, antibody and sera were incubated with

152

the vector stock at concentrations of 40 µg/ mL and 50% v/v, respectively, in a final

153

volume of 50 µL/well for 30-60 min at 37°C. Medium was aspirated from the seeded

154

cells and replaced by 50 µL/well of the transduction mix. The next morning, medium

155

was exchanged for 100 µL/well of fresh complete growth medium. Transduction

156

efficiencies were determined three days after vector addition by luminescence readout

157

of cellular galactosidase activity.

158
159

Sera & S-Neutralizing Antibodies

160

Sera donation with informed consent was approved by an ethics vote from the local

161

committee at Frankfurt University Hospital. Sera were from two convalescent patients

162

who had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by PCR from throat swabs approximately

163

4 months prior to donation. Both had experienced only mild symptoms. A commercially

164

available pool of human off-the-clot sera (PAN Biotech, P30-2701) served as a

165

negative control. A commercially available neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2

166

(Sino Biological, 40592-R001) and the corresponding normal control (Sino Biological,

167

CR1) served as a positive control.

169

Fusion assays and neutralization

170

HEK-293T cells were transfected as described above, in the T75 format. Two days

171

after transfection, cells were detached by incubation in 0.25% trypsin - 1 mM EDTA –

172

PBS for 10-15 min. Cells were characterized with regards to count and viability using

173

the Luna-Fl cell counter and acridine orange/propidium iodide dye (Logos Bio). Cells

174

were pelleted at 300 x g for 5 min and resuspended in complete growth medium to

175

yield a cell density of 5x104 cells/20 µL. Cocultures were set up in V-bottom plates at

176

105 cells/well. Cells were pelleted (300 x g, 30 s at start) just before transfer to the

177

incubator. For FFWO, VLPs were diluted to desired concentrations in complete growth

178

medium and added to cocultures at 20 µL/well by thorough pipetting prior to the 30 s

179

centrifugation. For neutralization of FFWO, 5x108 particles/well were incubated with

180

antibodies or sera for 30 min in the incubator before addition to the coculture. For the

181

neutralization of particle-free cell fusion, effector cells were pre-incubated with

182

antibodies or sera in a volume of 40 µL/well (i.e. 5x104 cells/well) for 30 min in the

183

incubator, retaining the inhibitor concentrations specified above. After pre-incubation,

184

effector cells were mixed with target cells in a total culture volume of 60 µL/well.

185
186

Luminescense readout

187

Activity of the β-galactosidase reporter was quantified using the Galactostar assay kit

188

(Thermo, T1012). At the assay endpoint (3 days post transduction or 20 h after

189

coculture setup), cultures were lysed: Cocultures in V-bottom plate were pelleted at

190

300 x g, 5 min. Supernatant was removed completely, 50 µL/well of lysis buffer was

191

added and plates were agitated on an orbital shaker at 450 rpm at room temperature

192

for 10 min. Plates were then frozen to -80°C. For the luminescence readout, samples

193

were equilibrated to room temperature and mixed by orbital shaking at 750 rpm for 2

194

min. 10 µL/well of lysate was added to 50 µL/well of substrate working dilution

195

(prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions) in a white plastic flat-bottom plate

196

and mixed by orbital shaking at 750 rpm for 2 min. After 30-60 min incubation at room

197

temperature in the dark, luminescence was measured on an Orion II plate luminometer

198

(Berthold Systems) with an exposure time of 0.1 s/well.

200

Immunofluorescence staining and laser scanning microscopy

201

Vero E6 cells constitutively expressing GFP were generated by LV mediated

202

transduction and subsequent puromycin selection. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected

203

with RFP and the S∆19 or full-length S protein. 5x104 transfected HEK-293T cells were

204

seeded in chamber slides (Thermo, 177402) and left to attach overnight. On the next

205

day 5x104 Vero-GFP cells were added and cocultured for 7 h. Cells were fixed in 4%

206

PFA, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for

207

15 min. Subsequently, cells were stained with Phalloidin-Atto633 (1:500, Sigma 68825)

208

and HOECHST3342 (1:10,000, Sigma B2261) for 1h at RT before being imaged on an

209

SP8 Lightning laser scanning microscope (Leica) with a HC PL APO CS2 40x/1.30

210

lens.

Western Blot

213

Cells were detached by trypsin treatment, counted with a hemocytometer and lyzed in

214

RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris/HCL pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium

215

deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,

216

05892970001). Cell lysates were incubated for 10 min at 95°C in 4x sample buffer (240

217

mM Tris/HCL pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerin, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% β-

218

mercaptoethanol). Vector particles were denatured for 10 min at 95°C in 2x Urea buffer

on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham,

222

10600004). The lower part of the membranes were incubated with mouse anti-p24

223

(Clone 38/8.7.47, 1:1000, Gentaur) and the upper part with mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2

224

spike (Clone: 1A9, 1:1000, GeneTex) overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the membranes

225

were incubated with the secondary antibody rabbit anti-mouse conjugated to

226

horseradish peroxidase (Dako, 1:2000) for 90 min at RT. Luminescence signals were

227

detected on the chemiluminescence reader MicroChemi (DNR) after adding ECL

228

Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo, 32106).

229
230

Flow cytometry

231

105 HEK-293T effector cells used for fusion assays were stained for surface expression

232

of S protein. Cell suspensions were washed twice in wash buffer (2% FCS, 0.1%

233

sodium azide, 1 mM EDTA in PBS). S protein was specifically stained with the mouse

234

IgG1 anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Clone: 1A9, GeneTex, 1 µL/105 cells in 100 µL)

235

antibody for 45 min at 4°C followed by the incubation with the secondary antibody anti-

236

IgG1-PE (REA1017, Miltenyi Biotec, 1 µL/105 cells in 100 µL) for 30 min at 4°C. Viability

237

of the cells was assessed using the fixable viability dye eFluor780 (eBioscience,

238

1:1000). Finally, cells were fixed in 1% PFA and analyzed by flow cytometry using the

239

MACSQuant Analyzer 10x (Miltenyi Biotec).

241

Statistical Analysis

242

All statistical analyses were carried out in GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2.

243

Luminescense data and flow cytometry MFIs were assumed to be lognormally

244

distributed. Accordingly, tests were performed on log-transformed data which were

245

assumed to be normally distributed. Data generated from the same batch of

246

transfected cells (i.e. from the same biological replicate) were handled as matched

Results

257

Spike protein mediated particle entry

258

To follow particle entry mediated by S protein, we set out to generate potent lentiviral

259

vectors (LVs) pseudotyped with S protein to set up an assay with a high signal-to-noise

260

ratio. Codon-optimized S protein, full length or carrying the previously described C-

261

terminal truncation (SΔ19), were used for pseudotyping (Ou et al., 2020). LVs

262

transferring the β-galactosidase gene lacZ were generated by transient transfection of

263

HEK-293T cells and subsequently purified and concentrated (Fig. 1A). Western blot

264

analysis of LV batches revealed a stronger spike signal relative to p24 for SΔ19,

265

demonstrating its better incorporation into LV particles (Fig. 1B). SΔ19-LVs were

266

titrated on cell lines frequently used in coronavirus research, i.e. Vero E6, MRC-5,

267

Calu-3, HEK-293T and HEK-293T overexpressing ACE2 (293T-ACE2). On all cell lines

268

included, the luminescense signal increased linearly with the amount of vector added

269

(Fig. 1C). In contrast to LVs pseudotyped with the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus

270

(VSV-LV), SΔ19-LV did not reach a plateau in the signal, indicating that only a

271

subsaturating fraction of the cells was transduced. However, transduction rates with

272

SΔ19-LV increased more than 100-fold upon overexpression of hACE2 on HEK-293T

273

cells reaching a signal to noise ratio of more than 2000. VSVG-LV mediated gene

274

delivery was not affected by overexpression of hACE2 (Fig. 1D). Remarkably, with a

275

saturating dose of SΔ19-LV, a similar luminescense signal was reached on 293T-

276

ACE2 cells as with VSV-LV (Fig. 1C).

278

Quantifying cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein

279

Upon transfection, SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed a remarkable fusogenic activity.

280

When transfected HEK-293T cells producing SΔ19-LV were detached and cocultured

281

in a 1:1 ratio with Vero E6 cells, plates were covered by large syncytia, each containing

282

at least 10, and, up to 100 nuclei, formed overnight (Suppl. Fig. 1A). To examine this

283

further, the full-length and truncated forms of S were overexpressed in HEK-293T and

284

cocultures with Vero E6 target cells were imaged by confocal laser scanning

285

microscopy (Suppl. Fig. 1B). Both, S and SΔ19 protein, induced many large syncytia

286

characterized by cytoskeletal rearrangement, clustering of more than five nuclei and

287

colocalization of the RFP and GFP reporter dye signals (Suppl. Fig. 1C).

288

To quantify the cell-cell fusion mediated by S protein, an α-complementation assay

289

based on β-galactosidase previously used to evaluate HIV-mediated fusion (Holland

290

et al., 2004) was adapted to the S protein. Upon cell-cell fusion, complementation

291

inside the syncytium results in active enzyme that can be quantified by converting

292

substrate in a luminescence reaction (Fig. 2A). In a first step, the minimal amount of S

293

protein required to result in a detectable signal was determined. Effector cells were

294

transfected with varying quantities of S protein encoding plasmid ranging and S protein

295

surface expression was followed by flow cytometry. S protein expression was still

296

clearly detectable with 75 ng of plasmid, while the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)

297

at 7.5 ng plasmid was indistinguishable from background (Fig. 2B). Notably, this low

298

level of S protein was still sufficient to induce significant cell-cell fusion, when the assay

299

was allowed to proceed over-night, highlighting the potent fusogenic activity of S

300

protein (Fig. 2C). With higher amounts of plasmid, three hours incubation were

301

sufficient to obtain signals more than 10-fold above background. Interestingly, when

302

cells were detached prior to coculture with EDTA only instead of trypsin-EDTA, the cell

303

fusion activity decreased by at least one order of magnitude, and only overnight

304

incubation yielded signals significantly over background (Fig. 2D). When target cells

305

overexpressed ACE2 and were detached with trypsin, the maximum extend of the

306

fusion signal increased by another order of magnitude (Fig. 2D). Now, the signal-to-

307

noise ratio reached two orders of magnitude already after one hour incubation

308

including the samples expressing the lowest amounts of S protein. This highlights the

309

dependence of S protein activity on the presence of ACE2. Under optimal conditions

310

and with ACE2 overexpressing cells, a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.8 orders of magnitude

311

was reached.

312
313

Fusion-from-without mediated by S protein

314

To examine whether S protein present on the surface of viral particles can mediate

315

FFWO, we generated LV-based virus-like-particles (VLPs) having the SΔ19 protein

316

incorporated. Western blot analysis confirmed that similar levels of SΔ19 protein were

317

present in VLPs and SΔ19-LV particles (Fig. 4E). To quantify FFWO, cocultures of

318

293T-ACE2 cells transfected with the plasmids encoding the alpha or the omega

319

fragment of β-galactosidase were incubated with different amounts of VLPs to induce

320

cell fusion and thus complementation (Fig. 3A). At a dose of 5000 VLPs per cell, a

321

substantial fusion signal more than one order of magnitude over background was

322

obtained (Fig. 3B). This signal increased further with increasing particle numbers,

323

reaching a plateau at 5x104 particles per cell, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.7 orders

324

of magnitude (Fig. 3B). This FFWO activity of the S protein was again strongly

325

dependent on ACE2 overexpression since no significant fusion activity was observed

326

in absence of ACE2 (Suppl. Fig. 2). When the VLPs were treated with 2 mg/mL trypsin,

327

the fusion signal increased by approximately 5.7-fold after 30 min of incubation. The

328

chosen incubation period was critical for this increase, since prolonged incubation with

329

trypsin was not beneficial (Fig. 3C). This correlated well with processing of the S0

330

protein into S2 for short trypsin exposure while prolonged digestion resulted in loss of

331

S2 (Fig. 3D).

333

Neutralization of the membrane fusion activities

334

Having established three different quantitative assays systems with an extraordinary

335

high signal-to-noise ratio, we next assessed the neutralizing capacity of an S protein

336

specific antibody, as well as convalescent sera from two donors. The sera were

337

obtained four months after diagnosis of the infection with SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Both

338

donors had experienced mild symptoms. The strongest neutralization was observed in

339

the particle entry assay. Addition of a neutralizing monoclonal anti-S antibody reduced

340

the reporter signal by 2.3 orders of magnitude, which corresponded to more than 99%

341

neutralization (Fig. 4A; Suppl. Fig. 3). Both sera reduced the reporter activity by 2.0

342

(98.5%) and 1.7 (97.4%) orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to control serum

343

(Fig. 4A; Suppl. Fig. 3). In sharp contrast, their effect on cell-cell fusion remained below

344

one order of magnitude for all three inhibitors (α-S AB: 0.4 orders (60.8%); serum 81:

345

0.5 orders (71.0%)); serum 82: 0.7 orders (79.1%)), even though the signal-to-

346

background ratio was comparable for both assays (Fig. 4B; Suppl. Fig. 3). For the

347

inhibition of FFWO, a mixed picture was obtained. The monoclonal anti-S antibody

348

decreased FFWO signal by 1.7 orders of magnitude to background level (97.9%

349

neutralization) (Fig. 4C). Titration of the antibody yielded an IC50 of 0.37 μg/mL, well

350

in line with the value determined by the vendor in pseudovirus neutralization assays

351

(0.11 μg/mL) (Fig. 4D). The effect of the patient sera was clearly less pronounced than

352

what was observed in particle entry neutralization. The strongest effect was seen with

353

serum 82 which decreased the fusion signal by 1.2 orders of magnitude (94%

354

neutralization). Serum 81, which was highly active in the entry assay had no stronger

355

effect on the fusion signal than the control serum (0.5 orders of magnitude, 72%

356

neutralization) (Fig. 4C-D). Notably, antigen amounts on SΔ19-LV particles and the

357

corresponding VLPs were similar, while a higher dose of S was used in the FFWO

358

neutralization experiment than in the particle entry neutralization experiment (Fig. 4E).

359

They exceeded the amounts of S protein present in the cell-cell fusion assay by far,

360

thus excluding higher amounts of antigen in the cell-cell fusion assay as causative for

361

this difference.

364

Discussion

365

Here we provide novel assay systems for a systematic side-by-side comparison of the

366

membrane fusion activities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S. Three quantitative

367

assays are presented, covering i) entry of LV particles pseudotyped with S, ii) fusion

368

between S and ACE2 expressing cells and iii) fusion between ACE2 expressing cells

369

via VLPs displaying S protein. All assays exhibit high signal-to-noise ratios covering

370

two to three orders of magnitude as important prerequisite to identify subtle differences,

371

e.g. when screening for the activities of inhibitors. Several studies have recently

372

published S protein based particle cell entry assays relying either on replication

373

incompetent VSV particles (Hoffmann et al., 2020b) or LV vectors similar to those used

374

here in this study. With a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of four orders of magnitude

375

the system we describe here is well among or even better than the top-performing LV-

376

based assays published so far with second (Ou et al., 2020) or simply first generation

377

LVs with their significant safety concerns (Zeng et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). It thus

378

offers improved safety, as vectors are produced without the use of helper virus or

379

separate packaging and transfer plasmids, significantly lowering the risk of replication-

380

competent virus formation. Regarding cell fusion assays, previously published studies

381

relied on nucleus counting or reporter complementation (Ou et al., 2020; Zhu et al.,

382

2020). The assay system we describe here improves upon the previously reported

383

maximum signal-to-noise ratios by at least an order of magnitude (Zhu et al., 2020).

384

The syncytia forming activity of the S protein is remarkable not only with respect to

385

speed and extent, but even more so with respect to the low amounts of S protein

386

required, even when ACE2 is not overexpressed on the target cells. The high sensitivity

387

of the assay we established here allowed the detection of cell fusion activity at levels

388

of S protein which were below the level of detection of flow cytometry and Western

389

blot. This remarkable activity is likely enabled by the high affinity of S protein for its

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.340604; this version posted October 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this

390

receptor ACE2 (Shang et al., 2020b)(Walls et al., 2020). Being well in the low

391

nanomolar range, it is even lower than that of the highly fusogenic MV for its receptors

392

(Navaratnarajah et al., 2008; Mühlebach et al., 2011).

393

To our knowledge, we here provide the first demonstration of FFWO not only for the

394

SARS-CoV-2 S protein but for any coronavirus, while FFWO has been observed for

395

other enveloped viruses entering cells by pH-independent membrane fusion, such as

396

retroviruses (Clavel and Charneau, 1994), paramyxoviruses (Bratt and Gallaher, 1969)

397

and herpesviruses (Falke et al., 1985). While it is conceivable that high concentrations

398

of virus particles may accumulate in certain organs of infected patients, clear evidence

399

for a pathogenic relevance of FFWO in patients has yet to be provided, although some

400

evidence from animal studies exists for retroviruses (Murphy and Gaulton, 2007).

401

Independently of that, the FFWO assay described here can become a prime choice for

402

the preclinical evaluation of neutralizing binders for the following reasons: First, it can

403

be performed at BSL-1 conditions, while LV-based assays require BSL-2. Second, it

404

exhibits a high signal-to-noise ratio, even exceeding the maximum ratio recently

405

reported for a benchmark LV-based neutralization assay (Zeng et al., 2020). Third, this

406

assay is unique in combining neutralization of particle-associated S protein with

407

neutralization of cell fusion, thus providing information about two mechanisms of

408

infection in a single readout.

409

Syncytia formation has recently been described as main and unique lung pathology in

410

patients affected with Covid-19 in an occurrence not seen in other lung infections

411

before. The polynucleated pneumocytes detected by histology and immunostaining

412

were virus positive and expressed spike protein (Giacca et al., 2020). Especially in

413

persistent virus infections, syncytia formation is an important mechanism of virus

414

spread as described for other important human pathogens like MV (Ferren et al., 2019)

415

or various herpesviruses (Cole and Grose, 2003). The low level of S protein sufficient

416

for cell fusion we determined here appears to be ideal to support persistence of SARS-

417

CoV-2. Evidence for SARS-CoV-2 persistence including neurological complications is

418

recently accumulating and it is particularly the persistence which appears to result in

419

fatal outcomes (Hamming et al., 2004; Berger, 2020). In this respect, it may be worrying

420

that the antibodies and convalescent sera we tested were less efficient in neutralizing

421

cell-cell fusion than particle entry, even more so since the amounts of S protein present

422

in the latter assay were substantially higher. This suggests that cell fusion is not only

423

proceeding with minimal amounts of S protein, but also difficult to access for

424

neutralizing antibodies. Further studies assessing sera from many more patients

425

including severe and fatal cases will have to be performed to investigate this

426

hypothesis further. The biological assay systems required are now available.

Figure 1: Spike mediated particle entry

581

(A) Generation of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Second generation LVs pseudotyped

582

with S protein were generated by transfection of HEK-293T cells with a packaging

583

plasmid encoding HIV-1 gag/pol, a transfer vector plasmid with a lacZ reporter gene

584

and one of two envelope plasmids encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 S with or

585

without (SΔ19) the 19 C-terminal amino acids. The C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum

586

retention signal (purple) and the receptor binding domain (RBD, orange) are indicated.

587

(B) Incorporation of S protein into LVs determined by Western blotting. S-LV and SΔ19-

588

LV particles (V) and lysates of their producer cells (C) were stained for the presence

589

of S protein (top) and p24 as particle loading control. Top blot was exposed for 30 s,

590

bottom blot for 5 s. (C) Gene transfer activities on the indicated cell lines. The indicated

591

dilutions of 5 µl vector stock of SΔ19-LV or VSV-LV were added to the cells. Cell

592

lysates were prepared three days after vector addition and lacZ reporter activity was

593

quantified as a luminescence readout. Symbols represent means of technical

594

triplicates. Grey shaded area indicates 95% CI of signals from untransduced cells

595

(blanks). (D) Effect of ACE2-overexpression on reporter transfer. 293T cells

596

transfected with ACE2 expression plasmid or mock plasmid were incubated with 0.2

597

μL of SΔ19-LV or VSV-LV. Cell lysates were prepared three days after vector addition

598

and reporter activity was quantified as a luminescence readout. Bars represent

599

geometric means of technical triplicates ±95% CIs.

Figure 2: Quantifying S protein mediated cell-cell fusion

604

(A) Principle of quantifying cell-cell fusion. Effector cells expressing S protein and the

605

α-fragment contain active β-galactosidase when they fuse with target cells expressing

606

ACE2 and the ω-fragment. (B-C) Effector cells transfected with different amounts of S-

607

protein expression plasmid (7500-7.5 ng/T75 flask) were assessed for S protein

608

expression by flow cytometry (B) and then applied in the fusion assay (C). (B) Mean

609

fluorescence intensity (MFI, orange bars) and the percentage of S-positive cells (yellow

610

bars) were determined in flow cytometry. Bars represent means ± 95% CIs, n=3. P-

611

values are from one-way ANOVA. (C) Activities of β-galactosidase in cocultures of

612

effector and target cells in absence of ACE2 overexpression. Effector cells were

613

transfected with the indicated amounts of S protein encoding plasmid, detached with

614

trypsin and cultivated for the indicated time periods with target cells which were

615

transfected with the ω-fragment encoding plasmid only. Bars represent means ± 95%

616

CIs, n=3. (D) Influence of proteolytic processing and ACE2 overexpression on cell

617

fusion activity. Left panel: Effector cells were detached without trypsin using 5 mM

618

EDTA in PBS. Right panel: Target cells were co-transfected with the ω-fragment and

619

ACE2 encoding plasmids. Bars represent means ± 95% CIs, n=3.

Figure 3: S protein mediated fusion-from-without

623

(A) Principle of the assay. HIV-1 derived SΔ19-VLPs were added as effector triggering

624

fusion from without (FFWO) of cocultures of ACE2 overexpressing HEK-293T cells

625

transfected with plasmids encoding the α-fragment or the ω-fragment of β-

626

galactosidase. Cocultures were lysed and galactosidase activity of the lysates

627

determined in luminescence reactions. (B) The indicated numbers of SΔ19-VLPs or

628

bald VLP, produced without the S protein, were added to the coculture. Activities were

629

quantified after overnight incubation. Bars represent means ± 95% CIs, n=4. (C-D)

630

Effect of proteolytic processing on the induction of FFWO. 5x108 SΔ19-VLPs, bald

631

VLPs or no VLPs were incubated in 2 mg/mL trypsin for the indicated time periods

632

before addition to cocultures (105 cells). Luminescence was quantified after overnight

633

cultivation. (C). Bars represent means of technical triplicates ± 95% CIs. (D)

Figure 4: Antibody mediated neutralization of membrane fusion

639

The neutralizing activities of an S-protein specific antibody and sera from two

640

convalescent Covid-19 patients were determined against S-protein mediated particle

641

entry (A), cell-cell fusion (B) and FFWO (C-D). Bars represent means, n=3. P-values

642

are from two-way (A, C) or one-way (B) ANOVA. (A) 0.2 μL of SΔ19-LV or VSV-LV

643

were incubated for 30 min with the indicated antibodies or sera before being added to

644

HEK-293T cells transfected with ACE2 expression plasmid. Cell lysates were prepared

645

3 days after vector addition and reporter activity was quantified as luminescence

646

readout. (B) Effector cells coexpressing S protein (7.5 ng S plasmid per T75) and the

647

α-fragment were incubated for 30 min with antibodies or sera before being added to

648

target cells cotransfected with ω-fragment and ACE2 expression plasmids Bars

649

represent means, n=3. (C) 5x108 SΔ19-VLPs or bald VLPs were incubated for 30 min

650

with antibodies or sera before being added to the cocultures of α/ACE2 and ω/ACE2

651

cells. Luminescence was quantified after overnight incubation. Select multiplicity-

652

adjusted p-values are reported. (D) Neutralizing capacity of the indicated dilutions of

653

antibodies and sera on FFWO. Dilution factors apply to pure serum 80 μg/mL for the

654

antibodies. (E) Semi-quantitative Western blots comparing S protein dose applied to

655

the three fusion assays as SΔ19-VLPs, SΔ19-LV particles and effector cells. 2.5x105

656

effector cells transfected with 750 - 7.5 ng/T75 of S protein encoding plasmid were

657

compared with three-fold dilutions of the particles starting with 2.5x109 VLPs or 3 µL of

658

LVs. Samples corresponding to the material used in the neutralization experiments are

659

marked with arrowheads.
