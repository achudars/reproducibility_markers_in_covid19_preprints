Abstract
One of the features distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from its more pathogenic
counterpart SARS-CoV is the presence of premature stop codons in its ORF3b gene.
Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist,
suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV
ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays revealed that SARS-CoV-2related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene
products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of more than
15,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified a natural variant, in which a longer
ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted. This variant was isolated from two patients
with severe disease and further increased the ability of ORF3b to suppress interferon
induction. Thus, our findings not only help to explain the poor interferon response in
COVID-19 patients, but also describe a possibility of the emergence of natural
SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with extended ORF3b that may exacerbate COVID-19
symptoms.

Highlights
l ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 and related bat and pangolin viruses is a potent IFN
antagonist
l SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b suppresses IFN induction more efficiently than SARS-CoV
ortholog
l The anti-IFN activity of ORF3b depends on the length of its C-terminus

Introduction
In December 2019, an unusual outbreak of infectious pneumonia was reported in
the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China. A few weeks later, a novel coronavirus (CoV) was
identified as the causative agent and the disease was termed coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) (Zhou et al., 2020). Since this novel virus is phylogenetically
related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV (SARS-CoV), it was
named SARS-CoV-2. As of May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 causes an ongoing pandemic,
with more than 4 million reported cases and more than 280,000 deaths worldwide
(WHO, 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic or result in flu-like symptoms
such as fever, cough and fatigue (Chen et al., 2020). In some cases, however,
COVID-19 progresses to severe pneumonia and death (Guan et al., 2020; Hui et al.,
2020; Li et al., 2020). Although it is still challenging to assess the morbidity rate of
COVID-19, estimates range from 1.4 to 1.9% in China (Guan et al., 2020; Verity et
al., 2020). This is substantially lower than the morbidity rate of SARS-CoV, which is
about 9.6% (WHO, 2004). SARS-CoV, which frequently causes severe respiratory
symptoms including fatal pneumonia, first emerged in Guangdong, China in 2002
and was stamped out in 2004 [reviewed in (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003; Weiss,
2020)]. Until then, 8,096 cases of SARS were reported in 29 countries and territories,
and 774 people died (WHO, 2004). Thus, SARS-CoV is more virulent than SARSCoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are phylogenetically closely related, both
belonging to the family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus and subgenus
Sarbecovirus (Lam et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Both viruses were transmitted
from animals to humans. Thus, elucidating their zoonotic origin and phylogenetic
history may help to understand genetic and phenotypic differences between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2. Viruses closely related to SARS-CoV were detected in
Chinese rufous horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al.,
2005) and palm civets (Paguma larvata) (Wang et al., 2005). Subsequent
surveillance studies have identified additional clades of SARS-CoV-related viruses
in various bat species (mainly of the genus Rhinolophus) (Ge et al., 2013; He et al.,
2014; Hu et al., 2017a; Lau et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2006; Wang et
al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2010), suggesting that zoonotic coronavirus
transmission from horseshoe bats to humans led to the emergence of SARS-CoV.
Similarly, SARS-CoV-2-related viruses were identified in intermediate horseshoe
bats (Rhinolophus affinis) (Zhou et al., 2020), the Malayan horseshoe bat
(Rhinolophus malayanus) and Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) (Lam et al.,
2020; Xiao et al., 2020). Although it has been suggested that the SARS-CoV-2

outbreak has originated from cross-species coronavirus transmission from these
mammals to humans, the exact origin remains to be determined (Andersen et al.,
2020).
One prominent feature that distinguishes COVID-19 from SARS in terms of
immune responses is the poor induction of a type I interferon (IFN-I) response by
SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and influenza A virus (IAV) (Blanco-Melo et
al., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020). Notably, impaired IFN-I responses are associated
with COVID-19 disease (Hadjadj et al., 2020). However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the inefficient IFN-I responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear.
In this study, we therefore aimed to characterize the viral factor(s) determining
immune activation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We particularly focused on
differences in putative viral IFN-I antagonists and revealed that the ORF3b gene
products of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV not only differ considerably in their length,
but also in their ability to antagonize type I IFN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the potent anti-IFN-I activity of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is also found in related viruses
from bats and pangolins. Mutational analyses revealed that the length of the Cterminus determines the efficacy of IFN antagonism by ORF3b. Finally, we describe
a natural SARS-CoV-2 variant with further increased ORF3b-mediated anti-IFN-I
activity that emerged during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent IFN-I antagonist
To determine virological differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we set
out to compare the sequences of diverse Sarbecoviruses. Consistent with recent
reports (Lam et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), Sarbecoviruses clustered into two
groups, SARS-CoV-2-related and SARS-CoV-related viruses (Figure 1A). A
comparison of individual viral open reading frames (ORFs) revealed that the length
of ORF3b is clearly different between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV lineages, while
the lengths of all remaining ORFs are relatively constant among Sarbecoviruses
(Figure 1B). More specifically, the ORF3b sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and related
viruses in bats and pangolins are only 22 amino acids (66 bp) long and therefore
considerably shorter than those of their SARS-CoV orthologs (153.2 ± 0.47 amino
acids on average).
Previous studies on SARS-CoV and related viruses demonstrated that at
least two accessory proteins, ORF3b and ORF6, as well as the nucleocapsid (N,
also known as ORF9a) have the ability to inhibit IFN-I production (Frieman et al.,
2007; Hu et al., 2017b; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2012). Since the
ORF3b length was remarkably different between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
(Figure 1B), we hypothesized that the antagonistic activity of ORF3b against IFN-I
differs between these two viruses. To test this hypothesis, we monitored human
IFNB1 promoter activity in the presence of ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1)
and SARS-CoV (Tor2) using a luciferase reporter assay. The influenza A virus (IAV)
non-structural protein 1 (NS1) served as positive control (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998;
Krug et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 1C, all three viral proteins dose-dependently
suppressed the activation of the IFNB1 promoter upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection.
Notably, the antagonistic activity of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b was slightly, but
significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV ORF3b (Figure 1C, bottom). Thus, our
data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent inhibitor for human IFN-I
activation, even though it only comprises 22 amino acids.
SARS-CoV-2-related ORF3b proteins from bat and pangolin viruses suppress
IFN-I activation on average more efficiently than their SARS-CoV counterparts
Since the lengths of ORF3b proteins in SARS-CoV-2-related viruses including those
from bats and pangolins were on average shorter than those from SARS-CoV and
related viruses (Figure 1B), we next investigated whether they were also generally
more efficient in antagonizing IFN-I. A phylogenetic analysis of Sarbecovirus ORF3b
genes showed that the evolutionary relationship of Sarbecovirus ORF3b genes was
similar to that of the full-length viral genomes (Figures 1A and 2A). For our

functional analyses, we generated expression plasmids for ORF3b from SARS-CoV2-related viruses from bats (RmYN02, RaTG13 and ZXC21) and a pangolin (P4L),
as well as SARS-CoV-related viruses from a civet (civet007) and bats (Rs7327,
Rs4231, YN2013 and Rm1), representing different lengths of this protein (Figure
2B). As shown in Figure 2C, all four SARS-CoV-2-related ORF3b significantly
suppressed human IFN-I activation. In contrast, only two SARS-CoV-related ORF3b
proteins, Rs4231 and Rm1, exhibited anti-IFN-I activity at the concentrations tested
(Figure 2C). Intriguingly, these two SARS-CoV-related ORF3b proteins are Cterminally truncated and shorter than ORF3b of SARS-CoV Tor2 (Figure 2A). These
findings suggest that the C-terminal region (residues 115-154) may attenuate the
anti-IFN-I activity of ORF3b. To test this hypothesis, we generated a C-terminally
truncated derivatives of SARS-CoV (Tor2) ORF3b harboring a premature stop codon
at position 135. The K135* mutant mimics the ORF3b of Rs4231 (Figure 2B).
Reporter assays revealed that this derivative exhibits higher anti-IFN-I activity than
wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV ORF3b (Figure 2D), demonstrating that the C-terminal
region of SARS-CoV ORF3b indeed attenuates its anti-IFN-I activity.
A SARS-CoV ORF3b-like sequence is hidden in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 is shorter than its ortholog in SARS-CoV (Figures 1B and
2A). However, when closely inspecting the nucleotide sequences of these two
viruses, we noticed that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequence downstream of the
stop codon of ORF3b shows a high similarity to the SARS-CoV ORF3b gene
(nucleotide similarity=79.5%; Figure 3A). In contrast to SARS-CoV ORF3b, however,
SARS-CoV-2 harbors four premature stop codons that result in the expression of a
drastically shortened ORF3b protein (Figure 3A). Similar patterns were observed in
SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins. Since the ORF3b length is
closely associated with its anti-IFN-I activity (Figures 2C and 2D), we hypothesized
that reversion of the premature stop codons in SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b affects its ability
to inhibit human IFN-I. To address this possibility, we generated four SARS-CoV-2
ORF3b derivatives, 57*, 79*, 119* and 155*, lacking the respective premature stop
codons (Figure 3B, top). As shown in Figure 3C, all four derivatives inhibited human
IFN-I activation in dose-dependent manners. Consistent with the results obtained
with SARS-CoV ORF3b mutants (Figure 2D), the 155* mutant, comprising the very
C-terminal region (positions 119-154), was poorly expressed and exhibited relatively
low anti-IFN-I activity (Figure 3C). Notably, however, we found that the extended
ORF3b derivatives, particularly 57*, 79*, 119*, exhibited higher anti-IFN-I activity
compared to WT ORF3b (Figure 3C). These findings confirm that the length of
ORF3b determines its ability to suppress an IFN-I response. Furthermore, they show

that the loss of authentic ORF3b stop codon during the current SARS-CoV-2
pandemic may result in the emergence of viral variants with enhanced IFN-Iantagonistic activity.
Characterization of a natural SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b variant with enhanced antiIFN-I activity
By screening >15,000 viral sequences deposited in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org;
as of 22 April, 2020) using the CoV-GLUE webtool (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk), we
detected two viral sequences (accession IDs: EPI_ISL_422564 and
EPI_ISL_422565), in which the ORF3b gene was extended due to the loss of the
first premature stop codon (*23Q) (Figure 3B, bottom). The similarity of the fulllength sequences of these two viruses, which were collected from COVID-19
patients in Ecuador, were >99.6%, and the ORF3b sequences were identical. Apart
from the *23Q mutation, the “Ecuador variant” also harbored an L24M change
compared to the SARS-CoV ORF3b-like sequence in SARS-CoV-2 [Wuhan-Hu-1
(accession no. NC_045512.2), nucleotides 25814-26281] (Figure 3B, bottom).
IFNβ reporter assays revealed that the “Ecuador variant” ORF3b exhibits
significantly higher anti-IFN-I activity than the parental SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b (Figure
3D). These findings show that a naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variant, expressing
an elongated ORF3b protein with enhanced anti-IFN activity, has already emerged
during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent antagonist of human
IFN-I activation. On average, ORF3b proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and related bat and
pangolin viruses were more active than their SARS-CoV counterparts. Notably, a
recent study has revealed that the antibodies recognizing ORF3b are highly
detectable during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hachim et al., 2020),
which suggests that ORF3b is one of the viral proteins dominantly expressed in the
COVID-19 patients during acute infection. Therefore, our findings may help to
explain the inefficient and delayed IFN-I responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells as
well as COVID-19 patients (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Moreover, a recent study
showed that impaired IFN-I responses as well as reduced IFN-stimulated gene
expression are associated with severe COVID-19 disease (Hadjadj et al., 2020). This
suggests that imbalanced IFN-I responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection may
determine its pathogenicity and explain differences compared to SARS-CoV. Thus,
it is tempting to speculate that atypical symptoms and poor IFN-I responses in
SARS-CoV-2 infection may be attributed to the potent anti IFN-I activity of its ORF3b.
Like SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b, its orthologs in SARS-CoV-2-related viruses
from bats and pangolins efficiently antagonize IFN-I and are generally truncated due
to the presence of several premature stop codons. In contrast, the anti-IFN activity
of ORF3b proteins encoded by some SARS-CoV-related viruses is attenuated, most
likely due to an elongated C-terminus. We hypothesized that the ORF3b length
variation in SARS-CoV-like viruses may be the result of recombination events. In line
with this, Sarbecoviruses seem to easily recombine with each other (Andersen et al.,
2020; Lam et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), and some horseshoe bat species such
as Rhinolophus affinis and Rhinolophus sinicus are known to harbor both SARSCoV-2- and SARS-CoV-related viruses (Andersen et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).
Nevertheless, the phylogenetic topologies of the full-length viral genome and the
ORF3b gene are similar, and we found no evidence for recombination of ORF3b
between the lineages of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Notably, phenotypic
differences in the ability of ORF3b to suppress IFN-I responses may also be
associated with the likelihood of successful zoonotic transmission of Sarbecoviruses
to humans since many IFN-stimulated genes are antagonized in a species-specific
manner. While more than 50 SARS-CoV-related viruses were isolated from bats (Ge
et al., 2013; He et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2017a; Lau et al., 2010; Lau et al., 2005; Li et
al., 2005; Lin et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016; Yuan
et al., 2010), only eight viral sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 lineage were
detected so far (Andersen et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Zhou et
al., 2020). Thus, further investigations are needed to elucidate the dynamics of

cross-species transmission events of Sarbecoviruses and the evolution of the
ORF3b gene.
We further show that a SARS-CoV ORF3b-like sequence is still present in
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, but is interrupted by premature stop codons. We
demonstrate that a partial extension of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b by reverting stop
codons increases its inhibitory activity against human IFN-I. Full reversion of all stop
codons, however, resulted in an ORF3b protein with poor anti-IFN activity. This is in
line with the phenotypic difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV ORF3b
proteins and suggests that the very C-terminus of ORF3b impairs its immune
evasion activity.
Intriguingly, we also identified a naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b
variant that expresses an elongated protein due to the loss of the first premature
stop codon. This variant suppresses IFN-I even more efficiently than ORF3b of the
SARS-CoV-2 reference strain. In agreement with an association of IFN suppression
with disease severity (Hadjadj et al., 2020), the two patients in Ecuador harboring
SARS-CoV-2 with the extended ORF3b variant were critically ill; one (accession ID:
EPI_ISL_422564) was treated in an intensive care unit and the other (accession ID:
EPI_ISL_422565) died of COVID-19 (unpublished information from Dr. Paúl
Cárdenas, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Quito, Ecuador). There are no direct
evidence indicating that the viruses detected in these two COVID-19 patients in
Ecuador are highly pathogenic. However, based on our experimental results, it might
be plausible to assume that naturally occurring length variants of ORF3b may occur
due to the loss of premature stop codons and potentially contribute to the emergence
of highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies. Our findings can be a clue to
monitor the possibility of the emergence of highly pathogenic viruses during current
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
HEK293 cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line; ATCC CRL-1573) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing fetal
calf serum and antibiotics.
Viral Genomes and Phylogenetic Analyses
All viral genome sequences used in this study and the respective GenBank or
GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) accession numbers are summarized in Table S1.
We first aligned the viral genomes using the L-INS-i program of MAFFT version
7.453 (Katoh and Standley, 2013). Based on the multiple sequence alignment and
the gene annotation of SARS-CoV, we extracted the region of the ORF3b gene. We
then constructed phylogenetic trees using the full-length genomes (Figures 1A and
S1) and ORF3b gene (Figure 2A). We generated a maximum likelihood based
phylogenetic tree using RAxML-NG (Kozlov et al., 2019) with a General Time
Reversible model of nucleotide substitution with invariant sites and gamma
distributed rate variation among sites. We visualized the tree using a FigTree
software (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).
Plasmid Construction
To construct the expression plasmids for HA-tagged Sarbecovirus ORF3b and IAV
A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1 PR8; accession no. EF467817.1) NS1, pCAGGS (Niwa
et al., 1991) was used as a backbone. The HA-tagged ORF of each gene (the
accession numbers and sequences are listed in Table S2) and the cryptic SARSCoV ORF3b-like sequence in SARS-CoV-2 [Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession no.
NC_045512.2), nucleotides 25814-26281) was synthesized by a gene synthesis
service (Fasmac). The ORF3b derivatives were generated by PCR using
PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara), the synthesized ORFs as templates,
and the primers listed in Table S3. The HA-tagged “Ecuador variant” ORF3b
(accession IDs: EPI_ISL_422564 and EPI_ISL_422565, which corresponds to the
S23Q/L24M mutant of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 ORF3b *57) was generated by
overlap extension PCR by using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara), the
SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b 155* as the template, and the primers listed in Table S3. The
obtained DNA fragments were inserted into pCAGGS via EcoRI-BglII or XhoI-BglII.
Nucleotide sequences were determined by a DNA sequencing service (Fasmac),
and the sequence data were analyzed by Sequencher v5.1 software (Gene Codes
Corporation).

Transfection, SeV Infection and Reporter Assay
HEK293 cells were transfected using PEI Max (Polysciences) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For luciferase reporter assay, cells were cotransfected with
500 ng of p125Luc (expressing firefly luciferase driven by human IFNB1 promoter;
kindly provided by Dr. Takashi Fujita) (Fujita et al., 1993) and the pCAGGS-based
HA-tagged expression plasmid (the amounts are indicated in the figure legends). At
24 h posttransfection, SeV (strain Cantell, clone cCdi; accession no. AB855654)
(Yoshida et al., 2018) was inoculated into the transfected cells at multiplicity of
infection (MOI) 10. The luciferase reporter assay was performed as described
(Kobayashi et al., 2014; Konno et al., 2018; Ueda et al., 2017). Briefly, 50 μl of cell
lysate was applied to a 96-well plate (Nunc), and the firefly luciferase activity was
measured using a BrillianStar-LT assay system (Toyo-b-net), and the input for the
luciferase assay was normalized by using a CellTiter-Glo 2.0 assay kit (Promega)
following the manufacturers’ instructions. For this assay, a 2030 ARVO X multilabel
counter instrument (PerkinElmer) was used.
Western Blotting
Western blotting was performed as described (Kobayashi et al., 2014; Konno et al.,
2018; Nakano et al., 2017; Yamada et al., 2018) using an HRP-conjugated anti-HA
rat monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10; Roche) and an anti-alpha-tubulin (TUBA)
mouse monoclonal antibody (clone DM1A; Sigma-Aldrich). Transfected cells were
lysed with RIPA buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 μM
ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche).
CoV-GLUE
To survey the ORF3b derivatives in pandemic SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we used
the 15,605 viral sequences deposited in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) (accessed
22 April, 2020). The screening was performed using the CoV-GLUE platform
(http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk) developed by MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for
Virus Research, Scotland, UK (accessed 22 April, 2020). Using CoV-GLUE, we
detected the two SARS-CoV-2 sequences (accession IDs: EPI_ISL_422564 and
EPI_ISL_422565, collected in Ecuador) possessing the V163T/T164N substitutions
in ORF3a, which correspond to the *23Q/L24M/57* substitutions in ORF3b.
Statistical Analysis
Data analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). The data are
presented as averages ± SEM. Statistically significant differences were determined

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent IFN-I antagonist
(A) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of full-length Sarbecovirus sequences.
The full-length sequences (~30,000 bp) of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1 as a
representative), SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats (n=4) and pangolins (n=4),
SARS-CoV (n=190), SARS-CoV-related viruses from civets (n=3) and bats (n=54),
and outgroup viruses (n=2; BM48-31 and BtKY72) were analyzed. Accession
number, strain name, and host of each virus are indicated for each branch. Note that
the branches including SARS-CoV (n=190) and SARS-CoV-related viruses from
civets (n=3) were collapsed for better visualization. The uncollapsed tree is shown
in Figure S1, and the sequences used are summarized in Table S1. Asterisks
indicate bootstrap values >95%. A scale bar indicates 0.1 nucleotide substitutions
per site. NA, not applicable.
