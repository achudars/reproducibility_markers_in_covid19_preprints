Pooling nasopharyngeal swab specimens to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2
Cole Anderson1, Fritz Castillo1, Michael Koenig1, Jim Managbanag1

10

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a global pandemic of unprecedented

11

proportions. Current diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-

12

PCR in upper and lower respiratory specimens. While sensitive and specific, these RT-PCR

13

assays require considerable supplies and reagents, which are often limited during global

14

pandemics and surge testing. Here, we show that a nasopharyngeal swab pooling strategy can

15

detect a single positive sample in pools of up to 10 samples without sacrificing RT-PCR

16

sensitivity and specificity. We also report that this pooling strategy can be applied to rapid,

17

moderate complexity assays, such as the BioFire COVID-19 test. Implementing a pooling

18

strategy can significantly increase laboratory testing capacity while simultaneously reducing

19

turnaround times for rapid identification and isolation of positive COVID-19 cases in high risk

20

populations.

Introduction:

23

In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with unknown origin began in Wuhan city, the

24

capital of Hubei province in China1. The following month, Chinese researchers had isolated a

25

novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from

26

patients with viral pneumonia2. Pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 was later designated

27

as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization in February 20203.

28

It was determined that after a zoonotic transmission event in Wuhan city4, widespread person-

29

to-person transmission quickly occurred that led to the infection and death of over 80,000 and

30

3,000 people in China, respectively. To date, according to the WHO, there have been 4,258,666

31

reported cases of COVID-19, including 294,190 deaths worldwide5.

32

Since the initial outbreak in China, COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic affecting at

33

least 216 other countries, territories or areas. To monitor and diagnose COVID-19, the US Food

34

and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the CDC

35

2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel on February 4, 20206. This protocol allows for

36

the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens such as, nasopharyngeal and

37

oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal aspirates. As evidenced by

38

the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, increased demand for testing can overwhelm diagnostic

39

laboratories and lead to drastic shortages in supplies and reagents. A strategy to overcome

40

high testing demand is to pool specimens before RNA extraction, test pools, and then retest

41

individual specimens from positive pools. Similar strategies have shown to increase testing

42

capacity for the detection of common infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV, Hepatitis, and

43

Chlamydia trachomatis7–11.

44

In this study, we examined the feasibility of pooling nasopharyngeal swab specimens submitted

45

for COVID-19 testing using the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR diagnostic panel without compromising

46

clinical sensitivity. Our data shows that pooling respiratory samples during times of increased

volume and low disease prevalence can save time and reagents without significant

48

modifications to laboratory infrastructure or workflow.

Methods:

51

This study was determined to meet the exempt criteria listed in 32CFR219.104(d) from the

52

Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Exempt Determination Official.

53

During an outbreak cluster of SARS-CoV-2 in Stuttgart, Germany, 494 nasopharyngeal (NP)

54

swabs were collected and placed into 1.0 ml of normal saline. Specimens were submitted to

55

the Virology laboratory at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center for routine SARS-CoV-2 testing

56

using the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay. Post clinical testing, specimens were de-identified and

57

randomly assigned into pools of 10 to create 50 distinct pools (the 50th pool contained 4

58

specimens diluted in 0.6 ml of transport media). Pools were created by combining 100 ul of

59

each specimen to create 1.0 ml pools. Viral transport media was added to each pool at a 1:1

60

ratio for nucleic acid extraction performed on the Roche MagNA Pure 24 platform using the

61

MagNA Pure 24 Total NA Isolation kit (Roche). Elution volume was set to 50 ul to concentrate

62

viral RNA. Each round of extraction contained a human specimen control to monitor for PCR

63

inhibition and specimen quality.

64

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using the CDC RT-PCR COVID-19 assay, which contains

65

primers and Taqman probes for two specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene

66

and the human Rnase-P (RP) gene, which is used as an internal positive control for human

67

nucleic acid. PCR was performed according to the CDC protocol using the TaqPath 1-Step RT-

68

qPCR Master Mix, CG kit (Life Technologies) on the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 Fast real-

69

time PCR system. PCR results were interpreted as recommended in the CDC RT-PCR COVID-19

70

instructions for use. A pool was considered positive if the CT was less than 40. Detection of

71

SARS-CoV-2 in pooled samples using the BioFire COVID-19 Test was performed according to the

72

manufacturer’s instructions for use on the BioFire FilmArray 2.0 and FilmArray Torch systems.

73

All statistical analyses were conducted using Graphpad Prism 6.0.

74
75

Results:

76

The prevalence for individual clinical samples was 4% (19/494) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among the

77

pooled samples, 30% (15/50) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, while the remaining 70%

78

(35/50) did not have detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Table 1). We observed one

79

inconclusive RT-PCR result in our pooled analysis as defined by amplification of only a single

80

SARS-CoV-2 target. In this case, the N2 target for pool 41 failed to amplify while N1 was

81

detected with a relatively high CT (37.3). There were no invalid reactions in our analysis, as

82

defined by reactions where Rnase-P failed to amplify. Out of the 15 positive pools, 4 pools

83

contained 2 positive specimens, while the remaining 11 pools contained only 1 positive

84

specimen (Table 2). The mean CT value and standard deviation for N1 and N2 of the pools were

85

29.2 (4.4) and 29.4 (4.3), respectively. Similarly, the mean CT values of individual positive

86

specimens were 28.0 (4.5) and 29.9 (4.8) for N1 and N2, respectively. Despite dilution, there

87

was no significant difference in mean CT value between the pooled and individually tested

88

specimens (Figure 1).

89

To determine if a pooling approach is feasible with rapid, moderate complexity tests, we tested

90

the 15 SARS-CoV-2 positive pools and 15 of the SARS-CoV-2 negative pools using the recently

released BioFire COVID-19 Test. The BioFire COVID-19 test is a nested multiplexed RT-PCR test

92

that automates all aspects of nucleic acid testing including sample preparation, extraction, and

93

PCR, and which can detect SARS-CoV-2 within a single nasopharyngeal swab specimen in under

94

60 minutes. As expected, there was perfect agreement between the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR

95

and BioFire COVID-19 assays (kappa=1.0). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all 15 positive

96

pools, whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in all 15 of the negative pools using the

97

BioFire COVID-19 Test (Table 3).

98
99

Discussion:

100

We found that a single NP swab specimen containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be consistently

101

detected in a pool of 10 samples. Our data shows an estimated false negative rate of

102

approximately 7% (1 out of 15), although this pool was inconclusive (the N2 primer failed to

103

amplify) and was treated as a positive pool. Unlike other pooling strategies that pool purified

104

RNA extracts12,13, our method utilized pooling clinical specimens prior to RNA extraction, which

105

removes the extraction bottleneck and allows running an endogenous internal control to

106

monitor extraction quality.

107

A linear increase in threshold cycle is expected as specimens are pooled, however, we did not

108

observe a significant change in CT values for either primer pair in our pooled samples. Given

109

that PCR efficiency of each primer pair can differ, any inconclusive result for a pool should be

110

treated as positive and individually tested. Case in point, the only inconclusive result in our

111

study was found in pool 41, where the N2 target failed to amplify. This pool contained 2

112

positive specimens and one inconclusive specimen. This suggests there may have been PCR

113

inhibitors present in the individual sample that carried over to the pooled specimen resulting in

114

an inconclusive result. Both positive specimens in pool 41 had relatively high CT values. In our

115

lab, specimens with high CT values are commonly observed in convalescent patients 14-30 days

116

after symptomatic infection, and do risk escaping detection when combined in larger pools due

117

to loss of sensitivity. It should also be noted that a negative pool result would not differentiate

118

between a true negative and an inconclusive or invalid result due to improper sample collection

119

or storage. Given the clinical performance of this and other published pooling protocols7,12,13, it

120

is possible that larger pools could be used with further RT-PCR optimization to allow lower

121

detection limits for low-concentration RNA.

122

Disease prevalence should also be taken into consideration when implementing a pooling

123

strategy. Recently, Noriega and Samore used a Bayesian modeling approach to show testing

124

throughput more than doubles when prevalence rates are ≤8%, and this occurs with optimal

125

pool sizes between 4 and 12 samples. Conversely, as prevalence increases, they show

126

improvements in testing throughput diminishes significantly14. During this surveillance period,

127

SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was determined to be approximately 4% (19/494), which is ideal for

128

pool sizes of 10. In this study, we found that 30% (15/50) pools were positive for SARS-CoV-2,

129

which equates to 200 individual extractions and RT-PCR reactions (50 pools and 150

130

individuals), representing a 60% savings in extractions and RT-PCR reactions, which is significant

131

during times of surge testing and in limited-resource situations.

132

Recently, numerous rapid molecular diagnostic platforms have received an Emergency Use

133

Authorization from the FDA. These include low to moderate complexity assays from BioFire,

134

Cepheid, and Abbott that can detect SARS-CoV-2 in approximately 1 hour15,16. Using the

135

recently released BioFire COVID-19 Test, we found that this platform could reliably detect a

136

single positive sample in pools of up to 10 specimens, with equal rates of detection as the CDC

137

COVID-19 RT-PCR assay. This is not surprising given the published limits of detection for the

138

CDC COVID-19 RT-PCR and BioFire COVID-19 test are in the range of 102 RNA copies/ml. These

139

results support the use of rapid molecular diagnostic platforms for routine disease surveillance

140

of critical working groups such as healthcare providers and military units, where large-scale

141

quarantines can have grave consequences.

142

In summary, we show that a pooled-sample strategy can augment a laboratory’s testing

143

capability and relieve extreme pressure from limited resource situations without sacrificing RT-

144

PCR sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, a pooling strategy can reduce turnaround times for

145

prompt identification and isolation of infected individuals to effectively curb the transmission of

146

COVID-19 and other infectious disease outbreaks.
