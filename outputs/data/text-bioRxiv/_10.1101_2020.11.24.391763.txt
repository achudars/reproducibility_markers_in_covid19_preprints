Abstract: In 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2/nCoV-19, emerged in Wuhan, China, and
has been responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. The evolutionary origins of the virus
remain elusive and understanding its complex mutational signatures could guide vaccine design and
development. As part of the international “CoronaHack” in April 2020 (https://www.coronahack.co.
uk/), we employed a collection of contemporary methodologies to compare the genomic sequences
of coronaviruses isolated from human (SARS-CoV-2;n=163), bat (bat-CoV;n=215) and pangolin
(pangolin-CoV;n=7) available in public repositories. Following de novo gene annotation prediction,
analyses of gene-gene similarity network, codon usage bias and variant discovery were undertaken.
Strong host-associated divergences were noted in ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and S, and in
codon usage bias profiles. Lastly, we have characterised several high impact variants (inframe
insertion/deletion or stop gain) in bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV populations, some of which are found
in the same amino acid position and may be highlighting loci of potential functional relevance.

1. Background
The continued and increasing occurrence of pandemics that threaten worldwide public health
due to human activity is considered to be inevitable [1,2]. The COVID-19 (2019-current) pandemic
caused by the emergence in Hubei, China, of what has now been identified as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2/ Novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) by The Coronaviridae
Study Group [3], has brought a number of questions regarding its transmission, containment and
treatment to the urgent attention of researchers and clinicians. The urgency of such questions has
spurred a number of atypical approaches and collaborations between experts of different fields and as
such, this study was carried out as part of a “CoronaHack” hackathon event in April 2020 where the
authors gained access to genomes and related metadata available at the time (Dec 2019 - April 2020).
Viruses of the Coronaviridae family have long been studied and while there have been great
advances in our understanding, each new emergence has brought about its own questions The
sub-family Coronavirus consists of four genera, Alphacoronavirus (Alpha-CoV), Betacoronavirus
(Beta-CoV), Gammacoronavirus and DeltaCoronavirus. Coronaviruses are a family of single-stranded,
enveloped and extremely diverse RNA viruses which have come into contact with humans numerous
times over the past few decades alone [4]. At around 30kb, they exhibit at least six Open Reading
Frames (ORFs), ORF1a/b comprising of approximately 2/3 of the genome which encodes up to

16 non-structural replicase proteins through ribosomal frame-shifting, and four structural proteins:
membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E) and spike (S) glycoprotein [5]. Coronaviruses have
developed a number of different strategies to infiltrate their host-cells. In human-associated CoVs, it
has been shown that different parts of the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) can be
bound to by their respective S proteins. Pathogens such as SARS-CoV-1 (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) have
shown Coronaviruses to be capable of presumed efficient adaptation to their human host and exhibit
high levels of pathogenicity [6,7]. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, which along with SARS-CoV-2
are both Beta-CoVs, exhibit only 79.5% and 50% sequence similarity at the whole genome level
to SARS-CoV-2, whereas SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses found in pangolins (pangolin-CoVs) and
bat coronavirus (bat-CoV) SARSr-Ra-BatCoV-RaTG13 (RaTG13) are 91.02% and 96% respectively
[8]. The relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to other SARS-like coronaviruses, the possible role of bats and
pangolins as reservoir species and the role of recombination in its emergence, are of great interest
[9]. Speculations around other intermediary hosts are also at play, which might have affected the
ability for zoonotic transmission for SARS-CoV-2 to its human host [10]. Crucially, this evolutionary
relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and its lineage may prove to be an important factor in the eventual
management or containment of the virus. Moreover, the mutation events along the evolutionary
timeline of SARS-CoV-2 are of importance in the discovery of possible adaption signatures within the
viral population. At the time of the hackathon, there were two main suspected SARS-like reservoir
host species; bat and pangolin (named bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV) .
With this in mind, our study aimed to systematically compare a broad selection of contemporary
available SARS-CoV-2, bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV at genome, gene, codon usage and variant levels,
without preference for strains or sub-genera. This was comprised of 46 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated
early in the pandemic from Wuhan, China (Late 2019-Early 2020), 117 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated
in Germany, representing the later stage of global transmission, 215 bat-CoV genomes of Alpha-CoVs
and Beta-CoVs and 7 pangolin-CoV genomes, of which 5 were annotated as Beta-CoVs. During the
hackathon, it was recognised that potential biases can arise from directly comparing SARS-CoV-2 to a
wide repertoire of coronaviruses of varying stages of genome annotation. Therefore, we performed
a new comparative annotation of all genomes used in this study. To further validate mutational
adaptations which may have facilitated the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, a codon usage
analyse was carried out between the SARS-CoV-2 reference genes and the genes identified using the
abovementioned approaches.
In addition, we profiled codon usage bias across our dataset, as in the process of host adaptation,
viruses can evolve to express different preferential codon usages [11–13]
Through examining the inherent sequence diversity between a comprehensive collection of
SARS-CoV-2, bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV, we aimed to highlight naturally occurring high impact
variations that can potentially introduce a moderate change in the resulting protein, such as the
insertion or deletion of an amino acid or early termination of the sequence. Understanding the stability
and variability of these positions may potentially aid future design of vaccines or treatments. For
instance, an amino acid position where insertion or deletion is commonly found in a coronavirus
affecting other species may indicate that its alteration does not have a dramatic impact on the overall
protein folding, or that the position is important for transmission to a new host.
Our work is differentiated by the way a systematic approach was used to process a non-selective
group of these viral genomes from public repositories, prior to applying a wide range of contemporary
methodologies and genomic knowledge that highlight the variations that exist between different host
species.

2.1. Data Collection and Phylogenetic Analysis

We were able to collate 215 bat-CoV genomes of varying families (Alphacoronaviruses and
Betacoronaviruses) with only one exhibiting a small proportion or genomic uncertainty (presence
of 0.45% ’N’ nucleotide). However, only 7 pangolin-CoV genomes, of which 5 were annotated as
Betacoronaviurs, were available at the start of this study. 3 pangolin-CoV genomes also contained
levels of the ambiguous ’N’ nucleotide, two of them at high levels (6.88 and 8.19%). A population
of post-outbreak SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Charite [14], Germany, were also collated for further
analysis. For the phylogenetic analysis, we examined the complete set of 269 genomes (7 pangolin, 47
Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolates (including 1 Ensembl Wuhan reference) and 215 bat). The phylogenetic
tree produced at the whole genome level showed a clear separation between SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan
isolates and the bat-CoV genomes (except RaTG13) (Figure 1). The 7 pangolin-CoV genomes cluster
together and are closest to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate population of genomes, discounting the
RaTG13 genome which was the closest to SARS-CoV-2. The Ensembl Wuhan reference genome [15]
has been placed within the other Wuhan isolates.
The tree produced was used as an analytical anchor for which we could use to refer to in the
codon usage bias and variant analysis. High impact variants and codon usage clusters were plotted on
the tree to show their distribution across the different clades along the topology of the tree.

The complimentary approach of using PROKKA [16] and BLAST [17] to identify the set of genes
for each of the viral genomes complemented each other and enabled a comparative analysis. A
breakdown of the number of genes identified for each dataset is shown in Table 1 and Table A1

Table 1. This table presents the distribution of the number of predicted genes for each dataset. Bat-CoV
exhibit the widest distribution of gene count, and pangolin-CoV has the highest number of gene count,
with one genome having 17 predicted genes. These outliers have low sequence or assembly quality.
In the case of the pangolin-CoV genome reporting 17 genes, it has low quality (’NNNN’) nucleotide
regions spanning the centre of genes, which causes PROKKA to identify the two ends of one gene.
The median gene count only varying in bat-CoVs, likely attributed to the large phylogenetic variation
exhibited across the bat genomes.

BLAST was utilised in attempts to capture a number of genes with strong homology to the
SARS-CoV-2 ref (≥ 80%) that were not identified by PROKKA. In particular, these genes were E, ORF8
and ORF10.
Whilst this has enabled the characterisation of E and ORF10 in many genomes, no additional
ORF8 were identified through BLAST apart from 6 examples in the Charite dataset (genomes had levels
of ambiguous ’N’). This could in part be due to the high threshold setting used in the BLAST search
(>80% identity). ORF8 was only identified in 3 bat-CoVs and 1 pangolin-CoV with this combined
approach. At least 38 additional bat-CoV ORF8 and 4 additional pangolin-CoV ORF8 representatives
were identified by PROKKA with less than 80% identity. Genes utilising ribosomal frameshifting such
as the aforementioned ORF1ab, are inherently difficult to identify correctly without extensive analysis
involving techniques and evidence such as RNA expression analysis. For the majority of genomes
studied, PROKKA was able to identify two large ORFs spanning almost the entire length of the ORF1ab

Nobecovirus and Merbecovirus, are indicated on the graph, showing that our codon usage bias and
variant analysis results are restricted to the Sarbecovirus due to poor alignment between SARS-CoV-2
ref and genomes outside this subgenera. There also appears to be some degree of genera and species
separation for bat hosts. The majority of the Sarbecovirus affect the bat genus Rhinolophus (column
b, light blue, dark blue and purple), whereas a much smaller proportion of the Alphacoronavirus are
found in bats of this genus. Some clades overlap with specific bat species, including Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus sinicus and Scotophilus kuhlii. The results from the analysis made in

A gene-gene similarity network analysis was used to compare genes across SARS-CoV-2, bat-CoV
and pangolin-CoV. The advantage of using a 3D network approach to visualise this information was
that it simplifies complex information as patterns. Genes sharing high similarity form independent
clusters. In cases where there is a high degree of dissimilarity in a gene for different host species, a
pattern of 2 or more distinct clusters would take place, with each cluster comprised of genes derived
from samples of the same host-species. In genes where there is a medium level of dissimilarity
across host-species, two or more cluster would appear fused and potentially break apart into distinct
clusters if the edge threshold were increased. Both of these patterns are observed within this
dataset. Distinct separation by host species are seen in ORF1a, ORF3a,ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and
S (Figure 2). The strongest host-species separation observed were between SARS-CoV-2 and bat-CoV;
pangolin-CoV always group closer to SARS-CoV-2 than to bat-CoV. In the cases of ORF3a, ORF8
and S, complete separation was observed between bat-CoV and human SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2B &
C). One bat-CoV genome, RaTG13, was more similar to SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV than the
remainder of the bat-CoV for S (Figure 2C). For ORF3a, three bat genomes (MG772933, MG772934 and
MN996532; named bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and RaTG13 respectively) clustered together
with SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV rather than with the remainder of the bat genomes (Figure 2).
These same three genomes are the only bat-CoV with ORF8 that co-cluster with SARS-CoV-2 ORF8
under the percentage identity threshold (≥80%) set for building the network graph. Other bat-CoV
ORF8 were so distinct from SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 that they do not co-cluster, even when edge filtering
was removed.
To investigate whether if potential gene transfer or recombination that may have come from
more distantly related bat-CoV, we sought for unusual co-clustering between genes characterised from
bat-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We did not observe such pattern; RatG13 co-cluster with SARS-CoV-2 for
many genes, but it is also the most similar bat-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 at a genome level.
Two additional genes identified by PROKKA, Corona FSE, a non-coding frame-shift stimulation
element within ORF1ab and s2m, a stem-loop II-like motif [19] have both been shown to be highly
conserved and important for SARS-2-like coronaviruses. s2m has been identified as a mobile genetic
element which has been described in a number of single-stranded RNA virus and insect families and
has also been shown to be important for viral function [20,21].
In summary, the use of gene-gene network analysis enables us to determine groups of closely
related genes, which not only highlights genes showing strong host-species separation, but also
characterise clusters of related genes that may be absent or highly different from the reference
genome of interest, such as ORF8. 6 genes, ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and S, showed
a strong host-species separation in the network graph. In particular, with the exception of S, where
bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 clustered closer to bat-CoVs, the bat genomes, bat-SL-CoVZC45,
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and RaTG13, clustered together with SARS-CoV-2 than the remainder of the bat-CoV
for these 5 genes.

Figure 2. Gene-gene similarity network analysis. Each node represents a gene defined by PROKKA or
a DNA segment similar to genes from the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The nodes were compared
against each other using BLAST, and nodes with high similarity (BLAST score ≥ 60 and a query
coverage ≥ 80%) were connected with an edge. The network graph is labelled with host species. The
black font in the graph indicates the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 gene names (“ORF” omitted) for
the larger clusters, whereas blue font indicate additional non-coding sequences defined by PROKKA.
Instead of the full length ORF1ab ( 21k in length), ORF1a and ORF1b were defined by PROKKA as
two separate genes. Notably ORF1a, ORF3a, ORF6, and ORF8 and S, show strong separations between
nodes from different species. ORF8 from 3 bat-CoV co-cluster with ORF8 from SARS-CoV-2 (RaTG13,
bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 respectively). The remaining bat-CoV ORF8 do not co-cluster
with SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 even without the edge filtering threshold. For S, the bat-CoV RaTG13 co-cluster
with COVID-19 and pangolin. A cluster of bat-CoVs break off for ORF1b and M, suggesting a large
amount of variation amongst bat-CoV for these genes.

2.4. RNAseq expression analysis

164

In our exploratory analysis during the Hackathon event, we attempted to capture gene-level
expression evidence for each of the predicted ORFs. However, following the event, we recognise that
RNA virus gene expression cannot be captured through standard RNAseq analysis pipeline. We have
included the results of our analysis in the supplementary section for record purpose only; it is an
inaccurate estimation of the viral gene expression, as it does not differentiate viral mRNA expression
from viral genome.

Codon usage profiling of all representative genes of the SARS-CoV-2 ref separated from human
host (Wuhan and Charite datasets), bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV was carried out. RSCU (relative
synonymous codon usage) were calculated for each gene and for all genes that are found in >18%
of the bat dataset s (E, N, S, ORF1a, ORF3a and ORF10) to depict an overall relative synonymous
codon usage across genomes from the datasets. Principle component analysis (PCA) using RSCU
showed a strong host-species separation; the first principle component (PC1) accounts for > 90%
of the variation (Figure 3a and b). Some separation was observed amongst bat-CoVs (Figure 3a &
b). K-means clustering was used to cluster bat-CoVs using the multiple-gene PCA output (with
the exception of MG772933, MG772934 and MN996532, named bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21
and RaTG13 respectively, as they group closer to SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV). The generated

clusters, unsurprisingly correspond to different clades in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3b and Figure
1c). We have also examined RSCU across bat-CoV, pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV for each gene. Strong
host-species separation is seen across all genes. Similar to the PCA done with multiple genes, whilst
the majority of the variation can be explained by host-species differences, there is also some variation
amongst the bat-Cov that correspond to the k-means clusters generated from the multi-gene PCA
analysis (Figure A3). A summary of the synonymous codon ratios (the number of codon divided by
total number of codons coding for the same amino acid), sorted by amino acids, are shown in Figure
A5.

Figure 3. A) Principle component analysis was carried out on the relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU) to demonstrate host-species variation in codon usage bias. RSCU was calculated using E, N,
S, ORF1ab, ORF3a and ORF10. This analysis only included genomes annotated with all of the listed
genes. The majority of the variation (principle component, PC1) can be explained by host-species,
with the exception of the three labelled bat-CoV (MG772933, MG772934 and MN996532; named
bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and RaTG13 respectively). B) By using k-means clustering, two
distinct clusters were generated from bat-CoV (excluding the 3 distinct bat-CoV highlight in a). A
portion of the variation (PC2) reflect the different clades in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). Both cluster
1 and cluster 2 remains grouped closely together across all genes (with the exception of KY352407.

Haplotype aware variant calling and variant effect prediction of all genomes in the study has
been summarised in Figure 4 and Table additional file 1. There are a total of 1,127 variants that are

We have removed missense from further analysis and came to a total of 24 high impact variations

variation in Figure 1, and found that some of these variations, such as variants identified in E,
ORF7a and ORF3a, appear to exhibit some degree of clade specificity. The only stop gain variant (i.e.
NC045512_29635) was present in ORF10 gene of 57 bat-CoV genomes (29635 bp position C>A) which
was only representing a synonymous variant in the same position of 6 pangolin-CoV genomes. This
variant affected 26Y>26* (Tyrosine to STOP codon TAC>TAA) in bat ORF10. Assuming the direction
of host-selection from bat and pangolin to human, this variant could explain the presence of a longer
ORF10 isoform in the 2 latter hosts in comparison to bat-CoV. From the variant Table 4, four in-frame

3. Discussion
During the 5 day hackathon, we endeavoured to utilise the genomic data aggregated by the
scientific community and undertook a multifaceted and comprehensive exploration of the genomic
sequences (or “similarities and differences”) of coronaviruses infecting bat and pangolin hosts, available
at the time. We have compared SARS-Cov-2 to all bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV genomes from the listed
data repositories (NCBI, VIPR and Databiology) without selecting for strains to represent any specific
genera, species or sub-strain. Our comparisons spanned across several levels: whole-genome, genes,
codons and individual variants.
The phylogenetic tree inferred from all genomes studied in this manuscript presents a picture of
vast bat-CoV diversity and its topology is similar to those of previous studies carried out on pangolin
and bat coronaviruses when compared to the SARS-CoV-2 genome [22]. Previous phylogenetic
profiling has noted that RaTG13 (bat-CoV) bares the closest resemblance to SARS-CoV-2 using 14
SARS-CoV-2 and 55 non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes [23]. In this study, we have investigated
a more expansive set of bat-CoV genomes, and included pangolin-CoV genomes. RaTG13 remains
the closest to SARS-CoV-2 at the whole-genome level, although all 7 pangolin-CoV genomes are more
closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than the remaining 214 bat-coronavirus (Figure 1). This relationship has
previously been reported and a recombination event between pangolin-CoVs and RaTG13 has been
theorised [24]. The RaTG13 coronavirus found in horseshoe bats, as with SARS-CoV-2, is a member of
the coronaviridae subgenus Sarbecovirus, has been suggested to be the closest relative to SARS-2 in a
number of studies [25]. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown and a number of coronaviruses
from different hosts have been proposed [26,27]. Bats are often linked to SARS-like viruses capable of
zoonotic host transfer due to their unique niche as viral reservoirs, meaning that they are relatively
unaffected by viral loads and their natural proximity to human habitation [28,29]. Recombination
has been suggested as an avenue for host-transfer for a number of RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-1
and MERS [30]. More recently, evidence has also been found for inter-host recombination events in a
SARS-CoV-2 patient, which may have lead to new traits such as increased virulence from multiple
strains [31].
In the attempts to address the potential recombination events or gene transfers between a strain
distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 and a strain more closely related to SARS-CoV-2, we sought to
annotate, characterise and compare genes from our diverse sets of coronaviruses. RNA virus genomes
are often compact, with little intergenic distance between genes, even those of the Coronaviridae
family which are regarded to have the largest RNA viral genomes. This makes accurate annotation a
difficult task, especially for frame-shift utilising genes and the distinction of what is produced as final
protein product. We initially encountered a number of problems while performing genome annotation,
where a number of contemporary gene prediction methodologies failed to identify ORF10 in any
of our datasets, except for 5 pangolin-CoV genomes. Furthermore, the DNA sequence representing
ORF10 in SARS-CoV-2, which was previously reported as having no homology to any known sequence
in public databases [32], has now been found in previous examples of coronaviruses infecting both
pangolins and bats with very high sequence similarity (≥90%) [33]. With the utilisation of BLAST,
ORF10 was found in 162 out of the 163 of all the SARS-CoV-2 (1 genome contained low quality regions),
all pangolin-CoVs and 59 bat-CoV genomes. On the other hand, we initially found only 3 bat-CoV
(RaTG13, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) ORF8 representatives when comparing PROKKA
characterised sequences against SARS-CoV-2 genes and identified no additional sequences through
BLAST. However, with the use of gene-gene network analysis, we noted that this apparent absence of
ORF8 was due to the very low percentage similarity between most bat-CoV ORF8 and SARS-CoV-2
ORF8; the network analysis showed a cluster of 38 bat-CoV ORF8 that strongly correlated to each
other. Ceraolo et al. (2020) have shown that ORF8 from RaTG13 shares 94% protein identity to
SARS-CoV-2, whilst those of other bat-betacoronaviruses show <60% similarity [34]. Furthermore,
Pereira (2020) has shown ORF8 orthologues are present outside betacoronaviruses linage B (subgenus
Sarbecovirus) [35]. Interestingly, the 3 bat-CoV ORF8 genes were more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than

the majority of the pangolin-CoV ORF8 representatives; 4 of the 5 pangolin-CoV ORF8 genes only
joined to the ORF8 cluster through the bat-CoV ORF8 in our network analysis. There were only 4
proteins with 80-100% identity and 100% coverage identified by BLAST searches against ORF8 using
the NCBI and UniProtKB/Protein databases [36]. Two of these proteins were bat-CoV (RaTG13 and
Bat-SL-CoVZC45), while the other two were pangolin-CoV; all four genomes were present in our
dataset and we have also observed this high similarity in ORF8. The exact function of ORF8 remains to
be elucidated, although studies on ORF8 from SARS-CoV-2 and ORF8ab and ORF8b from SARS-CoV-1
have suggested a role in immune modulation through the interferon signalling pathway [37,38] and
induce strong antigen response [39]. Although the origin or function of the SARS-related coronavirus
ORF8 remains unresolved, a 29-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 is often found in SARS-CoV-1, when
compared to civet-CoV, suggesting that ORF8 may be important for interspecies transmission [40]. In
post-pandemic studies of the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, deletions in specific genome domains found
in samples from human and mammalian hosts were identified as being possible conduits for early
human infection [41].
Other genes that show strong host-species separation in the gene-gene network analysis include
ORF1a, ORF3a, ORF6 and S. In contrast to ORF8, where the three bat-CoV were more similar to
SARS-CoV-2 than pangolin-CoV, pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein were more similar to each
other (97.5%), than those of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 ( 95.4%) [33]. This is significant as the S protein
plays an important role in the initial penetration and infection of host cells [42]. Several human
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63),
enters the host cells by binding to the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through
the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein [43,44]. Host-cell receptor recognition is one of
the determining factors of host-cell tropism and the co-evolutionary struggle between viruses and
their hosts has likely involved a number of exchanges of genetic information during long periods of
interaction of pathogen and host-cell contact [45,46]. Viruses have been shown to have high degrees
of flexibility in their receptor usage and poses capacity to reach efficient binding through mutations
[45,46]. By altering the amino acids within the RBD of SARS-CoV-1, Qu et al. (2005) has noted that a
single amino acid substitution reduces the binding affinity, and two amino acid substitution almost
abolishes its infection of human cells [47]. Moreover, by substituting these amino acids civet-CoV for
those from SARS-CoV-1 enabled the modified civet-CoV to infect human ACE-2 expressing cells [47].
This illustrates the importance and complexity of S in cross-species infectivity. Nonetheless, it would
appear that despite the S protein being more similar between pangolin-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2, as
compared to SARS-CoV-2 versus bat-CoVs, the S protein in RaTG13 on the whole is still more similar
to that of SARS-CoV-2 than to those of all other bat-CoVs in this study (Figure 2C). This supports the
theory that neither a currently sequenced pangolin-CoV or bat-CoV are the most recent ancestor of
SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to examining the overall sequence similarity of between genes derived from bat-CoV,
pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we have also examined the codon usage within and across genes.
Codon usage bias across the species-host range may show signs of preferential codon mutation
which have occurred during the complex process of host interaction and transfer [11,12]. The
knowledge of nucleotide profiles and subsequent codons during the human-virus co-evolution could
be invaluable to the design of vaccines and their continuous development over the years to come [48].
We have demonstrated a strong host-species separation in the overall codon usage when combining
multiple genes (E, N, S, ORF1a, ORF3a and ORF10) in the analysis. There is very little variation in
codon usage bias within the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, all pangolin-CoVs and the 3 bat-CoVs
(bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and RatG13) have a more similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2.
The k-means clusters generated from the PCA using RSCU of multiple genes correspond to clades
within the phylogenetic trees and remain intact when compared across each gene individually (Figure
1c and Figure A3), with two clusters aligned with subsets of bat-CoVs isolated from Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum and Rhinolophus sinicus respectively. When comparing codon usage bias across

the host-species at a gene-level, bat-CoV also appear to be more distinct from SARS-CoV-2 than
pangolin-CoV, both with respect to the percentage similarity and the presence/absence of genes,
with the exception of the 3 bat-CoVs (bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and RaTG13). In contrast
to the codon usage analysis carried out by Gu et al. (2020), in which the authors has reported the
codon usage for M in pangolin-CoVs to be more similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 than RatG13 [49],
our analysis does not suggest this to be the case. This could be due to a difference in the range of
hosts included; we have included SARS-CoV-2, pangolin-CoV and bat-CoV, whereas they additionally
included coronavirus that affects camel, rodent, pigs and other species. Our codon usage analysis has
been restricted to an overall comparison of RSCU across the genomes we have used in this study, as
more detailed breakdown of codon usage bias and CpG dinucleotide have been carried out elsewhere
[50–52]. Previous studies have correlated the RSCU of SARS-CoV-2 to those of human genes and found
them to significantly correlate with a large number of human genes, which are enriched in pathways
relating to host response to viral infection [50]. It has been observed that host genes sharing similar
codon usage as SARS-CoV-2 are downregulated during an infection, potentially through causing an
unbalance to the host tRNA pool and thus host protein synthesis [51]. These mechanisms potentially
reflect the affects of coronavirus on the genome separation of different host species, observed in the
RSCU analysis.
Next, we focused on variants that could potentially have a more profound impact on the structures
of the proteins through the addition or removal of an amino acid, or through early termination. In this
analysis, we have found that only pangolin-CoV and a subset of bat-CoV (Sarbecovirus or unannotated)
were similar enough to the SARS-CoV-2 ref for the sequences to align 1. Population level viral mutation
is a complex process, involving a number of pressures, and while RNA viruses often exhibit some of
the highest mutation rates of all viruses, conserved variants can exhibit important functional changes
such as the ability to evade immunity more efficiently [53]. Unlike the vast majority of RNA viruses,
coronaviruses encode a complex RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that has a 3’ exonuclease domain
[54], effectively proofreading mutational events and therefore are less error-prone. Therefore the
mutations observed across populations have undergone an error-correction process which means they
are more likely to be functionally beneficial to the virus. We have observed several of such variants
that are at consistent loci across different bat-CoV clades as shown in Figure 1. Some of these variants
are seen in the majority of the bat-CoV samples (which align to SARS-CoV-2 ref), including a stop-gain
for ORF10 and an inframe deletion for M, whilst others, such as the variants seen in ORF7a and E
appear to be clade specific (Figure 1). Several of these variants affect the same amino acid positions,
including E (inframe insertion of Asp (Aspartic acid), Glu (Glutamic acid) or Gln (Glutamine) at at
positions 68), N (inframe insertion of Pro (Proline) or Ser (Serine) at position 7) and ORF7a (inframe
insertion of His Histidine, Gln or Tyr (Tyrosine) at position 93) (Figure 1). Notably, the stop-gain was
identified at amino acid position 26 in ORF10 for 57 of the 59 bat-CoV genomes with ORF10 that had
>80% similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 ref. The absence of this stop codon in the pangolin (which exhibited
synonymous mutations at the same locus) and human adapted viruses could result in a longer isoform
of the ORF10 or fundamental changes in its function and expression levels. In a previous study of
SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV genomes, position 26 was also identified as a region of population
level variation from Tyr and His which significantly modifies the secondary structure of the coil region
of the protein [55].
There has been little research on ORF10 function, and its expression has been the subject of
debate. Whilst Kim et al. (2020) found little evidence of ORF10 expression (0.000009% of viral
junction-spanning reads) in cell culture (Vero cells) [56], Liu et al (2020) found it to be abundantly
expressed in severe COVID-19 patient cases but barely detectable in moderate cases [57]. Discrepancies
in ORF10 expression may be due to differences in the level of infection and host cell-type used in the
studies, however the variants noted show potential functions due to host-species-level conservation.
Multiple codon insertions and deletions also exist in ORF1ab of pangolin-CoV and bat-CoV
genomes, which with the polypeptide coding potential of the gene which covers 2/3 of the genome, is

likely to impact a number of important and complex elements of the virus. Machinery needed for viral
replication and the proofreading subunit required to safeguard coronavirus replication fidelity, are
just two functions of the 16 polypeptides which form after the processing of ORF1ab, and therefore
potentially include several key targets for antiviral drug development [58].
As opposed to the single ORF10 variant that is observed in the majority of the bat-CoV, we
have observed 3 different amino acid insertions (4 different nucleotide changes) at position 68 of
E in 4 different clades of bat-CoVs. The small envelope E protein is the smallest of coronaviruses’
major structural proteins, but also one of the least described [59]. E has been shown to be highly
expressed inside infected cells and the viruses which are formed without E exhibit reduced levels of
viral maturation and tropism. Expression of the E product was essential for virus release and spread,
thus demonstrating the importance of E in virus infection and therefore vaccine development [60]. The
68th amino acid position we highlight in this study is in the c-terminal domain, which coincides with
the previously reported motif in SARS-CoV-1 (also at 68th amino acid position) that binds to the host
cell PALS1 protein to facilitate infection [61].
Less than 0.5% of 3,617 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been found to have non-synonymous mutation
in E, and of these, 20% are at the 68th amino acid position [62]. These changes in amino acid may alter
the hydrophobicity at the locus, thus possibly influencing the protein functions and interactions [62].
Two of the E variants we highlighted use different codons for the same amino acid (GAG or GAA for
Glu), which potentially suggests interplay between the selection pressures of codon optimisation and
amino acid insertion into the protein product.
We have characterised a number of inframe insertions at the amino acid position 93 in ORF7a
across 55 bat-CoV genomes, and at position 94 reported in 2. As with position 68 in E, position 93 in
ORF7a has multiple codon insertions coding for the same amino acid but in two groups. In these two
groups of bat-CoVs, an additional His is encoded for by two different codons and secondly, so is Tyr
in another group. Intriguingly, ORF7a in SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to regulate the bone marrow
stromal antigen 2 which inhibits the release of virions of human infecting viruses [63].
N is another gene for which we have shown multiple inframe insertion variants for the same
amino acid position. The N protein is highly expressed during an infection, and plays a key role in
promoting viral RNA synthesis and incorporating genomic RNA into progeny viral particles [64].
In gene N, we observed two inframe insertions at amino acid position 7 for Ser or Pro from two
groups of bat-CoVs (13 and 11 respectively), as well as two inframe deletions at positions 238 and 385.
For M in 57 bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV, there is an inframe deletion at position 3, which removed
the amino acid Ser. At this amino acid position, a missense mutation of (Asp) to Arg is seen in 2
bat-CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) and 1 pangolin-Cov, and (Asp) to Glycine (Gly) in 6
pangolin-Cov genomes. These same two bat-CoV have been shown to be more similar to SARS-CoV-2
than other bat-CoV on other comparative metrics. M plays an important role in its interactions with
both E and S to incorporate virions into the host-cells, thus any mutation in either gene may cause a
number of important changes across all.
As opposed to the majority of the identified variants, ORF6 only exhibits 2 different inframe
deletions in position 30, which remove the same amino acid Tyr.
The amino acid positions we have highlighted through our variant analysis may constitute
important differences in the function or folding potential of the protein product. We have summarised
these in Figure 1. The naturally occurring variants we observed across bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV
may be associated with selection advantage, such as virulence or the efficacy to infect a specific host
species.
Weber et al. (2020) have interrogated 572 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated worldwide and
characterised 10 distinct mutation hotspots that have been found in up to 80% of the viral genomes
they examined [65]. Whilst our reported amino acid positions do not coincide with the 10 hospots they
have reported, some of the genomes they examined display changes on or adjacent to our reported
positions

Through employing a number of genomic analysis methodologies, this study has aimed to bring
understanding of the diversity across SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses by comparing
a wide selection of available genomes from the starting point of the pandemic. We have highlighted a
high degree of host-specices separation in ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and S, as well as in codon usage.
A number of amino acid positions that demonstrate high impact variants (inframe insertion/deletion
or stop gain) have also been identified in various bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV; these are potentially
functionally important positions of the protein and warrants further research.

Historically, genomes held in public databases have been fragmentary, resulting in multiple
collections with overlapping examples with alternative naming schemes and annotations. Fortunately,
a large collection of virus genomes of the Coronaviridae family (Coronavirus) deposited in databases
such as the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) [66] have been provided with both genomic sequence
and metadata which has been examined for redundancy and comparative annotation. Coronavirus
genomes isolated from humans, bats and pangolins used in this study were collected from multiple
repositories and grouped by their host and source. The databases and groups are listed in Table 2.

Table 2. Coronavirus genomes were collected from the various database resources listed by host and
source categories. Using taxonomic data made available by the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis
Resource (ViPR) [66], 70 bat-CoVs were identified as Betacoronavirus and 84 were Alphacoronavirus. 5
pangolin-CoVs were identified as Betacoronavirus. The remaining bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV genomes
did not have a family identification. These were downloaded in May 2020 and consisted of the
contemporary available and open datasets at the time. All genomes and their respective ID’s are
currently available through NCBI (Oct 2020). In cases where two groups contained the same genome
(Possibly with a different name), only one representative was taken.

4.2. Genome Annotation
RNA viruses such as SARS and other coronaviruses have been characterised as having the ability
to utilise ribosomal programmed frameshifting for a number of important genes [68]. Identification
of such genes is complex and often requires high quality RNA expression evidence. Due to this and
the complexity of genome annotation, especially in novel viral genomes such as SARS-CoV-2, two
approaches were taken to identify the set of genes for each of the genomes in this study. In this regard,
for defining genes, we first employed PROKKA (Rapid Prokaryotic Genome Annotation) to curate the
genes for each of the coronavirus genomes. PROKKA utilises Prodigal [69] to initially find ORFs, which
ensures that the DNA sequences of the genes found are in-frame and contain the correct amino acid
coding potential. Prodigal is an unsupervised ab initio prediction method and therefore does not rely
on previous knowledge to predict ORFs, which, unlike sequence homology based tools such as BLAST,
does not require previously annotated sequence data to identify potential genes within novel genomes.
Howeber, to overcome the limitations and intricacies of contemporary ab initio genome annotation
techniques, BLAST was used to identify additional genes with strong homology to those present

in the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome released by Ensembl v100 (SARS-CoV-2 ref) ASM985889v3
[15](https://covid-19.ensembl.org). The additional BLAST annotation was performed with a BLAST
percentage identity threshold of ≥ 80% are labelled separately where annotation methodologies may
have an impact. This combined approach was used to avoid solely relying on either method, especially
BLAST’s agnostic approach to coding frame detection.

4.3. Phylogenetic Trees

461

A Phylogenetic tree was produced from the genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolates, Ensembl
Wuhan reference and the bat and pangolin coronaviruses to examine their evolutionary relationships
at the genomic level. Clustal Omega 1.2.4 [70] was used to perform a multiple sequence alignment for
each of the genomes with default parameters. The phylogenetic tree was inferred from the multiple
sequence alignment with RAxML [71] using default parameters apart from the GTRGAMMA option
and bootstrapping set to 20. The plotted using packages in R. Midpoint-root and ladderized were
carried out using phytools[72] and ape [73], and ggtree [74] was used for the visualisation. The
subgenus information for Betacoronavirus were curated and clades labelled based on consensus of the
majority (i.e. if > 85% of the samples in the clade are labelled and have the same subgenus annotation).
For labelling the bat-CoVs host genera and species information, a list of host genera and species are
curated. Host species with >10 bat-CoV genomes were labelled, followed by host genera with more >
10 bat-CoV genomes. The remaining bats were grouped into a single group "other".

Genes identified by PROKKA from each host-set were collated and together with the additional
sequences from the BLAST-alignment to the SARS-CoV-2 ref genome as aforementioned, an
all-against-all comparison was made with BLAST. This was done with all gene sequences as both the
reference and the query as input. A network graph was generated using Graphia Enterprise [75] by
treating each gene as a node and generating edges between nodes with significant BLAST alignments.
A significant BLAST alignment was defined to have a BLAST score ≥ 60, a query coverage ≥ 80% and
a percentage identity ≥ 80%. Components with less than 5 nodes were removed from the graph. The
same procedure was carried out using amino acid sequences as input (Figure A1). Where the amino
acid sequences were not generated by PROKKA, the matched sequences extracted from BLAST were
translated into amino acid sequences, provided that the sequences contained the start and stop codons.

Codon usage metrics for every gene in the SARS-CoV-2 reference gene catalogue were calculated
in all available genome sets. Gene sequence output of the PROKKA and BLAST searches (where correct
frame was present) were collated and BLAST searched against the SARS-CoV-2 ref genes; genes that
have a BLAST result were included and annotated with the SARS-CoV-2 gene. For each set of genes
annotated with an SARS-CoV-2 gene, those substantially shorter than the average (< mean length - 2
standard deviation) were removed from codon usage analysis. Custom Python scripts (available on
Github (https://github.com/coronahack2020/final_paper.git) were used to summarise the frequencies
of each of the codons. Non-standard codons, start, stop codons were discarded, along with the codon
TGG as it is the only codon codinig for tryptophan.
Relative synonymous codon usage was calculated as the ratio of the observed frequency of codon
to the expected frequency under the assumption of equal usage between synonymous codons for the
same amino acids [76].

by Ensembl v100 ASM985889v3. The allelic counts and variant effect prediction was carried out in
order to identify variants with high impact changes (inframe deletion, inframe insertion, frameshift, or
stop gain) within or between viruses collected from different host species.
Briefly, multiple genome fasta input files were mapped against the SARS-CoV-2 ref assembly
using minimap2 [77] with the following flags (minimap2 –cs -cx asm20 INPUT REF > OUT.paf).
The generated PAF (pairwise alignment format) files were subsequently used for variant calling
through the paftools.js module in minimap2 (sort -k6,6 -k8,8n OUT.paf | paftools.js call -l 200 -L 200
-q 30 -f REF.fa). Haplotype aware variant consequences were generated using VEP (Variant Effect
Predictor) [78] [79]) and BCFtools/csq [80]. The complete set of scripts for this pipeline can be found
in https://github.com/coronahack2020/final_paper.git.

The RNASeq dataset (n=4) was obtained from the publicly available project PRJCA002326 at
National Genomic Data Centre of Beijing Genomics Institute.
The details of the samples can be found in https://bigd.big.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/
PRJCA002326. Briefly, total RNA were extracted from broncho-alveolar flush (BALF) samples of two
COVID-19 patients treated at the Wuhan University Hospital (Wuhan, China). Ribosomal depeltion
was carried out, followed by 150bp pair-end sequencing with an 145bp insert size using Illumina
MiSeq. After trimming the raw reads using Trimmomatic v.0.39 [81], a Kallisto index was built based
on cDNA fasta obtained from Ensembl v100 ASM985889v3. After mapping the read to transcriptome
(CDS) level fasta file using Kallisto, the transcript level abundance (TPM) was extracted and visualised
in R v.4.0.0 [82].

Appendix C. Gene-gene network graph using amino acid sequences

Figure A1. Gene-gene similarity network analysis. Each node represents a amino acid sequence defined
by PROKKA or BLAST (ORF10 and E). The nodes were compared against each other using BLAST,
and nodes with high similarity (BLAST score ≥ 60 and a query coverage ≥ 80%) were connected with
an edge. The network graph is labelled with with SARS-CoV-2 gene names ("ORF" omitted). When the
network graph is coloured by host species, genes showing higher degree of variability across species
are highlighted. Similar to the network analysis on nucleotide sequences (Figure 2). Genes ORF3a,
ORF6, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10 and S show strong separation between nodes from different species. The
degree of separation in ORF1ab are stronger than ORF10 in the nucleic acid network graph; the reverse
is true for the amino acid network graph.

Figure A2. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) was calculated as the ratio of the observed
frequency of codon to the expected frequency under the assumption of equal usage between
synonymous codons for the same amino acids. This was carried out for each gene. The total number
of genomes used in each plot are indicated in the top left corner for bat-CoV (b), pangolin-CoV
(p),SARS-CoV-2 Charite dataset (c) and Wuhan dataset (w). As well as a strong separation between
bat-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is also some separation within bat-CoV for most genes. Whilst we
have illustrated the PCA based on RSCU for all genes, the interpretation for some of the shorter genes
should be done with caution as they do not encompass the full spectrum of amino acids.

Charite dataset (c), Wuhan dataset (w), cluster 1 bat-CoV (cl1), cluster 2 bat-CoV (cl2) and cluster 3
bat-CoV (cl3). The clustering for bat-CoV refers to the k-means clustering performed on PCA of RSCU
using multiple genes (Figure 3). As well as a strong separation between bat-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
there is also some separation within bat-CoV for most genes. The clusters seen in RSCU PCA with
multiple gene remain together for all genes where the majorities of the genomes are present. Whilst we
have illustrated the PCA based on RSCU for all genes, the interpretation for some of the shorter genes
should be done with caution as they do not encompass the full spectrum of amino acids.

Appendix G. Synonymous codon ratios

Figure A5. Synonymous codon ratios are the ratio between the number of a given codon divided by the
total number of codon coding for the same amino acid. By sorting this ratio in blocks of synonymous
codons, this heatmap illustrate the preferential codons for each amino acid for each dataset across all
genes. A number of codon usage bias are consistent across most genes and datasets. For instance,
GCT is preferentially used for Alanine and GTT for Valine. On the whole, there seem to be less of a
preferential codon use for bat, especially in longer genes or when multiple genes are accounted for, as
per indicated by the higher frequency of more evenly distributed codon within each amino acid (i.e. for
the bat dataset, the heatmap colours are of a similar level within each amino acid ). Codons with GCs
are generally underrepresented, such as in Arg (Arginine), Pro (Proline) and Ser (Serine). * The values
in this row is generated by combing codons from multiple genes, E, N, S, ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF10.
