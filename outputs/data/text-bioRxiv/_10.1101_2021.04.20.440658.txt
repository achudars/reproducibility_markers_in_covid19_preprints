Abstract
Risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity are still poorly understood. Considering the
pivotal role of gut microbiota on host immune and inflammatory functions, we
investigated the association between changes in gut microbiota composition and the
clinical severity of COVID-19. We conducted a multicentre cross-sectional study
prospectively enrolling 115 COVID-19 patients categorized according to: 1) WHO
Clinical Progression Scale - mild 19 (16.5%), moderate 37 (32.2%) or severe 59
(51.3%); and 2) location of recovery from COVID-19 - ambulatory 14 (household
isolation; 12.2%), hospitalized in ward 40 (34.8%) or intensive care unit 61 (53.0%).
Gut microbiota analysis was performed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data
obtained was further related with clinical parameters of COVID-19 patients. Risk
factors for COVID-19 severity were identified by univariate and multivariable logistic
regression models.
In comparison with mild COVID-19 patients, the gut microbiota of moderate and severe
patients has: a) lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, b) higher abundance of
Proteobacteria; and c) lower abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria such
as Roseburia and Lachnospira genera. Multivariable regression analysis showed that
Shannon index diversity (odds ratio [OR] 2.85 [95% CI 1.09-7.41]; p=0.032) and CReactive Protein (OR 3.45 [95% CI 1.33-8.91]; p=0.011) were risk factors for COVID19 severe disease (a score of 6 or higher in WHO clinical progression scale).
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that hospitalised moderate and severe COVID19 patients have microbial signatures of gut dysbiosis and for the first time, the gut
microbiota diversity is pointed out as a prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 disease
severity.

Introduction

COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection, is clinically
diverse in terms of disease severity  ranging from absence of symptoms, to mild, selflimiting respiratory illness (including the common cold), severe pneumonia, acute
respiratory distress syndrome and death (1). COVID-19-induced respiratory distress
syndrome was described to be associated with exuberant inflammation, intense cytokine
production (cytokine storm syndrome) and multi-organ dysfunction (1, 2). Although
respiratory symptoms are the most commonly reported among COVID-19 patients,
gastrointestinal symptoms are also likely between SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
indicating that the gastrointestinal tract is as well an infected organ (3). In consequence,
SARS-CoV-2 is detected in faeces of some COVID-19 patients (4-6).

Although risk groups for severe COVID-19 disease were identified as being primarily
the elderly and individuals with comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes (7-9),
COVID-19 may evolve adversely even in individuals without comorbidities, causing
severe pneumonia, long-term sequelae and eventually death(10). These observations
suggest the existence of major predisposition factor(s) related with disease progression
that need(s) to be urgently unveiled.

The human gut microbiota mainly composed by bacteria, plays a critical role in health
and most notably in host immune response, including vaccine efficacy (11, 12).
Changes in gut microbiota composition have been reported to affect both vulnerability
and disease outcomes in non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, inflammatory
bowel disease, and obesity, leading to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation (13-

15). This role of gut microbiota in both immune and inflammatory responses, together
with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2
receptors on gut epithelium (16) where it has been detected along the faeces of COVID19 patients (17), suggest the existence of a microbial fingerprinting among these
patients that may provide a predictive value for disease severity. Accordingly, gut
microbiome characterization has been assessed in COVID-19 patients that unveiled
profound alterations on bacterial composition (4, 18, 19). The depletion of beneficial
bacteria from Lachnospiraceae taxa and Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium and
Roseburia genera (18-20) has been proposed as having an impact on the modulation of
host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially influenced disease
severity and outcomes (18). However, existing studies did not enrol COVID-19 patients
representative of the different COVID-19 severity levels, lacking mainly patients with
severe clinical manifestations. Most importantly, previous studies did not clarify
whether the observed changes in microbiota composition are a common patient’s
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection rather than directly involved in disease severity.

Taking this into consideration, we investigate the association between gut microbiota
and COVID-19 disease severity using a cohort of 115 patients stratified by
asymptomatic/mild-moderate-severe according with the WHO Clinical Progression
Scale. Considering that previous studies have shown that alterations in gut microbiota
do not alter significantly during COVID-19 disease progression and even after SARSCoV-2 clearance (18, 19), one point faecal collection was performed and clinical
variables and gut bacterial composition were compared between COVID-19 severity
groups. The role of antibiotic use was also addressed. To the best of our knowledge, this

Materials and methods
Study design and population
This national multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted in six geographically
different Portuguese centres selected by invitation. The distribution of patients per
participating centre was 38 (33.0%), 33 (28.7%), 18 (15.7%), 12 (10.4%), 8 (7.0%), and
6 (5.2%). Patients eligibility criteria included age equal or above 18 years old and a
positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs using quantitative RT-PCR
performed in national reference laboratories and in accordance with recommendations
from the National Directorate of Health. COVID-19 patients were recruited during the
first wave of pandemic in Portugal - from 21st April 2020 to 1st July 2020 - and sample
size was determined based on the feasibility of recruitment during this period. The
minimally detectable effect sizes were calculated retrospectively. In order to achieve a
statistical power of 80% and a two-sided significance level of 0.05, and considering the
total sample size of 115 individuals, the study was powered to detect a mean difference
of 0.15 in the Shannon’s Diversity Index between mild-to-moderate and severe COVID19 patients.

Participating centres prospectively collected data from consecutive patients included in
the study and classified them according to location of recovery (ambulatory,
hospitalization in ward or intensive care unit [ICU]) and disease severity using the
WHO Clinical Progression Scale (21) (mild, moderate and severe). Ethic committees
and institutional review boards from participating centres approved the study protocol
considering it a minimal-risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice
and waived the requirement to obtain informed consent. Patients (or their proxies)
received written information about the study and were informed about their right to

refuse to participate. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT04355741. All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the
final version of the manuscript.

Data collection
Patient demographic characteristics, severity scores, smoking habits, comorbidities prior
to hospitalisation (diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory diseases,
immunosuppression, haematological oncological disease, previous chronic therapy, and
others), or antibiotic exposure six months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis were recorded
for all patients at baseline (i.e. immediately after subject enrolment). Data on clinical
presentation of COVID-19, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, antibiotic, antiviral and
steroid treatments received during the course of disease, as well as nutritional and
respiratory support (as per WHO Clinical Progression Scale (21)) were collected. In
addition, clinical outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of
stay, ICU mortality, and 28-day mortality were also collected. Patients were followed
up until hospital discharge if that was the case.

Stool Collection
Faecal samples of COVID-19 patients were collected after subject enrolment (single
point collection). Faecal samples were collected with a stool collection kit
(EasySampler, ALPCO) containing RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich). Faecal samples were
kept at -80 ºC until nucleic acid extraction.

Gut microbiota
Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from stool samples of COVID-19 patients
using the NZY Tissue gDNA Isolation Kit (NZYTech). All 16S DNA libraries (V3 and
V4 regions) were prepared, sequenced and analysed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions for each kit and instrument. Briefly, 16S DNA libraries
were prepared using the Ion 16S™ Metagenomics Kit targeted panel (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and each sample was individually identified with the Ion Xpress™ Barcode
Adapters Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All available regions were amplified using
the Ion 16S™ Metagenomics Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amplified fragments were
then prepared for sequencing using the Ion CHEF system (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and loaded into Ion 318 Chip Kit v2 BC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing runs
were performed on an Ion S5 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) aiming for a mean
sequencing depth coverage of 12000×. Sequencing depths were not normalized in order
to achieve a better identification of alpha diversity in each sample. Sequencing data was
filtered for length (cutadapt -m 80) and for quality (fastx_trimmer -l 280) after
which the V3 and V4 regions were extracted (Mothur align.seqs and
screen.seqs). The resulting fastq file was used for taxonomy. The taxonomy of each
sample was determined using Kraken2 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) and
Bracken (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/bracken) softwares, using our custom 16S
database (GutHealth_DB). This database was manually curated by enriching
GreenGenes (versions 13_5 and 13_8) with clinically relevant taxa from NCBI RefSeq
16s rRNA sequences (04/2019). The GutHealth_DB currently holds 4765 16s rRNA
sequences mapping 1822 species, 1685 genus, 515 families, 404 orders, 248 classes and
89 phyla, and is available upon request. Bacterial species were identified as pathogens
or commensals according to The National Microbial Pathogen Database Resource
(NMPDR) (https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/561#view_tab=genomes).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces
The following steps were taken to detect SARS-CoV-2 in faeces: 1) RNA extraction by
the NucliSENS easyMAG technology based on the Boom technique that utilizes
magnetic silica particles from 200-300 mg of stool, and b) detection of SARS-CoV-2
extracted RNA by the EURORealTime SARS-CoV-2 test. The latter is based on reverse
transcription to convert viral RNA into complementary DNA, followed by PCR
amplification and fluorescence-based real-time detection of two defined sections within
the ORF1ab- and N-genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Reverse transcription,
amplification and detection of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA were carried out by means of
SARS-CoV-2-specific primers and probes.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 27 software (SPSS Inc.) and
R statistical software package, version V.3.5.1. Descriptive statistics are presented as
numbers and percentages for categorical variables, as the mean and standard deviation
(SD) for continuous variables or as the medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) if the
continuous variable is not normally distributed. Parametric tests (Student’s t test and
one factor analysis of variance-ANOVA) and nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney and
Kruskal-Wallis tests) were used as appropriate, taking into account normality
assumptions and the number of groups compared. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was
used to test normality assumptions of the variable distributions. Chi-square test and
Fisher’s exact test were used as appropriate, for categorical variables.

Univariate and multivariate weighted logistic regression models were used in order to
evaluate risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (a score of 6 or more in
WHO Clinical Progression Scale). The dependent variable in all models was the
severity of COVID-19. Independent variables are indicated in table legends (Table 2).
The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and test was applied to evaluate the goodness-of-fit.
The discriminative/predictive power of the model was evaluated by the ROC-receiver
operating characteristic-curve analysis. The influence of outlier data values on model fit
was estimated using leverage statistics, and collinearity was assessed by evaluation of
the coefficients’ correlation matrix. The results are presented as crude and adjusted
Odds Ratios (OR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals. The statistical
significance level was set at 5% and differences were considered statistically significant
when p<0.05.
Heat tree visualization of the taxonomic differences between the COVID-19 severity
groups was produced using the R package metacoder. Coloring indicates all differences
between the median proportion of reads for samples from patients grouped according
with the severity of COVID-19 using the WHO Clinical Progression Scale i.e. mild
(score 1-3), moderate (score 4-5), and severe disease (score 6-9), as determined using a
Wilcox rank-sum test followed by a Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) correction for multiple
testing.

Alpha diversity was measured by the Shannon’s diversity index that summarizes both
the species richness (total number of species) and evenness (abundance distribution
across species) within a sample. The distances (or dissimilarity) between samples of the
same group were compared to the distances between groups using PERMANOVA test.

Missing data management
Considering that multiple imputation can give rise to biased results when missing data
are not random (22), regression analyses were based on complete data. In addition, a
sensitivity analysis was performed using multiple imputation in order to account for
missing data, with five imputed datasets and ten iterations. All analysis results were
aggregated with Rubin's rule after appropriate transformation (23).
The sensitivity analysis in which missing clinical variables were imputed by means of
model-based multiple imputation, showed similar results to the statistical analysis
performed with complete cases (Shannon’s Diversity Index: OR=2.71; 95% CI (1.13–
6.52); p=0.026; CRP: OR=4.42; 95% CI (1.61–12.10); p=0.004).
Since missing data were not equally distributed between hospital datasets, we cannot
ignore that missing data are not random. Since missing data at random assumption is not
testable, we used complete-case analysis as a better approach because multiple
imputation could give rise to biased results. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis in which
missing outcomes were imputed by multiple imputation were also carried out and this
analysis showed similar results, which suggests a limited effect of bias and strengthens
the results obtained.

Results

Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients
A total of 115 adults (median age 68; 63.5% males) with a laboratory confirmed
positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were included in our study (Table 1). More than half
(65.7%) were overweight or obese and, regarding co-morbidities, 45 patients (42.1%)
had diabetes, 67 (62.0%) hypertension and 21 (19.6%) chronic respiratory disease
(Table 1). Concerning antibiotic exposure, 42 patients (38.9%) were administered with
antibiotics at least once during the 6 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (Table 1)
and 108 (85.2%) were administered antibiotics during the course of COVID-19.
According to the location of recovery, the proportion of patients with diabetes attending
the ICU was significantly higher than the proportion of patients with diabetes isolated in
ward or in ambulatory (31 vs 14 patients, p<0.05). Similarly, the proportion of patients
presenting three simultaneous comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, and diabetes) was
higher in ICU patients than those isolated in the ward or ambulatory (22 vs 5 patients,
p<0.05).

Faecal microbiota profile according to COVID-19 severity
From the initial 115 COVID-19 patients, we were able to obtain a sufficient amount of
good quality faecal DNA to perform microbial composition based on 16S rRNA gene
analysis in 111 patients (96.5%). The gut microbiome of the COVID-19 patients was
compared based on the fold-change of relative abundance (medians) for each bacterial
genus. For this comparison, the COVID-19 patients were grouped according with the
disease severity defined by the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (21). This scale

provides a measure of illness severity in which a higher score means higher disease
severity. Eighteen COVID-19 patients were classified as asymptomatic/mild (score 13); thirty-six were categorized as moderate (4-5) while fifty-seven were severe (score 69). Three comparisons were done: 1) severe versus asymptomatic/mild; 2) severe versus
moderate; 3) moderate versus asymptomatic/mild (from here referred as mild). In order
to determine the relative taxonomic changes at genus-level between COVID-19 severity
groups, a heat tree was built for each comparison (Figure 1A) in which the terminal
nodes correspond to bacterial genera. For the first time, our data shows that differences
in gut microbiome occur across all phyla with exception of Synergistetes and
Verrucomicrobia, and the relative abundance is in general higher in lesser severe
COVID-19 states. The higher number of alterations were observed between mild and
moderate COVID-19 patients, and between mild and severe states. Lesser alterations
were detected between moderate and severe states of COVID-19. Globally, the relative
abundances tend to be higher in mild than in moderate patients; in turn, the relative
abundances tend to be higher in moderate than in the severe COVID-19 patients. This
decrease tendency from mild-to-moderate-to-severe is observed in the bacterial families
Bifidobacteriaceae (Bifidobacterium genus) and Coriobacteriaceae (Collinsella genus)
being statistically significant in Lachnospiraceae family, namely in the Roseburia and
Lachnospira genera (p<0.001, FDR corrected). In the opposite direction, Ralstonia
genus (Proteobacteria) increases with the COVID-19 severity score (p<0.001, FDR
corrected).

In accordance with the inverse relation between the relative abundance of bacterial gut
microbiota and the COVID-19 severity score, the Shannon’s diversity index shows a
similar tendency being higher in mild COVID-19 patients than in moderate and severe,

with a mean of 2.280.30 (score 1-3), 2.160.40 (score 4-5) and 2.100.42 (score 6-9),
respectively (Figure 1B).

Faecal microbiota profile according to COVID-19 location of recovery
As an indirect measure of COVID-19 severity grade, the COVID-19 patients were
grouped according with the location of recovery. Of the 111 COVID-19 patients with a
characterised faecal microbiota, 59 (53.2%) required ICU admission, 39 (35.1%) were
hospitalized in ward and 13 (11.7%) in ambulatory (household isolation). The gut
microbiome composition of all COVID-19 patients were compared using the non-metric
multidimensional scaling tool (Figure 2A). The faecal microbiota community of
COVID-19 patients recovering in ambulatory is more similar between them than with
the microbiota from those recovering in ward and in the ICU (p<0.05, PERMANOVA).
The comparison of the relative abundance at phylum level between the three groups
unveils a consistent trend for an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria
from 3% in ambulatory patients to 12% and 14% in ward and ICU patients, respectively
(Figure 2B). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio decreases in COVID-19 patients from
ambulatory-ward-ICU (0.68, 0.65, 0.58, respectively). Like observed for the WHO
severity groups, the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in ICU tends to have lower alpha
diversity (Shannon’s index) in comparison with ambulatory and in ward/hospitalized
COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C), as suggested by the lower mean and the first and third
quartile values.

Clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19 severity
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate
associations between patients’ clinical characteristics and COVID-19 severity (Table
2). Our aim was to develop a prognostic model able to predict the occurrence of certain
outcomes in severely vs mild-to-moderately ill patients. The univariate model showed
that severe COVID-19 patients were more likely to be men and to have elevated blood
levels of CRP compared with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. The association
between men gender and higher severity of COVID-19 disease is observable by the
higher proportion of men (72.9%) with severe COVID-19 disease in comparison with
women. Age, body mass index, Shannon’s diversity index, comorbidities (hypertension
and diabetes) and antibiotic therapy (at least once prior 6 months before COVID-19)
were not significantly different between mild-to-moderate and severe patients.
Regarding antibiotic therapy during the course of COVID-19, this variable was not
significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (OR = 2.05; 95% CI [0.55-7.73];
p=0.287).

In the multivariate model that was mutually adjusted for CRP, Shannon’s diversity
index, age and antibiotic therapy 6 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, the variables
CRP and Shannon’s diversity index were significantly associated with COVID-19
severity while gender was no longer significantly associated (Table 2). Accordingly, the
probability of having severe disease is 3.45 times higher when CRP levels ≥96.8 mg/L.
Likewise, the probability of having severe COVID-19 symptoms is 2.85 times higher
when Shannon’s diversity index is lower than 2.25. The geographic areas of the
participating centres did not have impact on our multivariate regression model showing
that disease severity and Shannon’s diversity index outcomes are centre-independent.

The discriminative/predictive power of the model was evaluated by the ROC-receiver
operating characteristic-curve analysis. The receiver operating characteristics curve
(ROC) analysis revealed an acceptable discriminative power of the model, with an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.707 (95% CI, 0.600–0.814) (Figure S1). Furthermore, our
model correctly predicts 56.4% and 78.9% of patients with mild-to-moderate and severe
disease, respectively.

Faecal microbiota profile in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 in faeces
Regarding that some authors suggest that faecal microbiota alterations are associated
with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract (18, 19, 24), we analyse
for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces. Sufficient amount of good quality
faecal RNA to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 112 patients (97.4%) among 115 recruited
patients. From the 112 samples analysed, 45 tested positive (40% of the COVID-19
patients). Interestingly, the virus was detected mostly in men than in women (61.3% and
38.7% respectively, p<0.05). We then investigated if the presence of the virus in faeces
was associated with changes in gut microbiota composition. As depicted in Figures 3A,
no major differences were found in the distribution of the most abundant phyla and
genera between patients positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 in faeces.
Subsequently, we assessed the association between the faecal SARS-CoV-2 positivity
and COVID-19 severity score or location of recovery using Pearson’s chi-square test.
Importantly, no association was verified between the two categorical variables (p-value
is 0.31 and 0.57 for severity score and location of recovery, respectively). Nevertheless,
we found a strong tendency for a lower Shannon’s diversity index in faeces of SARSCoV-2 positive patients (p=0.06) (Figure 3B).

Discussion
We conducted a multicentre prospective cross-sectional study with 115 COVID-19
patients of different COVID-19 severity stages under the hypothesis that gut microbiota
dysbiosis plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 namely in the
severity of its clinical course.

In order to determine the association between the gut microbiota composition and
COVID-19 disease severity, clinical and 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from
COVID-19 patients were analysed and subsequently clustered according with: i)
severity of COVID-19 using the WHO Clinical Progression Scale i.e. mild, moderate or
severe; and ii) location of recovery from COVID-19 i.e. ambulatory, hospitalized in
ward or ICU. Our data show for the first time an inverse association between relative
bacterial abundance at genus level and Shannon’s index diversity with COVID-19
disease severity. According with our multivariable model, CRP  96.8 mg/L and
Shannon’s diversity index <2.25 were associated with higher severity (a score of 6 or
more in COVID-19 WHO clinical progression scale) suggesting that these patient’s
variables are predictors for severe COVID-19. Indeed, our multivariable model
correctly predicts 79% of patients with severe COVID-19.

Interestingly, faecal SARS-CoV-2 is detected in COVID-19 patients that tend to have
lower Shannon’s diversity (p=0.06). We did not detect an association between the faecal
SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity score (p=0.31), however we cannot
exclude that negative faecal SARS-CoV-2 patients could become positive during
COVID-19 disease progression.

In comparison with mild COVID-19 patients, the gut microbiota from moderate and
severe COVID-19 patients tend to have: 1) decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio
(0.68 in mild compared to 0.65 and 0.58 in moderate and severe COVID-19,
respectively); 2) higher abundance in Proteobacteria; (3% in mild compared to 12 and
14% in moderate and severe COVID-19, respectively); 3) lower abundance of butyrateproducing bacteria from Lachnospiraceae family in particular Roseburia and
Lachnospira genera; and 4) lower abundance of Actinobacteria phylum namely
Bifidobacteria and Collinsella genus. All these alterations are well-known microbial
signatures of dysbiosis in gut microbiota (25-28).

Commensal bacteria play a fundamental role in the homeostasis of both immune and
inflammatory functions of the gut (29). Anaerobic bacteria from Lachnospiraceae
family such as Roseburia and Lachnospira genera produce butyrate, a short-chain fatty
acid known to exert anti-inflammatory effects in the intestinal epithelium (30). Despite
not being butyrate producers themselves, Bifidobacterium species are able to cross-feed
butyrate-producing bacteria through the secretion of fermentation end-products such as
acetate (31). This may constitute a potential mechanism by which Bifidobacterium
species (32, 33) counteract intestinal viral infections. Another mechanism might be
related with their capacity to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma) and increase the production of
anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukins 4 and 10) (34). Taking all this into
consideration, we propose that changes in gut microbiota composition observed in
severe COVID-19 patients may eventually act as a trigger to promote mucosal
inflammation and increased gut permeability to proinflammatory molecules.
Consequently, this may induce a state of systemic inflammation since these patients

exhibited higher levels of blood CRP, a recently recognized prognostic factor for
COVID-19 severity (35). Likewise, blood CRP concentrations ≥96.8 mg/L is associated
with a score of 6 or more in COVID-19 WHO clinical progression scale in accordance
with our multivariate model. The increase of Proteobacteria, a proposed signature of
disease (36) particularly of epithelial dysfunction (37), in severe COVID-19 patients
sustains our observation of a relation between dysbiosis microbiota and severity of
COVID-19 disease.

Interestingly, the COVID-19 men patients seemed more prone to severe disease when
compared with COVID-19 women (p=0.032). This gender discrepancy that has been
described in other clinical trials (38), might be explained by a higher expression of
ACE2 (39) in intestinal epithelial cells. This protein receptor is required for SARSCoV-2 binding, invasion and persistence in host epithelial cells (40). Furthermore,
COVID-19 patients that tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV2 in faeces were
mostly men (p<0.05) which reinforces the involvement of intestinal ACE2 in the
severity of the course of the disease.

Our findings are consistent with two previous cross-sectional studies with COVID-19
patients carried on Hong Kong (China) (18, 19). The similarity of our results, collected
in Portugal (a south-western European country), with the geographically far distant
Chinese population led us to conclude that gut microbiota dysbiosis is a bona fide
predictor of COVID-19 disease severity and the microbiome-based risk stratification
should be considered for management of SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility, in
parallel with worldwide-scale vaccination against COVID-19. Thus, our study open
perspectives for the development of therapeutic interventions that aim to correct

dysbiosis in severe COVID-19 patients. These include, dietary modifications,
administration of butyrate-producing probiotics or prebiotics and faecal microbiota
transplantation from healthy donors (41), shown to be effective in recurrent Clostridium
difficile infection (42). These interventions are expected to increase overall bacterial
diversity and the abundance of commensal bacteria, thereby contributing to inhibit the
overgrowth of bacteria from Proteobacteria phylum.

In summary, we revealed for the first time an association between the gut microbiota
and WHO Clinical Progression Scale, which reflects patient trajectory during COVID19 disease. Our data show that gut microbiota dysbiosis is present in moderate and
severe COVID-19 patients in comparison with asymptomatic/mild patients.
Importantly, the evidence from this study suggests that CRP and gut microbiota
diversity are prognostic biomarkers for severe COVID-19. Notwithstanding, a crosssectorial study including a larger population size is necessary to produce a more
powerful multivariable logistic regression model.

Patients were classified in accordance with the WHO Clinical Progression Scale. This scale provides a measure of illness severity across a range from 0 (not infected with SARS-CoV-2) to 10
(dead). Patients were grouped in three categories: mild disease (score 1-3), moderate disease (score 4-5), and severe disease (score 6-9). aKruskal-Wallis test. bChi-square test. IQR, interquartile

Figure 1. Comparison of COVID-19 gut microbiome with COVID-19 severity. Disease
severity was determined according with the WHO Clinical Progression Scale: mild,
moderate and severe. (A) Heat tree visualization of the taxonomic differences between
the COVID-19 severity groups based on Log2 ratio median abundance (proportions), in
which the terminal nodes correspond to bacterial genera. The identification of the nodes
is shown in the left-bottom image. Three comparisons were done: severe (blue-green)
versus mild (orange); severe (blue-green) versus moderate (orange); and ultimately,
moderate (blue-green) versus mild (orange). The dominant colour corresponds to a
higher number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs); Log2 ratio is 0 (grey colour)
when the compared groups are similar. (B) Shannon diversity index (mean + SEM) of
COVID-19 patients according to WHO Clinical Progression Scale, from score 1
(asymptomatic; viral RNA detected) to score 9 (mechanical ventilation pO2/FiO2 <150
and vasopressors, dialysis, or ECMO).

according to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples.

Figure 4. Schematic representation of the predictive microbial fingerprint for COVID19 severity. Pre-existent influences on the microbiota, such as lifestyle and
environmental factors, as well as antibiotics can induce dysbiosis (red arrow) leading to
increased inflammation (e.g. CRP levels). Hence, a lower overall microbial diversity
and abundance of beneficial commensal microorganisms (e.g. Roseburia), along with
increased abundance of Proteobacteria are associated with severe COVID-19 severity (a
score of 6 in WHO clinical progression scale). CRP, C-reactive protein.
