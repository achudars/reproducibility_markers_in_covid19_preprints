Abstract:
The sudden global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 urgently requires an in-depth understanding of
molecular functions of viral proteins and their interactions with the host proteome. Several omics
studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology, including some focused on
proteomic aspects1–3. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses manipulate the host
we here characterized interactome, proteome and signaling processes in a systems-wide manner. This
identified connections between the corresponding cellular events, revealed functional effects of the
individual viral proteins and put these findings into the context of host signaling pathways. We
investigated the closely related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses as well as the influence of
SARS-CoV-2 on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived
human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed
relationships between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 infection at different layers
and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of SARS coronaviruses. The results
highlight the functionality of individual proteins as well as vulnerability hotspots of SARS-CoV-2,
which we targeted with clinically approved drugs. We exemplify this by identification of kinase
inhibitors as well as MMPase inhibitors with significant antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.

Main text:
To identify interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with cellular proteins, we transduced A549
lung carcinoma cells with lentiviruses expressing individual HA-tagged viral proteins (Figure 1a;
Extended data Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 1). Affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry
analysis (AP-MS) and statistical modelling of the MS1-level quantitative data allowed identification
of 1484 interactions between 1086 cellular proteins and 24 SARS-CoV-2 and 27 SARS-CoV bait
proteins (Figure 1b; Extended data Fig. 1b; Supplementary Table 2). The resulting virus-host
interaction network revealed a wide range of cellular activities intercepted by SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV (Figure 1b; Extended data Table 1; Supplementary Table 2). In particular, we discovered

that SARS-CoV-2 targets a number of key cellular regulators involved in innate immunity (ORF7bMAVS, -UNC93B1), stress response components (N-HSPA1A) and DNA damage response mediators
(ORF7a-ATM, -ATR) (Figure 1b; Extended data Fig. 1c - e). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 interacts with
specific protein complexes contributing to a range of biological processes (Supplementary Table 2).
To evaluate the consequences of these interactions on cellular proteostasis, we proceeded with the total
proteome analysis of A549 cells expressing the 54 individual viral proteins (Figure 1a, d;
Supplementary Table 3). The analysis of the proteome changes induced by each viral protein and
consideration of the interactions of this respective protein provided direct insights into their functions.
For instance, we confirmed that ORF9b of SARS-CoV-2 leads to a dysregulation of mitochondrial
functions (Figure 1d; Supplementary Table 3), as was previously reported for SARS-CoV4, correlating
with the binding of ORF9b of both viruses to TOMM70 (Figure 1b; Supplementary Table 2)1, a
known regulator of mitophagy5, which was not yet known for SARS-CoV ORF9b. Importantly, this
approach identified novel SARS-CoV-2 activities, such as the regulation of proteins involved in
cholesterol metabolism by NSP6 (Figure 1d; Supplementary Table 3). Despite the high similarity of
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV6, these datasets allow to discriminate the commonalities and differences
of both viruses, which may in part explain the characteristics in pathogenicity and transmission
capabilities. By comparing the AP-MS data of homologous SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV proteins,
we identified significant differences in the enrichment of individual host targets, highlighting potential
virus-specific interactions (Figure 1b (edge color); Figure 1c; Extended data Fig. 1f - h;
Supplementary Table 2). For instance, we could recapitulate the known interaction between SARSCoV NSP2 and prohibitins (PHB, PHB2)7, whereas their enrichment was not observed for NSP2 of
SARS-CoV-2 (Extended data Fig. 1g). Alternatively, we found that ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2, but not its
SARS-CoV homolog, binds specifically to the TGFB1-LTBP1 complex (Extended data Fig. 1f, h).
To obtain information on the concerted activity of the viral proteins during infection, we infected
ACE2-expressing A549 cells (Extended data Fig. 2a-b) with SARS-CoV-2, and profiled the impact of
viral infection on mRNA transcription, protein abundance, ubiquitination and phosphorylation in a
time-resolved manner (Figure 2a – e; Supplementary Tables 4 - 7; Methods). In line with previous
reports8,9, we did not observe major upregulation of type-I interferons and related genes at the mRNA

level (e.g. IFNB, IFIT3, MX1; Extended data Fig. 2c – d; Supplementary Table 4), suggesting active
viral inhibition of this system. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 upregulated NF-κB and stress responses, as
inferred from the induction of IL6, CXCL2 and JUNs and transcription factor enrichment analysis
(Extended data Fig. 2c – e; Supplementary Tables 4, 8; Methods). At the proteome level, we found
1053 regulated proteins (Figure 2a - b). Most notably, SARS-CoV-2 infection failed to induce an
interferon response pattern indicative for an appropriate cellular antiviral response in this dataset
(Extended data Fig. 2f; Supplementary Table 5). We complemented these data with global MS
analysis of protein ubiquitination, which revealed 884 sites that were differentially regulated after
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2a and c, Extended data Fig. 2f; Supplementary Table 6). A number of
proteins displayed both differential abundance and dynamic ubiquitination patterns in an infectiondependent manner (e.g. mediators of caveolar-mediated endocytosis signaling) (Figure 2c; Extended
data Fig. 2f; Supplementary Tables 5, 6, 8). Notably, EFNB1, POLR2B, TYMS and DHFR showed
concomitant ubiquitination and a decrease at the protein level (Figure 2c; Extended data Fig. 2f;
Supplementary Tables 5, 6). Moreover, we identified two upregulated ubiquitination sites on ACE2,
including one previously unknown (K702) (Figure 2c; Extended data Fig. 2f - i), suggesting an
alternative post-translational mechanism of its degradation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection besides the
cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases10,11. We identified multiple yet undescribed ubiquitination sites
on viral proteins, which may be tied to the interactions with several E3 ligases observed in the
interactome (e.g. ORF3 and TRIM47, WWP1/2, STUB1; M and TRIM7; NSP13 and RING1)
(Extended data Fig. 2j; Supplementary Table 2, 6) and likely indicative of cross-talks between
ubiquitination and viral protein functions. Moreover, in the phosphoproteomic analysis, we mapped
multiple novel phosphorylation sites on viral proteins (M, N, S and ORF9b), which correspond to
known recognition motifs of GSK3, CSNKs, GPCR, AKT, CAMKs, and ERKs (Extended data Fig.
2k; Supplementary Table 7). Of 11,847 total quantified phosphorylation sites, 1483 showed significant
changes after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Extended data Fig. 2l; Supplementary Table 7). The regulation
of known phosphosites suggests an involvement of central kinases known to modulate key cellular
pathways, e.g. EPHA2 – focal adhesion, RPS6Ks – cell survival, CDKs – cell cycle progression, AKT
– cell growth, survival and motility, p38, JNK, ERK – stress responses, ATM, and CHEK1/2 – DNA

damage response, during virus infection (Extended data Fig. 2l, m; Supplementary Tables 7, 8).
Intriguingly, we could also observe an interplay of phosphorylation and ubiquitination on YAP1, a
downstream regulatory target of Hippo signaling (Figure 2d), underlining the value of testing different
post-translational modifications simultaneously. Combining these datasets, describing different aspects
of SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowed us to determine the key pathways perturbed during the infection,
such as stress and DNA damage response, regulation of transcription and cell junction organization, at
various levels (Figure 2e, see Methods).
The systematic interactome and proteome profiling of individual viral proteins provided us with the
opportunity to gain deeper understanding of their molecular mechanisms. For each viral protein, we
mapped the collected data onto the global network of cellular interactions12 and applied a network
diffusion approach13. Such analysis identifies short links of known protein-protein interactions,
signaling and regulation events that connect the interactors of the viral protein with the proteins
affected by its expression (Figure 3a, Extended data Fig. 3a, b; Supplementary Data 1).The
connections predicted using the real data were significantly shorter than for the randomized data,
confirming both relevance of the approach and the data quality (Extended data Fig. 3a, b). Amongst
many other findings, this approach pointed towards the potential mechanisms of autophagy regulation
by ORF3 and NSP6; the modulation of innate immunity by M, ORF3 and ORF7b; and the IntegrinTGFβ -EGFR-RTK signaling perturbation by ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3b - d, Supplementary
Data 1). Enriching these subnetworks with the SARS-CoV-2 infection-dependent mRNA abundance,
protein abundance, phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Figure 3a) allowed us to gain unprecedented
insights into the regulatory mechanisms employed by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3e, Extended data Fig. 3c,
e). For instance, this analysis confirmed a role of NSP6 in autophagy14 and revealed a significant
inhibition of autophagic flux by ORF3 leading to the accumulation of autophagy receptors (SQSTM1,
GABARAPL2, NBR1, CALCOCO2, MAP1LC3B, TAX1BP1), also observed in virus-infected cells
(SQSTM1, MAP1LC3B) (Figure 3e - i). This inhibition may be explained by the interaction of ORF3
with the HOPS complex (VPS11, -16, -18, -39, -41), which is essential for autophagosome-lysosome
fusion, as well as by the differential phosphorylation of regulatory sites of key components (AKT1,
AKT1S1, SQSTM1, RPS6). The inhibition of the interferon response observed at transcriptional and

proteome levels was similarly explained by the network diffusion analysis (Extended data Fig. 3c),
demonstrating that multiple proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are employed in the disruption of antiviral
immunity. Additional functional experiments corroborated the inhibition of interferon induction or
signaling by ORF3, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF9b (Extended data Fig. 3d). Upon virus infection, we
observed upregulation of TGFβ and EGFR pathways, which modulate cell survival, motility and
innate immune responses (Extended data Fig. 3e - g). Besides promoting virus replication, activation
of these pathways has been implicated in fibrosis15,16, one of the hallmarks of COVID-1917.
Specifically, our network diffusion analysis revealed the connection between the binding of ORF8 and
ORF3 to TGFβ -associated factors (TGFB1, TGFB2, LTBP1, TGFBR2, FURIN, BAMBI) and the
virus-induced upregulation of fibrinogens, fibronectin, SERPINE1 and integrin(s) (Extended data Fig.
3e, h)18. The phosphorylation of SMAD1/5, and ERK, JNK, p38 cascade activation, as well as an
increased expression of MMPs, DUSPs, JUN, and EGR1 are indicative of TGFβ and EGFR pathway
regulation. In turn, they are known to be potentiated by the increased integrin signaling and activation
of YAP-dependent transcription19, which we observed upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Extended data
Fig. 3e).

Taken together, the viral-host protein-protein interactions and pathway regulations observed at
multiple levels identify potential vulnerability points of SARS-CoV-2 that could be targeted by wellcharacterized selective drugs for antiviral therapies. To test their antiviral efficacy, we established
time-lapse fluorescent microscopy of SARS-CoV-2 GFP-reporter virus infection20. Inhibition of virus
replication by type-I interferon treatment corroborated the necessity for SARS-CoV-2 to block this
pathway and confirmed the reliability of this screening approach (Figure 4a)9,21. We tested a panel of
48 drugs modulating the pathways perturbed by the virus for their effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication
(Figure 4b, Supplementary Table 9). Notably, B-RAF (Sorafenib, Regorafenib, Dabrafenib), JAK1/2
(Baricitinib) and MAPK (SB 239063) inhibitors, among others, led to a significant increase of virus
growth in our in vitro infection setting (Figure 4b, Extended data Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 9). In
contrast, inducers of DNA damage (Tirapazamine, Rabusertib) or the mTOR inhibitor (Rapamycin)
led to suppression of the virus. The highest antiviral effect was seen for Gilteritinib (a designated
FLT3/AXL

inhibitor),

Ipatasertib

metalloproteinases inhibitors) (Figure 4b - e, Extended data Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 9).
Remarkably, these compounds profoundly inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 while having no or
minor influence on cell growth (Extended data Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 9). These inhibitors may
perturb host pathways required by the virus or influence viral protein activity through posttranslational modifications. Notably, we identified AKT as a potential kinase phosphorylating SARSCoV-2 protein N (Extended data Fig. 2k), indicating the possibility of a direct influence of Ipatasertib
on the viral protein.
This drug screen demonstrates the value of our combined dataset that profiles the infection of SARSCoV-2 at multiple levels. Further exploration of these rich data by the scientific community and
investigating the interplay between different -omics levels will substantially advance our knowledge of
coronavirus biology, in particular on the pathogenicity caused by highly virulent strains such as
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

Moreover, this resource may streamline the search for antiviral

compounds and serve as a base for intelligent design of combination therapies that aim at targeting the
virus from multiple, synergistic angles, thus potentiating the effect of individual drugs while
minimizing side-effects on healthy tissues.

Material and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
HEK293T, A549, Vero E6 and HEK293R1 cells and their respective culturing conditions were
described previously22. All cell lines were tested to be mycoplasma-free. Expression constructs for Cterminal HA tagged viral ORFs were synthesised (Twist Bioscience and BioCat) and cloned into
pWPI vector as described previously23 with the following modifications: starting ATG codon was
added, internal canonical splicing sites were replaced with synonymous mutations and C-terminal HAtag, followed by amber stop codon, was added to individual viral open reading frames. C-terminally
hemagglutinin(HA)-tagged ACE2 sequence was amplified from an ACE2 expression vector (kindly
provided by Stefan Pöhlmann)24 into the lentiviral vector pWPI-puro. A549 cells were transduced
twice, and ACE2-expressing A549 (ACE2-A549) cells were selected with puromycin. Lentiviruses

production, transduction of cells and antibiotic selection were performed as described previously23.
RNA-isolation (Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin RNA plus), reverse transcription (TaKaRa Bio
PrimeScript RT with gDNA eraser) and RT-qPCR (Thermo-Fisher Scientific PowerUp SYBR green)
were performed as described previously25. RNA-isolation for NGS applications was performed
according to manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, RNase free DNase set). For detection
of protein abundance by western blotting, HA-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich), ACTB-HRP (Santa Cruz),
ATM, MAP1LC3B, MAVS, HSPA1A, TGFβ and SQSTM1, phospho-JNK (T183/Y185), JNK,
phospho-p38 (T180/Y182), p38 (Cell Signaling), SARS-CoV-2 (Sino Biological) antibodies were
used. For AP-MS and AP-WB applications, HA-beads (Sigma-Aldrich and Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and Streptactin II beads (IBA Lifesciences) were used. Secondary Abs: HRP and WB imaging was
performed as described previously25. For the stimulation of cells in the reporter assay, recombinant
human interferon-α (IFN-α) was a kind gift from Peter Stäheli, recombinant human IFN-γ were
purchased from PeproTech and IVT4 was produced as described before26. All compounds tested
during the viral inhibitor assay are listed in Suppl. Table 9.

Virus strains, stock preparation, plaque assay and in vitro infection
SARS-CoV-2-MUC-IMB-1 and SARS-CoV-2-GFP strains20 were produced by infecting Vero E6
cells cultured in DMEM medium (10% FCS, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin, 100 IU/ml Penicillin) for 2
days (MOI 0,01). Viral stock was harvested and spun twice (1000g/10min) before storage at 80°C.Titer of viral stock was determined by plaque assay. Confluent monolayers of VeroE6 cells were
infected with serial five-fold dilutions of virus supernatants for 1 h at 37°C. The inoculum was
removed and replaced with serum-free MEM (Gibco, Life Technologies) containing 0.5%
carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich). Two days post-infection, cells were fixed for 20 minutes at
room temperature with formaldehyde directly added to the medium to a final concentration of 5%.
Fixed cells were washed extensively with PBS before staining with H2O containing 1% crystal violet
and 10% ethanol for 20 minutes. After rinsing with PBS, the number of plaques was counted and the
virus titer was calculated.
A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2-MUC-IMB-1 strain (MOI 3) for the subsequent
experiments. At each time point, the samples were washed once with 1x TBS buffer and harvested in
SDC lysis buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.5; 4% SDC) or 1x SSB lysis buffer (62.5 mM Tris HCl pH
6.8; 2% SDS; 10% glycerol; 50 mM DTT; 0.01% bromophenol blue) or RLT (Qiagen) for proteomephosphoproteome-ubiquitinome,western blot, and transcriptome analyses, respectively. The samples
were heat-inactivated and frozen at -80°C until further processing, as described in the following
sections.
Affinity purification mass spectrometric analyses of SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV and HCoV
protein expressing A549 cells
For the determination of SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV and partial HCoV interactomes, four replicate
affinity purifications were performed for each HA-tagged viral protein. A549 cells (6×106 cells per 15cm dish) were transduced with HA-tagged SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV or HCoV protein coding
lentivirus and harvested three days post transduction. Cell pellets of two 15-cm dishes were lysed in
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) NP-40, 5% (v/v)
glycerol, cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 0.5% (v/v) 750 U/µl Sm DNAse) and
sonicated (5 min, 4°C, 30 sec on, 30 sec off, low settings; Bioruptor, Diagenode SA). Following
normalization of protein concentrations cleared lysates, virus protein-bound host proteins were
enriched by adding 50 µl anti-HA-agarose slurry (Sigma-Aldrich, A2095) with constant agitation for
3h at 4°C. Non-specifically bound proteins were removed by four subsequent washes with lysis buffer
followed by three detergent-removal steps with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM
NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol). Enriched proteins were denatured, reduced, alkylated and
digested by addition of 200 µl digestion buffer (0.6 M GdmCl, 1 mM TCEP, 4 mM CAA, 100 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 µg LysC (WAKO Chemicals), 0.5 µg trypsin (Promega) at 30°C overnight.

mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described previously22,23. Briefly, purified peptides were
loaded onto a 20cm reverse-phase analytical column (75µm diameter; ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ
1.9µm resin; Dr. Maisch) and separated using an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) with a 90 min gradient (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; 5% (80% acetonitrile) to 30%
for 65min, 30% to 95% for 10min, wash out at 95% for 5min, readjustment to 5% in 10min) at
a flow rate of 300 nlper min. Eluting peptides were directly analyzed on a Q-Exactive HF mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with data-dependent acquisition including repeating cycles of
one MS1 full scan (150-2,000m/z, R=60,000 at 200m/z) followed by 15 MS2 scans of the
highest abundant isolated and higher-energy collisional dissociation fragmented peptide precursors.
Proteome analyses of SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV and HCoV protein expressing cells
For the determination of proteome changes in A549 cells expressing SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV or
HCoV proteins, a fraction of 1×106 lentivirus-transduced cells from the affinity purification samples
were lysed in guanidinium chloride buffer (6 M GdmCl, 10 mM TCEP, 40 mM CAA, 100 mM TrisHCl pH 8), boiled at 95°C for 8 min and sonicated (10 min, 4°C, 30 sec on, 30 sec off, high settings).
Protein concentrations of cleared lysates were normalized to 50 µg and proteins were pre-digested
with 1 µg LysC at 37°C for 1h followed by a 1:10 dilution (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) and overnight
digestion with 1 µg trypsin at 30°C. Peptide purification on StageTips with three layers of C18
Empore filter discs (3M) and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described
previously22,23. Briefly, 300 ng of purified peptides were loaded onto a 50 cm reversed phase column
(75 μm inner diameter, packed in house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin [Dr. Maisch
GmbH]). The column temperature was maintained at 60°C using a homemade column oven. A binary
buffer system, consisting of buffer A (0.1% formic acid (FA)) and buffer B (80% ACN, 0.1% FA),
was used for peptide separation, at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. An EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), directly coupled online with the mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF-X, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) via a nano-electrospray source, was employed for nano-flow liquid chromatography.
Peptides were eluted by a linear 80 min gradient from 5% to 30% buffer B (0.1% v/v formic acid, 80%
v/v acetonitrile), followed by a 4 min increase to 60% B, a further 4 min increase to 95% B, a 4 min
plateau phase at 95% B, a 4 min decrease to 5% B and a 4 min wash phase of 5% B. To acquire MS
data, the data-independent acquisition (DIA) scan mode operated by the XCalibur software (Thermo
Fisher) was used. DIA was performed with one full MS event followed by 33 MS/MS windows in one
cycle resulting in a cycle time of 2.7 seconds. The full MS settings included an ion target value of 3 x
106 charges in the 300 – 1650 m/z range with a maximum injection time of 60 ms and a resolution of
120,000 at m/z 200. DIA precursor windows ranged from 300.5 m/z (lower boundary of first window)
to 1649.5 m/z (upper boundary of 33rd window). MS/MS settings included an ion target value of 3 x
106 charges for the precursor window with an Xcalibur-automated maximum injection time and a
resolution of 30,000 at m/z 200.
To generate the proteome library for DIA measurements purified peptides from the first replicates and
the fourth replicates of all samples were pooled separately and 25 µg of peptides from each pool were
fractionated into 24 fractions by high pH reversed-phase chromatography as described earlier27.
During each separation, fractions were concatenated automatically by shifting the collection tube
every 120 seconds. In total 48 fractions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in buffer A*
(0.3% TFA/ 2% ACN) and subsequently analyzed by a top12 data-dependent acquisition (DDA) scan
mode using the same LC gradient and settings. The mass spectrometer was operated by the XCalibur
software (Thermo Fisher). DDA scan settings on full MS level included an ion target value of 3 x 106
charges in the 300 – 1650 m/z range with a maximum injection time of 20 ms and a resolution of
60,000 at m/z 200. At the MS/MS level the target value was 105 charges with a maximum injection
time of 60 ms and a resolution of 15,000 at m/z 200. For MS/MS events only, precursor ions with 2-5
charges that were not on the 20 s dynamic exclusion list were isolated in a 1.4 m/z window.
Fragmentation was performed by higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision
energy of 27eV.

Frozen cell lysates of infected A549-ACE2 harvested at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30h post infection were
thawed on ice and boiled for 5 min at 95 degrees. Lysates were transferred to a 96-well plate (Covaris)
and sonicated for 5 min. Protein concentrations were estimated by tryptophan assay28 and protein
material was equalized to 200 µg per sample. CAA (10 mM) and TCEP (40 mM) along with trypsin
(1:100 w/w, Sigma-Aldrich) and LysC (1/100 w/w, Wako) were added to the samples that were
digested at 37°C overnight. Peptides were desalted using SDB-RPS cartridges (PreOmics).
Briefly, samples were mixed with 300 µl 1% TFA in isopropanol, loaded onto cartridges and washed
with 200 µl 1% TFA in isopropanol and 200 µl 0.2% TFA. Peptides were eluted with 150 µl of 1.25%
Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)/ 80% ACN and 10 µl aliquots were taken and dried separately for
global proteome analysis. The rest was dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge (Eppendorf, Concentrator
plus) and resuspended in 105 µl of equilibration buffer (1% TFA/ 80% ACN) for phosphopeptide
enrichment. The AssayMAP Bravo robot (Agilent) performed the enrichment for phosphopeptides by
priming AssayMAP cartridges (packed with 5 µl Fe(III)-NTA) with 1 % TFA in 99 % ACN followed
by equilibration in equilibration buffer and loading of peptides. Enriched phosphopeptides were eluted
with 1 % Ammonium hydroxide, dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 1 % FA buffer.
Evotips were activated by wetting in 40 ml 1-propanol in Evotipbox and subsequently washed with
100 µl of 0.1% FA. Peptides were loaded onto tips which were subsequently washed with 100 µl of
0.1 % FA. The tips were then loaded with 100 µl 0.1 % FA and centrifuged very shortly.
To generate the proteome library for DIA measurements cells were lysed in 4 % SDC and 100 mM
Tris pH 8.4, followed by sonication, protein quantification, reduction, and alkylation and desalting
using SDB-RPS cartridges (see above). 100 µg of peptides were fractionated into 24 fractions by high
pH reversed-phase chromatography as described earlier27. Fractions were concatenated automatically
by shifting the collection tube every 120 seconds and subsequently dried in a vacuum centrifuge and
resuspended in buffer A* (0.3% TFA/ 2% ACN).
To generate the library for phosphoproteome DIA measurements A549 cells were treated with 100
ng/ml Calyculin and 2 mM Sodium orthovanadate for 20 min. Cells were lysed and treated as for the
proteome library generation. After overnight digestion, peptides were desalted using Sepax Extraction
columns. 5.5 mg of desalted peptides were fractionated into 84 fractions on a C18 reversed-phase
column (4.6 x 150 mm, 3.5 µm bead size) under basic conditions using a Shimadzu UFLC operating at
1 ml/minute. Buffer A (2.5 mM Ammoniumbicarbonat in MQ) and Buffer B (2.5 mM ABC in 80%
CAN) were used to separate peptides on a linear gradient of 2.5% B to 44% B for 64 minutes and 44%
B to 75% B for 5 minutes before a rapid increase to 100% B which was kept for 5 minutes. Fractions
were subsequently concatenated into 24 fractions and lyophilized. Phosphopeptides of these 24
fractions were enriched using the AssayMAP Bravo robot and loaded on Evotips. Another 5.5 mg of
desalted peptides were split into 24 samples and enriched for phosphopeptides by the AssayMAP
Bravo robot. Eluted phoshopeptides were combined, dried and fractionated into 24 fractions by neutral
pH reversed-phase chromatography27. Fractions were dried and loaded on Evotips as described above.
Infected proteome-phosphoproteome-diGly-proteome (6 and 24hr)
Frozen cell lysates of infected A549-ACE2 harvested at 6 and 24h post infection were thawed on ice
and sonicated for 1 min (Branson Sonifierer). Protein concentrations were estimated by tryptophan
assay28. To reduce and alkylate proteins, samples were incubated for 5 min at 45°C with CAA and
TCEP, final concentrations of 10 mM and 40 mM, respectively. Samples were digested overnight at
37°C using trypsin (1:100 w/w, Sigma-Aldrich) and LysC (1/100 w/w, Wako).
For proteome analysis, 10 µg of peptide material were desalted using SDB-RPS StageTips (Empore)
(2). Briefly, samples were diluted with 1% TFA in isopropanol to a final volume of 200 µl and loaded
onto StageTips, subsequently washed with 200 µl of 1% TFA in isopropanol and 200 µl 0.2% TFA/
2% ACN. Peptides were eluted with 60 µl of 1.25% Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)/ 80% ACN and
dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge (Eppendorf, Concentrator plus). They were resuspended in buffer
A* prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Peptide concentrations were measured optically at 280nm (Nanodrop

LC-MS/MS analysis.
To generate phosphoproteome data, the EasyPhos protocol was used for the enrichment of
phosphopeptides29. Briefly, samples were adjusted with the lysis buffer to a volume of 300 µl,
transferred into a 96-deep-well plate and mixed with 100 µl 48% TFA, 8 mM KH2PO4.
Phosphopeptides were captured by 5 min incubation at 40°C with 5 mg TiO2 beads. Thereafter, beads
were washed 5 times with 5% TFA/ 60% isopropanol, followed by a transfer in 0.1% TFA/ 60%
isopropanol into C8 StageTips. Phosphopeptides were eluted twice with 30 µl 20% NH4OH/ 40%
ACN and concentrated for 30 min at 45°C using a SpeedVac centrifuge. Concentrated samples were
immediately diluted with 100 µl 1% TFA in isopropanol and transferred into SDB-RPS StageTips.
Peptides were washed, eluted and dried as described above. Dried peptides were resuspended in 6 µl
buffer A* and 5 µl was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.
For diGly peptide enrichment, samples were four-fold diluted with 1% TFA in isopropanol and loaded
onto SDB-RPS cartridges (Strata™-X-C, 30 mg/ 3 ml, Phenomenex Inc), pre-equilibrated with 4 ml
30% MeOH/1% TFA and washed with 4 ml 0.2% TFA. Samples were washed twice with 4 ml 1%
TFA in isopropanol, once with 0.2% TFA/ 2% ACN and eluted twice with 2 ml 1.25% NH4OH/ 80%
ACN. Eluted peptides were diluted with ddH2O to a final ACN concentration of 35%, snap frozen and
lyophilized. Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in IAP buffer (50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 10 mM
Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaCl) and the peptide concentration was estimated by tryptophan assay. K--GG
remnant containing peptides were enriched using the PTMScan® Ubiquitin Remnant Motif (K--GG)
Kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Crosslinking of antibodies to beads and subsequent
immunopurification was performed with slight modifications as previously described30. Briefly, two
vials of crosslinked beads were combined and equally split into 16 tubes (~31 µg of antibody per
tube). Equal peptide amounts (800 µg) were added to crosslinked beads and the volume was adjusted
with IAP buffer to 1 ml. After 1h of incubation at 4°C and gentle agitation, beads were washed twice
with cold IAP and 5 times with cold ddH2O. Thereafter, peptides were eluted twice with 50 µl 0.15%
TFA. Eluted peptides were desalted and dried as described for proteome analysis with the difference
that 0.2% TFA instead of 1%TFA in isopropanol was used for the first wash. Eluted peptides were
resuspended in 9 µl buffer A* and 4 µl was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.
DDA Measurements
Samples were loaded onto a 50 cm reversed phase column (75 μm inner diameter, packed in house
with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]). The column temperature was
maintained at 60°C using a homemade column oven. A binary buffer system, consisting of buffer A
(0.1% formic acid (FA)) and buffer B (80% ACN plus 0.1% FA), was used for peptide separation, at a
flow rate of 300 nl/min. An EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), directly coupled
online with the mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF-X, Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nanoelectrospray source, was employed for nano-flow liquid chromatography.
For proteome measurements, we used a gradient starting at 5% buffer B and stepwise increasing to
30% in 95 min, 60% in 5 min and 95% in 5 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in Top12 datadependent mode (DDA) with a full scan range of 300-1650 m/z at 60,000 resolution with an automatic
gain control (AGC) target of 3e6 and a maximum fill time of 20ms. Precursor ions were isolated with
a width of 1.4 m/z and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (NCE 27%).
Fragment scans were performed at a resolution of 15,000, an AGC of 1e5 and a maximum injection
time of 60 ms. Dynamic exclusion was enabled and set to 30 s.
For phosphopeptide samples 5µl were loaded and eluted with a gradient starting at 3% buffer B and
stepwise increased to 19% in 60 min, 41% in 30 min, 36% in 39 min and 95% in 5 min. The mass
spectrometer was operated in Top10 DDA with a full scan range of 300-1600 m/z at 60,000 resolution
with an AGC target of 3e6 and a maximum fill time of 120 ms. Precursor ions were isolated with a
width of 1.4 m/z and fragmented by HCD (NCE 28%). Fragment scans were performed at a resolution

of 15,000, an AGC of 1e5 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion was enabled
and set to 30 s.
For the analysis of K--GG peptide samples, we use a gradient starting at 3% buffer B and stepwise
increased to 7% in 6 min, 20% in 49 min, 36% in 39 min, 45% in 10 min and 95% in 4 min. The mass
spectrometer was operated in Top12 DDA with a full scan range of 300-1350 m/z at 60,000 resolution
with an AGC target of 3e6 and a maximum fill time of 20ms. Precursor ions were isolated with a
width of 1.4 m/z and fragmented by HCD (NCE 28%). Fragment scans were performed at a resolution
of 30,000, an AGC of 1e5 and a maximum injection time of 110 ms. Dynamic exclusion was enabled
and set to 15 s.
DIA Measurements
Samples were loaded onto a 15 cm reversed phase column (150 μm inner diameter, packed in house
with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm resin [Dr. Maisch GmbH]), which was kept in a homemade
column oven at 60°C. Peptides were separated by the Evosep One LC system using the preprogrammed 44 minutes gradient for proteome samples and the 21 minutes gradient for
phosphoproteome samples. The same gradients were used for the acquisition of proteome and
phosphoproteome library fractions. The Evosep One system was coupled to a Q Exactive HF-X
Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nano-electrospray source.
The proteome and phosphoproteome fractions we used to build the libraries were measured in DDA
mode. To acquire proteome fractions the mass spectrometer was operated in Top15 data-dependent
mode with a full scan range of 300-1650 m/z at 60,000 resolution, an automatic gain control (AGC)
target of 3e6 and a maximum fill time of 20ms. For the generation of the phosphoproteome library the
mass spectrometer was operated in Top12 data-dependent mode (DDA) with a full scan range of 3001650 m/z at 60,000 resolution, an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6 and a maximum fill time
of 25ms. For both libraries precursor ions were isolated with a width of 1.4 m/z and fragmented by
higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (NCE 27%). Fragment scans were performed at a
resolution of 15,000, an AGC of 1e5 and a maximum fill time of 28 ms. Dynamic exclusion was
enabled and set to 30 s for the proteome library and 20 s for the phosphoproteome library.
For proteome and phosphoproteome DIA measurements, full MS resolution was set to 60,000 with a
full scan range of 300-1650 m/z, a maximum fill time of 60 ms and an automatic gain control (AGC)
target of 3e6. One full scan was followed by 32 windows with a resolution of 30,000 and a maximum
fill time of 54 ms for proteome measurements and 40 windows for phosphoproteome measurements
with a resolution of 15,000 and maximum fill time of 28 ms in profile mode. Precursor ions were
fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (NCE 27%).
Data-processing of affinity purification, (phospho)proteome and ubiquitinome LC-MS/MS
analyses
Raw MS data files of experiments conducted in DDA mode were processed with MaxQuant (version
1.6.14) using the standard settings and label-free quantification enabled (LFQ min ratio count 1,
normalization type none, stabilize large LFQ ratios disabled). For profiling of post-translational
modifications, additional variable modifications for ubiquitination (GlyGly(K)) and phosphorylation
(Phospho(STY)) were added. Spectra were searched against forward and reverse sequences of the
reviewed human proteome including isoforms (UniprotKB, release 10.2019) and SARS-COV-2,
SARS-COV and HCoV proteins by the built-in Andromeda search engine31.
For AP-MS data, the alternative protein group definition was used: only the peptides identified in APMS samples could be regarded as protein group-specific, protein groups that differed by the single
specific peptide or had less than 25% different specific peptides were merged to extend the set of
peptides used for protein group quantitation and reduce the number of protein isoform-specific
interactions.

For the experiments conducted in DIA mode, Spectronaut version 13 (Biognosys) was used to
generate the proteome and phosphoproteome libraries from DDA runs by combining files of
respective fractionations using the human fasta file (Uniprot, 2019, 42,431 entries). For the generation
of the proteome library default settings were left unchanged. For the phosphoproteome library
generation 2 x 24 files received by both fractionation strategies were combined and phosphorylation at
Serine/Threonine/Tyrosine was added as variable modification to default settings. Maximum number
of fragment ions per peptide was increased from 6 to 25. Proteome DIA files were analyzed using the
proteome library with default settings and disabled cross run normalization. Phospho DIA files were
analyzed using the phosphoproteome library using default settings with disabled PTM localization
filter and cross run normalization. To search for viral proteins, we also generated the “hybrid” spectral
library by merging DDA proteome library with a direct-DIA library generated from the DIA analysis
of DIA proteome samples. For this search, the sequences of viral proteins were added to the human
fasta file.
Bioinformatic analysis
Unless otherwise specified, the bioinformatic analysis was done in R (version 3.6), Julia (version 1.4)
and Python (version 3.8) using a collection of in-house scripts (available upon request).

Statistical analysis of MS data
For all MS datasets, except DDA phosphoproteome and ubiquitinome data, the Bayesian linear
random effects models were used to define how the abundances of proteins change between the
conditions. To specify and fit the models we employed msglm R package
(https://github.com/innatelab/msglm), which depends on rstan package (version 2.19)32 for inferring
the posterior distribution of the model parameters. In all the models, the effects corresponding to the
experimental conditions have regularized horseshoe+ priors33, while the batch effects have normally
distributed priors. Laplacian distribution was used to model the instrumental error of MS intensities.
For each MS instrument used, the heteroscedastic intensities noise model was calibrated with the
technical replicate MS data of the instrument. These data were also used to calibrate the logit-based
model of missing MS data (the probability that the MS instrument will fail to identify the protein
given its expected abundance in the sample). The model was fit using unnormalized MS intensities
data. Instead of transforming the data by normalization, the inferred protein abundances were scaled
by the normalization multiplier of each individual MS sample to match the expected MS intensity of
that sample. This allows taking the signal-to-noise variation between the samples into account when
fitting the model. Due to high computational intensity, the model was applied to each protein group
separately. For all the models, 4000 iterations (2000 warmup + 2000 sampling) of the No-U-Turn
Markov Chain Monte Carlo were performed in 7 or 8 independent chains, every 4th sample was
collected for posterior distribution of the model parameters. For estimating the statistical significance
of protein abundance changes between the two experimental conditions, the P-value was defined as
the probability that a random sample from the posterior distribution of the first condition would be
smaller (larger) than a random sample drawn from the second condition. No multiple hypothesis
testing corrections were applied, since this is handled by the choice of the model priors.
Statistical analysis of AP-MS data and filtering for specific interactions
Given the sparsity of the AP-MS data (each peptide is quantified in a small fraction of experiments), to
take advantage of the missing data modeling by msglm, the statistical model was applied directly to
the MS1 intensities of protein group-specific LC peaks (evidence.txt table of MaxQuant output). In R
GLM formula language, the model could be specified as

where APMS effect models the average shift of intensities in AP-MS data in comparison to full
proteome samples, Bait is the average enrichment of a protein in AP-MS experiments of homologous
proteins of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and Bait:Virus corresponds to the virus-specific
changes in protein enrichment. MS1peak is the log-ratio between the intensity of a given peak and the
total protein abundance (the peak is defined by its peptide sequence, PTMs and the charge; it is
assumed that the peak ratios do not depend on experimental conditions34), and MSbatch accounts for
batch-specific variations of protein intensity. APMS, Bait and Bait:Virus effects were used to
reconstruct the batch effect-free abundance of the protein in AP-MS samples.
The modeling provided the enrichment estimates for each protein in each AP experiment. Specific APMS interactions had to pass the two tests. In the first test, the enrichment of the candidate protein in a
given bait AP was compared against the background, which was dynamically defined for each
interaction to contain the data from all other baits, where the abundance of the candidate was within
50%-90% percentile range (excluding top 10% baits from the background allowed the protein to be
shared by a few baits in the resulting AP-MS network). The non-targeting control and Gaussia
luciferase baits were always preserved in the background. Similarly, to filter out any potential sideeffects of very high bait protein expression, the ORF3 homologs were always present in the
background of M interactors and vice versa. To rule out the influence of the batch effects, the second
test was applied. It was defined similarly to the first one, but the background was constrained to the
baits of the same batch, and 40%-80% percentile range was used. In both tests, the protein has to be 4
times enriched against the background (16 times for highly expressed baits: ORF3, M, NSP13, NSP5,
NSP6, ORF3a, ORF7b, ORF8b, HCoV ORF4a) with the P-value ≤ 1E-3.
Additionally, we excluded the proteins that, in the viral protein expression data, have shown
upregulation, and their enrichment in AP-MS data was less than 16 times stronger than observed
upregulation effects. Finally, to exclude the carryover of material between the samples sequentially
analyzed by MS, we removed the putative interactors, which were also enriched at higher levels in the
samples of the preceding bait, or the one before it.
For the analysis of interaction specificity between the homologous viral proteins, we estimated the
significance of interaction enrichment difference (corrected by the average difference between the
enrichment of the shared interactors to adjust for the bait expression variation). Specific interactions
have to be 4 times enriched in comparison to the homolog with P-value ≤ 1E-3.
Statistical analysis of DIA proteome effects upon viral protein overexpression
The statistical model of the viral protein overexpression data set was similar to AP-MS data, except
that protein-level intensities provided by Spectronaut were used. The PCA analysis of the protein
intensities has identified that the 2nd principal component is associated with the batch-dependent
variations between the samples. To exclude their influence, this principal component was added to the
experimental design matrix as an additional batch effect.
As with AP-MS data, the two statistical tests were used to identify the significantly regulated proteins.
First, the absolute value of log2-fold change of protein abundance upon overexpression of a given viral
protein in comparison to the control samples had to be above 0.25 with P-value ≤ 1E-3. Second, the
protein had to be significantly regulated (same log2-fold change and P-value applied) against the
background distribution of its abundance in the selected experiments of the same batch (experiments,
where the tested protein abundance was within the 20%-80% percentile range of the whole batch, were
dynamically selected for each protein).
Statistical analysis of DDA proteome data of virus infection
For DDA proteome data the following linear model was used:

where after(24h) effect corresponds to the protein abundance changes in mock-infected samples that
happened between 6h and 24h, and treatment:after(ti) (ti=6,24) is the effect of interaction between the
SARS-CoV-2 infection and the timepoint, and corresponds to the changes in the virus-infected cells

Statistical analysis of DDA total proteome, phosphoproteome and ubiquitinome data 6 and 24
hours post SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549-ACE2 cells
The output of MaxQuant was analyzed with Perseus (version 1.6.14.0)36 and visualized with R
(version 3.6.0) and RStudio (version 1.2.1335). For total proteome analysis, detected protein groups
within the proteinGroups output table identified as known contaminants, reverse sequence matches,
only identified by site or quantified in less than 3 out of 4 replicates in at least one condition were
excluded. Following log2 transformation, missing values were imputed for each replicate individually
by sampling values from a normal distribution calculated from the original data distribution (width =
0.3×s.d., downshift = -1.8×s.d.). Differentially regulated protein groups between mock and SARSCoV-2 infection at 6 and 24 h.p.i. were identified via two-sided Student’s T-tests corrected for
multiple hypothesis testing applying a permutation-based FDR (S0 = 0.1; FDR < 0.05, 250
randomizations). Protein groups were further removed for statistical testing if not at least one T-test
condition contained a minimum of three non-imputed values. For phosphoproteome analysis,
phosphosites within the Phospho (STY)Sites output table identified as known contaminants, reverse
sequence matches or less than 0.75 localization probability were excluded. Following log2
transformation, phosphosite intensities were normalized based on sites that were quantified in at least
90% of all samples to account for technical variations. In detail, the median of phosphosite-specific
intensities across samples was subtracted from individual intensities to normalize for different
phosphosite abundances (row-wise normalization). Next, the median of normalized phosphosite
intensities per sample was used as final normalization factor and subtracted from individual nonnormalized phosphosite intensities (column-wise normalization). Phosphosites were further filtered for
quantification in at least 3 replicates and missing values were imputed for each replicate individually
by sampling values from a normal distribution calculated from the original data distribution (width =

0.3 × s.d., downshift = -1.8 × s.d.). Differentially regulated phosphosites between mock and SARSCoV-2 infection at 6 and 24 h.p.i. were identified via two-sided Student’s T-tests corrected for
multiple hypothesis testing applying a permutation-based FDR (S0 = 0.5; FDR < 0.05, 250
randomizations). Phosphosites were further removed from statistical testing if not at least one T-test
condition contained a minimum of 3 non-imputed values. For ubiquitinome analysis, ubiquitination
sites within the GlyGly (K)Sites output table were processed as mention for phosphosites, but
normalization for technical variation was based on ubiquitination sites quantified in more than 60% of
all samples. Differentially regulated ubiquitination sites between mock and SARS-CoV-2 infection at
6 and 24 h.p.i. were identified via two-sided Student’s T-tests corrected for multiple hypothesis testing
applying a permutation-based FDR (S0 = 0.1; FDR < 0.05, 250 randomizations) and removed from
statistical testing if not at least one T-test condition contained a minimum of 3 non-imputed values.
Annotation of detected protein groups, phosphosites and ubiquitination sites with GOBP, -MF, -CC,
KEGG, Pfam, GSEA, Keywords and Corum as well as PhosphoSitePlus kinase-substrate relations and
regulatory sites (version May 1st 2020)37 was performed in Perseus.
Transcriptomic analysis of SARS-COV-2 infected A549-ACE2 cells
A549-ACE2 cells used for transcriptional profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infection were cultured and
infected as described above. RNA isolation was performed using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturer's protocol with addition of a heat inactivation step after cell lysis. Library
preparation for bulk 3’-sequencing of poly(A)-RNA was done as described previously38. Briefly,
barcoded cDNA of each sample was generated with a Maxima RT polymerase (Thermo Fisher) using
oligo-dT primer containing barcodes, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and an adapter. 5’ ends of
the cDNAs were extended by a template switch oligo (TSO) and after pooling of all samples fulllength cDNA was amplified with primers binding to the TSO-site and the adapter. cDNA was
fragmented and TruSeq-Adapters ligated with the NEBNext® Ultra™ II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for
Illumina® (NEB) and 3’-end-fragments were finally amplified using primers with Illumina P5 and P7
overhangs. In comparison to Parekh et al.38 the P5 and P7 sites were exchanged to allow sequencing of
the cDNA in read1 and barcodes and UMIs in read2 to achieve better cluster recognition. The library
was sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina) with 75 cycles for the cDNA in read1 and 16 cycles for
the barcodes and UMIs in read2.
As for the analysis of the transcriptome data, Gencode gene annotations v28 and the human reference
genome GRCh38 were derived from the Gencode homepage (EMBL-EBI). Dropseq tool v1.1239 was
used for mapping raw sequencing data to the reference genome. The resulting UMI filtered count
matrix was imported into R v3.4.4. CPM (counts per million) values were calculated for the raw data
and genes having a mean cpm value less than 1 were removed from the dataset. Prior differential
expression analysis with DESeq2 v1.18.140, dispersion of the data was estimated with a parametric fit
using a multiplicative model where infection status (MOCK, virus infected) and time were
incorporated as covariates in the model matrix. The Wald test was used for determining differentially
regulated genes across timepoints in individual infection states and shrunk log2 fold changes were
calculated afterwards. Transcripts with low mean normalized count that were flagged by the
independent filtering procedure of DESeq2 were removed and those with absolute apeglm shrunk log2
fold change > 0.5 and the p-value < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed in distinct
conditions.
The data for this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI
under accession number PRJEB38744 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB38744).

(Takara). For relative transcript quantification PowerUp SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) was used.
Primer sequences can be provided upon request.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
We have used Gene Ontology, Reactome and other EnrichmentMap gene sets of human proteins41 as
well as protein complexes annotations from IntAct Complex Portal (version 2019.11)42 and CORUM
(version 2019)43.
To find the nonredundant collection of annotations describing the unique and shared features of
multiple experiments in a dataset, we have used Julia package OptEnrichedSetCover.jl
(https://github.com/alyst/OptEnrichedSetCover.jl), which employs evolutionary multi-objective
optimization technique to find a collection of annotation terms that have both significant enrichments
in the individual experiments and minimal pairwise overlaps.
For transcription factor enrichment analysis the significantly regulated transcripts were submitted to
ChEA3 web-based application44. Transcription factor – target gene set libraries from ENCODE were
used45. Transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome changes along with unchanged
transcripts/proteins/sites were submitted to the core ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)
(www.ingenuity.com).
The following cut-offs were used for differentially expressed transcripts: the absolute values of
apeglm-shrunk log2 fold change > 0.5, the p-value < 0.05. Transcripts with low mean normalized
count that were flagged by the independent filtering procedure of DESeq2 were removed prior
pathway analysis. The following cut-offs were used for differentially expressed proteins or regulated
sites: p-value <0.05 and absolute log2 fold change ≥ 0.5. Ingenuity knowledge base was used as a
reference dataset, only experimentally observed findings were used for confidence filtering,
additionally human species and A549-ATCC cell line filters were set. Input datasets were used to
identify the most significant canonical pathways and upstream regulators (in case of transcriptome).
Right-tailed Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg’s correction was used to calculate p-values,
which are presented in Supplementary Table 3.

Prediction of Functional Links between AP-MS and viral protein overexpression data
To systematically detect functional interactions, which may connect the cellular targets of each viral
protein with the downstream changes it induces on proteome level, we have used the network
diffusion-based HierarchicalHotNet method13 as implemented in Julia package HierarchicalHotNet.jl
(https://github.com/alyst/HierarchicalHotNet.jl). Specifically, for network diffusion with restart, we
used the ReactomeFI network (version 2019)12 of cellular functional interactions, reversing the
direction of functional interaction (e.g. replacing kinase→substrate interaction with
substrate→ kinase). The proteins with significant abundance changes upon bait overexpression
(|median(log2-fold change)| ≥ 0.25, P-value ≤ 1E-3 both in the comparison against the controls and
against the baits of the same batch) were used as the sources of signal diffusion with weights set to

P-value', and the restart probability was set to 0.4. To find the

optimal cutting threshold of the resulting hierarchical tree of strongly connected components (SCCs)
of the weighted graph corresponding to the stationary distribution of signal diffusion and to confirm
the relevance of predicted functional connections, the same procedure was applied to 1000 random
permutations of vertex weights as described in Reyna et al.13 (vertex weights are randomly shuffled
between the vertices with similar in- and out-degrees). Since cutting the tree of SCCs at any threshold
t (keeping only the edges with weights above t) and collapsing each resulting SCC into a single node

produces the directed acyclic graph of connections between SCCs, it allowed efficient enumeration of
the paths from the “source” nodes (proteins perturbed by viral protein expression with vertex weight
w, w ≥ 1.5) to the “sink” nodes (interactors of the viral protein). We have used this property of the tree
to calculate the average source-to-sink path length at each cutting threshold of the network diffusion
weighted graph. At each threshold t, the average path from source to sink nodes was calculated as:

where Nsrc is the number of “sources”, Nsink is the number of “sinks”, Ndis is the number of
disconnected pairs of sources and sinks, NSCC is the number of SCC at given threshold, LSCC(p) is the
number of SCCs that the given path p from source to sink goes through, and the sum is for all paths
from sources to sinks. For the generation of the diffusion network we have selected the topt threshold
that maximized the difference between the median of Lavg(t) for randomly shuffled data and Lavg(t) for
the real data.
Co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis
HEK293T cells were transfected with pWPI plasmid encoding single HA-tagged viral proteins, alone
or together with pTO-SII-HA expressing host factor of interest. 48 hours after transfection, cells were
washed in PBS, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until further processing. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously22,23. Briefly, cells were
lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) NP-40, 5%
(v/v) glycerol, cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 0.5% (v/v) 750 U/µl Sm DNAse) and
sonicated (5 min, 4°C, 30 sec on, 30 sec off, low settings; Bioruptor, Diagenode SA). HA or
Streptactin beads were added to cleared lysates and samples were incubated for 3h at 4°C under
constant rotation. Beads were washed six times in the lysis buffer and resuspended in 1x SDS sample
buffer 62,5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mM DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue).
After boiling for 5 minutes at 95°C, a fraction of the input lysate and elution were loaded on
NuPAGE™ Novex™ 4-12% Bis-Tris (Invitrogen), and further submitted to western blotting using
Amersham Protran nitrocellulose membranes. Imaging was performed by HRP luminescence (ECL,
Perkin Elmer).
SARS-CoV-2 infected A549-ACE2 cell lysates were sonicated (10 min, 4°C, 30 sec on, 30 sec off,
low settings; Bioruptor, Diagenode SA). Protein concentration was adjusted based on Pierce660 assay
supplemented with ionic detergent compatibility reagent. After boiling for 5 min at 95°C and brief
max g centrifugation, the samples were loaded on NuPAGE™ Novex™ 4-12% Bis-Tris (Invitrogen),
and blotted onto 0,22 µm Amersham™ Protran® nitrocellulose membranes (Merck). Primary and
secondary antibody stainings were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Imaging was performed by HRP luminescence using Femto kit (ThermoFischer Scientific) or Western
Lightning PlusECL kit (Perkin Elmer).
Reporter Assay and IFN Bioassay
The following reporter constructs were used in this study: pISRE-luc was purchased from Stratagene,
EF1-α-ren from Engin Gürlevik, pCAGGS-Flag-RIG-I from Chris Basler, pIRF1-GAS-ff-luc, pWPISMN1-flag and pWPI-NS5 (ZIKV)-HA was described previously23,46.
For the reporter assay, HEK293RI cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 hours prior to transfection.
Firefly reporter and Renilla transfection control were transfected together with plasmids expressing
viral proteins using polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences) for untreated and treated conditions. In 18
hours cells were stimulated for 8 hours with a corresponding inducer and harvested in the passive lysis
buffer (Promega). Luminescence of Firefly and Renilla luciferases was measured using dual-

luciferase-reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a microplate reader
(Tecan).
Total amounts of IFN-α/β in cell supernatants were measured by using 293T cells stably expressing
the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the mouse Mx1 promoter (Mx1-luc reporter cells)47.
Briefly, HEK293RI cells were seeded, transfected with pCAGGS-flag-RIG-I plus viral protein
constructs and stimulated as described above. Cell supernatants were harvested in 8 hour. Mx1-luc
reporter cells were seeded into 96-well plates in triplicates and were treated 24 hours later with
supernatants. At 16 hours post incubation, cells were lysed in the passive lysis buffer (Promega), and
luminescence was measured with a microplate reader (Tecan). The assay sensitivity was determined
by a standard curve.
Viral inhibitors assay
A549-ACE2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates in DMEM medium (10% FCS, 100 ug/ml
Streptomycin, 100 IU/ml Penicillin) one day before infection. Six hours before infection, or at the time
of infection, the medium was replaced with 100ul of DMEM medium containing either the compounds
of interest or DMSO as a control. Infection was performed by adding 10ul of SARS-CoV-2-GFP
(MOI 3) per well and plates were placed in the IncuCyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System where whole
well real-time images of mock (Phase channel) and infected (GFP and Phase channel) cells were
captured every 4h for 48h. Cell viability (mock) and virus growth (mock and infected) were assessed
as the cell confluence per well (Phase area) and GFP area normalized on cell confluence per well (GFP
area/Phase area) respectively using IncuCyte S3 Software (Essen Bioscience; version 2019B Rev2).
