Abstract

20

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be screened and diagnosed through the

21

detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by

22

real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid

23

amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to

24

clinical testing during the pandemic. However, studies evaluating the performance of

25

these NAAT assays are limited. We evaluated the performance of four NAATs, which

26

were marked by the Conformité Européenne and widely used in China during the

27

pandemic. Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was

28

significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of

29

detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies/mL,

30

whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies/mL. The results of the

31

consistency test using 46 samples showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs

32

could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 100%

33

(16 /16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100%

34

(30/30) and a sensitivity 81.25% (13/16). The sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT was

35

lower than that of the three other NAATs; this finding was consistent with the result

36

that Bioperfectus NAAT had a higher LOD than the three other kinds of NAATs. The

37

four above mentioned reagents presented high specificity; however, for the detection

38

of the samples with low virus concentration, Bioperfectus reagent had the risk of

39

missing detection. Therefore, the LOD should be considered in the selection of

40

SARS-CoV-2 NAATs.

Introduction

47

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly

48

since its recent identification in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China(1-3).

49

To date, SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 372,000 patients worldwide and

50

resulted in more than 16,000 deaths (as of March 24, 2020)(4). The World Health

51

Organization (WHO) has declared the Chinese outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019

52

(COVID-19) to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and stated

53

that the spread of COVID-19 may be interrupted by early detection, isolation, prompt

54

treatment, and the implementation of a robust system(4, 5). On March 11, at a regular

55

press conference in Geneva, WHO Director-General Tan Desai said that the

56

COVID-19 epidemic can be called a pandemic in terms of its characteristics.

57

Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses,

58

and new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop(6). Therefore,

59

early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to distinguish it from

60

asymptomatic, healthy, and other pathogenic infections and to ensure timely isolation

61

of the infected patients.

62
63

At present, various detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported,

64

such as real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay,

65

sequencing, CRISPR technique, nucleic acid mass spectrometry, and serum

66

immunology(7). However, real-time RT-PCR remains the primary means for

67

diagnosing COVID-19 among the various diagnostic platforms available. The

68

development of RT-PCR methods to diagnose COVID-19 mainly targets various

69

combinations of the open reading frame (ORF), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), spike

70

(S), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes(8-10).

71
72

Although real-time RT-PCR assay is a highly sensitive technique, false negative

73

results have still been reported in some COVID-19 patients. These results may occur

74

due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection,

75

transportation, storage, and handling, as well as laboratory test conditions and

76

personnel operation(11-13). Moreover, the quality of the examined regents is related

77

closely to the PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. In response to this outbreak, a number of

78

nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly developed in

79

China and quickly applied to clinical testing. To date, no quality evaluation of

80

SARS-CoV-2 NAATs has been reported.

81
82

The purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the performance of four

83

SARS-CoV-2 NAATs, which were Conformité Européenne (CE) marked and widely

84

used. The results of this study will be helpful for laboratorians to select the

85

appropriate assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

86
87

Materials and methods

88

Tested samples. The kit of performance verification reference materials, which were

89

cell cultures containing pseudoviruses, included 10 positive reference materials, two

90

negative reference materials, 18 analytical specificity reference materials, and three

91

interference reference materials (Guangzhou BDS Biological Technology Company

92

Limited).The positive quality control agents were made with cell cultures containing

93

SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses (Guangzhou BDS Biological Technology Company

94

Limited).The pseudoviruses in the positive quality control agents included segments

95

of the ORF1ab gene (the genome coordinates: 900–1500,12200–13500, 18770–18950,

96

and 20560–24453), N gene, and E gene, which were the important characteristic

97

genes of SARS-CoV-2. RNA transcripts, presented by the Chinese Academy of

98

Metrology, were used as standard materials. The RNA transcripts obtained the

99

complete N gene, the complete E gene, and ORF1ab gene segment (14911–15910,

100

GenBank No. NC_O45512) of SARS-CoV-2. The standard value of reference

101

material was obtained by absolute quantitative digital PCR. RNA was extracted from

102

cell cultures with the nucleic acid extraction reagent (Tianlong Technology Company

103

Limited), aliquoted into multiple tubes for testing with each NAAT method, and

104

stored at −80 °C.

105

Human samples (n = 46), which were RNA leftovers from daily laboratory activity,

106

were provided by the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine and

107

Hybribio Medical Laboratory. The selection of clinical samples used in the study was

108

exclusively based on their SARS-CoV-2 virus detection result. The study was

109

approved by the Ethics Committees from the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of

110

Chinese Medicine (ZE2020-027-01).

111
112

Assay and equipment. Four sets of systems were used to detect the SARS-CoV-2

113

virus: Daan SARS-CoV-2 NAAT on LightCycler 480 II PCR instrument (Daan

114

NAAT), Sansure SARS-CoV-2 NAAT on SLAN-96P PCR instrument (Sansure

115

NAAT), Hybribio SARS-CoV-2 virus NAAT on SLAN-96P PCR instrument

116

(Hybribio NAAT), and Bioperfectus SARS-CoV-2 NAAT on SLAN-96P PCR

117

instrument (Bioperfectus NAAT). Real-time PCR was applied to the four systems,

118

which targeted the combinations of the ORF1ab gene, N gene of SARS-CoV-2, and

119

endogenous gene of humans. About 5 µL of RNA was added to the PCR mixture and

120

tested according to the manufacturers’ instructions for each assay. Positive results

121

were defined as the simultaneous detection of the ORF1ab gene and N gene. The four

122

systems had different detection sites for the ORF1ab gene. The PCR primers designed

123

for the four systems were complementary to the sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic

124

sequence (GenBank No. NC_045512) in the region of 20700–21000 (Daan),

125

12500–13300 (Sansure), 13400–13550 (Bioperfectus), and 7100–7600 bp (Hybribio).

126

Cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal

127

to cross the threshold in RT-PCR) quantified viral load, with low values indicating a

128

high viral load.

129
130

Analytical Sensitivity. Analytical sensitivity was examined in accordance with a

131

modified EP17-A protocol, MM03 and MM19-A guidelines of Clinical Laboratory

132

Standards Institute (CLSI). The analytical sensitivity of each NAAT assay was

133

compared using the same RNA samples obtained from the extraction of mixed clinical

134

samples or positive quality controls. The concentrations of RNA samples were

135

determined by fluorescence quantitative method using standard materials as standard.

136

Serial dilutions were made with a known concentration of the target substance in the

137

analytical range of the expected limit of detection (LOD) and tested in replicates of 20.

138

All panel members were prepared at the same time, aliquoted into individual tubes for

139

each concentration and each assay, stored frozen, and thawed on the day of testing.

140

When 19 or all 20 replicates were positive, the concentration was temporarily defined

141

as LOD, followed by 20 replicates per day for two consecutive days, yielding a total

142

of 60 results. If more than 95% of the results were positive, the concentration was

143

finally determined as the LOD of the reagent. The experiments were spread over 3

144

days so that the standard deviations reflect the performance of the assay over a range

145

of typical laboratory conditions but without a change in reagent lots.

146
147

Precision. Precision was evaluated in accordance with a modified EP12 protocol，

148

MM09 and MM19-A guideline of CLSI using a patient RNA pool with concentration

149

above 20% of the LOD and the negative sample. Sample pools were divided into five

150

aliquots per level and frozen at −70 °C. One aliquot of each level was thawed daily

151

and analyzed four times per day during a period of five consecutive workdays (n = 20

152

per level). Precision was evaluated as the coefficient of variation (CV), which was

153

calculated from the data series mean and standard deviation.

154
155

Accuracy. Ten positive reference materials and two negative reference materials from

156

the performance verification reference material kit were used to evaluate accuracy.

157
158

Analytical specificity. Eighteen pseudovirus samples of analytical specificity

159

reference materials from the performance verification reference material kit were used

160

to determine the analytical specificity of four NAATs, including human coronavirus

161

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 RNA, HCoV-229E RNA, HCoV-NL63 RNA, SARS

162

RNA, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) RNA, influenza A HIN1 virus,

163

influenza B INFB virus, respiratory syncytial virus type A and type B, human

164

167
168

Analytical interferences. To investigate the analytical interferences, three

169

interference reference materials from the performance verification reference material

170

kit were used, including 6 g/dL hemoglobin, 30 g/dL albumin, and the mix of 100

171

µg/mL ribavirin and 100 µg/mL azithromycin. All tests were repeated three times.

172
173

Method comparison. Forty-six RNA samples from suspected patients with

174

COVID-19 were used in the method comparison. Given that no reference method was

175

used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of NAATs, the consensus result was

176

determined for each sample; samples were categorized as true positive (TP) if positive

177

by two or more assays (14). The SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were further

178

confirmed by sequencing.

179
180

Statistical analysis. The significance of the difference in sensitivity between the

181

NAATs was assessed by using Fisher’s exact test in GraphPad Prism (5.0). The

182

Chi-square likelihood ratio test was used to analyze the discordant results. The 95%

183

confidence intervals (CIs) for specificity and sensitivity were calculated by using the

184

Wilson–Score method in GraphPad Prism. Significant differences were considered at

185

P values less than 0.05.

186
187

Result

188

Analytical sensitivity. We evaluated the analytical sensitivity of each assay to

189

determine differences in the ability of each assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mixed

190

clinical samples or in pseudovirus cultures. First, we contrived RNA specimens from

191

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cultures at four separate final concentrations (500, 1000,

192

2000, and 3000 copies/mL). The ORF1ab gene test results of the serial dilutions were

193

all negative by the Hybribio and the Bioperfectus NAATs. Further investigation

194

revealed that the pseudoviral RNA did not contain the detecting locus of Hybribio and

195

Bioperfectus NAATs targeting the ORF1ab gene. Daan NAAT detected 18/20

196

replicates at 2000 copies/mL and 20/20 replicates at 3000 copies/mL. Sansure NAAT

197

detected 17/20 at 1000 copies/mL and 20/20 at 2000 copies/mL (Table 1). The final

198

results of 60 replicates showed that the LOD of Daan NAAT was 3000 copies/mL for

199

pseudovirus cultures, and the LOD of Sansure NAAT was 2000 copies/mL for

200

pseudovirus cultures.

201
202

To explore the LOD of the NAATs in clinical samples, we further contrived mixed

203

RNA specimens from clinical samples at three separate final concentrations (2000,

204

3000, and 4000 copies/mL). Daan NAAT detected 12/20 replicates at 2000 copies/mL

205

and 20/20 replicates at 3000 copies/mL (Table 1). Sansure NAAT detected 17/20 at

206

2000 copies/mL and 20/20 at 3000 copies/mL. Hybribio NAAT detected 10/20

207

replicates at 2000 copies/mL and 20/20 replicates at 3000 copies/mL. Bioperfectus

208

NAAT detected 10/20 at 3000 copies/mL and 20/20 at 4000 copies/mL. The final

209

results of 60 replicates showed that the LOD of clinical samples was 3000 copies/mL

210

by Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs, whereas that of clinical samples was 4000

211

copies/mL by Bioperfectus NAAT. The LODs declared in the instructions of Daan,

212

Sansure, Hybribio, and Bioperfectus NAATs were 500, 200,1000, and 1000

213

copies/mL, respectively.

214
215

Precision. For the negative sample, the 20 repeated test results by all four NAATs had

216

no amplification curve of target genes but a positive amplification curve of the

217

internal reference gene. For the positive sample, 20 repeated test results by all four

218

NAATs had positive amplification curves of the target genes and internal reference

219

gene. The within-run CVs at the concentrations above the 20% level of the LOD on

220

all four systems were less than 4%, and the total CVs were less than 5% (Table 2).

221
222

Accuracy. The results of all four NAATs for accuracy evaluation were in line with

223

expectations by using 10 positive reference materials and two negative reference

224

materials.

226

Analytical specificity. For the four assays, no amplification curves were obtained for

227

up to 10,000 copies/mL of six coronavirus pseudovirus samples with HCoV-OC43,

228

HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, SARS, and MERS RNA. For the 10

229

common respiratory pathogens and two human genomic DNA samples, all results of

230

the four assays were also negative.

231
232

Analytical interferences. An assessment of interferences is shown in Table 3. The

233

bias of Ct value for the N gene and ORF1ab gene on all four systems was less than

234

8.5% at the following interfering substance concentrations tested: 6 g/dL hemoglobin,

235

30 g/dL albumin, 100 µg/mL ribavirin, and 100 µg/mL azithromycin.

236
237

Comparison of the four NAATs. We defined consistency as two or more tests that

238

produce same results and used these results to define true positives and negatives. By

239

this definition, 34.8% (16/30) tested positive and 65.2% (30/46) tested negative. The

240

results for all four NAATs were negative for all 30 negative samples, and the 16

241

positive samples were reported positive by Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs.

242

However, three of the 16 positive samples were reported negative by Bioperfectus

243

NAAT (Table 4). The Ct values of the N gene and ORF1ab gene in the three positive

244

samples by Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs are shown in Table 5, and the Ct

245

values of the ORF1ab gene were close to the positive threshold of the three NAATs

246

declared in their instructions.

247
248

The sensitivity and specificity for each NAAT were calculated based on consistent

249

analysis. For Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs, their specificity and sensitivity

250

were 100%. For Bioperfectus NAAT, the sensitivity was 81.25% and specificity was

251

100%. No significant difference was found in the sensitivity between Bioperfectus

252

NAAT and the three other NAATs (P > 0.05).

256

experience in preventing the further spread of the disease in the past 2 months,

257

identifying COVID-19 from patients with other diseases as soon as possible has been

258

proven to be particularly important to execute early isolation and early treatment (4, 5,

259

15). The use of RT-PCR technology to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is an

260

effective means to screen SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected patients. The current

261

SARS-CoV-2 NAATs, which are widely used in China, were developed in response to

262

the emergency situation of screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The performance of

263

the assays is exactly what all testers want to know. In this study, four NAATs were

264

evaluated. The results showed that the LODs of the four assays were significantly

265

higher than the LODs declared in their instructions, suggesting that each laboratory

266

should re-evaluate the LOD of the reagents depending on the needs of their laboratory.

267

The RNA detection data from pseudovirus cultures showed that the LOD of Sansure

268

was slightly lower than that of Daan NAAT. The RNA detection data from clinical

269

samples showed that the LOD of Bioperfectus NAAT was slightly higher than that of

270

the three other reagents but still reached the detection sensitivity of 20 copies per PCR

271

reaction. There was no significant difference in the LOD of SARS-CoV-2 virus

272

between pseudovirus cultures and clinical samples for Daan and Sansure NAATs.

273

Thus, pseudovirus cultures could be used as an alternative for clinical samples in the

274

performance evaluation of LOD. In addition, the four assays showed high precision,

275

and the CV value was less than 5% when the concentration was 20% higher than the

276

LOD. There were no cross-reactions by the four assays with four common human

277

coronaviruses, SARS, and MERS viruses and no cross-reaction with other common

278

respiratory pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza virus,

279

and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

280
281

In the present study, we further compared four NAATs for the detection of

282

SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples from suspected COVID-19 patients. Results showed

283

that the clinical sensitivity and specificity of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs

284

were 100%, while three of the positive samples were missed by Bioperfectus NAAT.

286

and Hybribio reagents were all close to 40, indicating that the concentration of the

287

three samples may be lower than the LOD of Bioperfectus. Therefore, the LOD

288

should be included in the reference index when selecting reagents for SARS-CoV-2 in

289

the laboratory. Sequencing verification of the PCR-positive samples in this study

290

suggested that the four assays did not show false positives in the detection of limited

291

clinical samples. Although the small clinical sample size limited the optimal

292

evaluation of the performance of these assays, the results of this study can still help

laboratories to select an appropriate SARS-CoV-2 NAAT supplier and interpret their

294

detection results.

295
296

Obtaining high-quality viral RNA from original clinical samples is crucial to ensure

297

the accuracy of the detection results by NAATs. Therefore, the poor quality of

298

extraction reagents and the unoptimized extraction process of viral RNA would affect

299

the detection results. In this study, the performance of NAATs was evaluated by using

300

the same viral RNA samples. Therefore, the difference in the experimental results

301

only reflected the difference in the performance of nucleic acid amplification for

302

NAATs but not the diversity in the performance of the whole SARS-CoV-2 detection

303

system, which usually includes the nucleic acid extraction system.

304
305

In addition, RNA viruses may show substantial genetic variability. This could result in

306

mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence, which can

307

diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results. Therefore, the

308

manufacturer of NAATs should pay attention to the sequence update information of

309

the virus database at any time to ensure no mutation exists in the genome sequences

310

corresponding to the primers, especially for the sequences corresponding to the 3' end

311

of the primers.

312
313

In summary, the four SARS-CoV-2 NAATs commonly used with commercial assays

314

showed good reliability, but the actual LOD was significantly higher than the declared

315

LOD. The analytic sensitivity of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was slightly
