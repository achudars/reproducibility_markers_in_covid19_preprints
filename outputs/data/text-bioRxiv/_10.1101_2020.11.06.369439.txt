A BSTRACT
Inhibiting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is of great interest in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic
caused by the virus. Most efforts have been centred on inhibiting the binding site of the enzyme.
However, considering allosteric sites, distant from the active or orthosteric site, broadens the search
space for drug candidates and confers the advantages of allosteric drug targeting. Here, we report the
allosteric communication pathways in the main protease dimer by using two novel fully atomistic
graph theoretical methods: Bond-to-bond propensity analysis, which has been previously successful in
identifying allosteric sites without a priori knowledge in benchmark data sets, and, Markov transient
analysis, which has previously aided in finding novel drug targets in catalytic protein families. We
further score the highest ranking sites against random sites in similar distances through statistical
bootstrapping and identify four statistically significant putative allosteric sites as good candidates for
alternative drug targeting.

Introduction

The global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is caused by the newly identified virus SARS-CoV-2
[1, 2, 3, 4], a member of the coronavirus family of enveloped, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses that
also includes the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003 [5]. Since
coronaviruses have been known to infect various animal species and share phylogenetic similarity to pathogenic human
coronaviruses, the potential of health emergency events had already been noted [6]. However, their high mutation rate
similarly to other RNA viruses [7] made the development of long lasting drugs challenging. Developing therapeutics
against coronaviruses is of renewed interest due to the ongoing global health emergency.
One of the main approaches for targeting coronaviruses is to inhibit the enzymatic activity of their replication machinery.
The main protease (Mpro ), also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro ), is the best characterised drug target owing to its
crucial role in viral replication [8, 9, 10]. The Mpro is only functional as a homodimer and the central part of the active
or orthosteric site is composed of a cysteine-histidine catalytic dyad [11] (see Fig. S1B) which is responsible for
processing the polyproteins translated from the viral RNA [12].
The Mpro of the new SARS-CoV-2 shares 96% sequence similarity with that of SARS-CoV, which also extends to
a high structural similarity (r.m.s deviation of 0.53 Å between C↵ positions) [11]. Moreover, many of the residues
which are important for catalytic activity, substrate binding and dimerisation are conserved between these species [13].
Nevertheless, focusing on the mutations from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, several are located at the dimer interface
(for a full list see Table S1) and it has also been suggested that the mutations Thr285Ala and Ile286Leu (see Fig. S1)

are responsible for a closer dimer packing [11]. Previous mutational studies on these positions in SARS-CoV Mpro have
revealed an impact on catalytic activity [14].
Currently, the development of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors [11, 15, 16, 17], similarly to designing other coronavirus
Mpro inhibitors [18, 19, 20], focuses on blocking the orthosteric sites to disrupt viral replication (reviewed in Ullrich &
Nitsche [21]). Targeting the active site enables high affinity of the drug molecules but could result in off-target-based
toxicity when binding to proteins with similar active sites. Drug resistance is another major concern, especially when
the active site may potentially alter owing to mutations. Targeting an allosteric site which is distal from the main
binding site provides an alternative attractive solution by increasing both the range and selectivity of drugs to fine-tune
protein activity without the aforementioned disadvantages. (For reviews and recent successes see Wenthur et al. and
Cimermancic et al. [22, 23]). To the best of our knowledge, there is to date no indication of such putative allosteric
sites of the coronavirus Mpro s in the literature other than a recent implication of potential allosteric regulation of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [24] and simulated binding events to distant areas of the protein [25]. Encouragingly, however, there
have been indications of allosteric processes mediated by the extra domain in the SARS-CoV Mpro [26, 27, 28, 14].
Here, we focus on investigating the allosteric properties of the protease and in particular whether there are indeed any
strongly connected allosteric sites to the active site that may offer alternative ways to inhibit the virus reproduction.
Despite being an attractive drug alternative approach, the identification of allosteric sites remains challenging and is
still often done serendipitously. Computational prediction and description of allosteric sites has become an active field
of research for allosteric drug design (for reviews see [29, 30]) as it does not require the laborious and time-consuming
compound screening process. For example, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations model proteins at the atomic level
and the communication pathways detected can be exploited for allosteric residue and site identification [31, 32]. To
alleviate the substantial computational resources required by MD simulations and the inability to explore all the required
scales involved, variations of normal mode analysis (NMA) of elastic network models (ENM) are widely applied and
have achieved moderate accuracy in allosteric site detection when tested on known allosteric proteins [33, 34, 35, 36].
The field of methods for allosteric pathway or site prediction is continuously growing, with new methods ranging from
statistical mechanical models [37, 38] to methods based on graph theory [39]. However, even if they overcome the
computational resource requirement of atomistic MD, they do so at the cost of resolution by looking at coarse-grained
structure representations.
To overcome these limitations, we recently introduced a range of methods based on high resolution atomistic graph
analysis which are computationally efficient while at the same time provide insights into the global effects on a protein
structure without a priori guidance. These computational frameworks retain key physico-chemical details through the
derivation of an energy-weighted atomistic protein graph from structural information which incorporates both covalent
and weak interactions which are known to be important in allosteric signalling (hydrogen bonds, electrostatics and
hydrophobics) through interatomic potentials [40, 41, 42]. Based on this atomistic graph, Bond-to-bond propensity
analysis quantitatively shows how an energy fluctuation in a given set of bonds significantly affects any other bond
in the graph and provides a measure for instantaneous connectivity. Unlike most graph or network approaches, it is
formulated on the bonds or edges of the graph and thus makes a direct link between energy and flow through bonds of
the system [43]. It has been shown that Bond-to-bond propensities are capable of successfully predicting allosteric
sites in a wide range of proteins without any a priori knowledge other than the active site [43]. Of particular relevance
to the homodimeric protease studied here, it has been subsequently used to show how allostery and cooperativity
are intertwined in multimeric enzymes such as the well studied aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) [44]. A
complementary methodology, Markov transient analysis, further sheds light on the catalytic aspects of allostery and
obtains the pathways implicated in allosteric regulation through the transients of the propagation of a random walker
on the node space of the atomistic graph [41]. Crucially, while most methods obtain the shortest or optimal path, the
method takes into account all possible pathways, as allosteric communication is known to involve multiple paths [45].
In doing so, Markov transient analysis has been successful in identifying allosteric paths in caspase-1 [41] as well as
previously unknown allosteric inhibitor binding sites in p90 ribosomal s6 kinase 4 (RSK4) which complemented drug
repurposing in lung cancer [46]. These two methods are complementary in their application as they have been shown
to provide different insights based on the underlying allosteric mechanisms: Bond-to-bond propensity analysis gives
insights into the structural connectivity while Markov transient analysis is better suited for the catalytic and time scale
dependent aspects of a protein.
We here showcase the application of these methodologies in the setting of COVID-19. We analysed the SARS-CoV-2
main protease and obtained Bond-to-bond propensities for all bonds as well as Markov transient half-times t1/2 for
all atoms. Our results shed light on the allosteric communication patterns in the Mpro dimer. They further highlight
the role of the interface and capture how the subtle structural changes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 affect
their dimerisation properties. By applying a rigorous scoring procedure to our results, we identify four statistically
significant hotspots on the protein which are strongly connected to the active site and propose that they hold potential

The first step in our graph analysis approach is the construction of an atomistic graph from a protein data bank (PDB)
[47] structure. This process takes into account strong and weak interactions like hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions (see Methods and Fig. 4). Additionally, we can incorporate water molecules, which in the
case of the Mpro are catalytically important and known to expand the catalytic dyad to a triad [11] (see Fig. S1B). In
this analysis, we use the structures of the apo form of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV main proteases which are
deposited with PDB identifier 6Y2E [11] and 2DUC [48], respectively. Once the atomistic graph is constructed, we
use Bond-to-bond propensities and Markov transients to complementary explore the connectivity within the proteins
when sourced from relevant residues. To achieve this, Bond-to-bond propensity explores the instantaneous strength
of communication of a perturbation to every bond in the protein which allows to identify allosteric sites [43] and
investigate concepts like cooperativity in multimeric proteins [44]. Markov transients exploit the time evolution of
a diffusion process on the atomistic graph to identify groups of atoms which are reached the fastest (i.e. allosteric
sites) or form a communication pathway [41]. By applying quantile regression we are able to quantitatively rank all
bonds, atoms and subsequently residues. This allows to score the hotspots we identified and statistically prove their
significance.

Figure 1 provides detailed insights into the Bond-to-bond propensity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro when sourced
from the active site residues histidine 41 and cysteine 145 in both monomers. The top scoring residues (see Table S2)
reveal two main areas of interest in the Mpro . The hotspot on the back of the monomer opposite to the active site (Fig.
1A) is described in more detail in the paragraphs below. Hotspot two is located in the dimer interface and contains
four residues which form salt bridges between the two monomers. Serine 1 and arginine 4 from one monomer connect
to histidine 172 and glutamine 290 from the other one, respectively. Interestingly, these bonds have been found to be
essential for dimer formation which in turn is required for Mpro activity [49, 27].

Identification and scoring of putative allosteric sites.

Bond-to-bond propensities have been shown to successfully detect allosteric sites on proteins [43] and we here present
the results in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to that effect. By choosing the active site residues histidine 41 and cysteine 145 as
source, we can detect areas of strong connectivity towards the active centre which allows us to reveal putative allosteric
sites. We could detect two hotspots on the protease which might be targetable for allosteric regulation of the protease
(Fig. 2). Most of the residues present in the two putative sites are amongst the highest scoring residues which are listed
in Table S2. Site 1 (Fig. 2A shown in yellow) which is located on the back of the monomer in respect to the active
site and is formed by nine residues from domain I and II (full list in Table S4). The second hotspot identified with
Bond-to-bond propensities is located in the dimer interface and contains 6 residues (Tab. S5) which are located on both
monomers (Fig. 2B shown in pink). Two of these residues, Glu290 and Arg4 of the respective second monomer, are
forming a salt bridge which is essential for dimerisation [27]. Quantile regression allows us to rank all residues in the
protein and thus we can score both sites with an average residue quantile score as listed in Table 2. Site 1 and 2 have a
high score of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively and score much higher than a randomly sampled site would score with 0.53
(95% CI: 0.53-0.54) for a a site of the size of site 1 or 0.52 (95% CI: 0.51-0.53) for a site of the size of site 2.
Our methodologies further allow to investigate the reverse analysis to assess the connectivity of the predicted allosteric
sites. For this purpose, we defined the source as all residues within the respective identified sites (Tables S4 and S5).
After a full Bond-to-bond propensity analysis and quantile regression to rank all residues, we are able to score the active
site to obtain a measure for the connectivity towards the catalytic center (Tab. S8). For site 1 the active site score is 0.64
which is above a randomly sampled site score of 0.47 (95% CI:0.47-0.48). However, for site 2 the active site score is
0.49 which is only marginally above a randomly sampled site score of 0.48 (95% CI:0.47-0.48). As site 2 is located in

the dimer interface, this is in line with the above described suggestion that the allosteric effect is not directly conferred
from the dimer interface towards the catalytic centre. Nonetheless, this site might provide scope for inhibiting the Mpro
by disrupting the dimer formation at these sites.

Overall, this missing bi directional connectivity hints to a more complex communication pattern in the protein and gave
us reason to utilize another tool which has been shown to be effective in catalytic frameworks [41] like the protease.
Markov transients reveal fast signal propagation which happens often along allosteric communication pathways within
the protein structure. The top scoring residues with a QS > 0.95 in a Markov transient analysis sourced from the active
site residues are shown in Figure 3A and a full list can be found in Table S3. In the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro , this analysis
subsequently led to the discovery of two more putative sites as shown in Figure 3C. Both hotspots are located on the
back of the monomer in relation to the active site. Site 3 (shown in turquoise in Figure 3C) is located solely in domain
II and consists of ten residues as listed in Table S6. One of which is a cysteine at position 156 which might provide
a suitable anchor point for covalent drug design. Site 4 (orange in Figure 3C) is located further down the protein in
domain I with 11 residues as listed in Table S7. Both sites were scored as described above and in the Methods section.
Both sites have high average residue quantile scores of 0.87 (Tab. 2) which are significantly higher than the random site
scores of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.49-0.50) and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.49-0.50), respectively.
Following the same thought process as described for site 1 and 2, we can investigate the protein connectivity from the
opposite site by sourcing our runs from the residues in site 3 and 4. We then score the active site to measure the impact
of the putative sites on the catalytic centre (Tab. S8). For site 3, the active site has an average residue quantile score
of 0.66 in comparison to a random site score of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.52-0.53) which indicates a significant catalytic link
between site 3 and the active site. For site 4 (as for site 2) the scores are similar to a randomly sampled score, which
means that we do not detect a significant connectivity from this site to the active site. Judging from previous experience

in multimeric proteins this might be due to another structural or dynamic factor which we did not yet uncover between
site 4 and the active site.
Overall we see a similar pattern of hot and cold spots in the SARS-CoV Mpro (results not shown). We find a high
overlap for the identified four sites which gives us confidence, that a potential drug effort would find applications in
COVID-19 as well as SARS. To provide a first indication of the druggability of the identified sites, we chose to align the
fragments identified in the Diamond Light Source XChem fragment screen [50] with our sites. The screen identified 25
fragments which bind outside of the active site and 15 of these bind within 4 Å of any of the four putative allosteric sites.
Due to the computational efficiency of our methodologies we were able to conduct a full analysis of all 15 structures
and ran our methods from the fragments as source sites. We subsequently scored the active sites in each run (full data in
Table S9) and found that the fragment deposited with the PDB identifier 5RE8 might be of particular interest as it has
the highest connectivity to the active site. Moreover, one of the fragments within 4 Å of site 1 with the PDB identifier
5RGJ, has been shown to inhibit the proteolytic activity of the Mpro [24] and possesses a relatively high connectivity to
the active site.

Discussion

During the global pandemic of COVID-19 that has started in January 2020, we have seen an increase of research
activities to develop new drugs against the disease causing virus SARS-CoV-2. A wide range of approaches from
chemistry, structural biology and computational modelling have been used to identify potential protease inhibitors.
However, most of these initiatives focus on investigating the active site as a drug target [11, 16], high-throughput
docking approaches to the active site [15] or re-purposing approved drugs [51] and protease inhibitors [52] which bind
at the active site.
To increase the targetable space of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and allow a broader approach to inhibitor discovery,
we provide a full computational analysis of the protease structure which gives insights into allosteric signalling and
identifies potential putative sites. Our methodologies are based on concepts from graph theory and the propagation of
perturbations and fluctuations on a protein graph. We have previously demonstrated the applications of Bond-to-bond
propensities and Markov transients in identifying allosteric sites and communication pathways in a range of biological
settings [41, 43, 44, 46]. Applying Bond-to-bond propensities on the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro gave us important insights into
connectivity of the protein and highlighted residues at the dimer interface. We further explored the interface residues in
comparison with the SARS-CoV protease as dimerisation is known to be essential for the proteolytic activity [14] and
might provide scope for inhibitor development [53]. Important for the dimer packing and mutated in SARS-CoV-2
are residues 285 and 286 [11]. When sourced from these residues, we find a higher proportion of dimer interface
residues within the top 20 scoring residues for SARS-CoV-2 which confirms a stronger dimer connectivity as described
in literature [11]. Although we could not identify the direct link between the mutated residues and the active site on an
atomistic level here, we assume that further systematic studies of the residues at the dimer interface would provide
clarity.
This gave us confidence to further explore the SARS-CoV-2 protease with our methodologies. Using the above described
approaches we have identified four allosteric binding sites on the protease. We describe the location of the sites and
possible implications for the proteolytic activity of the protein. Site 1 and 2 have been identified using Bond-to-bond
propensities and hence have a strong instantaneous connectivity to the active site. Sourced from both sites, we noticed
that site 1 is directly connected to the active site, which is detected with a score above a randomly sampled site score
(0.64 > 0.47) while site 2 is indirectly connected to the active site with a active site score only slightly above that of
a random site (0.49 > 0.48). This suggests that site 1 might be a functional site and any perturbation at site 1 would
induce a structural change of the protease thereby impacting the active site directly. Indeed, a fragment near site 1 has
been shown to exhibit some inhibitory effect on the Mpro in a recent study [24]. Notably, site 2, although not directly
coupled to the active site as a functional site, is located in the dimer interface (Fig. 2B) and provides a deep pocket for
targeting the protease and maybe disrupting dimer formation. Targeting site 2 could result in a conformation change of
the protease and inhibition of dimerisation.
The sites identified with Markov transients are reached the fastest by a signal sourced from the active site and are both
located at the back of each monomer in relation to the active site. Site 3 is assumed to be directly coupled to the active
site as seen from the score of the active site (0.66 > 0.53) and perturbation at site 3 would thus affect the catalytic
activity of Mpro . Besides, Site 3 (Fig. 3C) contains a cysteine residue (Cys156) which provides an anchor point for
covalently binding inhibitors [54]. Similar to site 2, site 4 is not directly connected to the active site. Effects exerted at
site 4 could affect other parts of the protein which in turn lead to an altered activity of Mpro .
We also include the analysis of 15 structures containing small fragments from a recent Diamond Light Source XChem
fragment screen [50] which bind in proximity to the putative sites. We scored the active site (His41 and Cys145) using
these fragments as the source. The active site score is analysed rigorously with a structural bootstrap to compare the
effect of each fragment on the protease. Some fragments have a direct link to the active site and have been recently
investigated in experimental studies [24] and might provide a first starting point for rational drug design.

240

Together our methods provide in depth insights into the global connectivity of the main protease. By taking our results
into consideration we hope to broaden the horizon for targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. This will aid in the
development of effective medications for COVID-19.

Methods

Protein Structures. We analysed the X-ray crystal structures of the apo conformations of the SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID:
6Y2E [11]) and the SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 2DUC [48]) main proteases (Mpro ). All residues of the Mpro proteins that are
mutated between the two viruses are listed in Table S1. Both structures contained a water molecule in proximity to
the catalytic dyad formed by histidine 41 and cysteine 145. These water molecules were kept while all other solvent
molecules were removed. Atom and residue, secondary structural names and numberings are in accordance with the

original PDB files. The dimer interface was investigated using the online tool PDBePISA [55] (for a full list of the
resulting dimer interface residues see https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12815903).
Atomistic Graph Construction. In contrast to most network methods for protein analysis, we derive atomistic
protein graphs obtained from the three-dimensional protein structure and parameterise with physico-chemical energies,
where the nodes of the graph are the atoms and the weighted edges represent interactions, both covalent bonds and
weak interactions, including hydrophobic, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (See Fig. 4). Details of this approach can be
found in Refs [40, 41, 43]. We summarise the main features below and note three additional improvements, namely, in
the stand-alone detection of edges without need of third-party software, the many-body detection of hydrophobic edges
across scales, and, the computational efficiency of the code. For further details for the atomistic graph construction used
in this work see [56, 42].
Figure 4 gives an overview of the workflow where we start from atomistic cartesian coordinates from PDB files. Since
X-ray structures do not include hydrogen atoms and NMR structures may not report all of them , we use Reduce [57] to
add any missing hydrogens. Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds are identified with a cutoff of 8 Å and 0.01
kcal/mol respectively. The edges are weighted by their energies: covalent bond energies from their bond-dissociation
energies [58], hydrogen bonds and salt bridges by the modified Mayo potential [59, 60] and hydrophobic interactions
are calculated using a hydrophobic potential of mean force [61].

Figure 4: Atomistic Graph Construction. We showcase the general procedure here on the main protease of SARS-Cov-2: Atomic
coordinates are obtained from the PDB (ID: 6Y2E [11] and hydrogens are added by Reduce [57]. Edges are identified and the
weights are assigned, as described in the methods section, by taking into account covalent bonds as well as weak interactions:
hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and the hydrophobic effect which are coloured as indicated.

Bond-to-bond Propensities. Bond-to-bond propensity analysis was first introduced in Ref. [43] and further discussed
in Ref. [44], hence we only briefly summarise it here. This edge-space measure examines and exhibits the instantaneous
communication of a perturbation at a source towards every bond in the protein. The edge-to-edge transfer matrix M
was introduced to study non-local edge-coupling and flow redistribution in graphs [62] and an alternative interpretation
of M as a Green function is employed to analyse the atomistic protein graph. The element Mij describes the effect that
a perturbation at edge i has on edge j. M is given by

where B is the n ⇥ m incidence matrix for the atomistic protein graph with n nodes and m edges; W = diag(wij ) is an
m ⇥ m diagonal matrix which possesses all the edge interaction energies with wij as the weight of the edge connecting
nodes i and j, i.e. the bond energy between the atoms; and L† is the pseudo-inverse of the weighted graph Laplacian
matrix L [63] and defines the diffusion dynamics on the energy-weighted graph [64].

Markov Transient Analysis (MTA). A complementary, node-based method, Markov Transient analysis (MTA)
identifies areas of the protein that are significantly connected to a site of interest, the source, such as the active site, and
obtains the signal propagation that connects the two sites at the atomistic level. The method has been introduced and
discussed in detail in Ref. [41] and has successfully identified allosteric hotspots and pathways without any a priori
knowledge [41, 46]. Importantly, it captures all paths that connect the two sites. The contribution of each atom in the
communication pathway between the active site and all other sites in a protein or protein complex is measured by the
characteristic transient time t1/2 ,

where t1/2 is the number of time steps in which the probability of a random walker to be at node i reaches half the
stationary distribution value. This provides a measure of the speed by which perturbations originating from the active
site diffuse into the rest of the protein by a random walk on the above described atomistic protein graph. To obtain the
transient time t1/2 for each residue, we take the average t1/2 over all atoms of the respective residue.
Quantile Regression (QR). To determine the significant bonds with high bond-to-bond propensity and atoms with
fast transient times t1/2 at the same geometric distance from the source, we use conditional quantile regression (QR) [65],
a robust statistical measure widely used in different areas [66]. In contrast to standard least squares regressions, QR
provides models for conditional quantile functions. This is significant here because it allows us to identify not the
"average" atom or bond but those that are outliers from all those found at the same distance from the active site and
because we are looking at the tails of highly non-normal distributions.
As the distribution of propensities over distance follows an exponential decay, we use a linear function of the logarithm
of propensities when performing QR while in the case of transient times which do not follow a particular parametric
dependence on distance, we use cubic splines to retain flexibility. From the estimated quantile regression functions, we
can then compute the quantile score for each atom or bond. To obtain residue quantile scores, we use the minimum
distance between each atom of a residue and those of the source. Further details of this approach for Bond-to-bond
propensities can be found in Ref. [43] and for Markov Transient Analysis in Ref. [67].
Site scoring with structural bootstrap sampling. To allow an assessment of the statistical significance of a site of
interest, we score the site against 1000 randomly sampled sites of the same size. For this purpose, the average residue
quantile score of the site of interest is calculated. After sampling 1000 random sites on the protein, the average residue
quantile scores are calculated. By performing a bootstrap with 10,000 resamples with replacement on the random sites
average residue quantile scores, we are able to provide a confidence interval to assess the statistical significance of the
site of interest score in relation to the random site score.
Residues used when scoring the active site. For scoring the active site as a measure of the connectivity towards the
main binding site, we use all non-covalent hits bound in the active site from the XChem fragment screen against the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [50] . The 22 found structures were further investigated using PyMol v.2.3 [68] for residues which
have atoms within 4Å of any of the bound fragments. These residues are Thr25, Thr26, His41, Cys44, Thr45, Ser46,
Met49, Tyr54, Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Ser144, Cys145, Met162, His163, His164, Met165, Glu166, Leu167, Pro168,
Asp187, Arg188, Gln189, Thr190 and constitute the active site as a site of interest in all scoring calculations.
XChem fragment screen hits selection. From the above mentioned XChem fragment screen against the SARSCoV-2 Mpro [50], 25 hits were found at regions other than the active site. The 15 fragments which contain atoms that
are within 4Å from any of the putative allosteric site residues we obtained were selected as candidates for further
investigation as shown in Table 3.
For each of these fragment-bound structures, we performed Bond-to-bond propensity and Markov transient analyses to
evaluate the connectivity to the active site. The active site was scored as described above.
