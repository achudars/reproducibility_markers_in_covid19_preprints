Abstract
Background: There is a crucial need for effective therapies that are immediately available to counteract COVID-19 disease. Recently,
ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous
immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were
tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy. Methods:
The neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU)
and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction
neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic/cytotoxic method
(calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%). Results: All IVIG preparations showed neutralization of
both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and
PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Conclusion:
In cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are
currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.

mild symptoms. However, about 20% of COVID-19 patients
can progress to severe pneumonia and to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) which is associated with multiorgan failure and death 1. The current critical situation
demands an effective and reliable therapy that is immediately
available to control the progression of the disease.

(either polyvalent IG prepared from healthy donors or
hyperimmune IG prepared from donors with high antibody
titers against a specific antigen) have been historically used as
a readily available therapeutic option in outbreaks of emerging
or re-emerging infections 2.
To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been
identified. Four of them are endemic and globally distributed
(HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) 3.
These viruses typically cause mild symptoms and are
associated with about 15% of common colds 4 . However, the
three other human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2) are zoonotic epidemic viruses that can
cause severe respiratory infections and fatalities. Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in
China in 2002 with the last reported case in 2014. Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in
Saudi Arabia a decade later, in 2012, and led to an outbreak in
South Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV still emerges sporadically
in humans from its reservoir in camelids 5-7. More recently
(December 2019), the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2
emerged in China and because of its extraordinary human-tohuman transmissibility is currently causing an unprecedented
pandemic 8. Although several therapeutic approaches against
SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation, therapeutic agents of
proven efficacy are still lacking. Interestingly, coronaviruses
share some morphological and functional properties that may
be associated with cross-reactive immune responses. This
cross-reactivity may have important therapeutic implications 9.
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV are classified
within the family Coronaviridae, genus Betacoronavirus,
subgenera Sarbecovirus (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) and
Merbecovirus (MERS-CoV). The spike protein (S), which is
exposed on the virion surface, is the main determinant of the
coronavirus entry into the host cell and is also the major target
of neutralizing antibodies 10. Spikes are formed by trimers of
protein S, which is in turn formed by subunit (S1) that
mediates the binding to the cell receptor and a membraneanchored subunit (S2) that mediates the fusion of the virus
with cell membranes 11. Potent neutralizing antibodies often
target the receptor interaction site on S1. However, the S1
subunit shows a higher variability than S2. Antibodies
targeting S1 are often virus-specific making S2 a better target
for cross-neutralizing antibodies 12,13.
The amino-acid sequence identity among the S proteins of
human betacoronaviruses causing mild (HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-HKU1) and severe (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and
MERS-CoV) respiratory infections varies between 22% and
33% 10. However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 share 77% amino-acid identity 14 and more than 90%
RNA sequence homology 15. Cross-reactivity in antigenic
responses has been described among human coronaviruses of
the same genus, particularly betacoronaviruses. Crossreactivity between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other

endemic human coronaviruses has been reported in some
neutralization assays 16-18.
Recently, cross-reactivity in ELISA binding assays against
antigens of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV has
been reported with currently available intravenous
immunoglobulins (IVIG) such as Gamunex-C and
Flebogamma DIF 19. In this study, the neutralization capacity
of the IVIG products Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF
against these epidemic human coronaviruses ‒SARS-CoV,
SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV‒ was evaluated.

Material and Methods
Experimental products
IVIG products used in this study were Flebogamma® DIF
5% and 10% (Instituto Grifols S.A., Barcelona, Spain) and
Gamunex®-C 10% (Grifols Therapeutics Inc., Raleigh NC,
USA), two highly purified (≥ 98%-99%IgG), unmodified
human immunoglobulins. Each product is manufactured from
plasma collected from thousands of donors in the US and/or
several European countries. IgG concentrations in
Flebogamma DIF products were 50 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL
(5% and 10%) and in Gamunex-C, the concentration was 100
mg/mL (10%). To ensure a virus-free product, both IVIG
manufacturing processes contain dedicated steps with high
pathogen clearance capacity, such as solvent/detergent
treatment, heat treatment, caprylate treatment and Planova™
nanofiltration down to 20 nm pore size. The plasma used to
manufacture the IVIG lots tested was collected from March
2018 to October 2019.

Study design
Six different lots of Flebogamma DIF and Gamunex-C were
tested at several dilutions for cross-reactivity against SARSCoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV by: i) ELISA
techniques; and ii) well-stablished neutralization assays in cell
cultures. Lots were identified as F1 and F2 for Flebogamma
5% DIF, F3 and F4 for Flebogamma 10% DIF and G1 and G2
for Gamunex-C. Each experiment was performed in duplicate.
Handling of viruses and cell cultures was carried out at the
Level 3 Biosafety Laboratories in the Centro Nacional de
Biotecnología - Consejo Superior de Investigaciones
Científicas (CNB-CSIC; Madrid, Spain) and the Institut de
Recerca i Tecnologia Agroalimentàries - Centre de Recerca
en Sanitat Animal (IRTA-CReSA; Barcelona, Spain),
following the centers’ biohazard safety guidelines and under
authorizations #A/ES/00/I-8 and #SA-10430-20, respectively.

determinations were carried out following the manufacturer’s

Cell lines and cultures
Neutralization assay for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (MAD6
isolate) and MERS-CoV

Huh7 is a well differentiated human hepatocyte-derived
carcinoma cell line, kindly provided by Dr. Luis Carrasco
(Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa - Consejo
Superior de Investigaciones Científicas [CBMSO-CSIC],
Madrid, Spain). Huh7 is composed of epithelial-like cells
susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV 24.
Vero E6 is a cell line isolated from kidney epithelial cells
extracted from an African green monkey. Vero E6 is
composed of epithelial-like cells susceptible to infection by
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 25.
At CNB-CSIC, Vero E6 cell lines were kindly provided by
Dr. Eric Snjider (University of Leiden Medical Center, The
Netherlands). Both Huh7 and Vero E6 cell lines were cultured
in Dulbecco-modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 25 mM HEPES buffer, 2 mM l-glutamine (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA), 1% nonessential amino-acids
(Sigma-Aldrich), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD, USA). In the postinfection semisolid medium, the percentage of FBS was
reduced to 2%, and DEAE-dextran was added to a final
concentration of 0.08 mg/mL.
At IRTA-CReSA, Vero E6 cells were obtained from the
ATCC (ATCC CRL-1586) and cultured in DMEM (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 5% (FBS (EuroClone,
Pero, Italy), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin,
and 2 mM glutamine 8 (all ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). In the post-infection medium, the percentage of
FBS was reduced to 2%.

IVIG samples were serially diluted (factor 10 dilutions:
1:102, 1:103, 1:104, and 1:105) in Dulbecco’s Phosphate
Buffered Saline (PBS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). Samples of each IVIG dilution were
incubated for 1 h (37℃; 5% CO2) with 300 plaque forming
units (PFU) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV.
Aliquots of 50 µL of each IVIG dilution-virus complex were
added in duplicate to confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells
(for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) or Huh7 (for MERSCoV), seeded in 12-well plates and incubated for 1 h (37°C;
5% CO2). After this adsorption time, the IgG-virus complex
inoculum was removed, and a semi-solid overlay was added
(DMEM 2% FBS + 0.6% agarose). Cells were incubated for
72 h at 37ºC. The semi-solid medium was removed, and the
cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at room temperature and stained
with 0.2% aqueous gentian violet for 10 min, followed by
plaque counting. The sensitivity threshold of the technique
was 20 PFU per mL.
The neutralization potency of the IVIG products was
expressed in two ways: 1) percent reduction in PFU calculated
from the PFU count after neutralization by IVIG relative to
initial PFU count inoculated onto the cells; and 2) plaque
reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) value, calculated as the
–log10 of the reciprocal of the highest IVIG dilution to reduce
the number of plaques by 50% compared to the number of
plaques without IVIG.

IgG ELISA testing procedures

Neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 (EPI_ISL_418268
isolate)

Qualitative determination of IgG class antibodies crossreactivity against antigens of the tested coronaviruses was
performed using ELISA techniques. IVIG samples were
serially diluted using the buffer solutions provided in each IgG
ELISA kit. The following kits were used for the qualitative
determination of IgG class antibodies in the experimental
IVIG lots: SARS Coronavirus IgG ELISA kit (Creative
Diagnostics, Shirley, NY, USA), against virus lysate; Human
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Virus Spike 1 [S1] IgG ELISA Kit (Alpha
Diagnostic Intl. Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA), against S1
subunit spike protein; RV-402100-1, Human Anti-MERS-NP
IgG ELISA Kit (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc.), against N

A fixed concentration of a SARS-CoV-2 stock (101.8 TCID
50/mL, a concentration that achieves 50% cytopathic effect)
was mixed with decreasing concentrations of the IVIG
samples (range 1:10 to 1:5120), each mixture was incubated
for 1 h at 37º C and added to Vero E6 cells. To assess potential
plasma-induced cytotoxicity, Vero E6 cells were also cultured
with the same decreasing concentrations of plasma in the
absence of SARS-CoV-2. Uninfected cells and untreated virus
infected cells were used as negative and positive infection

controls, respectively. Plasma from a COVID-19 positive
patient with a high half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) was included as an active positive control (expressed as
the –log10 of the reciprocal of the dilution). All the cultures
were incubated at 37ºC and 5% CO2 for 3 days.
Cytopathic or cytotoxic effects of the virus or plasma
samples were measured at 3 days post infection, using the Cell
Titer-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA). Luminescence was measured in a Fluoroskan
Ascent FL luminometer (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Neutralization curves are shown as nonlinear regressions. IC50
values were determined from the fitted curves as the plasma
dilutions that produced 50% neutralization. Details of the
technique are available elsewhere 21.

For SARS-CoV-2 MAD6 isolate, all IVIG lots, except F1
(inconclusive results) showed a significant neutralizing
activity and reached PRNT50 titers ranging from 4.5 to >5
(Figure 2). PFU reductions ranging from 78.2% to 82.5% were
observed with lots F2, F3 and F4 at a dilution factor of 1. Even
at the highest dilution factor (5 = 0.5 and 1 µg/mL), the PFU
reduction ranged from 38.5% to 50.9% corresponding to
PRNT50 titers of 4.5-5.0 (Figures 2A, 2B). For lots G1 and G2,
the PFU reduction was even higher, ranging from 88.5% 89.5% at a dilution factor of 1 to 61.7% -62.5% at a dilution
factor of 5 with PRNT 50 titers greater than 5 (Figure 2C).
For the SARS-CoV-2 EPI_ISL_418268 isolate, F4 and G1
lots neutralized 58.4% and 64.7%, respectively, TCID50
counts at a dilution factor of 1 (Figure 3). As shown in Figure
3, one replicate of F4 product failed to demonstrate
neutralization.

Results
Cross-reactivity studies (ELISA binding assays)
IVIG products showed consistent reactivity to antigens of
SARS-CoV (culture lysate) at 10-100 mg/mL IgG, SARSCoV-2 (S1 subunit protein) at 100 µg/mL IgG, and MERSCoV (N protein, S1 subunit/RHD protein and S2 subunit
protein) at 50 µg/mL IgG (Table 1).

Discussion

All the assayed IVIG preparations had neutralizing activity
against SARS-CoV ranging from 39% to 61% (Figure 1). All
10% IgG IVIG preparations (F3, F4, G1, and G2) showed
PRNT50 neutralization titers between 2.0 and 3.3,
corresponding to 50-61% PFU reduction (Figures 1B, 1C).
The highest PFU reductions, 59.3% and 61.9% (PRNT 50
neutralization titers of 3.2 and 3.3), were observed with lots
F4 and G1, respectively, at 1 and 0.1 mg/mL IgG (dilution
factors 2 and 3). The F1 and F2 lots, (5% IgG) showed a lower
neutralization capacity with PFU reductions of 39.5% and
43.3%, respectively (Figure 1A).

The results presented here demonstrate, for the first time,
significant cross-neutralization activity against SARS-CoV
and especially SARS-CoV-2 in therapeutic IVIG concentrates
(Flebogamma DIF and Gamunex-C). This neutralizing
activity correlates with the cross-reactivity to different
coronavirus antigens observed in ELISA binding assays with
IVIG, as shown in a previous study 19. The plasma used to
manufacture the tested IVIG lots was collected prior the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe and the USA. Therefore,
these results should be ascribed to cross-reactivity against
SARS-CoV-2 by antibodies against endemic human
coronaviruses in the human population at large. Similar results
have been reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 16-18

No IVIG lot showed any significant PFU reduction (i.e.,
>10%) on MERS-CoV even at the lowest dilution factor (10
mg/mL IgG).

The results were represented as percentage of neutralization

F3-F4 lots of Flebogamma 10% DIF; C) G1-G2 lots of Gamunex-C.

These neutralization studies showed that IVIG products
contain antibodies with cross-neutralizing capacity against
SARS-CoV (40-60%) and SARS-CoV-2 (80%-90%), but not
against MERS-CoV (<10%). These results suggest that the
cross-neutralizing antibodies target antigenic regions more
conserved in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 than in MERSCoV.

No significant differences in the neutralizing capacity were
observed among IVIG lots regardless the country of origin for
the plasma. This reinforces the broad applicability of these
results. Two different neutralization techniques were used for
SARS-CoV-2 and both techniques showed not only the IVIG
neutralization capacity, but also the reliability of the results.
In addition, results obtained with two different SARS-CoV-2
