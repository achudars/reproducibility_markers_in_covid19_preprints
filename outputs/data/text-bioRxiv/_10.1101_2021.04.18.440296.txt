Abstract
The fine-tuned control of immune responses is attained by pairs of activating and inhibitory
signaling receptors which modulate the quality and magnitude of immune responses. Some
viruses exploit these pathways to enter host cells as well as interfere with immune responses.
Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-1/2 Spike proteins (S) contain a potential inhibitory tyrosinebased immunoreceptor motif (ITIM) with the D614G variant occurring within this motif. Through
an in silico screen of ITIM-containing human proteins, we find that the S-located ITIM is closely
related to a previously reported ITIM in the cytoplasmic tail of the human Leukemia Inhibitory
Factor Receptor (LIFR), a pneumonia protective IL-6 family cytokine receptor. To infer potential
functional interactions between SARS-CoV-2 infection and LIFR expression, we performed
single-cell transcriptome analysis of public datasets of lung tissues from healthy individuals and
COVID-19 patients. We show that transcripts of LIFR and its ligand LIF are highly expressed in
SARS-CoV-2 susceptible lung cells from mild and severe COVID-19 patients but not in healthy
individuals. In addition, the human endogenous retroviral envelope gene (ERVW-1) encoding a
fusogenic protein of the same functional class as the S protein, is induced in SARS-CoV-2
susceptible cell subpopulations in COVID-19 patients with no detectable expression in healthy
individuals. We also report that pulmonary epithelial cells express transcripts of several
immunoreceptors including the ITIM-containing antibody receptor FCGR2B which is detectable
in healthy and severe COVID-19 cases but not in mild cases. These results suggest that
molecular dysregulation of ITIM-mediated inhibitory signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may
play a role in COVID-19 immunopathology.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients exhibit varying degrees of immune system
dysfunction including potential cytokine storms1, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)2
and the production of autoantibodies against several self-antigens3–5. This implicates
dysregulation of immune homeostasis and self-tolerance in the pathology of the disease, an

area that remains understudied. Central to immune homeostasis is the coordination between
activating and inhibitory signaling which ensures proportionate responses to the damage posed
by pathogens during infection while maintaining tolerance to self-antigens. In immune cells this
is attained by paired cell surface receptors that are either activating or inhibitory in function.
Activating receptors recruit adaptor proteins containing the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motifs (ITAMs) or in some cases contain ITAMs in their own cytoplasmic tails6. The
ligation and clustering of activating receptors leads to the phosphorylation of ITAMs thereby
creating docking sites for SH2-domain containing kinases which subsequently phosphorylate
downstream substrates and eventually trigger effector functions such as phagocytosis and
production of cytokines6. In contrast to activating receptors, inhibitory receptors contain
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM)7. Ligation of inhibitory receptors leads to
phosphorylation of ITIMs in their cytoplasmic tails followed by the recruitment of SH2-domain
containing cytoplasmic phosphatases (SHP2). This process eventually results in the
dephosphorylation of downstream effectors and downregulation of immune responses or
maintenance of self-tolerance7. While ITAMs are typically involved in immune activation they
can also be inhibitory in some cases8. Certain pathogens including viruses and bacteria can
exploit inhibitory signaling, for example, by mimicking ITIM/ITAM sequences in host regulatory
receptors to dysregulate immune responses 9,10.

We hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-1/2 S proteins could potentially modulate immune
signaling pathways through highly conserved short amino sequences that mediate interactions
between human proteins, commonly referred to as short linear motifs (SLiMs)11–13. Because of
their short nature (3-10 amino acids), SLiMs can rapidly emerge in viral genomes through
convergent evolution and enable viral proteins to physically interact with host proteins14. Since
the S protein is critical for cell entry by coronaviruses, elicits strong neutralizing antibodies, and
has been associated with antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) in SARS-CoV-115,16, an
understanding of its potential role, if any, in subversion of host immune responses is needed.
We investigated whether the SARS-CoV-1/2 S proteins contain specific sequence motifs that
could mimic ITIM and ITAM motifs. We focused on these two motifs because: i) They are central
to balancing activating and inhibitory signals which is crucial to maintenance of self-tolerance
and without which autoimmunity occurs6; ii) The ITAM-containing receptor (FCGR2A) and ITIMcontaining (LILRB1) facilitate dengue virus ADE through binding to antibody Fc and by enabling
endosomal escape of the virus, respectively17–20; iii) Some viruses mimic these motifs to
downregulate immune responses9 and, iv) Exogenously delivered synthetic peptides containing

ITIM motifs interfere with immune signaling demonstrating that standalone peptides containing
ITIM motifs can effectively disrupt inhibitory signaling21,22.
Results
Spike protein contains a potential human immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
(ITIM) motif with high similarity to an ITIM sequence in LIFR
We screened SARS-CoV-1/2 S proteins against the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database23,24
to identify potential SLiMs that may mediate interactions with components of the immune
system. A number of SLiMs associated with interactions involving immune signaling pathways
were detected in several host proteins including STAT3, STAT5, TRAF-2 binding motifs, TRAF6
binding site for Tumor Necrosis Factor 6 and ITIM (Supplementary Table 1). The vast majority
of the identified SLiMs are not directly involved in immune signaling and include the recently
identified RGD motif in SARS-CoV-2 S protein that binds to host integrins25. Whether some of
these identified motifs in the virus are functional will need experimental validation. Here, we
focus on the ITIM-like sequence (610-VLYQDV-615, coordinates relative to SARS-CoV-2 S; P =
3e-04) for the following reasons. First, antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 S derived peptide (611LYQDVN-616) that overlaps the predicted ITIM were previously associated with ADE both in in
vitro experiments and in vivo studies in non-human primate15. Second, the ITIM containing
receptor LILRB1 has been reported to facilitate escape of dengue virus from lysosomal
degradation and inhibit induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) during ADE mediated
viral entry into cells via the ITAM-containing FCGR2A receptor19,20. While ADE has not been
observed in SARS-CoV-2 infections or vaccine recipients, the dysregulation of inhibitory
signaling could lead to immunopathological reactions such as autoantibody production and
cytokine storms that have been reported in COVID-191,5. Third, the D614G mutation26–28 in
SARS-CoV-2 lies within the predicted ITIM motif. Since ITIMs are crucial for inhibitory signaling
of immune responses, mimicry by a pathogen could interfere with this process, leading to
uncontrolled immune responses. Indeed, a few bacterial and viral proteins containing ITIM
sequences have been established to use the motifs to interfere with host immune signaling
pathways9,10,29.

Next, we asked whether the SARS-CoV-1/2 ITIM motif shares high sequence similarity to ITIMlike sequences located in the cytoplasmic tails of specific human proteins identified by previous
computational studies30. Out of 109 proteins in the human proteome containing putative ITIM
motifs30, the LIFR ITIM (VIYIDV) is highly similar to the wild-type SARS-CoV-1/2 ITIM sequence

(VLYQDV), with only 2 amino differences between the two. Another host protein with a closely
related ITIM is the platelet derived growth factor receptor, beta precursor (PDGFRB) with the
sequence VLYTAV30. Previous studies indicate that LIFR is required for lung protection during
pneumonia, for example, in respiratory syncytial virus infections (RSV)31–34. Furthermore, its
ligand, LIF, is one of the cytokines in the IL-6 family and is increased in the lungs of patients
with ARDS35,36, which has been observed in COVID-19 patients2,37,38. Notably, because the
D614G variant is located within the SARS-CoV-2 ITIM, the mutational distance between the
LIFR ITIM and the corresponding ITIM sequence in D614G viruses increases from 2 to 3 which
could reduce the potential molecular mimicry or subversion of LIFR by the D614G associated
ITIM. A number of studies suggest that D614G variants are highly transmissible26,27,39,40 and that
the mutation increases infectivity to lung cells40–46 implying the possibility that this sequence
region is under selective pressure. However, to date no associations have been found between
this mutation and COVID-19 disease severity26,28.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis of LIFR, LIF and SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors in the
human cell atlas and lung cell transcriptome
To further explore the possibility of biological interactions between LIFR and SARS-CoV-2, we
analyzed LIFR expression in single-cell transcriptomes of human tissues using data from the
human cell atlas (HCA)47 and lung single cell transcriptome from the Madissoon et al study48 as
well as a recently published single-cell bronchoalveolar transcriptome of COVID-19 patients and
healthy controls49 (Fig. 1-2, Supplementary Fig. S1 and S2). In addition, we included single-cell
expression levels of genes important for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1,
NRP2)50–54, those previously implicated in ADE via Fc receptor binding and/or signaling via

as well as key cytokines (IFNG and IFNB).

Additionally, we included ERVW-1 which encodes the human endogenous retrovirus W (HERVW) envelope protein or syncytin, one of a few host proteins that are functionally similar to the
viral spike protein in catalyzing fusion of cell membranes. Further details on the selected genes
are described in the Methods section.

The overall expression of the selected target genes across human tissues shows that the key
SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) are sparsely expressed in normal tissues
with the highest detectable single-cell expression of ACE2 in the esophagus (~1.4% of cells)
followed by lungs (~0.18% of cells), liver (~0.1% of cells) and eye (~0.05% of cells) (Fig. 1 A,

HCA data). As lungs are the primary tissue targeted by SARS-CoV-2, we also analyzed the
expression of the selected candidate genes in the Madissoon et al study48 (Fig. 1B). The
percentage of cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2 and LIFR in lung tissue was highly
comparable between the HCA and the Madissoon et al study datasets with extremely low ACE2
expression in both. This is consistent with previously published studies58,59. Next, we applied
unsupervised approach based on uniform manifold learning (UMAP)60 with Louvain algorithm for
community detection61, to the previously published lung single-cell transcriptome by Madissoon
et al48. We established 27 and 12 cell subpopulations based on data from the normal left lobe of
the lungs and a suspected hypertensive left lung, respectively (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether
these subpopulations are enriched with specific cell types, we obtained cell types markers as
described in UCSC cell browser (https://cells.ucsc.edu/). We then computed an overlap score
between the top 100 markers of each subpopulation and each cell type’s markers using Scanpy
package62. We identified enrichments of cell types in each of the cell subpopulations including
enrichments in Alveolar Type 1/ 2 (AET1/2) and Ciliated cells that are SARS-CoV-2 infection
primary targets. The expression of the candidate genes in 5 subpopulations enriched with
distinct cell types is shown for normal lungs by the heatmap and bar plots in Fig. 1C and a
suspected hypertensive lung in Fig. 1D (See Supplementary Fig. S3 for detailed data on all cell
type enrichments across all the cell subpopulations detected).

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects lung epithelial cells here represented by AET1/2 and ciliated cells
(ciliated P1/P2, ciliated 1/2). Consistent with this, the main entry receptor of the virus ACE2 and
the TMPRSS2 protease required to activate the fusogenic activity of the S protein are both
expressed in AET1/2 and ciliated cells (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, these
cells expressed the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, NRP1, as well as its close
relative NRP253,54 (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S3). Overall, AET1 and ciliated P1 cells
have distinct gene expression profiles of the candidate genes in normal vs hypertensive lung
(heatmaps in Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, AET1 and ciliated P1- the main cell subpopulations
expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and therefore susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 - also show
enhanced expression of ERVW-1, LIF, LIFR, FUT8, IFNB1, IFNG, KLRC, MYD88 in the
hypertensive lungs compared to normal lungs. In contrast, TMPRSS2, KLRD1 and NRP2 are
downregulated in AET1, and the remaining genes including ACE2 are comparably expressed in
normal vs hypertensive lungs (Fig. 1D; detailed in Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4). Notably, the
hypertensive lung was originally identified as healthy in the Madissoon et al study48.
Interestingly, the expression levels of the candidate genes from the right and left normal lungs

are distinct potentially due to differences in lung volume, implying that gene expression
analyses of lung cells need to take this into account. Out of the genes analyzed, ERVW-1 has a
unique expression pattern - it is not expressed at all in both left and right normal lungs and is
weakly but detectably expressed in the hypertensive lung, and even so only in AET1 and
ciliated P1 cells (Fig. 1D).
Single-cell transcriptome analysis of LIFR, LIF and SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors in the
lungs of COVID-19 patients
The expression of a subset of the candidate genes in host cells of SARS-CoV-2 increases the
likelihood of biologically relevant interactions with the viral spike protein. Therefore, we next
examined the expression of the candidate genes in an independent single-cell RNAseq data
from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of three cases of mild COVID-19, six severe cases
and three healthy controls using a recently published dataset49 (QC analysis shown in
Supplementary Fig. S5). Clustering of the single cell transcriptomes resulted in distinct
groupings with a clear separation of cells from the healthy controls and a closer relationship
between the mild and severe cases (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. 6 A). In addition to this
separation, single cells from individual subjects within each group are also separated with cells
from the same individual generally closer to each other (Fig. 2A). As expected, high levels of
SARS-CoV-2 transcripts are detectable in the single cells of severe cases with relatively fewer
transcripts in the mild cases and none in the healthy controls (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S6
B-C). A summary view of the expression of each of the candidate genes in single cells from
each group is shown in the track plots and UMAP plots in Fig. 2B. It is evident that ACE2
expression is especially higher in severe COVID-19 cases relative to mild disease with no
detectable expression in the lung from the healthy cases (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. 6C).
TMPRSS2 on the other hand shows considerable expression in the lung tissue of severe and
mild cases with a low expression in the healthy cases (Fig. 2B; heatmaps Fig. 2C;
Supplementary Fig. 6C). We also observed that expression of ERVW-1 and IFNB1 is only
detectable in severe cases (Fig. 2B track plots and heatmaps Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. 6C)
which is noteworthy considering that ERVW-1 expression induces double-stranded RNA
antiviral response63–65. Furthermore, IFNB1 transcript expression was recently associated with
prolonged ICU stay and multiorgan involvement which are hallmarks of critical COVID-19
cases66. On the other hand, we found that LIFR expression is high in both mild and severe
cases with no detectable levels in healthy cases (Fig. 2B track plots and 2C heatmaps;
Supplementary Fig. 6C). In contrast, LIF is expressed in all cases even though expression in

mild and severe cases is more widespread (Fig. 2B track plots and UMAP; heatmaps Fig. 2C;
Supplementary Fig. 6C).

To further examine the single cell expression levels of the candidate genes in COVID-19
infected vs. healthy lungs, we performed an analysis of cell subpopulations to determine the
expression levels of the candidate genes in enriched cell types within each subpopulation (Fig.
3; Supplementary Fig. S9 for enriched cell types in each subpopulation). ACE2 and TMPRSS2
expression levels are extremely low in single cells from healthy individuals while relatively
higher expression is observed in ciliated P1, goblet cells and alveolar type 1/2 cells of mild and
severe COVID-19 cases (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7-8). A similar pattern of single cell
expression is observed for ERVW-1, LIF and LIFR (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7-8). In
contrast, while FCGR2A and FCGR2B were detectable across various cell types in both healthy
and COVID-19 cases, the single cell expression of these genes was much lower in Ciliated P1
cells of the COVID-19 mild and severe cases (Supplementary Figure S8). The expression of
these antibody receptors in pulmonary epithelial cells is unexpected as most of their functions
are associated with professional immune cells.

The expression of the SARS-COV-2 entry

receptor and protease in the same cell types as ERVW-1, LIF and LIFR increases the likelihood
of interactions of the corresponding proteins. Furthermore, given that expression level of these
genes is extremely low in healthy cases especially in cell types susceptible to SARS-CoV-2,
there appears to be a potential link to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Discussion
There is increasing evidence that dysregulation of immune responses plays a critical role in
COVID-19 through several mechanisms. For example, autoantibodies against a broad range of
extracellular antigens such as cytokines (IFNs, IL6)3,5, chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL7)5 and
several immunomodulatory cell surface receptors (NKG2A/C/E, CD38) are overexpressed in
subsets of COVID-19 patients67,68. The molecular mechanisms through which infection by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus could lead to a breakdown in tolerance remain unknown. Woodruff et al
suggested that occurrence of autoimmunity in a subset of COVID-19 patients could be due to
previously unknown pre-existing autoimmunity in the patient cohort or a consequence of
immunological events in COVID-19 patients4. Activation of TLR7 by the single-stranded RNA of
the virus could lead to de novo autoreactivity to self-antigens4. Given that ITIM signaling
modulates TLR7 responses69 and several ITIM-containing receptors are involved in B-cell

tolerance70, potential targeting of host ITIMs by a virus could lead to a breakdown in selftolerance.

In this study, we found that the S protein contains a hexapeptide motif that has a high similarity
to an ITIM in a host protein, LIFR. Furthermore, this hexapeptide contains the site for the
D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-1, antibodies to this peptide were
associated with ADE in in vitro experiments and led to lung induced injury in non-human
primates15. Our analysis of the similarity of the hexapeptide to ITIM sequences in 109 human
proteins revealed that it is most closely related to an ITIM sequence located in the Leukemia
Inhibitory Factor Receptor (LIFR), an interleukin-6 (IL-6) family cytokine receptor. Whether the
ITIM sequence in the virus can interfere with signaling by LIFR or other host proteins requires
further laboratory validation as the functional activity of the LIFR ITIM has not been verified
experimentally. Typically, functional ITIM sequences are located within the cytoplasmic tail of
immunoreceptors6. The ability of exogenously delivered ITIM containing peptides to inhibit TLRmediated ITIM-dependent signaling21,22 opens the possibility that virus derived ITIMs can
similarly interfere with inhibitory ITIM signaling. For this to occur, the viral proteins containing the
ITIM sequences need to be present within cell types expressing host proteins with ITIMs in their
cytoplasmic tails. Thus, we assessed the single cell expression of LIFR and other ITIM
containing host proteins as a first step to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in
dysregulation of ITIM signaling.
To date there is limited data on the role if any of LIF/ LIFR in COVID-1971. Yet, LIF is known to
be an important player in recovery from pneumonia31 and is elevated in the lungs of patients
with ARDS35. Like all members of the IL-6 family of cytokines, LIF signals via STAT3 and utilizes
glycoprotein 130 (gp130) as a receptor subunit72. LIF signaling is mediated by its binding to a
high affinity receptor complex composed of a low affinity LIF binding chain (LIFR) and a high
affinity converter subunit (gp130)73. Our results show that LIF is particularly elevated in mild
COVID-19 pulmonary epithelial cells compared to severe or healthy cases while LIFR is
elevated in both mild and severe cases (Figure 3; Supplementary Figure S8). Thus, it is
possible that enhanced levels of LIF may lead to mild disease by compensating for potential
interference of LIFR signaling by the viral spike ITIM sequence.

The classical view of the biological role of pulmonary epithelial cells is that they serve as a
physical barrier to limit entry of pathogens or facilitate the removal of pathogens. Recent studies

show that pulmonary epithelial cells play more complicated roles in inflammation, immunity and
host defense74. Our results indicate that at least at the transcriptional level, pulmonary epithelial
cells also express other key immunoreceptors including those containing ITAMs (FCGR2A), and
ITIMs (LIFR, FCGR2B, LILRB1, NKG2A) implying that these cell types may also be involved in
various immune responses. However, our study is limited by the use of transcriptional datasets
which do not always reflect functional relevance. Interestingly, dexamethasone, a corticosteroid
that improves survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients75,76 has been shown to enhance
expression of FCGR2B both at the mRNA and protein levels77,78. It is notable that FCGR2B
expression was detectable in ciliated cells of healthy as well as severe COVID-19 cases but not
in those of mild COVID-19 cases (Supplementary Figure S8). It is also possible that subversion
of host ITIMs not considered here could also contribute to immune dysregulation in COVID-19.
Dysregulation of other ITIM-containing proteins such as PD-L1 expressed by airway epithelial
cells

79

or PECAM1 which is co-located with FCGR2A in platelets80 may be especially important

given the recent reports of vaccine induced thrombocytopenia in SARS-CoV-2 ChaAdOX1
vaccine recipients81,82.

The observation that expression of ERVW-1 is induced in both mild and severe COVID-19 could
also result in immune dysregulation and demonstrates a potential role of airway epithelial cells
in pulmonary immune homeostasis given that ERV-derived dsRNA can trigger innate immune
responses63,64,83. In relation to this, a recent study found that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to
increased expression of LINE-1, another type of retrotransposons in the human genome84.
Since LINE-1 encoded reverse transcriptase can also reverse transcribe HERV-W transcripts85,
this may increase the likelihood for HERV-W pseudogene formation. There are at least 13 loci in
the human genome encoding full length HERV-W envelope protein (Env) with only one of these
on chromosome 7 encoding a functional protein, syncytin that is key to placenta formation
through fusion of cytotrophoblasts86. HERV-W Env expression has been associated with
multiple sclerosis87 and type-1 diabetes88. Furthermore, Env is cytotoxic and induces production
of autoantibodies that target it89. Such Env targeting autoantibodies in type-1 diabetes patients
could cross-react with Env/ syncytin expressed in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. This could be
one potential mechanism through which some comorbidities, for example, type-1 diabetes may
be associated with severe COVID-19.

LIF and IL-6 share a signaling receptor (gp130) yet most studies to date on COVID-19 have
focused only on IL-6 and a detailed assessment of the role of LIF /LIFR in the disease is

lacking. IL-6 is one of the top cytokines that have been associated with COVID-19 disease
severity yet clinical trials of therapeutic benefit of anti-IL-6 antibodies have yielded mixed
results90,91. A dissection of the role of LIF and IL-6 in COVID-19 could guide targeting of the
distinct signaling pathways for these IL-6 family cytokines as a means to develop therapeutics
against COVID-19. Given that LIFR is required for protection of lungs in pneumonia and its
ligand LIF has been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), comorbidities
such as obesity92,93, diabetes94, hypertension95,96, stroke97 and kidney failure98, it may provide
insights into why these conditions are associated with severe COVID-19. As LIFR is also
important in the proliferation of olfactory neural progenitors which influence neuronal
regeneration of the olfactory epithelium after injury99,100, it could have a direct role in the loss of
smell in COVID-19 patients. Thus, the results of this study have implications for understanding
disease pathology in SARS-CoV-2.

distance with clustering using Louvain-graph algorithm. The heatmaps show the mean
expression (on standard scale) of the candidate genes from a subset of subpopulations from the
left lobe. Each subpopulation is labelled by the enriched cell type as described in the Methods
section. The bar plots show five of the top enriched cell types in a subset of subpopulations from
the left lobe of the lung. The score on the X-axis of the bar plots represents the overlap between
top 100 ranked genes per subpopulation against the reference markers for each cell type. For
the normal left lobe (upper panel), the number of cells per subpopulation are: 0 (n= 3995), 1 (n=

Methods

Identification of short linear motifs (SLIMs) in SARS-CoV-1 and 2
The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource server

23,24

was used to scan the SARS-CoV-1 and

2 spike protein sequence for candidate and known functional motifs. To minimize false positive
short linear motifs (SLIMs), we used filters that include contextual information on the location of

the motif such that motifs occurring within globular domains are excluded. Detected ITIM
sequences were manually verified to be consistent with ITIM regular expression (ILV)-x-x-Y-x(LV). ITIM containing proteins in the human proteome were obtained from a previous study30.

Selection of candidate genes
Candidate genes for transcriptome analysis were selected based on their roles in i) SARS-CoV2 cell entry pathways (ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1, NRP2)50–54; ii) ADE via Fc receptor binding
and/or containing ITIM/ITAM sequences (FCGR2A17,18, FCGR2B7, LILRB119,20, NKG2A)55; iii)
disruption of ITIM-dependent signaling by synthetic ITIM containing peptides (MyD88 and
CD300LF/IREM-1)21,22; iv) Fc core fucosylation which enhances ADE (Fut8)56,57; iv) innate
immunity (IFNG and IFNB); v) functional similarity to the spike protein

(syncytin/ERVW1

involved in formation of the placenta through cell-to-cell fusion under the control of LIF101,102).
Like the S protein, syncytin is a class I fusion protein103 and its ligand in mice (Ly6E) was
recently shown to impair SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion104. Furthermore, HERV expression
impacts innate immunity to exogenous viruses and some ERVs have been co-opted as
regulators of innate immunity in non-human primates83,105.

Datasets
We used published single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, for different tissues/organs, from the
human cell atlas data portal (https://data.humancellatlas.org/)47. For the normal lung expression
data we used datasets from the Madissoon et al study48 while the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) derived cells from COVID-19 patients from the Liao et al., 2020 study49 (GEO accession
number GSE145926) used in the analysis. In both studies we only used cells with at least 300
genes detected, mitochondrial gene fraction<20% and at least 10,000 mapped UMI per cell for
the quality control, target genes mean expression and initial exploratory analysis.

Cell subpopulations
We used single cells that had at least 1000 genes detected, mitochondrial gene fraction<20%
and at least 10,000 mapped UMI per cell. Each cell’s total counts were normalized to 10,000,
then log transformed, and significantly highly variable genes identified using in Seurat’s mean
expression weighted dispersion Z -scores as implemented in Scanpy module (version 1.5.1)
(Wolf, F.A., Angerer, P. & Theis, F.J., 2018). Dimensionality reduction was carried out using
PCA and the top 20 components used as input to Louvain algorithm clustering, with the

resolution set to 1.0 and other default parameters. The neighborhood graphs were based on
UMAP embedding and Euclidean distance.

Cell type detection
Here we compiled a set of markers for each organ/tissue cell type as described in the UCSC
cell browser (https://cells.ucsc.edu/ ). For each subpopulation calculated the overlap score
between its top 100 markers and each cell type markers using Scanpy’s marker_gene_overlap
algorithm62 with normalization set to the ‘reference’ set of markers.

Differential gene expression analysis
Since the number of cells varied for each subpopulation, we subsampled 300 cells from each
subpopulation and performed differential gene expression using Welch – t test using the genes
counts with negative binomial noise model. 100 replications were carried out for each pairwise
comparison between subpopulations.
