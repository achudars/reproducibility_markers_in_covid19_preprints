Abstract

26

Background: Several point-of-care (POC) molecular tests have received emergency use

27

authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosis of SARS-

28

CoV-2. The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC

29

test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use.

30

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2

31

test.

32

Study design: The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100

33

nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA

34

laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was

35

assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent

36

agreement (NPA), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient.

37

Results: Overall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval

38

[CI] 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI 53.3 to 80.5%) and the kappa coefficient was 0.68

39

(95% CI 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the

40

Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA

41

was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).

42

Conclusion: Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent

43

negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The

44

false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test

45

performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with

46

moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.

Background

48

The importance of diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

49

(SARS-CoV-2) has been strongly emphasized by both the World Health Organization (WHO)

50

and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1-3). In the US, most

51

SARS-CoV-2 testing has been conducted using high complexity molecular-based laboratory-

52

developed tests (LDTs) that have received emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and

53

Drug Administration (FDA) in centralized laboratories certified to meet the quality standards of

54

the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) (4, 5). Currently, 3 CLIA-

55

waived point-of-care tests (POCT) are EUA-approved for SARS-CoV-2 testing: the Cepheid

56

Xpert Xpress, the Abbott ID NOW, and the Mesa Accula (6). Compared to high complexity

57

LDTs, POCT have the potential to reduce turnaround time of testing, optimize clinical

58

management and increase patient satisfaction (7). The Accula SARS-CoV-2 test is a POCT that

59

requires only 30 minutes from sample to answer and utilizes the existing palm-sized Accula dock

60

system originally developed for rapid influenza and RSV testing. Despite the multiple potential

61

benefits of POC assays, concern has been raised regarding their lower sensitivity for COVID-19

62

diagnosis compared to standard high complexity molecular based tests (8-10). It remains unclear

63

whether this decreased sensitivity is due to test validation studies being limited to in silico

64

predictions and contrived samples using reference materials, as is the case currently for the

65

Accula SARS-CoV-2 test.

66

Objectives

67

The aim of this study was to evaluate the test performance characteristics of the Accula SARS-

68

CoV-2 test in a clinical setting against a high complexity reference standard.

69
70

Study design

71

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected in viral transport medium or saline from adult

72

patients from SHC, and from pediatric and adult patients from surrounding hospitals in the Bay

73

Area. Testing for this study was performed at the SHC Clinical Virology Laboratory using

74

samples collected between April 7, 2020 and April 13, 2020. The same NP specimen was used

75

for both the reference assay and Accula test for comparison.

76
77

RT-PCR assays

78

The reference assay for this study was the Stanford Health Care Clinical Virology Laboratory

79

real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction LDT (SHC-LDT) targeting the E gene

80

(11-13). The Accula SARS-CoV-2 POCT (Mesa Biotech, Inc., San Diego, CA) is a sample-to-

81

answer nucleic acid amplification test that can yield a diagnostic result within 30 minutes of

82

specimen collection. This test uses RT-PCR to target the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene, and is

83

read out via lateral flow (Figure 1) (14). The manufacturer’s instructions are comprised of the

84

following steps: collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, lysis of viral particles in SARS-CoV-2

85

buffer, transfer of nucleic acid solution to a test cassette which contains internal process positive

86

and negative controls, reverse transcription of viral RNA to cDNA, nucleic acid amplification,

87

and detection by lateral flow. Due to biosafety regulations and hospital-mandated protocols for

88

sample collection at SHC, NP swabs were directly placed into VTM or saline at the patient

89

bedside after collection. Each test was performed at the laboratory, where a volume of 10 µL of

90

VTM or saline was transferred to 60 µL of SARS-CoV-2 buffer and added to the test cassette.

91

These steps were performed within a biosafety cabinet to protect against aerosolization. All

92

remaining steps were followed as per the manufacturer’s instructions (14). Testing was repeated

93

once for invalid results on initial testing, and the second result was interpreted as final if valid.

94
95

Statistics

96

Overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement

97

(NPA) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Cohen’s kappa coefficient

98

() of qualitative results (detected/non-detected) between the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test and the

99

SHC-LDT was also calculated with 95% CI. Cohen’s kappa values between 0.60 and 0.80 were

100

interpreted to indicate substantial agreement, and kappa calues above 0.81 were interpreted as

101

excellent agreement (15). All analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1.

102
103

Results

104

We included 100 samples (50 positive, 50 negative) previously tested by the SHC LDT, and

105

tested in parallel with the Accula SARS-CoV-2 POCT. A total of 37 samples were collected in

106

VTM (13 positive, 24 negative), and 63 were collected in saline (37 positive, 26 negative).

107

Positive samples determined by the SHC-LDT included a range of cycle threshold (Ct) values,

108

with a median Ct of 28.2 (IQR 20.4-36.3). A total of 3 samples were resulted as invalid on initial

109

testing by Accula and were repeated once. One of these samples was detected for SARS-CoV-2

110

on repeat testing, and the other 2 samples were negative.

112

The Accula SARS-CoV-2 test correctly identified 34/50 positive samples and 50/50 negative

113

samples, corresponding to an overall percent agreement of 84.0% (95% CI 75.3 to 90.6%),

114

(Table 1). The positive percent agreement was 68.0% (95% CI 53.3 to 80.5%) and the Cohen’s

115

kappa coefficient was 0.74 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.87), indicating substantial agreement. The 16

116

positive samples that were negative by the Accula test had a median Ct value of 37.7 (IQR 36.6

117

to 38.2) by the SHC-LDT, consistent with lower viral loads. The NPA was 100% (95% CI 92.9

118

to 100%). The lateral flow read-out on the Accular test was considered easy to interpret for all

119

samples with the exception of a single known positive sample that showed a faint positive test

120

line. Repeat testing of this sample showed the same faint test line, and was interpreted as

121

positive.

122
123

Discussion

124

Although SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity has improved in many countries, a global shortage of

125

diagnostic infrastructure and consumable reagents has limited testing efforts. Point-of-care tests

126

offer the potential advantages of improved access to testing and reduced turnaround time of

127

results. Of the multiple EUA assays for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, only the Xpert Xpress, the ID

128

NOW, and the Accula are CLIA-waived (6). Recent data support the test performance of the

129

Cepheid Xpert SARS-CoV-2 assay, with agreement over 99% compared to high-complexity

130

EUA assays (8, 16, 17). In contrast, some studies have raised concern regarding the diagnostic

131

accuracy of the ID NOW, with positive percent agreement ranging from 75-94% compared to

132

reference assays (8-10, 18). Given the poor diagnostic performance of the ID NOW, and

133

uncertainty regarding availability of Xpert Xpress cartridges, the Accula system has been tauted

134

as an interesting POCT alternative but data were previously lacking on its clinical performance.

135

In this study, we showed that similar to ID NOW, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test has a lower

6

136

sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to an EUA LDT. The false negatives obtained

137

from the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test were predominantly observed with low viral load specimens.

138
139

Given the accumulating evidence on lower diagnostic performance with 2 of the 3 CLIA-waived

140

SARS-CoV-2 assays, it is now important to consider how best to integrate these tests in

141

diagnostic workflows and to identify groups of individuals for whom POCT use should be

142

prioritized. Furthermore, reagents and kits have been limited, which limits POCT capacity.

143

Certain groups such as individuals requiring urgent pre-operative assessment including

144

transplantation, patient-facing symptomatic healthcare workers, and individuals waiting for

145

enrollment in a SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic trial have been identified as key groups in whom to

146

prioritize POCT. However, for each of these scenarios and depending on the POCT used, the risk

147

of missing a case due to low sensitivity must be considered. In individuals with moderate to high

148

pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2, reflex testing of negative samples on a separate EUA assay

149

should be performed. Education of health care professionals on the limitations of SARS-CoV-2

150

POCT should also be implemented to ensure optimal interpretation and management of negative

151

results.

152
153

Our study has several limitations. First, NP swabs were placed in VTM or saline at the patient

154

bedside before loading the Accula test cassette, which may have decreased sensitivity by diluting

155

the viral inoculum. Although this is discordant with the best recommended practice by the

156

manufacturer, it is in line with the practice at multiple institutions with clinical laboratories that

157

have assessed SARS-CoV-2 POCT due to biosafety concerns from risk of aerosolization (8-10,

158

18, 19). Second, it is possible that the use of saline instead of VTM led to poorer performance of

7

159

the Accula. However, aliquots from the same sample were used for parallel testing with the EUA

160

method, which minimizes sources of variation, and represents a pragmatic comparison given

161

widespread VTM shortages. Finally, the lateral-flow read-out of the Accula test is generally easy

162

to interpret; however, faint lines may be more challenging to interpret and lead to result

163

discrepancies.

164
165

In summary, this study demonstrated that the Accula POCT lacks sensitivity compared to a

166

reference EUA SARS-CoV-2 LDT. Careful consideration should be given to balance the

167

potential advantages of rapid POCT to lower diagnostic accuracy. Individuals with moderate to

168

high pre-test probability who initially test negative on the Accula test should undergo

169

confirmatory testing with a separate EUA assay.
