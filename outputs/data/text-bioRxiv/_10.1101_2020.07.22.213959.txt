Abstract: We describe the first cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection detected in animals in
the United States. In March 2020, four tigers and three lions at the Bronx Zoo developed mild
respiratory signs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by rRT-PCR in respiratory secretions and/or
40

feces from all seven affected animals; viral RNA and/or antibodies were detected in their
keepers. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from respiratory secretions or feces from three affected
animals; in situ hybridization co-localized viral RNA with cellular damage. Whole genome
sequence and haplotype network analyses showed tigers and lions were infected with two
different SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting independent viral introductions. The source of SARS-

45

CoV-2 infection in the lions is unknown. Epidemiological data and genetic similarities between
keeper and tiger viruses indicate human to animal transmission.

Main Text:
COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2
50

(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) (1), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China at the end of December 2019 (2). Within weeks the virus caused a global
pandemic, and by July, 2020, over 10 million people were infected and more than 500,000 had
died (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019; accessed 7/1/2020).
An early cluster of human cases had an epidemiological link to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale

55

market in Wuhan where a variety of live wild animals were sold (3). Genome sequence analysis
revealed SARS-CoV-2 to be most closely related to a bat coronavirus (RaTG13-2013), and bats
are considered the likely source of the ancestral virus from which the currently circulating

SARS-CoV-2 virus was derived (3, 4). Subsequent genetic adaptation in an intermediate animal
host(s) or after human transmission has been proposed (4, 5).

60

Given the suspected zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, identifying susceptible animal
species, reservoirs, and transmission routes are topics of global scientific and public interest.
Natural SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals have been reported in dogs, cats and farmed mink in
Hong Kong, Europe, China and the United States (6–8). Infection in most of these cases has been
linked to households or settings in which human owners or caretakers have tested positive for

65

SARS-CoV-2. Experimental inoculation studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects and
replicates with high efficiency in domestic cats, ferrets and fruit bats and poorly in dogs, pigs,
and chickens; ducks do not seem to support productive SARS-CoV-2 infection (9, 10).
Importantly, virus shedding and horizontal transmission have been shown in cats and ferrets (9,
10)following experimental inoculation.

70

In this study, we report natural infection of tigers (Panthera tigris), lions (P. leo) and
keepers who provided care for the animals with SARS-CoV-2 at the Wildlife Conservation
Society’s (WCS) Bronx Zoo, New York NY. We provide a detailed characterization of viruses
obtained from infected animals and keepers who had close contact with the SARS-CoV-2
positive animals. The animals were infected in March 2020, when, due to widespread community

75

transmission (11), NY had become a global SARS-CoV-2 epicenter.
On March 27, 2020, a 4-year-old, female Malayan tiger (P. t. jacksoni) (Tiger 1)
developed an intermittent cough and audible wheezing despite remaining eupneic. By April 2, an
additional Malayan (Tiger 2) and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) (Tigers 3, 4) housed in the same
building as Tiger 1 but in different enclosures, and three African lions (P. l. krugeri) (Lions 1, 2,

3) housed in a separate building developed similar respiratory signs. All animals otherwise
exhibited normal behavior and activity. Clinical respiratory signs resolved within one week in all
but Tiger 1, whose clinical signs lasted 16 days. An additional Amur tiger (Tiger 5) in the same
building as Tigers 1-4 did not develop clinical respiratory disease.
Clinical evaluation and a broad diagnostic investigation were performed in Tiger 1.

85

Thoracic radiography revealed small, multifocal regions of peribronchial consolidation.
Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid identified necrotic epithelial and inflammatory
cells consistent with tracheitis (Fig. 1A and B). In situ hybridization (ISH) co-localized SARSCoV-2 RNA within necrotic epithelial and inflammatory cells in tracheal wash fluid (Fig. 1C, D
and S1). Targeted PCR testing and metagenomic analysis on respiratory samples (nasal,

90

orpharyngeal, tracheal) were negative for common feline pathogens (Table S1, BioProject
accession number PRJNA627354). All samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time
reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) using CDC 2019-nCoV primers and probes targeting the
nucleocapsid gene (N1, N2 and N3) and an in-house rRT-PCR assay targeting the envelope (E)
gene (Tables S2 and S3). Results were confirmed with MinION and Sanger-based sequencing of

95

the full SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene, an internal region of the N gene, and the RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp) confirmed the virus in the respiratory samples (Table S2 and S5).
Fecal samples collected opportunistically from each animal (symptomatic Tigers 1-4,
asymptomatic Tiger 5, Lions 1-3) were test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR (Tables S4).
Results were confirmed by amplicon sequencing (Table S5).

100

Virus isolation was performed in respiratory and/or fecal samples from the animals.
Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in Vero cells inoculated with tracheal wash fluid from
Tiger 1 (Fig. 2A and B) and fecal samples from Tiger 3 and Lion 2 (Table S6). Results were

and D). A neutralizing antibody titer of 64 detected in Tiger 1 (Table S7) confirmed infection
105

and development of an immunologic response against SARS-CoV-2.
An epidemiologic investigation of zoo staff identified ten zoo keepers and two managers
who provided care for and had close but not direct contact with the tigers or lions between March
16, 2020 (the date the zoo was closed to the public due to the pandemic) and March 27 to April
1, 2020 (timeline of disease onset in the animals). Four staff (2 tiger and 2 lion keepers) reported

110

mild respiratory symptoms (including fever, cough, chills, myalgia and fatigue) between March
20 and 28, 2020. Oropharyngeal samples and blood were collected from these staff members on
April 6, 2020 and tested by rRT-PCR and a microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to detect IgG
antibodies. The remaining staff reported no symptoms and were not tested. All tested keepers
had evidence of current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (one rRT-PCR positive tiger keeper

115

[Keeper 1], one rRT-PCR and serologically positive tiger keeper [Keeper 2], two serologically
positive lion keepers [Keepers 3 and 4]). All reported staying at home while sick. Whole genome
sequencing of rRT-PCR positive samples from Keepers 1 and 2 was performed to characterize
the human samples and further compare the human and animal viral genome sequences.
Nine complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (four from tigers, three from lions, two

120

from keepers) and eight full-length S gene sequences (seven symptomatic and one asymptomatic
animals) were generated directly from respiratory and/or fecal samples. Compared to the WuhanHu-1 (GenBank accession number NC_045512), all sequences obtained from the tigers and
keepers contained six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with nine additional ambiguous
sites (Fig. S2, Table S8). A total of 20 sites differed between the three lion sequences and

125

Wuhan-Hu-1 (Fig. S2, Table S8).

Viral sequences in the tigers, lions and keepers clustered into common SARS-CoV-2
clades (Fig. 3A). Those from tigers and tiger keepers clustered with clade G (defined by the
D614G substitution in the spike protein); the lion sequences clustered with clade V (defined by
the G251V substitution in ORF3a) (Fig. 3A). Median-joining haplotype network analysis of the
130

viral sequences in the animals and keepers corroborated results of the phylogenetic analyses
(Fig. 3B). Genomic and epidemiological data support a close evolutionary relationship between
the viral strains recovered from tigers and tiger keepers. Notably, the genetic differences and the
distant phylogenetic relationship between sequences recovered from the tigers/tiger keepers and
lions, and the relationship of these strains in the context of global sequences (Fig. 3B) indicate

135

that tigers and lions were infected by two different viral strains. Furthermore, this data suggest
that at least two independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions occurred, one in tigers and another in
lions.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from Tiger 1 was identical to the viral sequence
recovered from Keeper 1 (a tiger keeper) and to other human SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in

140

New York (NY_2929 [MT304486] and NY-QDX-00000001 [MT452574.1]) (Fig. 3). These
observations, temporal overlap in animal and human infections, and a lack of new animal
introductions to the collection support the conclusion of transmission from an infected keeper(s)
to the tigers. Whether this was direct or indirect (e.g. fomite, food handling/preparation) and
whether subsequent tiger to tiger transmission (aerosol, respiratory droplet, etc.) occurred was

145

not determined. A clear association and transmission source was not identified for the lions. The
lion SARS-CoV-2 sequences were more divergent than those in the tigers and keepers (Fig. 3).
However, nine of the 12 SNPs (relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain) shared by all three
lion viruses were also found in the closest human strain (GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_427161),

which was detected nearby in Connecticut, US. Two lion keepers were serologically positive for
150

SARS-CoV-2, but viral RNA was not detected and SARS-CoV-2 strain(s) could not be
confirmed in their respiratory samples. However, given regular close contact between keepers
and animals it is possible that the lions were also directly or indirectly infected by asymptomatic
keepers or staff.
The host range of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses is determined primarily by the

155

interaction of the virus S glycoprotein, specifically the spike 1 subunit (S1), and the cellular
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) (12). Recently, in silico predictions have
shown high binding potential between the S receptor binding domain (RBD) and domestic cat
ACE2 receptor, and that three of five amino acid residues that are critical for interaction with the
SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein are conserved between human and domestic cat ACE2 (12). These

160

observations are supported by reports describing natural and experimental infection of domestic
cats with SARS-CoV-2 (9, 13) and the data herein that shows a high degree of conservation
between ACE2 in humans and domestic and wild felids (Fig. S3). Compared with the WuhanHu-1 strain, the tiger and lion SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences have 1-3 nucleotide and 0-2
nucleotide differences, respectively (Fig. 4, Tables S9 and S10). These changes resulted in eight

165

non-synonymous substitutions (P139L, L455S, F456Y, G496D, Q613R, D614G, A623T, and
T716I). Notably, of three non-synonymous substitutions (L455S, F456Y, G496D) in the tiger
strains, only one (G496D) was found in available human SARS-CoV-2 strains. These changes
were not observed in the viral sequences from the lions (Fig. 4). Further work is needed to
determine if these changes affect SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding and pathogenicity in felids and

170

humans.

Infections in the tigers and lions occurred at a time before testing was widely available in
the US and there was limited evidence of pre- or asymptomatic viral shedding (14). They also
preceded Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance recommending face
coverings (issued on April 3, 2020) to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Keepers caring for the
175

tigers and lions did not generally wear personal protective equipment (PPE) given the (historical)
low risk of infectious respiratory disease transmission between humans and domestic or nondomestic felid species. Results of this investigation prompted the immediate development of new
protocols for PPE use in the enclosures of non-domestic felids and other known or susceptible
species including mustelids, viverrids, and chiroptera (PPE was already in place for work with

180

non-human primates) at the Bronx Zoo. They also contributed to the development of similar
recommendations by zoo and wildlife organizations (https://www.aza.org/aza-newsreleases/posts/aza-and-aazv-statement-on-covid-19-positive-tiger-in-new-york).
The role of domestic and wild animal species in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is
incompletely understood. To date, the reported number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

185

domestic and wild animal species is low and, to our knowledge, no other zoos worldwide have
confirmed cases in their animals. This is notable when considered in the context of the large
number of human cases and close interactions between people, their pets and wild animals in
their care. However, the fact that companion animals, farmed mink and zoo animals are
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and shed infectious virus in respiratory secretions and/or

190

feces (7, 9) makes the human-animal interface an important area for further studies to elucidate
transmission mechanisms and identify potential reservoirs of infection.
In the last two decades, at least three major coronavirus epidemics (SARS, MERS and
COVID-19) have occurred. A feature shared by these and transmission of other novel viruses to

humans including Ebola and HIV is an origin in a wild animal host. Despite a traditionally held
195

perception of low risk, scientists and conservationists around the world have long recognized and
shared concerns related to human activities that increase human/wildlife interactions and
zoonotic disease transmission risk (15, 16). As long as anthropogenic development and
population growth bring humans and wildlife into ever increasing proximity, legal and illegal
harvesting persists, and consumption of wildlife and wildlife products exists, there will be

200

continued and significant risk of pandemic viral emergence with devastating global impact on
human and animal health, economies, food security, and biodiversity.
