In silico identification of conserved cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2
genome
Abstract
Aim: The aim of this study was to computationally predict conserved RNA sequences and
structures known as cis-acting RNA elements (CREs) located within the SARS-CoV-2
genome. Materials & methods: Bioinformatics tools were used to analyse and predict cisacting regulatory elements by obtaining viral sequences from available databases. Results:
Computational analysis prediction revealed the presence of RNA stem-loop structures within
the 3’ end of the ORF1ab region that are analogous to the previously identified SARS-CoV
genomic packaging signals. Alignment-based RNA secondary structures prediction of the 5’
end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified also conserved CREs. Conclusion: These CREs
could be used as potential targets for a vaccine and/or antiviral therapeutics developments;
however, further studies would be required to confirm their roles in the SARS-CoV-2 life
cycle.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus initially named as 2019-nCoV was found to be
responsible for an outbreak of pneumonia in patients in a seafood market in Wuhan, China (1).
The virus was subsequently renamed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2) and identified to be from the Betacoronavirus genus (2). The SARS-CoV-2 is known to
cause the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which as of May
22, 2020 has caused more than 5 million confirmed cases with more than 332,000 deaths
worldwide according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Although great efforts have
been made for the development of an effective vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, there is
still non available yet. The Coronaviridae family contains a variety of viruses that cause a wide
range of diseases including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in human
and animals (3). Most of the human coronaviruses (HuCoVs) usually cause mild symptoms;
however, two HuCoVs which are known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), were identified to be highly pathogenic
in humans (4,5). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are generally grouped into four genera:
Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (6,7).
CoVs have the largest known genomes among all RNA viruses, which range from about 26
to 32 kilobases in length, and contain enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
molecule (+ve ssRNA) that is capped at the 5’ end and polyadenylated at the 3’ end (8).
SARS-CoV2 shares genomic features with other SARS-like CoVs with complete genomic

similarities of about 88% to bat SARS-like CoVs and 79% to the SARS-CoV (9). The SARSCoV-2 genome is organized into about 13 open reading frames (ORFs), and two-thirds of the
genome occupied by the 5’-terminal overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b which are translated
from the genomic RNA to encode the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b (9,10).
Like most RNA viruses, the genome of CoVs contains cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs)
of RNA sequences and stem-loop structures that interact with RNA and viral or host proteins
to form RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions and facilitate the viral replication,
translation, and genome packaging (11,12). While often these CREs are located at the 5’ and
3’ untranslated regions (UTRs), they can also be found within the coding regions of the CoVs
genome (13–15). These important regions of the viral genome maybe used as targets for the
development of antiviral therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.
Materials and methods
GenBank accession numbers of viral sequences
Viral genomic sequences were retrieved from the GenBank in the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Virus strains and accession ID used in this study are as
follow: (NC_045512.2) for SARS-CoV-2, (NC_004718.3) for SARS-CoV, and (MG772933)
for Bat SARS-like CoV.
Bioinformatics analysis
The RNA secondary structures of the viral genomic sequences were predicted using the
online Mfold Web server at http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/, and RNAfold Web
server at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi (16,17). In addition,
LocARNA Web server at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/LocARNA/Input.jsp was used
for the alignment-based prediction of consensus RNA secondary structures at the 5’-terminal
region of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like CoV, and SARS-CoV genomes (18). The VARNA
Web applet at http://varna.lri.fr/ was then used to draw the RNA secondary structures (19).
Results
Previous studies on some betacoronaviruses such as MHV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV
revealed that the ORF1b region may contain CREs that are suggested to function as
packaging signals (PSs) (20–23). These CREs are functionally and structurally conserved
within the same lineages of betacoronavirus (14). A previous bioinformatics study on the

SARS-CoV genome predicted a stable stem-loop RNA structure at the 3’ end of ORF1b,
encompassing nucleotides (ntds) 19888 to 19950, to be the putative core PS (PScore) of
SARS-CoV (22). A further functional analysis identified the functional PS of the SARS-CoV
as a 580 ntds encompassing the viral genomic RNA from ntds 19712 to 20294, which fold
into a RNA secondary structure including the PScore and binds to the neucleocapsid (N)
protein (23). SARS-CoV-2 shares 87.6% and 79% complete genome similarities with bat
SARS-like CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively (9,24).
Hence, in this study bioinformatics analysis was used to identify if the ORF1b region of
SARS-CoV-2 pocesses such cis-acting RNA elements similar to that observed in SARS-CoV
and other CoVs. To test this hypothesis, genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1b
region were analyzed for RNA secondary structures and compared with the closely related
SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV sequences. RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spanning
ntds 15,000 to 21,541 were first analyzed using RNAfold Web server to predict the minimum
free energy (MFE) (17). Results predicted the lowest free energy located between ntds 19,000
to 20,300 of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1b region (Figure 1). Because this position overlaps with
the genomic PS of the SARS-CoV, which was identified at position ntds 19712 to 20294, the
Mfold Web server was then used to predict the secondary structures of the RNA sequences
spanning ntds 19,712 to 20,294 of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1b region and were compared with
those of SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV (16). The Mfold analysis resulted in differences
in the predicted RNA secondary structures between the three sequences; however, two stable
stem-loops were identified to be similar and observed in all of the three sequences of the
viruses (Figure 2A-C). The predicted two stem-loops (named as SL1 and SL2) located at
position 19,900 – 20,000, 19,839 – 19,943, and 19,903 – 20,000 of the SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV, and bat SARS-like CoV genomes, respectively (Figure 3A-C). The upper part of SL1
which contains 38 ntds is structurally conserved between the three viruses with covariation in
the sequences. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the SL1 is longer than those predicted in SARSCoV and bat SARS-like CoV with 70 ntds in length, whereas its length in the SARS-CoV is
51 ntds, and only the upper part of SL1 is formed in bat SARS-like CoV (Figure 3A-C). The
SL2 is much shorter in SARS-CoV-2 with only 26 ntds in length compared to that predicted
in SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV which contains 51 ntds in both viruses. However, the
genetic sequences of the upper part of SL2 is more conserved among the three viruses than
SL1, with only two nucleotides differences between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat
SARS-like CoV. The first covariant is located at the stem and includes a C-G base pair in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.167916; this version posted June 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

SARS-CoV-2 sequence in place of a U-G base pair found in SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like
CoV (Figure 3A-C). This single nucleotide difference from a C to U maintains the base
pairing of the stem and does not change the amino acid (Leu) of ORF1b (Figure 3A-C). The
second covariant is located at the U-rich loop, and it is the third base in the loop in which this
nucleotide is a U in the SL2 of SARS-CoV-2, whereas it is a G and an A in the SARS-CoV
and bat SARS-like CoV sequences, respectively. However, this single nucleotide difference
changed the amino acid from (Leu) in the case of SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV to
(Phe) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure 3A-C). It should be noted that the SL2 that was
the previously predicted to function as the putative core PS (PScore) of SARS-CoV genome
(22,23). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the predicted RNA stem-loop structures of
SARS-CoV-2 may also have the same role as a putative genomic packaging signal, given the
conservations of the RNA structures and sequences of the SL1 and SL2 of the viruses as well
as the similarities of the genomic location of these predicted RNA structures within the
ORF1b.
Cis-acting regulatory elements of RNA secondary structures and sequences have also been
previously described at the 5’ end of a number of CoVs including members of the
Betacoronavirus genus such as mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus
(BCoV), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV (15). The model of the RNA secondary structures at
the 5’ region of the SARS-CoV genome was previously predicted to fold into eight stemloops (SL1 to SL8) (15). To predict the RNA secondary structures at the 5’-proximal
sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and compare it to that previously identified in the 5’
end of the SARS-CoV genome and also to the closely related bat SARS-like CoV, the first
474 ntds of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analysed using the Mfold Web server. It
should be noted that during the preparation of this manuscript, a recent study has predicted
some conserved RNA structures within the SARS-CoV-2 genome including those RNA
elements at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the viral genome (25). Results of the Mfold analysis
predicted an identical 5’-terminal RNA secondary structures model of the SARS-CoV-2 to
the SARS-CoV model which was previously proposed by Yang et al., with eight RNA stemloops (SL1 to SL8) (Figure 4). In addition, the predicted model in this study is similar to that
recently described in the bioinformatics study by Rangan et al., except that they have
predicted seven stem-loops (SL1 to SL7), while in this study an additional stem-loop (SL8)
was identified which is consistent with the model for SARS-CoV 5’ RNA structure (15,25).
The SL1, SL2, and SL4 are located within the 5’ UTRs of coronavirus genomes and they are

structurally conserved among at least three genera of coronaviruses, with the SL2 being the
most conserved RNA secondary structure at the 5’ UTR of coronavirus genomes (26). In
addition, results also demonstrated that the conserved core leader of the transcriptional
regulatory sequence (TRS-L) region required for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) synthesis is
located within the SL3 which is consistent with previous studies of SARS-CoV and BCoV
(Figure 4) (26). The predicted SL4, which has been shown to be conserved in all CoVs, is
longer than the three preceding stem-loops and contains a short upstream ORF (uORF) that is
found in most CoVs (13,26,27). Moreover, a long stem-loop RNA structure that contains
three hairpin substructures (termed as SL5A, 5B, and 5C) was also identified (Figure 4) (14).
Part of the SL5 is located in the 5’ UTR; however, the AUG initiation codon of the
nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) is located downstream of SL5C at a position similar with
previous studies on SARS-CoV (Figure 4). It should be noted that the SL5ABC is conserved
among betacoronaviruses, suggesting the essential roles of these stem-loops structures as cisacting regulatory elements in the life cycle of CoVs such as viral replication. In agreement
with a previous study on SARS-CoV, the loops of the SL5A and SL5B contain the conserved
5’-UUUCGU-3’ motifs, and this is equivalent to the conserved 5’-UUYCGU-3’ loop
sequences that was found in the SL5ABC of alphacoronaviruses (13,26). Bioinformatics
analysis predicted also three stem-loops (SL6, SL7, and SL8) in the nsp1 coding sequence
similar to that found in the 5’-terminal of the SARS-CoV (Figure 4). However, these RNA
structures are known to be less conserved between CoVs lineages than the stem-loops found
within the 5’ UTR of CoVs genomes.
To further confirm the conservation of the RNA secondary structures located at the 5’ region
of the viral genome among SARS-related viruses, the first 474 ntds of SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV, and bat SARS-like CoV genomes were aligned and folded using LocARNA Web
server (18). Results from sequences alignments indicated that all the RNA stem-loops are
highly conserved among the three viruses, with SL2 and SL3 being the most conserved
among the other stem-loops which have sequences covariation (Figure 5). This high degree
of conservation is expected for SL2 and SL3 because as mentioned above that SL2 is
suggested to be the most conserved RNA elements in the CoVs 5’ UTR region, and SL3,
which is found in SARS-like CoVs and BCoVs, contains the TRS-L sequences that have an
essential role in the synthesis of sgRNA (13,28). These results indicated the high
conservation of the RNA elements at the 5’ end of the SARS-like CoVs genomes, and hence

suggesting that these RNA secondary structures also function as cis-acting regulatory
elements in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.
Discussion
Cis-acting regulatory elements have been described and characterized in the genomes of
several RNA viruses, including picornaviruses, coronaviruses, and noroviruses (11,29,30).
These CREs play important functional roles in the viral life cycle and usually contribute to
the synthesis of viral RNA replication, translation, and genome packaging (11). Previous
studies have identified stem-loop RNA structures, located at the 3’ end of the SARS-CoV
ORF1b, which are recognized by the SARS-CoV structural N protein and suggested to act as
the genomic PS (22,23). Therefore, this work aimed to use bioinformatics tools in order to
identify if the genome of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 shares conserved CREs that are
present within the 5’ end and the ORF1ab regions of the viral genome.
Computational analysis predicted two conserved stem-loops within the 3’ end of the ORF1b
region (named as SL1 and SL2), the latter of which have been previously described to be part
of the SARS-CoV PS and was named as (PScore) (22). The SL2 is more conserved between
the three viruses than SL1, and the top of SL2 is featured with a hexaloop that contains a Urich motif. It should be noted that genomic PSs for different CoVs consist of RNA structure
elements that vary in length and location in the genome of viruses within the same lineages
(14,31). For example, the genomic PS of MERS-CoV which is a lineage C betacoronavirus
was identified in a similar position as the SARS-CoV at the 3’ end of the ORF1ab region
(21). Moreover, the genomic PS is functionally and structurally conserved in lineage A
betacoronaviruses which contains a 95 ntds stem-loop RNA structure and located within the
3’ region of ORF1b (32). However, the genomic PS of transmissible gastroenteritis virus
(TGEV) is located at the 5’-terminal of the viral genome (33). Although this study cannot
conclude the functionality of the predicted RNA stem-loop structures located at the SARSCoV-2 ORF1b region and their roles in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, it is postulated that they
could be functioning similarly as cis-acting elements and hence they could be a putative
genomic PS for the SARS-CoV-2. This is because of (i) the similar position of the viral
genome where these RNA elements locate at the 3’ end of ORF1b, (ii) and also because of
the conserved RNA secondary structures and sequences of these predicted stem-loops when
compared to those found in the closely related SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV.

This study has also used genome sequences at the 5’-proximal region of the SARS-CoV-2
genome to predict consensus conserved RNA secondary structures by comparing with SARSrelated CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV. The predicted model in this study
was similar to a previous model that was described for SARS-CoV, with eight RNA stemloops (SL1-SL8) were identified (15). In addition, this model of RNA structures at the 5’
region of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to a model recently described in a bioinformatics study
with only difference in the SL8 which was not included in that study (25). It has been
suggested that the RNA secondary structures of SL1, SL2, and SL4 are conserved in three
genera of CoVs, whereas SL1, SL2, and SL4 and SL5ABC are conserved among
betacoronaviruses only (15).
Conclusion
In summary, this study used computational tools to predict cis-acting RNA motifs that
present at the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the 3’ end
of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1b region may contain RNA structure elements that are structurally
conserved in other SARS-CoVs, and analogous to the SARS-CoV genomic packaging signal.
In addition, this study also demonstrated and confirmed the predicted RNA secondary
structures at the 5’-proximal region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, further studies
would be required to (i) biochemically confirm these cis-acting RNA elements, (ii) and to
further investigate their roles in the viral life cycles. These important regions within the viral
genome could be then targeted for the development of a vaccine and/or antiviral therapeutics
against this highly important pathogen.

Figure 1. Prediction of minimum free energy (MFE) structures within the SARS-CoV-2
ORF1b region. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 30kb in length that is organized in
thirteen open reading frames (ORFs). The viral genome is flanked by the 5’ and 3’
untranslated regions (UTRs). The ORF1b region is highlighted in red (upper panel), and a
mounting plot represents prediction of the MFE structures spanning nt 15,000 to 21,541 of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, (NC_045512.2) is shown with the highest peak of MFE

Figure 2. Prediction of the ORF1b RNA secondary structures. RNA secondary structures
located at the 3’ end of the ORF1b region of SARS-CoV-2 (nt 19,712 to 20,294) was
predicted using the Mfold Web server (A) and compared with RNA secondary structures at
the same position of SARS-CoV (NC_004718.3) (B) and bat SARS-like CoV (MG772933)
(C). The two identical RNA stem-loops (SL1 and SL2) are indicated in rectangle in the three
viruses.

The viral RNA sequences in the 3’ end of ORF1b region from 19,900 to 20,019 for both
SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like CoV, and in the region of 19,830 to 19,949 for SARS-CoV,
were folded using the Mfold Web server and drawn using the VARNA Web applet to
compare between the predicted RNA stem-loops. The similarities of the RNA structures of
the predicted SL1 and SL2 between the three viruses are highlighted in green and blue,
respectively. In addition, the sequence variation in these two stem-loops are indicated in
black. Note that these two RNA stem-loops are part of the previously identified SARS-CoV
genomic PS, with SL2 being identified as the PScore (22,23).

structures at the 5’ region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (nt 1 to 474) was generated using the
Mfold Web server and drawn using the VARNA Web applet (ΔG = -155.50 kcal/mol). The
eight RNA stem-loops (SL1 to SL8) are indicated, and the conserved core leader TRS region
located within the SL3 is highlighted in grey. In addition, the conserved 5’-UUUCGU-3’
motifs found within the loop of SL5A and SL5B is indicated in boxes, and the AUG that
represents the start codon of the ORF1ab is indicated in red. The SARS-CoV-2 reference
genome sequence obtained from GenBank (NC_045512.2) was used.

SARS-CoVs genomes. The first 474 ntds of the SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like CoV, and
SARS-CoV viral genomes were aligned using LocARNA to predict conserved RNA stemloops at the 5’ end of the viral genomes. Colours indicate the conservation of base pairs types
where red represents conservation of one base pairs and yellow and green indicate two and
three base pairs, respectively. Dark colour represents that all the three virus contain this baspair, whereas light colour shows that one or two of the sequences do not contain the base
pairs.
