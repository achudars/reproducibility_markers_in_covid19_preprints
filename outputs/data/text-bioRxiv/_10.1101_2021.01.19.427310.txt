Abstract

24

A “universal” vaccine design platform that can rapidly generate multiplex vaccine candidates is

25

critically needed to control future pandemics. Here, using SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus as a

26

model, we have developed such a platform by CRISPR engineering of bacteriophage T4. A

27

pipeline of vaccine candidates were engineered by incorporating various viral components into

28

appropriate compartments of phage nanoparticle structure. These include: expressible spike

29

genes in genome, spike and envelope epitopes as surface decorations, and nucleocapsid

30

proteins in packaged core. Phage decorated with spike trimers is found to be the most potent

31

vaccine candidate in mouse and rabbit models. Without any adjuvant, this vaccine stimulated

32

robust immune responses, both TH1 and TH2 IgG subclasses, blocked virus-receptor interactions,

33

neutralized viral infection, and conferred complete protection against viral challenge. This new

34

type of nanovaccine design framework might allow rapid deployment of effective phage-based

35

vaccines against any emerging pathogen in the future.

Introduction

46

Rapid discovery of safe and effective vaccines against emerging and pandemic pathogens

47

such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-21, 2 requires a “universal” vaccine design platform that

48

can be adapted to any infectious agent3, 4. It should allow incorporation of diverse targets, DNAs,

49

and proteins (multicomponent), full-length proteins as well as peptides and domains, in various

50

combinations (multivalent). Such a multiplex platform would not only compress the timeline for

51

vaccine discovery but also offers critical choices for selecting the most effective vaccine

52

candidate(s) without going through iterative design cycles4-6.

53

Numerous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have been developed at record-breaking

54

pace to quell this devastating pandemic and many are in clinical trials5, 7-11. Two of these, both

55

mRNA based, have been approved by FDA for emergency use authorization. However, innovative

56

platforms are still desperately needed because future pathogens might be more complex and their

57

vaccine targets may not be as well-defined3, 4, 11. A drawback of the current platforms is that they

58

are largely limited to a single vaccine target. They also lack sufficient engineering flexibility to

59

generate multiplex vaccines, require strong chemical adjuvants to boost immune responses, and

60

may not be accessible to resource-poor countries4-6,

61

nanovaccine platform by CRISPR engineering of bacteriophage (phage) T4 that can rapidly

62

generate multiplex vaccine candidates against any emerging pathogen during epidemic or

63

pandemic situations.

. Here, we present a “universal”

12

64

Tailed bacteriophages such as T4 are the most abundant and widely distributed organisms

65

on Earth. T4 belongs to myoviridae family, infects Escherichia coli, and has served as an

66

extraordinary model organism in molecular biology and biotechnology13. It consists of a 1200 Å

67

long and 860 Å wide prolate head (or capsid) that encapsidates ~170 kb linear DNA genome, and

68

a ~1400 Å long contractile tail with six long tail fibers emanating from a baseplate present at the

69

tip of the tail14 (Figure 1). The head, the principal component for vaccine design, is assembled

with 155 hexameric capsomers of the major capsid protein gp23* (“*” represents cleaved mature

71

form), 11 pentamers of gp24* at eleven of twelve vertices, and 1 dodecameric portal protein gp20

72

at the unique twelfth vertex15, 16 (Figure 1g).

73

The T4 capsid is coated with two nonessential proteins; Soc (small outer capsid protein)

74

(9.1 kDa; 870 copies per capsid) and Hoc (highly antigenic outer capsid protein) (40.4 kDa; 155

75

copies per capsid)16, 17 (Figure 1g). Soc is a trimer, bound to quasi three-fold axes, and acts as a

76

“molecular clamp” by clasping adjacent capsomers18. Hoc is a 170 Å-long fiber containing a string

77

of four Ig-like domains with its N-terminal domain exposed at the tip of the fiber19. Soc reinforces

78

an already stable T4 capsid while Hoc helps phage to adhere to host surfaces20.

79

The above constitutes an ideal architecture to develop a universal vaccine design template.

80

Further, our four decades of genetic, biochemical, and structural studies on phage T4 including

81

the recently developed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)

82

phage engineering21, 22 provide an extraordinary resource. The atomic structures of all the capsid

83

proteins including Soc, Hoc, as well as the entire capsid have been determined15, 18, 19, 23, 24. Soc

84

and Hoc can be used as efficient adapters to tether foreign proteins to T4 capsid25, 26. Both have

85

nanomolar affinity and exquisite specificity, allowing up to ~1,025 molecules of full-length proteins,

86

domains, and peptides to be arrayed on capsid27, 28. T4 capsids so decorated with pathogen

87

epitopes mimic PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) of natural viruses and stimulate

88

strong innate as well as adaptive immune responses29.

89

To develop a universal vaccine design template, we took advantage of a large amount of

90

nonessential genetic space available in T4 genome. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model pathogen,

91

we inserted a number of viral components into phage including spike (S)30, 31, envelope (E)32, and

92

nucleocapsid proteins (NP)2,

93

Video). These were then combined by simple phage infections to create a collection of

94

recombinant phages containing different combinations of vaccine targets. In a few weeks, a

95

pipeline of vaccine candidates in dozens of combinations were generated, demonstrating the

33

by CRISPR engineering as DNA and/or protein (Figure 1a-d;

96

unprecedented engineering power and flexibility of this approach. When tested in mouse and

97

rabbit models, one of the candidates, T4 phage decorated with S-trimers (Figure 1e-g; Video)

98

elicited robust immunogenicity and ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2) receptor34 blocking

99

and virus neutralizing antibodies that conferred complete protection against virus challenge in a

100

mouse model.

101

Our studies thus established a “blueprint” for a new type of nanovaccine framework for

102

rapid and multiplex design of effective vaccine candidates that can potentially be applied to any

103

emerging pathogen in the future.

Construction of T4-SARS-CoV-2 recombinant phages by CRISPR engineering

127

A series of CRISPR-E. coli strains were constructed by inserting SARS-CoV-2 gene

128

segments into T4 phage genome. Each strain harbored two plasmids (Fig. 2a); a “spacer” plasmid

129

expressing the genome-editing nuclease, either type II Cas9 or type V Cpf1, and CRISPR RNAs

130

(crRNAs or “spacer” RNAs) corresponding to target protospacer sequence(s) in phage genome,

131

and a second “donor” plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. The latter also has ~500

132

bp homologous flanking arms of phage genome corresponding to the point of insertion. Four

133

nonessential regions of the genome were chosen for insertion of various SARS-CoV-2 genes (Fig.

134

2b, I-IV). When these E. coli were infected by T4, a double-stranded break would occur in the

135

protospacer sequence by Cas9 or Cpf1 that inactivates the phage genome and no phage should

136

be produced. However, the highly recombinogenic T4 phage allows efficient recombination

137

between the cleaved DNA and the donor plasmid through the flanking homologous arms,

138

transferring the CoV-2 gene into phage genome and propagating it as part of phage infection (Fig.

139

2a). The same strategy was used to introduce many other genetic modifications including

140

deletions by simply creating that modification in the donor plasmid and various modifications were

141

combined as desired by simple phage infections of appropriate CRISPR E. coli (Fig. 1).

142

Initially, we constructed “acceptor” phages by deleting certain known nonessential segments

143

of the phage genome35; ~18 kb FarP, ~11-kb 39-56, or both (~29 kb), that created space for CoV-

144

2 insertions (Supplementary Fig.1a,b). But the yields of these phages were low, ~1-2 orders of

145

magnitude lower than the wild-type (WT) phage (Supplementary Fig.1a,b). Since yield is critical

146

for vaccine manufacture, we then constructed shorter deletions in which ~700 bp SegF within 39-

147

56 and ~7 kb segment within FarP were deleted (Fig. 2b I, II). The yields of these phages

148

(7del.SegFdel.T4) were similar to the WT phage, suitable for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design.

149

Next, three spike gene variants31 corresponding to i) 1273-amino acid (aa) WT full-length

150

(S-fl), ii) 1208 aa ectodomain (S-ecto, aa 1-1208), and iii) 227 aa receptor binding domain (RBD,

151

aa 319-545) were engineered as expressible cassettes and inserted into 7del.SegFdel. T4 (Fig.

152

2b, Supplementary Fig. 1c). The spike genes were codon-optimized and kept under the control

153

of a strong mammalian expression promoter, either CMV or CAG, and a human CD5 signal

154

peptide fused to the N-terminus for efficient secretion (Fig. 2b I, II, Supplementary Fig. 1d). The

155

S-ectodomain recombinant contained additional mutations including six proline substitutions that

156

imparted greater stability and ~10-fold greater expression, as was described by Hsieh et al.31 (Fig.

157

2b, Supplementary Fig. 1d).

158

Control CRISPR E. coli containing Cas9/Cpf1-spacer plasmid but lacking the spike gene

159

donor plasmids yielded very few or no plaques when infected with 7del.SegFdel phage (plating

160

efficiency, <10-4 to 10-3; Fig. 2c,d, Supplementary Fig. 1e) whereas those containing both the

161

plasmids produced plaques at a recombination frequency of up to ~4.5% (Fig. 2d,e). DNA

162

sequencing confirmed that >95% of these plaques were true recombinants with correct insert (Fig.

163

2f) and showed similar plaque forming ability as the WT phage (Fig. 2g). A similar CRISPR

164

strategy was used for creating deletions and/or insertions at the other sites [internal protein (IP)II,

165

IPIII, Hoc, and Soc] (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 1f).

Encapsidation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP)

194

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have been reported to generate robust NP-specific immune

195

responses including cytotoxic T cells that might be important for protection and virus clearance33,

196

36

197

NP molecules inside phage capsid along with the genome. As NP is a nucleic acid binding protein,

198

the packaged phage genome might provide an appropriate environment to localize this protein37.

199

During T4 phage morphogenesis, the major capsid protein gp23 assembles around a

200

scaffolding core formed by a cluster of proteins including three nonessential, highly basic, internal

201

proteins IPI, IPII, and IPIII. Following assembly, while most of the scaffold proteins are degraded

202

and expelled from capsid (Fig. 3a), the IPs are cleaved only once, next to a ~10 aa N-terminal

203

capsid targeting sequence (CTS; MKTYQEFIAE). The cleaved CTS leaves the capsid but ~1,000

204

molecules of IPs, or any foreign protein fused to CTS, remain in the “expanded” capsid38 (Fig. 3a).

205

To replace IPs with NP, we first created an IPIII deletion phage using appropriate spacer and

206

donor (Supplementary Fig. 2a, Fig. 3b). Then, a CTS-NP fusion sequence was transferred into

207

this phage under the control of the native IPIII promoter (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Next, IPII was

208

deleted to reduce protein packaging competition and increase the copy number of NP

209

(Supplementary Fig. 2a, Fig. 3b,c). We have also introduced an amber mutation into the CTS

210

sequence [TTT (Phe) at aa 7] because, for unknown reasons, the donor plasmid containing the

211

WT CTS sequence was found to be toxic to E. coli. This CTSam-NP phage when grown on a

212

tRNA amber suppressor-containing E. coli (Sup1) expressed NP and encapsidated it as

213

demonstrated by Western blotting (WB) with NP-specific monoclonal Abs (Fig. 3c, Supplementary

214

Fig. 2b,c). The copy number is about 70 NP molecules per phage capsid (Supplementary Fig.

215

2d).

. We incorporated NP into the T4 nanoparticle by designing a CRISPR strategy that packaged

these epitopes would be exposed at the tip of ~170 Å-long Hoc fiber19. The Ee and Ec recombinant

phages indeed showed an upward shift of the Hoc band upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3f; yellow and

265

magenta arrows). However, only the 12-aa Ee peptide was displayed at the maximum copy

266

number, up to ~155 copies per capsid, while the 18-aa Ec peptide showed lower epitope copies

267

and also affected phage yield (Fig. 3f).

Display of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain on T4 phage

270

We used a similar strategy to display CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)34 on the capsid

271

surface as a Soc-fusion (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). However, the copy number of the displayed

272

RBD was very low (Supplementary Fig. 3c). RBD contains ~82.5% non-hydrophilic residues and

273

formed insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). Numerous N- and C-

274

terminal truncations of RBD were constructed (Supplementary Fig. 4a), however none (including

275

the shortest 67-aa receptor binding motif34) had shown significant improvement in solubility and

276

copy number (Supplementary Fig. 4b). We therefore resorted to alternative strategies to display

277

RBD on phage capsid.

278

First, we constructed E. coli expressing Soc-RBD from a plasmid under the control of the

279

phage T7 promoter to determine if pre-expression of Soc-RBD for a short period of time (~10 min)

280

would keep it sufficiently soluble, which could then assemble on capsids produced during phage

281

infection. Indeed, phage isolated from these infections showed improved display, ~100 copies of

282

RBD (sRBD) per phage particle (Fig. 3g,h).

283

Second, we deployed the well-established Spytag-SpyCatcher technology39 to display RBD

284

on T4 phage. The optimized SpyCatcher and Spytag from Streptococcus pyogenes, interact

285

with >picomole affinity (approaching “infinite” affinity; second-order rate constant: 5.5 × 105 M−1

286

s−1) and exquisite specificity that then leads to covalent linkage39. To display RBD, phage

287

decorated with the 12.6-kDa soluble SpyCatcher was produced by growing the T4-Spike-Ee-NP-

288

SocΔ phage on E. coli expressing Soc-SpyCatcher fusion protein from the T7 expression plasmid

289

(Supplementary Fig. 3f, Fig. 3g). Phage prepared from these infections contained up to ~600

290

copies of Soc-SpyCatcher per capsid (Fig. 3i).

291

Third, RBD was expressed as SUMO-RBD-Spytag fusion protein in E. coli. The SUMO

292

domain is expected to enhance the solubility of RBD40, but resulted in only a small improvement

293

(Supplementary Fig. 3g). Therefore, the SUMO-RBD-Spytag protein was purified from insoluble

294

inclusion bodies by urea denaturation and refolding (rRBD), and was displayed in vitro on the

295

SpyCatcher phage (Fig. 3j). SDS-PAGE and WB of the phage particles showed that the SUMO-

296

RBD-Spytag was efficiently captured by the SpyCatcher phage as shown by the disappearance

297

of the SpyCatcher band and appearance of higher molecular weight band(s) (Fig. 3k). The copy

298

number was ~300 rRBD molecules per capsid (Fig. 3k).

299

The sRBD and rRBD phages produced as above (T4-Spike-Ee-CTSam-NP-sRBD and T4-

300

Spike-Ee-CTSam-NP-rRBD) bound to human ACE2 receptor protein34 (Fig 3l, Supplementary Fig.

301

5a), and to some of the RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies

302

(pAbs) but not to all (Fig. 3m to 3o, Supplementary Fig. 5b to 5d). However, these RBDs exhibited

303

considerably lower binding when compared to mammalian-expressed RBD suggesting that the E.

304

coli-produced RBDs were not properly folded (Fig. 3p). This was also consistent with the co-

305

purification of a 65-kDa E. coli GroEL chaperone with RBD indicating the presence of partially

306

folded and/or misfolded RBD (Supplementary Fig. 3e).

driven by the phage T7 promoter. Most of the expressed Soc-SpyCatcher protein remained in the
supernatant indicating its high solubility. g. Solubility analysis of SUMO-RBD-Spytag. SUMORBD-Spytag is insoluble, similar to Soc-RBD.

Decoration of phage T4 nanoparticles with spike ectodomain trimers

342

Next, we displayed spike ectodomain (S-ecto) trimers (S-trimer) (433.5 kDa)31 on T4-

343

Spike-Ee-NP-SocΔ phage. The pre-fusion stabilized hexa-Pro S-ectodomain construct described

344

as above31 was fused to a 16-aa spytag at the C-terminus and expressed in ExpiCHO cells. The

345

ectodomain trimers secreted into the culture medium were purified by HisTrap affinity

346

chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). These trimers

347

appeared authentic and native-like because: i) they migrated predominantly as a single species

348

and showed no nonspecific aggregation, which usually appears as a peak (or shoulder) near void

349

volume and as a smeary high molecular weight species on native gel (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b),

350

and ii) they bound efficiently to human ACE2 receptor (Supplementary Fig. 6c) and to

351

conformation-specific RBD mAbs (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Importantly, the S-trimers were

352

efficiently captured by the SpyCatcher phage produced as above. Binding was so strong that

353

efficient assembly occurred by simple mixing of trimers and phage even at an equimolar ratio of

354

S-trimers to T4-spycatcher molecules (Fig. 4a,b). The copy number was ~100 S-trimers per phage

355

capsid (Fig. 4b). Cryo-EM showed decoration of T4 phage capsids with S-trimers (Fig. 4c),

356

mimicking the orientation of spikes on SARS-CoV-2 virion41. The trimer-decorated T4 phage

357

efficiently bound to human ACE2 receptor (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 7a) and when co-

358

displayed with GFP, it decorated the ACE2-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig.

Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of T4-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates

The T4-CoV-2 vaccine candidates generated as above by sequential engineering

401

(Supplementary Fig. 8a,b) were screened for their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a

402

mouse model. BALB/c mice were immunized at weeks 0, 3, and 6 with CsCl-purified phage

403

particles (Fig. 5a,b) and sera were analyzed by a series of immunological assays.

404

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers were determined by ELISA using purified proteins (S-

405

ecto, RBD, NP, or E) as coating antigens. Recombinant phages that delivered CoV-2 DNA alone

406

did not induce significant titers of spike protein-specific antibodies (Fig. 5c,d, Supplementary Fig.

407

9a to 9d). However, when the same were boosted once with phage nanoparticles displayed with

408

S-trimers, significant antibody titers were elicited (Supplementary Fig. 10a).

409

Without any adjuvant, the T4 nanoparticles stimulated strong antibody titers to phage-

410

delivered proteins/peptides, either displayed on surface or packaged inside. These include RBD-

411

and spike-specific antibodies, E-specific antibodies, and NP-specific antibodies (Fig. 5c to 5f).

412

However, the highest titers, up to an endpoint titer of ~1.5 x 106, were obtained with phage

413

nanoparticles decorated with S-trimers (Fig. 5c to 5f). Most of these antibodies are RBD-specific

414

since no significant difference was observed between the endpoint titers obtained by using either

415

RBD or S-trimers as the coating antigen (Fig 5c,d). This result is consistent with recent reports

416

that the immunodominant RBD comprises multiple distinct antigenic sites and is the target of most

417

neutralizing activity in COVID-19 convalescent sera42, 43.

418

Furthermore, the antibodies elicited were conformation-specific. For instance, the antibodies

419

elicited against sRBD or rRBD displayed on phage reacted poorly with the mammalian-expressed

420

S-trimer or RBD (Fig 5c,d), consistent with the antigenicity data described above that these also

421

reacted poorly with ACE2 and conformation-specific mAbs (Fig. 3p, Supplementary Fig. 5e).

422

Similarly, the antibodies elicited against T4-dispalyed S-trimers reacted poorly with the E.coli-

423

produced RBD (end point titer of ~102 using E. coli RBD as the coating antigen vs ~105 using

424

mammalian RBD) (Supplementary Fig. 10d).

425

The spike-specific titers elicited by phage-decorated trimers without any adjuvant were as

426

high as those generated with Alhydrogel adjuvant (Fig. 5c,d,g). Furthermore, notably, IgG

427

subclass data indicated that phage nanoparticles stimulated both humoral (TH2) and cellular (TH1)

428

arms of the immune system. In mice, IgG2a subclass represents TH1 response whereas IgG1

429

class reflects TH2 response. The adjuvant-free T4 nanoparticles mounted high levels of both IgG1

430

and IgG2a classes against all three SARS-CoV-2 antigens; spike/RBD, E, and NP, whereas the

431

Alhydrogel-adjuvanted trimers predominantly elicited TH2-derived IgG1 class antibodies (Fig. 5h,

432

Supplementary Fig. 9a to 9j). In fact, the TH1-derived IgG2a antibodies were higher than the TH2

433

derived IgG1 antibodies in T4 groups, whereas the Alhydrogel-adjuvanted mice induced ≥2 orders

434

of magnitude lower IgG2a antibodies (Fig. 5h, Supplementary Fig. 9i,j). While TH2-biased

435

responses may lead to lung injury via eosinophilic infiltrates, the TH1-type responses are proposed

436

to alleviate potential lung immunopathology and reduce the potential for disease enhancement44,

437

45

438

optimal for safety and virus clearance. This point however requires further investigation.

. The T4 nanoparticle vaccine with a balanced TH1 and TH2 responses might therefore be

439

The T4-stimulated spike-specific antibodies blocked binding of RBD to human ACE-2

440

expressed on HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5i, Supplementary Fig. 9k).

441

Importantly, these antibodies also exhibited strong virus neutralizing activity as determined by

442

Vero E6 cell cytopathic assay using the live BSL-3 SARS-CoV-2 US-WA-1/2020 strain, the first

443

patient isolate obtained through the CDC46 (Fig. 5j). The neutralization titers correlated well with

444

protective efficacy when mice were challenged with mouse-adapted BSL-3 SARS-CoV-2 MA10

445

virus47 (Fig. 5k,l).

446

Upon challenge, the naïve and T4 control mice showed rapid decline in weight, up to 25%

447

of their starting weight in five days due to acute viral infection, and were moribund (humanely

448

euthanized) or succumbed to infection. After day 5, the surviving mice began to re-gain weight

449

and recovery from infection during the next several days (Fig. 5k,l). This rapid weight loss resulted

450

in ~80% mortality rate in the control animals (Fig. 5k,l). None of the groups receiving the spike

451

DNA vaccine alone and/or CoV-2 antigens other than spike trimers showed significant protection,

452

closely correlating to the lack or extremely weak neutralization antibody responses. However, E.

453

coli RBD groups (G6 and G7) showed less weight loss and higher survival rate than the

454

susceptible control groups (G3 and G4) (Fig. 5k,l). On the other hand, mice vaccinated with T4-

455

decorated trimers exhibited profound neutralization antibody responses and were fully protected

456

from the acute onset of morbidity (weight loss and other signs of illness) and mortality. The weight

457

loss, if any, was insignificant for both these groups, as well as the positive control group

458

vaccinated with Alhydrogel-adjuvanted trimers (Fig. 5k,l). Additionally, those mice boosted with

459

one dose of T4-trimers also showed partial protection. The weight loss was in between

460

unprotected and protected groups, with a milder weight loss than the unimmunized and

461

challenged controls, clearly correlating protection with spike-specific antibodies (Supplementary

462

Fig. 10b,c).

463

Next, we evaluated the most effective T4 phage-decorated S-trimers vaccine in a second

464

animal model, the New Zealand White rabbit (Fig. 6a). This vaccine, again without any adjuvant,

465

by just two immunizations at days 0 and 15, elicited robust spike- and RBD-specific antibodies

466

and virus neutralization titers in rabbits that are ~5-6 times greater than those obtained in mice,

467

(Fig. 6b to 6d, Supplementary Fig. 11). Likewise, inclusion of displayed Ee peptide and packaged

468

NP into the nanoparticle broadened the immune responses (Fig. 6e,f) while addition of a TH1-

469

biased adjuvant Alhydroxyquim-II only slightly enhanced the antibody titers (Fig. 6b to 6d).

470

Together, these datasets allowed selection of a highly effective T4 phage vaccine candidate

471

that generated robust virus neutralization titers in two different animal models, mouse and rabbit,

472

and conferred complete protection against acute viral infection in mice.

Discussion

572

We have developed a “universal” vaccine platform centered around bacteriophage T4

573

nanoparticle and CRISPR engineering (Figure 1; Video). A number of special features

574

demonstrated here would make this a powerful platform to rapidly generate vaccine candidates

575

against any emerging and pandemic pathogen in the future.

576

First, a series of recombinant phages containing SARS-CoV-2 gene insertions were created

577

in days, by CRISPR genome engineering using a combination of type II Cas9 and type V Cpf1

578

nucleases. This combination provided built-in choices for spacers as well as for efficient cleavage

579

of T4 genome that is extensively modified by cytosine hydroxymethylation and glycosylation, to

580

attain near 100% success21, 22.

581

Second, a large amount of genetic and structural space available in phage T435 was

582

exploited to incorporate payloads containing CoV-2 DNAs, peptides, proteins, and/or complexes

583

into the same nanoparticle. For instance, we have inserted ~6.5 kb full-length spike gene

584

expression cassette, 2.7 kb RBD gene expression cassette, and 1.3 kb nucleocapsid gene into

585

the same genome by replacing nonessential genetic material of T4. It was further expanded by

586

inserting Hoc and Soc fusions, and/or replacing additional nonessential segments that span

587

across the phage genome. In addition, up to 155 copies of a 12-aa Ee peptide and ~100 copies

588

of 433-kDa S-trimers were displayed on the same nanoparticle while ~70 molecules of 50-kDa

589

NP were co-packaged with genome core. These represent unprecedented engineering capability

590

and payload complexity by a vaccine delivery vehicle.

591

Third, different compartments of phage nanostructure were utilized for placing different

592

vaccine cargos. The tips of Hoc fibers with ~170Å reach were used to display short 12-aa Ee

593

peptide epitopes as this would allow efficient capture by antigen presenting cells, and B and T

594

cells29. Indeed, these elicited strong antibody titers. At the same time, NP was co-packaged with

595

genome as this mimics NP’s natural nucleic acid environment2, 37.

596

Fourth, the T4 platform was readily adapted to mammalian-expressed proteins through

597

highly efficient SpyCatcher-SpyTag bridging39. This might be essential for proper folding and

598

glycosylation of some pathogen antigens, as in the case of spike trimers30. As the Cryo-EM

599

images showed, such spikes anchored to capsid mimic the spikes on SARS-CoV-2 virion41

600

providing a native-like context for stimulating effective immune responses.

601

Fifth, alternative strategies such as pre-expression from a plasmid and display through

602

subsequent phage infection provided additional advantages to enhance copy number and better

603

control over folding. As demonstrated, this approach yielded 3-6-fold higher copy number of Soc-

604

SpyCatcher on phage capsid. However, the hydrophobic RBD remained poorly folded.

605

Sixth, our sequential engineering generated a pipeline of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates

606

in mere weeks, and allowed down-selection of the best vaccine candidate, the phage-decorated
29

607

trimers, in a single mouse experiment. However, why the DNA-alone vaccines failed to elicit

608

immune responses remains unclear and requires further investigation.

609

Seventh, unlike the DNAs, all the phage-delivered peptides/proteins, whether displayed on

610

surface or packaged inside, generated robust immune responses. The strong virus neutralization

611

titers and ACE-2 blocking titers elicited by T4-delivered trimers in two different animal models,

612

mouse and rabbit, are particularly noteworthy. These responses correlated with protective efficacy

613

where the vaccinated mice were completely protected from acute viral infection.

614

Eighth, T4 nanoparticle vaccines generated balanced TH1 and TH2 derived antibody

615

responses against all three CoV-2 antigens tested. In fact, T4 seems to have a slight TH1-bias.

616

These are desirable properties for protection and distinguish this PAMP-like T4 platform from

617

other subunit vaccine platforms and adjuvant systems28, 29, 48, 49.

618

Ninth, the T4 nanoparticle vaccine does not require any adjuvant to stimulate robust anti-

619

CoV-2 immune responses, as demonstrated in two animal models. In addition to reducing cost

620

and manufacturing complexity, the adjuvant-less T4 vaccine formulations might provide a safe

621

alternative because reactogenicity to vaccines is often associated with chemical adjuvants used

622

in traditional vaccine formulations. In numerous immunizations with T4 phage, in a variety of

623

animal models including mouse, rat, rabbit, and macaque, no significant adverse reactions were

624

noted28, 48-50.

625

Finally, our best T4 vaccine candidate elicited, in addition to spike-specific antibodies, broad

626

antibody responses against two additional virion components, E that is exposed on the surface

627

and NP that is abundantly present on SARS-CoV-2 infected host cells32, 33. Furthermore, the

628

spycatcher phage could serve as a “plug-and play” backbone to capture ectodomain trimers from

629

other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS2, or any spytagged antigen(s) from other

630

infectious agents. Thus, it is conceivable that different vaccine formulations can be “created” at

631

the site of administration by mixing the spycatcher T4 phage with the desired antigen(s)

632

combinations. Co-carrying multiple and distinct antigens in the same formulation increase the

633

breadth of immune responses51, 52 and since regions of S-ecto, Ee, and NP are conserved in other

634

coronaviruses1, 2, the T4 vaccine platform might be considered for expanded protection.

635

In conclusion, we have developed a versatile “universal” nanovaccine design template by

636

which vaccine candidates can be rapidly generated, evaluated in animal models, and transitioned

637

to human clinical trials as is being done currently with the T4-CoV-2 vaccine. As T4 is a highly

638

stable nanoparticle, has good safety profile, and can be manufactured at a relatively low cost, it

639

provides a robust platform to rapidly generate effective vaccines against any epidemic or

640

pandemic pathogen in the future, particularly when multivalent vaccines are essential to protect

641

global communities.

The expression vector pET28b (Novagen, MA) was used for donor plasmid construction and
protein expression plasmid construction. The spacer plasmids LbCpf1 and SpCas9 were
constructed as described previously21, 22. The DNA fragments containing NP and RBD were
codon-optimized for E.coli expression and synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher). The
plasmids containing wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) gene and S-ecto-6P gene were
provided by Drs. Barney Graham, and Kizzmekia S. Corbett (National Institutes of Health), and
Dr. Jason S. McLellan (University of Texas, Austin), respectively. The RBD gene for mammalian
expression was amplified from the WT Spike (S) gene. SpyCatcher/Spy-tag and SUMO
containing plasmids were purchased from Addgene (#133449 and #111560).

proteins. E. coli P301 (sup0) and E. coli B834 (hsdRB hsdMB met thi sup0) were used for the
propagation and recombination of phages without amber mutations. The E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIPL
transformed with amber-suppressor-1 plasmid and E. coli B40 (sup1) were used for propagation
and recombination of phages with amber mutations (CTS-amber-NP). WT T4 phage was
propagated on E.coli P301 or B834 and used as a starting phage for CRISPR engineering.

CRISPR-LbCpf1/SpCas9 plasmid was constructed based on the streptomycin-resistant plasmid
DS-SPCas (Addgene no. 48645) as described previously21, 22. The spacer containing fragments
were prepared by annealing and extension of two amplified DNA fragments containing 26 bp
complementary nucleotides (overlap extension PCR). The spacer fragment digested with
restriction enzymes XhoI and EagI was cloned into linearized LbCpf1/SpCas9 plasmid.

were constructed by two rounds of cloning. First, the multiple cloning site (MCS) (NcoI, NdeI, NheI,
and BmtI)-linker (4GGS)-Soc-linker (2GGGGS)-MCS (HindIII, EagI, NotI, and XhoI) was amplified
using Soc-plasmid template and cloned into the pET28b DNA linearized with NcoI and XhoI
restriction enzymes to generate pET28b-MCS-L-Soc-L-MCS. Second, DNAs corresponding to
SpyCatcher, SUMO, Spy, and various RBDs were amplified and inserted to 3’- or 5’- MCS of
pET28b-MCS-L-Soc-L-MCS as needed. CTS-NP and Ee-Hoc expression fragments were
amplified using synthesized NP and T4 genomic DNA respectively, and cloned into NcoI and
XhoI-linearized pET28b.

The plasmids for expression in mammalian cells, including pCMV-CD5-RBD, pCAG-CD5-S-fl,
pCAG-CD5-S-ecto-6P, and pCAG-CD5-S-ecto-6P-Spytag, were constructed using standard
protocols. The RBD fragment was amplified using the WT spike gene, and CD5 secretion leading
peptide (MPMGSLQPLATLYLLGMLVASVLA) was added to the N terminus of RBD by PCR. The
CD5-RBD was directionally cloned into pAAV vector (Cell Biolabs) using the HindIII and XhoI
restriction enzyme sites (pCMV-CD5-RBD). For the construction of pCAG-CD5-S-fl, pCAG-CD5S-ecto-6P, and pCAG-CD5-S-ecto-6P-Spytag, plasmids pCAG-S-fl and pCAG-S-ecto-6P were
used as template and backbone. The CD5 fragment was cloned into N terminus of S-fl or S-ecto6P using KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites. Similarly, Spytag (RGVPHIVMVDAYKRYK) was cloned
into the C terminus of S-ecto using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. All the constructed plasmids
were sequenced to confirm 100% accuracy of the recombinant fragment (Retrogen, CA).

Plaque assays were performed to determine the efficiency of the individual spacers to restrict T4
phage infection. The CRISPR-Cpf1/Cas9 spacer plasmid was transformed into E. coli strains
B834 or B40. Serially diluted T4 phages, in the range of 101 to 107 plaque forming units (pfu) in
100 μl Pi-Mg buffer (26 mM Na2HPO4, 68 mM NaCl, 22 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5), were
mixed with 350 μl of spacer-containing E. coli (~108 cells/ml). E. coli cells without spacer were
used as a control. After incubation at 37°C for 7 min, 3.5 ml of 0.75% top agar with spectinomycin
(50 μg/mL) was added to each tube, mixed, and poured onto LB plate. The plates were incubated
at 37°C overnight to allow the formation of plaques. The pfu were counted on each plate and the
efficiency of plating (EOP) was determined by dividing the pfu produced from infection of E. coli
containing a spacer with the input pfu.

The CRISPR-Cpf1/Cas9 spacer plasmid and the corresponding donor plasmid were cotransformed into E. coli strains, either B834/P301 without amber suppressor, or B40/RIPL with
amber suppressor. E.coli cells transformed with single plasmids, either the donor plasmid or the
CRISPR spacer plasmid, were used as controls. An appropriate amount of T4 phages, as
determined by the EOP as described above, were added to E. coli and incubated for 7 min at
37ºC. After adding 3.5 ml of 0.75% top agar containing 50 μg/ml spectinomycin and 50 μg/ml
kanamycin, the infection mixture was poured onto LB plate and incubated overnight. Single
plaques, namely Generation 1 (G1), were picked using a sterile Pasteur glass pipet and
transferred into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of Pi-Mg buffer. After 20 min incubation
at room temperature with gentle vortexing every 5 min, serially diluted G1 phages were used to

infect spacer-containing E. coli cells (50 μg/ml spectinomycin). This eliminated any parental phage
background under CRISPR pressure. The resultant single G2 plaques were picked and used to
infect E. coli cells (without spacer or donor) to produce purified G3 phages. Single G3 plaques
were then picked into 200 μl of Pi-Mg buffer. PCR analysis was performed to confirm DNA deletion
or foreign gene insertion. One microliter of G3 phages were denatured at 94ºC for 8 min and used
as a template for PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher). The
amplified DNA fragment was purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced
(Retrogene). The G3 phages in which the recombinant DNA sequence was confirmed with 100%
accuracy were selected and a few drops of chloroform were added. These plaque-purified “zero
stocks” were stored at 4ºC. More rounds of CRISPR gene editing were similarly introduced into
the same phage as needed as described above.

E. coli strains B40 or B834 were used for the production of amber-phage or non-amber-phage,
respectively. Fresh overnight E. coli cells were inoculated in 1 L of Moore’s media (20 g tryptone,
15 g yeast extract powder, 2 g dextrose, 8 g NaCl, 2 g Na2HPO4, 1 g KH2PO4, dissolved in 1 L
MQ water) at 1/50 dilution, and then grown at 37˚C for 2-2.5 hr in a shaker incubator at 200 RPM.
When the cells reached a density of ~4 X 108/ml, phages were added at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.5. The infection mixture was cultured at 37˚C, 200 RPM, for another 2.5 -3 hr and
periodically checked under the microscope. As the cells get infected with phage, the shape of
cells change from long bacilli to short dumbbell shape. When the cell number started dropping,
the culture was transferred to Sorvall GSA bottle and centrifuged at 27, 504 g for 1 hr at 4 ˚C. The
supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml Pi-Mg buffer containing 10
µg/ml DNase I (or Benzonase) and one tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail. The resuspended
pellet was added with 5 ml chloroform and incubated at 37ºC for 1 hr to lyse the bacteria and
release the phage. The debris was removed by low-speed centrifugation at 4,302 g for 10 min.
The phage-containing supernatant was transferred to a sterile falcon tube and the pellet was
discarded. The titer of this phage stock was determined using E. coli B40 or B834. The working
stock of phages can be stored at 4˚C for long periods of time with a few drops of chloroform added
to prevent microbial contamination, or used as seed phage to make SpyCatcher or Soc-RBD
displayed phage, or purified as a vaccine candidate for animal studies.

For purification of phage, ~50 ml phage stock was distributed into 5 Corex glass tubes (10 ml
each) and sealed with parafilm. The phage stock was centrifuged at 34,540 g for 1 hr using a
Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant was discarded and the phage-containing pellet was
resuspended with 1-3 ml Pi-Mg buffer plus 5 µl Benzonase overnight at 4˚C. Next, the
resuspended phages were loaded onto a CsCl gradient and centrifuged at 152,000 g for 1 hr in a
Beckman ultracentrifuge using a SW 55Ti swinging bucket rotor. The purified phage band
localized between CsCl densities 1.46 and 1.55 was collected by inserting a syringe right below
the phage band and aspirating the band. The phages were dialyzed in high-salt Tris-Mg buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) for 4 hr followed by low-salt Tris-Mg buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) overnight. The second-round CsCl
centrifugation and dialysis of purified phages were applied to obtain purer phages. Two-roundCsCl-purified phages were further purified by passing through a 0.22 µm filter to remove any
minor bacterial contaminants. The phage concentration and copy numbers of displayed antigens
were quantified by 4-20% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

used for the production of Soc-Spycatcher (or Soc-RBD) displayed and NP protein packaged
phage. Briefly, the RIPL cells were inoculated into 1 L of Moore’s Media at 1/50 dilution with
appropriate antibiotics (RIPL-Soc-Spycatcher: 50 μg/ml Kanamycin+ 37 μg/ml Chloramphenicol;
RIPL-Soc-Spycatcher-Amber Suppressor: 50 μg/ml Kanamycin + 37 μg/ml Chloramphenicol +
100 μg/ml Ampicillin). The culture was incubated at 37ºC, 200 RPM, for 2.5-3 hr. When the cells
reached a density of ~4 X 108/ml, 0.5 mM IPTG was added for induction of recombinant protein
expression. At 10 min post IPTG addition, the corresponding phages (Hoc-del/Soc-del/IPIIdel/IPIII-del) were added to infect cells at an MOI of 0.5. The culture was further incubated at
37˚C, 200RPM, for 3 hr. The following phage production and purification procedures are the same
as described above.

Plasmid pCAG-CD5-S-ecto-6P-Spytag was transiently transfected into ExpiCHO cells using
ExpiFectamine CHO transfection kit (Thermo Fisher). After 18-22 hr of transfection, cells were
supplemented with ExpiCHO Feed and Enhancer and grown at 32°C according to the
manufacturer’s High Titer protocol. Cultures were harvested 8-10 days after transfection by
centrifuging the cells at 3000 g for 20 min at 4˚C. The supernatant was clarified through a 0.22
µm filter and then loaded on a HisTrap HP column (Cytiva) previously equilibrated with wash
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole), at a flow rate of
1 ml/min, using AKTA Prime-Plus liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Protein-bound
column was washed with wash buffer until the UV absorbance reached the baseline to remove
non-specifically bound proteins. The trimers were eluted using a 20 mM-300 mM linear gradient
of imidazole. HisTRAP eluted peak fractions were pooled and applied to a Hi-Load 16/600
Superdex-200 (preparation grade) size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the
gel filtration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl) to obtain purified trimers, using the
ÄKTA FPLC system. Eluted fractions were collected, filtered through 0.22 µm filter unit, flashfrozen, and stored at −80 °C until use.

In vitro display of S-trimer/rRBD on the T4-SpyCatcher phage was assessed by co-sedimentation
as described previously with some modifications27, 28. Briefly, two-round CsCl purified and 0.22
µm filtered phage particles were sedimented for 45 min at 34,000 g in Protein-LoBind Eppendorf
tubes, washed twice with sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4), and
resuspended in PBS buffer (pH 7.4). S-trimer/rRBD was sedimented for 25 min at 34,000 g to
remove any possible aggregates present in the sample. T4-SpyCatcher phages were incubated
with S-trimer/rRBD proteins at 4°C for 1 hr. The mixtures were sedimented by centrifugation at
34,000 g for 45 min, and unbound protein in the supernatants was removed. After washing twice
with excess PBS to further remove the unbound protein and any other minor contaminants, the
phage pellets containing the displayed proteins were incubated at 4°C overnight and then
resuspended in PBS. For rabbit animal studies, fifty microliters of phage-trimer particles were
added to blood agar (TSA with sheep blood) to examine any contamination of a wide variety of
fastidious microorganisms. The resuspended pellets were analyzed using Novex 4-20% SDS–
SDS-PAGE mini gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to quantify the S trimer/rRBD copies.
After Coomassie Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad, CA) staining and destaining, the protein bands on SDSPAGE gels were scanned and quantified by ChemiDoc MP imaging system (BioRad) and image
J. The copy numbers of SpyCatcher and displayed S-trimer/rRBD molecules per capsid were
calculated using gp23 (major capsid protein; 930 copies) or gp18 (major tail sheath protein; 138
copies) as internal controls and S-trimer protein standard.

The E.coli expression, denaturation, refolding, and purification of SUMO-RBD-Spy (rRBD) were
performed using a similar procedure described previously53. Briefly, the BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIPL cells containing PET28b-SUMO-RBD-Spy expression plasmid were induced with 0.5 mM
isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h at 28°C. Cells were harvested and
resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM βmercaptoethanol, pH 7.9) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, USA, Indianapolis, IN)
and Benzonase. After the cells were lysed using a French press (Aminco, Urbana, IL) and
centrifuged, the pellet containing the inclusion body proteins was resuspended and washed with
buffer B (buffer A + 0.5% Triton X-100). Then, the inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer C
(Buffer A + 8 M urea) by incubating/stirring at 4 °C overnight, followed by centrifugation and
clarification. The supernatant containing the denaturing protein was loaded on HisTrap column
(AKTA-prime; GE Healthcare) followed by washing with buffer C. The rRBD was refolded on
HisTrap column using a linear gradient of 8 to 0 M urea containing buffer D (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500
mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM GSH, 0.1 mM GSSG, 20% glycerol, pH 7.9). Finally, the column
was washed with buffer E (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole, 20% glycerol, 5%
glucose, pH 7.9), and the refolded rRBD was eluted with buffer F (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl,
800 mM imidazole, 20% glycerol, 5% glucose, pH 7.9) and dialyzed to remove imidazole. The
proteins were then quantified, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C until use.

After treatment with multiple freeze-thaw cycles and Benzonase, phage particles were boiled in
SDS loading buffer for 10 min, separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane PVDF (Bio-Rad). The PVDF was then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)PBS (pH 7.4) buffer at RT for 1 hr with gentle shaking. Anti-NP or anti-RBD primary antibodies
were added to the blots and incubated overnight at 4°C in PBS-5% BSA, followed by five times
rinsing in PBST buffer [1×PBS (pH 7.4) and 0.05% Tween 20]. Goat-anti-mouse or goat-antirabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (Thermo Fisher) was applied at a 1:5000 dilution in 5% BSAPBST for 1 hr at RT with gentle shaking. After rinsing five times in PBST, binding was visualized
with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Bio-Rad) using the Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR+
System and Image Lab software according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad).

Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were randomly grouped
(5 mice per group) and allowed to acclimate for 14 days. The phage vaccine candidates were
administered by intramuscular (i.m.) injections into their hind legs. A total of 6 ×1011 phages
carrying approximately 20 µg of SARS-CoV-2 antigen(s) were injected on days 0 (prime), 21
(boost 1), and 42 (boost 2). Negative control mice received the same volume of PBS buffer (Naive)
or the same amount of T4 control phage. A group of mice immunized with purified S trimer (20
μg) adjuvanted with Alhydrogel was included as the positive control. Blood was drawn from each
animal on days 0 (pre-bleed), 14, 35, and 56, and the isolated sera were stored at −80°C.

Neutralizing antibody titers in mouse immune sera were quantified by Vero E6 cell-based microneutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2_US-WA-1/2020 strain as previously described46. Briefly,
serially 1:3 downward diluted mouse sera that were decomplemented at 56°C for 60 min in 60 µl
volume were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in duplicate wells of 96-well microtiter plates
that contained 120 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus in 60 µl in each well. After incubation under BSL3 conditions, 100 µl of the mixtures in individual wells were transferred to Vero E6 cell monolayer
grown in 96-well microtiter plates that containing 100 µl of MEM/2%FCS medium in each well and
were cultured for 72 h at 37°C before assessing the presence or absence of cytopathic effect
(CPE). Neutralizing antibody titers of the tested specimens were calculated as the reciprocal of
the highest dilution of sera that completely inhibited virus-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells
and expressed as 50% neutralizing titer (NT50).

Neutralizing antibody titers in rabbit immune sera were quantified using an automated, liquidhandler-assisted, high-throughput, microfocus neutralization/high-content imaging methods
developed at ViroVax. Briefly, rabbit sera (paired pre-immune and immune), were first
decomplemented at 56°C for 60 min, and were then serially diluted in 384 well plates, in duplicate,
using a BioTek Precision 2000 liquid handler, along with two reference sera. Twenty microliter
aliquots of SARS-CoV-2_USA-WA1/2020 were added to all test wells and positive control wells
to yield a final MOI of 10 under BSL-3 conditions. Vero (ATCC® CCL-81) cells were maintained
in a high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; HyClone Laboratories, South Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at
37°C with 5% CO2. After preincubating the plates for 1 hr, 20 μl of Vero cells (106/ml), containing
50 µg/mL of propidium iodide (PI), was added to all wells using the liquid handler. Plates were
then loaded in an IncuCyte S3 high-content imaging system (Essen Bioscience/Sartorius, Ann
Arbor, MI). Longitudinal image acquisition and processing for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE)
and cell death (PI uptake) were performed every six hrs, until cell death profiles had crested and
stabilized (3.5 days). Neutralizing antibody titers (expressed as IC50 or IC90) were obtained from
four-parameter logistic curve-fits of cell death profiles using OriginPro 9 (Origin Lab Corp.,
Northampton, MA).

Immunized mice were challenged with the mouse-adapted (MA) SARS-CoV-2/MA10 strain47, a
generous gift from Ralph Baric at UNC, by the intranasal route as previously described54. Briefly,
mice were inoculated with 60 µl of SARS-CoV2-MA10 at a dose of ~105 TCID50. The animals
were weighed every day over the indicated period of time for monitoring the onset of morbidity
(weight loss and other signs of illness) and mortality, as the endpoints for evaluating the vaccine
efficacy.
