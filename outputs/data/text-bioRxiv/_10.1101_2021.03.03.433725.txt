Abstract

27

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted from person-

28

to-person by close contact, small aerosol respiratory droplets and potentially via contact with

29

contaminated surfaces. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of commercial UVC-LED

30

disinfection boxes in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces of personal items. We

31

contaminated glass, metal and plastic samples representing the surfaces of personal items such

32

as smartphones, coins or credit cards with SARS-CoV-2 formulated in an organic matrix

33

mimicking human respiratory secretions. For disinfection, the samples were placed at different

34

distances from UVC emitting LEDs inside commercial UVC-LED disinfection boxes and irradiated

35

for different time periods (up to 10 minutes). High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 were effectively

36

inactivated on all surfaces after 3 minutes of irradiation. Even 10 seconds of UVC-exposure

37

strongly reduced viral loads. Thus, UVC-LED boxes proved to be an effective method for

38

disinfecting SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces that are typically found on personal items.

Background

41

Since the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus called the severe acute respiratory syndrome

42

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide, thereby causing a major public

43

health issue (1). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and

44

characterized by symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness to severe life-threatening

45

pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2). Reducing the transmission of

46

the virus by suitable preventive measures is highly important to control the pandemic. SARS-CoV-

47

2 is transmitted by direct contact with infected individuals, by virus-containing aerosols and

48

potentially via virus-contaminated surfaces (3). Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can

49

persist on smooth surfaces such as glass, metal and plastic for up to seven days at room

50

temperature, remaining a potential risk of infection (4).

51

UV-irradiation is an environmentally friendly method to disinfect surfaces from bacteria, fungi and

52

viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (5, 6). Under laboratory conditions, high viral loads of SARS-CoV-

53

2 in cell culture medium could be completely inactivated by UVC-irradiation after 9 minutes of

54

irradiation with a UVC dose of 1048 mJ/cm2 (7). For private use, commercial UVC-LED boxes are

55

available for the disinfection of personal items such as smartphones, keys, coins or credit cards.

56

However, the performance of such devices on the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces has

57

not yet been investigated. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the ability of two UVC-

58

LED boxes to disinfect surfaces typically found on personal items such as glass, metal and

59

plastics from contamination with high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

62

Cells and Viruses

63

Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, CRL-1586, Rockville, MD) were cultured

64

in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, Penicillin (100 IU/mL) and Streptomycin

65

(100 µg/mL). SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab of a patient hospitalized

66

due to COVID-19 at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the University Hospital Essen in

67

April 2020 (7). Viral titers were determined by endpoint dilution according to Spearman and Kärber

68

(8) and calculated as TCID50 (tissue culture infectious dose, 50%).

69
70

Measurement of the emitted light intensity

71

Two UVC-LED boxes were investigated for their capability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (UVC-LED

72

box 1, Horcol; UVC-LED box 2, expondo GmbH, Berlin, Germany). A radiometrically calibrated

73

spectrometer (STS-UV-L-50-400-SMA, Ocean Optics B.V., Ostfildern, Germany) with a sensitivity

74

range between 190 and 650 nm (1.5 nm resolution) equipped with a CC-3-UV-S corrector (Ocean

75

Optics B.V., Ostfildern, Germany) was used to determine the light intensity emitted by the LEDs

76

inside the UVC-LED boxes. The emitted light intensity was determined between a wavelength of

77

250 and 280 nm at specific distances from the light source (LED) of the UVC-LED boxes. The

78

corrector was placed at the same locations as the virus carriers (UVC-LED box 1: 1 cm and 5 cm

79

horizontal distance; UVC-LED box 2: 1 cm vertical distance). For UVC-LED box 2, emitted light

80

could only be measured at a distance of 1 cm. A measurement at 4 cm distance would have

81

required drilling a hole into the bottom of the box, which was not possible without damaging the

82

box. The data were recorded using OceanView 2.0 Software and visualized using GraphPad

83

Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

UVC-LED decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces

86

SARS-CoV-2 working stocks (5 × 106 TCID50/mL for UVC-LED box 1; 2 x 106 TCID50/mL for UVC-

87

LED box 2) were diluted in a defined organic matrix mimicking respiratory secretions (9). In brief,

88

900 µL of the respective virus stock was added to 100 µL organic matrix consisting of 2.5 mg/mL

89

mucin type I-S, 7.8 mg/mL BSA Fraction V and 11 mg/mL yeast extract (all Sigma-Aldrich,

90

Darmstadt, Germany). Before inoculating the respective virus suspension to glass, metal and

91

plastic carriers, the carriers were sterilized with a UV-lamp emitting 1940 µW/cm2 UVC at 254 nm

92

(UV-4 S/L, Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany) (7). After sterilizing, 50 µL of the respective virus

93

suspension were placed on the center of the carriers and allowed to dry for 1 h at room

94

temperature. The carriers were positioned at different distances from the UVC-LEDs inside the

95

UVC-LED boxes (UVC-LED box 1: 1 cm and 5 cm horizontal distance; UVC-LED box 2: 1 cm and

96

4 cm vertical distance). The carriers were irradiated for specific durations (0 s, 10 s, 30 s, 1 min,

97

3 min and 10 min). Subsequently, the infectious virus was recovered by vortexing the carriers

98

placed in plastic containers (SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany) filled with 2 mL DMEM for 1

99

minute. As control, the virus was recovered 10 minutes after drying without irradiation. The

100

experiments were conducted in triplicates and the viral loads were determined by endpoint dilution

101

according to Spearman and Kärber. The means, standard deviations of the viral titers and 90%

102

effective concentration (EC90) values were calculated with GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad

103

Software, San Diego, CA). The statistical significances were determined with the t-test.

104

Comparisons were considered significant at ∗P < 0.05; ∗∗P < 0.01; and ∗∗∗P < 0.001.

Results

107

SARS-CoV-2 can potentially be transmitted via virus-contaminated surfaces of personal items

108

such as smartphones, keys, coins or credit cards that have been contaminated with the virus. We

109

investigated the performance of two commercially available UVC-LED boxes for virus inactivation

110

on surfaces typically found on personal belongings such as glass, metal and plastic. We used two

111

different UVC-LED boxes for sterilizing, one with lateral UVC-LEDs (Fig. 1A) and one with UVC-

112

LEDs incorporated in the lid of the box (Fig. 1B). Additionally, a mirror was installed to the bottom

113

of the chamber. For UVC-LED box 1, the emitted light intensity was determined with 245 µW/cm2

114

at horizontal distance of 1 cm and 65 µW/cm2 in the center of the box at horizontal distance of 5

115

cm from the UVC-LEDs (Corresponding to 0.245 mJ/cm2 and 0.065 mJ/cm2 per second,

116

respectively; Fig. 2A). For both distances, the peak wavelength emission was measured at around

117

254 nm. For UVC-LED box 2, the emitted light intensity was measured with 117 µW/cm2 at 1 cm

118

vertical distance from the LEDs, which corresponds to 0.117 mJ/cm2 per second (Fig. 2B). The

119

peak wavelength emission was detected at 280 nm.

120

Next, metal, glass or plastic samples were overlaid with SARS-CoV-2 diluted in an organic matrix

121

mimicking respiratory secretions. The final calculated virus concentration on the samples was 4.5

122

× 106 TCID50/mL for UVC-LED box 1 and 1.8 x 106 TCID50/mL for UVC-LED box 2, respectively.

123

Compared to the viral load immediately after drying, there was no significant reduction of the viral

124

loads after 10 minutes without irradiation (Fig. 3).

125

UVC-LED irradiation conducted with UVC-LED boxes proved to be an appropriate method for the

126

disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 contaminated glass, metal or

127

plastic samples were effectively UVC-disinfected inside of both UVC-LED boxes (Fig. 3 and 4). A

128

significant reduction of viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 on glass, metal and plastic was achieved even

129

after 10 seconds of irradiation (UVC-LED box 1: 2.45 mJ/cm2; UVC-LED box 2: 1.17 mJ/cm2) at

130

a distance of 1 cm from the LEDs in both UVC-LED boxes (Fig. 3). When using UVC-LED box 1,

131

complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 could be achieved after 3 (glass and plastic) or 10 minutes

132

(metal) of irradiation at a distance of 1 cm (Fig. 3A and 4A). At a distance of 5 cm from the LEDs

133

(UVC-LED box 1), viral loads were strongly reduced after 3 and 10 minutes of irradiation (3

134

minutes: Glass: 88.27±1.49%, metal: 88.26±3.32%, plastic: 90±1.38%; 10 minutes: Glass:

135

91.92±1.85%, metal: 98.52±0.42%, plastic: 92.56±1.7%; Fig. 4A). When using UVC-LED box 2,

136

SARS-CoV-2 was almost completely inactivated after 3 and 10 minutes of irradiation at a distance

137

of 1 cm (3 minutes: Glass: 97.49±0.35%, metal: 99.21±0.1%, plastic: 98.74±0.16%; 10 minutes:

138

Glass: 97.85±0.27%, metal: 99.42±0.08%, plastic: 99.46%; Fig. 4B). At a distance of 4 cm, SARS-

139

CoV-2 was completely inactivated on glass and metal and almost completely on plastic

140

(99.89±0.2%) after 10 minutes of irradiation (Fig. 3B and 4B).

141

Taken together, our data demonstrate that UVC-LED sterilization boxes can effectively inactivate

142

SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces such as glass, plastic or metal.

143
144

Discussion

145

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals, by virus-containing

146

aerosols and potentially via contact with virus-contaminated surfaces (3). In the present study, we

147

investigated the performance of UVC-LED sterilization boxes on the inactivation of SARS-COV-

148

2 on surfaces such as glass, metal and plastics that are typically found on personal items like

149

smart phones, credit cards or keys. We demonstrated that UVC-LED boxes can effectively

150

inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on glass, metal and plastic. Independent of the used UVC-LED box and

151

the materials, SARS-CoV-2 could be almost completely inactivated after 3 minutes exposure

152

(UVC-LED box 1: 1 cm: 44.1 mJ/cm2, 5 cm: 11.7 mJ/cm2; UVC-LED box 2: 1cm: 21.06 mJ/cm2),

153

which represents the standard exposure time provided by the UVC-LED boxes. Even 10 seconds

154

of exposure strongly reduced viral loads on the contaminated surfaces. The findings are in line

155

with other studies that report susceptibility of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-

156

CoV-2 to UVC irradiation (7, 10). To almost completely inactivate high viral loads of SARS-CoV-

157

1, a UVC-dose of 1446 mJ/cm2 was necessary (10). High viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 could be

158

completely inactivated by a UVC dose of 1048 mJ/cm2 (7). The results of the present study show

159

that the distance of the inoculated materials from the LEDs and thus the emitted light intensity is

160

a decisive factor for achieving the complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, recently it

161

has been reported that distance and angle of UVC light source in closed box systems are

162

important factors for irradiance over respirator surfaces (11). UVC-LED box 1 and 2 showed a

163

similar reduction of viral load for the materials glass and plastic. At a distance of 5 cm from the

164

LED of UVC-LED box 1, although the viral load was reduced by 91.92±1.85% on glass,

165

98.52±0.42% on metal and 92.56±1.7% on plastic, the emitted light intensity (65 µW/cm2) was

166

not sufficient to completely inactivate the virus after 10 minutes exposure. The mirror at the bottom

167

of UVC-LED box 2 may have contributed to facilitate the inactivation of the virus. Van Doremalen

168

et al. (4) indicated that a SARS-CoV-2 stock with a viral concentration of 105 TCID50/mL

169

corresponds to cycle-threshold values between 20 and 22, which is similar to the thresholds of

170

samples from the upper and lower respiratory tracts of infected individuals. In this study, SARS-

171

CoV-2 stocks with even higher viral concentrations of about 106 TCID50/mL were used for the

172

inoculation of the materials. Overall, both UVC-LED boxes were highly effective in inactivating the

173

high titer viral stocks of SARS-CoV-2. These encouraging results make the UVC-LED boxes an

174

affordable option for the public to disinfect a variety of items, including phones, watches,

175

headphones, masks, makeup utensils, as long as the item size fits the device. As SARS-CoV-2

176

can also be detected on different surfaces in hospital environment (12, 13), UVC-LED boxes might

177

also be an effective tool for environmental decontamination in hospitals.
