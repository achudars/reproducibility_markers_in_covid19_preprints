Abstract

29

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by

30

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection,

31

poses a severe threat to humanity. Rapid and comprehensive analysis of both

32

pathogen and host sequencing data is critical to track infection and inform

33

therapies. In this study, we performed unbiased metatranscriptomic analysis of

34

clinical samples from COVID-19 patients using a newly-developed RNA-seq

35

library construction method (TRACE-seq), which utilizes tagmentation activity

36

of Tn5 on RNA/DNA hybrids. This approach avoids the laborious and time-

37

consuming steps in traditional RNA-seq procedure, and hence is fast, sensitive

38

and convenient. We demonstrated that TRACE-seq allowed integrated

39

characterization of full genome information of SARS-CoV-2, putative pathogens

40

causing coinfection, antibiotic resistance and host response from single throat

41

swabs. We believe that the integrated information will deepen our

42

understanding of pathogenesis and improve diagnostic accuracy for infectious

43

diseases.

Introduction

48

Longstanding, emerging, and re-emerging infectious diseases continuously

49

threaten human health across centuries(1). Precise and rapid identification of

50

pathogens from clinical samples is important for both guiding infection

51

treatment strategies and monitoring novel infectious disease outbreaks, e.g.

52

the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, in the community. While most nucleic acid

53

amplification-based and pathogen specific antibody detection-based molecular

54

techniques only detect a limited number of pathogens and need their prior

55

knowledge, metagenomic or meta-transcriptomic approaches allow for

56

comprehensive and unbiased identification and characterization of microbiome

57

directly from clinical specimens(2).

58
59

Compared to meta-genomic sequencing, meta-transcriptomic sequencing has

60

several distinct advantages: it permits detection of RNA viruses that would not

61

be interpreted in metagenomic data, reveals transcriptionally active organism(s)

62

which are more etiologically important, and indicates host immune response

63

which is essential to distinguish true pathogens from colonizers(3-5). However,

64

the laborious and time-consuming steps in traditional RNA-seq experiments

65

hinder the development of meta-transcriptomic based clinical diagnostics for

66

rapid pathogen identification.

67
68

Very recently, we and others have independently developed a rapid and cost-

69

effective RNA-seq method, based on Tn5 tagmentation activity towards

70

RNA/DNA hybrids(6, 7). Our method, termed “TRACE-seq”, enables rapid one-

71

tube library construction for RNA-seq experiments and shows excellent

72

performance in compsrison to traditional RNA-seq methods. We thus

73

envisioned that this convenient and sensitive method could be applied to

74

clinical specimens for unbiased meta-transcriptomic analysis. In this study, we

75

modified the TRACE-seq procedure, shorten the total time and optimized

76

analytical pipeline to meet the needs for clinical meta-transcriptomic diagnosis

77

and analysis. We then applyed TRACE-seq to meta-transcriptomic sequencing

78

of single throat swabs specimens from COVID-19 patients and healthy

79

individuals. We found library construction of specimens could be accomplished

80

in ~2h with high quality. Analysis of TRACE-seq meta-transcriptomic data of 13

81

SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and 2 negative samples demonstrated the

82

success of this method to sensitively detect SARS-CoV-2 with high coverage

83

even for samples with relatively high Ct values, or to assemble unknown

84

microbe genome de novo (using SARS-CoV-2 as an example). Moreover,

85

TRACE-seq sensitively detected the microbiome and simultaneously allowed

86

for interrogating antibiotic resistance and host responses. Taken together,

87

TRACE-seq enables unbiased pathogen detection and could have broad

88

applications in meta-transcriptomic study and clinical diagnosis.

Results

91

TRACE-seq enables metatranscriptomic analysis

92

To perform metatranscriptomic analysis on clinical samples, such as throat

93

swabs in this study, we made several modifications to TRACE-seq. First, to

94

achieve unbiased sequencing of microbiome, we used both random hexamer

95

and oligo d(T)23VN primers for reverse transcription, using approximately 1/10

96

total RNA extracted from a single throat swab as input. Secondly, we reduced

97

the total time of library construction to around 2 hours (Figure 1a), which

98

enables TRACE-seq to be more compatible for clinical use, especially when

99

substantial numbers of specimens require investigation. Third, we developed a

100

tailored analytical pipeline of TRACE-seq to simultaneously identify known and

101

unknown pathogens and at the meanwhile to characterize host transcriptional

102

response in a single metatranscriptomic profiling reaction (Figure 1b). This new

103

pipeline allowed us to obtain rich information from the metatranscriptomic data

104

generated by the modified TRACE-seq.

105
106

Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome

107

Since the samples were positive or suspected positive throat swabs from

108

COVID-19 patients, we asked whether the untargeted meta-transcriptomic

109

sequencing could yield a full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. After

110

removing low quality reads and human reads, the remaining reads were

111

mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession

112

number: NC_045512). Sequencing covered the reference genome from 171 bp

113

to 29,903 bp (0.57%-100%), with an average sequencing depth from 2.56× to

114

44,737× (Supplementary table 1). Four samples (B101, A193, B13, C1) with

115

low Ct values showed poor coverage and sequencing depth; the isolated RNA

116

samples from the throat swabs were repeatedly frozen and thawed, probably

117

compromising the integrity of RNA and hence were excluded. The other nine

118

samples were used for subsequent correlation analysis. Among the remaining

119

nine samples, the proportion of obtained reads of SARS-CoV-2, the coverage

120

to the reference genome, the average sequencing depth and the median

121

sequencing depth all showed a negative correlation with the Ct value of the

122

samples (Spearman test, p < 0.05) (Figure 2a). In addition, the whole genome

123

sequence could be acquired from mapping-based approach when the Ct value

124

is as high as 32 (n=4, 44.44% of samples), with the average sequencing depth

125

of 131×. Even in samples with Ct values up to 35 (n=7, 77.78% of samples),

126

more than 94% of genome can be covered by TRACE-seq (Figure 2b,

127

Supplementary table 1, Supplementary figure 1).

128
129

Reconstruction of full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2

130

Of the 452,865 contigs (average 34,836, from 18,160 to 53,415) assembled de-

131

novo from non-human reads, 3,500 contigs (average 269, from 0 to 2,976) were

132

determined to be SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments. There were no SARS-CoV-

133

2 contigs in sample C31, B101 and B13. Most of contigs (n=3,461, 98.89%)

134

were less than 1,000 bp (Figure 2c). To determine the accuracy of this method

135

in acquisition of pathogen genome, all SARS-CoV-2 contigs were searched

136

against genomes of each sample. In contigs with matched length over 1,000

137

bp, most contigs (22/39, 56.41%) were completely consistent with their

138

corresponding genome (Figure 2d), while the other contigs had error bases

139

from 1 to 7. In samples C14 and C13 with excellent coverage and depth, almost

140

full-length genome (29,793 bp and 29,825 bp) were obtained just from de-novo

141

assembly. Thus, TRACE-seq could enable the de-novo assembly of the

142

complete genome of unknown pathogens and be readily utilized to identify

143

emerging pathogens in patients with unknown etiology of infection and

144

efficiently complement routine diagnostics.

147

It is widely reported that coinfection (multi-species infection) contributes to

148

enhanced morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly and immunosuppressed

149

influenza patients(8, 9). Thus, we were curious to see if our metatranscriptomic

150

sequencing approach could capture other pathogens in addition to SARS-CoV-

151

2. Indeed, alignment of TRACE-seq data to microbe reference databases

152

identified many bacteria, fungi and viruses in both patient and healthy samples

153

(Figure 3a). To assess whether COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals have

154

different microbe community in their throat, principal coordinates analysis

155

(PCoA) was conducted using relative abundance of the microbiome. We

156

observed that COVID-19 patients harbored a throat microbiome that is quite

157

different from healthy individuals (Figure 3b). In addition, sample C31 differed

158

significantly from other SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Further investigation of

159

the relative abundance of probable respiratory pathogens revealed that patient

160

C31 contained the most abundant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Human

161

gammaherpesvirus 4, compared to other samples (Figure 3c), which might be

162

a cause of the separation between sample C31 and the rest of the SARS-CoV-

2 positive samples.

172

aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis and Legionella pneumophila cause disease

173

infrequently in normal hosts but can be a major cause of infection in patients

174

with underlying or immunocompromising conditions(14-18). Mycoplasma

175

pneumoniae is a type of “atypical” bacteria that commonly causes mild

176

infections of the respiratory system(19). As for identified fungi, Candida

177

dubliniensis and Candida albicans are both opportunistic yeast and can be

178

detected in the gastrointestinal tract in healthy adults; they were also known to

179

cause respiratory diseases (20-22). Human respirovirus 1, also known as

180

Human parainfluenza virus 1, is the most common cause of croup and also

181

associated with pneumonia. Human gammaherpesvirus 4 is one of the most

182

common viruses in human; it is best known as the cause of infectious

183

mononucleosis (23, 24), and is also constantly detected in lungs of patients with

184

idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (25). In our results, a relatively high abundance of

185

Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter

186

baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis were

187

identified in several SARS-CoV-2 positive samples compared with negative

188

samples, which indicated potential coinfection. Nevertheless, these data by

189

itself could not prove that COVID-19 patients were coinfected by these

190

identified microorganism; these data have to be carefully interpreted in the

191

clinical context.

192
193

Profiles of antibiotic resistance genes

194

Antimicrobial resistance has become a global issue. Pathogens with antibiotic

195

resistance are increasing and many pathogens are becoming multidrug-

196

resistant (26, 27). To characterize antibiotic resistance gene expression profiles,

197

we aligned metatranscriptomic reads against the Comprehensive Antibiotic

198

Resistance Database (CARD) (28). On average, around 84 antibiotic

199

resistance genes were identified in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, while only

200

around 23 genes were identified in negative samples. According to the CARD,

201

the identified antibiotic resistance genes confer resistance to 23 classes of

202

antibiotics. Almost all resistance gene classes were more abundant in COVID-

203

19 patients compared to healthy individuals. Genes conferring resistance to

204

beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, phenicol, rifamycin, fluoroquinolone

205

and macrolide were the most abundant (Figure 3d). Overall, the distinct

206

microbiome, emergence of potential coinfection, and the elevated abundance

207

of antibiotic resistance genes provide new data for establishing clinical

208

therapeutic scheme during the treatment for COVID-19 patients.

209
210

Characterization of host response to SARS-CoV-2

211

Distinguishing infection from colonization remains challenging. Because host

212

transcriptional profiling has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool for

213

infectious diseases (29, 30), we next tested whether the host response to

214

SARS-CoV-2 could be simultaneously characterized by TRACE-seq mediated

215

metatranscriptomic analysis from throat swabs. As shown in Figure 3a, a

216

substantial percentage of the reads are derived from human, and an average

217

of 14,766 human genes with FPKM > 1 were detected per sample (Figure 4a,

218

Figure S2a and b). Based on the gene expression profiles, the relationships

219

between samples were inspected using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot

220

(Figure 4b). As expected, SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were clearly

221

separated from negative samples. In addition, sample C31 differed significantly

222

in host gene expression from other SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, which might

223

be caused by the relatively high abundance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and

224

Human gammaherpesvirus 4 identified in sample C31. To characterize the

225

common host response to SARS-CoV-2, we excluded sample C31 when

226

performing differential gene expression analysis between SARS-CoV-2 positive

227

and negative samples. We identified 153 differentially expressed genes, 149 of

228

which were up-regulated (Figure 4c, Figure S2c). Gene Ontology enrichment

229

analysis identified the top up-regulated biological processes to be immune

230

response, defense response, viral process and response to cytokine (Figure

231

4d). Further investigation revealed that a subset of up-regulated genes involve

232

in IL1B-associated inflammatory response (IL1B, IL8, IL36A, CXCR2, FOS,

233

ANXA1, CASP4, KRT16, S100A8, S100A9). Moreover, another subset of up-

234

regulated genes (ISG15, EGR1, IFI27, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3,

235

HLA-B, HLA-C) were enriched in type I interferon signaling pathway (Figure 4e).

236

These results were highly consistent with previously reported host response to

237

SARS-CoV-2 (31-33). Overall, metatranscriptomic data via TRACE-seq of

238

throat swab samples demonstrates reliable performance in characterization of

239

host transcriptional response to the infection of SARS-CoV-2.

240
241

Discussion

242

Although next generation sequencing holds a great potential to directly detect

243

known and unknown pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites

244

in a single application, the laborious and time-consuming steps in traditional

245

RNA library construction procedure hinders its clinical application. As a rapid

246

and convenient one-tube RNA-seq library construction method, TRACE-seq

247

significantly lower the barrier for extensive application of unbiased RNA-seq in

248

clinical diagnosis. In addition, multiplexing libraries by utilizing Tn5 transposase

249

containing barcoded adaptors could enable sample investigation in a high-

250

throughput manner, particularly when comprehensive surveillance for emerging

251

pathogens is needed during a sudden disease outbreak.

252
253

It is very challenging to discriminate pathogens from background commensal

254

microbiota, since substantive bacteria or fungi can colonize multiple body sites

255

of healthy individuals. The microbe present at a relatively higher abundance in

256

patients compared to healthy individuals are often considered as a pathogen,

257

yet the abundance thresholds indicating infection is difficult to define based

258

solely on microbiome information. On the other hand, host transcriptional

259

profiling has been reported to distinguish infectious and noninfectious diseases

260

(30) and to further discriminate between virial and bacterial infections (29). A

261

previous study integrates host response and unbiased microbe detection for

262

lower respiratory tract infection diagnosis in critically ill adults, using both RNA-

263

seq and DNA-seq but yet lacking antibiotic resistance analysis (3). Another

264

study characterized microbial gene expression profiles (including antibiotic

265

resistance genes) using nasal and throat swab samples, and host response

266

using blood samples during influenza infection (34). To our knowledge, this is

267

the first study integrating unbiased pathogens detection, antibiotic resistance

268

and host response in a single approach with throat swabs from COVID-19

269

patients. In our results, SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples differed

270

significantly in both microbiome composition and host response. Among SARS-

271

CoV-2 positive samples, sample C31 harbored a throat microbiome and host

272

response notably distinct from others, indicating sufficiently different pathogens

273

present in patient C31 compared to other samples. Moreover, TRACE-seq hold

274

the potential to construct a network of microbiome composition, antibiotic

275

resistance and host response for characterizing the complex host-microbiome

276

interactions. Ideally, TRACE-seq data can be utilized to develop a model

277

combining pathogens metric, antibiotic resistance and host transcriptional

278

classifier for infectious diseases diagnosis. We believe that the integrated

279

information acquired from a TRACE-seq library will deepen our understanding

280

of pathogenesis, improve diagnostic accuracy and more precisely inform

281

optimal antimicrobial treatment for infectious diseases caused by not only

282

SARS-CoV-2 but also other pathogens and eventually facilitate the utility of

283

metatranscriptomic profiling as a routine diagnostic method.

301

TRACE-seq libraries were constructed using TruePrep® RNA Library Prep Kit

302

for Illumina (Vazyme, TR502-01) according to the manufacturer’s instructions

303

with several modifications. 1/10 volume of total nucleic acids extracted from

304

each swab was used for each library. After 18 PCR cycles, the library was

305

purified using 0.8X Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted

306

in 20 μl nuclease-free water. The concentration of resulting libraries was

307

determined by Qubit 3.0 fluorometer with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit

308

(Invitrogen) and the size distribution of libraries was assessed by Agilent 2100

309

Bioanalyzer. Finally, libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq X10

310

platform which generated 2 x 150 bp of paired-end raw reads.

311
312

Data preprocessing

313

Raw reads from sequencing were firstly subjected to Trim Galore (v0.6.4_dev)

314

(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)

315

control and adaptor trimming. The minimal threshold of quality was 20, and the

316

minimal length of reads to remain was set as 20 nt.

318

Host transcriptional profiling analysis

319

Filtered reads were mapped to human genome (hg19) and transcriptome using

320

STAR (v2.7.1a) (35). The FPKM value for annotated genes was calculated by

321

cuffnorm (v2.2.1) (36), and genes with FPKM > 1 were considered to be

expressed. Multidimensional scaling and differential gene expression analysis

323

were conducted using EdgeR (v3.28.1) (37) with gene count data generated by

324

HTSeq (v0.11.2) (38). Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis for biological

325

processes was performed by DAVID (v6.8) (39) with all significantly up-

326

regulated genes as input. Due to the redundancy of enriched GO terms, GO

327

terms and their p values were further summarized using REViGO (40). The top

328

10 enriched representative GO terms were plotted.

329
330

Discrimination and de-novo assembly of SARS-CoV-2

331

After removal of human reads, the remaining data were aligned to the reference

332

genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number: NC_045512) using

333

Bowtie2 (v2.2.9) (41) for SARS-CoV-2 identification. The coverage and

334

sequencing depth of SARS-CoV-2 genome were calculated by Samtools (v1.9)

335

(42). On the other hand, to verify the method could screen for aetiologic agents

336

and obtain pathogen genome, all non-human reads were processed for de-

337

novo assembly using MEGAHIT (v1.2.9) with default parameters (43), and then

338

all contigs were searched against NCBI nt database using blastn for

339

classification(44). As for accuracy of assembly sequences, contigs determined

340

to come from SARS-CoV-2 were performed blastn (with the parameter “-outfmt

341

3”) to display the differences with corresponding genome.

342
343

Microbiome analysis

344

After removing human reads, the remaining reads were subjected to microbial

345

taxonomic classification using Kraken2 (v2.0.8-beta) (45) with a custom

346

database. To build the custom database, standard RefSeq complete bacterial

347

genomes were downloaded through “kraken2-build --download-library bacteria”

348

and complete genomes of human viruses and genome assemblies of fungi

349

were downloaded from NCBI’s RefSeq and added to the custom database’s

350

genomic library using the “--add-to-library” switch. Principal coordinate analysis

351

(PCoA) of relative abundances of microbial taxa at the genus level was done

352

using cmdscale command in R. Distances between samples were calculated

353

using Morisita-horn dissimilarity index by vegdist command from vegan

354

package version 2.5-6 (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegan). The

355

antibiotic resistance genes were annotated by aligning the filtered

356

metatranscriptomic reads to the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance

357

Database (CARD). Antibiotic resistance genes with more than 10 completely

358

matching reads were considered. The relative expression of antibiotic

359

resistance genes were determined as RPM (reads per million non-host reads).

360

All corresponding graphs were plotted using R scripts by RStudio (v1.2.5033)

361

(https://rstudio.com/).
