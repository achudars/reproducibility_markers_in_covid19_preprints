ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis caused by the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and there is a critical need to produce large
quantities of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein for use in both clinical and basic science
settings. To address this need, we have evaluated the expression and purification of two previously
reported S protein constructs in Expi293FTM and ExpiCHO-STM cells, two different cell lines
selected for increased expression of secreted glycoproteins. We show that ExpiCHO-STM cells
produce enhanced yields of both SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Biochemical, biophysical, and
structural (cryo-EM) characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins produced in both cell lines
demonstrate that the reported purification strategy yields high quality S protein (non-aggregated,
uniform material with appropriate biochemical and biophysical properties). Importantly, we show
that multiple preparations of these two recombinant S proteins from either cell line exhibit identical
behavior in two different serology assays. We also evaluate the specificity of S protein-mediated
host cell binding by examining interactions with proposed binding partners in the human
secretome. In addition, the antigenicity of these proteins is demonstrated by standard ELISAs, and
in a flexible protein microarray format. Collectively, we establish an array of metrics for ensuring
the production of high-quality S protein to support clinical, biological, biochemical, structural and
mechanistic studies to combat the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Most human coronavirus infections are associated with mild symptoms, but in the last two
decades, three beta coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, have emerged that are
able to infect humans and cause severe disease [1, 2]. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease
19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
[3], an enveloped virus from the Coronaviridae family with a single positively stranded RNA
genome [3]. This RNA virus, which likely originated in bats, has several structural components,
including Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2].
The S protein is a class I viral fusion protein, which consists of two subunits (S1 and S2) and
forms a trimer on the viral membrane [4]. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain
(RBD) which is responsible for host cell receptor binding, while the S2 subunit facilitates
membrane fusion between the viral and host cell membranes [4-7]. Host cell proteases are essential
for activating the S protein for Coronaviridae cellular entry [8]. The S protein in many
Coronaviridae, including SARS-CoV-2, is cleaved between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2
cleavage site) and at an additional site present in S2 (S2’ cleavage site) [8-10]. Similar to SARSCoV, the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S glycoprotein mediates viral entry into the cell by utilizing
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a human cell surface entry receptor [8]. Processing
of both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein is dependent on the endosomal cysteine
proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L, and the serine protease TMPRSS2[8]. In many
coronaviruses, these events lead to conformational rearrangements in S2, which ultimately result
in fusion of the host and viral cell membranes, and delivery of the viral genome into the newly
infected cell [11].
Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain protein has
become an important target for clinical, biological and structural investigations, and future studies

will require the efficient and streamlined production of this protein. Clinically, the production of
large amounts of S ectodomain protein enables testing of individuals for SARS-CoV-2
seropositivity. Serological testing is important for determining individuals who have been exposed
to the virus, and the resulting antibody titer can facilitate identification of potential donors of
convalescent plasma[12]. Additionally, the S protein ectodomain could be used to identify
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) through single B cell cloning from convalescent
patients. Furthermore, the development of small molecules and protein therapeutics designed to
inhibit viral infection by targeting the S protein need to be tested and biochemically characterized.
Biologically, the complete mechanisms of viral host cell fusion and replication remain to be
completely understood. Structural studies will continue to support these ongoing clinical,
therapeutic and biological investigations.
To provide support for these investigations, we examined the expression and purification of two
recently reported recombinant versions of the S protein (here termed OptSpike1 and OptSpike2,
see Fig. 1A). OptSpike1 was initially reported by McLellan and coworkers [7], and used to
determine the cryo-EM structure of the Spike protein in the prefusion conformation and has been
utilized as an antigen for clinical ELISAs at Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY) [Bortz et
al., manuscript in preparation]. OptSpike2 was described by Krammer and coworkers, and has
been successfully used to conduct serum ELISAs to test patients for the presence of anti-S
antibodies at Mount Sinai Hospital (New York, NY) [13]. The successful use of both of these
recombinant forms of the S protein in clinical (OptSpike1 and OptSpike2) and structural
(OptSpike1) applications have made them attractive targets for future COVID-19 studies. Both
constructs are cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS, and include either the
majority of the ectodomain (OptSpike1: AAs 1-1208) or the full-length ectodomain (OptSpike2:
1-1213) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence) [14]. Both constructs

include the K986P and K987P stabilizing mutations and use a T4 Foldon motif (T4) to enhance
trimerization [15, 16]. Both constructs lack the furin cleavage site: OptSpike1 contains the
mutation RRAR:GSAS, while OptSpike2 contains the mutation RRAR:A [17]. OptSpike1
contains the T4-HRV3C protease cleavage sequence-8x HisTag and a TwinStrepTag at the Cterminus, while OptSpike2 contains a Thrombin cleavage sequence-T4-6x HisTag at the Cterminus.
Here, we examine the expression of OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 in Expi293FTM and ExpiCHOSTM expression systems [18], and provide detailed protein production protocols (including an SOP
in Appendix 1). We then evaluate the biochemical and biophysical properties of these proteins to
define standards of protein quality and evaluate the recognition specificity of the S protein within
the human secretome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional reproducibility of recombinant
S protein in serum ELISAs and develop a multi antigen COVID-19 protein microarray that can
simultaneously test for antibodies against multiple antigens, including the full-length S protein,
the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, and the full-length N protein. Finally, we
determine the 3.22 Å cryo-EM structure of OptSpike1 produced in ExpiCHO-STM cells, and the
3.44 Å cryo-EM structure of OptSpike1 produced in Expi293FTM cells, which are nearly
indistinguishable and in agreement with previously described structures [7, 19].
This work provides a comprehensive strategy, with a wide range of guiding standards and
metrics, for production of large quantities of high-quality recombinant S protein for use in future
clinical, diagnostic, biological, biochemical, structural and mechanistic studies that will be needed
to combat the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant spike protein transfection
An SOP for the production of high-quality recombinant S antigen is provided in Appendix 1.
Both variants of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein (OptSpike1 and OptSpike2) were
expressed in Expi293FTM and ExpiCHO-STM cells according to manufacturer's instructions
(ThermoFisher Scientific). For Expi293FTM (ThermoFisher Cat# A14527) purifications, cells were
grown in sterile TC flasks, vented, with a baffled bottom (example: FisherScientific Cat # BBV125) in a Climo Shaker ISF4-X at 110 RPM (orbital diameter of 50 mm) at 37° C and 8% CO2.
When cells reached a density between 3.5 and 5x106 cells / mL, they were counted, and
appropriately diluted into a shaker flask. For example, for a transfection volume of 30 mL, 7.5 x
107 cells were brought to a total volume of 25.5 mL in a 125 mL shaker flask. Cells were then
transfected by diluting 30 μg of plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM™ I Reduced Serum Medium (Cat #
31985-062) to a total volume of 1.5 mL in a 15 mL conical tube, and then mixing briefly by
inverting the tube. 80 μL of ExpiFectamine™ 293 Reagent was then diluted in Opti-MEM™ I
medium to a total volume of 1.5 mL, in a separate 15 mL conical tube. Both reactions were
incubated for 5 minutes. The transfection reagent mixture was then carefully pipetted into the DNA
mixture, and mixed by inverting the 15 mL conical tube 3 times. The combined DNA and
transfection reagent mixture was incubated at room temperature for 25 minutes, after which the
complexes were added to the cell culture in a drop wise fashion, while swirling the cell culture
flask to ensure uniform distribution of the DNA complexes. 16 hours post-transfection, 150 μL of
ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection Enhancer 1 and 1.5 mL of ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection
Enhancer 2 were added to the transfected cells, bringing the total volume of the transfection to 30
mL. Expi293FTM transfections were harvested on day 6 post transfection unless otherwise

specified. This protocol can be scaled linearly for larger Expi293FTM cultures, according to the
manufacturer's protocol, for both OptSpike1 and OptSpike2.
For ExpiCHO-STM transfections, we obtained the ExpiCHO-S™ (ThermoFisher Cat # A29127)
cells and ExpiCHO Expression System kit (Cat # A29133) from ThermoFisher Scientific.
ExpiCHO-S™ cells were grown in sterile, Erlenmeyer-shaped flasks with plain bottom with
vented screw caps (appropriate flasks for cell culture volume should be used see for example:
Fisherbrand PBV125) in a Climo Shaker ISF4-X at 110 RPM (orbital diameter of 50 mm) at 37°
C and 8% CO2. ExpiCHO-S™ cells were passaged and split every 2-3 days when cell densities
reached 0.3x106-6x106 viable cells per mL. ExpiCHO-S™ cells are allowed to reach a density of
7-10x106 cells per mL on the day of transfection, with a viability of at least 95%. ExpiCHO-S cells
are diluted to a final density of 6x106 cells per mL in a plain bottom Erlenmeyer flask. For spike
protein transfections, the manufacturers ExpiCHO expression system manual was followed
closely. For example, for a 25mL transfection, 25 μg of filtered DNA was diluted into 1mL of
OptiPROTM SFM (Cat # 12309019) and 80 μL of ExpiFectamineTM CHO reagent was added to 920
μL of OptiPROTM SFM. Dilutions were mixed by inversion and then diluted DNA was mixed with
diluted ExpiFectamineTM CHO reagent and mixed by inversion. ExpiFectamineTM CHO and DNA
complexes were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes and slowly transferred to a 125mL
plain bottom flask containing 25mL of ExpiCHO-S cells at a cell density of 6x106 cells per mL.
For all spike transfections, we followed the max titer protocol (unless otherwise stated), thus on
day 1 post transfection we added 150 μL of ExpiCHO-STM Enhancer and 4mL of ExpiCHO-STM
Feed. On day 1 post transfection, the cells were shifted to another Climo Shaker ISF4-X at 110
RPM (orbital diameter of 50 mm) with temperature set at 32° C and 5% CO2. On day 5 post
transfection, another 4mL of ExpiCHO-STM Feed is added and the cells are set back at 32° C.
ExpiCHO-STM transfections were harvested on day 12 post transfection unless otherwise specified.

S Protein Purification
For purifications of the SARS-CoV-2 S Protein (OptSpike1 and OptSpike2), on the indicated
day post transfection (optimally day 6 for Expi293F™ and day 12 for ExpiCHO-S™) , the media
was harvested by centrifuging cells at 500g for 10 minutes, removing the supernatant, and
centrifuging the supernatant at 2000g for 10 minutes. For ExpiCHO-S™, the supernatant was
clarified by filtering through a rapid flow filter from ThermoFisher (example: 524-0020). The
supernatant was then adjusted to 50 mM ArgCl using a 2 M stock solution of ArgCl at pH 6.5, to
increase stability of the protein during purification. OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 were subsequently
purified by His60 Ni2+ superflow resin (Takara Cat: 635664) using a batch binding method: .6 mL
of resin were added for every 10 mL of supernatant, and supernatants were incubated with resin
for 2 hours at 4° C with shaking or rotating. Batch adsorption was followed by gravity flow over
a column. The Ni2+His60 resin was washed with 3 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM TRIS
pH 8.0, 100 mM ArgCl, 5 mM imidazole, 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol) and the bound protein
eluted with 5 mL of the same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Nickel eluates were
concentrated by centrifugation in 100K concentrator (ThermoFisher Cat # 88533) by spinning at
1100 g for intervals of 8 minutes (if necessary) and further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoadTM
16/600 SuperdexTM 200 column (GE) equilibrated with 50 mM TRIS, 100 mM ArgCl, 150 mM
NaCl, 10% Glycerol, pH 8.0. For use in cryo-EM experiments, nickel eluates were further purified
by gel filtration on a HiLoadTM 16/600 SuperdexTM 200 (GE) equilibrated with 50 TRIS, 150 mM
NaCl, pH 8.0. For protein used in serum ELISA or protein microarray experiments, 30 ml of Nickel
eluates were dialyzed against 5 L of 50 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 at 4 ˚C for 16 hours.
Generally, the SEC step did not affect the serum ELISA experiments, but was important for all
other experiments. Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient (1468500
M-1cm-1) estimated from amino acid sequence by Expasy online ProtParam tool[20].

SARS-CoV2 RBD Expression and Purification
The pCAGGs SARS-CoV2 RBD plasmid (provided by Florian Krammer) was used for
recombinant RBD expression as previously described. FreeStyle 293F cells (ThermoFisher,
R79007) were transiently transfected with a mixture of plasmid DNA diluted in PBS (0.67 μg total
plasmid DNA per ml of culture) and Polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences, Inc., 23966) at a DNAto-PEI ratio of 1:3. At six days post-transfection, cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000
x g for 20 min, and supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Goldbio) for 2 hours at 4° C
with gentle stirring. Resin was collected in columns by gravity flow, washed with 16 column
volumes of wash buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole) and eluted
in 12mL elution buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole). Eluates
were concentrated and exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl)
using an Amicon centrifugal units (EMD Millipore). Protein concentration was determined using
an extinction coefficient (33350 M-1cm-1), estimated from amino acid sequence by Expasy online
ProtParam, and was further analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Recombinant expression and purification of SARS-COV-2 N-Protein
The nucleocapsid sequence was PCR amplified from a diagnostic test positive control plasmid
obtained from IDTDNA, and InFusion cloned into a derivative of the NYSGRC pSGC-HIS vector.
50 ng of plasmid was used to transform 20 μl of the BL21 DE3 strain of E. coli. Cultures were
then grown overnight (16 hours) in LB at 37˚C and used to inoculate either LB media the next day
(1:100x dilution of overnight culture). Inoculated cultures were grown at 37˚C until they reached
OD600 0.7, at which point they were induced using 500 μM IPTG. Upon induction of LB media,
temperature of the cultures was immediately lowered to 25˚C for 16 hours.
To harvest protein, cells were lysed by sonic disruption using a 550 sonic dismembrator from
Fisher Scientific. Every 5 g of were resuspended in 30 mL of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM

HEPES, 250 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM BME, 0.1% Igepal® CA-630 (Sigma Aldrich), pH
7.5 and ½ protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). After lysis, samples were cleared by centrifugation
at 20,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was purified on an AKTA FPLC (GE Biosciences).
Supernatants were loaded onto fast flow HisTrap columns and washed with 20 column volumes
of lysis buffer and eluted with 2 column volumes of Buffer B (Buffer A + 500 mM imidazole, pH
7.5). The resulting eluent with high OD280 absorbance was collected and loaded onto a HiPrep
16/60 S-200 size exclusion column equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, 250 mM KCl, 10% glycerol,
5 mM DTT, pH 7.5. Protein concentration of fractions were approximated using an extinction
coefficient of 43890 M-1cm-1, and molecular mass of 45.62570 kDa estimated from amino acid
sequence by Expasy online ProtParam tool[20].
Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography
After nickel elutes were concentrated and purified by gel filtration on a HiLoadTM 16/600
SuperdexTM 200 column and concentrated, protein aggregation state was assessed by analytical gel
filtration on a SuperoseTM 6 Increase 10/300 GL column. The void for this column runs at 8.5mL.
Aggregation state was monitored over time, and after freeze thaw cycles on this column.
Molecular Mass Determination using Multi Angle Light Scattering (MALS)
30 μL of either OptSpike1, Optspike2, or Nucleocapsid was run over a Yarra™ 3 µm SEC-4000
LC Column using an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity instrument, equipped with auto injector.
10 µl samples were injected onto the column in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM ArgCl, 10%
glycerol, pH 8.0 at a flow rate of 0.25ml/min. MALS analysis was performed using miniDAWN
Treos MALS detector (Wyatt) and Optilab T-rEX and analyzed using the associated Astra
software. Baselines were determined automatically; peaks were manually delineated.

5000x stock of SYPROTM dye was diluted to 200x in Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl buffer,
the same buffer as OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 were diluted in for the assay. Stock protein was
serially diluted to 1.75 μM; 45 μl of 1.75 μM protein was aliquoted into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes,
and 5 μl of 200x dye was added to each tube. The final concentration of protein was 1.58 μM and
20x SYPROTM Orange dye. The samples were split into three technical triplicates (one in each well
of a 384 well plate), and the reactions were placed into 7900 HT Fast Real Time PCR System. The
PCR machine was programmed to monitor the fluorescence of the dye over a temperature gradient
spanning 25˚C to 99˚C. The protocol was designed to hold the samples at 25˚C for two minutes,
and then ramp the temperature Background fluorescence was measured using 20x dye and all
measurements were taken in technical triplicate.
Data was exported in Excel, and then analyzed and graphed by GraphPad Prism. To discern the
melting temperature (Tm) of the protein, two methods were used as outlined in: 1) fitting the
Boltzmann equation to the non-linear raw data and 2) detection of local maximum values in the 1st
derivative of melting curve. The curve had two apparent melting transitions, one between 42-55˚C
and 55-70˚C. The curves in these two temperature ranges were fitted with Boltzmann equations
(listed below). The function fit to data in each of the temperature ranges contained an approximate
value for each Tm. In order to determine the local maxima values the 1st and 2nd derivatives were
graphed (the 2nd derivative should equal 0 at the local maxima of the 1st derivative, which can be
visually verified by the graph of the 1st derivative). Both methods produced comparable melting
temperature values. OptSpike1 Tm1 = 49.04±0.1699˚C and OptSpike2 Tm1 = 49.36±0.1652˚C;
OptSpike1 Tm2 = 63.04 ± 0.1659˚C and OptSpike2 Tm2 = 63.31 ± 0.09236˚C. The melting
temperature can also be approximated by determining local maxima of the 1st derivative of
Fluorescence vs temperature curve. There wasn’t a significant difference in either Tm1 and Tm2

Analytical Ultracentrifugation of OptSpike1

9680 − 7032

12747 − 9485

Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) studies were conducted with OptSpike1 in 250mM NaCl
50mM Tris pH 8.0 in a Beckman XL-AUC using the absorption optics to scan cells assembled
with a double sector charcoal EPON centerpiece and sapphire glass windows inserted into a AN60 Ti rotor. Centrifuge runs were conducted at 20 °C and 30,000 rpm. The first run was scanned
at 230 nm. A second run was scanned at 280 nm. This protocol allowed protein concentrations
ranging from 136 nM to 4.8 µM to be analyzed. A minimum of 50 scans were acquired for each
sample. An overview of the sedimentation behavior of each sample was obtained by timederivative g(s*) analysis conducted using either the program SedAnal [21, 22] or the program
DCDT+ by John Philo v2.5.1[23, 24]. Component analysis was conducted using the program
Sedfit [25, 26] to deconvolute the species present in a solution. The program Prism v8 was used to
generate the AUC figures shown in the text and supplement.
Convalescent Serum and Plasma Samples
Serum and plasma samples were collected from healthy adult volunteers residing in Westchester
County, NY who had recovered from COVID-19 in April 2020. Patients had reported a positive
nasopharyngeal swab by PCR for SARS-CoV-2 during illness and had been asymptomatic for at
least 14 days prior to sample collection. After obtaining informed consent, serum was obtained by
venipuncture (BD Vacutainer, serum), centrifuged, aliquoted and stored at -80°C prior to use. The

sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and stored at 4°C prior to analysis. Protocol
approval was obtained by the Institutional Review Board (protocol IRB# 2016-6137) of the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine.
Protein Microarray Production and Processing
The COVID-19 protein array included OptSpike1, OptSpike2, receptor binding domain (RBD)
of Spike protein and nucleocapsid proteins, along with positive (human IgG) and negative (human
acetylcholinesterase, PBS or printing buffer) controls. Arrays were generated by printing purified
proteins onto aminosilane coated slides with printing buffer containing an amine-to-amine
homobifunctional crosslinker (bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate, BS3, Thermo Scientific Pierce™
Cat # A39266) and glycerol. BS3 was used for covalent immobilization of the proteins to the slide,
and glycerol to keep them hydrated at all times. Protein concentrations were adjusted to 25, 50,
100 and 200pg per spot (two-fold dilutions between 25 and 200pg per spot). The array layout was
designed with sixteen identical subarrays. Each sample was spotted in duplicate with a total drop
deposition volume of 800pL (8 drops of 100 pL) per spot using Marathon Argus piezoelectric
printer (Arrayjet, Edinburgh, UK) at 50-55% humidity. The slides were incubated in a humidity
controlled (50%) enclosure for 45 minutes and blocked by incubation with Superblock™ blocking
buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 45 minutes at room temperature with shaking
at 60rpm.
After blocking, a multi-well chamber (ProPlate® Multi-Well Chambers, Grace Bio-labs, Bend,
OR) was used to screen multiple serum samples with subarrays on the same slide. As negative
control for screening, we used three serum samples (1, 4 and 8) which were received from the New
York Blood Center which were collected before the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and stored as
aliquots at -80 °C. COVID-19 convalescence sera samples (2, 3, 5, 6, 7) were previously validated

to be negative with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and positive ELISA for antibodies against SARSCoV-2.
Each subarray was challenged with 250 µl of 1:100 patient sera diluted in 5% (w/v) milk, PBS,
0.2% (v/v) Tween-20 (5% milk-PBST) overnight at 4 ˚C with gentle shaking on a plate shaker.
The arrays were rinsed with 5% milk-PBST briefly and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature
with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 647 labeled goat anti-human IgG
(H+L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # A21445) diluted 1:150
in 5% milk-PBST. After washing three times with PBST, the slides were rinsed with water and
dried in falcon tubes by centrifugation at 1000xg for 3 minutes. The slides were scanned with a
GenePix® 4400A microarray scanner (Molecular Devices), and data were analyzed with
GenePix® Pro 7 software. Mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of every spot was quantified after
background correction was performed for each serum sample by subtracting the MFI of huAche,
which was printed as negative control within the subarray. Duplicate spot measurements were
averaged. The results were normalized relative to corresponding signal of hIgG1 and multiplied
by a hundred for presentation as percentage.
Recombinant Protein ELISAs
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was coated onto high-binding 96-well plates
(Corning, 3690) at 2 μg/mL, overnight at 4 ˚C. Wash steps were done using 1xPBS containing
0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma, P1379) and all incubations were done at 25 ˚C. Plates were blocked with
3% nonfat dry milk (BioRad, P1379) in 1xPBS for 1 hour. Serum from COVID-19 convalescent
patients was serially diluted in 1XPBS, containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20, then
added to plates and incubated for 2 hours. Following plate washing, serum reactivity to the Spike
protein was measured using an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen, 31410)
at a 1:3000 dilution for 1 hour. After a final wash, Ultra-TMB substrate (ThermoFisher, 34029)

was added to the plates and incubated for 5 minutes, followed by quenching of the reaction by
addition of an equal volume of 0.5M H2SO4. Absorption was measured at OD450 using a Synergy4
plate reader (Biotek), and data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism7.0 to calculate IC50 values.
PNGase F Digestion of Spike Protein
For PNGase F digestion, purified Spike protein expressed from Expi293FTM or ExpiCHO-STM
cells was digested under denaturing reaction conditions. 5 μg of protein, 1 μL of Glycoprotein
denaturing buffer (NEB Cat # B0701S, 10X) and 4 μL water were mixed to a total of 10 μL. The
spike glycoproteins were denatured at 100° C for 10 minutes, and the denatured proteins incubated
on ice for 5 minutes and centrifuged for 10 seconds at max speed on a microcentrifuge. Next, 2 μL
of GlycoBuffer 2 (NEB Cat # B0701S, 10X), 2 μL of 10% NP-40 (NEB Cat # B0701S) and 6 μL
of water were mixed with the 10 μL of denatured spike glycoprotein. Finally, 1 μL of PNGase F
(NEB Cat # P0704S) was added to the reaction and the digestion allowed to proceed at 37° C for
1 hour. Glycoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to observe loss of N-linked glycans compared
to undigested glycoproteins.
HEK293F Transient Transfections and Culture
HEK 293 suspension cells were cultured in HEK Freestyle Media (Invitrogen) at 37 C in a
humidified shaking platform incubator (Kuhner) with 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were
pelleted at 500xg and resuspended in fresh media. For small-scale (1mL cells at 1x106/mL)
transient transfections performed in 24-well non-treated tissue culture plates, 2 μg
Polyethylenimine (PEI) was added to 0.5 μg diluted plasmid DNA in a final volume of 100 μL.
For small-scale (.25 mL cells at 1 x106/mL) transient transfections performed in 48-well nontreated tissue culture plates, .5 μg Polyethylenimine (PEI) was added to 0.125 μg diluted plasmid
DNA in a final volume of 25 μL. DNA-PEI complexes were incubated at room temperature for 10
minutes, and then added directly to cells in 48-well plates.

Flow Cytometry Titration Experiment
Flow cytometry titration assays were performed with the OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 proteins
described above. HEK293F suspension cells were transfected with human ACE2, mouse ACE2,
human CD26, or GFP. Both ACE2 variants were expressed with GFP tags on their cytosolic C
term, while CD26 was expressed in an IRES vector expressing GFP. Two days post transfection,
cells were counted and diluted to 1x10^6 cells/mL in 1x PBS, .2% BSA. OptSpike1 and OptSpike2
proteins were serially diluted to a range of concentrations from 1 nM - 10 μM. Subsequently, 10
μL of diluted Spike protein was added to 90 μL diluted cells in wells of a 96-well plate (90,000
cells per well). Binding was performed at room temperature for 1 hour with shaking at 900 rpm,
after which the cells were washed 2x with 1x PBS .2% BSA by centrifugation. Cells were then
incubated with a PE-labeled anti-6x His tag antibody (Abcam Cat # ab72467), to detect Spike
protein binding. Antibody binding was performed for 30 minutes at room temperature with
shaking, after which the cells were washed 2x with 1x PBS, .2% BSA by centrifugation. Cells
were analyzed by Flow Cytometry/Spectral Analysis on a SONY Spectral Analyzer. Gated live
cells were sub-gated for GFP, and GFP positive cells sub-gated for PE positive events. Data points
represent the average of three independent experiments fit to the single site binding equation:
Y=Bmax*Xh/(Kdh + Xh).
Generation of a Human Plasma Membrane Protein Library for Mammalian Expression
The human genome was analyzed for all transcripts that contain at least one transmembrane
domain (TMHMM Server 2.0) and a predicted secretion signal peptide sequence [27, 28]. The
resulting list of 14,028 transcripts was manually purged of mitochondrial, nuclear and ER
membrane proteins, resulting in a final target set of 9,065 potential human plasma membrane
transcripts representing a set of 4,860 genes. All of the full-length cDNAs available from
GeneCopoeiaTM were purchased as covalent C-terminal GFP fusions in a CMV mammalian

expression plasmid (3926 Total). To enhance library coverage of proteins missing from the
GeneCopoeia library, a separate set of synthetic transcripts was ordered from Gen9™ (1282 Total).
This set was selected by identifying the largest transcript for each of the missing proteins with the
limitation that they be under 4kb in length (the limit for high-throughput synthesis). Each fulllength cDNA was codon optimized, synthesized and sub-cloned into the Clonetech pEGFP N1
vector as C-terminal GFP fusions. Working libraries of Ig superfamily proteins (IGSF), TNF
receptor superfamily proteins (TNFRSF), G-Protein coupled receptor proteins (GPCR), Integrins
and chemokines were identified for each subfamily based on lists generated using the HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene family resource[29]. Each set was re-arrayed manually
from glycerol stocks into liquid 2xYT media in 96-well deep-well blocks. Overnight cultures were
mini-prepped in 96-well plates (Macherey Nagel kits) for use in downstream high-throughput
mammalian cell transfections.
High-throughput Screening of Human Plasma Membrane Protein Library
The human plasma membrane protein library was transfected into HEK293F cells in 48well format. Two days post-transfection, cells were diluted to 1 x106cells/mL in .2% BSA. Binding
reactions were setup in 96-well V-bottom plates by incubating 100 μL cells with 200 nM
OptSpike1; each plate also contained hACE2-GFP expressing cells as an internal positive control.
After 45 minutes, cells were pelleted and washed twice, and then incubated with an anti-HIS PE
antibody, washed twice, and analyzed on a SONY Spectral Analyzer. The percent bound was
calculated as the number of double-positive events (GFP and mCherry) divided by the total number
of GFP positive cells. Expression of hACE2, mACE2, CD147, CD26, Siglec9, Siglec10, Ceacam1,
and Ceacam5 were confirmed by antibody staining of transfected HEK293F cells. Binding was
conducted as described for S protein binding. Antibodies used: hACE2 and mACE2 (RND Cat #

RESULTS
Enhanced expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins
To determine conditions for the enhanced expression and purification of the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein, we tested the expression of two recently reported recombinant variants (OptSpike1 and
OptSpike2, Fig. 1A) in both the Expi293FTM and ExpiCHO-STM cells [18]. The ExpiCHO-STM
expression system reproducibly afforded the highest yield per liter (~28 mg/L) of transfected cells
for both versions of the S protein (Fig. 1B). OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 were readily produced at a
high level of purity, via transient transfection of both Expi293FTM and ExpiCHO-STM cells,
followed by purification with Nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1C).
SEC revealed that both S proteins ran at the appropriate size on a HiLoadTM 16/600 SuperdexTM
200 gel filtration column (Fig. 1D-G), without the presence of significant aggregates. To identify
optimal culture growth times, a time course was performed for both constructs in both expression
systems, and the optimal day for harvest was found to be day 6 in Expi293FTM cells and day 12 in
ExpiCHO-STM cells (Fig. 1H-I). Additionally, the ExpiCHO-STM standard titer and high titer
protocols (Fig. S1H) were compared. Collectively, these data reveal that the ExpiCHO-STM
expression system is more efficient than the Expi293FTM expression system for the production of
recombinant Spike protein. To provide further information about the stability, quality, and
aggregation state of OptSpike1 and OptSpike2, their biophysical properties were characterized by
a number of approaches.
PNGase F Digestion of Recombinant S protein produced in HEK or CHO cells
OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 proteins migrated as slightly larger species on SDS-PAGE when
expressed in the Expi293FTM cells as compared to the ExpiCHO-STM system (Fig. 2A), and we
hypothesized that this difference in size of the proteins was due to differential N-linked

glycosylation associated with Expi293FTM and ExpiCHO-STM cells. Heat denatured OptSpike1 was
digested with PNGase F, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine
residues in N-linked glycoproteins, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. While undigested OptSpike1
produced in Expi293FTM cells runs larger than OptSpike1 produced in ExpiCHO-STM, the
difference in apparent molecular weight is abolished after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2A). It is
known that the recombinant S proteins are heavily glycosylated, and these results confirm that
these proteins exist as distinct N-linked glycoforms when expressed in different mammalian
expression systems, as has been previously reported with a number of other glycoproteins [3537]. Importantly, these differences in glycosylation had no effect on reactivity with sera from
convalescent patients (see Fig. 4B).
Size Exclusion Chromatography and Multi Angle Light Scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis
of OptSpike1 and OptSpike2
The purified, concentrated OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 proteins were analyzed by FPLC on a
SuperoseTM 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Fig. S1A-D), and by HPLC on a Yarra™ 3 µm SEC4000 LC Column (Fig. 2B-C, Fig. S1E-F), both of which are appropriate for resolving proteins in
the range of, and greater than, the predicted molecular mass (based on amino acid sequence) of
~420 kDa of trimeric OptSpike1 and OptSpike2. On the SuperoseTM 6 Increase 10/300 GL column
OptSpike1 and Optspike2 eluted as a single peak within the included volume, with an apparent
molecular mass of ~670 kDa, and did not form aggregates (Fig. S1A-D). Interestingly, analysis on
the Yarra™ 3 µm SEC-4000 LC Column showed that both OptSpike1 and OptSpike2, expressed
in either Expi293FTM or ExpiCHO-STM cells, eluted as two partially overlapping peaks (elution
times of 10.35 and 11.00 mL) (Fig. 2B, 2C, Fig. S1E, F), which could not be resolved on the
SuperoseTM 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Fig. S1A-D). Furthermore, after storage at 4°C for
fourteen days, the distribution of the elution volume shifted entirely to the faster migrating peak at

10.35 mL (Fig. 2B-C). The OptSpike1 produced in ExpiCHO-STM cells was analyzed with Multi
Angle Light Scattering (MALS) one day after purification, and the polydispersity index (PDI) for
species present across both peaks was 1.006, indicating the species across both peaks are uniform
with respect to molecular mass (Fig. 2D, 2F). The molecular mass of this species was calculated
to be 486 kDa ± 2.1% using MALS, which is larger than the predicated molecular mass of 420
kDa (based on the amino acid sequence of trimeric OptSpike1 and not accounting for glycans).
The PDI of OptSpike1 on Day 14 (which ran as one peak) was determined to be 1.005, which also
indicated that this peak is uniform, and the molecular mass from MALS was 493 kDa± 1.08%
(Fig.2E, 2F). OptSpike-2-HEK, and OptSpike2-CHO exhibited a similar two peak profile when
analyzed on the Yarra™ 3 µm SEC-4000 LC Column (Fig. S1E, F) Together, these data indicate
that the existence of closely related species that likely arise from conformational conversion and
not from changes in oligomeric state (see below).
Thermal Denaturation of OptSpike1 and OptSpike2
Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was used to assess the relative thermal stabilities of
OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 produced in ExpiCHO-STM cells. Analysis of DSF data revealed no
discernible difference in melting behavior, with both OptSpike1 and 2 exhibiting two similar
melting transitions (OptSpike1 Tm1 = 49.2° C, Tm2 = 63.4° C and OptSpike2 Tm1 = 48.7° C, Tm2 =
63.9° C) (Fig. 2G). This consistent behavior suggests that differences in expression yields of
OptSpike1 and Optspike2 are likely not due to inherent differences in protein stability.
Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) analysis of OptSpike1
To confirm that purified OptSpike1-CHO is a stable trimer and further evaluate the molecular
mass, we conducted a series of sedimentation velocity experiments as a function of protein
concentration. Six concentrations of S protein were centrifuged spanning a range from 136 nM to
4.8 µM. The distribution of sedimentation coefficients g(s*), and in particular the maxima of the

main peak, are invariant over the concentration range examined (Fig. S1H). This behavior
demonstrates that the protein molecules present in the preparation are stable non-interacting
particles. The distribution of species present in a solution of non-interacting particles can be
deconvolved using a continuous distribution, c(s), analysis (Fig. 2H, Fig. S1H). The dominant
peak (68%) in the c(s) distribution has a mass of 455 kDa consistent with the S protein trimer being
the dominant protein present in the solution. This calculated molecular mass is comparable to both
the predicted molecular mass based on amino acid sequence (420 kDa), and the molecular mass
determined by MALS (490 kDa). The best fit ratio of f / fo is 1.63 indicative of significant
geometric asymmetry. These data demonstrate that the OptSpike1 is a stable trimer in solution
from nM to µM protein concentrations.
Biochemical Characterization of OptSpike1 interaction with Human ACE2
Purified OptSpike1-CHO protein activity was demonstrated by binding to human ACE2
(hACE2), but not mouse ACE2 (mACE2) or human CD26 (hCD26), the entry receptor for
MERS. 500 nM OptSpike1 trimer was incubated with HEK293F cells expressing hACE2, mACE2
or hCD26 —all C-terminally tagged with GFP— and binding was detected by flow cytometry with
an anti-His PE labeled antibody recognizing the His8 tag on the S protein (see Fig. S3A).
Expression and cell surface localization of hACE2, mACE2, and hCD26 was confirmed by
antibody staining (Fig. S3E-F, K). Strong binding to cells expressing hACE2 (Fig. 3A, 3C) was
observed, but not to cells expressing mACE2 or hCD26 (Fig. 3B, 3C), confirming that the S
protein does not bind to CD26 (in agreement with previous reports [38]), and confirming
specificity of the S protein for hACE2. Titration of hACE2-expression HEK293 cells with
recombinant OptSpike1 (0.0025 - 400 nM) yielded an EC50 of 2.0 ± 0.6 nM (Fig. 3D).

To further evaluate the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, OptSpike1-CHO was screened
for binding to 900 members (around ~20%) of the human secretome (from the Ig superfamily,
TNFR superfamily, Integrin family, chemokine family, and GPCR family – see Table S1). Each
member of this library, (tagged with cytosolic GFP to confirm expression – see Table S1 and Fig.
S3) was individually transfected into FreeStyleTM 293-F cells. Individual transfections were then
incubated with 200 nM of OptSpike1 in 96-well plate format and binding was analyzed by flow
cytometry with an anti-HIS PE labeled antibody as above. hACE2-GFP expressing cells were
included as a positive control on each plate. Integrins were screened both as individual
transfections, and as alpha-beta pairs. While strong binding to each replicate of hACE2 was
detected, we did not detect binding to any other members of the library (Fig. S3, Table S1),
including proteins suggested to be targets of S protein binding, including CD147 [39, 40], Siglec
9 and 10 [41], as well as the host cell receptors for other coronaviruses, including CEACAM1,
which is the receptor for Murine Coronavirus[42], and CD26 and CEACAM5, which are both
receptors for MERS [43]. Expression and cell surface presentation of these putative receptors was
validated using monoclonal antibodies (Fig. S3I-L).
OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 can be used reproducibly and interchangeably in COVID-19
convalescent serum ELISA
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are commonly used in clinical settings to
detect the presence of viral antibodies. Therefore, we assessed the reactivity of serum antibodies
from one COVID-19 convalescent patient toward multiple independent preparations the S
ectodomain proteins (Fig. 4A). We analyzed the EC50 and standard error by one-way ANOVA and
found that there is no statistical significance in EC50 values when different production batches of
OptSpike1 were used as the target (Fig. 4A, p>.9999), or when the different S protein constructs
OptSpike1-CHO, OptSpike2-CHO, and OptSpike1-HEK were used as the target (Fig. 4B,

p>.9999). These data demonstrate that the expression and purification protocols reported herein
consistently yield OptSpike1 with reproducible behavior in ELISAs detecting anti-S IgG
antibodies. Additionally, we have shown that reactivity of serum antibodies from convalescent
patients toward OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 is not distinguishable.
Development of a COVID-19 Multi-antigen Protein Array
Protein microarray technology allows for the high-throughput, multiplexed screening of
numerous parameters within a single experiment [44]. To simultaneously and rapidly screen the
serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens at once, we
developed a COVID-19 multi-antigen protein array presenting purified S protein, the RBD of the
S protein (Fig. S2C) and Nucleocapsid protein (Fig. S2A,B,D) of SARS CoV-2 (printed with a
Marathon Argus piezoelectric printer from Arrayjet). This multi-antigen array was challenged with
either convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients that had been previously diagnosed using RTPCR and ELISA tests, or serum from control individuals that had been collected prior to the SARSCoV-2 outbreak in November of 2019. Seropositivity of COVID-19 patients was confirmed by
ELISA (Fig. S5). In total, serum from eight individuals was screened. Individuals 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 are
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive. Individuals 1, 4 and 8 had serum collected before SARS-CoV2 was reported (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4).
Each array was printed with sixteen identical subarrays. A range of target protein concentrations
were spotted (25, 50, 100 and 200 pg per spot) and each serum was screened in duplicate (Fig.
5A-C, Fig. S4A-B). Recombinant human IgG1, which will be recognized by the anti-human-647
labeled secondary antibody, was included in each array as a positive control for protein printing.
Negative controls (human acetyl cholinesterase (huAche), printing buffer and PBS) were used to
determine nonspecific binding and background correction for data analysis. All confirmed
COVID-19 patients had strong antibody responses to the S protein in our multi-antigen protein

array, which was in good agreement with the S protein ELISAs (Fig. S4D-F, Fig. S5).
Additionally, all confirmed COVID-19 patient sera tested positive for N protein in our protein
multi-antigen array (Fig. S4H). Antibodies against the RBD were detected in serums 2, 3, 6, and
7. However, antibodies against the RBD from patients 5 (which additionally had relatively lower
detectable levels of antibodies against the S and N protein) could not be detected in this assay (Fig.
5D-G, Fig. S4 C-H). These data demonstrate the ability of the COVID-19 Multi-antigen Protein
Array to simultaneously analyze antibody responses to multiple antigens in a high-throughput
format and again validate the use of our recombinant S protein in an antigen detection platform.
Understanding variable antibody responses to the spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 antigens will
substantially impact our understanding of population-wide immune responses to COVID-19.
Cryo-EM Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S Protein produced in ExpiCHO-STM cells
Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single particle reconstruction was conducted to
assess the tertiary and quaternary arrangement of the S protein expressed in the HEK and CHO
systems (Table S2). Aliquots of purified OptSpike1 protein from each expression host (1mg/mL
in 50mM Tris and 250mM NaCl, pH 8.0) were applied to cryo-EM grids, blotted and plungefrozen in liquid ethane at LN2 temperature. Micrographs collected on a Titan Krios at 300kV, using
a K3 camera, were aligned and motion corrected followed by CTF estimation and 2D classification
as described in the methods. Particle picking, 3D refinement, and reconstruction yielded high
quality maps for samples arising from both HEK and CHO production (Fig. S6, Table S2). Using
the OptSpike1-CHO material, we obtained a 3.22 Å resolution reconstruction of the symmetrical
trimer in the closed conformation (all three RBD in the down position) (Fig. 6A-B, Fig. S6, Table
S2). Similarly, the OptSpike1-HEK material yielded a 3.44 Å reconstruction of the symmetrical
trimer in the closed conformation (Fig. S6, Table S2). Rigid body refinement and manual
adjustment in COOT followed by RSR refinement against the reconstructed maps with PHENIX

[45] yielded models with good stereochemistry and validation metrics (Table S2, Fig. 6, Fig. S6AF). Comparison of the molecular envelopes from the current work with the recently deposited
cryo-EM structure of the closed state of the SARS Cov-2 SPIKE protein (PDB: 6VXX) showed
excellent agreement. For example, structural alignment of the trimeric CHO-produced S protein
coordinates with those from 6VXX resulted in a core R.M.S.D. of 0.63Å for 2889 aligned Cα
pairs. Likewise, comparison of the coordinates for the HEK and CHO coordinates from the current
work aligned with R.M.S.D. of 0.60Å over 2696 aligned Cα pairs. This is consistent with proper
tertiary folding and trimeric quaternary organization of both samples [19].

DISCUSSION
To effectively address the COVID-19 global health crisis, reproducibility in biological and
clinical studies will be critical. Efficient and uniform production of key biological reagents is
essential for the generation of reliable data in the coming months and years. Herein, we describe
our protocols (including SOP) for the optimized production of two recently reported recombinant
forms of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We show that using the ExpiCHO-STM expression system,
recombinant S protein can be reproducibly produced in both high quantities and high quality. Our
reported yield of 28 mg/L for OptSpike1, and 18 mg/L for OptSpike2, exceed those previously
reported (OptSpike1: .5 mg/L in HEK293F cells [7], OptSpike2: 5 mg/L in Expi293FTM cells, and
.5 mg/L in insect cells [13]). To validate protein quality, we employed analytical size exclusion
chromatography,

multi

angle

light

scattering,

thermal

denaturation

and

analytical

ultracentrifugation, and demonstrated that these recombinant S proteins have similar biophysical
properties and antigenicity.
Interestingly, we found that all preparations consistently exhibited different behavior when
examined on two different analytical size exclusion columns. These proteins eluted as a single
peak on the SuperoseTM 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (agarose-based resin), but eluted as two
overlapping peaks on the Yarra™ 3 µm SEC-4000 (silica-based resin). We also noted a timedependent evolution, as the distribution of peaks on the Yarra™ 3 µm SEC-4000 moved entirely
to the faster migrating species. Furthermore, MALS analysis demonstrated that there was no mass
difference between the two overlapping peaks and AUC analysis of OptSpike1-CHO confirmed
that the predominant species in solution was a stable trimer. We propose a modest time-dependent
structural alteration of the S protein, involving two states with distinct physico-chemical
properties, resulting in differential interactions with the silica-based Yarra™ 3 µm SEC-4000
resin. This proposal is consistent with reported cryo-EM structures displaying the trimeric S

protein exists in both a closed conformation with all RBDs pointing downwards (PDB: 6VXX)
and an open conformation with one RBD pointing upwards (PDB: 6VSB and 6VYB) [7, 19].
Future work will be required to fully define the nature and functional consequences of the multiple
solution species observed for the S protein.
We demonstrate that the protein purified here is well suited for structural studies by determining
the cryo-EM structures of OptSpike1-HEK at 3.44Å resolution and OptSpike1-CHO at 3.22Å.
These structures are nearly identical to each other and are in good agreement with the closed form
observed in previously reported structures of the S protein (which were produced in HEK293F
cells) [7, 19]. Interestingly, the structures determined from protein expressed in mammalian cells
differ from a recently reported cryo-EM structure of wild type S protein produced from High
FiveTM insect cells. This structure appeared more compact overall and the model could not
accommodate the presence of the SD1 domain [46]. Whether these disparities are the consequence
of differences in expression hosts (e.g., glycosylation or other processing functions) or the lack of
stabilizing mutations, remains an open question, although RBD recognition and antigenicity was
preserved.
Both OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 proteins exhibit comparable thermal denaturation profiles with
two similar melting transitions (Fig. 2G). This finding is consistent with the thermal denaturation
profile of wild type S protein purified from High FiveTM insect cells, despite the overall structural
differences [46]. Additional work will be required to assign these transitions to specific domains
or modules within the full length COVID-19 spike protein.
Additionally, we examined the receptor-binding specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We
demonstrate strong binding between the S protein and hACE2, but not mACE2, as has been
previously reported [8, 47]. Furthermore, we screened recombinant OptSpike1 against a sublibrary of 900 members of the human secretome that were expressed on HEK-293 cells and did

not identify any additional interactions (Fig. S3C). This library included many proteins that others
have suggested may bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including CD147, Siglec 9, Siglec 10,
and proteins that other coronaviruses use for viral entry, including CD26 (MERS), CEACAM5
(MERS), and CEACAM1 (Murine Coronavirus). [41, 42, 48, 49]. CD147 is of particular interest
because of the ongoing clinical trial that aims to treat SARS-CoV-2 with Meplazumab (a
humanized anti-CD147 antibody) [39]. Importantly, for this subset of proteins, we conducted
antibody staining to explicitly evaluate cell surface localization (Fig. S3I-L). While all members
of this subset could be detected by antibody staining, and are therefore properly localize to the cell
surface, we were not able to detect binding to the S protein. It is important to note that the assay
we employed represents only one possible format for detecting protein-protein interactions
(recombinant S protein binding to cell surface displayed receptor: Fig. S3A). Because we did not
directly recapitulate the experiments that originally detected interactions between the S protein and
CD147 (SPR, ELISA, Co-IP[40]) or Siglec 9 and 10 (ELISA [41]), it is possible that the S protein
binds to these receptors in a way that is undetectable in this assay, or that there will be cell-specific
differences in presentation of the putative receptors (i.e., the requirement an unknown co-receptor
not expressed on HEK293 cells, etc.). It is important to note that anti-CD147 Abs were reported
to block COVID-19 infection in Vero E6 cells, which also express ACE2 [50], highlighting the
potential importance of cell-specific differences in receptor presentation and recognition. Further
investigations are warranted to evaluate these potential interactions. Finally, as our screening
efforts only included ~20% of the human secretome, it is important to continue to search for and
evaluate alternate interactions, which might reveal additional mechanisms of viral entry for SARSCoV-2.
We additionally demonstrate that these recombinant S proteins can be used interchangeably and
reproducibly in two different assays screening for a human serum response to S protein (ELISA:

see Fig. 4, and protein microarray: see Fig. 5, S4 and below). Validating that both S proteins can
be utilized in a serum ELISA screen is important because both OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 are being
widely utilized for serology testing at different clinical sites. These data collectively confirm that
the strategy for antigen preparation described here can be used reliably, and that the antigenicity
of OptSpike1 and OptSpike2 are comparable, regardless of cell line used (HEK vs. CHO: Fig. 5B).
These data are critical for interpreting clinical result from various institutions, which are using a
wide array of different serological tests to detect anti-S antibodies (for a complete list of antibody
tests approved for use by the FDA, please see [51]). Consequently, additional versions of the S
protein that are being used clinically should be analyzed similarly, so as to further ensure clinical
reproducibility and compatibility of different antibody serology tests.
We developed a protein microarray platform to simultaneously analyze serum for antibodies
against the S protein, as well as recombinant RBD and N protein. Microarray results from a small
cohort of serum from 5 seroreactive SARS-CoV-2 patients and serum from 3 individuals collected
before November of 2019 revealed that detectable anti-S antibody titer correlated well with results
of serological ELISAs (Fig. S4 and S5), and additionally demonstrated the simultaneous detection
of antibodies against the S protein, the N protein, and the RBD of the S protein. It is important to
note the limitations of the current platform. In particular, we stress that at present this is a
qualitative approach, as a number of variables can impact the ability to detect antibody reactivity,
including patient titers for specific antigens and the relative affinities of an antigen-specific pool.
Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the current platform is programmed to detect the capture
of IgG antibodies; thus, the resultant signal (or lack thereof) for a particular antigen could be the
consequence of prevalences between different isotypes (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM), which are
known to evolve during the course of infection and subsequent resolution. Although currently
focused on three antigens, this platform can be readily expanded to study differential antibody

responses to different SARS-CoV-2 antigens and subdomains of those antigens amongst
individuals, which are actively being investigated by others [52-55]. We are currently working to
include not only other antigens from SARS-CoV-2 (E protein, M protein, etc.), but also antigens
from other coronaviruses that may be cross reactive with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The analysis
of antibody reactivity to multiple SARS-CoV-2 and related antigens will provide broad insight
into the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Collectively, we provide standards and metrics for high quality protein reagents that can yield
comparable clinical, biological and structural data as we continue to combat the global health crisis
caused by SARS-CoV-2.
